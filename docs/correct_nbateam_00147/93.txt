Forward Amir Johnson agreed Thursday to a three-year, $11-million US contract with the Detroit Pistons.

Johnson, 20, was a restricted free agent reportedly pursued by several NBA teams which covet his seven-foot arm span, despite playing only 11 games.

He is a 58.1 per cent shooter who has averaged 6.1 points, 3.7 rebounds, 1.3 blocked shots and 14.8 minutes in 11 appearances for the Pistons over the past two seasons.

Detroit drafted Johnson in the second round (56th overall) out of Westchester high school in Los Angeles in 2005.
