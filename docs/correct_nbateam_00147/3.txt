Amir Johnson is quietly being looked at by several teams as a free-agent option.

The veteran big man, who has played 13 seasons in the NBA with the Toronto Raptors, Detroit Pistons, Boston Celtics and, most recently, the Philadelphia 76ers, is on the radar of three teams, according to Sean Deveney of the Sporting News.

Ian Begley of ESPN reports the New York Knicks have also reached out to Johnson.

The 31-year-old 13-year veteran averaged 4.6 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 15.8 minutes in 74 games (18 starts) for the 76ers last season.

The 6-foot-9, 240-pound Johnson shot 53.8 percent from the field last season. He is a career 57.2-percent shooter.
