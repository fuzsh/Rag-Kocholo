AMHERST, Va. (WSET) -- 14-year-old Marcus Rose, a basketball player at Amherst High School, decided to spend his Christmas in a different way than most teenagers.

While most kids his age are likely to be excited about what's under their tree, Marcus and his family plan to take 170 gifts to Johnson Senior Center and Fairmont Crossing Center to distribute presents to the residents.

The idea of this special gesture came from Marcus.

"I realized that this would be my first Christmas without my grandmom and then I just thought of this and I just wanted to help people out and just help my community out and represent the basketball team in Amherst," Marcus said.

His grandmother lived at Fairmont Crossing Center until she passed away last year.

"She was the rock of the family...the head." his mother, Liz said.

They said losing his grandmother was tough on everyone.

"It was really sad because that was my favorite grandma. I was very sad," Marcus said.

He shared that he remembered how happy the other seniors were when his family went to visit his grandmother.

This memory caused him to take the money he had been saving for a pair of Jordan sneakers and buy Christmas gifts for all of the seniors at the two centers instead.

"Usually when I get some money I would just spend it on a pair of shoes but this time, I just wanted to help other people out so instead of buying the pair of shoes I'm going to help other people." Marcus said.

His gifts to the seniors were a hit. He shared that he was very excited to see everyone smile.

"I was proud of him and extremely happy to do something so wonderful," his mother said.
