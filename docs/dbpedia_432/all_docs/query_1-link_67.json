        "text": "2024 GCSE results remain strong\n\nWe are delighted to share news of the excellent GCSE results achieved by our 2024 cohort, which have remained at a consistently strong level, against a national picture where grades have fallen back to pre-COVID levels. Once again, our students have risen to the challenge, demonstrating their commitment to academic excellence and their determination to achieve their personal best. We are proud to announce that 50% of all grades awarded were at a 6 (equivalent to a high grade B) or above – significantly surpassing our baseline targets and reflecting the hard work and dedication of our students and staff.\n\nOur students continue to excel across all subjects, particularly at the top end of the grading scale. We would like to give special recognition to Matthew Fong, Maximus Lai, Alfie Lumb, Josh Martin, Artemis Pang, Dean Rabbani and Jessica Wu, who have collectively amassed a remarkable 25 grade 9s between them. Their achievements are a testament to their perseverance, talent and the support provided by our school community.\n\nHere at Bridgewater, we place great emphasis on supporting and guiding all our young people, including those with additional needs or personal challenges. We are committed to a holistic approach to education that prioritises personal development alongside academic achievement. These results reflect not just academic success but also the growth and resilience of all our students as individuals.\n\nIn addition to the success of our Year 11 students, we are pleased to celebrate the accomplishments of 16 dedicated Year 10 students who sat their GCSE Statistics a year early. These students pursued their studies in their own time, demonstrating an admirable commitment to learning and we are proud to report a 100% pass rate among this group.\n\nAs we reflect on these achievements, we are reminded of the importance of setting high expectations and providing the support and encouragement necessary for our students to reach their full potential. The school is incredibly proud of this year’s cohort and look forward to seeing them continue to succeed in their future endeavours.\n\nFor families interested in the benefits of a Bridgewater education, a Whole School Open Day will be held on Saturday 2nd November 2024. To reserve your place, please register your details here>\n\nPerfect A Level pass rate for 2024\n\nWe are incredibly proud to announce that, for yet another consecutive year, our Sixth Form students have achieved a 100% pass rate in their A Level examinations. A remarkable 40% of all grades were at the highest level of A*-B, across a wide range of subjects including Art, Business Studies, English Language & Literature, French, History, Mathematics and Psychology. This continued success is a testament to their hard work, dedication and the unwavering support they have received from our teaching staff.\n\nOnce again, all of our students have successfully secured a place at a destination of their choice, with many securing their first-choice options. This year, these destinations include prestigious institutions such as Lancaster University, the University of Leeds and the University of Sheffield, among others.\n\nIt is particularly noteworthy that a number of our students have overcome significant personal challenges alongside their studies. Through close personal attention and the support provided by our small tutor groups, they have persevered and achieved results that reflect their resilience and determination. We are immensely proud of each and every one of them for their commitment and dedication.\n\nThis year’s success is especially significant, as it is the first time students impacted by COVID during their earlier exam years were not given any provision with grade boundaries. To maintain the high standards set by their predecessors under these circumstances is an achievement to be truly proud of.\n\nThe efforts of our young people have paved the way for them to embark on some incredibly exciting opportunities, with degree courses ranging from Aerospace Engineering, Sports Journalism and English Literature, to Business, International History & Politics, Artificial Intelligence, Marketing & PR, Accounting and Law.\n\nAs we celebrate these achievements, we look forward to seeing our students thrive in their chosen fields, confident that the education and values they have received at Bridgewater School will continue to guide them in all their future endeavours.\n\nFor those interested in the benefits of a Bridgewater education for their A Level studies, a Sixth Form Open Evening will be held on Thursday 26th September 2024. To register, please contact Mrs Hilton, Head of Sixth Form, hiltonv@bwslive.co.uk\n\nWellbeing Week initiative introduced\n\nWe believe that the health and wellbeing of our students is fundamental to their overall development and success. With this in mind, we were delighted to introduce an exciting new addition to the Senior School calendar: Wellbeing Week. This significant initiative, running across the first week in July, was designed to provide our senior students with a variety of activities aimed at enhancing their social, emotional, physical and practical wellbeing.\n\nWellbeing Week featured a carefully curated selection of sessions to support and nurture every aspect of student life. Highlights included:\n\nFinancial Wellbeing session to help equip our young people with essential skills for managing their future finances\n\nOutdoor exploration and discovery activities at RHS Bridgewater and other local places of interest\n\nAnnual 5K run in aid of St. Ann’s Hospice\n\nProviding a creative outlet through practical crafting and origami\n\nFostering a love of reading and allowing students to immerse themselves in literature with our school-wide Readathon\n\nIntroducing Neurographical Art – a meditative art form that blends creativity with stress relief\n\nYoga sessions to help students relax, focus and maintain physical and mental balance\n\nParticipation in our annual Sports Day and Awards Assembly yo celebrate collective and individual achievements\n\nAnnual Rewards Day Trip to Blackpool Pleasure Beach.\n\nTo ensure that our initiatives continue to meet the needs of our students, we have issued a wellbeing survey to all pupils. Their feedback will be invaluable in shaping future events and activities, allowing us to further support their growth and development.\n\nWe are hopeful that many of these activities will become regular features on our school timetable, ensuring that Bridgewater School remains a place where every student can flourish and thrive.\n\nMs Hemmings leads by example\n\nAt Bridgewater School we are always incredibly proud of the example our staff continue to set for their students, showcasing unwavering dedication and commitment to striving for excellence. This summer, we are delighted to congratulate Ms Hemmings on her outstanding academic accomplishments. She was awarded a CMI Level 7 Diploma in Strategic Management and Practice with Distinction, granting her the prestigious status of ‘Fellow of CMI and Chartered Manager‘. In addition, she earned an MA in Educational Leadership with Merit at her recent graduation ceremony.\n\nThese achievements are particularly commendable given that Ms Hemmings completed both demanding two-year courses while fulfilling her responsibilities as Head of Learning Support, Head of Religious Studies and Assistant Head. Throughout this time, she has remained deeply committed to the development and wellbeing of her students, demonstrating the very qualities we aim to instil in our school community.\n\nMs Hemmings’ dedication to professional growth and her ability to balance multiple roles while pursuing further education serve as an inspiration to both staff and students alike. We celebrate her success and are grateful for the continued positive impact she has on Bridgewater School.\n\nCelebrating success in UK Maths Challenge\n\nAt Bridgewater School, we place great importance on problem-solving, challenging ourselves and achieving academic excellence. Earlier this year, selected pupils from across various year groups took part in the Intermediate and Junior Maths Challenges – national 60-minute, 25-multiple choice exams designed to challenge students from schools around the country. These exams encourage mathematical reasoning, precision of thought, and the application of maths in creative and innovative ways.\n\nWe are incredibly proud of all the students who participated in these challenges. Their hard work and dedication to mathematics have led to some outstanding achievements. Congratulations to all who were awarded certifications in recognition of their success, with special mentions to Artemis Pang (Year 11) and Avalyn Parker (Year 8) for being the best in the school, and to Hari Basu (Year 10), Charlie Gerrard (Year 7) and Alexander Cleland (Prep V) for accomplishing the best results in their respective year groups.\n\nYear 11 (Intermediate Challenge)\n\nArtemis Pang – Gold Award\n\nDean Rabbani – Bronze Award\n\nKaiwen Zhao – Bronze Award\n\nYear 10 (Intermediate Challenge)\n\nKian Ainscough – Bronze Award\n\nHari Basu – Silver Award\n\nLouis Booth – Bronze Award\n\nMatteo Cervellione – Bronze Award\n\nHarper Torkington – Bronze Award\n\nYear 8 (Junior Challenge)\n\nBraeden Blenkiron-Brown – Silver Award\n\nTyler Bridge – Bronze Award\n\nDonya Hedayati – Bronze Award\n\nElena Jones – Bronze Award\n\nMax Jones – Bronze Award\n\nAvalyn Parker – Gold Award\n\nSpencer Rigby-Partington – Silver Award\n\nJoel Roberts-Harris – Silver Award\n\nYear 7 (Junior Challenge)\n\nEsther Akinnusi – Bronze Award\n\nCharlie Gerrard – Silver Award\n\nLayla Livsey – Bronze Award\n\nHarry Tyldesley – Bronze Award\n\nHumaira Umarji – Bronze Award\n\nPrep (Junior Challenge)\n\nAlexander Cleland – Bronze Award\n\nIsabelle Harrison – Bronze Award\n\nTanisha Joshi – Bronze Award\n\nTilly Martin – Bronze Award\n\nDiary of our Musical Theatre London Trip\n\nBy Year 7 students, Sophie Hogan and Aduke Opeyemi.\n\nDay 1: An Exciting Start\n\nThe London trip was certainly a trip we will remember. It was full of fun-filled memories that made it such an amazing experience. This was a trip with the choir and the cast of this year’s drama performance, Legally Blonde JR.\n\nThe train journey was two and a half hours, and we got to sit in pairs. When we got off the train, we made our way to Marks and Spencer and got ourselves lunch. After that, we had a nice stroll to the park and relaxed while eating lunch – this was very enjoyable as the weather was sunny and fresh. Next, we went for a tour of the British Museum before going back to the hotel to get to know our roommates. For dinner, we went to Pizza Hut, and afterwards bought sweets and watched Back to the Future the Musical at the theatre. We saw the cool effects and the amazing car: the Delorean, made by the scientist, Doc Brown. We absolutely loved the songs, especially “My Myopia”. When we got back, we had lots of fun in our rooms before going to sleep.\n\nDay 2: A Day Full of Activities\n\nDay 2 was the most productive day and the most memorable as well. First, we got ready and went for breakfast – which was a buffet with cereal, drinks, pastries and fruit. Next, we went to a dance workshop. This was very tiring but fun because we did a song from Back to the Future with a professional. After that we had the opportunity to go shopping in Covent Garden, where there were stands and people performing – this tool a while but was very fun. After lunch we went to the London Eye, and during our walk, we saw Big Ben, We also saw a man singing, and it was really nice there as the songs he sang made us dance! There was a tin man there also, who was pretty cool to talk to. On the London Eye we saw both London Bridge and Westminster Bridge – the view was amazing and so pretty – it felt like a dream. When we got off, we walked straight to BYRON, where we ate burgers for dinner. Finally, we went to watch Mrs Doubtfire, which was very funny and the staging was very well planned, so it was very entertaining. We walked back and had another night in our rooms.\n\nDay 3: A Bittersweet Farewell\n\nDay 3 was our final day. We got ready to leave and enjoyed the same breakfast. We also had to tidy up our rooms for a final room check. We then made our way to the British Library and saw many historical books at the exhibition. After that, we went to the train station and bought lunch for the train. The journey was nice and relaxing, and finally, we were home.\n\nIn conclusion, the trip was very fun and we would highly recommend going if you want to create memories with your friends.\n\nYear 9 student makes golfing history\n\nAt Bridgewater School we are incredibly proud of our students’ achievements both in and out of the classroom. One shining example is the golfing success of Year 9 student Toby Ainsworth, who, at just 13 years of age, has been making waves in the golfing community.\n\nToby competes weekly in the Worsley Park Marriott Golf Club competitions, playing both on Saturdays and midweek after school. He is the only junior golfer currently competing and playing under the same conditions as the adults, including using the same tees and adhering to the same rules.\n\nOver the past year, Toby has triumphed in three competitions, with his most recent victories taking place earlier this month. On Saturday 1st June, Toby clinched a significant win in the major annual competition known as The Masters, securing victory by an impressive 4 points. This remarkable achievement means his name will be immortalised on the board at Worsley Park, making him the youngest player ever to receive this honour.\n\nToby’s journey in golf began in earnest just over a year ago. He has been honing his skills with weekly lessons at Bolton Golf Club under the guidance of professional golfer Matthew Galley. Despite this relatively short timeframe, Toby has already achieved a handicap of 7.1, which he aims to lower further during the summer. His club head speed rivals that of several professionals on the PGA tour, highlighting his exceptional potential.\n\nGolf is more than just a hobby for Toby; it is his passion. His dedication to the sport is evident in his consistent performance and eagerness to improve.\n\nAt Bridgewater we believe that fostering a balanced education with opportunities for students to pursue their interests and talents outside of the classroom is crucial. Toby’s achievements in golf are a testament to what can be accomplished when students are encouraged to explore their passions and strive for excellence.\n\nKey Stage 1 pupils present Aladdin KIDS\n\nThe summer term was an exciting time for our Key Stage 1 pupils as they showcased their budding performance skills in a super production of Disney’s Aladdin KIDS. This special adaptation of the 1992 Disney film was tailored for young performers, providing a perfect platform for our Prep I and II pupils to shine.\n\nIn a vibrant 30-minute musical, the children brought to life the legendary tale of Aladdin, the lovable thief with a heart of gold, captivating families and friends who joined them on their magical journey. The audience was whisked away to mystical caves, enjoyed thrilling magic carpet rides and saw the clever outwitting of the evil sorcerer, Jafar, by Aladdin, Jasmine and the fast-talking, wisecracking Genie.\n\nMr Rooney, Head of the Prep Department, expressed his pride in the pupils’ achievements:\n\n“Our performances continue to bring the best out of our children: improved self-confidence, public speaking skills and the ability to work in an ensemble, to name but a few. The children worked extremely hard to learn their lines and rehearsed tirelessly with our Bridgewater staff to create such an amazing spectacle.\n\n“The production of Aladdin KIDS was not only a testament to the talent and dedication of our young performers, but also a celebration of the supportive community here at Bridgewater School. We look forward to many more performances that allow our pupils to explore their creativity and develop their skills.”\n\nDisney’s Aladdin KIDS was presented through special arrangement with and all materials provided by Music Theatre International.\n\nThe Bridge – student magazine\n\nWe are excited to announce the launch of our new student editorial magazine, ‘The Bridge’. Our dedicated and enthusiastic student editorial team, led by Sixth Form’s Dalia Yousif and Joseph Graham, is thrilled to present the first edition which showcases the vibrant voices and journalistic talents of our students.\n\n‘The Bridge’ offers a rich variety of content that reflects the diverse interests and perspectives of our school community. Highlights of the first edition include an insightful interview with Bridgewater’s Head of Science, Mr Hargreaves, engaging creative writing short stories, and thought-provoking debate discussions on both school affairs and current global issues.\n\nOur editorial team is committed to ensuring that the magazine serves as a platform for all students to express their opinions and share their creative work. They are eagerly seeking submissions from all Senior School year groups on a wide range of topics including sports, music and film.\n\n“Prioritising student voice and interests, and then bridging it with school life, is the main aim of our magazine,” said the editors. “Our vision is to create a publication that not only informs, but also connects and inspires the school community.”\n\nWe invite you to explore the inaugural edition of ‘The Bridge’ and celebrate the talents and insights of our students.\n\nView The Bridge\n\nJoin us in supporting our students’ efforts and in appreciating the unique perspectives they bring to our school.\n\nBridgewater’s rising equestrian talent\n\nBridgewater School is proud to celebrate the outstanding accomplishments of Year 11 student, Jessica Weir. Jessica, alongside her horse, Lindeth Con-Artist, has recently qualified for this year’s Royal International Horse Show, a testament to her exceptional talent and dedication. Adding to this impressive achievement, Jessica has also secured a place as the prestigious Horse of the Year Show, to be held at the NEC this October.\n\nThe Horse of the Year Show is renowned and attracts the top equestrians from across the country. Jessica’s qualification is particularly noteworthy as she is one of only 15 riders to qualify for the 153cm Show Hunter Pony Class. Achieving this on her first attempt is a remarkable feat that underscores her skill and commitment.\n\nJessica’s journey with Lindeth Con-Artist began just 18 months ago. In this short time, she has forged a successful partnership with her horse. Unlike many competitors in her class, Jessica’s achievements are particularly impressive as she competes against professional produced horses. Lindeth Con-Artist however, is ‘home-produced’, meaning Jessica undertakes all the training and care herself.\n\nJessica’s accomplishments are a source of great pride for us all and we look forward to seeing the duo continue to shine at the upcoming show and wish them the best of luck.\n\nCelebrating acts of kindness\n\nRecognising and celebrating achievement is at the heart of what we do, so we are continually delighted when this spirit is embodied by our school community. Recently, one of our Prep pupils exemplified this spirit of kindness and thoughtfulness in a truly heart-warming gesture.\n\nMeet Tilly, a Prep VI pupil, whose empathy and generosity left a lasting impact on her teacher. Upon learning that Mr Suter harboured a lifelong dream of earning a Blue Peter badge, Tilly took it upon herself to make this dream a reality.\n\nMr Suter, known for his dedication to his pupils’ holistic development, has been actively encouraging his class to work towards achieving their own Blue Peter badges. In addition to the traditional Blue Peter ‘blue’ badge launched back in the 1960s, there are now special badges for different achievements, such as the Book, Music and Green badges. Mr Suter has even created a ‘badge wall’ in his classroom, proudly displaying photographs of the children alongside their badges.\n\nTilly’s nomination of Mr Suter was recognised by the Blue Peter team, who awarded the eleven year old a Silver badge for her kindness and sent Mr Suter his very own Blue Peter cloth emblem – a symbol “reserved for truly deserving adults.”\n\nThis thoughtful gesture not only brought immense joy to Mr Suter but also touched the hearts of us all. Acts of kindness like Tilly’s act as a reminder of the impact of compassion and generosity and we could not be prouder.\n\nBridgewater runners shine at Mcr Marathon\n\nThe streets of Manchester served as the backdrop for an inspiring display of energy and dedication during the 2024 Adidas Manchester Marathon. Among the thousands who participated from around the country, three individuals from Bridgewater School stood out for their remarkable achievements and unwavering support for a noble cause.\n\nMrs Hilton, Mr Connolly and Mrs O’Callaghan, accompanied by her husband Mark, proudly represented Bridgewater School as they took on the 26.2 mile challenge. Their participation was not just about personal triumphs, it was also a testament to their true commitment to making a difference.\n\nEach runner tackled the marathon with determination, pushing themselves to surpass personal goals and achieve new milestones. What is even more remarkable is the collective impact of these amazing individuals. Through their participation, nearly £4,000 was raised in support of Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, helping support those affected by cancer and advancing vital research and treatment initiatives.\n\nTheir inspiring journey serves as a reminder of the power of individuals coming together for a common cause and we celebrate their achievements as shining examples of our school community’s spirit and values.\n\nFor anyone wishing to donate online, please follow the links below:\n\nMrs Hilton – Macmillan\n\nMr Connolly – Cancer Research UK\n\nEYFS and Prep Open Morning 2024\n\nWhen it comes to finding the perfect learning environment for your child, the team here at Bridgewater School believe that the best way to see why children are so happy here is to experience our school for yourself. Which explains why all journeys at our family-focused school begin with a personal visit.\n\nBuilt into our foundations is an ethos of treating every child as an individual and, with the national focus on children’s mental health and wellbeing alongside academic progress, never before has personal recognition and understanding been more important.\n\nWhich is why the school has curated an Open Morning event specifically for parents interested in Early Years and Primary / Preparatory education. Taking place at the school on Saturday 20th April between 10am and 1pm, this event will enable families with younger children to meet our highly experienced and qualified teaching staff whilst experiencing our school’s inclusive and nurturing atmosphere for themselves.\n\nSaid Mrs Nairn, Headmistress “At Bridgewater School our individual approach and small class sizes ensure that every pupil is able to flourish within a secure, continuous learning environment and we hope this open event gives families the opportunity to experience that.”\n\nTo reserve a place, please register your details here> or call 0161 794 1463.\n\nArthur and Florence champion excellence\n\nWe are immensely proud to share the remarkable sporting achievements of talented siblings, Arthur and Florence. Representing Bridgewater School with determination and passion, they have showcased their athletic prowess in recent cross country championships, both bringing home well-deserved accolades.\n\nYear 7’s Arthur delivered an outstanding performance in this year’s regional qualifier of the ISA Cross Country Championships. His exceptional run earned him a silver medal and the honour of representing the North of England in the national finals. Supported by fellow student, Joel, who was sadly forced to pull out of the final due to injury, Arthur secured a highly commendable position in the top 20, marking a fantastic accomplishment for himself and Bridgewater School.\n\nMeanwhile, Florence, a pupil in Prep V, demonstrated her talent by earning the opportunity to represent Salford Schools in the Schools Championships for Years 5 and 6. An impressive performance led to a top 10 selection, with Florence finishing as the 4th girl for Salford and contributing as a valuable points scorer. Despite her young age, Florence also displayed marvellous resilience by representing Bridgewater in the ISA Cross Country event at Scarisbrick Hall, narrowly missing out on national qualification after a fall.\n\nBeyond their school endeavours, both Arthur and Florence continue to exhibit excellent dedication to their sport by training and competing for the Salford Mets Athletic Club. Competing within the younger year of their respective age divisions, they participate in races across the north west, tirelessly working towards their goals and achieving remarkable success. Their efforts have been rewarded with a range of team and individual awards in the South East Lancashire League, truly reflecting their passion and spirit.\n\nAs a school we take pride in nurturing the holistic development of all out students and commend Arthur and Florence on their outstanding attitudes. Congratulations!\n\nArtist of the Month February 2024\n\nOur Senior School students have already created some exciting art this term and the Art Department was delighted to recognise the following students for their outstanding pieces of work. Artist of the Month for January and February 2024 has therefore been awarded to:\n\nYear 7\n\nArthur Barker\n\nHarry Burrows\n\nLily Campbell\n\nIsabelle Gibbons\n\nSofia Oliveira\n\nInathi Rozani\n\nYear 8\n\nEni Adedeji\n\nZara Animasaun\n\nAngelina Atkin\n\nTyler Bridge\n\nEvan Cooper\n\nAva Gerrard\n\nElissa Mahjoub\n\nYear 9\n\nToby Ainsworth\n\nJasmine Carroll\n\nAeron Fleming\n\nJackson Ismail\n\nOlivia Parks\n\nYear 10\n\nIsabella Alldred\n\nThea Birch\n\nMillie Cleary\n\nIzzy Grant\n\nYear 11\n\nImani Meech\n\nAmber Old\n\nArtemis Pang\n\nJessica Weir\n\nDelivering success through sport\n\nAt Bridgewater School we understand that success comes in many forms, which is why we celebrate not only the achievements on the field, but also the joy of sportsmanship and personal growth that come with it. This term our Prep pupils have demonstrated outstanding spirit, positivity and commitment and their efforts have been rewarded with success in various sporting competitions.\n\nFollowing the achievements of our Prep VI footballers, who successfully reached the semi-finals of the ISA competition hosted by Manchester City Football Club, the Bridgewater U11 football team delivered an exceptional performance in the regional qualifier of this year’s ISA tournament, securing their place in the national finals where they will represent the North of England. The boys now travel to St. George’s Park to compete at the proud home of England’s national football teams.\n\nIn the Worsley Netball League our Prep V and VI teams have maintained an impressive unbeaten record this season, highlighting their dedication and talent in the sport. Furthermore, our Prep VI Handball team excelled in the recent ISA tournament hosted at Beech House School, where they capitalised on their versatility and teamwork to reach the final.\n\nIndividual success has also been celebrated at several of this year’s prestigious regional competitions. An excellent performance at the AJIS Indoor Athletics Competition resulted in commendations for Prep VI’s Olivia (2nd place in the throwing event), Oliver (3rd place in triple jump) and Ben (Prep V), who earned a place on the podium in the vertical jump. Additionally, Florence (Prep V) and Rose (Prep IV) relished the opportunity to represent Bridgewater in the Salford Schools Cross Country Championships earlier this month.\n\nIt is not only our students but also our teachers who have been leading by example in sport. Mrs Tunney’s remarkable performances in a series of road races as part of the Central Lancashire Grand Prix earned her the title of 5th fastest lady in her most recent outing. Meanwhile, Mr Connolly and Mrs Hilton are diligently preparing for the 2024 Adidas Manchester Marathon, where they will be running in support of Macmillan Cancer Support, one of the school’s longstanding charity partners.\n\nAs we look ahead, there lie an abundance of opportunities in which every pupil can participate and flourish and we look forward to the personal triumphs that await.\n\nChildren’s Mental Health Week 2024\n\nAt Bridgewater School, we understand the importance of nurturing not only the academic but also the emotional wellbeing of our students. That is why, during Children’s Mental Health Week, which took place between 5th and 11th February 2024, we focused on empowering our pupils to recognise the value of their voices and the impact they can have on their community and themselves.\n\nThe theme for this year’s Children’s Mental Health Week was “My Voice Matters”. Because, when children feel that their voices are heard and can make a difference, it has a profoundly positive effect on their wellbeing and self-esteem.\n\nThroughout the week, whole school activities and PSCHE (Personal, Social, Citizenship and Health Education) lessons centred around this theme. These activities were designed to encourage students to express themselves, think about what was important to them as individuals, share their thoughts and feelings, and recognise the power of their words and actions. From classroom discussions to creative projects, our students had the opportunity to explore topics such as self-expression, empathy and the importance of listening to others.\n\nBy fostering a culture of openness, empathy and resilience, together we can create a supportive environment where every child feels heard, valued and empowered to make a difference.\n\nBridgewater presents Legally Blonde JR\n\nStudents had Worsley thinking pink when they presented their 2024 production of Legally Blonde JR. Show-stopping performances from a talented young cast, which featured Year 8’s Lily Knights as the iconic Elle Woods, ensured success as actors and audience alike revelled in this fun and upbeat musical.\n\nThe production follows the adventures of Delta Nu sorority president Elle Woods (“a Gemini with a double Capricorn moon”) as she tries to win back the affections of her ex-boyfriend by earning a Harvard law degree. Once at school, she is challenged by her peers and her professors, but with the help of some new friends, Elle realises her true potential and sets out to prove herself to the world.\n\nMrs Embrey, Director of Music at Bridgewater, says “Legally Blonde JR. may be a comedic, light-hearted show, but it also explores serious themes of self-discovery and independence which resonate with people of all ages. Our students were totally ‘psyched’ with their production and we hope everyone enjoyed the show.”\n\nWith a book by Heather Hach, music and lyrics by Laurence O’Keefe and Nell Benjamin, Legally Blonde JR is based on the book by Amanda Brown and the hit Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer motion picture starring Reese Witherspoon, which was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture. Legally Blonde the Musical opened at Broadway’s Palace Theatre in April 2007.\n\nDemi helps Manchester Magic retain title\n\nWe firmly believe that with the right people around us we are capable of achieving anything. This was demonstrated perfectly on January 20th as Year 11’s Demi led his Manchester Magic basketball team to back-to-back U16 Sure Shot National Cup titles.\n\nDemi, who amassed 24 rebounds, 20 points, two assists and five steals in the final match against Bristol Academy Flyers, was awarded MPV (Most Valuable Player) and celebrated by Magic’s head coach Tom Paraskeva, in what was a fantastic whole team performance.\n\n“Demi worked really hard and played for the team. It’s about the team, couldn’t be more proud of the guys. We had multiple 20-point scorers, multiple people on the boards and it’s all the little things, Henry was amazing just rebounding, Nathan with his gap defence. A whole team performance.” said Tom.\n\nThe victory takes Manchester Magic’s tally to 12 U16 National Cup titles, the most in the competition’s history.\n\nBridgewater Forest School unveiled\n\nBridgewater School is excited to introduce Bridgewater Forest School, an initiative designed to infuse the principles of play and exploration into the core of our child-centred philosophy. More than just a learning environment, Forest School represents a transformative journey for our pupils, fostering holistic development and a deeper connection with the natural world.\n\nThe outdoor curriculum is thoughtfully crafted to enhance students’ problem-solving skills, practical know-how and overall confidence. These attributes seamlessly translate into success within the classroom and set the stage for achievement in all aspects of school life.\n\nThe Prep Department is excited about the transformative potential of this outdoor curriculum, with Forest School Leader, Mr Connolly, emphasising: “Bridgewater Forest School represents an innovative approach to education, encouraging pupils to explore, discover and grow in a natural setting.”\n\nPrep children are now set to embark on a variety of exhilarating outdoor activities and ventures at the newly unveiled Forest School site, strategically located within school grounds. This carefully planned space ensures a safe, yet adventurous setting for pupils to thrive, fostering a love for learning that goes hand in hand with nature.\n\nUnited States History Trip 2024\n\nAt Bridgewater School we believe that History is not just a subject, it is a living, breathing narrative that shapes our present and guides our future. To enrich our students’ understanding and energise their learning, the History Department is delighted to reintroduce the United States History Trip for 2024. Proposed dates 17th – 23rd November.\n\nThis immersive trip is open to GCSE and A Level historians, offering a unique opportunity to explore iconic sites in Washington DC and New York. The itinerary is carefully crafted to provide a comprehensive historical perspective while allowing students to journey through history in-situ.\n\nWashington DC highlights (3 days)\n\nJefferson Memorial\n\nThe White House\n\nNational Mall\n\nHolocaust Museum\n\nFord’s Theatre\n\nCongress – the seat of American government.\n\nNew York exploration (4 days)\n\nEmpire State Building\n\nGrand Central Station\n\nBroadway\n\nWall Street\n\nStatue of Liberty\n\nNational September 11 Memorial\n\nHistory is a popular option at both GCSE and A Level at Bridgewater, with a curriculum that delves into a vast array of subjects. Noteworthy topics include a depth study of USA in the 20th Century, the American Revolution and Civil Rights in the USA.\n\nSpaces for this transformative trip are limited and we encourage interested parents to secure a place for their son or daughter. Priority will be given to Year 10, 11 and Sixth Form historians, but may be opened up to Year 9 students who will go on to study History in the new academic year. A non-returnable deposit is required by 20th February 2024. Flexible finance plans are available. For further information, please contact Mr Lyons at lyonsp@bwslive.co.uk\n\nCelebrating creativity in Prep\n\nTo mark the start of the Spring term, the incredible artwork of our Prep children was showcased in a Winter Art Exhibition that demonstrated not only the creative skill of our youngest pupils but also the joy of self-expression. From Kindergarten through to Prep VI, every pupil contributed to this vibrant display and it was heart-warming to see the enthusiasm and dedication our young artists poured into their masterpieces.\n\nThe seasonal ‘Art to Start’ exhibition served as a fabulous start to the new year, transforming the Prep Hall into a gallery of imagination and creativity and providing an opportunity for parents and staff to celebrate the children’s efforts and appreciate the emerging talent within our school community.\n\nA special thank you to Mrs Chilton and Mrs Rooney for making this initiative a resounding success.\n\n2025 School Ski Trip to Vermont\n\nAs part of our holistic enrichment programme, the Senior School Ski Trip provides students with an unforgettable opportunity for travel and personal development. Following the success of previous years we will return to the USA in March 2025, travelling to the resort of Killington, Vermont with specialist tour operators True North Travel.\n\n“Killington has long been a favourite with UK school groups and there’s a good reason for that. New England’s largest resort spans 6 mountains, has an unrivalled beginner programme and dedicated learning zones. With 155 trails Killington offers so much choice from wide groomed cruisers, narrow classic New England runs, Moguls and Steeps. High annual snowfall and extensive snowmaking makes Killington snow-sure throughout the season.” Review by True North Travel.\n\nStudents will have five days of skiing with five hours of tuition each day. There will also be an opportunity for a snowboarding group, subject to numbers.\n\nThe proposed date for departure is Saturday 29th March 2025, flying from Manchester Airport and returning seven days later. Exact timings will be confirmed nearer to the date.\n\nThe trip is open to students in Years 8-13 (at time of departure) and a deposit is required to secure your child’s place. Flexible payment plans available. Please email Mr Amin at aminw@bwslive.co.uk, for further information.\n\nLiberation and Freedom Workshop\n\nWe are extremely proud to announce our participation in the National Lottery Heritage Fund project ‘Liberation and Freedom‘ – a poignant Holocaust education workshop aimed at fostering understanding and remembrance among school students. Bridgewater was selected as one of 12 schools within Greater Manchester to be part of this powerful initiative.\n\nLed by Hannah Goldstone, Chair of Yom HaShoah Manchester and granddaughter of Holocaust survivor, Martin Wertheim, along with Caroline Slifkin, an experienced Holocaust Educator specialising in teaching about the Holocaust through art, the workshop provided a unique and personal insight into the historical events.\n\nA select group of Year 9 Bridgewater students had the privilege of hearing Hannah Goldstone share her personal memories of her grandfather, providing a first-hand account of pre-war Jewish life, the atrocities of the Holocaust and its aftermath. This personal narrative added a profound layer to the students’ understanding of the historical context.\n\nHelping develop the students’ visual literacy, Caroline Slifkin delved into the use of art as a means of depicting the complex topic of liberation, exploring the perspectives of Holocaust survivors, liberators and official war artists. By integrating the arts into the educational experience, students were encouraged to express their thoughts and responses to the emotionally charged subject matter in a sensitive and creative manner.\n\nThe culmination of the workshop will be showcased at the Manchester Yom HaShoah event at the prestigious Bridgewater Hall on May 7th, 2024. The artwork created by Bridgewater School students will not only contribute to the broader conversation around Holocaust remembrance, but also stand as a testament to the power of education and artistic expression in fostering empathy and understanding.\n\nMs Hemmings, Head of Religious Studies, expressed the significance of the workshop, stating, “Holocaust education is a crucial component of our commitment to fostering empathy and understanding. The ‘Liberation and Freedom’ workshop provided our students with a unique and personal connection to this important chapter in history.”\n\nA symphony of success\n\nIn the symphony of education at Bridgewater, music takes centre stage, harmonising the minds and hearts of students as they achieve remarkable milestones in their musical journey.\n\nIn addition to their participation in various musical activities, we are proud to recognise the achievements of students who undertook 2023 ABRSM (The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music) examinations:\n\nDavid Adebanjo: Grade 2 Piano, Merit\n\nHari Basu: Grade 7 Piano, Merit\n\nIsabelle Harrison: Grade 1 Clarinet, Distinction\n\nIsla Mameja: Grade 1 Clarinet, Distinction\n\nTobias Mason: Grade 3 Piano, Distinction\n\nSasha Viljoen: Grade 2 Clarinet, Merit\n\nThese exams are a testament to the students’ dedication and passion for music, and we celebrate their progress as they continue to inspire and challenge themselves in the world of music.\n\nThe above recognises those certifications awarded through the school music programme. We also offer our warmest congratulations to all students on their individual accomplishments achieved privately.\n\nOver £30,000 raised for St Ann’s Hospice\n\nAs a school we pride ourselves on our dedication to community engagement and charitable initiatives, so we are delighted to announce that our fundraising efforts for St. Ann’s Hospice have now surpassed an outstanding £30,000.\n\nThe remarkable milestone was celebrated with the presentation of a £2,000+ cheque to Community Fundraiser Greg Kelly and Advanced Nurse Practitioner Sara Cox of the St. Ann’s Hospice team. The donation represents the culmination of funds raised through the school’s recent Music Showcase, Sponsored 5K and Murder Mystery evening. These events, part of our ongoing support for St. Ann’s New Hospice Appeal, brought together students and staff inspired by a collective commitment to making a positive impact in the lives of others.\n\nSt. Ann’s Hospice holds a special place among the school’s chosen charities, with our Bridgewater School community supporting the hospice for many years. The total funds raised for St. Ann’s now stand at an impressive £31,600 and the school is immensely proud of its role in helping the charity achieve its purpose of providing care and support to people living with or affected by life-limiting illnesses.\n\nGreg Kelly, Community Fundraiser for St. Ann’s Hospice, expressed his gratitude: “Bridgewater School has been a strong supporter of St. Ann’s Hospice for many years, and have raised over £30,000, which is an incredible amount. This has helped St. Ann’s Hospice provide care to thousands of people across Greater Manchester, and we are incredibly grateful for the continued support of the school.”\n\nWood Street Mission Gift Appeal\n\nEvery child deserves a magical Christmas, regardless of circumstance. That is why we are once again proud to support Wood Street Mission with their Christmas Gift Appeal. We are reaching out to our community to join us in giving local children from struggling families a happy and memorable Christmas.\n\nFrom Tuesday 7th November until Monday 4th December 2023, we will be collecting new, unwrapped toys, gifts or books, suitable for children and young people aged 0-14 years.

Having won two games and drawn three, the Bridgewater side came out on top against schools from Irlam, Oasis, Buile Hill and Salford City Academy.\n\nSports Department match report:\n\nAll members of the team played their part in the success. Leo was spectacular in goal and Arthur marshalled the backline with authority whilst aided by the tough tackling of Ethan and Charlie. Yusuf sprayed the ball about the middle of the field, whilst Jody did not let any of the opposition settle on the ball. They were deftly helped by Toby who showed excellent control when put under pressure. However, no game of football can be won without somebody having an eye for goal and Harry, Lucas and Frankie all kept their team ahead, putting the ball in the back of the net.\n\nWell done boys, a great team effort.\n\nCelebrating musical mastery\n\nAt Bridgewater we celebrate not just the accomplishments of our students, but also the remarkable achievements of our dedicated staff. We are therefore thrilled to share the news of our very own Director of Music, Mrs Embrey, who recently undertook the personal challenge of a Grade 8 Piano examination.\n\nPredominantly a woodwind instrumentalist, Mrs Embrey had previously earned Grade 6 Jazz Saxophone and Grade 8 Clarinet awards, but had always fostered plans to continue her learning and developing her skills in order to master the highest level of piano proficiency.\n\nOur school ethos centres around fostering focus, drive and passion in our students and Mrs Embrey embodies these principles wholeheartedly. The Grade 8 Piano examination demands countless hours of practise, mastery of diverse pieces, scales and arpeggios, as well as challenges in sight reading and aural tests. Mrs Embrey’s success, achieving a Merit, is a testament to her unwavering dedication and exceptional commitment and serves as an inspiration to her students.\n\nA fantastic achievement.\n\nChampioning fitness and fundraising\n\nWe are thrilled to share the incredible efforts and achievements of our pupils as they once again dedicated their time and energy to support BBC Children in Need.\n\nNovember was filled with enthusiasm and compassion as the Prep Department embraced the Pudsey Bearpees Challenge, a spirited initiative devised by none other than Joe Wickes. Throughout the month, Bridgewater children united in their classes to take on the Bearpees fitness challenge. This engaging and inclusive activity encouraged every pupil to enhance their fitness levels while raising vital donations for BBC Children in Need who provide essential support to children and young people across the UK. Special congratulations go to our Prep IV children who emerged triumphant in the in-school challenge by completing an impressive total of 490 Bearpees!\n\nInspiration knows no bounds at Bridgewater and it was heartening to witness many of our children feeling inspired to put their energies into additional fundraising activities for the charity. On Sunday 19th November, Edie (Prep III), Beatrice (Prep V) and Emily (Prep VI) showcased their talents and commitment by participating in the annual Tapathon event alongside their dance group from the Miss Joanne Farnell School of Dancing. The Tapathon is a nationwide tap-dancing event with a dual purpose – to raise funds for BBC Children in Need and to attempt to set a new Guinness World Record by uniting tap dancers across the country.\n\nBridgewater School extends a huge thank you to all our pupils, parents and staff who played a part in fundraising activities for BBC Children in Need. Your dedication to fitness, fun and fundraising has not only improved the wellbeing of our school community, but has also made a positive impact on the lives of other children and young people.\n\nArtist of the Month October 2023\n\nIn recognition of the exciting work being produced by our students in the Art Room, each month students from each year group who have demonstrated exceptional skill and creativity, will be awarded ‘Artist of the Month’ and their work proudly showcased.\n\nPlease join us in celebrating the artistic achievements of the following students for their efforts in September and October 2023:\n\nYear 7\n\nYusuf Ahmed\n\nFelicity Banks\n\nLeo Fleming\n\nHenry Hunting\n\nSasha Viljoen\n\nYear 8\n\nJuliette Ahamed\n\nLucy Campbell\n\nDonya Hedayati\n\nAlexa Milho\n\nAvalyn Parker\n\nEllie Whittle\n\nYear 9\n\nKate Birch\n\nGabrielle Brownbill\n\nMiranda Lee\n\nLucy Smith\n\nSebastian Swindells\n\nKelly Yau\n\nYear 10\n\nIsabella Alldred\n\nHannah Denton\n\nElla Fletcher\n\nFavour Odemayowa\n\nSherine Thorpe\n\nEnrichment at Rock and River\n\nOur Year 11 students recently embarked on a thrilling expedition to Rock and River, an outdoor pursuits centre nestled in the countryside of Mawdesley, Lancashire. The trip, organised for the autumn term, provided a valuable opportunity for students to develop skills necessary for their academic and personal growth; essential as they approach their upcoming external exams later this year.\n\nAt Bridgewater, we believe that outdoor learning and experiences are an integral part of students’ learning and development, and the Rock and River trip provided a unique platform for our Year 11 students to not only test their physical and mental boundaries, but also foster camaraderie and make lasting memories. Students engaged in a variety of adventure activities, designed to help cultivate resilience, perseverance, teamwork and mutual support. Furthermore, the experience provided a setting for students to refine their communication, interaction and social skills. Such enriching experiences outside the traditional academic sphere play a vital role in shaping well-rounded and resilient individuals.\n\nEvie Williams, a Year 11 student, shared her experience of the Rock and River trip. “The Year 11 Rock and River trip has been amazing,” she exclaimed. Despite not having an overnight stay this time, the activities offered ample excitement. Evie mentioned that the zip line and high ropes challenged her fears, while the water challenge was particularly epic, leading to everyone to willingly embrace the fun – jumping in and getting a little dirty! “Overall, it was amazing, and I’m so glad I spent this time with my friends.”\n\nCelebrating digital aptitude\n\nWe are delighted to celebrate the achievements of a group of talented students who have been awarded their iDEA Bronze Awards. The Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award, known as iDEA, is an internationally acclaimed programme designed to assist young individuals in cultivating digital, enterprise and employability skills. Comparable to the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme in its aspiration, iDEA aims to empower young people with essential digital skills.\n\nThese accomplished students, in conjunction with their Year 8 studies, have exemplified an exceptional commitment to advancing their ICT skills, successfully earning their Bronze Award through the completion of a series of interactive, online modules or ‘badges’. These badges cover a range of topics such as Online Safety, Resolution, and User Interfaces, allowing participants to unlock new opportunities and obtain industry-recognised awards.\n\nThe following recipients have demonstrated admirable independence and determination in achieving this recognition. The skills and knowledge acquired will not only aid them in various subjects, but also equip them with capabilities applicable beyond the classroom. Their efforts serve as an inspiration to their peers, showcasing the value of dedication and persistence in the pursuit of digital literacy and excellence.\n\nCongratulations to:\n\nShayan Arbab\n\nLuca Barooah\n\nSebastian Barooah\n\nKate Birch\n\nJasmine Carroll\n\nJoshua Devine\n\nNathaniel Ellison\n\nElla Goodall\n\nTerrence Ip\n\nDexter Kenny\n\nHong Lam Kwan\n\nRyan Leigh\n\nRomeo Ndhlovana\n\nAshton Porter\n\nLouis Salvini\n\nMolly Torkington\n\nKelly Yau\n\nDiscovering new horizons. DofE Awards\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh’s (DofE) Award Scheme is not just a programme, it is an opportunity for students to challenge themselves, build teamwork and leadership skills and, most importantly, have a lot of fun. With three progressive award levels – Bronze, Silver and Gold – the scheme offers students an array of opportunities. We are therefore delighted that so many of our students are embracing the world’s premier youth achievement award, pushing their personal boundaries, acquiring new skills and gaining an additional benefit to enhance their university applications through personal statements.\n\nBronze DofE Award\n\nOpen to Bridgewater students in Years 9 and 10, the Bronze Award Scheme comprises four sections:\n\nSkills\n\nVolunteering\n\nPhysical\n\nExpedition\n\nEach young person’s DofE programme is a personalised journey. They have the freedom to choose activities for each of the first three sections and the Bridgewater team is there to provide guidance and support.\n\nThe following students have achieved their Bronze DofE Awards for 2022-23:\n\nMoni Abioye\n\nBailey Castillo\n\nOliver Lythgoe\n\nDean Rabbani\n\nDaniel Stout\n\nEvie Williams\n\nDalia Yousif\n\nSilver DofE Award\n\nFor those who have achieved their Bronze Award, the Silver DofE Award takes the adventure to the next level. Requiring a longer commitment period for the Physical, Skills and Voluntary sections, participants undertake both a practice and qualifying expedition, exploring wild country within the UK. Just as with the Bronze Award, the Silver scheme allows participants to either continue established activities or explore entirely new ones.\n\nOur Silver Award 2022-24 cohort embarked on their practice cycling expedition in June 2023. They roamed through Dalbeattie and Mabie Forest in Dumfriesshire, braving rugged mountain biking trails, practising navigation, bike maintenance and the physical skills needed for their qualifying expedition during the 2024 Easter Holidays.\n\nWhole School Open Day 2023\n\nWhen it comes to finding the perfect learning environment for your child, it is as much about instinct as academic success and, here at Bridgewater, we truly believe that the best way to see why children are so happy here is to experience our school for yourself. This is why all journeys at our family-focused school begin with a personal visit.\n\nFrom our outstanding Early Years Foundation Stage onwards, our small class sizes and nurturing approach ensure that each child is known by their name and valued for who they truly are, with support and activities tailored to their needs. By combining exceptional tuition with close personal attention, each child has the time and space they need to succeed in Key Stages 1 and 2, before progressing on to the excellent programme of pastoral care and specialised support through Senior School into Sixth Form.\n\nTo get a true sense of how our holistic and refreshing approach could inspire your child, reserve your place on our Whole School Open Day taking place 10am – 2pm on Saturday 4th November 2023.\n\nClick here to register or call 0161 794 1463.\n\nUn voyage marquant for Year 8\n\nIn the early hours of October 16th 2023, the Year 8 students gathered with excitement for a memorable French trip that would combine fun and learning in equal measure.\n\nThe first destination in France was Nausicaa in Boulogne Sur Mer, known as the largest aquarium in Europe. Here, the students explored the mysteries of the five oceans and the profound impact humanity has had on these magnificent bodies of water. They had the opportunity to get up close and personal with aquatic life, stroking fish and observing penguins and seals.\n\nLeaving the aquarium behind, the students visited a French hypermarket offering a wide array of treats and gifts. Laden with bags filled with souvenirs, the group finally arrived at the Chateau which was to be their home for the next two nights. The students wasted no time in settling into their rooms, before embarking on a crepe-making lesson, a delectable introduction to French cuisine. After a full day, the students retired to their rooms to rest, ready for the activities that awaited them in the morning.\n\nThe following day the students began with a French breakfast of Pain au Chocolat, before setting off for Essex Farm. This World War I Commonwealth War Graves Commission burial ground near Ypres, Belgium, serves as a solemn reminder of the sacrifices made in the Great War. With the upmost respect and impeccable behaviour, the students paid their respects, with Braeden eloquently reciting John McCrae’s iconic poem, In Flanders Field, to the Year 8 cohort. The group’s next stop was Langemark, a German cemetary, where they observed the constrasting styles of remembrance.\n\nThe journey continued into Ypres, where the students visited a local chocolate shop, indulging in exquisite Belgian chocolate and haggling to purchase gifts at the best prices possible. Afterward, the group proceeded to Lijssenthoek Military Cemetary, the resting place of 10,755 WWI casualties. Here, the students had the opportunity to reflect upon the tremendous loss of life during the war and delve into the soldiers’ accounts in the visitor centre.\n\nReturning to the Chateau for tea, the evening took a lively turn with a silent disco, showcasing the incredible dance moves of Keith and Mrs Mason. As the group transitioned into Wednesday, they embarked on an early visit to a traditional French boulangerie, which had a history dating back 150 years. Here the students rolled up their sleeves, kneaded dough, and learned the art of French baking, all communicated to them in French. Harry stood out, impressing everyone with his proficiency in the French language.\n\nThe return journey was marked by a long drive, a delayed ferry, and a touch of rain. By 11pm, the students and staff found themselves back at school, tired but enriched by their unforgettable journey. This remarkable trip was a perfect blend of fun, learning and reflection, allowing the Year 8 students to create lasting memories while appreciating the history and culture of France and Belgium.\n\nResidential adventure at Condover Hall\n\nOur Year 7 students recently embarked on a three-day residential trip to Condover Hall, a journey filled with adventure, challenges and newfound friendship. The aim of this annual excursion was to foster camaraderie and deepen connections, and it was a resounding success.\n\nThe anticipation for this adventure was palpable and the excitement almost tangible. The journey began with a lovely (and very noisy) two-hour coach trip to Shrewsbury in the West Midlands, setting the stage for an unforgettable trip. Over the course of the three days students fully immersed themselves in a range of thrilling activities. These included archery, rock climbing, aerial trek, abseiling, Trapeez and Conquest. What made this experience even more special was that the activity groups mixed students from different tutor groups and primary schools. This set-up encouraged them to learn more about each other and forge new connections as the trip progressed.\n\nSome students emerged as natural leaders, offering support and encouragement to their peers when fear crept in. It was heartening to witness their fearlessness as they leaped from the Trapeez platform or controlled their own abseil from the highest tower. Moreover, the trip provided a perfect setting for students to conquer their fears, such as heights, and step out of their comfort zones.\n\nThe adventure did not end with daytime activities. Evening fun added to the sense of collaboration and unity with a talent show, songs around the campfire and an exciting game of giant Cluedo in the Manor House. The long exhilarating days left students exhausted and ready to drift into dreamland, satisfied and fulfilled.\n\nDuring their stay, students took on responsibilities that promoted independence. They were in charge of making beds, maintaining the tidiness of their dorms, and ensuring they were up and ready in time for breakfast. These tasks encouraged our Year 7s to take ownership and become more self-reliant. Each day, students were treated to nutritious meals that energised them for their adventures, ensuring they had the fuel needed for the day’s activities.\n\nThe journey was made all the more unforgettable thanks to the dedicated and skilled instructors who guided the students from start to finish, and their expertise, patience and enthusiasm contributed significantly to the students’ experience.\n\nAs the trip came to a close, each student was presented with a certificate in recognition of their achievements and the memories they created. With hearts full of excitement, they boarded the coach for the quieter journey back home.\n\nThe Year 7 Condover Hall trip was truly an adventure to remember, with students forming bonds that will last a lifetime and conquering challenges that will serve as a testament to their resilience. The pastoral team at Bridgewater is immensely proud of these new seniors and cannot wait to see what they will achieve next year.\n\nYear 9 visit Thackray Museum of Medicine\n\nReview by Kelly Yau, Year 9\n\n“On 12th October 2023, we had the opportunity to step into the past and experience 19th Century Britain at the incredible Thackray Museum of Medicine in Leeds. It was such an unforgettable experience! Upon entering the museum, I was immediately captivated by the stunning architecture and the colour virus-shaped pendant lights. As we made our way through the museum, we saw a variety of exhibits and interactive displays, from vintage surgical instruments to medical textbooks from different eras. It was fascinating to see the advances and progression in medicine over the years.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was watching the gruesome operations taking place in a 19th Century operating theatre before the discovery of anaesthetics. We saw a surgeon using a coping saw to cut off a girl’s leg! It was interesting to learn about the development of surgery and understand how pain, infection and blood loss in surgery have been solved.\n\nI especially enjoyed walking through the recreated grimy streets of Victorian Leeds (Disease Street). Here, we were taken back in time to the crowded and unsanitary living conditions of the era, allowing me to truly understand the challenges faced by the people of that time. We even saw an extremely realistic pig being slaughtered and a girl having her arm amputated with blood splattering everywhere. The smell and sight was so unbearable that my friends wanted to throw up the sandwich that they just finished!\n\nThere was one important figure in the museum, John Snow, about whom we had already learnt in History lessons. He was crucial to the development of anaesthesia and medical hygiene. Thanks to him we now know the importance of clean water! It was inspiring to learn about the dedication of scientists and the impact they had on the field of healthcare.\n\nLastly, we visited a souvenir shop where I bought a syringed-shaped pen!\n\nOur visit to the Thackray Museum was an enriching experience that helped us enhance our knowledge and further understand what we are studying in History!”\n\nMacmillan fundraising reaches £13,000\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning at Bridgewater School was, once again, a tremendous success, raising £1,075. This accomplishment now brings our total fundraising for Macmillan to over £13,000 – a remarkable milestone that would not have been possible without the unwavering support of our school community. Your contributions, whether through baking, participating or donating, have made a significant impact on our fundraising efforts. View the Macmillan Impact Report for Bridgewater School>\n\nAt Bridgewater we believe in the strength of collective giving. By coming together and generously contributing, we are able to make a tangible difference in the lives of those who rely on the invaluable services provided by Macmillan Cancer Support and it is heart-warming to know that our contributions play a small but important role in helping those living with cancer.\n\nThis year’s Coffee Morning held an extra layer of significance as it coincided with European Day of Languages. To commemorate this special day, we invited our creative students to bake something with a European theme. The response was not only mouth-watering but truly impressive. We would like to extend our congratulations to our talented winners: William, Poppy and Joe, whose culinary creations not only delighted our taste buds but also showcased the diversity of European cuisine. We also want to applaud our runners-up: Aqsa, Nathan, Izabella and Grace. Very well done.\n\nWhile we celebrate this wonderful achievement, we acknowledge that the need for support in the fight against cancer continues. The funds we raise play an essential role in helping Macmillan provide physical, financial and emotional support to those affected by cancer. So once again, thank you. We look forward to continuing our journey of support together, one coffee morning at a time.\n\nSporting highlights of 2022-23\n\nThe 2022-23 academic year was a thrilling one for sport, where our students not only honed their individual athletic skills but also continued to develop essential qualities like leadership, self-discipline, teamwork and communication.\n\nThe season kicked off with resounding success as Bridgewater teams celebrated victories in various competitions and specialist tournaments. Our Year 10 football team displayed remarkable passion and fortitude, stepping up a year group to compete in the ISA North U16 Football Tournament and emerging as regional champions. This triumph set the tone for the rest of the year.\n\nSporting spirit remained high, with our U10 touch rugby team securing back-to-back wins. The indoor athletics arena saw more gold as the Year 7 boys and girls claimed team titles, further highlighting the depth of talent within our sports programmes.\n\nThroughout the academic year, both Prep pupils and Senior students had opportunities to represent the school and showcase their talents. Pupils participated in prestigious events such as the ISA Swimming Gala, U11 Basketball Tournament, MUFC Emerging Talent events, ISA Dance Competition, AJIS Athletics and Salford Schools Cross Country.\n\nThe season also bore witness to some outstanding individual performances, notably at the ISA North Athletics Competition, where Bridgewater clinched a silver medal in the national final for the 200m event. Several students demonstrated their prowess at the national Cross Country competition by finishing in the top 10 at the ISA North qualifiers. Congratulations to Spencer Rigby-Partington, Regan Bradley and Jessica Weir, and Joachim Christensen who went on to achieve a top 15 position at the nationals in Nottingham.\n\nStrong team performances were a recurring theme throughout the year. Year 8 boys dominated in both the ISA and Salford Basketball Leagues, going unbeaten across the season. Our U13 girls’ football team tasted success in the Salford Schools league, and all the Bridgewater teams put on a strong showing in the Netball League. Congratulations to the Prep V boys’ football team who were awarded the Prep ‘Team of the Year’ award, and to Oliver Ciubotariu and Emily McManus, who were celebrated as Prep PE pupils of 2022-23. Special mentions must also be given to Ansgar and Aidan Leung, Romeo Ndhlovana, Molly Torkington and Ruby Wellens for their consistently outstanding efforts.\n\n50 50 Fundraising Raffle results 2023\n\nThank you to all those who participated in our 50 / 50 Fundraising Raffle for 2022-23.

An impressive number of all grades achieved scored A*-B and students will now embark on exciting journeys to prestigious institutions such as St Catherine’s College at the University of Oxford and Lancaster University to study Psychology, Politics Philosophy and Economics, and Computer Science, while Higher Level apprenticeships have also remained a popular choice. However, at Bridgewater we pride ourselves not only on our students’ results, but also on the close personal attention and one-to-one guidance they receive. It is this focus, together with the support of small tutor groups, that enables virtually every student to secure a place at their first choice university or higher level apprenticeship.\n\nIf you feel that you son or daughter would flourish in a more nurturing and individual environment, then we invite you to join us for our Sixth Form Open Evening between 6pm and 8pm on Thursday 12th October 2023 when you will have the opportunity to find out everything that Bridgewater Sixth Form has to offer and for us to give guidance and advice on the next best steps for your child.\n\nThe evening will commence with a short presentation at 6pm and will be followed by the opportunity to visit individual ‘subject stalls’ on a more informal basis, where teaching staff will be available to discuss decisions about A-level choices, alternative courses and future careers.\n\nFor further information, please email admin@bwslive.co.uk or call 0161 794 1463.\n\nPrep Council gives pupils a voice\n\nHere at Bridgewater, fostering student agency is a priority and the Prep Council is a dynamic embodiment of this commitment. The forum, available to pupils from Kindergarten through to Prep VI, provides an avenue for pupils to actively engage in their educational journey. It also provides a space where young minds can raise issues, discuss ideas and offer suggestions that resonate with their peers.\n\nOne of the most valuable aspects of the Prep Council is its ability to address real-world challenges faced by students. Whether it is supporting fellow pupils in the playground, enhancing classroom experiences, or providing assistance for challenges at home, the council plays a pivotal part.\n\nBeing a council member is more than just a role, it is a journey of personal growth and the skills involved in being an effective councillor are essential for any child. Effective communication, active listening, persuasive language, problem-solving and the art of compromise are all invaluable for their future endeavours.\n\nThe Prep Council also plays a vital role in nurturing the fundamental values of democracy within the school community. Through elections and decision-making processes, pupils learn about the principles of democracy, governance and civic responsibility, instilling these values from a young age.\n\nLast year’s council were especially active, organising a range of fundraising events that have left a lasting impact. Under the expert guidance of Mrs Pritchard, their efforts culminated in the spectacular ‘Bridgewater’s Got Talent’, showcasing the incredible talent within the school. Another noteworthy initiative was the successful petitioning for the planting of two fruit trees, an enduring testament to their commitment to positive change.\n\n3 in 10 GCSE results at highest level\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the disruptions of recent years, our students have once again demonstrated exceptional resilience and a determination to succeed, and the school is delighted to announce an outstanding performance in this year’s GCSE examinations, with almost one third of all grades achieved at the highest level.\n\nMr Barker, Deputy Head of the Senior School (Academic), expressed his pride at the students’ accomplishments, stating: “We are incredibly proud of these young individuals and their remarkable achievements. This cohort of students faced unprecedented challenges, with no allowances made in their grading for the disruptions they encountered. Yet, despite facing a stricter grading system than expected, they have not only adapted but have excelled in every measure.”\n\nThe school is also thrilled to celebrate the exceptional individual performances of Rumaysah Khan, Dalia Yousif, Jake Hughes and Moni Abioye. These students have achieved a stunning clean sweep of grades 9 to 7 in all subjects, amassing an impressive total of 23 grade 9s collectively.\n\nYear 10 students have also exceeded expectations with exceptional results in Statistics, achieving a 100% pass rate with nearly three quarters of all grades being at the higher level of 7 and above.\n\nThese results follow another perfect year of A Level passes for Sixth Formers at Bridgewater School, with Year 13 graduates now embarking on exciting journeys to some of the most prestigious universities across the country.\n\nFor those interested in discovering more about the unparalleled benefits of a Bridgewater education, the school welcomes visitors to its upcoming Open Events in the Autumn Term.\n\n2023 A Level results mark perfect pass rate\n\nCongratulations to our Sixth Form students who have achieved an outstanding milestone by securing another remarkable 100% pass rate in their 2023 A Level examinations. The results highlight the dedication and perseverance of these students and the entire Bridgewater community congratulates the Class of 2023 on a fantastic achievement.\n\nAs a school we take immense pride in celebrating this significant accomplishment, with success extending across a diverse range of A Level subjects and vocational BTEC courses. Despite the challenges posed by the national context, including a return to pre-pandemic grade boundaries and a reduction in top grades, these Year 13 students have demonstrated their resilience and true determination.\n\nMrs Hilton, Head of Sixth Form, said: “Of particular note is the fact that this cohort of students had never before experienced an external examination series, making their achievement even more commendable. With an impressive number of all grades falling within the A*-B range, our students’ dedication to their studies shines very brightly indeed.”\n\nStudents will now embark on exciting journeys to prestigious institutions such as St. Catherine’s College at the University of Oxford and Lancaster University, to study Psychology, Politics Philosophy and Economics, and Computer Science. Others are set to continue showcasing their talent through music production, performance and sound engineering degrees, while Higher Level apprenticeships and degrees in Mechanical and Civil Engineering have remained a popular choice. Regardless of their destination, a diverse array of degree courses awaits, truly exemplifying the unique and vibrant nature of Bridgewater’s student body.\n\nThe Sixth Form Department attributes its consistent success to the exceptional focus and care it dedicates to its students. Through small, intimate classes, a supportive network of tutor groups and personalised one-to-one guidance, it fosters an environment where every student’s potential can flourish. This nurturing approach has proven to be a cornerstone of our school’s educational philosophy, resulting in excellent pass rates, year after year.\n\nFor anyone wishing to learn more about the benefits of a Bridgewater Sixth Form education, visitors are invited to attend the Sixth Form Open Evening on Thursday 12th October 2023. Call 0161 794 1463 or email saundersc@bwslive.co.uk to register.\n\nStaff murder mystery evening\n\nAfter a long hibernation and by popular demand, we are delighted to announce the return of our staff murder play.

Either a librarian or a travel guide. I have always loved the sanctuary that a library provides, but being outdoors and exploring new places has always given me a buzz.”\n\nWhat is it that inspires you?\n\n“Wilderness areas that are untouched and people who overcome adversity, yet retain their sense of humour.”\n\nWhat would surprise others to know about you?\n\n“I have a qualification to teach Computer Science. (That should make quite a few people laugh!)”\n\nWhat is the best advise you can give to your students?\n\n“Believe in yourself, work hard and follow your dreams. And, most importantly, be happy.”\n\nWhat has been your greatest achievement?\n\n“Another tricky one. I was the first person in my family to go to university. Seeing so many of our students go on to study Geography or environmental courses at university. Hopefully some of them will help to save the planet!”\n\nHow will you look back at your time as Head of the Geography Department?\n\n“I will look back with amazement that the time has flown by so quickly, with joy at the many laughs we have shared along the way and with real appreciation for how lucky I have been to be part of the Bridgewater family.”\n\nWhat will you miss most?\n\n“My form class, my friends and colleagues and listening to the little ones singing when we are in room 49.”\n\nWhat does the future hold for you?\n\n“Hopefully two new knees and two new hips! More time outdoors exploring the ‘Wild Atlantic Way’ with my stylish new picnic basket (thank you) and teaching my granddaughter to swim.\n\nHuge thanks to everyone for their endless kindness and support. Slainte Gra Sonas.”\n\nUnforgettable evening at the Bridgewater Ball\n\nIn a glittering display of glamour and elegance, the very first Bridgewater Ball took centre stage in September 2022, with an opulent black-tie event that wove together art, music and celebration.\n\nFestivities commenced with a sparkling drinks reception held in the LS Lowry Gallery, a space adorned with the masterpieces of the globally acclaimed Salford artist. As guests mingled, the melodic tones of X-Factor finalist and proud Bridgewater parent, Sarah Whatmore, cast a harmonious spell over the gathering.\n\nFollowing this wonderful introduction, guests were then transported to the Compass Room which offered a breath-taking view of the iconic MediaCity. Here, an exquisite dinner unfolded, paired with the rhythm of dancing feet that echoed well into the early hours. The night was a true celebration, a testament to Bridgewater School’s more than 70 years of dedication to educational excellence.\n\nThroughout the evening, a very special figure took the stage as emcee – none other than Alan Keegan, the renowned voice of Manchester United. His resonant voice and charismatic presence added an extra layer of excitement to the proceedings, guiding guests through the night’s festivities with a touch of footballing glamour.\n\nA silent and live auction added to the air of anticipation, with guests vying for a treasure trove of prizes including a piece of local art history, an exclusive tailor-made West End theatre trip, rare items of signed memorabilia, and the ultimate VIP football experience at the ‘Theatre of Dreams’.\n\nAmidst the glitz and glamour, the event resounded with a deeper purpose. Not only did it mark a milestone in the school’s journey, but it also heralded a fresh chapter of development and progress for Bridgewater. As a charitable foundation, the school has steadfastly dedicated its resourced to nurturing young minds and fostering an environment of growth. This is an ethos still in place today and the school’s dedicated board of governors and management team all share an unwavering commitment to enhance the educational journey with enriched facilities and opportunities for every young individual.\n\nThe Bridgewater Ball could not have come to life without the generous sponsorship of esteemed partners including: Hunters Estate Agents, Beever & Struthers, Whittakers Schoolwear, Machin’s Event Hire, Mint People, GreenThumb, Lancashire DAF, Romac Logistics and Big Creative Events. Their contributions were instrumental in creating an unforgettable experience for all attendees.\n\nThe success of the evening radiated far beyond the beautiful surroundings and wonderful entertainment enjoyed, as the event culminated in a remarkable accomplishment. Through the collective spirit of giving, over £10,000 was raised – a testament to the profound impact of unity, celebration and shared purpose.\n\nView Bridgewater Ball image gallery>\n\nPrep pupil joins ISA Roll of Honour\n\nWe are thrilled to share the news of former Prep pupil Oliver’s induction into the prestigious ISA Maxwell Roll of Honour. This renowned prize celebrates the exceptional accomplishments of Year 6 students and commends their comprehensive contributions to both school and community life.\n\nOliver, who held prominent roles such as Prep Head Boy, Sport Captain, Head Gardener, and devoted member of the Prep Choir, has left an indelible mark on the Prep Department. His dedication and enthusiasm have resonated across various spheres of school activities, showcasing his remarkable versatility and commitment.\n\nA true renaissance student, Oliver has showcased his talents not only on the academic front, but also in arts and sports. He has graced the stage as a lead performer in numerous school productions and represented Bridgewater in an array of sports and musical endeavours. Oliver has been a vital asset to school quiz teams, demonstrating his acumen in general knowledge, science and maths competitions.\n\nOliver’s influence has extended beyond the classroom, as he actively participated in initiatives aimed at bettering the community. His pivotal role in the Prep Council underscores his leadership abilities, notably in spearheading fundraising initiatives and acting as a spokesperson for the school’s Anti-Bullying campaign. His altruistic nature shone further as he undertook a ‘double marathon’ fundraising challenge for the homeless charity Shelter, resulting in his well-deserved Blue Peter badge.\n\nMr Rooney, Head of the Prep Department, expressed his pride in Oliver’s journey: “The nomination for the Maxwell Prize stands as a testament to Oliver’s exceptional contributions, highlighting his positive influence on our school environment. Oliver’s induction into the ISA Maxwell Prize Roll of Honour not only recognises his achievements but also underscore the values of dedication, leadership and community engagement that lie at the core of our educational ethos. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Oliver on his nomination and eagerly anticipate the positive impact that he will continue to make as he embarks on the next phase of his journey as a Senior.”\n\nThe importance of residential trips\n\nResidential trips are key to promoting a strong sense of wellbeing here at Bridgewater School and form an integral part of our enrichment programme, providing new opportunities for learning and the development of key life skills. Supporting cultural enrichment and collective achievement, these experiences are tailored to build confidence, self-awareness and encourage resilience in all our students.\n\nMr Worthington, pastoral coordinator for Year 8, says: “We firmly believe that children benefit greatly from experiences away from the school environment itself. Residential trips provide a unique opportunity to expand students’ knowledge in new ways, broaden their horizons and deliver a fantastic opportunity for personal development.”\n\nThis holistic approach to education begins at an early age. Residential adventure trips are organised for pupils from the age of eight, with children given opportunities to participate in an array of activities and physical challenges away from the confines of the classroom, including climbing, tree top trekking, kayaking and bushcraft. As pupils develop and move onwards through the school, this approach continues with a programme of compulsory bonding trips designed to promote the benefits of taking controlled risks and the importance of teamwork. The programme also provides a valuable opportunity to further friendships and enhance the personal development of students alongside their peers.\n\nSeniors are also encouraged to participate in the Duke of Edinburgh scheme which is about setting personal challenges and pushing personal boundaries. The scheme is open to students from Year 9 and enables the building of traits like confidence, resilience and self-esteem, while developing essential skills for the future. Older students are also given exciting opportunities for wider travel each year with European sporting and cultural tours, international trips and expeditions organised by the pastoral team.\n\nNurturing future career paths\n\nWork experience is an integral part of our Career’s Programme for Seniors and Sixth Form students. This invaluable opportunity allows students to explore various career paths, gain practical insights into their chosen fields and develop crucial transferable skills. The school’s commitment to providing diverse placements during Work Experience Week ensures that students are well-prepared for their future endeavours, whether they plan to pursue university degrees or apprenticeship courses.\n\nYear 10 placements: a glimpse into the real world\n\nDuring Work Experience Week, Year 10 students embarked on placements in varied industries, ranging from healthcare to architecture and law. These placements exposed them to the real-world environment and helped them to understand the importance of difference career choices. Students had the chance to shadow professionals in hospitals, opticians, construction companies, healthcare infrastructure providers, architects, recruitment agencies and law firms. Additionally, some students had the unique opportunity to explore the world of technology at the NW Computer Museum.\n\nYear 12 super curricular visits and tailored work experience\n\nFor Year 12 students, the Work Experience Week took on a more tailored approach, aligning with their upcoming UCAS applications. Many students participated in super curricular visits, expanding their knowledge and research skills. Some visited Manchester Central Library, delving into academic research, while others explored Manchester’s engineering history at MOSI and the University of Manchester. Moreover, students with specific career interests had the chance to gain first-hand experience by observing law firm practices, surgical procedures in hospitals and working in pharmacies. The remaining Sixth Formers embarked on immersive work experience in television studios, discovering various aspects of the industry, including the costume department, production team and digital press office.\n\nThe feedback received from employers underscores the significance of Work Experience Week. Employers commended the students’ confidence, politeness and dedication to their assigned tasks. The exceptional behaviour and genuine interest displayed by the students left a lasting impression on the professionals they worked with and these students are now further equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in their future careers.\n\nAppreciation from The Palace\n\nOn 5th May 2023 the grounds of Drywood Hall provided the perfect backdrop for a grand garden party to celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III. The atmosphere was brimming with excitement as families gathered on the lawn to commemorate this historic occasion.\n\nThe event was filled with traditional festivities, including charming maypole dances which perfectly captured the spirit of unity and joyfulness. The garden party was further enlivened by captivating musical performances from talented Bridgewater students, with the audience treated to a diverse repertoire of songs ranging from popular tunes to patriotic anthems.\n\nTo continue the celebrations, a delectable street-party style afternoon tea was arranged in the Prep Hall. The room was adorned with regal decorations, with elegant crockery and vibrant floral centrepieces completing the scene. Guests indulged in an assortment of scrumptious treats including finger sandwiches, fresh fruit trifle and a variety of delicious cakes. Laughter and conversation filled the air as everyone savoured the delightful fare and shared in the jubilant atmosphere.\n\nAs part of the school’s Coronation celebrations, Prep IV pupils poured their creative energy into crafting stunning portraits of King Charles III. These heartfelt artworks symbolised the children’s respect for their new monarch and were sent to Buckingham Palace in the hope of being seen by members of the Royal Household. The school community was therefore ecstatic to receive a personal letter of thanks from King Charles III himself, expressing his deep appreciation for the thoughtful portraits and conveying his warmest wishes to all the pupils and staff here at Bridgewater School.\n\nThis special recognition from His Majesty has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on our pupils, reminding them of the significance of their contribution and the value of their artistic endeavours.\n\nBridgewater Colours introduced for Seniors\n\nIt gives us immense pleasure to introduce ‘Bridgewater Colours’, an award programme for the new academic year which acknowledges excellence, commitment and the positive representation of Bridgewater School within the local and wider community.\n\nAs a school we firmly believe in nurturing the holistic development of our students. While we pride ourselves on our exam success, we understand the importance of encouraging participation in extra-curricular activities and celebrating achievements beyond the classroom. These awards aim to do just that by honouring those students who have consistently demonstrated exceptional dedication and effort in various areas of school life.\n\nBridgewater Colours is designed to be fully inclusive and celebrate success across interests and disciplines, fostering a sense of pride and achievement among our student body and providing opportunities for pupils to thrive and flourish in different areas of interest. Colours will be awarded to students who have given up their own time to consistently represent our school externally in at least three areas that enrich the school community. These include such activities as the Music Showcase, Maths Challenge, school productions, chess tournaments, sports teams, Debate Challenge, ISA competitions and events, and voluntary fundraising efforts.\n\nColours will be awarded as follows:\n\nHalf Colours – Students at the end of Year 9 who have met the criteria through Key Stage 3\n\nFull Colours – Students at the end of Year 11 who have continued to meet the criteria throughout Key Stages 3 and 4. (For students joining in Year 10, Half Colours may be awarded at the end of Year 11, subject to meeting the criteria described above and Full Colours for those that go above and beyond).\n\nHalf Colours and Full Colours can still be achieved by students joining Bridgewater after Year 7, providing they meet the required criteria in each subsequent year.\n\nThroughout the academic year our dedicated staff members will closely observe and evaluate the performances, attitudes and commitment of our students. These awards will therefore not only highlight their individual achievements but also acknowledge their positive influence on the school community.\n\nCelebrating cultural heritage\n\nAs a culturally diverse school, we celebrate and embrace the diverse talents and passions of our students and think it wonderful to see our students invest in extra-curricular activities that honour their heritage and culture. We are therefore proud to highlight the outstanding achievements of Year 10 student Simran, whose dedication and talent have earned her a commendation at the prestigious Sangeetha Varsha Indian Classical Music event, showcasing her passion for Hindustani vocal classical singing.\n\nOn 25th June 2023, the annual Indian Classical Music showcase took place at St. Peter’s Assembly Rooms in Hale. Simran, a gifted vocalist, was invited to perform. Displaying her mastery of Hindustani classical singing, she delivered two captivating performances that left the audience enthralled and her talent and hard work were recognised and commended by the Deputy Mayor Councillor, Trafford (Amy White) and her Deputy Consort (Sarah Hooks).\n\nSimran’s passion for Indian classical music has been nurtured over the last six years at the renowned Madhu’s Indian Music & Arts School, a Manchester-based institution affiliated with the Tajore Dance, Music and Art Research Centre in India. Her dedication and commitment have led her to pursue a diploma and degree in ‘Shastriya Sangeet’ – the pursuit of Hindustani classical music.\n\nHindustani classical music, also known as North Indian classical music, has a rich tradition that originated in South Asia over 6,000 years ago. It is an art form that requires a high level of technical skill and poetic expression. The vocal soloist, like Simran, must perform intricate rhythmic musical patterns, showcasing a deep understanding of the music’s complexity.\n\nSimran’s parents are understandably filled with pride at their daughter’s achievements, saying:\n\n“As parents it gives us great pride to see our daughter’s solo performances on stage and appreciate the values instilled through the art of music, such as discipline and the relentless pursuit of self-improvement. We are grateful to the school for their role in supporting Simran’s academic ambitions alongside her musical journey and recognising the importance of nurturing all aspects of her development.”\n\nSalford Children’s Book Award 2023\n\nA fundamental aim of the English Department is to foster a life-long love of literature. Since March, Year 7 students at Bridgewater have been busily reading the six novels from the shortlisted authors for the Salford Children’s Book Award in their reading lessons in English, as well as in their own time.\n\nThe Book Award, designed to encourage young people to read for pleasure, culminated on the 28th June with the Award Ceremony, held at the New Adelphi Building at the University of Salford. The event offered our Year 7s the unique opportunity to ask the authors questions, gaining a fantastic insight into the creative process of being an author and hopefully inspiring their own literary ambitions.\n\nA group of students from each of the attending schools were invited to give a speech on one of the shortlisted novels. Ruby and Lauren chose to deliver their speech on the novel ‘Storm Horse’, by Jane Elson, which was then followed by a lively presentation from the author who went into further fascinating detail about her motivation and inspiration for writing the novel.\n\nAll our students enjoyed the thrill of the winner – Michael Mann’s ‘Ghostcloud’ – being revealed to the audience, followed by a book signing with the authors.\n\nA review of ‘Storm Horse‘\n\nDaniel Margate has two big problems. He hates reading. And he’s rubbish at running.\n\nSo when Daniel discovers that he is going to have to do not just one, but two, of his worst nightmares – reading and running – in a school competition, life couldn’t get much worse. That is, until he finds out that these events are going to be filmed on live television as part of the ‘Big Read Off’ competition.\n\nWhen letters and numbers move, life is difficult – even getting the right bus and getting to school on time can be a challenge. This is what life is like for Daniel. Daniel has dyslexia and is in the ‘Silver’ reading group, which everyone knows is the ‘worst’ group in the school. When the Silver group is selected to take part in the competition, it feels as if everything is stacked against him. But what seems like the worst thing imaginable for Daniel, in fact turns out to be the beginning of him overcoming his fears.\n\nDaniel has only ever read one book – his great-great-grandfather’s scrapbook, which Daniel views as his ‘most-sacred treasure’. The scrapbook is filled with letters his great-great-grandfather wrote to the famous horse Seabiscuit, who was deemed too small to be a racehorse but proved to the world that they were wrong. It is this story that gives Daniel hope that anything is possible.\n\nOne night, when reading the scrapbook, Daniel starts to hear a strange stamping and snorting and something almost magical happens. The following is an excerpt from the novel:\n\n‘A lightning flash lights up the window and there looking right at me, peeping through the forelock, is an eye and a flaring nostril. Scrambling down the straw bales, I run towards the door. Is it what I think it is? I dash to grab the door handle. The wind blows it open in my hand, knocking me backwards.\n\nAnother flash of lightning and under the dark sky and thunder clouds, galloping away, I make out the most beautiful white horse just before it disappears through the apple trees and vanishes on the wasteland.\n\n“My Storm Horse”, I whisper.\n\nWhat is a storm horse doing near the Beckenham Estate?\n\nThroughout the novel, Daniel forms a relationship with his storm horse, who he calls ‘Jammie Dodger’. It is through reading his scrapbook to Jammie Dodger, who doesn’t mind when he stumbles over his words, that Daniel begins to gain confidence. Inspired by his new friend, Daniel sets up the Secret Horse Society. When the Silver reading"
