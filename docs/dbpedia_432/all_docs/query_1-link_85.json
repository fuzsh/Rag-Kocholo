        "text": "REL: LATEST STORY – FIXTURES TO PONDER OVER (27/06/24)\n\nWe were told next season’s fixtures earlier than usual which was welcomed by those fixing dates for things like weddings and holidays. There are two points of interest on the fixture list concerning games against Llandovery and Pontypool who we play on consecutive Saturdays, which only happened in pre-league times if a Cup tie was involved. In February 1982 we were home to Cardiff in the Cup on the 13th and home again to them on the 20th. In between we won at Tredegar but lost both games to Cardiff who went on to win the Cup Final and top the Championship.\n\nOne reason given for the Christmas Derbies with Pontypool, 21 December away and 28 December at home, is to give both clubs the financial benefit of a Christmas Derby. A kind thought from those Up There that club Treasurers will approve of providing our Christmas is not white.\n\nOn the third game of the season we are home to Llandovery, nothing unusual in that but a week later we play them again on their ground which is an arrangement that would have shocked Fixture Secretaries of old. The reason? To add some intensity to the games. In recent years we have played the Drovers intensively in Premiership fixtures, the Cup and play-offs but the ‘double header’ is at the least interesting.\n\nA club is a busy community from the head coach to the youngsters who give towels to the hookers when they throw into a lineout, a major activity described by the best rugby commentator of them all, Bill McLaren, as a den of iniquity. Learning the tricks of the trade are the youth and junior teams and we are blessed with several of them. Our Youth XV began last season quietly but as coach Matthew Williams said, “Once we started believing in our potential we turned the corner.” Indeed they did with a spot in the top Dragons League playing strong opposition and ending the season well and reached the Dragon’s Plate Final at Rodney Parade facing the powerful Bargoed Youth. It was 10-10 at half-time, but the second half was ours ending with a 23-10 victory. A perfect end to a hard but productive season.\n\nPreparations for 2024/25 are encouraging, signings are too and soon the training on Cae Canol will begin, minds will be activated, limbs will be tested and the sessions will be watched by the usual crowd preparing for tension in the autumn and a green Christmas to end the year.\n\nREL\n\nBIG CHANGES FOR WELSH CLUBS (13/06/24)\n\nThere will be change in Welsh club rugby this year and not only for the Top Ten but clubs in a league to be known as the Community Premiership. Covering a wide area it consists of the top five of last season’s East and West Championships and Merthyr, Neath and Pontypridd. Clubs we regularly played in fixture freedom days are in the new League, Cross Keys, Bargoed, Newbridge and Cardiff Met who we regularly played from the time they were known as Cardiff College of Education then South Glamorgan Institute and UWIC and their present title when we played them in the Championship.\n\nFrom its early days the students at Cyncoed set high standards and produced some of Wales’s greatest players who gained valuable experience playing on famous grounds. On Wednesday 7th December 1966 they came to Ebbw Vale and lost 11-0 but won the hearts of the crowd who had the privilege of watching the two best scrum halves in Wales in opposition, Glyn Turner and Gareth Edwards.\n\nOne particular encounter with the Met was a Championship fixture in October 2012. We went to Cyncoed undefeated and firm favourites to keep it that way but the students had different ideas. They led 9-6 late in the second half but then fly-half Dan Haymond went off with a pulled hamstring and in a re-shuffle full-back Charlie Simpson, Irish and tricky when in possession, moved to No.10, dropped a goal and we won 12-9.\n\nIn that season we only lost twice, 29-30 at Whitland and having beaten Cardiff 16-11 in the Cup at Cardiff Arms Park lost at home in the next round to Pontypridd 22-23. Our 2012/13 Championship resulted in a 96% success rate and a typical side was the one that played Cardiff Met at home in April – Charlie Simpson; Wes Cunliffe, Polu Uhi; Adam Jones, Luke Davies; Josh Lewis, David Jones; Ross Jones, Mathew Williams, Robert Sevenoaks; Damien Hudd (capt.), Ashley Sweet; Gareth Williams, Ronnie Kynes, Spencer Gibson.\n\nThat’s a glimpse of the past, now our coaches and players will begin training for the most important and challenging season the club has committed itself to and create history of their own in Super Rygbi Cymru.\n\nREL\n\nCOMMITMENT BRINGS SUCCESS (15/05/24)\n\nThe final act of a good season will take place in June when the Awards Dinner will pack the clubhouse and honours are announced. The first Player of the Year award was in 1963 and it was won by Gordon Main, the next year by Len Dimmick and in 1965 by Denzil Williams, all props. In June 2024 many more awards will be presented and in July training will begin as Jason Strange & Co prepare for a new season in a new league with Elitist in its title.\n\nBefore last season Jason Strange declared “Success in rugby does not come without commitment on and off the field.” The commitment was total and it brought success not only in results but in the development of young players. We played 24 games in the Premiership winning 18 and losing 6. We beat five teams twice and every other team once.\n\nIt was a 75% success rate and we finished third in the Premiership table. We had a good start, in the first two months we won six of seven matches, one of them at home on a Thursday night against Llandovery already favourites to be champions. We won 25-17, the Drover’s first defeat, and headed west to Church Bank in January aiming for a double. We almost took the Drover’s ground record but in the dying minutes a straight penalty shot from 35 metres went wide of the posts and we lost 17-15.\n\nTwo of several tense tussles should be recalled. In December at Sardis Road Pontypridd led 20-5 at half-time but we staged an amazing comeback to win 26-25. On a wet Thursday night in April we went to Carmarthen Quins who it was said fielded six Scarlets. Our average age was 23, ten were under 21 and some were making their debuts but led by old soldiers the new recruits won 28-24. The emphasis has been on our youngsters but recruits have to be guided and led by experienced old soldiers and we have them too, their part in the last Premiership season was crucial.\n\nThe club is well served by the management, the coaches headed by Jason Strange, the players and their support team, those who work with our youth and juniors, an army of supporters and volunteers who carry out practical tasks at the ground. The entire club was committed and produced a season of satisfaction and development perfectly timed for the challenges awaiting us in the new Elitist League.\n\nREL\n\nGWENT CUP RUGBY – A KNOCK OUT (28/04/24)\n\nPlay off semi-finals are a modern version of Cup semi-finals reached after a series of Cup ties full of surprises like a club in the top division getting knocked out by one below it. When we were in Division One East we were not expected to topple a Premiership side on their own ground but that’s what we did on January 28th 2012 at Rodney Parade winning 26-13. That Cup victory was followed by others at home against Premiership sides Carmarthen Quins 14-6 and Swansea 25-19. The semi-final was against another Premiership team and a Western Valley Derby against Cross Keys. It was at Rodney Parade and Keys won the day by scoring two tries to our one in a 9-9 draw.\n\nOur team that played Newport in the January 2012 Cup tie in Rodney Parade gave what was described as an “excellent defensive performance, posed constant problems in attack with strength, control and aggression up front, and pace and power behind.” It was Charlie Simpson; Wes Cunliffe, Tristan Davies, Dan Deardon, Tom Macpherson; Dorian Jones, Gareth James; Ross Jones, Matthew Williams, Robert Sevenoaks; Damian Hudd (captain), Ashley Sweet; Nicky Coughlin, Ronnie Kynes, Ethan Matthews. Ready for action on the bench were Dan Goode, Ben Parry, Josh Powell, Cameron Reagan, Dai Jones, Dan Haymond, Aled James. Ross Jones, Wes Cunliffe and Gareth James scored tries, Dorian Jones converted one and kicked three penalty goals.\n\nIt was our fifth and last Cup tie with Newport, three of which were semi-finals. In 1977 we lost 7-3, in 1990 we won 44-10 and in 2001 lost 19-12. In 2003 we lost a Cup tie at home 41-20 a heavy defeat inflicted by a Newport side that included players from overseas like the great Percy Montgomery, Shane Howarth, Rod Snow and Simon Raiwalui. Of more local interest the Newport squad included players with Ebbw Vale connections, Mike Voyle, David Llewellyn and Jason Strange.\n\nIn the 1980/81 WRU Centenary there were 34 clubs in Gwent, more than any other WRU District. Six were in the Merit Table, Abertillery, Cross Keys, Ebbw Vale, Newport, Pontypool and Tredegar. That season five Gwent club players played for Wales and one was Welsh Player of the Year – Clive Burgess. Welsh rugby centred around clubs in those days, and the clubs never let Wales down.\n\nREL\n\nExtract from Ebbw Vale v Pontypool programme (18/04/24)\n\nA TALE OF TWO VALLEYS\n\nIt’s a long time since we hosted Pontypool in the Premiership, before their return this season we hadn’t played them since April 2010 when we won 22-12 having lost at The Park in December 14-9. Our season ended with relegation but the entire club, players, coaches, supporters and administrators rallied and after a spell in the 1st Division East we began the journey back to the top in the Championship where we again met Pontypool. In the 2012/13 season we won at home 55-8 and away 44-6 and in the following season won at home 33-10 and away 19-13. A home game on Saint David’s Day 2014 was the last until we lost 25-20 at Pontypool Park last November.\n\nThat 55-8 result in September 2012 was unusual for the fixture and the Ebbw Vale squad deserves a mention – Charlie Simpson; Wes Cunliffe, Josh Lewis, Polu Uhi, Dan Ajuwa; Dan Haymond, Josh Davies; Ross Jones, Matthew Williams (captain), Robert Sevenoaks; Rhys Clarke, Ashley Sweet; Cameron Regan, Ronny Kynes, Spencer Gibson. Sitting on the bench and keen to get called were Josh Powell. Johny Bowen, Andrew Mann, Chris Thomas, Will Owen. Nine tries were scored, five were converted and one of rugby’s Peter Pans Dan Haymond contributed fifteen points.\n\nTwo Western v Eastern Valley games will not be forgotten if only for the atrocious conditions they were played in. It poured with rain on a Wednesday evening in March 1979 but that didn’t deter the supporters of both sides. For Ebbw Valians leading by a meagre 3-0 at half-time having had the storm behind their team while playing to the beer meant certain defeat. But the scoreboard didn’t change and thanks to a mighty defence the final score was Ebbw Vale 3 Pontypool 0.\n\nConditions were also bad for a Cup tie at home to Pontypool on Saturday January 27th 1990 but despite the monsoon like weather a huge crowd packed the ground. There were so many golf brollies on the terrace it looked like a wet day in The Open in St. Andrews. It was the 5th round of the Schweppes Cup and was decided by penalty goals, four by Pooler full-back Matthew Silvas and three by Ebbw’s left wing Adrian Griffiths. Pontypool won 12-9 but the Rugby Annual for Wales noted, “Ebbw were unhappy with decisions that prevented tries by skipper Mark Thomas and wing Ian Jeffreys.” No TMOs then.\n\nREL\n\nPLAYING PLAY-OFFS (23/03/24)\n\nThere’s rather a nice song which begins, “The party’s over, it’s time to call it a day” which nine of the Premiership clubs will do shortly leaving four to ‘play off’ to decide who the league champions will be. We have experienced two play-off finals, in 2014/15 and 2015/16 both against Pontypridd who topped the table two seasons running. The 2014/15 season was a good one for Ebbw Vale and finished with a flourish that took us to second place in the Premiership 21 points behind Pontypridd and two points above Cross Keys who had beaten us twice but we won the semi-final play-off against them 27-20. That took us to Sardis Road and the final which we lost to Pontypridd 28-14 in what was described as a gargantuan tussle.\n\nThe 2015/16 season began well with three big wins over Bridgend, Newport and Neath but then we lost 50-0 in Llandovery. We recovered remarkably beating Cardiff 34-22 in the next game but the Premiership was like a minefield with Challenge Cup and Swalec Cup fixtures adding to the pressure. We finished third in the Premiership table three points behind Llandovery who we would play in the semi-final play-off.\n\nWe had beaten the Drovers 14-6 in the return Premiership game and laid the Church Bank bogey when it mattered most winning 20-16 in a game that would decide Pontypridd’s opponent in the final at Sardis Road which produced one of the club’s greatest performances, a 38-12 triumph for Damien and his men with tries by Ronny Kynes (2), David Williams (2) and Dan Haymond all but one converted by Dai Langdon.\n\nOur pack ensured victory and the importance of forward power still applies as the Six Nations showed. A comment in the Pontypridd match programme in May 2016 is worth repeating. “Men of Steel”. Talking of units within a team when you think of Ebbw Vale the first image that flashes into the mind is of those at the heart of the pack, captain Damien Hudd and his fellow lock Ashley Sweet.” The Band of Brothers that won in Pontypridd on that Sunday in May 2016 was Dan Haymond; David Williams, Nathan Preece, Adam Jones, Jared Rosser; Dai Langdon, Chris Thomas; Ross Jones, Matthew Williams, Gethin Robinson; Damien Hudd (captain), Ashley Sweet; Rhys Clarke, Ronny Kynes, Cameron Reg an. Replacements were Joe Franchi, Ian George, Rob Sevenoaks, Josh Jacas, Luke Crocker, Tom Edwards, Iain Smerdon, Harrison Keddie.\n\nREL\n\nWHEN NO. 8s WON CUP TIES. 29/02/24\n\nThose running our club never rest in or out of the season, they are always busy and in five years time will have the added task of staging our 150th Anniversary. Rugby club administration is more complex and time-consuming than it was in 1976 when we formed a committee that met monthly to prepare for the Centenary in 1979/1980.\n\nThe fixture list was increased to fifty-two matches that included a WRU President’s XV, Crawshay’s Welsh, and Romania making their first overseas tour. One significant change was ending the season in California instead of Cornwall with the three clubs we usually played down there coming to Ebbw Vale for the first time. A memorable season ended with a splendid Centenary Dinner in Crickhowell attended by representatives of every club we played.\n\nThe 2024 Premiership Cup is confined to thirteen clubs, in Round One in our Centenary season there were thirty-two and we were drawn away to Laugharne. With a strong pack and a dangerous back division of Wayne Bow; Neil Collins, Gary Lawrence, Ian Goslin, Chris Edwards; Richard Owen and Steve Lewis we were confident for they were fast, skilful and coached in the open game by master of the craft Arthur Lewis. But on Cup day it poured with rain, conditions were appalling and the game was confined to the packs.\n\nIt was the hardest of the Cup ties that afternoon with the lowest score, 3-0 to Ebbw Vale, a penalty goal calmly put over despite the conditions by No. 8 David Fryer in the 10th minute. Two seasons before in his usual casual mood he had got us through to the next round with a last minute penalty goal from wide out at Llandaff. One of the best uncapped players in Wales he was selected for the Welsh tour to North America in 1980 but suffered a neck injury in a match against Moseley and had to withdraw, a great disappointment for him and a loss to Welsh rugby.\n\nThe 2023/24 Premiership Cup is more limited and very different, gone are the shock results when minnows toppled the whales but it’s a welcome addition to the season. One thing is certain, Cup ties of the modern era will not be won by a No. 8 kicking a penalty goal from the touchline.\n\nREL\n\nTHE DAY WE DIDN’T LOSE TO TOULOUSE 13/02/24\n\nTwenty-five years ago rugby football was doing more for European Union than politicians ever could. French teams headed for the British Isles, rugby giants like Toulouse who came to Ebbw Vale in November 1998 for a European Cup match those who saw it will never forget. It was a disappointing time for Ebbw who finished fourth of the eight clubs in the Premier Division however we had gained a European Cup place and were drawn in a pool with Edinburgh, Ulster and Toulouse where we went first and suffered a 108-16 defeat. Toulouse expected to win the return fixture and gain home advantage in the quarter final against Ulster. It was not to be, Ebbw Vale won 19-11, a great performance by the Steelmen with Jason Strange converting a penalty try and kicking four penalty goals. The quarter-final would be at Ravenhill which prompted someone in Ulster to send us a ‘Thank You’ card.\n\nThe Ebbw Vale team, coached by Leigh Jones and Nigel Way, that toppled Toulouse was Siua Taumalola; Leyton Olson; Jonathan Hawker, Gareth Williams, David Manley; Jason Strange, David Llewellyn; Alun Phillips, Ryan Campbell, Andrew Metcalfe; Lee Banks, Kuli Faletau; Gareth Green, Ritchie Collins, Mark Jones (captain). Replacements – Iestyn Thomas, Gareth Mason, Nathan Budgett, Robbie Jones, Lennie Woodard.\n\nThe 1999/2000 European Shield tournament was also exciting, we won all our pool games against Connacht (32-9 & 42-19), Bucharest (58-7 & 43-7) and Toulon (21-19 & 56-26) and were drawn at home to London Irish in the quarter-final. Captained by Irish international full-back Connor O’Shea they didn’t score a try but won 21-20 thanks to left wing Jarrod Cunningham who kicked seven penalty goals. For Ebbw Siau Taumalolo and Jonathan Williams scored tries converted by Jason Strange who added two penalty goals. It was another mighty effort by the Steelmen that would have had a happy ending if Shaun Connor’s late drop goal had met with the approval of the French referee.\n\nTo quote a former player “we played some great games in the European Cup and Shield tournaments………….they gave players an opportunity to expand their experience and their horizons.” They still do for our regions who play teams from the Six Nations, Georgia and South Africa. And what of our clubs? They too could cross borders and play competitive rugby with their counter-parts elsewhere. It would create more interest in club rugby, benefit the players, broaden their experience and add variety to our season. Variety after all is the spice of life. REL\n\nExtracted from the Ebbw Vale v Neath match programme 27 January 2024\n\nCOMPETING AT THE GNOLL\n\nOne reason given for introducing league rugby to Wales in 1990 was to instil more competitiveness in the club game to give the Welsh side “the fitness, hardness and organisation that modern International rugby demands.” In fact a competitive edge already existed in local Derbies like Neath v Aberavon, Ebbw Vale v Abertillery and East v West clashes like ours at the The Gnoll that were always competitive. But leagues came to stay, Neath quickly adapted and were the first Premier Division champions winning a top prize of £23,000 which in today’s money is £65,000.\n\nOur 1982/83 fixture list was typical of pre-league times, 53 games, 32 wins, two draws and 19 losses. Coach Chris Padfield was at the end of a three year term, the captain was centre Steve Flynn and Phil Gardner announced his retirement. We finished 8th in the Welsh Club Championship three places above Neath whose former giant lock Brian Thomas became team manager and the captaincy was taken over by one of Wales’s best wings, Elgan Rees.\n\nThe first three months of the 82/3 season went well for us, 22 games, 19 wins, a draw and two away defeats at Bridgend and Oxford University. In November we went to the Gnoll and won a nail-biter 4-3. Those near the Ebbw Vale dressing room after the game will have heard Elgan Rees congratulate the winners, typical of a great player and gentleman.\n\nThe Ebbw try at The Gnoll was scored by No. 8 David Jones and the Neath penalty goal was kicked by their full-back Neale Harris. There was a welcome back to the Gnoll for our flanker Neil Robinson who had played for Neath Grammar School and occasionally for the All Blacks before going to Cardiff College of Education after which he joined Ebbw Vale and captained us four times in the Eighties. A month after the game at the Gnoll, Neil was one of eight Ebbw Vale players in the Monmouthshire side that beat Glamorgan in the Welsh Counties Cup final 24-7 at Maesteg. Also in the County team was a Swansea forward who qualified because he came from Blaina – Mike Ruddock.\n\nToday we host Neath for the first time since April 2019 when we clinched a Premiership double and have played them twice at The Gnoll this season in Cup and League. Welcome back old friends.\n\nREL\n\nWHEN GROUNDS WERE CROWDED 17/01/24\n\nOn Boxing Day 2023 Cardiff Rugby and the Dragons played a United Championship game at the Arms Park before a crowd of 12,000. On a Wednesday evening in September 1954 Ebbw Vale played Cardiff at the old Arms Park before a crowd of 20,000. It was our first game there and had added interest as both teams were undefeated. Ebbw Vale, Welsh Champions the previous season, had beaten Pontypridd, Glamorgan Wanderers, Llanelli and Exeter while Cardiff, who would be Welsh Champions in 1954/5, had beaten Cheltenham, Penarth, Pontypool, Bridgend, Coventry, Leicester and Aberavon. It was Cardiff who remained undefeated winning 6-0 with two penalty goals.\n\nThere were big crowds then and international tickets were more scarce than ever when Wales won the 1955 Championship. They beat Ireland, France and England, the latter with a penalty goal kicked by full-back Arthur Edwards (London Welsh and Army) who had begun playing rugby at Ebbw Vale Grammar School. Our only defeat was at Murrayfield where the Scots introduced a new wing, Arthur Smith (Cambridge University), who in later years played for us and worked in the steelworks.\n\nThroughout South Wales clubs drew crowds and attendance records were broken. The 20,000 at our game at the Arms Park was the biggest ever for a midweek fixture and there were 45,000 at the ground for a Cardiff v Newport encounter.\n\nThe programme for our first game at the Arms Park included a message from the Cardiff Supporter’s Club who welcomed the visitors adding they had arranged to “entertain 250 of their club this evening, and looked forward to a real Welsh after the match entertainment,” how times have changed on and off the field. It was just one of 46 fixtures in the 1954/55 season but was important enough to attract such a big crowd on a Wednesday evening. Seventy years later we still wonder how many of our supporters were among the 20,000 but what is certain is that Ebbw Vale was a quiet town that night.\n\nREL\n\nExtracted from the Ebbw Vale – Cardiff match programme 6 January 2024\n\nBONUS BALDERDASH !\n\nThe 1996/1997 season was influenced by HQ’s revision of the bonus system which was complex to say the least and as Rob Smith once our webmaster declared “might well have had Pythagoras puzzled.” It would certainly have confused Confucius.\n\nThe revision was as follows – “One point to be awarded to the winning team, or top scoring team in a drawn match, if they scored three tries more than their opponents. Two points would go to the winning team, or top try-getting side in a drawn game if they scored six tries more than their opponents. The losing team would obtain one point if they scored three or more tries or were within 15 points of the score of the winning team at the end. Calculators must be carried.”\n\nIt wasn’t calculators that were necessary at Ebbw Vale on Saint David’s Day 1997 but flasks of brandy. Cardiff coached by Terry Holmes and captained by Mike Hall were the visitors and they included David Young, Phil Booth, Owain Williams, Nigel Walker and Lee Jarvis who would make his presence felt.\n\nThe Ebbw Vale side was Lyndon Lewis; Ian Jeffreys, Jonathan Hawker, Mike Boys, Sean Marshall; Byron Hayward, David Llewellyn; Alun Phillips, Steve Jones, Duncan Bell; Dorian Medlicott, Jason Lillas; Paul Pook, Kingsley Jones (captain), Mark Jones. Replacements – Lee Banks, Malcolm Sibthorpe, Andrew Lamerton, Ben Watkins, Gareth Bisp, Gareth Williams.\n\nCardiff won 38-35 with a drop goal by Lee Jarvis thirty-five yards out in the final minute, our first home defeat in the league since 1995. We were awarded two penalty tries, two other tries were scored by both sides but it was the magic boots of Byron Hayward and Lee Jarvis dominated the tussle.\n\nIt was a great game but it was the bonus revision that the Western Mail headlined – It’s Bonus Balderdash” – and included post-match comments by Ebbw wing Ian Jeffreys who called the revision “absolutely crazy” and Cardiff coach Terry Holmes who suggested the WRU should “Scrap It.” They did, confusion ended and no-one took calculators to a game anymore.\n\nREL\n\nExtracted from the Ebbw Vale – Merthyr programme 23 December 2023\n\nTHE LAST ROUND-UP\n\nThis is our last home game in 2023, a year of activity in the world of rugby football and business as usual at clubs at senior and youth level. Christmas is a time for giving and offering thanks and this year we should acknowledge the WRU fixture fixer who gave us local Derbies on the first day of the season and on the day before Christmas Eve which made travel even easier than usual on our version of Route 66. Unless there are roadworks of course.\n\nChristmas can be a time of remembrance, of games past and players of character. We were fortunate in the 70s and 80s to have some who came from Merthyr, fine players like forwards Elwyn Jones, Malcolm Baker, Peter Morgan and Steve Jones, a wing Colin Thomas and full-back Wayne Bow.\n\nIn September 1978 we were home to Gloucester with seven English internationals, five in the pack. The Ebbw Vale side that won 18-9 was Wayne Bow; Neil Matthews, David Hussey, Ian Goslin, Russell Cole; Alan Rainbow, Nigel Osborne; Colin Williams, Jonathan Williams, Gareth Howls; Elwyn Jones, David Fryer; Phil Gardner, Clive Burgess, Paul Ringer.\n\nThe club was rebuilding in 1978/79 and led by Phil Gardner finished sixth out of nineteen in the Welsh Club Championship. Scrum-half Steve Lewis came back from Bath and scored 72 points and Wayne Bow in his first season ‘swooped’ for eight tries. Centre Ian Goslin, Clive Burgess and Paul Ringer played for Monmouthshire who lost to the All-Blacks who controversially beat a Wales side that went on to win the Triple Crown and Championship losing only to France by a single point.\n\nOn December 23rd 1978 we went to Hendy for a second round Cup tie which was played in atrocious conditions on a spare pitch because the regular field was frostbound. Before long so were the players but we won 4-0 thanks to a try by Clive Burgess, who drove over from a scrum near the Hendy line. Conditions worsened and the game ended with ten minutes left at Hendy’s request and Clive Norling’s final whistle was welcomed. Phil Gardner and his team recovered, wished all a Merry Christmas and sang carols on the way home. It’s December 23rd 2023 so we wish everyone a Merry Christmas and hope the day will end with our players singing carols before they go home.\n\nREL\n\nTaken from the Ebbw Vale v Carmarthen Quins match programme 16 December 2023\n\nFESTIVITIES WITH THE QUINS\n\nNine days before Christmas we begin the festivities with a game that ends the first half of a season that brought rugby nations to Europe and which has shown yet again that Welsh club rugby is important, enterprising and enjoyable. The Quins are the ideal visitors at Yuletide as they were in December 2004 when they came full of confidence they would get the double having begun the season with a 45-3 win over us.\n\nWhen we had the power to arrange our own fixtures and Christmas games were arranged with neighbours Abertillery and, occasionally, the Watsonians, we tried to be home over the Festive period. Then Leagues dictated who we would play, where and when but we didn’t complain in 2003/04 when seven of the eight fixtures in November and December were at home, six of which we won including one against the Quins.\n\nOn the 4th of December 2004 they led 17-9 at half-time. what was said in the home dressing room at half-time will never be known and would be un-printable but it was a different Vale side that came out. Jason Williams had kicked three first half penalty goals before the break, dropped a goal to spark the revival and converted tries by Byron Hayward and Kristian Owen. We won 26-17 but it was close throughout as most of our games with the Quins have been since we first played them at Carmarthen Park in February 2001.\n\nThe Ebbw Vale teamayward list will rise a few local eyebrows – Joel Griffin; Kristian Owen (captain), Matthew Griffiths, Jonathan Hawker, Andrew Bevan; Byron Hayward, Scott Headington; Lee Davies, Chris Thomas, Ben Coutts; Gareth Jones, Richard Aylett; Matthew Griffin, Phil Skillen, Manu Tuipulotu. Replacements were Chris Downes, Huw Sparkes, Rhys Bowen, Craig Cleaver, Rhodri Jones, Jason Williams, Daniel Phillips.\n\nTwo months later the rugby community in North Gwent followed Wales closer than usual because the coach was Mike Ruddock a native of Blaina who had coached Ebbw Vale. There were celebrations in both towns when Wales won their first Grand Slam for twenty-seven years. Mike was in charge of thirteen Welsh games, winning ten and losing to New Zealand, South Africa and only one Six Nations match at Twickenham. A local boy who made very good.\n\nREL\n\nExtracted from the Ebbw Vale v Cardiff match programme 9 December 2023\n\nCUP RUGBY IN WALES, HOW IT ALL BEGAN\n\nWhen the WRU decided to form a national Cup competition in 1971 there was opposition from some quarters who feared it would be too competitive and rough as a previous one had been long ago. There had been violence on and off the field so the Union ended the competition after the May 1914 Cup Final won by Aberavon who beat Blaina 10-0.\n\nCup rugby in Wales was revived in the 1971/72 season with sixty-two clubs taking part. Our first round game was at Vardre United where we won 40-10 while farther east Cardiff were defeating Pentyrch 29-7. It was the second round that caused concern and changed the tournament rules.\n\nWe played at Waunarlwydd and Pontypridd at Whitland and when full time was blown at both places the scores were level. There was no extra time so if both sides had the same number of tries or penalty goals the winner would be decided on the toss of a coin. The captains Dennis John of Pontypridd and Gareth Howls of Ebbw Vale both called successfully and their teams proceeded to the third round where we beat Maesteg 15-3, Pontypridd lost to Llanelli 18-4 while Cardiff were at Pontypool Park winning 10-3.\n\nCardiff were home in the fourth round against Cardiff College of Education who included internationals Roy Bergiers and John Bevan but Cardiff with Gareth Edwards won 7-6, a fine performance by the students who were down to fourteen players after 25 minutes due to injury. Our first Cup run ended at home to Neath who won 10-0 and then beat Cardiff 16-9 in the semi-final and Llanelli 15-9 in the final before 12,000.\n\nIn the 1971/72 Welsh Club Championship Cardiff finished fourth and Ebbw Vale sixth and Wales won the Five Nations but with Scotland did not play in Ireland due to the “Troubles.” The Canadians came on tour and lost 56-16 to Wales, Ebbw Vale centre Alan Tovey scoring one of ten tries. The season is best remembered by the introduction of the WRU Challenge Cup which was good for the game in Wales and brought clubs of all status together. Cup games with Cardiff began in the second season of the competition, 1972/73 when we played on their new ground for the first time, Cardiff winning 11-7. Since then we have lost three and won two Cup games against them in the old system that involved clubs from all parts and did Welsh rugby a world of good.\n\nREL\n\nExtracted from the Ebbw Vale v Swansea match programme 25th November 2023\n\nSWANSEA FLIER TURNED STEELMAN\n\nAlun Wyn Jones began his distinguished career at Bonymaen and paid tribute to the club last May when he captained the Barbarians against a World XV at Twickenham wearing Bonymaen, not Osprey, socks. He played 35 games for the All-Whites until regions provided players for the Wales team instead of clubs. The first international under the new system was a non-championship game with Ireland in Dublin in August 2003 and coming off the bench in that game was Huw Bennett a Osprey hooker born in Ebbw Vale who would play fifty more games for Wales.\n\nThe 2003/04 season brought regional rugby to the fore but the Premier League and Cup fixtures kept clubs busy. We played at St. Helen’s in November and won 24-23 but the All-Whites captained by No. 8 Richard Francis – and with a young Alun Wyn Jones on their bench – won the return in April 20-21. In that season we played Swansea three times and were home in the 6th round of the Konica Minolta Cup which we lost 42-34. Never in the Cup had we scored so many points but lost.\n\nOur link with rugby in Powys is strong and from that land of scrum and super scenery have come some of our best players, one of them a wing who played for Swansea against us in November 1987 and scored three tries. Ian Jeffreys joined us in March 1988 and scored a lot of tries wearing red, white and green. His father John had been in the centre for Swansea when they played the Australians in January 1958 and in September 1988 had the pleasure of seeing both his sons Ian and Mark on the wings for Ebbw Vale at Newbridge.\n\nIn the autumn of 1987 the American Eagles landed in Wales and played their first game against Breconshire who won 15-9. The County side was Mark Wyatt (Swansea); Brian Thomas (Ebbw Vale), Des Parry (Ebbw Vale), Alun Donovan (Cardiff), Ian Jeffreys (Swansea); Nicky Hunt (Tredegar), Gareth Jones (Ystradgynlais); Chris Jones (Swansea), Mark Roberts (Saracens), Jeremy Pugh (Neath, captain); Huw Richards (Neath), Nick Mabbit (Maesteg), Frank Jacas (Pontypool), Les Rutherwood (Ystradgynlais), Robert Stephens (Ebbw Vale). And who scored the only try of the match? Ian Jeffreys.\n\nREL\n\n12/11/23\n\nTHERE ARE CHANGES IN THE AIR\n\nA plan for a ten club top division in Welsh community rugby is a reminder of season 1997/98 when the Premiership consisted of eight teams, fourteen matches, eight wins and six defeats supplemented by varied ‘friendlies.’ Compensating that moderate record was our Welsh Cup adventure which ended at Ashton Gate, Bristol in the final with Llanelli. We lost but many consider that Ebbw Vale squad was one of our strongest and our semi-final against Newport at Sardis Road as our finest eighty minutes in Cup rugby.\n\nThe twenty-two in the final were Siua Taumalola; Alun Harriers, Jonathan Hawker, John Funnell, Lenny Woodard; Byron Hayward, David Llewellyn; Alun Phillips, Leyton Phillips, Mike Wilson; Chay Billen, Kuli Faletau; Richie Collins, Mark Jones, Kingsley Jones (captain). Replacements, Iestyn Thomas, Steve Jones, Lee Banks, Paul Pook, Gareth Bisp, Jason Strange. There were lots of internationals on view and top flight officials Clayton Thomas who refereed and Derek Bevan who ran the line.\n\nIt was the 27th Welsh Cup final which had been dominated by West Wales clubs, especially Llanelli. Only two Gwent clubs had won the final, Newport in 1977 and Pontypool in 1983. In the wider world Wales were rather off form losing in Wembley 51-0 to France and at Twickenham 60-28 to England. Not even 21st century coaches could have found an excuse for that but the lads rallied to beat Scotland in Wembley 19-13 and Ireland 30-21 in Dublin.\n\nThe next change in Welsh club rugby will reduce the top division from thirteen to ten clubs and we have responded positively and expressed interest in membership of a new Elite League. The Merit Table which some thought to be elitist consisted of eighteen clubs but was replaced in September 1990 by a WRU National League.\n\nIt was a season of discontent internationally, Wales suffering a whitewash for the first time and the touring All-Blacks added to the problem by beating six Welsh clubs and Wales 34-9. We finished last of the Five Nations but Welsh Youth’s win over England avoided another white wash while behind the top desk in HQ a new WRU Secretary sat, a former three-quarter who was born in Scunthorpe brought up in Trefil, played for Ebbw Vale and once for Wales – Denis Evans.\n\nREL\n\nExtracted from the Ebbw Vale – Bridgend match programme 28th October 2023\n\nA STEELMEN-RAVENS THRILLER\n\nMany gathered here today will declare that matches between Bridgend and Ebbw Vale have been exciting and enjoyable especially in the Floodlit Alliance era when only tries counted. Cup rugby also suited our clubs typified by an 8th round tie at home to Bridgend in March 1997. We had joined the competition in the 6th round winning 32-8 at Aberavon and Bridgend beating Newbridge 26-20 at the Brewery Field. In the next round we went to Newcastle Emlyn and won 43-0 while Bridgend tamed the Welsh Zebras in Treorchy winning 22-13.\n\nThere was Spring in the air and a stiff wind blew from Beaufort when the Raven’s fly-half Matthew Lewis converted a try by centre Lloyd Davies and landed three penalty goals to give his side a 16-3 half-time lead. Cometh the crisis cometh the man and who better when a comeback is called for than Byron Hayward who had kicked four penalty goals and with a few minutes of the game left found touch in the corner. We won the lineout and Steve jones, aka Spikey, the most formidable hooker in Wales took possession and powered over with the Vale behind him. His try was converted by Byron from wide out and we won 17-16 making it to the semi-final for the first time in twenty years. Steve who first played rugby in Cefn Coed was regarded by opponents with trepidation and had re-joined Ebbw Vale from Bridgend. His try led to the Western Mail headline, “Steve Sinks Bridgend.”\n\nOur team that memorable day was Gareth Bisp; Ian Jeffreys, Jonathan Hawker, Mike Boys, Sean Marshall; Byron Hayward, David Llewellyn; Alun Phillips, Steve Jones, Duncan Bell; Chay Billen, Jason Lilas; Kingsley Jones (captain), Paul Pook, John Williams. Replacements were Lyndon Lewis, Gareth Williams, Andrew Lamerton, Lee Banks, Dean Jones, Ben Watkins.\n\nIn the semi-final at the Arms Park we lost 26-15 to Swansea coached by Mike Ruddock. Ian Jeffreys and Alan Harries scored our tries one converted by Byron Hayward who added a penalty goal. The 1996/97 season had more downs than ups, we finished 7th in the top Division but got the double over Bridgend who were two places and one point above us. The Cup tie though was the highlight of our season, full of thrills and a credit to both teams. aywardH\n\nREL\n\nTHE AYSHA MOVE (19/10/23)\n\nThe North Gwent and Powys Coaches Forum meets regularly to discuss the game and coaching practices. At a recent meeting in Ebbw Vale the speaker was Mostyn Richards a former WRU Elite Performance Manager remembered by Ebbw Valians as the full-back who played a key role in the ‘Aysha Move’ which was a feature of our game in the successful Seventies. But what was it?\n\nOne who witnessed it many times explains, “Aysha was Arthur Lewis’s nickname. He had great hands and would delay his pass until the very last second. Allan Tovey his co-centre who was always a threat to the opposition would act as decoy and fullback Mostyn Richards who was quick over 25 yards would take the ball at pace between Arthur and Alan. It was revolutionary at the time and served us well.” Mostyn’s role was even headlined in the local newspaper in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders In September 1976 reporting Ebbw Vale’s 32-12 win – “Richards Rips Gala Apart!”\n\nThe Move was seen by a 20,000 crowd at St. Helen’s, Swansea on Saturday 27th March 1976 when Ebbw Vale played Llanelli in a Cup semi-final. John Billot reported that Ebbw took the lead “with a try by Neil Collins following probing approach work by centre Arthur Lewis and full-back Mostyn Richards.” The original Scarlets, most of them internationals, won the game 10-4 but it was the Aysha Move that is best remembered.\n\nThe teams that day were, Ebbw Vale – Mostyn Richards; Neil Collins, Arthur Lewis, Allan Tovey, Ian Evans; Gary Lawrence, Steve Lewis; Colin Williams, Gerwyn Williams, Gareth Howls; Bill Evans, Elwyn Jones; Phil Gardner (captain), Peter Evans, Graham Evans. The Llanelli side that went on to beat Swansea in the final was Clive Griffiths; John J Williams, Ray Gravell, Keri Coslett, David Nicholas; Phil Bennett, Selwyn Williams; Tony Crocker, Roy Thomas, Charles Thomas; Derek Quinnell, Phil May; Alan James, Hefin Jenkins, Gareth Jenkins. Our next fixture with Llanelli was in April 1977 at home, another low scoring contest which we won 7-3.\n\nIt was a style of rugby the Ebbw Vale side revelled in but to quote Jason Strange, “There are similarities in the current squad to past successful teams, working hard together and putting the team first.” We are moving in the right direction.\n\nREL\n\nExtracted from the match programme v Llandovery 12th October 2023\n\nDROVERS v STEELMEN – THRILLS GUARANTEED\n\nWe celebrated our return to the Premiership in September 2014 with a home game against Llandovery who we had first played in the Second Division in the 1992/93 season. We hoped for a win, the few neutrals present looked for entertainment and we got both. Like most encounters with the Drovers to come it was close and nail-biting, Ebbw Vale 30 Llandovery 29. A report of the game on Llandovery’s website generously stated, “The Drovers went down to the narrowest of defeats at Eugene Cross Park but the scoreline flattered them against newly promoted Ebbw Vale.” If they had converted a try with a minute left they would have won but it wasn’t to be.\n\nOur scribe wrote on the website, “An emotional day for Ebbw Vale saw them recording a stunning bonus point win over Llandovery at a highly charged Eugene Cross Park in a thrilling encounter.” Jason Strange was our head coach and called it a “fantastic battle between two good sides and a superb advertisement for the Premiership.”\n\nThe Ebbw Vale team was Dan Haymond; Wes Cunliffe, Nathan Preece, David Jones, Owen Williams; Ian Smerdon, Dai Jones; Ross Jones, Matthew Williams, Gethin Robinson; Damien Hudd (captain), Ashley Sweet; Cameron Regan, Ronny Kynes, Spencer Gibson. The Ebbw Vale scorers were tries by Wes Cunliffe, Ronny Kynes, Ashley Sweet and a penalty try, Ian Smerdon converting two of them and kicking two penalty goals.\n\nThat was in September 2014 and there was more drama produced by both clubs in the following season. After beating Bridgend, Newport and Neath we lost 50-0 at Church Bank but improved as the season progressed and in the return fixture in January 2016 won 14-6. In April also at home we lost to the Drovers 16-8 in the Swalec Cup which they went on to win and found ourselves back at Church Bank for the Premiership playoff semi-final which we won 20-16 after repelling persistent Drover pressure in the final quarter.\n\nFast forward to last season when we got double wins over Aberavon, Carmarthen Quins, Llanelli. Newport, Pontypridd and Swansea and conceded the double to Cardiff, Merthyr and Llandovery 23-20 at home and 20-15 away. Narrow wins for the Drovers who come tonight leading the Division with the Steelmen in second place. A good game is guaranteed.\n\nREL\n\nExtract from the Ebbw Vale v RGC match programme 30/9/23\n\nNORTH v SOUTH IN THE CUP\n\nRGC are fifteen years old and after playing in Division One East and the Championship were promoted to the Premiership in the 2016/17 season. Ceri Jones who is no stranger to Ebbw Vale is their coach and like others of that profession is used to close run contests. One nail-biter was in January 2018 at home to RGC in the Cup which we won 16-14. Two away Cup wins followed against Bridgend 21-18 and Bargoed 26-3 that took us to the semi-final at Pandy Park against Merthyr which we narrowly lost 10-6.\n\nOur Cup game with RGC in January 2018 followed a Premiership run of fifteen games with only four wins but the two before the Cup tie brought welcome relief with victories against Bedwas 33-17 and Llanelli 43-15. The Cup programme noted, “We are a transformed side to what we were in early December with Jason Strange and Ceri Jones having worked wonders in a short space of time to get the team playing with confidence again.”\n\nIn the RGC back division there was a Dion, Afon, Tom, Iolo and of special interest a Tiaan at inside centre and a Jacob at outside-half. Tiaan Loots was born in Cape Town and Jacob Botica in Wigan where his father, an All-Black, added to his fame playing rugby league. Tiaan and Jacob plied their trade in many places, Tiaan in the USA and Jacob in France and before going foreign they played for the Dragons and Jacob Botica played a few times for Ebbw Vale.\n\nOur side in the Cup game was Dan Haymond; Steffan Thomas, Dominic Franchi, Dai Langdon, Toby Fricker; Dorian Jones, Dai Jones; Ross jones, Rhys Francis, Josh James; Kristian Parker, Rhys Clarke; Cameron Regan, Ronny Kynes (capt), Lewis Young. Replacements. Matthew Williams, Ian George, Rob Sevenoaks, Benjamin Papp, Joe Franchi, Lewis Dennett, Srdan Majkic, Eli-Wyn Benham.\n\nThe Rugby World Cup brings together teams from all continents. At a much lower level in the late 1990s the WRU brought foreign clubs to Wales to compete for a Challenge Trophy. We played two clubs from Argentina and two from South Africa also teams representing their countries Romania and Namibia who we defeated 75-5. That was January 1998, the next year Namibia played in the World Cup and are now in their seventh. They are in Pool A playing Italy, Uruguay, France and New Zealand, a demanding way to spend autumn in France but much warmer than playing at the top of the Western Valley on a cold night in January. REL\n\nREL 18/09/23\n\nAN ENCOURAGING START\n\nTucked away in European rugby currently dominated by the World Cup in France where a memorable game between Wales and Fiji thrilled viewers and a forgettable game between Wales and Portugal did not, it has been business as usual for clubs. It’s far too early to judge our season but the first three fixtures were encouraging for coaches and enjoyable for supporters.\n\nFifteen points were there for the taking and we took eleven of them, a losing bonus point at Merthyr where the margin was seven points and two maximum winning bonus points home to Pontypridd and away to Cardiff where we won for the first time since May 13th 2018. The Franchi brothers were in that team which was captained by Ronnie Kynes. An away win is always an achievement but Ebbw Vale players feel at home anywhere thanks to their army of supporters who follow them everywhere and make their presence felt vocally.\n\nMany times in these notes mention has been made of times past when players were capped from clubs and were seen in club games. That ended in 2013 but ten years later in Nice against Portugal there were two with Ebbw Vale connections. Dan Lydiate first capped in 2009 who with his brother Jack played for us seventeen years ago and Taulupe Faletu whose father Kuli dominated opposing lineouts and every game he played for us.\n\nTaulupe came from Tonga to join his family at Ebbw Vale and attended Pontygof Infants School, a five-minute walk to the family home in our ground we called the Tongan Embassy. He played junior rugby with RTB Ebbw Vale and made his debut for Wales in the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand. It was against South Africa and he scored a try in the second half. He did it again in the 2023 World Cup in the game against Portugal and thanks to him Wales bagged a valuable bonus point.\n\nThe 2023 World Cup showed how dangerous it is to under-rate opponents outside the top tier. Back in days when the Welsh Cup embraced all clubs those in the Merit Table often came unstuck playing ‘minnows’ and there were shock results notably Penclawdd 4 Newport 0, Tondu 12 Ebbw Vale 6 and Cardiff 14 St. Peters 16 at the Arms Park. Our next fixture is a Cup tie and it’s at The Gnoll where apart from a pre-season friendly in August 2022 we last played competitively in September 2018 winning 25-17. Game four is not in the Premiership but it’s important.\n\nREL\n\nExtracted from the Ebbw Vale v Pontypridd match programme 9/9/23\n\nA PREMIER PERFORMANCE\n\nIn the 2012/13 season we were in the Championship and were drawn at home in a Cup quarter-final with Pontypridd who were in the Premiership. Even though we dominated our division there was no promotion because we were ring-fenced by the WRU’s version of the Iron Curtain. In the previous round we had beaten Cardiff 16-11 at the Arms Park on a pitch strangely sandy which got us into the quarter final with an added interest, both teams were on top of their divisions.\n\nThe Ebbw Vale side was Charlie Simpson; Wes Cunliffe, Polu Uhi, Adam Jones, Luke Davies; Josh Lewis, David Jones; Ross Jones, Matthew Williams, Robert Sevenoaks; Damien Hudd (captain), Ashley Sweet; Gareth Williams, Ronnie Kynes, Spencer Gibson with replacements John Lavender, Jonny Bowen, Joe Bartlett, Rhys Clark, Cameron Regan, Chris Thomas, Dan Haymond, Dan Ajuwa.\n\nWe were leading 22-16 and heading for the semi-final until a minute from time Ponty’s captain Chris Dicomidis scored a try in the corner that Dai Flanagan, who had replaced Humberstone in the 57th minute, expertly converted and the final score was Ebbw Vale 22 Pontypridd 23. The winning coach Dale McIntosh praised Ebbw Vale and said “they belong up in the Premiership there’s no doubt about it.”\n\nThe game was described in the press as magnificent and by our webmaster Robert Smith as “a Premier performance.” Scrum half David Jones from Blaina was Man of the Match and referee Sean Brickell from Abertillery was described by one reporter as being ‘outstanding.’ We only lost twice In the 2012/13 season, at Whitland in the Championship and home to Pontypridd in the Cup, each by a single point.\n\nWe had one more season in the Championship when the gate opened and in September 2014 we rejoined the Premiership and began the campaign in the right mood with a team used to winning under Damien Hudd in the fourth of his seven terms as captaincy, and coached by Jason Strange. We won 15 Premiership games, lost 7 and finished second in the table to Pontypridd who clinched the Premiership title when they beat us in the play-off at Sardis Road. A year later we played off there again and returned home happier.\n\nREL\n\nREL 09/08/2023\n\nTHE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF A GREAT PLAYER\n\nThere was quite a lot of rugby played in Ebbw Vale during the Second World War and in the 1940/41 season the team played and won thirty matches. When the war ended and normality returned to Welsh rugby Ebbw Vale had a team made up of players who had done essential work in the steelworks and collieries and others who returned from the Armed Forces. A first class set-up awaited them, a spacious ground and a determination to take the club to the top in Wales playing what had become a distinctive Ebbw Vale style of running rugby. Their effort was rewarded by winning the Welsh Championship four times from 1951/2 to 1959/60.\n\nIt was a great time for the backs and among them was Joseph Bernard Williams a wing known to his club mates as J B, a great character on and off the field who had captained Tredegar Grammar School’s rugby, cricket and athletics teams. After graduating in Mechanical Engineering at university in Cardiff he did his National Service in the Royal Signals where he played alongside the Welsh scrum-half Hadyn Tanner. After release he played a few games for Newport but joined Ebbw Vale in January 1948.\n\nThe 1953/54 campaign was a successful one for Ebbw Vale, captained by Ben Edwards they played 40 games, winning 30, drawing 4 and losing 6. The season was brightened by the All-Blacks who played thirty-two games in Britain, Ireland and France winning 26 including a 22-3 victory over a combined Abertillery/Ebbw Vale side a week after Wales beat them at the Arms Park, a feat they have not repeated.\n\nThere were seven Ebbw Vale players in the Combined XV, both wings J B and John Pugh who was vice-captain, hooker Albert Jackson, prop Len Coldrick, second rowers Len Harris and Ben Edwards and wing forward Horace Matthews. The All-Blacks side included eleven full internationals and Wilson the wing opposite J B would shortly be capped against England and Scotland.\n\nJ B Williams was a key figure in a great Ebbw Vale team that was generally selected from twenty players. He was one of Ebbw Vale’s finest, respected by his clubmates and greatly admired by the crowds who saw him. On August 14th he will be a hundred years of age and everyone at Ebbw Vale Rugby Football Club wishes him a very happy birthday.\n\nJB Williams seated second from the left\n\nTeam were the winners of the Welsh Championship 1953/54\n\nREL\n\n20/07/23\n\nSEASONS THAT KICKED OFF IN STYLE\n\nThe 2013/14 season was our last in the Championship and began with an away game with a difference, it was in North Wales where the WRU had created a new club, RGC, that had the good fortune to have Rupert Moon at the helm. In their programme he wrote “I have to pinch myself at the thought of welcoming the players and committee of such an illustrious club stepped in history as Ebbw Vale.” We responded with a 31-16 win with tries from Ronnie Kynes, Spencer Gibson and a penalty try boosted by Dan Haymond landing four penalty goals and two conversions.\n\nLed by the irrepressible Damien Hudd the Steelmen were in confident mood for the first home game of the season against Bargoed which we won 33-18 after being 13-8 down at half-time. Tries came from Jack Flower, Wes Cunliffe, Sion Jones and Joe Franchi, Ian Smerdon converting two, dropping a goal and kicking a penalty. Josh Prosser also landed a penalty and the scene was set for a season that would end with promotion. Man of the Match was Cameron Regan.\n\nJason Strange was our head coach in 2013/14 as he is today and comments in the match programme for the Bargoed game still apply – “Success in rugby does not come without commitment on and off the field. Whether taking part in vigorous pre-season training improving fitness and skills, focusing on the development of the match day game plan or an in-depth analysis of performance, all can provide that edge that keeps you ahead of the opposition. Even the smallest attention to detail can provide that one opportunity that will achieve victory.”\n\nOur return to the Premiership began in September 2014 at home against Llandovery that was a thriller we won 30-29 one of many close finishes with the Drovers and more entertaining than our first game with them in 1982. We were in the 2nd Division and travelled west to endure a game later described as being as tight as a club treasurer’s wallet. It was try-less and a 3-3 draw looked likely until our young outside-half, Jason Strange, dropped a cheeky goal and we won 6-3. After sampling the local brew we travelled east feeling satisfied and confident we had found a lad of considerable promise.\n\nREL\n\nREL 10/07/23\n\nFIXTURES GALORE\n\nIn September 1990 league rugby began in Wales and was welcomed by some but apprehensively by most. The 1990/91 fixture list was a strange one, a mix of forty-one games consisting of Division Two in the new league, the traditional Welsh Cup and ‘friendlies’ with Gloucester, Moseley, Bath and other regular opponents from pre-League days.\n\nThirty three years later we eagerly await a season of twenty-four Premiership fixtures and the Premiership Cup which cannot compare with the Welsh Cup we knew, an exciting competition in which we experienced rugby at its roots and were often very fortunate to emerge winners.\n\nLast season there were twelve clubs in the Premiership, in 2023/24 there will be thirteen not the expected fourteen. Pontypool and Neath rejoin but Llanelli formed in 1872 have opted out of the Premiership and presumably of the Union. Our journeys to Llanelli are over and no longer will our supporters sit in spacious Parc y Scarlets which has a capacity of 15,000.\n\nThe season’s fixtures have been published and are appetizing. There’s no easy game in the Premiership especially when it’s a local Derby which will open our season at The Wern in Merthyr on the first Saturday. The autumn will be a very busy time when we play Merthyr (a) Pontypridd (h), Cardiff (a) and RGC (h) in September and Llandovery (h), Neath (a) and Bridgend (h) in October. While all that is going on Wales will be playing Fiji, Portugal, Australia and Georgia in the Rugby World Cup in France.\n\nBack home we can expect good crowds when Neath and Pontypooi come after languishing in the Championship and also for the return game with Merthyr two days before Christmas. While we concentrate on the challenge every Premiership fixture offers, Matthew Williams will be arranging games for our Youth who did so well last year and those who organise and supervise the Juniors will swing into action. All volunteers, all supporting their club.\n\nEveryone looks forward to a new season, especially players who have joined us in the summer like Ben Main from Abergavenny whose grand-father Gordon was a prop of distinction and our first ever Player of the Year in 1963 and captain in 1968/69. There are fewer fixtures now, but the successors of Gordon Main’s era face an equally big challenge and one they will relish.\n\nREL\n\n22/06/23\n\nSUMMER OUTINGS WITH A PURPOSE\n\nNews of pre-season games has been particularly welcomed by those who remember regular fixtures with Newbridge and nerve-racking Derbies at Tredegar especially one in the third round of the 1983/84 Schweppes Challenge Cup. Having beaten Bangor 33-9 at home and Gowerton 19-13 away we prepared for the five mile journey to our neighbours where we had lost on New Year’s Eve 4-20. We recovered by winning at Saracens 16-12 at Maesteg 15-6 and home to Blaina 7-6 but in the Cup form did not count, anything can happen and it did at Tredegar on Sunday February 5th 1984.\n\nThe crowd was huge, noisy and totally biased as it always was in valley Derbies. The Ebbw Vale side was captained by No.8 Carl Dennehy, Tredegar by scrum-half Ian Lewis whose crew included Howard Dwyer, Nick Hunt, Syd Wharton and Frank Jacas. Nerves cracked, hearts pumped and peace came at last when the referee John Groves blew his whistle for no-side with the scoreboard showing Tredegar 9 Ebbw Vale 10.\n\nWe returned to the ground in January 2010 for a Cup tie against Llanelli because our ground was unplayable but it was never close, the Scarlets won comfortably. Our last game at Tredegar was in April 2012 which was not close either, 52-0.\n\nFor several seasons our first game was always against Newbridge a club with the same intent of playing adventurous ‘open’ rugby. In the closing stages of 2010/11 they were top of Division One East and we were just behind them. Everything depended on Ebbw winning at Bedlinog AND getting a bonus point. From the start we were clear winners but the fourth try eluded us until the pack was rewarded with a penalty try and we were champions. We played Newbridge in 1st Division East and the Championship and have followed them in their WRU East season which has brought them promotion. They only lost one of the 22 games, and that was against Brecon who finished second and are also promoted.\n\nIt will be a treat to go back to Tredegar’s ground for an all-Welsh rugby afternoon and a week later to cross the Severn and continue our summer warm-ups in Clifton one of the oldest clubs in English rugby. Pre-season games are important for players, coaches and supporters. This year they will make a short journey over the Severn an even shorter one to Tredegar, two summer outings to look forward to and each with a purpose. REL\n\n10/06/23\n\nTHE PROMISE OF YOUTH\n\nA Welsh Youth Rugby Union was formed in 1949 and it’s purpose was to get youngsters whose rugby ended when they left school to keep playing the game. Youth rugby would be run by clubs who also benefited when youngsters qualified as seniors. Two years after formation a Welsh Youth international team was created and played Youth and School teams in the four home countries and France. It created history in 1980 when they toured South Africa and beat Springbok Youth 30-25.\n\nEbbw Vale Youth did well in the Seventies reaching the final of the WRU Youth Cup in 1973, losing to Llanelli 27-3 but benefiting from the experience. A typical fixture list of the time was in 1974/76, thirty-five games including those home and away to Cardiff, Newport, Bristol, Neath, Pontypridd, Newbridge and Abertillery.\n\nLeague and then regional rugby changed the Welsh club game but in 2021/22 an Ebbw Vale Youth side was revived and in its second season played well and enjoyed every moment on and off the field. Coaches Matthew Williams (aka Chunky) and Richard Brown have created a team and imparted technical knowledge and experience of the highest order.\n\nSeveral players were selected for the regional Under 18s and two finals were reached. In the Welsh Cup second round they lost to the more experienced Tondu side and in the Gwent & Caerphilly District Cup Final which they lost to Abergavenny at Blackwood.\n\n“The objective of youth rugby” a club official says is the “development of players along the pathway to the Premiership. Optimisation of skills and talent to support the Ebbw Vale senior XV but also sustain players for the regional game and to ensure player sustainability for community teams within Blaenau Gwent.” In a very short time Ebbw Vale Youth have achieved that.\n\nThey follow in the footsteps of Denzil Williams, Byron Hayward, Ian Watkins, Jason Strange and many others who played in local youth teams. Their seniors enjoyed the 2022/23 season and so did they, now like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start they eagerly wait for 2023/24. Well supported and sponsored they are our future.\n\nREL\n\n03/06/23\n\nHONOURING THE STEELMEN\n\nA week after Denis Compton and his brother Leslie played football for Arsenal on the last Saturday in April they changed clobber and began playing cricket for Middlesex and England. Lower down the scale in the Ebbw Vale team there were several who hung up their boots and donned whites a week later. Life was simple then, rugby ended on April 30th, cricket began 1st May. How different now, on the last Saturday in May 2003, the Barbarians played a World XV at Twickers and went on to play Swansea to mark their 150th anniversary. A reminder that our 150th is in six years time.\n\nThe Presentation Dinner was a great success, more awards were made than in Hollywood on Oscar Night. Some awards are named after club legends like Gareth Howls who was captain five times between 1971 and 1978. In between leading and inspiring Ebbw Vale Gareth played for the Welsh and British Police, Gwent, Wales A and the Barbarians.\n\nHe was also our Player of the Year in 1975, the fourth front-row forward to be honoured since the awards began in 1963 when prop Gordon Main was Player of the Year. Two more props followed, Len Dimmick in 1964 and Denzil Williams in 1965. In 1966 the first Most Promising Player award winner was introduced and it came as no surprise when scrum-half Glyn Turner won it. In 1980 the first Clubman of the Year award, selected by the coach, went to another prop Colin Williams, Laird of Deri.\n\nLast year history was made when a joint captaincy was declared and two front row forwards Joe Franchi and Rhys Francis skilfully led us in an exciting season. They will be joint skippers again in 2023/24 campaign with a squad high on enthusiasm, skill, fitness and who will be backed by supporters who other club treasurers long to see. Under a coach and his crew who have great experience a squad is created and to quote one of them there is also “the togetherness of the whole club from the supporters, coaches, players and backroom staff.”\n\nWe played 24 competitive games last year and Dom Franchi, Rhys Francis and Lewis Young got their century. In 1963 when the first awards were made, Ebbw Vale’s players faced a season of 48 games and Gareth Howls finally ended his rugby career with 608 appearances for the club. Vastly different times and circumstances but those who were in the club in the old days have remarked how similar the spirit is within the club today.\n\nThe 2023/24 Premiership is expected to be more competitive from Day One with two additions, Pontypool and Neath. In the autumn another important rugby event takes place in France. We await our first fixture eagerly, the French know theirs – New Zealand.\n\nREL\n\nPLAYING THE ALL BLACKS 13/05/23\n\nWhen the All-Blacks came to Europe In the autumn of 1953 Ebbw Vale had begun a season that would end as Welsh champions. Under the captaincy of second row giant Ben Edwards they played 39 games, won 29, drew 4 and lost six. Sixteen players were selected by Monmouthshire, four by the WRU in international trial games and seven went a step higher, selection in the Ebbw Vale/Abertillery combined XV that would play the tourists in December.\n\nHigh scoring was not usual in those days but the Ebbw Vale side played what was then described as ‘open’ rugby which featured a back division of pace, quality and style. One of the wings was J B Williams who with centre Graham Powell a future ‘cap’ and John Pugh on the other wing were described by a coastal based rugby journalist as “useful,” the under-statement of the decade.\n\nThe Combined side of eight Abertillery and seven Ebbw Vale players was captained by L E T Jones of Abertillery, known when he played for Ebbw Vale as Lyn The Leap. There were 18,000 at The Park on Wednesday afternoon December 23 rd , four days after Wales had beaten New Zealand at the Arms Park. The Ebbw Valians were J B Williams, John Pugh, hooker Albert Jackson, prop Len Coldrick, locks Len Harris and Ben Edwards and wing forward Horace Matthews. The Combined side gave their best but that famous black magic was too powerful and the tourists won 22-3.\n\nThree days later Abertillery Park was full again for the traditional Boxing Day Derby which Ebbw Vale won 3-0. It was a busy December, Ebbw Vale had played at Newport and won 16-5 before an 8000 crowd and on the first Saturday of the New Year won at Pontypool Park 9-3, with three tries one of them by J B Williams. Reporting on the game at Newport was R T Gabe a Welsh legend whose pass to winger Teddy Morgan resulted in victory over\n\nthe 1905 All-Blacks. In December 1953 he wrote ”J B Williams sprinted about 30 yards to score a fine try.”\n\nJohn Bernard Williams, known to everyone as “J B “ was captain of the rugby, cricket and athletics teams at Tredegar Grammar School and became a Graduate of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. He revelled in a team that played exciting rugby and fulfilled every player’s wish, he played against the All-Blacks. A former player of distinction J B will celebrate his 100 th birthday in August.\n\nREL\n\n06/05/23\n\nA SEASON OF PROMISE\n\nThere are two 20th anniversaries this year that should be noted if not celebrated throughout the land. In Australia in 2003 the fifth Rugby World Cup was won by England, the first and so far the only winners from the Northern Hemisphere. Twenty years ago in Wales the regional system was introduced which prompted one rugby writer to ask if the “perception of Welsh rugby has changed forever.” Regional rugby was not the only change in Wales at the time. In the 2002/03 season we played in four competitions, the Celtic League, Parker Pen Cup, Welsh League and Welsh Cup. Games were played in Ireland, Scotland, France, Spain as well as in South Wales.\n\nBut let’s jump twenty years to 2022/23, a season just ended which was so enjoyable, a season of promise that brought everyone in the club closer. The coaches led by Jason Strange produced a squad with an average age of 24 that trained hard and gave their all in a tough and highly competitive Division. They finished in fifth place with fourteen wins including six doubles over Aberavon, Carmarthen Quins, Llanelli, Newport, Pontypridd and Swansea.\n\nWhile that was going on the budding youth in our rugby community were also doing well. A local girl that really made good, Abi Meyrick played for Wales Under 18s Ladies and is surely destined for a full cap. Harry Rhys Weldon of Ebbw Vale Youth represented Wales in the Under 18s Six Nations and our links with Powys were strengthened when two former Steelmen of renown, Robert Stephens and Des Parry of Gwernyfed RFC recommended a wing, Ryan Davies to us and he has played for Wales Under 19s.\n\nAnother new boy, scrum-half Jonathan Evans has played for Crawshay’s Welsh in the Hong Kong 10s tournament and a second rower, Jakub Maleki, has played several times for Poland in the past few months. Special mention and praise must go to Jason Reynolds whose son Josh plays in our juniors, Jason has played in the Wales Wheelchair rugby team.\n\nThe tale continues, the future is bright with impressive plans to develop an expansive sports ground where the world’s greatest rugby players and cricketers have played but the season has left the club with a problem. On Saturday May 20th the Annual Dinner and Presentation night will be held when awards will be made, one to the Most Promising Player, but there are so many of them this year.\n\nIt has been a pleasure and privilege to watch the team train and play and also socialise with them afterwards, but there is another name to be mentioned, another “first.” We have a young loose-head prop forward, Charley Kearns who hails from over the Severn. He is a former ballet dancer, all 19 stone of him! Hopefully the DJ at the dinner has some Swan Lake in his collection.\n\nREL\n\nLatest extract from the Ebbw Vale v Cardiff programme Saturday 29th April 2023\n\nTHE DAYS WE THOUGHT WOULD NEVER END\n\nOn Saturday the 21st of June 2003 Wales played New Zealand in Waikato Stadium, Hamilton and for the last time the players represented their clubs. Two months later Wales played a non-championship game in Dublin and the players came from the five new regions and one who played for Leeds. The days had gone never to return when international players represented Welsh clubs and there is one of many games that reminds us how rewarding that was for players and spectators.\n\nIn April 2000 Cardiff played Ebbw Vale at the Arms Park in a Welsh/Scottish League fixture and fielded a side full of capped players. Their team was Rhys Williams; Ian Botham, Gareth Thomas, Jamie Robinson, Nick Walne; Neil Jenkins, Robert Howley; Andrew Lewis, Jonathan Humphries (captain), Spencer John; Steve Moore, John Tait; Owain Williams, Martyn Williams, Emyr Lewis. Replacements were Ryan Powell, Paul Burke, Mike Rayer, Mike Voyle, Steve Williams, Gary Powell, Damien Geraghty.\n\nEbbw Vale’s side was Siua Taumalolo; Rhys Shorney, Jonathan Hawker, Andrew Wagstaffe; Shaun Connor, Richard Smith; Iestyn Thomas, Leighton Phillips, Andrew Metcalfe; Lee Banks, Kuli Falatau; Nathan Budgett, Mark Jones (captain). Brad Clark. Replacements were Jonathan Williams, Jason Strange, Guy Easterby, Alun Phillips, Andrew Peacock, Deiniol Jones, Mark Spiller, Gareth Green. Added to the international flavour of the game was the referee, Clayton Thomas. Cardiff won 48-31 and in his usual match-winning form Neil Jenkins contributed 19 points.It was a busy season for the clubs in the Welsh/Scottish League with games against Edinburgh and Glasgow. Cardiff topped the table with 59 points followed by Newport (49), Swansea (47), Pontypridd (45), Llanelli (38), Ebbw Vale (38), Neath (35), Edinburgh (34), Bridgend (27), Glasgow (25), Caerphilly (6) and Dunvant (5). Ebbw Vale only lost three games at home, to Cardiff 22-17 and Swansea 23-16 in the league and London Irish 21-20 in the European Shield, a game that was decided in the dying moments when a drop goal attempt by Shaun Connor was approved by everyone except the French referee.\n\nThe players, coaches Leigh Jones and Richard Hill and supporters were compensated by a splendid Cup run which took us to a semi-final in the Millenium Stadium. We lost to Llanelli 38-26 who led 26-0 at one stage before we hit back scoring three tries in 15 minutes and twenty points to Llanelli’s seven in the second half. It was a great day at the new stadium, two semi-finals and Welsh club rugby at its best.\n\nA song by Mary Hopkins springs to mind, “Those were the days my friend, we thought they’d never end.” But they did.\n\nREL\n\nExtract from Ebbw Vale v Aberavon match programme Saturday 22nd April 2023\n\nTALES OF TWO HALVES\n\nThere have been many close games with Aberavon from the first time we played them on December 29th 1894 which ended in a 3-0 win for the Wizards to the last on November 11th 2022, also at Port Talbot which went to the wire before we won 24-17. Two encounters in particular remain fresh in the memory of players who pulled off amazing comebacks and the watchers who had no nails left to bite when final whistles were blown.\n\nIn a memorable match at Port Talbot in October 1977 the master of lineouts Allan Martin, a lock who kicked goals, converted a try and added a penalty goal to give the Wizards a 9-0 lead increased by as try then worth four points that made it 13-0 with the referee checking his watch. The result seemed inevitable and some locals went into the clubhouse to get their beer before the rush, but in doing so missed the dramatic finale. With minutes left Ebbw Vale wing Russell Cole scored a try converted quickly by Steve Lewis who added a penalty goal. Wizards 13 Steelmen 9.\n\nThen our centre Alan Tovey levelled the score when he powered his way to score a try under the posts which was converted by Steve Lewis. The final whistle was blown at last and we had won 15-13. There were smiles and shocks in the bar after another Wizards/Steelmen thriller.\n\nOn Friday September 7th 2018 we were invaded by BBC Wales televising the match with Aberavon who dominated the first half scoring tries by David Pritchard, Luke Davies and Joe Tomlin Reeves. Aberavon led 17-0 at the break but crucially only one of the tries was converted by James Garland which was to prove important. Ebbw dominated the second half with tries by Ronnie Kynes, Ashley Sweet and winger Stefan Thomas, two conversions by Rhys Jones bringing a 19-17 victory.\n\nEbbw Vale’s side that evening was Dan Haymond; Stefan Thomas, Carl Meyer, Dom Franchi; Rhys Jones, Matthew Flanagan; Joel Harris, Rhys Francis, Rob Sevenoaks; Lance Randall, Ashley Sweet; Ronnie Kynes (capt), Owen Young, Lewis Young. Replacements were Joe Franchi, Ross Jones, Curtis Hicks, Garin Price, Cameron Regan. Dai Jones, James Lewis, Paul King.\n\nThanks to second half comebacks the opening month of the 2018/19 season had been successful for the Steelmen. After a 43-10 win at Llanelli we won the next four games each one too close for comfort. After edging out RGC 19-12, Bridgend 17-16 and Neath away 25-17 which led our match programme editor Iain Swanson to declare, “Ebbw Vale have made more comebacks than Status Quo!”\n\nREL\n\nWOLFHOUNDS AT THE WELFARE GROUND\n\nFifty years ago the Welsh team that played Ireland at Cardiff were captained for the third time by Arthur Lewis of Ebbw Vale and the Irish for the first time by Willie John McBride of Ballymena. In his team were full-back A H Ensor (Dublin Wanderers), scrum-half J J Maloney (St. Mary’s College) and lock forward K M A Mays (University College Dublin) who met up with Arthur again on Thursday September 20th 1973 when they came to the Welfare Ground with the Irish Wolfhounds known as the “second national rugby union team in Ireland.”\n\nThere were no squads as we know them today, players worked for a living, playing for their club andrepresentative sides like Monmouthshire and Munsterbefore being chosen for their countries and the Lions. Eight of the Wolfhounds who played at Ebbw Vale were or would be capped by Ireland and six had been in the victorious Leinster side that played Fiji the previous Saturday..\n\nThe Ebbw Vale side was David Rees; Robert Fowler, Arthur Lewis, Allan Tovey, Ian Evans; P Lloyd Davies, Glyn Turner; Keith Morris, Mike Paul, Denzil Williams; Gareth Howls (captain), James B Criddle; Eddie Powell, Ray Rowlands, Phil Gardner. They won the game 13-7 but lost the party afterwards.\n\nIt was a time of change in world rugby and a voice from the east warned us that “Japan should be worth watching.” That prophecy came from Denis P Evans, Oxford University (1959), Ebbw Vale, Llanelli and Wales, Honorary Coach, Hong Kong RFC).\n\nBack in the Mother Country the five nations produced a quintuple tie in their Championship, two wins and two defeats four points each. The final table was in alphabetical order, England first and Wales last although one writer considered Wales the best team, especially behind the scrum. The back division against England who Wales beat 25-9 was in a class all its own, J P R Williams; Gerald Davies, Roy Bergiers, Arthur Lewis (capt.), John Bevan; Phil Bennett and Gareth Edwards.\n\nIt was an exciting era at all levels. The 1971 Lions had won a series in New Zealand and the 1974 team would win every game in South Africa except the last which they drew. Clubs played 45 to 50 games, fixture secretaries were always busy and on the lookout for something speciallike hosting the Irish Wolfhounds on a Thursday evening.\n\nREL\n\nExtracted from the match programme for Ebbw Vale v Pontypridd 6 April 2023\n\nA LICENCE TO THRILL\n\nOn the 8th of April 2000 we were home to Pontypridd and 23 years almost to the day we welcome them again. The April 2000 game turned out to be a rugby spectator’s dream and a scoreboard operator’s nightmare. It was a Welsh Scottish League fixture and a South Wales Valley Derby which invariably attracts many supporters of both clubs. In October 1999 we lost at Sardis Road 36-20, Ponty full back Brett Davey kicking five penalty goals but we returned the compliment in April in a game of tries galore to win 47-26.\n\nThe Ebbw Vale team was Jonathan Williams; Rhys Shorney, Siua Taumalolo, Jonathan Hawker, Andrew Wagstaff; Shaun Connor, Richard Smith; Iestyn Thomas, Leyton Phillips, Andrew Metcalfe; Glyn Llewellyn, Kuli Faletau; Nathan Budgett, Brad Clark, Mark Jones (captain). Replacements – Andrew Peacock, Damien Pencini, Lee Banks, Paul Williams, Guy Easterby, Jason Strange, Stephen John.\n\nPontypridd – Brett Davey; Gareth Whyatt, Sonny Parker, Jason Lewis, John Colderly; Lee Jarvis, Paul John (captain); Christian Loader, Sven Cronk; Ian Gough, Robert Sidoli; Michael Owen, Richard Field, Dale McIntosh. Two replacements were announced, Matthew Taylor and Ceri Sweeney\n\nIt was a fixture of some importance with a place in the following season’s Heineken Cup at stake. The battle of the half-backs would be decisive and so it was. Western Mail reporter Andy Howell, a Western Valley lad and clearly a Bond fan, wrote “Shaun Connor was given a licence to thrill,” and gave credit to backs coach Richard Hill, former Bath and England scrum-half. Shaun Connor contributed 32 points that included two tries, Rhys Shorney also got two and Richard Smith one. Head coach Leigh Jones who was destined for World Cup fame five years later in the Japanese coaching team under Eddie Jones when they beat South Africa, was more than pleased.\n\nIt was a high-scoring afternoon in South Wales, at Swansea the All-Whites defeated Neath 52-44, a week after the Welsh All-Blacks had beaten us at the Gnoll 29-25 scoring four tries to our three. Little did we know that one of Neath’s try scorers would be our coach one day, Alex Codling.\n\nApril used to be the month of tours when the citizens of the Duchy of Cornwall prepared for our traditional annual visit which was very demanding playing three matches in four days which we invariably won. Now we have play-offs and remember two at Sardis Road, in May 2015 when Pontypridd won 28-14 and a year later when we won 38-12 and our full-back Don Haymond won an Oscar for his dive when scoring the last try of the game.\n\nMemories of the 2016 play-off final keep coming back but Pontypridd’s win in 2015 should be recalled. Ebbw Vale’s report on the game summed it up, “The home side were eventually convincing and deserved winners……….but had to fight every inch of the way as the Steelmen gave them a severe test.” It is interesting to note the top five places of the 2014/15 Premiership table – 1st Pontypridd (94 pts), 2nd Ebbw Vale (73), 3rd Cross Keys (71), 4th Cardiff (60), 5th Bedwas (60). RE\n\nPROMOTION FAVOURITES IN EBBW VALE CUP TIE\n\nWhile our players, coaches and supporters were at Carmarthen where Ebbw Vale played the Quins in the Premiership there was a Championship Cup semi-final on our ground between Neath and Pontypool both favourites to gain promotion. They have dominated the Championship and have kept scoreboards busy, the only close results so far being in the league games against each other, Pontypool winning both 28-23 at The Gnoll and 34-30 at Pontypool Park. Of interest to Ebbw Valians in their squad are former Steelmen Dai Jones, Dai Langdon, Cameron Regan, Ashley Sweet and Lance Randall.\n\nThe last time we played Neath was in August 2022 when we returned to The Gnoll for a pre-league game. The last competitive game with them was in the 2018/19 season when we got the double, winning at The Gnoll 25-17 and in the penultimate game of the season 74-7!. That was unusual but so were the results in 2006/07, two drawn games both 23-23. That was the season Neath finished top of the Premiership with 53 points and we were second with 51.\n\nOur last competitive game with Pontypool was in the Championship in the 2013/14 season when we got the double 33-10 at home and 19-13 at Pontypool Park. I am told by former players that they enjoy reading the names of teams they played in so for the “veterans” this is the Ebbw Vale team that played Pontypool at ECP on Saint David’s Day 2014.\n\nEbbw Vale – Tom McAloon; Wes Cunliffe, David James, Jordan Howells, Paolo Uni; Ian Smerdon, Dai Jones; Ross Jones, Matthew Williams, Robert Sevenoaks; Damien Hudd (capt.), Ashley Sweet; Gareth Rusby-Davies; Ronnie Kynes, Cameron Regan. Replacements were Luke Liddington, Joe Franchi, Rhys Clarke, Chris Thomas and Luke Davies.\n\nAfter another absorbing Six Nations it is refreshing to return to club rugby which has been played in Wales for almost a hundred and fifty years and has inspired loyalty from its players and supporters who take pride in a club’s traditions and history. The book “Fields of Praise” was written for the Welsh Rugby Union’s centenary in 1980 and describes Welsh rugby as a “rainy night at the end of the Llynfi Valley watching Maesteg drive forward on their table-top ground…….the bass intimidation of ‘Neath! Neath!’, the drumming affirmation for a beaten WRU Cup semi-final team of ‘Ebbw, Ebbw, Ebbw.’ Welsh rugby is very different now but it is still based on clubs who provide rugby for all ages from juniors to the 1st XV and are as important and as indispensable as ever.\n\nREL\n\nVALE’S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENTENTE CORDIALE\n\nBefore fixtures were arranged for us not by us we often played on the eve of international Championship matches later known as Five Nations which became Six with the welcome addition of Italy. For many years Wales played England in January, Scotland in February and Ireland and the favourites France in March. In the 1960s Ebbw Vale played Paris University, the Alma Mater of many famous French players and coaches, three times on the eve of the Cardiff game and twice in Paris where the Ebbw Vale players sought culture and upheld the tradition of Entente Cordiale.\n\nThe first of a short but enjoyable series of March games with Paris University was in 1962 on the eve of Wales v France at Cardiff Arms Park. Club captain Len Dimmick and his ‘other ranks’ won a most enjoyable game 17-9 unlike the next day’s international which Wales only won 3-0. A year later the team led by Dennis Evans went to Paris, enjoyed the sights and came home educated and satisfied with an 11-11 draw. Next day Wales lost at Stade Colombe 5-3 and for the first time for fourteen years finished at the bottom of the championship table despite there being seven of the team from Gwent clubs, captain Clive Rowlands (Pontypool), David Watkins and Brian Price (Newport), Hadyn Morgan and Alun Pask (Abertillery) and Denzil Williams and Graham Jones (Ebbw Vale).\n\nThe annual Gallic clash in 1964 followed the trend, an era when scoreboard operators read a book to pass the time, but at least we beat Paris Uni under the captaincy of Graham Jones 5-3 the night before Wales and France drew 11-11, The 1965 games were much brighter but not successful, we lost 11-25 and Wales 13-22 but in 1966 the fifth and last fixture with Paris University brought home wins to Ebbw Vale 10-3 and Wales 9-8.\n\nThirty years later French rugby re-appeared with European Cup and Shield games against prominent clubs like Toulon, Toulouse and La Rochelle but not one of the Paris clubs, a disappointment to the artistic minded in the front five. There were no Under 20s in the 60s but Welsh Schools and Youth flourished and provided more opportunities at club and international level than today\n\nIn the Sixties Wales Secondary Schools and the Under 15s and Wales Youth played the other countries. The Youth launched to stardom an outside-half from Felinfoel named P. Bennett. In a game at Stradey against French Youth he inspired a 16-0 victory despite being kicked in the face and knocked about behind his goal-line he raced 45 yards with his left eye completely closed and scored a brilliant try.\n\nThe Rugby World Cup will be held in France next year and hopefully will be free of controversy, referees will reach the pinnacle of their profession supported by their assistants running the line and the TMO who has the final word. In the pre-professional years even being selected to referee a Schools international was an honour. When Wales and England met in a Schools international at the Arm Park in April 1967, the referee was a teacher from Ebbw Vale who went on to be become the club secretary. Ivor George.\n\nREL\n\nExtracted from the match programme Ebbw Vale v Merthyr 15 March 2023\n\nTHE MOST LOCAL OF LOCAL DERBIES\n\nThis fixture should have been played a week before Christmas but nature intervened which was a pity for the perfect Festive game is against neighbours who haven’t far to travel. Last Boxing Day all but one of the Premiership clubs were locally engaged but Merthyr was the exception, they had to travel north to Colwyn Bay where in pouring rain they beat RGC which made their journey worthwhile. Weather permitting December and January are busy months as they were in 2018/2019, when we played nine games, won seven, drew one and lost the most important to Merthyr in a Cup semi-final.\n\nThe Premiership was very competitive and each of our games in December 2018 and January 2019 were hard fought encounters. In December we beat Bargoed away 35-21, Cardiff 22-20 and Llanelli 20-7 at home, drew 14-14 at Aberavon and won 38-17 at Bedwas. In January we played Carmarthen Quins away in the Cup quarter-final and won 20-19, beat RGC 27-26 at home and Bridgend away 14-10. Then came the semi-final at Cross Keys won by Merthyr 10-9 which took them to the final which of course they won. The victory in the Cup at Carmarthen was due to a late penalty goal by Rhys Jones who has played outside-half for both Ebbw Vale and Merthyr.\n\nThe Ebbw Vale side that played RGC in our first home game in 2019 was Dan Haymond; Steffan Thomas, James Lewis, Dominic Franchi, Toby Fricker; Rhys Jones, Dai Jones; Luke Garrett, Rhys Francis, Robert Sevenoaks; Rhys Clarke, Ashley Sweet (captain); Cameron Regan, Lloyd Evans, Lewis Young. Waiting in the wings were Joe Franchi, Ross Jones, Curtis Hicks, Kristian Parker, Owen Young, Matthew Flanagan.\n\nIt wasn’t until 2010 that we played Merthyr regularly but David Boucher’s book “Steel, Skill & Survival” reminds us that in April 1885 we were home to Merthyr on an occasion according to the Merthyr Express that ended with the visitors being treated to an “excellent tea” in the County Hotel. Merthyr’s visit must have been a special occasion because at the time the town was the largest in Wales, its population out-numbering Newport and Cardiff.\n\nSome of our most loyal and outstanding players came from Merthyr and came to the well attended Past Players Reunion last year. They never had to travel far thanks to the Heads of the Valleys road, Wales’s answer to the Los Angeles Freeway, just a short journey between two towns who share heavy industrial backgrounds and the same language – Wenglish.\n\nREL\n\nGETTING PROMOTION THE HARD WAY\n\nThe Premiership play-offs are in view and the battle to be in the top four has begun. It is a dramatic way to end a season but when promotion is the prize the tension really mounts as it did for Ebbw Vale in the last month of the 1994/95 season. We were in Division Two and at the end of March were aiming to be one of the two clubs to get promoted. Three were in the chase, Aberavon, Ebbw Vale and Abercynon who had been promoted from Division Three after winning all but one of their matches and amassing 76 tries.\n\nEbbw Vale captained by Andrew Oliver aged 23 in his third season with the club had to win the last five matches and score a lot of tries. The first hurdle was traditionally difficult, Cross Keys at Pandy Park but the team showed its quality and won 34-9, our lively flanker David Harris scoring two tries. His recent passing at the age of 57 was mourned by all who played alongside him and those privileged to watch him. Andrew Oliver remembers him as the king of the turnover who gave his all on the field and off it was quiet and respectful. He played many times for Ebbw Vale and after he joined from Dowlais soon became a favourite of Ebbw Vale supporters.\n\nAfter Cross Keys we were at home to our main challengers, Abercynon, a good side hard to beat and well supported. There was concern over our uncompromising hooker Steve ‘Spike’ Jones who was struggling with a rib injury but he reported fit and as usual made his presence felt. Abercynon led 15-14 in the second half but they were penalised at a scrum, full-back Carl Thomas from a narrow angle kicked the goal and the Steelmen hung on to a 17-15 lead to the joy of home supporters on the packed terrace.\n\nThere were three games left, Tenby at home which we won 27-18 followed by Maesteg away. The Old Parish had no answer to Mike Boys the trickiest pivot in Wales and we won 39-18. The final fixture was at Narberth, our first visit to that friendly and hospitable club where a win would bring promotion by try count. We won 39-9 with six tries by Darren Worgan (2), Paul Young, Andrew Jewitt, Paul Chard and David Davies. Final placings at the top of Division One were first Aberavon 34 points (58 tries), second Ebbw Vale 33 (59) and third Abercynon 33 (38).\n\nHaving reached the 1st Division we had to work hard to stay in it but did well to finish the 1995/96 season with 11 wins and 11 losses. There were some narrow wins, one at home to Bridgend in November 1995 which had a similar finish to the same fixture 28 years later. The captains were Kingsley Jones and Robert Howley and we led 10-8 with a few minutes left when Bridgend full-back Adrian Durston attempted a drop goal that would have won the game for the Ravens but he was inches wide of an upright. In February 2023 with the score Ebbw Vale 27 Bridgend 27 and the referee checking his watch the Steelmen’s full-back Kieran Meek attempted a drop goal which did not go wide and we won 30-27.\n\nThe Ebbw Vale squad that played Bridgend that day was Matthew Chapman; Ian Jeffries, Cain Price, Mike Boys, Neil Morgan; Byron Hayward, David Llewellyn; Alan Phillips, Steve Jones, Wayne Ford; Dorian Medlicott, Eldon Moors; Ben Watkins, Kingsley Jones, John Williams. Replacements were Malcolm Sibthorpe, Mike Boycott, Iestyn Lewis, Paul Hudson, John Bamsey – and David Harris.

A history of the Alliance written by Ray Ruddick a notable member of the Rugby Memorabilia Society brings back memories of entertaining rugby played in evenings from the 1964/65 season to 1973/74. It was a ten year period of exciting rugby in Wales and in New Zealand where the 1971 Lions won a series for the first time. In the party was a player from Crumlin in the Western Valley of Monmouthshire, Arthur Lewis who two years later captained Wales. The Lions took a brilliant set of backs to New Zealand which included David Duckham still regarded by some as England’s best ever centre, a great player Arthur often played alongside on the tour. David Duckham played for Coventry against Ebbw Vale several times, a rugby giant whose recent death was mourned throughout the game.\n\nOne reason the Floodlight Alliance Tournament in Wales was formed was to ‘concentrate on high point scoring and to play open, expansive, exciting rugby’ which suited those who played and watched at Bridgend and Ebbw Vale. Eight teams competed and as the history of the Alliance states Ebbw Vale had been one of its instigators with its chairman John Gaydon playing a vital role as the only Alliance secretary in the ten years of its existence. John as an administrator of the club and full-back for Ebbw Vale Athletic also kept wicket for Ebbw Vale Cricket Club.\n\nNewport and Bristol wanted to join but the rugger chiefs at Twickers did not approve and as Newport was also a member of the RFU they could not take part, a disappointment for Newport who had staged the first game ‘under electric light’ in December 1878. In November 1964 the first game under ‘proper’ floodlights took place at Pandy Park between a Western Valley XV captained by Ebbw’s Eric Finney and a Welsh International XV formed by Ray Lewis the physio to Cross Keys. Newport and Wales. Raymond Ruddick’s history tells us there were eleven capped players in the International team which was captained by Cliff Morgan and won 16-11 before 7000 spectators.\n\nEbbw Vale played 37 Alliance matches winning 18, drawing four and losing 15 and were three times runners-up in the final. One game still remembered as the best seen on our ground was against Bridgend in November 1971. We won a thriller 28-26 scoring seven tries three by Glyn Turner and others by Mike Lewis, David Jones, Arthur Lewis and Mike Grindle. Bridgend’s try scorers were Tony Morgan (2), Viv Jenkins and Peter Williams.\n\nNever had so many flocked to grounds to see teams like Ebbw Vale and Bridgend score so many points and play such “open, expansive and exciting rugby.” It was a great advertisement for the game, capped by a Welsh Grand Slam and the Lions who played 26 games in Australia and New Zealand, winning 23, with one drawn and losing two. Clubs supplied the players from rugby strongholds throughout Britain and Ireland, fourteen of them Welsh representing Cardiff, Cardiff College of Education, Llanelli, London Welsh, Maesteg – and Ebbw Vale.\n\nREL\n\nExtracted from the Ebbw Vale v Llanelli match programme 3 February 2023\n\nTHE FIRST AND LAST WELSH CUP FINAL IN ENGLAND\n\nThe Premiership this season is back in its traditional form of twelve clubs playing twenty-two games but the Cup is very different. The traditional Cup we knew and enjoyed was dominated by Llanelli and when we played them in the May 1998 Final at Ashton Gate in Bristol it was their thirteenth final and they had won nine. It was played in England due to the construction of the Millenium Stadium and fleets of buses and cars gave a great boost to the Severn Bridge tolls.\n\nIn the Premier Division we got the double over Llanelli but their Cup experience brought them a 19-12 victory. Ebbw Vale skipper Kingsley Jones commented, “We had 70% of the ball but Llanelli took their chances.” Siua Taumalolo who had scored three tries in the semi-final was named Man of the Match, unusual for a player on a losing side in a final. Our road to Bristol is worth recalling, Kidwelly (h) 57-14; Tonyrefail (a) 60-20; Cardiff (h) 20-9; Swansea (h) 27-13 and Newport 44-10 in the semi-final.\n\nThe Ebbw Vale side at Ashton Gate was Siua Taumalolo; Alun Harries, Jonathan Hawker, John Funnell, Lenny Woodward; Byron Hayward, David Llewellyn; Alun Phillips, Leyton Phillips, Mike Wilson; Chay Billen, Kuli Faletau; Richie Collins, Mark Jones, Kingsley Jones (captain). The replacements were Iestyn Thomas, Steve Jones, Lee Banks, Paul Pook, Gareth Bisp, Jason Strange.\n\nAlso in 1998 the All-Blacks came on a nine-game tour and played three times in Wales. They beat Llanelli 81-3, Wales A at Sardis Road 51-8 and Wales 42-7 and adding to Celtic concern in the Five Nations Wales lost 60-26 at Twickenham and 51-0 against France at Wembley but won by narrower margins 30-21 in Dublin and 19-13 against Scotland at Wembley.\n\nLlanelli’s visit will remind us of Phil Bennett whose death saddened the whole rugby world. When he came to our ground with the Llanelli team in April 1977 he stepped off the team bus and was surrounded by admirers but he noticed one of our supporters in a wheelchair and thrust his way through the crowd to talk to him. A great player and a great man.\n\nREL\n\nBIG DAY, BIG CROWD\n\nWhen All-Blacks, Springboks and Wallabies made long tours to Britain, Ireland and France they played clubs and regional teams. In 1969 the Springboks played Gwent at Ebbw Vale and were followed three years later by the 6th All-Blacks each drawing huge crowds. The following photograph shows the terrace packed with rugby enthusiasts from all over the County for the All-Black game on November 28th 1972. The tourists won 16-7, not an exciting game but a big day for Gwent rugby and a good way to spend a Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe County side consisted of players from Pontypool, Newbridge, Bedwas, and Ebbw Vale with a Blaina forward on the bench. The Ebbw Valians were Ray Parry on the wing, Mike Grindle and Glyn Turner at half-back, prop Gareth Howls and Gomer Evans in the backrow. There was one replacement used, when Gomer was injured Alan Tucker of Blaina took his place a great boost for his club and thoroughly deserved.\n\nFor the spectators the most exciting moment was a try by Glyn Turner who played opposite Sid Going. He picked up a loose ball, nipped around the blind-side and touched down in the corner a move described in one report of the game as a “cheeky try.” It was typical of Glyn Turner who scored 147 tries in the 350 games he played for Ebbw Vale.\n\nREL\n\nPLEASURE AT PORT TALBOT, GRIEF IN NANTES\n\nFifteen years ago a New Zealander and an Englishman came to Wales to take command of the Welsh national team which had under-performed in the 2008 Rugby World Cup in France. Former Ireland coach Warren Gatland and Shaun Edwards soon made their presence felt, in 2009 Wales captained by Ryan Jones won the Grand Slam. In the first round Wales won 26-19 at Twickers, a game dominated by the Ospreys, thirteen of them started and a 14th went on as a replacement. It was Warren Gatland’s first game as Welsh coach and Wales were 19-6 down at one stage but the 82,000 crowd then witnessed a comeback inspired by half-backs James Hook and Mike Phillips and master-minded by Warren & Co.\n\nIn 2008 a new competition began, the Junior World Championship hosted by Wales and played at Swansea, Cardiff and Newport known for rugby and Wrexham for lager.
