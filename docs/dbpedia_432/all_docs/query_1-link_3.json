        "text": "Woody Allen was born on November 30, 1935, as Allen Konigsberg, in The Bronx, NY, the son of Martin Konigsberg and Nettie Konigsberg. He has one younger sister, Letty Aronson. As a young boy, he became intrigued with magic tricks and playing the clarinet, two hobbies that he continues today.\n\nAllen broke into show business at 15 years when he started writing jokes for a local paper, receiving $200 a week. He later moved on to write jokes for talk shows but felt that his jokes were being wasted. His agents, Charles Joffe and Jack Rollins, convinced him to start doing stand-up and telling his own jokes. Reluctantly he agreed and, although he initially performed with such fear of the audience that he would cover his ears when they applauded his jokes, he eventually became very successful at stand-up. After performing on stage for a few years, he was approached to write a script for Warren Beatty to star in: Was gibt's Neues, Pussy? (1965) and would also have a moderate role as a character in the film. During production, Woody gave himself more and better lines and left Beatty with less compelling dialogue. Beatty inevitably quit the project and was replaced by Peter Sellers, who demanded all the best lines and more screen-time.\n\nIt was from this experience that Woody realized that he could not work on a film without complete control over its production. Woody's theoretical directorial debut was in What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966); a Japanese spy flick that he dubbed over with his own comedic dialogue about spies searching for the secret recipe for egg salad. His real directorial debut came the next year in the mockumentary Woody, der Unglücksrabe (1969). He has written, directed and, more often than not, starred in about a film a year ever since, while simultaneously writing more than a dozen plays and several books of comedy.\n\nWhile best known for his romantic comedies Der Stadtneurotiker (1977) and Manhattan (1979), Woody has made many transitions in his films throughout the years, transitioning from his \"early, funny ones\" of Bananas (1971), Die letzte Nacht des Boris Gruschenko (1975) and Was Sie schon immer über Sex wissen wollten, aber bisher nicht zu fragen wagten (1972); to his more storied and romantic comedies of Der Stadtneurotiker (1977), Manhattan (1979) and Hannah und ihre Schwestern (1986); to the Bergmanesque films of Stardust Memories (1980) and Innenleben (1978); and then on to the more recent, but varied works of Verbrechen und andere Kleinigkeiten (1989), Ehemänner und Ehefrauen (1992), Geliebte Aphrodite (1995), Celebrity - Schön, reich, berühmt (1998) and Harry außer sich (1997); and finally to his films of the last decade, which vary from the light comedy of Scoop - Der Knüller (2006), to the self-destructive darkness of Match Point (2005) and, most recently, to the cinematically beautiful tale of Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). Although his stories and style have changed over the years, he is regarded as one of the best filmmakers of our time because of his views on art and his mastery of filmmaking.\n\nAn accomplished and award-winning producer-director-writer-actor-singer, Farhan Akhtar is the ultimate Bollywood multi-hyphenate. Born in 1974 to prolific Indian film writer and poet, Javed Akhtar and writer-director, Honey Irani , Farhan was raised in an environment where creativity and originality of thought were encouraged. This has made him a maverick whose films reflect refreshingly new content that easily strikes a chord with filmgoers.\n\nIn 1999, Farhan collaborated with Ritesh Sidhwani, a friend who shared his passion for good cinema, to form Excel Entertainment, a production banner that has become synonymous with excellence in film-making.\n\nDebuting at the age of 26, as a writer, director, and producer with Dil Chahta Hai (2001) a coming-of-age film that has gained cult status, Farhan came to be lauded for his honest, path-breaking writing and his ability to extract mature performances from his cast. The film won Farhan his first National Award for 'Best Hindi Feature Film' along with Filmfare awards for 'Best Feature Film - Critics Choice' and 'Best Screenplay'.\n\nAlmost two decades later, this film continues to influence a generation of filmmakers.\n\nSeven years after his dream debut as a writer-director, Farhan debuted as an actor-singer in Rock On!! (2008) Yet another runaway success, the film secured him a second National Award for 'Best Hindi Feature Film' and a Filmfare award for 'Best Debut Performance'.\n\nThe dream run continued with Man lebt nur einmal (2011) which released in 2011 to much popular and critical acclaim, winning him three Filmfare awards for 'Best Film', 'Best Actor in a supporting role' and 'Best Dialogue'.\n\nHis next, a biopic on Indian athlete Milkha Singh, popularly known as 'the Flying Sikh', was entitled Der Lauf seines Lebens: The Flying Sikh (2013).\n\nHe essayed the role with such integrity that it set the standard for other actors considering to play titular protagonists in biopics. Deservingly, Farhan swept all awards that year for 'Best Actor' as did the film for 'Best Film'. It also claimed the National award for 'Best Popular Film providing Wholesome Entertainment.'\n\nHis most recent release The Sky Is Pink (2019) premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and received a 15-minute standing ovation from the audience at the Roy Thomson Hall.\n\nIn addition to his contribution to Indian cinema, Farhan has initiated and supported a plethora of social causes. In 2012, he founded MARD (Men against Rape & Discrimination), an initiative that raises awareness about gender-related issues amongst the youth of India. Recognizing his sustained efforts, Farhan was made the first male UNwomen goodwill ambassador (South Asia) in 2014.\n\nAdditionally, Farhan feeds his passion for music by writing, composing and performing live with his band FarhanLive.\n\nHis English language debut album 'Echoes' released in March 2019 to critical acclaim.\n\nHe has 2 daughters and lives in Mumbai, India.\n\nAsia Argento was born in Rome, Italy, into a family of actors and filmmakers, both occupations which she has herself pursued. She made her debut when she was only nine years old in Sergio Citti's Sogni e bisogni (1985). In 1988 she had the leading role in Cristina Comencini's first film, Sehnsucht nach Freiheit (1988), and was part of the cast of The Church (1989), directed by Michele Soavi. The following year she played Nanni Moretti's daughter in Wasserball und Kommunismus (1989) (also directed by Moretti).\n\nIt was with Endstation Mord (1992), written and directed by Michele Placido, that Asia's career really took off and she was able to move on from playing very young girls to more mature, complex roles. The movie was well-received at the Cannes International Film Festival. In Aura (1993), she worked for the first time with her father, famed Italian horror director Dario Argento (her mother is one of Argento's favorite actresses, Daria Nicolodi, playing an anorexic girl in search of her parents' killer. Das Phantom der Oper (1998) is the third film she has made with her father, the others being Aura (1993) (filmed in the US) and Das Stendhal Syndrom (1996).\n\nAsia's absorbed, intense style of acting was well-used in Giuseppe Piccioni's Condannato a nozze (1993). In 1993 she co-starred in Carlo Verdone's Perdiamoci di vista (1994) in which she played Arianna, a physically disabled girl--an intricate, difficult role that won her the David di Donatello for best actress (1993-1994). She also had a featured role in the international cast of Die Bartholomäusnacht (1994), directed by Patrice Chéreau. In 1995 she worked with Michel Piccoli in Peter Del Monte's Die Reisegefährtin (1996), which again won her a David di Donatello and a Grolla d'oro.\n\nIn 1994 Asia turned her hand to directing and turned out two short films: \"Prospettive\" (an episode of the film De Generazione (1994)) and \"A ritroso\". In 1996 she directed a documentary on her father and, in 1998, one on cult director Abel Ferrara, Abel/Asia (1998), which won an award at the Rome Film Festival. In 1999 Asia made her feature-directing debut with Scarlet Diva (2000), in which she was the leading actress and author of the screenplay. The film was released in May 2000 in Italy and the rest of the world. It won an award at the Williamsburg Film Festival in Brooklyn, New York. In 2001, after directing a number of music videos, she gave birth to her first daughter, Anna Lou. In 2002 she starred in Red Siren (2002) by Olivier Megaton with Jean-Marc Barr and the action thriller xXx - Triple X (2002), directed by Rob Cohen, with Vin Diesel.\n\nAsia is also the author of a number of short stories published in many prestigious magazines such as \"Dynamo,\" \"L'Espresso,\" \"Sette,\" and \"Village,\" Her first novel, \"I Love You, Kirk,\" was published in Italy by Frassinelli Editrice in October 1999 and in France by Florent Massot in 2001.\n\nJane Asher (born 5 April 1946) is an English actress, author and entrepreneur, who achieved early fame as a child actress, and has worked extensively in film and TV throughout her career.\n\nShe has appeared in TV shows and films such as Satanas - Das Schloß der blutigen Bestie (1964), Der Verführer läßt schön grüßen (1966), Deep End (1970), The Mistress (1985-1987), Crossroads (2001-2003), Sterben für Anfänger (2007) and The Old Guys (2009-). She is also known for supplying specialist cakes and kitchenware, as well as publishing three bestselling novels.\n\nAsher was the middle of three children born to Richard Alan John and Margaret Asher, née Eliot, in Willesden, North West London. Her father was a consultant in blood and mental diseases at the Central Middlesex Hospital, as well as being a broadcaster and the author of notable medical articles. Asher's mother was a professor at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Asher attended Queen's College in Harley Street, London and is the elder sister of Clare Asher, a radio actress and school inspector. Asher's elder brother is record producer Peter Asher, of Peter and Gordon.\n\nShe was a key figure of 1960s show-business society as the fiancée of Paul McCartney. Asher met the illustrator Gerald Scarfe in 1971, and they married ten years later. They have three children, daughter actress Katie Scarfe (born April 17, 1974), and sons Alex Scarfe (born December 1981) and Rory (born 1984).\n\nJavier Bardem belongs to a family of actors that have been working on films since the early days of Spanish cinema.\n\nHe was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, to actress Pilar Bardem (María del Pilar Bardem Muñoz) and businessman José Carlos Encinas Doussinague. His maternal grandparents were actors Rafael Bardem and Matilde Muñoz Sampedro, and his uncle is screenwriter Juan Antonio Bardem. He got his start in the family business, at age six, when he appeared in his first feature, \"El picaro\" (1974) (A.K.A. The Scoundrel). During his teenage years, he acted in several TV series, played rugby for the Spanish National Team, and toured the country with an independent theatrical group. Javier's early film role as a sexy stud in the black comedy, Lust auf Fleisch (1992) (aka Ham Ham) propelled him to instant popularity and threatened to typecast him as nothing more than a brawny sex symbol. Determined to avert a beefcake image, he refused similar subsequent roles and has gone on to win acclaim for his ability to appear almost unrecognizable from film to film. With over 25 movies and numerous awards under his belt, it is Javier's stirring, passionate performance as the persecuted Cuban writer, Reynaldo Arenas, in Bevor es Nacht wird (2000) that will long be remembered as his breakthrough role. He received five Best Actor awards and a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal.\n\nThis celebrated star of the French stage had a sporadic love-hate affair with early cinema. After her film debut in Le duel d'Hamlet (1900) she declared she detested the medium; yet she consented to appear in another film, La Tosca (1909). Upon seeing the results, she reportedly recoiled in horror, demanding that the negative be destroyed. Her next film appearance, in the Film d'Art production of La dame aux camélias (1912), was a critical and popular success, helping give cinema artistic dignity. The following year she made Les amours de la reine Élisabeth (1912) in Britain. The receipts from this film's distribution in the US provided Adolph Zukor with the funds to found Paramount. Bernhardt, at 69, was offered a fortune to make films with other companies, but stayed with Film d'Art, appearing in Adrienne Lecouvreur (1913). She appeared in two more pictures after losing a leg in 1915, Jeanne Doré (1915) and Mères françaises (1917), both produced as WWI morale boosters. In 1923, when she was 79, her hotel room was turned into a studio so that she could appear in the film La voyante (1924). But her failing health halted production and she died before the film was completed. She was portrayed on the screen by Glenda Jackson in Die unglaubliche Sarah (1976).\n\nPaul Bettany is an English actor. He first came to the attention of mainstream audiences when he appeared in the British film Gangster Nr. 1 (2000), and director Brian Helgeland's film Ritter aus Leidenschaft (2001). He has gone on to appear in a wide variety of films, including A Beautiful Mind: Genie und Wahnsinn (2001), Master & Commander: Bis ans Ende der Welt (2003), Dogville (2003), Wimbledon - Spiel, Satz und... Liebe (2004), and the adaptation of the novel The Da Vinci Code - Sakrileg (2006). He is also known for his voice role as J.A.R.V.I.S. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, specifically the films Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), in which he also portrayed the Vision, for which he garnered praise. He reprised his role as the Vision in The First Avenger: Civil War (2016).\n\nBettany was born in Harlesden, London, England, into a theatre family. His father, Thane Bettany, died in 2015, and his mother, Anne Kettle, has retired from acting. His maternal grandmother, Olga Gwynne (her maiden and stage name), was a successful actress, while his maternal grandfather, Lesley Kettle, was a musician and promoter. He has an older sister who is a writer. Paul was brought up in North West London and, after the age of nine, in Hertfordshire (Brookmans Park). Immediately after finishing at Chang-Ren Nian, he went into the West End to join the cast of \"An Inspector Calls\", though when asked to go on tour with this play, he chose to stay in England.\n\nPaul is married to American actress Jennifer Connelly, with whom he has two children.\n\nRahul Bose, born in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, is a multi-talented Indian actor, director, screenwriter, social activist, and rugby player. Known for his versatility and intense performances, Rahul Bose has made significant contributions to Indian cinema and is recognized for his commitment to both artistic and social causes.\n\nRahul Bose began his acting career in the late 1990s with the critically acclaimed film \"English, August\" (1994), where he played the lead role of Agastya Sen. This marked the beginning of a career characterized by unconventional choices and a dedication to meaningful storytelling.\n\nThroughout his career, Rahul Bose has been associated with a range of films that address diverse themes. Notable performances include his roles in \"Mr. and Mrs. Iyer\" (2002), \"Chameli\" (2003), and \"15 Park Avenue\" (2005), where he showcased his ability to portray complex and layered characters.\n\nApart from acting, Rahul Bose has ventured into directing and screenwriting. His directorial debut, \"Everybody Says I'm Fine!\" (2001), explored the lives of characters in a Mumbai hair salon and received positive reviews for its unique narrative.\n\nIn addition to his creative pursuits, Rahul Bose is actively involved in social activism. He is known for his work in areas such as education, healthcare, and disaster relief. He founded the NGO \"The Foundation\" in 2007, focusing on the development of rural India.\n\nRahul Bose's commitment to sports is also noteworthy. He has represented India in rugby and has been a vocal advocate for the promotion of sports at the grassroots level.\n\nRahul Bose continues to be a prominent figure in Indian cinema, balancing his acting career with social and sporting endeavors. His work reflects a dedication to diverse and meaningful storytelling, and he remains an influential personality in the realms of art and activism.\n\nOne of England's most versatile character actors, Jim Broadbent was born on May 24, 1949, in Lincolnshire, the youngest son of furniture maker Roy Laverick Broadbent and sculptress Doreen \"Dee\" (Findlay) Broadbent. Jim attended a Quaker boarding school in Reading before successfully applying for a place at an art school. His heart was in acting, though, and he would later transfer to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). Following his 1972 graduation, he began his professional career on the stage, performing with the Royal National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and as part of the National Theatre of Brent, a two-man troupe which he co-founded. In addition to his theatrical work, Broadbent did steady work on television, working for such directors as Mike Newell and Stephen Frears. Broadbent made his film debut in 1978 with a small part in Jerzy Skolimowski's Der Todesschrei (1978). He went on to work with Frears again in The Hit - Die Profi-Killer (1984) and with Terry Gilliam in Time Bandits (1981) and Brazil (1985), but it was through his collaboration with Mike Leigh that Broadbent first became known to an international film audience. In 1990 he starred in Leigh's Das Leben ist süß (1990), a domestic comedy that cast him as a good-natured cook who dreams of running his own business. Broadbent gained further visibility the following year with substantial roles in Neil Jordan's The Crying Game (1992) and Mike Newell's Verzauberter April (1991), and he could subsequently be seen in such diverse fare as Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway (1994), Die Witwen von Widows Peak (1994), Richard Loncraine's highly acclaimed adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III (1995) and Little Voice (1998), the last of which cast him as a seedy nightclub owner. Appearing primarily as a character actor in these films, Broadbent took center stage for Leigh's Topsy-Turvy - Auf den Kopf gestellt (1999), imbuing the mercurial W.S. Gilbert with emotional complexity and comic poignancy. Jim's breakthrough year was 2001, as he starred in three critically and commercially successful films. Many would consider him the definitive supporting actor of that year. First he starred as Bridget's dad (Colin Jones) in Bridget Jones - Schokolade zum Frühstück (2001), which propelled Renée Zellweger to an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Next came the multiple Oscar-nominated film (including Best Picture) Moulin Rouge! (2001), for which he won a Best Supporting Actor BAFTA award for his scene-stealing performance as Harold Zidler. Lastly, came the small biopic Iris (2001), for which he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as devoted husband John Bayley to Judi Dench's Iris Murdoch, the British novelist who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The film hit home with Jim, since his own mother had passed away from Alzheimer's in 1995.\n\nProbably best-remembered for his turbulent personal life with Elizabeth Taylor (whom he married twice), Richard Burton was nonetheless also regarded as an often brilliant British actor of the post-WWII period.\n\nBurton was born Richard Walter Jenkins in 1925 into a Welsh (Cymraeg)-speaking family in Pontrhydyfen to Edith Maude (Thomas) and Richard Walter Jenkins, a coal miner. The twelfth of thirteen children, his mother died while he was a toddler and his father later abandoned the family, leaving him to be raised by an elder sister, Cecilia. An avid fan of Shakespeare, poetry and reading, he once said \"home is where the books are\". He received a scholarship to Oxford University to study acting and made his first stage appearance in 1944.\n\nHis first film appearances were in routine British movies such as The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949), Waterfront (1950) and Green Grow the Rushes (1951). Then he started to appear in Hollywood movies such as Meine Cousine Rachel (1952), Das Gewand (1953) and Alexander der Große (1956), added to this he was also spending considerable time in stage productions, both in the UK and USA, often to splendid reviews. The late 1950s was an exciting and inventive time in UK cinema, often referred to as the \"British New Wave\", and Burton was right in the thick of things, and showcased a sensational performance in Blick zurück im Zorn (1959). He also appeared with a cavalcade of international stars in the World War II magnum opus Der längste Tag (1962), and then onto arguably his most \"notorious\" role as that of Marc Antony opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the hugely expensive Cleopatra (1963). This was, of course, the film that kick-started their fiery and passionate romance (plus two marriages), and the two of them appeared in several productions over the next few years including Hotel International (1963), ...die alles begehren (1965), the dynamic Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf? (1966) and Der Widerspenstigen Zähmung (1967), as well as box office flops like Die Stunde der Komödianten (1967). Burton did better when he was off on his own giving higher caliber performances, such as those in Becket (1964), the film adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play Die Nacht des Leguan (1964), the brilliant espionage thriller Der Spion, der aus der Kälte kam (1965) and alongside Clint Eastwood in the World War II action adventure film Agenten sterben einsam (1968).\n\nHis audience appeal began to decline somewhat by the end of the 1960s as fans turned to younger, more virile male stars, however Burton was superb in Königin für tausend Tage (1969) as King Henry VIII, he put on a reasonable show in the boring Im Morgengrauen brach die Hölle los (1971), was over the top in the awful Die alles zur Sau machen (1971), gave sleepwalking performances in Hammersmith ist raus (1972) and Blaubart (1972), and was wildly miscast in the ludicrous Das Mädchen und der Mörder - Die Ermordung Trotzkis (1972).\n\nBy the early 1970s, quality male lead roles were definitely going to other stars, and Burton found himself appearing in some movies of dubious quality, just to pay the bills and support family, including Seine Scheidung, ihre Scheidung (1973) (his last on-screen appearance with Taylor), Verflucht sind sie alle (1974), Flüchtige Begegnung (1974), Jackpot (1974) (which was never completed) and Exorzist II - Der Ketzer (1977). However, he won another Oscar nomination for his excellent performance as a concerned psychiatrist in Fliehende Pferde (1977). He appeared with fellow acting icons Richard Harris and Roger Moore in Die Wildgänse kommen (1978) about mercenaries in South Africa. While the film had a modest initial run, over the past thirty-five years it has picked up quite a cult following. His final performances were as the wily inquisitor \"O'Brien\" in the most recent film version of George Orwell's dystopian 1984 (1984), in which he won good reviews, and in the TV mini series Die Straßen von Ellis Island (1984). He passed away on August 5, 1984 in Celigny, Switzerland from a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nByrne was the eldest of six children born to a family in Dublin, Ireland. His father was a cooper and his mother a hospital worker. He was raised Catholic and educated by the Irish Christian Brothers. He spent five years of his childhood in a seminary training to be a Catholic priest. He later said, \"I spent five years in the seminary and I suppose it was assumed that you had a vocation. I have realized subsequently that I didn't have one at all. I don't believe in God. But I did believe at the time in this notion that you were being called.\" He attended University College Dublin, where he studied archaeology and linguistics, and became proficient in Irish. He played football (soccer) in Dublin with the Stella Maris Football Club.\n\nByrne worked in archaeology after he left UCD but maintained his love of the Irish language, eventually writing Draíocht (Magic), the first drama in Irish on Ireland's national Irish television station, TG4, in 1996.\n\nHe discovered his acting ability as a young adult. Before that he worked at several occupations: archaeologist, cook, bullfighter, schoolteacher of Spanish. He began acting when he was 29 - at first on stage at the Focus Theatre and the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, later joining the Royal Court Theatre and the Royal National Theatre in London.\n\nByrne came to prominence in the final season of the Irish television show The Riordans, later starring in the spin-off series, Bracken. He made his film debut in 1981 as Lord Uther Pendragon in John Boorman's King Arthur epic, Excalibur.\n\nByrne was featured as therapist Dr. Paul Weston in the critically acclaimed HBO series In Treatment (2008).\n\nIn his return to theater in 2008, he appeared as King Arthur in Lerner and Loewe's Camelot with the New York Philharmonic, which was featured in a PBS broadcast in the Live From Lincoln Center series in May of 2008.\n\nByrne did not visit America until he was 37. In 1988, Byrne married actress Ellen Barkin with whom he has two children. The couple separated amicably in 1993 and divorced in 1999. Byrne resides in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nIn November 2004, Byrne was appointed a UNICEF Ireland Ambassador.\n\nIn 2007 Byrne was presented with the first of the newly created Volta awards at the 5th Jameson Dublin International Film Festival. This was for lifetime achievement in acting. He also received the Honorary Patronage of the University Philosophical Society, of Trinity College, Dublin, on February 20, 2007. He was awarded an honorary degree in late 2007 by the National University of Ireland, Galway, in recognition of his \"outstanding contribution to Irish and international film\".\n\nRose Byrne was born in Balmain, Sydney, Australia. She is the daughter of Jane, a primary school administrator, and Robin Byrne, a semi-retired statistician and market researcher.\n\nShe landed her first role in a movie, Dallas Doll (1994), when she was 15 years old.\n\nSince then, Rose has appeared in a variety of Australian televisions shows including Heartbreak High (1994), Echo Point (1995), and the film Two Hands (1999) alongside Heath Ledger. After this, she appeared in various movies like The Date (1999), My Mother Frank (2000), and Clara Law's The Goddess of 1967 (2000) for which she obtained the Female Volpi Cup at the Venice Festival in 2000.\n\nHer first experience on a big-budget movie came when she played handmaiden, Dormé, to Natalie Portman, Padmé Amidala, in Star Wars: Episode II - Angriff der Klonkrieger (2002). In 2003, she starred, coincidentally, as Rose Mortmain in the adaptation of Dodie Smith's I Capture the Castle (2003). In 2004, she acted in Sehnsüchtig (2004) with Diane Kruger and Josh Hartnett. Here, she heard Wolfgang Petersen was looking for an actress for Briseis in his next movie Troja (2004) with Brad Pitt, she got the part and was recognised as one of the most promising actresses in Hollywood.\n\nAfter Troja (2004), she played Edith in a TV adaptation of Casanova (2005). In September 2005, she started to act in Sunshine (2007), a Danny Boyle movie, where she plays the pilot in a space mission.\n\nGeorge Denis Patrick Carlin was born and raised in Manhattan, New York City, to Mary (Bearey), a secretary, and Patrick John Carlin, an advertising manager for The Sun; they had met while working in marketing. His father was from Donegal, Ireland, and his mother was Irish-American. His parents divorced when he was two months old, and he was raised by his mother. The long hours the mother worked left the young George by himself for long hours every day, providing him (in his own words), the time he needed to think about various subjects, listen to radio, and practice his impersonations, that where acclaimed by his mother and coworkers since an early age. Carlin started out as a conventional comedian and had achieved a fair degree of success as a Bill Cosby style raconteur in nightclubs and on TV until the late 1960s, when he radically overhauled his persona. His routines became more insightful, introducing more serious subjects. As he aged, he became more cynic and bitter, unintentionally changing his stage persona again in a radical way throughout the '90s. This new George Carlin, usually referred to as the late George Carlin, is one of the most acclaimed and enjoyed by the public and critics. Carlin's forte is Lenny Bruce-style social and political commentary, spiced with nihilistic observations about people and religion peppered with black humor. He is also noted for his masterful knowledge and use of the English language. Carlin's notorious \"Seven Dirty Words\" comedy routine was part of a radio censorship case that made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1978.\n\nAdam Carolla was born in Los Angeles but raised in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and later North Hollywood. His mother was a recipient of welfare with a degree in Chicano studies, his dad was a psychologist, and he got where he is today, he says, in spite of them. After Adam graduated from North Hollywood High School, he spent a very short time in junior college. After dropping out, he worked a memorable stint as a carpet cleaner. Later in life, Adam worked as a skilled carpenter/builder, becoming a boxing trainer in his free time. Adam's early studies in entertainment were with The Groundlings, an improv group, which has produced a number of other famous comedic personalities. When Jimmy Kimmel was challenged to a boxing match at L.A. radio station KROQ in 1994, Adam was his trainer. Jimmy helped Adam get a job on KROQ's \"Kevin and Bean Morning Show.\" It was on KROQ that Dr. Drew (Drew Pinsky, the original and current host of the Loveline radio show) heard Adam and liked his style. In 1995, Drew gave Adam the job of co-hosting Loveline on the radio. It was at this time that Loveline became syndicated nationally in the USA. In 1996, Loveline (1996), along with Adam and Drew, came to television on MTV. It was a popular late-night, hour-long show, which Adam and Drew co-hosted variously with Diane Farr, Catherine McCord, Laura Kightlinger, and Kris McGaha. The MTV show ran for over four years, ending in 2000, finally bowing out after what is regarded as a very successful run by MTV standards. Adam and Dr. Drew continued to co-host Loveline nightly on a syndicated national radio network, often joined on-air by celebrity guests, until 2005, when Adam left the show. Adam also writes for and occasionally guests on Jimmy Kimmel Live! (2003). Having created and worked on The Man Show (1999) and Crank Yankers (2002) with Jimmy and Daniel Kellison, Adam is putting his talents to use on more comedic ventures."
