Red ones were worth 1/10 of a penny, green ones worth 1/2 a penny)\n\nThis twenty-five cents would get you a double feature and a bunch of cartoons to boot.\n\nOn April 4, 2001, I posted a few memories I had of growing up in St. Louis. I received so many great replies that I thought I'd post some of them here.\n\nOriginal Post from Dave Lossos\n\nI remember when my phone number was Mohawk 2343\n\nI remember going to see a double feature at the Ritz Theater for 25 cents.\n\nI remember coming into the movie in the middle and eventually saying to the person I was with \"This is where we came in\".\n\nI remember the way to get your friend to come out to play was to stand in front of their house and yell their name (was this a St. Louis thing?).\n\nI remember the first time I had the nerve to wear \"bermuda shorts\".\n\nI remember getting all the news I needed from a St. Louis publication called \"Prom Magazine\".\n\nI remember (as a ten year old) being sent to the corner tavern to get my grandma a pail of draft beer.\n\nI remember riding the Grand Avenue electric street cars.\n\nI remember riding my bike in Tower Grove Park (even after dark!).\n\nResponses from Tony - 1/4/2005\n\nI went to St. Pius V grade school where we were taught almost exclusively by nuns (the Sisters of Loretto). Back then I always thought they were something of a cross between Zorro and a Nazi. It took me many years to realize the tremendous and positive impact they made on my life. Thank you sisters, wherever you are ! There are almost no nuns left in schools. My secret kid wish came true - and now I regret it.\n\nMom would send me to the corner store, we called it a \"confectionary\", every corner had one back then, for a loaf of Colonial bread $.25 and a fudge-cicle $.05\n\nDrinking out of water faucets on the sides of houses of people we didn't know in the summer when we were sweating our brains out (we always made sure to turn off the water when we were done).\n\nCutting a lawn for a buck fifty. (For a two family flat we got $2.00) and then we'd spend it on Silly Putty which was the newest wonder-toy in the kid world.\n\nModel car contests at the Woolworth on South Grand.\n\nTexas Bruce and the Wranglers Club on channel 5, Cookie and The Captain on channel 4, and Captain 11's Showboat - channel 11.\n\nThat Oriental yoyo guy who visited the schools to promote yoyos. Remember the \"Around the world\" and the \"walk the dog\" tricks? And you just weren't cool unless you had a \"sleeper\" yoyo.\n\nSchool picknicks at The Chain of Rocks Amusement Park ... my mom got sick accompaying me in the \"Riding\" (as opposed to \"walking\") spook house when I was 8. *LOL*\n\nWhen the worst thing a grade school kid could do was smoke a cigarette. Which brought quick and certain corporal punishment ... which no one questioned ... including the kid.\n\nThanks Dave Lossos for a wonderful website ! Thank you SO much !\n\nResponses from Dawn Voss - 1/14/2005\n\nI remember penny candy - each piece was a penny.\n\nI remember 5-cent candy bars and postage stamps.\n\nI remember 10-cent public pay phones, bus rides, and either 12- or 16-ounce bottles of Coca-Cola.\n\nI remember when a matinee cost 75 cents.\n\nI remember when a drive-in movie cost 75 cents per car.\n\nI remember when an organist played for the audience before the movie began.\n\nI remember when our zip code consisted of two digits.\n\nI remember when my phone number began with \"Jackson,\" followed by five digits.\n\nI remember hearing about the death of someone named Marilyn (Monroe).\n\nI remember President Kennedy's funeral procession.\n\nI remember when man landed on the moon.\n\nI remember black and white television and its \"turn dial.\"\n\nI remember a three-color screen that could be placed, somehow, in front of the black and white TV to simulate color television before everybody could afford a color TV. The three colors (hues, actually) were stacked horizontally on the screen, so as to allow one to view what was actually on the TV screen.\n\nI remember a small earthquake that shook St. Louis in the late '60s.\n\nI remember details that were brought home from the war (Vietnam).\n\nI remember what life was like without air-conditioning and wall-to-wall carpet.\n\nI remember when girls had to wear dresses or skirts in school - and it was a public school system. Boys had to wear slacks (not denim jeans) and leather shoes (not sports shoes). Eventually Keds tennis-shoes were allowed.\n\nResponses from Christy - 1/21/2005\n\nDawn Voss reminded me of the small earthquake in the 60's! I remember being around 8 or 9, running down the basement steps, while the stairs shook under me. I can still remember trying to keep my balance and seeing everything around me as one giant blurry vibration, and being terrified. Then later I remember all the neighbors standing around out on the street (Karess Drive in Bellefontaine Neighbors) discussing it. I believe it was our neighbor across the street - Mrs. Smith - who told us it had been an earth tremor.\n\nI also remember the regular tornado warnings during the summers growing up. The sky would turn this eerie grayish green. Tornado warnings also struck terror in my heart (I was a rather timid kid). My brother and I had a tornado routine - we'd each pull \"our\" dresser drawer out of our dresser in the bedroom, that held our most cherished possessions and some of our clothes, and carry them down to the basement that my parents kept stocked with \"tornado supplies\" - boxes of canned goods, drinking water, candles, plus holy water!\n\nI also remember visiting my Grandma (and Grandpa before he died) on my dad's side, just about every Sunday. They lived in Lemay on Placid Street. I remember us kids would go to the Hancock School and play around the school. It was like our \"thing\" when we went to Grandma's. And how close the houses were to each other, and the neighbor ladies would stand at the windows on the sides of the houses, and be able to talk to each other without having to raise their voices.\n\nResponses from Helen Snyder- 1/26/2005\n\nLove the memories; I have a few to add:\n\nI remember when Catholic school only had nuns, no \"lay teachers\" and what a shock seeing one was. I ruined my knees playing jump rope at St. Roch's asphalt playground.\n\nI remember the lamplighter on Theodore Avenue, the incinerator out back in the alley, and the smells of St. Louis, I loved the smell of burning leaves.\n\nEvery spring all the walls had to be washed, the carpets were hung on the clothes line and beaten. Wash was done in a wringer washer, white clothes first, then lights, etc., usually using the same water.\n\nMashing potatoes was done with a masher, whipping egg whites was done by hand with a wire whip. Everything was fried and gravy was wonderful. We ran all that stuff off and were skinny. Oh, I hated stewed tomatoes and the COD LIVER OIL phase.\n\nGrandma called in her order to the grocery store and they DELIVERED it. Summers were spent in the basement drinking beer and smoking. Grandma would hide in the kitchen and drink a beer and smoke a cigarette some time in the afternoon. It was not appropriate for her to just sit down and do that.\n\nGrandma and Grandpa lived through the Great Depression. \"Almost all the families on our block lost their homes but we didn't. I stood on my feet 13 hours a day in the store just in case someone would come in and buy something.\" They learned to hoard. She started work as an 8 year old in a garment factory.\n\nBe glad if you don't remember when mothers were supposed to give their children enemas. Mom did that once; I think it constitutes abuse not tomention mess and fear. Good mothers cleaned their children on the inside too. Rather have the cod liver oil. Oh, I hated spinich too.\n\nEverything was freshly cooked and sometimes the pressure cooker flew around the kitchen. \"Hey, watch out\". Oh, look at that mess. Wallpaper was put on in layers and never removed. Once we removed 7 layers of wallpaper in our \"new house\". It was all dark too. Modern women painted the walls.\n\nCowboys only smiled at the girl. There was no bad language on the tube; people dressed up to go out; nobody sued. We were taught to forgive.\n\nResponses from Rich- 1/31/2005\n\nhello... enjoying your st. louis memories site here & i noticed mention of sandy's... The Sandy's in Rock Hill, the first McDonald's in Crestwood (and their sign stating \"over 80,000 sold\"),\n\ni have the unofficial sandy's website www.geocities.com/sandyshamburgers if you click on the locations icon, you will notice that sandy's #2 location was st. louis. i am looking for pictures and memories of that location and just touching base with you to see if any are available or if you could keep an eye open and let me know in the future if any show up. the founders of sandy's opened one of the first mcdonalds franchises east of the mississippi and then broke ranks with ray krok. originally there were to be four sandy's locations (one for each of the founders) and st. louis sandy's was #2. it appears from your site that it was in a section of the city called rock hill.\n\nthanks! - rich\n\nResponses from Terry C . 1/31/2005\n\nRitenour High ''Class of 70\"\n\nHarrison 7-6259 ; New Overland Elementary / Ritenour Junior High\n\nGrew up in Overland on Annapolis Ave. and later in St. Ann by Hoech Jr. High.

Early up, down the tracks to town, Valley Park bus to the Maplewood loop, Manchester bus to Grand Avenue, streetcar to Sportsmanâs Park. \"Knothole Club\" cards gained entry to the upper deck, left field corner. That suited us just fine. We left hoarse and sad, the Browns always lost.\n\nThe Babe was said to skip batting practice to pitch pennies with kids under the stands.\n\nThat was before our time, but we did sometimes see players at the hot dog stands. Don's favorite, leftie Vern Stevens, had been traded to the Red Sox so when Don spotted him he hustled over for an autograph. Then, remembering his manners, he turned back to get the other guy's too. Ted Williams was amused.\n\nThe Maplewood loop, terminus for several lines, was an open half-block of gravel where green and cream county busses circled before reversing course. The larger red and cream city busses stayed outside, stopping along the street. Across was the Maplewood Theater, facade festooned with blue paper icicles and âitâs cool insideâ signs. To the west was the Foot Long Hot Dog stand.\n\nThe loop pharmacy, smelling as all pharmacies did, of wood, nostrums and treats, anchored the loop. Black and chrome soda fountain, oak floor, oak wall cabinets, oak and glass display cases filled with every sort of merchandise, pharmacist presiding from the raised, altar-like platform in the rear. To the north was the donut shop. Donuts spilling off the conveyor belt, fresh from the oven, like the panis of sweet-toothed angelicum. Hot sweetness dissolving in the mouth. Mecca for bus drivers and us.P...Ã¿\n\nResponses from Bev 4/25/2005\n\nWhat a great sight. I grew up in South St. Louis - 4404 Beck Avenue - MOhawk 4-0601 was our telephone number. Went to Oak Hill Elementry on Morganford...went to Charlies Confectionery or Ollie's across the street for penny candy almost everyday and of course we walked everywhere. I had Mrs. Flowers too, and Mr. Norman, Mrs. Milford (she was really old) and Mr. Earlinger. Now that really strains the memory.\n\nThere were ten of us that went to the show every weekend-the Granada or the Avalon - saw double features-news-cartoons, etc. What fun and we walked.\n\nWe saw Famous Barr Southtown being built and could not wait until it was opened.\n\nMy parents went to the corner tavern on Kingshighway - Charlie's and my sister and I could play the jutebox and dance.\n\nMy parents took us to the Veiled Prophet parade every year and for a big treat we stopped at White Castles on our way back from visiting our Grandparents.\n\nWe went to the Highlands every year for our school picinic and road the roller coster a million times.\n\nWent roller skating at the arena (took a bus) and of course went to the zoo to see Phil the Gorilla.\n\nWhat great times....thanks for the memories.\n\nResponses from Tracy 5/8/2005\n\nMy name is Tracey, I was born in St. Louis at Deaconess Hospital and was raised in the south side of St. Louis (Dutchtown). I lived on South 38th St. down Grand and Meramac. I attended Skruggs School, people used to say Skruggs, Skruggs full of bugs. I left before High School because my dad joined the army.\n\nA friend of mine down the street the Heitman's had a brother the delivered newspapers out of a wooden crate like box. We used to go for walks with my mom and dad toting us kids around in a radio flyer wagon to Ted Drews on Grand. Within walking distance MMMMM......Later my parents moved to the Bingham Apartments and my grandmother worked at Cleveland High School. Then there was a daily trip to Ted Drews and then off to the doctor for a diet. For every A we got on our report cards we got a free ice cream cone(actually frozen custard).\n\nWe would occassionally eat at Western Bowl and make trips to the penny candy store. I remember nickle and dimeing my grandma to pieces. Sometimes we would go to Crondellette Park and swing and watch the barges go by. My brothers and I used to go to Marquette Park for preschool. They called it Tiny Tots when I was little I also took dancing lessons there.\n\nI also remember the sales tax tokens and S&H green stamps. When we lived on 38th street it was still made of cobble stone, I remembered when it would rain and slipping on it while our mom tried to get us in the car to go shopping. Mom would take us to lunch at Burger Chef, we liked it because our burgers came in little baggies.\n\nMy friend Connie's Mom and Dad owned John and Shirley's up in the Soularde area. Her dad also owned a meals on wheels. I remember safely walking the alley ways too, but we were told to be very careful around the gangways. My mom worked for Prince Gardener and later worked with my grandmother at Sears on Grand. My dad and grandfather worked for McDonnell-Douglas as plastic tool builders.\n\nToday My brother Marty works for Luthern Hospital as a nurse, a highly dangerous job now. He'd been held at gun point for a cigarette recently. He's ok though. My younger brother Brook currently works for the VP Organization designing and building the floats for the annual parades and helps with the Fair. He's a pretty well known artist up there. He also graduated from Vaschon High School as a Valedictorian.\n\nMy favorite vendors on Broadway were the pretzel guys selling bags of fresh stick pretzels on the corners and the Hot Tamale Vendor, some of the best I've ever tasted.

Attending St. Phillip Neri school. Nuns that would slap you with a ruler if you misbehaved. The worst bad behavior then was chewing gum or not folding your hands in front of you perfectly as you stood in line. My friend since 1st grade, Marilyn, who is still my friend for 44 yrs.\n\nThe Arch being built. We'd go downtown for the day and look at it as we arrived downtown then again later the same day to see if they got any further. Kids thought it was built a little faster then it really was.

Only I crammed them all into a few weeks when I visited in the summer time from Dallas. No doubt I will drop in from time to time at this site to share some thoughts.\n\nResponses from Anonymous 5/19/2005\n\nThanks Dave for your web site neat stuff! I am only 38 and I was raised in the suburbs in Jefferson county but I spent much time in the city where my Grandparents lived between Jamesion and Mcausland. I remember taking the Mcausland/delor bus to go to Venture on cristy and Kingshighway or to maplewood the opposite side of the street bus stop to Kmart or to Bluesteins to get my husky size pants it was always my job to pull that red cord to make the bus driver stop! I think I did that a few times when I wasn't suppose too! I remember going to Hampton village getting white castle,Ted Drewes, Beatermans was down the street we would circle back to lansdowne hit the drug store for whatever was ailing Gramps and Grams, For Gramps usually a 5th of OJC whiskey and Grams some rolaids or citrate of magnesia and cigarettes for both and a squirt gun for me and my brother and sister. Late in the evening a crowd would start to form in my Grandparents front yard and everyone brought their lawn chairs and they would gather around an old foldgers can and flip their cigarette butts into it and shoot the breeze about the old times, the horse races, politics etc. while all the kids in the neighborhood played flashlight tag and captured numerous lightning bugs. I used to take a break and tell the adults gathered around jokes and they would give me their pocket change. I was a big ham! but it bought my Hotwheel cars and candy. yeah the memories I remember the big slide and bumper cars on J.B. Libertys Grocery parking lot, going down to see the circus train for Barnum and Bailys at the Arena, Going downtown at Christmas to look at all the decorated windows, going back to the house and marking down everything I wanted in the JcPenny catalog.I spent every Christmas in St.Louis we always had to wait for my aunt to get home on Christmas eve from Boyds Mens store Downtown ahh the anticipaction!!! I could go on and on. The Old timers are gone now and I miss them deeply but the stories and memories they left me with will live on . I encourage all the elders out there to write down what you did where you lived and how it was all of it and pass it on to everyone! Great site thanks\n\nResponses from Bill Weaver 5/25/2005\n\nTaking a stroll down memory lane. I was born in East St Louis UPTON-3-0211. Let's not forget, KXOX 630 radio's Johnny Rabbit live from Styx Bare and Fuller every Saturday morning, that was after a quick shopping trip to Gary's music shop at the old downtown bi-state bus station. Then the December Tornado of 1969, and of course Harry Carry when he announced for the Cardinals. Holiday Hills amusement park, and Chain of Rocks, the Highlands burnt down 1 year before I was old enough to ride the big coaster, but 10 cents and a nickel transfer got you from east St. Louis to the park on the bus. Lou Brock got a Dodger dealership in East St. Louis, and Curt Flood quit because he didn't want to be \"Traded\". No Casinos, but every malt shop had a Bingo pinball machine, for amusement only, of course. I'm 50 now and living in Houston Texas, but I was still able to sneak into the Grand Burlesque with my fake I.D. Thanks for the memories, and I hope you enjoyed some of mine.\n\nResponses from Sharon Mertz Thomason 5/27/2005\n\nI grew up in south st Louis - I remember soulard library,farmer's market on saturday and South Broadway - shopping on So Broadway meant walking past the place where all the live chickens were waiting to be bought for someone's Sunday dinner. going to Barnholtz's drygood store for school clothes, Loberbaums furniture to pay your parents furniture payment and Rosenthal's shoe store to get shoes and have you feet x-rayed right through your shoes. Ben Franklin dime store, and the Apache theater where you would see 2 movies on a saturday afternoon - Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein. Sunday morning going to church at St.Vincent's Catholic Church and then riding your bike all afternoon with your friends. Famous Barr at Christmas - sitting on Santa's lap and then getting your prize through the clown's mouth. Forest Park Highlands, the comet roller coaster the bobslides the spook house, Art hill and the mueseums. most of all always feeling safe no matter where you were. what happened to that feeling of security? riding the bus downtown by yourself and no one worrying about you as long as you remembered to be home on time. chiliburgers at the counter of Ben Franklin's dime store before going to the saturday afternoon matinee. I tell my kids about all this, but they can't really understand it because they have grown up being told not to go anywhere alone and be careful of strangers - I don't live in st.Louis anymore, but I will never forget and always remember how great it was. I do go back once in awhile and it is wonderful to see some of the old nieghborhoods being recovered by people who seem to appreciate the history of it all. Thanks\n\nResponses from Ken Volk 5/27/2005\n\nLast evening some guys and I were having a few beers after a Lodge meeting when someone began reminiscing.\n\nI believe it began when a guy said that his kids and especially his grandkids would not believe that they didn't have many things in the home that we now take for granted.\n\nThings like phones, indoor johns, automatic hot water, and the like. One guy mentioned ash pits and this AM I searched Yahoo for ash pits, then added alley and finally added St. Louis. Eventually I reached your website.\n\nMy interest was increased when I read your original post. I do remember the Ritz, riding the Grand Avenue Streetcar to get there although living further south generally we walked to the Virginia Show. Also I think it was cheaper. I do remember the same type of phone number after we got one when I was 13.\n\nI remember the coming in at middle of a movie and unless it was very good leaving when that point came up the next time. Also yelling someone's name, which was good as if 8 people lived there they knew who you wanted, the Prom magazine, going for beer for my grandparents, but we rode our bikes in Tower Grove Park.\n\nOne day when I was about 6, 1939/40, and staying at my grandmas, a neighbor boy's Dad took us for a ride in his convertible. Since we didn't even have a car this was a treat. He stopped and bought us cones at Velvet Freeze, then drove us to Carondelet Park and we sat on a bench looking at the boat lake. A fer minutes later a 'Parkie', (Park Policeman) came along and told the boys Dad he had to leave as he was clad in an undershirt.\n\nYour Bermuda shorts line got me, as one day in my 20's I wandered through Sears on Grand and saw a pair of almost knee length shorts hanging on a display for fifty cents. I bought a pair and although not a golfer had agreed to go play at Forest Park with some friends. I must have agreed after 2 many beers one night. I showed up in shorts and for the first 30 minutes the rest of the foursome demanded I go home and change or not go along. I believe I was a trend setter in my area wearing shorts. I kept wearing them and then many others also wore them.\n\nI could probably type away for hours.\n\nRemembering with the rest of you I am;\n\nKen Volk, 71+, St. Cecilia's grade school, St. Mary's and Cleveland High School, sold papers on Grand and Delor in 1947, on Sundays at Resurrection Church 1948-49.\n\nKen Volk, Sr. 10588 Copperfield, St. Louis, MO 63123 Grandfather, Mainframe Programmer, COBOL and most DB/DC, Barbershop Quartet Singer, Bass and Baritone, St Louis #1 Chapter, Elk, Crestwood MO Lodge #2503, Pilot\n\nResponses from Gina 6/12/2005\n\nI grew up in Pine Lawn on Council Grove. There was a beautiful tree they said where Indians used to have their council meetings. We went to the Little Playhouse Dancing School on Jennings Road and there was a wonderful little bakery -- Hilberts== where you could buy little squares of coffee cake -- peanut, cheese and crumb for only 15 c a square. Wonderful. This was in the forties and fifties, of course.\n\nResponses from Tom Ruppel, Dixon, CA, St. Mary's 1967 6/12/2005\n\nI left St. Louis on a boot camp-bound train from Union Station on Nov. 8, 1968, after I had foolishly turned 19 without a draft deferment (this was pre-lottery). I've spent my whole adult life in California and probably will die out here, but I'll never forget growing up in South St. Louis. I really enjoyed reading your reminiscences. I've been through the old neighborhood a few times over the years and it, like myself, is getting a little long in the tooth. Abkemeier - later Everding - Dairy, two doors down from our house, is now some kind of recycling center. The cement yard next to the MoPac tracks is gone. The coal yard is covered over by apartments. We used to ride our bikes to Carondelet Park to catch crawdads hiding in the rocks at Boat Lake. We'd stop on the way at Hobart's Market and Mr. Hobart would give us our bait: a slab of bloody liver wrapped in white butcher's paper. We'd cut it into chunks and dangle it from strings to entice the little suckers out from their lairs. I visited the Missouri Historical Society museum a couple of years ago and found that Tony the Scissors Grinder's push cart was there, as was a display on corkball. A few years ago, a group of us worked on a charity home repair project out here and I dazzled my friends with my window glazing skills. I explained to them that, playing baseball in South St. Louis alleys, you learn how to repair garage windows. Step-ball, bottlecap ball, water balloons, lightning bugs, grape kool-aide, back yard peaches, drippy 25-cent custard cones (the big mutha) are summer memories. We called baseball cards \"flips,\" after the variety of winner-take-all games we played. \"Touch\" was the basic game; there was double touch; then touch on top of ever-smaller flat objects at ever-greater distances - like on top of an upturned bucket 20 or more feet away. Those were very high-stake games that could involve a big stack of flips changing ownership from one boy to another. Flips were six for a nickle at the drug store, which included a stale wafer of pink bubble gum. The top flip was coated with some white chalky substance from the gum (sugar, I guess) which you'd wipe off on your t-shirt. Any team flip or any Cardinal flip in your nickle pack was a big score. I've worked in Sacramento since 1988 and lived nearby as well, but I still don't know my way around. I need a map to get to Howe and Arden in Sacramento. But I can drive to just about any place in South St. Louis without even thinking about it. People destined to write are said to be born with a drop of printer's ink in their blood. Maybe South Siders are born with a drop of the River Des Peres in their blood. (OK, bad analogy).\n\nResponses from Walter R. Deyherle 6/27/2005\n\nHi David!

We were good friends, and his Daughter Gail and myself went to Lutheran High School South and graduated the same class in 1975.\n\n* Remember being called forjury duty downtown to the Civil Courts Building and watching the jury supervisor Harvey Kohn putting the jury number pills in the container, spinning the container, calling the jury panels, and some numbers twice because they were in the bathroom, or sleeping.

I've had such fun reading through this site for the past hour or so, and imagining what it must have been like in that neighborhood 50+ years ago! Someone commented that \"it seems like more young people are moving back to the old neighborhoods,\" and I think that's true. I'm hoping that my own 3 yr. Old son will have some great memories growing up in south St. Louis, and it does seem that many streets in North/South Hampton, anyway, are being revitalized by young families...lots of swingsets in backyards...that's why we chose that area. Just house hunting today, we were struck by how many strangers smiled and waved while mowing their lawns. Several of my college friends who grew up in the suburbs are choosing to raise their kids in the city. Of course, times have changed, and it seems hard to find a home now for under $150! Anyway, just wanted to chime in with my 2 cents. For those of you who have moved away, I still think it seems like a pleasant place to live!\n\nResponses from Anonymous 7/18/2005\n\nHI Dave: I'm so happy to run across your site!\n\nI grew up in Glendale, MO and attended Kirkwood Schools.\n\nMy phone number was YO5-1605 and we lived on N.

Also had a cousin down on Gibson in the city, went to McArthur's Bakery often (surprised no one has mentioned them, they're still going strong).\n\nDon McArthur used to like playing jokes on kids, he would give you some buttercream icing and warn you it might slip (and you would be eating icing for about a half hour afterwards. I remember playing cork ball in the alley, and kick ball in the street (little worries about crime, this was late 60s, early 70s). They had a bowling alley for their floor in the back.\n\nOur phone was Thumwald 53077 I believe. It was funny when you would pick up the phone and listen to another party (and they would start yelling at you when they heard you). Used to hang around Skylark Bowl, mostly playing pinball and bowling later (also Mardi Gras for a brief time at Cypress Village).\n\nI really miss Bag O' Chicken that was on the Rock Road, it went out of business after the owner was killed in a car accident.\n\nShakey's Pizza was another local favorite, as well as Orange Julius and Velvet Freeze at Northwest.\n\nMy neighbor's sons hunted rabbits where Northwest Plaza is now. My Dad said our backyard was full of rabbit ears after they started construction of Northwest.\n\nCruising Steak N Shake on Lindbergh in the late 70s in my 69 Goat (it'd pass anything but a gas station). 4 on the floor, 400 CID, Holley 650 double pumper.\n\nHood's on the Rock Road.\n\nI used to love listening to the Cardinals (Harry Caray and Jack Buck) and especially the Blues (Gus Kyle, the Blues are going left to right on your radio dial and Dan Kelley).\n\nGoing to Rexall Drug store on Rock Road while my mom was having her hair done.\n\nHaving real Cherry cokes.\n\nCollecting bottle caps (you could find them everywhere back then) and many had cork in them Hanging out with my Dad at Hank's Standard Station on Adie. It was so clean that he won a Jeep for winning cleanest service station so many times. You could eat off the floor in this place. Fishing at Dierman Lakes (now the Lakes subdivision) in O'Fallon. There was nothing out here back then.\n\nFishing in the Meramec around Arnold\n\nFishing at Rock Lake near 115 bridge (I don't miss driving over that bridge) There are still some good places in St. Louis, among them (still pretty safe during the day): Lafayette Square (Chocolate Bar, Arcelias, Ricardos), the Hill, Soulard's restaraunt, DB's, BB's, the New Cathedral. I've worked across from Eat-Rite since 1984 and have never eaten there.\n\nSpartan's on the Rock Road as well as that skating place (Palace?).\n\nResponses from John Tudenham 8/16/2005\n\nI lived in St Louis till I went in the air force in 1951, now in Joplin MO and retired, get back to St Louis about twice a year.\n\nGrew up in NW St Louis graduated from Beaumont in 1947. Remember riding the Goodfellow and Natural bridge bus to school, also attending baseball games in Sportmans park..During WW2 with gasoline rationing on, my family use to go bus riding with a Sunday pass that cost 25 cents, stop for a 5 cent White Castle hamburger or a 5 cent ice cream cone.\n\nForest park a great place to visit with Zoo, ,Muni opera etc..\n\nUse to listen nightly to KWK Radio 1380 at 615pm for the first five with Gil Newsome, also enjoyed Cardinal baseball on WIL 1230 with Harry Caray, letter on KXOK.\n\nWe lived right on the city limits line almost in Jennings, remember out a few miles was country, use to hike to North woods near Lucas Hunt Rd.. During WW2 the small arms amunition plant was only a mile from our house, remember they worked 7 days a week around the clock. I also attended Herzog school on W Florissant a brand new school then.. Use to ride my bike to school up and down hills on Goodfellow. After graduation from high school worked at Walter Ashe radio downtown on Pine street a few years, most of us rode buses in those days couldn't afford a car..\n\nLots of good memories in St Louis, we always like to return and see old friends and relatives again.\n\nResponses from Karen 8/31/2005\n\nMy father grew up on Ashland Court. He will be turning 75 soon and I am hoping some of your readers could share child hood memories of growing up in that area of St. Louis. Dad attended Benton Grade School then Hadley Technical High School (Class of 48?) Things he and mom have mentioned in the past are the Bridge Show on Natural Bridge, working at Kroeger on Natural Bridge and Shreve. The Fox movie house, Lindel Show, Tower Movie. And riding the Grand Ave Streetcar. I'll keep checking your site and hope to see some related new entries.\n\nResponses from Ron of Pine Lawn 9/2/2005\n\nI remember Ed's White Front Barbecue on the corner of Goodfellow and Natural Bridge. The BEST Barbecue in the world. The had two black gentleman what would wait on the cars if you wanted to just stay in your car. One of them was named Jake. Inside was Bernice and Herb. We would go every Friday night to get beef sandwiches and cole slaw. OOO how I wish I Knew the sauce ingredients I would give $100.00.\n\nI remember the ragman would come up and down our street with his horse and wagon and this was only in the 50's I was born in 1949.\n\nWe would go to the Studio show in Pine Lawn and walk home after the show. They would give dishes out each week. Then there was Sam the watermelon man on Natural Bridge on a hot night we would walk to get watermelon. Our phone number was Mulberry 4547 but we did not get a phone till about 1953 before that Mrs. James would have her dog run down to our house and bark till my mom would follow the dog to their house to get a phone call.\n\nEvery Saturday we would buy Cheese cake at Hilberts Bakery on Jennings road and it was totally different then todays Cheese Cake . It was in sheets about 1/4 inch high and cut on a rectangle. The only one that comes close to it is Helffer's Bakery on Graham Road in Florissant, MO.\n\nResponses from Ginia 9/9/2005\n\nI enjoyed the latest entry about Pine Lawn, because that's where I grew up. I went to Garfield Elementary School, and on to Normandy High. In those days a big yellow bus would pick us up and take us to school.\n\nWe loved Hilbert's bakery too, and haven't been able to find anything like their peanut coffee cake.\n\nResponses from Tim in Texas 9/11/2005\n\nI am younger, my phone number was JEfferson 3-7432\n\nI lived at 4375 A Laclede Ave\n\nI would walk to to be an altar boy at the 5:30 Mass at the Cathedral. We would take the Forrest Park bus everywhere from laclede and Newstead. Nanna and I would take the University City Streetcar to Clayton we would shop in Welston. Olive street still had a streetcar as did Grand Ave.\n\nSt. Louis was a great city to grow up in!\n\nResponses from Pattie 9/16/2005\n\nI grew up on Howard street downtown St Louis, well till I was 10 with a outside john then we moved to warren St, the grade school I started at was St Leo's and every year they have a Reunion, grade school isn't that great then I went to Sacred Heart and Central, I remember Horace dairy delivering our milk , in glass jars too.\n\nThe hot tamale man , Mr Black the vegetable truck that came around yelling strawberries, the neighborhood house where you went to swim and do gymnastics , chain of rocks park, and there was a restaurant Clancy that I used to love their fish sandwiches no one makes anything like it anywhere.\n\nAnd going downtown on a bus with my mom( who still doesn't drive) who is 87 to Famous & Barr to a basement sale , I miss Christmas downtown with all the windows animated and the trees frozen with white lights , I never appreciated what I had, those memories are like another life, I think that if we let them go ..we go with them, and the new generations have no idea how much fun it was to really be free.\n\nThe bakery on the corner where I lived (the Crumbs ) walking from my house to get donuts at 5..and the confectionery across the street from the Bakery. We got our first TV at 9 and I remember my Dad putting a piece of paper down the front of the TV to make it color ha ha ,I thought it was the bomb and I was the coolest kid on the block. And the Imperial Club where Ike and Tina Turner sang, later as I got older I still would go there for contest, I taught dancing then. St Louis was and is a Nostalgics city and it has soooooo much History & Solid Gold Memories, while I was reading some of the memories I started crying because nothing anywhere is like that anymore, even the small towns , the kids now days , they look at me my grandkids like I was poor living that way, I felt like the richest person in the world back then, they have no idea where the Heart is.Somehow we need to keep these memories alive, in another ten or so years we can write it off if we don't keep remembering. Sorry I rambled on I have forgotten a lot of things and I need this to remember, the drive ins too I need to shut up or I will go on and on.\n\nResponses from Walt in Gainesville 9/16/2005\n\nFor Karen who's father worked at the Kroger located at Shreve and Natural Bridge....I lived two doors/flats west at 4811a Natural Bridge. I was born in 1942 andI remeber the store and the Bridge Theatre very well. Two or three check out lanes. I doubt that it was any larger than 3,000 sq fy in size. That intersection also had a dry cleaner and I think a tavern. The Bridge Theatre cost a dime to get in (under 10 years old or so) and I remeber being shocked when I had to pay $.35 admission at some point when \"older\". I sold Post and Globe papers on the weekend and delivered a free weekly neighborhood paper too, earning credits for bikes, etc rather than cash as I recall.\n\nMy dad directed downtown taffic and later walked a beat around the DeBalivere Strip as a St. Louis cop and my mother worked across the street at Brix Florist. Until about 1954, across Natural Bridge and just east of Brix there was a second floor bowling alley and ground floor hardware store (Moelcher-Schene I think). It burned to the ground about that time. We walked all over the place. Took Sunday drives. Rode the bus alone downtown from age 6yrs. Biked the long distance through Forest Park to visit grandparents just off McCausland Ave.\n\nI attended Scullin grade school and then became part of the white flight to the suburbs (St. Ann) in 1954 where I attended Ritenour and Hoech Jr High Schools and Ritenour High School. Ironically, it was only then that I began to attend an integrated school as the Ritenour District had (apparently) desegregated earlier. At that young age we were pretty clueless about race and many times black and white kids would play together in the vacant lot next to the Bridge theatre and across Natural Bridge in a large park that had been a dump (now called a landfill). By the way, there was also a rather deep and large dump a few blocks east of Shreve along Marcus Avenue. I have a vauge recollection of it being filled and levelled. I'm sure it was developed but I don't recall how.\n\nI like St. Louis a lot and visit from time to time. I'm glad to see some North St. Louis folks posting here too.\n\nResponses from Jim Keith 9/21/2005\n\nDear Dave and all the St. Louis Memory fans,\n\nNot a week goes by that I donât check out the most recent additions to St. Louis Memories.\n\nDave, if you can use themâ¦.Iâm adding a couple of pictures, just for grins. (See Jim's images above). Old Board of Education lunch check, I seem to think they cost eight cents.\n\nA copy of that hand out they gave us during school about a possible H-BOMB attackâ¦and that map. If you could make it to\n\nThe Meramec, you would liveâ¦â¦â¦â¦..Just try catching a bus to the Meramec River from Russell Blvd.\n\nAnd, for meâ¦a fond memory of my patrol boy daysâ¦.at Sherman School at 3942 Flad in south St. Louis.

I guess not that little, because, you Memories writers seem to bring upâ¦.THOSE LITTLE THINGS\n\nthat were and are so important to you and usâ¦at that timeâ¦..that we still remember them.\n\nSo, in time, Good Lord providingâ¦â¦my kids and grandkidsâ¦..will know all about the Merry Widow theater, Clinton Peabody projects, walking across the\n\nMcArthur Bridge, playing on the Admiral, smelling the odor of 22 gunshots at the Highlands and all those little memories that will be goneâ¦once Iâm gone.\n\nI am the only personâ¦.with MY memories. Please share YOUR memories, the little thingsâ¦â¦with your children, grandchildrenâ¦..and with us.\n\nResponses from Karen Vehlewald 9/21/2005\n\nI really enjoyed reading about everyone's memories.\n\nI wish there were some from south county. I am a Lemay girl.\n\nWilds Palace of Poison was a great hang out.\n\nThe Halloween parade on Lemay Ferry Rd.was a blast. Going to the Lemay, Longwood and Southway shows was so much fun.

Hanging out at LBA. during the summer.\n\nEveryone went to Posaloskies store on Lemay Ferry.\n\nStopping at TipTop for a hamburger on a Friday night. Capri swimming pool in the summer was a must.\n\nA trip to Mt Olive cemetery to see the glass top coffin was always fun to show to new people in the area.\n\nHope to come back often and read new memories.\n\nResponses from Sandy in California 9/22/2005\n\nI love your website, Dave. It's great to see so many others have the fond memories of growing up in St. Louis like myself. Even though I've been in California for the past 30 years, there is nothing like the nostalgia of growing up in St. Louis. Even my best friend from first grade is still my best friend...and she still lives in St. Louis! Great to read about the memories others have growing up in South St. Louis.\n\nI remember my phone number was Prospect 3-7123. Since it was a party line we had to check first to see if anyone else was using it.\n\nI remember walking home from Shenandoah Grade School for the 'hot lunch' my mother would fix for me every day.\n\nI remember my mother giving me a nickle to buy candy at the confectionary on the way back to school.\n\nI remember when 'eating out' meant going to the Steak 'n Shake drive-in.\n\nI remember taking the bus downtown every Saturday with my mother and having lunch at The Forum. She finally learned to drive at 72.\n\nI remember taking the Grand Ave. streetcar every Wed. to dance classes with Mr. Dugger across from Gaslight Square.\n\nI remember walking to the Grand Ave. Library from Virginia and Magnolia...by myself.\n\nI remember going to the 'watermelon stand' on Gravois St. during the summer. It was where everyone from Roosevelt High School hung out.\n\nI remember Velvet Freeze and ice cream.\n\nI remember the Shenandoah School picnic at the Highlands.\n\nI remember marching in downtown parades as a majorette with the Shenandoah Drum and Bugle Corps.\n\nI remember the 'strawberry man' pushing his cart down my street.\n\nI remember sledriding after school in Resevoir Park on Grand Ave after a big snow fall. I also remember what a tough uphill climb that was!\n\nI remember what a treat it was when my dad took us to Art Hill to sledride.\n\nI remember ice skating on the Tower Grove Park lagoons and the bonfires to keep you warm.\n\nI remember Friday and Saturday night teen towns.\n\nThe list could go on and on...what a great place to grow up!\n\nResponses from Bill 9/29/2005\n\nEnjoyed your history of incidental things in St Louis. Heres a few more:\n\n1. Going to the Forest Park Highlands and riding the airplane swing, the flying turns, and racing derby.\n\n2. Going to see the Cardinals and Browns using my free knothole game card. I could ride the Delmar streetcar and transfer to the Grand car for 5 cents each way to and from the game. I could leave my house and see a double header and come home for 10 cents.\n\n3. A triple feature at the Pageant theater on Saturday for 10 cents\n\n4. Joe Garavelli's restaurant had some signs hanging in it. One said \"Don't talk to the motorman\" and another \"No Checks cashed\"Does anyone remember the other ones?\n\n5. Does anyone remember the year posted on the clock at Moll's Grocery?(Since xxxx)\n\n6. Billy \"Zoot\" Reed\n\n7. Before the plastic mills- the zinc mills and before that paper mills\n\n8. A triple dip cone at Rapp's grocery for 5 cents.\n\n9. My phone number was Rosedale 1871.\n\n10. How about Green Lea ice cream parlor across the street from Velvet Freeze on DeBalivere and DeGiverville. They had the best ice cream. Also the Fountain at Pevely Dairy where you could eat your ice cream and watch the colored lights in the fountain.\n\n11. What about the Opera in Forest Park - we had season tickets in the second row of the 50 cent seats. Can you believe. Box seats were $2,50 and there were \"free\" seats also.\n\n12. Dizzy Dean broadcasting Brownie games and the school teachers getting upset with his grammar.\n\n13. The trading of Enos \"Country\" Slaughter to the Yankees. (I have not had a Bush beer since)\n\n14. Going to the Zoo and spending the day and seeing all the shows for free.\n\nResponses from Bob 9/29/2005\n\nFrom way out in Redding, CA, I stumbled across your web site and got a good picture of how old I really am............\n\nNot much humidity out here, so when I've been back to St. Louis, always feels like I need to change my shirt by the time I get to the car. Out here they whine when it gets over 25%.\n\nOur family was an odd one. We moved from the suburbs (Dellwood/Ferguson area) to SW City (Scanlan near Jamieson) in '64. My old house on Scanlan sat at the edge of what's now I-44. My grandma's, on Smiley, would be in the middle of 44. In Dellwood, we had \"woods\" along the creek and a huge cow pasture (now a shopping center) on top of a huge hill behind Dellridge Lane and Dellridge Court. Guy had several head of cattle up there, and we'd try to provoke them, then make a run for the barbed wire fence. Tore the crotch out of a lot of jeans scrambling through there.\n\nSold papers every day after school (Epiphany) on Arsenal and Ivanhoe fifth and sixth grade. Big rush was when Loose Leaf Metals plant let out. Pocket full of pennies tugging your pants down because the Post-Dispatch cost 7 cents and everybody paid with a dime. Nice lady a few houses east on Arsenal let us have wood from her porch to burn in the barrel to keep warm till it was time to go home for dinner. Later, on weekends, pushed one of those noisy iron wheel box carts up and down Pernod and Tholozan and Mardel and Oleatha all around Watson Road, delivering Post-Dispatch and Globe. Garage filled up with paper parts that had to be stuffed.\n\nIvanhoe Avenue must have had a tavern on every block, heading south from Arsenal. They were like neighborhood clubs. Never saw anything like that west of Kansas City. When the confectionaries were closed (there were a bunch of those, too), we could redeem soda bottles for the deposits if the tavern sold that brand. Scavenging bottles for the deposit was a good way to kill an afternoon in those days. Besides those businesses, in that same 5 block span, there was every business a neighborhood could need, including a doctor, a drug store, a dentist, a grocery store with a deli counter, a TV repair shop, a barber shop, and a beauty shop. Unless you needed to load up for a trip to Central Hardware or Western Auto, that neighborhood had everything you needed, including a bowling alley attached to Epiphany's gym that hired parish kids to set pins. I think they even sold beer in there, too.\n\nSaw my first Friday night high school football game at CBC. Seemed like thousands of people there. My little high school had to play on Saturday afternoons before a few dozen family members......no lights for night games. Couldn't wait to play on Friday nights, when all high school football games should be played. Moved to LA with family in middle of high school, so finally got to play on Friday night then.\n\nIt snows out here in town about once every 3-4 years, and I shovel the driveway slowly..........my dad passed away shoveling snow on Oleatha Avenue in '68. Have to assume St. Louis cops know CPR now. We prefer our snow up in the mountains, looking pretty and far away.\n\nMy kids don't understand how I didn't need a car to get around St. Louis. Could hitchhike or grab a bus on Jamieson and get out to the golf course (Algonquin in Webster) in 20-25 minutes to grab two loops (36 holes) lugging two bags each loop for the princely sum of $16 a day. No tipping. 3 days of work a week and I had all the spending $$$ I needed. 'Course, later on, you needed a car if you wanted to take a girl out. Hard to date on a Public Service (Bi-State) bus. I remember waiting for a bus late at night on Arsenal, right outside the State Hospital. Classmate who lived near there told me they found patients in his yard all the time. Spookier than a graveyard, wondering about the guy wandering down Arsenal when the bus was late.\n\nUsed to go on the seminary grounds out west of Shrewsbury on the weekends.......huge stands of trees out there back then. I understand it's pretty developed up now. The River des Peres had lots of foliage all along the banks.........got lost in there for hours chasing each other around. Never caught a fish at Willmore Park, but it was a good way to spend a summer morning and get a long bike ride in. Always rode back through Stan Musial's neighborhood in St. Louis Hills, like he'd really be out there mowing his lawn, waiting to give us an autograph. Who knows if he really lived there.....was probably an urban legend told by some older kids who figured we wouldn't know what a snipe hunt was.\n\nChicago folks claim Harry Caray as their own, but if I heard his voice right now, next to Jack Buck, yelling about Julian Javier grabbing up a grounder or Bob Gibson striking somebody out, I'd be 8 years old again. No one ever called a home run the way Harry Caray did. Nothing like those two guys calling the game on a transistor with a 2\" speaker, on a Sunday afternoon while the old man snored on the couch.\n\nIf I remember right, the '64 World Series was at Sportsman's Park on the north side. The nuns got mad because of the rumor school would be out the day after the Cardinals beat the Yankees. Listened to the Tigers beat the Cards in '67 or '68 (can't remember which) with the transistor to my ear sitting in the Fyler Branch library. The librarian told me to turn it up. Held a girl's hand for the first time while watching the Cardinals make a pennant run in '67 in the stadium that's about to be torn down. Learned to swim at Holiday Hill pool. Learned to ice skate at an indoor place in Wellston (Winter Garden?), then a rink in Forest Park on Sunday afternoons, after morning mass.\n\nIf we didn't have the nuns to tell us when Advent was near, the big candles on the Northland Famous-Barr (propped up the day after Thanksgiving, I think) let us know. Of course, then, so did the parents' groaning about Christmas carols on the radio. Lived in St. Louis from 1953 to 1969, but never saw snow on Christmas. Might have happened in the 50s, but if it did, I don't remember. I do remember wondering if we were gonna make it home in the freezing rain after midnight mass '64. Longest, coldest 3 block walk of my life, and that includes a winter in the Rockies.\n\nOnce a year, we'd go to Luigi's on Watson Road or out in the suburbs (Manchester?) and eat those flat pizza squares till I couldn't face 'em anymore. I still can't find pizza anywhere like that, and I've been all over this country. One visit to St. Louis a few years ago, I tasted a piece of Imo's pizza......or maybe a couple.........it sortuv tasted like that. My dad's family is Italian, and he lived on the Hill when he was growing up, so we'd go to Ruggieri's or one of the other Italian places whose names I don't remember for family reunion dinners. I tell my friends out here about that and they make it out like I was having dinner a table away from Tony Soprano.\n\nWrestling at the Kiel Auditorium on Saturday night. Neighbor kid (older, with a car) took us a couple of times. Remember wondering why everybody was taking it all so serious. Got in a fight when I told the guy next to me it was all fake. True believers didn't wanna hear that.\n\nRemember a tornado in the early 60s, hit at night and killed some folks on the north side. Tore a big hole in the Arena roof and knocked a TV tower over. Years later, at Blues games, you could look up and see the newer timbers where they'd grafted in the replacement to fill the hole.\n\nSomebody on one of these pages wrote in from Hermann, MO. Spent a summer there working on a farm outside of Hermann when I was 15 and mom thought I could get in too much trouble on my own in town. Tornado hit the first Saturday after I arrived, knocked down so many trees, we spent 3 days chain-sawing through the trunks to get the tractor out to the road. Learned to split firewood, buck hay, disk a field, and slop hogs in Hermann. The year before, my high school's basketball team was all set to clean up in the district playoffs but ran into Hermann's slow-down offense in the first round. Those farm boys won 20-18, and that game could have really used a shot clock.\n\nOut here in Calif, when I call somebody a hoosier, people wonder why I'm talking about Indianans in that tone of voice. They wouldn't understand.\n\nI've traveled and lived all over the west in the last 35 years; never lived anywhere besides St. Louis where people ask where you went to high school after being introduced.\n\nBuddy of mine from Detroit, living out here, got all excited a few years ago when he found out they sold frozen White Castles at the supermarket. Tasted one and got him to agree they're nothing like we remember from the Midwest. Haven't found anything out here tastes like Steak n Shake, either. My wife, a California native who's tasted Ted Drew's frozen custard, tells me periodically that if he could figure out a way to get it out here, we could make a living selling it for him.\n\nFinally, something I've wondered about for a while. For a couple of years early on, my parents sent me to Mt. Providence in Normandy. The northern half of the building was the boys' school; the southern half, a retirement home for Sisters of Divine Providence. A couple times a year, one of the older nuns would pass away, and all the little boys had to go to her funeral, then make a procession following her casket out to the east by the soccer field to a little cemetery they had for them. You could hear I-70 traffic beyond the trees. A few years ago a relative told me they were tearing down Mt. Providence, selling the land to the highway department to widen I-70, and moving the order elsewhere. But she couldn't tell me what happened to that cemetery. I can't imagine they'd just leave the sisters' graves there next to the new interstate lanes. No reason I need to know, just wondered. You see, the nuns tended to pass in the spring, when the flowers were really fragrant and grew all along the processional route. After a couple of years of that, I associated the smell of fresh roses with nuns' funerals. My wife is a Methodist who loves roses and always wants me to smell hers. She was very puzzled when I told her what they smelled like...................\n\nResponses from Dave in Lilburn, Georgia 9/30/2005\n\nBoth of those 9/29/05 entries were good for causing a few flashbacks. The Californian Bob must write for a living. I think that the Mollâs clock might have said âSince 1858â, but thatâs a fuzzy memory from me as a five year old who had little perspective of what ninety years might have meant. I just remember their human-powered freight elevator with clam-shell operating wooden doors, the smell of the dry grocery goods, and the way they treated my grandmother when weâd walk in. It was almost like Norm walking into Cheers. A bygone era, for sure.\n\nWhat other businesses used those large clocks over the sidewalks? I seem to remember Jacquardâs Jewelers and maybe Lammertâs, a fine furniture company on Washington. There might have been another sidewalk clock near the Fox Theater on Grand. To have one of these clocks displaying the wrong time must have been the worst possible advertising for a company that sold timepieces.\n\nThe older I get, the more business smells seem to come back in my memory. The caramel popcorn smells still remind me of Sear-Roebuck; the Arcade Building lobby was a unique blend reflecting the merchant mix, and any Woolworths store had an oilcloth odor somewhere in its background. And for the life of me I cannot reason why, as a young teen delivering groceries, why most of the foyers in those four or six family flats, with the combined entry stairwells in the front, all seemed to smell the same. A good smell that must have meant âWelcome Homeâ to tens of thousands of Saint Louisians in the 1940-50s.\n\nResponses from Barb Sullivan nee Russell 10/3/2005\n\nI have just read your memories, and was just lost in the past , then I came upon one from Pattie ,I remember thinking finally found someone from North st louis and as I read I realized it was my sister , LOL she had a few things wrong however Lol the backery was called Mertz's and my girl friend lived up stairs and her name is Crumb , and the Roaches lived next door , I kid you not . but that was a neighborhood were everyone was family , and they all looked out for everybody's kids . we had a garage in the back with an upright piano and on Sat. night my dad and the guy next door both played and we would would have block parties that spilled out into the alley, so much fun. played bottle caps in that alley too. never had inside facilities until I was 12 in 1954 seems unheard of now but never thought anything about not having them then. we had 5 kids to live in a 3 room cold water flat ,went to St. Leo's school , Rosati Kane High , and moved to South St Louis when I married in 1960 , moved to St. Charles in 1973 and have been on this side of the river ever since, but really miss the people from the old neighborhood, and once a year I do go to the reunion one of my old friend pulls together every year . and it is so much fun to reminises. some of you ought to try and do that with your old neighborhoods , you would be surprised how many of them show up . I think they all miss that easy time of living and none of the fears of today . was sure fun reading , and I will write again. right now am going to write my sister to tell her I found her letter. LOl\n\nResponses from Carol Grojean 10/11/2005\n\nI remember well visiting my grandparents home. Grandpa built the house in the early 1900's and many came to check it out as a novelty because he had both gas and electric installed. He also had an inside bathroom with toilet. The telephone stood on a small table behind the door between the dining room and kitchen and had no dial. To speak with someone, you lifted the earpiece from its hook and told the operator either the name or the number you wanted. My mother grew up and was married there in 1934.\n\nSome \"remembers\" I have not seen yet include Lucille Ball paper dolls and gas lights on Semple Ave. Both my grandmothers kept chickens in the back yard for both eggs and meat, and had \"glass\" eggs to encourage the hens to nest. Many houses were laid out so there was a side yard for a garden. Grandma had lace curtains which she dried on a \"stretcher\" and how she got those heavy rugs out on a clothes line is beyond me, but she used a \"carpet beater\" on them. Later, she got a \"hand-pump\" style carpet cleaner (non-electric.) When I was about 10, she took me down to Famous Barr only to discover I was not wearing stockings. She was mortified!\n\nBoth grandmothers had cabinets built into the sides of their kitchens to keep food cold in winter. The outside walls were louvered and the inside doors were solid.\n\nGrandpa worked at the Elder Shirt Company and every Thursday he signed payroll checks at the kitchen table (covered with oilcloth) while he listened to Fibber Magee and Molly and Can You Top This. (I was not allowed to listen to The Shadow-too scary for a little girl. Wow, have things changed!)\n\nGrandpa had a Ford (black, of course, which he called \"The Machine\") and regularly drained and flushed the radiator. (His father also bought a car (pre Ford assembly line) and read the instruction manual while driving on his way home. Says something about traffic at the time.) Three members of my family were killed in trolley accidents.\n\nJohn Phillip Sousa came with his band to one of the high school (was it Rittenour?) and invited the school band to sit in with them, but they were not allowed to play, only act as if they were playing.\n\nMy great Aunt worked as a supervisor in the dining room at Famous Barr and dismissed any young lady (waitress) who was dressed or acted inappropriately by her standards. Famous Barr had a farm in the country for the employees vacations. Girls lived in dormitories and the boys lived in cabins.\n\nResponses from Becky 11/4/2005\n\nWhat a treat to find this website just a week after I returned to New York City after my first St. Louis visit in many years. So many different cities, yet the same one in thrilling ways.\n\nI grew up in the Central West End. Summers we cooled down with fans blown over bowls of ice, or went to Pevely Dairy where the colored lights took your mind off the heat.\n\nLearned to ice skate at the Winter Garden.\n\nTook the street car to Glazers Drugs in Clayton.\n\nLived spitting distance from the DeBallivier strip, where I managed to sneak in to see Evelyn West, the biggest and the best, with her $50,000 treasure chest, insured by Lloyds of London. Sorry to hear she's gone but amazed she made it so long. RIP.\n\nI am researching the history of my grandfather, Louis H. Egan, who was involved in a huge Union Electric political slush fund scandal that broke in 1938. He went to the federal penitentiary in 1943. I've read all the Post-Dispatch, Globe-Democrat and Star-Times articles, and there were many, but would like to find anyone who knows anything about this from family or other sources. If you e-mail me at [email protected], and put something recognizable in the subject line, I can let you in through my spamblocker. I'd be grateful for any recollections passed down about this.\n\nMeanwhile, thanks for the memories.\n\nResponses from Sandra LaRouche 11/8/2005\n\nI grew up in Wellston, 6322 Ridge--my old home, minus it's wonderful porches and now, sadly drab, still stands, My grandmother bought it in 1932. I was the last person in my family to live there, returning from Houston to rehab it in 1965. The neighborhood became dangerous and we moved.\n\n> At one time Wellston was at wonderful place to live. EVergreen 4867 was the phone number at 6322 Ridge.\n\nThe Wellston High School marching Band practiced on the street in front of my home (my Aunt and Uncle's actually) We walked one block to high school and one block in the opposite direction to grade school and Jr. high.\n\nWe watched the Kefauver Commission intently on TV in 1951. I absorbed live theatre on Channel 9 and reveled in Your Show of Shows, not knowing that someday, in my job in Special Events at Famous-Barr, that I would have lunch with Sid Caesar.\n\nOur whole family made a popcorn and Dr. Pepper event of watching the Veiled Prophet Ball on tv-my aunt always knowing in advance who the queen would be, following the society pages as some follow sports--there's little difference.\n\nMy cousin, Julie, and I practiced THE BOW, touching the nose to the knees and gracefully rising without effort, like a swan. We could do it, we were ready. Finally my aunt told us, something we somehow silently suspected, poor girls don't make their debut at the Veiled Prophet Ball.\n\nGently she told us that girls such as we, would never have the opportunity to sweep grandly, but modestly, into the Khorrasan Room of the Chase Hotel, would never have Frank Eschen extol the beauty of our gowns, reveal the number of beads and brilliants in our azure blue velvet and crystal encrusted trains. It wasn't quite as much fun to watch after that.\n\nOnce I slipped which trying to perfectly execute this maneuver and got a serious rug burn--I still have the scar on the top of my foot 50 years later.\n\nSitting on our porch swing on our wrap around porch at the house at 6322 Ridge Ave., we sat through black outs during WWII and later, on ordinary nights, in the late summer quiet, we could hear the creaking sound of the Hodiamont street car \"making the loop\" in a slowly dying Wellston.\n\nIn 1955 I worked at Kresge's in electrical outlets for 60 cents an hour until, because I wore starched white organdy aprons, I got a raise to 65 cents an hour and was moved to the front of the store--artificial flowers and letter paper.(also the sound of The Restless Wind by Googie Grant being played non-stop for 8 hours a day) I was offered a clerical/receptionist job by Rembrandt Studios for an unheard of 90 cents an hour. I worked 30 hours a week during 2 years of high school.\n\nWellston H.S. class of '57 was the first integrated class to graduate-our school was small (max 300), I felt it was beautiful with deep teal velvet curtains in the auditorium. I never understood why it was later abandoned for a newer and not so beautiful building on Sutter Ave. The auto dealership, O'Leary-McClintock, on Wells Avenue and Evergreen, gave us a driver's education car every other year.\n\nWe bought wool skirts with double kick pleats at a shop in Maplewood (I would love to know the name of it) the pleats featured baby buttons inside them and were of such quality that ten years after high school I was still able to wear them to my office. We wore sweaters made of something called Tycora. My school shoes were purchased with one Eagle stamp book plus about $2.00 and they were always penny loafers, size 4, the size I still wear.\n\nNow I know the close budget on which my aunt took care of us and I appreciate the hard work my uncle did to earn it. Growing up in a Wellston which had AAA rated schools with Latin, other languages and a full curriculum offered by a warm and caring team of teachers was great. It was like Happy Days on TV--almost.\n\nAs a kid, I studied dance free at Sherman Park Community Center and when I was over 16 and could afford it, I went to Ford Dance School. I wanted to be a ballerina (a highly unlikely ambition), a writer,a musical comedy performer and I wanted to travel so, of course, my guidance counselor asked me what kind of secretary I intended to be.\n\nAs a girl with no money and no social position, my prospects were not great. There were NO Junior Colleges-the small scholarships offered me weren't enough to make it happen in a college. l got a job at Commercial Credit Rating, in the pink building at the Lindell and Olive wedge. I learned to be a very good interviewer; I learned the ins and outs of consumer & commercial credit, all at at a rate of $175 a month GROSS.\n\nCredit bureau files were on manila folder, actually more like a pocket, with the last name printed first followed by the first name in cursive. If the person was Negro a double X was written in the upper right hand corner of the file.(Imagine that now!) File clerks attempted to use roller skates to expedite the finding of files but got big shocks from the steel file cabinets. I worked in written reports and must have single handedly interviewed over half of the people who purchase homes in the Oliver parks subdivisions in Illinois. I knew the phone number of every bank in St. Louis.\n\nMy favorite name that I ever saw on file was Dimples Immergoot. I used to imagine her as a plump little woman who wore pink ribbons in her hair no matter how old she got. One file said, \"Beware--Pete Ely-This Man is a Gypsy\" Commercial Credit Rating was an education in itself.\n\nWhite flight and the beginnings of urban decay put an end to the busy shopping center that we knew as Wellston--many people who once populated Wellston now can be found in the suburbs of St. Charles. I went in a different direction. As one of my teachers predicted I would, I traveled widely, became a credit professional, but even better a newspaper writer and editor and magazine writer, public relations manager/ events coordinator, amateur actress and eventually a non-denominational minister.\n\nSome dreams do come true--but in their own way. One lovely night, gowned in white, I made my entrance from a draped presentation box, in the Khorassan Room of the Chase Hotel at an event given by a gay organization called The Mandrake Ball. I was The Empress of The North. After that I appeared at St. Louis First Night Celebrations and in the Thanksgiving Parade as The Snow Queen"
