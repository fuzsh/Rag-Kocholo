        "text": "Conductors\n\nPrincipal Conductor – Dr David Thornton\n\nDr David Thornton is regarded as one of the foremost euphonium players and teachers of his generation and has a global reputation. His work as a soloist, conductor and educator is renowned throughout the brass playing world to have the hallmark of extreme virtuosity, professionalism and an ability to connect with audiences like few others in his field.\n\nHis work within the brass band world has seen him at the top flight for almost twenty years. He has held solo euphonium positions with the Fairey Band (1997-2000), the Black Dyke Band (2000-2010) and the Brighouse & Rastrick Band (2011-2015) having won five National titles, three British Opens and one European Championship during this time.\n\nDavid is a course director for the Bolsover Brass Band Summer School and has been a course tutor for the National Youth Brass Band of Great Britain, National Youth Brass Band of Wales, National Children’s Brass Band of Great Britain, National Youth Wind Orchestra of Great Britain, the International Brass Band Summer School (Swansea) and the Wessex Band Summer School.\n\nDavid also tutors at the RNCM, the University of Huddersfield and Chetham’s School of Music.\n\nResident Conductor & Musical Director – Christopher Bond\n\nDescribed as “an extraordinary young man, from whom music pours with delightful generosity” by\n\nBAFTA-winning actress, Miriam Margolyes, Christopher has established a career as a composer,\n\nconductor, musical director and educator. A graduate of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama,\n\nChristopher is Musical Director with GUS Band & City of Cardiff Band, and Composer in Residence\n\nwith Cory Band – a position he’s held for ten years.\n\nAs a composer, Christopher’s work has been performed extensively across five continents with\n\ncommissions from Cory Band, Brighouse & Rastrick Band, Grimethorpe Band, Flowers Band and broadcasts in the United Kingdom on BBC Radio 2, 3, 4 & Classic FM.

Christopher is on the Executive of the Association of Brass Band Adjudicators.\n\nChristopher works regularly in theatre as a Musical Director for professional production company,\n\nImagine Theatre, and co-owns a music education company with a thriving Music Academy in the\n\nheart of Cardiff.\n\nAssociate Conductor — Stephen Bell\n\nBelfast-born Stephen Bell has built a hugely diverse career in both commerce and music spanning over 35 years. Stephens association with Brass Bands stretches back to his time at Laganvale Brass Band firstly on Eb Bass and then on Timpani. It was studying music at Southampton University and subsequently M.Mus (performance) at the University of Surrey that set Stephen on course to develop as a musical director in a variety of genres, encouraged and championed by Mike Sheppard and Professor Peter Evans.\n\nStephen has worked with choirs and other ensembles in and around Northampton since 1987. Most notable was the performance with Northampton Chamber Choir in 2001, of Mozart Requiem in St Giles Church with the Guildhall Orchestra: an Orchestra which Stephen formed and directed in 1997 for the Brahms centenary. Notable successes with the Guildhall Orchestra were the performances of Walton’s Viola Concerto with Martin Outram, Dvorak’s ‘Cello concerto with Michal Kaznowski, Bruch violin concerto with Jan Kaznowski and performances of all of the Brahms Symphonies. Stephen also directed the Guildhall Orchestra for a performance of Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No 3 with the internationally recognised pianist Nicholas Austin.\n\nStephen was appointed as the Musical Director of the Northampton Concert Band in 2005-2015 and has enjoyed considerable success with the band in the NCBF festival finals, winning numerous Gold and Platinum award. Stephen was appointed Musical Director of the St Cecilia Singers of Rushden (2007-2012); a tenure culminating in a memorable performance of Brahms German Requiem with the international soloist David Wilson-Johnson as the solo Baritone in November 2012. After a period conducting the Abingdon Concert Band (2010-2013) Stephen enjoyed being the musical director of the Rushden Windmill Brass Band (2012-14) the Northampton Male Voice Choir (2011-current), Market Harborough Orchestra (2012-current) and occasional concerts with the famous all-ladies “Boobs and Brass” and of course the mighty GUS.\n\nStephen is in demand as an adjudicator and has enjoyed working with the Milton Keynes, Wellingborough and the recently formed North Northampton Festival.\n\nWhilst not making music Stephen has cultivated an impressive parallel career within the automotive industry. Stephen held a very senior position within Mercedes-Benz in Milton Keynes for 10 years (2004-2014) and for the last 7 years has set up and run his own training company Red Kite Training & Development Limited providing consultancy and training services for the Passenger Car, Commercial Vehicle and Truck network for Mercedes-Benz.\n\nStephen has two daughters both of whom are professional violinists. When not making music or running his business Stephen can be found training hard for Marathons, reading musicological books and listening to good old-fashioned LPs.\n\nStephen lives in Oundle with his partner Sarah.\n\nCornets\n\nPrincipal Cornet – James Screaton\n\nJames Screaton has been playing the cornet since the age of 10 and was quickly introduced to the world of brass bands when he joined the Enderby Junior Band. In his ten years with the Enderby organisation James advanced through the three main brass bands and was appointed principal cornet of the first section Senior Band in late 2011, a position he held for just over a year.\n\nIn 2010 James was awarded a position to study music at The Birmingham Conservatoire under the expert tutelage of Richard Marshall and Ian Porthouse. In his four years at the Conservatoire James played in all of the main college ensembles – his highlights include playing Soprano and Principal cornet in the Conservatoire brass band, performing as a soloist playing the Torstein Aagaard – Nilsen Concerto for Cornet and Brass Band and on two occasions playing first cornet with the Symphony Orchestra for their performances of Symphony Fantastique and Messiaen’s Turangalila – Symphonie. James also entered several competitions while at college, the pinnacle being reaching the final of the Conservatoire Brass prize – one of only a few cornet players to ever do so.\n\nIn January 2013 James was appointed Principal Cornet of the Championship section Nottingham based Newstead Brass where he spent a happy two year period playing regularly as a soloist in concerts and contests alike. Contesting high points include achieving 7th place playing Red priest in the 2013 Grand Shield competition (despite almost knocking the Shield over mid performance!!) and being consecutive champions of the LBBA contest in both 2013 & 2014.\n\nJames joined GUS in 2015 on assistant principal cornet, getting the chance to sit next to and learn from the likes of James Fountain, Thomas Fountain and Ben Godfrey as well as filling in on the end chair when needed. During the 2020 Covid lockdowns James took on the challenge of helping to create the audio tracks for some of the bands early lockdown videos which can be found on the Media page. James took up the Principal cornet chair full time in late 2022 and helped to lead the band to success at the 2023 midlands area contest in Corby.\n\nJames currently also looks after and is helping to build upon the GUS band archive, regularly displaying items at concerts. Any photos, records, memories and general memorabilia will be greatly received and well looked after.\n\nAssistant Principal Cornet – Paul Sutton\n\nPaul started playing the cornet at the age of 8 in his local band and was a member of the National Youth Brass Band for several years in his teens. Paul has previously held Soprano Cornet/B flat positions with, Parc and Dare, Hendon (John Laing), Redbridge, Newham, Aveley, Desford and most recently being Principal cornet at Amersham Band.\n\nAfter studying at Guildhall School of music and Drama with Paul Cosh, Rod Franks, James Watson and Crispian Steele Perkins, Paul followed a career spanning 25 years with Central Band of the RAF, retiring as Principal Cornet.\n\nPaul currently works as a Funeral Manager for a small family business in West London.\n\nAn avid carp fisherman and complete petrol head, Paul can normally be found outside of work with a cornet, by a lake or covered in oil and grease looking for a 13 mil spanner!\n\nPaul joined The GUS Band in 2023.\n\nSolo Cornet – Nigel Bramley\n\nNigel learnt to play the cornet at age 10 and soon joined his first band, Soham Comrades Band. He had been with Soham Comrades for 25 years, and for the last 15 or those as their Principal Cornet. The GUS Band (then Travelsphere Holidays Band) were delighted to welcome him to the band in October 2003.\n\nNigel lives in Charteris, Cambridgeshire and runs his own carpentry business, NB Carpentry Ltd, which supplies and installs all types of joinery, but specialises in conservation.\n\nSolo Cornet – Archie Batty\n\nSoprano cornet – Jack Wilson\n\nRepiano cornet – Gary Sherlock\n\nGary began playing cornet at the age of 8 in the Dorset village Verwood Silver Band and rose through the ranks to become their principal cornet at the age of 14 and also principal of the Wessex Youth band.\n\nMoving north to train as a teacher and take cornet lessons from Stanley Boddington, Gary joined the City of Coventry Band and was a very proud member when they took the British Open Championship title at the last ever Belle Vue in 1981.\n\nFurther training took him to London and a short time with Hanwell Band (and a telly appearance on That’s Life!) before moving back to the Midlands to teach music and spells with Nassington Band, Peterborough Big Band and a further couple of years back at Coventry (Jaguar Cars).\n\nIn 1995 he joined Kibworth Band, and enjoyed an enjoyable and very successful run of contests over a period of 12 years before joining the Virtuosi GUS band in 2007 to provide a little more maturity to the front row team!\n\nAfter 15 years teaching Gary discovered the escape tunnel, retrained and now works as a Microsoft business software consultant and with GUS rehearsals just two minutes from his home, he manages to spend more time at home with his ever-supportive wife.\n\nSecond cornet – Marcus Pain\n\nMarcus started playing trumpet at the age of 11 at his local school, quickly rising to play Principal Trumpet at the Leicestershire schools of Music Symphonic Wind Band under Gary Sleath.\n\nHe was invited to play cornet with the Desford Youth Band in 1986, during a period that saw Marcus and the band win the National title twice and the first European Youth Band title in Falkirk. In 1989, Marcus became a founding player member of a youth band initiative set up by the then Rigid Containers Band (a former name of the GUS Band) in what was to become the Youth Brass 2000 Band. Marcus became the first holder of the Principal Cornet seat in a band that has gone on to win every major accolade in youth banding. The family connection remains with Marcus’s own children now playing with the band.\n\nIn 1991 Marcus also became the Principal Cornet of the Ancient Order of Forester’s Band, which enjoyed numerous successes under Chris Jeans. Five years later, in 1996, Marcus was asked to join the William Davis Band under Keith Wilkinson on 3rd Solo Cornet. During this period, he was fortunate to enjoy the tutelage of some top quality musicians in Betty Anderson, Brian Winters and also, on occasion, the great James Watson.\n\nFollowing short spells with Rigid Containers and Raby Co-Op bands, Marcus took a 12 year break from playing to concentrate on work and family. Then, receiving an invitation to the 25th anniversary Youth Brass 2000 reunion concert, the spark was re-ignited and in 2014 he joined Forester’s Band before taking up his current position with the world famous GUS Band in 2017, of which Marcus is so proud.\n\nSecond cornet – Matt Brown\n\nMatt started playing the cornet with Camborne Youth Band aged 7, whom he played with until reaching the grand old age of 18. Matt experienced immense success with Camborne Youth; winning the National Youth Championships seven times! Matt has also been attending the Wessex Band Summer School every year since 2007, winning the Courtney Bosanko Shield in 2013 in recognition of his dedication and commitment over a number of years.\n\nWhilst still a member of the youth band, Matt was invited to join Camborne Senior Band aged 17. Shortly after, Matt took a break from full-time brass banding while completing his degree in Radiography at The University of Hertfordshire, during which he broadened his musical horizons by playing Jazz Band Trumpet!\n\nIn 2019, Matt relocated to the Oxfordshire area to begin his career as an NHS Radiographer, joining The GUS Band soon after.\n\nThird cornet – Amy Bruce\n\nAmy started playing the cornet aged 7 and at the age of 9 was introduced to the Lions Youth Brass organisation where she joined their Junior Band. In 2003, just a year after joining Lions, Amy progressed to the Youth Band where she enjoyed many of the band’s tours including to the Czech Republic and the Costa Blanca.\n\nIn 2007, Amy joined the North West-based Roberts Bakery Band, shortly after, the band went on to win the First Section North West Regional Championships. In 2009, Amy’s playing career progressed to Solo Cornet at Roberts Bakery Band at the same time as her appointment as Principal Cornet of Lions Youth Brass, a position she held until she left for University. During her 2 years as Principal Cornet, Amy led the band in great competition successes including runners up in the National Youth Brass Band and Butlins Mineworkers Youth Section Championships. When leaving Lions in 2011, Amy was awarded the prestigious bandsperson of the year award at the organisation’s 21st birthday celebrations.\n\nIn 2011 Amy moved to Liverpool to start University, but continued to play with the Roberts Bakery Band, enjoying many high profile concerts with the band including the Bluedot Festival, as well as a further two wins at Regional Championships, three National Finals appearances and trips to Estonia and Germany. In 2019 Amy completed her PhD in Pharmacology and decided to leave the Roberts Bakery Band after 12 years to pursue travelling ambitions to parts of Asia and the USA and to accept a position as a Regulatory Medical Writer in Oxford. This move further south meant Amy was able to join The GUS Band on Solo Cornet as of July 2019.\n\nHorns\n\nFlügelhorn – Rhys Cave\n\nRhys began playing at the age of five and comes from a banding family with his mum, two sisters and brother also players. With a wealth of experience, Rhys spent five years at the Junior Guildhall School of Music first as flugel player and then as principal cornet. He was also principal cornet at the Tilbury Youth Band for over ten years. His other playing experience has been gained as a member of the Tilbury Band, Thundersley Brass and Aveley and Newham Band as well as depping for many others. He rates his proudest moment as qualifying for the Championship Section Finals at the Royal Albert Hall with Thundersley Brass. We hope he will see many more appearances at the Finals with GUS.\n\nOutside of the Bandroom, Rhys is a keen runner and is working on bringing down his 5k time. He’s also a season ticket holder at the ‘mighty’ West Ham, (Rhys’s description and very much up for debate!)\n\nSolo Horn – Rob Fleming\n\nRob grew up on the Wirral and began to play the tenor horn at the age of 8, he quickly went on to join the Wirral schools and Port Sunlight Lyceum brass bands. Rob went on to study music at Huddersfield and Liverpool Universities gaining experience playing in lots of top bands and ensembles. He had notable spells with Northop Silver Band and Fodens Band, being fortunate to work with fantastic conductors and experience success in the likes of the welsh and northwest areas, the English Nationals, the Masters and the British open as well as many high profile concerts and recordings.\n\nRob trained as a brass teacher with the Liverpool music service and he now works for Northamptonshire Music and Performing Arts Trust where he is proud to be a conductor with the County Junior Brass Ensemble, Sponne School Brass Band and the Head of Towcester Saturday Morning music school.\n\nFirst Horn – Chelsea James\n\nChelsea grew up in Northamptonshire and began to play the tenor horn at the age 8. Throughout school, Chelsea played for Northamptonshire Music Performing Arts Trust and in 2015 became the the principal horn of the County Youth Brass Band. During 2015 and 2016, Chelsea also played for the National Youth Brass Band of Great Britain and completed a number courses under the the horn section leaders of Owen Farr and Sheona White. She was lucky enough to be conducted by Bramwell Tovey in a number of concerts.\n\nIn 2016, Chelsea started her studies at the Royal Welsh College of Music Drama. For four years, she was under the tutorledge of Owen Farr and completed her brass band studies led by Dr. Robert Childs. During her time in Cardiff, Chelsea played 1st horn and Solo horn for Tongwynlais Temperance Band.\n\nIn 2020, Chelsea moved back to Northamptonshire to complete her PGCE Primary Course at the University of Northampton. Before joining GUS, Chelsea helped out her local band (Daventry) and played at Brass Band of Central England. Chelsea is a fully qualified primary school teacher and loves to incorporate music within children’s learning!\n\nSecond Horn – Colin Rigby\n\nColin began playing the Cornet at the age of 8 down at his local band, Micklefield brass. Then in 1986 moved onto the horn and to the Allerton Bywater Colliery band, who under the baton of Alan Morrison won several contests, including the 1988 4th section National final. By 1989 the band had folded, so Colin moved to play for South Milford Brass. 2 years later he went to university and put his horn away. Fast forward 24 years and Colin thought it was time to get out his horn again, however his local band, Corby silver, had a full horn section, but a vacancy on soprano. He tried his hand at the soprano but decided to return to the horn. In January 2016 he moved on to the first horn seat at the Jaguar Landrover band. During this time the band came 2nd at the Grand Shield qualifying for the British Open, playing at Symphony Hall in both 2016 and 2017.\n\nHorn – Simon Smith\n\nSimon started playing at the age eight with St. Keverne Youth Band in Cornwall. At the age of thirteen he progressed to the senior band on 1st horn and it was not long after that he took up the Solo Horn seat. Whilst with St. Keverne (Britain’s most southerly band) the band represented the South West twice at the Royal Albert Hall in the National Finals, before being promoted to the Championship Section.\n\nAt the age of eighteen, Simon moved to London to study Civil Engineering at University. During these years, Simon had a brief spell playing for the Tilbury Band in the Championship Section of the London and Home Counties Brass Band Association. On graduating with a 1st Class Honours Degree in Civil Engineering, Simon moved to Guildford in Surrey and joined the Friary Guildford Band (formerly Friary Meux Brewery Band) on solo horn and spent several successful years with them in the Championship section. In 1993 Simon won the Southern Counties Solo title.\n\nIn February 1999, Simon moved to Whaddon in Buckinghamshire at which time, Simon was invited to join the Virtuosi GUS Band. Since being appointed the band’s Principal Horn, Simon has been invited to play with many other Championships Bands, including YBS, Desford Colliery Band and Grimethorpe Colliery Band.\n\nSimon has been a valuable member of the Horn section sitting in all three seats over the 21+ years.\n\nEuphoniums & Baritones\n\nSolo Euphonium – George Bruce\n\nGeorge first began playing cornet at the age of 7, receiving lessons through Milton Keynes Music Service and Bradwell Silver Band.\n\nAfter a couple of years, George moved onto Euphonium, receiving lessons from his great friend Vaughan Bower. George progressed through Northamptonshire County Youth Brass Band and Concert Band, playing Solo Euphonium in both. He had great encouragement and support from his family, especially his older brother and father who both played with George in Stantonbury Brass.\n\nIn 2011 George gained a place to study at the prestigious Royal Northern College of Music. Receiving world class tuition from Steven Mead, David Thornton and Roger Cutts, George graduated with a First Class Honours Degree. One of George’s highlights was being appointed Principal Euphonium of the RNCM Brass Band, where he performed under world class conductors including James Gourlay at the RNCM Festival of Brass. During his time at the RNCM George also enjoyed helping many top bands before taking the Solo Euphonium seat at Roberts Bakery Band, under Simon Stonehouse, where he met his fiancée, Amy.
