        "text": "Beginning his career in the fashion department of i-D magazine in the late 1990s, Marcus Agerman Ross rose to the position of fashion editor before taking up the role of European fashion director at Vice magazine at a pivotal time when digital media was in its infancy. In 2010, he founded his own magazine, Jocks&Nerds, a publication that explores the intersection between clothes, culture and individuality. More recently, he has been working within radio, hosting shows on both Soho Radio and Totally Wired Radio.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has taken on various professional roles, within both media and fashion, including writer, photographer and stylist. As a creative director, he has developed marketing campaigns for the likes of Nike, Baracuta, C.P. Company and Absolut vodka."
