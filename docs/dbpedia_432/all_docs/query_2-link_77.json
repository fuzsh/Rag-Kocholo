        "text": "Athletics\n\nLast week saw the regional round of the English Schools Intermediate Boys Track and Field Cup. 14 took part, with all athletes having to participate in one track and one field event with the times/distances contributing points to the overall team score. Daniel (R) won the 1500m with a time of 4 mins 23 seconds. Will (L) came 2nd in the 300m with a time of 39.6 seconds. John (Bn) came 5th in the High Jump with a height of 1.53m.\n\nWell done also to Arthur (Pn) and Ella (W) who represented GB & NI U20 at the Loughborough International. In the 1500m T12 Para event, Arthur (Pn) came 5th and in the 3000m Steeplechase Ella (W) came 2nd with a PB. Well done to both of you.\n\nCricket\n\nBoth the boys and girls played Bradfield last week. In the Yearlings A Will (S) scored 100*, in the U15As Min (O) scored 48 playing a year up and Matilda (A) took 4 wickets; in the boys’ 2nd XI Alex (R) took 4 wickets, in the JC As Jamie (M) made 64, on the back of a 93 in their cup game on Monday plus took 4 wickets too; in the boys’ 1st XI Tom (Hl) took 5 wickets including a hattrick and Harry (S) made a composed 61 in the JC Bs where he also bowled 5 overs, taking 3 wickets for 19 runs. Special mention to Edie (Hn) who was presented with the MCC Spirit of Cricket award for her competitive nature, effort, and skill shown in the T20 fixture with them.\n\nWell done to the Yearlings A as a team who had a bumper week. On Thursday they secured their first victory of the season chasing down 104 in a thrilling T20 chase off the last ball of the game. On Saturday they toiled hard for 35 overs against Bradfield in the field and restricted them to 214. A magnificently mature 100 not out from Will (S), well supported by James (Bd) and captain Jake (Hl) sealed victory in the last over. The team’s progress over this half of term has been immense.\n\nIn the U14A the girls scored 125 and bowled Bradfield out for 113 in 19.3 overs. Olympia (O) scored 41, hitting a six off the first ball of the game! They secured two wins in a row last week having also beaten Haileybury on Thursday with Edie (Hn) scoring 50. Sophia (C) took 3 wickets for 9 off her 2 overs too.\n\nShooting\n\nSix members of the shooting team shot in a heats match against over Berkshire teams, all of which are full adult teams. Penny (A), Adrian (L), Julius (T), Ricky (M), Natty (W) and Matteo (L) won the heats match, beating both Windsor Rifle Club and The Cardinals, with a six point lead. This is an incredible achievement, and will see Wellington College shooting team representing Berkshire County as a team during the Imperial Meeting. Natty (W) top scored with 104 with 10, out of a maximum 105 with 21, an impressive achievement!\n\nTennis\n\nLots to celebrate as the boys’ and girls’ tennis season comes to a close (before mixed doubles in the second half). The girls’ 1st team of twelve, including doubles pairs from all five year groups, did brilliantly in the ISGTL tournament at Bradfield. With wins coming from the right pairs at the right times, and with everyone contributing, Wellington narrowly won their group against St Mary’s Calne , Cranleigh and St Mary’s Ascot. The girls lined up against Marlborough for the final, and drew 3 sets all, losing narrowly on game countback 19-17. A brilliant afternoon of really high-level school tennis, right down to the wire. Huge credit to these girls for their efforts.\n\nThe boys had their RHWM tournaments, always a super high level and a great opportunity to compete at singles as well as doubles. Special mention to the U15A team who were only a few games from total victory in a super tight contest.\n\nTriathlon\n\nHuge congratulations to Nell (Hg) for qualifying for the next round of the Triathlon Elite Youth super series through a brilliant race performance in Llanelli, Wales.\n\nTeam of the week\n\nThe U15A Girls cricket team. The girls have shown resilience and fight in their last few matches and as a team that regularly changes, they have always been able to share roles and give everyone opportunities with either bat or ball and still produce great results! They are still going strong in their 100 ball cup too.\n\nA bumper week of two wins on the road for the U15A Girls takes them nicely into the half-term break. Firstly, at Haileybury on Thursday the girls put on an impressive 168 for 6 off their 20 overs, with Nishka (T) accumulating 67 off 49 balls and Serena (W) scoring 22 as the opening pair made a century stand. In reply Haileybury could only manage 85 for 8 off their 20 overs, with disciplined bowling pegging them back. Olympia (O) and Zara (W) were the pick of the bowlers with accurate and economical bowling seeing the team over the line.\n\nFollowing this up, on Saturday, the team travelled to Bradfield where they were set 139 to chase in the 20 overs. Tilda (A) had an exceptional run with the ball in hand finishing with figures of 4 for 19 off her 4 overs. In reply, the opening pair of Serena (W) and Min (O) put on a rapid 65 off the first 6 overs, before Honor (A) arrived to put on a quick 21 in support of Min whose winning run left her on 48 not out as the team chased down their target with 3 overs to go.\n\nOverall, a very impressive week of cricket from the girls, well done to each and every one of them.\n\nCricket\n\nThe Cricket Club played 19 fixtures last week, with 10 wins over both boys’ and girls’ fixtures. Well done to the Boys 4th XI who had a solid midweek win and the Boys 3rd XI who recorded an excellent victory against Harrow, having lost three early wickets. Last week saw five girls’ XIs play, the most ever in one week, with three wins from five games recorded, including an excellent win for the Girls 1st XI. Week 1 also saw the Boys 1st XI open their season with a 37 run win against the Free Foresters CC, with the notable performance of Eddie (Bd) taking 7 wickets for 26 runs, including a hat-trick. Well done also to Aramaya (Pn) who scored 121 in the 2nd XI against Harrow.\n\nFootball\n\nGreat news came in this week, with Fabienne (Ap) selected for Sweden U18 Football at the European Championship finals this summer.\n\nNetball\n\nWell done also to Amelie (W) on her selection for Scotland U19 Netball.\n\nSailing\n\nThe Sailing team kicked off their term with six wins from ten races. Well done to Jessie (A) who stepped up with only recreational sailing experience and handled the intensity of team racing competition brilliantly.\n\nBSDRA Southern Team Racing Championships, Spinnaker SC:\n\nWith the sailing team slightly thin on the ground for the weekend, Poppy (C) stepped up to helm for competition and Jessie (A) represented the College for the first time. Early wins against less experienced opposition saw the team in a good position after our first few races. However, we were overwhelmed by more practised and well drilled teams, as well as racing one race with only two out of three boats. Our final position was 9th of the 20 with much tactical analysis and learning points for next weekend’s event in Rutland.\n\nShooting\n\nOver the Easter holidays, the Wellington Shooting team had a variety of shooting events. Just as school broke up for Easter, we saw Penny (A), Adrian (L), Ricky (M), Sayan (M), and Alex (R) go to Ex Maple Taste, where they trained and shot alongside their peers across the UK, whilst being coached by national and GB shots. Penny and Adrian are both part of the Athelings team (GB U18s) this year, an incredible achievement, and we are super proud of them. We also learnt that Ricky managed to secure a place on the small roster of 12 members for the UK Cadet Rifle team, with Alex securing a spot as a reserve. This team is always a hard one, due to the small number of places and the large amount of applicants, but all three (Sayan, Ricky, and Alex) impressed over the course of the week and are stronger for it.\n\nThe final week of the Easter holidays saw the Easter camp begin. Whilst not the coldest camp we have run, it was by far one of the windiest, with wind speeds of 25mph and gusts of 40mph whilst shooting. Despite these miserable conditions, every pupil attending did their best and pushed themselves to learn more. We even managed to have a team building exercise afternoon, with bowling and an escape room. All of this teamwork and shooting effort culminated in the end of week shoot in the Cobweb Buster, a competition organised by the Gloucester County. For first time shooters, brand new to the concept of “wind” and “self-coaching”, Siena (C) and Valentina (Hn) showed true mettle in not giving up and powering on with their shoots. After a struggle at 900, and some allowances made by the competition organisers, Valentina and Siena had a very successful 1000 yards and came out with some excellent scores. Adrian showed that consistency was key, beating other school competitors by 2 points to secure the top school shot of the day, and earning himself 3rd place in the top U25 spot, only being beaten by two university students (1st place being an OW and currently a member of the English Lions).\n\nAll in all, a very good Easter break for the Shooting team, with results from the final smallbore competitions beginning to filter in as we move into the Fullbore season.\n\nTennis\n\nIt was great to see the Summer Term start with a bang for tennis with 34 fixtures played. Conditions for tennis were highly challenging with the wind, but that makes it even more impressive for the six teams who recorded wins, especially the Yearlings 2, 3 and 4 who had very tight matches and got their Wellington tennis careers off to a winning start.\n\nWaterpolo\n\nHuge congratulations to Victor (Bd) and his team, who last weekend won the National Age Group, U17, Waterpolo Championships, a brilliant effort.\n\nTeam of the Week\n\nIt was an outstanding display of positivity, disciplined bowling and confident batting from the Junior Colt C cricket team, which saw them beat Harrow by 6 wickets with 6 overs to spare.\n\nTight bowling from Fabian (M) and Conrad (S) and an incredible double-wicket maiden from Eashar (S) meant a target of 106 from 25. An exhilarating 42-ball 43 from Jasper (S) and a dominant 23-ball 18 from Ethan (R) saw them bring home the win.\n\nBest Senior Season Yet – with Richard Shorter\n\nAs we prepare for the new year, we’re excited about helping your children have their best season yet. We believe parents are key and vital partners, in ensuring that children gain the most from what we offer as a school.\n\nTo support you, we have arranged for all our parents to have free access to some extremely useful webinars specifically designed for parents.\n\nPlease may we ask you to join us for four practical, insightful and impactful sessions which will support you in supporting your child?\n\nSign up here.\n\nSession Dates\n\nJanuary 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nFebruary 8th, 8-9 pm\n\nMarch 14th, 8-9 pm\n\nApril 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nBadminton\n\nThis week was packed with exciting badminton events at Wellington College. On Monday, the school had the honour of hosting a masterclass led by none other than world-class player Ethan Rose. With a focus on perfecting the smash shot, students eagerly listened to tips and techniques from the seasoned athlete, and engaged in spirited 5-point games with him. Then, on Thursday, the badminton team showcased their newfound skills in a showdown against Epsom College, securing an impressive 15-3 victory. The momentum continued into Saturday’s match against the Sports Centre Adult Club, where Wellington College faced off against experienced opponents. Despite the challenge, Wellington emerged victorious, clinching the overall win.\n\nBasketball\n\nLast week started with our U14 Boys playing hard but ultimately losing 29-41 at home to Eton College. We then saw our U18 Girls win 46-13 in the Friday night league. Anna (W) was the highest scorer with 22 points, with Jill-Marie (C) chipping in with 10 points. On Saturday, the Murray won the House Basketball for the Fourth and Fifth Form boys, with one coach calling them ‘the Man City of Wellington Basketball’.\n\nFencing\n\nThis week the fencing squad attended the Public Schools’ Fencing Championships. The Public Schools’ Fencing Championships is an annual three-day fencing competition for children ages 11-18, with fencing at all three weapons. It is the largest competition of its kind in the UK and attracts schools from all over the country.\n\nThis year, Wellington College took twenty fencers across the three days, age groups and all weapons. Fencers ranged from recent beginner to those who had been taking part in the sport for a number of years. Each competition consisted of two pool rounds (where fencers competed in a round-robin style against five other fencers in the pool) followed by direct-elimination rounds initially based upon their seeding from the second round. The majority of our fencers were promoted from the pool rounds to the direct elimination – a good result to start with! Once in the direct-elimination draw, fencers were then in bouts where the first to fifteen hits was promoted to the next round.\n\nAll Wellington College students performed well, relishing the opportunity for individual competition and everyone stepped up their performance. Highlights from the many excellent results:\n\nBoys:\n\n• Joshua (R) – 5th Boys’ Senior Foil\n\n• Victor (R) – 11th Boys’ Junor Sabre\n\nGirls:\n\n• Annie (Hn) – 13th Girls’ Junior foil, 6th Girls’ Junior Sabre\n\n• Keely (O) – 13th Girls’ Senior Sabre\n\nWhen all the results were combined, Annie (R) achieved second place in the Champions of Arms competition (a competition taking into account all entries and all results). A great achievement considering she is in the younger part of the Junior group and has another year to improve this! During the day, all team members were proactive in watching and supporting each other. A real demonstration of College values!\n\nFootball\n\nLast week saw the highly sought after Interhouse Football competitions contested.\n\nThe winners were:\n\nJunior boys – Raglan\n\nSenior boys – Benson\n\nGirls’ competition – Combermere\n\nHockey\n\nThere has been more success in the U16 age group in the hockey club this week with the boys putting in a really gritty performance to win their National Tier 1 quarter-final against Repton. The boys went 1-0 up midway through the first half thanks to an exceptional counter attack by Carter (Bd) that saw Dylan (H) put the ball into an open goal. The remainder of the half saw the boys endure prolonged periods of pressure to go into half time 1-0 up. The second half was a similar affair with both teams going close. Eventually Tom (Pn) carried powerfully into the D to set up Carter (Bd) giving the boys a little breathing space as they snuck into a 2-0 lead. Repton came back strong and scored with twenty minutes to play but thanks to some outstanding defending by the entire team and a remarkable performance in goal by Archie (S) the boys hung on to qualify for the semi-final next term. Well done boys!\n\nNetball\n\nLast Saturday saw an absolute marathon of high class netball for both the U16s and the 1st VII at National Finals. Despite battling hard, the 16s faced some strong opposition and were not able to progress to the final stages, but a stunning effort to get to the last 18! The 1st VII netballers had an equally tough day, showing high skill and physical capacity throughout, playing brilliantly to finish 3rd in the country from over 1,500 teams. Well done to all those involved.\n\nLast weekend also saw the Interhouse Netball competitions.\n\nThe winners were:\n\nJunior girls – Apsley\n\nSenior girls – Apsley\n\nSailing\n\nWell done to Harry (Hl), who has qualified for the ILCA4 World Championships in Portugal later this year.\n\nShooting\n\nAhead of Maple Taste, the selection weekend for the UK Cadet Rifle Team and the GBU18 teams, a quick practice was in order. Penny (A), Adrian (L), Sayan (M), Ricky (M), and Alex (R 5th) put in a good solid afternoon of zeroing and making sure that they were ready. Good luck with upcoming selections to all.\n\nTeam of the Week\n\nThe 1st VII netball team, who finished 3rd at the National Finals out of over 1,500 schools that took part.\n\nBest Senior Season Yet – with Richard Shorter\n\nAs we prepare for the new year, we’re excited about helping your children have their best season yet. We believe parents are key and vital partners, in ensuring that children gain the most from what we offer as a school.\n\nTo support you, we have arranged for all our parents to have free access to some extremely useful webinars specifically designed for parents.\n\nPlease may we ask you to join us for four practical, insightful and impactful sessions which will support you in supporting your child?\n\nSign up here.\n\nSession Dates\n\nJanuary 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nFebruary 8th, 8-9 pm\n\nMarch 14th, 8-9 pm\n\nApril 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nBadminton\n\nThe Wellington College badminton team demonstrated exceptional skill and resilience in two significant fixtures this week. At the highly anticipated annual Harrow Cup on Tuesday, the team engaged in the intense competition, with both pairs showcasing impressive form and coming tantalizingly close to defeating Harrow’s top pair. Despite the narrow margin, Wellington secured a commendable third-place finish, showcasing their strength amongst tough competition, closely trailing behind Eton. Building on this momentum, Saturday saw Wellington facing off against Bradfield in a mixed game filled with excitement. The team delivered a standout performance, clinching a convincing 10-6 victory. Notably, Sherya (W) and Kaiyu (Bd) stood out for their exceptional play, earning a special mention for their contributions to Wellington’s success.\n\nFootball\n\nSaturday afternoon saw the football club entertain fixtures against Radley, Haileybury and Sevenoaks. The senior boys played Radley away. Five really entertaining fixtures with the 1st XI narrowly losing 5-3 in an end to end game with lots of attacking football on display. The highlight performance came from the 2nd XI who won 3-2 in a hard fought win.\n\nThe junior and senior girls’ teams both played away at Sevenoaks. Some really entertaining football was played from both sides but unfortunately Sevenoaks ran out winners in the end. It was extremely pleasing, however, to see lots of progression from both teams. Other highlights came from the U15As who beat Radley 3-1 in a convincing win, and the U14As who won 3-2 against Haileybury in a resilient performance.\n\nGolf\n\nAt the Micklem Trophy, Wellington beat Harrow in round 1 (5-0), Eton in round 2 (4.5-0.5), and Stowe in the final (3-2). The final was decided on the second sudden death play off hole. Joe (Hl), birdied the second playoff hole, a 215 yard par 3, to win his match and therefore the Micklem for the team (career birdie – one of the hardest holes out there!). This is always a heated match between Stowe and Wellington as both are strong teams. Last year, it came down to Joe’s match where he couldn’t seal the victory; however, this year was different – a great redemption story for Joe.\n\nGymnastics\n\nAmelia (W) and Jemima (Hn) and their team won the gold medal at the TeamGym Southern Qualifiers last weekend. They have the highest qualifying score for the British Championships in July.\n\nHockey\n\nLast Tuesday afternoon the U16 girls set off to Lee Valley National Hockey Stadium with the hope of winning the National U16 Hockey Finals. Standing in their way would be Manchester High and the winner of the other semi-final played between Epsom and Oakham. Wednesday’s semi-final was a tense affair and the girls demonstrated grit and resilience in spades as they hung on to a 1-0 win in what was not their best performance of the season but one that they could be proud of, as in knock out hockey, it is sometimes just about getting the job done. Epsom and Oakham finished 2-2 at full time with Oakham winning in the shootout. The final was always going to be tough especially played in front of the 250 supporters that Oakham had bussed to the stadium that morning. The girls were determined to put the disappointment of yesterday’s performance behind them and show everyone in attendance what they were capable of. After a tense start the girls kicked into gear and played some simply outstanding hockey with incredible individual performance across the entire squad that saw the Oakham crowd silenced as they took a commanding 3-0 lead into half-time. The start of the second half saw a period of pressure from Oakham, as they fought to get back into the game, but the girls rallied and scored a further two goals putting in their best performance of the season when it mattered the most. A 5-0 win in a national final is something very special but the performance of the entire squad was even better! To produce their best performance, at a time when their best was required, was exceptional. All year we have emphasised joy and teamwork as our core values, and this could not have been displayed more.\n\nNetball\n\nGreat work from the netballers this week in their block fixtures against Hurst. There were some very mixed results due to the strength of both sides but a great match up nonetheless. This was the last fixture for a lot of the teams this week; a huge well done to all teams this season, so many huge successes along the way but mostly we hope everyone enjoyed their fixtures and time with their teams. A huge thank you for our coaches too!\n\nThe 1st team had their last home fixture this week and won a very close game against Hurst finishing 50-52. It was nailbiter for a last home match for a few of the girls: Saskia(Ap), Charlotte (Ap), Scarlett (W), Macy (C), Annabel (C) and Saffy (Hg)! These girls have been a huge core of our 1st team for many seasons, they will be greatly missed next season but we wish them all the very best with their future netball ambitions and we are sure achievements.\n\nThe 2nd team had a tough match up with Hurstpierpoint, suffering their biggest loss of the term. Nevertheless, this did not distract the girls from putting in all the hard work and effort throughout the fixture, which is why they should be extremely proud of themselves. They have shown resilience, passion, dedication and willingness to keep working hard, some core values that should never go missed. Albeit the score wasn’t the way Wellington would have liked, it didn’t distract from the fact that the girls had had a successful season and have improved throughout the term, both individually and as a team!\n\nWell done to Amelie (W) and her Scotland team, who finished 2nd last weekend at the Netball U17 European Championships – she was captain too, making this even more special.\n\nBest of luck this weekend to the U16s and 1st VII at National Finals.\n\nPolo\n\nOn Thursday afternoon the polo team met Eton at Emsworth arena. The A team held the winning score at each quarter, but narrowly lost to Eton within the final chukka with an end result of 16-17 to Eton. The B team held their position throughout their match too, confidently riding the boys off, and challenging them at every moment, resulting in a nailbiting final chukka. The girls narrowly lost with a final score of 11-12 to Eton. An excellent and challenging end to the Arena season for all of the students in the polo team.\n\nRugby\n\nSunday saw our U14 team play in the QE Barnett tournament; in horrendous conditions, the boys dug in and played well. In the group stages we beat both Dulwich and St Albans, but came second to Bedford. This meant a quarter-final against Berkhamsted, where we were 12 apiece after regular time. The golden point did not go our way and we finished as runners-up in the Plate. The U16 team went to the All England tournament in more wet conditions. The boys played some excellent rugby, but were eventually knocked out by Epsom College in the quarter-final, Epsom going on to win the competition. The seniors took on the first TSC schools 7s at Sixways stadium, former home of the Worcester Warriors. We went with nine intrepid, brave Wellingtonians. The boys, against the odds, played some sensational rugby against the best schools in the country: Sedbergh, Ipswich and Sir Thomas Rich’s School. Even with the odds stacked against them, the boys managed to best RGS Worcester in the semi-final of the Plate playing some of the best VIIs the seniors have played this term. In the Plate final we went down fighting against Llandovery College; we were down to 6 players at some points in the final, which meant we were always going to struggle against a big and physical Llandovery side. Earlier in the week at the Surrey 7s, the seniors also played some fantastic and physically challenging 7s on a big pitch, where they reached the semi-final before the fatigue caught up with them.\n\nSquash\n\nWellington girls played Bradfield last week and ran out formidable 11-0 winners in the first round of games, and even with a change of formation in the second round, the girls played brilliantly to win 8-3. A fantastic effort from all involved.\n\nTriathlon\n\nWell done to Nell (Hg) who has received a prestigious award from the Premier of Bermuda for her national representation in triathlon, particularly at Commonwealth and Caribbean levels.\n\nTeam(s) of the Week\n\nIt will likely come as no surprise that this week we have two teams of the week, both incredibly deserving.\n\nFirstly, the Girls U16 Hockey National Championship winning team from last Thursday, who won a really tough semi-final against Manchester High, but then dominated the final winning 5-0 against Oakham, with the performance described by staff as, ‘some simply outstanding hockey with incredible individual performance across the entire squad’. A huge well done to everyone involved!\n\nSecondly, the Golf team who won the Micklem Trophy, which in many ways represents a national trophy. Over two long days, the team defeated Harrow, Eton and Stowe, with the final being settled after two sudden death playoff holes, an incredible display of resilience and determination. Well done again to all!\n\nBest Senior Season Yet – with Richard Shorter\n\nAs we prepare for the new year, we’re excited about helping your children have their best season yet. We believe parents are key and vital partners, in ensuring that children gain the most from what we offer as a school.\n\nTo support you, we have arranged for all our parents to have free access to some extremely useful webinars specifically designed for parents.\n\nPlease may we ask you to join us for four practical, insightful and impactful sessions which will support you in supporting your child?\n\nSign up here.\n\nSession Dates\n\nJanuary 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nFebruary 8th, 8-9 pm\n\nMarch 14th, 8-9 pm\n\nApril 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nBasketball\n\nLast week was a busy one!\n\n• The Talbot won the 4th and 5th form Girls’ House Basketball\n\n• The Raglan won the 3rd Form Boys’ House Basketball\n\n• The U14 Boys lost 22-43 away at Harrow\n\n• The U18 Boys lost 25-52 away at Harrow\n\n• The U18 Girls beat Bracknell Cobras 36-6 in their Friday night league fixture. Lily (W) and Gabi (Hg) stood out for their shooting and defence, respectively.\n\nFootball\n\nUnfortunately, it was a week of football that was heavily influenced by the weather. No fixtures, but lots of training over the weekend with the 14s and 15s holding a round robin tournament, the 16s participating in gym sessions and the seniors boys and girls team going on a training run. Radley, Haileybury, Shiplake and Sevenoaks are all part of the fixture list for this week.\n\nHockey\n\nIt was another busy week in the hockey club with some tough games against Abingdon and Bradfield, plus the boys found out their opposition for the next round of the Tier 1 England Hockey competitions. The U16 boys will take on Whitgift in the national quarter-final, which we wish them the best of luck for. The boys’ 1st XI also took on Alleyne’s at home on Tuesday afternoon in the next round of the Tier 2 England Hockey Cup, in what was a tough but competitive game.\n\nNetball\n\nLast weekend saw a great round of block fixtures played against Seaford both at home and at the 7s tournament away.\n\nA special mention this week goes to the U14B team who have showed such great efforts this term and again rallied through with a big win of 33-6 on Saturday, adding to their stellar winning streak. Following on from their 42-25 win against Bradfield last week, they won against Seaford 32-16. Players of the match, as chosen by the opposition, were Sophie (O), for some truly impressive interceptions in the D, and Amy (O) for her super fast performance as Centre. Special mention must also go to our shooters Gigi (O) and Francesca (O) who dealt valiantly with strong winds and glaring sun to score some really cracking goals. All in all, another wonderful show of teamwork from an incredibly strong team in all areas of the court. Congratulations girls!\n\nThe U16 girls headed to the Seaford netball tournament ready to fill their boots with tournament experience in the lead-up to Nationals in two weeks’ time. They were grouped in one of two pools and started off with a match against Portsmouth Grammar School. The girls did well to come away with a 4 goal win, with some excellent turnovers from Freya (A) and Freya (T), and looked ahead to Seaford in the following round. After starting strong and going into the half time break with a 4 point lead, the Seaford team pulled it back to equal, when Eden (C) cooly sunk the final goal right on the full time whistle to ensure the Welly girls went up by 1 to take the win.\n\nThey then turned their attention to the 3rd round match against St Joseph’s College. The girls did well to pull ahead by 4 goals with some outstanding shooting from Eden (C) and Kiera (C); however, a clash between Freya (T) and Kiera (C) while both going for the same intercept meant Kiera (C) went down in a heap and was replaced by Sofia (A), who finished off the second half shooting beautifully. Finally, the last pool round saw the Welly girls come up against Brighton College. Some outstanding turnovers from Freya (T) and Freya (A) and great feeding from Tehya (W) and Annabel (C), meant they sealed their place in the cup final, winning by 4.\n\nThe final was a match-up between Wellington and familiar faces, Hurstpierpoint. The girls gave it their all, but it wasn’t meant to be. Hurst pulled away, eventually winning the match 10-4 with some avoidable errors made after a long day of netball. This was a great tournament for the girls to be a part of and puts them in good stead leading into the Nationals tournament next Saturday. Congratulations also to Kiera (C) who was given special mention in making the tournament team.\n\nThe 2nd team had an outstanding day as they were crowned champions of the Seaford College Netball Shield Tournament. The girls had a long day of netball where they played four games in a round robin tournament. Wellington started the competition with a loss to Seaford 2s, which fuelled fire in their next three performances where they beat Portsmouth Grammar School and Gordon’s. After having secured these two wins, Wellington had to win their final game against St John’s Leatherhead, who were one point ahead of them in the table. The game was extremely competitive, however Wellington kept their heads and played some of their best netball this season, narrowly beating St John’s to secure top place, thus winning the Shield! They were outstanding, every single player played a part in the team’s victory, with special mentions to Jess (W) and Sarah (Ap). Jess was exceptional as GD and worked incredibly hard and turned ball on many occasions. She was an attacker’s nightmare! At the other end of the court, Sarah (Ap) was half of the shooting duo alongside Lucy (W) and was on fire with her shooting across the tournament. She was calm and composed and worked alongside Lucy (W) in the attacking circle. The girls were thrilled with the win, which shined a light on a very long day!\n\nRugby\n\nIt was a busy week of 7s. The Seniors played on both Wednesday and Friday. Wednesday saw the boys go to the Middlesex VIIs at St Bendict’s. We won our group beating Windsor boys, John Fisher, London Oratory and drawing with NSB. That meant we played Hampton in the final who came away as winners. Friday saw us at the play in the Ipswich School 7s held at the Grasshoppers RFC in London. This tournament was shortened due to weather and an injury. The Seniors had a tough group but beat Whitgift, Clifton College, RGS Guilford and drew against Hartpury College. Time was not on our side due to delays, our final group game finished at 10.15pm which meant we played the final at 10.20; however, putting in a valiant effort against Millfield, we went down to a slightly fresher side.\n\nOn Tuesday we took two U14 teams to the London Oratory 7s. There was a great deal of excitement, as the boys were able to tick off all the Gail’s coffee shops they have been to as we drove through London on the way to Barn Elms sports grounds. Both teams won their groups playing some excellent 7s in lovely sunny conditions. Wellington A drew John Fisher in the semi-final who were a very big physical team and narrowly lost in a game that ebbed and flowed between the two sides.\n\nWellington B met a very aggressive Dulwich side that played some high quality 7s, and this proved too much as the boys went down, but never stopped trying. A brilliant day that saw 24 boys playing in the sunshine!\n\nThe U14 7s boys then played at Warwick School 7s on Saturday, in spite of a lot of rain, coming away as the Shield winners – a great effort from a tough day. The top performer of the day was Toby (R).\n\nShooting\n\nDespite it being a long weekend, the shooting team had a small representation of four competing in the inaugural CCRS 100 team finals. As CCRS is a Cadet outfit, this meant the team had to be in CCF uniform – looking pretty sharp!\n\nEach member shot two 10 bull match cards to get a score out of 200, with the team averaging a final score of 96 per target. This was an excellent team average, resulting in the team winning 1st place. Well done to the team – Julius (T), Adrain (L), Chung Hang (L), and Natty (W).\n\nTwo members of the team, Natty (W) and Adrian (L) had a three-way tie shoot to settle for the top individual, having both scored 195/200 and one of the Gresham’s team members tying as well. The look of joy on their faces was something to behold; other methods for breaking the tie were discussed – a game of Uno; rock, paper scissors (best of 3); one shot sudden death competition… Alas, another card was deemed fairest. This led to another tie between Natty and the Gresham’s shooter, both getting a 98, beating Adrian out with a 97. Countback was then applied, leaving Natty as the overall winner. Well done to Natty!\n\nThe final event was the Falling Disks – a rapid team shoot event, where teams of three try to shoot 12 clay disks as fast as possible, with a 60 second time limit. Due to being odd numbers, one student from each school created a 4th team aptly named “Barbarians” who shot for “Honours”. Wellington lost to RGS but beat Gresham’s, with RGS winning all their matches and so were crowned the winners, Wellington 2nd, and Gresham’s 3rd.\n\nSwimming\n\nLast Friday, the swimming team attended the annual Bath Cup event at the London Aquatic pool. The boys’ team put in a fantastic effort, despite facing fierce competition from older competitors. Special mention for Josh (M) who achieved PBs in each of his races. The highlight of the event, however, was the girls’ team who came 8th out of 72 schools in the medley relay, placing Wellington firmly on the swimming map. Well done to all involved.\n\nTeam(s) of the Week\n\nThe Netball 2nd VII, who won the Shield at the Seaford 7s tournament last Saturday.\n\nThe Rugby 7s U16 boys who, at the Guildford Grammar 7s, won their group and quarter-final before coming so close to beating Trinity in the semi-final, narrowly losing 12-14.\n\nBest Senior Season Yet – with Richard Shorter\n\nAs we prepare for the new year, we’re excited about helping your children have their best season yet. We believe parents are key and vital partners, in ensuring that children gain the most from what we offer as a school.\n\nTo support you, we have arranged for all our parents to have free access to some extremely useful webinars specifically designed for parents.\n\nPlease may we ask you to join us for four practical, insightful and impactful sessions which will support you in supporting your child?\n\nSign up here.\n\nSession Dates\n\nJanuary 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nFebruary 8th, 8-9 pm\n\nMarch 14th, 8-9 pm\n\nApril 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nBadminton\n\nThe Monday proved to be one of the highlights of the badminton year so far. A session in the evening run by Marcus Ellis and Laruen Smith, Rio 2016 bronze medallists, gave the Wellington students a masterclass in badminton. The starstruck badminton team put on their best performance and tried to learn as much as they could.\n\nBasketball\n\nOn Thursday, a mixed U14 team lost 19-50 to an undefeated LVS U14 Boys team.\n\nOn Saturday, the U16 Boys travelled to Tonbridge looking to continue their unbeaten record against other independent schools this season. After going 18-4 down in the first quarter, a huge three-pointer from Ishan (M) was one of the standout moments of a rally, which saw our boys finally take the lead with three minutes to go. At 54-52 up with 90 seconds to go, a frenetic finish saw our boys lose 54-56. Standout performances came from captain Hakan (L), Hugo (M), Ollie (M) and Suveer (M).\n\nFencing\n\nSchool commitments and injuries again forced a number of changes to our regular teams for a return fixture to the RGS. The hosts requested the matches using the old system of best of nine fights to five hits instead of the modern race to 45 hits over nine fights.\n\nFoil and sabre were fought at the same time with James (L) captaining for the first time. He was joined in epee by Tom (Bl) and Helen (W). RGS took an early lead but some determined fencing narrowed the gap and the match hung in the balance over the last two fights with the difference being one hit to give RGS a 5-4 victory.\n\nOur sabre team were expecting a tough away match after their last encounter with their strong sabreurs. Victor (R) and James (Bl) were joined by Keely (O) for her second cap, but the hosts proved too strong claiming a 9-0 victory.\n\nFoil followed with Tom again volunteering to fence two weapons and he was joined by Annie (Hn) and Radley (R). RGS again took an early lead, but Annie secured two good victories and Tom showed he had great potential in foil as well as epee. One additional hit from him would have given him two victories as well, but RGS edged it 6-3.\n\nFootball\n\nAnother very busy weekend for the Football Club which saw 14 very competitive fixtures. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd XI senior teams ran out winners against Magdalen College School with the stand out performance coming from the 3rd XI who won 9-0. The 5th and 6th XIs had some terrific performances against Sevenoaks with the 6th XI extending their unbeaten season with a 10-0 win and the 5th XI narrowly losing 4-3.\n\nThe U16s, 15s and 14s all had hard fixtures against St Paul’s School. With the opposition being very strong, it was pleasing to see some tightly contested games with a stand out performance from the U14As, who narrowly lost 3-2 in a high quality game.\n\nGolf\n\nThis week, seven players competed in the Swift Schools Strokeplay event at Dundonald Links in Scotland. A hugely competitive field of 49 players turned out for the 54-hole world ranked event across two days. The team finished 6th overall in some cold conditions, maintaining our current 3rd place in the national order of merit. Highlight of the week was an eagle 2 from Grace (Hg) who holed out from 145 yards on the signature 13th hole! A great trip and experience for all involved – well done everyone for representing Wellington so well.\n\nHockey\n\nThis week saw the boys’ 1st Xl travel to St George’s in the next round of the England Hockey Tier 2 Cup. After conceding goals in the first half, the boys found themselves 1-4 down but rallied superbly well in the second half to score three late goals and take the game to a shootout. Arthur (R) was superb in goal and the boys held their nerve to win 2-1 on shuffles. The weekend saw the 2nd Xl record a convincing win over Teddies too, thanks to another all round team performance.\n\nNetball\n\nThe U14s had a warm up game against Eagle House on Wednesday ahead of their IAPS tournament this week and last week’s Friday Night Lights match for the U14s. It was a great game, very well contested by both sides, a good squad performance. It gave the girls an opportunity to try out some other positions. Olivia (Ap) and Lily (C) had a go in the shooting circle and Isabel came out at centre; having played so well, they will be good contenders in those rotations for the future.\n\nThe U14Cs had a good performance against a strong Bradfield team (unbeaten other than losing the first match of season). The victory was largely due to great execution of Tuesday’s training. Defensive skills added to repertoire: hands/restrict/intercept, which was really noticeably improved! Well done to Katya (T) and Clara-Rose (C) for winning players of the match!\n\nThe U14Ds had an extremely convincing 45-4 win, with the girls continuing to work hard throughout even when playing out of position. A particular highlight was regular GK Clemmie’s final goal of the match. Well done to Ava and Mila for winning player of the match!\n\nThe U14Es went out in full force on Saturday with a squad large enough to cover two teams. Inspirationally led by Bea (C), the girls gave every quarter 110% effort; they were determined to win from the forefront and were delighted with their 22-19 achievement. Our attackers were particularly strong and led with multiple goals from the offset, missing very few. Well done to Saskia (Ap), Ella (T) and Bea (C) for their stalwart goal scoring. Neve (T) and Valentina (Hn) were inspirational in maintaining energy in the centre court even when the first quarter was a little longer than expected.\n\nThe U14F team played with resilience and determination last weekend. Their final score was impressive – winning 24-14. Gayatri (A) showed great leadership, being captain of the team. Diya (W) was awarded Woman of the Match, for her shooting skills.\n\nThe U15Cs won 28-15; A fantastic match thanks to excellent teamwork from all players. Ava (Ap) (defence) and Vivi (Hn) (attack) were the players of the match.\n\nAn excellent game of netball for the U15Ds winning 47-17, with their skilful passing even being complimented by opposition parents! Several brilliant interceptions were made throughout the game by our centre court and defence, as well as very consistent shooting from both GA Matilda (A) and GS Lelia (O), who both won player of the match.\n\nA very rewarding and worthwhile game for the U15Es of chaotic intensity mixed with super netball from both sides culminating in the smiles of two teams who had clearly enjoyed their time on court in the sunshine. The WC players have certainly improved greatly over the term and the parents who were watching echoed this feeling. Player of the match is not appropriate as none deserved not to be mentioned. The final score was 22-10.\n\nFriday Night Lights\n\nU14As made a strong start against St Helen’s and St Katherine’s in the Friday Night Lights match. At the end of the first quarter the teams were level at 4-4. The opposition came out strongly in the second quarter and opened up a lead (12-8) by half time which they extended further in the remaining quarters. The U14As fought hard in front of a supportive crowd to try to close the gap but HelKats took the win comfortably 25-14.\n\nThe 1st team put on a fantastic performance against St Helen’s and St Katherine’s for Friday Night Lights! Starting very well contested, the girls were able to pull away quite considerably. Well done to the newest member of our team Lydia (C) for winning player of the match!\n\nThe 1st team won the Bradfield Invitational tournament on Saturday. Having got off to a slow start and losing their first match against Bradfield 6-4, the girls fought back hard to win the remainder of their games. The result came down to goal difference but with some high scoring games, the advantage fell in our favour and the girls took home the gold! Well done to everyone but a special mention to Lola (Ap) and Juliet (A) for coming into the team and making such a great impact throughout the day.\n\nRugby\n\nThe Senior 7s team went to Gordon’s School under the lights and played some superb 7s in the group stages, but went down to an excellent Brighton College side in the semi-final.\n\nThe U16s went to the Guildford Grammar 7s on Sunday and won their group beating some excellent sides: RGS Guildford, Eton, Portsmouth Grammar and Hampton School, then Brighton College in the quarter-finals, and came so close to beating Trinity in the semi-final, narrowly losing 12-14.\n\nThe U14s went to Eton on Sunday coming second in their group, meaning they played in the 3/4th playoff where they met a very good St Paul’s side, who lost narrowly to Radley who went to win the tournament. Bertie (Hl) worked tirelessly all day and made a number of try-saving tackles, and the team finished 4th overall.\n\nWell done to Bill (Bd) who played for Italy U18 against France. Bill came off the bench and was involved in the maul drive that scored the only try of the day for Italy.\n\nShooting\n\nWith only one shoulder-to-shoulder match left for the calendar year for the .22 season, our attention now turns to the remaining postal competitions; The biggest of these is the British Schools Smallbore Rifle Association (BSSRA) National Match. We’ve been very fortunate with 10 members of the Shooting team being selected to represent England’s A, B, C, and D teams against the other home countries. This is an amazing achievement, when there are 12 spaces per team up for grabs, and to have nearly 25% of the representation is a testament to the depth of talent our shooting team has.\n\nCongratulations to Penny (A), Liam (R), and Fabian (M) for making the A team. Congratulations to Natty (W), Ilyas (S), Ricky (M), and Julius (T) for making the B team. Congratulations to Alex (R 5th) for making the C team. Congratulations to Sayan (M) and Chung Hang (L) for making the D team. Wish the team and these individuals all the best as we make our final push to the end of the season with more success.\n\nSquash\n\nThe girls’ squash team faced Wycombe Abbey, with the match turning out to be the closest girls’ match ever. It ended up with Jess (C) gaining the winning match for the whole fixture on the last match, with a tight 3/2 win. Every game was very tight with some fantastic rallies and lots of smiles all round. The girls have been working so hard lately and this could be seen in their performance. Well done all!\n\nTeam(s) of the Week\n\nThis week’s Team of the Week goes to the girls’ squash team, following their closest ever win against Wycombe Abbey.\n\nBest Senior Season Yet – with Richard Shorter\n\nAs we prepare for the new year, we’re excited about helping your children have their best season yet. We believe parents are key and vital partners, in ensuring that children gain the most from what we offer as a school.\n\nTo support you, we have arranged for all our parents to have free access to some extremely useful webinars specifically designed for parents.\n\nPlease may we ask you to join us for four practical, insightful and impactful sessions which will support you in supporting your child?\n\nSign up here.\n\nSession Dates\n\nJanuary 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nFebruary 8th, 8-9 pm\n\nMarch 14th, 8-9 pm\n\nApril 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nBadminton\n\nWellington played against Eton. With some of the top players out of the fixture, it proved to be a challenging game with home ground advantage going towards some fast shuttles. Welly lost 8-1, but with some tightly contested matches. All the players developed their skills and teamwork. Shout out goes to Danny (M) and Kit (Bl) for the only pair to win their matches.\n\nCricket\n\nHalf term saw a senior boys’ cricket trip to South Africa, with 15 boys travelling to play some of the toughest cricketing schools in the Western Province and South Africa as a whole. This is the first time since COVID that the tour has returned. There was some incredibly tough cricket for the group, in some sweltering conditions at times.\n\nHaving landed, the tour party headed for Somerset College for an early training session to get the travel time out of the legs, ahead of a T20 game against The Leading Edge Academy on day 2. The first T20 game saw WCCC make 123-7 off their 20 overs, which was a respectable total for their first outing. In reply The Leading Edge Academy also made 123, seeing the game tied, with Rory (Bl) taking 4 wickets and Tom (Hl) 3 wickets. The game went to a superover, which WCCC won courtesy of two towering sixes hit by Eddie (Bd) and Toby (S). Day 3 of the trip saw the group entertained at the Newlands Cricket Ground watching the SA20 final, which provided some inspiration for more cricket to come. The team took part in a T20 festival at Somerset College, recoding two wins from three games with leading performers with the bat being Toby (S) making a score of 50+ and a magnificent 101* off 41 balls, Eddie (Bd) who made 47* against Somerset College and Hugo (Bn) who made a score of 57, Hughie (Hl) scoring 44 and Sam (R) 39 not out. Wickets on the day were largely shared around, but notable performances came from Sam (Bd) taking 4 wickets and Eddie (Bd) 3 against Outeniqua and Alex (R) 4 against Somerset College. The team finished 2nd overall but Toby (S) received the player of the tournament award for his magnificent century.\n\nTougher games followed for the team against Rondebosch and Bishops, under their floodlights, representing for many a real one-off opportunity, albeit all the grounds played at are stunning with the back drop of Table Mountain. The group were unable to record wins against the likes of Rondebosch and Bishops, but in the final game against Wynberg did show they were learning and beginning to adapt to the tough conditions, with the team bowling and fielding the best they had, despite a late onslaught from Wyneberg, seeing them reach 265-3 off 35 overs. In reply with the bat the team again showed they were moving in the right direction ahead of the upcoming English season, in reaching 174-6 with strong knocks at the top of the order from Toby (S) and Hughie (Hl) and good lower order scored of 30 and 20 from Rory (Bl) and Sam (R) respectively, but with Hugo (Bn) holding the innings together with a score of 55*. Hugo (Bn) also received Cricket Colours following this game too.\n\nDespite tough fixtures, the team won three T20 games of seven games in total, with one of these wins coming from a superover decider, so all in all this was a great trip for all. Everyone on the trip will have learnt much about their cricket ahead of the upcoming season in England, which is something for the group to build on too. Particular well dones go to: with the bat, Toby (S) for scoring a hundred and a fifty in two T20 games and Hugo (Bn) for two scores of fifty and with the ball to Sam (Bd) taking six wickets and Eddie (Bd) eight.\n\nHockey\n\nThere was a lot of hockey leading up to half term, which saw the girls’ U15s finish as runners-up in the Independent Schools Hockey Cup, a fantastic effort and congratulations also to our U16 girls who have qualified for the National semi-finals/finals in March. Well done to all.\n\nNetball\n\nUnfortunately a lot of our Charterhouse block fixtures were cancelled due to poor weather, with only the U16A, U16B, 2s and 3s playing their fixtures in a shortened format. Both the U16A and U16B played out thrilling games against Charterhouse’s 1sts and 3rds. The U16As won narrowly 24-22, due to excellent shooting from Keira (C) and Sof (A). The U16Bs game went goal for goal, with a late interception from Amelie (A) denying Charterhouse the win – the final score 17 all.\n\nWhat an amazing half term it was for netball overall. Some huge team successes and a lot to look forward to after half term with lots more matches and the U16 and U19 National Finals!!!\n\nPolo\n\nThe Polo Club A and B teams met Harrow on Thursday 8th February at Emsworth.\n\nThe A team started off strong equalising in the first quarter. The second quarter saw Harrow take the lead, ending at half time 5/8 to Harrow. Across the last two quarters our team comprised of Leo (Pn) (Captain), Will (Bl) and Aramaya (Pn), who all worked extremely well together, keeping defence lines strong, making exceptional ride-offs, and backing each other up leading to some fantastic goals and pulling the victory back for Wellington. An excellent game and well-deserved win for Wellington with an end score of 12/9.\n\nThe B team comprised of Carl (L) (Captain), AC (Hn) and Elizabeth (T). Immediately this team ruled the arena. They held their game throughout the three chukkas, against an opposition who did everything they could to break down our team dynamic. Another excellent win for Wellington with an end score of 4/2.\n\nRugby\n\nThe Rugby 7s season is now in full swing and the U15s and U18s boys have already had early success, winning the Eton and Haberdashers’ tournaments respectively, and we look forward to more to come.\n\nShooting\n\nLast week saw the shooting team compete against Charterhouse School in what is to be believed the first shoulder-to-shoulder match in smallbore in over 18 (possibly 20) years!\n\nThe match was hotly contested, with both teams putting forward strong junior (5 Bull match) and senior (10 Bull match) teams. For the junior team, Alex (R) and Natty (W) top scored with 100/100, with the team of five dropping only 5 points in total, beating their opponents by 7 points. For the seniors, with teams of four, Liam (R) put in our highest score with a 98/100, with the team scoring 388/400, 17 points ahead of Charterhouse.\n\nAll that aside, both teams gelled well together and it was yet another fantastic opportunity for students to meet and talk, helping build good relationships with other shooters from other schools – an important thing for any of our shooters wishing to go touring with either the UK Cadet Rifle team, the Athelings, or the GB U19 team!\n\nSkiing\n\nThe trip report for the British Schoolgirls’ Ski Races is a week delayed as the organisers needed some time to finalise the race results. For the Wellington A team of Emily (Ap), Lucy (O) and Kitty (Hn) it was the worth the wait. The A team finished 2nd in Giant Slalom, 1st in Slalom and for the second year in a row were the best school in the whole competition, winning the Lilywhite Trophy for best overall school, the first successful defence of the title since 2008. Team Wellington did well in the induvial awards too, Emily (Ap) won the U18 Giant Slalom, Slalom and overall, Kitty (Hn) was 3rd in the U14 Slalom and Georgia (O) was 3rd in the U18 non-registered Slalom and overall. A great week had by all on and off the slope.\n\nFollowing his Silver and Bronze medals in the U18 Giant Slalom and U18 Slalom at the British Schoolboys’ Ski Races, Sebastian T (Bn) stepped up over half term to the adult International FIS races at the 2024 English Alpine Championships in Bormio, Italy, securing personal bests in his Slalom and Giant Slalom, before completing his first FIS Super G race (in which he got to race against the Swiss national team).\n\nFollowing her U18 Giant Slalom and U18 Slalom Gold medals at the British Schoolgirls’ Ski Races, Emily T (Ap) stepped up over half term to the adult International FIS races at the 2024 English Alpine Championships in Bormio, Italy. Having managed personal bests in her Giant Slalom and Slalom races, she went one further in the Super G and not only achieved a personal best, she secured her highest FIS finish (8th), and, in her junior year, became the 2024 English National Women’s U18 Super G Champion.\n\nSwimming\n\nCongratulations to Martha (O) who has won the award of the U16 Girls category at the Bracknell and Wokingham Swimming Club, a testament to all her hard work.\n\nTeam(s) of the Week\n\nThe boys’ and girls’ ski teams from the British Schools’ Races.\n\nBest Senior Season Yet – with Richard Shorter\n\nAs we prepare for the new year, we’re excited about helping your children have their best season yet. We believe parents are key and vital partners, in ensuring that children gain the most from what we offer as a school.\n\nTo support you, we have arranged for all our parents to have free access to some extremely useful webinars specifically designed for parents.\n\nPlease may we ask you to join us for four practical, insightful and impactful sessions which will support you in supporting your child?\n\nSign up here.\n\nSession Dates\n\nJanuary 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nFebruary 8th, 8-9 pm\n\nMarch 14th, 8-9 pm\n\nApril 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nBadminton\n\nThe Wellington mixed badminton team travelled the short journey to Bradfield on Thursday and brough back the win with some excellent teamwork and an increasingly assured display as the match progressed. The top two pairs of Amy O (W) and Oli S (T), and Kaiyu G (Bd) and Shreya S (W) won all four of their ties, showing great ruthlessness in finishing off points with smashes and net kills. James V (Bd) and Mirabelle L (Hg) shook off a shaky start to grow as a pair and only narrowly lost their last two ties to good opposition. Special mention, however, should go to Sasha P (Bl) and Hannah T (Hg) for an excellent display founded on great communication, position and shot selection to bag two crucial wins against the Bradfield 3rd and 4th pairs. Overall, it was a brilliant performance and a well-deserved 10-6 win.\n\nWellington also played in the Chartherhouse Cup. Bill S (T) put on his top performance and played some of his best matches for the school. With tough competition from Winchester, Wellington came in 3rd place.\n\nFencing\n\nFencing Match Report vs Marlborough Away 1/2/24\n\nThis week exams and injuries forced a number of changes to our regular teams but also offered new opportunities. At the request of the hosts, the matches were fought to best of nine fights instead of the modern race to 45 hits over nine fights\n\nFoil and epee were fought at the same time with captain Joshua (R) joined by Tom (Bl) and Marwa (Hg) in foil. Epee also featured Tom (Bl) along with James (L) and Helen (W). Both Tom and Marwa had offered to switch from their preferred weapons to cover absences and it meant Tom had to quickly switch between concurrent matches.\n\nWhile Joshua showed his usual prowess winning two fights and losing the third 4-5, Tom and Marwa found the change of weapons difficult and Marlborough won 2-7.\n\nEpee was much closer and although the home team won 6-3, two fights were lost 4-5, so just two hits given the other way would have secured a win 5-4. James was again in fine form winning two and losing the third by just one hit.\n\nAn exciting end-to-end sabre match concluded the fixture with Keeley (O) making her debut along with Jacob (R) and Freddie (R). The home team were physically very strong and pushed hard but could not match our sabreurs for technical ability. Keeley scored some excellent ‘stop-hit’ counter attacks and showed she has the making of an excellent sabreur. Freddie’s performance showed that he is equally at home with epee and sabre and Jacob put in his usual quality performance. The match was won 5-4 but two hits given differently would have secured a 7-2 win.\n\nFootball\n\nLots of football on last week again, but special mentions to the senior boys 2nd and 3rd XIs, who were brilliant in their wins against Reading Blue Coat.\n\nHockey\n\nThe U15 Girls Indoor Hockey team had an enjoyable day on Friday at a friendly invitational tournament, finishing in 2nd place . The Girls 1st team had a good win against Kingston Grammar and the weekend saw some good wins for the boys against Haileybury.\n\nNetball\n\nThe U19s finished as regional champions in regional rounds of National Schools on Saturday. They finished 2nd in their group to Stowe meaning they matched up against St Swithun’s in the semi-finals. The girls played so well in the semis, turning over lots of ball in defence from and in combination with some very impressive shooting. The game was extremely well played and finished with a very narrow margin score line of 7-6 to Wellington! The girls then took on Stowe in the final. Having lost to them in the group rounds, the girls were keen to show how they could perform under pressure; with some time to regroup and analyse from the first performance against them, the girls came out strong and took the game from the start. The game finished 14-9 to Wellington. An amazing team effort from all our girls who showed true grit and determination and got a very well deserved result.\n\nA few days break from regionals, the 1st team had a very quick turn around with a semi-final cup match against Berkhamsted on Monday. Unfortunately, the game got off to a slow start with the first quarter score ending 8-18. The girls came back fighting in the seond quarter with the final quarter score being 12-12. In the last half of the game, the girls battled hard but it unfortunately proved too big a margin to pull back from. The final score was 42-57 to Berkhamsted. Well done to all our girls, it was a great squad effort. The girls still have lots to look forward to and train for ahead of Nationals.\n\nThe U16 netball team finished 2nd in our group and therefore, had to face St Helen and St Kat’s in the semi-final who are a tough opposition. The girls showed incredible character and started so strong with an early intercept from Tehya (W) at C really inspiring the team and pushing them forward. They played with composure and displayed such intelligent play. They won the game 12-7! In the final they displayed dominance again with a slick performance against Hurst to become the South Regional U16 winners. What really impressed me was their resilience and teamwork; all 10 girls stuck together, cheered each other on and really believed in themselves and each other in those final two games! We are so proud of them!\n\nSkiing\n\nThe boys’ ski team had success on their recent trip to Wengen, Switzerland for the British Schoolboys’ Races with some tough competition against some national team talent. After two great days of training and a tight loss against Harrow for the A team in the parallel slalom, the Boys competed in the Giant Slalom on the famous Lauberhorn piste. Success came from Sebastian (Bn) who finished 2nd in the U18 category. Also, there was some fantastic skiing from Morgan (Bn) to finish 6th in the U14 category. On the second day of races was the slalom, with some great preparation done with our coaches and experienced skiers to create a team environment as for many this was their first time in a race environment. Sebastian (Bn) performed once again to finish 3rd in U18 category and Oscar (Bd) finished 2nd in the U21 category. Further congratulations must go to Hadrian (Bd) who finished 3rd in the unregistered category for the U14s. The overall results were equally impressive with the Boys A team finishing 3rd overall and the B team finishing 7th overall. A great success for the Wellington College Ski Club.\n\nTeam(s) of the Week\n\nThe U16A and 1st team netballers who both became Regional Champions and have now qualified for National Finals which, for the 1st team, is the third year in a row.\n\nBest Senior Season Yet – with Richard Shorter\n\nAs we prepare for the new year, we’re excited about helping your children have their best season yet. We believe parents are key and vital partners, in ensuring that children gain the most from what we offer as a school.\n\nTo support you, we have arranged for all our parents to have free access to some extremely useful webinars specifically designed for parents.\n\nPlease may we ask you to join us for four practical, insightful and impactful sessions which will support you in supporting your child?\n\nSign up here.\n\nSession Dates\n\nJanuary 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nFebruary 8th, 8-9 pm\n\nMarch 14th, 8-9 pm\n\nApril 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nBadminton\n\nThis week, Wellington College faced Swifts Badminton Club in a neck-and-neck battle that ended in a 10-10 draw on matches. The competition was marked by intense rallies and closely contested games, with scores as tight as 20-22 showcasing the players’ resilience. Despite the even match split, Wellington emerged victorious when total points were tallied, underscoring their strategic prowess and teamwork.\n\nFootball\n\nLast week once again saw a lot of pupils out representing Wellington FC. Saturday’s fixtures with Abingdon saw some really challenging games but even so there were some close tussles for the 6th XI, drawing 5-5 and the U14B 3-3. Furthermore, despite a 4-2 loss, it was great to see the Girls 1st XI in action against Teddies in the week too.\n\nHockey\n\nWell done to the U15 Girls who progressed from their National Cup quarter-final with a 3-0 win over Gresham’s. Good luck to them on Finals day on Tuesday 6 February. Congratulations also to the U16 Girls following their 3-2 win, which included a thrilling end to the game against Cranleigh and progress to the National quarter-final. The junior boys’ team also recorded a strong win over St John’s Leatherhead last weekend.\n\nNetball\n\nIt was a packed week of fixtures last week for netball, with block fixtures against St Edward’s and Marlborough. Some team highlights below.\n\nWell done to our 1st team this week for their quarter-final win against Bromsgrove! We have now secured a place in the semi-finals! The girls had an outstanding performance to win the match 37-54! Emily (Ap) was our PoM on the day but the whole team was fantastic, well done girls!\n\nThe Rugby vs Netball match on Friday night was a spectacular event and turned out to be much closer than expected; the girls stole the win 31-29. Everyone was kept on the edge of their seats till the very end. Well done to both teams.\n\nThe U14As had a decisive win over Marlborough 41-22. It was an opportunity for the coaches to try some different combinations ahead of final selection for Regional Finals on 3 February. In addition to a good team performance there were also some great individual performances from Isabelle (C) (GS/GA) who worked the shooting circle well to create plenty of scoring opportunities and Ella (W) (WD/GK) who marked doggedly to keep the WA off the circle edge when she was playing WD and got numerous tips and interceptions at GK. These performances deservedly earned them the opposition Player of the Match nominations. The players worked hard to put into practice some of the tactics they had been working on in training, which was very pleasing to see.\n\nThe U14Cs had another impressive scoreline resulting from focus on keeping possession with simple direct play. Work on timing and defending in Tuesday training and players working hard to offer all around ball really paid off. Sooner or later great interceptions led to a turnover and shooters again had high conversion rate – 11-0 2nd quarter was particularly good. Thanks to Cecily (C) for good work as captain having just joined the team and congratulations to Elisa (W) PoM dominating in defence.\n\nWell done to the seven girls who gave their all in the U14C match against Marlborough (away). Thanks to Ella (Hn) and Mila (W) who came up from Ds. We were 4-7 down after 1st quarter, taking time to settle as lots of changes and travel. Captain Elisa (W) did great a job and when we executed match focus: keeping possession with simple direct play, we, at times, played efficient netball that had Marlborough in trouble (winning 2nd quarter 5-4). However opponents had a stronger team on the day – we had too many penalty passes against us for handling, footwork and obstruction which tipped the balance to Marlborough. Congratulations to Elisa (W) joint PoM for the second week and Sahana (A) PoM on her debut.\n\nThe U16Bs tried incredibly hard, but it unfortunately wasn’t a fair contest. A 6’2″ GS and a 6’1″ GK against fifth formers very much tipped the balance in Teddies favour. Credit to our girls – they are playing some great netball and are looking to implement some more of their progress in the next couple of weeks!\n\nThe 4ths secured their first win of the season against Teddies. With the help of consistency within centre court and a strong effort from the defence, the shooters were able to secure 16 goals, eventually winning 16-14. Special mention goes to Zara (W) for her impressive performance in goal and to Lucy (W) who was awarded player of the match for her defensive performance.\n\nThe U14E team had their first match at the weekend and had a truly outstanding performance to secure the win! Grace (O) played out of position in defence and was truly outstanding. The girls played so well, Mrs Phillips was very proud of the whole team!\n\nFinally, a big well done to Amelie (W) on being selected into the Scotland U17s and Netball Europe, as captain too!\n\nSquash\n\nLast week saw a fantastic Squash fixture against Marlborough. Wellington fielded two junior and two girls’ teams for the first time at the same fixture. 22 games were played overall, with some playing twice. Well done to the eight players who won their fixtures too, in a really competitive afternoon.\n\nSwimming\n\nIn the first fixture of the Lent Term, the Swimming team competed against Winchester. Despite narrowly missing out on winning the gala, the swim team offered Winchester fierce competition. The U16 Boys put in a particularly strong performance, with Vlad (M), William (M), Max (Pn), and Rufus (Bn) coming 1st in both the medley and freestyle relay. Well done to all involved.\n\nTeam of the Week\n\nTeam of the Week is the U16 Boys basketball team who won 58-32 on Saturday against Tonbridge, with Hakan (L) scoring 27 points, Hugo (M) scoring 22 points, and Ollie (M) putting in an outstanding defensive performance. The U16 Boys, with the same core players, also won 34-32 in their CVL fixture on Friday night against a highly rated Berkshire Bulldogs club side.\n\nBest Senior Season Yet – with Richard Shorter\n\nAs we prepare for the new year, we’re excited about helping your children have their best season yet. We believe parents are key and vital partners, in ensuring that children gain the most from what we offer as a school.\n\nTo support you, we have arranged for all our parents to have free access to some extremely useful webinars specifically designed for parents.\n\nPlease may we ask you to join us for four practical, insightful and impactful sessions which will support you in supporting your child?\n\nSign up here.\n\nSession Dates\n\nJanuary 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nFebruary 8th, 8-9 pm\n\nMarch 14th, 8-9 pm\n\nApril 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nBasketball\n\nWellington Basketball hosted two double-headers last week, Winchester and Stowe on Thursday and Saturday respectively. A Wellington U14 mixed team lost to Winchester U14 Boys. Although a defeat, the fixture was notable for giving debuts to a number of our U14 boys and girls. A Wellington U15 mixed team also lost, this time to Stowe U15 Boys. Captain Balthazar (Bn), Bennett (Pn), and Marcus (Bl) all put in strong performances.\n\nOur U16 Boys won both of their fixtures. Against Winchester, our intense defence was the platform for our boys to lead throughout the fixture. Top scorers against Winchester were:\n\n• Hugo (M) – 18 points\n\n• Hakan (L) – 17 points\n\n• Ollie (M) – 8 points\n\nThe 40-34 win against a physical Stowe U16 Boys was built on skilful play, with top scorers:\n\n• Hakan (L) – 15 points\n\n• Hugo (M) – 11 points\n\n• Suveer (M) – 8 points\n\nFencing\n\nTriangular vs Eton & Bradfield at Eton\n\nIn the first fixture of the year our fencers travelled to Eton who hosted a triangular with Bradfield. In a change to the usual format the match result would be decided by the total number of individual victories to five hits across all three weapons with three fencers per weapon. This needed a total of eighty-one fights to be completed across six pistes and for each team member to contribute victories if an overall win was to be achieved.\n\nThe sabre match was finished first with Wellington winning with 14 victories ahead of Eton with 8 and Bradfield 5. Special mention must go to Victor (R) who won all his fights.\n\nEpee proved much closer with Bradfield getting an unexpected winning 10 followed by Eton with 9 and Wellington on 8 with James (L) winning 4 of 6 fights.\n\nFoil was the last to finish with our fencers pushing for a win over Eton but knowing that Eton would win overall if too many fights were dropped. Eton scraped a narrow victory 14 to 13, with Joshua (R) winning all his fights.\n\nA tense few minutes followed as the results were totalled and Wellington emerged overall winners with 35 followed by Eton on 31 and Bradfield on 15. The change of format produced an exciting and challenging afternoon of fencing and a very worthwhile opener in the run-up to the Public Schools in March.\n\nFootball\n\nAnother bumper week for the Football Club with nine fixtures played and only a handful lost to the freezing weather. Despite a mix of results across all teams, the Club won more games than they lost, showing great performances and effort across the board.\n\nHockey\n\nLast week saw the Girls U15A have a strong win against Farnborough Hill, the Girls U16A won a close match with Epsom 1-0, and the Girls 1st XI an away 1-1 draw with Bede’s in the Tier 1 league. The U16A Hockey boys also had a great 2-2 draw with Cranleigh on Saturday in a tight game.\n\nNetball\n\nIt was another busy week for Netball with fixtures for the Seniors against Brighton on Thursday and a block fixture against Canford and Pangbourne on Saturday.\n\nThursday’s games were well contested throughout, with the 4ths securing a thrilling 16-all draw. Hustle from Lucy (W), Ruby (Hn) and Nat (Ap) secured vital possession in defence, with Zara (W) scoring with the last throw of the game. Saturday saw many matches played in good spirits, with impressive wins across the junior years. The 1s played a very well contested game securing a great win against Brighton 51-40. Special congratulations to the 2s and 3s who secured their first wins, and the U14Es who had a great win away against Pangbourne’s B team 22-5.\n\nFull match reports for Saturday fixtures against Canford:\n\nThe U14As played very well against a strong Canford team. A stand-out performance from Ella (W) in the defensive circle saw her make many interceptions and tips. Isabelle (W) and Willow (T) battled to get free in the shooting circle against a tall, physical defence. Wellington were within 4 goals of Canford going into the final quarter, but too many unforced errors enabled Canford to ease away to take the victory 31-19. Players of the match were Isabelle (W) and Ella (W).\n\nA very strong win this week for the U14C team against Canford. A strong 1st quarter set the tone for the match and impressive overall scoring was more than 1 goal a minute (when half of the plays are started by opposition centre passes which have to be turned over) which is a direct result of delivering the above and particularly keeping possession and good shot conversion. Thanks to Mabel (Ap) (Captain) for good leadership in warm-up, leading by example on court and team talks. Jemima (Hn) and Clara-Rose (C) were voted joint players of the match for the second week running (this time by the opposition).\n\nPangbourne’s A team proved a stretch too far for us this weekend but huge credit to our Wellington girls, they kept trying and every quarter came out to challenge Pangbourne. The overall result was 22-13. Mila (W) moved from WD to GD and did really well getting PoM. Ella (Hn) got attacking PoM. Well done girls!\n\nIt was a gritty performance from all players in the 15As with a tight match against Canford. Resilient defence and thoughtful feeding from centre court saw them to a 25-20 win with a player of the match performance from Rosie (Ap).\n\nA great collective effort from the U15C team who outperformed Canford in all quarters except the last. An excellent first game for the Cs by Izzy (C) and Serena (W).\n\nThe U16Cs, despite being completed intimidated by the incredibly tall opposition who were all sixth formers and included a 6ft 1in goal shooter, the girls started strong and Canford struggled to keep any possession. Superb shooting stats from Izzy (O) and Amelie (A) meant that we converted nearly every CP and a few turnovers too. The defence worked incredibly hard to stop the ball getting to the GS, and particular mention must go to Rosamund (O) and Martha (A) for their tight marking and quick footwork, cutting out that last pass in to goal.\n\nFour bags of Haribos won in the final quarter for successfully converting 4 turnovers, with the whole team getting behind the ball. If the team continue like this, their coach will be broke!\n\nAn excellent win recorded again against Canford 5th VII.\n\nAfter a bit of a slow start for the 1s, the girls managed to pull off a 34-24 win against Canford. It took a couple of minutes for the girls to get into the game but with some really great defence they were able to gain a narrow lead each quarter. There was some nice attacking work around the circle between the mid court and the shooters throughout the game but the girls had a strong last quarter thanks to some good interceptions from Jaz (W), Emily (A) and Jess (W) and the girls came away with the win. Jess (W) was our player of the match.\n\nA really exciting game for the 2s, 27-14 win against Canford. Started off the first quarter with a 6 goal lead. Defence bought the ball down the court nicely and forcing the errors on the opposition. Multiple turnovers from the centre court throughout the game, with special mention to Candi (Ap) earning player of the match. An entertaining game from the shooters’ perspective considering they were playing out of position. Another special mention to Jess (A) for some excellent shooting.\n\n3rd team: After a first quarter that saw both sides very evenly matched as they settled into their play, Wellington took the lead in the second and third quarters. Consistently strong in the defence of their positions, they kept up the pressure against a resurgent Canford for their first win of the season, 24-20. Flo (C) won player of the match.\n\nReal Tennis\n\nLRTA – Under 19s National Singles and Doubles: In the doubles event Lydia (C) and her partner won an action packed final. Georgia (T) had a fantastic run in the singles and narrowly missed out on a spot in the final.\n\nRunning Club\n\nThe running team had great success at the Berkshire Schools Cross Country Championships at Newbury Showground last Saturday. The whole team showed great stoicism in very cold conditions. Congratulations to Daniel (R) for achieving 1st place in the U15 Boys, with Eva (W) placing 5th in the U15 Girls, Nell (Hg) placing 9th in the U17 Girls and Phoebe (C) placing 12th in the U19 Girls. The U19 Boys achieved 2nd place in the Team.\n\nSquash\n\nLast week’s Squash fixture against Charterhouse saw the team win four girls’ matches showing great strength across the team, with four new U14 pupils playing who all had good competitive matches. The boys’ team had some players missing with injuries, but this gave us opportunities and despite some tough games it was a competitive fixture and good experience for all involved.\n\nTeam of the Week\n\nThe U15A netballers who put in a gritty performance in a tight match. Resilient defence and thoughtful feeding from centre court saw them to a 25-20 win.\n\nBest Senior Season Yet – with Richard Shorter\n\nAs we prepare for the new year, we’re excited about helping your children have their best season yet. We believe parents are key and vital partners, in ensuring that children gain the most from what we offer as a school.\n\nTo support you, we have arranged for all our parents to have free access to some extremely useful webinars specifically designed for parents.\n\nPlease may we ask you to join us for four practical, insightful and impactful sessions which will support you in supporting your child?\n\nSign up here.\n\nSession Dates\n\nJanuary 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nFebruary 8th, 8-9 pm\n\nMarch 14th, 8-9 pm\n\nApril 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nBasketball\n\nOn Saturday, Wellington hosted the traditional season opening tournament for U18 boys. Slow starts in our first two fixtures, to eventual winner Charterhouse and a strong Stowe, meant we were unable to progress from the group stage. In our third and final group match, the boys restored some pride with a solid 23-15 win against the Royal Hospital School. Daniel (M) and Oscar (Bd) put in especially determined performances in all three games, with Hugo (M) from the Fifth Form making his debut for the U18 boys.\n\nFootball\n\nA great week for WCFC: nine wins and one loss, with 46 goals scored and 18 conceded across all games. Well done to all those who represented the College and put in such convincing performances.\n\nHockey\n\nSome tough games for the boys’ hockey teams against Radley, but a really well earnt and hard fought 3-3 draw for the boys’ 1st team.\n\nNetball\n\nLast Saturday the U14 A-D, U15 A-D, U16C and 1st-4th teams played against St John’s, Leatherhead.\n\nThe 1st VII had a great first run out of 2024 against St John’s, coming away with a comfortable win. The game itself allowed for the girls to achieve plenty of scoring opportunities which Amelie (W) and Char (A) did so with abundance. Saffy (Hg) deserves special mention for her work rate at WA, often double marked, easily getting free and delivering the ball with precision and skill to the shooters.\n\nA strong effort in icy conditions from the 2nd team to start their season. Due to a having a larger squad, the girls were able to trial different combinations and enjoy playing with new faces. The girls unfortunately lost the game; however, they showed small improvements throughout. Well done to all.\n\nWhilst Wellington 3rds found their feet on a chilly outdoor court, St John’s streaked ahead. However, Wellington dug in to find their netball joy. Throughout the second half they worked hard together to match St John’s goal for goal, ending the game with real momentum. Final score for the 3rds was a loss of 21-30.\n\nDespite some very icy conditions the 4ths made an encouraging start to the season against a very strong St John’s team. Stand out performances from Ruby (Hn) and player of the match, Mary (O), switching from defence to attack in the second and fourth quarters respectively pulled the game back from what initially looked like being a huge score to a more respectable 14-27. Special mention to Marwa (Hg) playing her first game for Wellington.\n\nThe U16Cs took on St John’s 5th VII. After a very quick warm up, it took the girls a little while to find their feet, with the oppo being first to most 50/50 balls. The shooters had an excellent quarter, converting every CP, and also three of the four turnovers. Having got our confidence and not to be intimidated by some players two years older, we settled into the game with some wonderful passages of play. We were now first to every loose ball, and the girls moved ball to goal effortlessly. PoM was Tessa (Hn), but all eight girls contributed superbly, and the shooters barely missed a goal, showing great patience and discipline to get into goal scoring opportunities. A cracking start to the season!\n\nThe U15As faced a tough opponent this week; they were well-drilled and careful in possession which meant that Wellington had a slow start. Improvements, however, were made in each quarter as our midcourt began to break down their set pieces and our shooters grew more confident at the net. Despite the high scoreline, the defending end kept the game competitive. A stand-out performance from Nina (T) whose dogged defending won her player of the match.\n\nThe U15Bs were excellent! They won 30-11. The opposition chose Maya (A) as PoM and that was justly deserved. Mimi (O) and Emily (Ap) were also outstanding. They all played well though, especially given the fact we lost our subs to injury midway through the second quarter, so they had no breaks!\n\nThe U15Cs had a strong start, with Wellington leading at the end of the first and second quarter. 10-all at the end of the third quarter. Wellington girls played very well in the first half and worked well together throughout the match. However, St John’s found their flow late in the game. Fantastic captaincy from Iris (O) who was a great C/WA pair with Alice (Ap); some great goal scoring by Honor (A) and Nishka (T). Final score 12-16.\n\nThe U15Ds won 29-24 with Amelia (C) as player of the match!\n\nThe U14As had a great win against St John’s 43-23. There were some great passages of play throughout the match and Chloe (Hn) and Ophelia (Ap) fitted in seamlessly as they made their netball debuts for Wellington.\n\nThe U14Cs had a good start to the season on a chilly afternoon at home, with the squad playing well and showing keenness, promising skills and good work rate. Thanks to Jemima (Hn) (captain) for good leadership in warm up, leading by example on court and team talks, plus good input from the rest of the team and some useful data analysis by subs. Jemima (Hn) and Clara-Rose (C) were joint players of the match.\n\nThe U14Ds won 19 -5. Before playing we managed to try a few things out like how to pass into the circle clear to make space and around the circle edge. The girls were very good and quickly put this into their game. They also implemented what was asked of them each quarter. Grace (Hn) was given PoM by St John’s.\n\nA special mention this week goes to Freya (T) for being selected into the Player Development Pathway for U15 Surrey Storm. Freya has shown amazing commitment to her netball so far this season, all her hard work is paying off!\n\nHuge congratulations to both Scarlett (W) and Saskia (Ap) for their selection into the Surrey Storm U21 and U19 squads this week.\n\nPolo\n\nLeo (Pn) has been chosen as Reserve for the England team for their International match on 20th January.\n\nRunning Club\n\nAt the Knowle Run, the Senior Girls’ team put in a good show finishing 9th team overall with individual results as follows:\n\n27th Nell (Hg)\n\n33rd Alice (A)\n\n44th Phoebe (C)\n\n51st Caitlin (Ap)\n\n57th Amelie (O)\n\nWith only four runners in Senior Boys, we did not have the minimum of six to make up a team. Individual results are as follows:\n\n128 Levi (T)\n\n133 Barney (S)\n\n134 Thomas (T)\n\n135 Kamil (Bd)\n\nSkiing\n\nWell done to Clemmie (O) who won the senior girls’ Cresta race on 2nd January, beating the second placed girl by just over 3.5 seconds over two courses in the race.\n\nSquash\n\nWell done the Squash team at the Roehampton meet last Sunday. Results saw a group stage win against Dulwich, but two losses against Winchester and UCS, meaning they missed out on a semi spot by 2 points. Some excellent performances during the day, which saw an eventual 6th place finish.\n\nTeam of the Week\n\nThe Football U16B boys: having been 3-1 down at half time, the boys showed brilliant commitment as a group to come back and win 4-3.\n\nBest Senior Season Yet – with Richard Shorter\n\nAs we prepare for the new year, we’re excited about helping your children have their best season yet. We believe parents are key and vital partners in ensuring that children gain the most from what we offer as a school.\n\nTo support you, we have arranged for all our parents to have free access to some extremely useful webinars specifically designed for parents.\n\nPlease may we ask you to join us for four practical, insightful and impactful sessions which will support you in supporting your child?\n\nSign up here.\n\nSession Dates\n\nJanuary 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nFebruary 8th, 8-9 pm\n\nMarch 14th, 8-9 pm\n\nApril 11th, 8-9 pm\n\nBadminton\n\nBadminton finished last term with success for the girls’ badminton team, with lots of fantastic matches from the 3rd, 4th and 5th form girls. Special mention to Katya (W) and Marisa (T) who narrowly lost a brilliant game 19-21. The girls’ team came 2nd in the regional finals.\n\nRackets\n\nFrom the National School Rackets at Queen’s: Huge congratulations must go to Seb (R) who won the Renny Cup. After a performance a year ago that left him unhappy, Seb has worked very hard on his skills and match play. He won 14 games in a row over the last week of term to win this prestigious cup. Lydia (C) and Emilia (C) led the senior girls’ final 2-1, before the top seeds, Marlborough College, found their best level, to win 3-2. The junior pair of Zaara (W) and Georgia (T) did very well to win a semi-final, and even had championship point against favourites, Cheltenham College, in the final. Sadly, they didn’t convert but the girls should be very proud of their performances, especially as they all have another year in the same competitions.\n\nSkiing\n\nOver the Christmas break the ski team made their way to Jasper, Canada for a competitive ten days of ski racing at the Canada Cup. This year there were two competitions; the Canada Cup and the Challenge Cup. Congratulations to Morgan (Bn), Charlotte (A), Jake (T), and Victor (M) for getting into the Canada Cup races, which required qualifying times that placed them in the top 60 pupils of all nine participating schools. Huge well done to Morgan for winning the Canada Cup giant slalom for his age group, against not only the talented other schools, but GB team skiers and reserves, truly a commendable achievement. Additional commendations must go to Caitlin (Hg), for winning both her respective races in the Challenge Cup and Will (Bd) for coming 2nd in slalom. Special mentions go to Victor for achieving an outstanding 5th place overall in the U16s, the largest age group in the Cup, to Jake for placing 6th in the GS Open against 10 GB skiers, and to Charlotte for coming 8th in the Open category in both her races. The Wellington A dual slalom team, consisting Caitlin, Charlotte, Jake, Morgan and Victor, made it to the semi-finals of the Canada Cup competition, just missing the finals.\n\nTeam of the Week\n\nThe Shooting team. Over the course of last term, the shooting team has had well over 30 individuals take part in a multitude of matches, competitions, and training. They have fired over 27,000 rounds in the span of 13 weeks at the school range, with another 4,000 shot at competitions on outdoor ranges.\n\nWe’ve had numerous successes: an undefeated shoulder-to-shoulder season at both home and away matches, coming 3rd and 2nd in the two national competitions (missing out on 1st place by a small margin in both cases), and numerous successes at an individual level as well – we’ve had many people reach new personal bests and setting themselves with exceptional averages, and it would be improper to not celebrate those who shot 100 out of 100 on 10 bull targets, a very difficult feat! We’ve had eight 100s this term alone: Alex (R), Natty (W), Tuppy (A), Julius (T), Ilyas (S) and Liam (R).\n\nPrior to breaking up for the Christmas holidays, we had news of Alex (R), Ricky (M) and Sayan (M) being invited to attend Maple Taste at Bisley, where they will be trying out for a place on the team UKCRT.\n\nWe also learnt that Tuppy (A) was selected to represent the Athelings in Canada 2024, with Adrian (L) being a team reserve – still very much a part of the squad and team, training alongside.\n\nWith the holidays having passed, we now look ahead to the Easter holidays and beyond; the warmer weather coming will lead to us going to outdoor shooting and switching from Smallbore, to Fullbore. But, before that, let’s hope for a good Lent Term season with more matches being postal than shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nBest Senior Season Yet – with Richard Shorter\n\nAs we prepare for the new year, we’re excited about helping your children have their best season yet. We believe parents are key and vital partners in ensuring that children gain the most from what we offer as a school.\n\nTo support you, we have arranged for all our parents to have free access to some extremely useful webinars specifically designed for parents.\n\nPlease may we ask you to join us for four practical, insightful and impactful sessions which will support you in supporting your child?\n\nSign up here.\n\nSession Dates\n\nJanuary 11th, 8-9pm\n\nFebruary 8th, 8-9pm\n\nMarch 14th, Parent Session 8-9pm\n\nApril 11th, 8-9pm\n\nBadminton\n\nThis week’s badminton fixtures featured two thrilling mixed doubles encounters, highlighting Wellington’s prowess on the court. On Thursday, Wellington secured a resounding victory against Bradfield with a scoreline of 13-3, thanks in no small part to the standout performances of Oli (T) and Shreya (W), who clinched vital wins. Saturday saw Wellington continue their winning streak, dominating Epsom with a final score of 20-5. Special mention goes to Sasha (Bd) and Suneri (W) for their exceptional contributions to the team’s success.\n\nFootball\n\nAnother great week for the footballers. Two big wins for our junior footballers: 6-1 win for the U15s and a 5-3 win for the U14s (with a hattrick from Callum (Bl)), having been 3-3 with minutes to play, a great late victory.\n\nGymnastics\n\nMassive congratulations to Amelia (W) who is the Women’s FaceOff Champion 2023. At 16, she was the youngest in the competition, facing competitors 10 years her senior with lots more experience. In a sell-out arena with a capacity of 7,500 she held her nerve. The competition was made up of three rounds: tumbling xXx, the lottery on trampette and double trouble on the double mini trampoline. After taking the lead with an incredible triple back somersault, believed to be a female world first, she maintained her lead for the whole competition. Finishing with an awesome full twisting triple back on double trouble.\n\nHockey\n\nThe under 18 girls’ indoor hockey team finished an excellent 5th at Nationals last week, well done to all involved. The U15A team progressed to the ISHC National Quarter Finals, having played Ipswich School, where they went 2-0 down, 3-1 down, back to 3-3 and claimed the win on sudden death strokes.\n\nNetball\n\nIt was a week of full training for all our netball teams last week with a Saturday training of festive fun with Christmas themed outfits and treats!\n\nReal Tennis\n\nA great weekend for Wellington College at the National Handicap Singles competition sponsored by The Dedanists’ Foundation. Last Saturday saw 12 players from the 60+ section battle it out for the title with representation from Hatfield, Prested Hall, Oratory, Bridport, Moreton Morrell, Cambridge, Queen’s and RTC. Sam (R) was super subbed in the last minute and won through to the final with a great win over Ryan (R). The bottom half of the draw saw a Cambridge player win a place in the final over a competitor from Moreton Morrell in a very close match that could have gone either way. The final was well contested between Sam’s speed and retrieving skills and the Cambridge players classic cut shot game… Sam managed to hold the service end on the big points and won the final 6-4.\n\nSuper Sunday was equally as exciting with representation from Holyport, Bristol, RTC, Oratory, Seacourt, Prested, Queen’s and Prested Hall. Rueben (R) won a place in the final with a great win over a WRTC member to set up a show down with someone from the Oratory who had beaten a competitor from Bristol in a tough semi-final. Another hard fought final, which saw opportunities for both players to take the title, but it was Rueben’s retrieving skills and fast paced forces that made the difference and Rueben won the title 6-4.\n\nIn the LRTA Under 21 National Handicap, Lydia (C) proved to be on a hot run of form with a string of victories to win the Under 21s at Radley. Lydia was giving handicap in all of her matches and showed great experience and maturity in her match play. In the final, Lydia took on an opponent from RTC in a great display of tennis and sealed the win 8-6 to win the title.\n\nRugby\n\nLast week saw the Interhouse Rugby competitions contested, with the Seniors being won by the Benson, the Inters by the Hill and Juniors by the Beresford.\n\nShooting\n\nSaturday’s national competition for the shooting team was a roaring success. As a team, they came 2nd in the Junior and Senior pairs, 1st in the Fours, and 2nd in the Eight, having just been beaten by Gresham’s for 1st place in the Eight by 5 points; this equates to 5/32 of a point per person per shoot – a very tight margin!\n\nThere were other successes at an individual level too, with Natty (W) being the top U14 year old shot, Tuppy (A) being the top 16 year old, and having the following places in the top 30 out of 145 students: Julius (T) (26th), Fabian (M) (15th), Alex (Bd) (6th), Natty (W) (2nd) Tuppy (A) (1st).\n\nA very successful national’s match.\n\nSquash\n\nAt the Surrey Sports Park Tournament, the following results were recorded last weekend and despite the scorelines, it was a fantastic effort from everyone involved, in some really high quality squash.\n\nvs Winchester lost 3-2\n\nvs Surrey Sports Park Junior Team lost 3-2\n\nvs Sevenoaks lost 5-0\n\nTeam of the Week\n\nThe badminton mixed team for winning both their mixed matches last week against Epsom and Bradfield.\n\nTeam of the Term\n\nThe U14C girls’ hockey team receive the award of Team of the Term, having completed 9 wins from 9, but even more than that, last Saturday against Marlborough they went 2-0 up, then 3-2 down with about 7 minutes to go; however, all came good as they won 4-3, getting the winner with 90 seconds to go. A remarkable season.\n\nHockey\n\nLast weekend saw some excellent fixtures for the Hockey Club as a whole against Bradfield. With 8 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses, but most importantly across the board there were some very competitive fixtures for all involved.\n\nWell done to the girls’ 1st XI who last week secured their third Tier 1 league win against Cranleigh, with a 2-1 away win.\n\nNetball\n\nIt was an action packed week of netball starting with the 1st team’s cup game against King’s Worcester on Wednesday. The first quarter was heavily contested with lots of turnovers on both sides keeping the score low and finishing 11 all. The girls had a storming second quarter taking the lead by 8 goals. In defence, Emily (A) and Macy (C) really started working together well, leading to lots of GK turnover on the outside of the circle. Charlotte (Ap) and Saskia (Ap) barely missed a shot, with some great long range feeds coming in from Saffy (Hg). The third quarter really finished the game as the girls finished out the quarter 51-29. Keira (C) stepped into the 1st team for the first time and delivered an amazing performance. She completely shut the WA out of the game and forced a lot of defensive turnover. Charlotte (Ap) came off in the third quarter which meant a change to a moving circle with Amelie (W) and Saskia (Ap). The movement in attack was the best played to date and, with shooting so accurate, the girls really put out an amazing performance. At the end of the third quarter, Lucy came on in GK and worked well to shut down the GS. The game ended with a big win, 69-39. An amazing team performance where everyone took to court. Thank you and well done to Lucy (W) and Keira (C) for joining the squad for this game. A special mention also goes to Annabel (C) for playing so well out of position at WD and for Keira’s (C) first match with the seniors. Well done to Saffy (Hg) for getting opposition player of the match.\n\nThe U18 2nd team, U16A, U15A and U14A all had a match against Maiden Erlegh on Thursday. The 2nd team had a really well contested match and after losing the first quarter the girls came back to win the match 21-28. The opposition player of the match went to Jess (A). The U16s won their game 34-16. The U14As won 36-3. We played versatility for half the game and it was an opportunity for players to try different positions – Lily (C) was a revelation at GA and Ivy (A) was let out of the defen"
