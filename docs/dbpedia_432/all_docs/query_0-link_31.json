        "text": "This morning we have a post from Tom Suddes, a golfing friend of my husband. During Tom’s naval career he was known as “Snaps” as he was the Queen’s official photographer when on board the Royal Yacht Brittania.\n\nTom is a great dinner party guest as he has some wonderful tales to keep us all entertained. The first time I met him and was seated next to him he was surprised when rather than asking him about the Queen and the Royal family I asked him about his “housewife”.\n\nThis is what he told me in his own words together with another story that touched me.\n\n“I joined the Navy to see the world, what did we do? We learned to sew!”\n\nI joined the Royal Navy in 1964 when I was 15 years and 1 month old, wow what an adventure!\n\nI went first to HMS GANGES, a boys training establishment of 2000 boys on the River Stour near Harwich. For the next 12 months our time was divided between learning a trade, studying Maths, English, Mechanics and Naval History, but the best bits were playing sport, sailing and pulling (a naval term for rowing). This was great fun, although the training was very strict with little opportunity not to achieve.\n\nOn day two of this great adventure, we were introduced to washing our clothes by hand and began our instruction in sewing, yes sewing! Not what we expected. We were issued with our kit and every item was marked in black or white ink to ensure we didn’t ‘lose’ anything. Amongst the items issued, perhaps most unusual was the ‘housewife’, a small blue rolled-up piece of cotton with pockets containing all our sewing kit, complete with needles, thread and thimble.\n\nSo, we joined the Royal Navy and our first task was to chain stitch over our names on the housewife, using red embroidery cotton. At first this tedious task seemed silly and insignificant. We were expecting to handle fire arms, learn to march and throw ourselves into REAL military activities. But sewing?\n\nThis delicate work had to pass inspection, with very few first attempts meeting the high standard demanded by the instructor, a World War II veteran Chief Petty Officer who knew every trick in the book (and a few more besides!). As any seamstress will know, the ‘needlework’ demanded patience and great attention to fine detail. On hindsight, it is obvious that it was a cunning test to see who could use their hands, had the patience to tackle something new and different, to achieve the unthinkable – perfectly crafted chain stitch! You might think some would lose interest or give up but everyone was keen to succeed and the pressure was on; with needle in hand we persevered and eventually passed the test.\n\nSome were hampered from the start, I remember one messmate by the name of Van Der Westhuizen. He was one of the smallest in the class and yet his name tallies were so long they were in two rows! At the same time what would ‘J Day’ do once he completed the task in record time? Would he volunteer to help his fellow mess mate? (Team spirit, an essential element to naval ethos and military life was never far away).\n\n52 years later I still have my precious housewife with a number of rusty needles and little cotton, but no buttons left, The housewife is intact and I still have the thimble; the red chain stitching is still there too!!\n\n“My first night away from home”\n\nPicture the scene, some 40 young, 15 year old boys away from home, most for the first time, lying in single beds arranged in perfect line down both sides of the dormitory style mess deck. The floor is highly polished parquet tiles, there is a silver polished dustbin (never used) in the centre of the room, and everything is stowed away ship shape and ‘Bristol fashion’.\n\nWe had already received instructions on how to make our beds. White cotton sheets were to be fitted with pristine hospital corners, topped with squared off pillow cases, ‘itchy’ wool blankets that probably came off the Mary Rose, and all covered with an attractive blue and white counterpane sporting a large naval anchor embroidered in the centre (standard RN issue).\n\nOur instructor, now in the twilight of his career, immaculately dressed in full naval uniform and cap is slowly pacing around the mess deck speaking in a loud, strong voice, complete with cockney accent. He is listing clear, concise instruction for tomorrow morning and what he demands of us.\n\nWe are lying on our backs, sheets pulled up to our chins, hands and arms by our sides, like sardines in a tin we are lying almost ‘to attention’ in bed. We hang on the instructors every word, keen to miss nothing, there is a great deal of anticipation in the air, we have just joined the Royal Navy.\n\n“…and tomorrow morning you will awake at 0600 to ‘Call the Hands’ where you will go to the wash room to shave, shower and then dress in the Number 8 uniform you have just been issued with this evening. Having dressed, you will muster outside the mess deck on the parade ground ready for my inspection at 0630 before going to breakfast…..” boomed the Chief Petty officer with his imperious tone. But as he continued his dialogue, pacing around the room something caught his beady eye and his stopped in his stride……\n\n”you Boy, what’s your name lad?” Said the instructor in a loud voice.\n\n“Shaw, Sir” replied the startled young man, lying in bed.\n\n“Shaw, eh?, well Shaw where’s your sheets and pillow case?”\n\nShaw looked shocked and replied in a weak, timid voice “Sheets Sir?”\n\n“Yes, my son, your sheets and pillowcase, don’t you use sheets and pillowcases at home Shaw?” continued the Instructor with his intimidating voice and Cockney accent.\n\n“No Sir” replied Shaw “we don’t have any at home”. At this point I have to highlight that some boys who joined the RN in the mid 1960’s were often from poor homes, orphanages and had joined the Service hoping to find ‘a family.’\n\nEveryone in the mess deck is staring at Shaw and the instructor, thinking he must be in deep trouble, Day 1 and already not following instructions. I am certain the Instructor is bound to give him a clip ‘round the ear, take him outside or have some other form of ‘private conversation’.\n\nI lie in great anticipation, eyes popping out like chapel hat pegs, waiting for the first ‘lesson’ in military training.\n\n“Right Shaw, get out of bed” replied the instructor, but this time his voice was soft, friendly, encouraging and sympathetic.\n\nWe all anticipated the worst for Shaw. HMS GANGES had a reputation for being a very disciplined training establishment with the highest standards of behaviour and conduct.\n\nBut no; what followed was a brilliant lesson in HR which I remember to this day and which I took with me, and used, throughout my 46 years service.\n\n“Right son” continued the Instructor, in a friendly, almost hushed and fatherly tone, “this is what we do every night when we make our beds, first you take a white sheet and put it on the bottom, like this, then on top you put another sheet. After one week, we take the bottom sheet off and wash it by hand. Don’t you worry about that, I’ll show you how to do that later. Then you put the top sheet on the bottom and the third spare sheet you have, that goes on the top, nice and clean like. OK?”\n\n“Yes Sir” replied Shaw nervously.\n\n“Then we put the pillow in this pillow case, makes it nice and soft on your face.” The Instructor continued to make the bed adding the itchy wool blankets and counterpane, tucking in the corners and edges, just so.\n\nShaw stands, dressed in his newly issued naval pyjamas, motionless but following the fatherly instructions.\n\n“Now then my son, you just slip into your bed and see what it feels like”.\n\nShaw obeys and immediately a smile comes to his thin, pale face.\n\n“Now how does that feel like? Nice and soft, better than those rough blankets, eh?” Invited the instructor.\n\n“Yes Sir”\n\n“Well now Shaw, every time you make your bed, you do it just as I showed you, and you and I will get along just fine, do you understand son?”\n\n“Yes Sir”\n\nAnd in a flash it was back to business.\n\n“Right boys he resounded! Now, about tomorrow morning, when you muster on the parade ground…….” and off he went, back into auto, back into his strong, commanding voice, walking around the mess deck continuing his instructions one after the other.\n\nWe couldn’t believe our ears. Not at all what we expected to happen. Here I saw at first hand this experienced, long serving war veteran looking for the first opportunity to give a struggling beginner a helping hand. Clear instructions, followed by a simple demonstration and guidance for the future, superb.\n\nI don’t know what happened to Shaw, whether he stayed in the Service or left for pastures greener. But, on reflection those first months of training were littered with other examples of good leadership, training and care. How lucky I was. Here is a picture of a typical messdeck at HMS GANGES in 1964.\n\nVery few of us become proficient at a craft by instinct. If we wish to learn we need to find out as much as we can about the materials we need; the tools to use and the correct way to use them. Needlework is not just a question of a needle and some thread, but of which needle and what kind of thread, and how to use them once chosen. There are a multitude of stitches and techniques to discover and master.\n\nI am a self taught needleworker and through Yvette’s earlier books I have become competent in Hardanger, whitework and drawn thread work. I have come to appreciate the simple elegance of white on white. When there is no colour to distract, the pattern and texture formed by the stitching really comes to the fore.\n\nI have been eagerly awaiting delivery of Yvette Stanton’s new book “Early Style Hardanger” since its publication was announced, and I have not been disappointed. This is a must have book for a needleworker’s library.\n\nNormally I dip into books but I have been totally enthralled from the 1st to the 160th page, all of which are packed with over 1500 colour photos and diagrams.\n\nThere is so much to enjoy including a fascinating section on the history of hardanger. I found the chapter comparing the early style Hardanger and the modern day version particularly interesting. Early-style Hardanger is quite distinct from contemporary Hardanger. This historical style of embroidery has traditionally been used on the women’s clothing in the Hardangerfjord region, and was designed to emulate needle-made lace of the 1600s and 1700s.\n\nThe Projects chapter has 10 gorgeous projects that tempt. The small projects make wonderful learning pieces culminating in a traditional apron. The projects have well written finishing instructions and the pattern sheets come in a separate pack at the back on the book.\n\nThe section on “Stitches and Techniques” opens with “where to start” which explains how to read a chart, the stitching order and how to find the starting point, all important basics that can often be overlooked.\n\nYvette guides the reader through this comprehensive section with right and left handed step by step stitch and technique instructions that are extremely clear and easy to follow supplemented by well drawn out illustrations.\n\nEarly Style Hardanger is now one of my “go-to” stitch reference books and can be found on my “special shelf” within arm’s reach of my stitching station.\n\nThe book is now available through needlework stores, and direct from YVETTE.\n\nYvette Stanton is the publisher and designer behind Vetty Creations. Yvette is a highly respected tutor accredited by the Embroiderers Guild of NSW, and teaches embroidery classes, specialising in whitework at shops and guild groups around Australia.\n\nIf you have enjoyed today’s blog post you might like to sign up for our newsletter and receive future posts via email.\n\nSubscribing is easy just fill in your email address in the box at the top right hand side of this page.

So many of these girls died young, often in childbirth, but there are a few that through clues left in their sampler tell a fascinating story and take you on a journey through a family’s history.\n\nWhen we first started to research Elizabeth Furniss we found that we did not have enough information to say with certainty that we had the “right” girl. There are several girls with varying spellings of her name in the period we were looking at.\n\nThrough an exchange of information this weekend on a Facebook group and a posting of a photograph of Ann Wright’s sampler we were able to find the right “Elizabeth”.\n\nAs you can see on Ann’s sampler the apple tree, the figures of Adam and Eve and the pastoral scene are almost identical to Elizabeth’s.\n\nAnn’s sampler tells us that she was born in 1836 and that she stitched her sampler at Darnall School. The school was in the Township of Attercliffe cum Darnall in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England.\n\nThe 1841 census shows an “Ann Wright” of the right age (-/+ 1 year) living in Lead Mill Row Sheffield, just over a mile away from Darnall School. Focusing on this area I found an “Elizabeth Furniss” of the correct age living less than 1 mile away in 3 Shude Hill.\n\nI was confident that we had found our stitcher but there were further leads to follow through. A few weeks ago I stumbled across another sampler, stitched by Eliza Powell, that shared many of the same motifs with Elizabeth’s sampler.\n\nEliza’s sampler tells us that she was born in 1813 (-/+ 1 year). This was a very popular name in the period but now being able to focus on Sheffield an “Eliza” of the right age was found on the 1841 census.\n\nEliza lived in Ellens Yard, off Arundel Street which is less that 1 mile from Elizabeth in Shude Hill and even closer to Ann in Lead Mill Row.\n\nThe Grammar School that appeared in her sampler can be found close by. It had only just been built, maybe that is why she included it in her sampler. The school was for boys.\n\nThere is another similar sampler to be considered in our research, Sarah Ann Downend.\n\nThe sampler has no clues to age or area but searching through Sheffield birth records a girl of this name was christened in 1815 in the Cathedral which is a stone’s throw from Shude Hill\n\n‘\n\nThere was one further sampler to investigate. Esther Charleton has two houses and Adam & Eve figures that are very similar to those in Elizabeth’s sampler. There is also a pastoral scene where one of the sheep appears to be identical.\n\nEsther’s sampler told us her age and a search quickly showed that she was also christened in the Cathedral.\n\nWe now had five girls who lived within 1 square mile of each other. Based on this I think it reasonable to say that the girls shared the same needlework teacher and all probably attended Darnall School (assuming that the teacher taught in the same school between 1816 and 1844). Elizabeth, Eliza and Ann were not christened in the Cathedral so I do not believe that they attended the same Sunday School.\n\nKey: A – Darnall School, B – Shude Hill (Elizabeth Furniss), C – Lead Mill Row (Ann Wright), D – The Cathedral (Esther Charleton & Sarah Ann Downend), E – Arundel Street(Eliza Powell).\n\nThrough a trade directory I have managed to find several school mistresses who taught in the area and I plan to research the names.\n\nIf you know of any further samplers that share characteristics with Elizabeth Furniss or have any knowledge about Darnall School, please let us know.\n\nHere are some samplers found in Sheffield Museum’s collection. Images copyright Sheffield Museum\n\nNote the same mis-spelling of “canvass“\n\nSince publishing this post I have received photographs from readers of other Sheffield samplers and have started a PINTEREST board. If you know of any other samplers that have similar motifs please will you pass them onto us so that we may add them to our database.\n\nTRIVIA\n\nElizabeth lived in the block of houses to the left.\n\nElizabeth’s home would have looked out onto Soho Mills and Pond Works.\n\nLead Mill and the River Sheaf.\n\nWas “The Towers” the inspiration for Elizabeth, Sarah and Esther’s house, note the trees.\n\nThe Cathedral in Sheffield.\n\nIf you have enjoyed today’s blog post you might like to sign up for our newsletter and receive future posts via email.\n\nSubscribing is easy just fill in your email address in the box at the top right hand side of this page.

The guild also cares for the altar cloths at the Cathedral.\n\nAltar cloths are used by many religious groups as a sign of respect towards the holiness of the altar, as in the Catholic Church.\n\nCloths can also be used to protect the altar surface or to beautify the altar.\n\nThe use of altar-cloths goes back to the early centuries of the Roman Catholic Church. By the fourth century, during the celebration of Holy Communion, the altar was covered with a white linen cloth. Symbolically, the cloths represent the purity and the devotion of God’s Faithful, and the linens in which the body of Christ was wrapped when he was laid in the tomb.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church the custom of using three altar-cloths began in the ninth century. The reason being that if the Precious Blood should by accident be spilt it might be absorbed by the altar-cloths before it reached the altar-stone. There are four symbolic colors: red, white, violet and green, while black is sometimes used for funerals.\n\nRed symbolizes the color of fire to represent the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost and times when the work of the Holy Spirit is emphasized. During Holy Week it represents the blood of Christ. Red is also used for ordinations, church anniversaries and civil observances such as Memorial Day and Thanksgiving.\n\nAt Truro Cathedral there is a magnificent red altar cloth “The Angels and the Censer” which I was able to study in close detail on my visit.\n\nI am trying to find out more about the altar cloth, when it was made and who did the originally embroidery. I will be visiting the Courtney Library shortly to carry out some further research. I do, however, know that the altar cloth was repaired in more recent years by Sheila Landi of The Landi Company.\n\nIf you are interested in textile conservation Landi’s book “The Textile Conservator’s Manual” is worth adding to your library.\n\nTruro Cathedral has some altar cloths on permanent display. (The photographs have been taken through glass)\n\nBesides the grandeur of the Gothic architecture and the magnificence of the stained glass windows there is much to see at the Cathedral. Tucked away in a small corner of the Cathedral next to the books of remembrance is a small sampler – on every visit I take time to read it and say a prayer.\n\nTRIVIA\n\nFor over nine hundred years, Cornwall was part of the Diocese of Exeter. The sheer size of that Diocese meant that the Bishop of Exeter was a rare visitor west of the Tamar, and there was a growing pressure from the leading Cornish Anglicans during the nineteenth century to create a separate diocese for Cornwall.\n\nIn 1877, after 30 years of intense lobbying, the Cornish Diocese was re-established at Truro. The Diocese of Truro covers the whole of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly plus two parishes in Devon!\n\nThe site chosen in Truro for the Cathedral was where the Parish Church of St Mary’s stood. Since at least 1259, and probably before, there has been a Parish Church of St Mary located on this site. When Truro was chosen it was assumed that the Parish Church would be completely demolished to make way for the Cathedral. However, the architect John Loughborough Pearson, argued and eventually gained permission to keep at least part of the old Parish Church. He cleverly incorporated the South Aisle of the church into his design for the new Cathedral.\n\nTruro Cathedral was the first cathedral to be built on a new site since Salisbury was started in 1220.\n\nEdward White Benson was the first Bishop of Truro (1877 – 1883). He was previously Headmaster of Wellington College and then Chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral. It was his vision and energy that really established the new Diocese of Truro and the building of this wonderful Cathedral. From 1883 until his death in 1896 he was Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1880 Bishop Benson created the ‘Service of Nine Lessons and Carols’ which for over 120 years has formed part of the Cathedral’s traditional worship on Christmas Eve.\n\nIf you have enjoyed today’s blog post you might like to sign up for our newsletter and receive future posts via email.\n\nSubscribing is easy just fill in your email address in the box at the top right hand side of this page. Don’t forget to add us to your contact list so the newsletters go into your inbox rather than spam.\n\nWe will never share your details.\n\nOn a recent visit to Truro Cathedral in Cornwall, England I found a small group of dedicated needleworkers busy sewing new vestments. The Cathedral Sewing Guild meets weekly to maintain and repair the robes, embroideries and hassocks.\n\nOver the years the Guild has made vestments, collection bags, cushions, kneelers, gowns for St Mary’s Singers, and carried out numerous adjustments to the choristers cassocks.\n\nThey work in the Cathedral as besides the good light and space available it enables visitors to witness their work and ask questions.\n\nChurch embroidery opens up a whole new field of needlework to be explored. As the the V&A’s autumn exhibition Opus Anglicanum: Masterpieces of English Medieval Embroidery, draws nearer now is a good time to find out more.\n\nThe Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary is an Anglican cathedral located in the city of Truro, Cornwall, England. The “uniform” used in the Cathedral is known as a Set. (Images used are taken from different periods, denominations and countries). CHASUBLE: This is the principal vestment, worn by the President (the officiating priest). It was originally circular with a hole for the head but is now open at the side like a tabard.\n\nDALMATIC: A short robe with large, full sleeves and often highly ornamented, which is worn by the Deacon (this originated in Dalamtia, hence the name.\n\nTUNICLE: Shorter than the Dalmatic and less richly ornamented; it is worn by the Gospel Clerk (who carries the Gospels) and the Crucifer (who carries the Processional Cross)\n\nSTOLE: A band worn like a scarf; it is a symbol of priesthood and represents the yoke of Christ.\n\nBURSE: A flat square of stiffened silk which holds the Corporal, (the cloth on which are placed the communion vessels)\n\nVEIL: A square of silk, which covers the chalice on the altar.\n\nLiturgical colours are specific colours used for vestments and hangings within the context of Christian liturgy. The symbolism of violet, white, green, red, gold, black, rose and other colours may serve to underline moods appropriate to a season of the liturgical year or may highlight a special occasion.\n\nOn my visit to the Cathedral I was fortunate to be taken down into the Crypt and allowed to see the vestments.\n\nTRIVIA\n\nThere are some regional exceptions to the Liturgical colours.\n\nBlue, a colour associated with the Virgin Mary, is permitted for the feast of the Immaculate Conception in Spain and in some dioceses in Portugal, Mexico, and South America. In the Philippines, it is authorised for all feasts of the Virgin Mary, a practice followed in some other places without official warrant. There have also been uses of blue in place of violet for the season of Advent despite the fact that this practice is prohibited under liturgical law.\n\nWhite or cloth of gold was traditionally used for the Novena from 16 to 24 December according to a Spanish custom abolished in that country in the 1950s, but still widely observed in the Philippines. White is also used for East Asian Masses for the dead, as white is the traditional colour of mourning in many of the region’s cultures.\n\nViolet or black are often permitted on national holidays honoring military dead. For example in Canada, they are used on Remembrance Day.\n\nGold or silver may be worn on more solemn occasions in the Dioceses of the United States.\n\nIf you have enjoyed today’s blog post you might like to sign up for our newsletter and receive future posts via email.\n\nSubscribing is easy just fill in your email address in the box at the top right hand side of this page.

We are wrapped in them when we are born, they cushion our feet, they provide us with warmth whilst we sleep. They are carefully crafted into garments worn for important rites of passage, such as christenings, bar mitzvahs, and weddings.\n\nTextiles adorn our walls and decorate our homes. A wide range of textiles are passed down through families and institutions, and with it comes the responsibility of caring for them.\n\nThe textiles we collect and preserve will generally fall into two categories – those that we display and those that we use in a limited way such items as wedding and christening gowns.\n\nIn using and collecting textiles it is important to pass these items onto the next generation in the best possible condition.\n\nEventually they will become too fragile to use, or may be damaged beyond repair for the damage to be reversed even by the hands of a conservator.\n\nTextiles that are displayed in homes and public buildings are subject to deterioration by many environmental factors such as light, temperature and relative humidity, dust and dirt, insects, and improper storage or display.\n\nThe critical factors in maintaining your textile collection are control of environmental conditions, proper display techniques, and proper storage.\n\nWhilst the standards museums strive for are not feasible in the home I still thought, in my naivety, that I was caring for my collection of antique samplers in a responsible way.\n\nOne of the greatest threats to textiles is light. The worst damage is caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from natural daylight. I knew that it was important to display my samplers out of direct sunlight and for limited periods of time. I had been advised that I should rotate them every four months allowing them to “rest” in proper storage for the remainder of the year.\n\nWhat I hadn’t realized was that the same level of damage could be caused by fluorescent light bulbs. I am now re-looking at the way I light my home\n\nWhile the UV rays damage most rapidly, the entire light spectrum causes textile dyes to fade and the fibers to become brittle. This includes plain incandescent interior lighting. There is some protection in keeping window shades pulled down or shutters closed during the sunniest times of the day. UV filtering materials or films can be placed over windows and fluorescent bulbs.\n\nOther important factors to consider are high temperatures and humidity as they accelerate the deterioration of textiles and provide a climate for insects, mould, and mildew.\n\nA climate of 65-70°F and 50-55% relative humidity is best with as little fluctuation as possible.\n\nAir pollution is also an enemy of textiles. Fumes from vehicles and industry affect some dyes. Dirt and dust is a problem as dust particles act like small knives, cutting into fibers as the textiles expand and contract in response to changes in humidity. A regular schedule of inspection and vacuuming is necessary to maintain your collection.\n\nIf you add a sampler to your collection before bringing it into your home inspect it carefully including the frame. You do not want insect pests contaminating your other samplers or textiles. If you see clumps of eggs or even an odd egg beware of cross-contamination.\n\nEmbroidered samplers can “yellow” as they age, often so much that they appear a dirty brown colour.\n\nThis is a combination of the natural degradation of sampler material and the acidic backboards they were mounted on.\n\nThis acidity accumulates over the years, not only yellowing, but also adding to the fragility of the samplers and the degradation of their appearance.\n\nSamplers benefit from being cleaned by a trained conservator – the washing treatment will remove acidic products. The reduction of the yellowing will make the sampler look fresher and will make it more stable for the future.\n\nA conservator can stabilise and secure holes and loose threads but the fading of the threads cannot be reversed.\n\nThe conservator will be able to re-frame your sampler using conservation grade materials that are acid free and cause no adverse pressure or environmental effects on the sampler.\n\nWe are custodians of the needlework of yesteryear and we have a responsibility to ensure that the needlework and textiles in our care are passed onto the next generation in the best possible condition.\n\nThis stitch is no different to any other so don’t panic or dismiss trying it. Practice will help you understand the mechanics of the stitch. Then you will fall into its rhythm and be able to perfect your tension.\n\nTension is important – it is easy to work it too tightly or too loosely. Practice on a doodle cloth until you feel comfortable.\n\nLet’s look at a symmetrical shape to practice with. An acorn cup is a good one.\n\nThe first step is to stitch out the shape of the acorn cup using double running or back stitch. I have used double running.\n\nWithout piercing the fabric go under the first double running stitch and under the trailing thread.\n\nGo over the the loop of your working thread and pull gently.\n\nThis completes the first button hole stitch.\n\nRepeat through each double running stitch until the row is complete.\n\nI found it useful to use my needle to prevent pulling the thread too tight and maintain an even tension across the motif.\n\nEnsure you include the last double running stitch.\n\nTake the thread down under the fabric here.\n\nThe first row is complete.\n\nRepeat the whole process again starting with laying another trailing thread.\n\nLay the last trailing thread. Anchor the last row by taking your needle not only under the buttonhole loop, the trailing thread but also under the double running stitch.\n\nFrom the back of the fabric you can see that the fabric has not been pierced by the detached buttonhole stitches.\n\nLet us look at a more complicated shape- a flower.\n\nI began by outlining the first petal in double running stitch. Then started to stitch the rows of detached buttonhole in the right hand tip.\n\nDon’t worry too much how the row looks as you stitch it. When adding the following row you will see the prior row take shape. Have confidence in your work – see how the same rows look in the photo above and then the photo below.\n\nThen I worked the left hand tip followed by a line of stitches across the entire width of the petal\n\nCast on extra stitches as you work across so that there is room to add padding to the petal to give it shape.\n\nI used ends of thread (ORTS) of the same colour, scrunched up and pushed under the stitching before the last row was stitched and then secured the petal by anchoring down the last row.\n\nI then worked the petals either side of the first one, followed by the fourth, then finally the centre.\n\nPlease excuse the lines on this photo.\n\nI used a Mill Hill petite bead to pad the petals of the little flower as they were too small to pad with thread.\n\nDetached Buttonhole Filling can be used to create wonderful textures and add dimension to your work. The same flower has been stitched above in satin stitch and detached buttonhole filling.\n\n1 & 2 are acorn cups using the shape we practiced with above. The leaf marked at 3 has been padded and the leaf at 4 has no padding.\n\nHave fun experimenting with this stitch."
