        "text": "Description: Founded in 1767 by Clement Delor de Treget, born at Quercy, Cahors in southern France, and living at this time at Ste. Genevieve. He obtanied a grant from St. Ange and built a stone house here. The village was first known as Delor's Village. Afterwards it was known as Catalan's Prairie, so named for Louis Catalan, an early settler. Later it was called Louisbourg, probably honoring Louis XVI, the king of France (1774-1793). It is said that shortly after the territory passed from French to Spanish hands, Treget wished to have his commission as captain of the militia renewed. Since he was a Frenchman and Baron de Carondelet, the governor general of Louisiana, was in Spanish service, he feared that the commission might be refused him, so he flattered Carondelet by naming the village for him and received his commission. Don Francisco Luis Hector, Baron de Carondelet (1748-1807) was born at Noyelles, Flanders. He married into an influential Spanish family and became an officer in the Spanish army. He became governor and intendant of the provinces of Louisiana and West Florida in 1792. In early days the village was given the sobriquet Vide Poche (French for \"Empty Pocket\"), because the inhabitants were said to have been poor. Carondelet citizens had to buy flour from St. Louis, and often they could not pay for it--for their pockets were empty. Another explanation of the nickname was this: In French the adjective always follows the noun, so \"vide\" must be a verb and the name would mean \"Empties Pocket,\" conveying the idea that it was a place where the pockets of those visiting would be emptied. The inhabitants of Carondelet were noted for their hospitality and fondness for all kinds of sports and amusements. The St. Louis visitors would return home with emptied pockets--the Carondelet men may have had fleeter horses or have been more skillful card players. When a St. Louisan was asked to visit Carondelet on Sunday afternoon, he would reply, \"A quoi sert, c'est un vide poche.\" (Meaning, \"Of what use, it is a place that empties pocket\"). Vide Poche was Anglicized and became \"Wheat Bush.\" Another nickname applied to Carondelet was Pain de Sucre, the French for \"sugar-loaf,\" or \"cake of sugar.\" The petition for the incorporation of the town of St. Louis in 1809 gave as the southeast landmark Sugar-loaf-\"thence due south until it comes to the Sugar-loaf, thence due east to the Mississippi.\" Sugar loaf must have been a hill or an Indian mound that resembled a sugar-loaf in shape, and since it is at the southern boundary of St. Louis it must have been quite near Carondelet, or near enough to give the village the name, Pain de Sucre. Carondelet was incorporated in 1832, merged with the First Ward of St. Louis under the name South St. Louis in 1860, and annexed to St. Louis in 1870. (Wetmore (1837); Hayward (1853); Goodwin (1867); Hertich (1934), 5; EWT; Houck (1908); Brown (1817); Primm (1870), (1913); Dict. Am. Biog. (1930), III. 508; Gill; McDermott; Billon (1888), 21) Description: The first Catholic Church in St. Louis built in 1769 and blessed in 1770. It was so small and so carelessly constructed that on December 26, 1774, the settlers decided to build a new church, which was completed in 1776. Both these churches were on Walnut Street, between Second and Third Streets. In 1818 a third church was begun on the corner of Market and Second Streets, and was dedicated on January 9, 1820, but was never completed. In 1826 St. Louis was created an Episcopal See and the Right Rev. Joseph Rosati, C.M., was constituted its first bishop. In 1831 Bishop Rosati laid the cornerstone for a cathedral (now known as the Old Cathedral) on Walnut Street. It was consecrated in 1834. It is built on the only piece of property in St. Louis that has never been sold. The Old Cathedral is now surrounded by business houses. The parish maintains a parochial school taught by two Sisters of Loretto. The New Cathedral, Lindell Boulevard, Maryland and Newstead Avenues, was started in 1907 and blessed in 1914. For the name cf. St. Louis. A parochial school taught by the Sisters of St. Joseph and one lay teacher is attached. (Snow (1908), I. 57-63; Lange (1930), 173-5; CATH. REVIEW, IV. No. 1-2; CATHEDRALS; CATH. INSTITUTIONS (1911), 39-41, 49-87, 223; CATH. DIR. (1937) Description: A post office in Bonhomme Township. Many stories exist concerning the name of this place. Thomas says it was named for an early French fort. EWT says that La Salle in 1680 built a fort on the Illinois River about 150 miles from the Mississippi River and named it Crevecoeur, probably in compliment to Louis XIV, in allusion to his capture of a Netherlands fortress bearing that name in 1672. The capture of this famous Dutch fortress, at the junction of the Dieze and the Meuse, which had been given this boastful name (\"heart-breaker\") because its defenders deemed it impregnable, was one of the notable events of the War with Holland (1670- 1678). As an aristocratic family name, Crevecoeur is well known in French history; cf. General Philippe de Crevecouer, marshall of France in 1492, and the American-French writer Hector Saint-John de Crevecoeur (1731-1831), author of the \"Letters of an American Farmer\" (1784). Doubtless this explanation of the name as borrowed, first from Illinois and then from France, is the correct one; but its transparent significance has stimulated many fanciful stories. Thomas tells the story of an Indian maiden who fell in love with a Frenchman who visited her father's wigwam and confessed her love to him. When she saw his astonishment and embarassment, she ran to a rock jutting over the lake and plunged into the water. Judge Wilson Primm, the narrator of many fanciful tales, tells the story of Alexis Lalands, or le vieux Alexis as he was usually called, who settled on the banks of the lake-- then very remote from other settlements. His wife visited in St. Louis and when asked how she liked her new home, she replied \"C'est un vrai creve-coeur.\" (It is a true heart breaker) After that this epithet was applied to the community. Houck tells this story: In 1796 after a big flood of the Missouri River, there was much sickness in the bottom and among the first French settlers there. A large number died and the survivors abandoned the locality; hence the name. Others have explained the name as descriptive of the shape of the lake. These are interesting legends that have grown up about the place in an attempt to explain the name. (Hayward (1853); Goodwin (1867); Postal Guide (1876--); COUNTY ATLAS (1876); PLAT BOOK (1909); Thomas (1911), 264 ff.; Houck (1908); Violette (1918); Hertich (1934), 40; Primm (1870) Description: Authorities seem to vary in their accounts of when this village was settled. EWT says it was founded as a trading post and a Jesuit mission soon after the founding of St. Louis. Schard says the El Baron de Carondelet alluded to it in 1772 as a new settlement in the \"district of Ylinoa by the name of San Fernando.\" Houck says that the date of the first settlement is not known, but that Perrin du Lac in his TRAVELS states that it was established in 1790 by some inhabitants of St. Louis. According to Houck the region was known as Florissant or Fleurissant long before it received the name of St. Ferdinand or San Fernando de Florissant. Violette states that the first settlement was probably made in 1785, and that Florissant is an abbreviation for the longer name San Fernando de Florissant. Thomas says that the village was known as Fleurissant in 1772 and was incorporated in that year, making it the oldest town in St. Louis County. Probably San Fernando or St. Ferdinand was the official name and Fleurissant the popular nickname (cf. St. Louis and Pain Court, Carondelet and Vide Poche), and later the two were combined. St. Ferdinand is, of course, the French form of the Spanish San Fernando, and Florissant is \"Missouri French\" for the correct French adjective \"fleurissant,\" flowery, prosperous, or flourishing. St. Ferdinand (1198-1252), was king of Castile and Leon. The town has had a post office since 1830. (Green's Postal Guide (1831); Wetmore (1837); Hayward (1853); Goodwin (1867); Postal Guide (1876--); PLAT BOOK (1909); Thomas (1911), I. 296 ff.; EWT; Houck (1908); Violette (1918); Scharf (1883), I. 858; II. 1887, 1893) Description: A river which forms the boundary line between St. Louis County and Jefferson County except for the southern line of Bonhomme Township which is a straight line, above which the Meramec makes an irregular semicircle. The Meramec flows into the Mississippi River at the southeastern point of St. Louis County and the northeastern point of Jefferson County. One of the oldest names in the region, which Hodge lists as \"Merameg\" from \"Manumaig,\" the Chippewa for catfish, and the name of a tribe living about the great lakes in 1672 according to the Jesuit Relations. Meramec, also spelled \"Maramet,\" and \"Maramegoua,\" is an Algonquin word signifying \"a good fish,\" according to Rothensteines. Gannett also lists it as meaning \"catfish.\" Mr. Bert Loewenstein, writing in the St. Louis POST DISPATCH, gives a detailed account of the history of the name Meramec. He writes that Joliet and Marquette were probably the first Europeans to pass the mouth of the Meramec; for although they make no mention of the river in their account of the voyage down the Mississippi to the mouth of the Arkansas, Father Marquette notes the location of the \"Maroa\" tribe in the country of the Illinois. The Recollect missionary, Father Membre, who accompanied La Salle and De Tonty, writes of \"the village of the Tamaroas on the eastern bank, about six leagues below the River of the Ozages.\" La Salle, De Tonty, Fathers Joutel, Marest, Pinet, and other missionaries mention the \"Tamaroas\" or \"Maroas\" and their villages, which they locate \"ten leagues below the River of Illinois,\" or six miles below the mouth of the \"Pekitanoui,\" the river of the \"Missouries.\" The first historical notice of the river is found in the account of a voyage by Father James Gravier in the year 1700. He wrote: \"We discovered the river Mearamigoua where a rich lead mine is situated.\" Penicaut, a member of Le Seur's mineralogical expedition, mentions in 1700, \"one finds a small stream called the Meramecsipy.\" In 1702 De Iberville applied to the French Government for the exclusive privilege to work the lead mines on the Riviere Maramequisipi. The Sieur La Renaudiere explored the region in 1723 and wrote an \"Account of the mines of M. de la Motte and M. de Maramet.\" In May, 1723, Dixon D'Artaguiette wrote, \"About one o'clock M. Renault, director of the mines, arrived here from the Meramek Mines.\" On June 14, 1723, Pierre Dugue de Boisbriant and Marc Antonine de La Laire des Ursin, Intendant, granted to Renault a league and a half of ground upon the \"Little Merameig\" and in the \"river Merameig.\" The \"Maroa,\" the Indian tribe whose villages were nearest to the river's mouth, seems to be the origin of the word according to Mr. Loewenstein. The second syllable \"mec,\" \"mac,\" \"meg,\" or \"meg\" is a term common among the Algonquin tribes. It apparently signifies a branch river or small stream as opposed to \"missi,\" \"mitchi\" meaning great. The many spellings would naturally result from the difficulty of settlers with the original name. (MISSOURI HIST. REV., \"Earliest History of Mine La Motte,\" John E. Rothensteines, vol. 20, 200; Salem POST, Feb. 8, 1934; Houck, HISTORY OF MISSOURI, vol. 1, 281; Gannett, 205; R.M.; Wetmore (1837), 250; Bert Loewenstein, St. Louis POST DISPATCH (Sept. 10, 1938); Miss O'Brien's thesis) Description: The pronunication of St. Louis is an example of progressive Anglicization: French: _____; earlier American (now seldom heard): _____; usual present pronunciation: In 1762 Maxent, Laclede and Company, merchants at New Orleans, obtained a license from the French governor of Louisiana to trade with the Indians on the Upper Mississippi and the Missouri River. By February, 1763, France had ceded all her possessions in North America to Spain and England. On August 3, 1763, Pierre Liguest Laclede (d. 1778) and his party departed for the upper Mississippi and arrived at Fort Chartres on November 3. In December with a small party, Laclede selected and marked the spot where he wanted to build his trading post. He passed the winter of 1763-1764 in Fort Chartres waiting for the river to open up so that he could establish his new trading post. During this winter the news of France's delivering her territory east of the Mississippi to England reached Fort Chartres. Because there was so much excitement and fear in the minds of the French settlers, Laclede decided to build a village around his contemplated trading post so that those who were dissatisfied with the English government could move across the river to his village. Laclede sent the fourteen-year old Auguste Chouteau (1750- 1829), with thirty men and boys to build the new settlement. They landed on the designated place on March 14, 1764 and began cutting trees the next day. Early in April Laclede came over to the new settlement and selected the spot for his house. Laclede assigned lots to the thirty men who had helped establish the village. By the following year so many settlers had come over from the Illinois side that quite a village had sprung up. The settlement was known as Laclede's village.\n\nChouteau selected the name St. Louis for the village in honor of Louis XV of France, whose subject he expected to be for a long time (he never imagined that he was the subject of the king of Spain), and the king's patron saint, Louis IX, who ruled France in the thirteenth century and was commonly known as St. Louis. The derisive name, Pain Court, given to St. Louis, may be translated as \"short of bread,\" indicating that very frequently there was a shortage of flour. It is said that St. Louis depended upon Ste. Genevieve for its flour and that often, due to the lack of money or to the poor method of transportation, the inhabitants were short of bread. Another explanation of the name is that the inhabitants of Carondelet were obliged to get their bread from St. Louis since they had no flour mills of their own. The loaves of bread were short or of short weight; this explanation gives a more nearly correct translation of the French name, Pain Court. It seems that the sense of humor of the early settlers manifested itself in the giving of derisive names to the neighboring villages, as in the case of Misere for Ste. Genevieve, and Vide Poche for Carondelet (q.v.). That the mocking name Pain Court for St. Louis had spread far beyond mere local usage is shown by its use in Thomas Jefferson's NOTES ON VIRGINIA (1782). In the American statesman's famous descriptive account of his native state, the French nickname, in the spelling, \"Pancore,\" is apparently preferred to St. Louis: Jefferson speaks (chap. 2, page 11 of the original edition) of \"the Spanish merchants at Pancore, or St. Louis.\" A rather striking and remarkable feature of the site of St. Louis was the large number of Indian mounds. The soubriquet Mound City was aptly applied to the town and even after the mounds had been removed, the appellation stuck. A post office was established in 1808. In 1809 St. Louis was incorporated as a town, and in 1822 it was chartered as a city. The limits of the city have been extended many times. In 1875 the city withdrew from St. Louis County.\n\n(Green's Postal Guide (1831); Wetmore (1837); Goodwin (1867); Postal Guide (1876--); EWT; Houck (1908); Thomas (1911); Eaton (1916); Violette (1918); Rader (1907); Williams & Shoemaker (1930); ENCY.
