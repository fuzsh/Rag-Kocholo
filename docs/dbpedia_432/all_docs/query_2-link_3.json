        "text": "While many students are now off for the summer, counsellors and universities continue to be busy, as are we at The University Guys Yesterday, I delivered a session on \"Current trends in UK admissions\" for members of the All Indian Independent Educational Consultants' Association, who were visiting London. SP Jain London School of Management was gracious enough to host us all. Thank you to Andrew Cheung, Head of Undergraduate Recruitment and Outreach, for making this happen. SP Jain will form part of our Autumn roadshows, and we look forward to further collaborating to present options for students.\n\nI'll share more thoughts from a week in Canada visiting colleges and attending the International ACAC conference, but I wanted to start by thanking colleagues who joined me for two panel sessions. Johanna Fishbein and Angolwisye Paul Mwakisu helped me discuss how to say \"no\" in the world of higher education - to students, parents, families, counsellors, administrators and colleagues. We shared data, stories and resources on how to have conversations that lead to healthy outcomes. Then Gregory Dellorco and Luke Devlin joined a panel to discuss the nexus of profit, business, commercialism and finances in the world of international higher education. We explored how school counsellors and universities can find out who owns different companies, how to find out the eventual beneficiaries of profit / surplus, and the sorts of questions to ask vendors and service providers about their ownership structures, how much tax they pay, and where the money eventually ends up. Both sessions were really wonderful to be part of and (I hope) very much the start of conversations in our community.\n\nWe have two more crazy weeks as the UK academic school year draws to a close - but gosh, it's been a busy one. From the very top of Scotland to the very bottom of England, our team has been out and about this week!\n\nLike a good Common App essay, the week has had a powerful beginning, a meaty middle and a satisfying ending. On Monday, we attended the UES Education Conference, networking with counsellors from across the UK and beyond. We discussed trends for 2023-24 and shared thoughts for the year ahead. In the middle of the week, we visited Bromsgrove School, Stockport Grammar School, Claremont Independent School, Royal Russell School, and Manchester High School for Girls, delivering numerous workshops, including on US application essays. We have also been dedicating time and effort to planning, confirming, and coordinating our Autumn 2024 roadshows for global universities and developing creative ideas for 2025. Then, as the week drew to a conclusion, there were workshops for Felsted School and Hurtwood House. David Hawkins, Sheena Mehta, Melanie Moorhouse, Holly Smith and Tom Whittaker\n\nSix schools in three days meant for a busy week... but it is was great to spend time with so many wonderful students and counsellors. Plus there was lots of planning at each stop for our autumn 2024 international universities roadshows - still space available for any global universities wishing to join! https://lnkd.in/e_MeRW6Z"
