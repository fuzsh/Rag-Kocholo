        "text": "Anybody who is honoured to receive a King’s Award for voluntary services is special, but how many are still active champions at the age of 95? Dr Patricia Fleetwood-Walker was one such rare breed and only a week before she died, she was on a Teams board meeting with the City of Birmingham‘s Prevention First Citizen’s Panel. But she was not only an advocate for service users, having been a life-long carer, she was also an innovator who put her intelligence and passion to work in all the areas of her life: inspiring her family of six children with all kinds of entertaining projects; developing life-long learning in the world of academia, medicine and business; giving support to the Labour Party; enjoying The Arts, keeping up to date with scientific developments and much laughter and debate with her many and diverse friends.\n\nPat was born in Birmingham, UK, against the back-drop of the Wall Street crash. She was the second child of working-classing parents Karl and Katie Fleetwood. Katie dreamed of teaching, but instead helped run her own parents’ business, Langs Sweets, at Five Ways, Birmingham. Karle was a mechanical engineer with a love of reading to the family, including The Seven Pillars of Wisdom and tales of Ernest Shackleton, which encouraged the children’s lively interest in the world around them. Both children were obviously academic (John studied engineering before joining the Dominican Order).\n\nBefore the age of five, in the absence of antibiotics or a health service, Pat very nearly died twice after serious bouts of pneumonia, involving days of unconsciousness. When she finally opened her eyes and asked: “Can I have a sweetie Granny?”, she couldn’t understand why this induced her grandmother to cry. She spent a couple of years at George Dixon Primary School, before being funded to attend St Paul’s Convent School. She went on to receive a rare scholarship to study Botany at the University of Birmingham and so managed to cross not only class boundaries but those of gender too.\n\nWhile Pat studied for her PhD, majoring on the fungus that caused the Irish potato blight, her brother John encouraged her to get involved in leading the boys at St Philip’s Scout troop in Edgbaston and there she met fellow scout leader Colin Fleetwood-Walker (1921-1987). Colin was an architect, son of the portrait painter Bernard Fleetwood Walker (1993-1965) and a survivor of the WW2 Arctic Convoys. Pat and Colin married in 1953, surrounded by cub scouts. For a while Pat did the accounts for Colin’s architectural firm. The couple went on to have six children: Susan, Judith, Rebecca, Jonathan, Ruth and David. So focussed was Pat on continuing to develop her mind, that she would prop a Teach-Yourself-Russian handbook behind the taps, while hand washing piles of laundry.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s were a particularly turbulent time for the family, with many life-changing and seminal challenges, not least of which was the death of Jonny (1959-1976) in a motorbike accident. This was followed by Colin’s chronic illness and later his death in 1987.\n\nThroughout all this time Pat not only looked after and provided for the family but increasingly became the main bread-winner, firstly in the Educational Services Unit at the University of Birmingham and later at the University of Aston in Birmingham as Head of Extension Education; a ground-breaking team who worked with academics (in both the US and UK) and industry to develop tutored video instruction and materials, enabling the huge waves of innovation that dominated the economy of the 1980s.\n\nPat retired in 1994 but never stopped working, continuing to be very active in promoting sustainable communities in the West Midlands. Of these (and particularly close to her heart) the Birmingham Citizen’s Panel who work to maintain and raise standards of support for vulnerable people. In recognition of their commitment, Citizen’s Panel members (including Pat) were awarded the Kings Award for Voluntary Service in May 2024.\n\nAt her 90th birthday celebration, Pat attributed her long life to the NHS, luck (as a student, she was almost run over by a motorbike) but mainly to family and friends who helped her to live independently. As a long-term Labour Party member and supporter, Pat was rewarded with a Labour win just four days before she died and in her delight gave a huge smile and thumbs up to the ward staff at the QE Hospital.\n\nFurther details are available online.\n\nThirteen-year-old Gioietta, pretty and outspoken, boarded the French ocean liner SS Champollion in Shanghai, China in January 1947. Traveling with an uncle and her two brothers, ages 12 and 10, she arrived in Marseille, France two months later following a wide eyed journey halfway around the world. A Chinese girl whose father had given her an Italian name, Gioietta’s family and culture were deeply rooted in China, though the connections that would bring her to other parts of the world had already been established. A strong influence in the life of his beloved daughter, Gioietta’s father in particular lived and moved fluidly between continents and cultures.\n\nChina’s civil war would come to an end in 1949, with the Chinese Communist Party as victors. At the time that Gioietta left China, her mother was away studying filmmaking in the US. Her father felt compelled to send for his three children to join him in Europe. Given his political ties, he may also have had concern for China’s future. Gioietta’s father studied at the Sorbonne in Paris in the 1920s, married her mother on his return to China, serving as Minister of Education in Chiang Kai-Shek’s Nationalist government, and was then living in Paris again having taken up a post with UNESCO.\n\nIn the early years of her life, Gioietta’s family lived in Nanking and later moved to Chengdu where she led an idyllic childhood of rickshaw rides to school and briefly even a panda bear as a pet. Gioietta would go on to live in France, England, Yugoslavia (Croatia), and finally the United States. As early as in her 20s, she thought herself too westernised to be Chinese, too European to be English, and too English to be French, with none fitting her perfectly. Gioietta was an independent spirit who often found herself the unfamiliar figure in an unfamiliar place, making sense of >where she fit in.\n\nHome base was her father’s apartment in Paris across the English Channel, and at age 14 she was enrolled at Badminton School, an all-girls boarding school in Bristol, England. As the only Chinese girl and speaking no more than 20 words of English, she found academic comfort in the maths and sciences where she was able to\n\nexcel and give herself a persona. Four years later, now fluent in English and having earned an “Oxbridge accent” no less, she continued on this track, enrolling at Newnham College, University of Cambridge aspiring to be a nuclear physicist in a field where women were rare, which suited her fine.\n\nAlways a brilliant student, she went on to earn her PhD in Physics at the University of Birmingham. It was also here that she met her lab partner and future husband. Marijan Petravic was a “handsome and clever” student from Zagreb, Croatia, who was also studying for his PhD, on a state scholarship programme sponsored by the Yugoslav government. Finishing her studies in 1957 and eagerly anticipating the opportunities that awaited her, an already accomplished Gioietta was fittingly excited to start a position as a research physicist at the French Atomic Energy Commision in Paris while Marijan returned to Yugoslavia to complete his military service.\n\nIn the spring of 1959, 26-year-old Gioietta, nervous but resolved and with a one way ticket in hand, boarded a train in Paris, arriving in Zagreb that same week. Now married after having earned their doctorates together, in partnership they began working in the same office at the renowned Ruđer Bošković Institute for Scientific Research, embarking on careers in theoretical physics where more often than not they were never more than a hallway apart. Two and a half blissful years were spent in Croatia exploring the region's mountains and the islands of the Adriatic, and feeling first the distance and then the embrace of Marijan’s extended family of cousins, aunts and uncles.\n\nThey returned to England in 1961, first working at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, the UK’s National Laboratory for research in that promising field. Years later, Gioietta proudly accepted a prestigious position as research fellow at St Hilda’s College, University of Oxford. Settling in the small town of Abingdon-on-Thames, in a reddish-brown brick house with two apple trees in the back garden, they joyfully began to raise two sons. Mark and Robin, by right of their birthplace, were the first in the family to be granted the hardcover dark blue British passports. Their connection to Continental Europe remained strong.\n\nAnnual winter trips to ski in the Swiss Alps, an influence of her father’s, were relished from beginning to end. Annual summer road trips to coastal Croatia, a connection to Marijan’s family, were planned for months in advance. As talented with languages as she was with scientific pursuits, Gioietta added Croatian as another language mastered, surprising and embarrassing many in her husband’s homeland as the Chinese girl who spoke fluent Croatian.\n\nIn the late 1960’s, on the tail of her father’s entanglement in diplomatic conflict between China, Taiwan, and Europe, Gioietta’s long term future in the UK was called into question by association. Her position at a National Laboratory was unfairly taken away, and citizenship applications were held up. It was a difficult period, but as always Gioietta’s tenacity and resolve found a way through. In the mid-1970s, without the stability of the British passports they were still seeking, the couple decided to move their family to the US. They had been offered work at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey.\n\nUnknowing that this third continent would become home for the rest of her life but eager for the new adventure, 44-year-old Gioietta boarded the plane at London’s Gatwick airport and stepped off, this time on the same day, at New York’s JFK airport in June of 1977. She never quite traded her intellectual British accent for an American one. At this point, being of another place was always going to be part of who she was. She worked at Princeton for 12 years. This was followed by a short stint, Gioietta’s first position outside the field of research physics though her brilliance in computer programming was nothing new, developing software and patenting technologies related to medical imaging.\n\nGioietta and her family settled easily and happily in New Jersey, where life became more focused on domestic pleasures and less cosmopolitan by nature. Ironically, confirmation of the British passports came shortly after their arrival to the US. Summer road trips to Continental Europe were traded in for road trips across the American Continent. A white 1969 Austin 1800 sedan with British plates, towing a boat onto the ferry from England to Holland, was traded for a blue and white 1973 Volkswagen van with “Garden State” plates that explored the National Parks of the Rocky Mountain west.\n\nFollowing retirement, and with their two sons through college, Gioietta and her husband moved to California where they built a home close to Yosemite Valley whose natural beauty they loved. In their older age they moved back to the east coast, settling close by their older son outside Philadelphia. In her retirement, Gioietta’s lifelong focus on goals and academic achievement drove her to author many independent academic papers, ranging in topics from energy to climate change and published in academic journals.\n\nAfter years of health problems related to losing her kidneys to cancer in her early 70’s, Gioietta entered hospice care in mid-June 2023. She was happy to be at home with family, and later that same week passed away gracefully in her sleep following an evening of laughter and ice cream. Her husband of 64 years, Marijan, was as always at her side.\n\nStudying medicine at Birmingham University (1951-56) set my father, Christopher John Garrett, on course for a career that included 35 years in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and a further decade as a palliative care consultant.\n\nAs an undergraduate at Birmingham he also met the love of his life, Gwen, née Goodson. They met on Chris' 21st birthday, New Year's Day 1955, on the maternity ward at nearby Dudley Road Hospital (now Birmingham City). Chris was studying obstetrics and gynaecology, while Gwen was already working there as a midwife.\n\nIn June 1956, just one week after Chris' graduation, he and Gwen were married at Kings Norton parish church, Birmingham. Within ten months they were parents, the apparent inability of a doctor and midwife to wait to conceive a child until after Chris had found permanent employment prompting much merriment in both families!\n\nIn July 1957, already father to a two-month-old baby, Chris was called up to do national service. Gwen had given up work to look after their son and, as a national serviceman under the age of 25, he would not be entitled to family allowance.\n\nThere was little question, therefore, that he would refuse the Army's offer of a short-service commission. He spent the three years in Scotland, first as medical officer to the Joint Services School for Linguists, Crail, then running Edinburgh's Army medical reception station.\n\nThe experience led, perhaps with equal inevitability, to a long-service commission. Had Chris gone to work in the NHS in 1960 his salary would have fallen from £1,700 per annum as an acting Major to £670. By then, he and Gwen had another child, while the Army also offered a £1,500 signing-on fee, which they spent on their first car.\n\nChris' first posting as a regular was to the Royal Army Medical College, Millbank. This stint included a 12-month secondment to the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, where he worked alongside Dr Alec Cooke and wrote a number of papers, notably on the treatment of diabetes.\n\nBefore his first overseas posting, to Malaysia in 1963, Chris obtained the diploma in Tropical Medicine & Hygiene from the University of London. Later, as the Army's Professor of Military Medicine, he would organise bi-annual courses on the subject.\n\nIt pained Chris, who was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1980, that his last task in the Army was to oversee the closure of British military hospitals in Germany. He had served twice at one of them, Munster (1966-72 and 1978-83), the second time as commanding officer as well as consultant physician.\n\nOther postings included Woolwich, Colchester, Dhekelia (Cyprus), Kuala Lumpur and Malacca (Malaysia). Chris eventually retired from the RAMC with the rank of brigadier, having spent his last four years as Deputy Commander (Medical), British Army of the Rhine, based at Rheindalen.\n\nEver inquisitive about medicine, he made a new start as consultant physician to the Pilgrims Hospices in Kent. He undertook the role for a further decade, learning about palliative care and opening two new units.\n\nHis final - and toughest - job was to look after Gwen, following her diagnosis with Alzheimer's. She died in 2016, six months before their 60th wedding anniversary.\n\nChris was born in Birmingham, the grandson of a doctor who had practised in New South Wales before returning from Australia to Britain. His father, John Grafton Garrett, known as Jack, was a lecturer in mine surveying at Birmingham University from 1921 until 1946.\n\nJack was secretary of the Birmingham branch of the Association of University Teachers (AUT) from 1931 onwards and represented non-professorial staff on the university's court of governors from 1934 and on the senate from 1943.\n\nThe family lived close to the University, in Langleys Road, Selly Oak. However, Jack's premature death from leukaemia forced his widow, Ida, to return to work as a teacher.\n\nShe was working in Wiltshire when Chris left Bromsgrove School in 1951, followed by the congratulations of his headteacher, David Walters. He stated in Chris' final school report that \"He has done well here and developed splendidly. He is a good Bromsgrovian who will enhance our reputation at Birmingham University.\"\n\nChris leaves three children, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. He and Gwen are buried in Winscombe, Somerset.\n\nJames Garrett\n\nIt is with extreme sadness that we announce the passing of our family's beloved patriarch, Dr. Waleed Jazrawi. Waleed was an energetic, adventurous, spirited, generous, and genuinely sentimental person, who loved life to its core. Waleed treasured his family and friends and there was nothing he wouldn't do for the people he cared about. Waleed's generosity and hospitality touched the lives of so many and he will be dearly missed by his family and his friends, both in Calgary and around the world.\n\nWaleed was born on September 27, 1938, to his parents Alice (neé Mazzucchi) and Wadie Al-Jazrawy in Baghdad, Iraq. Waleed loved his homeland of Iraq and reminisced often about his childhood in Mosul, which he shared with his younger brother Khalid and his younger sister Helen. Waleed was also deeply influenced and mentored by his uncle Munir Al-Jazrawy, who he esteemed throughout his life. Waleed left Iraq when he was 17 years old to attend Wrexham's Glyndwr University for a year to complete his A-levels. Waleed was then accepted to his beloved alma mater, the University of Birmingham, where he completed his Bachelor of Science with Honours, and then went straight on to a PhD programme in chemical engineering. Waleed and his wife, Maggie, would return annually for the University Alumni Reunion and Waleed maintained his relationships with his colleagues for 50 years.\n\nWaleed's time spent in Birmingham were some of his most cherished years, where he made many lifelong friends, and of course, where he met the love of his life, Margaret Hadley. Waleed met Maggie when she was 15 (almost 16) years old, and they dated for six years. Waleed would pick Maggie up on his motorbike (despite her beehive hair-do and 1960s style skirt), and they would enjoy music, dancing, and trips to local areas. Waleed and Maggie eventually traveled the world together, faced life's challenges together, and Maggie was his greatest supporter until the very end, advocating for what she knew he loved and believed in.\n\nAfter graduating with his PhD in Petroleum Engineering, Waleed and Maggie were married on April 19, 1965, and officially started their life together. After considering a number of opportunities, Waleed and Maggie decided to immigrate to Canada after Waleed accepted a position with Imperial Oil, kick-starting a 53-year career in the petroleum industry. Waleed and Maggie eventually settled in Calgary, Alberta, with Waleed working for Esso for over 25 years. Waleed eventually worked for a number of different oil companies, including CanOxy, where he served as President for their Yemeni operation. Eventually, Waleed started his own consulting company, and served as a board member for companies such as Japex and helped to oversee their Canadian subsidiary, Jacos. Waleed loved what he did for a living. He loved all the opportunities his career afforded him, including travel to nearly every continent and work on new and exciting projects.\n\nWaleed was the beloved father of three daughters: Nadia Maria (born in 1967), Muna Christine (born in 1969), and Sarah Elizabeth (born in 1975). Waleed always set the highest expectations for his daughters and always told them that nothing could hold them back from what they wanted to achieve. He paid into scholarship programmes from the time they were born so they would eventually attend university, which they did, graduating with bachelor's and master's degrees. Waleed taught his daughters how to ski and waterski, how to drive and parallel park, how to mow the lawn, how to play pool and ping-pong. Most importantly, Waleed was always there for his daughters to give important and meaningful advice, and he supported them in every way he could. Waleed was truly a model of what a father should be.\n\nWaleed worked until his late 70s, as long as he could, until he was diagnosed with Primary Progressive Aphasia, which affected his ability to speak. In his retirement, Waleed enjoyed his life no matter where he was, whether it was in his Calgary home, his home in Mesa, Arizona, or in his cherished home in Timber Ridge, Invermere. Waleed enjoyed spending time with his grandchildren, Adam, and Layla Ainsley, taking them skiing, on motorbike rides, or sharing his favorite musicals with them. He loved to be surrounded by friends and family, he loved listening to music (everything from Ella Fitzgerald, to the Gypsy Kings, to Pavarotti) and watching his favorite movies (Lawrence of Arabia, Dr. Zhivago, and of course, Shane). Waleed was eventually diagnosed with Corticobasal Syndrome, and it gradually took away all his mobility, however, he would laugh and interact as much as he could, and he was strong and determined to the very end.\n\nWaleed was predeceased by his mother Alice; his father Wadie; his mother-in-law Irene; his father-in-law Ronald; his Amo Munir; and his sister Helen. He is survived by his loving wife Maggie; his brother Khalid; his daughter Nadia (married to Anthony Verna); his daughter Muna (married to George Apostolakos); his daughter Sarah (married to Adrian Martinez); his grandson Adam Ainsley; and his granddaughter Layla Ainsley.\n\nPhotos, memories, and condolences may be shared with Waleed's family through www.evanjstrong.com. An online book of condolences is available online until 16 February 2023.\n\nJohn Rick Turner, 64, fondly known as Rod or Rick, passed away at his home in Panama City Beach, Florida, on Saturday, October 30, 2021.\n\nHe was born in Stourbridge, England (UK) on July 12, 1957 to Margaret Astbury Turner and the late Joseph Raymond Turner. In addition to his father, he was preceded in death by his uncle Mike and aunt Janet Astbury and his mother-in-law Kathleen Harrison Thompson.\n\nRick is survived by his beloved wife Karen Harrison Turner and his mother Margaret Astbury Turner and many cousins in the UK with whom he kept in regular contact, his brother-in-law Roger Harrison and wife Dianna and their son Brandon and many friends and colleagues. He will be dearly missed by all who knew him.\n\nHe enjoyed several generations of pampered cats which added immense joy and inspiration to his life.\n\nRick graduated with a BSc (Honours) in Psychology in 1979 from University of Sheffield (UK), earned a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) from Sheffield Hallam University (UK) in 1980, obtained a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from University of Birmingham (UK) in 1984 based on his dissertation entitled “Heart Rate Responses to Psychological Stress”. In 2016, he was awarded the higher doctoral degree of Doctor of Science (DSc) in Cardiovascular Pharmaceutical Medicine from University of Sheffield (UK) based on his application dossier detailing his scholarly activities from 1985-2015.\n\nRick held an academic position at University of Birmingham (UK) - postdoctoral Fellowship-Psychology. Inspired by academic opportunities in the US, he emigrated in 1987 to hold positions at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as postdoctoral Fellowship & Research Assistant Professor in Psychiatry, University of California, Berkley as Research Scholar, School of Public Health, University of Tennessee, Memphis as Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Preventative Medicine and Medical College of Georgia as Associate Professor of Pediatrics until 1996. In 2005 he returned to academia at Campbell University (NC) as Associate Professor of Clinical Research, Drug Safety Scholar, and Chairman, Department of Clinical Research until 2009 and held the position of Adjunct Professor of Pharmacy Practice at Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences since 2015.\n\nHe was employed at GlaxoSmithKline from 2003-2005 as a Clinical Submission Scientist, at Quintiles (now IQVIA) from 2009-2018 as a Senior Scientific Director, Translational Cardiovascular Safety, Scientific Director, Clinical Communications (Corporate Communications division) and Chief Scientific Advisor, Cardiac Safety Services and at DRT Strategies Inc. from 2018-2020 as an Expert Consultant/Federal Contractor assigned to the FDA. Rick was President of his Turner Consulting & Communications company since 1991 in which he wrote and edited scientific/medical publications. Most recently he started working with Chenega Corporation as a Federal Contractor assigned to the FDA.\n\nJ. Rick Turner, PhD, DSc was an experimental research scientist, clinical trialist, author, editor, educator, and communicator. He spent the first part of his professional career in the field of cardiovascular behavioral medicine, detailing the individual differences apparent in cardiovascular responses to behavioral and psychological stressors, including genetic influences upon them. He received two international awards for his research and was coeditor of the 2013 Springer volume Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine, the definitive work in this area at that time. Over many years he enjoyed collaborating on various Cardiac Safety Research Consortium projects aimed at improving global patient safety and was a former Editor-in-Chief of the DIA’s peer-reviewed Drug Information Journal. His vast experience spanned twenty years in academia, eleven years in the pharmaceutical industry, and over thirty years of scientific/medical writing and publications.\n\nHe was the author and coauthor of over 150 publications in peer-reviewed journals, as well as articles in professional journals and author, coauthor and editor of over 15 books.\n\nAwards and honours include the British Medical Research Council Doctoral Scholarship (1981-1984), Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career Contribution to Psychophysiology from the Society for Psychophysiological Research (1988), Early Career Award for Contributions to Psychosomatic Medicine from the American Psychosomatic Society (1993) and conferred the Honor of Fellow by the Society of Behavioral Medicine (1999), American Society of Hypertension (2016), now American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology (2016), European Society of Cardiology (2017) and American College of Clinical Pharmacology (2017).\n\nA Celebration of Life Memorial service will be scheduled in the US and UK at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the American Heart Association, British Heart Foundation or online.\n\nCondolences may also be left online.\n\nRick Allen joined the University in 1973, studying Chemical Engineering. His character was one of hard work and determination which he applied to everything that caught his interest. He immediately joined 'The Stoats’, the University of Birmingham Mountaineering Club and quickly became a competent rock climber and mountaineer; he was often seen practicing climbing on the Bournebrook wall, overlooking the playing fields towards the Bristol Road. Indeed, those at the University in the 70s may remember Rick’s ascent of Old Joe one carnival season (with thanks to the University for permitting and supporting the climb).\n\nUpon graduating in 1976 Rick started work for Blackbird Starling, boilermakers in Glasgow; I speculate that this was at least in part to get closer to the Scottish mountains, where he showed a natural ability for snow and ice climbing. In the 1980s, Rick took a job in Saudi Arabia installing boilers at an oil refinery, but his thoughts were never far away from the mountains and he was known to practice skiing on the sand dunes. Whilst in Saudi Arabia he found time to visit and climb the world-famous Diamond Couloir on Mount Kenya, a ribbon of ice that has now virtually disappeared due to global warming.\n\nOn returning to Aberdeen for a job in the oil industry, Rick found his new employer remarkably supportive to his passion for climbing expeditions and trips to the Himalayas became his norm. In 1982 an avalanche caused the team to retreat from Kirti Stambh (6271m); undeterred Rick went on to complete the first ascent solo. It was a hallmark of his approach to life that, when others were giving up, he would “just have another look”, an approach that resulted in many successful achievements. Rick reasoned that, if the snow had already avalanched it was unlikely to do it again soon; perhaps that was the start of his career focus on Health and Safety? Rick married Alison, another mountaineer, who enthusiastically encouraged his activities and sometimes accompanied him; sadly Alison died from cancer in 1999. Rick’s work in the oil industry then took him to Kazakhstan with Texaco; that was where the oil was at and conveniently close to the Pamir mountains and not far from the other Himalayan ranges.\n\nOn 26 May 2000 Rick summited Everest. He was already an accomplished Himalayan mountaineer, with a number of ascents and new routes to his credit, Ganesh II, Pumori, Dhaulagiri, which became his first 8000m peak. He moved to Tadjikistan in 2006, still working in the oil industry between mountains. It was here that he made the first British ascent of Pik Karl Marx and the first ascent of the North Ridge of Pik Ovalraya. He also met and married Zuhra. Rick’s last career move was to Western Australia as Head of Health and Safety for Chevron on the Gorgon natural gas project; sadly Zuhra was homesick for Tadjikistan and their marriage did not endure.\n\nUndoubtedly Rick’s finest mountaineering achievement was the first complete traverse of the Mazeno Ridge to the summit of Nanga Parbat, with fellow mountaineer Sandy Allan. Whilst Rick avoided the limelight, this ascent caught the attention of the mountaineering world and in Rick’s own words: “The mountaineering world has had many nice things to say about the ascent, usually accompanied by an expression of astonishment at the age of the protagonists.” Both Rick and Sandy were awarded the Piolet d'Or (the Golden Ice-axe) the highest honour in mountaineering.\n\nRick's last expedition was to K2, exploring a new route. Before departure he had said to me that he thought he had done his last trip, but perhaps just have another look. The avalanche came at night and the Pakistani guides, his friends, rushed from another camp and found him. Rick was regarded as a sort of legendary grandfather in those parts and was buried the following morning in the shadow of K2 with prayers in different languages and religions.\n\nI consider a blue plaque by the steps of the Bournebrook wall, where he practised climbing, would be a most fitting tribute to someone who was undoubtedly one of the finest and highest achieving mountaineers.\n\nMike Grain (BSc Physics 1974; MSc Reactor Physics 1975)\n\nA tribute from John Whellock (BSc Chemical Engineering, 1969; PhD Chemical Engineering, 1972)\n\nIn a number of instances, I am aware how the pandemic removed our opportunity to honour and celebrate the lives of those who passed at that time. I regret that I missed Dr Botterill’s memorial service on 4 March 2021, which was held on Zoom. I enjoyed my days in Chemical Engineering at Birmingham University where Dr Botterill was a member of staff and especially doing my doctorate there. While it is just over two years since his passing, I was moved to write a remembrance of his impact on my life.\n\nJohn was my supervisor during some very happy years doing my PhD in Chemical Engineering from 1969 to 1972. I owe him a great debt of gratitude for all he did for me and my career. I used to exchange Christmas cards with him and then in the last couple of years I did not receive any, so I assumed he was not doing so well. I learned from his niece that he had Alzheimer’s disease in the last year of his life. Fortunately, I enjoyed a very good chat with him by phone from the States in March 2020. Perhaps I was even one of his last students to do so. I wanted to thank him and tell him again how much he had done for me in those formative years—culminating in going to Cambridge to see Dr Davidson for my final examination of my PhD.\n\nI learned a lot under his guidance and tutelage and he was always kind and inspiring when I was down, which happened occasionally when things did not go the way I had hoped. During my first year of my PhD, the British Coal Utilization Research Association in Leatherhead (which I was working with in combined cycle fluid bed power production) went bankrupt and I was devastated. Sharing a clandestine glass of sherry in his office I said to him, “Dr John what am I to do now?” He said in very characteristic words: “John, God will provide,” and within a few weeks I had a venue to work in the department and some funding and equipment and all went well from that point on!\n\nAs a result of his early study of physics he had a slightly different take on all things chemical engineering. He had a great entourage of authors and professors around the world – \"alumni\" of the Fluidization World and he would emphasise: \"you have to appreciate what’s going on at the surface.\" He was a real pioneer in the study of the fundamentals of heat transfer at surfaces in fluid beds and I have his text book on my shelf right here. He was definitely a leading light in the field. I don’t work in quite the same field now but along the way all the principles and approaches you learn doing a PhD are invaluable and without that fundamental practice I don’t think I would be where I am today.\n\nMy wife, Ginger, really appreciated meeting Dr John on one of our trips to the UK and joins me in the spirit of this remembrance of him. He was a very fine and honourable man and is deeply missed by us and all who knew him.\n\nA tribute from Dennis Bessant (BSc Chemical Engineering, 1970; PhD Chemical Engineering, 1973)\n\nJohn Botterill was a true gentleman with a big heart. You knew he was on his way into the pilot plant bays with the clip clop of his leather brogues and his breezy gait! I was sad to hear belatedly of his passing.\n\nScholarly, visionary, ready to challenge and always driving forward. In the eras before social media, an academic who was truly connected to, and highly respected by his fellow Fluidization researchers in the UK ( Harrison, Davidson et Al) and around the world. Affectionately known to me as JSMB….over a six-year period!\n\nJSMB was my personal Tutor for the three years as a chemical engineering undergraduate (1967-70), and then my Supervisor as a postgraduate PhD student (1970-73) studying the flow of fluidised solids sponsored by the SRC, as a precursor to what became major innovations in energy storage and more efficient combustion technology. I chose research with JSMB rather than the Cambridge option because of his unique abilities to coach and challenge.\n\nHe saw me overcome personal challenges to secure a first class degree and never lost faith. I still have much memorabilia such as my experimental unit operations record books.\n\nHis favourite phrases always stay with me: \"Life is unfair and God will provide!\"\n\nTime moves on but in those days, mathematical modelling using a computer was pioneering. The computer filled a massive room in the Main Building; we used to have to punch decks of Fortran computer instruction cards and await the results with trepidation. Dennis Morgan was our very unique and amiable Technician and Fred was usually somewhere around keeping the equipment bays in good order.\n\nEarlier postgrad students of JSMB I recall were M Desai and M van der Kalk. It would be so nice if they could add their memories wherever they are now. We were all based in the very old but warm wooden shed at the back of the pilot plant bays. Always alert when we heard the footsteps of Dr John on his way to see us!\n\nFond memories of my six year collaboration with JSMB will always be with me.\n\nDavid’s impressive mane of red hair, coupled with his preferred attire of rock concert t-shirts, quickly enabled him to form a circle of like-minded friends, centred around interactions in the Lake/Wyddrington dining room.\n\nMuch of David’s down time was spent in the Guild of Students, where he enjoyed many (half) hours playing snooker in the basement or at the “Fathom” pinball machine; a popular way of wasting 10p. Lunch was usually taken upstairs in the cheekily branded 'McDocherty's' canteen (\"A Guild Grill please Lou!\"), whiling away the preparation time on the latest arcade game (Track & Field, Pole Position, and Amidar were especially popular).\n\nDavid took advantage of Birmingham's central location to visit many of the local football grounds, operating within a wide radius, which included midweek trips as far afield as Wrexham and Swindon.\n\nRegular trips were made to the city centre to browse the record shops for the latest (and classic) rock albums. After visiting the giants of the day (HMV, Virgin Megastore), if David was feeling particularly brave, he would also pay a visit to Cyclops in the Piccadilly Arcade, a store run by one of the grumpiest men in retail (They did sell huge promotional posters for the price of a couple of games of pinball though!).\n\nHe attended many rock concerts at the local venues, notably Rush, Marillion, Ozzy Osbourne, Gillan and The Enid.\n\nDavid was a co-founder of the Birmingham University Rush Appreciation Society, which brought together many fans of rock music, all of whom had to pass the intimidating three-part \"Are you a Rush fan?\" entrance examination, which went something like this:\n\n1. An easy one to start… Are you fan of the music of Rush?\n\n2. How do you pronounce the surname of Rush’s drummer, Neil Peart? [Three possible answers were offered; any answer was acceptable]\n\n3. Do you know the meaning of integrity? [The preferred (and often encouraged) response was \"No\", to be answered with a chorus of \"YOU'RE IN!\"]\n\nThis went on to become one of the least active of all university societies.\n\nIn his second and third years, David lodged in Selly Park, and was delighted to discover that he was living in the same street as his favourite lecturer, Dr Bourne; there was extra pleasure gained from the fact that David's home-town was Bourne, Lincolnshire.\n\nAfter graduating, David continued to revisit the campus at regular intervals and, like so many of us, was disappointed to have had his 35th anniversary reunion cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak. He always spoke fondly of his time at the University, sharing how he \"welled up\" every time he saw Old Joe when re-visiting – which he proudly showed off to his two daughters.\n\nDavid is fondly remembered for his cheeky humour and as a loyal friend.\n\n(Kindly written by Ian Partlett, whom David met in his first year at the University of Birmingham in 1982 and became a life-long friend)\n\nAlan was born in March 1931 in Handsworth, Birmingham to Marjorie and Fred Fell, his mum a milliner and his dad the milliners' salesman.\n\nFrom 1939 Alan stayed with a couple in the village of Aston Cantlow as an evacuee from Birmingham. He welcomed the freedom of living in the village, which instilled in him his love and learning of the countryside, work in the garden and outdoor skills.\n\nIn his writing ‘Experiences of an Evacuee from Birmingham’, he wrote of how he loved his time in the class then, as he was entrusted to read stories to the group, so teacher could be with others of such a large class. Alan had a hugely broad vocabulary and expressions which amazed his family in later years.\n\nAston Cantlow became the village his parents moved to, and became the place throughout his life that he called ‘home’. Being the place and people he loved so well.\n\n(Even on returning to the village so many years later with Rachel, on walking into the church the same organist was playing, on church he shouted down “hello Alan”, Alan shouted up to him “hello Bob”! and on he went playing where he’d left off!\n\nAs war went on, Alan was again evacuated, this time with his school Five Ways to Monmouthshire. On the train to Monmouth he met his lifelong friend Martin Lee.\n\nThe friendships he made at the University of Birmingham too became the firm friendships which affectionately became known as ‘the crowd’.\n\nAlan’s love of motoring features in all these old friends’ memories of him. He was proud to be a member of the University Motor Club amongst others.\n\nThe MG car in racing green featuring the most. Racing green remained his favourite colour always. There were many risky rallying throughout Europe with friends.\n\nNational Service - the Navy - in the Fifties took Alan on many seafaring voyages to places to Malta, Singapore, and Sri Lanka and he considered himself to be very lucky.\n\nHe relished his time there especially as the head chef duties of cooking big breakfasts for 100 hungry sailors.\n\nAlan returned to Birmingham after the Navy to join his parents in the ‘rag trade’ as it was called, managing the Fell family firm, which by then had been named Felleta Fashions (to give it some Italian flair!) .\n\nHe met Annie through dear friends Adam and Mo. Annie and Alan were happily married in 1971. His children Rachel and David were born soon after.\n\nIn London he began working in social housing in the late Sixties. Annie saw an advert and suggested it as an interim volunteer job. He began painting and decorating run down flats for Notting Hill Housing Trust. Alan ended up managing that same housing estate, to eventually become The General Secretary for the Housing Trust for 25 years.\n\nA pet hate being computers. His name for the computer was ‘the infernal machine’ and he somehow managed never to use it at work, continuing with Dictaphone and pen and paper.\n\nIn home life Alan loved to be chef and make the favourites like his paella. His memory for a good meal was astounding. The family always amused at his extraordinary food memories. Exact time and place would be recounted- “on 10 March 1962 I had the best steak with the juiciest tomato and sauce”.\n\nHe had a genuine nature of loyalty and love for his family, friends and the greater good and was much loved. As another member of this church wrote: ‘they do not come like Alan these days’!\n\nTony, as he was always known, was a Midlander through and through - there have been Barsons living in Loughborough and the surrounding villages since the 1700s. Born in Kingstanding, Birmingham, he grew up in Rugby but spent the rest of his life in the Birmingham area.\n\nIt was as a day boy at Rugby School between 1946 and 1951 that Tony developed his interest in the sciences, particularly chemistry, and his love of painting and music, including learning to play the organ. When Renown Pictures Corporation made their film version of Tom Brown’s Schooldays in summer 1950, he assisted in organising the schoolboy and town extras for the crowd scenes shot at the school and at the Denham film studios.\n\nTony was tempted to take up Renown Pictures offer of a production role in their next film ‘Scrooge’ but decided his real interest was the sciences. So in 1951 he moved to the University of Birmingham, to do a BSc in Chemistry, followed by a PhD on ‘Tracer studies in benzoyl peroxide’, supervised by Dr John Bevington. He was soon heavily involved in student affairs. He joined the Guild Theatre Group and had a variety of back stage roles in GTG’s popular productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He was the Guild of Students Treasurer in 1954/55 and Union Treasurer in 1955/56.\n\nOn completing his PhD in 1957 Tony took a post as chemistry master at Bromsgrove School, where he found that as one of the younger members of staff his duties also included supervising school rugby games on cold winter afternoons. Although he enjoyed the teaching he knew that he wanted to continue doing research – in fact he carried out some research in collaboration with the University Chemistry Department while still at Bromsgrove; this included doing laboratory work at the school.\n\nHe was thrilled to return to the University as a Senior Research Fellow in Chemistry in 1961 and was appointed to a Lectureship in 1964 and a Senior Lecturer in 1991. Tony’s teaching in the Chemistry Department was always concerned with physical chemistry, mainly kinetics, although in his later years he was asked to teach a course in X-ray crystallography, as part of an initiative to ensure that lecturers did not become jaded by teaching the same material again and again. He also lectured to the interdepartmental Radiobiology MSc course. Tony’s teaching style was thorough, well thought out, and clearly delivered, if not flamboyant.\n\nHis research interest, supported by Professors Maurice Stacey and James Robb, was polymer chemistry, for which he frequently used radioactive isotopes, usually carbon-14, to follow the course of the reactions. He published over 70 papers, many of them in cooperation with John Bevington, by then a Professor at Lancaster University.\n\nTony retained a continuing interest in the teaching of chemistry at school level and the links between schools and universities. He enjoyed giving occasional lectures to groups of schoolchildren, often in the large lecture theatre in the Haworth Building, where he liked to enliven his demonstrations with a ‘big bang’. From 1964 to 1998 he was the University’s representative on the governing body of Lichfield Friary School, and from 1969 to 1998 was involved in the Joint Matriculation Board’s A level Chemistry examinations, including the setting and marking of papers and acting as a Chief Examiner for many years.\n\nStudent days in the Union were not forgotten, as he served as the University’s representative on the Guild of Students' Union Services Committee for more than 20 years.\n\nTony’s contacts within the University were never restricted to the Chemistry Department. He felt that one of the benefits of being at the University was the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with people from other departments. In fact he made a point of not lunching with Chemistry Department colleagues. This interest in University affairs generally led to his involvement with the Association of University Teachers (AUT), then the trade union for academic staff. Between 1969 and 1981 he was successively treasurer, secretary, and finally president of the local branch.\n\nTony continued to live in Birmingham following his retirement in 1997, enjoying lunches with former colleagues in Staff House, concerts in Symphony Hall and the Town Hall, and regular holidays in Britain and Continental Europe, particularly twice yearly visits to Switzerland and many Christmases spent in Vienna.\n\nTony was twice married. Firstly in 1959 to Judy (they had two daughters, Jacki and Sue) and later to Janet. All survive him.\n\nJanet Barson and James Burdon, Retired Reader in Organic Chemistry.\n\nDenis Stanworth, retired immunochemist who spent his entire academic career at the University of Birmingham, has died aged 91. He was a major international figure in immunology and a pioneer in the study of immunoglobulin structure and function [1].\n\nDenis graduated with a degree in chemistry from the University of Birmingham, where he also earned a PhD under the head of the Department of Experimental Pathology (the late Professor John Squire). This seminal work on reagins during the 1950s [2] put him in a key position to participate in the momentous events which culminated in the discovery of IgE [3], the antibody class that mediates allergic reactions. In his lab in Birmingham, he carried out the functional characterisation of a rare myeloma protein, IgND, that was discovered in 1967 in Uppsala, Sweden, by Johansson and Bennich [4, 5]. He found that IgND could block the Prausnitz-Kustner test for reagin [6] and that this activity was mediated by the Fc fragment [7]. In 1968 the World Health Organisation named IgND and its equivalent, g, described by the Ishizakas in Denver, Colorado [8], the fifth human immunoglobulin class, IgE [9]. In the decades that followed, Denis continued his interest in the molecular pathology of IgE, describing a novel candidate vaccine peptide derived from the Ce4 domain of IgE which might be used in blocking certain allergic reactions [10].\n\nEarly in his career, Denis spent a year working in Ed Franklin’s lab in New York, where he raised antisera against paraproteins which were capable for the first time of distinguishing the then known classes of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA) immunochemically [11]. He often referred fondly to his time there and to the thrill of seeing Kennedy’s run for the presidency and Martin Luther King Jr. preach at a local church. During the 1970s and 1980s, Denis published extensively on human IgG subclasses (particularly IgG4) and his interests expanded into the biology and functions of immunoglobulin-interacting cells, especially mast cells, macrophages and B-cells. He also developed broad interests and expertise in the role of rheumatoid factors and how these elements contributed to the development of rheumatoid arthritis. He forged a strong friendship and research collaboration with the late Hungarian immunologist Janos Gergely, with whom he pursued his research interest in Fcg receptors. He often spoke of his visits to Budapest, where he also enjoyed listening to the sound of violin over dinner!\n\nDenis enjoyed travelling abroad and did so widely, often as a keynote speaker at international conferences. His lab in Birmingham was a magnet for young and seasoned immunologists from all over the world and he would normally have a dozen nationalities represented in his lab at any one time. He was very inclusive and would always bring his distinguished visitors into the lab for a chat with staff and PhD students. He was also a great believer in the social dimension of being part of a research community. Through his numerous friendships he advanced science; forging productive research collaborations across diverse scientific and medical specialties. There was always excitement, energy and a new discovery to hear about and enjoy. Denis had a defining and lasting impact on the careers of many immunologists around the world, including us. We were all PhD students of Denis’s and like many of his postgraduate students (around 80 in total) we owe Denis an immense debt of gratitude for his guidance and advice, for the rich research discipline he instilled in us and for the continuing friendship we shared over several decades.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the University of Birmingham, Denis set up Peptide Therapeutics Ltd in Cambridge, where he and his team continued their work on his novel anti-allergy peptide vaccine. In the late 1990s, he was awarded a special professorship by the University of Nottingham in recognition of his exceptional and long-standing contribution to the science of immunology; in particular to our understanding of allergies. He was a prolific author and a member of numerous national and international immunology organizations and committees. He was active in the Medical Research Council (London), the World Health Organization (Geneva) and the Royal College of Pathologists (London). Denis spent his retirement years in his beloved Malvern, Worcestershire and was an avid listener to the music of its famous son, the English composer Sir Edward Elgar. Denis will be sorely missed by his family and friends. His wife Barbara passed away in 2013 and he is survived by his two daughters, Deborah and Sarah, and four grandchildren, David and Elizabeth, and Daniel and Francesca.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

His grandfather, William Rathbone Pashley, was the founder of WR Pashley Cycles Ltd, the company specialising in making hand-built traditional bicycles, which is still based in Stratford-upon-Avon today. In the late 1950s the family and the factory relocated to Stratford, where Bill enjoyed a rural childhood. He attended King Edward Vl Grammar School (Shakespeare's alma mater) from 1963 to 1970.\n\nThough Bill always excelled at academic and intellectual subjects, he showed an early talent for \"hands on\" practical activities such as creating stage sets and lighting for school plays, also building mechanical games for school fetes. He struck up a great rapport with his physics master, the legendary Denis Dyson who was on the same inventive wavelength. At 18 Bill gained distinctions in all his A-level exams: general studies, mathematics, physics and chemistry and the physics special paper. He decided to take a degree in civil engineering at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1971, where he attained a Double First in 1974.\n\nBill always appreciated the good things in life - fine wine, gourmet food, classical music - and while he was at Cambridge he practised his skills as a talented cook. With other students he formed a small dining club, where Bill cooked Cordon Bleu dishes over two gas rings at the accommodation they shared. During one long summer vacation Bill and a group of university friends set off in a battered Landrover to Turkey, travelling overland via Eastern Europe. Bill became the camp cook, using fresh local ingredients acquired along the way. It was a bonding experience which led to lifelong friendships being formed that were to last all his days.\n\nAfter university Bill joined John Laing, the firm of building contractors, and assisted in the management of building projects in south-east England, Wales. and the north of Scotland. In 1977 he was transferred for six months to the offices of Atkins, the well-known design company, where he worked on plans for a new Teesside blast furnace. It was during his time in the North East that he met his future wife Jennifer (nee Roberts) a schoolteacher. They were married in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1980, and enjoyed a long and happy marriage of forty years.\n\nHome became a sixteenth century thatched cottage in Welford-upon-Avon when Bill decided to bring his engineering skills to use in running the family business in Stratford. On his father's retirement he became the managing director of WR Pashley Ltd. During his years in Stratford Bill became a leading light in Stratford Manufacturers Association, and was approached to serve as a Justice of the Peace on the Stratford bench. He enjoyed these years of serving the community in Stratford very much, and held the position of JP throughout his time in the town.\n\nOne of Bill's interests had always been in the conservation and restoration of historic properties. He was a lifelong member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, and he and Jennifer set out to repair and restore their Grade II listed thatched cottage using traditional materials. On one memorable occasion Bill even made his own wattle and daub to mend\n\na wall, going out into the fields to gather cow pats to mix into the daub to bind it, just as a Tudor builder would have done. It worked very effectively! He also became a keen gardener, creating an Elizabethan cottage garden to complement the character of the house.\n\nWR Pashley then acquired another company named Spencer Manufacturing, which produced components for the cycle industry, so Bill moved west to the Shropshire/Worcestershire border where the factory was based, to be its managing director. Home became a shepherd's cottage in the idyllic countryside of Wenlock Edge. Again Bill and Jennifer devoted their spare time to returning the property to its original 18th century character, seeking out vernacular materials, local stone and recycled timber.\n\nBecause of his lifelong interest in historic buildings, Bill made the decision to return to college to study the subject, so in 1995 he embarked on a degree course in Heritage Management at Birmingham Universiry while based at home in South Shropshire. After being awarded the degree he was quickly offered a position by the National Trust as Property Manager\n\nof Saltram House and its lands near Plymouth in Devon. So Bill, Jennifer and their six hens all relocated to live in a whitewashed cottage made of cob on the edge of Dartmoor. This was another delightful area to explore and to discover the charms of Devon's beaches and ancient market towns.\n\nAfter a few years of running the mansion, gardens and lands at Saltram, Bill set his sights on a larger National Trust property and moved on to manage Wallington Hall, its large estate and numerous tenant farms in North Northumberland. Together with Jennifer they bought an ancient stone cottage in the Northumberland National Park, high in the north Pennines, and two miles away from any road or the nearest neighbour. With the cottage came six acres of moorland with a stream, which attracted the most amazing variety of wildlife. Heron fished there, curlew called, skylarks nested in the heather, and adders could be seen basking in the sun.\n\nThe downside was the harsh winter climate, which often meant being snowed in. On one unforgettable morning they opened the front door to find a complete wall of snow totally blocking the entrance. They finally managed to dig themselves out after being snowed in for ten days. Dargues Hope with its six acres offered the opportunity to take up a new hobby as smallholders, and the couple soon acquired some rescue animals to stock it: geese, hens and four ewes. Their number soon became six after an impatient ram barged through the fence, resulting in one of the ewes producing twin lambs.\n\nThen in 2001 Wallington Estate with its 13,000 acres of farmland found itself in the midst of the worst agricultural catastrophe in decades: the national epidemic of foot and mouth disease in sheep and cattle. Wallington was soon hit, and within two days a brigade of army marksmen were brought in to slaughter the animals. Soon 300 cattle and 800 sheep were burned on a vast pyre which lasted for five days and could be seen from seven miles away. The carnage continued throughout the spring and summer, the mansion and gardens were closed to the public for months; but Bill earned love and respect from his staff and local farmers for his managerial skills, commitment and compassion in steering everyone through this time of horror.\n\nAt the age of 50 in 2002 Bill accepted the post of Operations Manager at Tate St Ives, the prestigious art gallery in Cornwall, which meant relocating to the opposite end of the country. He was always excited by the prospect of a new job challenge, but at this time he began to experience the first symptoms of multiple sclerosis soon after he commenced running the famous art gallery. He battled with its ever-worsening effects for the next 17 years, becoming ever more disabled, and though wheelchair-bound he continued to work in his very responsible position until the age of 60, when he retired.\n\nAt the time he received an enormous number of accolades for his contribution to the development of the Gallery and Barbara Hepworth Sculpture Garden. In a handwritten tribute the then director of the Tate Gallery in London, Sir Nicholas Serota, expressed his appreciation to Bill for the dedication, skill and stability he had brought to the Gallery which ensured its success.\n\nSadly Bill was not able to enjoy a long retirement, as his illness became increasingly advanced, and he died at the age of 67 from pneumonia, a complication arising from MS. It is a measure of the man that it was his wish to donate his body for MS research, to help find a cure for this devastating illness.\n\nJennifer Pashley\n\nJoan began life in Queensbury, a small village in the West Riding of Yorkshire that is home of the Black Dyke Mills and geographically, one of the highest parishes in England. The only one of her siblings to be born there, her father’s armed forces posting had obliged her parents to move away from London but she always had a Yorkshire woman’s no-nonsense approach to life. The youngest of eight, she was not a strong child and doctors had expressed concern about her long-term health prospects but the Lodge family were made of sterner stuff; she was to live for 99 years.\n\nFrom an early age, she showed signs of remarkable intellect despite her physical limitations. When her sister Florrie started school at the age of five, Joan (two years younger) wanted to go as well. The local school accepted her and thus began an outstanding scholastic evolution. She won a place at Thornton Grammar School, on the outskirts of Bradford, where she excelled in all subjects but particularly, classics and languages in which, throughout her grammar school education, she was awarded prizes every year.\n\nIn order to get to school each day, Joan had to walk down a steep hill to the Queensbury Railway Station and catch a train to Thornton. This wasn’t so bad, she said, but the walk back up the hill with all her schoolbooks at the end of the day was tiring for a girl of small stature and sometimes, naughty boys would steal her satchel and run off with it, leaving it to be recovered from nearby bushes. One day, one of the older boys from the school who travelled the same route saw this happen, chased the younger boys off and thereafter, took on the role of informal protector and carried her satchel up the hill for her every afternoon – she wasn’t teased again after that!\n\nShe matriculated with distinction at thirteen but remained in school until she entered Birmingham University in 1938. She was supported through her grammar school years and degree by her older sisters, Amy and Maud, who worked in the Black Dyke Mills to ensure that there were funds for her to benefit from the best education possible. Their sacrifices were amply repaid as she graduated in June 1941 with an excellent upper second Batchelor of Arts Honours degree in French Language and Literature.\n\nShe was a lifelong member of Birmingham’s University House Society and remained in contact with friends from those days until she was in her final years.\n\nJoan’s university career took place against a backdrop of hardship and then, two years before she graduated, W.W.II broke out. This prevented her from spending time studying her subject at first hand whilst an undergraduate but when the war was over, she went to Paris where she spent an extremely enjoyable year teaching at the Collège Franco-Brittanique and taking classes at the Sorbonne, where her knowledge of French, Latin and Greek were a necessary prerequisite. Displaying a previously unsuspected talent, she also joined ‘The English Players’, with whom she gave her Olivia in Twelfth Night - or ‘Le Nuit des Rois’, as the programme has it - at venues across Paris.\n\nUpon her return, she joined the teaching profession and committed her life to the education of a new generation. For Joan, teaching was a vocation and this dedication set the pace and tenor for the rest of her life.\n\nAmongst her teaching posts in England, she was Senior Mistress at Upper Chine School on the Isle of Wight, where three of her married sisters had settled in the 1940’s and where she returned regularly to visit them.\n\nIn 1961, she left Upper Chine to take up her last full-time position at another independent boarding school for girls, Braeside School in Buckhurst Hill, Essex. Appointed by the school founder as the first Headmistress, her life and times at Braeside were very happy. She always said that before her marriage, she had hundreds of daughters and she set high standards for them to aspire to whilst running a well-disciplined establishment.\n\nShe was introduced to her late husband, John, a widower, through a friend of the family and they married in 1968. Joan left her beloved Braeside at the end of the school year and moved into her husband’s home in Trowbridge, Wiltshire where they enjoyed 32 years of happy married life together.\n\nOnce married, she semi-retired but regularly provided supply cover at the Trowbridge Boys’ High School, which was next door to her new home and, until it closed in 1980, the Fitzmaurice Grammar School in Bradford-on-Avon, where the pupils must have thought her part of the family whose name it bore.\n\nBefore their marriage, John was an active member of the Rotarians and Joan entered into the life of the local, national and international Rotary movement with the same enthusiasm and flair as she showed for all her chosen pursuits. After being heavily involved in the Trowbridge Inner Wheel, serving in several committee positions as well as District Chair and member of the National Committee, Joan became the National President of the Association of Inner Wheel Clubs of Great Britain in 1990.\n\nTogether they travelled the world as GB&I ambassadors for Rotary and Inner Wheel in addition to taking some adventurous holidays on far-flung continents. Joan always returned home with a wealth of new experiences and stories to share, including, after a European trip, how her Latin and Greek had served her well in communicating with local people in Italy and Greece – not a problem she ever had when travelling in France!\n\nIn her new domestic role, she became a very accomplished cook and enjoyed the opportunities that the Rotary and Inner Wheel clubs offered to entertain and to host charity events. With a large garden now at her disposal, she and John together managed it to produce an impressive selection of both vegetables and blooms, the latter used often for another of her skills - flower arranging.\n\nAlready a skilful seamstress, she shone when faced with the annual challenge of the Inner Wheel carnival float, designing and making accurate period costumes that ranged in time from the Tudors to the ‘20’s. She also joined an embroidery class and found that she both enjoyed and excelled at this creative hobby, creating work that won her both plaudits and prizes. On acquiring a knitting machine, she extended her abilities further and was self-taught, producing lovely pieces for herself, John and other family members as well as supporting the various Fayres and sales connected to her charitable interests.\n\nJoan’s involvement with Holy Trinity Church was very important to her during her years in Trowbridge. She was, with John, a regular member of the congregation and served as Lay Vice Chairman of the Parochial Church Council. Such was her commitment to the Grade II* listed building that she successfully applied to charities, trusts and the Heritage Lottery Fund, raising thousands of pounds for essential repairs and securing the future of the stained glass windows, in particular two in the North Transept Wall that were made by Morris & Co., Westminster and dedicated in 1938.\n\nFollowing John’s death in 2000, her social circle gradually dwindled and she moved to a co-housing apartment Wokingham in 2006 to be nearer her niece Margaret, to whom she was particularly close, and her stepson Jonathan. Sadly, after a few years her health had deteriorated and in 2009 she moved to assisted living in Weybridge and latterly, in East Molesey. Although in her final months she often found it challenging to find the right words in her native language, she was able to articulate her views in French, a linguist to the very end.\n\nShe has outlived all of her siblings, though her sisters all lived well into their 90th decade, and leaves behind two stepchildren, Jonathan and Angela, three grandchildren and two great grandchildren as well as nieces and nephews from her own family. She was a significant influence in shaping many lives and her presence will be sadly missed.\n\nJon Fitzmaurice OBE\n\nStepson\n\nProfessor Garth Hastings was one of the early pioneers in the field of biomaterials science. He made significant breakthroughs in a number of areas, in particular in the development and uses of bioceramics, carbon fibre, polymers and titanium.\n\nHis book with Bernard Bloch, Plastics in Medicine, published in 1969, was the first in this field. He went on to author more than 200 publications in the field of biomaterials science. He also published several books, including the Handbook of Biomaterial Properties with Jonathan Black.\n\nHe was the founding editor of the journal Biomaterials which grew to become the most important European journal in the field and was on the editorial board of the Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, the world leading journal.\n\nProfessor Hastings was born in Portsmouth in 1932. He spent a peripatetic childhood during the war years, moving from Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight, Newbury, Cleethorpes and Chandlers Ford, where he recalled senior military officers poring over maps planning for D-day in a room of the roadhouse run by his parents. One of the other guests was Sydney Camm, the designer of the Hurricane fighter plane.\n\nFollowing the war, the family settled in Darlington where his mother and father bought and ran a transport café on the Great North Road. An inquisitive child, always looking to learn from the world around him, the young Garth Hastings attended the King James I Grammar School in Bishop Auckland where his love of science grew, in particular Chemistry.\n\nIn 1953 he gained a place at Birmingham to study Chemistry, the first in his family to go to university. Following his first degree, he was awarded a PhD at Birmingham, working on polymers under the guidance of Sir Harry Melville – he was awarded a DSc from the University in 1980.\n\nOn leaving university, he moved to London, working as a science officer at the Ministry of Aviation and living in Chingford. It was there he met and married his wife Theresa in 1958.\n\nIn 1961, they moved to Australia where Garth was appointed senior lecturer in chemistry, specialising in polymers, at the University of New South Wales. It was here that his focus on biomaterials began to develop and flourish.\n\nHis academic career took him far and wide. He was visiting Professor at the Twente University in Holland and Karlsruhe University, Germany. On return from Australia to the UK in 1972 he became Head of the Bioengineering Unit at Staffordshire University and Professor of Biomedical Engineering. He then became Senior Fellow in the Department of Materials. He also became Associate Director of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Biomedical Materials at Queen Mary & Westfield College, at the University of London. He became a Visiting Professor in Bioengineering at Strathclyde University. In 1995, he became Visiting Professor at the National University of Singapore and Director of Biomaterials in the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering.\n\nIn 1975 he became a consultant for UNIDO for medical uses of materials. For more than 25 years he worked on numerous projects and programmes in China, Hong Kong, Laos, Cambodia and Mongolia, where he and his wife were awarded honorary citizenship.\n\nFor over 30 years he was involved in standards for medical materials and devices, actively driving work in this area. He was an inaugural member of the Australian Standards Association and was involvement with BSI and ISO on surgical implants for 25 years, chairing the BSI committee for a number of years and leading the UK implant delegation to ISO for 10 years.\n\nHe was President of the Biological Engineering Society for two years and represented them on the Parliamentary & Scientific Committee and a committee of the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\nHe passionately believed in the importance of sharing knowledge and that science advances through the open exchange of research, ideas and information. It was a passion that took him around the world to host and contribute to conferences, bringing people together to spark ideas and explore new avenues of research in the quest to find solutions to challenges in biomaterials science.\n\nThough he loved travel, he was more than just a visitor. He immersed himself in and developed deep and abiding connections with the people, culture and values of the many countries where he visited, worked in and lived. He was driven by a curiosity about the world and its people, and a hunger to learn about and experience new things.\n\nThroughout his life he was guided by a deep faith. He took a degree in theology in 1967 while in Australia and became a lay preacher. He always believed there was an intimate relationship between his passion for scientific exploration and learning and his Christian faith.\n\nIn 2010, Professor Hastings was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and his health gradually started to deteriorate as the condition developed. He died peacefully on 3 March 2019 surrounded by his family. He is survived by his wife Theresa, their four children, six grandchildren and two great grandchildren.\n\nProfessor Sidney Alan Barker as I remember him - Dr Syed Amir (DPhil Chemistry, 1963)\n\nI arrived at Birmingham in the autumn of 1960 from Karachi Pakistan to pursue graduate studies in Chemistry, a wide-eyed young man who had never set foot out of his country before. It was a gloomy, cold day, archetypal of fall da ys in the English Midlands. A graduate student from the Chemistry Department had earlier picked me up at Snow Hill Station and gave me some helpful directions how to get to my bed-and-breakfast place where I had found temporary lodging.\n\nThe following day, I found my way to the Chemistry Department and to the Hills Extension building. The Haworth building was still under construction. Professor Maurice Stacey, the then head of the department, a kindly-looking gentleman, had his office on the second floor and greeted me warmly. He took me to meet Dr. Barker who had his office and laboratory on the ground floor. Dr. Barker was to be my Ph.D. advisor. A relatively young man, I noticed his laboratory was a busy place, where some six or seven students were working on their research projects. Especially reassuring to me was the fact that among them three were foreign students, much like me. In time, I got to know all of them, and they proved very helpful in guiding me during my early initiation phase in the academic customs and practices of the department.\n\nBarker, a senior lecturer at the time, followed a strict routine. Once every week, he would talk to his students individually in his office for about an hour or so, reviewing the results from the previous week and setting some kind of research agenda for the following week. After that, he did not hang over their heads, pressing for new results. He had a very fertile mind, as I discovered during my weekly sessions, as in a short time he would come up with many suggestions about how to pursue a given line of research. In my lengthy research career in England and later in the USA, I can hardly think of another investigator who was so original and creative in his/her thinking.\n\nHe arrived in the laboratory usually very early in the morning, so early that I never recall not seeing him when I arrived about 8am. He left punctually at five in the afternoon and rarely stayed late. He always bid me cheerio on his way home as he passed by my bench. In those days, there was no direct phone lines to call an outside number and all calls went through a university operator. There was only one public telephone booth in the department, was operated by insertion of coins and was mostly busy. Besides, there was one other telephone that was located in Barker’s office. Nobody used it until he had gone home for the day.\n\nEver year Dr. Barker had a Christmas party at his house for his research team, with an abundance of food and drinks. His team looked forward to it eagerly. He was especially mindful of foreign students in his group who had nothing to do at this time and felt lonely, so he invited me and a few others at his house on the Boxing Day. Usually, on this occasion, his mother and mother-in-law were also present, and I recall it as a joyful occasion in a relaxed and unhurried environment. He loved music and often played piano at home.\n\nThe Barker laboratory had an eclectic, cosmopolitan milieu where investigators drawn from different countries came to learn and sometime teach specific techniques. At one time, we had a galaxy of students from the USA (John Willard), Norway (Miss Erickson), Lebanon (Shibli Bayyuk), Venezuela, Iraq, Pakistan. An interesting case was of Mrs. Grace Pardo, who having spent years with her husband managing tea plantations in Assam (India) returned to England, came out of retirement to work on her Ph.D. In those days, we seldom called people by their first names, unless we knew them very well. So, she was always known as Mrs. Pardo. She completed her doctoral degree and I am not sure what she did afterwards.\n\nDr. Barker’s research interests had been evolving from basic carbohydrate chemistry to life sciences and biochemistry. I completed my PhD in 1963 in chemistry, but then he guided me as a postdoctoral fellow to move in the direction of endocrinology. I refocused on studying the chemistry of follicle-stimulating hormone, one of the hormones essential for human fertility. This work was conducted in collaboration with investigators at Women’s Hospital where all the animal testing was performed. Dr. Barker became interested in this work and he often drove me to the hospital to have meeting with our collaborators, Dr. A.C. Crooke and Prof. Wilfred Butt. It was an opportunity for us to talk one to one, away from the laboratory and in an informal atmosphere. My move to endocrinology was a lucky break as it opened an entirely new and thriving field to me, enabling me to continue my work in the USA in this area.\n\nDr. Barker was naturally a shy person, especially when meeting with strangers. He was occasionally invited by his overseas students to their national day dinners in the Student’s Union. He always came with Ruth, his first wife. While she was a confident guest, Barker felt a little awkward amidst strangers, but after he had a drink or two, he relaxed and then enjoyed the evening, socializing with others.\n\nI was associated with him for six years, a relatively long time, and he felt at ease with me. At one time when he was away to the US on a lecture tour, he asked me to open all his official mail and to respond if needed. His primary interest was his research and he had no hobbies that I knew. At one time, he was diagnosed with high blood pressure and advised to relax and not be so preoccupied with his academic work. He forced himself to take some time off in the afternoons for a round of golf. Occasionally, he would ask me to accompany him in the afternoon for a cup of tea in the newly opened staff house. He later seems to have found a new hobby and got very interested applying his well-horned investigative skills in tracing records of his family history. I left his laboratory in 1966 for a position in Pakistan.\n\nIn 1969, on my way from Pakistan to Los Angeles to take up a research position, I made a brief stopover in Birmingham, where my wife’s parents lived, and had a short meeting with Dr. Barker who was in the middle of some conference. He had been promoted to full professor by then and was due to proceed to USA on some teaching and research project. This was my last meeting with him.\n\nWhen I visited the chemistry department again in 2000, it had changed so much that it was hard to recognize it. The old Fluorine research building had disappeared as had the adjacent undergraduate teaching laboratory. I stopped by my old laboratory in the Hills’ extension where I had spent six enjoyable and productive years. There was a busy new crop of young students, reminding me of my own days some 40 years ago. No one among them, however, knew Alan Barker or even recognized the name. How ephemeral is the nature of fame and celebrity? I mused.\n\nThe English conductor, composer and arranger Alan Abbott has died at his home in Birmingham at the age of 91. Specialising in opera and ballet, his conducting engagements took him across the globe, including appointments in Turkey, Australia and Scandinavia. His most famous piece, Alla caccia for French horn and piano, has become a staple of the recital repertoire; he also worked on the score for Les Misérables and the ballet of The Merry Widow.\n\nBorn in Birmingham in 1926, Abbott’s initial musical training was with the pianist Joyce Chandler. His studies were interrupted by war service with the Royal Air Force, beginning in London: this enabled him to attend Sir Thomas Beecham’s 1946 Delius festival, which inspired a lifelong love of this composer. After being transferred to Canada, Abbott taught himself to read orchestral scores during the breaks between flying training sessions on Avro Ansons.\n\nOn returning to the University of Birmingham, he was awarded the gold medal and Barber Trust scholarship in the final year of his music degree. This enabled him to move to the Royal College of Music in London, where he studied orchestration with Gordon Jacob, French horn with Frank Probyn and conducting with Richard Austin. He composed Alla caccia in 1949, when one of his colleagues realised on the day before her final concert that she had overlooked the requirement to include in her programme both a piece from the twentieth century and one by a British composer. Abbott generously rose to meet this challenge on both counts.\n\nPractical music making always held the greatest appeal for him. Although he began a teacher training course at the University of Reading, his increasing commitments as a performer in London led to a conducting position with the Carl Rosa touring opera company. This was followed by a spell in the West End, conducting musicals and operetta and composing incidental music. In 1958–9, he conducted the Royal Ballet on a tour of Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAbbott was employed for several years as a producer in the BBC Light Music Department, working with the BBC Concert Orchestra and colleagues such as Stanford Robinson and Vilem Tausky. In 1965, he accepted an invitation to become Music Director of Turkish Ballet and resident conductor at the Ankara Opera House.\n\nAbbott moved to Australia in 1971, becoming resident conductor of Australian Ballet and, five years later later, musical director of Western Australian Opera. With the Western Australian Arts Orchestra, he made several opera recordings as well as initiating a series of performances called Opera In Concert, for which he acted as compère. Under his leadership, attendances at the Perth Concert Hall reached a remarkable 95–98% capacity each season.\n\nReturning to the United Kingdom in 1979, Abbott continued to be in demand as an arranger. He collaborated with Peter Washtell on the score for the musical Les Misérables and undertook numerous joint projects with John Lanchbery, including a ballet version of The Merry Widow and editions of the ballets of Léon Minkus. For almost two decades, Abbott was regularly engaged in Scandinavia, conducting the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, the Royal Swedish Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet. Many of these concerts were televised. He also appeared as a guest conductor with the Paris Opera Ballet.\n\nAbbott made a number of recordings, including two discs of piano music with the London Symphony Orchestra and the pianist Guy Saint-­‐Clair and the soundtrack for the 1995 revival of The Iron Horse silent film. Warmly regarded by all those with whom he worked, Abbott continued in his latter years to sustain the many friendships he had developed across the world. He was generous in supporting other musicians and always had a fund of stories and anecdotes from his varied career.\n\nIn 2011, Abbott was awarded a pension from the Civil List for services to music. Despite increasing ill health, he was able to continue living in his family home in south Birmingham thanks to devoted care from friends. He was predeceased by his lifetime partner, the tenor Lazarus Gerald Stern (‘Larry’), in 2016.\n\nKarl cared. His passions shaped his being and his image. He thought deeply and sought intellectual understanding. He was an atheist who respected religious ceremony, a republican who hoped to get a royal telegram at 100. He was a socialist, but admired politicians at every level and of every hue who were true to their ideals, clear and accountable. He was an aficionado of art, music, opera, theatre, crosswords, wine and whisky, devotions all shared with Rosaleen, his wife of 53 years, and of books, although she wasn’t so keen on living in a library. Most of all, Karl was an individual who cared that everything should be just so, and he was determined to do everything possible to make it so.\n\nKarl grew up in Ibstock, Leicestershire, surrounded by the power of words. His parish clerk father Harry ran the family printing business. His mother Louise’s cousin Bernard Newman wrote over 100 books. Authors DH Lawrence and Mary Anne Evans (George Eliot) were distant relations. His ambition to be a journalist was explored in school vacations on the local newspaper, The Coalville Times, and in editing magazines and taking an English degree at The University of Birmingham (BSc English, circa 1949) only for illness to thwart his becoming a graduate trainee with Lord Kemsley (of Dropmore), owner of The Sunday Times. Instead, he made his mark in the book trade, initially at a wholesaler where he recommended the acquisition of Casino Royale, Ian Fleming’s first James Bond novel; it sold 18,000 hardback copies in a year.\n\nIn 1953, Karl went to the Bahamas to run The Island Bookshop. Perfect climate. Idyllic lifestyle. Then it got better. While directing See How They Run, he fell in love with the leading lady: Rosaleen Malone, a pioneer BOAC air hostess who later “looked fabulous” in Three Sisters. They married in 1965 and headed home for him to aid André Deutsch doing paperback publishing deals before managing systems, computers and operations as Granada Publishing was acquired by Collins which merged to be HarperCollins. If he couldn’t get his way with charm and persistent logic, he would ruffle feathers – including those of Robert Maxwell on a Parliamentary committee considering worldwide academic copyright. He drove the development of International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN), led UK implementation of machine readable codes, foresaw e-books, was a trustee of HarperCollins pension fund and ‘Mr Fixit’ for media moguls Sidney Bernstein and Rupert Murdoch.\n\nRosaleen and Karl brought baby Roisin (MSc Applied Geophysics, 1992) to the village of Taplow, Buckinghamshire in 1969. Their son Ronan arrived two years later. They have immersed themselves in the Taplow village community ever since. An incurable lung condition didn’t stop him running the church fete bookstall for years, helping create Taplow at the Millennium (A. Forsyth), providing advice and editing for Taplow Moments (N. Smales), joining the Village Preservation Society’s committee in 2003 and acting as its energetic chairman for five years from 2011.\n\nOpinions? He had a few. Disagreements? Yes, but never disrespect. The game was less persuasion than performance of principles, knowledge and indulgent eloquence. His was valuable counsel. However, of all Karl’s achievements, perhaps most important are the fond memories of his family and lifelong friends who knew “a lovely man”. Rosaleen married him because “He was the kindest man I’d ever met”. What better epitaphs could he have? Karl is survived by; Rosaleen Lawrence, his wife of 53 years. Roisin Lakings, nee Lawrence (MSc 1992 Applied Geophysics) his daughter and her family in Denver, Colorado. Ronan Lawrence, his son and his family in Wiltshire and Clark Lawrence, his son in Ventura, California.\n\nMy mother, Diana Wallace, who studied for a Diploma in Social Studies at the University of Birmingham from 1943-1945, has died at the age of 92. After graduating she became a social worker, taking up her first post with the Family Welfare Association in Camberwell, one of the most severely bomb-damaged London boroughs. This was the first of many such positions: she remained active in the field in both a professional and voluntary capacity throughout the rest of her life.\n\nDiana was born in Exeter in 1924 to architect John Sidey and his wife Florence (née Brinsmead). The youngest of a close-knit family of two brothers and four sisters, she forged many lifelong friendships at St Margaret’s School, Exeter, where she eventually became Head Girl. As a teenager she developed her Christian faith, which gave her life its foundations and values, and sustained her through the good times and the tough.\n\nDiana was the only one of her siblings not to join the forces during the war; instead, she enrolled for the Diploma in Social Studies. During this period, she lived and worked with some of the poorest residents of the city at the Birmingham Settlement on Summer Lane. This independent agency is committed to a range of projects aimed at combating poverty and social deprivation. Her memories of this period included not only the familiar student tales of late-night discussions with friends, but also vivid accounts of bombing raids on the city’s munitions factories. Diana counted her time in Birmingham as life-changing, opening her eyes to levels of social inequality and injustice that had remained out of sight to a girl of her background growing up in Exeter. Together, she and I met up in Birmingham a few years ago to visit the recently opened National Trust museum in the old back-to-back houses on Hurst Street. This was the kind of housing she had encountered in the Summer Lane area during the war, and her recollections brought the place to life for me.\n\nAfter moving to London for her first job, she met Ralph Hinds, a solicitor, whom she married in 1952. After the birth of their first child, they left the smog and cramped spaces of the city for the clean air and wide beaches of Bournemouth, where Diana lived for the rest of her life. She soon began to attend St Alban’s Church, where she remained a valued member of the congregation, church committees and projects for over fifty years. She served as Chairman of the Bournemouth Council for Voluntary Services and was the founding Chairman of James Michael House, which provided accommodation and support for vulnerable women and their children. Professionally, she became one of the key social workers for the Wel-Care association in the Diocese of Winchester, founding its Bournemouth branch. Her achievements were recognised by an MBE in 1993.\n\nDiana married her second husband, retired teacher John Wallace, in 1992. Together they enjoyed an active retirement: he was a talented wood-worker, while she was an expert and highly knowledgeable gardener, tending flowers, fruit and vegetables with equal success. They travelled widely, continuing their caravanning holidays in France well into their 80s.\n\nDiana died peacefully in Bournemouth hospital after a short illness. During her last weeks she received many visits from family and friends, her deep pleasure in the people who filled her life remaining to the end. She was predeceased by John by a week, and is survived by my brother Nigel and me, her stepdaughter Sue, her grandchildren Freddie, Anna and Rosamund, and great-granddaughter Isabelle.\n\nHilary Hinds\n\n28 March 2017\n\n(BSc Metallurgy, 1946; PhD, 1949)\n\nTrevor Churchman was born on 13 March 1926 in Birmingham, his father Arthur (MSc Biochemistry, 1921) also a Birmingham graduate.\n\nTrevor was educated at King Edwards School, Birmingham. He went into the Science 6th form being influenced by Commander Langley, his chemistry master, who by coincidence had been Trevor’s father’s Commanding Officer in Naval research in WW1. Trevor’s sights had been set on Dartmouth and a career in the Navy.\n\nTrevor won a state scholarship and moved onto Birmingham to read Metallurgy. There Professor Alan Cottrell (later Sir Alan) became his mentor and friend. He was also one of Hugh’s (eldest son) Godfather. Trevor took a 1st class Hons Degree, then a PhD and was Research Fellow at the University for 2 years.\n\nIn 1950 he married June (BSc Mathematics, 1948). He joined Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) Research laboratory at Aldermaston Court. The Research Director was Dr. Edward Alibone who encouraged and befriended his young protégé. There Trevor started to unravel the structures and mechanical properties of Titanium and Rhenium. He ‘grew’ the first titanium single crystals; the report and discussion of which became the first of his papers published by the Royal Society. Developmental work at Cambridge by a husband and wife team followed.\n\nSir Alan asked Trevor to be one of this interdisciplinary research team out of Harwell (solving the problems of radiation damage in steel vessels) to help prepare and design experiments he felt needed to be done and so Trevor was seconded to Harwell from AEI. After some exciting developments, the cause of the problems was identified and Sir Alan produced the theoretical reasoning behind the phenomena.\n\nTrevor was invited to join the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) as Head of Materials Division of the newly proposed Berkley Nuclear laboratories in Gloucestershire. Their task was to make civil nuclear energy economic.\n\nTrevor became the Director of new research facility Electricity Council Research Centre (ECRC), having the task of looking at the wider and wiser uses of electricity.\n\nThe privatisation of power generation and the distribution of electricity supply sounded the end of the visionary research centre in its original form. Yet by then Trevor had retired for a Consultancy role, having seen the Centre through 21+ years.\n\nThe move to ECRC meant a move to Wales for the family. Worship at St Asaph Cathedral became the centre of Trevor’s spiritual life and both June and Trevor were involved there. Trevor was a member of the Governing Body of the Church in Wales for 15 years.\n\nHe was tremendous support to June (who died in 2009) in her work in Guiding and the National Lottery Charities Board.\n\nHe was a generous and loving father, father-in-law, grandfather and great-grandfather and a generous supporter of the work of the Churches.\n\nDied 6th August 2014\n\nHe will be much missed.\n\nAlthough born in England, Jim Gordon’s early years were spent in India, Burma and China where his father Captain Bryan Gordon (RIN) held a naval commission. After prep school in England he joined King Williams College on the Isle of Man, and later graduated in Aeronautical Engineering at Loughborough College, Leicestershire in 1948. He then joined AVRoe and worked in aerodynamic research in wind tunnels. He contributed significantly to the design and development of the remarkable range of advanced aircraft that were emerging from the dynamic aircraft industry of the 1950s and 1960s. He later worked with Handley Page Ltd, Armstrong-Whitworth and Rolls Royce Derby.\n\nThe government was reluctant to continue backing aircraft production in the mid 1960s as it was inherently costly. However, as aircraft production was fundamentally involved in pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge, this led to the collapse of the national aerospace industry. Research teams were disbanded and many highly skilled engineers went overseas. However, Jim Gordon decided to re-direct his engineering skills into production engineering and joined the University of Birmingham in 1965. He completed a Master's Degree in Engineering Production and then joined the University’s lecturing staff. In 1975, he was awarded a PhD for his research into Project Management, which was emerging as an important production technique. In 1976-77 he became Visiting Professor at the University of North Carolina at Raleigh and subsequently lectured throughout the USA. Later he served as External Examiner at University of Cranfield (1994-98) and at University of Wales Aberystwyth (1999-2003).\n\nAlongside his responsibilities as Director of Postgraduate Courses in the Department for Engineering Production at the University of Birmingham, Jim Gordon served with BSI (British Standards Institution). Here he helped to set up, and chaired, the BSI Committee on Project Management MS/2, responsible for the Standard BS 6079-1, 2, 3. Following the success of this initiative, he was invited to join the ISO (International Organisation for Standardization). He became Convenor of the ISO/TC 176/SC2 Working Group, charged with producing an International Standard Guideline to Quality in Project Management. This was published in 1997 as the Standard ISO 10006; revised and retitled Quality Management in Projects, published in 2003. In recognition of his international contribution to standards in Project Management he was invited to be the Principal Guest Speaker at the ProMAC Conference in 2010, in Tokyo.\n\nA long-term collaborative association with Professor Keith Lockyer of Bradford University lead to the publication of Critical Path Analysis and Project Management and Project Network Techniques. This work is now in its seventh edition and has been translated into Russian and Japanese. This classic text is recognised internationally as covering, with great clarity, the concepts and principles of project management, together with a range of detailed planning techniques.\n\nJim Gordon was one of a small group of six professionals involved in the emerging technique of Project Management. In 1972, the group decided there was a need to set up an Association for Project Management, to share and develop skills amongst practitioners. It is now recognised as an accredited force in the world of project management with an individual membership of over 20,000 and corporate membership of over 500. Jim Gordon was a pivotal member of APM and was actively involved with the Board of Management until 2003.\n\nDr James Hugh Gordon was one of a rather rare genus of natural engineers. In lecturing to his students he would summarise the life of an engineer as basically ‘problem solving’ by employing thought to devi"
