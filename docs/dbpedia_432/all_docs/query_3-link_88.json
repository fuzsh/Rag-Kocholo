        "text": "WORCESTER, Mass. - Before, during and even after a snow storm, Marcus Rose and his team at Effective Waterproofing are usually quite busy.\n\n\"I'm expecting to get a great influx because we're getting ready to get this rain and we just had nine inches of snow,\" Rose said.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nCentral Massachusetts received heavy rains Tuesday night into Wednesday\n\nEffective Waterproofing in Worcester is expecting an influx following the snow and rain\n\nOwner Marcus Rose said when the ground is frozen, water can slip through to the basement easily\n\nAhead of Tuesday night's rain, Rose was in Worcester waterproofing an already leaky basement while also preparing it for the eventual melting snow, which he said is among the top causes for wet basements.\n\n\"It is very common that snow melts, and the ground may be frozen,\" Rose said. \"So, water will slide right between the earth and the foundation and find its way down to the bottom here and get in.\"\n\nAfter several inches of snow was dumped on the region, Worcester and parts of central Massachusetts got more wet weather.\n\n\"Water can rise, or pass through crushed stone, find these holes, get in the pipe, and the pipe is pitched so it can pitch and run out,\" Rose said. \"This here, they would just set these side by side with a small little gap in between, that water had to find and get through. Over time, that would get packed up with dirt, and water can't find the pipe no more.\"\n\nIf your basement isn't waterproofed, Rose said there are preventative measures homeowners can take. He recommends getting things covered with a tarp.\n\n\"Get that anchored up on the siding or on the bottom, the last course of siding you have near the seal plate,\" Rose said. \"Get that anchored on there with a couple tacks or nails, or a good old staple gun. Get that draped down the foundation past out maybe six to eight feet, so you have a six to eight foot cover.\""
