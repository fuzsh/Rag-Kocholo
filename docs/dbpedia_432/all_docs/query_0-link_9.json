        "text": "STOP PRESS! With only 4% of the new Labour Cabinet having been privately educated, I have revised the PSM’s “power” rating down to 93%. A step in the right direction, to be sure.\n\nThis is not intended as a list of awful people. Some very good friends of mine were privately educated. So were some of my all-time heroes: people like Rik Mayall, Ade Edmondson, Simon Pegg, Stewart Lee, Sacha Baron Cohen, Armando Iannucci, Douglas Adams, Philip Pullman, Adam Buxton, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders.\n\nBut this desperately needs pointing out: privately educated children are NINETY-FOUR times more likely to reach the British elite than those of us who were educated in state schools[1]\n\nThat’s why more than half of the hosts on LBC were privately educated. It’s why the only Newsnight presenter in over 40 years to be state educated was Emily Matlis.\n\nIt’s why you can watch British TV for an entire day and not see a single-comprehensive educated Brit with a major part in a drama, cracking jokes on panel shows, travelling around the world with a camera crew, promoting their new book, reading the news, making the news (unless it’s for doing something awful) or making speeches in Parliament.\n\nThere are also a disturbing number of people on this list who have damaged the UK in some way, restricted your rights, curtailed your horizons, made you poorer and/or stolen your hopes and dreams.\n\nWhile many of the 1,000+ people on this list are undoubtedly talented, there are a shed-load who are, quite frankly, thick as mince and wouldn’t have achieved anything in life had they not been promoted way beyond their abilities by their old school chums.\n\nThese titans of mediocrity, who came of age in what were often brutal and unforgiving environments, these blithering incompetents who had all their empathy bullied or beaten out of them as children, are, in many people’s opinion, the reason the UK is in the sorry state is in.\n\nFUN FACT: Pretty much all the “top” Brexshitters attended private school.\n\nThings were arguably getting better in the second half of the 20th century. For instance, from 1964 to 1997 all of our Prime Ministers were state educated. But in the 27 years since then, we’ve been under a private school PM for all but three. Currently, every single leader of a major political party in Great Britain, with the exception of the SNP and Plaid Cymru, attended a private school. It seems clear that unless you’re both ludicrously talented and/or ludicrously lucky, social mobility in this country is all-but dead.\n\nThe UK has about 2,600 private schools, some for-profit and some charitable. They are currently all exempt from VAT. Additionally 1,300 schools with charitable status pay no corporation tax, capital gains tax, or stamp duty and they also benefit from inheritance tax relief, and Gift Aid on donations as well… that’s a 25% top-up paid for by the taxpayer. In fact, through this utterly warped system, every year over £3 billion is taken from the public purse and effectively gifted to the children of millionaires.[2]\n\nMeanwhile, 1 in 4 children in the UK are living in poverty.\n\nPrivate schools don’t need to be inspected by Ofsted, and they are not required to follow the national curriculum. Children who attend private schools are statistically more likely to be abused, more likely to be bullied, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour in later life.[3]\n\nWhichever way you look at it, the 7% of the population who were privately educated dominate public life in the UK to a truly shocking extent, muscling out the 93% of us who attended state schools—from politics, the media, showbiz, the arts, elite sports and a truly scandalous number of top jobs.\n\nPeople who attended private school often claim that their expensive education had little to do with their subsequent success in life—they’re naturally smarter, more daring, they work harder and they’re clearly better at everything than the rest of us.\n\nI encourage you to take a leisurely scroll through the ridiculously long list below and come to your own conclusions.\n\nGood luck,"
