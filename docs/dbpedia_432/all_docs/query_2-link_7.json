        "text": "Date you joined the School?\n\nSeptember 2012.\n\nWhat do you do at Bethany?\n\nI teach Dyslexia and Learning Support and Science, and I am a tutor in The Mount.\n\nOther Responsibilities?\n\nPSHCE coordinator.\n\nWhat is your favourite quotation and why?\n\nWisest is she who knows she does not know – Jostein Gaarder, Sophie’s World. There is always something new to learn.\n\nWhat was your favourite subject at school and why?\n\nScience because I liked finding out how things work and Maths because I liked to give my brain a work out.\n\nWhy do you like working at Bethany?\n\nI like the working atmosphere at Bethany where staff and pupils work together to do their very best every day. There are so many little things that make Bethany a great place to be: I love the pupils performances in assembly; how the Sixth Form pupils take on responsibility in School; the friendly pupils who call out good night as you walk to your car – even if you don’t teach them!\n\nWhat interests do you have outside Bethany?\n\nReading, cinema, travel, going to see live music, cooking and I do waste a lot of time on Pinterest!\n\nWhat is your favourite childhood memory?\n\nPutting on a ‘Wizard of Oz’ play for my parents with my sisters – I was the scarecrow!\n\nDate you joined the School?\n\nSeptember 2003.\n\nWhat do you do at Bethany?\n\nI am Head of Science and I teach Physics (GCSE and A level) and Science (KS3).\n\nOther responsibilities?\n\nI am the Second Assistant Housemaster in The Mount boarding house. I also supervise the Science Technology Engineering Maths (STEM) club.\n\nWhat did you do before you came to Bethany?\n\nI was teaching Physics at Howard High School (Zimbabwe) and then moved to Ursuline College (UK).\n\nWhat is your favourite music and why?\n\nI like to listen to the almost extinct and hard to learn type of thumb piano music played by the Korekore people of Northern Zimbabwe. When played slowly at night it is great for quiet time (meditation) and when played fast it is fantastic for dancing. I like it when played slowly and quietly at night as the sound is great.\n\nWhat is your favourite quotation and why?\n\nExploration is wired into our brains. If we can see the horizon, we want to know what’s beyond. – Buzz Aldrin. This is the reason why people study and do research.\n\nWhy do you like working at Bethany?\n\nIt is a small and caring community where one can thrive. Bethany gave me comfort when I needed it most. In short I was allowed to thrive and develop my teaching skills over the years.\n\nWhat is your favourite childhood memory?\n\nOn my first day of school I was sat under a tree and asked to write some letters on the soil by the teacher. I could not get them correct. Not a single one. A group leader was assigned to support me. However, on the following day I was writing all the letters of the alphabet correctly and the teacher would leave me to teach other children while he travelled to distant places to do his other business. As a result I was asked to skip some grades into higher year groups. I never had a text book at school or at home either.\n\nWhat is your favourite school memory?\n\nNavigating forests infested with snakes and wild animals, such as hyenas, on an empty tummy to travel 10km or more each way to school. Also having to sit for my Ordinary Subject examinations (Geography, English and Maths) while living in an isolated hut in a bush. The place had one of the highest number of poisonous puff adder snakes per square kilometre if not square metre. I was among them but none of them touched me. All was done to earn a decent education.\n\nWho is your hero and why?\n\nThe Russian theoretical physicist Lev Landau is my hero. As a student, he corrected Albert Einstein in a lecture. He also developed a famous entry exam called the ‘Theoretical Minimum’ to test his students before they enrolled on his Physics course. The test was notoriously hard and comprehensive and only 43 students ever passed it, between 1934 and 1961. Most of those who passed were renowned Physicists. He also produced some of the finest books on theoretical Physics. I think such brilliant Physicists would do wonders for mankind like colonising the moon and other physics related adventures while also supporting the weaker who would like to study physics.\n\nDate you joined the School?\n\nApril 2021.\n\nWhat do you do at Bethany?\n\nI teach Mandarin and Mathematics. I am also a House Assistant.\n\nWhat did you do before you came to Bethany?\n\nI taught in North Wales for the past 11 years.\n\nWhat is your favourite novel/music/artist/film?\n\nI mostly watch documentaries as they are real lives for real people. I hate reality shows!\n\nWhat is your favourite quotation and why?\n\nRomans 8:28 ‘And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.’\n\nThis verse gives me profound peace and strength when I am in a difficult situation. Everything we meet in life works together for our best.\n\nWhat was your favourite subject at School and why?\n\nEnglish. I love languages. Learning English has led me to a whole new world when I came to the UK to continue my Postgraduate studies.\n\nWhy do you like working at Bethany?\n\nBethany is a small school in the beautiful countryside. I like working in small school because I can get to know the staff and pupils better. I like the family atmosphere here in Bethany.\n\nWhat interests do you have outside Bethany?\n\nI enjoy singing, walking, cycling and reading.\n\nWhat is your favourite childhood memory?\n\nProbably taking the train with my Mum to visit my Aunt living by the sea. My home town is far away from the sea, so that was very exciting.\n\nWhat is your favourite colour and why?\n\nRed. It is vibrant and joyful colour. You see a lot of red coloured objects particularly around Chinese New Year. Red is an expression of happiness in Chinese culture.\n\nIf you were not doing what you are doing now, what would you be doing?\n\nIt’s hard to say as there would be many things I would like to do. A possible answer could be neuroscientist because I am fascinated in human brains."
