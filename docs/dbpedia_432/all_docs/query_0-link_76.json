        "text": "Category: Stained glass windows\n\nA brief visit to Glasson Dock\n\nA short break in the currently interminably wet weather brought widespread clear blue skies and sunshine last Saturday; it was too good to miss so I decided to take the 37-mile hop northwards to Glasson Dock on the Lune estuary. Unfortunately the journey was far from straightforward as what would normally be a drive of just less than an hour was disrupted by no less than five sets of roadworks with single file traffic which added another forty minutes to the time and completely screwed up my plans.\n\nBy the time I finally got to Glasson I knew I wouldn’t have time to do my intended walk before I lost the best of the sunshine so I stuck to wandering within the boundaries of the village instead. Past the dock and onto the Bay Cycleway I walked for a short distance before turning inland and from the bridge which took the road over the canal I noticed a strange looking boat moored up a distance away. It looked more like a submarine than a canal boat and as I hadn’t seen it last year when I was round that way I went to take a closer look, although it was partially obscured by all the canalside vegetation.\n\nBack on the road I went to take a look round the marina, something which I’ve never done before. I wasn’t sure if I might be trespassing on private property so I was prepared for being thrown out but no-one bothered me – presumably anyone who saw me assumed I was with someone who had a boat there – and I spent a pleasant ten minutes or so wandering round to get a few photos.\n\nFrom the marina entrance the road took me uphill past fields and the village primary school and eventually I came to the lay-by with its views across the estuary and where I parked for the night one weekend last year, although this time I was parked at the bottom of the hill not far from the Dalton Arms pub. With thoughts turning towards finding something to eat I headed back towards the dock and came across four cute cats in the pub car park, and luckily they all stayed put while I took their photos.\n\nThe Lock Keeper’s Rest adjacent to the car park at the far side of the dock is popular with bikers and on such a nice day it was very busy, but though it gets good reviews I went to the much quieter village shop and cafe instead, just managing to place an order before they stopped serving hot food. The cheese and ham toastie and hot chocolate were really good and I’m sure the guy must have put half a pig in that toastie as there was so much ham – and it was proper ham too, none of that processed stuff.\n\nBack on the Bay Cycleway the mid afternoon sun was casting long shadows and a golden glow over the marshes of the inner estuary. Turning off at the entrance to the churchyard I popped into the little chapel for a few photos then walked back along the canal and past the marina and canal basin. Since my visit to the village last year a ‘bicycle wheel’ sculpture has been added to the picnic area near the inner dock; created by Ulverston-based blacksmith/artist Chris Brammall it marks the start (or end) of Morecambe Bay’s 80-mile long Bay Cycleway.\n\nWith the wheel sculpture and pilot boat ‘Gertrude’ being my final photos I headed back to the van and set off for home, finding my way to the M6 to avoid all the previous roadworks and arriving back just before I needed to put the van lights on. In spite of not having time to do my intended walk it had been an enjoyable couple of hours in Glasson, appreciated more now as it’s rained every day since then.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nManchester Oratory – St. Chad’s church\n\nSt. Chad’s Catholic church, Cheetham Hill, is situated just a 10-minute walk from Victoria Station and not far from the Jewish Museum. I’d passed it on my way to visit the museum but ignored it as the museum itself was my main objective, however during a recent internet search for something entirely unrelated I went down one of the inevitable rabbit holes and came across a photo which prompted me to make an almost immediate visit to this church.\n\nSt. Chad’s is the Catholic mother-church of Manchester with its origins dating back to the 1770s. The original St. Chad’s, situated in Rook Street (now Fountain Street) off Market Street, was the first permanent Catholic chapel to be built in Manchester following the Reformation. Construction started in 1774 and the chapel was opened on June 23rd 1776 with Father Roland Broomhead being its first Rector. In later years he established the new chapel of St. Mary’s in Mulberry Street, opened in 1794, and St. Augustine’s in Granby Row, opened in 1820.\n\nFather Broomhead died at the age of 69 shortly after the opening of St. Augustine’s, after which St Chad’s became the chapel-of-ease to the new church, however in 1835 it reverted to an independent mission when Father William Turner, who later became the first Bishop of Salford, was appointed to take charge. In 1842 Father Turner was succeeded by Father Robert Croskell, later to become the second Provost of Salford, and early in 1846 he commissioned architects Weightman and Hadfield of Sheffield to design a new church in the Gothic Revival style. The Rook Street chapel was sold to be converted into a warehouse and construction of the new St. Chad’s on Cheetham Hill Road started in April that year. When the church was consecrated by Bishop George Hilary Brown on August 4th 1847 it was the first new Catholic church to open in Manchester since the 1829 Act of Emancipation.\n\nThe history of St. Chad’s continues right up to the present day. Throughout the years until the early 21st century the church was served by clergy of the Salford Diocese then when the last secular Parish Priest retired in 2003 it was served from St. Anne’s in nearby Crumpsall. In 2007 the Premonstratensians took up residence following the closure of Corpus Christi Priory in Miles Platting but they only stayed for a short while and after their departure St. Chad’s became the residence of the Strangeways Prison chaplain. In 2013 the church was taken over by the Oratorian community from the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus on Oxford Road, with permission to establish the Manchester Oratory of St. Philip Neri. Abbreviated to The Manchester Oratory it was founded at St Chad’s on November 1st 2019.\n\nHaving previously checked the times of any services I knew I had plenty of time to look round the church and though I heard the occasional noise of a door closing somewhere, presumably in the presbytery, I had the place to myself for the whole time I was there. As with many Catholic churches the nave and side aisles were dotted with several statues of various saints and religious figures and along the walls were a series of fourteen icons telling the story of the Crucifiction. With several beautifully coloured stained glass windows and many other lovely features it’s been hard to decide which of the 140+ photos to put on here.\n\nThe high altar contains relics of St. Chad and the east window behind, made by Barnett of York in 1847, depicts scenes from his life though as of the present day they are still in the wrong narrative order after being removed and reinstalled during an earlier cleaning.\n\nSet back on one side of the south aisle was the cutest church organ I’ve ever seen. Not much larger than an early 1960s kitchen cabinet, with its open front and visible pipes and workings it looked very unusual. With no other church organ in evidence I assume it’s in use but unfortunately I’ve been unable to find any information about it anywhere.\n\nOne thing I didn’t expect to see on my wander round the church was a full human skeleton in a glass case. This is the martyr saint Benignus, discovered in the Catacombs at St. Laurence-outside-the-Walls in Rome sometime during the 18th century; his birth name was unknown so he was given that name when he was discovered. Relics of martyrs were often given to distinguished people and those of St. Benignus were given to the Vicomtesse de Bernis who passed them on to the English Canonesses of St. Augustine, then at Versailles, in 1779. Expelled from France in 1901 the Canonesses came to Britain, bringing the relics with them, and by 1921 had established nursing homes in Liverpool and Cumbria, however in 1995 they entrusted the relics to the Holy Name church from where they arrived at St. Chad’s when the Oratorians took up residence.\n\nA team of medics from Manchester University laid out the bones anatomically on red silk and after careful analysis the skull was reconstructed by a medical and forensic student at Dundee University. Part of a bone was sent to the archaeology unit at Oxford University for Carbon 14 dating and the result came back that it was from the mid 3rd century, meaning that St. Benignus would probably have died by execution during the Roman persecutions against the Christian faith.\n\nAnd so to the main reason for my visit to the church – the new west window in the nave. Installed in 2020 and depicting the Transfiguration it was designed by stained glass artist Deborah Lowe and created in conjunction with Pendle Stained Glass Ltd. It was stunning, and deserved more than a couple of photos to show some of the detail.\n\nBack outside I sat for a few minutes in the peaceful and pretty little garden before heading back into the city centre. It was seeing a photo of the new window which prompted my visit and I wasn’t disappointed – the church interior is lovely and has so much of visual interest. The icing on the cake though just had to be that window – it’s stunning, and it was well worth the visit just to see it.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nVisiting Manchester’s Jewish Museum\n\nAn afternoon spent back in the city a few days ago saw me visiting the Jewish Museum situated in the lower Cheetham Hill area and just a 15-minute walk from Victoria Station. Housed in a Grade ll* listed former Spanish and Portuguese synagogue the museum originally opened in 1984 and has recently undergone a £6 million restoration and sympathetic redevelopment to add a modern extension to one side, however unlike the Manchester Monastery marrying the old with the new actually works.\n\nBack in the mid 18th century Jewish people from many different parts of the world travelled to Manchester hoping to create a better life for themselves and their families, seeing the city as a place of great economic opportunity. The woollen, linen and cotton industries were growing, as was the population, and by the 1780s a community of Jewish salesmen, shopkeepers and their families had settled in the commercial district on the northern edge of the city and established businesses there. Permanent places of worship were founded and as the communities grew the Jewish Mancunians established schools, social clubs, newspapers, charities, a hospital and a communal council.\n\nThroughout the 19th and into the 20th centuries they were joined by merchants, traders and other workers who saw Manchester’s industries and the population which supported them as a promising market and the Jewish community grew steadily, expanding north and west towards Salford and Bury. Even today it continues to grow and is the largest Jewish community outside London, with the only other still-growing community in this country being in Gateshead.\n\nSephardi Jews are those whose origins lie in Spain and Portugal and on February 4th 1872 members of Manchester’s growing Sephardi community met to discuss building the first Sephardi synagogue in the city. Land was purchased from the Earl of Derby and Manchester-based Jewish architect Edward Salomons, known for his Gothic Revival and Italianate style of architecture, was commissioned to design a new synagogue for which he took inspiration from the Spanish and Portuguese origins of the Sephardi community and the Alhambra Palace in Spain. The new synagogue opened on May 6th 1874 and the Sephardi community thrived so well over the years that in 1904 a second Sephardi synagogue was built in the south of the city.\n\nAlthough the Jewish community as a whole was still growing, by the 1970s many families were moving out to the suburbs and attending other synagogues – membership of the Spanish and Portuguese synagogue began to wane and the heritage around lower Cheetham Hill and Strangeways was being lost. In 1974 a Jewish Heritage Committee was formed and to capture the disappearing history of Jewish migration and settlement in Manchester they appointed local historian, Bill Williams, to write a book, ‘The Making of Manchester Jewry’ which revealed the fascinating stories of the first Jewish settlers and traders in Manchester from 1740 to 1875.\n\nFollowing the book’s publication the committee had the idea of creating a museum and in 1976 the then president of the synagogue, Werner Mayer, suggested the building as a good location. The committee launched a public fund-raising appeal for the synagogue’s conversion into a museum and by 1982 the congregation had moved to a converted school building in Salford. After two years of conservation work the museum opened on Sunday March 25th 1984 with a temporary exhibition ‘The making of Manchester Jewish Museum’ then a new permanent exhibition opened a year later.\n\nAfter 35 years of welcoming visitors of all ages through its doors, and with a successful bid for National Lottery Heritage funding, the museum closed temporarily in 2019 to undergo a £6 million development which included a full renovation and restoration of the synagogue itself. Conservation experts, historic painters and stained glass specialists were all involved in researching and restoring the building to its original decorative scheme and returning it to its former visual glory and it reopened in 2021. With most of the museum exhibits being housed in the modern Moorish-style extension the beautifully restored synagogue not only serves as a major museum exhibit in itself, giving visitors a unique insight into a Sephardi Jewish place of worship dating back to the 1870s, but also acts as a space to hold cultural events, talks, shows and concerts.\n\nEntrance to the museum is in the modern side of the building and double doors took me into a light and spacious covered atrium with a welcome desk and small cafe on one side, then stairs took me up to the main exhibition areas. The museum itself is unique in that it isn’t like most museums, full of ancient artefacts from many centuries ago – it’s a museum of Jewish life in the 19th and early 20th centuries, telling the stories of people who settled in the Manchester area and made it their home, and displaying many items relevant to them and their lives.\n\nA wall of photographs showed individuals and families who came to live in Manchester while round the gallery were screens showing short documentaries and speakers with headphones to listen to the recorded voices of some of the Jewish Mancunians telling their stories. One old lady told of starting work in a sewing factory as she wanted to learn how to make a coat and also become an accomplished seamstress, while another said how she had wanted to learn English as quickly as possible as she no longer wanted to speak German. Others told of coming to Manchester as part of the children’s Kindertransport programme just before the start of WW2, not knowing when, or even if, they would ever see their parents and families again – most of them didn’t.\n\nProtected by a plexi-glass case was Abraham’s Ark, an ornate portable cupboard last owned and used by Abraham Duinkerk. He was born in London in 1907 though his family had originally come from Amsterdam in the early 19th century. The Ark would have been used to store religious items such as prayer books and shawls and would have travelled with the family when they came to settle in Manchester.\n\nAbraham Btesh was one of the earliest Syrian traders to arrive in Manchester. From 1842 he operated his textile business in the city but never actually lived there as he felt it was unsuitable to uphold his Syrian traditions. The large book on display features his company’s many trademark designs and the pages are turned every so often to show different ones.\n\nOne of the stories I found fascinating but more than a little sad was that of Helen Taichner who arrived alone in Manchester from Poland in 1946 with just a suitcase, having lost most of her family during the Holocaust including her husband and baby. She had survived WW2 by hiding in various places and over the course of five years slept in churchyards, posed as a Christian and lived in a coal cellar for six months, often aided by friends who risked their own lives to help her.\n\nThe dress was made in 1943 by Yadwiga, a Polish maid who helped Helen to hide in the coal cellar underneath her employer’s home, and she wore it when she ventured out to buy bread. She would also use the religious book to disguise herself as a Catholic, having memorised the prayers in case she was ever questioned about her religion. While hiding in the coal cellar she wore the same clothes for weeks on end and the threadbare woollen socks had been mended many many times.\n\nHelen’s journey to Manchester can be mapped through the stamps in her Polish passport. On arrival in Britain she had to register immediately with the police and couldn’t take up any employment without the consent of the Ministry of Labour. Staying initially with relatives she went on to meet Henry who had been imprisoned in Siberia but allowed to come to Britain in 1943 after joining the Polish Armed Forces; they married in 1948 and together they had a daughter, Judith.\n\nIn the next case a rather cute little teddy bear with a crooked nose caught my attention. It was brought to Manchester by Leo Marcus, having once belonged to his young son who didn’t survive the Holocaust. Leo settled in Manchester and gave the teddy bear to his neighbours for their children to play with.\n\nIn one of the many display cases were three items with a name which will be known to most people. Mordechai Slazenger Moss, an umbrella maker, arrived in Manchester from Germany in 1800 and though the family were initially involved in tailoring they later diversified into sportswear. The Slazenger brand was established in 1881 by brothers Ralph and Albert Slazenger and in 1902 the company was appointed official supplier of tennis balls to Wimbledon, with the brand now remaining the longest unbroken sporting sponsorship in history.\n\nAnother well-known household name originated in Manchester in 1894. Michael Marks arrived in Britain from Slonim in the Russian Empire (now Belarus) in 1882 and set up a market stall in Kirkgate Market, Leeds. In 1894 he moved to Manchester and in partnership with Tom Spencer (who wasn’t Jewish) he created Marks & Spencer, opening their first shop at No. 20 Cheetham Hill Road, just a few hundred yards down from the synagogue. Early M&S stores were called ‘Penny Bazaars’ with the marketing slogan ‘Don’t ask the price, it’s a penny’ and ‘Free admission’ encouraged customers to browse with no obligation to buy anything, which was a new concept in the 1890s.\n\nDaniel Segolovich was born in Poland and came to Manchester as a teenager in the 1920s, eventually setting up a business making waterproof coats – he called it Dannimac, derived from Daniel and Macintosh. Inspired by time spent in America his son Ralph later had the idea of making rainwear which was also fashionable as well as practical and new manufacturing techniques enabled him to produce coats in lighter fabrics. His creations were featured in magazines such as Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar and were often modelled by fashion icons in the 1960s including Twiggy.\n\nThe exhibits and stories in the gallery were so interesting I could have spent far longer in there than I did but I couldn’t photograph everything and I was itching to see the older part of the museum. A short ‘bridge’ took me across the atrium into the upper floor of the synagogue where I was quite metaphorically smacked in the face by one of the most stunning stained glass windows I’ve ever seen. Set high up in the wall above the Ark at the far end of the building it serves as a memorial to Ezra Altaras, a former synagogue President who died in 1913, while on each side of the balcony were four windows in two different designs with two narrow corner windows at the end.\n\nAlong the downstairs side walls were a series of eight pictorial windows, four on each side, and the colours of these were just as stunning as the large circular window above the Ark. Each one depicts a Biblical scene and is in memory of a former member of the synagogue and though they were obviously designed and made by the same person or company unfortunately no-one knows who that was or when they were installed.\n\nMy mid afternoon visit to the museum must have been just at the right time as the only other vistors in there were leaving as I arrived so I had the place to myself. There was a very friendly lady guide available in the gallery to answer any questions and impart various bits of information and downstairs in the synagogue I found Ian, a mine of information who took the time to tell me in detail all about the windows and other features of the building. This was a place which, up until a few months ago, I’d known nothing about and I came away having learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed my look round.\n\nBack at home, and thinking about my museum visit, I realised why I hadn’t been impressed with the Manchester Monastery the week before – that place had no character. The Jewish Museum however, especially the synagogue, had character and soul in spades, and as my initial entrance fee (a very reasonable £6) entitles me to return free as many times as I want within the next twelve months I’ll most definitely be going back, probably more than once.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nManchester’s Hidden Gem – St. Mary’s Catholic Church\n\nOn one of my recent wanderings round the city centre I discovered, almost by accident, St. Mary’s Catholic Church otherwise known as the Hidden Gem. Tucked away down a narrow side street near the Town Hall and surrounded by taller modern buildings it isn’t immediately obvious and I only found it after going down an alley in search of street art.\n\nThe parish of St. Mary dates back to 1794 though the first permanent Catholic chapel to be built in Manchester following the Reformation was St Chad’s, situated a short distance away in Rook Street (now Fountain Street) and opened in 1776. Father Roland Broomhead was the church’s first Rector and in 1792 he decided to set up a second Catholic chapel in the city, purchasing a suitable plot of land on Mulberry Street not far from Deansgate.\n\nIntentionally positioned in one of Manchester’s worst areas, St. Mary’s was built to serve the poorest of the city’s population and was officially opened on November 30th 1794 with Father Edward Kenyon, who had been assistant to Father Broomhead, becoming the first Rector. Contrary to popular local myth the church was never built in secret or meant to be hidden, in fact Mulberry Street, although in a deprived area, was actually a busy residential and commercial thoroughfare and the church’s opening was announced in the local newspapers.\n\nWhen Father Kenyon left St. Mary’s to take charge of Pleasington Priory, Blackburn, in 1816 he was succeeded by Father Thomas Lupton who was in turn succeeded by Father Henry Gillow in 1822. In 1833 Father Gillow decided to have the building re-roofed and redecorated with the help of some of the congregation who were in the building trade but without employing a master builder to oversee the project, a decision which was to prove very unwise. Just two years later, on August 8th 1835, a large crack appeared in the dome above the altar; the church was immediately closed and locked up and later that evening the whole dome and part of the roof collapsed, damaging the structure itself and much of the interior. With the church unusable services were moved to the companion school in nearby Lloyd Street and the search started for a new site for St. Mary’s.\n\nFather Gillow died in the Manchester typhus epidemic of 1837; he was succeeded by Father J Billington but plans for a new church site were put on hold. Father Mathias Formby took over in 1844 and the decision was finally taken to rebuild St. Mary’s on the existing site, with Father Formby making the arrangements. Designs by architects Weightman & Hadfield of Sheffield were approved with Matthew Ellison Hadfield overseeing the rebuild; St. Mary’s was completely demolished and rebuilding began that year. Rhenish Romanesque in style, the new St Mary’s was completed in 1848 and formally opened in October that year.\n\nIn 1869 Father John Newton became Missionary Rector of St. Mary’s and along with having the adjacent presbytery remodelled in a Venetian Gothic style he also commissioned sculptor Mr Lane of Preston to design and carve the intricately decorated high altar, side altar and shrine of Our Lady of Manchester. It was as a result of these carvings that the church first came to be known as the ‘Hidden Gem’ when Bishop Herbert Vaughn, who became the second Catholic Bishop of Salford in 1872, commented that ”no matter on which side of the church you look, you behold a hidden gem” – the description was so appropriate that the name stuck and has been used ever since.\n\nAfter the First World War a memorial meeting room was constructed above the south aisle of the church, accessible by an internal stairwell in the church tower as well as from the second floor of the presbytery. The church was designated a listed building in 1963 then a few years later various alterations to the sanctuary included a new lectern and altar though the reredos was left intact.\n\nIn 1993/94 both the church and presbytery had a thorough restoration and the Stations of the Cross, a series of 14 contemporary paintings, were commissioned from noted religious artist Norman Adams RA to be installed on each side of the nave in 1995. Now I admit that a lot of modern art is beyond me as much of it bears no resemblance to what it’s supposed to be and these paintings, to me at least, are a case in point. I liked them for their bright colours, in complete contrast to the rest of the church’s interior, but most of them were hideous and enough to give a small child nightmares so I only photographed a few.\n\nIn the 19th century Father George Ignatius Spencer, an ancestor of Diana, Princess of Wales, preached at St. Mary’s and during the 20th century the church grew to be known by Catholics far and wide. The world famous Italian opera star Beniamino Gigli (1890-1957) once sang at High Mass and the church has also been the subject of paintings by L.S.Lowry and Salford artist Harold Riley.\n\nAlthough when St. Mary’s was originally built it was never meant to be hidden, progress through the years means that it’s now surrounded by much taller buildings, some only built fairly recently, but with its beautiful interior, understated yet colourful stained glass windows and calm peaceful atmosphere it really is a Hidden Gem.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nManchester Cathedral – a church rich in history\n\nAt the end of one of my wanderings around the city centre a while ago I had some time to spare before the next train home so as the cathedral had long been on my list of places to visit I called in to have a look round. Not far from Victoria Station and tucked away behind a triangle of bars, eateries and a couple of pubs the building isn’t exactly obvious so even on a busy Saturday afternoon there was only a handful of fellow visitors in there.\n\nThe origins of Manchester’s first churches are a little obscure but the Domesday survey in 1086 stated that the parish church of St. Mary existed on the site of the present cathedral. The land was owned by the Greslet family, Barons of Manchester, and the church was built beside their manor house which is now Chetham’s School of Music. Around 1215 the Greslets extended the church before the estate passed by marriage to the de la Warre family in 1311, then around 1350 the church was extended again, becoming the same length as the present cathedral though it was much narrower.\n\nAt the end of the 14th century Thomas de la Warre became both Rector of the church and 5th Baron of Manchester. A priest for more than 50 years, in 1421 he was granted a licence from King Henry V and Pope Martin V to establish a collegiate church dedicated to St. Mary, St. George and St. Denys, with a warden, eight fellows, four singing clerks and eight choristers. When he died in 1426 he left £3,000 for the benefit of the collegiate buildings and most of this was used to convert the Baron’s Hall into a house-of-residence for the fellows of the College to live in.\n\nDuring the years which followed various parts of the church were rebuilt and extended, including the reconstruction of the nave and choir stalls, with the choir stalls themselves and their misericord seats being carved at the workshop of William Brownflet of Ripon between 1500 and 1506. The college was dissolved in 1547 under the Dissolution of Colleges Act which came into force that year then ten years later it was re-established by Mary I as a Roman Catholic foundation. In 1578 it was re-founded again by Elizabeth I as the protestant College of Christ with a warden, four fellows, two chaplains, four singing men and four choristers.\n\nFast forward to 1840 and under the Cathedrals Act of that year the warden and fellows of the collegiate church were promoted to Dean and Canons in preparation for the church becoming the cathedral of the new Manchester Diocese which came into effect in 1847. Initial proposals for a new cathedral to be built on Piccadilly Gardens didn’t proceed and a period of major restoration and building work was started on the church the same year. In 1864 the original tower, which had fallen into disrepair, was demolished and replaced with a new tower – identical to the old one but six feet taller it was formally opened in 1868.\n\nIn 1897, to mark Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee, the Victoria Porch was built below the tower and adorned with a sculpture of the Queen carved by her daughter, Princess Louise. In the years between 1898 and 1936 more building work was undertaken which included a new West End and porch and extensions to provide a library, refectory and choir school. In 1925 ten bells, to be hung in the cathedral tower for change ringing, were cast by bellfounders Gillett & Johnston of Croydon, with the tenor (largest) bell weighing 1.3 tonnes. In 1936 the Derby Chapel, previously the St. John the Baptist Chapel dating from 1513, was refitted as the Regimental Chapel for the Manchester Regiment.\n\nOn December 22nd 1940, during the Manchester Blitz, a German bomb exploded a few yards from the north-east corner of the cathedral, severely damaging the roof and demolishing the medieval Lady Chapel and the chantry chapel. All the Victorian stained glass windows were blown out, the medieval choir stalls toppled inwards so as to meet one another and the organ case over the pulpitum was destroyed. It took almost 20 years to complete all the repairs to the building during which stop-gap measures were taken to repair the organ re-using the old pipework, and the Lady Chapel was rebuilt to the designs of architect Hubert Worthington.\n\nIn 1966, Margaret Traherne’s ‘Fire Window’ was installed to commemorate Manchester’s part in the two world wars and also as a symbol of renewal and reconciliation. This was followed over a period of almost 30 years by five new windows on the western side of the Nave : St George in 1972, St Denys in 1976, St Mary in 1980, The Creation in 1991 and The Revelation in 1995.\n\nIn 1996 the cathedral again suffered damage when the IRA bomb exploded on nearby Corporation Street. Restoration work followed and the Healing Window by Linda Walton was installed above the east door in 2004 to mark the completion of this work. In 2016 the Hope Window, designed by Alan Davis, was installed on the other side of the east wall, representing the journey towards new life. The donors also intended it to be a symbol of the strong bond which exists between City and Cathedral.\n\nFurther work in recent years has included new heating, lighting and flooring together with a splendid new organ sponsored by the Stoller Charitable Trust and built at Tickell’s workshop in Northampton for a total cost of around £2.6m. Installation began in July 2016 with the medieval screen between the Nave and the Quire being strengthened to support the four main divisions of the organ. The 4,800-plus pipes range from 6 inches to 32 feet high with the pipe shades designed by text artist Stephen Raw – those facing the Quire were gilded by hand using wafer-thin 23.5 carat gold leaf and the cut out lettering was taken from the words of the liturgy in Latin. After a long period of tuning the organ was officially handed over to the Dean of Manchester on April 3rd 2017 and was played for the first time on Easter Sunday that year.\n\nIn May 2021 the cathedral reached its 600th anniversary of becoming a Collegiate Church and in July that year was visited by Elizabeth ll, then a special Anniversary Service, delayed by a year due to the Covid pandemic, was finally held on May 5th 2022 in the presence of the Lord Archbishop of York.\n\nDiscovered in 1871 during excavation work in the South Porch area the Angel Stone is the oldest artefact in the cathedral and is believed to date from the 9th century. Now protected behind a glass panel it was difficult to photograph without reflections so I’ve taken the picture from the cathedral’s own website. The Holy Night statue was sculpted by Josephina de Vasconcellos in 1992 and represents the Holy Family in the stable.\n\nThe choir stalls themselves contain thirty 16th century misericords similar in style to those at Ripon Cathedral and Beverley Minster and considered to be among the finest in Europe. Unusual, comical and sometimes a touch bloodthirsty, one of the most notable is the earliest known depiction of backgammon in the UK. Although I photographed most of them it would be impossible to put them all on here so I’ve included just a few of my favourites.\n\nThe stand-alone Bishop’s Throne, although in keeping with the medieval choir stall canopies, is actually early Edwardian, made in 1906 by Sir Charles Nicholson. Two kangaroos were included in the carving as a tribute to James Moorhouse, third Bishop of Manchester for seventeen years from May 1886 to his retirement in 1903 – previous to his position in Manchester he had been Bishop of Melbourne, Australia, for ten years from 1876.\n\nBuilt around 1421 by Warden John Huntington, the original rectangular Chapter House was used as a daily meeting place for the Warden and Fellows of the Collegiate Church. Its present octagonal shape was introduced when it was rebuilt in 1506 by Warden James Stanley and the walls contain the coats-of-arms of various families, both royal and local, who have historical connections with the Cathedral, including Henry V, Elizabeth l and George Vl.\n\nThe Fraser Chapel was built in 1887 in memory of Bishop Fraser, second Bishop of Manchester from 1870 to 1885. Known as ‘the peoples’ Bishop’ he was renowned for his concern for the ordinary people of the Diocese and for organising collections for the families of workers on strike. Following damage from the 1996 IRA bomb the chapel was refurbished as a Chapel for Private Prayer and includes a modern painted reredos and a stained glass window designed by Mark Cazalet.\n\nThe statue of Sir Humphrey Chetham (1580-1653) was erected in 1853 and serves as a reminder of the link between the Cathedral and Chetham’s Hospital School. The school was founded in the original manor house buildings in 1658 with money left by Humphrey Chetham on his death three years earlier; in 1952 it became a boys’ grammar school then in 1969 became Chetham’s School of Music where the Cathedral choristers are educated. The world famous mid-17th century Chetham’s Library is also located in the school buildings.\n\nCompared to cathedrals such as Canterbury, Lincoln and York Minster Manchester Cathedral isn’t a big place but in spite of parts of it being heavily restored after two lots of bomb damage there are still so many historical and interesting features that it would be impossible to photograph and write about everything. It was certainly well worth the time I spent looking round and I may very well make a second visit soon to see what I missed this time.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDay 8 – Two churches and another giraffe\n\nBack in April friend Eileen sent me a link to an online local news article about the friendly neighbourhood giraffe and one of the following comments mentioned another giraffe situated in the village of St. George, a mile or so off one of the roads into Abergele, and as I was going into the town anyway I decided to make a detour and go in search of it.\n\nThe giraffe was said to be in the garden of the village pub but when I got there I could see no sign of it anywhere and the pub wasn’t open so I couldn’t go in and ask. I was delighted to find that the church was open though so I went in to have look round and got chatting to a local couple who were just leaving. When I mentioned I was looking for the giraffe they said it had been moved to another garden just over a mile along the road and they very kindly told me where to find it.\n\nThe Parish Church of St. George is Grade ll listed and was designed and built by C H M Mileham between 1887 and 1894, funded by Hugh R Hughes of Kinmel, a landowner and well known genealogist from a wealthy family. Constructed from local limestone with sandstone detailing and a single nave the church was built in the Perpendicular Gothic style, replacing an earlier double-naved church with medieval origins which had existed within the same churchyard.\n\nUnfortunately, in spite of exploring several avenues of research I’ve only been able to find a few scant details of the church interior. The reredos and communion rail are oak, the octagonal font is limestone, and the oak chancel screen has a semi-octagonal lectern and pulpit built in. The south transept contains the organ and at the rear of the church is the Hughes family pew, upholstered and extending across the width of the building under a timber canopy. The stained glass east window is in memory of H R Hughes and and his wife Lady Florentia, given by their grandchildren in 1919.\n\nSomething which did puzzle me though was in a section of one of the stained glass windows – a tiny image of the windmill at Lytham on the Lancashire coast and a reference to Lytham’s Lowther College in connection to Bodelywyddan Castle. This was intriguing and deserved a bit of investigation.\n\nLowther College, a private girls’ school, was set up in 1896 in Lytham by Florence Lindley who was its first headmistress. In 1920 she leased Bodelwyddan Castle from its then owners and moved the college from Lytham to the castle, purchasing the property five years later and remaining as headmistress until 1927 when the college was sold to Allied Schools, an association of independent schools. She then moved a few miles away to Kinmel Hall where she converted the building into a ‘rheuma spa’ for the treatment of people with rheumatism. A well worn brass plaque below the window says it’s in memory of Florence, ”founder of Lowther College, Lytham St Annes and Bodelwyddan” so presumably this was the church she attended during and after her years at the castle.\n\nAt the bottom end of the churchyard was the Grade ll listed Gothic Revival style mausoleum, erected when the previous church still existed. Built of Derbyshire sandstone in 1835-6 by architect Thomas Jones of Chester it was commissioned for the Hughes family by William Lewis Hughes who was created first Baron Dinorben in 1831. Three of its sides have blind 4-light Perpendicular traceried windows while the front has a carved Hughes’ coat-of-arms combined with that of William’s first wife, Charlotte Margaret Grey.\n\nWith St. George only being a tiny place – more hamlet than proper village – there was nothing else to see once I’d looked round the church so I set off along the road in search of the giraffe. Thanks to the directions of the local couple it was easy enough to find and even from the end of the lane it was obvious that it was a much larger and taller creature than the other one. Made of wood it looked quite weathered in its appearance so must have existed for quite some time though I couldn’t see the significance of the flower stalk in its mouth.\n\nHappy that I’d found the giraffe I followed the road down into Abergele, parked at Tesco and walked round to St. Michael’s church nearby. The first church building on the site was founded in the 8th century, the land having been granted by the Prince of North Wales to Elfod, Bishop of Bangor, for the purpose of establishing a place of worship on the banks of the River Gele. This early church was probably a group of timber domestic dwellings and a burial ground all enclosed by a fence, and worship would have been held in the open air.\n\nThe present church is built of local limestone and sandstone with a slate roof and dates from the late 12th/early 13th century when it was dedicated to St. Michael. It was modified and partially rebuilt around 1400, at which time the tower was also built, then after a period of neglect the building was restored in 1663. During the 19th century the Victorians made various alterations to the church including adding to the height of the tower in 1861 and building a castellated wall around the top. The tower itself is home to a peal of six bells – two by Taylor’s of Loughborough dated 1887, two dated 1844, one dated 1895 and a sixth dated 1730 – plus a single Sanctus bell, the smallest and oldest dated 1723.\n\nThe church clock was maintained in Victorian times by the poet David Griffith, a clock maker by trade and famous as the first Archdruid of Wales, and shortly after his 83rd birthday in 1883 he gave the clock a complete restoration. During the Victorian renovations the porch was built in 1879, replacing a previous stone porch, and the lychgate was erected in 1887 to commemorate Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee. The church interior and the lychgate were renovated in 2004.\n\nClose to the inner door the octagonal font is set on two steps. Although the base is late medieval the bowl dates from 1663 and was given by vicar Henry Pugh to mark the church’s restoration and also to replace the original bowl which had at some point been destroyed. The bowl itself is lead lined and the cover is oak with a wrought iron handle. Set in the wall near the font are two Celtic Cross slabs dating from the 13th century and a stone coffin lid believed to date from the late 14th century after the time of the Black Death. Originally set in the tiled floor of the Chancery, probably sited there in Victorian times, it was moved to its current position in 2008.\n\nThe double nave is divided by an arcade of eight bays with octagonal columns and with the rood screen extending across both naves. Dating from the 15th century this screen is all that remains of the original rood screen and loft which were removed at the time of the Reformation in the 16th century.\n\nThe original organ was built by William Hill and installed on the south side of the St. Elfod Chapel after the 1879 renovation, then in 1924 it was completely renovated and rebuilt by Rushworth and Draper using pneumatic action and was moved to the north side of the chapel. In 1982 it was overhauled and moved to the west end of the north aisle but it was found to cause problems for the organist and choir who were now at opposite ends of the church, making the musical balance between them difficult. In 1999 the organ was moved back to the north side of the St. Elfod Chapel by organ builder and tuner Eric Newbound and the pneumatic action was replaced by electric action which provided a separate console.\n\nOut in the churchyard and not far from the porch is the Penance Stone where those who had committed grievous sins would ask for forgiveness, and by the north wall is the memorial to the 33 victims of the 1868 Llanddulas railway disaster. Buried in an unmarked grave nearby are seven bodies which were washed ashore after the burning of the ”Ocean Monarch” ship in 1848 when 178 emigrants perished.\n\nAlso buried in the churchyard are the remains of the ‘Abergele Martyrs’, Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, members of the Free Wales Movement killed when their own home made bomb exploded prematurely on the day of Prince Charles’ investiture as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon castle in 1969. Initially it was thought they had been planning to blow up the royal train as it passed the town but an inquest found their intention was to target Government buildings close to where Abergele library now stands. In 2019 plans to erect a plaque to mark the 50th anniversary of their deaths were turned down by local councilors.\n\nUnfortunately I hadn’t been able to explore as much of the church’s interior as I would have liked as the lady vicar was getting ready to close the building but it’s such an interesting place with many more things to see so a return visit will certainly be on my list for the near future.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSt. Winefride’s Chapel and Well, Holywell\n\nA mile up the hill from Basingwerk Abbey, on the B5121 and close to the small town of Holywell, is St. Winefride’s Chapel and Well, a Grade l listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument known to many as ‘The Lourdes of Wales’. The only such place in Britain with a continuous history of public pilgrimage for over 13 centuries, the well itself is attributed to a legend dating back to the 7th century.\n\nWinefride (Gwenfrewi in Welsh) was of noble birth, a young niece of St. Beuno, and in the 7th century lived with her family in the place now known as Holywell. According to legend, when she spurned the advances of Caradoc, a prince’s son, he drew his sword in anger and severed her head which rolled a short way down the hill, and where it came to rest water began to flow from a spring. When Beuno heard the news he interrupted a service in the nearby church, retrieved Gwenfrewi’s severed head, placed it beside her body and prayed. His prayers were answered and Gwenfrewi returned to life, though forever after she bore a thin white scar around her neck.\n\nThere are a few different versions of the legend, probably told by several different people over the years and further embellished with each telling, so predictably the tale has long been dismissed as far-fetched but Winefride herself was a real person rather than a legendary one. Devout even before her supposed martyrdom she became entirely devoted to a holy life and later entered the nunnery at Gwytherin, eventually becoming the Abbess there. On her death she was buried in the grounds of the nunnery and lay there until her bones were exhumed and relocated to Shrewsbury Abbey in 1138. Her enduring personality meant that she was revered as a saint from the moment of her death and her well at Holywell became a place of pilgrimage and healing.\n\nIn the late 11th century the well came into wider recognition when the Earls of Chester granted its ownership to the recently founded St. Werburgh’s Abbey in Chester. Ownership of the well stayed with St. Werburgh’s until 1132 when it was granted to the newly founded Basingwerk Abbey, but by 1157 it had been returned to St. Werburgh’s by Hugh II, the son of Ranulph de Gernon, Basingwerk’s founder. In 1240 however, ownership of the well was once more back with the Cistercians at Basingwerk, gifted to them by Dafydd Llywelyn, son of Llywelyn the Great, and it remained with them until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536.\n\nThe original shrine and its church were relatively simple affairs but by the middle of the 12th century they had become more than a local landmark. In 1189 Richard I of England (Richard the Lionheart) made a pilgrimage to Holywell to pray for the success of his forthcoming crusade – he was the first known monarch to make the journey, which was a sure sign of how important the shrine had become.\n\nAlthough the shrine itself escaped unscathed during the Welsh/English wars of the late 13th century the church did sustain some damage, for which King Edward I paid compensation of just over 13 shillings on November 3rd 1284, the day marked as St. Winefride’s feast day. The well and its shrine may have been spared from damage during any subsequent battles but general wear and tear eventually took their toll and in 1427 the Basingwerk Cistercians sought permission from Pope Martin V to repair and renovate the site.\n\nThe shrine and its chapel which can be seen today date from around 1500. After Henry Tudor’s victory at Bosworth in 1485 and his subsequent elevation to the throne, becoming King Henry VII, the Tudors became generous benefactors of St. Winefride’s shrine, mainly through Margaret Beaufort, Henry’s mother and wife of Thomas Stanley, and it’s probable that her generosity was behind the building of the new chapel and its well chamber. The work was supervised by Thomas Pennant, Abbot of Basingwerk between 1481 and 1523, and the quality of the workmanship, including a frieze of animals and the badges of Thomas Stanley (Margaret Beaufort’s third husband) round the building’s exterior suggests that royal masons may have been employed.\n\nIn April 1637, after many attempts over the years by various people, including Elizabeth I at the turn of the 17th century, to suppress the many pilgrims and their use of the shrine, Sir John Bridgeman, the Chief Justice of Chester, ordered the removal of the iron posts used to support the infirm when entering the waters and the shrine to be mutilated. On demanding an update six months later he was told that the posts had indeed been removed and the statue of Winefride had been whitewashed. The following year the death of Bridgeman himself, the stroke suffered by one of his wardens responsible for the desecration of the shrine, and the burning down of the house of another were seen as a divine punishment for their actions.\n\nDuring the Civil Wars of 1642-49 the chapel and shrine were badly damaged and the whitewashed statue of Winefride was completely destroyed. In August 1686 James II and his wife, Mary of Modena, visited the shrine to pray for the gift of a son and heir and while there Mary gave £30 towards the building’s restoration. This money was put to good use, the chapel and shrine were substantially restored and a stone, dated 1687, was incorporated into the well basin, though it wasn’t until two centuries later, in 1886, that a new statue of St. Winefride was commissioned to replace the one which had been destroyed.\n\nIn 1723 the chapel, which had for so long provided unbroken service to pilgrims and the faithful, was taken over by the authorities and turned into a day school for the education of poor children, being substantially altered by the addition of various walls and rendering it unusable as a place of worship, although pilgrims still continued to visit the shrine below. It wasn’t until later in the 20th century that steps were taken to restore the chapel to its original state.\n\nThe only shrine in Britain to have survived the 16th century Reformation, the two storey architecturally unique building is set into the hillside, with the chapel immediately above the well, and it’s one of the most perfect examples of Late Gothic perpendicular architecture in Wales. The chapel itself has a north aisle, a nave and an apsidal chancel with one large stained glass window, while the three bays of the aisle mirror the three arcades of the vault in the shrine below, although the outer stone stairs linking the two floors are now blocked.\n\nIn the shrine the spring rises in a central basin in the shape of a truncated eight-pointed star, with steps at the front for access. The basin is enclosed by a low wall with columns rising to form part of an elaborately ornamented vault of unusually complex design, while the water flows beneath the surrounding walkway into a rectangular outdoor bathing pool. Around ninety sculptured bosses sit at the intersections of the vaulting ribs, these include angels, the green man, the arms of the Stanley family, and patterns incorporating foliage and strange beasts. In the centre, a pendant boss has six scenes from the life of St Winefride and Beuno and a corbel by the entrance portrays a pilgrim carrying another on his back, acting as a reminder of the importance of the well as a place of pilgrimage and healing.\n\nIn a separate small building to one side of the bathing pool is the Gatehouse Chapel where pilgrims and visitors can light a candle in prayer or in memory of loved ones. This simple little chapel contains a replica of “The Virgin with the Laughing Child”, an original statuette which was made around 1465 and attributed to the prominent Florentine sculptor Antonio Gambarelli Rossellino, although some believe it was actually created by Leonardo da Vinci. Although there’s no information on when this replica was actually made it was presented to St. Winefred’s shrine in 1996 by Fr Bernard Lordan (Parish Priest 1988-98) and was restored in 2018.\n\nMoving forward into the 20th century, in 1917 disaster struck the shrine when underground mining on Halkyn Mountain cut the stream which fed the well spring. Not only did this lead to the well running dry, it also led to a decline in the Greenfield Valley industry which relied on the waters of the stream, but eventually another source was found not far from the original and the flow to the well was restored although much reduced. Strangely though – or maybe not – the fact that Winefride’s original miraculous flow now surfaces some distance away at Bagillt seems to be completely ignored.\n\nIn 1930 the Victorian St. Winefride’s Mill and Brewery were acquired and turned into the well gardens and custodian’s house which is now the museum we see today, and after the 18th century school room amendments had been removed work on restoring the chapel to its original state had been completed by 1976. Still in use to this day, Holy Mass is celebrated each Sunday at 5pm during the summer season until the end of September and an annual pilgrimage is held on June 22nd (or the following Sunday if the 22nd is a weekday) as this is the anniversary of Winefride’s death and miraculous return to life.\n\nThe chapel and well are in the ownership of the Church in Wales and maintained by Cadw, and there are three half-hourly bathing sessions each day. Open to everyone, whether devout or just curious, Protestant or Catholic, or anyone of any faith who wishes to visit, whether the legend is believable or not St. Winefride’s is without doubt an amazing, unique and very special place.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSt. Mary’s Church, Wigton\n\nThe Parish Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Wigton, was built between 1785 and 1789 on the site of a previous church built in the year 1100. Unfortunately no records of the old church exist so there’s no documentation of its size or appearance though it’s known that round about 1330 a pele tower was added to the building to fortify it after it suffered considerable damage during the Scots raids in the early part of the 14th century.\n\nThe contract for the new church was awarded to Messrs Pattinson and Holmes (joiners) and masons Parkin and Nixons (the Nixons being father and son) with one of the conditions being that none of the old church should be incorporated in the new building, though it seems that this condition may only have applied to the exterior of the building as some of the oak beams in the new church tower appear to have been taken from the old church.\n\nConstructed to the same design as St. Michael’s in Workington and St. Cuthbert’s in Carlisle St. Mary’s was built of red sandstone from Shawk Quarry, Rosley, with the tower being raised about nine feet higher than originally planned so it might serve as a landmark. A new bell was cast by bellfounders William Mears & Co and in June 1790 it was transported from London to St. Mary’s at a cost of £3 19s; still in use and weighing 12.5 cwt it’s the biggest single bell of any parish church in Cumbria.\n\nTo meet the changing needs of its congregation and the people of Wigton St. Mary’s has seen many repairs and improvements over the years. In 1880/1881 the floor was remodelled and relaid with blocks, two new stained glass windows and a new heating system were installed, and the high box pews with their doors and brass name plates were removed and taken to the workshop of John and Daniel Pearson where they were converted into the open pews seen in the church today.\n\nThe first organ in the church is believed to have been a small barrel organ, later exchanged for a larger instrument which was in turn sold for £30 in 1859 to Causewayhead Church near Silloth. Thanks to the generosity of George Moore from nearby Mealsgate who personally paid the cost of £240 the second organ was replaced by a new 12-stop organ built by Gray & Davison, one of the leading London organ builders. This was situated in the West Gallery, the traditional site for church organs, but changing fashions meant that fifty years later its position was considered to be inconvenient.\n\nIn 1912 Harrisons of Durham built the current organ which was sited at the south east corner of the church within the space occupied by the former vestry. At a cost of £800 it was built much larger than its predecessor with two manuals, twenty stops and more than 1200 pipes, some of which came from the previous Gray & Davison organ. Harrisons were advised in their work by influential organ designer Colonel George Dixon of St. Bees and thanks to their combined expertise the organ was remarkably versatile.\n\nHarrisons have periodically maintained and tuned the organ since its installation, carrying out repairs in 1938, cleaning and renovation in 1977 and further repairs to the pneumatic action in 1994. Unfortunately in more recent years the organ became less reliable and a complete restoration was necessary; a scheme was proposed by Harrisons and approved by the Parochial Church Council and in 2011 the Centenary Restoration Appeal was launched. In 2012, 100 years after it was originally installed, the organ was granted a ”Historic Organ Certificate” by the British Institute of Organ Studies then in January 2013 it was dismantled and various parts were taken back to Harrisons in Durham. After extensive work and the meticulous cleaning of 1200 pipes the organ was rebuilt and returned to full working order in June that year, with the total cost of the rebuild standing at £120,000.\n\nIn 1928 the remaining original ornate box pew, formerly occupied by the owners of Highmoor House, was removed from the eastern end of the north aisle and twenty five years later a side chapel was installed in its place by the Reverend John Ford in memory of his mother. The chapel is dedicated to St. Catherine and behind the communion table is a reredos made of re-used carved oak panels of North German origin. In 1952, prior to the installation of the side chapel, the church interior was completely redecorated, with the midnight blue of the flat ceiling and the gold detailing on the decorative plaster roundels complementing the overall scheme.\n\nIn 1958 the whole of the church’s exterior, including the tower, was restored and improved with the work being carried out by Messrs John Laing of Carlisle, and during this time the bell was re-hung. Between 1973 and 1976 the vestries were modernised, the ceiling insulated and the whole building rewired which meant that further redecoration was necessary though this kept to the Reverend Ford’s original scheme. The following year a number of pews were removed from the back of the church to provide a space for social gatherings and informal activities then in 1985 the vicar’s vestry was repositioned to provide a space for a new kitchen.\n\nDesigned by R B Edmundson of Manchester and dedicated in 1865 the East window was donated by William Banks of Highmoor to celebrate the coming of age of his eldest son, though the centre section attracted widely differing opinions. Featuring Jesus blessing little children it was described as ‘fine Venetian glass’ by one person and ‘intensely ugly, portraying grotesque children’ by another, though William Banks had paid for the best which was available at the time.\n\nThroughout the life of the church there was never any serious attempt to install a complete ringing peal of bells until discussions in early 1996 resulted in the Parochial Church Council voting to pursue the possibility. A structural survey of the tower proved positive, estimates were obtained and early in 1997 an application was made to the Millennium Commission for a 50% grant; work then started to raise the remaining 50% and by the end of that year the Millennium funding was in place. An order for a new set of eight bells was placed with John Taylor, bellfounders in Loughborough and work was started on preparing the tower.\n\nIn 1998 a band of novice ringers started training and on February 19th 1999 the bells arrived in Wigton, being initially displayed in the church before being installed in the tower and tested on March 3rd. On Easter Sunday that year the new band of ringers rang the bells for the first time for the morning service and on May 1st the first full peal of 5,088 changes was rung by members of the Carlisle Diocesan Guild of Bell Ringers. New Year 2000 was rung in by the new local ringers and since then the bells have been rung regularly for services and special occasions. The original 12 cwt bell, standing in a steel frame and ball bearings, remains in the top stage of the tower and continues to be rung for funerals and to sound the hours every day.\n\nIn 2006 broadcaster and author Melvyn Bragg (Lord Bragg of Wigton) who grew up in the town, offered St. Mary’s the gift of three new stained glass windows, not only remembering his relatives past and present but also with a theme of bringing Wigton into the church and showing St. Mary’s as part of the community. Brian Campbell, a well known local artist, was chosen to design the windows and after many meetings with church authorities the designs were approved. Alex Haynes of Albion Glass, Brampton, created the stained glass and the windows were installed on the north side of the nave in July 2009.\n\nEach of the windows is filled with images of the town, the church and its people and the left hand window shows much of the commercial life of Wigton including the auction mart, mill, factory and a street with church. St. Mary’s church tower is the dominant feature in the centre window while the right hand window includes the George Moore fountain, Highmoor Tower, Nelson Tomlinson School, the cenotaph and the Caldbeck fells, and even though the windows are so modern they all contain Christian symbols.\n\nDuring the first few years of the 21st century it became apparent that the church roof was raining in and wasn’t in a good state of repair. Following meetings with architect Elaine Blackett-Ord it was agreed to apply to English Heritage for grants to help towards the cost of repairs and fund raising began in 2007. The contract was awarded to local firm RMT Slating & Tiling and work on the nave roof was completed first, with completion of the tower roof in 2010.\n\nSince it was built in the late 18th century each generation has contributed in some way to the present church and it’s hoped that those latest roof repairs will keep St. Mary’s waterproof for the forseeable future. It’s a lovely old building with many interesting features and after discovering it while I was doing the Wigton Heritage Trail in September I was glad I was able to look round and uncover some of its history.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSt. Augustine’s Church, Pendlebury\n\nWhile I was on my 2-week stay-cation last September, and on one of the area’s Heritage Open Days, I visited St. Augustine’s Church in Pendlebury, eight miles from home and an easy 20-minute drive heading towards Manchester. I’d never been there before but it had come to my attention the previous day and it sounded interesting so off I went.\n\nKnown locally as the ‘Miners’ Cathedral’ because of its vast cathedral-like proportions and its location in the heart of a one-time coal mining community St. Augustine’s came into being thanks to the generosity of one man, Edward Stanley Heywood, one of the family of Heywood Brothers who were influential Manchester bankers. Situated about five miles from the centre of Manchester the church was designed in 1870 by architect George Frederick Bodley (1827-1907) assisted by Thomas Garner, and construction started in 1871 with the foundation stone being laid in September that year. The completed building was consecrated in May 1874 and the total cost including decoration and furnishings was borne by Heywood himself. The church’s first vicar was Heywood’s brother-in-law Dr. Alfred Dewes who devoted his life to St. Augustine’s and remained there until his death in 1911.\n\nGeorge Frederick Bodley served as an apprentice architect for five years then at the age of 23 set up his own practice in 1850, eventually setting up a partnership with Thomas Garner in 1869, and it was during the later years of the 19th century that some of his finest churches were built. In designing St. Augustine’s Bodley had also designed a bell tower which was to be a free-standing structure linked to the church on the south side and standing higher than the main roof, but the ambitious project to build a church of cathedral proportions was extremely expensive and as Heywood considered the bell tower wasn’t essential the plan was abandoned and the money was used to provide a vicarage, school and gatehouse. The church itself was built of red brick, with a clay tiled roof and dressed stone for the windows and doorways, and the building’s dimensions measured 160ft long from east to west, 50ft wide and 80ft 2ins high at the ridge of the roof.\n\nAbove the main west doorway three niches contain the statues of St. Augustine flanked by the Angel Gabriel on the left and the Blessed Virgin Mary on the right, and high in the wall below the apex of the roof is a recess housing the single church bell. Above the porch doorway on the south west corner, which was originally the main entrance, are another three niches housing statues, with the centre one being Our Lord with his hand raised to bless those entering the church, and at each side are the carved 1874 date stones.\n\nBelow the window in the east wall is a memorial showing the Risen Christ and commemorating the 178 men and boys, the youngest only 13 years old, who lost their lives in a devastating underground explosion at the Clifton Hall Colliery on June 18th 1885; the bodies of the victims were buried in the grounds of several local churches with 64 of them being interred at St. Augustine’s. The churchyard also contains the war graves of twelve service personnel from WW1 and four from WW2 and is a favourite spot for tortoiseshell butterflies who continue to make the grounds their home.\n\nBefore opening for public worship it was Bodley’s express wish that St. Augustine’s was provided with chairs for the congregation rather than pews. This was not only from an appearance point of view but also to prevent the system of paid pew rents whereby the wealthy could have exclusive use of a particular pew for themselves, their family and friends. This system in other churches had often discouraged the poor from attending services as they could find themselves having to either stand up or sit on cold bare floors; there are seven rows of pews towards the front of the nave but these were later additions.\n\nAt the north west corner of the nave is the octagonal font, standing two steps above floor level. Each of its eight sides has an arched recess containing a shield, with four of the shields bearing the IHS monogram while the others have roses and fleur-de-lys. The font cover is a finely crafted piece of woodcarving and has a traceried lower section with three tiers above and an angel at the top.\n\nHigh up on eight of the internal buttresses in the nave are a series of elaborately carved and gilded frames containing paintings depicting several saints, and of these eight the front two on each side of the nave have been restored. The four on the north wall are saints Paul, Peter, Gregory and Augustine while those on the south wall are the Venerable Bede and saints Ambrose, Jerome and Augustine of Hippo; unfortunately bright sunlight shining on the paintings of Gregory and Augustine made them difficult to photograph successfully so I only got six out of the eight.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe square pulpit is carved in the 16th century style with ‘linen fold’ panelling on the three sides. A later addition was a shell-shaped ‘sounding board’ suspended above it from an iron bracket, this was to project the speaker’s voice into the nave; in 1929 it was described by a writer (unknown) as “an American contraption – very effective but also very ugly”. Church records show that it was installed during Bodley’s lifetime and it was known that its appearance reduced him to tears; fast forward to 1996 and it was removed after extensive consultations with everyone concerned.\n\nSpaced at intervals along the walls of the nave and continuing into the north and south choir isles are a series of carved wooden plaques, possibly later additions, telling the story of the Crucifiction; I photographed them all but there were far too many to include them all on here so I’ve selected just two.\n\nDividing the nave from the chancel is the oak rood screen, an elaborately carved design of Bodley’s with a wide central arch and six open sections with delicate tracery, surmounted by the base of the (incomplete) rood loft forming a deep canopy to the screen itself. Just in front and above the screen on the north side of the nave is the organ loft with its richly coloured and gilded organ case, again designed and crafted by Bodley; the organ itself was originally built by Brindley & Foster of Sheffield, later rebuilt with pneumatic action by Ernest Wadsworth & Co of Manchester then rebuilt with a detached console in the mid 1990s.\n\nThe doorway to the organ loft is on the opposite side of the nave to the organ and the door itself has large hinges depicting leaves and acorns, another example of Bodley’s meticulous attention to detail. Before the organ was rebuilt in the 1990s access to the console was gained by walking across the top of the rood screen, hazardous enough but made worse with the installation of a bank of heating pipes covering most of the canopy top. Although very effective in combating the cold down-draught they also prevented the use of the safety handrail, making the journey to the console doubly perilous, although a certain Dorothy Morris, St. Augustine’s organist for over 30 years, regularly made the hair-raising journey until she was well into her eighties.\n\nOn both sides of the chancel the ends of the rear choir stalls incorporate ten carved creatures, five on each side, and include a cockerel, a dog, and several mythological beasts. In the north choir isle behind the stalls is a small shrine while in the south choir isle is a permanent Lady Chapel with its own altar and seating for eight people, both created in the mid 1990s. The richly painted chancel ceiling was restored and repainted in 1971 but some later damage to the external roof resulted in water ingress which caused the paint to peel in several places, which seemingly hasn’t so far been rectified.\n\nBordered by gold vine leaf trail and completed with gilded cresting at the top the huge reredos fills the centre of the east wall while at each side the wall is lined with ‘linen fold’ oak panelling. The reredos itself is made up of 19 compartments containing a series of richly coloured paintings; each compartment has a traceried canopy and parts of some of the paintings are in relief. On the shelf at the bottom are six large candlesticks, four of which were dedicated in 1930; made in Milan they are copies of some 300-year old candlesticks situated where St. Peter’s Chair stands in Rome.\n\nThe design of the windows was closely supervised by Bodley, with the stained glass being done by Burlison & Grylls, a partnership set up in 1868 with the encouragement of Bodley himself and Thomas Garner. By the 1890s Burlison & Grylls was one of the most highly regarded stained glass firms in the country; thousands of their windows appeared in churches throughout Britain, with their most spectacular being the large rose window installed in 1902 in Poet’s Corner at Westminster Abbey.\n\nBodley’s opinion was that much of the stained glass of his period was spoiled by having too great a variety of colours so for St. Augustine’s he chose colour schemes to provide each window with just one dominant colour. The windows themselves are set high in the church walls, with their bases some 16 feet above floor level, and being so high it was impossible to get good clear shots of them; apparently the only way to fully appreciate the detail in each window is through binoculars.\n\nTucked in the south west corner of the nave and near the south porch door is a very small single window depicting the entrance of St. Augustine into Canterbury, and with the addition of a votive candle stand in 1996 this corner has become the Shrine of St. Augustine. Most of Bodley’s original furnishings and adornments remain largely unchanged and any alterations or additions which have been made over the years are very few.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nGeorge Frederick Bodley was a remarkable man. Architect, poet, musician and deeply religious he was remembered for his courtesy, his gentle personality and his amazing memory for detail – many years after visiting other churches he could still sit down and accurately draw detailed sketches of them. Pendlebury has changed greatly since 1874 and its generations have changed with it but St. Augustine’s remains in regular use, still standing at the heart of the community and a testament to the most accomplished and refined architect who designed and created it.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
