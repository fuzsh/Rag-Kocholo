        "text": "Marcus Hill, affectionately known as “Biggie” and “Coach Hill,” was born on March 8, 1972, in Sheffield, Alabama, to the late Donald Hill, Sr., and Wanda Thirlkill Hill.\n\nHe was the middle child of three siblings and known as the “favorite child.”\n\nMarcus confessed hope in Christ at an early age and joined First Missionary Baptist Church under the leadership of the late Reverend Rufus Slack, Jr.\n\nMarcus was a proud 1990 graduate of Sheffield High School where he excelled as a student athlete. He was a three-sport athlete for the Bulldogs, starting in football for three years and two years in both baseball and basketball. In basketball, he was selected to the All-Area Tournament Team as a sophomore, and All-County Team as a junior and senior. In baseball, he had a 365-batting average with nine home runs. A gifted athlete in basketball and baseball, it was on the gridiron that Marcus rose to an elite level as he\n\nwas a vital member of the football squad, leading an outstanding defense from his linebacker position with 195 solo tackles along with 88 assists. On offense, he ran the football 641 times for over 3000 yards with 56 touchdowns. Marcus was an All-State selection in his junior and senior season.\n\nAfter high school, he earned a football scholarship to the University of Louisville. During this time, he met so many wonderful colleagues that over time were like family. They helped instill the characteristics that helped him to build and set a foundation with many students throughout his training and teaching. The love that he had for Louisville has always remained in his heart.\n\nIn April of this year, he was inducted into the Colbert County Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nMarcus was employed through the Muscle Shoals City school system since 2009 where he coached basketball, football, and track. He had a limitless enthusiasm for helping others and a sincere love for kids. He was always willing to go the extra mile for anyone in need. Biggie’s warmth, dedication, and positive spirit touched the lives of everyone around him.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father, Donald Hill, Sr.; paternal grandparents, William and Mary Hill; maternal grandparents, Travis and Ethelyn Thirlkill; uncle, Roland Hill; special great-aunt, Mildred Smith; and numerous great-aunts and great-uncles.\n\nBiggie’s love and memories will forever be cherish by his family, especially his baby girl, A’Niya; mother, Wanda Thirlkill Hill of Sheffield, AL; brother, Donald “Donnie” Hill, Jr., and Kimberly (Freddie) Ingram of Madison, AL; aunts, Gloria Berry of Sheffield, AL, Mary (Albert) Jarmon of Muscle Shoals, AL, Dorothy (Oscar) Moore of Douglasville, GA, Carolyn (Willie) West of Florence, AL, Janice King of Muscle Shoals, AL, Janice T. Johnson of Florence, AL, and Lucy Oates; nephews, Jamarcus Jones and Jaydon Hill; niece, Jasmine Hill, all of Madison, AL; and a host of other relatives and friends.\n\nHis infectious smile would light up a room and will forever live in our hearts.\n\n“To know him was to love him.”"
