        "text": "The Orioles have tripled down on athletic college outfielders in the past three drafts. They have a clear rationale for taking Vance Honeycutt this year.\n\nA two-way player for two seasons in college, Steven Zobac has zoomed to Double-A in pro ball on the strength of his athletic ability.\n\nDrawn to his power and desire to improve, the Rangers drafted Stanford catcher Malcolm Moore in the first round.\n\nThe Reds don’t shy away from starting pitcher profiles in the first round. They used their draft lottery fortune to select their favorite pitcher in the 2024 draft.\n\nThe Twins are bought into 2023 third-rounder Brandon Winokur’s athleticism and power potential.\n\nPodcast hosts Carlos Collazo and Peter Flaherty discuss notable early pro debuts from the 2024 MLB draft class, summer 2025 standouts & more.\n\nChandler Simpson and Craig Yoho have the Hot Sheet Show’s attention, plus a deep dive on the state of high school recruiting.\n\nGeoff Pontes welcomes an experienced dynasty baseball manager onto the podcast to discuss potential buys and sells heading into next season.\n\nIn this week’s 90th Percentile Podcast, Geoff Pontes & Matt Pajak look into how athleticism and top speed are evaluated in MLB prospects.\n\nWith the trade deadline now passed, J.J. Cooper and Geoff Pontes lead a deep-dive discussion on the state of each NL West organization."
