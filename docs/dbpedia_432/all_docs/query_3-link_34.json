Bob currently chairs the board of Cleveland State University.\n\nChristian & Small Managing Partner Deborah Alley Smith's practice is focused on post-judgment and appellate litigation. She devotes her time to research and writing and to preparing her partners for trial to ensure that significant issues are preserved in the event of an appeal.\n\nAman Brar has an extensive background in leading technology companies through periods of high growth and has also held key corporate strategy and finance roles at Fortune 500 companies.\n\nInez and her husband are co-owners of On the Square, a restaurant, wine bar and retail store in Tarboro, NC.
