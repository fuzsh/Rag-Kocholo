[Montag fails to kill Sherry, who laughs maniacally after being disenboweled]

Montag the Magnificent: How dare you laugh! HOW DARE YOU!

Sherry Carson: [sits up] Look at ME now if you dare! Look into MY eyes!

Montag the Magnificent: [goes uneasy] What will I see there?

Sherry Carson: The past... and the future. Do you think you're the only one who deals an illusion?

Montag the Magnificent: You mean... you? You too?

Sherry Carson: I, too. And you... you are my illusion. You are no longer even here. You'll have to start your little charade all over again.

Montag the Magnificent: [stunned] But I... I... I am Montag!

[Montag suddenly finds himself back on stage all the way back to the beginning of the movie]

Montag the Magnificent: Yes! I am Montag, master of illusion! The fire of the laws of reason! What... is real? Are you certain you know what reality is?

[Sherry and Jack are seen within the audience]

Montag the Magnificent: How do you know that at this second you aren't sleeping in your beds dreaming that you are here sitting in this theater?

Sherry Carson: [whispers to Jack] You know what I think?

Jack: What?
