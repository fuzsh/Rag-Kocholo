[Montag fails to kill Sherry, who laughs maniacally after being disenboweled]

Montag the Magnificent:

How dare you laugh! HOW DARE YOU!

Sherry Carson:

[sits up] Look at ME now if you dare! Look into MY eyes!

Montag the Magnificent:

[goes uneasy] What will I see there?

Sherry Carson:

The past... and the future. Do you think you're the only one who deals an illusion?

Montag the Magnificent:

You mean... you? You too?

Sherry Carson:

I, too. And you... you are my illusion. You are no longer even here. You'll have to start your little charade all over again.

Montag the Magnificent:

[stunned] But I... I... I am Montag!

[Montag suddenly finds himself back on stage all the way back to the beginning of the movie]

Montag the Magnificent:

Yes! I am Montag, master of illusion! The fire of the laws of reason! What... is real? Are you certain you know what reality is?

[Sherry and Jack are seen within the audience]

Montag the Magnificent:

How do you know that at this second you aren't sleeping in your beds dreaming that you are here sitting in this theater?

Sherry Carson:

[whispers to Jack] You know what I think?

Jack:

What?

Sherry Carson:

I think he's a phony.

Montag the Magnificent:

[to the theater audience] I am Montag, master of illusion! The fire of the laws of reason! A magician if you will. But then... what is a magician? A person who tears asunder your rules of logic and crumbles your world of reality so you can go home and say: "Oh what clever tricks he has. What a sly deceiver"... and go to sleep in the security of your own, real world. [laughs] What is real? Are you certain you know what reality is? How do you know that at this second you aren't asleep in your beds dreaming that you are here in this theater? Ah, yes... it all seems too real. Well, haven't you ever had a dream that seems so very real... until you woke up? Then again, how do you know that you ever did wake up? In fact, perhaps when you thought you were waking up... you had actually just begun to dream! You see what I mean, don't you? All you lives... your pasts... your rules of what can or cannot be may all be part of one long dream from which you are about to awaken and discover the world as it really is!
