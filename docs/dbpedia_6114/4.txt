“Impossible to defend.” — John Waters

Before BASKET CASE and BAD TASTE, there was THE WIZARD OF GORE! Montag the Magnificent’s Grand Guignol nightclub act is making waves. But when his onstage tricks manifest in real life, it’s up to a reporter named Sherry to make sense of it all . . . or die trying. The crown jewel of the partnership between director H.G. Lewis (BLOOD FEAST) and writer/splatter FX artist Allison Downe (SHE-DEVILS ON WHEELS), THE WIZARD OF GORE is a sludge-horror carnival ride that retains the power to shock over forty years later. With its ferocious gore effects, experimental aesthetic, and annihilation of all earthly logic, this dream-like opus joins MULTIPLE MANIACS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD as one of the most unforgettable midnight movies in history. In the words of Montag, “Are you certain you know what reality is?”
