This document provides an introduction and overview of Deleuze and Guattari's concept of \"machinic materialism\" as presented in A Thousand Plateaus. It distinguishes their view from other forms of materialism and discusses how they conceive of the relationship between the abstract and concrete. Key points are that machinic materialism does not represent an objective reality, rules are not abstract invariants but develop the abstract, and performance is productive rather than aimed at reproducing competence or reality. The document also discusses the concepts of stratification and destratification in their work.",
