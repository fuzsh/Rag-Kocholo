        "text": "journal contribution\n\nposted on 2018-01-01, 00:00 authored by Vincent Le\n\nIn Nihil Unbound and other shorter works, Ray Brassier develops his contemporary transcendental realism by adopting the nihilistic aspects of thinkers such as Laruelle, Sellars and Badiou, while leaving behind their anthropic residuals. What is surprising is that Brassier has yet to publish any critical analysis of Nick Land despite their striking similarities and interactions at Warwick University (notwithstanding Brassierâs introduction to Landâs collected writings and a 2010 talk on Land). This paper aims to fill in this gap by showing how Brassier adheres to Landâs initial philosophy of the negative while rejecting its humanist political corollaries in favor of an epistemological turn to science. I will first show how Brassier adopts Landâs idea that we must come to terms with our future extinction as the transcendental condition for thinking a non-conceptual reality beyond our anthropic delusions of grandeur. Unlike Brassier, however, Land goes on to identify capitalismâs destructive processes as the organon for deathâs transcendental critique. Consequently, Landâs recent work develops a pro-capitalist, neoreactionary politics with deeply narcissistic tendencies insofar as it rests on gratifying individualsâ basest passions and greed. Conversely, Brassier maintains Landâs initial notion of death as the transcendental critique of anthropocentrism, but instead links it to cosmologyâs insight into the solar systemâs eventual demise beyond anthropic political processes within our control. Although Brassier thereby believes that he is able to appropriate Landâs useful conceptual resources for de-anthropomorthizing philosophy while stripping him of his humanist political remnants, this paper will conclude by drawing on the suggestions of Mark Fisher and Reza Negarestani to proffer a Landian rejoinder to Brassier: even if capitalism is anthropomorphic, it is necessary to politically fight against it rather than abandon politics altogether in favor of science, if only to rid science of its ideological servitude under the reign of capital.\n\nHistory"
