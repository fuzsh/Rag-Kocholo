        "text": "I think the best answer is the comment from conifold\n\nChurchland is a prominent eliminative physicalist, so she believed the conclusion even before much of neuroscience data became available, her Neurophilosophy dates back to 1986. A successful completion of the physicalist programme (finding precise physical correlates to mental phenomena) would be a strong evidence for materiality of \"souls\", but unfortunately we are very far removed from that (and there are doubts that it is feasible even among materialists). For challenges see SEP's Philosophy of Neuroscience. – Conifold Nov 30 at 22:52\n\n(@conifold: if you would like the credit/points, let me know and I'll delete this answer so you can answer the question)\n\nAnother work I think I'll check out is Patricia Churchland's relatively recent book: Touching a Nerve: the Self as Brain. I guess that's about the best I can do at this point (as a layperson in neuroscience).\n\nNeuroscience and cognitive science correlate the mental to the neural and genetic alterations or neural energy movements. But it may not be correct to say that there is evidence in neuroscience that mind does not exist. The conclusion seems more towards the view that mind and soul (or say self-awareness or consciousness or life) is produced by organized bio matter called the brain provided it is alive\n\nDr. Nuland Sherwin B writes awareness is distributed through neural, endocrine and circulatory systems; awareness is there in every cell.1 There are many \"molecular selves\" in the human body, which produce the richness and variety of human life. It is by awareness that integration and coordination of the organism is possible not only down to organ level but to cellular and intra cellular level. In any given instant, in any cell, millions of molecular interactions are taking place and the single product of all such interaction of organisms is life.2 Dr.V.S.Ramachandran thinks the brain generates a sense of self-awareness for experiencing.3\n\nDr. Kandel writes the notion that the brain stores an internal representation of the outside world has been accepted in modern cognitive psychology, but how it happens is still an unanswered question.4To me it seems that in the minds of neuroscientists, the puzzle that bothers them is how the material phenomena of movements and changes in the brain lead to creation in the mind, of perceived mental phenomena of the world of objects and bodies, based on the sensory information which comes in. A further question that arises is how this world is brought into consciousness which is located in the mind.\n\nIn neuroscience, as per evidence gathered by Dr. Libet, action is known in the mind after it happens. 5\n\nNobel Laureate Eric Kandel writes that studies of the sense of touch and its representation in the cortex provide evidence of the internal representation (as creation by the brain) of the body surface and also of peripersonal space. Attentiveness is a factor in integrating the representation of the body with sense impressions of vision and movement. It allows a representation of the personal space to be integrated with a representation of extra personal space. Thus, representation of the body relates to representation of visual space. It is within this integrated representation that the conscious self functions.6\n\nThe evidence points to life lived by person in the mind in a world in the mind. It is as if the world around the body is outside a mind. As per experimental evidence of Dr Libet, action happens by exercise of an imagined freewill after the thought of action appears in the mind and the action is known in the mind. It is so even when body is in wakeful state. The actions are not known in the mind after the instant action happens.\n\n1 Nuland Sherwin B., How we live Vintage books, N.Y.1997. chapter 5 'The fundamental unit of life, the cell' pp 118, 121-123.\n\n2 ibid.
