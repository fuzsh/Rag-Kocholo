        "text": "Ray Brassier’s contribution to Contemporary Philosophical Naturalism.\n\nNominalism, the denial of abstract entities, is usually tied to empiricism. Hence, the critique of empiricism is usually seen as entailing a critique of nominalism; but we need to preserve nominalism’s insight that the belief in abstract entities is a new version of theology’s preestablished harmony between mind and world. How can we use language and concepts to describe the world, if they do not have that preestablished harmony? Or, in other words, we need to explain how propositionally structured thought can arise and track a non-propositionally structured nature.\n\nThis is the challenge Wilfrid Sellars’s naturalism wants to tackle. While dismissing the idea that the mind mirrors nature, he thinks post-Galilean science is a major cognitive advance, and so seeks a naturalistic rationalism to complete the Enlightenment. Brassier says, “Properly understood, his attack on the myth of the given disqualifies conceptual idealism and provides the precondition for an unapologetically transcendental realism.” (Brassier 2014, 102)\n\nSellars’s version of naturalism depends on a metalinguistic nominalism, which is what links his critique of the given and his realism.\n\nThe Problem of Critical Ontology\n\nOntology is the attempt to answer the question “What is there?” However, the ontological version of this question cannot be answered by a list of names, such as table and chair. A list does not explain what a name is or how it relates to its object, and we need to explain how we know what there is. Even with these Kantian strictures, Sellars thinks naming is a key part of language; it is normative in the sense that there are right names and wrong names. Importantly, this normativity is not primarily about meaning but about material processes: “The names in which linguistic signification finds its ultimate ‘aboutness’ do not signify; they are material patterns” (Brassier 2014, 102). This makes Sellars’s idea of reference both dialectical and materialist: signification gains its autonomy by being grounded in nonsignifying patterns.\n\nAny answer to the question of what exists also implies an answer to the question of what categories are. The standard controversy over categories is whether they are mind-independent or mind dependent. Sellars refuses both options; he says they are a linguistic function which represents reality. Determining categorical status depends on identifying conceptual place; so “To specify an entity’s category will be to determine certain logico-semantic feature of representation such that it is of that entity” (Brassier 2014, 103). However, representation is not a conceptual relation, or a relation between concepts and things. It is this nonconceptual account of representation that makes his account nontraditional, and materialistic in a methodological sense rather than a metaphysical sense.\n\nImportantly, because categories do not designate features of the world, they are not phenomenologically intuitable, which means they cannot be read off the structure of language or reality. To assume otherwise is to accept the myth of the given.\n\nThe Myth of the Given\n\nThe myth of the given has epistemic and categorial elements. It is basically rooted in the confusion of thinking with sensing, and appears in this inconsistent triad:\n\nX senses red sense content S entails X knows noninferentially that s is red.\n\nThe ability to sense sense contents is unacquired.\n\nThe ability to know facts of the form x is ø is acquired.\n\nOne can only affirm any two of these statements.\n\nBrassier quickly summarizes Sellars’s argument. Knowledge is about facts, and facts have propositional form, such as x is ø. Now, can we sense facts? An ability to sense facts would be either acquired or unacquired. If it is acquired, then it cannot be a sensory capacity, since by hypothesis the ability to sense is unacquired. But if facts can be sensed, then sensation has to have a propositional form; to say that we sense facts is to say that sensation mirrors a reality that already has propositional form, which would be tantamount to saying there is a pre-established intelligible order. Then we would have to explain the apparent congruence between the sensible order and the intelligible order. If the ability to sense facts is unacquired, then it cannot be explained in terms of natural selection, so the congruence between the two must either be left unexplained or explained by supernatural factors.\n\nAs stated, we can only choose two of the triad’s possibilities. Sellars says (A) is false: sensing that something is red does not mean we know, noninferentially, that it is red. The noninferential, or apparently immediate, knowledge that the table is red is a conceptually mediated perception, not a sensible intuition. This conceptual perception is mediated by a conceptual framework of objects which relate to one another in public space and time.\n\nIf we conflate thinking and sensing, as (A) asks us to do, we arrive at the myth of the categorial given, which says the categorial structure of reality impresses itself upon us. Or in other words, it conflates sensing with sensing as: it conflates sensing a table with sensing something as a table. The problem is, to be aware of something as being under a category is not to be aware of it as the category; to sense the object as a table is to use the concept of table, and the use of concepts is rule-governed. Rule following is thinking, and thinking cannot be reduced to sensing: “Thinking cannot touch the real: it belongs to a different order. But as we shall see, this does not oblige us to deny that we can successful think about the real, or deny that thinking is necessarily embedded within reality. Sensation is of the real but cannot be about it. Thinking is about the real but cannot enter into direct contact with it” (Brassier 2014, 104).\n\nBefore explaining how we should think about thinking after abandoning the myth of the given, we need to explain why this abandonment does not entail skepticism. Skepticism in fact presupposes the myth of the epistemic given: it has to assume that appearances come with their own categorial determinations, even while it questions the link between appearance and reality. It has to presuppose knowledge of appearances even while it casts doubt on them. Further, it cannot explain why there are appearances at all. Once we drop the idea of the epistemic given, “it becomes necessary to admit that sensing as already presupposes knowledge of a structured domain of interrelated objects existing in a framework of space and time” (Brassier 2014, 104). Thinking and sensing are oriented towards the world, just in different ways.\n\nIt has become a cliche to say that the mind is externalized in the world as a consequence of linguistic activity, as Heidegger and Wittgenstein argued. Sellars also accepts this, but situates this claim in a broader account of the place of mind in nature.\n\nThe concept of inner-thought episodes is modelled on public “sayings-out-loud.” Basically, the ability to apperceive our mental states is acquired, not given. Or in other words, the ability to perceive that I am thinking about a table is a capacity rooted in linguistic practice.\n\nThis is not the claim that thought is reducible to the verbal. It is the claim that when it comes to knowing, speaking is prior to thinking; but when it comes to being, thinking is prior to speaking. Nonverbal thought is real, but the ability to think about these thoughts is linguistically mediated.\n\nThis is also not the claim that thought causes speech. It is more like the relation between molecules and gas. Molecules do not cause the volume of gas; they compose it. It is the same with thought and speaking. For a thought to be a thought, it must be capable of being a “saying-out-loud,” even if no such saying takes place.\n\nIn contrast with transcendental accounts of any kind, thought is not an originary intentionality which then appears in language. Intentionality is a property of public speech established metalinguistic resources which allow a group to talk about talk. Since intentionality is a linguistic phenomenon, we need to see the consequences for meaning as regards both mind and nature.\n\n“Means” Talk\n\nBrassier now turns to explaining this metalinguistic nominalism.\n\nSellars says semantic operators such as “means,” “stands for,” and “designates” correlate the function of familiar words with unfamiliar words. Hence, the semantic statement “Rouge means red”, means is a special version of the copula. The statement quotes a sign-design and correlates it with the familiar word red.\n\nSellars use a dot-quoting device to exhibit this function. So: “Rouge in French is a •red• in English” says that the sign-design “Rouge” plays the same linguistic role in French that “red” does in English. The colour “red” is not being mentioned here. Instead, the word is being used as an “illustrating sortal in a metalinguistic assertion.” This is what the dot-quotes exhibit.\n\nIn a statement like “A triangulaire is a •triangular•, triangulaire functions as a distributive singular term, rather than an abstract noun. It works just like “the lion” in “The lion is tawny”; here, tawny is not predicated of an abstract entity like lionhood, but of each particular lion in space and time. So on a metalinguistic level, we can treat “triangulaire” and “rouge” as distributive singular terms and correlate them with the metalinguistic sortals •red• and •triangular•.\n\nThe next step is to write “Rouge’s are •red•s” and “Triangulaires are •triangular•s to indicate that was is being correlated are particular linguistic tokenings rather than abstract linguistic types. We pluralize them to show that both distributive singular terms and metalinguistic sortals indicate patterns of tokenings rather than the names of abstract types.\n\n(This is unclear to me: could we rephrase this as saying that the distributive singular terms and the metalinguistic sortals refer to particular things in space and time, not categories?)\n\nIn order for this nominalist strategy to work, this has to be about particular tokenings, not abstract types.\n\nThis same metalinguistic strategy can help us explain why abstract singular terms do not designate abstract entities. Consider the abstract singular term “redness.” It is a mistake to take this as the name of an abstract entity, because the meaning of statements involving “redness” can be reworked using only the predicate “red.” So, “A exemplifies redness” is the same thing as “A is red.” To say this is not true is to say that “. . . exemplifies redness” means something other than “. . . is red,” and this would entail that “exemplification” is also the name of an abstract entity, the “exemplifcation nexus” through which the object is supposed to be connected to redness. If we attach this metaphysical appendage to ordinary usage, we end up a regress. We will always need another abstract relation term to explain the relation between the particular, the universal, and their relation.\n\nPicturing as Representation\n\nSellars’s nominalism is attached to his transcendental realism, which means we need to explain the connection between metalinguistic sortals and extralinguistic reality. The link is his theory of picturing: “The metalinguistic properties of sign-design tokens picture the nonlinguistic properties of objects” (Brassier 2014, 107). This picturing is not a semantic relation, that is, it is not a relation between a signifying concept and a nonsignifying object. Rather, it is a nonconceptual correspondence between two objects in the natural-physical order, and this correspondence is what he calls representation.\n\nSo representation is a relation between objects which are spatiotemporal particulars. The metalinguistic function of a sortal like •red• correlates with a “real,” nonlinguistic physical property, but the property is not named by “red”; instead, it is pictured by its syntactical role. When we predicate red of a, the token “red” does not designate the property red. Rather, it is its syntactical concatenation, or interconnection, with the name a that explains the connection to the extralinguistic property. Brassier offers a long quote from Sellars to explain this:\n\nIn general the nominalist holds that there is no thing which ‘red’ stands for because it stands for red things and red things is not a thing. Now it is a truism that the concatenation of ‘red’ with ‘a’ tells us that a is red. But is this fact illuminated by the idea that ‘a’ is correlated with a and ‘red’ with red things? I think not. To understand what is going on, we need a different perspective on the syntactical form of ‘red a.’ I submit that it is properly viewed, not as a concatenation of two referring expressions, but rather as a name, ‘a,’ which has the character of being concatenated to the left with a case of the sign-design (flatus vocis) ‘red.’ If we abbreviate the expression\n\nConcatenated to the left with a ‘red’\n\nby\n\nred*\n\nwe can say with respect to a token, t, of ‘red a’ that while superficially t is a\n\n‘red’ ^ ‘a’\n\ni.e. a ‘red’ concatenated with an ‘a’; its true form, its depth grammar, so to speak, is given by\n\nt is a red* [‘a’]\n\nThe first thing to note here is that I do not understand the line breaks, and I wonder if they are a printing error. Regardless, Brassier glosses this as saying that metalinguistic properties picture real properties through the syntactical configuration of sign-design tokens.\n\nI need to work this out in my own. Generally, nominalism says there is no thing which red stands for because red thing is not a thing. The connection of “red” and “table”, as in “red table” tell us that the table is red, but this is not because “table” and table are correlated. “Red table” is not a connection between two referring phrases, but should be seen as a name, “table”, being left of the sign-design “red.” We can abbreviate “interconnected to the left with “red” by red*, and then can use a token, t, to get the superficial formula ‘red’ ^ ‘a’, but the true form is “t is a red* [a’]”.\n\nThe table is is marked by the signs “red” and “table” being interconnected in a particular syntactical form? This is very unclear to me.\n\nGenerally, Sellars says the role played by relational expressions and empirical predicates can be reconstructed without turning them into abstract entities. He takes this from Wittgenstein’s Tractatus, in which Wittgenstein claims that we can say that aRb by placing the names “a” and “b” in a dyadic relation. The R shows they are in relation, but we can do this without any symbol for R: consider the statement “a is larger than b.” We can actually graphically inscribe this without any use of a relational term (R, or “is larger than”):\n\na\n\nb\n\nThis inscription says “a is larger than b” without using a relational expression. “b”’s being below “a” plays the role of having “is larger than” between them: “Thus both the ‘is larger than’ and ‘b’’s being below ‘a’ are functioning here as inscriptions, which is to say graphic objects, rather than as signifying expressions” (Brassier 2014, 108).\n\nIn the same way, the statement “x is red” can be written X. The way the name “x” is inscribed tells us what property it has. Sellars’s fundamental claim is that predicates do not play an independent role in expressions. He says, “Not only are predicative expressions dispensable, the very function played by predicates is dispensable.”\n\nIt is a mistake to abstract the predicate’s role from the role of the expressions they take place in. This abstraction is what encourages the mistake of saying that predicates designate conceptual properties or metaphysical attributes, which is the dilemma of mind-dependent or mind-independent categories. Predicates are a predicative role and do not exist outside sentential contexts, and do not exist independently of language. Sellars says, “The extralinguistic domain consists of objects, not facts. To put it bluntly, propositional form belongs only in the linguistic and conceptual orders.”\n\nBrassier says:\n\n“In the final analysis, conceptual functions are linguistically incarnated in sign-designs whose material characteristics picture objects. Semantic functions are nothing independently of this incarnation. But crucially picturing itself is not a semantic relation or function. Sellars describe it as a ‘second-order isomorphism’ between objects in the natural order: thus a CD pictures a piece of music via a complex transcoding of information from one physical medium into another. What lies at the core of Sellars’s nominalism is the idea that conceptual signification bottoms out in picturing.” (Brassier 2014, 109)\n\nNaming and Picturing\n\nThe rejection of the myth of the given does not lead to linguistic idealism and the claim that reality is a linguistic construct: “Rather, it is the cornerstone of a critical ontology in which language is embedded in a nonlinguistic, a-signifying reality that is devoid of propositional form” (Brassier 2014, 109). Hence, his nominalism is part of his naturalism and materialism. His naturalism states that linguistic practice is a variety of natural process which science investigates. That linguistic activity is a distinct natural process is part of his Kantianism.\n\nHis materialism stems from his insistence that natural processes extend beyond the organic realm: “To be a materialist is to refuse to organicize nature—that is, to use the organism as an explanatory paradigm for the whole of reality” (Brassier 2014, 109). His materialism is nonmetaphysical because while language is rooted in both the organic and the inorganic, its material patterns are perceptible. They are sounds, marks, and spacings, or what he calls “natural-linguistic objects.” These objects are names that depict parts of reality, and these names are part of the natural order insofar as they are meaningless.\n\nReference is not a semantic relation, and representation is not an epistemic relation; they are both natural functions.\n\nA general theory of representation would have to distinguish between sensate and insensate versions of representation, which would involve distinguishing between propositional and conceptual forms.\n\nBasic animal representational systems are nonconceptual, and has two aspects: referring and characterizing. The representation of an object being red is doing through a characterizing inscription, so both reference and characterization are “syntactically encapsulated,” that is, it is a syntactic rather than semantic relation.\n\nBrassier concludes this section by saying:\n\nSyntactical form is realized in the neurobiological properties of the nervous systems of sentient organisms. in this regard, propositional form is prelinguistic and more fundamental than logical or conceptual form. Logical form is inaugurated once representational systems can represent relations of association, compatibility, and incompatibility between representations. Full-blown conceptual form is achieved only once metarepresentation relays propositional structures endowed with the rich predicative resources of a natural language, which supervenes on but is irreducible to the coding procedures of a representational system. (Brassier 2014, 110)\n\nIn other words, representation is initially a syntactical form that exists in the neurobiological systems of animals, and is prelinguistic. Logical form appears when the system can relate propositions to one another, and conceptual form appears once syntactical propositional structures are overlaid with the predicative resources of natural language.\n\nPatterns and Processes\n\nAt the basic level, linguistic practice is anchored in names that picture objects as being somehow. This somehowness is shown, not said, by the way the names are inscribed. An inscription is not itself a statement, but a physical pattern. The point of this is that conceptual properties do not designate ways of being, but are still rooted in actings of representing that picture reality in ways that can be said from within the conceptual order, and be more or less adequate. Pictorial adequacy has to work with current conceptual resources, but it can still be used to track the correlation, or lack of thereof, between concepts and real patterns.\n\nHence categories are embedded in and conditioned by natural functions, and conceptual function is not a correspondence between a concept and an object. In other words, meaning is not a relation between a concept and an object, but between an object and an object. The fundamental level of language is a pattern-governed connection between linguistic objects and other physical objects: “Words do not depict reality because of what they mean but because of physical connections between the semantic regularities obeyed by speakers and the physical patterns in which these semantic regularities are embodied” (Brassier 2014, 110-111).\n\nThe relation between ‘man’ and man appeared in the uniformities that constitute pattern governed language use, and these patterns reflect the principles of linguistic competence. Brassier says, “Ultimately, categories are to be explained in terms of metalinguistic role. Metalinguistic role is to be explained in terms of correct representing. Correct representing is to be explained in terms of picture” (Brassier 2014, 111).\n\nConclusion\n\nRemember the three elements of a critical ontology: what is a name, how do names relate to objects, and what kinds of things exist, and what are kinds?\n\nA name is a sign-design, a linguistic object, with material characteristics. A name’s tokens correlate with patterns of objects in accordance with rules.\n\nA name relates to its object because a name has both a semantic and a material dimension. Semantically, they name because of their rule-governed linguistic role. Materially, they are a-signifying objects that picture other objects through their sensible characteristics.\n\nKinds are metalinguistic sortals, which correspond to the rule governed-use of tokens, and what kinds exist is a matter of empirical inquiry, aiming at an absolute picture of the world.\n\nLeft-Sellarsians have said we do not have an adequate criterion of picturing to gauge our closeness to this absolute picture of the world. Brassier responds to that charge by quoting Jay Rosenberg: “the absolute numerical magnitude of the correction factors which must be introduced into applications of the strict counterparts of predecessor laws to arrive at the values determined by their successors.” This helps us gauge our current picture’s approximation to the ideal of a full empirical picture of the world.\n\nIn other words, we can gauge our closeness to the absolute world picture by comparing the distance between past and current theories? This is not clear to me.\n\nIn addition, we can move our world picture towards the ideal by “projecting categories into a successor theory through the construction of analogical models with counterpart properties” (Brassier 2014, 112).\n\nSellars’s “methodological materialism” lies in the claim that the dimensions of picture vary with the matter-of-factual qualities; it is that set of qualities that give sis our coordinates for the material world. Basically this implies that whatever conceptual properties are used to describe the world lay open to fundamental revision. This fallibilism is what separates him from dogmatic or metaphysical materialists. So while empirical theory is a self-correcting enterprise, Sellars’s rationalistic naturalism reserves a place for philosophy: “Its task is not only to anatomize the categorial structures proper to the manifest and scientific images respectively but also to propose new categories in light of the obligation to explain the status of conceptual rationality within the natural order. Thus philosophy is not the mere underlaborer of empirical science; it retains an autonomous function as legislator of categorial revision” (Brassier 2014, 112).\n\nSellars’s example of a category given by philosophy is the “pure process,” which is used to explain the link between conceptual categories and material patterns. Conceptual transformations track material patterns, without simply mirroring them.\n\nImportantly, any ontological category, such as pure process, is first postulated by philosophy and then evaluated and investigated for their explanatory power, and are open to future empirical revision."
