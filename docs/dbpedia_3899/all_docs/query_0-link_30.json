        "text": "In regard to the two reasons for the assumed “dislike” of Zizek, I think you provide two valid reasons, but not an exhaustive list obviously. I assume you weren’t trying to provide such, but I think you left out a crucial element of dislike found mostly among academics, but certainly not limited to them. Namely, Zizek’s inability to present a tight and concise argument. Often times it seems that Zizek has even confused himself when he switches quickly from asserting theoretical claims (without arguing for them is the standard critique) to, in the very next paragraph, providing an example, the connection or meaning of which is left up to the reader to conjure. I’m thinking of the opening to Parallax View as his latest example: An existentialist, even Heideggarian element lurks in the first paragraph after which he switches to a brief (though nicely articulated) definition of “parallax object”, then to ramblings on objet petit a, then to F. Scott Fitzgerald, etc. The impatient reader will immediately dismiss Zizek as a loon whose unsubstantiated remarks are the stuff of a stand-up comedian, as is evidenced from his lectures wherein he repeats the same jokes, yet continues to find them comical. I disagree with the impatient reader inasmuch as connections can be made between his transitions, but not without a certain leeway on the part of the reader. So, I’d add to the standard dislike of Zizek his method of presentation, which, it is assumed, and quite rightly in many instances, he simply makes assertions, not arguments, and therefore cannot be taken seriously as a philosopher. Because he’s not tied to a specific University where he keeps regular office hours and advises students, does this have any effect? Many view Zizek, as they do Terry Eagleton, as an academic opportunist, applying Lacan to anything from which he can make a buck.\n\nFrom your title, Why Zizek Matters, I was looking for something that would tell me why he matters….why should I keep reading Zizek? Will he offer anything new outside of some admittedly brilliant Lacanian readings of film, literature, etc. Is that what matters? He reminds me a bit of the band Mars Volta…they are undeniably brilliant, and weave some amazing theoretical tools through their work, but it remains unfocused. if they could only channel their creative energy something profound would emerge. I feel the same about Zizek….does he hate writing so much they he can’t maintain attention for longer than a paragraph? And if he can manage to do so, I think we’ll see something great. Sublime Object, Tarrying With the Negative, Ticklish Subject, and Parallax View are, doubtless, his most sustained and reasoned works, and at this point, I’m willing to stick with them as foundational texts for Zizek’s thought. But, again, why DOES Zizek matter? This post seems Zizekan in this sense that it doesn’t offer anything positive….it doesn’t tell us anything about Why. Did you prefer not to tell us? If so, why?\n\n“What makes Žižek important is the simple fact that he approaches the topic of subjectivity and freedom (among other issues) by using psychoanalysis as a lense to examine German Idealism, and that this analysis allows for, and even encourages, a theory of the subject that takes into account but manages to narrowly escape, the scientifically fueled determinism of our age.”\n\nWhy is this so important? I understand why the latter claim is important because without freedom (of some kind) Zizek’s entire “system” would lose everything…his tentative construction of a radical politics wouldn’t be too radical without freedom.\n\nJust some initial reactions to your post to which I hope you’ll engage in a response.\n\nI think reference to the introduction of _Parallax_ is pretty cheap – it’s an introduction. Do you expect him to make a 400 page book comprehensible in the 20 he opens up with? It looks like he’s jumping from idea to idea there because he is – he’s talking about the different ideas that appear in the next 6 chapters.\n\nAlong the same lines, it’s of note that the intros to his books are very short. I don’t think it’s out of place here to point to the lack of introduction to Lacan’s Seminars – he more or less just launches into it. And it’s because of how Zizek (and I think Lacan) see the relation between theory and practice. He can’t just tell you the theory, because it’s abstract. It has to birth itself through existing literature and events (or for Lacan Math and literature – he generally doesn’t talk about his case studies because ‘you had to be there’ – i.e. there’s a difference between transmittable knowledge and ‘know-how’).\n\nThis might sound ‘idealist’, or simply empty talk, but take a look at what Lukacs says about Lenin and Luxemberg: They’re called Marxist _literature_ because they take into account what people are talking about and what’s going on in the world, not just coming up with a theory out of the blue… Marx, of course, did the same thing.\n\nAnd that’s another reason ‘Zizek is important’. People generally leave out the fact that he’s declared 2001 the advent of his ‘Leninist turn’. He’s not just talking philosophy, he’s attempting to revitalize some standard Marxist categories which can then be turned into political praxis…\n\nand refined.\n\nWhich of course opens the door to the ‘Why isn’t he politically active now?’. The answer he gives is that current thought has left out the destruction of Capitalism as a viable option, and these ‘presuppositions’ are what enable people to act in the first place. Attacking these foundations (he hopes) will open some doors for action.\n\nWhich is, of course, part of the reason he doesn’t have a political program. He’s in a position to attack thought, but has no idea what the exact conditions in my neck of the woods are. It’s for people to take up thought and make something of it…\n\nA sustained reading of Zizek shows that the examples and thoughts are not just random, that they do form an argument. For example the first section of parallax approaches freedom through the question of how capitalism functions (Chapter 1) and what the structure of democracy is (Chapter 2), culminating in what ‘freed choice’ looks like (Interlude 1). The problem, as everyone knows, is that you tend to remember the examples more than the argument. (I could go on about how exmaples work for Zizek, but this is too long as it is). The trick is to read it more than once so that examples attract less attention and the ideas become clearer.\n\nCriticizing him by saying he doesn’t have a linear argument is like attacking Marx because the first chapter is too abstract. Marx repeats his procedure over and over, getting more concrete as he goes along. It’s only the whole picture (the whole book…plus the others!) that makes a coherent argument. Same goes for Zizek. If you only read the Intro to Parallax you won’t get it. If you read the whole book (a few times…) you’ll begin to see why the art on the book is such that it is: Party as Analyst. (Lenin in Lacan’s seat)…"
