        "text": "Ray Brassier’s contribution to #Accelerate.\n\nThis essay is about how we can, or even should, collectively orient ourselves to the future. Giving up on the future essentially means to give up on the intellectual project of the Enlightenment. There are plenty of thinkers who argue we should do exactly this. Some on the Right wish to reinstate old hierarchies according to natural or divine orders. On the other hand, there are Left thinkers who say the best we can hope for are small-scale rectifications of universal injustice. This scaling down of ambition is a result of the collapse of communism as a Promethean project. The best we can hope for is local justice, and the idea of remaking the world according to ideals of justice and equality is seen as a dangerous totalitarian fantasy.\n\nThese Left and Right thinkers share a presupposition: they draw a direct line from the Galilean rationalization of nature to the evils of totalitarianism.\n\nBrassier will argue that the main epistemic virtue of the Enlightenment “consists in recognizing the disequilibrium which time introduces into knowing” (470). This disequilibrium forces time to be out of joint and restructures the linear succession of past, present, and future. This is what Hegel called “tarrying with the negative,” and it is the process of understanding. Understanding is the faculty of opposition, and reason is the faculty of conciliation. The understanding objectifies and discriminates, and it is the first exercise of the power of the negative that is eventually taken over by reason.\n\n“This is indispensable to cognition: before we can presume to overcome an opposition, we first have to be capable of articulating it correctly” (470). We cannot simply oppose reason to understanding, or contradiction to judgment: they are dialectically indissociable.\n\nWe need a way of defending the normative grounds which allow us to assert that disequilibrium is an enabling condition of cognitive progress. Or in other words, “We have to defend the normative status of the claim that things are not as they should be, and that things ought to be understood and reorganized” (470). To do this requires that we defend the question, ‘What can we make of ourselves?”\n\nBrassier wants to propose that Prometheanism requires the reassertion of subjectivism, but a subjectivism without selfhood, which amounts to an autonomy without voluntarism.\n\nThe basic critique of Prometheanism is tied to a critique of metaphysical voluntarism, found especially in Heidegger. His critique of voluntarism is used by Jean-Pierre Dupuy in his critique of transhumanism and technological human enhancement.\n\nPrometheanism is not an antiquated metaphysical fantasy because it is very much alive in the NBIC convergence, the way in which nano-, bio-, and information technology converge with cognitive science in a potential transformation of civilization. This Prometheanism is one of the Right: its advocates champion neoliberal capitalism. Despite this, NBIC makes possible the technological re-engineering of human nature.\n\nDupuy says that the utilitarian prejudices of bioethics prevent it from understanding the ontological elements in the uses and abuses of NBIC. The advocates of NBIC conflate ontological indetermination with epistemic uncertainty; they convert an ontological problem about the structure of reality into a problem of the limits of knowledge.\n\nThe story goes that the outcome of human creative activity is ontologically indeterminate because it is conditioned by the structure of human existence, which is finite transcendence. Basically, humans are not like other entities in the world because their way of being is a structure of temporal projection in which past, present, and future are reciprocally articulated. The confusion between epistemic uncertainty and ontological indeterminacy is based on confusing the human condition, devoid of essence, with human nature, which has an essence that can be defined in its differences from other entities. So, the metaphysical tradition defines man as an animal, with some predicate or another like “rational” or “speaking”. But for Heidegger, humans are not just different in kind: they are an other kind of difference altogether, which he calls existence.\n\nFor Dupuy, the failure to understand the difference between existence and essence leads us to believe that we can modify human nature using the same techniques that we have used to modify other entities. “The levelling of human existence onto a fixed catalogue of empirical properties blinds us to the existential difference between what is proper and improper for human beings to become (which Heidegger called ‘authenticity’ and ‘inauthenticity’). It is this levelling that underlies claims about the radical malleability of human nature” (473).\n\nDupuy combines the condition/nature distinction with Arendt’s account of the interplay between what is given to humans, and what is made by them. Arendt says that certain conditions are given to us, we can use these conditions to make new conditions, which in turn can themselves condition us. Dupuy thinks we should be able to do this while respecting a “fragile equilibrium” between the made and the given. This idea that we ought to respect the relation between the made and the given is fundamental to the philosophical critique of Prometheanism, since Prometheanism threatens this relation.\n\nArendt thinks humans cannot know themselves like they can know objects, and nothing suggests we have an essence like other things.\n\nThe claim that humans cannot objectify themselves has its roots in Heidegger’s radicalization of Kantian finitude. For Kant, we cannot know the world the way God does because, unlike us, God has intellectual intuition: his knowledge creates the objects. “His is an infinite generative intelligence whose making is unconstrained by any given” (475). Our knowledge, on the other hand, is constrained because it is a combination of what our minds make along with what is given through our senses.\n\nHeidegger ontologizes this; he turns it into an ontological datum, rather than an epistemic condition. Because existence is a finite transcendence, it conditions the cognizability of objects, and since cognitive objectification is conditioned by human existence, humans cannot know themselves as they know objects. Doing that would require objectifying the conditions of objectification, which as Arendt said, would be like jumping over our own shadow. Every attempt to positively characterize human nature—psychological, anthropological, and so on—is ultimately metaphysical (and hence also theological).\n\nFrom this perspective, the claim that we can radically reengineer humans are metaphysicians reifying the transcendence of existence. For example, the young Marx’s claim that conscious activity constitutes the species character of man would be seen as a reification of transcendence.\n\nBrassier quotes Arendt:\n\n“This future man, whom the scientists tell us they will produce in no more than a hundred years, seems to be possessed by a rebellion against human existence as it has been given, a free gift from nowhere (secularly speaking), which he wishes to exchange, as it were, for something he has made himself.”\n\nTo which Brassier responds,\n\n“The sin of Prometheanism then consists in destroying the equilibrium between the made and the given—between what human beings generate through their own resources, both cognitive and practical, and the way the world is, whether characterized cosmologically, biologically, or historically. The Promethean trespass resides in making the given. By insisting on the possibility of bridging the ontological hiatus separating the given from the made, Prometheanism denies the ontologisation of finitude.” (478)\n\nThere is a clear-cut criterion for when we have disrupted the relation between the given and the made. Dupuy cites Ivan Illich as saying that we will never eliminate pain, cure all disorders, and we will certainly die. Illich thinks that the pursuit of health may itself be a sickening disorder for which there is no technological solution; he says “There is the daily task of accepting the fragility and contingency of the human situation. There are reasonable limits which must be placed on conventional ‘health’ care.”\n\nHence, it is supposed to be “unreasonable” to want to extend life beyond certain limits, and these limits are both empirical and transcendental/existential. The rationality that ignores this limit in order to diminish suffering and death is a “sickening disorder,” hence: “Reason is unreasonable—this is the fundamental objection raised against Promethean rationalism” (479). However, this does not tell us how much suffering we are supposed to accept. We know from history that there is considerable variation in how much suffering and death are considered acceptable.\n\nThere are theological overtones to the critique of Prometheanism. Dupuy cites an argument stating that the Kingdom of God stands above ethical rules and is capable of disrupting everyday life, but this freedom can be volatile. If it is made the subject of a rule, then this limitlessness would threaten human life. Brassier takes this to mean that “the Promethean error is to formulate a rule for what is without rule” (480). What is without rule is the transcendence of the given’s irreducibility to the immanence of making. The problem is trying to conceptualize that which is unconceptualizable—or in other words, that which has been divinely dispensed.\n\nDupuy says that man’s “symbolic health” involves not only an ability to copy with environmental dangers, but also with the threats immanent to life: pain, disease, and death. Traditionally, culture gave us the resources to make sense of mortality.\n\nThe sacred played a role in that. But the modern world is built on the ruins of symbolic systems, in which it could see nothing but arbitrariness. Modernity cannot understand that these systems both fixed limits and conferred meaning. When the sacred was replaced with science, we lost both a sense of limits and the ability to make sense.\n\nThere is something “infinitely precious” about the finitude of humans which obliges us to make sense of suffering, disease, and death. This is a basically religious claim, that suffering is meaningful, that it should be interpreted and rendered significant.\n\nHowever: the fact that we must extract meaning from mortality does not mean that mortality is the prerequisite for a meaningful existence. If finitude is the horizon of our meaning-making, it does not mean that finitude is the condition of all meaning.\n\nDupuy’s critique of Promethean hubris is rooted in Heidegger’s critique of Cartesian mechanistic philosophy, which tries to place mind into mechanistic nature by mechanizing mind. Dupuy thinks the mechanization of mind produces a paradox: the mind that performs the mechanization and the mind that is mechanized are two distinct entities. In order for this mechanization to be carried out, humans must be first treated as objects. The two minds cannot coexist; they are on a seesaw, one going up, and one coming down.\n\nIt is that seesawing between the extreme of subjectivism and the extreme of objectivation that threatens the equilibrium between the given and the made. Basically, the more we understand ourselves as part of nature, the less we can think of ends or purposes for ourselves. The more we understand ourselves as just another organism, the less we can define what we should be\n\nWith the loss of equilibrium, we lose a distinction between what is true for us because we have made it, and what is true because it was created as the unique thing that it is.\n\nDupuy thinks the Judeo-Christian distinction between divine and human creativity is important; the problem with Prometheanism is that it confuses the two. For example, it may be possible in the future to create synthetic life which would be indiscernible from “natural” life. This threatens the apparently essential distinction between the living and the non-living, which is not just a difference in kind, but another kind of difference.\n\nThe important thing is that Dupuy never says why the disruption of equilibrium is a bad thing. It seems that it is objectionable in itself, but that presupposes that there is a natural, transcendentally ordained, equilibrium. Brassier say that it is this assumption of equilibrium that is theological: “[I]t is the claim that there is a ‘way of the world’, a ready-made world whose order is simply to be accepted as an ultimately unintelligible, brute given, that is objectionably theological” (485). The world was made, and we should not ask why it was not made another way. However, the world was not made; it has no reason or purpose. “Prometheanism is the attempt to participate in the creation of the world without having to defer to a divine blueprint. It follows from the realization that the disequilibrium we introduce into the world through our desire to know is no more or less objectionable than the disequilibrium that is already there in the world” (485).\n\nFrom Heidegger’s perspective, Prometheanism is a dangerous metaphysical voluntarism; “But Prometheanism stands to be rehabilitated from the vantage of an understanding of rationality which views it not as a supernatural faculty but simply as rule-governed activity—rationality is simply the faculty of generating and being bound by rules” (485). This is exactly Kant’s account of rationality. This rules are not set in advance, and they are historically mutable, but this does not mean they are contingent in the same way that other historical phenomena are contingent. Rather than trying to preserve an equilibrium between the made and the given, or immanence and transcendence, rationality’s job is to grasp “the stratification of immanence, together with the involution of structures within the natural order through which rules can arise out of physical patterns” (486). Rules coordinate and subsume phenomena, but they are historically made. How we understand the world, and how we change the world based on how we understand it, is always be redetermined.\n\nBrassier says, “What unfolds is a dynamic process which is not about re-establishing equilibrium, but superseding the opposition between order and disorder, and recognizing that the catastrophic overturning of intention, and the often disturbing consequences of our technological ingenuity, constitute no objection to the compulsion to foresee and control” (486).\n\nJG Ballard said all progress is savage, and there is a savagery in rationality. But it is sentimental to claim that all savageries are equivalent; we must be able to discriminate between them and therefore discriminate between modes of instrumentalization. The claim that any attempt to manipulate phenomena simply “perpetuates the most objectionable characteristics of our existence” (487). We could resign ourselves to these characters, or we could reexamine the implicit Promethean project in Marx.\n\nOne of Badiou’s main virtues is to insist on subjectivation. While Brassier disagrees with Badiou’s account of the relation between the event and the subject, he thinks “there is something to be gained by trying to reconnect his account of the necessity of this subjectivation to an analysis of the biological, economic, and historical processes that condition rational subjectivation” (487).\n\nBut this research programme first needs to be defended.\n\nEven if Prometheanism has hints of fantasy about it, these hints can be diagnosed and transformed into the basis of further analysis. One cannot simply reject a programme for its fantasies unless one is dreaming of a rationality devoid of imaginary influences. “Prometheanism promises an overcoming of the opposition between reason and imagination: reason is fuelled by imagination, but it can also remake the limits of the imagination” (487)."
