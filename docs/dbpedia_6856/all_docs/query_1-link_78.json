        "text": "There’s a new trend sweeping the internet: men “raw-dogging” flights.\n\nThese brave (?) men are choosing to forego any form of entertainment from takeoff to touchdown. No music. No in-flight entertainment (beyond the flight status map). No magazines. No nothing.\n\nWhile some guys are simply in it for the social media clout, others see it as a test of will. A chance to prove their stoic fortitude.\n\nIf you’re thinking about raw-dogging your next flight, whether for fun or to cover another square in your Huberman bingo card, I’d challenge you to take things even further.\n\nHow?\n\nBy adding a beauty component.\n\nThink about it. Leveling up your skincare routine won’t keep you from your mission of being bored as hell on a long haul from LAX to JFK, but you will have softer hands by the time you land.\n\nAnd if raw-dogging flights is all about pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, I’d argue that taking your beautifying efforts public is one of the most metal as hell things you can do.\n\nSo, get ready to get comfortable with the discomfort of wearing a face mask while sharing an armrest.\n\nBelow, 4 beauty routines to tackle when you’re raw-dogging a flight:\n\n1. Slap on some eye patches\n\nFeeling a little crinkly in your undereye area? Make like a pirate and throw on an eye patch.\n\nTwo, actually.\n\nTreat yourself to the good stuff, like Hugh Jackman and his 24k gold eye patches above, or hit the drugstore for a more affordable option.\n\nShop eye patches\n\n2. Slip into moisturizing gloves\n\nReady to feel like a greasy magician at 30,000 feet? Lather up in a petroleum-based product like Aquaphor that locks moisture into the skin. Then, pull on a pair of cotton gloves to really soak up the benefits.\n\nFrom there, I don’t know. Wait for enlightenment to strike, I guess!\n\n3. Wear a face mask\n\nThis is, like, level 10 embarrassment for a lot of guys. Even at home! The idea of sitting with a face mask on while catching up on PTI could make even the most stoic man squirm.\n\nSo if you really want a challenge, do it on a plane where everyone can see you.\n\n4. Give yourself a facial massage\n\nLast one. Watch a gua sha tutorial on TikTok (here’s how Kendall Jenner does it!) and get to work on your lymphatic drainage!\n\nMore grooming stories from SG HQ\n\nWhat to put in your dopp kit\n\nThe Guys’ Grooming Guide for your 30s"
