        "text": "Launch your flying career at one of the top 20 universities in the world.* The Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) will prepare you for a successful career as a pilot, industry leader or manager within the aviation sector.\n\nOur Flying program has been recently revamped to meet the rapidly changing needs of the aviation sector. The degree focuses on the skills and knowledge needed to become a professional pilot working either as a single pilot in a general aviation organisation or as a multi-crew team in an airline. Designed in collaboration with key aviation industry partners, the program allows students to gain real-world experience through mentorships and partner programs to accelerate their pathway to becoming a first officer.\n\nWith tourism experiencing a huge upswing, airlines around the world growing their fleets and a brand-new airport opening in Sydney’s west, there’s never been a better time to take to the skies as a pilot. Our graduates are highly respected and in high demand in Australia and internationally, thanks to UNSW Aviation’s reputation in the industry and our global alumni network.\n\n*QS World University Rankings, 2024\n\nJoin the School of Aviation\n\nAs the only Go8 university to offer aviation, UNSW is the go-to place to get your wings. The School of Aviation has been a leading educator in the industry for over 25 years. We’re the highest-ranked global university with a stand-alone aviation school that offers aviation degrees, operates flight training under its own Air Operator’s Certificate and undertakes research. The Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) program is one of three undergraduate programs, sitting alongside the Bachelor of Aviation (Management) and the new Bachelor of Aviation (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems).\n\nLearn from expert educators\n\nOur courses are written and coordinated by experts with substantial industry experience. Our industry facilitators bring a wealth of aviation experience, while our academic staff regularly engage with regulatory authorities, industry bodies and research collaborators. UNSW Aviation educators have come directly from leadership roles within organisations such as Qantas, Airservices Australia, CASA, ATSB and the Federal Airports Corporation.\n\nGain industry connections through mentorships\n\nYou’ll be assigned an airline pilot as your mentor in your final year, courtesy of the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA). This program aims to provide you with career guidance and consultation about specific airline operations.\n\nKickstart your career with the Qantas Aviation Career Enrichment (Q-ACE) Program\n\nOur second-year Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) and Graduate Diploma in Flying students now have the opportunity to participate in Q-ACE – a program delivered by the Qantas Group that helps prepare aspiring airline pilots for direct entry employment opportunities after completing their university study.\n\nFlight training within the Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) requires separate enrolment in the Professional Pilot Program in addition to the academic enrolment. Enrolment in the Professional Pilot Program enables students to undertake flight training for the purpose of obtaining the licences and ratings included in the program. There are no academic units of credit allocated to the Professional Pilot Program. However, the School of Aviation provides successful students with UNSW Wings and a certificate at a Wings and Awards ceremony. The theory lessons undertaken to gain the various ratings and licenses are part of the Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) academic program.\n\nThe Professional Pilot Program covers flight training and flight tests to a minimum of Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), together with Instrument Rating - Multi Engine Aeroplane and Air Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) theory.\n\nThe Professional Pilot Program is conducted in block periods throughout the degree program. It includes up to 200 hours of flight training and approximately 30 hours of simulator training to CPL and Instrument Rating - Multi Engine Aeroplane status. The flight training and associated theory are taught in an integrated format and delivered over two years, in addition to the demanding main campus academic commitment. Students may elect to complete further academic work in lieu of flight training for the elective in the final phase of third year.\n\nStudents undertaking the Professional Pilot Program begin the academic year in mid-February of first year, and complete the first two terms of the academic core before commencing Basic Aeronautical Knowledge (BAK) in September of first year. Flight training is scheduled continuously from November in first year to mid-December in second year; completing training for the Recreational and Commercial Pilot Licences, and Instrument Rating - Multi Engine Aeroplane. Students complete the academic core in term one of third year and then return to Bankstown Flying Operations Unit for the final stage of flight training, which covers Air Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) theory, examinations and their elective.\n\nStudents are expected to make themselves available on a full-time basis during training. At times, students may be expected to fly earlier or later or occasionally on weekends if necessary due to scheduling pressures or delays due to maintenance or weather.\n\nAustralia has one of the most highly developed aviation industries in the world. It is home to some of the best global airlines and has significant hubs for airlines based in Asia, the Americas and Europe.\n\nBecoming a pilot with an airline usually requires working within the general aviation sector to gain additional flying experience. For this reason, most flying graduates will spend some time working as a flying instructor, charter pilot or in some other general aviation flying activity.\n\nFor qualified pilots, there is a wide variety of work in aviation which includes being an airline pilot (international and regional), a flight instructor, charter or corporate pilot, corporate jet flying, helicopter flying and aerial survey work. There is also the potential to transition into an aviation management role, working as part of a leadership team for an airline, airport or aviation business."
