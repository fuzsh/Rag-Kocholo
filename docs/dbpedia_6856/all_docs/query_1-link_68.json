        "text": "Peter Lynn Kiteboarding became in 2021 officially PLKB. With over 50 years of experience in making power and depower kites, it is time for the new chapter. From the legend Peter Lynn from whom we gathered all our education, our dreams about the future of kites and the drive to innovate, we arrived at a new phase, PLKB.\n\nIf you say Peter Lynn, people respond with an euphoric set of memories about how they have learned kiting with the Peter Lynn power kites. We are the only brand that continues to develop the power kite range to become better for learning, ease of use, power and to have fun with. We want to offer a broad range of kite products to give the best experience and most fun for all ages. Our cradle is to Never Stop Playing, because that’s what it’s all about.\n\nFrom 1987 Peter and his team committed 100% of their time and energy to the development of traction kiting, with early efforts being towards kite sailing.\n\nOne of the first wings that carried the Peter Lynn name was the Peel. With a simple design this two line wing offered very good performance as well as stability and great handling. The Peel was launched in 1991 and is now referred to as the grandfather of power foils. Although handicapped by the kites of the time (the best performance back then was obtained with delta style sports kites), within a few months Peter and his team were successfully sailing all courses under kitepower; in winds from 10km/h to – on a celebrated occasion – over 100km/h. By 1988, they were successfully water skiing using kite power, had mastered kite ice skating and had even made various wobbling attempts at kiteboarding.\n\nIn 1990, the invention of the kite buggy showed for the first time that a kite could be a viable means to convert wind energy into motive power. The invention of the modern kitebuggy in 1990 was a spin-off from these other kite traction developments: in order to let kitesailing development continue through the winter, while their favourite lake was frozen over, the wheels were fitted to a 3-hulls kite boat. The result was recognised immediately as a practical buggy – and went into production within months, spawning what is now a worldwide sport with perhaps some tens of thousands enthusiastic practitioners today. Between 1990 and 1997, a series of kite buggies were developed, which got better and better over the years in terms of performance, user comfort and durability. From the Peter Lynn classic buggy, development went on to create the Peter Lynn Competition buggy; much more refined and still on offer today. At the same time Peter developed a wide range of extensions, upgrades and accessories for all buggies. The last addition to the range was the Folding buggy, which can be disassembled and folded without the use of any tools; ideal for storage and transport.\n\nFrom the early 1990’s, the team at Peter Lynn had recognized that kiteboarding, if it could be made practical, would be the big prize.\n\nAlthough handicapped by the kites of the time (the best performance back then was obtained with delta style sports kites), within a few months Peter and his team were successfully sailing all courses under kitepower; in winds from 10km/h to – on a celebrated occasion – over 100km/h. By 1988, they were successfully water skiing using kite power, had mastered kite ice skating and had even made various wobbling attempts at kiteboarding.\n\nAs they worked away at the problems year after year the big worry was not whether it was going to be possible or not – that had been settled early on – but whether it could ever be made easy enough for more than just a tiny handful of elite athletes in perfect conditions. As they swayed from hope to despair and back many times, it gradually became clear that the solution lay with better kites; not in board development, which had been the main focus in the early years.\n\nIn 1997 the first hybrid kite was born; the C-Quad. The speed and performance of this kite surprised kite flyers worldwide and it quickly became widely used in many kiting disciplines and showed to be perfectly suitable for kite buggying but also for kite sailing and even kiteboarding. The secret of the C-Quad is its excellent blend between two types of kite, combining the single skin of delta type kites with the bridling of a foilkite. With the complete wing being supported by bridles there was no need for the large, heavy rods seen in large delta type kites. The unique C-Quad is still seen today…\n\nFor kiteboarding better kites were needed. At Peter Lynn, the search had been on for a decade but rapid improvements in LEI kites from 1998 on provided a real spur. Even though, designing and Arc was very difficult in 1998, the first Arc that could actually fly was built and successfully tested.\n\nNot just successfully, early indications were that Arc style kites could eventually become THE best performing kites for kiteboarding. However flashes of amazing performance are not the same as a fully rounded developed design that can be manufactured consistently and perform for all users in all conditions.\n\nRight from the start it was obvious that this Arc design, renamed to Twinskin design in 2003, had created a new field of its own, with its stability and auto zenith (there is nothing like it on the market), no bridles to tangle and of course no bladders to puncture. Combined with its great performance and user friendliness this makes the Twinskin design ideal for all levels of riders looking to progress every time they’re out riding.\n\nIn 1999 the first Peter Lynn Arc came on the market. The standard Arc was a great success, many people had noticed that there was a different kite that was a lot more stable and user friendly than the tube kites. The F-Arc, a high performance version of the earlier arc was introduced, followed the first Peter Lynn Guerilla in 2003. The Guerilla was another kiteboarding kite that was a great rival to the tube design.\n\nThe Peter Lynn Guerilla had a lot of depower, quick and easy handling and good lift. Many people started to realize that the Twinskin design was a very good alternative for the tube kite design, and slowly more people started to gain interest in the design. The design developed further when in 2004 the Peter Lynn Bomba and Guerilla II were introduced, a great fun kite, good for wakestyle and waveriding.\n\nWhere the tube kite development had been running for many more years, by all the various kiteboarding brands out there today, the Twinskin design had gotten so close in only a few years’ time, despite Peter Lynn being the only company with this type of kite.\n\nThe Hype started in 2006 as the Peter Lynn Vibe. A power kite that can be flown by everyone, no matter what age or skill, with confidence. With easy relaunch and constant power, the Vibe grew fast. After several years on the market, the name Vibe had to be changed and became the Peter Lynn Hype. Now a decade later, it’s the best sold kite on the market.\n\nThe Peter Lynn Hype as 2-line entry power kite with straps. It’s the perfect kite for a day out with the whole family. It is incredibly easy to set-up and suitable for all ages and skill levels. Flying the Hype does not require any prior kiting experience, as it's docile flying behaviour ensures that there are no sudden power surges when flying the kite through the wind-window.\n\nIn 2009 the Pro range was first extended with the Peter Lynn Core, a highly versatile kite which was the result of the very best technological developments by the Dutch designers. The Core offered performance unseen in foil kite design. Designed as an all rounder it was so efficient that it could easily be flown one size smaller and still offer the same power as its competition. 2009 proved to be a milestone year in the Peter Lynn history, with the introduction of the Vapor at the European kitebuggy Championships leaving nothing to the imagination. With the top 5 being Vapor pilots and a total of 7 Vapors in the top 10 Peter Lynn firmly cemented itself as the leading brand in high performance foilkite design. In the following years the Vapor continued to dominate the international buggy racing scene with numerous National titles, several European and World championship titles and setting the current worldwide kite buggy speed record of 134Km/h.\n\nOver the years, many Peter Lynn kites were introduced under the flag pro series, and developed for kite buggying as well as for jumping.\n\nPro Series\n\nBuggy kites\n\nPeter Lynn Vapor\n\nPeter Lynn Reactor\n\nPeter Lynn Viper\n\nPeter Lynn Core\n\nJump kites\n\nPeter Lynn Voltage\n\nPeter Lynn Twister\n\n2011 marked a special year for Peter Lynn. With the release of two dedicated kiteboarding kites at the end of 2011, Peter Lynn entered the LEI/tube market. The Escape and Fury were the result of several years of development and showed the kiting industry that 40 years of experience really means something. Both the Escape and Fury were quickly recognized by kiteboarders worldwide as serious competitors in terms of build quality and flying characteristics.\n\nBy the end of 2012 the second generation of Peter Lynn Escape and Fury was introduced, with both kites being further refined and tuned to suit the respective target riders even better; and they received a graphic overhaul as well. Furthermore, the LEI range was extended with the Fury Lite, dedicated to light wind and course racing.\n\n\"Peter Lynn brings you new kites, revolutionary to the brand; a valuable addition to the line-up and the next step in the Peter Lynn strategy to bring the best kites for each discipline of kite sports.\n\nPeter Lynn stands for refined products, best-in-class materials and progressive designs and this vision can be recognised in the new LEI kites too. Designer excellence materialised into two brand new kites. The optimised profiles bring unprecedented handling and feedback to the rider, enabling them to progress faster in whatever direction he or she chooses. This is also in line with the Peter Lynn strategy to offer personal progression, adventure and excitement to the end user.\n\nThe two new LEI kites, the 'all area performance’ freeride Fury and the ‘all-round comfort’ intermedia te Escape are both designed with optimised profiles and fine-tuned bridles, as you might expect from Peter Lynn’s expertise and pedigree in kite design. To be able to be allround successful, Peter Lynn invested all its resources and knowledge in kite development resulting in exceptional rider feedback and a great wind range. Those are elements that are essential for any kiter to enjoy a kite in all disciplines and over a wide range of conditions.\""
