        "text": "Simone Biles has always had a loyal supporter in her younger sister, Adria Biles.\n\nAdria Biles' sweet throwback tribute\n\nOn Wednesday, August 7, Adria, 25, took to Instagram to honor her sister's remarkable achievements at the 2024 Paris Olympics, posting a heartfelt tribute that reflected the deep bond the siblings share.\n\nIn her post, Adria shared a sweet throwback photo, accompanied by a moving caption that read, \"The little girl in me would look for you in every single room she walks into. You have made me into the person I am today and I will forever look up to you. I love you sister .\"\n\nSimone, 27, who wrapped up her Olympic journey with a silver medal in the individual floor exercise on August 5, responded with a series of heart emojis and later shared the post on her Instagram Stories.\n\nThe Olympic champion also included a video of the sisters celebrating with a champagne toast.\n\nSimon Biles makes history in Paris\n\nThis year's Olympics marked another milestone in Simone Biles' illustrious career.\n\nThe gymnast, who now holds the title of the most decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympic history, earned a total of four medals in Paris: Two golds, a silver and a bronze.\n\nReflecting on her accomplishments, Simone told reporters, \"I've accomplished way more than my wildest dreams, not just at this Olympics, but in this sport. A couple of years ago, I didn't think I'd be back here at an Olympic game.\"\n\nTheir mother, Nellie Biles, also expressed her pride in Simone's achievements, emphasizing the family's joy after a challenging yet rewarding Olympic week.\n\nThe Biles sisters have shared a close relationship since childhood, with Simone often taking on a protective role over Adria.\n\nRaised together after being adopted by their grandparents, the pair navigated the world of gymnastics side by side, with Adria following in Simone's footsteps for several years before stepping away from the sport."
