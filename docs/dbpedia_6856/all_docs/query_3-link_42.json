        "text": "SLOANE, Alexander and SLOANE, Ann\n\nYarrawonga, Australia: A & A Sloane, 1996. Quarto, illustrated printed wrappers, viii, 124 pp., illustrated throughout with black-and-white photographs, some maps included, three appendices included. Corners a little bumped, spine a little faded, very light foxing on cover; otherwise a near-fine copy. First edition. An account of the short life of Douglas Sloane, aviation enthusiast and member of the Australian Flying Corps' No. 69 Squadron during World War One. As a young man, Sloane designed and built his own bi-plane, inspired by the wings of eagles. However, he had to leave his invention behind when war broke out. Sloane never saw Australia again; he was killed in an air accident in 1917, as he was heading to the Western Front. His diaries and letters remained and were preserved by his cousin Ian, then passed on to Ian's son Alex. Together with his wife Ann, Alex has compiled these telling documents to produce a portrait of Sloane's life as an airman during wartime. Item #4633"
