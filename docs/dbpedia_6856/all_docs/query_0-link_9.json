        "text": "1/2/2023\n\nSubject: Kiss and Break Up\n\nDear Peter,\n\nJust so you know how long we've walked side by side the very first album I bought was when I was ten years old and I spent my whole allowance on 'Destroyer' when I was 10 years old in 1977. Every other Kiss album I had to shovel driveways and mow lawns to buy because my parents refused to contribute to my degeneration by letting any of their money go to my devotion to your band. Even back then I got a sense of you being a person who'd never lost touch with just plain folks like me. And my parents, God bless them both, forced me to struggle and sweat to earn money and every cent that didn't go to candy or baseball cards went to buying anything by Kiss - MY band. Me and you four were in a - 'conspiracy' is too sleazy a word - but an agreement between brothers. You kept making music and I would break my back to get it. My connection to you and Kiss is deeper than any other band by many miles. And I almost instantly felt like you were the one regular guy who I'd genuinely be able to relate to. Which leads to why I'm writing.\n\n'Kiss From Makeup To Breakup' is so far and away the best of all the band memoirs. And when I read it, it was just like hearing you talking in my mind. And Kiss was so meaningful to me that I was laughing and crying and gasping and cheering all the way through it. Your book hit me like a cannonball. Honesty and integrity and an incredible sense of humor burn from every page. So how is it the other 3 have an audiobook and you don't? It was like it was written to be heard. No surprise your writing is just a step away from music. And it would sound ridiculous read by anyone else. Of course, I'd never want to ask you to pour all that effort into anything which wouldn't be of any benefit to you. Nobody works for free and I both get and respect that. But the joy me and other fans would get from hearing it through your voice is huge. Even Paul's maybe not entirely candid book was a thrill to hear read with his voice. Yours would be that much better. Actually, a dream come true would be to go through his book with you, comment by comment, because I swear there is an ABYSS between the two viewpoints. My natural inclination is to believe the guy who sounds least like a politician. So, there we go :-).\n\nAnyway, it's nice to at least talk at you from across decades of love, loyalty and real kinship. I hope God continues to bless you like He has and your remaining four lives pass very slowly. You've always given us your heart and soul as well as set an example as a mature adult. I'm sorry my parents are no longer around to see you didn't corrupt me after all. Happy New Year, stay well and God bless you.\n\nLove,\n\nTeddy - Kiss Army Veteran, Class of 77\n\n12/20/2022\n\nSubject: Birthday wishes\n\nHi my name is Enzo I am a 8year old fan of yours. I wanted to wish you a happy birthday and a Merry Christmas and a happy new year.\n\nEnzo\n\n12/20/2022\n\nSubject: Happy Birthday\n\nHi Cat,\n\nHappy Birthday to you! I love you and hope you are well. You are the greatest Italian rock drummer ever!!!\n\nRob\n\n3 forever\n\n12/20/2022\n\nSubject: Happy birthday Peter!\n\nJust wanted to take a moment to wish you all the best on your special day. You've meant so much, and done so much, for so many of us out there - \"The Faces In The Crowd\".\n\nAll the best to you, Peter!\n\nRich Toland (fellow NJ Shore resident and fan of yours for too many decades to count)\n\nPS - Happy Holidays to you and Gigi!\n\n11/1/2022\n\nSubject: I'm a songwriter because of you\n\nHi Peter,\n\nI don't expect you to respond, so please don't worry about that. I know you're busy.\n\nMy name is Rob Harris and I'm a singer-songwriter in Nashville Tennessee. I am 58 years old and I've been a kiss fan since I was 13. You were always my favorite member of the band.\n\nI've been working as a songwriter in Nashville for over 20 years. I'm also a worship leader at my local church.\n\nYou are a huge part of why I have the career I have these days, and I just wanted to say thank you. I haven't had any big cuts as a songwriter, but I have worked steadily for the last 20 years. And I'm deeply grateful.\n\nYou had a huge impact on me as a young musician. And I will always be grateful for that. I've seen you several times in concert.\n\nI hope you and your family are doing well. It would be a dream to meet you someday. But just in case I don't get that honor, I wanted to write this email like a kid writing to Santa Claus, hoping it finds its way to you and that it might encourage you. You have inspired several generations of musicians, and I am grateful to be among them.\n\nTake care, I pray the upcoming holidays are a joy to you and your family. Thank you so much for inspiring this kid from Southern West Virginia to make music such a huge part of their life.\n\nBlessings,\n\nRob Harris\n\nNashville, Tennessee\n\nrobharrisonline.com\n\n10/4/2022\n\nSubject: Thank you for being you.\n\nHey Peter,\n\nI'm writing to say that I've been a life long fan. I've been watching a lot of the documentaries on KISS, its reunion tour, and personal interviews everyone gave. I know you already know this and KISS is over now but you and Ace make up what is the essential characters of Kiss. I never could understood how Gene and Paul could treat you the way they did especially knowing the reason you sold out Tiger Stadium in 40 minutes was because of you and Ace coming back. Not because the make up and stage theatricals. It was you and Ace.\n\nIt's like going to a Broadway play to see a star perform a part. Would you want to go see the star or it's understudy? Guess they never saw it that way. Guess they can simply fool everyone. Oh, well. What's done is done. It's sad but it's all done. I'm a big fan and I wish you all the best in life. Congratulations on beating cancer.\n\nLove you!\n\nAndrew\n\nP.S. I saw on your website that you won't or can't sign copies of Nothin' To Lose, Sealed With A KISS, or Behind the Mask.\n\nJust out of curiosity, why won't you sign these particular items?\n\n9/29/2022\n\nSubject: Greetings from Germany,\n\nHi Peter,\n\n40 years ago I first came in contact with Kiss Music. I was 11 years old and just received my first two records. No Kiss Albums, it was The Police \"Ghost in the machine\" and Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\". Not too bad for a start, thanks to my neighbor friend who gave them as a birthday present (a very valuable present in these times).\n\nSteward Copland and Nick Mason are till now two of my favorite drummers, needless to say that I instantly set up some garbage bins and started drumming. So first it was the dynamic (Copeland) and the feeling (Mason) of drumming. When Kiss came along I felt the power and the fun of Rock Music. But I was (and be until today) an unusual Kiss Fan. I first came in contact with the Solo Albums. And what I thought was: oh there are four guys, who do very different music. I liked Ace's and your Album best. The others didn't have a unique style. And with your Album there comes the shuffle, the Rhythm & Blues and of course your unique voice. Later on I collected all Albums of the first Kiss era, which are still down in the basement and soon will be my wall decoration in my new Drumming Room.\n\nAlthough I usually change my music preferences very often, that musical triumphrat accompanied my last 40 years.\n\nI never saw Kiss live, because in the 80s, I was too young and later on the music changed not for the better. The series of Farewell/End of the Road/Goodbye Tours didn't set my heart on fire. \"The Elder\" was my last Kiss Record. And I liked it, because it was different, it was a risk but I was one of the fans who is open for changes or would be bored by repetitions. After \"The Elder\" there were a lot of repetitions :-)\n\nFor the last 30 years I play the drums as my hobby in several bands. With my 25 year old son I started playing Handpan. Handpan? Whats that? Listen here, if you like We released an Album and play live as often as we find the time. That's really amazing, because with the handpan, I can combine rhythm work with musical creativity.\n\nAnd by all the discussions who is the best drummer all around: That is not important. You are the Kiss drummer, who defined the sound like no other, just because you did not just adopt \"Rock Drumming\", but kept your style. All the others are replaceable, your style is unique, like Copeland's and Mason's.\n\nSo I hope you are alright, healthy and happy!\n\nThanks for the inspiration and the music.\n\nBest Regards from Munich, Germany\n\nAndy\n\n11/20/2021\n\nSubject: Just Say Thanks\n\nHello Mr Peter,\n\nI’m a kiss fan, i am bigger fan of you. My favorite song is Beth and all want to sayto you is:\n\nThanks!!!\n\nI live in Chile\n\nSo, thanks again for that beautiful song\n\nI wish you my best.\n\nAlejandro\n\n10/26/2021\n\nSubject: Integrity\n\nPeter you stood for what you believed in and didn’t take the BS of the other two guys…. Good for you… people, and drummers are supposed to just roll over to this kind of BS. Listening to the original music of KISS, its obvious that you and Ace were the talent of the band. The band would have never have happened without you two bringing the legitimacy of real musicianship to the band.\n\nAmazing drummer and man!\n\nGod Bless you Peter!\n\nAlan\n\n9/28/2021\n\nSubject: Major Fan\n\nHello Mr. Peter Criss!\n\nMy name is Brandon.\n\nWow. I am such a Major Super Fan.\n\nNo idea where to begin so I do not sound stupid.\n\nJust Love early KISS to the core with you and Ace!\n\nJust saw Ace at the Hard Rock in Orlando in February 2020 in Orlando.\n\nLast time was at the Lost Horizon Bar in Syracuse in 1987.\n\nMy entire school years prior to college was dominated by KISS music.\n\nI stopped listening to KISS in 1980. Must admit that I started again in 92' with the Revenge album.\n\nI was just devastated when you and Ace left the band but I totally understand (at last all of everyone's statements as to why).\n\nIn 1979 KISS played the Lakeland Civic Center in Florida on June 14 and 15, 1979.\n\nI lived in Upstate New York. My best neighborhood friend, his Grandfather, owned the Lakeland Civic Center. He obtained one of your gloves and the guitar Paul smashed on stage. The Grandfather gave it to my best friend. I was so shocked to see the guitar neck was sawed almost all the way through and that is how Paul broke the guitars at the end of the show. (Now when I watch video, he hits the guitar on the side edge several times and the turns it flat to smash along with the sawing break).\n\nAnyway, Your Glove.\n\nI spent all the money I had to buy the glove from my friend.\n\nThat was in 1979. I still have your glove to this day. My father was so mad at me but I did not care one bit. I had a TREASURE!\n\nI Cherished it. I have it sealed in plastic.\n\nI became a Drummer because of you and played in Junior High and High School Bands.\n\nBrandon\n\n8/27/2021\n\nSubject: Your #1 (14yo) FAN\n\nHi Peter “Catman”,\n\nMy 14 year old son Jordan (who happens to have Down syndrome) was an instant fan after watching a few videos of you on youtube. He begged to start drums so he could be like the “Catman”. Needless to say that was a few years ago and his love for you is still going strong and he is rocking out at weekly drum lessons. A bonus is our whole family can sing the words to Beth because he plays it nonstop, among many other songs.\n\nThank you for inspiring my son and giving him something that brings him so much joy and happiness. I love his passion for rock music and drums, YOU played a huge part in him finding that passion. You are a legend, thank you for sharing your light with the world. Much love.\n\nxoxo,\n\nJordan’s mom\n\n7/27/2021\n\nSubject: Kiss\n\nYou are the best drummer in the world to me. Also the best vocals in kiss the group. Hopefully you are healthy and happy in a good place.\n\nlove you,\n\njanel\n\n7/13/2021\n\nSubject: Knoxville\n\nI'm really really hoping that I get to meet you when you come to Knoxville, I wish that Ace was going to be with you, Gene and Paul not so much. I've watched alot of your videos and things on YouTube with other fans and I'm just hoping that I get that experience for myself.\n\nJason G.\n\n6/23/2021\n\nSubject: Good for you!\n\nGood for you not to allow Gene and Paul the rights to Beth for the Kisstory special. You and Ace both deserve to be paid for this documentary. It's still about the mighty dollar with them. Peter Criss and Ace Frehley made Kiss what Gene and Paul could never have done. A raw, great rock n roll band, stage show nobody could beat, larger than life over the top entertainment, that made millions of fans pick up a guitar or play drums because Kiss kicked ass. As a fan for 45 years plus, you and Ace cannot and will not ever be replaced in my book.\n\nBill H.\n\n5/17/2021\n\nSubject: A Sincere Thank You...\n\nGreetings Peter...\n\nI don't really believe that you personally will read this or respond for that matter, but since I've never had the honor to meet you, I wanted to reach out.\n\nI'm Jay J., 50 years old and a life long fan (well since I was 6). Your style and technique have always fascinate and inspired me from day one and I can honestly say that you are the reason I became a drummer/musician. I am also a guitar player and singer as well.\n\nYour talent and career have given me a lifelong joy and passion that has gotten me through the best and worst times in my life. Either by listening/watching you play or by inspiring me to play. Between those 2, you have been there for me my entire life.\n\nSo, I just wanted to send you a sincere thank you and let you know that not a day goes by that you haven't influnced me in one way or another.\n\nThank you so much and God bless...\n\nJay J.\n\n4/13/2021\n\nSubject: Brazilian Fan.\n\nHello Peter,\n\nMy name is Guilherme, and i am from Brazil. I am a great Kiss fan, since i am 6. Now I am 41, still loving to listen thw fisrt kiss lps. I am a surgeon, and a medicine teacher in my city, so , its very rare to have vacations.

But still missing one. The heart of kiss. The original drummer. First and only Peter.\n\nGuilherme L.\n\n4/9/2021\n\nSubject: Hi!\n\nJust wanted to say hi .You've been a inspiration for me to play drums at an early age. I don't play as much anymore. I saw you in the Springfield Civic Center back in 77 on the Destroyer tour. Judas Priest opened.\n\nTim G.\n\n3/23/2021\n\nSubject: Thank you so much\n\nPeter,\n\nI just want to thank you so much, for not only all the music,but I met you, in Ohio, I believe it was 1994 before the reunion tour, and you took the time to sit there and just chat with me, I think it was your manager told said you had to go,and you said no this is the reason why you have a job I will stay here all night and talk to every fan if I need to. I appreciate it so much, it just shows that you're just human like the rest of us and I deeply appreciate it.\n\nThank you,\n\nBryan\n\n3/18/2012\n\nSubject: Thank you\n\nPeter\n\nJust a note to say thank you. I have enjoyed your drumming style from the time I started playing drums. I did get to see you at the LA Forum, Anaheim Stadium and the last reunion tour in Anaheim, CA. I appreciate your Faith as well and it’s always been important to me as well.\n\nGod Bless and hope you stay well!\n\nAlan A.\n\n3/15/2021\n\nSubject: Thank you\n\nPeter,\n\nI am 47 years old and am honored to say I have been a fan since I was about 2 or 3 years old.I am particularly honored to say that I also was born the same year that KISS was and am also from NY(central/upstate- about 45 mins. east of Syracuse).I can distinctly remember hearing Rock And Roll All Nite around 1975/76 when I was just 2-3 years old.The original band and band with Eric Carr will always hold a special place in my heart.As far as I am concerned,that is the only true KISS that I know and love.I never had the pleasure/privilage of seeing you live,but have many fond memories of all the great music that you made and thanks to the internet,can now see many of your concerts.I even have some dvds of past shows that I still watch from time to time.I just wanted to take the time to write you to say congratulations on now being a member of The Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame-you deserve it very much and thank you very much for all of the great music and memories that you have given me.Take care.God bless.You are the one and only Catman.\n\n/27/2021\n\nSubject: Hope you and Gigi are well.\n\nGood morning Peter!\n\nI had the real pleasure of meeting you and Gigi a few years ago and just wanted to\n\nsay hello and wish you well.\n\nYour posting of the video of you singing “Don’t you let me down” was one of the real treats in the last year. It was so wonderful to hear your fantastic voice again.\n\nThank you for all the great music you’ve shared with us.\n\nStay safe and God bless.\n\nPeter W.\n\nManchester, NH\n\n2/26/2021\n\nSubject: Dear Peter\n\nHello Peter,\n\nI hope you´re having an amazing day. I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for your music. You have no idea how much your music has meant for me growing up. I still remember hearing you sing Beth at 4 years old and i was blown away. Today I´m 22 years old and I´m still blown away by your talent and kindness. Thank you for being you and for being such an amazing source of inspiration for me growing up.\n\nKeep on rockin!\n\nLove,\n\nMaren\n\n2/2/2021\n\nSubject: Tom Snider\n\nPeter,\n\nWas watching The Tom Snider interview yesterday and also another interview done when you were out of KISS without makeup. I liked the way you speak from the heart and keep it real. You and Ace both the same. Honestly, I was always drawn to Gene Simmons when I was a kid in the early 70's. Now, I think I grew up finally and realize that you and Ace were always true to fans. You never tried to B.S. your way through life. Your a legend in rock history forever buddy!\n\n1/31/2021\n\nSubject: I am a big fan\n\nDear Peter\n\nJust wanted to write and say I am a big fan one of millions you have. Since the kiss days growing up with kiss at 12. I am now 58 and still a big fan always will be .I got my first drum kit after seeing you.\n\nAnd I am still playing. Thank you so much for all the great memories I have seeing you play. Take care and God bless.\n\nDaryl S.\n\n1/26/2021\n\nSubject: Thank You\n\nMany years ago when I was a small girl- I got a chance to meet you.\n\nMy dad owned a towing business and helped you one night with your limo when it got stuck in Armonk, NY.\n\nHe mentioned that I was a huge KISS fan- with you as my favorite band member (I even dressed up as you for Halloween in those plastic costumes)! As a thank you for my dad helping you out and towing your limo- he brought me over to the place you were staying at to meet you- you even let me sit at your drums. You gave me one of your drum sticks and an autographed copy of the “Dynasty “album.\n\nI will always remember this- and how wonderful you were to me. You were patient and took the time to talk to me. This experience was one that will always stay with me (even though I am much older now).\n\nThank you! You made a huge impact on a little girl’s life- one who stills love music, your songs and you! Please realize that you made a positive impact on my life!\n\nI am sure you don’t remember this- but I will always cherish this experience!\n\nThank you! Stay safe!\n\nMargaret C.\n\n1/22/2021\n\nSubject: \"Thank You\" From a Four Decades Fan\n\nDear Peter,\n\nMy name is Kevin Hall and I have been a fan of yours for over 40 years. I wanted to say, “Thank You” for your inspiration in playing drums. Because of you I have always had a love for music. Since retiring from the Military 7 1/2 years ago, I continue to play drums and have recently taken up guitar, your never to old to learn, and I’m currently learning some of your songs from the Peter Criss single album. Again from a long time fan, “Thank You,” for all that you do.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nKevin H.\n\nSSG US ARMY (Retired)\n\n12/01/2020\n\nSubject: Hooligans\n\nPeter I took my daughter(14) record shopping today and I told her to pick out a record for herself. She comes back down the isle with a copy of Love Gun. I said no Bella get what YOU want. She flips it around and points to Hooligans and says ”Daddy I love this song”! Had to tell you! You and Ace were the heart n souls of KISS. You by far have the best voice in KISS.\n\n11/28/2020\n\nSubject: Letter to Peter\n\nHi Peter!\n\nMy name is Ryan, I'm a 20 year old musician from Northern Michigan. I just wanted to write and thank you for all the years of inspiration. I grew up beating out Love Gun on my pots and pans, and it's still one of my favorite songs to play! I also took a lot of inspiration from your singing on songs like I Can't Stop the Rain and Don't You Let Me Down. You are such a role model to me, and I am so glad I had you to look up to as I was growing up. I hope you're well in this crazy time! Be well and take care,\n\nRyan C.\n\n11/05/2020\n\nSubject: Peter Criss fan since 75\n\nAt age 7 in 75 I snagged Kiss Alive on 8-track from my big sister and that was it!!\n\nYou were my hero and I started playing drums! I saw y’all live in Atlanta 77 and remember it like it was yesterday.\n\nBottom line is when you left the band, I was devastated and Dynasty was the last album I purchased. My days of being a drummer ended also and I switched to guitar as I couldn’t play drums without fighting back tears knowing you had left the band.\n\nThen for the reunion in 1996, of course I was right there (Atlanta) with seats just to the side where I could keep all eyes on the drums. I might add that Ace was TOTALLY ripping it to shreds the whole time and it was phenomenal!!\n\nOver the years I basically didn’t know the story as I never kept up with celebrity news and for the most part, I still do not\n\nI had seen Gene and Paul on different video clips through the years and was NOT impressed.\n\nThen out of the blue this year during quarantine with my 7 and 9 year old boys, I pulled out KISS Alive and my kids went crazy for it and now they are hooked!!\n\nThey love the stories of me getting in trouble at school while drawing KISS instead of doing my assignments!!\n\nAnyways so I’m back on the massive KISS faze again and starting looking up different interviews til I found the Eddie Trunk interview. Seconds into it, here come the massive tears again and hearing your voice/story put me right back to being a kid driving my family crazy pounding on the drums in the basement!!\n\nThe interview made me go from sad to angry real fast and that is why I had to write to you!! Mr Catman you are a legend and an inspiration to so many and you keep getting new generations of fans. You are the bigger and greater man!! My best to you and family and I hope one day I’m fortunate enough to cross paths.\n\nJimmy B.\n\n10/26/2020\n\nSubject: Just a Huge Catman Fan!\n\nHello to the one and only Cat Man! So I am not sure if you will actually read this however, I really hope you get to. I am no one really important to the world but I was looking around on your website and it said contact Peter Criss and being one of your biggest fans I had to a least try to reach out. Like most of your fans who play drums you are the single reason I started playing drums nearly 25 years ago. I was 15 and never listened to any music other than country. My older brother was a huge KISS fan since the late 70s and I remember seeing the posters and albums at home as a kid and of course I had heard Rock 'n Roll all Nite but I didnt know the first thing about you nor the band. So of course my brother played guitar and over a few weeks of me and him hanging out as i got older (around 13-14) he started playing some KISS and Ozzy and such. At this point I just had to hear more of this KISS band and something about the cat makeup caught my interest. As I listened to and learned more about the band I ended up buying every single album on cassette and that was all I listened to for about a year. I was amazed By your playing and voice brother and visually you just seemed like a superhero. So at this point I had to do what you do and play the drums so for a year I asked for a set and would play in my head constantly until finally getting my first kit for Christmas when I was 15. I spent so much time trying to mimic your playing style and you could say I learned from you. Here I am now nearly 40 years old and I consider myself your biggest fan and I hope one day I get to meet you. You are definitely one of my childhood heroes and even today. I did get to see yall in 1996 and 2001 (I think 2001 or 2003) at the reunion tour and farewell tour in New Orleans and it was like a dream come true! Glad to see you're doing well and take care brother. Thank you for being a huge inspiration in my life. God bless you \"Cat Man\"!\n\nJust a fan,\n\nDarryl V.\n\n10/17/2020\n\nSubject: 8 Years Ago\n\nHey Peter and GiGi,\n\nThis memory just popped up on my Facebook and id love to re share it with you guys! This was from 2012 chiller expo in NJ and my 2 friends and i were waiting on your long line and we couldn’t wait to meet you, our time came and we were just all in shock and we took our picture and moved on to the door, right before i walked out i turned to Peter and asked him how he was feeling. Peter stopped the entire line and spoke to us for 15 mins explaining to us how to treat your loved ones and what they mean to you. It was a very valuable lesson and how we should always take care of ourselves and go to the doctors and we went on to tell him how we were in a band and he had told us never stop playing and if we ever made it to the garden one day “the church” he would be there to see us. And then he hugged us tight as if we were all a family. Its a day we would all never forget and GiGi thankyou so much for the sticks you gave us because you saw how happy we made peter at that moment. All 3 of us are still best friends and we still play and we ALWAYS get to brag about this amazing moment we had with Peter! Thankyou for making that a memory we will cherish forever!\n\nMichael D.\n\n10/6/2020\n\nSubject: The Carman\n\nHey Peter,\n\nYou are one of the reasons I am a musician today and you are nothing short of a living legend. Thank you for all of the amazing, timeless music. You are the real catman!\n\nBrock K.\n\n9/15/2020\n\nSubject: Rock n Roll\n\nHello Peter!\n\nI hope all is well with you. I know you and I enjoy different types of music but rock and roll is my favorite because it was a huge influence on my childhood. I always love drums even as a child but never played. You have always amazed me how talented you’re not only a drummer but a on vocals as well. I love music so much .\n\nLove you catman.\n\nAnita M.\n\n8/25/2020\n\nSubject: Amazing\n\nHi Peter,\n\nJust wanted to say hello and thank you for the amazing music you filled my life with. You inspired me to play drums at a young age. I had your album on the wall of my bedroom and dressed up like you on several occasions. I hope you are well. I appreciate you. Thank you.\n\nTom S.\n\n8/23/2020\n\nSubject: Winterland\n\nHello Peter:\n\nYou are still an influence on my heart. Black Diamond...what can I say other than you rocked hard and were the most sexiest man in Kiss.\n\nAlthough I was only 8 in '75, I grew up on Kiss and the Kiss Army. By far, you had the best vocal ability than anyone in the band. Your raspy voice, so powerful, yet never out of breath while hitting the drums. Truly an inspiration!\n\nI hope you and your family are doing well in these crazy times we live in.\n\nJersey gets cold--come to Florida (Pompano Beach) for the winter. You & your wife will love it!\n\nWith much respect and love, God Bless you and yours!\n\nRespectfully & with true sincerity,\n\nDenise.\n\n8/21/2020\n\nSubject: From a fan\n\nHello Peter,\n\nI just wanted to say hello and say that I have been a fan for forty years and no matter how many times I have seen the band and whoever they have in the current band the is and will only be 1 Catman.\n\nThank you,\n\nScott M.\n\n7/28/2020\n\nSubject: Hi Peter\n\nI had a poster of you singing Beth above my bed when I was a kid.\n\nThanks for being a huge part of my childhood.\n\nPeter W.\n\n7/27/2020\n\nSubject: Paisan Drummer\n\nHello Peter,\n\nYou have had an exciting life full of ups and downs. Your highs have been higher than mine, and your lows have been lower.\n\nI didn’t realize what a solid drummer you are until my band and I learned a few KISS songs. I practiced Love Her All I Can for days to get it tight. I also learned She which is so out of the ordinary. I gained a whole new respect for your skills. It’s a shame that your musicianship is overshadowed by all the hoopla.\n\nThank you for your contribution to rock and roll drums.\n\nBy the way, I live in central Connecticut, and I am half Italian. My ancestors are from Potenza, Italy. I’m not sure where yours are from. However, you always have that edge. Keep it up man!\n\nGlenn\n\n6/7/2020\n\nSubject: Peter Criss and Solo Album\n\nHi Mr Criss,\n\nI’ve recently dusted off my Peter Criss solo cassette. It was a great tour down memory lane as I recalled “air drumming”, at 10 years old, every one of those songs until I learned them all. I remember, even at that age, thinking that this album was so much better than any of the KISS albums because I could relate to the music.\n\nThroughout 5th grade, two of my friends and I took on the pretend personas of Ace, Paul, and you (I was you) and followed you guys' every move through the teen magazines and newspapers. We were intent on finding what you looked like without the makeup.\n\nI kept the drumming going eventually transitioning to a real set and performing to get myself through college.\n\nI wanted to let you know that you made a positive difference in my life despite the fact that you had no idea who I was or where I lived. Your music is still some of my favorite and I thank you for it—music critics be damned.\n\nI wish you the best and thank you for the memories.\n\nDave K.\n\n6/2/2020\n\nSubject: Fantastic Book - please read\n\nPeter,\n\nI hope this email truly finds you. I want you to know I’m 43 and been a kiss fan all my life and was really drawn to the Love Gun album when I was 4 and ever since been a Kiss fanatic. I also a Catman fanatic! I’m an amateur drummer and love your charisma and feel. You, in my opinion were the heartbeat of Kiss and without you, that intangible was never replaced. I have read your book 3 times now and love your stories. I really can relate to you. As an Italian myself I can see your passion, your anger and hurt in all the circumstances that you discussed and let me tell you, you were never out of line with those feelings. You are a passionate human being whose soul is so pure and that’s why you get hurt easy. Much like myself. I’m also glad that you found your faith stronger. God does love you and your career/life has been an inspiration to many. I just wanted to pass my thoughts on as even though I don’t know you, I feel like I know exactly who you are.\n\nKeep rocking Peter and God bless\n\nRegards,\n\nMarco\n\n5/27/2020\n\nSubject: A Fan for Life\n\nI just want to say thank you for the years of great music and enjoyment of watching your performances that I was so lucky to see several times. To me, there is not a better drummer in the rock world today that could even compare. I am just sorry that I never had the pleasure of meeting you in person. I share the memories and photos of how my bedroom walls and ceiling was covered with your pictures, posters, and every doll of you that could be purchased. Not to mention every album that you were on. My poor mother and father were so wonderful and very understanding with the music blaring and just would shake their heads. My kid loves the stories and I try to be just like my parents with his music selection. Again, Thank You, Thank You and many years of happy memories and wonderful times with your family.\n\nA fan for life,\n\nRobin R.\n\n5/18/2020\n\nSubject: After all these years\n\nSent from my iPhone Just wanted to drop you an email to let you know I have always been a fan of your drumming. As a young kid in the 70’s KISS was my favorite band and watching you on the drums inspired me to begin playing. All the years I have played and even to this day, I have only played for myself, never in a band.\n\nThanks for all the years of enjoyment.\n\nShaun C.\n\n5/17/2020\n\nSubject: Talent, success, and Kiss books\n\nPeter,\n\nI never write anyone but after reading all the books by members of Kiss twice I feel like I wanted to say something to you.\n\nYou get pummeled in Pauls book over and over. At one point he said you didn’t know enough about song structure to know what to do if he said “start at the second verse”.\n\nYou played in the same way as Bill Ward or some other great rock drummers in the 70s. You play drums as if they were a melodic instrument putting rolls and accents behind parts to enhance them and even make hooks occur in some basic bland structures. It’s instinctual and the sign of true talent. Average drummers would just play it straight with no hooks or emotional additions. You made a song like Deuce a bit of a journey through the parts adding feel and raw connection with the listener.\n\nIf someone says “start at the second verse” it may not be obvious what to play immediately because the journey and evolution of parts took you there.\n\nDuh, guess Paul does not understand that.\n\nAfter reading all the books from Kiss members twice I feel like yours is the most accurate, in that I felt like I was reading an account of the band experience from someone normal with no agenda other than being honest. Ace was 2nd.\n\nI used to play lead guitar in a band that was at one point on Casablanca before I was a member. The Godz from Columbus Ohio. I lived in Queens through the 80s and can relate to many of the stories in your book, other than success!\n\nThe era of all of this is gone, but what a wonderful thing it was !\n\nJust wanted you to know there are people with ears out here that recognize your parts were brilliant, and not because Ezrin taught you !!!!\n\nBest regards,\n\nEric M.\n\n5/3/2020\n\nSubject: I was 6 Years Old\n\nI was 6 years old when destroyer came out my favorite then and to this day was and is Peter Criss. Kiss was never the same after Peter was gone. When they reunited in the 2000s I went to spac in saratoga to see what would be my last time seeing the original line up ever perform. I will never forget that and will never forget what a great performer you were and are. Thanks Peter for the memories. Peace and god bless\n\nJeff M.\n\n5/3/2020\n\nSubject: Happy Anniversary Peter and Gigi.\n\nDear Peter and Gigi.\n\nI greet you from Ecuador.

You and KISS were a major part of my Childhood, ( I'm 56 today). I used to argue with my friends on who the best band was at the time. I put you guys up against Led Zeppelin & Black Sabbath and a host of others! Always felt bad when You Left, didn't purchase any more albums after that & hated hearing someone else sing your songs.\n\nHope Life Finds You Well!\n\nThanks Again for the Great memories!\n\nRob\n\n4/27/2020\n\nSubject: Be Safe\n\nSup bud,\n\nHope your doing well!

And it's all because of you. I even did a cover of Mainline on my band Hüligan's first album as I loved the way you performed that song. So I wanted to try my best at copying your style. I would love to send you a copy and get your opinion on my cover of it. I just wanted to let you know how much of an influence you were to me. Thanks for all the music.\n\nCheers,\n\nMatt F.\n\n1/6/2020\n\nSubject: Reflections\n\nDear Mr. Criss,\n\nI just wanted to send you a quick message and say that you are and will always be KISS to me. As reflect on my life, I can not tell you how much you mean to me and I want to thank you for all the wonderful memories that I have as a teenager growing up in the 70’s. I feel that I gravitated toward you more than any other member of kiss because you always were genuine. What you saw is what you got. And even though sometimes the edges are not that smooth they still are the most honest. I think back to your many interviews and I remember how blessed you felt at what you had achieved. You truly were the working class man of the group. I’d like to think that my work ethic was inspired by you. I don’t think you get enough credit for also being the only proud Catholic rockstar of the 70s. God bless you for always remembering the Lord and all the gifts that he gave you. Your faith has also been a connection that I feel still till this day. Don’t ever lament what could have been. Take pride in that we love you very much and you have reached so many people over the years through the gift of your music. God bless you and your family.\n\nRuss L.\n\n12/17/2019\n\nSubject: Merry Christmas, Thank You, and Appearance\\Autograph Question\n\nPeter,\n\nFirst, thank you for all of the joy you have given to so many, including my daughter, my brother, and myself. My daughter, Landry, is only 7, but is a rabid KISS fan. Her favorite KISS song is Beth, she begs me to play \"Beth I hear you callin'\" every time we get in the car and makes her mother and I laugh as she tries to emulate your voice and inflections while she is singing every word. I have been fortunate this year to meet Paul, Gene, and Ace at different events and have been able to tell them in person how much the past two years of memories that my daughter and I have shared surrounding our love for KISS has meant to me. Our crazy KISS obsession is the thing that has brought us closer these past couple of years and its something I hope we will always share. Anyway, I wanted to say thanks.\n\nAlso, I was wondering, if you were planning any new appearances this year. Hopefully, there will be one that is close enough for us to attend and get a photo with you as well. In fact, I spoke to the organizers of our local Comic Con Geek'd Con and expressed that having you would make it an EPIC event! In the meantime, I would love to be able to purchase an autographed drum head to go with my guitars from Paul, Gene, and Ace. As it stands, my KISS wall shrine is missing this very important item. I noticed that were sold out on the website and was wondering, if there would be more posted any time soon. I was also wondering, if you accepted item submissions for signature. I currently have two comics (one is the blood comic) and two albums (Destroyer and a sealed copy of ALIVE!) that won't be complete without your signature. If any of this is possible, please let me know the price and\n\nprocedure.\n\nIn any event, THANK YOU again and MERRY KISSMAS to the Catman!\n\nChris (and Landry) B.\n\n12/16/2019\n\nSubject: Thank you\n\nYou made my childhood great.

In 6th grade,I was able to get my first pair of drumsticks, I went on to greater things in drumming, endorsements etc...after that, bad decisions led me to almost dying. nonetheless, today I am a pastor. I help hundreds of people weekly. Sometimes we don't stop in life to say thank you. I wanted to tell you Thank you for your influence on making me practice more and be more.\n\nI don't expect to hear back from you, but I read your book and maybe one day I will meet you.\n\nJohn 3:16-18\n\nThanks so much!\n\nGod is bigger!\n\nDr. Gary M.\n\n12/8/2019\n\nSubject: Hero\n\nThank You for being the best drummer ever.\n\nI’m forever thankful.\n\nRalph S.\n\n12/1/2019\n\nSubject: Huge Fan\n\nYou were my first influence in music and today I am a music teacher.

I won't go into detail because that is not what this is about.......so back to you.\n\nBasically wanted to let you know that you not kiss played a role in my upbringing an I love an respect you for the gifts you have given the world. Cause let's face it without u the 1 true Musician In a prop band who knows what would of became of kiss.\n\nDefinitely not knocking anyone in the group...Group Genes first name should be Genius btw.\n\nAlso I think a sitcom of the beginning days of kiss would be crazy cool but Gene probably already trade marked it.\n\nThanks for your time bro peace out an rock on.\n\nDoug\n\n9/19/2019\n\nSubject: Treasured Memories\n\nDear Peter,\n\nFirst let me thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope this message finds you well. I am working to share memories of my life with my children and grandson, many of which include you and KISS. I was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer in January 2018. Been a tough road, but I am in remission. The long term prognosis however is not great, which leads me to my current project of capturing memories of the things that had the most profound impact on my life so they may be shared with those I love and those who know me best.\n\nMy memories of KISS started in 1978 at the age of 8 when is saw you play in Phoenix, Arizona. I begged my father to take me for weeks, and despite all of his objections, he took me. The addiction had begun and remained my entire life. What stood out most to me was watching you and Ace play. You taking center stage to sing Beth, and Ace playing the guitar are memories which have remained the strongest throughout my life. I was so inspired by you, I dressed as Peter Criss and Ace for several years afterward in a wonderful costumes my mother spent weeks putting together.\n\nYes I have seen Kiss many times since, and without knocking those who came after you, there just was not the same impact.\n\nI wanted to thank you for everything and let you know that you touched lives and created memories which will be shared. I have tried to meet you several times, but fate has always intervened. The conference in October will not be a trip I can make due to ongoing chemo sessions, but I do hope to make it to see you soon.\n\nAs a last thank you, I appreciate all you do for cancer awareness and fundraising. Please keep up the work, it is so important to those who understand the cost.\n\nGod Bless,\n\nDoug C.\n\n9/11/2019\n\nSubject: Read your book\n\nI purchased and read your book. Thank you so much for opening up about your life.\n\nI admire how you have always managed to weather the storms of life and come back stronger than before. I wish you the very best.\n\nBurrisbo\n\n9/7/2019\n\nSubject: Thanks for the Hugs!\n\nHey Peter and Gigi…\n\nJust wanted to give a whole hearted shout out to Peter Criss and Gigi for the treatment we received in Charlotte NC. It’s been a couple years back now…but I finally got around to messaging you guys about our experience.\n\nWe came to the “Mad Monster Party” in Charlotte, NC…specifically to meet Peter. I came to the event to get a Picture with Peter…which I did. I also came to the event to get my Peter Criss “Solo Album” signed”.\n\nI came to the event with my wife and my younger son. We all waited in line for quite a while to get my album signed. When I finally got up and got my chance to have Peter sign my album…it was an experience that was quite unexpected. I figured it would just be me allowed in to get the album signed and meet Peter. Unexpectedly, Peter insisted that we ALL come in to the room. Peter greeted not only me but also my wife and my son.\n\nPeter invited us all into the “autograph” room. Peter signed my album and then he got up, came around the table and insisted that he give us all a full on “Italian hug”….cause that what Italians do. It was completed unexpected. He gave me, then my wife and my son a full on Hug…and thanked us all.\n\nMy wife loved it (being Italian herself). And…my son has never forgotten it.\n\nThank you Peter for being such a straight up and awesome guy…and making memories for not only me (huge KISS fan) but also for my wife and son. We will never forget you.\n\nWith the most favored regards…\n\nDick B.\n\n“Keep rockin’ and kickin’ brother”\n\n9/2/2019\n\nSubject: The Best\n\nPeter,\n\nYou are the Best Drummer the Rock Band KISS ever!

I have weathered the ups and downs with this band for about 42 years straight, and could not think of what my life would be without your music and your shows. The original 4 are still MAGIC to me, even though I forget that once in awhile.\n\nWell, tonight (today now?) I remembered. So I just wanted give a real, heartfelt Thank You for the Happiness, Excitement, and sometimes even tears you have given me.\n\nP.S. By tears, I mean in a good way. I Can't Stop the Rain still hits me deep every time I listen to it.\n\nP.P.S. You and I have actually met one time (at Mark St.John's house in California), and I've always wanted to thank you properly for putting up with a star struck kid, answering my questions, and signing autographs. Sorry if that was awkward for you ( but I gotta admit it was pretty darned awesome for me).\n\nTHANK YOU,\n\nAnd GOD bless, Sir\n\nDouglas T.\n\n8/4/2019\n\nSubject: Fan\n\nJust to let you know you are one of the best drummers in the world!!!

I consider it a privilege to be able to make a good living with music in some fashion, and it all started with you and your bandmates.\n\nAnd while I am eventually moved from drums to bass (I am a huge Geddy fan), I never forgot what Kiss and you meant to my formation as a musician. I am grateful for the experiences that Kiss set in motion in my life.\n\nThank you and bless you and your family!\n\nChris F.\n\n5/18/2019\n\nSubject: CATMAN\n\nGreetings Peter Criss!\n\nYour feel on drums has been a huge influence for me. You gave Kiss music the classic glam party feel no one else could have. I've been really on a mission to listen to anything and everything Kiss related. The solo 1978 albums showed everyone's personalities and I thought yours was so crazy and cool! It had the best album cover art as well (I rock the shirt all the time). Then Cat #1 caught my attention, what a solid album! I'm 30 now and play every instrument I can think of, what I look for in music is ideas, and you have a ton of great ideas. You are a true icon, thanks for all the inspiration.\n\nSean P.\n\n5/19/2019\n\nSubject: Mr Criss\n\nI'm a young female drummer in the UK play with a all female heavy metal screamo death metal band .

Kiss is a huge part of my life, I’ve been to the shows, signings etc etc. I have always wanted to reach out to you personally and say thank you. Thank you for making me the drummer I am today. When I first heard the drums on Detroit Rock City when I was 7 years old I knew that day I wanted to be a drummer. You are my biggest influence when it comes to the drums. I want to say thank you again for being my biggest inspiration to play drums! Thanks Peter!\n\nTyler E.\n\n4/20/2019\n\nSubject: Your A Kick Ass Drummer\n\nHey Peter!\n\nI’m 14 years old and absolutely love rock, I play guitar and love KISS and any thing Rock N Roll. I just want to say thank you for such an impact you’ve had on my life. God Bless You Peter Criss. You’re Forever Catman!\n\nSincerely,\n\nAidan K.\n\n4/17/2019\n\nSubject: Drumming\n\nHello Peter, I’m sorry to bother you again but I just wanted to tell you that I finally got my own drum kit on Monday. It’s an electric kit and I’m so in love with it and I think I’m really progressing. I thought you’d like to know that I have worked out how to play Strutter, Rock and roll all night, Love Gun, I was made for loving you and I love it loud. I can also play some of your solo stuff, The Cat, Bad Attitude, Tears (my favourite of your solo songs) and most of the Out Of Control album. I’d like to thank you for being one of the greatest drummers ever, without you I never would have taken up drums or been a fan of KISS. Thank you Peter. God bless you.\n\nCameron\n\n3/17/2019\n\nSubject: Just reaching out\n\nDear Peter,\n\njust wanted to say hello.miss you very much.your songs are very much a big part of my life.I listen to your stories how you helped build a band that once ruled the rock n roll world.I'm not sorry you are not part of this mockery they call kiss today.I just wish I could see you perform one more time .I'm just a die hard Peter criss fan .be safe stay strong.your number one fan since 1976.\n\nCharles W.\n\n3/11/2019\n\nSubject: THE ONE AND ONLY CAT-MAN\n\nHi Pete,\n\nI just want to thank you for making me want to be a drummer and now almost 40 years later I still love hearing you and seeing videos of your performances . You are now and will always be THE ONLY CAT-MAN ! ! I was just listening to You Matter To Me and remember hearing it for the first time and thinking how cool it was and still is . You will always be my favorite drummer and just wanted to let you know that even when I play now I have a picture of you taped on the top batter edge of my\n\ngreen sparkle bass so you’re always keepin’ a cat’s-eye on me .\n\nThanks again, much love to you and yours,\n\nDave Y.\n\n2/15/2019\n\nSubject: Hey Peter\n\nHey Peter,\n\nI just wanted to say what an inspiration you are to so many. Including me. Back in the day, the first Kiss record I ever got was Love Gun. On 8 track, no less! I then bought Alive 2 and I remember opening the sleeve and gravitated right towards that huge black Pearl drum set with the gong, and said, I want to do that! Your drumming was the reason I picked up the sticks. I loved your book, and as a fellow cancer survivor and Saved Thru His Grace, I feel a kinship with you and so many others!\n\nShane G.\n\n2/20/2019\n\nSubject: Happy birthday!!\n\nHappy birthday Peter!!\n\nWe hope you have a great day!!\n\nLove, Tristan Jack & Sara\n\n12/18/2018\n\nSubject: Fan Letter\n\nHey Peter!!\n\nMy name is Kit H. I am 26 years old and have been a KISS fan my whole life. I play in a band called Pressed In Black. We tour around and write our own music. I play guitar and sing in the band. Your songs are some my favorites in KISS. I really love your solo records through the 80s and Blue Moon Over Brooklyn is fantastic! I hope you can make it to Indianapolis one of these days ! I never got the chance to see you play with KISS because my parents worried about me getting hurt at Market Square Arena in 1998. I was just a kid and had to stay at grandma's during that show. I was pretty sad. Oh well life goes on. Anyways I hope you are well and wish you nothing but the best!! Keep rocking\n\nKit\n\n12/14/2018\n\nSubject: Thanks\n\nHello Peter,\n\nPlease keep doing your incredible meet and greet autograph signings in 2019! These events are so memorable and important to your countless fans who truly enjoy meeting you! Thank you for your priceless contributions to Kiss and I will definitely attend any meet and greet sessions you have in the future!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoe J.\n\nLouisville, KY\n\n11/27/2018\n\nSubject: Thanks!\n\nHey Pete!\n\nJust wanted to say thanks for the original KISS music! Just wanted to say that as a fan of the true KISS, I can’t stoop to paying money to see the current KISS line up do an “End of the Road” tour. I haven’t seen them since you and Ace were there and as far as I’m concerned, the Farewell Tour has already been done.\n\nAgain, thanks for the music!\n\nMike T.\n\n11/18/2018\n\nSubject: An inspiration and blessing....\n\nSir…I was brought up in a musical family where my Mom played piano in church and I was blessed enough to hear her practice at home nightly. Music was and is in my blood. But it was the Paul Lynde Halloween Special that changed my life. Seeing KISS come down in that cage and ripping Detroit Rock City seriously blew me away. At the time my Mom was trying to find an instrument for me to play. She tried to teach me piano but I would have none of it. Same for guitar lessons…ain’t gonna happen. But when I saw you…everything changed. God smiled on me that night and my life has never been the same.\n\nI was blessed to see you perform several times. Impressed does not even come close. You sir have been and continue to be an inspiration to me and drummers worldwide. I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for all your work, creativity, sacrifice, and inspiration. And on another note…not to speak ill of anyone, but the current KISS line up is a huge letdown. Eric Singer is a phenomenal drummer…but he’s not you. He’s wearing a mask in the form of your makeup. Tommy is a amazing guitarist…but he’s not Ace. And I am offended as a fan. And unless you are making an appearance on the farewell tour…I won’t be attending. However I do plan to meet you at a personal appearance in 2019.\n\nGod bless you Sir…congrats to beating cancer. It took my Mom but it didn’t get you. Thank you again for being my inspiration. And I keep you and your family in my prayers.\n\nGod bless…\n\nChris T\n\n10/10/2018\n\nSubject: Hi Peter\n\nHi Peter,\n\nJust felt the need to tell you how incredible your singing is. You have an amazing voice. Just listened to Hard Luck Woman and I'm just blown away...again! Wore the vinyl out on that album as a kid. Wish you'd have sang more in the band. Anyhoo, just sayi'. Thanks for sharing you music with me all these years.\n\nJ\n\n9/20/2018\n\nSubject: Thank you Peter\n\nPeter,\n\nI've been a loyal fan of yours since I was 11 years old. I'm now 50.\n\nI want to thank you for inspiring me... giving me a sense of purpose and for being a rock hero.\n\nMy single biggest regret is never seeing you live and not meeting you in person.\n\nYou are quite literally amazing and a one off.\n\nRock on brother.\n\nThank you\n\nAL\n\n9/19/2018\n\nSubject: Book - From a Cancer Survivor\n\nDear Catman,\n\nI loved your book. It was honest, refreshing, humbling (yes, for this reader) and most importantly funny as fuck! You’ve got a way with words. You were definitely the soul of KISS.\n\nThe past year, the love of my life died, my dad died and I had open-heart surgery. I’m also a cancer survivor (testicular). Your book reminded me how important the man upstairs is in times of sorrow. Thank you.\n\nGod bless you and your family, Mr. Criss. Much respect.\n\nRene\n\nFormer KISS fan and always a fan of the ONLY Catman\n\n9/19/2018\n\nSubject: Solo Album 1978\n\nPeter,\n\n40 years ago today I was 11 years old and I bought your first solo album.\n\nYour album was an honest Peter Criss album and it reflected who you are, your heart and style.\n\nAfter all this time I still enjoy the music.\n\nDavid J.\n\n9/7/2018\n\nSubject: Kiss\n\nDear Mr.Criss,\n\nI just want to say hello,and thank you so much for sharing your talent with the world.I wish you the best of health and happiness now and in the future, you will always be the Catman in my mind and heart,I dont care what Paul or Gene says.I only hope that someday they will admit to the errors that they made.Again,thank you,and God bless!\n\nSincerely,\n\nRichard M.\n\n9/6/2018\n\nSubject: Peter Criss and Cancer\n\nDear Peter,\n\nThe very first concert I ever saw was the Kiss destroyer tour at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium in Buffalo New York. I am 55 years old after seeing that concert it ruined it for every band I was to see after that no one could come close to you guys.I played the kiss alive 100,000 years drum solo till I had it down beat for beat at 14 years of age and aspired to be as good as you. Something that needs to be said Peter you are and will always be one of the worlds finest drummers.I was recently diagnosed with stage four carcinoma cancer and currently attending roswell cancer institute for treatments. In case I don't make it I just wanted you to know if you don't already that you are loved the world over and I for one appreciate and have to say thank you for all those years of pouring your heart out on those records and concerts.\n\nHolly G.\n\n9/6/2018\n\nSubject: Hello Mr. Criss\n\nHello Mr. Criss\n\nI hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I decided to reach out to today simply because I'm sitting home and watching old footage of various interviews from the 70s & 80s. As a kid, like most of the world, I was exposed to you and your music because of your involvement with KISS. But as so often happens in life, sometimes the things we love as a child fall to the wayside as we grow up. About four years ago, I rediscovered KISS music..not the current band, but the real band, and fell in love all over again.\n\nAt 45, I've begun the slow trip to realizing that there are more birthdays behind me than are likely to be ahead of me, and begun to look back. I've struggled with various addictions and health concerns.\n\nI found your site because honestly you've always been my favorite member of the band, and honestly I knew very little about the man behind the cat. After reading about you here, I came to understand some of what you've endured and wanted to tell you that it inspired me. In many ways the Catman was a hero like any comic action star put out by Marvel..almost larger than life, and to read about the man himself and the trials and tribulations of his life made him, not the character more of a hero.\n\nI was saddened to read you had retired and that seeing you perform was no longer an option, but I still hope to meet you in person one day.\n\nIn closing, I'd like to wish you well and to thank you for giving me some of the best memories of my childhood.\n\nGod bless you Mr. Criss.\n\nYour fan,\n\nMichal\n\n8/14/2018\n\nSubject: My gratitude\n\nJust wanted to say thank you for all the years of joy you've gave me with your music! Your drumming and vocals are absolutely one of a kind.\n\nMuch Love,\n\nBob R.\n\n7/23/2018\n\nSubject: THANK YOU PETE !!!\n\nHEY PETER,\n\nI JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR A LOT OF GREAT YEARS AND IF NOT FOR YOU I PROBLEY WOULD HAD NEVER PICKED UP A DRUM STICK BUT BECAUSE OF YOU I DID !! LOVE YA BROTHER !!\n\n-GARY D.\n\nFALL RIVER MA.\n\n7/20/2018\n\nSubject: Feelings on KISS and You\n\nHi Peter,\n\nI grew up listening and watching kiss over the years ever since the late 70's. And I was listening to so.e of your interviews with Eddie Trunk. I have to agree with you that the original band was one of a kind. There cannot be another Catman or Another Space Ace. Yes they wear the Makeup but they are not u guys. They shouldn't in my mind be trying to impersonate you guys by wearing the makeup and playing your riffs and licks. Also as much as a fan as I am of KISS, I feel that the new music of the band lacks what it once had. There isn't anything as good as the original sound. I've heard Paul talking about you in the negative and I feel that is shallow of him to do. Clearly trying to push you guys out of the light so to speak. I think the wealth and the fame went to their heads and they forget how you all got there and what made it work. I hate the politics involved in the industry. You are great as well as Ace and they shouldn't be bashing u guys that way. The train is gonna end someday for them and hopefully they will see the light one day. Take care Peter and keep rocking.\n\nFrank M.\n\n6/18/2018\n\nSubject: LONDON V.I.P. EXPERIENCE\n\nHi Peter,\n\nIt was a total blast to meet you last night in London. You surpassed my expectations with your kindness and patience in dealing with all the fans. I hope you remember me, haha. I was near the end. Your wife Gigi was extremely nice to me as well as all the other fans. Thanks for the pizza again! I had to drive back and be home the next day otherwise I would have seen you again throughout the weekend. Til next time…\n\nJames S.\n\n4/16/2018\n\nSubject: NJ Horror Con/Thank You!\n\nDear Peter,\n\nI just wanted to again thank you for taking time to travel and meet with your fans. As I told you during the meet and greet at NJ Horror Con, discovering the music of KISS was life-changing for me and had an incredible impact on inspiring me to become the musician I am today.\n\nThough dominantly a guitar player throughout my career, I’ve always loved drums and played drums as well in several bands. When I started as a young teen, the first time I pieced together a kit I remember I HAD to have Zildjian cymbals because “that’s what Peter plays!”. I HAD to have a set of Pearls because (before DW), “that’s what Peter plays!”\n\nHell...I even had the Ahead signature Peter Criss sticks! If it was what the Catman played, it had to be the best and I wanted to be as rock and roll as you!\n\nAnyway...I’m rambling. My point is it really was an incredible experience to finally shake hands with the one and only Catman and to be able to share that experience with my wife and kids as well. Thank you for taking time to speak with all of us and for encouraging the kids to take their education seriously...we all just really had such an incredible experience meeting you and it was a true pleasure!\n\nThanks for all the great music and for everything. God bless!\n\nBrandon R.\n\n3/13/2018\n\nSubject: Thank you to Peter & Gigi\n\nHey Peter,\n\nThis is Eric Z…You probably don’t remember me, but I have played in many Kiss tribute bands impersonating Paul off and on over the years since 1995… Anyway, the reason why I am reaching out to you is because; some of my friends & I were at the Horror Con in NJ last week & we were so blown away by the hospitality that you and Gigi showed us.. I was so touched by Gigi’s kindness that I’m not even sure that I properly thanked her…So please, tell Gigi “Thank you” for me from the bottom of my heart…\n\nI told my friends on the way home that the award for “Bitchen-est Kiss Wife” goes to Gigi Criss” – Ha! Ha!!\n\nYour Gigi is a beautiful & amazing person…It’s easy for me to understand why you married her…I love you both so much!! …Kiss Rules!!...until I see you again…\n\nEric Z\n\n3/12/2018\n\nSubject: Horror Con\n\nHello Peter and Gigi\n\nI want to tell you that it was an amazing experience meeting you and takling to the both of you a few weeks ago. You were very kind to me and I still find it amazing that you live so close to me. After meeting all members and being a fan for almost 40 years every time I see Peter I get treated like a friend.\n\nThe rest of the group treats you like your just a pocket full of cash and mean nothing to their life. Actions speak louder than words with me. You were always my favorite singer and musician in Kiss. I told one of my friends how cool you guys were and he says well they live a half an hour away I should invite you guys over for a BBQ in the summer. You both have an open invite for any BBQ I have.\n\nI’d love to show you some of the Kiss Paintings Ive done over the years and give a tour of my museum. I know you are busy doing the expos and probably don’t have the time.\n\nJust putting it out there.\n\nWishing you both continued good health, good fortune and all my love.\n\nSteve Z\n\n3/7/2018\n\nSubject: Greetings from North Carolina\n\nHi Peter and GiGi!\n\nIt was so nice to finally meet you guys in person! I've waited for more than 30 years and it was well worth the wait! You guys are so very kind and loving. Although I didn't to say what I really wanted to because I was so overwhelmed by your presence I completely forgot . I always wished to me Peter one day and prayed it would happen and it did! I hope to meet you again someday and talk to you about Peters career. Again thank you for all you do for the fans we love You!\n\nForever grateful\n\nAnita M.\n\n3/6/2018\n\nSubject: Hey Peter! Just a note of thanks from a fan...\n\nHey Peter!\n\nI just wanted to take a minute to write to you in hopes that you would get the chance to read this. I met you this past weekend at New Jersey Horror Con, I was the one who brought those old polariod shots of you guys from the December 1977 show at the Garden (if you remember me!) that my dad took when he was a kid. I have been looking at those pictures since I was 5 years old when my dad first started getting me into Kiss, and to be able to share that with you and watch you look at them was surreal!\n\nI just wanted to quickly thank you for everything you have contributed to the world of music, you have inspired me and so many others to pick up a pair of drum sticks and just play our hearts out. I grew up admiring you and I will always continue to do so!\n\nI will be going to Gene's Vault event in NYC in a few months, and I heard through the grape vine that you were invited to join... I think I speak for myself and all of the other fans attending when I say that it would be a true honor to have you there!\n\nThank you for everything you have done, you are truly an inspiration in my life and the lives of so many others!\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew H.\n\n3/5/2018\n\nSubject: HorrorCon\n\nHi Peter,\n\nIt was great seeing you yesterday at HorrorCon.\n\nI just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to talk w/ my son, Daniel and I. At the show. He was so excited to meet you!\n\nYou, along w/ the staff working the event were all very courteous and accommodating and really helped to make it a special day for us both.\n\nFor me, one of the joys of being a father is sharing some of my best memories w/ my son and watching him enjoy them as well. You, along w/ KISS are certainly a big part of that.\n\nThank you again for everything! We hope to see you again soon at future events.\n\nAll my best,\n\nChris C.\n\n3/4/2018\n\nSubject: NJ Signing event\n\nPeter:\n\nWho knows if you read these or if your people read these, but it was great to meet you, take a photo and have you sign my guitar alongside Ace. The few minutes were memorable, and I for one appreciate you being in such good spirits for all the fans who came to see you this weekend. Hope the time was as enjoyable for you; it has to be fulfilling to meet so many people who remain forever fans.\n\nBest,\n\nJay L.\n\n3/3/2018\n\nSubject: Thank you!\n\nThank you so much for signing my guitar today..thank you to both of you for being so nice..it was one of the best days of my life..being a fan for over 40 years,it was unbelievable to meet you..hope I can meet you again in the future...\n\nThanks again for everything...\n\nKev\n\n3/3/2018\n\nSubject: Joe & Scott - NJ Horror Con\n\nHi Gigi,\n\nSo good to see you today...!...You guys are right \"Everyday Above Ground is a Good Day' Your story about the other Father & Son friends/fans reminded us to\n\nappreciate everyday.\n\nAnd today was a great day.....Till we meet again...\n\nGod Bless\n\nJoseph & Scott D.\n\n3/3/2018\n\nSubject: Thank you!\n\nGood evening Peter and Gigi,\n\nThank you both so very much for today...what an honor to see you both again!!

You and Gigi were absolute sweethearts! Thanks for being willing to sign me. I have decided to make the drive with me teen daughters to see you in New Jersey this coming weekend. We will see you for a photo, not sure I can swing more autographs but I know they are so looking forward to meeting The Catman!\n\nThanks for doing another one of these events Peter, wished I could have made the NY Expo in June.\n\nEric A.\n\n2/23/2018\n\nSubject: Thanks Peter & Gigi - Mad Monster\n\nHi Peter,\n\nThanks so much for an amazing experience meeting you again at Mad Monster Charlotte. SO cool to be able to meet you again and all the time you spent with me. Of all the celebs I’ve met, you are definitely one of the most sincere I’ve ever met. One of the highlights of our weekend was Gigi stopping by our table at the restaurant and sitting down and sharing stories. Just an amazing surreal time. Thank you both again for the music and for the wonderful souls that both of you are!\n\nChuck C.\n\n2/23/2018\n\nSubject: Mad Monster 2018\n\nHi Peter\n\nThis is Joseph.

As a 13 year old boy, not many people my age could agree that kiss is the greatest rock band on earth, and that you and john bonham are the greatest drummers to ever play. I drum myself and I want to you to know that sometimes I just listen to your music and try out the so many beats you somehow manage to master.\n\nThanks man, keep on rockin.\n\nGrady A.\n\n1/22/2018\n\nSubject: Hello Peter! Can't wait to meet you\n\nHey Peter!\n\nI was so delighted to hear that you were coming to Charlotte NC for the Mad Monster Party in February. Other than an email or two over the years, I've never had the opportunity to meet you. So, this is something I can't wait for!\n\nIt's been a dream of mine to meet you. You always struck me as the most personable, down to earth member of KISS and I've been a fan of not only your music over the years, but for your work as an advocate for Breast Cancer research, and how firmly you've always stood for your religion. I am a Christian, and a guitarist in a Praise and Worship band in my home church in Virginia, so seeing someone like you keep God first in your life always means a good deal to me.\n\nAnyway, I am looking forward to seeing you in a few weeks. Just want to thank you for all the great music memories and I finally can't wait to say hello to you in person.\n\nGod Bless!\n\nYour friend\n\nKameron D\n\n12/20/2017\n\nSubject: A 52 year old who feels like it is back in the 70’s\n\nHi happy birthday.\n\nLast month I heard Beth on a radio station and boy the memories it brought back. I was one of the unfortunate ones that never got to see kiss in concert when you and ace were in the band. I would not go now because without you guys it isn’t kiss. Hey the 70’s were a great time and yes I can understand how drugs, drinking ,girls all come into play. You were flying high on stardom and why shouldn’t you. I just read your book last month for the first time and everything that happened was there and you told the truth about the scene in the 70’s. But you also got help. I am so sick of watching u tube videos of Paul and gene putting you down and one time Paul made a video imitating you which was not funny. I have read a little of Paul’s book he talked about being teased and talked about his right ear. Then he should know it is not cool and stop. To me kiss would not be what it is if it weren’t for the four original members starting something. Boy I tell you how fast people forget who helped you get where you are and just drop you like nothing. Then to read Paul and gene made you out to be employees you and ace and not one of the 4 that made kiss what it is today. It makes me sick. I am so thankful for you. I love the saying forgive to live and since I read your book I take that saying to heart. I will not buy or watch anything from kiss that you are not in because to me it is just money for Paul and gene and not the fans. You have made a 52 year old teenager happy I will always be listening on the radio “Beth I hear you calling” and the right voice singing it. You did not sell out your makeup they sold you out.\n\nLots of love and many more birthdays !!!!!\n\nJackie G.\n\n12/18/2017\n\nSubject: My favorite\n\nEverything you sang during your time with Kiss was the best. I was lucky enough to see you perform Beth in Detroit for the first show of the reunion tour. Definitely a highlight of my concert going experiences.\n\nI seen you last in Grand Rapids for the Psycho Circus tour.\n\nYou are my favorite Kiss member. I love every song you sang and the solo album was incredible.\n\nThanks for sharing your voice and talent.\n\nJerry P.\n\n12/14/2017\n\nSubject: Life outside KISS\n\nDear Peter,\n\nAs Jazz and soul lover myself, I hope that you will follow your routes and give your funs a taste of the music you really love and show your true skills by means of making new music/new album, which is honest and true to these routes and without any connection whatsoever to your KISS legacy.\n\nTake Care,\n\nJ. Yoram\n\n11/19/2017\n\nSubject: An absolute dream come true!\n\nHi Peter,\n\nGrowing up a millennial compared to the gen. X-ers, you wouldn’t expect me to be a mega KISS fan. I’ll never forget the time I was handed Alive! and Alive II; the covers and pictures instantly blew me away. I remember staring for hours at your endless drum kit, while listening to some gem such as Makin’ Love, and thinking, “this is what I want to do!” The way you approached the drums was second to none.\n\nFrom that point forward my life became drums and KISS. I started begging my parents for as much KISS footage, memorabilia, and albums I could get my hands on. I was even dressed as the Catman for Halloween a few times. As I grew older, I started to learn more about you. I’ll never forget when I came home from school, and came home to a crappy drum kit. It was a three piece with awful hardware and stock cymbals, but to me it was a Ferrari. You couldn’t get me off of that thing.\n\nThe first songs I learned to play weren’t the hits, however they were the songs that seven year olds in 2004 don’t listen to. I was playing Hotter than Hell, Deuce, Rocket Ride (attempting that insane drum fill at the end), and mastering your flawless performance of God of Thunder and 100,000 years on both Alive! and Alive II. It is because of you Peter that I found joy in drums, jazz, and hard rock music.\n\nIn years to come I earned the privilege to meet Ace, Gene, and Paul, but there was a big hole in my heart... I never met you. Well, in June of 2017 in NYC that all changed. My mother and I drove an hour to NYC, and we both met you. You were everything opposite of the other guys. You took the time to answer everyone of my questions, and we could have sat there all night talking drums, KISS, Gene Krupa, and touring. You had some amazing stories, especially how you survived cancer. The one thing that stood out to me was when I handed you my Alive! Album (which was my dad’s from the ‘70s) signed by the rest of the guys, and I said “Peter, will you complete this album?” And you looked at me and said “I’d be honored.” For a 21 year old, diehard fan, that made my year.\n\nPeter, I want to thank you and Gigi (who was also an angel) for everything. From the long time you spent with me, to the compliments you gave my mother and I, and for telling me stories I always wanted to hear directly from you. Peter, you are my Gene Krupa, and this picture means as much to me as yours with him. Congratulations on your retirement, it is much deserved!\n\nThanks Cat, for everything,\n\nStephen B.\n\n10/28/2017\n\nSubject: Many thanks\n\nJust wanted to let you know that I picked up sticks as a kid because of you. Thank you for all your years of enjoyment for myself and other fans.\n\nThanks,\n\nDavid P.\n\n9/30/2017\n\nSubject: The Sugar Papa Likes, Can't stop the Rain.\n\nHey Pete.\n\nI'm a piano player. I have always been a huge fan. I've seen you in makeup, 96, Greensboro NC. Beth is the best track on all of Destroyer. Even as a hardcore rocker, as a muscician, Beth is am iconic achievement. I have performed Beth, Can't stop the Rain (great tune!) and The Sugar Papa likes. Just wanted to congratulate you on a great career, and for retiring from Kiss with class. My life has been better because of your music. I only ever painted my face like yours on Halloween. Your the best, the one and only, Catman.\n\nMatthew F.\n\n9/16/2017\n\nSubject: Final shows\n\nDidn't get to go to the Melbourne show as I live on the other side of the country but have seen the highlights on YouTube plus the cutting room show. You certainly went out in style. What a great way to end a live career and a lot a balls to put on a show with songs you have never played live before. You pulled it off big time & proved what a legend you are. Hope we haven't heard the last of you new music wise. Still waiting for the rock album you have talked about many times and in your book. I am also a cancer survivor & had a huge Kiss collection but sold it all to pay for treatment and bills because I couldn't work for five years. The only thing I kept was the MTV Unplugged poster with all six of you on stage & made it a goal to meet all six of you guys and get the poster signed. I have meet the other five and tryed hard to meet you on the reunion tour in Australia but wasn't meant to be I guess. Was thinking about posting the poster over for you to sign but too risky I think. Anyway God bless and thanks for the many years of enjoyment you have given me.\n\nTerry :)\n\n8/27/2017\n\nSubject: Thank you\n\nI’d just like to say thank you for all you have contributed to the rock and roll world and the world of drumming. You were my inspiration for picking up the sticks and starting my path to learning drums. It was a day in the life of a 10 year old boy who had just finished a violin lesson, and while in the car with my mom driving home, I got up the nerve to say to her, “Mom, I don’t want to play the violin anymore. I want to play the drums like Peter Criss from Kiss.” After avoiding her trying to swat at me for delivering this news, my parents never once tried to persuade me from not following my passion. From that 10 year old boy and a Premier snare drum to present day playing in my own original rock band, I’ve had many influences and heros, but none will match my original inspiration for wanting to be onstage doing what I love to do, play and make people happy listening to music.\n\nThank you again for all that you do!\n\nMuch love and peace,\n\nAlan H.\n\n8/3/2017\n\nSubject: All-Time Favorite\n\nDear Peter,\n\nI'm 18 years old and KISS is my all-time favorite band!! I wish that I grew up in the 70's so I could experience the original group in all its glory. Thissummer, I got the chance to meet Gene Simmons in Knoxville, TN, and I really would like to meet the rest of the members, including you and Ace. It was very sad at how the both of you were treated in your exiting of the band. Nothing can compare to the original lineup!!!\n\nThanks!!\n\nWeston H.\n\n7/17/2017\n\nSubject: Thanks from Australia!\n\nHi Peter,\n\nhow are you? My name's Dan, musician from Melbourne. I was at your Melbourne farewell show and want to say thanks for the many years you've given to us fans, you've been a great musical inspiration in my life with your drumming and vocals. Like you, I've been into big band, jazz and all sorts of music for a long time. I feel like so many people are unaware of the all time greats, Sinatra, Bennet & Martin to name a few, especially in the rock world. It was great to see your show, looking forward to hearing the rock album that you've been planning & thanks again for all the years! To a happy retirement!\n\n- Dan\n\n7/10/2017\n\nSubject: Thank you\n\nI learned to play drums and guitar because of you. I later went in to the Marines. I retired from the Corps and again play drums and guitar. You made my childhood perfect. Thank you.\n\nScott K.\n\n7/8/2017\n\nSubject: Thank You Peter Criss\n\nDear Peter Criss,\n\nYou are an inspiration to many people around the world including me and I thank you for that! Thank you for all the wonderful songs you have given us all these years! You were our one and only Catman! Thank you! Thank you!\n\nThank you Peter Criss!\n\nAngelo C.\n\n7/2/2017\n\nSubject: 1975 Drumstick\n\nPeter,\n\nI have been a huge fan since the beginning. Sad to see you ending your career. Wish you the best! I still have my 1975 drum stick from your live show in San Diego with Rush. You threw it out when it broke, and I was the lucky guy that got it. I sat in the front row right in front of Gene with my girl friend from high school, who is now my wife of 40 years! I also have Genes blood still on it and it is still bright red! Y'all brought me and my wife many years of happiness and great memories. The good old days .\n\nLove you!\n\nArt D.\n\nPS would love to meet you some day. If your ever in Texas\n\n7/1/2017\n\nSubject: Thank You\n\nDear Peter,\n\nI came across your website and I felt compelled to reach out to express my gratitude and to say “thank you” for your inspiration.\n\nI grew up in Cleveland (late 70’s) listening to Kiss records and particularly your drumming. My favourite record is the band’s debut album but I also really enjoy the drum track on “It’s not smoke” which I don’t think was officially released. You inspired me to pickup the drum sticks as a teenager and I still practice drums (I use Yamaha Maple Custom Absolutes and Paiste 2002s) today.\n\nI live in Calgary these days and being that today is July 1st, I wanted to wish you and your family a Happy Canada Day.\n\nVery best,\n\nTom J.\n\n6/25/2017\n\nSubject: Loved Your Book\n\nHi Peter,\n\nI wanted to say hello and I hope you are feeling well.\n\nI just got done with your book and I have to say, I thought it was well written. I really enjoyed your stories and wished that it kept going.\n\nI ran into an experience in the last month that left me with grief and disappointment and your last chapter where you discuss your take on religion really got to me in a positive way.\n\nThank you so much for all you did and for all you do.\n\nMay successes come one after the other for you and your family.\n\nThank you so much,\n\nMichael D.\n\n6/25/2017\n\nSubject: Cool Website, Peter!\n\nJust chilling out this Sunday afternoon, being big time lazy and nostalgic. Been surfing and found your site and especially liked \"The Cats Meow\".... Very cool. Saw you in the late 70's play the old Chicago Stadium. I think I was 12. It was my first concert. Man I feel old sometimes! Dude, you were my favorite member and when you left, so did I. Anyway, you're looking good and sounding super positive. That's good inspiration.\n\nPeace, and thanks for sharing.\n\nKen F.\n\n6/25/2017\n\nSubject: Congratulations !!!\n\nGood day Mr. Críss !\n\nI am Omar Rosas, from Guadalajara, Jalisco México.\n\nI just want to say, that you are for me the best artist on the world.\n\nI am a 43 years old man, when I have 7 years old I hear your Peter Crisis Solo album, Special the Don't you let me down song, I now in that time, that you are a very Special man.\n\nThank you for made that álbum.\n\nBest regards,\n\nOmar R.\n\n6/20/2017\n\nSubject: Thank you!\n\nPeter,\n\nI just wanted to drop you a line to thank you for finally performing some of your solo tunes. Seeing video of you singing Words and You Matter to Me makes me feel really good. Those are some of my favorite songs. Thank you!\n\nGod bless you,\n\nGeoff\n\n5/30/2017\n\nSubject: I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THE SONG \"BETH\"\n\nDear Peter Criss:\n\nI am a huge fan of your song “BETH”. Every time I hear it I have to stop and listen to it. It makes me happyJ.\n\nKeep on Rocking & Rolling!!!\n\nMary B\n\n5/25/2107\n\nSubject: Hey\n\nJust wanted to say I am 50yrs old and you have been my favorite drummer my whole life. Was a big KISS fan as a kid and all I wanted to do was meet you in person. Well a lot of time has passed and that never happened and just thought I would write you this email. Just want to thank you for being a great drummer and person and wish you the best.\n\nThanks Jeff\n\n5/15/2017\n\nSubject: Fan Mail to Pete\n\nDear Peter,\n\nI startet to listen to Kiss when I was 6 Years old. I was allone at home and found Destroyer on Vinyl at my Brothers Room. Loved this Cover and my Fantasie was out of Control! 4 Heroes standing on Rocks and the Intro of Detroit Rock City was Mindblowing!!! I realy listen only to the A Side for 2 Years because I was afraid that the B Side maybee is not that good. As i tournd the Vinyl over the first Time I thout , Yes thats the Best Band ever! So I became a Crazy Fan who collect every Snipped!!!\n\nThe First motion Pictures of Kiss was on a VHS. It was Phantom of the Park and I was kind of desapointed because you Guys where Humans lol. 2 Years later I buyed a real bad over and over Copy of the Concerts at Tokio 76 and then I feeled the Power again! Well no good start to see Heroes in Motion at Phantom of the Parl because the Film is Bad as Hell hehehe.\n\nI didnt have that much Contact to People in my Age and no Friends so Kiss and specialy You and Ace became my imagin Friends and yes , kind of Familie. I allways listen to Kiss what ever i was doing and it was my erverything! On a Second Hand Store i was founding a Backpatch in the late 80s , first Time without Make up and I was shoked! I mean years and years as a Fan , you imagine what would the look without Makeup and then You see em and its not what You expect to see.I was born 74 and i was allways behind.When You live on a lost Place far from the City and you only got 3 Chanels on TV and Mom dont want You to read Musicpapers , you are far off.\n\nSo the Time without Makeup was allready but new to me.\n\nI took a While to Check that this Guys on the Backpatch wasnt You or Ace because You left Years ago.\n\nAs I found that out , i was crying soooo bad and my World was destroyed. It was inpossible to find Pictures of You Both without Makeup but as I found em in the City at a Musikstore on the Wall , I thout:Yes , thats Ace and Pete! My Brothers , my Familie. I was happy because you both looked like I allways imagine. With that , the old Love to Kiss came back and I found out that Eric Carr was a good Guy too! Realy sad that He died so young...\n\nThen later came the Unpugged Gig on MTV and again I was totaly in Tears because my Familie was back together. The best Moment in Live!!!\n\nI saw every Gig in Germany at the Reunion Tour. A Great Time!\n\nSadfully Gene and Paul have only Money in there Heads and You and Ace gone again.\n\nBut this Time i was happy because Time was right. I am still disapointed ofer Gene and Pauls Acting and I never listen to one of my Albums again since you Both left. Kiss died for me but You and Ace are still im my Heart and you Both will allways be because I love You Guys more than everything!\n\nKeep you Head up Pete , You are still my Heroe. Just wanted to tell you this little Story of a German Boy who was lonly till he found the best Record of all Times!\n\nSorry for my bad English.\n\nKeep on rocking!!!!\n\nLove , Robert\n\nPS: You Soloalbum was the Best of those 4 ;-)\n\n5/13/2017\n\nSubject: Drumming\n\nDear peter im a 46 year old fan and guitar player. I always loved your drumming you play with such melody and rhythm.alot of drummers just hit hard ,but you play with a lot of skill which Created that kiss sound.looking forward to seeing you at nyc kiss convention.\n\nYour friend Jeff.\n\nGod bless.\n\n5/12/2017\n\nSubject: Just a word\n\nMr. Criss,\n\nYour music with Kiss was a huge influence in my life, and I have always loved the musicianship of the band. I came to Christ back in 1988 and was on fire for a few years. I fell away from Christ and eventually found my way back again. I have always been a fan, and someone was telling me about another band who had their original drummer, Steve Smith, on tour with them again. I said that it should be that way, like KISS playing without Peter Criss. It just isn't KISS. So that got me to looking you up. I came across your webpage and was blown away that your heart has turned to Christ too. It warms my heart that you and I will finally meet. Be it here on Earth, or in our Father's land in Heaven. I truly want to say God Bless you sir. You are an inspiration to me, from the early days when I heard Beth for the first time, to now where you profess the love of Christ on your personal webpage. It is awesome what you are doing now.\n\nHave a wonderful day and I wish you all the success and love you can possibly receive.\n\nIn Christ,\n\nJoe W.\n\nI am a strong yet humble, compassionate and loving man of God, who walks side by side with his Lord.\n\n4/15/2017\n\nSubject: Fan letter\n\nDear Peter,\n\nMy name is Liz and I just wanted to say how impressed I am with your work and contributions to KISS. I find it amazing how you and Ace who almost died from alcohol and drugs, have found your faith in God. Also wanted to say how much I LOVE your book. God bless you and happy Easter.\n\nLiz\n\n4/14/2017\n\nSubject: Ryan\n\nHi peter my name is Ryan O.

I'm grateful to have had your music to get me through the tough times. I sincerely appreciate all you.\n\nThanks,\n\nJacob F\n\n4/4/2017\n\nSubject: Hi Peter...A greeting from Madrid - Spain..!!\n\nHi Peter,\n\nYou cannot imagine the emotion, pleasure and honor of being able to write to you and to show you my great respect & admiration as a person, a drummer and an artist ... in that order. I have been a drummer since I was a teenager, although today I have about half a century stepping the ground and more than 33 years beating and playing drums and cymbals (all listening Kiss and your works). You were one of the best inspirations as a drummer that I had in my youth (as well as Gene Krupa, Ian Page, Neil Peart, Louie Bellson Alan White, Eric Carr and many others) but you were very special for my musical training and study.\n\nI would love to have the pleasure and honor to meet you inviting you to come to Spain (Madrid) where I have been living for 20 years. Although I was born in Venezuela, I lived in Seattle and New York I finally reside in Europe.\n\nI know that you can remember have been coming to Spain on other occasions, however, my invitation is for you: a special person I´d always admired and I know that you would like to take advantage of your quiet time with Gigi, to know just a little more serenely about other lands without the bother or intervention of the paparazzi press or importunate press ... rather a time to relax and enjoy the Mediterranean diet.. ha ha\n\nIf you fancy, take it as a Anniversary supplement or suggestion for you and Gigi. Both deserve it.\n\nWell Peter, it's a real pleasure for me to send you my sincere words, I hope it do not falls on a broken bag, maybe because of lot of emails you receive, I have a hope of get meet you and my little boy have a strong desire to get to know you too.\n\nGod bless you.\n\nSincerely\n\nAntonio T\n\n3/28/2017\n\nSubject: Peter\n\nPeter you are an outstanding drummer, KISS would not be what they are without you... The four of you are my rock & roll heros... I have gone to the concerts since 1976, no band could touch the original four. Rock on brother !!!\n\nAndrew E.\n\n3/15/2017\n\nSubject: Best drummer on KISS\n\nbonjour , i never forget you the catman. french Fan\n\nFranck J.\n\n3/11/2017\n\nSubject: Not the same\n\nHey, Pete.\n\nHope all is well with you. I was looking up old KISS footage on YouTube and came across some old concerts from the Destroyer era. Man, that stuff is gold. I really miss you and Ace. Without you 2, KISS is a quasi tribute band at best. My opinion is if the current line up wants to continue, then Tommy and Eric need to come up with their own alter egos or just take off the makeup. It ain't the same and never will be. Thank you for a ton of great music and being the ONLY Catman that matters.\n\nGod Bless!\n\nMike\n\n3/7/2017\n\nSubject: Welcome Home\n\nAs a young girl growing up in a Catholic household in Detroit, your music was everywhere, except in our home. My mother saw your band as an instrument of Satan that lead people away from Christ (she had good reason to hate rock - my brother was a talented musician, singer, songwriter who played rock music, got addicted to drugs and eventually it killed him). At 13 I saw your band as music to sneak and play. Over the years I have enjoyed watching the videos and reminiscing over my rock conversations with my now deceased brother - he loved Detroit Rock City, and sang a beautiful rendition of Beth - and he had played with Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop, and other Detroit rockers in the 60's and early 70's. He was my own rock history course. I could listen to my brother Donnie sing forever. His poetry was beautiful. He was a storyteller - like you.\n\nI w"
