        "text": "Hey everybody. Peter Zeihan here coming to you from the winter wonderland that is Colorado after a snow storm. It is the 8th of January. And the news today is that the Indian navy has successfully engaged in a counter pirate operation and freed a vessel with a majority Indian crew from pirates off the coast of Somalia. This is nearly at the outer reach of what the Indians can reach, which the rebel forces and counter-piracy operations are always lots of no fun for everyone.\n\nAnd so this is a pretty important tactical victory. And I think it underlines the role that I see India playing in the region in the future. Now, India is not like any other country in the world. It’s certainly not like the United States. They have a very nationalist view of trade and they don’t like to integrate with anyone.\n\nAnd they are an ideology vehicle, opposition to globalization because it was American led and during the Cold War, the Indians tended to be more pro-Soviet to the point that even when the Soviet Union wasn’t around anymore, the Indians tended to be fairly pro-Soviet. But we’ve seen this weakening in that position over the course of the Ukraine were not because they’re having a change of heart, but because they’re realizing that all of the billions of dollars that they spent on developing joint weapons systems with the Russians was basically stolen.\n\nAnd they’re never going to get any of it. So the Indians, from a national security point of view, are increasingly going their own way. That may include some deals here and there with the United States, but those will be tactical, not strategic. And it’s going to be a very l’écart experience, as opposed to, say, the American relationship with Japan or with Australia or even with Saudi Arabia.\n\nIndia is going to do its own things for its own ways. Also, India doesn’t really like anyone and there aren’t a lot of countries out there that like India, so they won’t be partnering with anyone else in economic matters for manufacturing. They’re going have to do more or less the same thing that the U.S. is going to have to do as the Chinese system breaks down.\n\nAnd that means doubling the size of their industrial plant. But they’re not going to have a joint manufacturing system with Bangladesh or with Pakistan or Sri Lanka or with Iran or with Myanmar. And those are all the countries that the border. So India’s industrial plant is going to expand massively, but it’s all going to be in India. That will affect quality issues, of course.\n\nBut, you know, India is a market with 1.5 billion people. I think they’re going to deal with that just fine. What that does mean, however, is their threshold for military action is going to be very, very low compared to a lot of other countries because they’re not integrated with anyone. They’re also the first major stop for oil going out of the Persian Gulf to East Asia, which is where it almost all goes.\n\nAnd now the Indians have conclusively demonstrated that they’re capable of doing anti pirate operations. Well, not to put too fine a point on it, but if you’re good at anti pirate operations, you’re also, by default, very good at pirate operations. So now that the Indians are not beholden anyone, and now that we are seeing a breakdown in the Chinese system, we’re going to see the Indians taking that de facto control, the de facto management of any trade that happens to come through the Indian Ocean Basin, and that includes the world’s largest oil transport route.\n\nSo the issue for everyone else in the area is whether or not you can find a way of dealing with the Indians. And to be perfectly blunt, the best way to do that is cold, hard cash, because the Indians are otherwise more or less going to be self-sufficient in the world that we’re going to, and no one can reach them.\n\nThey’re literally a continent away from all the other potential players. And as for the United States, if we have an India that is a little bit that’s the best word, persnickety in its own region, that’s fine, because there aren’t a lot of U.S. interests that pass through that region in a post China scenario. So this is just where we’re headed.\n\nAnd the Indians very clearly are a step ahead of everyone else.\n\nHey, everybody. Peter Zeihan here. Coming to you from my bed because I’ve thrown out my back and I’m going to be here for a couple of days. The news aside from that is that there’s a lot afoot in relations between Canada, the United States and India. Recently, the United States has issued an indictment of a number of folks in India, many with ties to the government for an assassination program in North America, which, according to the Americans, has killed at least one Canadian citizen and targeted unsuccessfully someone with dual American Canadian citizenship.\n\nBoth these people are ethnic Indians, and as the indictment goes, there are factions within the Indian government who have used state resources to set up a murder program in North America and take out folks that they say are supporting separatism in India. Now, the reality of the situation on the ground in India is that separatism peaked probably back in the 1980s.\n\nNot that it wasn’t serious then, it was, but now it’s really been talking about in any sort of meaningful way in the last 20 years, unless you happen to be an ultra nationalist and the BJP, which is the ruling party in India and is pretty much a shoo in at this point for reelection next year, has a severely ultranationalist faction.\n\nAnd that means we got to pick this parliament. Okay. First of all, a lot of the negative stereotypes about India when it comes to things like government inefficiency are true. A lot of societies think of government as a cash cow where you get jobs, you don’t necessarily have to do anything. And there’s going to be some truth to that in any society.\n\nBut in India, it’s particularly robust because we do have the world’s largest administration and oftentimes it’s considered a minor miracle. If anything gets done, because there are so many clashing authorities, not just between the local, the state and the national government, but within the different bureaus of the national government. And the government is absolutely treated as a cash cow for whoever the ruling party or parties happen to be.\n\nAnd in that sense, the BJP is no exception. But what that means is, as a rule, getting anything done within the Indian government, especially when it involves foreign security policy, is next to impossible because the institutions are just so lethargic and overpopulated and under supported. What that means is whoever did this, it’s entirely possible that it was done without the knowledge of the BJP leadership in general, the Prime Minister in particular, Modi.\n\nThe Prime Minister is certainly a nationalist in himself, but he’s not like advocating going out and killing someone else’s citizens on a different continent. But it’s perfectly reasonable to expect that there’s a faction of the BJP who is ultra nationalist, who has used their links to the state now to launch something like this independent of the federal government.\n\nWhen Justin Trudeau first announced almost in passing that a Canadian citizen had been killed by Indian agents, you know, it sparked a bit of an uproar. But then the Canadians started releasing details about the people who did it and to be perfectly born, a lot of them were kind of chubby. And, you know, the world of international espionage is many things, but it doesn’t spend a lot of time at the buffet at Caesar’s Palace.\n\nThese are folks that have to be really pretty much geared up and goers and Trump are not known for being particularly agile assassins. So, you know, they got caught both in Canada and in the United States in particular. And now the question is, what is this going to mean for relations? Now, if this theory is correct, that this was just kind of a rogue faction within the political sphere as opposed to actual professional intelligence agents?\n\nThen someone’s head can be put on a platter. When it was just Canada and maybe some countries quietly back in Canada, that was one thing. But when they moved into the United States and attempted to kill someone. my. Even at the height of the Cold War, the Soviets would have never even dreamed of that. Even with relations as bad as they have become with the Chinese, the Chinese would never even think about going after an American citizen in America.\n\nBut apparently there was someone in India. They thought they were exempt. And, you know, that’s a hard pause. Yes, you can suck up a lot in great power politics when it comes to the treatment of your allies. But if someone’s coming after your citizens, that’s a very different sort of picture and that generates broad spectrum retaliation. And if this is a proto ally like India may be to the United States, that pretty much sinks all statesmanship options between the two countries right there.\n\nSo I would guess, especially if this theory is correct, is over the course of the next few weeks, tensions are going to cool. The Canadians are already being fairly smug about saying that they’ve already cooled quite a bit and that the United States is directly involved. Canadians love to be smug and eventually someone will be. Carl pulled to the carpet, maybe not publicly, but in the eyes of the governments in the United States and Canada, we know that this is something that has drawn attention from the very top because the White House in the United States has now leaked that Joe Biden actually talked to Prime Minister Modi about it at the last big summit.\n\nI think it was the G20 summit. So this is now a top tier issue. And if Modi is serious about wanting to have a partnership with the United States in order to get better defense equipment because they know no Russian equipment sucks or to have a friend against the Chinese should anything break down there. Well, you know, you don’t go to your potential allies homeland and start killing people.\n\nI’m sorry. That’s just that’s just rude. So this is probably not going to exactly get swept up under the rug. We will prob ably have someone who has to pay and there will probably be an extradition before all is said and done. But that doesn’t mean that it has to be loud unless of course they try to kill someone else, in which case all bets are off.\n\nHey everybody. Peter Zeihan here coming to you from Colorado today. We’re going to talk about something that you guys have been writing in for weeks about what is up with the Indians and the Canadians yelling at one another over this assassination plot. For those of you who are unaware, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, accused, who actually kind of mentioned it in passing in a parliamentary testimony that the Indian government had assassinated a Sikh emigre on Canadian soil.\n\nThe guy had Canadian citizenship. He had renounced his Indian citizenship. But the Indians have never liked this guy because he supports one of the separatist groups in India. It wasn’t a group that was part. I mean, this issue has basically been resolved in India’s favor. But he didn’t stop talking about it while he was abroad. And so as the accusation goes, the Indians wanted him dead and did it.\n\nThis has a number of implications. It took me so long just to kind of get to the bottom of it, because it involves intel that hasn’t been made public for the most part. But let’s say five things. Number one, looks like it was true. The intelligence didn’t come from Canada. It came from the United States and the Five Eyes system.\n\nFive Eyes is a group of five Anglo countries Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States that share intelligence on almost everything. Anyway, the intelligence originated from the United States because that’s going to sound weird. Or maybe not. The United States has much better intelligence capabilities in Canada than the Canadian government does. So yeah. And then it was verified by the British government.\n\nAnd the Brits have much better information gathering in India than the Canadians do. So all of the five eyes have basically kind of quietly said Canada was right on this one. That makes things a little bit complicated because, two, we have never seen the Indian government assassinate anyone outside of arm’s reach of their own borders. This is a fundamentally new capacity for them.\n\nNow, assassinations are a little bit coming into vogue. The Russians have obviously picked up the pace for that considerably, even before the Ukraine war with radiation and poisoning and polonium being their preferred methods, although they’re not afraid of a gunshot to the head. And if you ever see somebody jumping out of a hospital window, that was only an assassination.\n\nThese kind of Russian culture are the Americans, of course, are are fans of it, too, as long as it’s done by a drone where we really frowned upon it when it’s done in person for some reason probably left over from the Cold War issues. And then, of course, the Brits are good at it anyway. Seeing this with India is significant because the Indian diaspora is arguably the largest on the planet, and if the Indian government starts patrolling it using extraterritorial and extralegal means that is going to rub a lot of people wrong in a lot of places, and eventually it’ll probably end up offing someone that actually matters to a government and not just because\n\nit’s a citizen. So this is not yet a really big deal, but it has the potential to become a very big deal in the not too distant future. Number three, Canada is among the largest destinations for Indian students traveling abroad, and the Indian diaspora in Canada has become its fastest growing ethnic group. Now, obviously, the people who leave a country are not Brazil patriots.\n\nSo expect to see a lot more agitation within Canada as a result of this, as opposed to quieting down. If the Indian goal was to quell discussion of these topics, they probably just achieved the opposite because Canada, for all, for its faults, is a free country with a more or less free press, even if it is a little bit slanted, in my opinion.\n\nAnd it’s very easy for anyone to say anything about anyone, anywhere. And because of freedom of information and the ability to send electrons around the world in a second, that will generate actually a lot more publicity in India as well. So this probably wasn’t the smartest play by New Delhi if their goal was to keep this very, very quiet.\n\nOkay. More significantly, number four, relations with India. You know, by the five eyes putting their stamp of approval on the Canadian statement, that obviously raises the question about what relations between the Brits, the Australians and the Americans are going to be with the Indians. The Americans and the Australians are in the quad grouping with India, which is a kind of a security talk shop.\n\nAnd the Brits obviously have ongoing relations and economic and otherwise with everyone who’s in the Commonwealth in their former colonies. So if you’ve got a major power, India starting to do things that are incredibly unsavory from the point of view of democratic norms, that is absolutely going to impact relations. The question is how much? The issue for the Americans and the Australians, of course, is China trying to try to try to China.\n\nAnd honestly, I don’t think in this relationship we’re going to see too much of a change. Which brings us to the fifth issue, which is the nature of great power politics. When you have identified a country that you see as a large threat, a lot of the niceties that dominate the normal diplomatic and economic discourse fall by the wayside side in favor of hard security concerns.\n\nAnd that means you are willing to partner with different sorts of countries and personalities that you normally wouldn’t even consider. So, for example, when Hitler was on the scene, we were best buds with Stalin, sent him billions in today’s terms, tens of billions of dollars of military aid in order to fight off the Nazis. Then when Hitler fell, we got into bed with Mao, who was the greatest mass murderer in history, in order to counter Stalin.\n\nSo the idea that we would partner with a mostly democratic but little bit unsavory India in order to counter what has become the most totalitarian government in the world. That’s an easy decision to make, but it does mean that the nature of the American and to a lesser degree British and Australian relationship with the Indians is going to change.\n\nWe never considered Stalin or Mao or French. They were allies against a very specific threat. And when that threat was neutralized, the relationship changed again. Now, there are a lot of decisions that Indians are going to have to make in the next several years as actions against the Chinese heat up. And the question will be whether or not they want a more productive relationship with these Western nations.\n\nThere’s a lot of water under that bridge. The answer may very well be no, but that means India will be doing Indian things with Indian policy for Indian interests. And to be perfectly honest, looking back on the last 70 years, that’s not much of a change. India unofficially sided with the Soviets in the Cold War, but they were very big on non-alignment for the most part carried it out.\n\nWhat we’re seeing today is just kind of the slightly greater power equivalent of that same sort of political ideology. Now, sitting here in the United States, it’s easy for me to wag my finger and say that this is not the best thing for India or Indians, but I don’t get a vote in this. This is a decision to be made in New Delhi specifically, and to be perfectly blunt, in a world where lots and lots of countries are aligned against the Chinese and in my opinion, the Chinese are long for this world.\n\nIndia is going to do very well regardless of what the relationship with the West happens to look like. This is their decision. Doesn’t mean we have to like it.\n\nHey everyone, Peter Zeihan here. Today we’re going to talk about the BRICS summit. It was originally intended to be a two parter, one during the summit and one after. But because programing got shot down yesterday. We’re combining this into one. So it seems to a little bit disappointed. That is why. And here we go. Hey, everybody. Peterson coming to you from the shore of Lake, where I have been visited by a whole bunch of goats.\n\nThey were very curious anyway. Today we’re going to talk about something that is in progress. And that’s the BRICS summit in South Africa. They’re trying to come up with a series of plans of what to do. They’re trying to consider whether they should let in new members. And odds are that this is just going to be a really stupid summit that’s going to amount to nothing.\n\nBut it’s still worth talking about because it’ll give you an idea of the architecture of the international system. And you never know. They might be able to pull something out of the fire. So the reason I have primarily been dismissive of the BRICS since the beginning is because it was never an organization. It was never a grouping that was founded by its members.\n\nIt was some finance guy who’s like, Look, we’ve got all this capital because the baby boomers haven’t retired yet. We should put it into bonds. And we’re some big bond markets. Oh, yeah, Brazil, Russia, India and China. That’s it. That’s all it was. And then taken to later, they led in South Africa in a in a fit of pique.\n\nNothing’s going on here. There’s never been any meaningful deal. They have formed a development bank, but now over 90% of the capital comes from China. And there are reasons for the BRICS to talk with China. It is a significant trading partner, but there’s no reason for them to speak with one another. Brazil, aside from exports to China, doesn’t trade with the rest of them at all.\n\nSame with South Africa, same with Russia. India is a special case, and if there’s one country that doesn’t like China, that would be India. And, you know, every once in a while you’ll hear them talking about forming a global currency or a new alternative currency to challenge the dollar. And then they start talking about details and all falls apart.\n\nSo right now, India, China, South Africa and the BRICS own bank are on record saying that they’re not interested in a global currency. The only two countries are left are Russia, who thinks that everyone should use the ruble, of course, and Brazil. How can I qualify? Describe Brazilian foreign policies these days, especially on economic issues, kind of. Lodhi DA.\n\nNot a lot of substance beneath rhetoric anyway. So the purpose of this summit is to bring in dozens of leaders from other countries and see if they can kind find something that they can all agree on. A history suggests the answer will be no and everyone is coming with their own list of grievances and desires. The Russians want everyone to sign up with them and boycott the West until the West agrees to give them their way on Ukraine.\n\nOf course, Russia’s not included in that. Russia is still allowed to talk. The first is still how to to trade with whoever they want. The Chinese are hoping to get enough countries on board that they can then walk into Washington and demand trade concessions. They don’t care about all the other countries. They just want them for themselves. The Indians are there because they are more of a classic nine nonaligned power.\n\nBut as the Chinese become more rambunctious, the Indians have become more and more edging towards being in the American camp. So the normal rhetoric that you would expect to see out of the Indians just isn’t there. The South Africans who are hosting are pretending to be neutral in all this and say they don’t have an opinion. The Brazilians are very logical and that’s it.\n\nWe’re going to turn around here anyway. Why might this one spark? Why might this still matter? Well, if you look back to the Cold War period when we had the nonaligned movement, that’s what a lot of these countries are from. Not Russia, not China, but a lot of the ones who are now showing out, they saw themselves as not east, not west, not first or Second World, but is something else.\n\nAnd they try to come together for a common thing called the new international economic order. And the idea was that the West should restructure their trade practices in order to benefit some of their former colonies. It didn’t amount to much at the time. Eventually it became known as the ACP group Africa, Caribbean Pacific, a former colonies of the Europeans who have a degree of preferential trade access when it comes to European markets.\n\nBut it never got the restructuring that they really wanted. The reason I’m even less optimistic this time around is because the interests of the groups that are showing up are far more diverse than anything that we had in the early post-colonial era back in the sixties and seventies. So if they do decide, if BRICS does decide to do something, it will probably be about expanding their membership.\n\nAnd that would be one of the most effective ways that I can think of to make sure that BRICS never achieves anything at all because they don’t agree on any much right now. So this is going to be an unofficial two parter. We’re going to wait to see what comes out of the summit. And then I will let you know what I think about the new roster.\n\nAll right. That’s it. Bye. Okay, here’s part two. So BRICS did decide they wanted to expand to involve six members in the six countries they involved. Indicate to me that BRICS has no plans of doing anything useful in the future. Those countries in no particular order are Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ethiopia and Argentina. And I mean, honestly, folks, this is hilarious.\n\nOkay, so let’s start with what the naysayers are going to say about how this does matter and explain why it doesn’t. They’re saying that because of the addition of the three countries in the Persian Gulf region plus Egypt, that this grouping, BRICS, now produces about half to 60% of global oil. And that means the downfall of the dollar, the formation of an alternate currency, the end of the petrodollar, divestment, the United States.\n\nAnd it’s the end of an era. And, you know, the short version is absolute bullshit. Number one, Saudi Arabia does sell a few loads to China in yuan, and Russia does sell a few loads in yuan or rupees in order to get around sanctions. But the Russian system is kind of by itself. And as Russia follows no one, as with the Saudi Arabians and the Emiratis, that might be a little different.\n\nWell, you got to look at why they’re considering doing anything in non-US dollars. They’re looking for a security guarantor. They’re afraid that the United States is going to leave the region. And if it does, they’re on their own. And since they don’t like to be outside of air conditioning, national defense is something they’re not very good at. So they’re basically open to all potential takers when it comes to not oil sales for sales sake, but as a way of getting into your security planning.\n\nThe Saudis have gone with the U.S. dollar for the last several decades, not because it was the global currency, not because they’re part of a caucus group that is basically with the BRICS. And they’re not in any sort of meaningful organization in which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia members, they have a bilateral relationship that was based on security, and that was the reason why they use the U.S. dollar.\n\nThat’s the reason why they bought refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast, because they saw the United States as the country that ultimately would bleed and die for them. And they’re looking for alternatives, not because they want an alternative, but because the U.S. is probably not interested in that role anymore. There are also right now trilateral negotiations going on among the Americans, the Saudis and the Israelis, in which the Saudis are seeking a Japan style security guarantee for themselves.\n\nNow, they’re probably not going to get that. They’re probably going to get a lot of things that they’re after. But the bottom line is that for the Saudis, this has never been about the money. It’s never been about the currency. It’s about who’s going to take a bullet for them. And the Chinese simply lack the capacity to deploy at range in a way that the Saudis would be willing to accept and believe, especially since the primary foe that they’re worried about is none other than Iran, which is how it has been, added the BRICS as well.\n\nThat brings us kind of the second problem here. The the BRICS have realized that if you’re going to add a country like Iran, that is how should I say, has some firm opinions about security issues, for example, that it should be in charge of the Middle East. Well, then you have to add anyone else from that region at the same time.\n\nOtherwise, you can never have any of them because the Iranians would do the vetoing. So that’s adding the UAE, Saudi and Iran at the same time. It guarantees that you can expand the organization in the future, but it also guarantees that on all significant issues, you now have members inside the organization that going to be in diametrically opposed positions forever.\n\nSo we already know that BRICS can’t have a meaningful energy policy because now you have a number of opposed powers Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabian, UAE, all in at the same time. What a shit show. Okay, next up, Argentina and Ethiopia. Ethiopia brings very little the table. It’s one of the ten poorest countries between per capita terms in the world.\n\nIt’s landlocked. It’s one of the handful of countries in the world that is not part of China’s one belt, one road, because even the Chinese like there’s no investment case there. So they added in in order to get a little bit of African flair into the organization. And that’s about it. Argentina is not poor. It has a entitlement complex in which it thinks that everyone should give it money and should never have to give any of the money back.\n\nAnd the reason they applied for BRIC membership is they’re hoping to get Chinese money. It’s not that the Argentineans are anti-U.S. dollar in any meaningful way. It’s just they’re anti paying back their debts. And so they’re always looking for a new financial access point in order to leech off of it until it goes away as well. So honestly, you know, best of luck with those two because there definitely a drain on the organization and they really don’t bring much to the table.\n\nOkay. Who am I looking to? Oh, yeah, Egypt. Egypt is basically a U.S. satellite state. The U.S. basically pays Egypt and Israel and Jordan, for that matter, to not go to war with one another. So thinking that there’s a security play here from bringing the Egyptians in. No. If anything, it’s a bit of a Trojan horse. It is a large developing country.\n\nI would argue that the reason it got brought in is because of India, which still has a lingering love of the nonaligned movement in which Egypt was a reasonably potent player politically but economically. Strategically, I’m afraid not. All right. Is that everybody? Yeah, that’s everybody. When an organization expands, usually one of two things happens. Either one, you’ve got an overwhelmingly powerful single member that kind of decides how things go.\n\nAnd that would be the United States and NATO’s, for example. Option number two is you expand it with each member, you bring in differing viewpoints, and eventually it paralyzes the organization from doing really much of anything. And the BRICS is definitely firmly in that category right now. This is really only going to amount to anything in the midterm now if one of two things happens.\n\nNumber one, the Chinese pay for everything, and that means subsidizing the existence of the Argentineans, as they believe they should be subsidized, which is a hefty price. And very, very poor countries like Ethiopia. The last time a major power tried to do this, it was the Soviet Union. It was the 1970s, and it broke the bank. So not very likely that the Chinese are going to pay for influence in places that they actually can’t control and don’t really bring them much if they did.\n\nThe second option is we could see this very, very rapidly expand to basically become the new nonaligned movement. Of course, it would be different this time because the Chinese very clearly have elements in mind and the Russians very clearly have some goals in mind. And it’s difficult to imagine a lot of the world’s middle and lesser powers following the lead of these two countries.\n\nI mean, yes, a lot of the global south has not been interested in condemning the Russians for what’s going on in Ukraine. That doesn’t mean they want to follow them. And anyone who’s not blind realizes the Chinese has some very clear, very nationalist, very, almost hateful, domineering goals for the Chinese rise. And in that sort of environment, no one wants to be a pawn because all of a sudden the nonaligned movement is going to align with a global pull.\n\nNo. So where does that leave us? Well, I think if you look at what really went down at the summit, you get your answer. Chinese President Xi Jinping didn’t even show up to some of the opening ceremonies where he was expected to give a pole speeches. The Chinese don’t see this as a useful vehicle, except rhetorically, and that means you shouldn’t treat it as anything else.\n\nAll right. That’s it for me by."
