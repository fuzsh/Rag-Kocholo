I occasionally earn a commission (at no additional cost to you) when you click through an affiliate link to one of my favorite products. Thank you for your support. Read More\n\nAs a raw feeder, I'm surprised when I connect with pro-raw local veterinarians. I'm lucky to live in a progressive area where people love their dogs – I'm not the only Crazy Dog Lady. Despite my pro-raw stance, I understand entirely why veterinarians have concerns about raw feeding. If the only time they see dogs is when they're sick due to an imbalanced raw diet, they have a broken tooth or perforated bowel due to raw bones, or another ailment – then it makes sense that they're not fans of raw feeding.\n\nSo I contacted the veterinarian community to ask them to share their concerns about raw feeding.\n\nCreating a Balanced Raw Diet for Dogs\n\nAccording to Dr. Judy Morgan, DVM, CVA, CVCP, CVFT, and Author of several books, many dog owners mistakenly believe that “raw feeding” is “buying a pack of hamburger in the grocery store and throwing it in the bowl.” A lot more goes into creating a balanced diet than feeding ground beef.\n\nRATIO OF RAW FOOD INGREDIENTS: The raw food diet I feed my dogs consists of…\n\n80% muscle meat (alternated weekly)\n\n10% raw meaty bones\n\n10% offal (organ meat), 1/2 is liver\n\nParadigm base mix by Dr. Harvey's\n\nThis is a ratio that I developed over time and has been approved by my vet. I don't achieve this ratio in every meal; it's something that I strive for over time as I feed my dogs.\n\n“It takes research and quality control to ensure that a diet is formulated with the appropriate vitamins and nutrients for our furry loved ones; many small-brand raw food companies don't have the resources to conduct the appropriate research or quality control to ensure they are putting out a safe and appropriate product.” Source: Chelsea McGivney, DVM\n\nI spent months researching raw before switching our dogs to a reputable, local premade raw brand. I continued to study, and although I know much more than I did three years ago, I'm always learning new things about feeding our dogs.\n\nQuestionable Meat Sources\n\nMany people new to raw feeding (myself included) don't understand how important it is to know where you're sourcing your meat. I've been told that chicken is a meat that is high in bacteria, which might explain why Rodrigo and Scout (to a lesser extent) have trouble with it given their sensitive digestive systems. It also seems like most of the raw food recalls are chicken products, but I probably notice these recalls more because I'm biased toward chicken.\n\nI buy our raw food through a local raw food co-op. I trust all of the sourcing, but that may not be enough. We have to learn how to ask the right questions, and understand the dance disreputable raw brands do to avoid disclosing that they're selling 4D meats (diseased, disabled, dying, or dead).\n\n“One of my really good clients got campylobacter [food poisoning] and she is a clean freak. But her meat source was sketchy.” Source: Dr. Judy Morgan\n\nI've been told repeatedly that a dog's digestive system is built to handle bacteria that humans cannot. I believe this to be true. However, I need to practice safe meat handling when preparing raw meals and when cooking meat for our meals – washing hands, dishes, tools, and countertops thoroughly. J and I don't have compromised immune systems, but that doesn't mean that we're safe from contracting an illness due to bacteria found in raw meat.\n\nNot Feeding Raw Bones Safely\n\nOur dogs only eat raw meaty bones (duck necks, turkey necks, lamb necks) and recreational bones (beef knee caps and beef knuckle bones) under supervision. They each have their “spot” in the yard, and I sit on the steps to our deck to watch over my dogs. This has taught me which bones our dogs can't eat, and I have a good sense of how long it takes each of them to chew and gnaw their bone to the point where I need to take it away and avoid a choking hazard.\n\nIt's important to know “which bones to feed to which dogs and monitoring properly so dogs don't choke. Knowing how much bone to feed so dogs don't get constipated or obstructed.” Source: Dr. Judy Morgan.\n\nNot Doing Your Homework on Proper Raw Feeding\n\nDr. Chelsea McGivney shared a point that resulted in me yelling “YES YES YES!!!”\n\n“There is a lot of it [information] out there on the internet! Best bet is to get the information straight from your veterinarian if you have questions regarding raw food diets.” Source: Dr. Chelsea McGiveney\n\nI'm lucky because I work with pro raw veterinarians, and several more are in our area. I live in a local and online community where I have many resources and a lot of support, and my questions rarely go unanswered. Not everyone has the support of their veterinarian or community, which blows.\n\nI think it's important that we're honest with our veterinarians about how we feed our dogs because this can play a lot into diagnosis and treatment. Keep reading for how I've managed to get veterinarians on my side when it comes to raw feeding.\n\nFor those of you who are looking for a supportive raw feeding community, here are a few resources to get you started:\n\nRaw Feeding from A to Z – I initially wrote a book in 2017, this is the 2023 update.\n\nJoin a raw feeding group on Facebook; I recommend Raw Feeding 101. This is a friendly group and the moderators do a great job of keeping the drama to a minimum. In fact, I haven't witnessed drama in this group for years. Scott Jay Marshall, the founder of Raw Feeding 101, also offers courses, coaching, and a bootcamp.\n\nFind a raw feeding co-op in your area. The one I belong to is amazing and it's introduced me to a great community of local raw feeders.\n\nCheck out my RESOURCES PAGE, which includes a list of people I follow who offer trusted information. I update the list regularly as I discover new resources.\n\nNot Tracking Your Dog's Health Issues and Symptoms\n\nThis has got to be my favorite because it's something that many people new to raw don't do, including myself. I followed Rodrigo's changes because many were so drastic and immediate, but as time passed, I became lax. I was caught off guard when his digestive issues erupted in Fall 2014 and found myself scrambling for a resolution.\n\nChristina Chambreau, DVM, Homeopathic veterinarian, author, and educator, reminds us that many health issues “resolve when you are doing the best diet for that pet (vomiting hairballs, eating stool, eye “goop”, shedding, doggy odor, and many more)” and as you experiment with different foods, more of these early warning signs will resolve.\n\nAs I've learned, the trick is to keep a chart of what you're feeding your dog so that you can quickly track what is causing the changes. Had I done this, I would have seen that chicken, turkey, and beef were a problem for Rodrigo earlier. Today, I use a calendar to track all of my dogs – what they're eating, weekly weight, lumps, and bumps I find, and other health or behavioral changes. This makes discussions with our vet a lot more fruitful.\n\nNot only can tracking your dog's health changes help as you transition to raw feeding, but it also keeps you from freaking out when something goes wrong. I agree with Dr. Chambreau's statement that we must keep moving forward.\n\n“Persist, work with an integrative veterinarian, read more, go to some of the seminars and chat room on fresh food feeding. Persist – it is just not ok to feed processed any more than you think it is ok for you to eat the same can of stew (organic or not) every meal, every day, every month, for the rest of your life. ” Source: Christina Chambreau, DVM\n\nNot Trusting Your Vet\n\nThis is a big one for me. There is no way on this planet or any other that our first veterinarian would have been okay with feeding raw. He could barely tolerate mixed breed and rescue dogs and hated when I asked questions. The mention of Google would turn this man's face an unattractive shade of “get out of my office, you heretic!!!”\n\n“If you do decide to choose a raw diet for your pet, I encourage you to do your research and discuss it with your Veterinarian. We have your pet’s health and longevity in mind. We will help you to make the right choice for you and your pet.” Source: Dr. Heather McGowan\n\nSo, I understand not trusting your vet. Our first vet used antibiotics to treat everything, and after I switched to raw, I began to understand why this was only making my dog sicker. Antibiotics screw up our dogs' gut microbiome, and repeated prescription of antibiotics was a disaster for my dog. And it took me years to fix my dog's gut. If I hadn't met other veterinarians who were more open to collaborating with pet parents on their dog's health, I wouldn't have a high opinion of the profession.\n\nBut I did meet those professionals.\n\nNot Feeding Enough Variety\n\n“People feed a variety – if purchasing commercial raw – change companies every week or two. Best is to integrate with the healthy food you are eating yourself, so each day has different meats, vegetables, supplements, eggs, dairy, etc.” Source: Christina Chambreau, DVM\n\nThis is another mistake I see many new raw feeders making. Chicken is the cheapest and most easily accessible protein so when I first started making our dogs' raw meals, you'd find me filling up a cart with the family packages of chicken thighs.\n\nTurns out none of my dogs can eat chicken. Go figure.\n\nToday, our dogs get a new protein weekly. This week, they're eating a rabbit and turkey mix with a base mix. Yum.\n\nGetting Veterinarians to Support Raw Feeding\n\nIn my research for this article, I found that many of the concerns veterinarians have are reasonable. I can understand why some veterinarians discourage raw feeding and home-cooked diets. From personal experience, I can attest to how complicated feeding raw can be for some dog owners. As raw feeders, we're concerned about meeting our dogs' nutritional needs while keeping our budget under control. As time goes on, it gets easier, but it wasn't a cakewalk for me.\n\nSo I get it. I will continue to feed our dogs a raw food diet, but I won't be so hard on veterinarians when they express their reservations about the diet. Instead, I try to alleviate their concerns.\n\nI've managed to get every veterinarian that has seen my dogs (except the first) to get on board with raw feeding by doing two things…\n\nAsking about their concerns.\n\nSharing how I address each of those concerns.\n\nHow I Create a Balanced Raw Diet for My Dogs: I use a base mix to cover any nutrients my 80/10/10 diet doesn't cover. I have my dogs nutrient tested every other year to confirm their diet is meets their nutritional needs. The test is reviewed by a veterinarian with over 25 years of experience in medicine and animal nutrition, including raw feeding.\n\nSourcing of Ingredients/Meat: I'm lucky to live in a rural area with access to grass-fed proteins. I have great sourcing among our local raw food co-op, local farms and homesteaders, and reputable local raw food brands.\n\nFeeding Raw Bones: when I feed raw bones to my dogs, I always supervise to ensure everyone is safe. Over the years, I've learned which bones are a good fit for my dogs and which are not. My dogs primarily enjoy air-dried chews from Real Dog Box, and I grind quail, duck, and rabbit meat and bones when doing meal prep.\n\nEducating Myself About Dog Nutrition: I've learned that raw feeding is a marathon and not a sprint, which means that I'm always looking for new information and revisiting old information. Every dog is unique and I never know where I'll find information that is a great fit for one or all of my dogs. So, I'm always reading and always learning.\n\nTracking Health Issues: I maintain a journal for my dogs. It's a simple journal with blank pages. I conduct weekly home exams – yeah, this sounds like a lot, but I have a dog living with cancer and a geriatric dog, so it's just right for me. I note diet changes, stool changes, any lumps/bumps I find, or any other changes in my dogs' behavior or health.\n\nNot Listening to My Veterinarian: So, there are going to be times when I don't listen to the veterinarian, and it's not because I know more about animal health, it's because I know more about my dogs. So when I was told to take Scout off of raw when he was diagnosed with canine lymphoma, I ignored that suggestion and kept him on raw because I knew he'd be fine – and he was. I will be upfront with my veterinarian when I plan to ignore their suggestions.\n\nFeeding Variety: I believe in balance over time and change the main protein in my dogs' diet weekly. I'm able to alternate between several proteins while keeping my budget from going insane. I try to focus on grass-fed and organic proteins when they're available. I know that, for some, it's easier to stick with a single protein, and in the beginning, I did just that – but once I got a handle on the DIY, I began incorporating more variety.\n\nBe the Change You Want to See\n\nThere are always going to be veterinarians who have a firm stance against raw feeding, raw feeders, and raw fed dogs, but there are many more who are open to new information, especially if it's extending the lives of pets. Because, remember, they got into this business because they love animals too. By being open about my beliefs and addressing their concerns, I've been able to change the mind of several veterinarians.\n\nWhen I shared this article on social media, I was stunned by the number of anti-veterinarian comments. People are having terrible experiences with veterinarians and this is ultimately going to harm our pets. I know firsthand how frustrating it can be to have a veterinarian who won't listen, however, I've also learned to set aside my personal feelings and put my dogs first in these situations. If a veterinarian is willing to share their concerns and listen to how I address them, then I need to have that discussion. Not only will this benefit my dogs, but it'll also help the dogs that come after us – new raw feeders who will now have a better experience with the vet.\n\nIf we want to see more veterinarians embrace raw feeding and home-cooked diets for pets, they need to be inspired by witnessing our success stories.\n\nRead More About Raw Feeding"
