        "text": "On 19 March 1919 Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes announced a competition for the first Australian aviators to fly from England to Australia within 30 days with a prize of Â£10 000. South Australian brothers Ross Smith (pilot) and Keith Smith (navigator) with engineers Walter Shiers (SA) and James Bennett (Vic) were the first successful crew.\n\nIn 2019, the centenary year of the prize-winning flight, we celebrate them and their significant achievement which paved the way for postal and commercial flights to Australia. For more information about the commemoration of this event in South Australia see the Epic Flight Centenary website.\n\nThe personal papers of Sir Ross and Sir Keith Smith held by the State Library of South Australia have been digitised and are now available through this website."
