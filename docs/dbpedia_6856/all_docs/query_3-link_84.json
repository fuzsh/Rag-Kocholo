        "text": "Just imagine how you'd feel if you'd just been hit with a $9.26 million penalty.\n\nFor almost every single Australian, it would be a devastating prospect.\n\nIt would mean a trip to the courts to declare bankruptcy, be stripped of your dignity and almost all your worldly possessions and forced to toil for years to at least partly repay some portion of the debt.\n\nUnsurprisingly, if seen through that lens, Qantas's decision to strip former chief executive Alan Joyce of that amount left many feeling justice had been served.\n\nBut perhaps the company's actions should be viewed in a somewhat different light.\n\nAs the dust settles on his ignominious departure last year, the grim reality is that — even after the so-called penalty — Joyce will still walk away with around $13 million for his final year.\n\nIt was a performance that included serious breaches of industrial law, in a battle that went all the way to the High Court, and a $570 million settlement with the competition regulator — including a $120 million fine — after it accused the airline of selling 8,000 tickets on already-cancelled flights.\n\nIt then was forced to admit that it had thwarted customers from retrieving up to $500 million in refunds, a practice often referred to as theft.\n\nThey're just the most obvious grievances amongst a litany of complaints from customers and employees, which sit alongside some dubious decisions that stripped shareholders of returns and left the company saddled with a multi-billion-dollar bill for new aircraft.\n\nIn almost any other workplace environment, the employee in question would have been sent packing.\n\nInstead, in a detail that hasn't been widely reported, Joyce has left Qantas with his salary intact and a bonus just shy of $7 million.\n\nShow us the outperformance\n\nHere's how the Oxford Dictionary defines the word bonus: \"A sum of money added to a person's wages as a reward for good performance.\"\n\nTry as they might, it would be a challenge for even his most ardent admirers to ascertain just which particular element of Joyce's final year justified such a magnificent reward — one that more than doubled his already incredibly generous salary arrangements.\n\nAccording to the Qantas board, which hired an expert to compile the report that \"stripped the former CEO of much of his bonus\", what went down in Joyce's final year wasn't deliberate.\n\n\"The review found that mistakes were made by the Board and management which contributed to the Group's significant reputational and customer service issues,\" it announced.\n\n\"There were no findings of deliberate wrongdoing.\"\n\nThank heavens for that. Although, it does beg some obvious questions.\n\nSacking 1,700 workers on extremely dubious grounds is one thing. But to then lose the case in a highly publicised court battle, double down with an appeal that was trounced and then go down in a monumental judgement in the High Court, sounds just a little more serious than a mere \"mistake\".\n\nIt sounds more like a serious lapse of judgement based upon a ruthless pursuit of profit at the expense of all else.\n\nWhy would they do that? Let's not forget that senior executive bonuses are largely based upon profit growth and share price performance.\n\nThe master of spin\n\nMuch has been made of Joyce's genius when it came to keeping Qantas earnings aloft and his ability to rescue the airline in times of trouble.\n\nRarely is it mentioned that most of Qantas's most turbulent financial times were the result of self-inflicted wounds under the command of Joyce.\n\nAlmost from the day he was anointed chief executive, Joyce went to war with Qantas pilots and cabin crew over pay and conditions.\n\nIt all culminated in the dramatic shutdown of the airline on the weekend before Melbourne Cup day in 2011, leaving 98,000 passengers stranded on tarmacs across the globe.\n\nIn one fell swoop, Joyce alienated his customers, his staff and shareholders, who had to bear the brunt of the costs.\n\nThat action, spun as an industrial relations triumph, plunged Qantas into its first-ever loss.\n\nWorse was to come. In 2014, Joyce went begging to Canberra for a government bailout after his disastrous attempt to put Virgin out of business. Determined to maintain domination of the domestic skies, he slashed domestic flight prices in a strategy that almost collapsed the business.\n\nEach episode ended up a costly failure although, with the aid of a compliant media, they somehow were rebirthed as examples of strategic brilliance.\n\nAfter the record $2.8 billion loss in 2014, the company was forced to sack thousands of workers, but pitched the strategy as a \"Transformation Program\", the success of which was duly reported by an adoring press for years.\n\nThat kowtowing continues to this day. This week, we learned that, despite his many shortcomings, Joyce ensured Qantas remained one of the only airlines to have never gone broke.\n\nThe kudos for that achievement, however, should go to the Morrison government during the pandemic, which showered $2.7 billion in taxpayer funds on the airline, and the Albanese government for nobbling offshore competitors such as Qatar.\n\nBut it is shareholders who will be left to pay for Joyce's legacy.\n\nWhen he was elevated into the top job, the average age of Qantas's fleet of aircraft was just 8 years. It's now almost doubled to 15 with some jets well into their third decade of use.\n\nThe replacements come with a $15 billion price tag that will hinder profit growth for years to come.\n\nA poor long-term decision by Joyce, maybe. But at least it helped prop up earnings while he was there. And bonuses."
