        "text": "— AROUND AUSTRALIA air CENTENARY —\n\n1924 – 2024\n\nThe first circumnavigation of Australia by aeroplane was in 1924, making 2024 the 100th anniversary. That this was not undertaken until 5 years after the first (1919) and many subsequent flights from England to Australia, is testament to the difficulty in undertaking this endeavour. Even today, it is a project of logistics, flight planning and time management – but in 1924 it was a gargantuan mission, involving military forces, grit and some luck.\n\nThe flight was conducted under the auspices of the new Royal Australian Airforce, using a Fairey Mk iii D Seaplane, and piloted by Wing Commander James Goble and Flight Lieutenant McIntyre, in a primitive fragile aircraft through inhospitable terrain, it was an incredible achievement.\n\nIn April and May of 2024 Michael Smith (AG Adventurer of the Year 2016) will retrace this historic journey in the modern seaplane “Southern Sun.” The route and dates will be followed as close as possible, to celebrate the anniversary and great achievement, and look at how aviation and the towns visited have changed over the last 100 years.\n\nTo follow regular video updates:\n\nSubscribe to Youtube Southern Sun TV\n\nFollow Southern Sun Journey on Insta and Facebook\n\nTo follow progress of Sothern Sun, please visit:\n\nCloud.tracplus.com\n\nLogin: southernsunpub\n\nPassword: aroundoz24\n\nRead the First Around Australia Flight History by Tom Lockley. PDF download here.\n\nSponsored by Australian Geographic and Bremont, the voyage will be photographed, journalled and filmed, so that the story can be shared along the way and afterwards with talks and further media. Other planes will be invited to join in for legs of the trip, and we are making contact with towns to arrange rendezvous along the way.\n\nTo follow regular video updates:\n\nSubscribe to Youtube Southern Sun TV\n\nFollow Southern Sun Journey on Insta and Facebook\n\nTo follow progress of Sothern Sun, please visit:\n\nCloud.tracplus.com\n\nLogin: southernsunpub\n\nPassword: aroundoz24"
