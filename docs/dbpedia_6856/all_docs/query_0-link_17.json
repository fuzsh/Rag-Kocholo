        "text": "Photographs by Contemporary Australian artist Rosemary Laing (1959–May 2024) address the landscape and ideas of colonial reach, dislocation and disruption.\n\nLaing is synonymous with her expansive, cinematic view of the Australian landscape and its history. Although she creates all her works ‘in-camera’, without 3-D computer-generated imagery or Photoshop, her captivating frames push at the edges of imagination. Having earned a prominent place in Australian art during the 1990s, Laing often photographed places that are restricted or remote, and her works subtly engage with the politics of place, ruminating on background events that continue to affect the present. She originally trained as a painter but became interested in photography after recognising its potential…\n\nto rearticulate visual language and expression. To me, as a young artist, painting felt like an over-colonized area with a masculine history that didn’t fit what I needed to see . . . Photography . . . of course, has its own set of issues, and is also a troubling framework, yet it still seemed to be a form that offered a more reflexive and reflective relationship with the world of that time.1\n\nRosemary Laing ‘NASA – Kennedy Space Center #1’ 1998–99\n\nNASA – Kennedy Space Center #1 1998–99 (illustrated) is one of several works from the 1990s that relate to air travel and flight, and ‘a collapse in the experience of time and space brought about by the acceleration in instantaneous transmission between one point and another’.2 During this period, Laing was particularly interested in the machinery and physical support structures that enable complex global logistics and international travel. An earlier ‘airport’ series explores these transit hubs as meeting points between the sky and the ground, where human ingenuity defies gravity. Yet airports themselves reveal surprisingly little about their impact on society and are often static, nondescript buildings through which people and objects pass on their way to other destinations.3\n\nIn NASA – Kennedy Space Center #1, Laing engages the function of these spaces by subtly anthropomorphising the shuttle’s body:\n\nThe view from below the underside of a space shuttle receding into the centre-distance . . . suggests a particular cinematic imaginary — the sublime filmic experience of the spacecraft passing ‘overhead,’ a receding into the immensity of the unknown . . .\n\nMachines have become both bodies and ideal image forms . . . [and] the hand-tagged underside of the space shuttle . . . (the tags marking the surface tiles damaged during re-entry) imbues it with a character of a body prepared for surgery.4\n\nRosemary Laing ‘flight research #4’ 1999\n\nLaing was similarly occupied with ideas of travel in flight research #4 1999 (illustrated). Here, however, her attention shifts from vehicles and infrastructure to the human body — in particular a white body — and she muses on the experiential dimension more overtly. Surrounded by a blue sky with a gradient that shifts to yellow along the lower edge, a woman in an ornate white wedding dress is fixed mid-air at the top of her arc, neither falling nor climbing. Both the figure and time itself appear to have been suspended. This pause offers the potential for reflection, but given the economy of the scene and its focus on a costume that raises sentiments of belonging, union and tradition, there is perhaps another sense of dislocation at play, too. By removing the horizon — the grounding factor — Laing shows how familiar historical constructs of ownership and belonging to the landscape are easily disrupted, and how amorphous identity can become when we look through its scaffolding.\n\nRosemary Laing ‘bulletproofglass #3’ 2002\n\nThree years later, Laing’s concern with unresolved history became infinitely more pressing with works such as bulletproofglass #3 2002 (illustrated), in which the reflective quiet of flight research has been shattered by gunshots. Laing’s bride is now wounded and bloodied.\n\nAs she falls from the sky, out of control, a terrible sense of violation resounds, compounded by the angular forms of three birds surrounding the figure — are they swarming or fleeing? This harrowing tableau recalls Arthur Boyd’s famous ‘Bride’ series with its dreamlike reflection on the complexity of race, sex, violence and love in 1950s Australia. Abigail Solomon-Godeau suggests that Laing is ‘signaling the dashed hopes and heightened expectations of the previous years’, referring, in particular, to a political climate now overwhelmingly marked by fear and self-interest, and leading to a polarised populous.5\n\nRosemary Laing ‘brumby mound #5’ 2003\n\nIn brumby mound #5 2003 (illustrated), Laing addresses the landscape and our relationship to it even more plainly, continuing to incorporate related ideas of colonial reach, dislocation and disruption. She creates a sense of culture seeping into new spaces — at once inspired by, but also interrupting, nature — filling an arid plain with items of furniture such as tables, lamps and chairs. Although caked with the same red earth they stand on, their forms are still recognisable. In some respects this leaves them doubly out of place, removed from a home interior to an inland interior. Laing’s strange act of camouflaging household wares is striking and mysterious, with a deeper question underpinning the scene: at what point do these foreign objects join the landscape? At a more fundamental level we might ask, how does a person belong anywhere? How does this vary from culture to culture and place to place?6\n\nRosemary Laing ‘Drapery and wattle’ 2017\n\nSimilarly, in Drapery and wattle 2017 (illustrated), from the ‘Buddens’ series, she constructs a stream from hundreds of kilograms of discarded used clothing that has been laid out in flowing strips over a river bed. By using fabric as a stand-in for water, Laing appears to remind us of the spectre of drought — yet the clothes also ‘carry the gravitas of the hundreds of bodies that once wore them’. The title Drapery and wattle comes from Grace Cossington Smith’s 1952 still-life painting (Art Gallery NSW, Sydney) and references her coften domestic view, but also her slow painstaking effort at making an image; one that required long (as opposed to instant) observations and analysis to break up what meets the eyes, before reassembling this stimulus into another language to create an image.7\n\nAs a final touch to Laing’s intervention, she has scattered leaves to integrate the colourful clothing into the natural environment of the location and to overcome the flattening effect of the photographic process.\n\nYet there is a deeper history to this particular dry riverbed. It runs into Wreck Bay in New South Wales, named for the numerous colonial-era transportation ships that were wrecked in the area. The sunken ship Hive — carrying some 250 Irish prisoners and a small number of women and children — is one of only three loaded convict ships to have wrecked in Australian waters.8 Looking beyond the immediate disaster, the site of Wreck Bay was also significant for early contact between the local Koori people and European settlers. Whereas this creek would usually run out to the bay, we might think of it as being flooded by people brought by sea.\n\nEdging towards paradox, Rosemary Laing’s monumental photographs consider the balance between change and integrity, separation and immersion, division and unison. Her theatrical scenarios might question the status quo, but they are no simple protest, nor do they offer any simple unexamined slogans. Laing knows that our perspectives on the past are not easily challenged or even perceived, and so her images make the reverberations of historical events newly visible with sparing turns to the uncanny, drawing us closer to the fullness of reality with her carefully composed flights of the imagination.\n\nPeter McKay is Curatorial Manager, Australian Art, QAGOMA\n\nThis text is adapted from an essay first published in QAGOMA’s Members’ magazine, Artlines.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Rosemary Laing, email to the author, 17 September 2019.\n\n2 Laing, email to the author.\n\n3 Rosemary Laing: A survey 1995–2002 [exhibition catalogue], Brisbane City Gallery/Gitte Weise Gallery, Sydney, 2002, p.16.\n\n4 Blair French in Rosemary Laing: A survey 1995–2002, p.17.\n\n5 Abigail Solomon-Godeau, Rosemary Laing, Piper Press, Sydney, 2012, p.31.\n\n6 Judy Annear in Victoria Lynn, Rosemary Laing, TarraWarra Museum of Art, Healesville, 2017, pp.13–17.\n\n7 Laing, email to the author.\n\n8 David Nutley and Timothy Smith, 2nd Report on the Maritime Archaeological Investigation of the Convict Transport Hive (1820–1836): Mainland Australia’s Only Convict Shipwreck, and the Schooner Blackbird (1828–1836), NSW Department of Urban Affairs and Planning, Sydney, 1995, pp.8–9.\n\n#QAGOMA\n\nOn display in the Australian Art Collection, Queensland Art Gallery (Josephine Ulrick and Win Schubert Galleries), Photographic machine 1968 (illustrated) by Australian artist Erica McGilchrist — whose career can be defined by the freedom with which she explored different styles and directions — was a passionate activist for women’s art, and ahead of her time.\n\nErica McGilchrist was highly regarded as an artist and educator, celebrated for her contributions to modernism in Australia from the late 1950s until her passing in 2014. She was born in Mount Gambier, South Australia, in 1926 but for most of her career lived and worked in a studio in the Melbourne suburb of Caulfield, creating countless paintings, works on paper and embroideries.\n\nMcGilchrist was a passionate activist for women’s art. In 1975 she co-founded the Women’s Art Register, which she coordinated until 1986, and she was widely acknowledged as an important community figure for this advocacy. She was awarded the Order of Australia Medal in 1992 for her outstanding contribution to the women’s art movement and in recognition of her own art practice. The Register is now housed at the Richmond Public Library in Melbourne and holds reference material on more than 5000 Australian and international women artists.\n\nA period of study at the Akademie der Bildenden Kunste in Munich from 1960–61, made possible by a scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service, was integral to McGilchrist’s development and also enabled her to exhibit in both Munich and London before returning to Australia in 1964. Yet it was more than having access to the climate of artistic innovation in Europe that shaped the artist at this time. Her travel was said to have come with strained romantic relationships in Australia and Europe, and the resultant emotional burden may have also prompted McGilchrist to experiment and invent freely.1 Improvised and uncensored, she held a deepening interest in surrealist automatism, as well as various modes of lyrical abstraction and figurative expressionism. In many respects, this sense of freedom continued throughout McGilchrist’s career — and perhaps even defines it. Linda Short, curator of the artist’s 2013 survey at Heide Museum of Modern Art, says that\n\nMcGilchrist typically allowed the mood or meaning informing her images to dictate her stylistic approach. As a result, she worked fluidly between abstraction and figuration, and often combined both modes in the one picture. . . McGilchrist’s ability to invoke feelings and states of mind through formal means is one of the strengths of her art, yet she always balanced the emotive tenor of her work with an intellectualism.2\n\nErica McGilchrist Photographic machine 1968\n\nMcGilchrist was arguably ahead of her time in taking such latitude and giving herself the necessary space to develop her interest in the human psyche, exhibiting more in common with postmodern artists of the late 1970s and 1980s than her immediate peers in the 1960s. Moreover, her engagement with broad feminist concerns — and her interest in the relationship between the individual and society — makes her work particularly relevant today.\n\nFor all McGilchrist’s fluid tactics, Photographic machine 1968 is a keenly resolved painting, with a clear design sensibility owing to an economic use of colour, line and pattern. Her repeating bars — and use of clean, straight lines in general — makes a skilful contrast against the sparing use of curves that denote two arms and a head engaged in the choreography of taking a photograph. In this balance of abstraction and representation, formal clarity and colour harmonies, Photographic machine has something in common with a particular European modernist sensibility, as found in the wit of Sophie Taeuber-Arp’s earlier take on Dadaism.\n\nIt is evident in her eloquence and clarity that McGilchrist delighted in her aesthetic explorations — both in Photographic machine and indeed throughout her career. While her works were broad in shape, her thoughtful character remained ever present.\n\nPeter McKay is Curatorial Manager, Australian Art, QAGOMA\n\nThis text is adapted from an essay first published in QAGOMA’s Members’ magazine, Artlines.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Linda Short, ‘Erica McGilchrist’, Monash University Museum of Art, <https://www.monash.edu/muma/collection/level-2-page/Firstlanguages-of-the-Collection/2019/Erica-McGilchrist>, viewed June 2019.\n\n2 Short, ‘Erica McGilchrist’.\n\n#QAGOMA\n\nAustralian artist Michael Zavros has made a significant impact on the Australian art world through the artist’s multi-decade practice. He has created depictions of luxury and beauty and works inflected with humour and ambiguity that challenge the mind and please the eye, prompting the viewer to consider their own values.\n\nOver 25 years of a rigorous practice, multidisciplinary artist Michael Zavros’s singular view of contemporary culture has attracted international recognition. His sought-after works explore worlds of luxury, even decadence, and are often filled with beauty. They convey a sense of desire and, more subtly, the artist’s reflections on identity. Glamorous depictions of idealised figures, stylish fashion, spectacular interiors, whimsical landscapes, purebred animals and playful still lifes are rendered with a painstaking precision and entrancing attention to detail that evokes the richness of his subjects. Raised in the Gold Coast hinterland and now residing in Brisbane, Zavros’s work is not without a challenging streak; many of the artist’s most successful gestures use humour and ambiguity to entertain a deeper meaning and prompt audiences to consider their own values and the broader patterns of society and the individual. Curiously, though Zavros is known primarily as a painter, he appears to reveal more about himself in his photographic, sculptural, video and relational artworks.\n\nMichael Zavros ‘Adam’s Apple’\n\nMichael Zavros ‘Debaser/Polka-dot’\n\nThe exhibition, ‘Michael Zavros: The Favourite’, began with a selection of insightful yet divergent explorations of contemporary masculinity, starting with his early ‘suit’ miniatures (illustrated Adam’s Apple 2000). Painted when Zavros was in his mid-twenties and still dreaming of the success that he would soon manifest, these contrasty, luminous panels take reproductions of fine tailoring and handcrafted footwear from fashion magazines and imbue them with the aura of a religious icon. Driven by devotion to lofty ideals, these works remain slightly impersonal — as if expressing a desire to be stylish, even beautiful, but also insulated from any pointed questions of self-hood by this veil of appearance. Nearby, the large sleek charcoal ‘Debaser’ drawings (illustrated Debaser/Polka-dot 2010) iterate this sentiment by depicting headshots of male models wearing the collars of high fashion houses, but with their faces significantly erased. This desire to construct a glamorous self that is free from any individual feature that could be descended on as a fault or failure quietly plays a heart-rending aspect of being judged for appearances — or even singled out and victimised for any intrinsic characteristic.\n\nMichael Zavros ‘Prince/Zavros 6’\n\nDespite their rugged, outdoorsy content, the ‘Prince/Zavros’ series (illustrated Prince/Zavros 6 2012) is in some respects a more cerebral exercise. Inspired by the North American conceptual artist Richard Prince’s ‘Cowboy’ works of the late 1980s, or at least, the record-breaking prices they have commanded at auction, Zavros reproduced by hand Prince’s own photographic appropriations of Marlboro advertisements. While Prince played with the potent symbolism, mythology and ubiquity of the iconic Marlboro Man within a media-saturated landscape, in appropriating Prince, Zavros ponders the life of the image, placing additional emphasis on its transition from studio to art market. Yet it is equally possible that Zavros is more sincere than Prince himself in his affection for the rugged cowboy mythology, demonstrating the tendency for North American culture to supplant the Australian experience.\n\nMichael Zavros ‘Dad likes winter’\n\nThe ‘Dad’ mannequin photographs (illustrated Dad likes winter 2020) present a series of unguarded moments made uncanny to explore a sense of alienation and even depersonalisation. Zavros printed a three-dimensional likeness to stand in for him doing his favourite things, like spending time with his family at the beach, or driving his prized English Red Mercedes. Inspired by a complex range of sentiments, these images address a desire to embody the taller, broader, smoother body spawned by social media expectations, and a more sinking preoccupation with the feeling that one’s interests, and even one’s very presence, might be broadly interchangeable within a certain demographic or cultural group. However, the ‘Dad’ figure is also about the constructions of self that happen beyond our reach — as Zavros experienced when he started gaining media attention for his success. As curator and writer Robert Leonard notes, Michael ‘and his curator-writer wife Alison Kubler became Instagram celebrities, society-page staples, wormholes between the garret and the gala. Everything Zavros did seemed to be news’.1 This attention gave Zavros’s second self an oddly alien character that was largely unrecognisable to him and his loved ones – and in part, it is to this gap of recognition that Zavros gives image. Beyond the gesture itself, it’s worth noting the sad irony that this monotone dummy appears to yield a more nuanced appreciation of contemporary masculinity than many dominant mainstream narratives currently do.\n\nMichael Zavro ‘1820s Regency leather sofa/Favela chair/Champion Dachshund ‘Windkiedach Wiggle’/a Dale Frank’\n\nIn one gallery space, the works consider ownership and the trophy phenomenon in fine grain; the way in which special classes of capital also act as social currency. On the walls at the centre of three large and lavish monochrome interiors, Zavros has painted artworks by the very recognisable and coveted Australian artists Emily Kame Kngwarreye, Dale Frank (illustrated 1820s Regency leather sofa/Favela chair/Champion Dachshund ‘Windkiedach Wiggle’/a Dale Frank 2008) and Bill Henson. In this context, the artworks take on a ‘designer’ aspect, their intended meaning slightly subsumed by the luxury of their surroundings, operating instead as emblems of the absent owner. A more nuanced reading might recognise that these works could also play backdrop to various domestic scenes: time spent resting or recuperating, sharing meals, studying, or any number of life’s joys and pains. While it might seem obvious that evocative artworks can enrich a collector’s private life, these interiors challenge the art-world presumption that the ideal experience of a work of art is in a neutral public space: accessible, but distinctly isolated from everyday existence.\n\nMichael Zavros ‘Trophy’\n\nMichael Zavros ‘White Onagadori’\n\nAlongside these works appears a selection of Zavros’s dramatic equestrian paintings, drawings and sculptures (illustrated Trophy 2010), which show the power (and vulnerability) of thoroughbreds; quixotic images of the rare Japanese Onagadori chicken (illustrated White Onagadori 2006) with its stunning but impractically long tail; and small paintings of European palaces such as Hanover’s Gartensaal and Sanssouci in Potsdam, which the artist has infused with sense of outdated opulence (many of these having been painted, literally, from the faded pages of old books). These works can be read in terms of possession and ambition, but also devotion and fragility. This facet of Zavros’s practice culminates in spectacular paintings in which gleaming bodybuilding equipment appears within the pinnacles of Western magnificence: the Palace (illustrated Echo 2009) and Trianon (illustrated The new Round Room 2010–12) at Versailles. The scenario conjures a mischievous absurdity that points to a darker undercurrent of extraordinary power in extreme isolation, perceiving something of our increasingly stratified class structure and its recurrence throughout history. As Zavros explains,\n\nI wanted to create something that had a post apocalyptic feel. Something that was joyous and celebratory and glittery, but also at the same time ominous, with an air of foreboding . . . For The new Round Room I cast myself as the new Sun King occupying and decorating the strange theme park that is Versailles . . . a folly within a folly.2\n\nMichael Zavros ‘Echo’\n\nMichael Zavros ‘The new Round Room’\n\nZavros’s Narcissus-themed self-portraits are arguably his most iconic gestures, V12/Narcissus 2009 and Bad dad 2013 (illustrated), especially. Their impeccable, seductive surfaces reward our close attention, while intelligently updating the terms of reference for the ancient Greek myth about the relationship between the love of self and love of others. Zavros, however, is largely ambivalent about moral interpretations of his work; from that perspective, the images are more about recognising the aspirational yet insulating character of our contemporary culture — meditations on consumer meditations — than intended to stoke a fervent critique of consumerism and excess.\n\nMichael Zavros ‘Bad dad’\n\nReflections of the artist also appear in his depictions of his children — Phoebe, Olympia and Leo. Phoebe (illustrated Phoebe is 11/Linda Farrow 2017) is a natural performer, interested in fashion, make-up and role play. Many works featuring Phoebe explore ideas of identity construction and coming of age. Olympia also appears, though less frequently; she’s more interested in being behind the easel or camera, or a drum kit. Leo distinguishes himself with a surprisingly versatile air of ‘rebel without a cause’. These paintings (and occasional photographs) are complex. They can be read as revealing intimate aspects of family life, yet in many respects, are intended more lightly: observational, but playful. Phoebe, Olympia and Leo aren’t necessarily playing ‘themselves’; instead, they play characters invented in collaboration with Zavros. The temptation to ponder questions about responsible parenting or, again, the moral climate in which children are raised today, should play relatively faintly.\n\nMichael Zavros ‘Phoebe is 11/Linda Farrow’\n\nIn recent years, still life has been a pillar of Zavros’s practice. We see opulent arrangements of fruits and flowers, seashells and vases on pristine white canvases conjure all kinds of animals from poodles to peacocks, and from giant pandas to the mythological Phoenix (illustrated The octopus 2014). These works recall the fantastical proto-surrealist portraits of sixteenth-century Italian painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo, who often fashioned his subjects from clever compositions of vegetables. Whereas Arcimboldo’s approach was dark and grotesque, Zavros’s is light-filled and light-hearted, overtly operating at surface level. In this way, his still lifes are less about trickery or illusion and more a pure game or joke, consciously walking the limits of artifice, painterly skill, and the construction of meaning.\n\nMichael Zavros ‘The octopus’\n\nThe exhibition concludes with a large-scale mural, filling GOMA’s Gallery 1.2. Titled Acropolis now 2023, the work is an invocation of the great achievements of Greek society and culture, framed through the distance of time. Here, it provides a backdrop for awareness of cultural repatriation movements, and references a certain locus of community gatherings, recalling the Greek cafes and clubs that his father frequents. Extending the ambiance, backgammon tables invite the audience to linger, learn the game and socialise.\n\nDespite a fixation on outward appearances and investment in the surface level, Michael Zavros plumbs a multitude of emotional and psychological depths. In that regard, it is not so surprising that Zavros prefers to say little about his work, other than to encourage an open-ended interpretation and to temper the desire to quickly ascribe a critical view. While our relationship to his subjects can be complicated, perhaps our appreciation for his themes of beauty and family, and his penchant for self-reflection, need not be.\n\nPeter McKay is Curatorial Manager, Australian Art.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Robert Leonard, ‘The devil’s in the detail’, in Michael Zavros: The Favourite, QAGOMA, Brisbane, 2023, pp.64.\n\n2 Michael Zavros, quoted in Mariam Arcilla, ‘Michael Zavros: Capturing the Prince’, Vault, no.3, April 2013, p.77.\n\n‘Michael Zavros: The Favourite‘ in 1.1 (The Fairfax Gallery) and 1.2 was at the Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) in Brisbane from 24 June to 2 October 2023.

It speaks of colonial violence and the consequences of being on the ‘wrong’ side of history, purchased in 2019, this powerful and sobering work is a major acquisition for the QAGOMA Collection.\n\n‘Bloodlines’\n\nPreliminary sketches for ‘Bloodlines’\n\nIn his lifetime, Bennett was widely regarded as one of Queensland’s, and indeed one of Australia’s, most perceptive and inventive contemporary artists. After exhibitions at Brisbane’s Bellas Gallery and Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art in the late 1980s, Bennett was promptly included in major national events such as ‘Perspecta’ at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1989, the Art Gallery of South Australia’s Moët & Chandon Touring Exhibition, the ‘Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art’ in 1990, and the landmark ‘Balance 1990: Views, Visions, Influences’ at the Queensland Art Gallery (QAG). Given the difficult nature of his primary subject matter — the overlooked and unresolved crimes of Australia’s colonial period, and the persistent racism that has followed into the present — Bennett’s early and sustained success is testament to the intellectual and aesthetic relevance of his practice and the authenticity of his expression.\n\nBloodlines is an early triptych that relates to Bennett’s ‘welt’ series of paintings, which is somewhat underrepresented in critical discussions of his practice. Bennett embarked on this body of work in France in December 1991 during the 12-month travel scholarship he was awarded through the Moët & Chandon Australian Art Fellowship he won that same year.1 At this time, Bennett frequently referenced the ‘drip technique’ of American abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock, sometimes using it to invoke a tangled web of history. More than a compositional device and clever art reference, he used the visual matrix of these netted drips to represent the narrative of destiny and sense of entitlement that cast Western colonial expansion across the globe. This same narrative also served to frame the First Nations people they encountered as primitive, in a state of nature which, by extension, served to rationalise that their lands were empty and therefore ripe for ‘civilisation’.2\n\nRELATED: Delve deeper into the art of Gordon Bennett\n\nSIGN UP NOW: Be the first to know.

Brown lashes of paint are surrounded by a field of black and white dots that depict a colonial sailing ship braving a storm. In the lower half of this field, seven decapitated Aboriginal heads in red strike a pattern reminiscent of the composition used in The Raft of the Medusa 1818–19 by French Romantic painter Théodore Géricault. Géricault’s original memorialises, if not sensationalises, a tragic group of withered survivors from the shipwreck of the French naval frigate Méduse. Crucially, however, while Géricault’s original subjects float on rough seas, Bennett’s seem bound to the turbulent field itself, unable to resist the waves of Western culture that engulf them.\n\nBennett’s scenario incorporates his view that Pollock was an inheritor and beneficiary of the colonial mindset, primarily for his heavy debt to the otherwise marginalised Navaho sandpainting tradition. Though he was most likely sincere in his intentions, neither Pollock nor his promoters questioned the binary perspective of the civilised white innovator channelling the raw and primitive forms of an unsophisticated other.3\n\nExploring Pollock from another angle, in the ‘welt’ works, Bennett buried his drips under a uniform dark monochrome paint-skin. As he explains in reference to the first such example,\n\n. . . this created a surface which looked remarkably like an illustration of the scarified back of an African slave I later saw reproduced in a book about the representation of Blacks in the nineteenth century; the title of the triptych was A Typical Negro, 1863.4\n\nThis famous image of a ‘scourged back’ was circulated as a photographic carte de visite, and further popularised as an engraving in Harper’s Weekly.5 The subject of the work, who was known as Gordon or ‘Whipped Peter’ (suggesting his name might have been Peter Gordon), was an escaped African-American man who had been enslaved on a Louisiana plantation run by a brutal overseer. The image is historically significant not only for the horror it documents, but also for its influence on public opinion toward slavery. The high circulation of Harper’s Weekly meant that the image had significant enough exposure to become a rallying point for the northern United States to intervene in the South. Bennett remarked:\n\nWith the ‘welt’ pieces I wanted to convey the wounding of the human spirit, its scarification; the overpainted Modernist trace of a Pollock skein as metaphor for the scar as trace, and memory, of a colonial lash . . . It may be argued that in taking this position I am portraying black people as victims. This was indeed my intention and I wanted not only to ‘play the victim’ but to take it further and use that energy to advantage by not resisting, or trying to display strength, but to show pain and how much it hurts, even to the extent of self-mutilation.6\n\nWhile the monochrome overpainting in Bloodlines clearly references the skin of People of Colour and the history of violence directed toward them in the patterns of scarring, there is also an art historical precedent in the Russian avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich and his black square paintings. Malevich’s gesture was a long-running preoccupation for Bennett, as he explains:\n\nMalevich was most certainly trying to get beyond the medieval, denominational, religious confines of such [Russian] icons to a kind of\n\nspiritual ‘essence’ that was common to all humanity. I certainly have no quarrel with that, and I admire Malevich very much, but it is clear that in reality black and indigenous peoples, as people considered ahistorical — trampled, enslaved, exploited and discarded, their lands confiscated and wealth plundered over five hundred years of colonialism — were not to be joining Europeans on their great journey to that glorious sunset and spiritual culmination waiting for humanity just over the horizon line.7\n\nBennett’s monochrome fields weren’t simply painted over; they were also cut, revealing a blood-red wound. This visual allusion to the body locates the violence inflicted in the present as much as the past. It heightens the consideration of inheritable aspects of such vicious, sustained violence as widespread trauma. While the scale of Bloodlines and its cuts is engulfing, the near symmetry of their patterns recalls the lines found in the palm of the hand. In fact, close associates of the artist have confirmed that these markings are based on Bennett’s own palms. This, too, suggests violence as something carried and inherited, and perhaps the desperate and dramatic expression of staring at one’s empty hands. On this, Bennett stated: ‘In this [gesture] I am drawing on Aboriginal funeral ceremonies in which ritualised public displays of grief and mourning can involve bloodletting and cutting one’s own body’ — though, notably, he also cited the precedent of Argentine–Italian painter Lucio Fontana and his cut canvases.8\n\nThe narrow centre panel of Bloodlines, composed of a cluster of red oxide-stained and purposefully knotted ropes, conjures the visceral image of looping veins. A more literal interpretation, however, would be a field of hanging nooses. Vigilante justice in the form of lynching was not uncommon in the southern United States. In Australia, however, massacres or ‘dispersals’ were generally carried out with gunfire.9 This ambiguity might suggest that Bennett was making a more contemporary and local reference to Aboriginal deaths in custody. Hanging deaths of Aboriginal people in custody were shockingly common in Australia during the 1980s, and were a key statistic in the call for a Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody report commissioned by the Hawke Government in 1987.\n\nIt is conceivable that the use of symmetry was also intended to recall a flayed figure, and perhaps the Crucifixion. Although oblique, the notion is reinforced by the use of the triptych format, which arose from early Christian art and the tradition of three-panel folding altar paintings. Similarly, the title ‘Bloodlines’ might evoke the history of the Stolen Generations, and specifically the impact of eugenics and assimilationist policies. These were often supported and administered by the church, which allowed for the destruction of families and the erosion of tradition by asserting that Aboriginal parents had no right to their children, who could be taken by the government without cause. Furthermore, the memory of pernicious public discussions of the implications of mixed blood, and alienating follow-on questions of who can reasonably claim an authentic Aboriginal heritage — or, inversely who might be able or allowed to pass for being white on a measure of appearance or ancestral percentages — would also appear to provide relevant historical context to Bennett’s powerful gesture.\n\nConstructed by drawing on a wide variety of potent historical sources, Gordon Bennett’s extraordinarily searching and intellectually supple work Bloodlines seeks to better acknowledge the largely ‘hidden’ or ignored history of colonial violence in Australia, and its continuing burden on the present. Crucially, Bennett has taken great pains to include the frame of the binary mainstream narratives of black/white, primitive/civilised in his picture, and to include the consequences of this thinking on those people who are rendered less than. Sombre and even grotesque, Bloodlines attempts to shock a broad audience into an empathetic state, and jolt them into understanding the notion of ‘peaceful settlement’ as a myth.10\n\n‘Unfinished Business: The Art of Gordon Bennett’ was in the Marica Sourris and James C.
