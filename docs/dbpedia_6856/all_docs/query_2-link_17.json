        "text": "Do not feed raw meat or fish that has not been previously frozen due to the risk of tapeworm infestation! All meats and fish* should be previously frozen for at least 7 days in temperatures below -0.4F (-18C) to kill tapeworms. Tapeworms can be present even in inspected meats.\n\n*Tilapia fish (due to a particular parasite they can host) is recommended to be frozen at -20 C for 10 days.\n\nMost meals that include meat are mixed with vegetables and sometimes organs.\n\nIt is acceptable to mix different meats together in one meal as canines in nature would also eat from a variety of food sources and not restrict their meal to just one protein.\n\nMost dogs benefit the most from eating raw meat, as this is closest to their species-appropriate diet.\n\nHowever, it is also nutritionally sound to feed cooked meat in some instances.\n\nThis can be helpful in dogs that either refuse to eat raw meat or in dogs that are weakened or older and do not digest raw meat well.\n\nI recommend that you give your dog only small amounts of fruit, (less than five percent) as dogs usually eat only small amounts of fruit in nature.\n\nFeed fruit at least one hour before feeding meat or other proteins and a minimum of three hours after a protein meal.\n\nWhy? Fruit doesn’t digest well with protein. On its own, fruit exits the stomach quickly. When you feed fruit with protein, it sits in the stomach much longer, which may create undesirable fermentation.\n\nAvoid grapes and raisins. They are toxic to dogs and can cause kidney failure.\n\nBest fruit choices (in moderation): apples, bananas, blueberries, mangos, melons, oranges, peaches, pears, pineapple, raspberries, and strawberries.\n\n*Avoid apple cores, pits and seeds when feeding fruit.\n\n*Feed local and pesticide-free fruit whenever possible.\n\nFor more information on feeding fruit, please check out these articles:\n\nOrgans are abundant in important nutrients for the whole body and provide essential building blocks for your dog’s internal organs.\n\nThe amount of organs in a meal should be about 5% of the overall volume but it is also my experience that dogs that do not get organs and get essential supplements do well.\n\nOrgans do not need to be added in your dog’s food daily. Instead, you can feed them in larger volumes on some days, so the overall monthly volume is approximately 5%.\n\nOrgan meats include: kidney, liver, spleen, pancreas, heart, gizzards, lung, trachea, tripe and tongue.\n\nCAUTION! Be careful of overfeeding liver as there is a risk of hypervitaminosis A. For more details go here.\n\n20-25% of the overall volume of your dog’s meal should be comprised of raw bones.\n\nAvoid feeding the femur bone of larger animals (marrow bones), as they are too hard and medium to large dogs frequently fracture their large premolars (carnassial teeth) by chewing marrow bones.\n\nStick to bones that are easily chewable for your dog, such as lamb and goat necks, shanks, and chicken carcasses (all bones including chicken feet and wings).\n\nFor small dogs, chicken thighs, wings, feet or lamb ribs are all good.\n\nThe canine digestive tract is “designed” to digest bones. The strong stomach acids dissolve bone material to a greater degree which allows safe passage. The intestinal wall is strong and muscular to “deflect” sharper pieces of bone.\n\nIf your dog likes to gobble up large chunks of bones, feed chunks that are impossible to swallow and remove smaller chunks that you do not feel comfortable with. If your dog swallows a larger piece, do not panic. It will very likely be digested and pass without problems. You can also feed your dog a cooked squash mixed with 10% of flaxseed steeped in hot water. This slippery mixture will make passage of a large amount of bones easier.\n\nNote: It is normal for dogs that eat bones to have white crumbly feces. Harder stools also aid anal gland function and emptying.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, you should only feed bones every third or fourth meal. This meal can be given in place of meat, organs or veggies but it can be also mixed if you prefer.\n\nIt is recommended that you always supervise your dog when feeding raw bones.\n\nI recommend that you give your dog only small amounts of fruit, (less than five percent) as dogs usually eat only small amounts of fruit in nature.\n\nFeed fruit at least one hour before feeding meat or other proteins and a minimum of three hours after a protein meal.\n\nWhy? Fruit doesn’t digest well with protein. On its own, fruit exits the stomach quickly. When you feed fruit with protein, it sits in the stomach much longer, which may create undesirable fermentation.\n\nAvoid grapes and raisins.
