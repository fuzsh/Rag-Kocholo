        "text": "Alexander Hendricks\n\nMaster of Science in Green Technologies\n\nWhat has been your favorite Green Technologies project that you worked on at USC and why?\n\nMy favorite Green Technologies project that I have worked on was in my environmental engineering class. My group and I explored the different carbon impacts of an omnivore, vegetarian, and vegan diets based on specific food groups. We took an in-depth approach to how the foods are made, where they come from, and how they get to a location, which is something that not many people consider. The project really made me think about my own personal food choices and the impact it has, which has led me to make various changes in my own diet.\n\nHow has living in Los Angeles impacted your experience as a Green Technologies student?\n\nLiving in LA has greatly impacted my experience as a Green Technologies student. Los Angeles is one of the most innovative cities in terms of Green Technologies and there are countless companies and groups that are moving towards more sustainable energy in the city. Being able to see these different companies and their work firsthand has really inspired me in my classes. In addition, a lot of the professors draw on data and events in the LA area, which really makes the classes much more interactive and applicable.\n\nAs a Green Technologies student, what do you see as two of the most pressing changes our businesses and society must make in the coming years?\n\nThe two most pressing changes that society must make in the coming years are the transition towards more sustainable buildings and more incorporation of renewable energy. 39% of carbon emissions come from buildings, so society needs to focus around meeting standards such as LEED that will promote more energy-efficient, safer, and more materially responsible buildings. In addition to this, I think that another large change that needs to be made is to expand renewable energy infrastructure. Around 62% of current electricity comes from fossil fuels, so to avoid the impacts of climate change, this needs to be reduced through more sources like solar, wind, and tidal power.\n\nWhy did you choose to enroll at USC?\n\nI chose to enroll at USC as it had a program that uniquely fit my interests. After finishing undergrad, I knew I wanted to go into the renewable energy field and USC's Green Technology program precisely prepares students for work in the field while also allowing for flexibility in pursuing other interests, such as environmental policy or green buildings.\n\nLooking back, what is an experience at USC that you'll never forget?\n\nAn experience during my time at USC that I won't forget was going to a USC Women's soccer game with my dad in the Fall. My dad is a high school soccer coach and had two players playing in the game, so it was fun to both cheer on my school and share a fun experience at USC with my dad.\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about living in California?\n\nMy favorite part about living in California is all the different experiences it has to offer. I have lived down here for the past 5 years between undergrad and my first year of graduate school, so I have gotten to experience a lot of what California has to offer. It is one of the only places where you can go to the mountains one day and the beach the next. The city of Los Angeles itself is also incredible since there is so much to do from sports games to concerts to experience the hundreds of different cultures that have made different parts of LA their home.\n\nWhat are some personal achievements or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nWhile at USC, there are a couple of personal achievements that I have made. First, I have become accredited as a LEED Green Associate and earned my engineer-in-training certification, thanks to the education I have gotten through my graduate program thus far. In addition, I recently accepted an internship with ENGIE, the 6th largest energy company in the world, to work on renewable energy projects in Southern California.\n\nWhat advice would you give future Viterbi students?\n\nMy advice for Viterbi students is to get to know your professors. They are experts in their field and have a wealth of knowledge to draw upon, which can be useful to classes or even life in general. Often they have fun stories from working in the field or interesting projects that they are looking for students to get involved in, so knowing them personally is a great way to get involved in research at USC.\n\nArnout Devos\n\nMaster of Science in Computer Science (2017-2018)\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself\n\nI completed my undergraduate education in EECS and Management at the University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium. I interned at Siemens and EPFL. After that, I managed to secure a prestigious Belgian American Educational Foundation research fellowship to support my graduate education and research in Computer Science (CS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) at USC.\n\nWhat attracted you to choose USC for your graduate studies?\n\nUSC is well-reputed as an institution in general and has many distinguished faculty in the fields of CS and AI. My reasons to choose USC for my graduate studies are threefold: 1. Master of Science in Computer Science research is encouraged and supported by well-regarded faculty, 2. the program could be configured to focus on my interest in AI while getting a solid graduate breadth in CS, and 3. USC has an excellent location near Silicon Valley.\n\nTell us about your interests outside the classroom.\n\nFrom the very start of my studies at USC I have been involved as a member of the USC Marathon team. Through consistent and fun weekly training, many of us were able to complete the LA marathon. Next to academic life at USC, finishing the LA Marathon has been a very rewarding experience for me.\n\nTell us about some exciting and unforgettable incidents from your two years at USC?\n\nIn December 2017, I was lucky to be selected -- with the help of USC-- to attend the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) which happened in Long Beach, CA. Attending one of the premier conferences in AI and interacting with world-class researchers has been an unforgettable experience. In the Fall 2017 semester, I also attended the USC-UCLA Pac-12 game. Experiencing the massive tailgate and witnessing the game at Coliseum -- filled with 90,000 people --has been a truly unforgettable experience. Being felicitated with the USC Viterbi Masters Merit Award for Computer Science was a unique experience too.\n\nIs there something that may surprise people to know about you?\n\nContrary to most CS masters students, my background is actually in analog circuit design. My interest in physics and the urge to build things led me to pursue this interesting field of study. After working on more algorithmic circuit design and publishing several papers, I realized that my interest in the booming field of Artificial Intelligence was even bigger. This inspired me to make the surprising jump from analog circuit design to AI and machine learning. I can now say that I am very happy that I made this change, and I look forward to the future!\n\nOverall, how was the two-year journey at USC?\n\nActually, I managed to complete the journey in a little less than one year. Putting a lot of work into courses and research has been a truly rewarding experience. The collaboration with my project peers in Professor Lim’s Deep Learning course and great interaction with everyone in Professor Sukhatme’s lab are things I will cherish forever. Although my stay at USC has been very short, I believe USC provides an excellent environment for CS education and research.\n\nWhat are your future plans after completing your degree?\n\nIn September 2018, I will start my PhD in Computer Science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) as an EU Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow in collaboration with the\n\nMIT-IBM Watson AI Lab in Cambridge, MA. There I will be able to continue AI research on an international level.\n\nPriscila Oliveira\n\nMaster of Science in Green Technologies\n\nWhat has been your favorite Green Technologies project that you worked on at USC and why?\n\nMy favorite Green Technologies project was the one I worked on in my Renewable Energy in Power Systems course for a few reasons. This was the first course I've taken on renewable energy and on electric power systems and I really enjoyed all the topics that I learned there. I am also very curious about the development and deployment of clean energy technologies toward a sustainable future, which I was able to learn throughout this course. I worked on a team of six students of diverse backgrounds which was an enjoyable experience and a great opportunity to learn from my teammates and exchange ideas with them.\n\nHow has living in Los Angeles impacted your experience as a Green Technologies student?\n\nGreen Technologies is a highly interdisciplinary degree program that emphasizes green systems and the environment, energy technologies and efficiency, and sustainability and society. I benefit from multiple green energy and sustainable projects throughout the Los Angeles region. I have either studied some of them in my classes at USC or learned about them during my previous internship experience at the Los Angeles Water Quality Control Board. In addition, many of the engineering consulting and energy firms that I would like to work for after I graduate have offices in Los Angeles, and I have had the opportunity to meet and network with some of them at professional events on campus.\n\nAs a Green Technologies student, what do you see as two of the most pressing changes our businesses and society must make in the coming years?\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of the modern age in achieving sustainable development. The understanding that climate is changing has been widely received and countries across the globe urgently need to support efforts to further diversify their energy mix and the clean power supply of a rapidly increasing demand due to population growth. Climate change is an obstacle itself to eliminating global issues such as extreme poverty while countries also work to lower their emissions toward net-zero. I'm extremely curious about the development and deployment opportunities of, for example, bioenergy in Brazil. As the world gradually transitions from conventional energy sources to a renewables-dominant future, Brazil remains a global leader in renewable energy generation with its electricity mix made up predominantly of clean sources.\n\nIn addition, profit, for any business, is still the primary goal, along with growth being crucial to long-term survival. On the other hand, climate programs and policies not only require a high cost to catalyze but get grudging acceptance because of the lingering belief that environmental regulations - which would help to address the threat of climate change - erode competitiveness. The prevailing view in many businesses is still that there is a fixed trade-off: the environment versus the economy. Society will most likely continue using fossil fuels, which still supply more than 80% of the worldâ€™s energy, and thus, tax policies to reduce GHG emissions, for instance, will incentivize the deployment of new technologies (i.e carbon capture and storage) and lead to innovation that will further decrease their costs. The major sources of soil and groundwater contamination are organic pollutants, among which mineral oil is the most frequent contaminants.\n\nWhy did you choose to enroll at USC?\n\nSustainability is one of the most pressing global challenges today and as an Environmental Engineer, I am uniquely positioned to address this problem. My undergraduate and graduate education, engineering projects, internships and engineering studies abroad have equipped me for service and leadership in this field. Specifically, I took a Sustainable Design course while getting my Master of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice University where I learned more principles of sustainable development. It fueled my interest in this field and I really enjoyed everything that I learned in that course, which became a personal passion of mine. This led me to apply to the Master's Program in Green Technologies at the University of Southern California, that has given me knowledge of sustainable systems and clean energy to prepare myself to reach my professional goals, and the tools I need to make a meaningful impact in my discipline.\n\nLooking back, what is an experience at USC that you'll never forget?\n\nBeing a Master's student at USC has afforded me a lot of unique opportunities. An unforgettable experience at USC was being a student delegate at the 2019 Climate Forward Conference, which brought together international experts to discuss productive paths for action. I heard from state senators, a former governor, a UN Ambassador, CEOs, journalists and more. Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who led the U.S. in global Paris Agreement negotiations, delivered the keynote speech, and Mayor Eric Garcetti delivered a powerful lunch address on city-level action. Student delegates then went to the post-conference retreat at the USC Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island, where we distilled key takeaways from the panel discussions and participated in workshops. Ultimately, we came away with a resolution outlining actions that are key for seizing our individual climate power.\n\nAnother impactful experience was being the Director of Advocacy of the USC Environmental Student Assembly, where I have run a single-use plastic waste reduction campaign that has required me to communicated effectively and develop relationships with USC departments, faculty, students, and startups. I coordinated ten students and my coordination allowed them to have a sustainable practice while working to educate the USC community about the importance of recycling and the benefits of implementing environmentally sustainable solutions on campus such as mapping all water stations on campus and educating the USC community on the benefits of a zero-waste drinking water network. My main goal is to reduce the environmental impacts of the plastic products we design, use, and discard.\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about living in California?\n\nI was born and grew up in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and I was very connected with nature as I was growing up. I love swimming in the ocean and hiking in the mountains, and you can find many coastal cities that have mountains in California so it really feels like home here. There are also many National Parks that offer astonishing landscapes and unlimited fun.\n\nWhat are some personal achievements or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nUSC has afforded me a variety of unique opportunities. As the Director of Advocacy of the USC Environmental Student Assembly, I worked on a greening initiative to reduce single-use plastic waste that helped foster stronger working relationships between students and USC departments, faculty, and campus facilities by working collaboratively towards campus-wide sustainability goals, especially waste diversion.\n\nWhat advice would you give future Viterbi students?\n\nMy advice would be to try to get involved in extracurricular activities and build relationships with your peers and professors while completing the courses. USC offers many unique opportunities for students to participate in a variety of initiatives/activities outside the classroom such as student organizations, volunteering activities, on-campus student worker positions, ambassador programs, and so on, and from my personal experience, it is rewarding and enriching academically and personally.\n\nDrew Poulter\n\nMaster of Construction Management\n\nWhy did you choose to enroll at USC?\n\nI chose to enhance my technical knowledge and to have the opportunity to work on far-reaching projects around the world. I am grateful for my experience at USC, one that, in my opinion, is second to none. The network within USC encourages students to interact with each other which, in turn, builds their confidence and evolves their academic and emotional growth.\n\nWhat's an experience at USC that you'll never forget?\n\nOne of my most memorable experiences at USC was traveling to Greece for the Innovation in Engineering Design for Global Challenges where we worked in teams to develop and implement products intended to help refugees living in camps around the world. This experience changed my perspective on the world and opened my eyes to the suffering and determination of refugees who were trying to better their lives and their children’s lives. It was life changing and I am very fortunate to have been a part of this course\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about living in California?\n\nI grew up in California but when I started the program at USC I was finishing a long-term work project in New York. During my two years at USC, I made the weekly bi-coastal commute from California to New York. I have traveled to over 30 countries but honestly, there is no place I would rather live than California. First and foremost, my family lives in California and when you add incredible year-round weather and an eclectic culture that is always exciting and evolving with new ideas and events, it’s a win-win in my book\n\nWhat are some personal achievements or experiences you’d like to share?\n\nI have been employed by a large engineering firm for the last eight years and was not expecting to change jobs after graduation. However, new opportunities opened up after a fellow classmate encouraged me to explore the job market and subsequently, I accepted a position with Turner Construction, one of the largest international construction firms. Turner Construction is involved in some of the most iconic projects in the United States and I will be working on the new Los Angeles Stadium and Entertainment District at Hollywood Park. I am honored and excited to be part of a team that is building one of the largest projects in the country.\n\nIs there something that may surprise people to know about you?\n\nThe last four years I spent more nights in a hotel than in my own home. My previous job required extensive travel and many people think that I am joking when I tell them that I really did to live in a hotel. It was a unique, sometimes exciting, sometimes exhausting lifestyle that I fully appreciated.\n\nWhat advice would you give future Viterbi students?\n\nMy advice to future Viterbi students is to engage with your classmates and stay involved on campus despite working full time. I worked full time during my two years at USC and during my second year, I made it a priority to become more involved on campus. One of my favorite experiences of my USC Viterbi was participating in the Spark competition in Reno. During the competition, we were given a set of issues on a real construction project and instructed to design creative solutions to remedy the problems within 18 hours. We prepared for this competition for months and were guided by two senior-level project managers who took the time to carefully prepare us for this competition. The extraordinary experience was a valuable lesson in teamwork and staying focused as we multi-tasked towards our common goal.\n\nAdrian Samsel\n\nMaster of Science in Materials Engineering\n\nWhy did you choose to enroll at USC?\n\nI chose to enroll at USC not only due to its reputable online DEN system but also from all the great things I heard about the university and product development curriculum. From friends and colleagues I met through internships and full-time work, all I heard were positive comments about USC and its community. And they were right! I feel honored to be apart of the Trojan family.\n\nWhat’s an experience at USC that you’ll never forget?\n\nUSC Viterbi has a very good reputation as an engineering school and it has the top faculty and research opportunities. Moreover, the location – Los Angeles – is great and the weather is really good.\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about living in California?\n\nAs a DEN student I have never stepped foot on campus! I told myself that I would visit campus at least once before graduating but time flew by too quickly. I will hold myself to getting down to LA and seeing at least one Trojan victory in the Coliseum sometime soon. #FightOn\n\nWhat are some personal achievements or experiences you’d like to share?\n\nOne achievement that really stands out from my academic career was obtaining a patent from my undergraduate research. While designing and prototyping a nanoliter pipette, the thought of filing for a patent occasionally crossed my mind but I never thought it would become a reality. When the request finally went through, almost 1.5 years after submitting for one, it was very rewarding. Outside the classroom but also in undergrad, my proudest moment was achieving All-American status in outdoor track and field my sophomore year.\n\nIs there something that may surprise people to know about you?\n\nMost of my friends and coworkers are always shocked when they hear me speak to my family in Polish. Their reactions are hilarious since none of them expect it if they didn’t know beforehand. Although I was born in the US, Polish was the first language I learned and I’m very proud of my family culture and heritage; pierogis are the best!\n\nWhat advice would you give future Viterbi students?\n\nI think the best advice I could give to future students is to really take advantage of the opportunity to network with your peers. Whether its through class discussion boards or interactions during group work, you can truly take away another level of education from Viterbi classes by talking and listening to others. I know I took away a few lessons and wish I had done so even more.\n\nFernanda Gushken\n\nMaster of Science in Engineering Management\n\nWhy did you choose to enroll at USC?\n\nAll schools I got accepted, (including medical schools in my home country, Brazil), were very competitive, with excellent academics, hands on classes and personalized curriculum. What struck me the most about USC was the Trojan Family that I would be part of even after graduating. As an alumni, I realize that the time spent as an undergrad and grad student at USC went so fast that I would miss a lot the experience I had. Today, I attend professional, academic and social events with many alumni, current and prospective USC students and feel that we can continue supporting each other anytime.\n\nLooking back, what is an experience at USC that you'll never forget?\n\nAs part of the board of Brazilian Student Association (BRASA) and Brazilian Graduate Student Conference (BRASCON), I learned a lot about why we can go faster alone but further together. During my undergrad and grad years at USC, I coordinated professional and scientific conferences and learned a lot with students from other universities who were part of my team. We learned skills that professors try to teach us in school projects, but we only learn after trying ourselves in real life. In the events, my team and I learned about logistics, financials and academic content of the conferences, besides dealing with time management and efficiency that were essential to keep up with our school projects and exams.\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about living in California?\n\nBefore moving to California, I knew that I would have a good balance in social and academic life. All my expectations were met and even more, I was surprised by the diversity of nationalities, personalities, lifestyles, etc. Being immersed in such a diverse environment and engaging with several student organizations and Greek life definitely shaped my years at USC in a very positive manner. The weather is definitely a plus, especially with the possibility to travel to the beach or to snowy mountains in a 2-hour range.\n\nWhat are some personal achievements or experiences you would like to share?\n\nAfter graduating with my masters at USC, I had another big dilemma. I received a full time offer to work in a consulting firm in Boston and also got accepted to a medical school in Brazil (which is a 6-year undergrad major). It was a time I followed my intuition; I then decided to go back to Brazil. I want to pursue a career in medicine and management, both in public and private fields, especially working towards improving healthcare access, quality and efficiency in my home country. I feel very satisfied with the choices I made, especially because I understand we feel more grateful by going against the flow and choosing what we want instead of what the majority prefers.\n\nWhat advice would you give future Viterbi students?\n\nOne piece of advice I keep from my family is that, even if you graduate early or choose not to pursue a masters: never stop studying. Keep taking extra courses, maybe for a hobby or to learn a new language or skill. This feeling of constant improvement is healthy not only for our cognition but especially for the thirst for challenges and to meet people from different backgrounds. Another advice is that we have an intrinsic responsibility to support others that don’t have the same privileges as we have - not for the return or for our selfish sensation of feeling good. It becomes natural for me as I get to experience different realities, especially when doing volunteering work in healthcare, that I need to be accountable for helping someone everyday - and we students don’t need to wait to become governors or CEOs to do that.\n\nLily Lau Hou\n\nMaster of Science in Biomedical Engineering\n\nWhy did you choose to enroll at USC?\n\nWhile searching for the best engineering schools, USC Viterbi – School of Engineering was among the top 10 in the US. I chose to enroll at USC because of the uniqueness of the Biomedical Engineering MS program in its courses that build on strong engineering, business, and regulatory training programs, which align to my career goals. As a Fulbright scholar, I suggested USC to Fulbright and I was also awarded a USC scholarship.\n\nWhat’s an experience at USC that you’ll never forget?\n\nI just returned from an amazing and challenging week at the LeaderShape program where I had the opportunity to share and connect with other 57 amazing USC students from all across the campus. After going through a leadership and personal development, I’ve realized I became more inspired to make an impact in the world. I engaged in a self-learning process that helped me understand that leadership is not about becoming someone else, but about sharing who we are within our communities. As leaders, we build communities, we challenge ourselves to what could be, and we work towards making vision into reality. I was motivated to head and give back to my USC community. It was a life-changing experience!\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about living in California?\n\nI enjoy the perfect weather California has to offer! There’s plenty of sunshine, easy access to the ocean and delicious food. Another thing I enjoy about California, is the vast presence of biotech and biomedical companies and start-ups. This life sciences and biomedical ecosystem that California has to offer can be taken advantage through networking and career development opportunities.\n\nWhat are some personal achievements or experiences you’d like to share?\n\nI consider my most notable personal achievement is being awarded a Fulbright scholarship to pursue Master studies in the US. This Fulbright experience had given me the opportunity to make friends from more than 70 different countries and different cultural backgrounds, which has helped me grow as a person. This experience has opened my eyes and mind in new ways. As a learning journey, it is not only helping me pivot toward my specific goal of increasing competency in my academic area but also to new opportunities that I had not considered before. I am invested in leveraging all these experiences in the US into opportunities for both personal and professional growth. I am proud to be a Fulbrighter and thankful for this incredible opportunity.\n\nIs there something that may surprise people to know about you?\n\nIf you are in front of me, you would think that I am from China, however, people get surprised that I speak Spanish because I am from a wonderful, diverse, multiracial and culturally mixed country in Central America called, Panama! I also enjoy the diversity and multiculturalism I find in Los Angeles, and I believe that they both bring people closer together through embracing our differences.\n\nWhat advice would you give future Viterbi students?\n\nTo believe in yourselves, to be the hero of your own story! Maintain your goals in mind and be open to new opportunities! At USC, you will find lots of resources and opportunities to build communities and to network. It will be upon you to embrace these opportunities and to take the most out of them. Connect with people, make friends, tell your stories, and FIGHT ON!\n\nAbdulla Alshabanah\n\nMaster of Science in Computer Engineering\n\nWhy did you choose to enroll at USC?\n\nWhen deciding there were three factors that would lead to me enrolling in any school that had one of them. These factors are: having good alumni network, close to the Silicon Valley and having study-life balance. USC has all of them and this why I chose to enroll at USC.\n\nWhat's an experience at USC you'll never forget?\n\nRunning the 2019 LA Marathon as part of Team USC and raising nearly $10,000 that goes to combat homelessness in LA. Being an engineering student and training for running 26.2 miles wasn't easy at all but having a study-life balance is achievable at USC and this is what helped me to finish the LA marathon among the top 40% finishers.\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about living in California?\n\nPeople in the world are divided into either being a beach person or a mountain person, however, I am a mix of both. I enjoyed hiking the most in California and there is no better plan for the weekend than taking a hike in Santa Monica mountains then enjoying the waves of Venice Beach.\n\nWhat are some personal achievements or experiences you’d like to share?\n\nI was chosen by The Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) to receive the ECE Most Outstanding Student Award which is an award given to only one student out of all the 1000 MS students. I wasn't only active inside the classroom but outside as well as an active member of the USC Community as graduate boards member of two associations on campus, which allowed to have a family away from my family that I can celebrate my achievements with.\n\nIs there something that may surprise people to know about you?\n\nI am admitted into the PhD program at USC but before applying to the program I visited more than 20 campuses in the US and drove in more than 20 states, fortunately, I ended up applying only to USC and most of the schools in the University of California system, except UCLA of course.\n\nWhat advice would you give future Viterbi students?\n\nGraduate life would be the best period of your life if a study-life balance was guaranteed. flourishing in the classroom is not enough to create lifelong memories and being academically excellent and active in the USC community will surely guarantee you that so until you meet some of the greatest minds in the world at Viterbi School of Engineering, keep fighting on!\n\nRuchit Gandhi\n\nMaster of Science in Computer Science\n\nWhy did you choose to enroll at USC?\n\nMy main motivation behind Graduate School was to explore the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). USC has some great research going on in this area as well as affiliation to good research institutes like Information Sciences Institute (ISI) and Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT). Which I thought would give me more opportunities for practical experience. Besides AI specifically, USC has a reputed Computer Science Department and a great Trojan Alumni Network which also influenced my decision to come here. Apart from the educational stuff, the weather is another positive aspect about USC. Being in California the weather here is conducive for an International student like me. These were some of the factors that helped me decide that I wanted to be a Trojan.\n\nWhat's an experience at USC you'll never forget?\n\nMy time with the Trojan Bhangra Group! I have always loved dancing and Bhangra is something that is very close to me. Being able to pursue that here in the US was an amazing opportunity. I loved those practice sessions, dancing in the rooms at the Kaufman school (those rooms filled with mirrors are just amazing!). I also got the chance to perform at the Bovard Auditorium once. Performing in front of huge crowd was a different feeling in itself!\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about living in California?\n\nThe weather, Mexican food and the beaches are some of the things that I loved most about California.\n\nWhat are some personal achievements or experiences you’d like to share?\n\nAchievements I am proud of are:\n\n1) Receiving the Academic Merit Award from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering\n\n2) Being invited for a dinner with Dean Yannis Yortsos of the Viterbi School during his visit to India.\n\n3) Learning to cook, becoming independent and adjusting in a foreign country\n\nExperiences I will always cherish:\n\n1) Studying at a renowned university with smart students from around the world!\n\n2) Those busy exam weeks, late night study sessions in the library, fun spring and winter breaks!\n\n3) The numerous hikes that I did around LA - Hollywood Hike, Echo Mountain Trail, Devil's Punchbowl Hike, etc.\n\nIs there something that may surprise people to know about you?\n\nFamily and Friends are the most important ingredients in my recipe of life! Coming away from home, I initially had a hard time keeping in touch with everyone back in India. So I started maintaining a list of family and friends that I love talking to. The list currently has 15 names! I call them all one after another over a period of 3 months. Once the last one is done, I start from the beginning again. Talking to them helped me get comfortable during my initial days in the US, when everything was pretty new for me; also this is how I make sure to regularly keep in touch with some of the most important people in my life.\n\nWhat advice would you give future Viterbi students?\n\nExplore; try out different things; make use of the diverse opportunities available at USC; try to find things you like doing apart from study which will in turn keep you motivated; make friends; expand your network; see every failure as a learning experience and cherish even the smallest of successes!\n\nSiddhesh Kadam\n\nMaster of Science in Engineering Management\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself — where are you from, where did you do your undergraduate studies, how did you find your academic interests, etc.?\n\nI’m from Pune, India! I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at the University of Pune. While working as a data science intern at a company in Pune, I realized business and management skills are just as important as the technology itself. I learned that business strategy and decision making are all based on facts, generated by using engineering principles. In today’s world where technology touches everything, there is a need for people who understand both technology and business — that intersection is where I feel I can be close to both the fields I am passionate about. My undergraduate curriculum has given me a stronghold in the fundamental concepts of computer programming and analytics. I decided that I would love to make use of these technical skills to contribute to the business development of tech-based companies. I was sure that by pursuing my master’s in Engineering Management from USC, I would be able to fulfill my dreams.\n\nWhat attracted you to choose USC for your graduate studies?\n\nHaving my undergraduate degree in computer engineering and data science, I was more inclined towards specializing in analytics through the Engineering Management program.

To be honest, in comparison to other universities that provide a similar program, USC offers more flexibility in the coursework. With the right choices, one can streamline their studies to be the way they want, and I really enjoyed that.\n\nTell us about your interests outside the classroom.\n\nI enjoy playing outdoor sports like soccer and cricket. I am also fond of exploring new places, so I often put on my adventure boots and take treks in the area. USC has amazing grounds for all sports and I make sure I devote time for refreshing outdoor activities before returning to my academic schedule. My hobbies also include dancing — I was able to showcase my interest through a Diwali cultural event at Bovard Auditorium.\n\nTell us about some exciting and unforgettable incidents from your two years at USC.\n\nIn India, I had no clue how popular american college football is in the U.S. My most memorable experience was watching last year’s USC vs UCLA football match and also attending the tailgate before the game. It was a huge fest and seemed like the greatest carnival I have ever been to. What I like about this is people who are both directly or indirectly related to USC meet and celebrate the Trojan pride no matter what the result of the game is.\n\nIs there something that may surprise people about you?I seem quite reserved and reticent when I meet new people. But once I get to know them, I don’t stop cracking jokes and I’ll laugh with them until the end of the day. So, I do have a great sense of humor, at least that’s what my friends say!\n\nOverall, how has your journey at USC been?\n\nIt has been fantastic — surely a rollercoaster ride. Completing assignments just before the deadline, sharing knowledge among your classmates in the library all night long, partying on the weekends and having spontaneous and last-minute road trips all over California — these have all been great experiences I never would have expected.\n\nI feel I have also shared a good rapport with all my professors and my supervisors where I had worked as a student worker. USC has given me a lifetime of memories and Los Angeles is exactly where all the fun is!!\n\nWhat are your future plans after completing your degree?\n\nAfter I complete my graduation, I see myself working as an Analyst in top firms. As someone with a keen eye for details and a passion for data, analytics and business, I would love to gather and dive deep into the data, investigate outcomes and present them to my team members in the form of business solutions.\n\nWhat innovations/discoveries do you hope to see (or be a part of!) in the next ten years?\n\nI see myself utilizing my analytical skills to discover better sustainable energy solutions for a sustainable future. As renewable energy sources like wind and solar are intermittent and unpredictable, I want to develop a forecasting solution from monitoring and analytics technology so that I can contribute towards an increase in renewable power generation. Sophisticated analytics will enable renewable energy companies to have deeper insights, which will help them better manage the variable nature of wind and solar, and more accurately forecast the amount of energy that can be redirected into the power grid.\n\nJose Cobena-Reyes\n\nPhD in Chemical Engineering\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself\n\nI am originally from Guayaquil, Ecuador.

So far, I have felt encouraged to strive for truly unique and scientifically relevant research with the support of my fellow students, my advisor, and my Engineering department.\n\nWhat has surprised you most about the USC experience?\n\nI was most surprised about the strong sense of community here at USC. I came from a very small undergraduate institution and was afraid of being lost in the crowd here in Los Angeles, but I have experienced the complete opposite. I have made many new friends who come from all over the world and have genuinely enjoyed integrating myself into the PhD community within the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department as well as many other non-academic communities at the University.\n\nWhat is your current research project?\n\nI work on evaluating the impact of future changes in climate – such as rising air and water temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, shifts in storm intensities and rising sea level – on the resiliency and reliability of the Western electricity grid. These future changes in our climate have adverse impacts on the power generation sector and often impose complex feedback loops that have not been modeled with scientific rigor. Considering that electricity is critical to maintaining quality of life, human health, and a safe food and water supply, understanding the scale of potential challenges is critical to ensuring a reliable power grid.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence at USC?\n\nMy biggest influence here at USC has undoubtedly been my advisor, Dr. Kelly Sanders. Not only has she been an incredible source of information and guidance throughout my time at USC, she has also served as the basis for my personal support system. The relationship between myself and my advisor is one that I treasure greatly. Although she has helped me immensely in my academic career, I would argue that she has had a much greater impact on my personal growth and development, even if she doesn’t know it!\n\nWhat do you do for fun when you aren’t in the lab or classroom?\n\nI spend most of my free time training with the club triathlon team here at USC. I joined the team when I first came to USC and haven’t looked back! I was a varsity swimmer as an undergraduate and have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of learning how to exercise on land. On top of meeting many talented and interesting new friends, participating in this club sport has helped me maintain a great work-life balance.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about living in Los Angeles?\n\nThere are so many great things about being a grad student in LA! My favorite things include the incredible food, the eclectic neighborhoods, the beaches, and the lovely, sunny weather, of course!\n\nWhat are your plans for after graduation?\n\nThe dreaded graduation question…How I wish that I was confident enough to say that I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I graduate and where I wanted to do it! Ultimately, I dream of having a job where I am able to contribute to the improvement of our lives and the life of our planet. Although I haven’t decided on a career path, I would say that I am most excited about researching as a scientist or as a professor.\n\nZumra Seidel\n\nPhD in Chemical Engineering\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself — where are you from, where have you lived, studied or worked?\n\nI am from Turkey. I lived there until I graduated from college. I studied chemical engineering at Gazi University, then, I moved to Los Angeles for a master's degree with The Ministry of Education of Turkish Government Master of Science Scholarship in 2014.\n\nBefore I came to LA, I contacted my current advisor and have been working with his lab ever since! I learned so much and enjoyed doing research — the following year, I applied to the doctorate program. I started my doctorate degree with the Viterbi Graduate School PhD Fellowship in 2015.\n\nWhat attracted you to choose USC for your graduate studies?\n\nI met someone from USC at the career fair in Istanbul. At that time, I was applying for fellowships so I only kept brochures and contact email addresses. I was planning to contact USC and other schools that I spoke with after I found a fellowship.\n\nWhen I obtained the fellowship, I followed up with several universities including USC. I always received good vibes and very quick and sincere responses from USC. Since I am an international student, contacting people as soon as I need something is really important. This situation made me feel special and I wanted to be a part of USC.\n\nI really like my advisor’s areas of interest. When I was checking for a laboratory to work for, I found the projects were very interesting and I wanted to have experience in them.\n\nThe weather in LA!\n\nTell us about your interests outside the classroom.\n\nEach semester, I focus on doing one specific hobby and then switch the next semester. But generally, I love hiking, going to the beach, cooking, baking, watching movies with friends, and reading books.\n\nTell us about some exciting and unforgettable incidents from your time at USC.\n\nMy second year of my doctorate degree, I started a Health, Technology and Engineering graduate certificate program which was an interdisciplinary program between Viterbi School of Engineering and Keck School of Medicine. This program had two year classwork and a main project which could take longer.\n\nIn the first year at the beginning of the semester, we were supposed to visit CHLA (Children's Hospital Los Angeles) and define “a need” based on shadowing doctors or nurses or just simply by observing. At first, I was sure that I wasn’t creative enough and I wouldn’t be able to create a unique idea to fix a problem. Also, this was a very early morning class at CHLA (we were supposed to be at CHLA by 6 or 7 a.m.)\n\nDuring a visit to CHLA I was observing things, and started asking questions. When we went to their laboratories, I asked even more questions. At the end of the session, I had not only one but several ideas in my mind.\n\nThis was maybe the first time that I felt I am a real engineer. I can engineer necessary materials or items. Fun fact about one of the ideas: I was talking about an idea with one of my group mates and we brainstormed and thought on it — we even drew the prototype’s schematic. After two years, she and I went to a conference together and one start-up company presented very similar prototype. They talked to us, saying this was a real need and the nurses who are using it are so happy with the product. After this conversation, my friend and I looked at each other, thinking that those people could have been us! But we were so happy about that problem was solved.\n\nI have mentored students at my lab through Viterbi summer programs. I can talk about those opportunities if you want. Please let me know about that.\n\nIs there something that may surprise people about you?\n\nPeople usually study to earn a degree. Graduate school is for people who would like to explore deep learning in their field or specialize in their area of interest. Usually, people count down their days to finalize their studies and earn their diploma. When I started my journey at USC, my purpose was only receive my graduate degree too. But somehow, it turned out great adventure for my life.\n\nFirst of all, I met my husband at USC. And I have amazing friends who I can totally call as my family. I feel I belong at USC, and I feel like I am home. For me, instead of counting down the days, I am trying to enjoy my journey and use USC resources as much as I can while I am still doing my research.\n\nOverall, how is your journey at USC?\n\nOverall, it is super fun. Every semester, I find something new at USC. I don’t think there is any other university with options this diverse for students. I have never gotten a chance to feel homesick because I’m always doing something or trying something new. I have taken many elective classes in my department and other departments such as biomedical engineering, school of medicine, business school, even from French department or physical education.\n\nDo you have any advice for prospective students?\n\nThey should be adventurous and should not be afraid of trying something new. Getting an engineering degree could be hard and the coursework could be intense. But they should definitely be aware of their surroundings, opportunities — and enjoy being a part of USC!\n\nWhat are your future plans after completing your degree?\n\nI would like to work in R&D department and continue doing research in a leading biotech company by using my current knowledge and learning new skills.\n\nWhat innovations/discoveries do you hope to see (or be a part of!) in the next ten years?\n\nI would like to be a part of a research group or R&D department for solving real world or urgent global problems.\n\nOmar de Gante\n\nMs in Petroleum Engineering\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself — where are you from, where did you study or work previously, what are you interested in and why? I grew up in Puebla, Mexico, a city near Mexico City, I did my bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Universidad de las Americas. After finishing my studies, I was hired by one of the biggest Oil and Gas service companies in the world, and I’ve had the opportunity to work in so many different cities — Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Canada, India, UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhat attracted you to choose USC for your graduate studies? USC is a very prestigious university, with world class staff and a unique petroleum engineering program that focuses on the digital transformation and the use of soft computing techniques applied to the oil and gas industry. The beautiful weather and the multicultural outdoor lifestyle of Southern California is definitely a plus.\n\nTell us about your interests outside the classroom. I was the vice president of external affairs for the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) USC chapter. I used to plan events like technical talks from experienced professionals on campus and field trips to within the industry for fellow students. It was a very challenging but rewarding experience that gave me the opportunity to meet experienced professionals from the local oil and gas industry.\n\nTell us about some exciting and unforgettable incidents from your time at USC. Many things happened to me during my journey at USC but I will share just a few. After a summer internship with Chevron I got interested in machine learning applications towards oil and gas — this led me to take some computer science classes that were outside my field. But my curiosity and willingness to learn were stronger — I struggled in these classes but I was up for the challenge and manage to succeed.\n\nAnother unforgettable experience was that after several years of living apart from my brother, we became roommates in Los Angeles!\n\nIs there something that may surprise people about you? My brother and I became part of the Trojan family because we did the same master’s program, at the same time. We took the same classes and we were roommates for two years. Fun fact — professors thought we were twins! (We are not, I am the older brother). We also used to play water polo at a competitive level, and we had the opportunity to play again after many years in the water polo club at USC.\n\nOverall, how is your journey at USC? It was a great experience, and I would do it all over again, it was challenging and rewarding — not just academically but also on a personal level. It was great to share this journey with my best friend and brother because this journey made our ties stronger, and now proud to say that we belong to two families — the “de Gante family and the Trojan family”!\n\nWhat are your future plans after completing your degree? I am currently in the process of gathering relevant data so I can start research, I am also thinking of finding a challenging job in the oil and gas industry.\n\nWhat innovations/discoveries do you hope to see (or be a part of!) in the next ten years? There is always innovation in the field of petroleum, but I would like to see more innovation of machine learning applications and new computational techniques towards the oil and gas industry. I hope to see more innovation in alternative energies too!\n\nDaniel Depew\n\nPhD in Astronautical Engineering\n\nWhy did you choose the Viterbi School for your PhD program?\n\nI grew to love the ASTE department during my undergraduate years – a close, tight-knit community where I felt I really belonged. More importantly, however, I began doing research with a professor in the department during undergrad, and I enjoyed it so much that he is my advisor now. Staying at USC made the transition to graduate school really easy, as I’ve now lived in Los Angeles for four years and loved every minute of it, while maintaining a number of the connections I have made with people and companies in the area. There’s no better place to be than Southern California when it comes to the space industry!\n\nWhat has surprised you most about the USC experience?\n\nAgain, my situation is unique because I spent my undergrad years here, but I am continually surprised at how well USC collaborates with the surrounding community. It’s a mutually beneficial arrangement that has opened doors for advanced research and innovation.\n\nWhat is your current research project?\n\nI work with the Air Force Research Laboratory out of Edwards Air Force Base to model advanced monopropellant thruster systems. In particular, I’m currently conducting reactive molecular dynamics simulations to better understand the thermal effects on the catalytic decomposition of the propellants. Some of the advanced fuels being developed there are extremely complex chemically, which makes it a challenge to model effectively.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence at USC?\n\nI have been doing research with my advisor, Dr. Joseph Wang, since my sophomore year as an undergrad. He helped cultivate my interest in research and simulation, and it is largely because of conversations with him that I decided to stay here for my Ph.D. I later found out that he nominated me for the Viterbi Fellowship as part of my application for grad school at USC, which has been a tremendous blessing. Dr. Wang also established the connection for me to work with the AFRL, and I’ve never felt more at home working on a project.\n\nWhat do you do for fun when you aren’t in the lab or classroom?\n\nI’m a die-hard USC sports fan, and I enjoy supporting all of our athletics. The USC football experience is obviously unparalleled, but some of the other teams like tennis and water polo are the best in the nation and really enjoyable to watch. Also, the men’s basketball team is starting to get some much-deserved attention!\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about living in Los Angeles?\n\nMeeting all the different people! I moved to Glendale this year, and my roommates are in the music industry and currently play for artists like Big Sean and Justin Bieber, so being immersed in the entertainment epicenter of the world is incredibly eye-opening for an engineer. I love being able to go home at the end of the day and hear them make music in the studio!\n\nWhat are your plans for after graduation?\n\nI intend to work in industry somewhere in Southern California. Graduation is several years away for me, and the space industry is rapidly evolving, so I’m keeping my options open and preparing myself to be a useful tool for expanding our reach in the universe. It’s an exciting time for astronautical engineering!\n\nLaura Bradley\n\nPhD in Chemical Engineering\n\nWhy did you choose the Viterbi School for your PhD program?\n\nI was interested in Dr. Malancha Gupta’s work and her lab in the Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. USC has a lot of resources, and when I came out to visit, the department did a good job of showing what the department had to offer, as well as Viterbi and USC. Once I got here, it was all true – there are lots of things you can get involved in, and a lot of mentors that will help you to get the resources to do whatever you need to do.\n\nWhat is your current research project?\n\nIn our group, we use a chemical vapor deposition process, which is called initiated chemical vapor deposition, to deposit functional polymer coatings for a range of different applications. Typically, the process is used to deposit thin coatings on solid substrates, like microfluid devices, or coating silicon, as well as paper-based microfluidics. My research is introducing low vapor pressure liquids into this chemical vapor deposition process. We are studying the deposition of polymers into a liquid substrate to make novel polymer and polymer liquid composite materials for a wide range of applications, which could be in separations for proton-conducting membranes, as well as catalyst ports. What we have found is the deposition in liquids is significantly different from those in solid substrates, and we are trying to understand how the process parameters of our system can affect the polymerization to be able to control what’s going on the liquid surface and be able to fine tune the properties of the polymer materials we can make.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence at USC?\n\nDefinitely my research advisor. She has been a mentor at every aspect of my graduate experience at USC, which I really appreciate – some other students don’t get [this opportunity]. We started talking about my big picture plans further from graduate school pretty early on and we kept an open communication so that I was always working toward some things. She has helped me with my career plans, and that started pretty early compared to other students.\n\nShe has obviously helped me with the scientific details and everything, but she has also mentored me on the women in engineering aspect and how to be successful when facing some of the challenges that women experience. She has also encouraged me to get involved with the organizations supporting women engineers on campus which has been a really positive experience.\n\nOn a personal level, I can go to her for anything that I need and she is always welcoming and supportive, but she does challenge me too.\n\nWhat have you learned at USC thus far that you hadn’t learned anywhere else?\n\nAs an undergrad in the research labs, I got a good understanding of experiments: setting them up, data analysis, etc. But coming to graduate school, I learned the bigger picture of academic research: applying to get funding, collaborations within the university, how professors’ works and interactions happen. I learned what academic research is outside of my individual lab. I was able to see more in terms of the seminars on campus and a bigger community working together and sharing ideas and contributing to other people’s research. Just being at USC, I have learned more about independence – just being a graduate student and being away from home.\n\nI really learned how to sell my work and make my research more connected with other people and tell you why I’m doing this on a bigger picture and why it’s important. That’s probably the biggest thing that I have learned.\n\nWhat do you do for fun when you aren’t in the lab or classroom?\n\nI like to be pretty active and do anything outside: I like to run, swim, depending on the month. I also like to cook – I’m not a great cook, but I’m learning! So on Saturday mornings, I usually like to go on a run or a bike ride.\n\nFavorite class?\n\nI would say Heat Transfer. It is taught by Dr. Sahimi from the Engineering department. I had always liked heat transfer. That was during my first semester here, so it was kind of a shock because he is a challenging professor. I really felt like I had to step up to the challenge. At the end of the semester I was really happy with everything – I felt confident with the material, and I definitely learned a lot. For chemical engineering, I have to take three transfer classes: heat, mass, and viscous flow. They all rely on the same fundamental math equations, so once I got a handle on heat transfer; it was easier to understand the other classes.\n\nMehran Hosseini\n\nPhD in Petroleum Engineering\n\nWhy did you choose the Viterbi School for your PhD program?\n\nIn my Master’s studies, I was doing civil engineering. USC has a good program for petroleum engineering, so I wanted to combine them both to address some concerns regarding environmental resources for the U.S. economy.\n\nWhat have you learned at USC thus far that you hadn’t learned anywhere else?\n\nUSC has the SCEC – the Southern California Earthquake Center. My work is in induced seismicities, which is creating earthquakes. There are more than six hundred scientists and students involved in SCEC, and more than sixty institutions all over the world taking part. Its headquarters are at USC. This is an opportunity that I can’t have anywhere else. I can also talk to professors at the Department of Petroleum Engineering. It’s a very multidisciplinary area for me to research on! So I can pick people and knowledge from different areas; at USC, you can use many available resources and combine them into a nice PhD work, and learn a lot in the process.\n\nWhat is your current research project?\n\nI work at the Induced Seismicity Consortium. There are many things we work on. Shale gas is one of them that affects the U.S. economy. We want to make sure that we address the public concern about safety in terms of seismic activities, and essentially give them a blueprint or a solution to problems that might arise. We tell them, ‘If you do it this way, you may not get induced seismicities’, or the causes and main problems that can affect the public. We also have industry members with whom we work getting the data. It’s a very open forum for concerns. Also, publication agencies and governmental agencies ask us for data on the industry in years to come, and have a scientific discussion on that and address issues that might arise.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence at USC?\n\nThe head of the department in the petroleum engineering program, Dr. Ershaghi. He just got an award from the National Academy of Engineers. It’s a high honor, both for the school and for himself. He is a big influence on all the people that are in the program. We look up to him. I think he is a great mentor! He is always caring, and you can always talk to him. He is a very positive person. I am very fortunate to have him as the head of the program.\n\nWhat do you do for fun when you aren’t in the lab or classroom?\n\nI really like going on hikes or go to the beach. I also like the gym – the USC gym is really good. I try to go there a lot. Just hanging out with friends is nice too. My brother is also in town, so we hang out together.\n\nFavorite class?\n\nEvery class you learn different pieces and bit of your field of study. It’s also very personal because I really like Dr. Ershaghi. He has a course onReservoir Characterization. There is a multidisciplinary aspect of the course; you are not just focusing just on one area (a lot of graduate courses can be like that). This course was a larger, broader view from different aspect of reservoir characterization. He has more than forty years of experience in the industry, so a lot of people cannot teach that kind of course because they don’t have that experience. So that course coming from him was a really good and interesting experience for me.\n\nMark Harrison\n\nPhD in Electrical Engineering\n\nWhy did you choose the Viterbi School for your PhD program?\n\nFor undergrad, when I picked Viterbi, it was a lot about just USC, the school. When I was looking for schools, I got to see a lot of what went on in the Viterbi School. Some of it came down to getting a fellowship award from USC, which allowed me to have more freedom in what I wanted to do here. For grad school, a lot of it comes down to figuring out what research you’re going to be doing or what group you’ll be in. I liked the group of people doing research here, so I thought I would be able to find a group that would be a good fit.\n\nWhat is your current research project?\n\nThere is something that I’m working on more specifically right now, which is a fiber optics stress sensor for measuring the Young’s modulus of tissue samples. The Young’s modulus measures the stiffness of the material – how stretchy something is. Something with a high Young’s modulus is stiffer; you can’t stretch it or bend it as much as something with as lower Young’s modulus.\n\nPeople have used fiber optics to do stress sensing, but the setup is usually complicated. At the same time, people have done measurements with tissue sample where they can maybe differentiate between cancerous tissue and noncancerous tissue by the stiffness of the material. The problem is, right now, to do that you need these things called lured frames. They’re not difficult to use, but they are big, expensive pieces of equipment. The optical fiber sensors are relatively inexpensive, but the setup is complicated.\n\nWhat I’ve been working on is streamlining that setup to make something that is more portable, so that we can use it as a tool for researchers.\n\nRight now, I’ve been working more on the sensor and getting all the parts to work, getting it calibrated so we can measure using a material called PDMS – which is a kind of rubbery material that you can change its stiffness. So I’m measuring the stiffness of that material to calibrate the sensor. Once we know it works, we are hoping to take over the Health Science campus and actually measure tissue samples.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence at USC?\n\nMy advisor, Andrea Armani. She has been advising me for the past five years. She’s been really great to work with: very supportive, very understanding, and just a great resource. I’m really glad to have her as an advisor!\n\nThere is also a professor that has recently retired – Bill Steier. As an undergrad, I had him just once, but I had him a couple of times as a grad student and he was one of the best professors I had ever had. He is not only really smart, but he is also really good at teaching the theory enough so that we could really understand the concept without getting into some of the nitty gritty details.\n\nWhat has surprised you most about the USC experience?\n\nThere is a clean room in VHE (Vivian Hall). Clean room is where you do micro or nano fabrication-type stuff – people make computers in clean rooms. So I’ve gotten to learn clean room application stuff, which is cool as a grad student.\n\nAs a graduate student doing research, you really learn to manage your time and motivate yourself. I do have deadlines occasionally and I meet with my advisor regularly, but in terms of the work I’m doing, I don’t have really hard deadlines. So I have learned to manage my time and decide when I want to work and make progress on my research.\n\nThere are lots of different possibilities and opportunities at USC. I enjoy listening to people give seminars, just talking about their research, or other events of the sort. If I’m interested in academic research project, there are a lot of workshops about that – how do you go about applying?, how do you write a teaching statement of purpose?… being able to go to all these opportunities and get my work done is something I have learned at USC.\n\nWhat do you do for fun when you aren’t in the lab or classroom?\n\nYoga, restaurant hopping, concerts and exploring all the great things LA has to offer\n\nFavorite class?\n\nNonlinear Optics, which is the study of all the colored weird effects in crystals. Green laser pointers use nonlinear optics. It uses this thing called frequency dublin. For green laser pointers, the usual frequency for that light is 532 nanometers. It is difficult to make! But it’s really easy to make lasers at 1064 nanometers. The problem is that you can’t see that wavelength at all, so it’s not very useful! However, you can use some sort of crystal that doubles the frequency, which halves the wavelength. You shine the laser through a chunk of this crystal and on the other side you get 532 nanometers. The Nonlinear Optics class studies materials like that and how they actually produce that effect and how they can be used in optics.\n\nKevin Xia\n\nMS in Engineering Management\n\nTell us a little about yourself — where are you from, where did you study for your undergraduate/graduate degrees?\n\nI am from Shenzhen, which is in Guangdong, China. I received my undergraduate degree from Peking University, which is in Beijing, China, and majored in engineering. I got my master degree from USC Viterbi, and I graduated in 2013. Now I live and work in Shanghai, China.\n\nWhy did you decide on USC to pursue your graduate studies?\n\nI picked USC for its excellent academic program, robust alumni network, and its prime location in my favorite U.S. city.\n\nI majored in Engineering Management for my masters degree in Viterbi. It is a subsector within Industrial Engineering (IE). Like every other undergrad, I cared about university ranking in my area of study. And Viterbi was top 10 among all engineering schools and top 5 for IE. I chose Engineering Management to be my major because it is where engineering meets business. So I specifically checked with admission officers about the feasibility of cross-disciplinary courses.\n\nIt turns out that Viterbi grants its students a lot of freedom in designing their own curriculum program that best suits the individual’s development. In the end, a third of my courses were taken in Marshall. This really helped me a lot in the job market, because I demonstrated capability from both financing and engineering.\n\nI also admired USC’s strong alumni network. One of my mentors in Peking University, Professor Cai, got his doctorate degree from USC. He strongly recommended USC’s alumni network to me and said it is a close-knit community, even in China, that you will find Trojan is a big family. I felt the warmth when I joined several alumni events before deciding to take USC’s offer. And I really enjoyed Trojan community (and I still do!).\n\nFinally, location was an important consideration when I was choosing between different universities. Given where you pursue your graduate studies is tightly linked with job market, I wanted to be somewhere economically flourishing and abundant with internship opportunities. So USC’s location in L.A., being one of the top cities in the U.S., added significant weight in my consideration for offers.\n\nWhat did you like most about USC? (Can be anything from a project you worked on, a professor you liked, or a study spot on campus.)\n\nI liked many things about USC — the campus, the people, the courses, the sports, etc. Two professors ended up also being my favorite professors: Professor Thomas Olson from Marshall and Professor Dana Sherman from Viterbi. Both of them have given me so much guidance on courses, career goals, even life. They brought their knowledge of the industry into the classroom by sharing real-life cases and insights they had accumulated over decades. They showed me how to apply my learnings from university to the work. And after years I can still benefit from their teachings. I have so much gratitude to both professors.\n\nFootball games are another thing that often comes to mind. Growing up in China, I was actually not into American football. But watching Trojans play in the Coliseum, and feeling the crowd, the emotion, the intensity of the games — that really changed my perspective on the sport.\n\nAfter USC, what was your path to your current career?\n\nI had been with Bain & Company as a management consultant for three years after graduation and then I switched to the investment sector. My career as a private equity investor began with a local private equity firm. And after two years, I landed in Morgan Stanley, where I work today.\n\nWhere do you work now? Tell us about your current position.\n\nI work in the private equity fund of Morgan Stanley in China. As an investment professional, I visit many companies across a spectrum of industries. I evaluate these companies based on their financial and commercial performances and see if a deal could be struck. If a deal is successfully closed and we invest in a company, I closely monitor the development of the company and add value wherever possible to help our portfolio company grow in size. Then in a few years, we sell the stake in the company either through an IPO or an M&A to realize return.\n\nHow did USC Viterbi prepare you for your current role?\n\nAs mentioned above, Viterbi’s program prepared me with the combination of engineering and business, which was highly valued on the job market. In addition, USC is on almost all major companies’ “target school lists.” With USC on my resume, it opened a lot of doors, both in the US and China. Finally, Trojan’s tenacity and fight-on spirit have always been inspiring me to punch through difficulties.\n\nWhat advice would you give to prospective students?\n\nUSC is like a treasure box. It never fails to surprise you with what you can learn or benefit from its people, its culture, and its community. I advise prospective students to fully explore and leverage the university. Take classes in other departments. Talk to students from different countries, different majors. Join clubs, events, career fairs. Watch sports games, or even play them. It will not only broaden your horizons, but also cement your transformation into a Trojan, who will keep fighting on throughout life.\n\nUlubilge Ulusoy\n\nMS in Astronautical EngineeringRocket Scientist of the Year Award\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself.\n\nI grew up in Adana and Istanbul, Turkey. I only spent six years of my life in Adana, but I really like my hometown for the same reasons I admire Los Angeles: weather, lifestyle, and food culture. I completed my high school and university studies in Istanbul; the astronautical engineering adventure started for me at Istanbul Technical University, where I got a better understanding about the field. Then I came to LA for USC’s astronautical engineering master’s program to gain greater knowledge and experience in the field. I got both from my courses and the lab that I joined during my master’s program, which is USC’s graduate student led Liquid Propulsion Laboratory (LPL) and had privilege became a co-lead. Now, I’m still one of the co-leads for LPL as I start my Ph.D. program in astronautical engineering.\n\nWhat sparked your interest in astronautical engineering?\n\nI really wanted to be an astronautical engineer when I was in high school. I was interested in science fiction books, especially the ones that included space travel. Reading about the possibilities of space travel gave me the feeling that I needed to help to develop human spaceflight in the real world. That’s why I studied astronautical engineering in my undergraduate and master’s programs — and currently I’m pursuing a Ph.D. focused on human spaceflight. I must add that I love every aspect of astronautical engineering — anything that goes to space or works in a space environment fascinates me.\n\nWhat attracted you to choose USC for your graduate studies?\n\nUSC Viterbi's astronautical engineering (ASTE) department is unique, as it combines both academic and industry level education in astronautical engineering. Most of our professors are somehow linked with the space industry, and that helps students to have a better understanding of the material they learn in class and how these theories work in the real world. That's why the USC Viterbi’s ASTE Department was my one and only choice for my master’s and Ph.D. programs.\n\nTell us about your interests outside the classroom.\n\nOne of my favorite activities is playing basketball; I’ve been playing for more than 15 years and here at USC I can play at the Lyon Center from time to time. Also, I need to say that I've been an Los Angeles Clippers fan for a long time — sorry Lakers! Besides basketball, as I said earlier, I am really into science fiction books, specifically related with outer space. The ancient history of the world interests me as well. I really like to watch documentaries on this topic.\n\nTell us about some exciting and unforgettable incidents from your time so far at USC.\n\nActually, my favorite USC memory is not in Los Angeles but in Mojave, California, where we ignited the USC LPL's Balerion Engine, which is a liquid rocket engine. That is the first time that I saw a rocket engine fire in person, which is something I’ve always wanted to see.\n\nIs there something that may surprise people about you?\n\nThis might not be that surprising, but I applied to only one university or program for each time I applied for my undergraduate, master’s and Ph.D. studies. For my career I always had a plan A and no other options, and it’s worked so far!\n\nWhat are your future plans after completing your degree?\n\nMy plan is to help to design, develop, and operate human spaceflight missions, deep space habitats (e.g. lunar bases), or human-rated vehicles. Since high school, I’ve wanted to be involved in these operations and help mankind reach new levels of space exploration.\n\nWhat innovations/discoveries do you hope to see or be a part of in the next ten years?\n\nI hope to see and be a part of creating a base on the Moon for the future of humanity. The Moon holds many advantages for future space operations (even going to Mars) and it is up to today’s people to start utilizing these benefits for a better future. Currently, with the Artemis Program, we have a high chance to see the initial steps of the base establishment in the next ten years.\n\n“Experience of working with people from diverse cultures at USC opens your mind”\n\nFor Amarnath Seshadri, University of Southern California (USC) was at the top of his list for Masters studies, given its superior research and innovation record in the field of engineering. After receiving an undergraduate degree in engineering from India, Seshadri worked at multinational information technology (IT) firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). During his three-year stint at TCS, he felt the need to broaden his knowledge and decided to pursue a Masters degree in Computer Science from USC’s Viterbi school of Engineering (2014 -2016).\n\nSince an early age, computers have piqued his interest. Underlying his curiosity to know more about computers is a desire to examine the impact of computers on our daily life and solving problems. “Especially, to see how they can replicate almost all of the real-life entities within such a small chip. At the end of the day, what matters is that we understand not only how they work but also how they can be used to improve our life,” he says. Seshadri was more inclined towards acquiring programming knowledge and experimented with them, while at USC. “While most students would listen to music when they are bored of coding, I would write small programming codes to get rid of my boredom,” he animatedly explains.\n\nDuring the second year of his program, Seshadri was a part of Viterbi Graduate Mentorship program where he guided and coached new graduate students to adjust to the life at USC and the city of Los Angeles. “Being an international student, it was a good opportunity to share my own experiences of adjusting to the life here, while mentoring the new students,” he says. Along with the opportunity to satiate his curiosity about computers, Seshadri says USC gave a chance to engage in a wide range of outdoor activities and explore the diverse culture of Los Angeles. Having keen interest in sports, especially cricket, he got involved with the USC’s Trojan cricket club and played a few matches. “I was a bowler in Cromwell champs team and played a tournament in spring 2016 where we finished as runners up.”\n\nWhile Seshadri appreciates the diverse culture and population at USC, for him, the highly concentrated Indian student population was a huge plus. “Because of this, I didn’t feel that I was far away from my home in India,” he says, adding that he also participated in events and festival celebrations organized by the university’s Hindu Students Organization (HSO) and Association of Indian Students (AIS).\n\nFor his summer internship in May 2015, Seshadri got an opportunity to intern at data-warehousing and business intelligence firm Teradata’s office in San Diego. The three-month internship widened his network and gave him a chance to apply the skills he learned at USC in the professional world. After completing his master’s degree, he joined as a senior research software developer for City of Hope, a renowned research and treatment centre for cancer and diabetes in Los Angeles. “The experience of working with people from diverse culturesat USC, opens your mind and has changed the way I look at problems, making me realize that one problem can be looked at through different angles.”\n\nAmarnath is: Curious, Adventure-seeking, Logical, Creative, Straighforward\n\nAmarnath’s Favorite...\n\nTV Show/Series: F.R.I.E.N.D.S.\n\nBook/Author: Harry Potter Series/JK Rowling\n\nHangout at USC: Cromwell track\n\nPrized possession: My Audi A4 which I fondly call 'paalpandi'\n\nThe one change that USC brought in me:Experience in USC Science film festival\n\nQuote/One-liner: “Try to learn something about everything and everything about something”- Thomas Henry Huxley.\n\nLA outing:Shatto 39\n\nSport/Activity: Badminton, Table tennis, Tennis, Golf, Cricket, and Pool\n\nStressbuster: Class of Clans game and watching Anime\n\n“USC gave me the opportunity to build myself and my dream career”\n\nFor many students, graduate school is a phase that defines their career choice. Ankit Singhaniya, however, describes his experience as “achieving the childhood dream job”. Growing up, Singhaniya was fascinated by computers and his dream – since then – was to work for California-based tech giant Google. “It was a dream to join Google but I never imagined myself to be capable. I never knew how I could reach this dream,” he says, looking back at his childhood.\n\nCut to the present day, Singhaniya is a software professional working for Google Search. Singhaniya credits the resources at USC and his own hard work for achieving his dream job. “It (USC) gave me the opportunity to build myself and my dream career.”\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate studies at National Institute of Technology(NIT) in Nagpur, India, Singhaniya worked for a year at American software major Oracle’s Bangalore office. Through chance meetings with his friends at Oracle, who had applied for graduate studies at University of Southern California (USC), he discovered USC and its prestigious engineering school – Viterbi. “I knew about western culture but I was a bit worried about taking a big step of moving away for so long. But when I attended the meet ups organized by the fellow USC students, it was relieving to know more about the college and the different perspectives,” he says.\n\nSinghaniya describes his first month at USC as an “eyeopener”. While pursuing his Master’s degree in Computer Science (2014-2016), he realized the scope and diversity of opportunities that USC offered him. “Before coming to USC, I was wondering about what to do and when Icame here, there was so much to do – so many different things to learn, an array of subjects to choose from and a diverse community of people to meet.”\n\nDuring his graduate studies, Singhaniya got the opportunity to intern for Google in the summer of 2015. “The idea was to get an experience in the global technology industry,” he says adding that the experience landed him a full-time job with the tech giant. The career services at USC and Viterbi, Singhaniya says, were also integral to his achieving the dream job. “They helped me with general application guidance and even reviewed my resume several times. The ease with which I could walk into their offices and get consultation, was something I could not get back in India,” he recalls. While at USC, he also participated in the festival celebrations and events hosted by the university’s Association of Indian Students (AIS).\n\nWhen asked what he missed the most about USC, Singhaniya’s immediate response is “the campus”. “You could sit there all day long and work, ideate, have entrepreneurial talks with the people around – all this adds different dimensions to your life,” he recounts and paints a mental picture of the two years that changed his life.\n\nAnkit is: Jolly, Optimistic, Independent, Hardworking, and Kind\n\nAnkit's Favorite...\n\nTV Show/Series: F.R.I.E.N.D.S.\n\nBook/Author: The Secret by Rhonda Byrne\n\nHangout at USC: Ground Zero Cafe, McCarthy Quad, and Grace Ford Salvatori Hall\n\nPrized possession: My father\n\nUSC Moment:Fridays at ICT (for research work)\n\nQuote/One-liner: Quote/One-liner: Challenge yourself everyday.

During his visit, he connected with USC professors and learnt more about the university and the research opportunities it provided. “I wanted to go to a prestigious school which invested a lot on research projects and USC, I knew, has a track record of funding and doing big research projects,” says West explaining his decision to pursue graduate studies at USC. A year later, he was a part of the USC’s Trojan family, studying Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Viterbi School of Engineering.\n\nBorn and raised in Ohio, West did his undergraduate at Ohio Northern University where he majored in Mechanical engineering. In 2012, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue higher studies and spent the next five years at USC. After getting a master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering (2012-2014), West then pursued a doctoral program in Mechanical Engineering (2014-2017) and earned his Ph.D. Apart from its reputation as a leading research university, West was drawn towards the emphasis placed by USC on its student population and resources for them. “The university invested heavily on student population. During my tenure at USC, they built several new academic buildings and even opened the USC Village which is beneficial for the students,” he says. For West, it was not just USC but its location too was a big draw. “Los Angeles is a big city with huge prospects. With USC having one of the highest international student population, it was easy to meet people from all the over world and learn about different cultures.”\n\nDuring his five years at USC, West also took on teaching and research assistantships along with his studies. In Spring 2016, he was a part of Viterbi Graduate Mentorship program where he guided and coached new graduate students to adjust to the life at USC and the city of Los Angeles. He also regularly participated in USC Grace on Campus, a weekly Bible study on campus.\n\nWest, who is currently working at the research and development wing of H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute in Tampa, Florida, reminisces the last five years and feels he made the right decision of choosing USC. “Looking back, I feel all my goals were achieved -- getting the degree, getting the job and I am where I wanted to be.” The one bond that West still shares with USC is being a part of the ‘Trojan’ family. “Wherever you go, it’s a bond that keeps all the students connected,” he proudly says.\n\nJeffrey’s Favorite...\n\nTV Show/Series: Love watching comedy (think Jerry Seinfield or Jimmy Fallon)\n\nBook/Author: Reading the Bible Supernaturally by John Piper\n\nHangout at USC: Spudnuts Donuts\n\nPrized possession: My guitar\n\nUSC Moment:Best USC moment is receiving my PhD!

From being a senator for the department’s graduate student association to trying his hand at sailing, fencing and mixed martial arts (MMA), Sauder got the best of several worlds.\n\n“As a graduate student, I could get involved in additional classes and activities beyond the typical engineering course work,” he says. In deciding to pursue his PhD, Sauder was drawn to USC for its attractive fellowship program and that the university was set in the dynamic city of Los Angeles. For him, USC was the best chance to work with a faculty advisor in a topic he was interested in and gain access to networking opportunities that could shape his future.\n\nDuring his four years of study at USC (2009-2013), Sauder utilized the university’s resources and facilities in the best possible way. “The main thing is what is available beyond the classes – clubs or organizations – really give you a much broader experience in your time at USC,” he says. For instance, he explains how the USC career service played an integral role in polishing his resume and making him ready for the professional world. He even took a special effects class at the university’s film school (Cinematic Arts) to understand the mechanics of special effects and camera tricks.\n\nSauder, who is currently working as a Mechatronics Engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Los Angeles, says USC influenced his approach towards engineering problems and solving them. This helped him crack interviews and landed him summer internship opportunities at Mattel and Microsoft and got him job offers from Intel, Mattel, JPL and Apple post his PhD.\n\nTrue to his idea of maximizing the experience at USC, Sauder did much more than just engineering. Six years have passed and he can vividly describe every detail of his 2011 sailing trip to Catalina that he took as a part of the additional class he enrolled at USC’s Nautical Science program. Sauder, along with six other students from the university’s graduate and undergraduate school, took the sailing trip where they learned navigation and sighting locations using just a compass. “Imagine having no GPS and finding locations on a physical map using just a compass,” says Sauder as he animatedly explains the trip. “I had the chance to meet students from across different departments of USC – something I wouldn’t have done in my day to day classes.”\n\nLiving in the heart of Los Angeles, Sauder even got a chance to volunteer as a member of the Mt Baldy ski patrol where he was trained in wilderness medicine to help injured skiers. “Not many universities have nice weather in the immediate vicinity where you can also be at a ski slope within an hour. The fun thing about USC was I could switch seasons so quickly – I would be in shorts and t-shirts in the morning and within few hours would head up for volunteer work and get bundled up, head to toe, in a thick jacket and snow pants,” he explains while reminiscing his volunteer experience.\n\nSauder still maintains his ties with the USC and now teaches a subject in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the university’s Viterbi School of Engineering.\n\nJonathan is: Innovative, Hands-on, Resourceful, Enthusiastic, MacGyver\n\nJonathan's Favo"
