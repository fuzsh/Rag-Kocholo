        "text": "Updated October 2023\n\nPB100: Re-Booting the Fly Baby\n\nBowersFlyBaby.com\n\nThe Unofficial Fly Baby Home Page\n\nMaintained by Ron Wanttaja (ron@wanttaja.com)\n\nThis web page is for those interested in the Bowers Fly Baby homebuilt aircraft. This page is for information only, and is not affiliated with the owner of the rights to the Flybaby design.\n\nWhat's New?\n\nFacebook Page\n\nGeneral Information\n\nThis section discusses general aspects of the Fly Baby design. Contents:\n\nWhy a Fly Baby?\n\nDescription and Specifications\n\nWood and Welded Parts Suppliers\n\nSome Real-World Performance Numbers\n\nEngines\n\nCost Estimates\n\nResults of the Builder Survey\n\nDownloading the Free Plans\n\nWhy a Fly Baby?\n\nFace it. You can page through the Aerocrafter Guide , or pick your way through the KITPLANES December issue, and find a lot of homebuilts that are faster, sleeker, and newer than the Fly Baby.\n\nWhy not build one of them, instead of a 40-year-old-design?\n\nThe answer lies in your own flying habits.\n\nWhy do you want an airplane? Will you be making regular trips for long distances? Carrying passengers? Blasting up to high altitudes?\n\nOr are you just looking for a fun, knockaround airplane? Something that doesn't cost much to own? Something that you can go sightseeing in without breaking the bank on fuel costs. Something more substantial than an ultralight or ultralight-based design.\n\nTake an honest look at the way you fly an airplane now. Do you just make \"Hundred Dollar Hamburger\" runs on the weekends? Do you fly just for the joy of flight? Do you generally go by yourself?\n\nThen maybe...MAYBE...a Fly Baby might be the plane for you.\n\nThey're cheap as dirt to operate. Our EAA Chapter operated Pete Bowers' prototype as a club airplane from 1987 to 1994. Rarely did our yearly maintenance bill exceed $100. That's not a typo... One Hundred Dollars. Even today, my airplane costs me, generally, less than $500 a year in maintenance. Including hiring an A&P for the yearly condition inspection.\n\nThe major drawback: Fly Babies don't come in kits. You carve every piece of wood; bend every bit of metal. Yet the Fly Baby is designed to be as simple as possible to build. EAA Judges rate aircraft at Fly-Ins, not only on how well the builder did, but on how difficult the airplane was to build. The Fly Baby has ALWAYS occupied the \"easiest\" category...even in today's modern kit era. They go together like a big balsa-wood model. You don't even have to build-up ribs like most wood homebuilts. Instead, you stack up sheets of plywood and \"gang-saw\" them all at once on a bandsaw.\n\nBy not buying a kit, you save tons of money. Even today, one can probably build a Fly Baby (less engine) for $6,000 or less. Even though it doesn't come as a kit, a lot of the major parts (fuel tanks, engine mounts) come from the J-3 Cub, and companies like Wag-Aero and Univair still sell these parts.\n\nIt's not \"Tab A into Slot B\" kitbuilding. But the Fly Baby was the seminal EAA project; it was the first (and so far, only) design ever to win an EAA design competition. EAA essentially cut its teeth on Fly Babies. If you need help building one, assistance is as close as your nearest EAA Technical Counselor.\n\nReturn to Main Menu\n\nDescription and Specifications\n\nThe Fly Baby is a single-seat, open cockpit, folding-wing monoplane powered by engines ranging from 65 to 100 HP. It was originally designed in 1960 to compete in the first (and so far, only EAA design competition). It is built primarily of wood, with fabric covering. Most are powered by Continental A-65, C-75, C-85, or O-200 engines. Performance is sprightly; a bit better than that of, say, an Aeronca Champ.\n\nWhile a single-seat airplane, the Fly Baby isn't small. It has a wingspan just two feet less than a Cessna 150. It's got a big cockpit. Pete Bowers is six feet two inches tall, and I weigh about 250 pounds. That gives you an idea of the range of sizes that can be accommodated.\n\nThe Fly Baby can be built as a biplane as well as a monoplane. The two monoplane wing panels are replaced by four smaller ones, plus a center section for the top wing. The aircraft can be switched back and forth between versions in about an hour, but it does take a helper. The biplane, while cool in concept, doesn't really offer too much. It's slower, and the wings don't fold. Still, its swept-back upper wings make it look a bit like a Bucker or Tiger Moth in the air, so if you'd really rather have a biplane, the Fly Baby would do the trick.\n\nThe monoplane/biplane issue is more than a wing swap...there are some internal braces and external tangs that have to be added to the fuselage. You can do this once the fuselage is done (The prototype was converted after completion), but it is, of course, easier during construction.\n\nSwitching back and forth between the wings takes two people about an hour. This assumes the rigging has already been set. While I helped on a wing swap, I never flew the biplane version. Other than appearances, there isn't much advantage. It's slower, and glides at an even steeper angle.\n\nIn monoplane or biplane configuration, the Fly Baby does meet the US rules for Sport Pilot. In the United States, you do not need an FAA medical to fly a Fly Baby.\n\nWith the plans off the market, building a biplane is difficult. However, you might be able to buy a used set of plans. In any case, my advice is to build a monoplane first, to have something to fly, and build the biplane wings in your spare time after the first flight. The biplane wings take longer to build, since there are four panels and a center section, and they're swept rather than straight. If you build the monoplane wings first, you'll have something to fly while building the extra wings.\n\nReturn to Main Menu\n\nSome Real-World Performance Numbers\n\nHoward Jones from Perth, Australia, was involved with the completion of an O-200 powered Fly Baby, and sent along the following performance figures. Note that this is with a 100 horsepower engine. These were the measured results from a field at 50 foot elevation during a 68-degree (F) day, with no wind:\n\nDistance of ground run 265 feet/81 metres\n\nlift off to 50' 450 feet/137 metres\n\ntotal distance 715 feet/218 metres\n\nadd 30% safety factor = 925 feet/283 metres Take off Distance\n\nSpeed at 50ft 57 MPH/50 KIAS\n\n50' to touchdown 640 feet/196 metres\n\nground roll 660 feet/201 metres (moderate braking)\n\nadd 30% safety factor = 1700 feet 516 metres recommended landing distance.\n\nSuggested minimum runway distance for this aircraft:\n\n1975 feet/600 metres.\n\n[RJW Note: This seems reasonable. A 2,000 foot runway is pretty much my threshold of \"pucker factor\". I've landed in shorter fields, but they take good concentration. If you've got unobstructed approaches, the 660-foot ground roll is definitely doable.]\n\nBest rate of climb speed 57 MPH/50 knots IAS\n\nrecommended 69 MPH/60 Knots IAS\n\nTakeoff safety speed 63 MPH/55 Knots IAS\n\n[RJW Note: The best rate speed seems a bit slow. I've been using 65 MPH for best rate, but haven't actually run a flight test on it. I like the extra speed buffer over stall.]\n\nMaximum level speed 112 MPH/97 knots IAS\n\nmaximum climb rate 1300 ft per minute at 50 KIAS\n\nnormal climb rate 1000 ft per minute at 60 KIAS\n\n[RJW Note: Don't forget, these figures are with a 100 HP engine!]\n\nReturn to Main Menu\n\nEngines\n\nBowers recommends Continentals between 65 and 85 horsepower. The biggest engine I've heard of is a Lycoming O-290 (~125 HP). The 'Baby isn't a fast airplane by any stretch of the imagination, so bigger engines don't really buy you much. You're better off with the lighter weight (and lower fuel burn) of the little Continentals.\n\nOn the subject of the Continentals, both 'Babies I've flown have been powered by the C-85. I've formated on A-65 powered versions. The performance difference was marked, especially considering I was heavier than the pilots flying the 65 HP versions. Tom Staples has replaced his A-65 with a C-85, and his daughter reports that his cruise went from 80 to 95 MPH and his rate of climb from 500 to 1000 FPM!\n\nOther Engines\n\nThere's no reason at all you couldn't fly a Fly Baby on a Rotax 532 or 582. These engines are considerably lighter than the Continentals, though, so you'll need a longer engine mount for CG. Might look a bit goofy. These two engines are only 65 HP, though.\n\nVolkswagens are too anemic. Draggy airplanes need large propellers, and your typical VW ends up with a little 42\" toothpick to be able to turn the 3400 RPM where it produces 65 HP. VW-powered 'Babies have flown, but the owners soon convert them to Continentals.\n\nAn Rotax 912 (four cylinder four stroke) would be ideal, if you've got the $$$$$ to buy one.\n\nPersonally, I'm somewhat taken by some of the smaller auto-engine conversions. I've met the designer of the Stratus Subaru conversion a number of times, and think the engine has excellent possibilities as a Fly Baby powerplant.\n\nAn examination of Fly Baby engine options can be found on the Engines page.\n\nReturn to Main Menu\n\nPlans\n\nWhen Pete Bowers passed away, he left his entire collection to Seattle's Museum of Flight. It included a set of original plans from 1965.\n\nThe Museum has scanned in the plans, and they are available for free download. You can read them online, or click the \"download\" button. Be advised, the file is over 100 megs in size, so it'll take a bit to download.\n\nOld version of the plans? Not to worry...back in 2004, Wolfgang Dertnig put together a list of plans changes over the years.\n\nPlus... The 1965 edition of the plans is almost identical to the EAA magazine articles, which means the PB100 material dove-tails in, nicely.\n\nSuppliers\n\nHere's a list of suppliers that carry Fly Baby-specific sort of parts. This doesn't constitute an endorsement; this isn't an \"approved\" list. But they might be good starting point. The customer must make his or her own decision as to the airworthiness and value of the items mentioned.\n\nThose who like to get an idea of the total order size required can check out this attempt at a representative materials list. It's in Microsoft Excel format.\n\nAircraft Spruce and Specialty sells practically all the individual components, and Materials Kits to provide all the raw materials.\n\nWicks Aircraft is a well-liked supplier of a wide variety of homebuilding materials. They also have Materials Kits.\n\nSome Wood Sources:\n\nB&D Plywood, in Tacoma, Washington is a good source for plywood.\n\nChesapeake Light Craft sells boat kits, but supposedly has some of the lowest wood prices around\n\nBoulter Plywood is located near Boston, and is recommended by one of our New England builders.\n\nProbably the best source of Fly Baby goodies are unfinished projects and Fly Markets. There are still a number of unfinished projects out there...I once called on one that was essentially complete, less engine. The owner wanted only $1,000 for it.\n\nAlso Available: Downloads/Reprints of The Fly Baby Bulletin\n\nBack in the late '60s, Hayden Ferguson published a newsletter for Fly Baby builders. Hayden has kindly provided me with a clean copy of all the newsletters, and permission to reprint them.\n\nThis are of pretty good interest to Fly Baby builders. There are a number of hints and suggestions, and a total of 200 pages (printed double-sided, so there are only 100 sheets). Be advised there is an equal amount of \"What Joe Smith is working on now\" sort of information...vital and informative when the newsletter is mailed out, but of less use to builders thirty years later. It's fun to read, though.\n\nSteve Pitts took the old Bulletins and converted them to Adobe Acrobat format (.PDF). You can now download them for free. Also, I've still got a few hard copies left, if you would prefer. I'm selling these for $20, US Postage paid. Email me for ordering information.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nBuilding Cost (Updated Sept 2006)\n\nOne of the main reasons the Fly Baby was so popular in the 1960s is its low-cost construction. Back then, aircraft-quality wood was still in wide production, and huge stocks of aircraft hardware (like turnbuckles) had been produced during the war and were still being sold at low prices.\n\nUnfortunately, in the 45 years since, things have changed. It used to be that wood was cheap but alumimum was expensive; that's no longer the case. The surplus turnbuckles are long gone, and the new production stuff is quite a bit costlier.\n\nIn September, 2006, Dirk Chubbic of San Jose, California, took the bull by the horns:\n\n\"I got my Aircraft Spruce and Specialty catalogue recently and spent some time pricing FB construction. I started with the materials list from Ron's site and plugged in prices from AS&S, using the lowest prices when a choice was necessary (e.g. cad plated vs. stainless bolts).\n\n\"The total was about $8,125.\n\n\"Of course, that doesn't include engine, fuel tank/lines, prop, instruments, covering, paint or even glue. It's just the airframe and fittings. Of course, a good scrounge/bargan hunter can do it for less, but I think that's a good benchmark, just in case somebody asks.\"\n\nSince the Fly Baby is plans-built (e.g., no complete kit) the cost of construction varies from builder to builder. Some folks opt for all new hardware, some haunt the Fly Markets for good deals. As Dirk says, his pricing assumes new parts (albeit the lowest-cost new parts) exclusively. If you scrounge, or buy partially-completed aircraft, you can do a lot better.\n\nThe price can go higher, too.. If you decide to add stuff like an electrical system, radios, and a transponder, you'll add quite a bit to the cost of the airframe.\n\nAs far as engines go, check Trade-A-Plane for prices. A good C-85 will probably run ~$3,000-$4,000. A run-out will go for quite a bit less, and you can overhaul it yourself. A wood prop will run $600 or so.\n\nOperating Costs\n\nFly Babies are very cheap to run. My C-85 burns ~5 gallons an hour of $5.00/gallon car gas. That's $25 an hour, plus a bit more for oil. Hangar costs vary widely, but you can probably get your Fly Baby under cover for ~$300 or less per month. Don't tie the plane outside for long periods--it isn't good for it.\n\nLiability insurance (only) costs about $300/year.\n\nReturn to Main Menu\n\nLinks to other Web Pages on Fly Babies and Fly Baby-Like homebuilts:\n\nWhile Robert S. Hoover wasn't building a Fly Baby, he was a champion of those who want to build low-cost wooden airplanes. He'd written numerous articles on the subject.

Someone pointed out I hadn't updated the page for nearly an entire year! In the last year, I've given over a dozen presentations on several subjects (including the Fly Baby, of course!) and haven't really wanted to face my computer sometimes.\n\nEAA Chapter 818 actually videoed my Fly Baby presentation, and it's online!\n\nBiggest news is the addition of the Dale Weir photo collection. Dale, as a 14-year-old, was handed Pete's camera and plopped into the back seat of a J-3 to photograph Pete in the Fly Baby prototype in flight. Some fantastic pictures came out of that, not just of the Fly Baby on the ground. I'm tickled pink Dale let me scan in these photos...some of them we've seen before, but never in this level of sharpness and detail.\n\nTen new stories!\n\nAlso, I added a new Index section for stories about other Fly Baby owners.\n\n10 November 2022\n\nMy policy is to disseminate any safety information about Fly Babies, good or bad. A long-time member of the Fly Baby community sent me this report covering his concerns about the wing bracing.\n\nYeah! The 2023 Fly Baby calendar is out.\n\nSpeaking of wing bracing, I replaced my flying wires this summer.\n\nI had the carb heat control knob drop on on my airplane. See how I fixed it.\n\n10 February 2022\n\nYeee-HAW! When Pete Bowers passed away, he left his entire collection to Seattle's Museum of Flight. It included a set of original plans from 1965. The Museum has scanned in the plans, and they are available for free download. You can read them online, or click the \"download\" button. Be advised, the file is over 100 megs in size, so it'll take a bit to download.\n\nOld version of the plans? Not to worry...back in 2004, Wolfgang Dertnig put together a list of plans changes over the years.\n\nPlus... The 1965 edition of the plans is almost identical to the EAA magazine articles, which means the PB100 material dove-tails in, nicely.\n\nBetween the Museum of Flight's file, and the PB100 material, builders will have all the information they need.\n\nFor free.\n\nNeedless to say, the Fly Baby community is ecstatic over this.....\n\n7 December 2021\n\nStarting out with a great picture of Ian Cameron's Fly Baby. The shot was taken by his friend, Don Lewis.\n\nThe 2022 Calendar is up!\n\nI've been remiss in adding picture of newly-completed Fly Babies and a few of older airplanes that have turned up. They're on the 12th sheet of the Photo Section.\n\nThree new stories! A nice fall flight to a local landmark, a short treatise on paying attention, and a little bit about the Fly Baby's black sheep relative.\n\nAnd... a bit more information on seats.\n\n28 September 2021\n\nAdded a great pilot report by Iain MacDonald.\n\n26 September 2021\n\nLeadoff photo is an atmospheric winter shot from Hans Teijgeler.\n\nI was shocked to discover that I hadn't added pictures of Jim Katz's newly-completed Fly Baby to the web page.\n\nThis should serve as a reminder to both y'all and me: I want to include EVERYONE'S Fly Baby on the pictures pages. If your plane isn't there, send me some good photos and I'll add them. Even if it's a Fly Baby you used to own, I'll add it.\n\nFour stories added, as well.\n\n10 May 2021\n\nWith the pandemic, some folks were concerned that I hadn't updated the page for a while. All's well here; it's just that with the reduction in travel, me and the Fly Baby aren't getting out to new places and new adventures.\n\nA couple of things folks might find interesting:\n\nThe leadoff picture is NOT a Fly Baby; it's Pete's other design, the two-seat \"Namu II.\" I've done some research and collected as much information as I can. No, I haven't found any plans for it. Don't ask.\n\nOver the years, I've struggled with my Fly Baby's Delco generator and regulator. I finally got fed up, and replaced it with a B&C alternator and voltage controller. Went pretty smooth, with just a few glitches.\n\nAlso, whether or not a post a notice here, I do update the Fly Baby calendar every year. I do notify the folks on the mailing list and the Facebook page.\n\n12 August 2020\n\nThe airplane on the front this time is Jim Katz's N502F...which, as you can see, has a paint job identical to that of the original prototype.\n\nStill in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Fly Baby owners are prepared, though....\n\nBiggest news this time is that a man in British Columbia is offering add-on starter kits for A65s. Price for a ready-to-bolt-on unit is about $1100 US.\n\nBunch of new stories, too.\n\n13 January 2020\n\nAdded a write-up on the legal issues and options regarding ADS-B Out in a Fly Baby.\n\n16 December 2019\n\nThe Yahoo Groups function has been pared way back, so we've changed the email list to Groups.io.\n\n12 November 2019\n\nThe Fly Baby is the famous winner of the 1962 EAA contest, but is it the Pretender to the Throne?\n\nI've written a lot about how to stay warm while flying a Fly Baby, now here's the ultimate Guide to Open Cockpit Comfort.\n\nI pick up some Remedial Education.\n\nA guy wanted to know just how to build a low-profile headset like I use on my Fly Baby, but the original write-up had a lot of extranous material. I put together a Condensed Version to make it easier.\n\nThe belly panel makes it easy to access the bottom of the cockpit from under the airplane, but it makes maintenance access easier from above, as well.\n\nWeird noises in any vehicle, airplane, car, whater, bug the heck out of me. Ban the Bonk is about chasing down one such.....\n\nPB100 is essentially complete. I've got Guides written for the first 11 of 14 EAA articles. The last two are on fabric covering, and the other is on assembly. The EAA magazine article covers assembly pretty well, and the covering information is pretty much out of date. I may try to put something together on these in the future, but it won't be soon.\n\nBack in the '60s, aviation artist Bob Parks worked with Pete Bowers at Boeing. Parks did a great large-scale drawing of a Radio Controlled Fly Baby.\n\nThe 2020 Calendar is out!"
