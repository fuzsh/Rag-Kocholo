        "text": "Carbohydrates, or carbs, are the sugars, starches, and dietary fiber that occur in certain foods. The body breaks them down into glucose, which provides energy for bodily functions.\n\nCarbohydrates are mainly found in plant foods. They also occur in dairy products in the form of a milk sugar called lactose. Foods high in carbohydrates include bread, pasta, beans, potatoes, rice, and cereals.\n\nCarbohydrates play several roles in living organisms, including providing energy.\n\nByproducts of carbohydrates are involved in the immune system, the development of disease, blood clotting, and reproduction.\n\nThis article looks at types of carbohydrates, nutrition, and their effects on health. We also look at the relationship between carbohydrates and diabetes.\n\nCarbohydrates, also known as saccharides or carbs, provide energy for the body. Each gram of carbohydrates provides 4 calories.\n\nThe body breaks carbohydrates down into glucose, which is the primary energy source for the brain and muscles.\n\nCarbohydrates are one of three macronutrients, which are nutrients that the body needs in larger amounts.\n\nThe other macronutrients are protein and fats. Proteins provide 4 calories per gram, and fats provide 9 calories per gram.\n\nIt’s generally recommended that people consume between 45-65% of their total calories in the form of carbohydrates per day. However, carbohydrate needs depend on many factors, including body size, activity levels, and blood sugar control.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend that people get 275 g of carbohydrate each day in a 2,000-calorie diet. This includes dietary fiber, total sugars, and added sugars, which are listed on food labels.\n\nCarbohydrates in foods occur in various forms, including the following:\n\nDietary fiber, a type of carbohydrate that the body cannot easily digest. It occurs naturally in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains.\n\nTotal sugars, which include sugars that occur naturally in foods, such as dairy products, as well as added sugars, which are common in baked goods, sweets, and desserts. The body very easily digests and absorbs sugars.\n\nSugar alcohols, a type of carbohydrate that the body does not fully absorb. They have a sweet taste and fewer calories than sugar. Sugar alcohols are added to foods as reduced-calorie sweeteners, such as in chewing gum, baked goods, and sweets.\n\nDietary fiber helps promote regular bowel movements, lowers blood sugar and cholesterol, and may help reduce a person’s calorie intake. The FDA recommend that people get 28 g of dietary fiber per day in a 2,000-calorie diet.\n\nMost people in the United States exceed the recommended daily limits for added sugar. This can increase a person’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease and dental cavities. Guidelines recommend that people get less than 10% of their total daily calories from added sugars, meaning less than 200 calories of added sugars each day.\n\nHowever, limiting added sugar as much as possible is best for overall health. The American Heart Association recommend that those assigned female at birth (AFAB) limit added sugar to less than 6 teaspoons (25 g) per day and those assigned male at birth (AMAB) limit their intake to less than 9 teaspoons (36 g) per day.\n\nThe chemical structures of carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Two basic compounds make up carbohydrates: Aldehydes, which are double-bonded carbon and oxygen atoms, plus a hydrogen atom, and ketones, which are double-bonded carbon and oxygen atoms, plus two additional carbon atoms.\n\nCarbohydrates can combine to form polymers, or chains, to create different types of carbohydrates.\n\nMonosaccharides\n\nMonosaccharides are single units of sugar. Examples include:\n\nglucose, the body’s main source of energy\n\ngalactose, which is most readily available in milk and dairy products\n\nfructose, which mostly occurs in fruits and vegetables\n\nDisaccharides\n\nDisaccharides are two sugar molecules joined together. Examples include:\n\nlactose, found in milk, which is made up of glucose and galactose\n\nsucrose, or table sugar, which is made up of glucose and fructose\n\nPolysaccharides\n\nPolysaccharides are chains of many sugars. They can consist of hundreds or thousands of monosaccharides. When describing a carb that contains 3–10 monosaccharides, health experts may refer to it as an oligosaccharide. Polysaccharides act as food stores for plants and animals. Examples include:\n\nglycogen, which stores energy in the liver and muscles\n\nstarches, which are abundant in potatoes, rice, and wheat\n\ncellulose, one of the main structural components of plants\n\nHealth experts may refer to two types of carbs: simple and complex. Monosaccharides and disaccharides are simple carbohydrates, and polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates.\n\nSimple carbohydrates are sugars. They consist of just one or two molecules. They provide a rapid source of energy, but the person soon feels hungry again. Examples include white bread, sugars, and candies.\n\nComplex carbohydrates consist of long chains of sugar molecules. This includes whole grains and foods that contain fiber. Examples include fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grain pasta.\n\nComplex carbohydrates make a person feel full for longer and have more health benefits than simple carbohydrates, as they contain more vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\n\nRead on to learn more about simple and complex carbohydrates.\n\nIn a typical diet, carbohydrates are the main energy source for the body. The body uses them as fuel for the cells.\n\nMany people have turned to low carb diets, such as the keto diet, for their potential health benefits and weight loss. However, some types of carbohydrates – including whole grains and dietary fiber – have substantial health benefits.\n\nIn fact, according to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, those who eat the most carbohydrates – especially from natural sources such as beans, whole grains, and vegetables — have a lower risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and heart disease.\n\nMany foods high in carbohydrates, such as beans, whole grains, and vegetables, are also rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. These foods may relate to a lower risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and heart disease.\n\nOther types of carbohydrates, including simple carbohydrates such as white bread, have much lower nutritional value.\n\nAdded sugars are a type of carbohydrate that can have adverse health effects. Eating large amounts of foods that contain added sugars can contribute to obesity, T2DM, and cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhen making dietary changes, it is important to aim for a healthful diet that contains the range of nutrients that the body needs. A person can discuss dietary changes with a dietitian.\n\nCarbohydrates and obesity\n\nSome argue that the global rise in obesity may relate to a high intake of carbs. However, a number of factors contribute to rising obesity rates, including:\n\nlower physical activity levels\n\ngreater availability of ultraprocessed food or “junk food”\n\na lack of access to affordable fresh produce\n\noversized portions, which increase a person’s calorie intake\n\nfewer hours of sleep\n\ngenetic factors\n\nstress and emotional factors\n\nWhat about diet foods?\n\nMany manufacturers promote low carb diets to sell weight loss products, including nutritional bars and powders.\n\nHowever, these products are not often as healthful as they suggest. It is advisable for a person to check the ingredients label of any product, whether it is a diet food or not, and see if it fits into their dietary plan. Nutritional bars and similar products can be convenient, but they are not superior to whole foods.\n\nAfter a meal, the body breaks carbohydrates down into glucose, causing blood sugar levels to increase. This causes the pancreas to produce insulin, a hormone that allows the body’s cells to use this sugar for energy or storage.\n\nOver time, repeated spikes in blood sugar levels can damage the cells that make insulin, wearing them out. Eventually, the body may stop producing insulin, or may not be able to use it properly. This is known as insulin resistance.\n\nEating carbohydrates or sugars alone does not cause diabetes. Carbohydrates are an important source of nutrients in most diets. However, people are more likely to have insulin resistance and develop T2DM if they have overweight or obesity, which can be linked with a diet high in sugar.\n\nInsulin resistance increases the risk of developing metabolic syndrome, which refers to a group of risk factors that raise the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other medical conditions.\n\nIf a person has elevated blood sugar levels, reducing their intake of added sugar and refined carbohydrates can help reduce their blood sugar levels, improve insulin resistance, and may help promote healthy weight loss if needed.\n\nReducing the risk\n\nPeople can reduce their risk of insulin resistance by eating healthful carbohydrates, maintaining good sleeping habits, and exercising regularly.\n\nHealthful carbohydrates include fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and some cereals. These foods contain essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and key phytonutrients.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet has a moderate amount of carbohydrates from mostly whole food sources plus some animal or fish protein. This diet relates to a lower risk of developing T2DM.\n\nThe glycemic index (GI) ranks how quickly a food raises blood sugar levels on a scale of 0 to 100.\n\nFoods with a high GI cause rapid spikes in blood sugar. Foods with a low GI take longer for the body to digest, leading to more balanced blood sugar levels.\n\nEating lots of foods with a high GI may increase a person’s risk for T2DM and other health concerns, including heart disease and certain cancers.\n\nA diet with plenty of low GI foods, together with exercise and regular sleep, may help a person maintain health and a moderate weight.\n\nLow GI diet\n\nOne factor that increases the GI score of a food is the milling and grinding process, which often leaves no more than the starchy endosperm, or the inner part, of the seed or grain. This is mainly starch.\n\nThis process also eliminates other nutrients, such as minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibers.\n\nTo follow a low GI diet, a person can eat more unrefined foods, such as:\n\noats, barley, or bran\n\nwhole-grain bread\n\nbrown rice\n\nplenty of fresh fruit and vegetables\n\nfresh, whole fruit instead of juice\n\nwhole-grain pasta\n\nsalads and raw vegetables\n\nSome FAQs about carbohydrates may include:\n\nWhich foods are carbohydrates?\n\nCarbohydrates generally refer to foods containing a lot of sugar that the body can break down to release energy. Examples include whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and beans.\n\nWhat are carbohydrate foods to avoid?\n\nSome health experts may describe certain carbohydrates as being less healthy than others. It may be advisable to try and limit or reduce these carbs. Examples can include white bread, pastries, sodas, and other highly processed or refined foods.\n\nWhat does carbohydrates do for your body?\n\nCarbohydrates are a macronutrient that provide the body with glucose. The body is able to convert this sugar into energy that supports bodily functions and physical activity.\n\nRead on to learn more about what carbohydrates do.\n\nCarbohydrates are an important source of energy for the body. Some types are more healthful than others. For instance, dietary fiber is a carbohydrate that protects heart and gut health, whereas added sugars can lead to an increased risk of T2DM, heart disease, and overweight.\n\nFollowing a well-balanced diet that includes unprocessed carbohydrates, and getting enough sleep and physical activity, are more likely to lead to good health and a healthful body weight than focusing on or eliminating a particular nutrient."
