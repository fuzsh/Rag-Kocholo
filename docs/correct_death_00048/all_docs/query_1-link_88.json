        "text": "Commander-in-Chief of the German Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring did indeed have important Swedish connections. In the early 1920s, he was living in Stockholm and working for the Swedish airline, Svenska Lufttrafik. He was hired for a private flight by Count Eric von Rosen, a well-known pro-Nazi figure in Swedish society. It was on that trip that Göring met the Count’s beautiful sister-in-law, Stockholm-born Carin von Kantzow. She was already married, but for Hermann, it was love at first sight. By 1923, Carin had obtained a divorce and went to Munich to wed the handsome, younger Hermann. Together they dreamed of a “Greater Germany.”\n\nThere were problems, however. In 1925, Hermann was admitted to Långbro Swedish asylum for morphine addiction, an aftereffect of the pain medication administered for various injuries. Six years later, Carin was in Sweden for her mother’s funeral when she had a heart attack. Death came soon afterward.\n\nGöring never forgot Carin. In fact, in her honor, he built an elaborate estate in eastern Germany and named it Carinhall. As the war progressed, the Soviets approaching Berlin, Carinhall was destroyed.At Nuremberg, Göring was found guilty\n\nAt Nuremberg, Göring was sentenced to death by hanging. The night before his scheduled execution, he committed suicide with a cyanide capsule.\n\nShare this Post"
