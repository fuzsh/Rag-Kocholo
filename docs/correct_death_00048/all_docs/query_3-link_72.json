        "text": "As commander of the German Luftwaffe and second only to Hitler in the Nazi Party, Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering amassed both political power and a vast collection of confiscated artwork.\n\nBeyond the Dreams of Avarice: The Hermann Goering Collection by Nancy H. Yeide, is the first study devoted to Goering s entire paintings collection, providing the only opportunity to look at the collection as a whole and evaluate its place within art collecting and the history of Nazi looting. This carefully documented catalogue, painstakingly assembled from archival documents identified as primary to the Goering collection, is critical to the clarification of provenances of the objects and brings to light information about paintings whose histories and whereabouts have been hidden for decades.\n\nA culmination of seven years of research by Ms. Yeide, an internationally recognized expert in World War II-era provenance research and co-author of The AAM Guide to Provenance Research which helped define provenance research standards in the United States, this volume is a must for collectors, art dealers, auction houses, researchers, curators, art historians and other scholars. Includes an introduction by Robert M. Edsel, author of The Monuments Men."
