        "text": "January 12, 1893\n\nHermann Göring is born in Marienbad, in the German state of Bavaria.\n\n1905–1911\n\nGöring attends military academy.\n\n1915–1918\n\nGöring serves in the German air force as a fighter pilot. Both wounded and decorated, by the end of the war, he is one of the best-known German air force war heroes.\n\nSummer 1921\n\nGöring begins university studies in history and political science in Munich.\n\nNovember 1922\n\nGöring meets Adolf Hitler at a Nazi Party rally and will subsequently join the Nazi Party.\n\nNovember 9, 1923\n\nGöring marches with Hitler during the Beer Hall Putsch against the German government. He is seriously wounded in the hip during the putsch.\n\n1923–1927\n\nGöring's wife, Carin, smuggles the wounded Göring out of Germany via Austria to Italy. In 1925, Göring and his wife go to Sweden to live with her family. After the German government declares a general amnesty for political refugees in 1927, Göring will return to Germany.\n\n1928\n\nGöring becomes one of 11 Nazis to obtain a parliamentary seat in the Reichstag (German Parliament) after the Nazis receive 2.6% of the vote in the parliamentary elections.\n\nSeptember 1930\n\nHitler appoints Göring as his political representative in Berlin, choosing him to lead the Nazi Party Reichstag delegation.\n\nOctober 1931\n\nGöring's wife, Carin, dies of a heart attack.\n\nJuly 1932\n\nGöring becomes president of the Reichstag after the second Nazi electoral surge makes the Nazi Party the largest in Germany.\n\nJanuary 1933\n\nThe Nazis obtain control of the German state with the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor.\n\nGöring receives a cabinet post (Minister without Portfolio) in the Nazi-Nationalist coalition government). Göring is also appointed acting commissar for the Prussian Ministry of the Interior.\n\nFebruary 1933\n\nGöring authorizes the appointment of SA (Sturmabteilungen; Assault Detachments) and SS (Schutzstaffel; Protection Squadrons) personnel as auxiliary police personnel.\n\nApril 11, 1933\n\nGöring persuades Hitler to confirm him as permanent Minister-President and Minister of the Interior of Prussia.\n\nApril 26, 1933\n\nGöring announces the formation of the Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei; Secret State Police).\n\nMay 5, 1933\n\nHitler appoints Göring Reich Minister for Aviation.\n\nApril 1934\n\nGöring negotiates an alliance with Reichsführer-SS (SS chief) Heinrich Himmler. Göring gives up control over the Gestapo and supports SS independence from the SA in July 1934, in return for SS help in removing SA chief of staff Ernst Röhm.\n\nMay 1934\n\nThe Prussian Ministry of the Interior is incorporated into the Reich Ministry of the Interior.\n\nDecember 1934\n\nA secret Hitler decree secures Göring's position as successor to Hitler in the event of Hitler's death or inability to carry out his duties.\n\nMarch 1935\n\nGöring becomes commander-in-chief of the new German Air Force (Luftwaffe). Göring will hold this position until April 29, 1945.\n\nApril 10, 1935\n\nGöring marries the theater actress Emmy Sonnemann.\n\nApril 4, 1936\n\nHitler appoints Göring Commissar for Raw Materials and Foreign Currency.\n\nOctober 18, 1936\n\nGöring becomes Commissioner for the Four-Year Plan. This appointment, as well as that of Commissar for Raw Materials and Foreign Currency, gives Göring a great deal of influence over the German economy. Between 1937 and 1941, Göring exercises nearly absolute power over the country's economy.\n\nMarch 1, 1938\n\nHitler promotes Göring to Field Marshal General (Generalfeldmarschall).\n\nNovember 9-10, 1938\n\nThe Nazi Party leadership uses the excuse of the murder of a German diplomat in Paris by a Jewish youth to unleash a nationwide pogrom (Kristallnacht; Night of Broken Glass) against Jews in the German Reich. During the pogrom, the Nazis and some of their followers burn synagogues, loot Jewish homes and businesses, and kill at least 91 Jews.\n\nNovember 12, 1938\n\nGöring calls a conference of Nazi government officials and SS and police leaders in the Air Force Ministry. Subjects discussed include the imposition of a one billion Reichsmark fine on the Jewish communities of the Reich as \"punishment\" for the murder of the German diplomat and the future course of legislation aimed at removing the Jews from the German economy.\n\nJanuary 24, 1939\n\nGöring, acting in his capacity as chief of the Four-Year Plan, authorizes Reinhard Heydrich to establish a national and central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Berlin to accelerate the \"solution\" to the Jewish \"question\" in the Reich through emigration and expulsion.\n\nAugust 30, 1939\n\nHitler appoints Göring Chairman of the Reich Defense Council.\n\nJuly 19, 1940\n\nAfter the German victory in France, Hitler names Göring Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich (Reishmarschall des großdeutschen Reiches).\n\nSummer 1940\n\nGöring's reputation with his colleagues in the Nazi regime is tarnished after the German Air Force fails to defeat the British Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.\n\nJuly 31, 1941\n\nGöring authorizes Reinhard Heydrich to coordinate resources of the Reich for a \"solution of the Jewish Question\" throughout Europe.\n\nNovember 1941\n\nHitler begins to harshly criticize the German Air Force's failure to completely eliminate the Soviet air force and to adequately supply troops engaged deep in the Soviet Union.\n\nDecember 19, 1941\n\nHitler takes direct control over the German Armed Forces. The German Air Force is subsequently reduced to a support service for the Army.\n\nMarch 1943\n\nHitler blames Göring when the British offensive creates extensive damage and destruction in the Ruhr industrial region of Germany.\n\nApril 23, 1945\n\nWhen Hitler is cut off in Berlin as Soviet troops encircle the capital, Göring sends a telegram to Hitler requesting authorization to take over as Hitler's successor. Hitler denounces Göring as a traitor, strips him of all his offices, and orders his arrest.\n\nMay 7, 1945\n\nGermany surrenders to the Allies. Göring is arrested by US troops southeast of Salzburg, Austria.\n\nOctober 1, 1946\n\nThe judges of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg sentence Göring to death by hanging."
