        "text": "Question: How many victims died in the concentration camps?\n\nThe exact number of the victims in the concentration camps is unknown. Most of the historians estimated that the total of the NON-Jewish victims would approach 500,000. Please note that this number include only the people who died in the camps and exclude all the victims of executions by the \"einsatzgruppen\" (extermination squad). Here are some estimations for the major camps. These estimations include Jews and non-Jews:\n\nExtermination camps:\n\nAuschwitz: 2,1 - 2,5 millions deaths\n\nBelzec: 500,000 - 600,000 deaths\n\nChelmno: 150,000 - 300,000 deaths\n\nMajdanek: 360,000 deaths\n\nSobibor: 250,000 deaths\n\nTreblinka: 800 - 900,000 deaths, probably many more.\n\nConcentration camps:\n\nBergen-Belsen : 50,000 deaths\n\nMittelbau-Dora: unkwown but certainly tens of thousands\n\nBuchenwald: 50-60,000 deaths\n\nFlossenburg: 73,000 deaths\n\nNatzweiler-Struthof: 12,000 deaths\n\nDachau: 32,000 deaths\n\nNeuengamme: 56,000 deaths\n\nRavensbruck: 92,000 deaths\n\nSachsenhausen: 40-50,000 deaths\n\nGross-Rosen: 40,000 deaths\n\nMauthausen: 120,000 deaths\n\nStutthof: 65,000 deaths\n\nPlease note that these numbers are only estimations and that the real number of victims is probably much higher. For instance, it is known that thousands of Russian POWs were killed in the camps without having been registered on the camps lists of inmates. Also thousands of infants were also killed by the Germans, before they had been registered as new-borne.\n\nQuestion: How did the Germans treat those who had some Jewish blood but were not classified as Jews?\n\nThose who were not classified as Jews but who had some Jewish blood were categorized as Mischlinge (hybrids) and were divided into two groups:\n\nMischlinge of the first degree--those with two Jewish grandparents;\n\nMischlinge of the second degree--those with one Jewish grandparent.\n\nThe Mischlinge were officially excluded from membership in the Nazi Party and all Party organizations (e.g. SA, SS, etc.). Although they were drafted into the Germany Army, they could not attain the rank of officers. They were also barred from the civil service and from certain professions. (Individual Mischlinge were, however, granted exemptions under certain circumstances.) Nazi officials considered plans to sterilize Mischlinge, but this was never done. During World War II, first-degree Mischlinge, incarcerated in concentration camps, were deported to death camps.\n\nQuestion: How did Germany's allies, the Japanese and the Italians, treat the Jews in the lands they occupied?\n\nNeither the Italians nor the Japanese, both of whom were Germany's allies during World War II, cooperated regarding the \"Final Solution.\" Although the Italians did, upon German urging, institute discriminatory legislation against Italian Jews, Mussolini's government refused to participate in the \"Final Solution\" and consistently refused to deport its Jewish residents. Moreover, in their occupied areas of France, Greece, and Yugoslavia, the Italians protected the Jews and did not allow them to be deported. However, when the Germans overthrew the Badoglio government in 1943, the Jews of Italy, as well as those under Italian protection in occupied areas, were subject to the \"Final Solution.\"\n\nThe Japanese were also relatively tolerant toward the Jews in their country as well as in the areas which they occupied. Despite pressure by their German allies urging them to take stringent measures against Jews, the Japanese refused to do so. Refugees were allowed to enter Japan until the spring of 1941, and Jews in Japanese-occupied China were treated well. In the summer and fall of 1941, refugees in Japan were transferred to Shanghai but no measures were taken against them until early 1943, when they were forced to move into the Hongkew Ghetto. While conditions were hardly satisfactory, they were far superior to those in the ghettos under German control."
