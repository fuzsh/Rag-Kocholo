        "text": "The striking story of a band of Cavalrymen who got off their warhorses and drives warplanes, affecting the world history.\n\n“The aggressive spirit, the offensive, is the chief ingredient everywhere in the war, and the sky is no exception.” ~(Rittmeister Manfred Baron von Richthofen)\n\nEkrem Recep Batra was the son of the Ottoman Minister of War (Harbiye Nazırı) and Fieldmarchall Recep Pasha (aka Rexhep Pasha Mati) of Mat (Albania), one of the Modern (Young-Turk) Pashas of the Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II period. Ekrem Recep Batra got an Albanian nobility from his father Recep Pasha and has an Austro-Hungarian nobility (Count / Graf nobility from Tirol in Austria, and he was also the far descendant of Vlad “Dracula” The Impaler) from his hungarian mother Lütfiye (Her Hungarian name is unknown). And his German aristocratic roots goes back to Hohenstaufen Dynasty, the famous Holy Roman Emperors which rosed directly from Friedrich Barbarossa, and Ekrem’s own autograph depicts in “Sütterlinschrift” style as can read as;\n\n“Grf. (Graf) v. (von) Brandis ‘Oblt (Oberleutnant)”\n\nMeans: Oberleutnant Graf von Brandis\n\nEkrem’s Coat of Arms in his Silver Cavalry Cigarette Box depicts “9 Graped” Count’s Crown on the top, and an 15th Century Wappen shield, which contains 4 windows, and 4 Guardians inside as 2 Rampant Red Lions and 2 Four-Legged Walking Red Leopards, and there is 2 rectangular shapes which that contains Blue horizontal bends inside in it. This Coat of Arms is used by the Counts of Brandis since 15th Century and recorded as “Coat of Arms of Brandis” on the well-known heraldic artworks archives such as; “Tiroler Landesmuseum Ferdinandeum Bibliothek“\n\nAnd his wife Ismet Koçibey-Batra got noble Greecian roots in her family (Her family’s oldest Greecian surname was Vasiliki). Ismet Koçibey’s Great-Grandfather was Ali Pasha of Tepelonia (Lion of Ioannina) a Governor of Ioannina, and he is regardedly well loved in today’s Greece as he was one of the few people whom they rosed the toughts of independency amongst the Greecian people. Ismet’s childhood passed on her grandmother’s house in Ioannina, possibly in the town of Zagohori. And Ekrem Recep’s childhood passed on his beloved mother’s city Debreczen, in Hungary.\n\n(Notes about Brandis Aristocratic Branch: Also known as Prandis, old nobility from both Austria and Switzerland, They were Barons in Switzerland since from 1512, and also they were Counts in Austria roots back to 12th Century to early-13th Century. The family built two High Altitude castles, the Brandis Castle and the Lanaburg (Leonburg), they both initially in Ownership. The two castles were first mentioned in 1236. From the beginning of the 13th Century the lords of Lana branched out into several sexes, each named after their seats, including those of Brandis, Lanaburg, von Braunsberg, from Marling-Lebenberg and from Werrenberg (on the Werrenberg, also tower too Völlan called). They all had a “Red Lions” in their Coat of Arms and they were the Counts of Tirol region in Austria which includes Innsbruck. On 4 March 1769 in Vienna the family received Coat of Arms and was admitted to the hereditary-nobility of the Holy Roman Empire by Joseph II. On 10 June 1854 they also received the hereditary title of Freiherr in the Kingdom of Hannover. On 2 May 1907 the family was also officially admitted into the nobility of the Kingdom of Saxony.)\n\nJoining the Imperial German Uhlan Cavalry known as the “Lancers” at the age of 6:\n\nAt the age of 6, he enrolled in the Prussian Royal Army “A La Suit” regiments (requiring a personalized invitation to enroll) Westfälisches Ulanen Regiment Nr.5 (Royal Lancers “Uhlan” Cavalry regiment.) as rank of Unteroffizier for the wishes of his beloved father. And he was under the direct “Sponsorship” of Kaiser Wilhelm II von Preußen. He received his education at a military school in Lichterfelde Preußische Kadettenanstalt, Berlin.\n\n(Note: Uhlans ( ˈuːlɑːn, ˈjuːlən/; Polish: ułan; Lithuanian: ulonas; German: Ulan;\n\nFrench: Uhlan) were a type of light cavalry, primarily armed with a lance.\n\nWhile first appearing in the cavalry of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Uhlans were quickly adopted by the mounted forces of other countries, including France, Russia, Prussia, Saxony, and Austria-Hungary.\n\nUhlans traditionally wore a double-breasted short-tailed jacket with a coloured ‘plastron‘ panel at the front called as “Uhlanka Tunic“, a coloured sash, and a square-topped Polish lancer cap (Rogatywka, also called Czapka or Tschapka in German).\n\nThis bronze cap or cavalry helmet was derived from a traditional designs of Polish cap, formalised and stylised for the military use.\n\nTheir lances were traditionally topped with a small, swallow-tailed flag (pennon) just below the spearhead.\n\nThey used 2-Meter-long Lances when they galloped their horses to attack against enemy to disintegrate the enemy lines. Their secondary weapon was Sword which they used in close-ranges where the Melée combat becomes crucial. Rifles like Mauser later inserted to the Units as a Third choice of weapon on the World War 1 -especially from the beginning of 1917 when attacking with Lances becomes impossible due to deep-trenches started to being use in the fronts. So, Rifles becomes the first choice in the long-ranges and Lances becomes secondary, then swords were the third. In many ways, Uhlans closely resembled cavalry units of antiquity; often carrying lances and sabers into battle alongside their rifles. Uhlans also used aerobical movements when riding the horse such as Somersault and jumping in-and-out from the horse during the riding, including reverse-riding as well. Uhlans not only used their Lances to just make a swing attack during the melées, but also they can throw their Lances in far distances like Javelin if the situation requires.\n\nUhlan units started emerging in Western European armies in-between Napoleonic Era and especially during the War of Austrian Succession, starting with an uhlan squadron, known as the Natzmer Uhlanen, formed by Frederick the Great in 1740.\n\nThe next year, the squadrons was expanded to the Uhlan regiments, and they became an elite German Royal Cavalry regiments until the beginning of World War 2, when Hitler disbanded this elite regiments in-order to create his own battalions.\n\nThe Uhlan units formed by up-to 50 Regiments numbered by 1 from 30’s and each Regiment named by it’s own founding commanders, each Regiment got different uniform colors.)\n\nBeginning of a Military Career with Franco-Prussian War and the Siege of Metz at the age of 14:\n\nEkrem started his military career at the front on the Franco-Prussian War with 5th Uhlans. At the age of 14, he was serving with the Cavalry units, which press through the prussian/france borders through the alsatian region and finally broke the resistance of the French armies in the Siege of Metz with the 5th Uhlans. Before long, his name became starred in the German army scene. Famous German General Gerhard von Pelet-Narbonne was his personal teacher. He developed a close friendship with the famous German Generals Helmuth von Moltke, Karl von Steinmetz, Major-General Ludolf von Alvensleben and Fieldmarchal Graf von Haeseler. Along with his Trakehner breed beloved horse, Irrlicht (Midnight Light / Will O ‘The Wisp), he was conducting operations that broke enemy lines at night, especially when it got dark. He was nicknamed “Le Diablo du Metz” (Metz’s Devil) for his bravery in the Siege of Metz. Lightly wounded from his back by a sword attack while he fought against famous “Armée du Rhin” of French Marshall Bazaine, and General Joachim Joseph Napoléon Murat (known as 4th Prince Murat) ‘s “2e Régiment de Dragons, 2e RD” (2nd Dragoon Regiment) in on-going “Battle of Mars la Tour” at the same time with the Siege of Metz synchronisingly. Ekrem was at the front of his Cavary unit (5th Uhlans) when the German Uhlan Cavalry division which enbodied by 5th Uhlans, 11th Uhlans, 15th Uhlans and 13th Uhlans including some Husars and Dragoons, together with the Prussian Prince Friedrich Carl of Prussia (1828–1885), they penetrated the French defence and reached the gates of the city of Metz. When Prince Murat was defeated by Ekrem’s Uhlan Cavalry units in front of Mars La Tour, Prince Napoléon Murat handed over his own command rifle, the Enfield brand British rifle, to Ekrem during the command arms surrender, which is a standard defeat ritual between the commanders. (This rifle is still in our house.) He received 1 piece of Iron Cross 1st Class and 1 piece of Iron Cross 2nd Class awards for this bravery.\n\n(About the Ekrem’s horse name Irrlicht: Irrlicht means Will O’The Wisp, means mostly a rare incident in swampy terrain (probably caused by the spontaneous combustion of swamp gas) a small flame moving back and forth over the ground (which in popular belief is associated with the idea of ​​spirits of the dead that can lead astray or bring bad luck mostly in the Swabian traditional culture.\n\nIrrlicht’s ancestral lineage contains many Equestrian Champion thoroughbreds over the entire 1800’s and even goes back to famous undefeated champion thoroughbred Trakehner known as “Eclipse” owned by Duke of Cumberland, (over the breed’s lineage of one of his Great-Grand-Grandfather “Sir Hercules“.) And also Eclipse’s Grandsire was also another undefeated champion “Flying Childers” owned by 2nd Duke of Devonshire back in 1715. It is said that this lineage goes back to the Stables of the Teutonic Knights whom they established this lineage in-order to create their War-Horses.\n\nAbout Trakehner breed horses: Trakehner is a light warmblood breed of horse, originally developed at the East Prussian state stud farms in the town of Trakehnen from which the breed takes its name. The state stud was established in 1731 and operated until 1944, or more clearly until the fighting of World War II led to the annexing of East Prussia by Russia. The Trakehner breed typically stands between 15.2 and 17 hands (62 and 68 inches, 157 and 173 cm). They can be any color, with bay, gray, chestnut and black being the most common, though the breed also includes few roan and tobiano pinto horses. It is considered to be the lightest and most refined of the warmbloods, due to its closed stud book which allows entry of only Trakehner, as well as few selected Thoroughbred, Anglo-Arabian, Shagya and Arabian bloodlines. Owing to its Thoroughbred ancestry, the Trakehner is of rectangular build, with a long sloping shoulder, good hindquarters, short cannons, and a medium-long, crested and well-set neck. The head is often finely chiseled, narrow at the muzzle, with a broad forehead. It is known for its “floating trot” – full of impulsion and suspension. The Trakehner possesses a strong, medium-length back and powerful hindquarters. Trakehners are athletic and trainable, with good endurance, while some are more spirited than horses of other warmblood breeds. Trakehners breed true to type, due to the purity of the bloodlines, making it valuable for upgrading other warmbloods. The history of the Trakehner breed goes back to middle-ages and Holy-Roman Empire. Old Prussians and other Baltic people such as the Lithuanians were noted for their hardy horses and cavalry during the early Middle Ages. During their conquest of Old Prussians in the 13th Century Prussian Crusade, the conquering Teutonic Knights named the Old Prussian horse a Schwaikenpferd, a small primitive horse. Those horses were called as “Destriers“. Beginning in the 14th century, knights used it to breed their military horses, and descendants of the Schwaikenpferd were later used by Masovian and Ostsiedlung farmers for light utility work. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the people of Ducal Prussia, Brandenburg, and Royal Prussia used a wide variety of horses from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Crimean Tatars, Ottoman Turkey, Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania, Holy Roman Empire for their cavalry and stud horses, crossed on local animals.In 1732 King Frederick William I of Prussia used these horses and other imports to establish the Trakehnen Stud at the East Prussian town Trakehnen (now Yasnaya Polyana, Russia). Soldiers cleared the forest at the River Pissa between Stallupönen and Gumbinnen. In 1739 the king gave it to crown prince Frederick II of Prussia, who often sold stallions to make money. After his death in 1786 it became state property, named “Königlich Preußisches Hauptgestüt Trakehnen“. Between 1817 and 1837 the stud added Arabian, Thoroughbred, and Hanoverian horse blood to their stock. One especially influential Thoroughbred was Perfectionist, by Persimmon, who won The Derby and the St Leger in 1896. He was to be the sire of the great Trakehner stallion Tempelhüter, and most modern Trakehners can be traced to these two stallions. The Arabian blood was added to offset possible flaws of the Thoroughbred. East Prussian farmers were encouraged to bring their mares, by then known for their hardiness and quality, to Trakehnen’s stallions. This enabled the rapid transformation of the breed into much sought-after army remounts: sure-footed, intelligent and athletic. By 1918 60,000 mares per year were bred to East Prussian stallions. Trakehner breed oftenly used in Wars as the horse known as “War-Horse” since it’s history strongly related with the Medieval era Teutonic Knights. For this reason Trakehner breed especially used in Franco-Prussian War, Austrian War of Succession and later WW1 & WW2. Today, the Trakehner breed oftenly used in Equestrian Championships across the globe due to it’s well-known acrobatical capabilities.)\n\nDuring the Siege of Metz, Ekrem Recep’s relations with his superiors has been growth effectively. In addition, Generalfeldmarschall Graf von Haeseler and General der Cavalry Eugen Freiherr von Richthofen aka “Karl Ernst Eugen Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen – 1855-1939, (Red Baron’s Great-Uncle), the commander in chief of the unit he served at that time (5th Uhlans), loved him very much as his own son. Thus, he formed a sincere friendship with the Richthofen family. During the Franco-Prussian War, He was Prince Friedrich Carl von Preussen (1828–1885)’s Aide de Camp (Chief Bodyguard) during that period. He nicknamed on German military circles as “Der Gegen Teufel” (Contra Devil) becouse on the battlefields sometimes his skin color was turning to red for unknown reasons in a short periods, (Dermographia) an allergy which turns him to look like slidely supernatural.\n\nRising in the Imperial German Army Ranks:\n\nHe then appointed in 2.Brandenburgisches Ulanen Regiment Nr:11 as a Leutnant on 1898 to 1907\n\nThe 11th Uhlan‘s headquarters was in Saarburg so he stayed on Alsace. He trained with his horse Irlicht on rivers, lakes and in forests. He learned Schafkopf (Sheepshead) Card game from his friend Oswald Böelcke and went together local pubs with his regimental friends and played Schafkopf (German Skät Card Game) with them, swimming on lakes together, learned sword techniques and played tennis with them.\n\nHis friends during that time were Oswald Boelcke, Karl Egon V. Maximilian Fürst zu Fürstenberg, Hans von Seeckt, Heinz Guderian, Erich Loewenhardt, Prince Sigismund Friedrich von Preußen, Prince Friedrich Karl von Preußen (1893–1917), Prinz Gottfried zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg, Wenzel Stamm, Kemal Ohri bey of Ohrid, Prinz Oskar von Preußen (1888-1958), Prinz Joachim von Preußen and Carl Christoph Friedrich Freiherr von Harsdorf-Enderndorf whom all was also there at that times\n\n(Notes: Oswald Böelcke himself clearly depicted in his well-known book “An Aviator’s Field Book” which published during the years of WW1, Böelcke stated that he and his military friends oftenly played German Skät Card game known as Schafkopf during their out-of-duty times.\n\nSchafkopf (German: [ˈʃaːfkɔpf]), also called Bavarian Schafkopf, is a popular German trick-taking card game of the Ace-Ten family for four players that evolved, towards the end of the 19th century, from German Schafkopf. It is still very popular in Bavaria today, where it is their national card game played by around two million people, but it also played elsewhere in Germany and in Austria, even on German Speaking Cantones of Switzerland. It is an official cultural asset and important part of the Old Bavarian and Franconian way of life. Schafkopf is a mentally demanding pastime that it is considered “the supreme discipline of Bavarian card games” and “the mother of all trump games.”There are various theories about the origin of the name Schafkopf, most of which come from traditional folklore. One suggestion is that Schafkopf acquired its name at a time when it was played for up to nine or twelve points which were marked with a piece of chalk as lines on a board, gradually forming the stylized appearance of a sheep’s head (German: Schaf = sheep, Kopf = head). In 1862, the family monthly, Deutsches Magazin, claimed that Schaffkopf “did not bear the unaesthetic name Schafkopf [“sheep’s head”], which it is frequently called today, but instead it played as if to imply that playing it only required the level of intelligential ability: or more briefly it is the game that “creates intelligence” by giving all those who have had willing to develop the opportunity to learn about how to make combination of theories and probabilities.”)\n\nIn the following years, he served in the Leib-Husaren Regiment Tothenkopf Nr.2 “Königin Victoria von Preussen” royal-life Skullheads Cavalry Regiment and became Princess Victoria Louise von Preussen’s Aide de Camp. (Chief Bodyguard) During this period, he went to Danzig (Gdansk) and he developed a friendship with the famous German Fieldmarchall August Graf von Mackensen.\n\nIn order to deepen his field knowledge, his commanders appointed him for a short term 1.Oberschlesisches Feldartillerie Regiment Nr.21 von Clausewitz Royal Horse-Artillery Regiment on the Neisse War Academy (Kaserne Nr:7) in Pomerania the german state of that period, which that’s today on Nysa in Poland.\n\nBecame friending with Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen:\n\nIn 1901 he was again appointed to the Westfälisches Ulanen Regiment Nr:5 (5th Lancers Cavalry Regiment) this time as Fähnrich der Kavallerie. During this period, he became classmates with Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen (Red Baron), who was 20 years younger than him. Becouse Manfred’s uncle was ex-chief commander of 5th Uhlans. Like his Great-Uncle Freiherr Eugen, the young Manfred was a promising Uhlan officer at this time. So the Richthofen family already knew Ekrem very well, and they regularly invited him to young Manfred’s house in Poland, and organized programs together, hoping that he would admire him. My Great-Grandfather nicknamed him as “Manfy”, which is a short version of his name Manfred. During this period, Manfred, Ekrem and young brother Lothar and cousin Wolfram formed a very sincere friendship. Together they played Schafkopf, Tennis, and drinked wine, beer, champagne and swimmed or riding horses together on the rivers. One of the officers who studied in the same class during this period was the young Franz von Papen. Papen was a cavalry officer with an advanced speech skill. Manfred and Ekrem enjoyed his long tellings of the stories of courage and the spirit of chivalry, which he told in the evenings for a little while with some champagne. At that time, Ekrem also met and befriended with Erwin Rommel.\n\nIn Autumn 1906, Ekrem invited directly by Kaiser Wilhelm II for his so-called Kaiser-Manouvers in Friedrichsfeld and also in Breslau, Silesia (now Wrocław, Poland), for demonstrating his officer-skills to his superiors. In 1907, he promoted this time as Leutnant. He received a Premier-Leutnant (Premier Officer) training.\n\n31 March 1909 Islamic-Coup attempt and the suspicious death of Ekrem Recep’s father Recep Pasha, Supressing attempts against the coup, and follows with Ekrem’s court in Düsseldorf which strangely connected with Eulenberg Affair Trials:\n\nIn 31 March 1909, a Radical islamic revolt happened in istanbul, where Ekrem’s father War-Minister & Fieldmarchall Recep Pasha has been in his office. Bandits has been killed Recep Pasha just as they has been killed many Young Turk pashas on istanbul’s political scene. And there was an international investigation has been conducted after his murder. When Ekrem has been heard all of these incidents, he wanted to come and join his father’s funeral ceremonies. But the strict German military regulations are forbidded him to went to istanbul. So Ekrem escaped his duties and went to istanbul disguisely without telling his superiors to his intentions. The incidents of 31 March part of an islamic-coup attempt which Sultan II.Abdulhamid appointed Ekrem to join the Operation-Units-Army (Harekat Ordusu) to suppress the coup attempt and together with Hüseyin Hüsnü Pasha, Mahmut Şevket Pasha, young Mustafa Kemal and Enver bey, they conducted Contra-Offense to demolishing the Artillery Garrison (Topçu Kışlası) where the coup attempt has been organised. They succesfully demolished the Garrison and suppressed the bloody Coup attempt. After the coup attempt has been suppressed, Ekrem returned from istanbul with SMS Budapest, a Monarch-Class Austro-Hungarian defense Battleship, but there was an investigation/trial has been started in Westfalisches Ulanen Regiment Nr:5 regiment garrisons in Düsseldorf which investigates Ekrem’s absence. Later somehow this trial strangely becomes a part of Eulenberg Affair Trials which targets Kaiser over the accusations of lack of discipline amongst the Military Officials whom close to Kaiser, due to Kaiser’s sponsorship over Ekrem’s military career. With the help of his teachers, whom were also accused in the same ongoing trials, General Manfred Karl Ernst Freiherr von Richthofen, General von Pelet-Narbonne and Fieldmarchall Graf von Haeseler, Ekrem learned that this trials is a part of the conspiracy which aiming the removal of Kaiser’s most trusted Military & Governant Officials, possibly also aiming Kaiser, aiming the German Monarchy and aiming the Throne itself. In Ekrem’s case, his accusations was his short-term unofficial absence. The stress of the plots of the courts caused most participants to fall ill during 1908. After Ekrem witnessing the chief of the Military Secretariat and General Dietrich von Hülsen-Haeseler died of a heart attack during the listening of his exaggerated-accusations during the trials, Ekrem arrived his court defiantly, and taking all of the court documents and told the judge Koch: “I see that you are betraying your army and heroic officers who bravely defend your homeland, you have reached the peak in cooperation with the enemies of the homeland, you are at the ultimate point in treasons, you are playing a theater here in my absence. I was not present here and your superiority has been started, now I’m here and your superiority ends!” and walked away from the courts with the documents. (This court documents still in our posession today)\n\n(Note: General Dietrich von Hülsen-Haeseler was one of the heroes of the Siege of Metz for Germany along with General Manfred Karl Ernst von Richthofen, General von Pelet-Narbonne and Fieldmarchall Graf von Haeseler whom all of them also were accused in the courts along with Ekrem. And all of them were the teachers of Ekrem Recep in his military career. So that Eulenberg Affair Trials was a critical point for Ekrem on the aspects of slowing down in his military career for a short period of time.)\n\nEkrem’s later thoughts were centered on the issue as if there is some kind of connection with 31 March Coup attempt with Eulenberg Affair Trials in somehow behind the curtains.\n\nThe Royal Funerals of King Edward VII and Archduke Franz-Ferdinand:\n\nAt Great Britain, Windsor Castle for the funeral of King Edward VII in 1910, German Kaiser Wilhelm II was also invited to participate with his selected leutnants to the funeral with his other nine sovereign cousins. So Kaiser Wilhelm II selected Ekrem to be participate in his Lifeguard Regiment (der Gardes du Corps) as a part of “1st Guards Cavalry Division” which will be appear in the Royal Funeral.\n\nLater Ekrem went to Royal Funeral of Archduke Franz-Ferdinand with the same regiment (Gardes du Corps) as a request of Kaiser Wilhelm II in Vienna, 1914. With this Assasination which conducted by the underground organisation known as the Black Hand, and the trilateral support of Serbia got over by the France, Great Britain and Russia, Ekrem already aware that the assasination was part of a larger plot that aimed to push both Germany and Austria-Hungary to a sinister trap, which will lead them to a larger European War, aiming to seize their gains which they got back on Franco-Prussian War and Austrian War of Succession.\n\nWhile the surprising attitude of Great-Britain after the Archduke’s assassination was the subject of discussions and the debates at the funeral. But for Ekrem, all of these were developments that he had expected and predicted. He expected such kind of treachery among the Cousin-monarchs.\n\nEkrem oftenly stated about the upcoming World War: “They are trying to find a ways to take the revenge against what we did back on the Siege of Metz.”\n\nReturning again to his Uhlan Cavalry Regiment known as the “Lancers” on the eve of the upcoming World War:\n\nAfter this events, Ekrem again appointed to 2.Brandenburgisches Ulanen Regiment Nr:11 Royal Lancers Regiment. Now he is more experienced, more accoutred than ever as an Uhlan Cavalry officer ever can able to be. His friendship with Manfred continued in this period as well. And this friendship made him popular amongst elite german military circles. His garrisons this time in Hannover, and so he continued his Military education in Hannover Military Academy (aka Hannover Cavalry School) for rising up the ranks. He received his final patent for 2nd Brandenburgisches Ulanen Regiment Nr:11 “Lancers” Cavalry Regiment in Wilhelmshaven. He completed his military education in Lichterfeld Military Academy. Those appointments was critical for Ekrem to rose again through the ranks just in the eve of the upcoming World War.\n\nAnd he already begin to smell of the gunpowders in the air, and he urgingly waited it since it was a long time passed for him back when he witnessed one during Franco-Prussian War. He rised in a War, and for him, the urge to survive, the sudden dangers, the suspense, the continous fear of death at the battlefronts, all of these were the elements that added flavor and added some meaning to life. He was not afraid of war, instead he perceived it as a sauce that added a color to life. And there could be no higher concept than the values ​​gained with courage, merit and comradeship in a war.\n\nThe Great War has started and Ekrem Recep went to Western-Front of World War I just from the very beginning:\n\nWhen the World War has been started, since he was still a registered officer in the German armies when World War I broke out, he first assigned to Western-Front and eventually, Ekrem’s path crossed again this time with Wolfram von Richthofen as they both were in the Westfälisches Ulanen Regiment Nr:5 Cavalry units. The 2nd Leib-Hussars of the 12th Cavalry Brigade were attached to the 5th Uhlans which was part of the First Cavalry Corps. It formed part of the German Fourth Army (Armee Ober Kommando IV)which carried out the attack on France and Belgium in August 1914 as part of the long-prepared Schlieffen Plan. Richthofen and Ekrem crossed the Meuse at Dinant, and their unit was involved in heavy action against the French VIII Cavalry Corps. They fought in Belgium at Namur on 23–24 August during the siege of the city (Siege of Namur) and again at Saint-Quentin. The 5th Uhlans continued it’s drive into France after the “Battle of The Frontiers“, but the Cavalry units was forced to stopped at the “First Battle of Marne” in September, becouse of the applications of newly-invented Trench techniques by the Allied forces.\n\nThe new Trench-Warfare doctrine of the Allied forces makes the German Cavalry units immobilise on the fields. This situation led Ekrem to continously search the most intense battlegrounds amongst all the possible fronts which will fit to him as a Cavalrymen, which this behaviour seems from outside easily as an “Action-Addicted” behaviour. (Similar kind of memories of Red Baron in his Pre-Aviation era, can be readable in his “The Red Battle Flyer” book, which he boldly depicts how he passionately led his Uhlan-Lancers Cavalry units into the center of the battles.)\n\nEkrem Recep wents to Battle of Galicia and Görlice-Tarnow Offensive in Eastern-Front and Becoming Rittmeister (Captain):\n\nEventually, Ekrem soon was assigned at the forefront of the Battle of Tannenberg and the Battle of Masurian Lakes until 1915, and soon after, his courage in these battles caught the eyes of the legendary German Fieldmarchal Hindenburg. He then assigned to Eastern-Front for took on important roles in the Battle of Galicia at the requests of General Ernst von Hoeppner and Cevat Pasha (Çobanlı). By this assignment, he was already in Rittmeister rank. (Captain of Cavalry, or mostly known today as Hauptmann rank.) And so he became “High Administrative Officer” in Imperial German army. While Ekrem still in Masurian Lakes region, by moving his Uhlan cavalry divisions this time with his friend Manfred von Richthofen, they together moved upon Bretsk-Litovsk with a small infiltration offensive manouver to arrive in Görlice region of Galicia by colliding against enemy forces. Contrary to common practice, he was a staff member of Fieldmarchall Graf von Mackensen’s command chain, not with the 15th Corps of Enver Pasha, who was also invited to support Galicia. His friend Manfred von Richthofen was there as a Cavalry Rittmeister for the one last time with his cousin Wolfram von Richthofen. When Ekrem gathered both his friends; Oswald Böelcke, Wolfram and Manfred together, Böelcke persuaded Manfred for joining Luftstreitkräfte (Airforce) and became an Ace when their mutual friend Kemal Ohri bey of Ohrid criticise the new Allied Deep-Trench Doctrines which slow downs the offensive of the German Cavalry. Manfred indeed was tired greatly of the stagnant and immobile trench warfare where he can’t able to do anything with his Cavalry units, and widely reported to have written in his application directly to German Kaiser for transfer, “I have not gone to war in order to collect cheese and eggs, but for serving another Chivalric purpose.” Kaiser then accepted his request.\n\n(Note: “Rittmeister” was a demolished rank in between Lieutenant-Colonel and Colonel ranks, and was active until the end of WW1. It was oftenly used in Cavalry units and later in Airforce units especially in Germany & Austria. The similar use of Rittmeister rank was also Hauptmann and meaning the same. It means as “Captain of Cavalry” and “Captain of Airforce” but it controls & commands the exact manpower of one entire Regiment (1000 men, equals to 2 up-to 3 Battalions) which is the same authority as a Colonel. Regiment units also has been demolished today. After the WW1, the Cavalry units has been demolished and the Rank only continued as a Hauptmann until the end of WW2. The rank has been completely demolished in today’s modern Military forces.)\n\nIn the Battle of Galicia, Ekrem also met with Max Immelmann, Godwin von Brumowski and Erwin Böhme during their continous Schafkopf parties together with Böelcke, Wolfram and Manfred. During those Schafkopf parties Ekrem gathered Manfred and Brumowski together for making them friends.\n\nThe enemy army, consisting of Russian and Italian elite troops, under the joint command of Italian General Luigi Cadorna, and Russian Commanders; General Aleksei Brusilov and General Baron Anton Yegorovich Zaltsa, gave Ekrem’s commanders a very difficult time, especially in the Brusilov Offensive, which was designed by General Brusilov for the Battle of Galicia and named after him. Following the Galician War campaign when Ekrem understands that the battle is about to lost, he then acted again with Mackensen in the Görlice-Tarnow Offensive, the last offensive act of the Galician war. Together, they broke the Russo-Italian defense and quickly a decissive victory. He became very close friends with Oscar von Hutier in Battle of Galicia, the creator of modern military infiltration Tactics known as “Hutier Tactics“, as his techniques of attacking the enemy were very similar. (See the upcoming Note section.) Ekrem was commanding Royal Hungarian Honvéd Husaren Cavalry Regiments Nr:13 (Astro-Hungarian) and 242.Air Squadron of Ottoman (242.Tayyare Bölüğü) during the Battle of Galicia & Görlice-Tarnow Offensive. He received 1 piece of Iron Cross 1st Class and Austrian Militär Verdienst Kreuz (MVK) 3rd Class. After these events Ekrem begin to learn the daily life of an Aces over from his old friends Böelcke and Manfred. Ekrem then awarded with 1 piece of German Iron Cross 2nd Class medal for his successful duties on Görlice-Tarnow Offensive. During this campaign Ekrem met with Bela Lugosi whom is later became the first Dracula actor of Hollywood. Lugosi was a Lieutenant of Austro-Hungarian Empire armies. (43rd Royal Hungarian Infantry Regiment), also he befriended with Prince Ömar Faruk (later, King Ömar Faruk of Egypt) at the offensive.\n\n(Notes about Hutier Tactics: At the middle of WW1, Germans sought to restore maneuver to the battlefield by working from the bottom up rather than the top down. They believed that the effective sources of wisdom were the sergeants and lieutenants who could see the problem from the viewpoint of a battlefields. The Germans used to restore mobility on the battlefield, beginning with an early perception of the need for change followed by a detailed and through solicitation of ideas by German Lieutenants eventually leading to changing their doctrines of the German High Command.\n\nThese efforts culminated in what historians term “Hutier Tactics” or “Infiltration Tactics” as this Doctrine has been invented and designed by General Oscar von Hutier. As the name suggests, the Germans renounced the traditional linear tactics which left from the Post-Napoleonic era, changing for a system that’s more relied on well-trained, well-led elite squads and platoons attacking independently to each other, bypassing the strong enemy sectors to infiltrate vulnerable rear areas. Elite squadrons were to infiltrate the Enemy-Lines, infiltrate the Enemy-Trenches by using non-traditional, non-lineer, assymetrical, distractive methods to penetrate deeper into the Enemy forces which seems unbreakable. This ground-breaking new concept effectively worked by applying it to the Stormtrooper aka Sturmtruppen / Stosstruppen units. The Germans unleashed their new tactical method during the “Görlice-Tarnow Offensive” and “1918 Michael Offensive” which allowing Germans to annex few dozens of miles nearby of Paris until it stopped by the mass of freshly arriving American forces.\n\nEventually two decades later in WW2, the internal combustion engine would eventually give Hutier Tactics the mechanisms needed to accelerate the speed of the offensives by a condensed order of magnitude and evolving itself as the “Blitzkrieg Doctrine” or briefly the more progressive version of the Hutier Tactics.)\n\nThe friendship between Ekrem and General Oskar von Hutier, which began with the Battle of Galicia, will further sharpen Ekrem’s understanding of offensive warfare at the doctrinal level and enabled him to approach much more modernized techniques with an open-mind, and while his other fellow Cavalry comrades are counting the days on the static fronts, or entirely giving up from being a Cavalrymen to become an Ace, Inevitably this friendship will cause Ekrem will not giving up from being a Cavalrymen, even after he ultimately become an Ace, while he still choose to continuing to be an Half-Cavalrymen.\n\nEkrem Recep becomes Half-Cavalryman & Half Fighter Ace and become Co-Pilot of Prussian Prince:\n\nAfter the end of the entire Görlice-Tarnow offensive, Ekrem returned to Germany, This period, Ekrem assigned again to Western-Front and eventually begin to fly and so he has been appointed to Prinz Friedrich Karl von Preußen’s Co-Pilot in Crown Prince’s Albatros D.I 2051/16 (Two-Seated) becouse he was already an “Aide de Camp” of Prince Friedrich Karl (1893–1917) and so he eventually became Half-Cavalryman & Half Ace.\n\nCrown Prince’s warbird got Skullhead and Bones insignia.\n\nOn following years he continued to his part-time flights sometimes with Crown Prince and sometimes with his old friend Oswald Böelcke, and learned the personal tricks of the famous Ace of Aces himself and eventually begin to fly with One-Seater biplanes like Albatros D.III. This period, Ekrem got his 8 Aerial Victories.\n\nIn this period, his old friend Baron Manfred was also begin to his Apprenticeship of Oswald Böelcke at the same time and beginned to his famous career then soon promoted the rank of Rittmeister just like Ekrem.\n\nBelow is the photo of Ekrem when he was participated in Battle of Galicia. Ekrem wroted a note in the photo by using Ottoman calligraphy which is the mix of Arabic & Persian known as “Old Turkish”. We used a local Official Translator Service in Istanbul, but somehow they confused the word “Luftstreitskräfte” with “Luftwaffe” which is never existed back in WW1. We tried to tell them that they are about to make a faulty translation, but they don’t listened us. So the translation note below depicts Luftstreitskräfte, not Luftwaffe. And Ekrem on the photo (Front, Right 2nd seated person) holds in his bare hands a small Aircraft model and showing to the cameras. Probably that small model is a one prototype that has just freshly passed the Wind Tunnel testing in that year (1917) which is not produced yet in the fields.\n\nEkrem Recep and Richthofen’s wishes from Kaiser to participate in Battle of Dardanelles:\n\nEventually, Ekrem gathered together with his good friend Manfred and Wolfram again, and they planned to arrange a cool Schafkopf party again. But this time the two sons of Kaiser Wilhelm II wanted to join: Prince Sigismund Friedrich von Preußen, Prince Friedrich Karl von Preußen (1893–1917), and therefore Kaiser Wilhelm II himself wanted to join too surprisingly. Kaiser and his sons teamed together, and Manfred & Ekrem & Wolfram teamed up together. In Schafkopf game, each hand contains modified rules which make by one team of player. This time Kaiser wanted to modify the rules, the bids will make by the empty bullets not by the coins. And also Kaiser offered that the prize will be decide by the winners. Thus Manfred & Ekrem winned the game. So Kaiser asked them what the prize will be? Ekrem & Manfred requested as they want to participate in the most dangerous battleground. Therefore Kaiser Willhelm appointed the action-addicted team to Dardanelles War (Gallipoli).\n\nSo Manfred & Wolfram and Ekrem was appointed again to Eastern-Front and to Dardanelles War. Manfred appointed as an Ace as he already transfered himself to Luftstreitskräfte from the Cavalry. Wolfram and Ekrem appointed as the Cavalry commanders of the Heeresgruppe F (Yıldırım / Jıldırım / Thunder Army Group or Heeresgruppe Palestina) group, and was appointed as one of the staff of General Liman von Sanders in the Dardanelles War. His role in this war was critical. Because in the tension between Liman Pasha and Mustafa Kemal, he took a prudent attitude and made Liman Pasha pay attention to Mustafa Kemal’s tactics. Becouse both Mustafa Kemal and Ekrem already knew each other well from Ekrem’s father Ottoman War Minister and Fieldmarchall Recep Pasha and also from 31 March coup attempt. So Ekrem acted with Mustafa Kemal’s troops as Liman Pasha requested from him for the same reason. During this period, he became very good friends with the young Mustafa Kemal. He also friended with Dr. Ahmet Şükrü Emed whom is the good friend of Mustafa Kemal. His old friend Kemal Ohri bey of Ohrid was also there. During this period, he also became friends with Hans Joachim Buddecke (Buddecke known by Ottoman soldiers as El Shahin) and Otto Hersing. They continued to play Schafkopf with Manfred & Böelcke & Ekrem & Buddecke quadro. He received Ottoman Iron Crescent 1st Class medal (aka Star of Dardanelles), also received Ottoman “Liyakad” and “Imtiyaz” medals.\n\nEkrem served as Buddecke’s staff during the period when he served side by side with Buddecke in the Ottoman lands, and Ekrem contributed to the establishment of Turkish Aviation & Air Forces together with Buddecke. Ekrem’s efforts have been underapreciated and never achieved discretion as much as he deserved at the first place. Ekrem and Buddecke were very compatible duo together on their efforts on the reformations of Ottoman Air Forces.\n\nHe was nicknamed “German Ekrem” or “Contra Ekrem” by Turkish officers due to his position in the German army during the Galicia and Dardanelles wars.\n\nAfter the Dardanelles War, he took part in the Sinai Peninsula fronts with the Jıldırım Armies group for a short time. He served on the German Süd-Africa Front (South Africa) with the Cavalry units of Strumtruppe (Stosstruppe / German Storm Troops) as the staff of General von Lettow-Vorbeck. He was tasked with suppressing the Boxer Revolts. One of the techniques taught in the German army in the 1st World War is the “Nahkampfspange” technique. This technique is an adaptation to the German Army over by the Japanese Melee Techniques learned by the Germans from their Samurai instructors in 1800’s Japan. Ekrem learned this technique with every single details just the end of 1890’s, His personal Samurai mentor was Tokugawa Yoshinobu (1837-1913). Yoshinobu Sensei introduced Ekrem into Samurai Techniques as he was the last active Shogun Master of Japan. And Yoshinobu Sensei initiated Ekrem into his Tokugawa Clan of Imperial Japan which was the last active Samurai Clan. Ekrem used his Samurai techniques intensely in suppressing the Boxer revolts. With his cavalry troops he single handedly infiltrate the underground Chinese gangs who organized the revolts and collapsed them one to another. He took part in the battle of Sandfontain and met with General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein.\n\nCalling again to Western-Front and voyaging with U21 U-Boat of Otto Hersing:\n\nWhen the cipher telegram came from the German Command Level (4th Armee Ober Kommando, AOK4) calling him to the German Western Front, he quickly went to Germany with the “U21” U-Boat submarine of Otto Hersing, his another friend from the Dardanelles War whom known as the “Saviour of Dardanelles”.\n\nEkrem Recep’s last Cavalry Battle in Western-Front of WW1:\n\nLater, upon the request of General Erich Ludendorff, who knows his talents well on the battlefields, he was then assigned again to the German Western-Front, in the Battle of Rossignol at Alsace region (a region in between Germany and France) 12nd Division of Germans, 3rd Esquadron of 5th Uhlans (Lancer Cavalry Units) and their Mounted-Artillery, Neufchâteau. Ekrem now finally gathering there with his old friend Wolfram again as they are in the same battlegrounds. Ekrem already knew very well all of this region, becouse it was located near Metz where his Military career first rosed at the Siege of Metz, so the battle was like in his homeland when he conducted Rencontre offensives (Counter offense against the Counter-Attacks of the Enemy). He received Prussian Kriegs Verdienst Medal.\n\nEkrem’s Aide de Camp was “Fahnrich der Kavallerie”, (Senior Chief-Sergeant of Cavalry) Emil Heinz Schüllermann at that time.\n\nOne day at the Battle of Rossignol, Prince Friedrich Karl, Wolfram Baron von Richthofen and his other friends were playing Schafkopf card game at the front, but suddenly French soldiers raided the hut they were using as a temporary shelter. While the Prince and his friends did not knowing what to do against the soldiers who intended to take them as prisoners, Ekrem was still calmly dealing with the play-cards on the table as if nothing has happened. While the French soldier is about to poke Ekrem with his rifle, Ekrem takes the French soldier’s rifle from him within the seconds, breaks the French soldier’s limbs and throws him to the ground too quickly to understand it. But before anyone in the room understands what is happening, Ekrem reaches the other French soldiers with fast and wide steps and neutralizes them one by one of all within seconds. According to Wolfram Baron von Richthofen who was one of the witnesses of that incident, told my grandmother, Ekrem was using complex melée techniques that resembled with a mixture of Jiu-Jitsu, Aikido and Kempo techniques. Ekrem then returns to the table when all the French soldiers in the room are neutralized, and while calmly collecting the Schafkopf playing cards on the table, Ekrem turns to his friends and says: “This area is starting to get messy, I think the Frenchs are on a retaliatory-offense again. Let’s get away from here folks.”\n\nIn order to keep himself awake from the morning hours at the front, Ekrem was routinly stimulate his body by applying ice blocks to all over his skin before taking a shower in the morning. In addition, he kept himself energetic and active by routinly eating special chocolates as known as “Scho Ka Kola“, which contained 500 grams of Caffeine in each slices. Scho Ka Kola chocolates frequently distributed to soldiers in the German armies from World War I until today and were distributed in aluminum packages in the fields.\n\n(Scho-Ka-Kola – Energy Chocolates)\n\nIn order to keep protect his Cavalry regiments from the enemy machine gun fires during their attacks, Ekrem orders his men to sliding down themselves from their horses while holding them, and galloping their horses by drawing rounding circles together, while coming near to the enemy, for creating an illusion that if their horses escaped from their military bases, and finally when they reached the enemy by the range of their lances, suddenly Ekrem ordering his men, to turning back to their standard riding position and penetrating the enemy with their lances on high-speed of mass-galloping.\n\nBy using a chemical mixture he concocted in the small ceramic containers, small enough to fit the palm of a hand that Ekrem learned from the Samurai techniques, with using the ancient “smoke bomb technique” which explodes when thrown on the ground, the artificial fog effect he created with this way in his Cavalry attacks, were never noticed by the enemies on the fields.\n\nEkrem Recep joins with Red Baron’s Richthofen Geschwader with the wishes of Red Baron and became a full-time Fighter Ace:\n\nAnd later again took part in Sturmtruppen Cavalry units first in Flanders and later in Amiens Front (Vaux-sür-Somme, Amiens). His friend Manfred was there again. This time as a fighter pilot now known as the “Red Baron“. Soon after, Ekrem Recep, tired greatly of the stagnant and immobile trench warfare on the Verdun Front, where he can’t do anything with his Cavalry units, inevitably wroted a letter to the German Kaiser Wilhelm II, requesting his transfer into the Richthofen’s Flying Circus. In his long reply, Kaiser wrote that he found this idea very dangerous for him and that he would refuse this request because he loved him so much. Thereupon, when Manfred wrote in his short reply to the German Kaiser: “There are 2 places on Azrael’s wings, there is one room for himself on one wing, and another room for his friend Ekrem on the other wing”, Kaiser gaved up. Ekrem was appointed quickly. As with Ekrem, Wolfram also followed Ekrem to join with his cousins. Richthofen eventually took Ekrem and Wolfram into the Jagdgeschwader-I, Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 11 (Jasta 11) group nicknamed “Richthofen Geschwader” (Popularly known as “The Flying Circus”), which he commanded, allowing Ekrem to fight as a pilot from now on and also assigned Ekrem as his Co-Pilot when Richthofen rarely prefer to fly with Two-Seated Warbird. (Later, Ekrem served also in Jagdstaffel 18, Jasta 2, Schlasta 26b, Kasta 13, Kest 5 / Jasta 85, and the Unidentified Jagdstaffel as known as “Halbe-Portion”).\n\nBaron Manfred also assigned Ekrem as the Commander of his Maintenance Team on the ground since he was already in the rank of Rittmeister (Captain of Cavalry) since 1915, which is the same rank of Richthofen himself, and so Ekrem personally took care of Richthofen’s famous warbirds with his maintenance team. And Ekrem already got his 8 Aerial Victories when he assigned to the Geschwader, so there was not any formalities left to prevent Ekrem to actively become part of the Geschwader. And still as an active Cavalry Rittmeister, Ekrem also took the management of the Ground-Reserve Forces on the Richthofen Geschwader’s Headquarters in Chateau de Cappy.\n\n(Note: The photo clearly shows the strong relationship between Red Baron and Ekrem, and the respect that Baron shows to my Great-Grandfather. You can see in Baron’s face mimics. That Rod in the photo, which Ekrem holds while friendly talking with Red Baron, is still in our posession with fine condition.)\n\nEkrem Recep’s personal modifications on his Albatros D.III (Oeffag), 11/7105 SN Aircraft:\n\nBaron Manfred, Ekrem and Wolfram now together again. The old Cavalry friends met again in the sky. They called each other “Cavalrymen of the Skies“. Therefore Ekrem met with Manfred’s colleagues and became friends such as Werner Voss, Kurt Wolff and Ernst Udet. Their old habit of playing Schafkopf parties together continued just like the good old days. He received Prussian “Das Flugzeugführerabzeichen” (Military Pilot’s Badge). Ekrem Recep is the pilot whose name cannot be defined in Richthofen’s Flying Circus. While flying with Richthofen, Ekrem’s Albatros D.III (Oeffag) aircraft (11/7105 serial number) depicts as symbol of Iron Cross and there is a logo of a Black Flying Falcon on a White Circle. (2nd Symbol Choice): “Crossed Swords on a White Shield with Four Roses on the corners.”\n\nThe aircraft seems to got a degraded-color in between “Steingrau” or Stone-Grey (Darker Shade of Feldgrau or Field-Grey color which oftenly used by German army) and degrading to Black. The parts near to tail was painted to Black, and the parts near to propeller was painted to Steingrau. The Propeller is painted to Crimson-Red. He oftenly used Airbrush pistol for painting his plane. (1910’s early type of Paasche brand Airbrush pistol).\n\nFor painting your plane, you should at least “Rittmeister” (Hauptmann) rank position.\n\nMy Great-Grandfather modified the Exhaust Manifold’s output pipes, which is originally located on near the propeller.\n\nIn that reason, the Pilot smells the smokes of the Exhaust Manifold all the time.\n\nEkrem modified the Pipes of the Manifold and attach it to the Upper-Wing, so he will not smell the smokes that came out from it.\n\nEkrem also modified the built-in MG-08 “Spandau” Mark 8 (8 mm) Heavy Machine Gun’s position.\n\nOriginally the Machine Gun got fixed-position just back of the Propeller, which cause many issues when on the battle.\n\nEkrem attached the Machine Gun to the Upper-Wing with one special early-prototype of Rotative Schwarzlose-Foster Mounting Mechanism, so the Machine Gun will rotate to Left-angle, Right-angle, and even to the Upper-Angle.\n\nFinally, Ekrem put one Rectangular Mirror to the front of the Upper-Wing, which will shines when the sunrays reflects on it, so the enemy pilot will not easily target him becouse of the dazzle, and so Ekrem will not depend of Dicta Böelcke‘s rule of “Get the sun on your back, so the enemy will not easily target you”.\n\nSo he will be free from the location of the sun, and can manouver his plane whatever the direction he wants.\n\nEkrem also modified the Cockpit section, and add one Thermometer indicator to the panel, so he can easily learn the weather temperature, for preventing the freezing of Carburetor on the high altitudes.\n\nNormally, there are no Thermometer indicator on the Albatros D.III cockpit panels. So he want to add one. (*In the future, that Thermometer indicator will help him on a scale he could never have imagined). And finally, he added a tiny small lamp on the cockpit panel for seeing the panel during the Night. Ekrem named his Aircraft as: “Madame Piccoli”.\n\nWhen asked him about why he made these modifications so passionately, Ekrem turned to them and said; “This plane is my new Cavalry Horse, and this new Horse can only talk to me with these modifications and indicators” he replied.\n\nEkrem and his friends especially thought and having conversations about their new upcoming modifications on their personal warbirds during their Schafkopf parties together.\n\nEkrem flew in the position of Left Wing Commander (Linken Flügeln Gruppe) in the “Vic Formation” of the Richthofen Geschwader, as he positioned in the far-left wing of the V formation.\n\nRichthofen was on the center as he should be protected by all, as he was the leader of the Geschwader.\n\nErnst Udet was on the front, as Richthofen pleases of his aerial performances just like he calls Udet as his “Perfect Apprentice”.\n\nSometimes this Vic Formation was formed with detachments of 5 or 7 planes, sometimes formed with detachments of 9 or 11 planes, and the entire Squadron was flown by this method.\n\nThere is one photo of them below, together as Richthofen Geschwader, and they stand in the exact positions of their “Vic Formation” while flying. Also Ekrem got another Iron Cross 1st Class Award for his duties in the “Linken Flügeln Gruppe” on Richthofen Geschwader. In the photo, Ekrem stands on the left corner of the photo, which depicts his exact position (Left Wing Leader) on the Vic Formation during their flights.\n\nAdventures as the Sky Cavalry:\n\nOne of the Ekrem’s missions together with Richthofen was in 1917.\n\nThough there are little information about that mission and it’s objective, but they were flying in Vic Formation (V Formation) and Ekrem’s plane was hit from the engine and it’s propeller by one Sopwith Camel and the plane is about to fall, but Ekrem wanted a revenge, becouse he saw his aircraft as his “horse” as an ex-Cavalry leutnant, so he should revenge the death of his beloved horse.\n\nEkrem signaled Richthofen immediately whom is flying close near to him. Richthofen already aware the situation, so Rittmeister comes near just below of Ekrem’s plane.\n\nEkrem immediately left out from the cockpit, and jumped to the air to down with turning a somersault movement which both of them learned such elite movements from their early-Cavalry era.\n\nEkrem catches the aircraft of Richthofen with holding it’s wing.\n\nRittmeister offered him to come near to his cockpit where Ekrem’s position will be more safe. Ekrem refused his old friend’s offer and standed on the middle of the wing where there are 2 constructive carrier masts of the wings and holding on them.\n\nEkrem told Rittmeister that he wants a revenge and so he wants to shot down the enemy aircraft that’s shot down Ekrem’s at the first place.\n\nSo Richthofen prepared to dogfight, but Ekrem told him that he wants to kill him personally.\n\nSo Richthofen dived the enemy aircraft while get the Sun on their back for making Ekrem “unvisible” and Richthofen manouvered his plane to the exact position where Ekrem can shot the pilot with his Luger Pistol.\n\nTheir fierce “vendetta” succesed and before they return to their airbase, Ekrem wanted to take one piece from his old aircraft as a memory. So Richthofen landed safely near on a crash site of Ekrem’s aircraft.\n\nEkrem took a Thermometer Indicator (Dreyer-Rosenkranz & Droop brand, and produced in 1916, Hannover) from the cockpit of his old aircraft which is still working after the crash and in our possession today.\n\nLater in a Schafkopf party, they learned that the pilot which Ekrem killed in action was one of the pilots from the famous French ace Georges Guynemer’s Escadrille N.3 (Storks) squadron, and the “Action-Addicted Duo” agreed that the Kill-Rating should went to Richthofen’s score becouse of they shot down the enemy aircraft while they flied in the Richthofen’s aircraft.\n\nEkrem inspired Otto Kissenberth with his techniques that enabled him to make dangerous jumps from plane to plane in the sky, thus enabling Kissenberth to learn those techniques and capturing an enemy Sopwith Camel.\n\nSoon after Ekrem’s next aircraft also hit from the engine but he was in a position where he can’t ask the same adventurous assistance from his good friend, so he manouvered his aircraft as a “Glider Plane” with drawing circles while falling, so his plane will hit the ground more smoothly when crashed.\n\nThe final manouver of Ekrem succesed and he survived from the crash with that final manouver.\n\nHe took another Thermometer Indicator from the cockpit of his 2nd crashed aircraft as a memorial which is also still works after the crash and even works today in our possession. Ekrem later learned that the Ace who shot his plane was the famous French Lieutnant Jean Bignon also known as “Pinocchio“, with his Nieuport 23, N2730 plane. Ekrem sended a request-letter to him with the wishes of another Aerial-Duel (Dogfight) with him as he wanted to take the revenge of his crashed “Sky-Horse”, but the War is about to end, so Jean Bignon answered with the suggestion of a Sword-Duel nearby Douai between Bertincourt. Ekrem liked this suggestion and the Mélee Duel ended with Ekrem’s victory, but Ekrem mercied him as he impressed by Bignon’s courage, so they became friends after the War.\n\nThat “Glider Plane” method which was allowed Ekrem to survive both from the two different plane crash, was a method which Böelcke, Ekrem and Richthofen trio developed such manouver together earlier with long friendly discussions.\n\n(Note: It was the very same manouver which both Oswald Böelcke and Richthofen tried on their final moments when they were fall, but Böelcke failed becouse his plane was shot from the wing, so his plane losted it’s balance when drawing that manouver during the fall. And Richthofen also failed to make the manouver becouse he was already in very low-altitudes so there was no time & not enough distance from the ground to make that manouver perfectly during the fall.)\n\n(On the photo, Ekrem Recep talks with Red Baron and friends. Kurt Wolff also laughing to the jokes. The Aircraft it seems belongs to Hans Ritter von Adam as well as himself stands near of Ekrem, Jasta 6, circa 1917. It seems Red Baron and his friends including Ekrem, visiting Jasta 6 Squadrons here.)\n\nRed Baron’s Aviation Methods:\n\nAccording to the stories of my Grandmother, Ekrem and his fellow comrades in the Richthofen Geschwader, selective against their foes, and strictly select whom the air-mélee dogfight, and being a foe in the air-mélee is an honor which requires to have high-characteristics in the said individual. Being killed in an air-mélee dogfight, or being mercied is a rare honor that one soldier can achieve and friendship must come afterwards. They saw the Air-mélee dogfights as the continuation of the Jousting Tournaments of the medieval era. That was the reason of the “Silver Victory Cups” has been used by the Red Baron as a memorial of his dogfights. Becouse it was an honor, and that honored fallen foes must be well remembered by drinking with those Victory Cups in a view of Red Baron.\n\nGifted with immense organizational and teaching talents as well as a shimmering charisma, Richthofen schooled his “unbloodied gentlemen,” as he called them, in the aerial combat tactics he had learned from Boelcke. Stressing comradeship and discipline, Richthofen instructed his pilots to carefully select their targets while ceaselessly watching their own backs, then to get above and behind the enemy and attack out of the sun while their opponents were blinded by the glare. He stressed the need for the pilots to keep together and cover one another and forbade any “stunt” flying—doing loops or other tricks—as superfluous and dangerous in combat, because he felt that he is responsible for the pilots in his unit. Baron emphasized unity and the importance of acting together. He emphasized that dangerous moves such as the ones he oftenly made should only be done at a certain level of piloting ability, and he approached all the pilots in his unit like an instructor. He also advised them to never fly too low or too far over enemy lines because ground fire often proved fatal. (Here on the following section, Ekrem’s story about Richthofen’s death reveals why Baron Manfred couldn’t apply those tactics on his tragic end.)\n\nLater, Ekrem also joined in Hans-Joachim Buddecke’s Jagdstaffel-18, together in the Eastern-Front and then he went again to Verdun battlefield with Richthofen. He shot down 27 enemy aircraft /27 Aerial Victories in-between 1916-1918. When he was with Jagdstaffel-18, he also time to time used Fokker D.VII, Albatros C.III, Halberstadt CL.II, Albatros D.Va and Fokker DR.I aircrafts as well as his old Albatros D.III (aka “Madame Piccoli”) for meeting the different requirements of his missions with Buddecke.\n\nOne of his foes that he showed his respects highly was the French Captain Marquis de Turenne. Marquis de Turenne was a former French Cavalrymen like Ekrem and Manfred, and the three of them all fought on the same battlegrounds in French-German borders known as Mosel and Alsace regions. Now they all become Air Aces and their challenge now transferred to the Skies from the Grounds. And they encountered each other oftenly during air-patroling with Richthofen. Captain Marquis de Turenne used Nieuport aircrafts, then SPA12, and by 1917 he used his Spad XIII aircraft during his serving on the Escadrille N 48 in 33ème régiment d’aviation. Captain Marquis used Cockerl’s Head symbol as his personal symbol. The flying style of Captain Marquis was similar with Red Baron as they both share the same Cavalrymen background and Ekrem was well aware of it. Captain Marquis also survived from the Great War, and even fought in WW2. Eventually Ekrem and Captain Marquis becomes good friends after the WW1 as they resembled each other strongly to their similar military careers. Another enemy encounters of Ekrem’s Aerial missions was the famous French Lieutenant Aviator Roland Garros. Garros used modified Sopwith Camel on this encounters. Both Ekrem and Garros were survived on this encounters as their dogfights leads to stalemate. And later somehow they also met each other friendly on some occasions and became friends after the war becouse both of them were also sportsmen.\n\nAccording to the stories of Ekrem that I heard in my family, Ernst Udet insistedly wanted to paint his plane to Red like Richthofen, becouse every single enemy wants to dogfight with Baron for the fame, so they all goes to “Red Plane”.\n\nSo Udet asked permission from Baron for painting his plane to Red.\n\nAnd Baron gaved his permission becouse he find Udet’s ace skills very promising.\n\n(Note: German Albatros D.III‘s, Fokker DR.I‘s and Allied Sopwith 2F.1 Camel‘s were the most powerful and elite Warbirds of the entire WW1.\n\nTheir development bound to each other due to their existence caused the main-powers of the WW1 seeked more high-end technologies in-favor of the need of getting the power-balance of their Airforces.\n\nGerman Albatros D.III‘s got the most advanced Warbird technology until the Sopwith Camel planes appeared on the fields in-between late-1915 to the late-1917, were becoming the most challenging foes of Richthofen Geschwader on the skies.\n\nThose new type of Allied planes were one of the main reason why Albatros D.III‘s becomes “out”, and German Fokker DR.I‘s were “in”.\n\nSopwith Camel‘s copied some of the specific late-upgrades of Albatros D.III‘s that invented on the fields for the needs of German Aces.\n\nOriginally, Albatros D.III‘s got modified built-in MG-08 “Spandau” Mark 8 (8 mm) Heavy Machine Gun or Parabellum MG-14 Heavy Machine Gun which are equivalents of each other.\n\nOriginally, the built-in Machine Gun got fixed-position just back of the Propeller, which cause many issues when on the battle.\n\nDuring the War it attached the Machine Gun to the Upper-Wing with one special early-prototype of Rotative Schwarzlose-Foster Mounting device, so the Machine Gun will rotate in three angles.\n\nSopwith Camel‘s copied this upgrades, with inventing the well-known Vickers 303 British (7.7 mm) Machine Gun and therefore the balance of the Airforce-Power changed in-a-favor of the Allied Forces.\n\nThis caused the urgent need of a more powerful warbird due to the needs of Central-Forces in beginning of 1917, and so the Fokker DR.I‘s were invented with the new upgrades for built-in Machine Gun by synchronising the fire-rate to the Propellers for regaining the power-balance in-favor of the Central Forces on the last 2 years of WW1.)\n\nEkrem’s talents on his Ace career was his rare tutelage period which allowed him to learn flight by personally Oswald Böelcke, Manfred Baron von Richthofen, Hans-Joachim Buddecke, and Prince Friedrich Karl von Preussen and so he mixed the personal tricks of his fellow friends in himself, so with such rare tutelage experiences, he was hard to become a prey, hard to become a target, hard to be hit on the aerial dogfights. And his flight-style was mix of his old friends, especially when we consider both Ekrem and Baron Manfred previously got Cavalrymen backgrounds which reflected on their unique flight-styles similarly.\n\n(Photo below: Ekrem Recep (My Great-Grandfather) while drinking Beer, with Werner Voss (Smokes Cigarette) and Max Immelmann, and one other unknown Leutnant. Ekrem and Voss drinks a glass Aerial Victory Trophy Cup together.\n\n(Left to Right)\n\nEkrem Recep also was the co-pilot of Werner Voss for a while and helped Voss to earn 20 more Aerial Victories in his record list. Back when they both were in Jasta 2 Squadron of Boelcke while Oswald Boelcke was still alive on circa 1915-1916.\n\nRed Baron’s invention: Adapting the Lancer-Cavalry Doctrine into the Aerial Warfares:\n\nCavalrymen, especially the Uhlan Regiments which both Ekrem and Red Baron were both shared the same background by it, got the most Offensive-Field-Doctrine when we compare with other Military Units both on the ground-forces and the sea-forces until the Airforce has been invented. The Cavalry doctrine always dictates the most possible offensive act as possible in-all situations on the field including the circumstances of the possible retreat. The Cavalry doctrine bans any kind of Retreat and replaces any retreat situation with the most realistic offensive act. The Cavalry doctrine dictates the best possible act during the retreat situations is the Contra-Offense which means “Counter-Attack against an enemy Attack” This is the reason why both Ekrem and Red Baron got the same Offensive-Styles in their late-Airforce careers, becouse on their minds they were still Cavalrymen, but not on the ground anymore, instead now on the Skies. This maked their relationship stronger more and more. Becouse few Aces got Cavalrymen background like them, most Aces has been directly begin their Airforce career without any different backgrounds, some of them were also Engineers or Telegraphers or even Infantrymen, but not Cavalrymen.\n\nRed Baron and Ekrem also discussed their offensive-techniques as a Squadron with drawing Vic-Formation together. Since that formation also similars with the Cavalry-Standard of drawing Mass-Galloping Attacks as an entire Cavalry Regiment for the view of Ekrem and Richthofen. And they used this very similarity to convert and copy some of the Cavalry-Standard Attack Methods into their Geschwader. This allowing Red Baron to make huge successes in the Aerial Warfare since no one intended to use this similarity before. And this is another advantage which comes from their long conversations on their “Schafkopf Parties”. And that including Wolfram von Richthofen too…\n\n(Note about the photo: Reims Aerodrome, Unknown Jagstaffeln, 1918 Spring, during “Second Battle of The Marne“, in German Spring Offensive known as “Battle of The Mountain of Reims“. Manfred Baron von Richthofen on the center, while my Great-Grandfather Ekrem Recep Batra (Right 2nd) holding the “Commander’s Stick” on his bare hands, this means he is in the charge (Commander) of this Squadron now. His Iron Cross and War Pilot’s Badge decorations in his uniform clearly visible, and wearing his Uhlan Cavalry boots, wearing his Rittmeister coat and talking with Richthofen while the photo has taken. I also saw Werner Voss, Lothar von Richthofen and Kurt Wolff. The bottom writes: “Hunter’s Flight Squadron in Reims“. And also writes: “Each of them are Hero”. And the other note depicts that it is a Sanke Postcard and published in Berlin.\n\nThose bottom notes has been deleted on the most versions of this photo in the internet with unknown reasons. I searched nearly 3 hours for finding the un-censored version of this photo. This one got the highest-resolution version that I can able to found yet, still lacks a little bit resolution at some level. Somehow, the intention was removing all the informations about this photo, and puting the censured and low-resolution versions on the internet strangely. Little information that I found is that, another version of this photo now in Library of Congress in USA, but that one is also the censured-version. And who put that censured photo into Library of Congress, is a real mystery.)\n\nAs a Richthofen Geschwader in the air, it didn’t matter to Richthofen or his friends who had the most victorious number of downed planes. Because Richthofen adapted the Cavalry doctrines into aviation in his unit, so the only important thing for them was to be able to act “together” and “stay” together. Otherwise, the Red Baron was not acting like a Terminator alone, as oftenly reflected in today’s popular culture. It was not happened like that way. Instead, just as the Cavalry Regiments dictates to perform offensive maneuvers by acting together as an entire Regiment, Richthofen achieved success by did the same as acting together as a Geschwader in the air. His friends in the Geschwader were there to supporting him in the air in the Vic Formation, by watching over him, by moving with him, by protecting him, or by attacking together with him and so together they were drawing the mass-offensive maneuvers in the air. Just like the Cavalry units… This was the key of Red Baron’s success.\n\nBriefly, if you were a Warpilot living at that era, you would never have seen the Red Baron wandering lonely in the air with his three-wing All-Red Fokker DR.I plane, searching for a new prey. You may only see something like this in Video-Games or Hollywood movies, but that’s not how you encounter with him in reality. In fact, you could see him by approaching you with his Gang, positioned his All-Red Fokker DR.I right in the middle of his 8-plane Pack of Hunters unit. Slowly approaching you with his Hunters pack. In that case, you would have to change your flight route immediately to escape, or if you were too close to them for to do anything, you would have to wave your arm out of your cockpit and wave your long white scarf in the air so that they can see. Waving a white scarf would mean “I approaching peacefully.” Otherwise, you would find yourself surrounded on all sides, and on all directions by Richthofen Geschwader planes within minutes, which would be the last thing you would see, on your life time. But you can hope that Rittmeister may want a small piece from your Aircraft as a souvenir, and for that you may honourably well remembered by Red Baron himself after you had been hunted by them.\n\n(Note: Jagdgeschwader-1 was the most famous “Airwing Hunters Unit” of WW1. It formed back on 1915-16 Season. As the first fighter-wing in the Luftstreitskräfte (German Air Service of WW1), it would be known as Jagdgeschwader Nr:1 or simply JG-1. It was a permanent grouping of five famous “Jagdstaffel” (Jastas or Hunting Squadrons), specifically Jastas Nr: 4, 6, 10, 11, 18 -thus it had a strength of some 50 aircrafts.\n\nThe history of this units is forever linked with that of it’s first and most succesfull two famous founding commanders, the two celebrated Oberleutnant Oswald Böelcke and Rittmeister Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen -then widely known as “The Red Battle Flyer” or simply still world-wide famous as Red Baron. JG-1 was known as “Richthofen Geschwader” to the most airmen still today, and it has a fame in popular culture as “Richthofen’s Flying Circus“, even by it’s foes of the WW1 due to the unit’s propensity and courage for moving up-and-down to the Front to wherever the fighting was most intense and needed.)\n\nIt is told in our family that the parachute technique that the pilots of the WW1 started to use after 1917, has been invented during the discussions of Manfred Baron von Richthofen and Ekrem Recep in their Schafkopf seasons. The invention eventually comes by mixing their old Uhlan Cavalry aerobic techniques to finding a more secure solution for their fellow pilots during a possible crash.\n\n(Ekrem Recep Batra, Seated in just near – Right of Red Baron, in the front seat. Ekrem Recep’s Order Pour Le Merit decoration in his neck is clearly visible, and also his Iron Cross visible in his breast.)\n\nIn 22 May 1916, several German squadrons led by Otto Kissenberth captured some French Nieuport aircrafts which some early type “Le Prieur” rockets attached to their wings with the help of Ekrem’s support. This led Germans to copy this new technology to their Albatros & Fokker aircrafts. So after the end of May 1916, Germans also started to use rockets on their Aircrafts. Ekrem aware of this development when he was spending time together with Otto Kissenberth and so Ekrem also adapted this Rockets to his Aircrafts especially for his Ground-Raid & Air-Raid missions. Ekrem later used this rockets in his ground missions to his Cavalry regiments. Ekrem’s samurai master Togukawa Yoshinobu Shidoshi teached Ekrem how to use traditional Bows. Ekrem attached his Bow with this rockets so the bow fires this rockets. Ekrem also used those rockets as a Lance and throw them just like Javelins and ordered his Cavalry units to do the same.\n\n(Photo) Halberstadt D.I under test at Doberitz. The ailerons are balanced with an aerodynamic horn balance. The horn-balanced ailerons are the easiest way to distinguish a D.I. It was fitted with rockets for anti-balloon attacks. The rockets were inspired by the Allied La Prier rockets used for the same purpose. Like the Allied rockets, these were stayed-in the prototype production state and was limited availability only for certain aviators whom already know how-and-when to use them on the active fields.\n\n(Peter M. Grosz Collection/STDB)\n\nBefore giving an order to launch a cavalry attack with this method Ekrem had found, when these rockets he shot with his arrows at the critical areas of the enemy began to explode one to another, the enemy began to retreat, mistakenly thinking that they was being attacked with the howitzer cannon fires. And so, when Ekrem ordered his cavalry to attack, the enemy had already become immobilized, explosions had already occurred at the critical points, and they had already become confused and unable to respond to the upcoming cavalry attack that Ekrem would soon to launch.\n\nEkrem oftenly used this new method he invented, when he was unable to fire any Howitzer Cannon fires to the enemy. This new method that he invented is a clear clue that how Ekrem brilliantly mixed his techniques on the Aerial Warfare with his techniques on the Ground-Cavalry Warfare. Ekrem never limited himself with one military doctrine. Instead he was so open-minded on any new technique that he acquired by mixing it with his previous techniques. And this is what makes Ekrem so distinguished from his most contemporaries.\n\nIt is no coincidence that Ekrem also told my grandmother that; “When we were together with Richthofen, oftenly some of us, -sometimes me, holding in the Red Baron’s Triplane’s wings and throwing some bombs with our bare hands while flying”It seems with that story we can say that Richthofen and his Squadron used this tactics while he was assigned in some Bombing-Raid Missions.\n\nEkrem’s adventures surely were more than we know, but these are the only known ones for us in our family. Eventually soon Ekrem Recep’s happy days were about to over and War became no longer a playground for him. And he will find himself in the middle of decisions that will entirely bound himself with continous series of Wars.\n\nThe thoughts of Ekrem about the deaths of Red Baron and Böelcke:\n\n*The thoughts of Ekrem Recep Batra about the deaths of his fellow friends Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen and Oswald Böelcke are quite differs from the official stories.\n\nThe death of Böelcke, According to Ekrem:\n\nDuring the Battle of Somme in 1916, the German offense has been stopped by the logistics that Frenchs got over by the British support. With the French Retaliation, the Germans withdraw to Bapaume where the Heavy Artillery forces located. Jasta 2 which led by Oswald Boelcke supported the ground forces through the air. Boelcke planned to attack first X.Corps and III.Corps then later on XIV.Corps of the Allies which was on the Retaliation move to press back Germans to Bapaume.\n\nOn 28 October 1916, Boelcke and his Jasta 2 squadron attacked a pair of British airplanes from 24 Squadron RFC whereabouts near Courcelette. Boelcke and Böhme chased the Airco DH.2 of Captain Arthur Knight, while Manfred Baron von Richthofen pursued the other DH.2, flown by Captain Alfred McKay. Ekrem was there too with the Jasta 2 squadron.\n\nMcKay evaded Richthofen by crossing behind Knight, cutting off Boelcke and Böhme. Both of them jerked their planes upward to avoid colliding with McKay, each hidden from the other by their aircraft’s wings. Neither was aware of the other’s position.\n\nAccording to Ekrem, there was also Mick Edward Mannock’s Airco DH.2 for supporting McKay and Knight duo. Mannock’s one-eyed face was easily visible. Mannock thought that the disyncronisation of the German Squad is a perfect chance for striking the German “Ace of Aces” Böelcke.\n\nJust as Böhme spotted the other plane bobbing up below him, Boelcke’s upper left wing was hit and brushed by the insidious dive of Mannock. Mannock dive caused the slight impact without even firing, split the wing of Boelcke’s Albatros.\n\nEkrem at the same time, reverse spinned his plane to the higher altitudes, and dive to Mannock, for the aim to get the attention of Mannock from Böelcke to over himself, but it was already too late becouse now Boelcke’s wing toring away.⁷\n\nAs the wing started to tore away, the wing lost lift, and the aircraft spiralled down to glide into an impact near a German Heavy Artillery battery near Bapaume.\n\nBöelcke failed to manouvering his aircraft as a “Glider Plane” with drawing circles while falling, becouse his plane was shot from the wing, so his plane losted it’s balance when drawing that manouver during the fall.\n\nSo he wanted to jump out from the plane. Although the crash seemed survivable, Boelcke was not wearing his crash helmet, nor was his safety belt fastened becouse he was try to jump out forward in his cockpit during the plane’s fall. He died of a fractured skull.\n\nSadly, Erwin Böhme was never aware the Mannock’s insidious dive attack to Böelcke during the air melée, and always accused himself for not aware of the Böelcke’s plane’s position, and feeled guilty for the rest of his life.)\n\nWhile Ekrem never forgetted the moments of seeing his friend Böelcke’s fractured head after his plane’s crash, and he witnessed that Mannock was the killer.\n\n(Photos: Leutnant Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen leads the funeral procession of Hauptmann Oswald Boelcke, while Ekrem watches the funeral procession of Boelcke with with his fierceful face mimics of deep anger, by standing on the front lines of protocol. While Ekrem’s skin dermographia turns-on and his skin color degraded to red by his anger. Cambrai Cathedral, October 31, 1916 ).\n\nThe death of Red Baron, According to Ekrem:\n\nDuring the “Second Battle of the Marne“, in “Battle of the Mountain of Reims” known as the “German Spring Offensive“, the battles both on the ground and air was connected to each other since Manfred Baron von Richthofen’s squadrons got also the duty to support the ground forces through the air.\n\nOn the 18th April the French First Army attacked south of Villers-Bretonneux and partially succeeded in pushing the Germans back about half-a-mile on several miles of front at the junction of the Avre & Luce rivers.\n\nOn the previous day just before 21 April, the German artillery drenched the village of Villers-Bretonneux with 12,000 gas shells, repeating the exercise the following day causing the defending battalions to lose a considerable amount of their men. Field reports confirmed that this gas bombardment was as a prelude to coming German attack on the village.\n\nIn the skies above the Somme there was also on-going “German Aerial offensive” known as “Bloody April“. And Germans nearly reached the outskirts of Reims by the perfect combination of General Oscar von Hutier leading on the ground, and Rittmeister Manfred Baron von Richthofen leading on the air.\n\nBut since 18th April, Frenchs was on the Aerial Retaliation since their attack on south of Villers-Bretonneux. Manfred Baron von Richthofen already aware of the increased French activity on the sky. And the discussions about this topic in Richthofen’s Chateau de Cappy continues since 3 days until the morning of 21 April.\n\nOn the Morning of 21 April 1918, Ekrem personally prepared his fellow comrade Red Baron’s All-Red Fokker DR.I Triplane (17/425) and established it’s routine maintenance with his Maintenance-Team as well as he did the same to his own Plane, and also he did the same to Wolfram’s Fokker DR.I’s (1/48) Triplane.\n\nTheir mission objective was to conduct a non-offensive photo-recon air-patrol as Jasta 11 & Jasta 5 squadrons. Manfred suspected that the enemy bases that they depicted should get air-supports more than they expected, so Manfred wanted to conduct this photo-recon mission which supposedly will finally reveal the up-to-date enemy locations to them. (*Ekrem and Udet suspecting the same just like Manfred here, so therefore, a general opinion was formed).\n\nIt seems Manfred suspected that the triangular region between 3 Allied Aerodromes (Reims, Compiegne, Amiens Aerodromes) may contain some of more extra bases than they depicted earlier. So their photo-recon mission was to patrol nearby Somme river whereabouts. And finally they together took off their planes from the Cappy Aerodrome soon after all their preparations done.\n\nDuring their mission in the air nearby Amiens, they ultimately ambushed by Allied Air-Forces No: 209 Squadron. The British squadron interrupted the mixed patrol of Jasta 5 and Jasta 11, led by Rittmeister Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen when they were just begin to took isometric-photos of the ground from the air. The British squadron was flying with mixed R.E.8’s and Sopwith Camels, while Richthofen Geschwader was about to flying in a mission which it’s objective was entirely non-offensive photo-recon mission.\n\nNo: 209 Squadron diving to the duo of the German two-seaters and a wild melee quickly developed as soon as after several German planes were quickly downed. This mission was also Wolfram von Richthofen’s officially the first mission. Wolfram newly transferred himself into Jagdgeschwader-I from the 5th Uhlan Regiments as a cavalry by the requests of his cousin Manfred. As Wolfram was a new pilot in this mission with only 5 Aerial victories he yet succesfully collected, his experienced cousin Manfred instructed him to avoid the melée fighting.\n\nWhen the squadron became ultimately engaged in a dogfight, Wolfram climbed and circled above the fray. Edward Mannock under the disguise of RAF Lieutenant Wilfred May, a rookie pilot, was also circling above the dogfight. Now Wolfram as his comrades being engaged in combat with the Sopwith Camels of RAF No.209 Squadron, Wolfram did as he was been instructed, but found himself under attack and pursued by Wilfried (Mannock).\n\nWhen the encounter first begins on the horizon, Ekrem quickly alarmed the entire squadron as the Left-Wing commander of the Geschwader.\n\nAccording to Ekrem’s later overviews, that Wilfried was undercover himself in a covert operation and aimed to kill Richthofen, and his real name was Mick Edward Mannock. Becouse it was rumored that the Allies had created special squadrons with the express aim of killing Richthofen, with the Victoria Cross medal being promised to the man who shot him down. So Mannock heard these rumors and wanted to get the prize for his own. Mannock now shows himself as a Rookie named Wilfried under the Roy Brown’s squadron. And for to hunt Red Baron, he first pursued Wolfram for easily get the Baron’s attentions upon himself.\n\nOn seeing that one of the Camels had attacked his cousin Wolfram’s Triplane, Baron quickly broke away from the dogfight and went to his cousin’s aid, quickly positioning himself on the tail of the Sopwith fighter which flown by Mannock on the disguise of “Wilfried May”. Manfred flew to his rescue and fired on Wilfried, causing him to pull away and saving Wolfram’s life. Richthofen pursued Wilfried across the Somme. Rittmeister wanted to represent himself – the “Red Baron” to the rookie as well as wanted to protect his own cousin.\n\nOn their dogfight which led both of them to drive their planes to nearby Somme river, Mannock led Richthofen (Becouse Baron pursuing him) to the higher altitudes especially aim for the plane of Red Baron’s engine and carburetor will freeze on the higher altitudes.\n\nRichthofen easily falls into the trick, going into the higher altitudes becouse of the pursue and so his carburetor freezed.\n\nRed Baron’s plane started to fall becouse of it’s engine stopped.\n\nBut Rittmeister finally restarted the engine just about reaching his doom on the ground.\n\nAt the same time the British flight commander Roy Brown disengaged from the main battle to support his colleague “Wilfried May” (aka Mannock)\n\nAccording to the Brown’s combat report, he caught the Red Baron at a very low altitudes near the Somme.\n\nTroubled Rittmeister flies in low altitudes for warming his plane’s engine for fly well.\n\nBrown’s first strike completely surprised the troubled Rittmeister, who slumped forward in his cockpit just after the bullets pierced his plane’s engine.\n\nRichthofen also failed to make the manouver the aircraft as a “Glider Plane” with drawing circles while falling, becouse he was already in very low-altitudes so there was no time & not enough distance from the ground to make that manouver perfectly during the fall.\n\nRed Baron’s plane again started to fall and finally crashed soon after with high speeds in a field on a hill near the Morlancourt Ridge (Bray-Corbie Road), just north of the village of Vaux-sur-Somme.\n\nEkrem’s story, Red Baron’s weird last word “Alles ist Kaput” means “Everything (World) is Dead” or “Everything is Ended”. Becouse Manfred was well aware of his position as a “Source of Inspiration” amongst the German Army, so he knew the general moral of the German Army will vanish as well as the fighting-will of the entire army.\n\n(It was Mannock’s sinister tactics that first Mannock under the disguise of Rookie Wilfried, will led Richthofen into the higher altitudes which will cause Rittmeister’s carburetor freeze and Manfred’s plane will fall to the low altitudes becouse of it’s engine stopped. And then Brown will easily shot Rittmeister’s plane and kill him smoothly becouse Red Baron will be in low altitudes.)\n\nAt the same time Ekrem dogfights with Wilfried (aka Mannock).\n\nEkrem always likes to surprise his enemies with reverse spinning his plane to higher altitudes, and diving his plane into the enemy aircraft and strikes it with surprise with his dive.\n\nHe did the same on Wilfried, and on the close distance, he saw the Pilot is one-eyed and finally realize that Wilfried is “undercovered Mannock” himself.\n\nMannock surprised with Ekrem’s strike becouse he watches the the fall of Red Baron at a considerable far distance.\n\nEkrem too soon realized his close friend Richthofen’s death during his strike. Ekrem is now only wanting to concentrate on his comrade’s fall even if he is now in ultimate anger. He already realizes that Mannock had hunted his another prey already. But now is not the time for a successful dogfight since the Squadron already penetrated.\n\nEkrem versus Mannock’s dogfight therefore resolved with stalemate.\n\nOf the original six who had made up the band of Richthofen Brothers, only Lothar Freiherr von Richthofen and cousin Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen survived the war, Lothar saved by his injuries. Wounded twice more, the 40-victory ace was recuperating in the hospital when he learned of his brother’s death before returning his Squadron. “Had I been there,” Lothar said sadly, “it would not have ever happened.” We understand with this statement that Lothar played a supportive role in the famous squadron rather than attacking the enemy blindly especially for the sake of Manfred and Ekrem just like Lothar’s statement depicts.\n\nThe similarity of the Red Baron’s approaches in aviation with Ekrem and the fact that both of them having Lancer Cavalry backgrounds strengthen their friendships:\n\nIt is known in our family that Ekrem saw Baron Manfred as his young brother, and both of them were strongly connected as they symbolize each other to their old Cavalry era spirit, and in the air, their adventurous nature strongly affected each other just like a bottle of Oil and Fire when they were together. It seems the other pilots in the famous Squad tried to create balance with their supportive tactics on the air. Becouse both of them were the “Attackers” and so someone else in the squad should draw the defensive tactics for the sake of the Action-Addicted Duo. Both of them saw the Great War as the “Playground for their Chivalric Adventures”. They were not greedy nor ambitious, but rather they wanted to proove that the old-cavalry traditions may continue in the air, and their new war-birds were their new cavalry horses. Within this strongly connected friendship, Ekrem went to huge depression after the death of Richthofen even he took the revenge of the death of his old comrade. When I was just on my teenage era, my grandmother Fazilet told me that Ekrem couldn’t be able to look again at his Great War Photos with his old friend Richthofen after the war. Becouse those war photos symbolized his “happy days” with his young comrade. When we look at those photos, indeed all of them are smiling to the cameras in the middle of the war.\n\nPhoto: Richthofen Geschwader headquarters in Chateau de Cappy.\n\nManfred Baron von Ricthofen on the Center as the Vic Formation line depicts.\n\nRight 2nd (Left 2nd for their perception) is my Great-Grandfather Ekrem Recep Batra as his position (Linken Flügeln Gruppe / Left Wing Group) as the Vic Formation depicts.\n\nCirca 1916-1917\n\nThe Red Baron and Ekrem were like the Thesis and Antithesis of each other, both in their cavalry attack tactics and in their aerial attack tactics. Ekrem would first produce a tactical offensive Thesis, and Manfred would immediately produce an Antithesis tactic for it. And both of them would synchronisingly apply these Thesis and Antithesis tactics they developed together in the fields. They knew each other’s tactical behavior so well that they both knew “when and which tactics” the other would use on the fields, and they would change their tactics accordingly for it. The fact that both Ekrem and the Red Baron are so compatible with each other has increased their success on the fields. Interestingly, the French nickname for Red Baron was “Le Diablo du Rouge“, which means The Red Devil. And Ekrem’s nickname was “Der Gegen Teufel“, which means Anti-Devil. And also the horse of Red Baron’s name was “Antithesis“.\n\n*Another interesting detail is Manfred’s famous Triplane was painted to “Blood Red” or “Wine Red”, not a standard Carmin Red which has been mistakenly and widely believed today. This Color-shade of Red is oftenly known today as “Crimson-Red”.\n\nAnd I must personally add that Red Baron’s well-known popular uniform during his golden days as an Ace of Aces, he still insistedly wears his old Uhlan Lancers Cavalry uniform known as “Uhlanka Tunic“. As you can saw the similarities of Ekrem’s Uhlan uniform that you can see in this biography, clearly shows the uniform of Red Baron were similar Uhlan uniforms only their colors were slidely different. As the mind of Red Baron, he saw himself as Sky Cavalry. So he wanted to continue to wear his old Cavalry uniform when becoming an Ace. He wanted to show the world that the Cavalry traditions now continues in the skies. So he feeled that he should still wear his Uhlan Cavalry uniform.\n\n*And possibly they got some very-early type Walky-Talky connection for keeping stay connected as a squadron we pressume.\n\nEkrem’s pain was mostly centered on that he can’t able to went Red Baron’s funeral, becouse that funeral was progressed by the Allied soldiers, which was that Baron’s plane crashed behind the French lines. So he can’t able to joined his fellow comrade’s funeral becouse of it.\n\nThe thoughts of Ekrem about the Assasination of War-Minister of Ottoman Empire, Fieldmarchall Recep Pasha, Ekrem’s beloved father:\n\nEkrem also learned that Mannock was one of the responsibles of the Assasination of his beloved father, War Minister of Ottoman Empire, Fieldmarchall Recep Pasha back in Islamic Revolt in istanbul as a British spy. Mannock was lost his one eye during his bloody espionage mission years before he finally enlisted in British Airforce on WW1 and Ekrem witnessed this. This caused Ekrem to driven fiercefuly by the feelings of revenge especially after the deaths of his best friends Böelcke and Richthofen.\n\n*Those are enough crimes which Mannock committed for the view of Ekrem, and as he begin to ultimately fueled by the thoughts of Revenge, just as all of these incidents becomes too much personal for him in the last days of the Great War.\n\nEkrem’s revenge for the deaths of Red Baron, for Oswald Boelcke and for his Father:\n\nOn the “Bloody April” of both Flanders and Amiens fronts, he witnessed the bloody ending of the First World War. His close friends, Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen, Kurt Wolff, Erwin Böhme, Erich Loewenhardt, Prinz Friedrich Karl von Preußen (1893–1917), and previously Oswald Böelcke were all shot down and killed, causing him great sadness and depression.\n\nFor the view of Ekrem Recep, Mick Edward Mannock was responsible of the deaths of Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen and Oswald Böelcke whom both of them was a close-friend of him, becouse Mannock was one-eyed, this makes him easily identified. Also he personally witnessed how Mannock caused lots of troubles in Istanbul back in the beginning of WW1 as a british spy and he was responsible of the Assasination of his beloved father War Minister of Ottoman Empire, Recep Pasha.\n\nMannocks’s one dark habit was watching his victim’s last moments after he shot their planes and having great pleasure while he watch their planes falls.\n\nSo, Ekrem maked a fierce revenge plan together with his Ace friends; Ernst Udet, Lothar Freiherr von Richthofen, Rudolph Berthold, Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen, Otto Kissenberth and his other fellow Austrian Ace friend from Görlice-Tarnow Offensive; “Austrian Red Baron” aka Godwin von Brumowski for his ability to perfectly simulating Red Baron’s tactics. Ekrem persistently excluded Göring from this plan because Ekrem was one of those who find his officer-skills and Ace-skills insufficient, as Ekrem being one of Göring’s current superiors at the rank of Rittmeister (Hauptmann), which was the same rank of Red Baron himself. (This event later caused a clash between Göring versus Ekrem & Ernst Udet & Brumowski trio, which eventually later Göring tried to put an end the trio’s careers)\n\nThere was also Rudolf Rienau in the Ekrem’s clearly rogue & unofficial “Vendetta Squadron” as a 8th supportive Ace. Ekrem instructed him to avoid any enemy engagement during action. Since Rienau was not an attacker, and always prefers to be the defender in the squadron. Ekrem will use Rienau as a “bait” in his plan.(Interestingly, just after the end of WW1 in 1925, his fate will be same as Lothar Freiherr von Richthofen, and this will also explained here in the following parts.)\n\nEkrem’s “Vendetta Mission” was also including his two Cavalry Regiments as: Westfälisches Ulanen Regiment Nr:5 (which is also both Wolfram’s cavalry regiment and the Uncle of the Red Baron’s own cavalry Regiment. Therefore, the 5th Uhlans voluntarily agrees to help Ekrem’s plan), and also the 2nd Brandenburgisches Ulanen Regiment Nr:11 units. (His beloved teacher, Fieldmarshal Graf von Haeseler whom is the commander-in-chief of 11th Uhlans, did not refuse his special request.) In his carefully designed plan, his Cavalry Regiments will fire from the ground, on the exact time and position he wants, when Ekrem orders them during the upcoming dogfight.\n\nIn July 26, 1918, together with Ekrem, they draw the famous Vic Formation which all of the aircrafts together shapes “V” resembling the formation of Richthofen’s Flying Circle on their last hunt, and Ekrem specifically wanted Brumowski to replacing the plane position of Red Baron in the new formation on their last hunt.\n\nAnd they forced Mannock to dogfight against them, seemingly intentionaly breaking one of the unwritten rules of Dicta Böelcke, Rienau used himself as a bait, to make himself become prey of Mannock and allowing Mannock to pursuing him, and eventually Mannock falls into the trick, and therefore he was pursued by Ekrem for to forcefully climb to the higher-altitudes and that was especially what Ekrem planned. Becouse he was also a Cavalry Rittmeister, Ekrem will order his own Cavalry Artilleries which uses Siege Howitzer Cannons, (5th Uhlans and 11th Uhlans) to shot when Ekrem will forcefully drive the Mannock to the lower-altitudes for to make him open to their fire-ranges. Eventually Mannock’s Sopwith Camel begins to fly in higher-altitudes as Ekrem planned carefully before.\n\nEkrem’s Tactics was the same with Mannock when he was insidiously killed the Red Baron. Ekrem perfectly lead Mannock to the higher-altitudes with the help of Udet & Brumowski & Berthold trio, aimed to Mannock’s carburetor will finally freeze on the higher-altitudes. The difference is Ekrem got one Thermometer indicator in his cockpit as his personal modification, that Red Baron never applied it in his plane. With that thermometer indicator, Ekrem perfectly scan the temperature if his carburetor started to freeze by reaching the higher-altitudes. And so eventually Mannock’s engine will stop, so Mannock’s plane will fall to the lower-altitudes where Mannock will eventually fly into the exact location that Ekrem wanted for warming up his engine.\n\nIn consequence, during their fierceful Air-Melée happens just like as Ekrem predicted, Ekrem with the help of Udet & Brumowski & Berthold trio, together they pursued Mannock to drive him to the location that Ekrem will soon throwing his signal flare for ordering his ground units to fire, while Mannock’s plane arrived in the exact location by the pursue.\n\nTheir mutual friend Kemal Ohri bey of Ohrid whom is an Uhlan Cavalry Lieutenant-Colonel also was there at the ground with the Heavy Artillery units of Westfälisches Ulanen Regiment Nr:5, waiting the signal f"
