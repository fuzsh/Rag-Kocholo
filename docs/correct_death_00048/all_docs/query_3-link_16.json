        "text": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, 23 November 2010\n\nThis story reported that the dock in which top Nazis stood at the Nuremberg trials is being put on view for the first time. But it was wrong to include Martin Bormann among those who stood here; he was tried in absentia.\n\nThe dock at Nuremberg where Nazis including Hermann Göring and Martin Bormann stood to answer charges of crimes against humanity will go on display this weekend for the first time.\n\nThe oak structure is part of the most extensive exhibition ever to have been mounted about the trials, which began 65 years ago tomorrow.\n\nAlthough the courtroom in which Göring, the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and 19 others went on trial on November 20, 1945 is still in use, the dock has been in storage until now.\n\n\"It was made by US engineers especially for the trials,\" said Mathias Henckel, the head of the Nuremberg Museum. \"The arm rests were deliberately designed so that the accused didn't sit too comfortably.\"\n\nGoring was sentenced to death after 218 days on trial, along with von Ribbentrop and 10 others. Martin Bormann, Adolf Hitler's secretary, was sentenced to death in absentia.\n\nThe dock is expected to be the biggest attraction at an exhibition that also includes such historic items as the suitcase used to transport documents to and from the courtroom and the electronic switch box used to power the electricity.\n\nThe south German city of Nuremberg was chosen for the trials in part because of its strong association with the Nazis. Hitler held huge party rallies in the city and the anti-Jewish Nuremberg race laws were compiled there.\n\nThe city is now inextricably linked with a procedure that became a model for many other countries trying to bring war criminals to trial after conflicts, such as in the former Yugoslavia. A documentation centre that opened in 2001 on the former grounds of the Nuremberg rallies has proved to be a huge tourist magnet.\n\nThe €5m (£4.2m) exhibition, spread over four rooms in an attic space above the original wood-panelled courtroom, is an attempt to meet visitors' requests for more information on the trials. It is due to be opened on Sunday by Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, at a ceremony attended by dignitaries from Britain, the US and France."
