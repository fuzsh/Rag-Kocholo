        "text": "SS Obergruppenführer Dr. Ing. [Doctor of Engineering] Hans Kammler, now little known to popular history, architect of the infamous Auschwitz death camps, responsible for the demolition of the Warsaw ghetto, and by the end of the war, the Third Reich's plenipotentiary for all secret weapons research, answered directly to Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler and to Adolf Hitler himself…….....\n\nHeinrich Himmler, who was responsible for the new racial order in Hitler’s conquered territories, showed signs of uncertainty about the development of events.\n\n\"In a report to Hitler of May 1940 he totally ruled out the 'Bolshevistic method of physical annihilation of a people and that such a policy could not even be imagined, because it is completely un-Germanic.\n\n\"Hitler noted on the document’s border: 'Absolutely right', and told Himmler he could show it to the other Nazi leaders as being congruent with his 'line of thinking'.\n\n-- Yehuda Bauer, Professor of Holocaust Studies and Director of the Holocaust Museum of Yad Vashem [Jerusalem] in his book \"Buying Jews Freedom?\" Jewish Publishing House, Frankfurt 1996\n\n\"The Wannsee conference of 20 January 1942, where, it was claimed for over a third of a century, the decision to \"exterminate\" European Jews, disappeared from 1984 on from the writings of even the most ferocious enemies of the 'revisionists'.\n\nOn this point, they too had to 'revise' their history: Iit was at the Stuttgart Congress of May 1984, where that \"interpretation\" was dropped.\n\nSource: Eberhard Jäckel and Jürgen Rohwer.\"Der Mord an der Juden im Zweiten Weltkrieg\" [The murder of Jews during the Second World War] Source : DVA. 1985\n\n\"In thousands of newspaper articles, books, textbooks, radio broadcasts, memorial speeches and television shows, the claim has been advanced that the mass murder of the Jews was decided on at the Wannsee Conference, or at the least, that the plan to carry out Adolf Hitler's order in this respect had been worked out there.\n\n\"As well, it is claimed, the means of killing had been discussed and the establishment of extermination camps was decided on.\n\n\"This is not in the protocol, and leading Holocaust historians are now repudiating it\".\n\n-- Eberhard Jäckel, \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", 22 June 1992\n\nThe most recent spokesman for the orthodox anti-Revisionist historians, the chemist Claude Pressac, confirmed this new revision of orthodoxy.\n\nHe wrote in his book, \"Les crematoires d'Auschwitz\" [CNRS editions, 1993]::\n\n\"The Wannsee conference was held in Berlin on 20 January.\n\n\"An action of 'driving back' the Jews towards the East was planned, with the evocation of a 'natural' elimination through work'; nobody then spoke of liquidation on an industrial scale.\n\n\"During the days and the weeks that followed, the Auschwitz Bauleitung received neither a call, a telegram or a letter demanding the study of an installation adapted to that end\".\n\nAnd even, in his \"recapitulative chronology\", he indicates on 20 January, 1942: \"Wannsee Conference on the driving back of the Jews towards the East\".\n\nThe \"extermination\" was revised: It was a question of 'driving back'.\n\nIt is equally remarkable that, in this book setting itself the goal of \"proving\" the thesis of extermination, there was no question either of the document which, after that of Wannsee, was supposedly the most decisive:\n\nHermann Göring's letter to Reinhard Heydrich of 31 July 1941, in which it was asserted that the \"final solution\" meant \"extermination\", and not the transfer out of Europe.\n\nGöring protested against the English translation of the German word \"Gesamtlösung\", meaning general solution, as \"Final Solution\", which is \"Endlösung\"\n\nTthis led Chief US Prosecutor Robert H. Jackson, at the Nuremberg Trials, to acknowledge the falsification and to reestablish the true meaning.\n\nCharles Bewley, in \"Hermann Göring\" [Göttingen, 1956] has pointed out that no evidence was found at Nuremberg to substantiate the charge that Göring was involved in the extermination program.\n\nKammler boasted almost the perfect \"corporate resume\" and a documentable record of \"whole person management\" as a \"team player\":\n\nA modern day management consultant who was talent hunting for a \"total professional with total involvement\" would certainly have been fascinated by the bizarre curriculum vitae Kammler could have submitted.\n\nHe could demonstrate a \"track record\" in \"very senior appointments,\" with skill in putting across \"aggressive growth plans\"\n\nIn the Third Reich, within a span of a few years, the number of positions he had held in turn was phenomenal.\n\nAmong these \"senior appointments\" Kammler once commanded were:\n\nOperational control of the V-l and V-2 terror bombardments of London, Liege, Brussels, Antwerp and Paris;\n\nOperational control of all missile production and research, including the V-2 and the intercontinental ballistic missile. the A9/10;\n\nDesign and construction oversight of the world's \"first bombproof underground aircraft and missile factory sites\", including sites for the production of jet engines and the Messerschmitt 262;\n\nCommand of the SS Building and Words Division, the department which handled all large construction projects for the Reich, including death camps, \"Buna factories,\" and supply roads for invading German legions in Russia;\n\nDesign and construction of the world's first underground testing and proving range for missiles;\n\nCommand, control and coordination of all of the Third Reich's secret weapons research by the war's end.\n\nThis warped and twisted administrative genius first came to the attention of Himmler and Hitler \"with a brilliant hand-colored design for the Auschwitz concentration camp, which he subsequently built. Later he was called in to advice on the modalities for boosting the daily output of its gas chambers from 10,000 to 60,000\".\n\nAll this is to say that not only was Kammler a butcher, but that by the war's end, Hitler had \"concentrated more power in Kammler's hands than he had ever entrusted to a single person\".\n\nIf one were to compare Kammler's position to a similar hypothetical position in the former Soviet Union, such a position would mean that the general who [commanded] the SS-20 rockets in Europe and Asia [the Commander in Chief of Strategic Rocket Forces] would also head research, development, and production of missiles.\n\nIn addition, he would be in charge of producing all modern aircraft for the Red Air Force and have overall command of the mammoth civil engineering projects or the production centers in Siberia's sub-zero climate.\n\nLast, but very much not least, he would lead the national grid of Gulags.\n\nTo match Kammler's position in the SS, the Soviet general holding all these variegated commands would also be third in the KGB pecking order.\n\nIndeed, one would have to add to Agoston's list, for such a Soviet general would also have had to be in charge of the coordination of all the most post-nuclear and super secret advanced scientific research and black projects in the entire Soviet Union\n\nIt is thus in the person of SS Obergruppenführer Hans Kammler that all the lines meet:\n\nThe Buna factory and slave labor of the camps, exploited for grizzly medical experimentation and labor in the secret underground laboratories and production facilities, the atom bomb project, and even more horrendous and monstrous aircraft and weapons development.\n\nIf there was a gold mine of information, then it was available in the blueprints and files that were locked in Kammler's vaults, or even more securely in his brain.\n\nIt is this fact and Kammler's extraordinary dossier that make his post-war fate even more problematical.\n\nThe Four Deaths of SS Obergruppenführer Dr. Ing. Hans Kammler\n\nGeneral Kammler, in addition to his \"accomplishments\" in streamlining death camp efficiency, his methodical and efficient leveling of the ruined Warsaw Ghetto and meticulous accounting of every last brick and stone removed, his co-ordination of the most arcane, and perhaps the biggest, secret weapons black projects program in human history, has also another odd distinction to his credit.\n\nHe of all the high-ranking Nazis indicted and tried at Nuremberg either post-humously or in absentia, was never formally indicted, much less brought to trial.\n\nHe is altogether missing from the docket, and altogether just simply missing.\n\nKammler has yet another distinction.\n\nHe appears to have been not only a very accomplished messenger of death for others, but also appears to have achieved the astonishing feat of having died himself no less than four times, each under different circumstances.\n\nAgoston commented at length on the odd assortment of \"facts\" surrounding Kammler's fate: Brainchild of none other than Martin Bormann.\n\nThe purpose of this special command was to evacuate... something. Cook reports that one of the enormous Ju 390s simply went missing at the end of the war.\n\nAnalysis of the voluminous documentation as has accrued, shows crude discrepancies, the inconsistencies of which grow with almost every addition to the mosaic of information that enters the picture Basically three major facts stand out:\n\nThus, in spite of \"the proliferation of unsubstantiated evidence that permeates all four versions of Kammler's death, the shell of the case contains sufficient facts to suggest a more than coincidental pattern of seemingly targeted and organized disinformation\".\n\nThe origin of this disinformation, according to Agoston, was probably within the SS itself, a program necessitated by Kammler's disappearance and likely treason to one of the victorious Allied powers.\n\nThe \"first death of General Hans Kammler\" is recounted by Albert Speer himself, in his last book.\n\nIn this most simple version, Kammler ordered his adjutant to shoot him.\n\nThe \"suicide\" allegedly took place in Prague as Kammler realized the war was lost and, according to Speer, \"acted in elitist SS loyalty\".\n\nAs Agoston quips, \"even the most ardent worshipper of Teutonic creed could not possibly suggest that elitist SS loyalty can be demonstrated three times, in three locations, and all on the same day.\".\n\nThe second version of the story, related to Agoston by Kammler's \"civilian\" aide Dr. Wilhelm Voss, was that the general took cyanide somewhere \"on the road between Pilsen and Prague on 9 May\"\n\nThe third version of Kammler's death was doled out by V-2 rocket expert, General Walter Dornberger, subsequently employed by the American firm of Bell Aerospace.\n\nAccording to Dornberger, Kammler's mental and emotional state had quickly deteriorated in the final days of the war, and the general overheard Kammler ordering his aide to shoot him if things became \"hopeless\".\n\nBut this does not square with Dornberger's close associate, Dr. Wernher Von Braun's own recollection of a conversation he overheard between Kammler and his aide Starck fully two weeks later.\n\nAccording to von Braun, Kammler and Starck discussed the possibility of \"going underground\" before the Americans arrived, disguising themselves as monks in a nearby abbey.\n\nThis report, if true, is perhaps the most interesting, since it indicates that Kammler had no intentions of surrendering himself to any of the Allied powers, but rather, intended to survive, perhaps independently continuing his oversight of secret weapons development.\n\nThe suggestion has been frequently made that the UFOs first reported in the late 1940s were the products of experimental aircraft designs that were developed towards the end of the Second World War.\n\nMost [if not all] serious historians would throw up their hands in horror at the very mention of such a seemingly ludicrous idea, particularly when one considers the associated claims:\n\nThat, since sightings of UFOs are still reported today by thousands of people around the world, these radical aircraft designs must have been captured, copied and further developed by the victorious powers; and, what is more, that some UFOs may even be piloted by escaped Nazis operating out of one or more hidden bases.\n\nIf the Germans did succeed in producing a piloted flying disc, what became of it?\n\nAs several researchers have noted, the answer may lie with SS Obergruppenführer Dr Hans Kammler, who towards the end of the war had access to all areas of secret air-armaments projects.\n\nKammler worked on the V-2 rocket project, along with Wernher von Braun [who would later head NASA’s Apollo Moon programme] and Luftwaffe Major General Walter Dornberger [who would later become vice-president of the Bell Aircraft Company in the United States].\n\nHeinrich Himmler planned to separate the SS from Nazi Party and state control through the establishment of a number of business and industrial fronts, making it independent of the state budget. Hitler approved this proposal early in 1944. [As Jim Marrs notes, this strategy would subsequently be copied by the CIA in America]\n\nBy the end of the war, Hans Kammler had decided to use V-2 rocket technology and scientists as bargaining chips with the Allies.\n\nOn 2 April 1945, 500 technicians and engineers were placed on a train along with 100 SS troops and sent to a secret Alpine location in Bavaria.\n\nTwo days later, von Braun requested permission from Kammler to resume rocket research, to which Kammler replied that he was about to disappear for an indefinite length of time.\n\nThis was the last anyone saw of Hans Kammler.\n\nIn view of the undoubted advantage he held when it came to negotiating for his life with the Allies, Kammler’s disappearance is something of a puzzle, until we pause to consider the possibility that he possessed plans for a technology even more advanced than the V-2.\n\nDid the Reich, or an extension of it, have the capability to produce a UFO or the clout to deal from a position of strength with one of the Allied nations?\n\nAlthough it is assumed that Kammler committed suicide when about to be apprehended by the Czech resistance in Prague, there is no proof of this.\n\nWhat really happened to Kammler?\n\n-- Alan Baker, \"Invisible Eagle\"\n\nAnother version of Kammler's death has him giving a speech to his assembled aides in Prague in early May 1945, dismissing them from their duties and advising them to return home, and then walking into a woods where he then shot himself.\n\nAnd lastly, there is a version of Kammler's death that has him dying a typical SS hero's death, fighting and going down in a blaze of \"glory\" in the face of rebelling and revolting Czechs.\n\nWhat emerges from all this is that no one, no where can advance anything like a consistent account of the date, location, time, or even method of Kammler's death.\n\nNow it is suicide by poison, then suicide by gunshot, suicide by ordering an aide to shoot him, a fighting death, or disappearance into a Roman Catholic monastery.\n\nNow he is in Prague, now he isn't; now he's with people, now he isn't; now he's suffering mental and emotional collapse, now he isn't.\n\nIn all likelihood, therefore, Kammler did not die at all: He disappeared.\n\nThe important question is, where?\n\nIn March 1945, as US forces were advancing through Germany, the slave workers housed in the Dora-Mittelbau concentration camp were to be executed as security risks.\n\nIt is believed that the order for their murder was received by Kammler, but he did not comply with it.\n\nOn 1 April 1945, Kammler ordered the evacuation of 500 missile technicians to the Alps.\n\nSince the last V-2 on the western front had been launched in late March, on 5 April Kammler was charged by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht to command the defence of the Nordhausen area.\n\nHowever, rather than defend the missile construction works, he immediately ordered the destruction of all the \"special V-1 equipment\" at the Syke storage site.\n\nWhat exactly this order implied is unclear.\n\nPreuk statement\n\nOn 9 July 1945, Kammler's widow petitioned to have him declared dead as of 9 May 1945.\n\nShe provided a statement by Kammler's driver, Kurt Preuk, according to which Preuk had personally seen \"the corpse of Kammler and been present at his burial\" on 9 May 1945.\n\nThe District Court of Berlin-Charlottenburg ruled on 7 September 1948 that his death was officially established as 9 May 1945.\n\nIn a later sworn statement on 16 October 1959, Preuk stated that Kammler's date of death was \"about 10 May 1945\", but that he did not know the cause of death.\n\nOn 7 September 1965, Heinz Zeuner [a wartime aide of Kammler's], stated that Kammler had died on 7 May 1945 and that his corpse had been observed by Zeuner, Preuk and others.\n\nAll the eyewitnesses consulted were certain that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning.\n\nIn their accounts of Kammler's movements Preuk and Zeuner claimed that he left Linderhof near Oberammergau on 28 April 1945 for a tank conference at Salzburg and then went to Ebensee [where tank tracks were manufactured].\n\nAccording to Preuk and Zeuner he then travelled back from Ebensee to visit his wife in the Tyrol region, when he gave her two cyanide tablets.\n\nThe next day, 5 May, at around 4 am, he is said to have departed Tyrol for Prague.\n\nWernher von Braun, also at the time at Oberammergau, later reported having overheard a discussion between Kammler and his aide-de-camp in which Kammler said he planned to hide in nearby Ettal Abbey.\n\nKammler and his followers then left town, according to Braun.\n\nFurther evidence of Kammler's activities is a telegraph from Kammler to Speer, Himmler and Göring of 16 April, informing them of the creation of a \"message centre\" at Munich and the appointment of a chief representative for the construction of the Messerschmitt Me 262.\n\nOn 20 April, he reportedly arrived with a group of technicians at Himmler’s Kommandostelle near Salzburg.\n\nOn 23 April, Kammler sent a radio message to his office manager at Berlin, ordering him to organize the immediate destruction of the \"V-1 equipment near Berlin\" and then to go to Munich.\n\nIn late April/early May, Kammler was reportedly at the Villa Mendelssohn at Ebensee, site of one of the projects assigned to him.\n\nOn 4 May, he ordered the immediate transfer of the Ebensee office to Prague.\n\nPreuk and Zeuner maintained their version of events through the 1990s, when interviewed by the journalist Kristian Knaack.\n\nSome support for this version of events came from letters written by Ingeborg Alix Prinzessin zu Schaumburg-Lippe, a female member of the SS-Helferinnenkorps to Kammler’s wife in 1951 and 1955.\n\nIn these, she affirmed that Kammler had said goodbye to her on 7 May 1945 in Prague, stating that the Americans were after him, had made him offers but that he had refused and that they would not \"get him alive\".\n\nOn the surface, the sworn testimony provided by SS Oberscharführer Kurt Preuk in 1948 certainly seems confirm that Kammler committed suicide on 9 May 1945.\n\nPreuk was a driver in Kammler’s entourage and knew him well.\n\nWhen he produced his sworn statement in 1948 Preuk claimed that he had been present on 9 May 1945 when Kammler shot himself during a break in the journey from Prague.\n\nHowever, in another sworn statement by Preuk made in 1959 as part of a death benefits case, he claimed that Kammler’s death had occurred “on or around 10 May 1945” and that he was not sure of the cause of death.\n\nThe situation was made even less clear when in 1965 Heinz Zeuner, a former SS SS Obersturmführer and another driver in the Kammler entourage, claimed to have been present when Kammler died and stated that his death occurred on 7th May 1945 and that Kammler killed himself by taking cyanide.\n\nIn 2012, German researchers using government records uncovered further fascinating information about Kammler, his alleged death and the drivers in his entourage.\n\nIt appears that in the Kammler group there was a third driver and one of Kammler’s longest serving aides, thirty-five year-old Oberscharführer Friedrich Baum.\n\nHowever, Baum had been badly wounded while driving one of Kammler’s staff cars when the partisan uprising in Prague erupted on 6 May 1945.\n\nInterviewed after the war, Heinz Zeuner claimed that he was present when the car was attacked [though Kammler was not] and described how Baum was shot in the left knee while driving, meaning that he was unable to use the accelerator.\n\nZeuner was able to reach over with his own left leg and operate the accelerator while Baum steered the car to safety.\n\nZeuner went to explain that Baum was taken to hospital in Prague but was later killed by partisans when the hospital was over-run a few days later.\n\nHowever, records show that on 23 May 1945 a thirty-five year old Army Oberfeldwebel [Sergeant] Friedrich Baum from the Berlin Motor Pool was admitted to a makeshift hospital in the lakeside town of Gmunden in Lower Austria.\n\nHospital records show that Baum had been wounded in the knee in Prague on 4 May, but that his leg had become infected during the long journey to Austria.\n\nHis leg was amputated in hospital but he died there on 29 May and was buried in grave No. 112 at the nearby military cemetery.\n\nThere are a number of problems with this story.\n\nFirst, Oberfeldwebel Friedrich Baum of the Berlin Motor Pool does not exist according to German Army records.\n\nGiven the reported date and location of Baum’s wound, it seems very likely that this was actually Oberscharführer Friedrich Baum of the SS.\n\nIt was certainly very common for SS troops at the end of the war to adopt army identification in order to avoid arrest, imprisonment and retribution.\n\nHowever, the wound to Baum’s leg is also a problem.\n\nAccounts from Prague are very clear that Baum was wounded in the left knee. But hospital records from Gmunden state that Oberfeldwebel Baum’s right knee was injured and that his right leg was subsequently amputated.\n\nThings got even more confused in 1967 when the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge [German War Graves Commission] reviewed the military cemetery in Gmunden as part of a national review and consolidation of war graves.\n\nThe plan was to erect uniform markers on graves and to consolidate the many small cemeteries into larger plots.\n\nWhen grave No. 112 was opened to exhume Baum’s body, it was found to be empty.\n\nWhen the cemetery was re-dedicated in 1987 the marker over grave 112 read “I.M. FELDW. FRIEDRICH BAUM, 06.21.1906 – 29.5.1945”.\n\nThe “I. M.” Stands for “In Memorium” and is generally used on a grave which is intended as a memorial but in which the body is not actually present.\n\nThe mystery surrounding the identity and death of Friedrich Baum has generated speculation that Kammler had adopted the papers and identity of his dead driver, that hospital records of his wound and death were falsified and that he escaped from Gmunden by adopting yet another false identity.\n\nThere have also been reports of sightings of Kammler in Argentina after the war and suggestions that he actually surrendered to American forces much later than the date of his supposed death, though none of these have ever been confirmed.\n\nAuthor Bernd Ruland, in his 1969 book \"Wernher von Braun: Mein Leben für die Raumfahrt\", reports an altogether different account of Kammler's death.\n\nAccording to Ruland, Kammler arrived in Prague by aircraft on 4 May 1945, following which he and 21 SS men defended a Bunker against an attack by more than 500 Czech resistance fighters on 9 May.\n\nDuring the attack, Kammler's aide-de-camp Sturmbannführer Starck shot Kammler to prevent him from falling into enemy hands.\n\nThis version can reportedly be traced to Walter Dornberger, who in turn is said to have heard it from eyewitnesses.\n\nPost-war search for Kammler\n\nUS occupation forces conducted various inquiries into Kammler’s whereabouts, beginning with the headquarters of 12th Army ordering a complete inventory of all personnel involved in missile production on 21 May 1945.\n\nThis resulted in the creation of a file for Kammler, stating that he was possibly in Munich. The CIC noted that he had been seen shortly prior to the arrival of US troops in Oberjoch.\n\nThe Combined Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee [CIOS] in London ordered a search for him in early July 1945.\n\n12th Army replied that he was last seen on 8 or 9 April in the Harz region. In August, Kammler's name made \"List 13\" of the UN for Nazi war criminals.\n\nOnly in 1948 did the CIOS receive the information that Kammler reportedly fled to Prague and had committed suicide.\n\nOriginal blueprints of Kammler’s major projects were later found in the personal property of Samuel Goudsmit, the scientific leader of the Alsos Mission.\n\nIn 1949 a report written by one Oskar Packe on Kammler was filed by the US Denazification office in Hesse.\n\nThe report stated that Kammler had been arrested by US troops on 9 May 1945 at the Messerschmitt works at Oberammergau.\n\nHowever, Kammler and some other senior SS personnel had managed to escape in the direction of Austria or Italy.\n\nPacke disbelieved the reports about a suicide, as these were \"refuted by the detailed information from the CIC\" about arrest and escape.\n\nA CIC report from April 1946 listed Kammler among SS officers known to be outside Germany and considered to be of special interest to the CIC.\n\nIn mid-July 1945, the head of the Gmunden CIC office, Major Morrisson interviewed an unnamed German on the issue of a numbered account associated with construction sites for plane and missile production formerly run by the SS.\n\nA report published years later, in late 1947 or early 1948, stated that only Kammler and two other persons had access to the account.\n\nThe report also said that \"shortly after the occupation, Hans Kammler appeared at CIC Gmunden and gave a statement on operations at Ebensee\".\n\nThe CIC notes on the interview give no name, but the interviewee must have been one of the three people with access to the account.\n\nAside from Kammler, one was known to have left Austria in May 1945, the other was in a POW camp during July.\n\nFinally, Donald W. Richardson, a former OSS special agent involved in the Alsos Mission, claimed to be \"the man who brought Kammler to the US\".\n\nShortly before he died, Richardson reportedly told his sons about his experience during and after the war, including Operation Paperclip.\n\nAccording to them, Richardson claimed to have supervised Kammler until 1947.\n\nKammler was supposedly \"interned at a place of maximum security, with no hope, no mercy and without seeing the light of day until he hanged himself\".\n\nPossible last documented independent testimonies\n\nA purported section of a wartime diary, relating to the surrender of the mountain resort town Garmisch-Partenkirchen to Allied troops, mentions Kammler and his staff.\n\nAccording to this account, Kammler and what the author refers to as his staff of some 600 people, with \"good quality\" cars and trucks arrived in Oberammergau [north of Garmisch-Partenkirchen] on 22 April 1945.\n\nThis arrival had been badly received and the local authorities had several arguments with Kammler himself.\n\nThese conflicts are mentioned in the entries for 23 and 25 April.\n\nThe last reference, implicating only Kammler's \"staff\", comes on the night of 28 April – an Oberleutnant Burger reports that they had gone on the same night that American forces began storming Oberammergau, forcing their way to Garmisch and Austria.\n\nAgoston had established what no other researcher has managed to before or since\n\nThe unique information Agoston had came directly from SS Colonel Wilhelm Voss who had become \"Kammler's alter ego in the administration of the special projects group\".\n\nAs Kammler was in charge of all the secret weapons operations, Voss was certainly in position to know deep secrets known only to the Nazi elite in the highly compartmentalized military system.\n\nAgoston, who worked as an air photo interpreter and foreign correspondent during wartime, \"ran into Voss\" when he was in Germany to cover the Nuremberg war crimes trials.\n\nVoss then took shelter in Agoston's house, where he would tell the reporter everything.\n\nFrom those interviews conducted in 1949, Agoston learned of the deep black projects, the secrecy of which was beyond any other secret military project.\n\nThis was the \"most advanced high-technology research and development center within the Third Reich\":\n\nWhile Kammler [in charge of Nazi secret weapons projects] carried out his job to the letter, churning out the rockets and jet aircraft that Hitler hoped would turn the tide against the Allies in the closing weeks of the war, he also set up, unbeknownst to anyone connected with those projects, a top secret research center tasked with the development of follow-on technology, a place where work on \"second-generation\" secret weapons was already well advanced.\n\nWhat Kammler had established was a \"special projects office\" a forerunner of the entity that had been run by the bright young colonels of the USAF's stealth program in the 1970s and 1980s: A place of vision, where imagination could run free, unfettered by the restraints of accountability.\n\nExactly the kind of place, in fact, you'd expect to find anti-gravity technology, if such an impossible thing existed.\n\nVoss described the activities of the scientists [in this secret operation] as beyond any technology that had appeared by the end of the war - working on weapon systems that made the V-1 and the V-2 look pedestrian.\n\nOn 23 March 1942, Heinrich Himmler issued a letter which approved the establishment of a research and development center of the Waffen SS at the Skoda Works and the weapons plants Brno according to Hitler's orders.\n\nThis was the beginning of the activities of the so-called SS-think tank, also called the Kammler Group.\n\nThere, it developed a variety of activities and secret projects, many of which have remained largely unknown.\n\nIt is well known, however, that one of the tasks of the Kammler Group included a missile test program in an SS-led research center in Pilsen.\n\nSome of these activities were related to the order from Hitler to Kammler, to accomplish the construction of an underground launch site for testing a smaller long-range rocket, which was intended as a prototype of an intercontinental ballistic weapon.\n\nThis missile, may have been the V-101.\n\nUnder this designation Dr. Büdewald and Dr. Teichmann 1944 began in Branch Příbram of the Skoda company with the development of a solid-propellant rocket.\n\nThis three-stage rocket had a length of 30 m and 2.8 m diameter and weighed 140 tons. It is known that the first-stage powder engine was designed for a thrust of 100 tons and its theoretical range was 1,800 km at a maximum altitude of 200 km. to ensure that all European destinations would fall within the range of V-101.\n\nApparently, this performance was much greater than specified in Fritz Hahn's book \"Weapons and Secret Weapons of the German Army\".\n\nWe know virtually nothing about the true performance of this V-101 solid rocket because the project documents for this development were seized by the Americans, and have not shown up to date, and there are no documents or pictures of the V-101, although in a document from the former GDR, it is stated that the V-101 has been fully developed in the Skoda plant in Pribran, and tested successfully in Rudisleben, on 16 March 1945 in a launch towards northern Norway.\n\nWith a 12-kilogram homing system from Siemens, the target was missed by only 6 meters, at a distance of over 2000 kilometers. Due to its solid drive, the V-101 was also better suitable, as opposed to the V2, for use in launching silos. ,\n\nFurther proof of the V-101's existence is an American secret report of 19 January 1945 dealing with an estimate of the expected German weapons development in that year. Among other things, it is mentioned, that it was known that there were larger rockets than the V2, and that these might show up in smaller numbers during the following year.\n\nThey would, however, have a much larger warhead than the V2. The size of the new rocket was estimated as 68 feet [compared to 45 feet for the V2] indicated, however, the A-a9/A-10 also can not have been indicated.\n\nThe \"Amerika\" rocket could only carry the same 1 ton explosive charge as the V2 and had a length of 84.7 feet [25.8 m].\n\nIt must therefore be asked whether besides the A-9 / A-10 \"'Amerika\" rocket, at EMW Peenemünde there was also the V-101 \"Europa\" rocket, at the SS Skoda works in Pilsen.\n\nCzech Episode of Nazi Rocket Science Uncovered by Historian\n\nChris Johnstoner\n\nRadio Praha\n\n29 June 2015\n\nGermany’s use of long range rockets towards the end of WWII in a desperate but vain attempt to turn around the tide of the war, is a well known episode in history.\n\nSo is the fact that many of the German experts were drafted in by the victors to help with the United States and Soviet rocket programmes.\n\nBut a late Czech chapter in the attempt to develop new super weapons and rockets is little known and still shrouded with questions.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNazi Germany could congratulate itself when it marched into what remained of the Czech Republic in March 1939.\n\nAs well as a large booty of arms and munitions from what was regarded as one of the best prepared armies in Europe, the Nazis also took possession of some impressive weapons producers, notably Škoda Plzeň and Zbrojovka Brno.\n\nBut while using the arms production capacity now on hand for the new wars on the horizon, the Nazis appeared slow to take advantage of the technical knowledge and research facilities that had been developed in Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nBut as WWII began to turn against the Nazis in the key year of 1943, they decided to try and get the most out of the Czech researchers, technicians, and scientists at their disposal and decided to group them together in a new research facility that would be set up at Příbram in buildings that had been used by the national mining authority.\n\nMichal Plavec, curator of the aviation collection at the National Technical Museum in Prague, has scoured archives in several countries to piece together the history of the research facility.\n\nHe takes up the story:\n\n“The Germans decided that it could be very bad to leave unused the capacity of Czech technicians and scientists and that is why they tried to renew the research institute which was under Škoda Plzeň.\n\n\"And that is why this was such a conglomerate of three factories Škoda Plzeň, and Zbrojovka Brno Explosia Semtín.\n\n\"And they were involved in mainly rocket research, artillery, and the production of armoured vehicles\".\n\nCo-operation\n\nHow willing the Czech co-operation was in this small part of the vast Hermann Göring armaments empire is difficult to tell.\n\nIt appears likely that Czech technicians and researchers were given small parts of larger projects to work on so that they did not have a full picture of the development work that they were working on.\n\nOne prominent Czech mathematician, František Čuřík, committed suicide in June 1944, according to some reports because he had been asked to work at the new institute on the ballistic computation of the V-2 missiles for the Nazi war effort.\n\nČuřík’s friends and colleagues said he saw no other way out to prevent himself from taking part in what he regarded as treason.\n\nOthers have questioned this interpretations of Čuřík’s death saying it was unlikely that he would be trusted by the Germans with such sensitive work and that they already had sufficient German experts of their own.\n\nIn any case, the real change in the Waffen-Union Skoda-Brunn establishment, as it was know in German, did not come until August 1944 when a 38-strong team of German rocket scientists and researchers were evacuated from West Prussia to Příbram to prevent their capture from the advancing Red Army.\n\nThey joined the existing staff which numbered just over 300.\n\nThe head of the German team was one of Germany’s top rocket scientists, Rolf Engel, an enthusiastic Nazi who also had the SS rank of Hauptsturmführer.\n\nEngel, together with a young and eventually more famous Wernher Von Braun, had been among a small group to develop German rocket science in the early 1930s.\n\nOne of his top assistants was the Swede Nils Werner Larsson.\n\nThe end of the war was fast approaching and by the Russians had already overrun the Germans’ main rocket research facilities at Peenemünde in early 1945 and most of their fixed launch sites.\n\nBut the research in Příbram continued.\n\nMichal Plavec continues:\n\n\"It was really at the end of the war and a lot of projects were left only on paper.\n\n\"But the significance was that when the war would be ended later then some of the projects on paper could be put into practice.\n\n\"I think that one of the most influential projects was the so-called V-101 rocket..\n\n\"It was a long distance rocket - its weight was 140 tons of which 100 tons were fuel.\n\n\"Its velocity was around 2,000 kilometers per hour with an altitude of some 200 kilometres and range of 1,800 kilometers\".\n\nCutting edge\n\nHowever megalomaniac the projects seemed in the background of the crumbling and shrinking Third Reich, Germany had invested massive resources in rocket science.\n\nIt is estimated that the sums far exceeded the US spending on developing the atomic bomb.\n\nAnd the scientists had become world leaders in a domain whose strategic significance was to become all too clear with the dawning of the nuclear era.\n\nThe Soviets and Allies by the end of the war were frantically seeking to grab all the documents and research and rocket equipment they could.\n\nMost of the German scientists faced the question of whom they should surrender to and divulge their secrets.\n\nOne worry widely shared was that fanatic Nazis might order all the scientists to be killed so that their secrets would die with them.\n\nMichal Plavec says many questions still remain unanswered.\n\n\"I suppose that much is still left. But we know for sure about two leading people in Versuchsamstalt Pribrams.\n\n\"Rolf Engel, who co-operated with the German professor Hermann Oberth who was the pioneer of German rocket science. Rolf Engel was involved in rocket science after WWII in France and then Egypt.\n\n\"And his Deputy Nils Werner Larsson, a Swede by nationality. He was probably involved in Soviet space rocket development and his life is still largely unknown for us\".\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nRolf Engel enjoyed a colourful career after the war.\n\nHe went on to become a consultant for the French national office for aeronautic studies and research from 1946 to 1952.\n\nThere followed a five year stint as a consultant with the Egyptian Airforce. He then went to work in Rome to help develop guided missile systems.\n\nAnd after 15 years abroad he returned to West Germany to head up the new space division of MBB, a company formed in part from the remains of the Messerschmitt plane maker.\n\nHe authored a book on the history of rockets and missiles and was an outspoken critic of détente.\n\nHe frequently warned of Soviet plans to take over the whole of Europe and specifically to get a lead in space from the construction of an orbiting battle station.\n\nNils Werner Larsson appears to be like a character from a Graham Greene novel.\n\nHe was arrested by Swedish police when he returned to the country he quit in 1943.\n\nHe was put on trial for first offering Swedish secrets to the Nazis, apparently the designs of a machine pistol, to gain credibility with them.\n\nAnd he was also charged with handing over Nazi secrets to the Allies at the end of the war.\n\nLarsson popped up again in 1960 at a press conference in Hamburg, Germany, sayng he had worked with Soviet and Warsaw Pact rocket science specialists between 1953 and 1959.\n\nHe claimed to have been a double agent for the West. He appeared to disappear soon afterwards.\n\nAnd the Czech scientists who co-operated on the original German programmes, however reluctantly?\n\nPlavec says that none of them appeared before the courts after the war whatever might have been the questions about their collaboration and they do not appear to have been tracked down to help with the US or Soviet rocket race either.\n\nThey were probably happy to get back to their past work and close the painful chapter on their Pribram war service.\n\nDuring the final phase of the war, Kammler was reportedly scheming to make a deal with the Americans, using his advanced weapons and specialists as leverage.\n\nBy 18 April 1945, Kammler had disappeared without trace.\n\nDid Kammler negotiate successfully with the U.S. to realize his escape from justice?\n\nThe fact that the U.S. official documents had virtually nothing on this central figure in the technological world of the Reich certainly hinted conversely that Kammler was very important to the U.S. and that the latter had something to hide about him.\n\nAdding to this suspicion was what Voss said about his interview with the U.S. Counter-Intelligence Corps.\n\nWhen Voss told the agents about Kammler's secret weapons program, he saw that the Americans were not surprised by it and therefore had to conclude that they somehow already had this information.\n\nVoss also noted that the agents were simply not interested in finding Kammler.\n\nAdditionally, it was found that \"there were dozens of high-ranking former SS or Party members that had never been called to account. They had simply disappeared. Many of them shared the distinction of having had access to highly advanced technology\".\n\nKammler was a ruthless and powerful SS officer who had committed numerous war crimes. Even Operation Paperclip would have had great trouble importing him into the United States.\n\nIt probably could have been done under extreme secrecy, but the operation would have been too risky and extensive to appear manageable to U.S. agents - unless, Kammler had something so spectacular that the Americans just had to have, perhaps some exotic technology developed in one of his top-secret projects.\n\nDr-Ing Hans Kammler had a bargaining chip with the Allies in \"Operation Sunrise\", the secret surrender negotiated by the OSS with elements of the SS.\n\nGeneralleutnant Walter Dornberger stated to General Johannes Fink that Kammler had been ordered by the Führer not to let Braun, Dornberger and the 450 scientists and technicians at Peenemünde fall into Anglo-American hands but to liquidate them all beforehand.\n\nIt was a huge risk to Kammler's own personal safety to evacuate all the Peenemünde staff in April 1945 to Oberammergau, Bavaria, contrary to Hitler's orders.\n\nWhy else would Kammler do so unless it was a bargaining chip for negotiations with the OSS [Operation Sunrise].\n\nMembers of Kammler's staff claimed he was still alive at Jacin in Czechoslovakia late in April 1945.\n\nEnter into the picture a Junkers Ju-290 A-5 aircraft with constructor's number 110178.\n\nThis aircraft was withdrawn from Luftwaffe service and rebuilt at Tempelhof into a civil aircraft in September 1944. It was given Deutsche Lufthansa markings and civil serial as D-AITR \"Bayern\". Conversion was completed October 1944.\n\nFlughauptman Paul Sluzalek flew this aircraft from Prag to exile in Barcelona on 26 April 1945. It had a number of SS personnel aboard whom the Spanish have always refused to identify.\n\nWas Kammler a passenger with the blessings of the OSS?\n\nBoth SS Lt Gen Hans Kammler and Adolf Eichmann were close to Prag about this same time and both disappeared.\n\nAlthough Eichmann is supposed to have escaped overland to Genoa, there is a very clear possibility that Kammler could have flown out of Prague and just maybe Eichman was with him on that Ju-290.\n\nWhile everybody has speculated on the fate of Martin Bormann, the real scandal must be OSS dealings with Kammler."
