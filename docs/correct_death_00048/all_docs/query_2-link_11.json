        "text": "He returned to Germany in 1927 and was elected to the Reichstag as one of the first Nazi representatives in 1928. From this position, he was able to block other contenders to the chancellorship, paving the way for Hitler's appointment to the role in 1933. Goering helped Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plan the early concentration camps for political opponents and also led the cleansing of Prussia. This saw supposed Communist elements in the military and police of the region being purged and replaced with loyal Nazi members of the Sturmabteilung (SA), a Nazi paramilitary group. Goering used the Reichstag fire (supposedly set by these communists) as a pretext for these actions and others that eliminated or imprisoned political opponents.\n\nHe became Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe (the German Air Force) in 1935 and was responsible for its rapid expansion in the late 1930s. He was also in charge of an economic plan for the Reich as the Director of the Four Year Plan, giving him near-absolute control over the German economy. Additionally, Goering became Hitler's acknowledged successor on September 1, 1939. It was Goering who gave Reinhard Heydrich and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), an intelligence wing at the time, the order to carry out a \"total solution to the Jewish Question\" in 1941.\n\nHe was one of the few high-ranking members of the Nazi Party to face trial at Nuremberg after the war (other leaders took their own lives either before being captured or before they could be tried). The International Military Tribunal (IMT) found him guilty of all four possible counts at the trial. He was sentenced to death but died by suicide the night before his scheduled execution.\n\nAs the head of the Luftwaffe, he was in charge of the air campaigns against Poland, France, Britain, and later Russia. His failures in Britain and Russia caused Goering to lose favor with Hitler. As the war progressed, he became increasingly detached from reality, refusing to accept reports of losses, refusing to allow for new technology, and hiding Allied tactics from other leaders to avoid changes in the Luftwaffe. In addition, the war's progression saw Goering steadily losing more and more political favor.\n\nAt the end of the war, when Hitler declared that he would stay in the bunker until the end, a mentally ill Goering believed that this meant that Hitler was abdicating. He requested to be put in power but was instead stripped of all titles. He was captured by the American Seventh Army on May 9, 1945.\n\nUnlike other high-ranking Nazis, Goering did not take his own life rather than be captured. As a result, he was the highest-ranking official to be put on trial at Nuremberg in 1946. His was also the first trial. Despite a visible physical decline, Goering acted more as he had during the early days of the war while in Nuremberg. This could be due to his inability to access drugs while imprisoned; he had struggled with addiction intermittently since the incident after the Beer Hall Putsch. At the trials, it was noted that Goering had a controlling personality, which meant he overshadowed other defendants. He appeared to have adopted an attitude that saw him still dictate to other prisoners and seemed to carry the belief that he would become a German martyr and be immortalized in history due to his self-noted heroism.\n\nThe IMT in Nuremberg ruled that Goering was guilty of crimes against peace; crimes against humanity; war crimes; and conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The Tribunal found no mitigating circumstances for his actions. He was sentenced to execution by hanging, which was to be carried out on October 15, 1946. However, just hours before his scheduled execution, Goering took his own life in his cell.\n\nGoering on trial at Nuremberg\n\nAs the last surviving member of the Nazi high command, Goering's testimony played a crucial role in laying out the horror of Nazi atrocities. He tried to blame his actions on others, although Goering himself came up with many ideas that were then carried out by Himmler rather than Goering. It was evident in his testimony at Nuremberg and in those of others that he had knowingly played a key role in the mass murder of millions of Jews, civilian bombings, and in using slave labor within the Reich, to name a few of the specific offenses cited in his sentencing report. As the first of the Nuremberg Trials, his trial set an example for other (and future) war criminals.\n\nWhile some have argued that Goering was used as a symbol for the entire Nazi high command at the trials because he was the only one left to bear any punishment. It is clear that Goering was a war criminal and that he did commit crimes against peace and humanity. That he conspired to commit these crimes as well as part of his own admission that he planned many of the Nazi's worst actions against Jews and other political enemies. As the International Military Tribunal put it, \"his guilt is unique in its enormity. The record discloses no excuses for this man.\"\n\nHermann Goering was the Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, Director of the Four Year Plan, (an economic plan), and the declared successor of Adolf Hitler. He was born an aristocrat in 1893 and went on to become a highly decorated fighter pilot during World War I. He joined the Nazi Party in 1922 and participated in the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. Treatment for the injuries he received at this time led to a drug addiction that he struggled with for the rest of his life. He was elected to the Reichstag in 1928 and helped pave the way for Hitler to be made Chancellor in 1933. Goering used his background as a professional politician to help secure the diplomatic acquisition of the Sudetenland and the Austrian Anschluss in 1938.\n\nGoering was a key planner of the concentration camps along with other Nazi officials. As head of the Luftwaffe, Goering was responsible for the bombing campaigns in Poland, France, Britain, and Russia. When the last two of these were unsuccessful, Goering lost political favor with Hitler. Their relationship ended in 1945 when Hitler had Goering arrested. Goering was captured in May 1945 and was the only member of the Nazi high command to be tried at Nuremberg. He was found guilty of crimes against peace, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. He took his own life just hours before his sentence of execution by hanging was carried out."
