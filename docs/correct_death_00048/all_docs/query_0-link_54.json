The 1990s, Does It Bring a Flood of Memories to Ya Ninetiesmaniacs? The last decade of the Second Millennium is caught with an open container as the Age of Modernism (begun after the French Revolution) ends, and the Age of Postmodernism (Sin is In) (Isaiah 5:20) begins, and not only are all consenting adult lifestyles to be accepted as equally valid, but it can get you thrown in jail to criticize and hurt somebody's feelings, where a PC judge will be waiting to do you, as My Way American Baby Boomers begin ruling the country, creating a PC Regime, while their coddled but numerically challenged kids reach adulthood suffering from a \"Generation X\" identity crisis, not having the power to make waves like their parents, but feeding on postmodernist views so they can still call them ignorant prejudiced bastards? Maybe the feeling that they don't fill their parents' shoes is why they wear baggy clothes? Millennium Fever is now having its greatest effect over the most people ever? No wonder godless scientific Communism crumbles like toast as its people pull the rug from under its feet? Not that envy of the opulent, interesting lifestyle of Westerners as seen on MTV doesn't help? The kaput Soviet Union fractures into an alphabet soup of new country leaders, later called the Crazy Nineties? In Africa Nelson Mandela is freed after 27 years, while Hutu and Tutsi go ape in Rwanda-Burundi? The decade when Saddam Hussein has his day? A good decade for women in U.S. politics, especially Jewish women? The good ole days of rock and roll fade away into the sunset with phony commercialized acts? Hitler's birthday gets celebrated in sick macabre acts of violence?\n\nCountry Leader From To United States of America George Herbert Walker Bush (1924-) Jan. 20, 1989 Jan. 20, 1993 United Kingdom Margaret Hilda Thatcher (1925-2013) May 4, 1979 Nov. 28, 1990 United Kingdom Queen Elizabeth II (1926-) Feb. 6, 1952 Soviet Union Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev (1931-2022) Mar. 11, 1985 Dec. 25, 1991 People's Republic of China Jiang Zemin (1926-) June 24, 1989 Nov. 15, 2002 Canada Martin Brian Mulroney (1939-) Sept. 17, 1984 June 25, 1993 France Francois Maurice Adrien Marie Mitterrand (1916-96) May 21, 1981 May 17, 1995 West Germany Helmut Josef Michael Kohl (1930-) Oct. 1, 1982 Oct. 27, 1998 Spain King Juan Carlos I (1938-) Nov. 22, 1975 June 19, 2014 Mexico Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1948-) Dec. 1, 1988 Nov. 30, 1994 Egypt Hosni Mubarak (1928-) Oct. 14, 1981 Feb. 11, 2011 Israel Yitzhak Shamir (1915-2012) Oct. 20, 1986 July 13, 1992 Iraq Saddam Hussein (1937-2006) July 16, 1979 Apr. 9, 2003 Kuwait Sheikh Jaber III al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah (1926-2006) Dec. 31, 1977 Jan. 15, 2006 Papacy John Paul II (1920-2005) Oct. 16, 1978 Apr. 2, 2005 U.N. Javier Perez de Cuellar y de la Guerra of Peru (1920-) Jan. 1, 1982 Dec. 31, 1991\n\n1990 - The Prisoner #466 Nelson Mandela Year?
