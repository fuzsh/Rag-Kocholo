        "text": "Edda Goering was practically a princess of the Third Reich. As the only daughter of Hermann Goering, the leader of the Luftwaffe and Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man and potential successor, Ms. Goering was a national celebrity from the day she was born.\n\nHer early childhood resembled a fairy tale. She grew up in Carinhall, an estate in the countryside replete with priceless works of art and a child-size play palace. Hitler was her godfather, and her birthday inspired national celebrations.\n\nHer youthful idyll ended when the Allies defeated Germany in 1945. Goering, who had been convicted of war crimes and other charges at Nuremberg, committed suicide with a cyanide capsule in his cell hours before he was to be executed in 1946. Edda was 8 at the time.\n\nMs. Goering, who defended her father’s legacy for the rest of her life, died on Dec. 21 in Munich. She was 80. A spokesman for the municipal administrative authority for the City of Munich confirmed the death only this week. He provided no other details. German news reports said that only a few close associates had been informed of her death."
