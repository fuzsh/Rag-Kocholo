        "text": "Martin Bormann\n\nTried in absentia (not present in the courtroom, but still prosecuted).\n\nHess's Chief of Staff (1933-41). Head of party chancellery. Bormann controlled all legislation, party promotions and appointments, and the personal access of others to Hitler. He disappeared shortly after Hitler’s death. German authorities officially declared him dead after exhuming his presumed remains in 1972. Bormann was sentenced in absentia.\n\nKarl Donitz\n\nIntelligence Quotient (IQ): 138\n\nDonitz oversaw the creation of the German U-boat fleet in the 1930s, thus violating the Treaty of Versailles. As the fleet’s commander, he conducted the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II, then served as commander in chief of the navy (1943–45). He succeeded Adolf Hitler as Germany’s leader in the last few days of the war and executed Germany’s surrender to the Allies. Convicted of war crimes at the Nürnberg trials, he served 10 years in prison. Died in 1981.\n\nHermann Goring\n\nIntelligence Quotient (IQ): 138\n\nHeld numerous posts, established the Gestapo & head of the German air force (Luftwaffe).\n\nGöring held numerous posts, including minister of the interior in Prussia, where he established the Gestapo. He also became head of the German air force (Luftwaffe) and minister of economic affairs. After the Luftwaffe failed to win the Battle of Britain, Göring lost face and semiretired to his country estate, where he displayed the vast art collection he had confiscated from Jews in occupied countries. In 1946 he was condemned to death at the Nürnberg trials but committed suicide by taking a poison capsule.\n\nRudolf Hess\n\nIntelligence Quotient (IQ): 120\n\nHess wounded as a fighter pilot in World War I, was a devoted and able colleague of Adolf Hitler from the early days of the Nazi Party and was designated third in succession to him in 1939. In 1941, without any authorization from Hitler, a person calling himself Rudolf Hess parachuted himself into Scotland in order to negotiate peace between Britain and Germany through the Duke of Hamilton, whom he claimed to know. The British made him a prisoner of war and he was sentenced to life imprisonment at the postwar Nuremberg trial. The Russians affected to believe that he wanted a peace with the west because Hitler was about to move east. This Rudolf Hess died, allegedly by his own hand, in Spandau prison. It is uncertain, perhaps unlikely, that he was the real Hess. His chief British interrogator had doubts and he lacked the disfiguring and indelible wound scars which the real Hess had acquired in World War I."
