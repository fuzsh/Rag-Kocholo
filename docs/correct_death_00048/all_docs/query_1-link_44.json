        "text": "No way, unless the Soviets deliberately set him up as a thorn in the West's side (or possibly vice versa) and blocked a death penalty; however, the Allies' belief that he was the most dangerous Nazi proved itself by the strength of his personality and presence at Nuremberg once off the narcotics.\n\nThere's a reason Goering Reich AH's tend to work out fairly well for the Germans, at least compared to OTL.\n\nSay Hermann Goering, while at Nuremberg, tries to pull a Speer and tries to convince the trial to spare him the death penalty.\n\nIs there any way he could have made it happen?\n\nSpeer didn't convince anyone of anything. The Allies found his bullshit useful for propaganda purposes, so they let him off easy.\n\nAlso, Speer was lucky in that the real evidence of his complicity was found long after both his sentencing and his death.\n\nHe also had a rather convenient scapegoat in Fritz Sauckel. With his endless list of offices, who would Goering have?\n\nWhat was that evidence exactly? I knew the guy was guilty as all get out but I didn’t know they finally managed to come up with a smoking gun.\n\nHm, remove his autograph from the invitation and the follow up protocol of the Wannsee conference and I can actually see him getting off with a life sentence like Hess.\n\nHess only got life imprisonment because he wasn't found guilty of war crimes or crimes against humanity. This was because he left Germany before the invasion of the Soviet Union or the start of the Final Solution. By contrast, Goering was Hitler's second in command until the bitter end, meaning that there's no way he didn't know about the Holocaust or other German war crimes. And even if Goering's autograph is removed from the invitation and follow-up protocol to the Wannsee Conference, there's still the letter he wrote to Heydrich ordering him to find a final solution, as well as the multitude of evidence that he was involved in other war crimes.\n\nSuppose he had something of value in exchange for his neck, much like some of Unit 731 did. Sarin gas secrets? The location of something of importance to the nuclear program? Even where some great art is hidden away for the ages. If Hitler killed hinself somewhere else, or escaped, the location of his body or him might be enough. (Or might not...)\n\nWhat was that evidence exactly? I knew the guy was guilty as all get out but I didn’t know they finally managed to come up with a smoking gun.\n\nSeveral historians have shredded his post war memoir as him changing the facts by citing several clear inconsistencies between his actions during and after the war. Albert Speer: The End of a Myth was one of the first, although this was two years after Speer's death.\n\nThe big nail in the coffin I believe surfaced just a few years ago, which was a speech by Himmler that referenced the Final solution and mentioned Speer explicitly. Even mentioning he was in attendance of this speech.\n\nSeveral historians have shredded his post war memoir as him changing the facts by citing several clear inconsistencies between his actions during and after the war.

Even mentioning he was in attendance of this speech.\n\nAh ok. I was wondering if new documents had come light or something; that would do it. If that had come to light at Speer’s trial, do you think they would have hanged him? Perhaps given Hess a roommate for the rest of both of their lives at Spandau?\n\nIf that had come to light at Speer’s trial, do you think they would have hanged him?\n\nGenerally, and even given the relevations I've read about him, I wouldn't say Speer deserved death. I could certainly see life being fitting.\n\nOf course this is someone reading it 70 years on. At the time I could see Speer's lies not being believed earning him the rope\n\nAt least some of Speer's lies were incredibly obvious to anyone with half a brain, e.g. his ridiculous \"assasination attempt.\" (I forget who it was who quipped \"the second most powerful man in the Reich couldn't find a ladder\"). He served a useful purpose: \"Look at this guy. He was Hitler's best friend, even HE was disgusted by how evil Hitler was and washed his hands of him.\" It's the same reason why the Rommel mythos and other Clean Wermacht stuff were pushed- the idea that \"good people\" served even at the highest levels of Hitler's government was useful for justifying the fact that a whole lot of ex-Nazis were used to rebuild the German state postwar.\n\nThe big nail in the coffin I believe surfaced just a few years ago, which was a speech by Himmler that referenced the Final solution and mentioned Speer explicitly. Even mentioning he was in attendance of this speech.\n\nSpeer possibly being at Himmler’s Posen speech actually came out when he was alive. He managed to refute it to some degree...\n\n...however a letter by Speer admitting he was there was found a few years ago."
