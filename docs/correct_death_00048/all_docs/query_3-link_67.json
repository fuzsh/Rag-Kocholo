        "text": "Volodymyr Zelensky spoke of the Berlin Wall to the German Bundestag, the ruins of Verdun to the French Assemblée Nationale, Winston Churchill to the British House of Commons, and Pearl Harbor and 9/11 to the US Congress. The Ukrainian president likes to draw historical parallels, choosing references that resonate with his audience of the moment, to raise international public awareness of Ukraine's fate.\n\nHis visit to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, on May 4 was no exception to the rule. That day, he cited the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, before which 21 Nazi leaders appeared from October 18, 1945, to October 1, 1946, to add emphasis to his call for the creation of a \"special tribunal\" to judge the \"crime of aggression\" committed against his country by Vladimir Putin's Russia.\n\nIt's an idea also promoted by leading jurists such as the French-British human rights lawyer Philippe Sands, whose book East West Street (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2017) is partly devoted to the Nuremberg trial.\n\nWhy the \"crime of aggression\"? Because it's the one that \"led to all of these crimes,\" the \"start of evil, the primary crime,\" explained Zelensky that day, before quoting this passage from the Nuremberg judgment: \"To initiate a war of aggression is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\" By deciding to prosecute the Russian leadership for the \"crime of aggression,\" Zelensky insisted, the international community would not only be doing justice to Ukraine, it would also be making peace for the world. \"This is our historical responsibility – of modern generations – to make the total punishment for aggression inevitable; to prevent the aggression against our country and also new wars,\" he stated. \"There are potential aggressors in the world. And the world must seek justice to see peace fully secured.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president did not make his speech up as he went along. In fact, his words were virtually the same as those uttered on the second day of the Nuremberg trials by the chief United States prosecutor, Robert Jackson, during the reading of the indictment: \"The ultimate step in avoiding periodic wars, which are inevitable in a system of international lawlessness, is to make statesmen responsible to law. And let me make clear that while this law is first applied against German aggressors, the law includes, and if it is to serve a useful purpose it must condemn aggression by any other nations, including those which sit here now in judgment [USA, UK, France, USSR]. We are able to do away with domestic tyranny and violence and aggression by those in power against the rights of their own people only when we make all men answerable to the law. This trial represents mankind's desperate effort to apply the discipline of the law to statesmen who have used their powers of state to attack the foundations of the world's peace and to commit aggressions against the rights of their neighbors.\""
