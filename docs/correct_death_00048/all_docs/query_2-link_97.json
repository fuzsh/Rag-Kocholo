        "text": "The Nuremberg Trials were a series of trials that occurred in post-World War II Germany to provide a platform for justice against accused Nazi war criminals. The first attempt to punish the perpetrators was conducted by the International Military Tribunal (IMT) in the German city of Nuremberg, beginning on November 20, 1945.\n\nOn trial were 24 of Nazi Germany’s major war criminals, including Hermann Goering, Martin Bormann, Julius Streicher, and Albert Speer. Of the 22 that were ultimately tried, 12 were sentenced to death.\n\nThe term “Nuremberg Trials” would eventually include this original trial of Nazi leaders as well as 12 subsequent trials that lasted until 1948.\n\nThe Holocaust & Other War Crimes\n\nDuring World War II, the Nazis perpetrated an unprecedented reign of hatred against Jews and others deemed undesirable by the Nazi state. This time period, known as the Holocaust, resulted in the deaths of six million Jews and five million others, including Roma and Sinti (Gypsies), the handicapped, Poles, Russian POWs, Jehovah’s witnesses, and political dissidents.\n\nVictims were interned in concentration camps and also killed in death camps or by other means, such as mobile killing squads. A small number of individuals survived these horrors but their lives were changed forever by the horrors inflicted upon them by the Nazi State.\n\nCrimes against individuals deemed undesirable were not the only charges being levied against the Germans in the post-war era. World War II saw an additional 50 million civilians killed throughout the war and many countries blamed the German military for their deaths. Some of these deaths were part of the new “total war tactics,” yet others were specifically targeted, such as the massacre of Czech civilians in Lidice and the death of Russian POWs at the Katyn Forest Massacre.\n\nShould There Be a Trial or Just Hang Them?\n\nIn the months following liberation, many military officers and Nazi officials were held in prisoner of war camps throughout the four Allied zones of Germany. The countries that administrated those zones (Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States) began to discuss the best way to handle the post-war treatment of those who were suspected of war crimes.\n\nWinston Churchill, the Prime Minister of England, initially felt that all those who were alleged to have committed war crimes should be hanged. The Americans, French, and Soviets felt that trials were necessary and worked to convince Churchill of the importance of these proceedings.\n\nOnce Churchill assented, a decision was made to move forward with the establishment of the International Military Tribunal that would be convened in the city of Nuremberg in the fall of 1945.\n\nThe Major Players of the Nuremberg Trial\n\nThe Nuremberg Trials officially began with the first proceedings, which opened on November 20, 1945. The trial was held in the Palace of Justice in the German city of Nuremberg, which had played host to major Nazi Party rallies during the Third Reich. The city was also the namesake of the infamous 1935 Nuremberg race laws levied against Jews.\n\nThe International Military Tribunal was composed of a judge and an alternate judge from each of the four main Allied Powers. The judges and alternates were as follows:\n\nUnited States – Frances Biddle (Main) and John Parker (Alternate)\n\nBritain – Sir Geoffrey Lawrence (Main) (President Judge) and Sir Norman Birkett (Alternate)\n\nFrance – Henri Donnedieu de Vabres (Main) and Robert Falco (Alternate)\n\nSoviet Union –Major General Iona Nikitchenko (Main) and Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Volchkov (Alternate)\n\nThe prosecution was led by U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Robert Jackson. He was joined by Britain’s Sir Hartley Shawcross, France’s Francois de Menthon (eventually replaced by Frenchman Auguste Champetier de Ribes), and the Soviet Union’s Roman Rudenko, a Soviet Lieutenant-General.\n\nJackson’s opening statement set the somber yet progressive tone for the trial and its unprecedented nature. His brief opening address spoke of the importance of the trial, not only for the restoration of Europe but also for its lasting impact on the future of justice in the world. He also mentioned the need to educate the world about the horrors perpetrated during the war and felt that the trial would provide a platform to accomplish this task.\n\nEach defendant was permitted to have representation, either from a group of court-appointed defense attorneys or a defense attorney of the defendant’s choosing.\n\nEvidence vs. The Defense\n\nThis first trial lasted a total of ten months. The prosecution built its case largely around evidence compiled by the Nazis themselves, as they had carefully documented many of their misdeeds. Witnesses to the atrocities were also brought to the stand, as were the accused.\n\nThe defense cases were primarily centered around the concept of the “Fuhrerprinzip” (Fuhrer principle). According to this concept, the accused were following orders issued by Adolf Hitler, and the penalty for not following those orders was death. Since Hitler, himself, was no longer alive to invalidate these claims, the defense was hoping that it would carry weight with the judicial panel.\n\nSome of the defendants also claimed that the tribunal itself had no legal standing due to its unprecedented nature.\n\nThe Charges\n\nAs the Allied Powers worked to gather evidence, they also had to determine who should be included in the first round of proceedings. It was ultimately determined that 24 defendants would be charged and put on trial beginning in November 1945; these were some of the most notorious of Nazi’s war criminals.\n\nThe accused would be indicted on one or more of the following counts:\n\n1. Crimes of Conspiracy: The accused was alleged to have participated in the creation and/or implementation of a joint plan or conspired to assist those in charge of executing a joint plan whose goal involved crimes against the peace.\n\n2. Crimes Against the Peace: The accused was alleged to have committed acts that including planning for, preparation of, or initiation of aggressive warfare.\n\n3. War Crimes: The accused allegedly violated previously established rules of warfare, including the killing of civilians, POWs, or malicious destruction of civilian property.\n\n4. Crimes Against Humanity: The accused was alleged to have committed acts of deportation, enslavement, torture, murder, or other inhumane acts against civilians before or during the war.\n\nDefendants on Trial and Their Sentences\n\nA total of 24 defendants were originally slated to be put on trial during this initial Nuremberg trial, but only 22 were actually tried (Robert Ley had committed suicide and Gustav Krupp von Bohlen was deemed unfit to stand trial). Of the 22, one wasn’t in custody; Martin Bormann (Nazi Party Secretary) was charged in absentia. (It was later discovered that Bormann had died in May 1945.)\n\nAlthough the list of defendants was long, two key individuals were missing. Both Adolf Hitler and his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, had committed suicide as the war was coming to an end. It was decided that there was enough evidence regarding their deaths, unlike Bormann’s, that they were not placed on trial.\n\nThe trial resulted in a total of 12 death sentences, all of which were administered on October 16, 1946, with one exception -- Herman Goering committed suicide by cyanide the night before the hangings were to take place. Three of the accused were sentenced to life in prison. Four individuals were sentenced to jail terms ranging from ten to twenty years. An additional three individuals were acquitted of all charges."
