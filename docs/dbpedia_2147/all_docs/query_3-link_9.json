        "text": "There might be a way to reduce the paperwork.\n\nWe have two different things here:\n\n- the copyright license on the photo's to allow the models and their association to use the photo's (to be signed by each photographer), and\n\n- the model release so the photographers can publish the photo's for their uses (to be signed by each model, and note that the martial arts\n\nclub might ALSO need a release from each model to publish the photo's...)\n\nIn both cases, those rights can be transferred through representatives, as far as I know. Might that be the solution to reduce the paperwork?\n\nWhat I mean is something along the lines of:\n\nhave someone represent the photographers, and have the martial arts club represent the models;\n\neach photographers signs with their representative, each model signs with the club,\n\nfinal contract signed between club and representative.\n\nIf the camera club is willing, they might make a good representative for the photographers (being an independent legal person?)\n\nWhen you deliver the photo's, what format are you going to use? Prints are nice for the models, but more difficult to use for publicity.\n\nFiles are easy to use, but less attractive for the models... It's something that might need to be specified in the photographers' contract,\n\nesp. if some are reluctant to provide pictures (for me that would be a reason to exclude those photographers from the shoot, by the way:\n\nthey get the models' time for free, and would be able to use the photo's, which does represent a value as well)\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, and don't know Canadian law, so to be sure ask a local lawyer that knows those laws in case of doubt\n\n(such advise is not necessarily expensive)\n\n@Colin: when the photographers start touching the models w/o permission, I don't think you need to worry about the models in this case.\n\nBetter duck fast to avoid the low-flying photographers though"
