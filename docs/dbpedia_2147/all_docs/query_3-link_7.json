        "text": "TE WHAEA O TE MOTU (MOTHER OF THE NATION)\n\nDame Whina Cooper ONZ DBE\n\n1895 - 1994\n\nTe Rārawa\n\nOn September 14, 1975 at the age of 80, a frail but passionately articulate Dame Whina led 50 land protestors from Te Hāpua in the far north on a 1000km hikoi to Wellington. Her words \"Not one more acre of Māori land\" came to represent the struggle for Māori land rights. More than 5000 protestors arrived at the steps of Parliament on October 13.\n\nDame Whina was born Hohepine (Josephine) Te Wake at Te Karaka in northern Hokianga. The first child of Heremia Te Wake, a leader of Ngāti Manawa, a hapu of Te Kaitutae and Te Rarawa, and Kare Pauro Kawatihi of Te Rārawa and Taranaki descent. Dame Whina was educated at St Joseph’s Māori Girls’ College and, at 18, led her first protest to stop the draining of a local swamp. During her long and colourful life she was a wife, mother, teacher, postmistress, shopkeeper, farmer and the first female president of a rugby club.\n\nShe worked tirelessly for land rights and social justice for Māori and, in 1951, founded and was the first president of Te Rōpū Wāhine Māori Toko i te Ora (Māori Women’s Welfare League). In 1957 the League honoured her with the title Te Whaea o te Motu (Mother of the Nation).\n\nIn 1981 she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and, in 1991, Dame Whina was appointed to the Order of New Zealand. She died at Panguru aged 98. More than one million people watched the live television coverage of her tangi.\n\n“Let us all remember that the Treaty was signed so that we could all live as one nation in Aotearoa.” - Dame Whina Cooper, opening the 14th Commonwealth Games in Auckland in January 1990.\n\nMore to Read\n\nWhina, Michael King.

Helen was first elected to Parliament in 1987 as MP for Mt Albert and represented that electorate until 2009.\n\nShe played a major role in New Zealand’s adoption of an anti-nuclear policy and received the Danish Peace Foundation Peace Prize in 1986. Four years later Helen became the first New Zealand woman appointed to the Privy Council. In 1993 she was elected leader of the Labour Party, the first woman to lead a major New Zealand political party. During her nine years in office she addressed controversial issues including Māori rights, same sex civil union and prostitution law reform and advocated strongly for climate change, sustainable development and gender equality.\n\nOn leaving parliament in 2009, Helen became the first woman to lead the United Nations Development Program. For eight years sheoversaw the UNDP’s work with developing nations and was considered by many to be the most powerful woman in the United Nations.She unsuccessfully campaigned for the position of United Nations Secretary General during 2016 and in 2018 was appointed to the Global Fund, an international organisation aiming to reform drug policy to reduce societal harm. Helen was appointed a Member of the Order of New Zealand in 2010.\n\n“If more issues of importance to women are to rise to the top of political, legislative and budget priorities, more women must sit at the top table… Women must be drivers of development – not just passive beneficiaries of plans designed by others.” – Helen Clark\n\nMore to Read:\n\nWomen, Equality, Power Selected speeches from a life of leadership – Helen Clark\n\nAllan and Unwin, 2018\n\nMore to Listen to:\n\nThe 9th Floor – The Commander- Helen Clark\n\nhttps://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/the-9th-floor/story/201842639/the-commander-helen-clark\n\nMore to Watch:\n\nMy Year With Helen- Gaylene Preston -https://myyearwithhelen.com/\n\nBibliography:\n\nhttps://www.g-l-f.org/index.cfm?id=85774\n\nhttps://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/98718546/helen-clark-takes-job-at-global-commission-on-drug-policy\n\nhttps://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/88794507/Helen-Clark-resigns-from-UNDP-saying-it-has-been-an-honour-and-a-privilege\n\nhttps://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12115940\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Helen-Clark\n\nhttps://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12115940\n\nLAWYER.

BUSINESSWOMAN.\n\nDame Jennifer Mary Shipley DNZM PC\n\nb. 1952\n\nIn 1997 Dame Jenny became the first woman to lead the National Party and New Zealand’s first female Prime Minister. She grew up in rural Marlborough. At home her parents expected their four daughters to have opinions and engage in robust debate. On leaving Marlborough Girls’ College, Dame Jenny trained as a primary school teacher at the Christchurch College of Education.\n\nShe entered Parliament after winning the National seat of Ashburton (later renamed Rakaia) in 1987. Throughout the 1990s, as Minister of Social Welfare, Health and Women’s Affairs, Dame Jenny oversaw radical, often deeply unpopular social welfare reforms. During her two-year term as Prime Minister the Ngai Tahu Treaty claim was settled and National launched the Bluegreens. She was the first woman to chair an APEC leaders’ conference and the first Prime Minister to attend the Auckland Hero parade. National was defeated in 1999, in an election in which women led both major parties. Dame Jenny resigned as National leader in October 2001 and 10 months later retired from politics to become a company director.\n\nDame Jenny is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, mentors emerging female leaders and is patron of several organisations including the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre. Following a trip to Namibia, she set up the Namibian Educational Trust and currently chairs Global Women NZ, and the national coordinating committee planning the 2019 Tuia – Encounters 250 commemorations. She was made a Dame Companion of The New Zealand Order of Merit in 2009.\n\n“It's legitimate to choose.

WRITER. ACTOR\n\nRose Matafeo\n\nb. 1992\n\nCharismatic and blissfully funny, Rose has carved out a spot as one of New Zealand’s best comedians. Of Samoan and Scottish-Croatian heritage, Rose was born and raised in Auckland and grew up surrounded by a creative family. Her parents were Rastafarian and Rose and her older brothers had a lot of freedom throughout their childhood. At the age of 15 Rose 'fell' into stand-up comedy while at Auckland Girls Grammar school and soon after won an award at the 2007 New Zealand International Comedy Festival. She has since staged five solo shows as part the festival.\n\nAt 21, Rose won the coveted Billy T Award for comedy for The Rose Matafeo Variety Hour in 2013, having previously been nominated for her show Scout's Honour in 2012. She has gone on to have a very successful screen career, writing and presenting on several TV shows, including as a lead writer and co-star of Three's sketch show Funny Girls. Based in London since 2015, Rose has also become a regular face on British television.\n\nIn 2018 Rose performed her show Horndog at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and won the highly acclaimed award for Best Comedy Show, becoming only the fifth solo woman to take the title and the first solo person of colour.

As a result, her left leg was amputated below the knee, while the rear of her right leg was left with severe scarring. As a child, her parents encouraged her to give everything a go and Sophie has never let her disability hold her back.\n\nSophie started swimming at the age of seven and was soon offered the opportunity to train with the QEII Swim Club. This was the beginning of her swimming career and at just 15, Sophie competed at the Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games, becoming New Zealand's youngest Paralympian and the youngest ever New Zealander to win a medal. She has represented New Zealand at three summer Paralympic Games, winning nine gold medals and six silver medals.\n\nIn 2009 Sophie was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for her services to swimming. In 2016 she was awarded the Sport New Zealand Leadership Award at the Halbergs, and nominated for a prestigious Laureus Award. She was named as the flagbearer for the 2018 New Zealand Commonwealth Games Team on the Gold Coast, where she went on to win two gold medals.\n\nSophie competed at her fourth Paralympic games in Tokyo 2020 winning both a silver and a bronze medal.\n\nIn 2022 Sophie was promoted to Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to swimming.\n\n\"Yes, I'm different because I'm disabled.

In her 35-test career, she was on the losing side just once.\n\nFarah grew up in the small King Country town of Piopio. At school she was a keen sportswoman, playing netball competitively and participating in athletics, swimming, tennis, and cross-country. She began playing rugby while studying at the University of Otago. With a killer instinct and never-say-die attitude, she represented Otago, Waikato and Manawatu at provincial level before joining the Black Ferns in 1996. The following year she was named captain and went on to lead the team in 30 test matches.\n\nFarah played for New Zealand for a decade and during that time achieved her doctorate and began lecturing at Massey University. She is highly regarded in academia for her expertise on Māori and gender issues in sport and for encouraging women and Māori to put themselves forward and achieve at the highest level.\n\nIn 2007 Farah became an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit (ONZM) for services to women's rugby and sport and in 2014 was one of the first women inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame. In 2016, the Women's Provincial Championship was renamed the Farah Palmer Cup and she became the first woman to be appointed to the board of New Zealand Rugby in its 124-year history.\n\nIn the 2023 New Year Honours, Farah was promoted to Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to sport, particularly rugby.\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/40046/farah-palmer\n\nhttp://www.allblacks.com/Player/Index/1156?team=Ferns\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farah_Palmer\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20081014095010/http://taiohi.co.nz/issue23/farah-palmer.html\n\nhttps://www.odt.co.nz/sport/rugby/otago/influence-award-palmer\n\nhttp://www.speakerlink.co.nz/speaker/farah-palmer/\n\nGRAMMY AWARD-WINNING SINGER/SONGWRITER\n\nElla Marija Lani Yelich-O’Connor, aka Lorde\n\nb. 1996\n\nLorde is a Grammy award-winning singer/songwriter whose level of international success surpasses any other New Zealand musician. Her fascination with royalty and the aristocracy influenced her stage name, and she soon began to write and perform as 'Lorde'. Lorde grew up in Devonport and her mother, who is a poet, encouraged her to read widely, which has strongly influenced her songwriting. Throughout her childhood she also listened to her parent’s favourite artists, including Cat Stevens, Fleetwood Mac and jazz and soul musicians Etta James and Billie Holiday.\n\nAt the age of 12 Lorde signed with Universal Music Group and began working with songwriter and record producer Joel Little. She released her debut record The Love Club EP as a free download at 16. Royals, her debut single from the EP, became an international phenomenon topping the charts globally. By 17 she was the youngest solo artist to achieve a number-one single on the US Billboard charts since the 1980s. A month later she released her debut full-length album, Pure Heroine.\n\nIn 2014 Lorde won Grammy Awards for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year for Royals. Royals also won the MTV Video Music Award for best rock video, making Lorde the first female artist in MTV history to win in that category.\n\nLorde’s music, vision and artistic execution continues to be original and authentic and in 2017 her album Melodrama earned a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year.\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Lorde\n\nhttps://www.allmusic.com/artist/lorde-mn0003085111/biography\n\nGOLFER\n\nBo-Gyung \"Lydia\" Ko\n\nb. 1997\n\nAt just 17 years old, Lydia became the youngest professional golfer to be ranked number one in the world. Born in Seoul, South Korea, Lydia moved to New Zealand with her family when she was six. The previous year Lydia’s aunt had given her a 7-iron and putter, which she started to play with. Her father would take her to the driving range and people began to notice the young girl hitting balls. Her mother asked a professional to teach her but was told Lydia was too young. That didn’t stop Lydia and she was competing in New Zealand amateur championships by the time she was seven. She has been making international sporting history ever since.\n\nAt 15 Lydia became the youngest winner on the LPGA Tour when she took the Canadian Open title, and in 2013 she became the youngest golfer in history to win the New Zealand Women’s Open. After winning back-to-back LPGA championships as an amateur, the LPGA waived its age limit of 18 to allow the 16-year-old Lydia to join the professional tour.\n\nIn 2015, 18-year-old Lydia won The Evian Championship in France, making her the youngest woman to win a major championship. A year later she won a silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics and was named Young New Zealander of the Year.\n\nLydia trains for more than 35 hours a week and, due to her achievements and relaxed playing style, she has been hailed as the greatest young golfer – male or female – ever to have played the game.\n\nBibliography\n\nhttp://www.lpga.com/players/lydia-ko/98109/bio\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Ko\n\nhttps://media.newzealand.com/en/story-ideas/new-zealand-golfer-lydia-ko/\n\nhttps://www.thoughtco.com/lydia-ko-profile-1563871\n\nTOHUNGA RARANGA (MASTER WEAVER)\n\nDiggeress Rangituatahi Te Kanawa CNZM QSO\n\n1920 - 2009\n\nNgāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Kinohaku\n\nAll her life Diggeress worked with muku (flax fibre) and she became one of New Zealand’s premier artists and most renowned weavers. She grew up in Oparure, daughter of Taonui Hetet and Dame Rangimarie Hetet, also a tohunga raranga. Her father named her in honour of the WWI army trench diggers.\n\nDiggeress learned traditional weaving from her mother and completed her first piupiu (flax skirt) at 14. Together they led the revival of Māori weaving in the 1950s.\n\nSoftly spoken and generous with her time, Diggeress was an inspirational teacher and known for her humility, aroha and commitment. She had outstanding design skills and was an expert in preparing harakeke (flax) and using earthen dyes. In 1992 she wrote Weaving a Kakahu, detailing the process of weaving a feathered cloak. Diggeress exhibited internationally and her work was gifted to many dignitaries, including Sir Henry Ngata, the Queen of Denmark, Queen Elizabeth II, and Māori King Tuheitia Paki.\n\nDiggeress married Tana Te Kanawa and they raised 12 children, many of whom became acclaimed artists. She made each of her children a cloak reflecting their personality and these are held in trust at the Waikato Museum.\n\nIn 2000 Diggeress was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit and in 2002 she became a New Zealand ‘Icon Artist’. In 2005 she received the Māori Arts Board premier award, Te Tohu Tikitike o Te Waka Toi, recognising her Lifetime Commitment to Maori Weaving, and in 2007 Diggeress received an honorary doctorate from University of Waikato for her dedication to the craft.\n\nPuritia ngā taonga a ō tātou tūpuna\n\n(Hold fast to the treasures of our ancestors)\n\n– a proverb Diggeress chose to live by\n\nMore to Read\n\nTe aho tapu / the sacred thread – Diggeress Te Kanawa.

CHOREOGRAPHER. DIRECTOR.\n\nParris Renee Goebel\n\nb. 1991\n\nBold, colourful and downright fearless, Parris has conquered the world stage as an award-winning dancer, choreographer and director.\n\nBorn and raised in Manurewa, her childhood was full of music and as soon as she could walk Parris was dancing to everything from Michael Jackson to Toni Braxton. Early on her dad recognised school wasn’t going to take Parris where she wanted to go, so at age 15 he pulled her out of school to help her pursue her dream of being a dancer. Around this time Parris formed the ReQuest dance group with four female friends. ReQuest went on to win back-to-back gold medals at the HHI World Hip Hop Dance Championships in Las Vegas, putting them on the international map.\n\nAt 17 she opened The Palace Dance Studio in Penrose, where dancers – especially females – could take hip hop seriously and work towards a career in dance. The Palace has since become one of the most respected hip hop studios in the world. Six dance crews operate out of The Palace – ReQuest, Sorority, Bubblegum, Royal Family, Royal Family Varsity and Kingsmen – all of which have won multiple international hip hop championships.\n\nParris has worked with multiple international artists including Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Janet Jackson, Jennifer Lopez and Nicki Minaj. She has choreographed routines and starred in music videos, movies and large-scale performances.\n\nParris continues to teach throughout the US, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Together with her sisters, Kendal and Narelle, Parris also runs Sisters United – an organisation that helps empower young women through the creative arts.\n\n“So girls, the moral of the story is: you’ve got to believe in yourselves. Whatever you aspire towards, you can achieve it. Be courageous, put yourself out there and don’t ever let anyone tell you it’s not possible to achieve your goal, because they will try.” – Parris Goebel\n\nMore to Read\n\nYoung Queen by Parris Goebel\n\nBibliography\n\nYoung Queen by Parris Goebel, Mary Egan Publishing 2018\n\nhttp://www.thearts.co.nz/artists/parris-goebel\n\nhttp://www.parachutemusic.com/blog-main/how-parris-goebel-her-sisters-are-helping-young-women\n\nWORLD’S FIRST TRANSGENDER MAYOR AND MP\n\nGeorgina Beyer\n\nb. 1957\n\nTe Āti Awa, Ngāti Mutunga, Ngāti Raukawa, Ngāti Porou\n\nGeorgina lived many different lives before becoming the world’s first transgender mayor and Member of Parliament. She is one of very few former sex workers to hold public office and has changed attitudes by living a proud and public life as a transgender woman.\n\nBorn George Bertrand and assigned as a male at birth, she left school at 16 and became part of the Wellington gay nightclub scene as a singer, drag queen performer and then a sex worker. Georgina had gender reassignment surgery in 1984, burning all her old belongings the night before she transitioned. Three years later she was nominated for a GOFTA award for her role as a transgender prostitute, in the movie Jewels Darl.\n\nIn 1995, the relatively conservative town of Carterton voted her in as mayor and in 1999 she won the staunchly National seat of Wairarapa for Labour. She was known for her rousing, often unscripted parliamentary speeches and it was such a speech that secured three key votes to ensure the passing of legislation to decriminalise sex work in 2003. When she left Parliament in 2007, Georgina said she was proud of her contribution to the Prostitution Reform Act and the Civil Union Bill, though she regretted supporting the Foreshore and Seabed legislation. After several years on dialysis and a kidney transplant in 2017, Georgina is now in good health. She has been invited to the Oxford Union in October 2018 to speak about her experience as a public figure.\n\n“You have to remember: law is easy to change, attitudes throughout a country are not.

Originally born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Anna moved to New Zealand with her family at age four. Based in Wellington, Anna was a keen musician playing the viola, cello and piano.\n\nShe leapt into her stage debut at age seven playing a skunk. As a child, being an actress was not her main goal. Anna had ambitions to be Prime Minister of New Zealand! However, at age nine, she followed her sister to an open casting call for a new movie directed by Jane Campion. With no professional acting experience (except for her role as a skunk) Anna beat out 5000 other young girls to win the part of Flora McGrath in The Piano.\n\nHer performance as the daughter of a mute woman in this dark and haunting film received strong reviews. In 1993 she received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, making her the second-youngest Academy Award winner in Oscar history. Anna remains the only New Zealand woman to receive an Academy Award for acting.\n\nAfter the divorce of her parents, Anna moved to Los Angeles with her mother and siblings. It was here she went on to have a successful career as a child actress, appearing in several films including Fly Away Home and Jane Eyre. Since then she has successfully made the difficult transition from child actor to adult actor in both film and television. She continues to live and work in Los Angeles with her husband and children.\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/kiwis-win-oscars-piano\n\nhttps://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/anna-paquin/\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/people/anna-paquin-212183\n\nMĀORI LEADER. EDUCATOR.\n\nMiraka (Mira) Raharuhi Petrecevich Szászy DBE\n\n1921 - 2001\n\nNgāti Kurī, Te Aupouri, Te Rarawa\n\nHer dedication to elevating the status of Māori women and improving Māori education made Dame Mira one of the most outstanding New Zealand women leaders of the 20th century.\n\nShe was born in Te Tiriki, Northland to Lovre Petricevich (a Dalmation gumdigger) and Makareta Raharuhi. Her husband, Albert Szászy, was of Hungarian descent.\n\nDame Mira attended high school in Auckland and was one of 65 Māori trainee teachers in the early 1940s. She wrote directly to Prime Minister Peter Fraser requesting an education bursary so she could finish her Education degree. This was granted and, in 1945, Dame Mira became the first Māori woman graduate from the University of Auckland. In 1949 she completed a Diploma in Social Science at the University of Hawaii. She was one of the first Māori welfare officers and then taught in primary and secondary schools for 30 years.\n\nDame Mira was the first secretary of Te Rōpū Wahine Māori Toko i te Ora (Māori Women’s Welfare League) and became the league’s president in the mid-1970s. She was active on boards and advisory committees working to improve education for Māori. She exposed sexism in Māoridom, fought for speaking rights for women on the marae and urged Māori women to stand for public office.\n\nShe was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1990. In 1998 the University of Auckland established The Mira Szászy Research Centre, the first dedicated Māori and Pacific research facility in business and economics. She died at Ngataki aged 80.\n\n“I don’t believe that giving women their rights as human beings is a destructive thing. I think it is a very positive thing and I believe that the liberation of every human being is part of the development of human society as a whole.” – Dame Mira Szászy\n\nBibliography\n\nA History of New Zealand Women, Barbara Brookes Bridget Williams Books, 2016\n\nhttps://suffrage125science.auckland.ac.nz/\n\nhttps://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-research/bs-research-institutes-and-centres/mira-szaszy-research-centre-for-maori-and-pacific-economic-development/about-dame-mira-szaszy.html\n\nhttps://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/6s2/szaszy-miraka\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraka_Sz%C3%A1szy\n\nhttps://www.komako.org.nz/person/1021\n\nFOOD WRITER AND TV CHEF\n\nDame Alison Margaret Holst DNZM\n\nb. 1938\n\nFor more than 40 years, Dame Alison was New Zealand’s leading television chef and food writer. Since 1966, she has sold 4.5 million copies of her 100 different recipe books, some written in collaboration with her son, Simon. Her recipes focus on ‘everyday food for home cooks’ that is nutritious, reasonably cheap and quick and easy to make.\n\nDame Alison graduated from the University of Otago with a Bachelor of Home Science and then trained as a teacher. She was teaching at the Home Science School in Dunedin when the NZBC (now TVNZ) asked her to front a new television programme, Here’s How. They wanted her to teach New Zealanders how to cook real family meals. There was no one to teach her the role of a presenter so she borrowed a book from the library and, in 1965, Dame Alison became New Zealand’s first female television chef. At the time she had no idea of the impact her friendly, unassuming style would have on at least three generations of home cooks.\n\nDame Alison’s popular cooking fundraisers raised more than $4 million for Plunket, playcentres, schools and kindergartens, and she energetically promoted New Zealand lamb and beef overseas.\n\nIn 1997 Dame Alison was awarded a Doctorate of Science from the University of Otago and, in 2011, she was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the food industry.\n\n“I hope I have helped New Zealand women, because they are hardworking and they fit an awful lot into the day” – Dame Alison Holst\n\nMore to Watch\n\nA Homegrown Cook: The Dame Alison Host Story https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo1ivMcKTAA\n\nMore to Read\n\nA Home-grown Cook: The Dame Alison Holst Story by Alison Holst (Hyndman Publishing, 2011)\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/67718059/son-shares-heartbreak-of-seeing-alison-holst-unable-to-cook\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Holst\n\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10697227\n\nFOUNDER OF NZ HEALTH CAMPS\n\nDr. Elizabeth (Lizzie) Catherine Gunn MBE\n\n1879 – 1963\n\nFor almost 50 years Elizabeth worked to improve the health of New Zealand children. Her most innovative initiative was setting up the country’s first health camp in 1919.\n\nAfter finishing at Otago Girls’ High School, Elizabeth trained as a doctor in Edinburgh, returning to New Zealand in 1912 to join the NZ School Medical Service. She had to petition the Prime Minister, William Massey, to be allowed to serve in the NZ Army Medical Corp during WWI.\n\nAfter the war, Elizabeth began a legendary 30 years of service in the Whanganui- Manawatu School Medical Service. She was autocratic and forthright and she got things done. On occasion she would rather tactlessly and loudly criticise a mother’s parenting ability but many had great respect for her advice. She was the first school doctor to invite parents to medical inspections, she set up ‘toothbrush drills’ and introduced milk in schools long before it became government policy. During the depression she provided many local children with school uniforms.\n\nElizabeth usually dressed in a grey suit, white shirt and tie, and often proudly wore her WWI medals. Her first health camp was a ‘canvas camp’ on a farm in Turakina. She ran it with military precision, providing malnourished, disadvantaged and asthmatic children with rest, fresh air, exercise and good food.\n\nElizabeth retired from public service in 1940 but continued as a private practice paediatrician for many more years. She was appointed a Member of the British Empire in 1951.\n\nBibliography\n\nMargaret Tennant. 'Gunn, Elizabeth Catherine', Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, first published in 1996.

She gained a university scholarship and, on graduating, became first assistant at Christchurch Girls High School and completed her Master of Arts at Canterbury College. At 26, Kate was appointed foundation headmistress for Nelson Girls’ College. Slightly built, quiet and reserved, she was a passionate and gifted teacher. She had great physical stamina and, for seven years, she worked with characteristic determination to establish a school that provided a first-class education for girls. At 33, she married Welsh clergyman William Evans. On moving to Wellington, her husband embarked on unpaid community work and Kate supported their family of three young sons by running a small private school in their home.\n\nAll her life Kate was active in public life as a suffragist, as President and Vice President of the Wellington branch of the New Zealand Society for the Protection of Women and Children for 30 years, and as dominion secretary of the League of Nations of New Zealand.\n\nToday the Kate Edger Educational Charitable Trust annually presents over 100 financial awards to help women fulfil their educational goals.\n\nBibliography\n\nUnpretending Excellence: A Life of Kate Edger, Katrina Ford.

She is New Zealand’s longest serving news presenter and, for Judy, the highlight of that job was bringing moments of history into people’s living rooms night after night.\n\nAfter graduating as a journalist, Judy was determined to secure a job with the NZBC (which later became TVNZ). She had decided nothing less would do and, in 1971, she joined the NZBC as a radio and television reporter. In 1980, she began the first of two long co-presenting partnerships. For nine years Judy presented the regional news on Top Half with John Hawkesby, their easy banter brightening the dullest news. On moving to the 6pm Network News on TV One, Judy was joined by Richard Long for a hugely popular 15-year news reading partnership. Judy became a sole newsreader in 2004 and she left TVNZ a year later saying an emotional goodbye to the nation on December 23, 2015.\n\nFor many years Judy has worked tirelessly as patron of several charities including North Shore Hospice, Women’s Refuge and the Muscular Dystrophy Association. She is a trustee, educator and advisor for the Brainwave Trust Aotearoa. In 2010, Judy was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for her services to broadcasting and the community.\n\nMore to read\n\nMy Own Words by Judy Bailey (Penguin, 2006)\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://www.nzonscreen.com/person/judy-bailey\n\nhttp://www.brainwave.org.nz/who-we-are/our-people/governance/judy-bailey-onzm-dipjourn/\n\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10348638\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Bailey\n\nFIRST FEMALE MĀORI CABINET MINISTER\n\nHon Dr. Whetū Marama Tirikātene-Sullivan ONZ\n\n1932 – 2011\n\nNgāi Tahu, Ngāti Kahungunu\n\nFor 29 years Whetū served her people as a trailblazing Member of Parliament for southern Māori. In 1967, she cut short her academic career to enter politics following the death of her father, long serving MP Sir Eruera Tirikātene. In 1972, Whetū became Minister for Tourism, the first female Maori cabinet minister, and the only woman in cabinet. She was a pioneer in the fight for women’s rights and the first New Zealand politician to be pregnant during the parliamentary session. To ensure no one doubted her ability to continue in politics she returned to parliament six days after her baby was born by caesarean section. Whetū strongly advocated for Te Reo and her passionate support for Māori lead to advances in the establishment of the Waitangi Tribunal, Māori and Papakāinga Housing and Māori Broadcasting, and she successfully battled to retain the Māori seats under MMP.\n\nBorn at Ratana Pa, Whetū trained in social work, then political science at Victoria, University of Wellington. All her life she was a committed member of the Rātana Church and a staunch supporter of the Māori Women’s Welfare League.\n\nWhetū was an accomplished fencer and a New Zealand title holder in ballroom and Latin American dancing. She supported Māori artists and designers and had a great sense of style, often wearing long flowing gowns decorated with dramatic koru prints.\n\nIn 1993, Whetū was made a Member of the Order of New Zealand recognising her outstanding service to the Crown and the people of New Zealand.\n\nBibliography\n\nA History of New Zealand Women by Barbara Brookes (Bridget Williams Books, 2016)\n\nhttps://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/recipients/tirikatene-sullivan-honourable-mrs-tini-whetu-marama-onz\n\nhttps://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/80675/whetu-tirikatene-sullivan-dies\n\nhttps://www.komako.org.nz/person/1263\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whetu_Tirikatene-Sullivan\n\nFIRST FEMALE PACIFIC ISLAND MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT\n\nHon Dame Luamanuvao Winifred Alexandra Laban DNZM, QSO\n\nb. 1955\n\nDame Winnie became the first Pacific Island woman in the New Zealand Parliament when in 1999 she was selected as a Labour list MP. She went on to become Minister of Pacific Island Affairs and Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector. Dame Winnie’s parents migrated to New Zealand from Samoa in the early 1950s. They instilled in her the belief that family, relationships and education were the key to success and happiness, and Dame Winnie has advocated tirelessly for social justice and improved opportunities for the Pacific community.\n\nShe has lived most of her life in Wainuiomata and attended Wellington Girls’ College and Erskine College. After graduating from Victoria University of Wellington with a degree in social work, Dame Winnie worked as a family therapist, probation officer, school councillor, and in community development. In 1992, the Samoan village of Vaiala, Vaimauga, bestowed the matai chiefly title Luamanuvao on her, in recognition of her work with the Pacific Island community in New Zealand.\n\nDame Winnie has held the position of Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Pasifika) of Victoria University of Wellington since 2010. She is also a member of the Arts Board of Creative New Zealand and patron of organisations as diverse as the New Zealand Cancer Society Relay for Life, the Wellington Pasifika Business Network, and the Wellington Warriors.\n\nIn 2018 Dame Winnie was made a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (DCNZ) for her services to education and the Pacific Community.\n\n“It is important to work hard, to study and learn, to find your bliss in education.” - Hon Dame Luamanuvao Winnie Laban\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://www.infonews.co.nz/profile.cfm?id=816\n\nhttps://www.stuff.co.nz/national/104396564/winnie-laban-becomes-a-dame-at-the-2018-queens-birthday-honours\n\nhttp://www.mpp.govt.nz/news-and-stories/trailblazing-pacific-women-feature-in-queens-birthday-honours/\n\nhttps://www.pressreader.com/new-zealand/the-new-zealand-herald/20180604/281663960694562\n\nhttps://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/queensbirthday/audio/2018647765/dame-winnie-laban\n\nPIONEER. LETTER WRITER. COMMUNITY LEADER\n\nJane Maria Atkinson\n\n1824 - 1914\n\nJane Maria was born and raised in England, where she felt she had nothing useful to do. She was 29 when she arrived in New Plymouth with a \"mob\" of inter-related Richmonds, Atkinsons and Hursthouses. Maria (as she preferred to be called), brought with her the Unitarian values of free thought, high principles and intellectual integrity that she had grown up with. On the voyage to New Zealand she met her future husband Arthur, who was nine years her junior. They shared an unstoppable energy for colonial life and their marriage was a surprisingly equal union for the time, each keeping some personal independence. Though pioneer life was initially hard, Maria relished the absence of servants and the freedom to explore the outdoors. She was the first woman to climb Mt Taranaki – although she had gone along just to cook.\n\nMaria became a prominent member of the Nelson community after moving to the South Island with Arthur in 1867, setting up a family school, running a debating team, supporting the Temperance Union and promoting women’s suffrage. She was a passionate supporter of education for women and in 1877 returned to England to help younger family members complete their education. On her return four years later, she campaigned for the establishment of Nelson College for Girls, which opened in 1883.\n\nMaria was intelligent, articulate and a prolific letter writer. She had a perceptive eye for colonial life and her 60 years of correspondence provides a unique picture of the life of a pioneer woman in New Zealand.\n\n“The most solidly educated women are the most useful in every department of life, and that so-called ‘feminine refinement’ is fatal to female usefulness.” - Maria Atkinson, 1870\n\nMore to read\n\nBorn to New Zealand: a biography of Jane Maria Atkinson, by Frances Porter.

She was an energetic and highly organised leader and her persuasive writing, effective debating and dogged perseverance inspired women around the country to take action. Kate was impatient with women who sat around looking delicate! Three petitions were presented to Parliament between 1891 and 1893, the final one signed by almost 32,000 women. On 19 September 1893, the Electoral Act 1893 was passed and New Zealand became the first country in the world to grant full voting rights to women.\n\nKate was born Catherine Wilson Malcolm in Liverpool, England, educated in Scotland and came to New Zealand when she was 21. She was a founding member of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and in 1885 became leader of its franchise department. Kate continued to promote social justice for women and in 1895 she became editor of the White Ribbon – the WCTU’s newspaper and the first fully female owned and operated publication in NZ.\n\nShe helped establish the National Council of Women in 1896 and was elected its first president. Kate spoke at suffrage rallies in Britain and America, where women were not granted the right to vote until after WWI. She was elected honorary vice president of the International Council of Women in 1908 and made a life member of the National Council of Women in 1923.\n\nKate’s only child and her young granddaughter both died before her and she has no living descendants. On her death, the Christchurch Times wrote: “A great woman has gone, whose name will remain an inspiration to the daughters of New Zealand while our history endures.”\n\n“All that separates, whether of race, class creed or sex, is inhuman and must be overcome.” – Kate Sheppard\n\nTo watch\n\nhttps://www.nzonscreen.com/title/inquiry-nothing-venture-nothing-gain-1974\n\nhttps://www.nzonscreen.com/title/votes-for-women-what-really-happened-2012\n\nBibliography\n\nTessa K.

She had attended the Wesleyan Native Institution in Auckland and was bilingual. She was a guide, philosopher and friend to the thousands of tourists who crossed her path.\n\nTe Paea was born in Kororāreka (Russell) to Scotsman Alexander Gray and Kotiro Hinerangi. She married twice, had 17 children and settled at Te Wairoa on the shores of Lake Tarawera. Eleven days before the Mt Tarawera eruption, Te Paea was leading a tour group when the lake level suddenly changed and a ghostly waka appeared. This was interpreted as a warning of a disaster. On the night of June 10, 1886, 62 people sheltered in Te Paea’s whare at Te Wairoa during the eruption. Its strong construction ensured all survived.\n\nAfter the eruption, Te Paea became a guide at Whakarewarewa and, in 1896, she was appointed caretaker of the Whakarewarewa thermal reserve. Here she hosted thousands of tourists including several royal parties.\n\nTe Paea was a public figure and a role model. Her independence and skill encouraged many Tūhourangi women to achieve financial independence by working as guides. She was also committed to the work of the NZ Women’s Christian Temperance Union. Te Paea died at Whakarewarewa on 4 December 1911, and many of her descendants still live in the area.\n\nBibliography\n\nJenifer Curnow.

It was Māori Language Day and the petition requested that “courses in Māori language and aspects of Māori culture be offered in school”. At the time the Māori language was in decline and support for it was considered a radical act. Hana was a dynamic orator and passionate activist and her remit to the 1970 Young Māori Leaders Conference was the impetus for the petition. She travelled the length of the country collecting signatures and, together with Ngā Tamatoa and Te Reo Māori Society, led the modern Te Reo Māori language revitalisation.\n\nHana was the seventh of 12 children, born in Puketapu and educated at the Waitara Convent. She had to leave school at 15, but six years later passed School Certificate English and when she was 30 she enrolled at the University of Auckland to study politics and New Zealand history. With her then husband Syd Jackson, she was a founding member and dynamic leader of Ngā Tamatoa.\n\nHana worked with Hone Tuwhare to set up the first Māori Artists and Writers’ Conference in 1973 and she was a driving force behind the establishment of Kōhanga Reo language nests. During the 1980s Hana formed the first Māori Business and Professional Association, organised the first Māori fashion award, Te Kopu Tu Tangata Designers’ Award, and the Kokahu Fashion shows which ran in conjunction with the landmark Te Māori exhibitions.\n\n“My vision is to see Māori independence and a better country where all aspects of Māori values can be upheld and shared with all the people in this country”\n\n– Hana Te Hemara, 1994\n\nSpecial thanks to Ramari Slattery and Nganeko Eriwata\n\nTo Watch\n\nNgā Tamatoa - 40 years on- https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/nga-tamatoa-2012\n\nBibliography\n\nBrown, Amy and Carlin, Jocelyn: Mana Wahine- Women who show the way.

She received congratulations from Premier Richard Seddon and Queen Victoria but, locally, opposition was fierce. Four councillors and the town clerk resigned not wanting to work under ‘petticoat government’. Council meetings were often disrupted by fierce arguments and Elizabeth’s somewhat ‘tactless and dictatorial manner’ and disregard for established council procedures did not help. Spectators jammed the council chambers, often hooting and jeering during the altercations, and the newspapers reported proceedings in detail.\n\nElizabeth had immigrated to New Zealand with her parents in the mid-1850s. Her husband, Michael Yates, was elected Mayor of Onehunga in 1888 and Elizabeth had always helped him with his work. She was a strong supporter of women’s suffrage and the first woman to vote under the 1993 Electoral Act. That same year, Michael stood down as mayor because of ill health and Elizabeth contested the by-election. Few expected her to win. Just 12 months later she was resoundingly defeated in the local body elections despite having managed the council out of debt, upgraded roads and sanitation and reorganised the fire brigade.\n\nElizabeth did not make friends easily and, after several failed attempts at re-election and the death of her husband in 1902, she started drinking and developed dementia. In 1907, Elizabeth was committed to the Auckland Mental Hospital in Avondale where she remained until her death in 1918.\n\nBibliography\n\nA History of New Zealand Women, Barbara Brookes Bridget Williams Books, 2016\n\nJanice C.

FEMINIST. ACTIVIST\n\nDame Marilyn Joy Waring DNZM\n\nb. 1952\n\nWhen she won the Raglan seat for the National Party in 1975, Marilyn was just 23 and became New Zealand’s youngest Member of Parliament. Only four of the 87 MPs were women. From 1978 to 1981 she was the only woman in the National Party caucus and she said parliament felt like a boys club. In her first speech to parliament she pledged to represent her electorate, the youth and women of New Zealand. In caucus she chose to sit directly opposite Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, making it clear to him that she would fearlessly make her opinions heard. Marilyn’s decision to cross the floor and support Labour’s nuclear-free legislation led Muldoon to call the 1984 snap election and she did not stand for re-election.\n\nMarilyn is internationally acclaimed as an economist and an activist for female human rights and environmental issues. She is also a prominent spokesperson for gay and lesbian rights. In her 1988 book, If Women Counted, Marilyn argued that women's unpaid work was not counted as productive work and this book is considered to be the founding document of feminist economics. She completed her PhD in political economy in 1989.\n\nIn 2005 Marilyn was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Since 2006 she has been Professor of public policy at Auckland University of Technology’s Institute of Public Policy. She was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2008 for her services to women and economics.\n\nIn the 2020 New Year Honours, Marilyn was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to women and economics.\n\n“This place, Parliament, is the extreme of what is not a woman’s world. There is very little of the female world here.”\n\n- Marilyn Waring, 1984.\n\nMore to Watch\n\nWho's Counting?

She sang at Covent Garden and La Scala, and gave 369 performances with The Metropolitan Opera in New York during her 35-year career. Her finest role was Mimi in Puccini’s La Boheme, which she sang 80 times, partnering with all the leading tenors of the time, including Enrico Caruso.\n\nFrances was born in Christchurch and named Fanny Davis. Her mother died when Frances was four and she was raised in Melbourne by her musical maternal grandparents. Frances was a musically gifted child and, when she was 22, she left for Europe; a girl from the ‘colonies’ determined to make it in the ruthless world of European opera. She changed her name to the more Italian-sounding Frances Alda and made her acclaimed operatic debut in Paris in 1904. Following her move to New York, she married Giulo Gatti-Casazza, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera. It was a tempestuous 18-year relationship which, at times, limited her career.\n\nFrances was a presence; beautiful, with stunning red hair, unconventional and never afraid to give her opinion. She was an advocate for women’s rights in the music profession, a great supporter of young artists and was one of the first opera stars to appear on radio.\n\nShe died in Venice aged 73 and, despite spending most of her life overseas, Frances remained a proud and patriotic New Zealander.\n\nMore to Read\n\nMen, Women and Tenors, Frances Alda, Boston, 1937\n\nMore to Listen to\n\nFrances Alda: O mio babbino caro (1919) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTZZQM7Z_yk\n\nFrances Alda: Two Maori Songs (1928) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMiw06wOUSI\n\nBibliography\n\nAdrienne Simpson.

She graduated from the University of Auckland with a Masters of Arts in anthropology and completed her PhD in 1972. From 1971 she collaborated with Erurera and Amiria Stirling of Te Whānau-ā-Apanui and Ngāti Porou on three books on Māori life, including the award-winning Euruera: Teachings of a Māori Elder. Since the 1990s Dame Anne has written multiple award-winning books on cross cultural encounters and the early exchanges between Pacific Islanders and European explorers in the Pacific. The Trial of the Cannibal Dog won the Montana Award for history and the Montana Medal for nonfiction in 2004.\n\nDame Anne is a Fellow of the Royal Society Te Apārangi and in 1995 became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1995. In 2013 she was named New Zealander of the Year and also became the first social scientist awarded the Rutherford Medal, the highest award of the Royal Society Te Apārangi.\n\nShe has long been a passionate environmentalist and, in 2000, Dame Anne and her husband began the restoration of the Longbush Ecosanctuary in Gisborne. She is patron of several environmental organisations including Te Awaroa: 1000 Rivers, which aims to restore 1000 waterways across New Zealand by 2050.\n\nDame Anne has been Distinguished Professor of Māori studies and anthropology at the University of Auckland since 2001.\n\n“If we all link arms and reach across, we could join forces to do anything” – Dame Anne Salmond\n\nMore to Read:\n\nTears of Rangi: Experiments Across Worlds by Anne Salmond (Auckland University Press, 2017)\n\nThe Trial of the Cannibal Dog: Captain Cook in the South Seas, by Anne Salmond (Penguin, 2004) (winner of the Montana Medal for Non-fiction in 2004)\n\nEuruera: Teachings of a Māori Elder by Euruera Stirling and Anne Salmond (Oxford University Press. 1980) (first equal Wattie Book Awards, 1981)\n\nMore to Listen to: https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/201852079/anne-salmond-tears-of-rangi\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://www.noted.co.nz/archive/listener-nz-2013/dame-anne-salmond-wins-rutherford-medal/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Salmond\n\nhttp://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/writer/salmond-anne/\n\nhttp://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8366898/Dame-Anne-wins-NZer-of-the-Year\n\nhttps://royalsociety.org.nz/members/memberpage/388\n\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=11899254\n\nOCEAN SAILOR\n\nDame Naomi Christine James DBE\n\nb. 1949\n\nOn 8 June 1978 Dame Naomi nursed the 53-foot Express Crusader into Dartmouth Harbour becoming the first woman to sail solo around the world via Cape Horn in a record breaking 272 days, beating Sir Francis Chichester’s record by two days. Dame Naomi was a very private person who disliked crowds but she returned a celebrity and, aged 29, became the youngest New Zealander to be made a Dame.\n\nDame Naomi grew up on a remote dairy farm in Hawkes Bay and trained as a hairdresser before heading to Europe by ship. She was seasick for much of the voyage. She was 23 when she taught herself to swim and she only learnt to sail after meeting her future husband, sailor Rob James.\n\nShe left Dartmouth on 9 September 1977 in a borrowed boat with little real sailing experience. For the first three months she confused latitude (which she measured by sextant) and longitude (determined by complex calculations). In the South Atlantic she lost radio contact for 8000 miles and her kitten, Boris, fell overboard. Six months into the voyage a five-metre wave capsized the boat and she was miraculously saved by the self-righting keel. For much of the voyage she would snatch no more than 1.5 hours sleep at a time; sometimes she went for days without rest.\n\nDame Naomi retired from sailing in 1982. Six months later her husband, Rob, drowned in a sailing accident, 10 days before the birth of their daughter. Dame Naomi now lives in Cork, Ireland.\n\n“I was terrified I would not find the Canary Islands.

This was the beginning of her love of writing and poetry.\n\nAt age 17 her poem ‘The Liberation of Wine’ was published in the 50th edition of New Zealand Poetry, the country’s longest-running poetry magazine. She has since been published in several publications including Blackmail Press and the Otago University Literary Society Press. Currently majoring in Psychology at the University of Waikato Nurul is the first in her family to attend tertiary education. Nurul uses her voice as a blogger to talk about issues around mental health, feminism, human rights, travel and beauty.\n\nIn 2018 Nurul was announced as one of the 20 finalists for Miss Universe New Zealand, one of the first in the world to do so wearing a hijab.\n\nIn New Zealand, where Muslims make up two percent of the population, Nurul is breaking boundaries and stereotypes, pioneering a new and inclusive culture of beauty that is more than skin deep.\n\nWho\n\nAre\n\nWe\n\nTo 'believe' the media?\n\nDon't look at me.\n\nLook into me;\n\nFor I am a girl\n\nLiberated\n\nWith her silk pashmina,\n\nWine red scarf.\n\n- From The Liberation of Wine by Nurul Shamsul in New Zealand Poetry 2015\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://www.thegirlinthewineredscarf.com/new-page/\n\nhttps://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/voices/audio/2018648578/ground-breaking-first-nz-beauty-contestant-in-hijab\n\nhttps://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnists/2018/06/377472/creating-waves-and-redefining-beauty\n\nhttp://cleo.com.my/nurul-shamsul-is-miss-universe-new-zealands-first-indo-malay-hijabi-finalist/\n\nhttps://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/07/13/ordinary-girl-embarks-on-extraordinary-quest/\n\nYOUNGEST LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY\n\nWORLD’S YOUNGEST FEMALE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT\n\nDame Jacinda Kate Laurell Ardern GNZM\n\nb. 1980\n\nBy any standard, Jacinda’s 18 months from January 2017 were unprecedented for a New Zealand politician. She was in her ninth year as a Labour list MP at the start of 2017. In February, she was elected MP for Mt Albert and by March was deputy leader of the Labour Party. On 1 August, Jacinda became the youngest ever leader of the New Zealand Labour Party just seven weeks before the general election. The media coined the word 'Jacindamania' to describe the positive effect this had on Labour party support. On 19 October 2017, aged 37, Jacinda became New Zealand’s second youngest prime minister and the world’s youngest female head of government. In June 2018, she became the first New Zealand leader, and only the second world leader, to have a child while holding office. Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford was born on Thursday, June 21 2018.\n\nJacinda went to school in Morrinsville and joined the Labour party when she was 17. In 2001, she graduated from the University of Waikato with a Bachelor of Communication Studies in politics and public relations. She worked as a researcher for MPs Phil Goff and Helen Clarke, and was a senior policy adviser on a team of 80 for British Prime Minister Tony Blair. In 2008, Jacinda came into parliament as a Labour list MP. She has always been strong advocate for children, women, and the right of every New Zealander to have meaningful work.\n\nOn 19 January 2023, Jacinda announced she would resign as Labour leader and prime minister by 7 February and leave Parliament by the 2023 general election. She cited a desire to spend more time with her partner and daughter and an inability to commit to another four years.\n\nDuring her five years in office she dealt with the Christchurch Mosque shootings, the White Island Eruption and the COVID-19 Pandemic.\n\nOn 26 May 2022, Jacinda was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by Harvard University for contributions that \"shape the world\".\n\nIn the 2023 King's Birthday and Coronation Honours, Jacinda was appointed a Dame Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (GNZM), for services to the State.\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacinda_Ardern\n\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11897476\n\nhttps://www.labour.org.nz/jacindaardern\n\nhttps://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/06/mothers-in-parliament-the-women-who-paved-the-way-for-jacinda-ardern.html\n\nTHE MOTHER OF NEW ZEALAND BOTANY\n\nDr. Lucy Beatrice Moore MBE FRSNZ\n\n1906 - 1987\n\nKnown as ‘the mother of New Zealand botany’, Lucy was a pioneer in botanical research. She tramped into remote parts of New Zealand to carry out ground-breaking plant research. Conditions were rough; Lucy’s sleeping bag was an unlined canvas sack and her tent was a flysheet draped over branches. She grew up near Warkworth, boarded at Epsom Girls’ Grammar and, in 1929, graduated with a Master of Science with first class honours. Lucy’s often highly-original research was internationally acclaimed but she was unsuccessful in securing a university teaching position because she was a woman.\n\nIn 1938, Lucy was appointed to the botany division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) in Wellington where she worked for 33 years. She studied weeds, seaweeds, high country plants and made outstanding contributions to the first two volumes of the Flora of New Zealand series.\n\nDuring World War II, imports of Japanese agar ceased. Agar was essential for medical research and Lucy was asked to find seaweed that could be used to manufacture it in New Zealand. She discovered a variety on the East Cape and arranged a for school children to collect the seaweed for pocket money.\n\nLucy became a Fellow of the Royal Society Te Apārangi in 1947 and, in 1965, was the first woman to win the Hutton Medal for outstanding services to systemic and applied botany in New Zealand.\n\nShe was also awarded a Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE), a Doctorate of Science and the Marsden Medal for services to science.\n\n“Few botanists may ever again equal her range of expertise... inspired by a vision, and practised with dedication.” - John Morton\n\nBibliography\n\nJohn Morton.

Each weekday morning at 9am her signature tune, Daisy Bell, and her energetic “Good morning, good morning, good morning everybody” greeted her listeners. For 30 minutes she would talk, unscripted – at a dazzling 200 words per minute – providing recipes, household hints, and comments on films, concerts and even the Dean’s Sunday Sermon. She would only advertise products she had used and a product mentioned in the morning was likely to sell out by mid-afternoon.\n\nDaisy grew up in Victorian London and was 12 when her widowed mother moved the family to New Plymouth. She trained in singing and as a teacher then, in the late 1920s, with the support of her husband, Fred, Daisy began writing and broadcasting pieces on composers. She became Aunt Daisy after taking over the children’s session on 1YA and then moved to her own slot on 1ZB in 1933. During World War II she reported on the lives of women living on military bases. In 1944, she visited the US and, over tea with Eleanor Roosevelt, passed on messages from American personnel stationed in New Zealand. Aunt Daisy published a dozen recipe and hints books and her cookbook was in its 22nd reprint in 2010.\n\nShe was awarded Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1956 for services to broadcasting. Her vitality, charisma, strength and resilience made her seem ageless and many were shocked to learn she was 83 when she died, just a few days after her final broadcast.\n\nBibliography\n\n1998.

At her peak she was ranked ninth in the world.\n\nRuia was born in Tikitere, the third child of Hingawaka (Waki) Morrison and Tanira Kingi. By age eight, she was playing on dirt courts with a bat her father had made. After her first racquet broke because she hit the ball so hard, she played with her father’s full sized racquet. On leaving Queen Victoria School for Girls, Ruia enrolled at Auckland Teachers' College, though her study was frequently interrupted by major tennis tournaments.\n\nRuia was only 1.54m tall but was an aggressive player with a strong forehand and a near perfect volley. In the 1950s there was little media interest in women’s tennis but Ruia, with her charm, sparkling personality and excellent all-round game, single-handedly lifted the profile of women’s tennis in New Zealand.\n\nWhen the New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association refused to give her financial support to go to Wimbledon, the Ruia Morrison Wimbledon Fund Committee was established and raised the money for her fare and expenses, first through Māori tribal communities and then through a nationwide appeal.\n\nRuia was made a Member of the British Empire in 1960 for services to Māori people and New Zealand tennis. Ruia retired from tennis in 1982 after a 30-year competitive playing career.\n\nIn the 2021 Queen's Birthday Honours, Ruia was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to tennis\n\n\"Everybody's got gifts, it's the passion with which you use them that counts.\"- Ruia Morrison\n\nMore to listen to http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/teahikaa/audio/2556271/ruia-morrison-davy\n\nMore to watch\n\nMāori and tennis: acing it at 80 https://teara.govt.nz/en/video/41484/ruia-morrison\n\nBibliography\n\nhttp://maorisportsawards.co.nz/profiles/ruia-morrison-davy-mbe/\n\nStanding in the sunshine - a history of New Zealand women since they won the vote by Sandra Coney (Penguin Books NZ Ltd, 1993)\n\nMichael Romanos, Ruia Morrison, Tu Tangata (July 1986)\n\nBasil Keane, 'Māori and sport – hākinakina - Māori and sport from the late 20th century', Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/video/41484/ruia-morrison\n\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/rotorua-daily-post/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503438&objectid=11102082\n\nNEW ZEALAND’S FIRST WOMAN LAWYER\n\nEthel Rebecca Benjamin\n\n1875 -1943\n\nWhen she started law school at the University of Otago in 1893, Ethel did not know if she would be allowed to practise when she graduated. The law was changed in 1896 to allow women to practise law. Ethel graduated in 1897 with outstanding marks, becoming New Zealand’s first woman lawyer and the second woman in the British Empire to be admitted as a barrister and solicitor. While her fellow classmates at university had accepted her, the Otago District Law Society did not. It restricted her use of the society’s library, declined her usual new graduate support and excluded her from their annual dinner.\n\nEthel was an astute businesswoman and ran a successful law practice in Dunedin for 10 years. Her clients were from the local Jewish community and independently wealthy women. She also worked with the local hotel industry and was one of the few advocates of women’s rights who did not support the temperance movement. Ethel was a founding member of the Dunedin Society for the Protection of Women and Children and was the society’s honorary lawyer helping women deal with abusive relationships and divorce.\n\nFollowing her marriage to Alfred De Costa in 1907 she moved first to Wellington then to England. She died in 1943 following an accident.\n\nOn the centenary of Ethel’s graduation, the Law Foundation established the Ethel Benjamin Scholarship which provides $50,000 a year, to two outstanding New Zealand women law graduates, for post-graduate study overseas.\n\n“When I heard that being a woman, I could not be admitted to the practise of law, I was very indignant... and I grew all the more determined to follow the legal profession” - Ethel Benjamin\n\nMore to Read:\n\nIn the Footsteps of Ethel Benjamin: New Zealand's First Woman Lawyer by Janet November (Victoria University Press, 2009)\n\nBibliography\n\nCarol Brown.

She is a creative and inspiring storyteller and, worldwide, generations of children have learned to love reading with her popular characterslike Mrs Wishy Washy and Dan the Flying Man, and timeless tales like Bow Down Shadrach (1991) and The Road to Ratenburg (2016).\n\nAs a schoolgirl, Joy edited the children’s page of the local paper and, in the early 1960s, she began writing short stories, submitting 29 stories before the NZ Listener accepted one for publication. Her first book was for adults, Nest in a Falling Tree (1967), and was made into the movie The Night Digger, directed by Roald Dahl.\n\nIn the mid-1960s Joy began writing stories for her son, Edward, who, like her, had difficulty learning to read. In the late 1970s she wrote the first of hundreds of stories for Wendy Pye’s StoryBox reading program.\n\nJoy wants children to see themselves and their own culture in the stories they read and, for 30 years, she has run writing workshops for people whose cultures do not feature in their children’s books.\n\nJoy’s books have received national and international awards and, in 2005, she was made a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. She has twice been nominated for the Hans Christian Anderson Award and, in 2018, Joy was made a member of the Order of New Zealand.\n\nNow in her early 80s, Joy has 13 grandchildren and is still writing full time.\n\n“The day I’m no longer in touch with young people, is the day I stop writing for them, because the energy flows from them and goes back to them” – Joy Cowley\n\nMore to read\n\nNavigation: A Memoir, by Joy Cowley.

Her works are exquisite pieces of feather and fibre art and she used only natural materials. Dame Rangimārie’s work is notable for its fine, meticulous weaving and innovative design and she could spend 450 hours completing one korowai (cloak).\n\nDame Rangimārie was born at Oparure in the King Country. Her father, Charles Wilson Hursthouse, was a surveyor and she was taught the art of traditional weaving by her mother, Mere Te Rongopāmamao Aubrey.\n\nShe left Oparure after her marriage to Tuheka Taonui Hetet but returned in 1948. She was a founding member of the Māori Women’s Welfare League and, with her daughter and protégée, Diggeress Te Kanawa, agreed to teach traditional Māori weaving on the condition she could teach all who wanted to learn, rather than the customary rule of only teaching women from her own tribe.\n\nBy the 1960s, Dame Rangimārie was nationally known as a specialist in korowai weaving and, during mid-1970s, she began exhibiting internationally.\n\nDame Rangimārie was highly organised, constantly active and stubbornly independent. She continued weaving until she died, aged 103, outliving three of her children and is survived by over 100 descendants.\n\nDame Rangimārie received a doctorate from the University of Waikato in 1986 and was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire in 1992 for services to Māori arts and crafts. The Waikato Museum is the kaitiaki (guardian) of her work.\n\n“I let it be known I was prepared to teach anybody who wanted to learn” - Dame Rangimārie Hetet\n\nBibliography\n\nStanding in the Sunshine-A history of New Zealand Women since they won the vote by Sandra Coney (Penguin Books NZ Ltd, 1993)\n\nCelebrating Women - New Zealand Women and their Stories by Mediawomen of New Zealand (Cape Catley Ltd, 1984)\n\nhttps://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/5h18/hetet-rangimarie\n\nhttps://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/topic/3651\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangim%C4%81rie_Hetet\n\nAVIATOR, ‘GARBO OF THE SKIES’\n\nJane Gardner Batten\n\n1909 - 1982\n\nDuring the 1930s flying was the most dangerous and exciting activity on earth and Jean was the finest female pilot of this golden age of aviation. She was the first woman to fly solo England to Australia and return, to fly across the Atlantic, and to fly from England to New Zealand. Jean was the most famous New Zealander of the time and her arrival at Mangere airport at the end of her 1936 record-breaking solo flight from England created Auckland’s biggest traffic jam.\n\nShe was born in Rotorua and went to England in 1930 to become a pianist but chose to sell her piano to fund flying lessons.\n\nJean was adventurous, glamorous and utterly fearless. She took huge risks, flew in dangerous weather and was an exceptional navigator. Her transatlantic flight of 1900 miles from West Africa to Brazil was a brilliant 13-hour feat of navigation through storms, armed with just a watch and compass which failed.\n\nJean carried minimal luggage but always disembarked looking immaculate in her white flying suit, with lipstick and cologne carefully applied.\n\nFame did not bring her happiness. Jean had a reputation for using men to aid her ambitions and several of her close friends were killed in flying accidents. Her intense relationship with her driven mother isolated her and, after Jean’s mother died, she became a recluse and died alone in 1982. At the time, her body was unidentified and buried in a pauper’s grave in Majorca.\n\nMore to read\n\nThe Infinite Air by Fiona Kidman (Random House, 2013)\n\nBibliography\n\nhttp://www.nzedge.com/legends/endurance/jean-batten/\n\nhttps://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/4b13/batten-jean-gardner\n\nhttps://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/jean-batten\n\nhttp://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/culture/9245744/Plane-truths-about-Jean-Batten\n\nThe Book of New Zealand Women / Ko Kui Ma Te Kaupapa.

SHORT STORY WRITER. ESSAYIST. POET\n\nNene Janet Paterson Clutha ONZ CBE\n\n1924 – 2004\n\nNene Janet Paterson Clutha published under the name Janet Frame and became one of New Zealand’s most distinguished and celebrated writers of fiction, nonfiction and poetry.\n\nBorn in Dunedin, Janet grew up in Oamaru. In 1945, she was admitted to Seacliff Lunatic Asylum following an emotional breakdown where she was diagnosed as schizophrenic and treated with electroconvulsive therapy. In 1951, while still at Seacliff, Janet’s first volume of short stories, The Lagoon and Other Stories, was published and it was awarded New Zealand’s only literary prize just days before she was to have a lobotomy. The operation, which would have left her unable to write, was immediately cancelled.\n\nJanet moved to London in 1956. Her new psychiatrist told her she was not mentally ill and had been misdiagnosed. He encouraged her to keep writing and the next seven years were her most productive. Many found her writing difficult to read and her narrative style was ahead of its time. In 1964, Janet returned to New Zealand and, during the 1980s, she wrote her autobiography, partly to ‘set the record straight’ about her decade in mental institutions.\n\nJanet was awarded several honorary doctorates and medals, including a CBE for her services to literature. In 1990, she became the 16th appointee to New Zealand’s highest honour, The Order of New Zealand and was nominated for a Nobel Prize in Literature. Yet all her life Janet remained a very private person, untouched by the idea that she was a genius and a world renowned author.\n\nMore to Read:\n\nTo The Is-Land (1982), Janet’s autobiography Volume 1\n\nAn Angel at My Table (1984) autobiography Volume 2\n\nThe Envoy from Mirror City (1985) autobiography Volume 3\n\nMore to Watch:\n\nAn Angel at My Table - 1990 film directed by Jane Campion\n\nBibliography\n\nhttp://www.janetframe.org.nz/Biography.htm\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/30/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\n\nhttp://www.nzedge.com/legends/janet-frame/\n\nWWII SECRET AGENT “THE WHITE MOUSE”\n\nNancy Grace Augusta Wake AC, GM\n\n1912 –2011\n\nFeisty and courageous Nancy became a fearless WWII Secret Agent. Born in Wellington Nancy moved to Australia with her family as a child. When she was 16 she ran away from home. Using a gift from her New Zealand aunt, she travelled to America and on to Europe, where she worked as newspaper correspondent. In 1939, Nancy married wealthy French industrialist Henri Fiocca, and was living a luxurious life in Marseille when Germany invaded France the following year.\n\nNancy joined the Resistance and helped more than a thousand escaped prisoners of war and downed Allied airmen reach the safety of Spain. Nancy was so skilled at evading the Gestapo that they nicknamed her “The White Mouse.” By 1943, she was at the top of the Gestapo’s ‘most wanted’ list. Five million francs were offered for her capture. In 1944 Nancy escaped to England and became a Special Operations Executive agent. She parachuted back into central France and led an army of 7,000 resistance fighters in guerrilla warfare against the Nazis. At the age of 89 she claimed she had never been afraid in her life. Once, when her wireless radio was broken, she cycled almost 400 km in three days through German territory, to deliver the message.\n\nImmediately after the war Nancy’s heroic achievements were recognised by Britain, France and the Unites States. She became one of the most highly decorated women of WW II. However, it was not until 2006 that the New Zealand Returned Services Association awarded Nancy their highest honour, the RSA Badge in Gold, at last recognising her wartime work with the French resistance.\n\nThough away from New Zealand for 80 years, Nancy retained her New Zealand passport and considered herself a kiwi. She died in London, aged 98 and as requested her ashes were scattered near the village of Verneix in central France.\n\nA resistance comrade described Nancy as the “… most feminine woman I know, until the fighting starts. Then, she is like five men.”\n\nBibliography:\n\nhttp://www.nzedge.com/legends/warriors/nancy-wake/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Wake\n\nMore to Read:\n\nThe White Mouse by Nancy Wake, Pan Macmillan, 1985)\n\nDISTINGUISHED JURIST AND GOVERNOR GENERAL\n\nThe Honourable Dame Silvia Rose Cartwright PCNZM DBE QSO DStJ\n\nb. 1943\n\nDame Silvia is one of New Zealand's most distinguished woman jurists whose intellect and compassion have won her international respect. When she graduated from the University of Otago’s law school in 1967, law firms were reluctant to employ women. Eventually she was offered a job and quickly earned the respect of her colleagues but her requests for equal pay were repeatedly declined.\n\nThroughout her career Dame Silvia has worked to eliminate discrimination against women. In 1988, she led the Cartwright Inquiry into cervical cancer treatment at Auckland's National Women's Hospital. Her report recommended the appointment of a Health and Disability Commissioner and was the catalyst for widespread changes in all aspects health consumer rights. The following year she was made a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her services to women.\n\nDame Silvia was appointed as New Zealand’s first female Chief District Court Judge and High Court Judge. In 2001,she became New Zealand’s second female Governor General. Dame Silvia broke with convention and spoke out on issues such as prison reform and child abuse. She described her sometimes controversial five-year term as ‘all consuming’.\n\nIn 2007, Dame Silvia moved to Phnom Penh following her appointment as an international judge on the Cambodian War Crimes Tribunal. She regarded her seven years on the tribunal as her greatest professional challenge. In 2015, she moved to the High Commission of Human Rights in Geneva to advise on an investigation into human rights abuses during the civil war in Sri Lanka.\n\n“She is an ordinary woman who has done extraordinary things, through kindness, truth and virtue.” - Dame Sian Elias\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://www.womens-health.org.nz/consumer-rights/cartwright-inquiry/\n\nhttps://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/research/publications/vuwlr/prev-issues/volume-45,-issue-4/Laidlaw.pdf\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvia_Cartwright\n\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10393582\n\nMODERNIST SHORT STORY WRITER\n\nKathleen Mansfield Murry\n\n1888-1923\n\nHer writing revolutionised the 20th Century short story and at the time of her early death, Katherine had already built an international reputation based on just three volumes of short stories.\n\nKatherine grew up in Wellington and finished her schooling in London. On returning to New Zealand she rebelled against the restricted, conventional life of her socially-prominent family and, at 20, left New Zealand permanently.\n\nIn Europe, she lived a libertine, bohemian life and was a friend of writers D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf. Virginia said: \"I was jealous of her writing—the only writing I have ever been jealous of”. Katherine’s experiences alone in Germany following a miscarriage formed the basis of her first published short story collection, In a German Pension (1911). After her beloved brother was killed in World War I, her stories were often nostalgic recreations of the New Zealand childhood they had shared.\n\nIn 1916, Katherine met Middleton Murry. Their relationship was one of frequent acrimonious partings followed by reconciliations. They eventually married in 1918.\n\nIn 1917, Katherine was diagnosed with tuberculosis and moved to the south of France. This was her most prolific period of writing and she published her second collection of stories, Bliss, in 1920, and The Garden Party in 1922.\n\nIn 1922, disillusioned with conventional medicine, Katherine entered the Gurdjieff Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man at Fontainebleau-Avon where she died the following year. After her death, Middleton Murry published two further volumes of Katherine’s short stories together with her letters and notebooks.\n\n“Risk, risk anything!

Many in the Labour party objected to her standing in the Lyttleton that James had held for 20 years, but she won it with a much increased majority.\n\nElizabeth and James married in 1903 and were both committed socialists who had dreams of being in parliament together. In 1916, James became the first Labour Party president and Elizabeth was elected to the party’s executive. She was the second woman elected to the Christchurch City Council in the early 1920s.\n\nElizabeth spent a lifetime campaigning for women.
