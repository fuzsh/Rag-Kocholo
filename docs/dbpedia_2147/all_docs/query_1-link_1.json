Qualification for Miss Universe New Zealand is based on regional pageants and/or personal interviews (necessary due to lack of regional pageant in some areas).[1]\n\nHistory\n\nNew Zealanders have contested 44 Miss Universe pageants since its inception in 1952 and is one of 33 countries to win the title. After no entrants were sent to Miss Universe in 2004 and 2005, a new national pageant, Miss Universe New Zealand, was created in 2006.\n\nNew Zealand's most successful entrant came in 1983 when Lorraine Downes won the Miss Universe title.
