It was the third regional event in New Zealand’s new music, dance and drama showcase for schools. Darfield High students choose to theme their performance on gun violence in schools in the United States. This theme was chosen as they felt inspired by students of the same age who had experienced it first-hand. The group spent seven weeks practising their performance before the regional contest. For Jemma Dalley, one of the student captains for the Darfield High entry, the goal was to safely and conscientiously put across the theme, while making their school and themselves proud. “That we’ve won is so awesome, and just puts the cherry on top really,” said the 16-year-old. A national online final will name the top entry nationwide in September. <strong>08</strong>00 726 724 www.scorch.co.nz Pool, library projects on table today SELWYN’S biggest community facility project ever could get the green light today.

The two projects were proposed in the Long Term Plan <strong>2018</strong> -2028 and previous annual plans. Property and commercial manager Douglas Marshall said the projects are key developments in meeting the increasing needs of the district, as its population continues to grow. “This is a substantial investment in the district which ensures that two important facilities meet the future needs of all <strong>Selwyn</strong> residents,” he said. •Turn to page 5 Just released.
