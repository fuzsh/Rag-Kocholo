But that’s exactly what the Burwood woman did last week at the Miss Universe New Zealand finals, in which she placed in the top 10. Miss Hunt said her experience in the competition was ‘amazing’. “It was just something that I thought ‘why not?’ And you’ve got to try new things and get the experiences from them.” She said after she put in her application, she was overjoyed to find she had made the top 20, and was sent to Auckland for training at the Stiletto Camp. “It was amazing. They had make-up classes, a nutritionist came and talked to us, there was a choreographer,” she said.

Entries are open for artists to take part in the SCAPE Public Art Trust’s Re:ACTIVATE <strong>2018</strong>: New Brighton art competition. Two winning design entries will be chosen, one to be enlarged on a half basketball court, while the other will be on a large mural space in New Brighton. The total cost of the installation will be about $60,000. The artists will each win $3000 in prize money. It is planned to have the artwork visible on Google Earth. Both artworks will be located on the south side of the New Brighton Pier. The project is being funded by Development Christchurch Ltd and SCAPE. SCAPE executive director Deborah McCormick said it was attracted to the strong urban art scene developing out in New Brighton. “We are looking at areas under regeneration in the city. It was a logical place to go to New Brighton,” she said. •Turn to page 3 STAY WELL NATURALLY GO VIR-DEFENCE offers powerful immune support this winter with its nine clinically proven ingredients.
