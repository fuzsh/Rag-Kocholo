        "text": "Miss Universe New Zealand is the New Zealand national beauty pageant which feeds into the international Miss Universe competition. Qualification for Miss Universe New Zealand is based on regional pageants and/or personal interviews (necessary due to lack of regional pageant in some areas).[1]\n\nNew Zealanders have contested 44 Miss Universe pageants since its inception in 1952 and is one of 33 countries to win the title. After no entrants were sent to Miss Universe in 2004 and 2005, a new national pageant, Miss Universe New Zealand, was created in 2006.\n\nNew Zealand's most successful entrant came in 1983 when Lorraine Downes won the Miss Universe title. The country's only other top five placing came when Delyse Nottle was second runner-up to Shawn Weatherly in 1980. New Zealand has also had three semi-finalist placings, in 1962, 1981 and 1992.\n\nNew Zealand is one of only 12 countries to win two or more Miss Photogenic awards, won by Carole Robinson (1969) and Delyse Nottle (1980).\n\nContents\n\n1 Representatives\n\n2 Miss World\n\n3 References\n\n4 External links\n\nRepresentatives\n\nYear Name Represented Placement Notes 2011 Priyani Puketapu Wellington 2010 Ria van Dyke Auckland 2009 Katie Taylor Auckland 2008 Samantha Powell Paraparaumu 2007 Laural Barrett Christchurch 2006 Elizabeth Gray Auckland 2003 Sharee Adams Wellington 2001 Kateao Nehua Jackson Niue 2000 Tonia Peachey 1999 Kristy Wilson 1998 Rosemary Rassell 1997 Marina McCartney 1996 Sarah Brady 1995 Shelley Edwards 1994 Nicola Brighty 1993 Karly Kinnaird 1992 Lisa Maree de Montalk Semi-finalist 1989 Shelley Soffe 1988 Lana Coc-Kroft Television presenter and celebrity 1987 Ursula Kim Ryan 1986 Christine Atkinson 1985 Claire Glenister 1984 Tania Clague 1983 Lorraine Downes Winner Winner of Dancing with the Stars season 2 1982 Sandra Helen Dexter 1981 Donella Thomsen Semi-finalist 1980 Delyse Nottle Second runner-up 1979 Andrea Kake\n\nMiss World\n\nThe delegates who represented New Zealand at Miss Universe 1992-1996 also represented New Zealand at Miss World the year before they competed at Miss Universe.
