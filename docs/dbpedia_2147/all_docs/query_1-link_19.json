Raised in Aoteroa’s seaside town of Tairua, the raw soul powerhouse that is WILDLANES draws from nature, connection to community with a desire to share truths that empower, uplift & inspire.\n\nAt a young age, Laney encountered valuable experiences. From singing with Stan Walker, to countless nights singing in bars. While learning her writing craft by day, WILDLANES connection with local audiences in her Mt Maunganui community have seen the stages to grow from corners in Kiwi bars to significant stages supporting international touring artists and beginning to play major NZ, including Soundsplash 2023. NZ on Air supported the project via the New Music Development Scheme, joining WILDLANES talents with those of Stan Bicknell and Will Henderson among other industry mentors.\n\nWhether with her full band, or performing intimately, the stories and songs of WILDLANES are disarmingly vulnerable and inspiring. One part soulful, another spiritual, another liberated and free; above all, WILDLANES exudes a power that comes with growth and speaks to the hurt and hurdles that inevitably line the road to self-love.\n\nThe 5 tracks of the WILDLANES EP mark the early steps on a long road, one that feels filled with vision and warrants excitement.\n\nRed Dragonfly\n\nThe Red Dragonfly Dance Troupe was established in May 2018, originally named \"Floral Dance Team\".
