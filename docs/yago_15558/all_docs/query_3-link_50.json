        "text": "ALBUM REVIEW: HUWORONI\n\nI recently got my hands on Huworoni – the debut offering of Assamese rock band Artha. Made up of talented musicians from the State, Artha is a multi-genre outfit based in the capital. Huworoni was released earlier this year at Gauri Sadan in Guwahati by veteran guitarist Utpal Barsaikia along with a host of other guests.\n\nArtha comprises of Rahul Buragohain (vocals and rhythm), Shivaji Bora (bass), Pranjal Gogoi (lead), Fredi Roy (rhythm and keyboard) and Prashanta Talukdar on drums. Based on contemporary themes, most of their compositions and lyrics would appeal to the present-day youth, especially those living outside the State. Huworoni – the title track of their debut album is a case in point. Drawing on strong emotive lyrics, the song dwells on the longing of people who live outside their native place for their homelands.\n\nThe album begins with the track Hontrakhbadir Kahini which dwells on the realization of a terrorist of his mistakes and his desire to return back to lead a normal life. The title track, Huworoni, which is divided into two parts follows up next. The other compositions are all based on contemporary themes like love, longing and frustration which I am sure would find a lot of takers amongst the younger lot. Jodi Xodai, for instance, dwells on the feeling of frustration which besieges people at periodic intervals, while Loi Juwa and Najanu Kiyo are both love songs. Based on melodic tunes, what attracted me the most about the majority of the tracks was the smart acoustic manoeuvring that is a predominant feature in the entire album.\n\nTalking about their debut offering, Artha vocalist Rahul Buragohain says, “Assam has a rich and diverse culture and we have put in efforts to reflect our culture in our music. Our songs are catchy and melodious for we want to connect to the people through them. At the same time, we have tried to focus a lot on the emotive content in our lyrics.”\n\nArtha was formed in the summer of 2006 by Rahul, Shivaji and Prashanta while they were pursuing their studies in engineering, says Rahul. He adds, “We performed at various college fests all across the country such as IIT Kanpur, amongst others. Soon after completing our graduation in 2009, two new members, Fredi and Pranjal, joined the band as guitarists. We have been playing mainly in Delhi and other parts of Northern India.”\n\nAll the tracks in the album have been written and composed by Artha along with Arunjyoti Gohain and Rishi. While four songs were recorded in The Quivers Studio in Dibrugarh, the other four were recorded in the Noisegate studio in Guwahati. The songs have been edited and mixed by Arunjyoti Gohain in Quivers studio, Dibrugarh.\n\nRate this:\n\nJessie Sparks wins Musicbizbro’s search for best artist;\n\nIndia’s Mayuresh Kelkar follows a close second\n\nThe results for online Indian music business consultants Musicbizbro’s online contest for artists and bands which ran through the months of September and October were declared recently. Melbourne-born singer, songwriter, pianist Jessie Sparks was adjudged the winner of the Artist/Band contest, while the runners-up are Mayuresh Kelkar (India) and Jackson Church (USA). The winner of the lyric writing contest is Jamie Meyer (Sweden) while the runner up is Sal Belloise (USA). Jessie, who had released her debut Indie album in 2007, had been a serious contender and with her seductive and intelligent music, she is all set to make a mark in the global arena.\n\nTalking with The Sentinel, Musicbizpro CEO Neli Kools said, “The contest received an overwhelming response with well over 500 entries from all over the world. Sponsored by Hollywood Music in Media Awards (HMMA) and Music Connection in the USA, the contest has been quite a success. Moreover Musicbizpro’s partnership with Music2Q has helped the winner pitch their work for a Canadian movie come next spring.”\n\nThe songs under Artist & Band contest were judged on its vocal performance, song selection, originality, uniqueness and artistic merit. The lyrics writer contest were judged on its song structure, composition of melody and harmony, scansion (rhythm/meter) and content of the song.\n\nKools further said, “For this contest, MusicbizPro brought together an exceptional panel of judges. The competition was judged by a team of experts comprising of professional artists, songwriters, journalists, publishers, session players, producers and other distinguished professionals. The contest was promoted on a massive scale at Music colleges & Universities, performance venues and music retail shops in the USA and in India and all over the web. In India the promotion was done in the cities of Mumbai, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Indore, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata.”\n\nRate this:\n\nNature in its varied aspects is the predominant aspect in the works of artist Upasana Bora, whose debut solo art exhibition got underway in the State Art Gallery last week. A familiar face in the art fraternity of the State, having participated in a number of workshops and group exhibitions, this was her first solo art exhibition. The exhibition was inaugurated by noted singer Sudakshina Sharma.\n\nA post-graduate degree holder in graphic arts from Vishwa Bharati University Kala Bhavana Shantineketan in West Bengal, Upasana’s debut solo exhibition has around 42 of her artworks being displayed. “The artworks exhibited have been done over a period of eight years. I started working on graphic arts since I the time I joined the Government College of Arts and Crafts in 2008 for my graduations,” says the artist.\n\nTalking about her art, Upasana says, “Nature, which is the source of all inspirations, is the medium I use to express myself in my art. It’s only through nature that I can feel pleasure, pain, despair, delight besides logic between other sensations. I find a lot of similarity between the female form and nature since both are responsible for the existence of life forms as well as for living pleasure.”\n\nAnimals like the deer and butterfly and natural forms like mountains, leaves are some of the recurring elements in her artworks. “I have been fascinated by the deer since I was a child. But in my works, the deer does not stand for an animal but for a man.”\n\nThe female torso is another theme which the artist uses to express her ideas. “Out of all my works, I have tried to explore my ideas with a female torso, indicating that in spite of getting all liberties there still exists bindings, restrictions and barriers around the familiar ambit of nature. The same applies to all human beings who are all embedded within the ambit of nature.”\n\nThe exhibition concludes today.\n\nRate this:\n\nRock outfits of the country, especially the Northeast, have long had to grapple with the lack of opportunities – be it a platform to showcase their abilities or a medium through which they can reach out to the populace. Practitioners of the genre would say this is nothing new but given the immense pool of talent here, it is indeed sad that nothing much has changed over the past couple of decades. Despite the dreary scenario, however, the enthusiasm and efforts of a few people still manage to bring a smile to one’s face, proving that when it comes to rock the spirit is all that is required, is all that it matters.\n\nMeet Sanjib Kalita – a rock enthusiast who has combined his love for music and his expertise over the World Wide Web to create http://www.indianmusicmug.com/ – one of the most sought after music portals of the country, and even abroad. Witnessing hits from people in various parts of the world who all want a slice of the music scene of the region, the IndianMusicMug blog is a perfect example of how determination can move the greatest of obstacles.\n\nSanjib, a final year graduation student in a city college, says that the desire to provide his friends and fellow musicians with a platform to reach out to people was the sole objective behind starting his blog. As he says, “Given the lack of shows on television and space in the print media, I decided to start the web portal to promote the local talents by publishing their band profiles and reviewing their albums and singles. Since the web is not limited to any country or area, bands have been able to reach out to people all across the globe.”\n\nThe web portal has recently released an audio compilation, Metal Hangover 0.1, which has a number of Northeastern bands sharing space with other Indian and international outfits. The compilation was prepared with the basic objective of promoting the regional bands throughout the globe, says Sanjib.\n\nThe tracklist of the audio compilation includes the likes of Demonic Resurrection (Mumbai, India), Shift (Melbourne, Australia), Devoid (Mumbai, India), Testing Tomorrow (Los Angeles, California), Slain (Bangalore, India), Albatross (Mumbai, India), Phobia (Delhi, India), Shades Of Retribution (Duliajan, India), Weeping Roses (Guwahati, India), Violent Edge (Guwahati, India), Asylum (Mumbai, India) and Doorstep Casket (Guwahati, India). More than 200 copies of the album was downloaded across the globe on the day of its release.\n\nThe going, however, has not been easy for Sanjib who lacked the resources to launch and maintain a website. “Though I had nurtured the idea of launching a website for a long time I was not able to proceed because I didn’t have much technical expertise in the subject. I finally gathered enough money to register the domain name and include some appealing designs with a new server very soon.”\n\nThe young music promoter also feels that the overall rock scene in the region needs to undergo a major makeover if it has to win the favour of musicians, youth and guardians alike. “A number of gigs are organized in pubs these days but many youngsters and their parents are hesitant because of the use of alcohol and other narcotic substances there. As such, I feel that more gigs and concerts should be organized in open spaces, parks and other recreation areas.”\n\nRate this:\n\nIn a commendable initiative to promote our age-old folklores among the younger generation, a compilation of folk stories from the Northeast was recently released in Dimapur. The book, which has folktales from all the eight States of the Northeast, is also marked by vivid and highly attractive illustrations. Folktales from the North East of India has been edited by Hekali Zhimomi, Lanusangla Tzudir and Akanito G Assumi. The illustrations were also done by Assumi. The book was released by NEZCC director Som Kamei.\n\nDuring her tenure at NEZCC, Zhimomi worked tirelessly for the promotion and development of the art and culture of Northeast India. The recently released book is one such endeavour. Talking about the book, she says, “The folklore of a group of people carry their history, beliefs and creative imagination. The North East is a rich storehouse of folklores told and retold from generation to generation. To many communities of the Northeast, folktales are not just stories but a vital link to their past, enabling them to make sense of who they are as a people helping them preserve their unique cultural identity. With rapid changes and external influences fast affecting the communities of the Northeast, the stories have been silenced in many places and homes, particularly in the urban areas. This book, which is a compilation of folk stories from the north east, aims to reach out at children and help them connect to their roots, understand their history and identify with their cultural environment.”\n\nThe book has a total of forty folktales, five from each state. So while youngsters can now read the mythical tales of Tejimola and Queen Komola KOnwari of Assam, they can also at the same time learn about the origin of the Kwai eating habit of the people of Meghalaya. From the invention of the pena (a traditional music instrument of the Meiteis of Manipur) to how the Nagas stumbled across the procedure of making rice beer – the book truly touches upon a host of myriad topics that is bound to bring the reader closer to his cultural environs and appreciate his or her roots.\n\nLanusangla Tzudir has a doctorate in history from Jawaharlal Nehru University while Akanito G Assumi, who is a pass-out of the National Institute of Design, is an animation film designer, illustrator and photographer. Recalling how the project started, the editors said they had to travel a lot to gather materials for the book. Starting with a shaky foundation, the project took about a year to complete.\n\nRate this:\n\nThis year, the prestigious Shilp Award was handed over to noted music composer-director duo Jitu-Tapan for their enormous contributions to the field of music in Assam. The Shilp Award was instituted by the Government of Assam to honour people who have contributed significantly to the cultural world. The award is bestowed every year during Shilp Utsav, the death anniversary of Assamese cultural icon Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla.\n\nIn a career spanning more than four decades, Jitu and Tapan (Jitu Sharma and Tapan Bhattacharya) literally gave a makeover to the Assamese music industry. Inspired and guided by stalwarts like Mohammad Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar, the duo were also one of the first representatives of Assam to Bollywood, having worked as music directors in as many as 35 Hindi movies and around 7 television serials. Anutaap, Morisika, Tyag, Deuta Dia Bidai, Manab aru Danab, etc are some of the Assamese films where they have worked.\n\nOne of their most memorable achievements would be the creation of the song, Asomire sotalote rodalire senehote – one of the most popular and memorable songs in Assamese – which they created in association with Mohammad Rafi.\n\nBoth Jitu Sharma and Tapan Bhattacharya, who are related to each other by blood, grew up in Jorhat district of Assam. Having begun their early lesions in music under Darpanath Sharma and Shyam Sunder, both were deeply engrossed in the world of music from a very early age. Receiving the award from Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, soft-spoken Jitu said that the recognition had made him the happiest person in the world.\n\nRate this:\n\nIn a country with over a billion people, countless languages and multitude of musical influences, it takes special talent to stand out from the crowd as an entertainer. Luckily talent is what Assam’s Kalpana has sacks full of.\n\nOne of the most popular Bhojpuri singers in India right now, Kalpana came to attention in 2002 with her breakout hit album, Gawan wa leja Rajaji. Since then she has become a household name having performed on over 150 Bhojpuri film soundtracks, 100 Hindi film songs sung ,recorded more than 400 radio and television jingles and presented Sur Sangram’s season 1 & 2 and other TV shows.\n\nKalpana has been finalized as the judge for the upcoming show Nehle pe dehla “ Nan he Suron Ka Maha Sangraam” on Mahua Tv. The show will showcase the singing prowess of children from both UP & Bihar. In an age where talent coupled with great looks gives one the extra edge, the versatile singer is leaving no stone unturned as she gets ready to make a smashing appearance as one of the judges on Mahua Tv’s childrens music reality show NEHLE PE DEHLA. Apparently, Kalpana has been meticulously planning her looks as she wants to look young and contemporary. New hairdo, revamped wardrobe, a chiselled body… Kalpana can give even the Bollywood heroines a run for their money.\n\n‘Let’s get innocent hearts closer. The show will bring together raw talented kids from all over UP & Bihar. The participants will be in the 8-13 years age group. Nehle pe dehla is a musical forum and opportunity for budding talent for children from UP & Bihar, says Kalpana, and adds, “Mahua channel came up with this unique concept, something different – a show that will have kids from all over UP & Bihar teaming up in a singing reality show where boys will be competing with girls. The girl’s team is boosted by Kalpana whereas the boy’s team is goofed by Pawan Singh.”\n\nKalpana believes that only those who sings well and performs well should win the show. But she also adds, “On a personal note, I support the girls as participants because when I entered the Bhojpuri industry, girl singers were not seen with very good eyes. Achhe Ghar Ki Ladkiya Nahi Gati Hai –the so-called society said. I entered the industry with bhajans, modern songs and even hot item numbers – but proved that singing can also be a professional career for girls. The scenario has changed and I am lucky to have set the trend.”\n\nKalpana is an amazing mentors and she has personally handpicked every contestants by indoor and outdoor selection rounds in Patna, Lucknow, Banaras and other places. At present she is busy with her world music project THE LEGACY OF BHIKHARI THAKUR to be released from Times Music, trying to relive the country’s long-forgotten treasure of Bhojpuri folk music.\n\nRate this:"
