        "text": "Peter Bradshaw's tribute to Ingmar Bergman (July 31) was marred by unthoughtful nostalgia. While it is arguable that in Britain commercial and institutional support for a cinema of ideas is at a low ebb, there never was a golden age when it was generous. Nor is it true that film-makers, outside Africa and Iran, fail to tackle serious moral issues. In my view, examples of some who do would include, to mention a few at random, Laurent Cantet (L'Emploi du Temps) Aki Kaurismaki (Drifting Clouds), Rajan Khosa (Dance of the Wind) and Andrey Zvyagintsev (The Return).\n\nIn most countries, including Britain, there are audiences for thoughtful films and film makers who try to make them, but in Britain both have been frustrated by perverse policies which have increased subsidy to film via the tax regime, but cut or reduced funding for the fringes of the business which struggle in a market dominated by multinationals. The market by itself did not sustain the career which led to Winter Light and in Britain Bergman's films were not launched and made famous by cinemas controlled by multinationals.\n\nMargaret Dickinson\n\nLondon\n\nThe death of Bergman reminds me that in my youth the BBC would actually show an Ingmar Bergman or an Akira Kurosawa season, but these days such adventurous programming is beyond them. It is where I learned that cinema was more than Hollywood.\n\nHenry Girling\n\nLondon"
