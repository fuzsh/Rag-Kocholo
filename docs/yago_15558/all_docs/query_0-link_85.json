        "text": "In mid January, the skies over Gujarat and Maharashtra are gaily speckled with kites, diving, soaring and getting at each other. This day marks the solar ingress into Capricorn. In the north, the advent of spring is also celebrated with kite contests. To be acclaimed the victor, the flier must ‘kill’ nine kites. The victorious kite or Naushervan is then cut loose, and is the most sought after souvenir among kite chasers. Also, by tying the vanquished kite to your own, you can fly two kites simultaneously.\n\nIn my childhood memory, Makker Sankranti was assocated with three things – kite flying, til laddus and a chilly wind in the air. Some schools declared Makker Sankranti as a holiday, so it was common to see groups of youngsters and some adults collect on terraces of their buildings to fly kites. They would pose challenges to each other to cut down the kite. This is beautifully rendered in Rajan Khosa’s film Gattu, with the excitement of bringing down the big one. Gujaratis would head for their home towns in Gujarat just for that day of flying kites. Soon the Gujarat Government capitalized on the kite craze and introduced a Kite Festival.\n\nKites are a tribute to man’s genius for they are the most versatile of all his inventions. Kite flying can be a pastime and a national sport; kites have been used for espionage; they have enabled scientists to study weather conditions and wind velocity, in the nascency of scientific development. They have also been regarded as weapons to ward off evil spirits.\n\nSome historians maintain that the kite was invented in 5th century BC by a Greek, Archytes of Tarentum. But the Chinese claim that it originated in their country in 206 BC. It was then that General Han Sin of the Western Han dynasty routed his enemy by creating an eerie image of his foe in the sky with the use of kites. During the Boer War, Capt Baden-Powell of the Scottish Guards lofted a spy on a kite over enemy territory. While Lord Hastings used it as a battle signal.\n\nIn the late 1840s, a young boy named Homan Walsh sailed a kite across the Niagara Falls making it possible to lay a thicker line and a cable. This helped in making the first railroad suspension bridge between the United States and Canada. Walsh was paid $10. In 1901, Marconi used a kite to hoist an antenna on the receiving station in Newfoundland to send radio signals across the Atlantic.\n\nThe Wright Brothers – Orville and Wilbur – would never have been aviators had they not been kite enthusiasts.Benjamin Franklin used a kite and key to prove that electricity in lightning was the same as that produced in laboratories. In 1983, Douglas Archibald, an Englishman, flew a kite with an anemometer and measured wind velocity at 1,200 ft.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the US Weather Bureau (now National Weather Service) used kites for weather forecasts. They used the Hargrave or Box kite – flying three or more kites strung in a row along a piano wire. The kite at the highest altitude recorded barometric pressure, temperature, wind velocity and humidity by means of a meterograph."
