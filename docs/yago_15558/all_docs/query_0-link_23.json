A protÃ©gÃ© of the great tabla masters Ustad Allarakha and Ustad Zakir Hussain, Suphala is fluent in a diversity of musical traditions that inform her unique compositions and her highly improvisational performances.\n\nThe three albums she has released to date â Instru Mental (2000), The Now (2005) and Blueprint (2007) â go beyond the limits of genre and style while referencing such diverse influences as Western classical, Indian classical, jazz, folk and soul. Her concerts also break down boundaries: she made history in early 2005 when she traveled to Kabul, Afghanistan as the first musician to play in public since the fall of the Taliban.\n\nThe musicians she has recorded or performed with include Norah Jones, Perry Ferrell, Edie Brickell, Vernon Reid, Timbaland, Sean Lennon, 4Hero, Harper Simon, Yoko Ono, Vijay Iyer, Joan Osbourne, and Michael Bland among others. The artistic alliances Suphala forms â including ensembles with vocals, strings, woodwinds, reeds and percussion â are an integral part of her innovative approach to making music. With her unique rhythmic and melodic vocabulary and production chops that are both rigorous and inventive, the next phase of Suphala's evolving musical expression is bound to continue a trajectory rooted in a deep understanding of the proud legacy of the tabla and a passionate commitment to expand the scope of its expression and to communicate it to the wider world.\n\nCassim Shepard is the editor of Urban Omnibus, an online publication of the Architectural League of New York. Trained in filmmaking, urban geography and urban planning, he produces non-fiction media about cities, buildings and places. He has exhibited video work at the Musee de la civilisation, Quebec; the Cineteca di Bologna; the Salone del Mobile, Milan; the Venice Architecture Biennale 2006; and the United Nations, where his most recent video project chronicled life in six informal settlements around the world for the Cooper-Hewitt exhibition Design with the Other 90%: CITIES.
