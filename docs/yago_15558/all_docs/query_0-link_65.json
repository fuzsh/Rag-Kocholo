        "text": "The image at the header of this post is an illustration of a large female figure and a small girl figure, face to face with each other.\n\nDisclaimer :Metronome , by definition(1) is a mechanical or electrical instrument that makes repeated clicking sounds at an adjustable pace,used for marking rhythm, especially in practicing music. While practicing indian classical music, one uses a device called electronic Tanpura or a Shruti-box which produces a drone-like background, similar to that of an actual instrument, Tanpura. A smart phone can also have an application called Tanpura Droid, a digital replacement for the electronic version. One can change the scale,pace, volume and notes according to the preference. The sound of Tanpura is very powerful and forms a ‘canvas’, as my teacher Anjali Malkar puts it, for what comes later, your musical expression. But if one is to look at it as a sound, it is monotonous and repetitive in nature. There is a similar device for practicing rhythm (lay and taal) simulating the supportive role of tabla during practice. Metronomic devices such as these are considered the most essential for practice (riyaz) and well as performance. The role of these devices is to provide a background of a particular sound that helps the singer stay in pitch and maintain rhythm. The metronome of beats, by offering a form of continous rhythm adds the dimension of time, within the composition. In this series of arguments, I look at the idea of metronome,as a metaphor for repetition, tradition and convention.\n\nIn Practice of Metronome I examine the method of using and teaching metronome and argue that the method, in spite of being instructive gives rise to innovation in an improvisational* framework of practice of hindustani classical music. I argue this with the intention of concluding that the repetition has a role to play in learning of an art form through the examples from practice. During this process I build on some of the ideas of intuition, understanding and learning from classics that came up during the discussion forum, reading circle and classroom discussions with my peer and students.\n\nThe tuning of the instrument that assists the singing is considered very crucial. The tabla artist gently hammer the sides of the tabla to stretch the leather surface which will in turn result in a particular pitch and tone when drummed with fingers. This is done to match the pitch of the tabla with the pitch of the singer and the Taanpura ( the tonal drone). The musicians spend considerable amount of time tuning the instrument. One can watch demonstration of Taanpura tuning by Shri. Ajay Chakravarty and Tabla Tuning by Sandeep Banerjee. The videos demonstrate a very intricate process that needs listening and engagement of the entire body. The similar engagement of mind and body continues into the performance.\n\nThe videos also demonstrate the instructive nature of this process. The student is not given the instrument until one observes the teacher tuning the instrument. The student then slowly takes over the task as and when one feels ready for it. The meaning of instruction according to the dictionary (2) is – Instruction is vital for education, as it is the transfer of learning from one person to another. Any time you are given directions or told how to do something you are receiving instruction.\n\nThe noun instruction is related to the word structure; both share the Latin root structus, “built.” The use of the word as we know it today appeared in the early 15th century from the Old French. Today it refers to the action of teaching and the job of a teacher. It can also be used to denote the directions themselves. Consider the word’s connection with structure: effective instruction is presented in an orderly, structured manner.\n\nIn case of learning practice of hindustani classical music, the idea of instruction goes closer to the word’s latin origin, ‘built’, which in turn is closer to the idea of structure or construction. It is interesting that instruction shares a root with the idea of construction because much of instructive learning in case of hindustani classical music is supposed to give rise to constructive knowledge. I will try to elaborate upon the irony in this fact by looking at both the words from the pedagogical lens.\n\nAccording to modern cognitive theories, learner does not construct knowledge by absorbing information transmitted by external sources such as teacher or textbook. The learner constructs experiences or participates in an experience to construct knowledge for himself/herself(3). In case of classical music, the learner repeats after the teacher not only in initial stages but also at higher stages of learning. The teacher transmits the information (and knowledge) to the student. In case of learning music, this transmission although has a dimension of musical experience. Watch the initial part of this clip from the film, ‘Dance of the Wind’ by Rajan Khosa here. Although it is a sensory experience, the learning of the craft of this experience is as repetitive as chanting of the religeous texts.\n\nThe act of repetition after instruction, as my colleague Riya Banik (4) pointed out, is actually an act of creating understanding of an understanding. She says, “A metronome is not mindless, it is a very conscious effort to embody your learnings, be one with it to create the foundation of learning hence it is not copying without understanding, it is very much creating the understanding while you absorb the process.” She also refers to Gregory Bateson’s ‘learning to learn’ theory which describes repetition in learning as levels that describe orders of recursion, a hierarchy of logical types not a hierarchy of contents (Keeney 1983; Woodsmall [no date]). As orders of recursion, the levels are like nested loops or Russian dolls.(5) Riya elaborates further saying, “He says the idea of`learning to learn’ is a more sophisticated form of learning, orders of recursion can only be `generative’.\n\nI extend this argument in context of recognising patterns in the transmission and trying to repeat them in order to understand them, much like a child who is learning to write words by recognising phonetics in them. I support my view by rephrasing Christopher Alexander’s argument about Pattern language. He says that one of the timeless ways of learning is by recognising patterns. In case of a music that I am taking about, these patterns are ‘shown’ by the teacher to a student and student repeats them, to understand them. That understanding is assumed to give rise to student’s own recognition of patterns.\n\nThe concept of laya is completely subjective and the pace of laya can change into Vilambit (slow), Madhya (moderate) and Drut (fast) during the performance, each having its own purpose in the unfolding of raga. The matras (beats) divide the rhythm at timely intervals that can change according to the composition.\n\n(image curtesy: http://chandrakantha.com/tala_taal/jhoomra/jhumra.html)\n\nThe aspect that is considered subjective from the western lens, is actually an adaptation of pace of things in the Universe. The connection of self,(pulse and beat of the body) to this pace and to the life of it is what is demonstrated in a performance. The subjectivity contributes to the improvisational nature of the music.\n\nThe nature of this music is such that it thrives on improvisation over a framework. The improvisation happens in real time in front of the audience unlike in the western classical music, where the entire music is written down and performed. It could be this nature of the music that requires an extensive internalsiation of patterns only to be built upon later. There is a sense of immidiecy to this method of learning. There is not much time between the teacher’s singing and the student’s imitation when the session is going on. If I may borrow from Francisco Varela where his proposition of understanding ( and knowledge ) as something residing in the relationship between body and mind and not only a storage of reasonings in the brain cells (6). I think the involvement of the body in teaching and understanding the concept makes a difference to the otherwise linear perception of instruction making it ‘three dimensional’ even at its reception.\n\nMy colleague Riya asks me what if the repetition becomes a harmful drill? yes, there is a possibility that the ritualistic repetition can make someone leave learning music during the initial period even if one has an inclination for the art form. The encouragement at such moments become crucial for someone to cross that bridge between repetition and enjoyment. Benjamin Zander, a musician in his TED talk (7)calls the aspect of enjoyment, one buttock playing in context of Piano. He talks about understanding impulse inherent in the music and recognising it while playing the piano. He is essentially talking about the role of feeling in making and learning of art and its indispensibility in the scheme of things. The aspect of feeling is again, something that happens in the entire body.\n\nI henceforth tend to conclude that the practice of repetition and imitation in ‘metronome’ is a design to ‘tune’ the body and mind of a learner by nurturing skill, that grows alongside one’s practice, in fact its inseparable from the practice. The ‘skill’ will hold the ‘thought’ , is an undercurrent of this traditional learning system.\n\n~\n\n(1) https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/metronome\n\n(2)https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/instruction\n\n(3)Johar, Anat, Two Possible Pedagogies for Teaching Higher Order Thinking: Transmission of Information Versus Knowledge Construction, Higher Order Thinking in Science Classrooms: Students’ Learning and Teachers’ Professional Development,Volume 22 of the series Science & Technology Education Library pp 121-137\n\n(4)Riya Banik is an educator, my colleague and co-learner in the MA class\n\n(5)https://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/1198/1/fulltext.pdf\n\n(6)Francisco J.
