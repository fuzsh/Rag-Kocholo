        "text": "Alan Rickman, an accomplished British actor and director, was born on February 21, 1946, in London, England. Born into a working-class family, Rickman's love for drama sparked during his school years, leading him to attend the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). His performance in Les Liaisons Dangereuses earned him a Tony Award nomination, launching his career into the stratosphere. However, he is most recognized for his iconic roles in film, particularly that of Professor Severus Snape in the globally acclaimed Harry Potter series. Rickman's acting prowess extended beyond the magical realms of Hogwarts. He showcased his versatility by playing an array of diverse characters. In Die Hard, he played the villainous Hans Gruber, setting a benchmark for Hollywood villains. His portrayal of Colonel Brandon in Sense and Sensibility showcased his ability to embody the romantic hero, while his role in Love Actually further solidified his status as a beloved figure in British cinema. His unique voice, coupled with his nuanced performances, earned him a place among the most respected actors of his generation. Away from the camera, Rickman was also known for his directing endeavors. His directorial debut, The Winter Guest, received critical acclaim and paved the way for future projects. As an active patron of the arts, he supported numerous charities and served on the board of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, nurturing the next generation of talent. Alan Rickman's enduring legacy continues to inspire and influence artists worldwide, proving he was more than just a man behind the characters; he was a true embodiment of the arts.\n\nDavid Hockney, (born 9 July 1937) is an English painter, draftsman, printmaker, stage designer, and photographer. As an important contributor to the pop art movement of the 1960s, he is considered one of the most influential British artists of the 20th century.Hockney has owned a home and studio in Bridlington and London, and two residences in California, where he has lived on and off since 1964: one in the Hollywood Hills, one in Malibu, and an office and archives on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, California.On 15 November 2018, Hockney's 1972 work Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) sold at Christie's auction house in New York City for $90 million (Â£70 million), becoming the most expensive work by a living artist sold at auction. This broke the previous record, set by the 2013 sale of Jeff Koons' Balloon Dog (Orange) for $58.4 million. Hockney held this record until 15 May 2019, Jeff Koons reclaimed the honour when his Rabbit sold for more than $91 million dollars at Christie's in New York."
