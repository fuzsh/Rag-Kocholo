        "text": "TREASURE TROVE OF CLASSICAL MUSIC IN MODERN INDIAN CINEMA\n\nBY PRITHVIJEET SINHA\n\nPRITHVIJEET SINHA from Lucknow, India, is a post graduate in MPhil from the University of Lucknow, having launched his writing career by self publishing on the worldwide community Wattpad since 2015 and on his WordPress blog AN AWADH BOY'S PANORAMA besides having his works published in several varied publications as CAFE DISSENSUS, THE MEDLEY, SCREEN QUEENS, BORDERLESS JOURNAL, ASPIRING WRITERS' SOCIETY, LOTHLORIEN POETRY JOURNAL, CHAMBER MAGAZINE, LIVE WIRE, RHETORICA QUARTERLY, DREICH MAGAZINE, THE EKPHRASTIC REVIEW and in the children's anthology NURSERY RHYMES AND CHILDREN'S POEMS FROM AROUND THE WORLD ( AuthorsPress, February 2021)\n\nHis life force resides in writing.\n\n***\n\nTreasure Trove of Classical Music in Modern Indian Cinema\n\nIt all begins with our recent exposure to the stirring musical ambience revived by Chaitanya Tamhane's THE DISCIPLE. It is a cinematic work that has percolated to the cultural consciousness in its painstaking examination of artistic pursuit, making that timeless issue echo throughout the world. But above narrow definitions of any given category, it has liberated viewers to capture the essence of classical Indian music canon.\n\nFor this afficianado, the film was a point of reference to remind viewers and readers of the treasure trove of Indian filmmaking that has dabbled with classical music and dance to exemplary degrees. However, there's a clear pattern marking most of them. They are different from the mainstream, often relegated to being arthouse classics or left-field works boasting of commercially successful performers. It is a welcome parallel to the state of classical arts in general; it is hence not just a case of making the issue one of selective taste or classes alone.\n\nFact remains that classical music remains to be a huge part of our cultural understanding of the ancient gifts which we have miraculously preserved to this day and age. Indian cinema, a more dynamic and versatile entity than we give it credit for, has beautifully enabled that cultural revival through the decades.\n\nHence, the idea behind this rich treasure trove brings me to one of the most underrated works that pays tribute to the beauty of Indian classical singing like very few can.\n\nDANCE OF THE WIND(1997), an international co-production, is a labour of love by its writer – director Rajan Khosa to his land and its people. In its prologue, he beautifully lays down its purpose of paying tribute to the ancient Guru – Shishya parampara ( teacher to disciple tradition) that has been constructively ingrained in Indian annals of recollection and exemplification. That is what makes the sentiment personal and relevant, at a cultural crossroad where those values are rapidly eroding and self- centered individualism has overtaken the counsel of elders and their overall wisdom per se."
