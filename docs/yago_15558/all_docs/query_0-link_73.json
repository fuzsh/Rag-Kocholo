        "text": "In the total darkness, poetry is still there, and it is there for you. Abbas Kiarostami (1940-2016) The work of mourning involves an interiorization of the one who has passed away, a turning of the dead to an appropriated image. Derrida thus reminds us of the ethics of an impossible mourning in which the dead remains within and at the same time beyond us. The gaze of the dead addresses us from within but remains unappropriated. In 2016, world cinema lost Abbas Kiarostami (1940-2016), one of its most influential auteurs—a filmmaker who has been credited as one of the poets of cinema in the twentieth century, along with Ozu, Rossellini, and Tarkovsky. With the impossible mourning and unassimilable gaze of Kiarostami in mind, this panel invites contributions that reflect on his rich cinematic legacy and, more broadly, on the relation between cinema and poetry. What is the border, if any, between the so-called poetry and prose cinema? What are the limits and potentials of thinking cinema through linguistic terms? Whither poetic cinema in the 21st century? Interested participants are invited to share their thoughts along the following lines: • The Ends of the Poem / The Ends of Cinema • Rethinking Pasolini’s “Cinema of Poetry” • Poetic Gaze/Cinematic Gaze • Intersemiotic Translation between Poetry and Cinema • Impossible Mourning between Poetry and Cinema • Poetic Critiques of Sovereignty and the Question of Cinematic Life (and Nothing More) • Poetic Indeterminacy and Cinema • Rhythm and Poetic Temporality in Cinema • Experimental Cinema and Poetic Techniques • Poetry and the New Wave Cinemas across the World • Modernist Poetry and Cinema • Digital Technology and Poetic Cinema • Kiarostami’s Legacy in Iran and Beyond While contributions in dialogue with Kiarostami’s cinema are encouraged, works invoking other filmmakers and poets are welcome as well."
