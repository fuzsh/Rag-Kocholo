        "text": "Pallavi, a successful singer of classical Hindi music, watches with great concern as her ageing mother and teacher approaches the end of her life. This Karuna Devi was a legendary and – as is clear in a wonderful scene – a much better singer than her daughter. Before her mother dies, her death is announced by the appearance of an old man and a small poor girl. Then Pallavi loses her voice. Her career gets bogged down and she loses her students. Pallavi becomes increasingly confused and at last even her understanding husband can’t get through to her. In despair Pallavi goes in search of the little girl who announced her mother’s death. When she finds her, she also meets her mother’s guru, Munir Baba. Through the girl, Tara, who unlike Pallavi does have a natural talent for singing, Pallavi will get her voice back.îDance of the Wind is a beautiful combination of Western and Indian cinema. Despite the subject matter that is unknown to many Europeans, Khosa’s drama is very accessible. The quest for her own voice, also a metaphor for the position of the director, is beautifully designed; the film makes the best possible use of the exotic setting."
