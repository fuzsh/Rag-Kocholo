        "text": "A classical Indian singer loses her voice and finds it again only after finding herself in “Dance of the Wind,” a highly Westernized production that utilizes an entirely Indian cast and setting. Story’s predictability is the chief minus in this beautifully wrought, exotic voyage into the rarefied realms of Indian music. Mystical elements add a further attraction for Western auds, who could find the characters a little on the cold side. With its co-producers covering most of Western Europe, pic should find its path to selected arthouses brightly lit, followed by TV sales to other territories.\n\nPallavi (Kaushalya Gidwani), a successful classical singer, is preparing with trepidation for separation from her aged mother and teacher, the legendary singer Karuna Devi (Kapila Vatsyayan.) In an exquisite scene showing mother and daughter exchanging musical phrases, Karuna coaches her less-gifted daughter in the Hindi musical tradition.\n\nThe trauma of Karuna’s death, announced by the appearance of an old man and a ragged little girl, causes Pallavi’s voice to disappear. In short order she loses her career, her students and her husband (Bhaveen Gosain). Retreating into solitude and close to madness, she finds the little girl Tara (Roshan Bano) again, and through her meets her mother’s guru, Munir Baba (B.C. Sanyal). In an eerie scene mirroring the earlier one, Pallavi learns to sing again by copying Tara’s haunting intonation. It is actually Munir Baba’s voice, channeled through the child, that will lead her to a more profound understanding of her art.\n\nThough the drama of the artist’s crisis has been overexposed in movies, along with the idea that an artist must sacrifice all to achieve excellence, pic’s exotic setting gives it a bit of a new spin.\n\nIn the lead role, top Indian TV star Gidwani is a chilly Pallavi whose dedication to her work seems to cut her off from life. As her mother, non-pro Vatsyayan is even more glacial. Compared with their cold professionalism, Bano’s delightful Tara embodies the natural wisdom that equates singing with play, and draws the childless Pallavi into a warmly human relationship.\n\nThere is a magical quality to the three women’s voices and their songs. Much of the music was composed by Shubha Mudgal, a classical singer who studied in the guru-disciple tradition. As unfamiliar as the Hindi music idiom is, director Rajan Khosa (making his feature bow) manages to make its beauty leap off the screen. His understated approach, which leaves nothing unsaid or unexplained, creates an ideal bridge for Western viewers to the other culture. He is aided by fine technical work all around, from Piyush Shah’s soft-hued lensing to Amardeep Behl’s quietly refined production design."
