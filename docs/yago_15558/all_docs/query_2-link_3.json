        "text": "Pallavi (Kitu Gidwani) , a successful classical singer trains with her mother to carry forward the Hindustani musical tradition. She is good but not as much skilled as her mother is. Her mother Karuna took training from an old man. He never performed on stage but used to give lessons to his students. When Karuna started to perform on stage , he cut off all contacts with her. He detested glamour world. The trauma of Karuna’s death, announced by the appearance of the old man and a little girl, causes Pallavi’s voice to disappear. Slowly her relationship with her husband (Bhaveen Gosain) becomes strained. She slowly loses her students and her career takes a backseat. Retreating into solitude, she finds the little girl Tara (Roshan Bano) again. Much of the music was composed by Shubha Mudgal, a classical singer who studied in the guru-disciple tradition. Director Rajan Khosa used music in crucial points to capture the essence and mood of the film. The film is spiritual but it is extremely honest in it’s approach. In other words,it located in Indian culture. Khosa didn’t opt for any dishonest trick to make it global.\n\nYet, it has an universal appeal. He is aided by fine technical work all around, from Piyush Shah’s soft-hued lensing to Amardeep Behl’s quietly refined production design. I always liked to watch KItu Gidwani. She has been an extremely talented actress. Instinct affects her acting more than anything else. Bhaveen Gosain is known in theatre circuits. He just did this film only. Here, he gives a very convincing performance as a caring husband. Vinod Nagpal shines in a very short role."
