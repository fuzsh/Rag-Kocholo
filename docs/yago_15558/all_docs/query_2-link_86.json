        "text": "JAGAN NATH , INCHARGE WURA ( MARRIAGE KITCHEN)\n\nIn Kashmir , marriages were labour intensive . The marriage halls and the buffet system were nowhere to be seen .The families had to collect and store the foodgrains , spices , edible oil , timber ,cooking utensils ,bedding, flooring and anything and everything needed for the marriage . The relations and the neighbours would send young volunteers who were the much needed workers for the marriage functions essentially feasts . These workers would also help in the collection of major items like bedding and utensils from relations and neighbours . The neighbours would readily offer accomodation to the guests of the family marrying their son or daughter. Even Muslim neighbours would readily provide all possible help to Pandits during such events.This help was reciprocated by Pandits .The young workers would willingly work as waiters on the feast days. They would be available to the family for any work before and after the marriage .Everything was done without any remuneration. It was the practice . So was the culture and the tradition .\n\nDuring marriage functions, some trusted acquaintance or a close member of the family would be made incharge of the Wura or the marriage kitchen . The person had to be experienced apart from being firm . Custody and control over provisions ,vegetables, spices, and edible oil would be entrusted to him. He would sit near the Wura as the cooks arrived . Quite often he would sleep on the Voguv ( hay mat) near the Wura. He would be there til the cooking and eating was over. He would ensure proper discipline and order in the cooking and distribution of food to the invited guests. He would gossip with the cooks and keep them in good humour to ensure that cooking was done to perfection. The cooks or Wazas would go to him for anything and everything they needed. He would be asked to taste dishes once they were ready. The cooks demanded some money from him as Zang ( a sort of Baksheesh) if everything was perfect.\n\nA long hearth was erected with bricks and mud . This hearth was known as Wura in Kashmiri. Wura or the huge makeshift Chulha ( hearth) was created in open for large-scale cooking during marriages in the Kashmir valley. Timber ,generally from the willow trees was burnt in Wura for cooking many dishes simultaneously. Wura or the marriage kitchen was erected on an auspicious day as per Bikrami calender. The cook would come to erect Wura using mud and bricks. This cook had to be given' Zang ' comprising of rice, salt, and cash.\n\nCooking was done in big Degchas( brass pots ) that were usually collected from neighbours and relations . Special identification marks of these Degchas were noted in a diary to facilitate return. We would see marks like KN( for Kashi Nath) or MLR ( for Mohan Lal Razdan) or KKK ( Kanwal Krishen Kaul) engraved on the rim of the Degcha. Metal tubs, Kadaais , drums (for storing water) ,Samovars and Dullus were also collected from neighbours or relations who demonstrated unprecedented soldarity and support during such functions. Thalis (plates) ,glasses and khasus( bronze tea cups) were available on payment of nominal rent . In Rainawari , we would rent a boat ( demba naav) for these collections . It meant boating and a great entertainment. This activity would create new friends and newer bonds amongst the volunteers and workers who would be Mohalla boys and young relations of the family( solmenizing the marriage). A spirit of camaraderie was starkly visible amongst these volunteers and workers.\n\nWhile procuring provisions for the marriage and storing them, every Kashmiri Pandit family would buy three or more bottles of Rum for the cooks. This was done through friends or acquaintances who had some source or link in CSD outlets . The head cook would always bring three or more assistants for cooking food for the marriage guests .The feasts would have a variety in vegetarian or non vegetarian food . Food was served to guests in a Shamiyana .They were made to sit in rows .Before serving the food , some volunteers would carry water , soap and towels so that guests washed their hands . Therafter plates were laid in all the rows . It was followed by serving the dishes . Rice with some gravy dish was the last item. One could see the wotrkers and volunteers busy inside the Shamiyana carrying dishes and refilling their serving bowls . On an average 400 to 500 guests were invited . It could be more also\n\nI Knew one Jagan Nath whom I saw in many marriages . He was always assigned the task of looking after the marriage kitchen. These assignments had created his popularity amongst the cooks ( Wazas ) . I have keenly observed Jagan Nath’s role in many marriages .I quote the communication between Jagan Nath and the head cook that I heard once in the marriage of a relation . In our recent past , we lived this culture and communication .\n\nThe head cook:-\n\n“ Nath Ji , cigerrette aav na kehn. Aeiss moklaavav ye krai-paak ta aeiss karav nendri ganta . Rum katie chhe, tseir guv na . Kyoothh chhus noon. Yathh thav zang. “\n\n( Jagan Nath Ji , get some cigarettes . We will finish this deep frying work and take rest for an hour or so. Where is the XXX Rum? We are late . Are the dishes tasty ?Put some Zang (currency notes ) into the plate .”\n\nJagan Nath ( Incharge Wura) :-\n\n“ Yim gayi cigerrette . Chaav me ti akha. Ye gayi XXX Rum. Yin zyada chakh. Vaeni chhuyi kaar aeti. Baraat iya subhas saada aath baje. Daftar valen gatchhi tayaar aasun. Akh gilaas thavizi me baapat tal kun. Noon ta maza chhukh zabar . Zang diyi yezman paanai . Ma he gham.“\n\n( Keep these cigarettes . Light a cigarette for me as well. This is your XXX Rum bottle. Don’t drink beyond limits . You have to cook some more dishes .The Baraat will be here at 8.30 in the morning .You have to keep food ready for those Baraatis who have to attend their offices . Make a drink for me as well and keep it hidden over there .The dishes that I tasted are well cooked . The Yajmaan ( family head ) will himself put currency notes in your plate . Why do you worry ?”\n\nJahgan Nath , the Wura incharge also had some sleep after gulping the glass of XXX Rum. I conclude this write up with some couplets from a Gazal of modern Urdu poet Zubair Rizvi. \"Hai dhoop kabhi saaya\n\nshola hai kabhi shabnam,\n\nLagta hai mujhe tum sa\n\ndil ka to har ikk mausam.\n\nBeete huve lamhon ki\n\nḳhushboo hai meray ghar mein,\n\nBook-rack pe rakkhe hain\n\nyaadon ke kayi album ......\"\n\n( sometime,it feels like sunshine\n\nSometime like shade ,\n\nsometime i feel it like a fireball,\n\nAnd sometime it feels like cool dew.\n\nEvery season within my heart,\n\nLooks and feels like you only.\n\nThe fragrance of time spent ,\n\nlingers in my house,\n\nAnd my book shelf is decorated by\n\nMany albums of memories alone .. )"
