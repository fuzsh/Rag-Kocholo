        "text": "For most of Hollywood's existence, racial segregation and prejudice forced great black artists to play minor or subservient roles. In many musicals they were only acceptable in what were called \"speciality numbers\", detached from the plot, which could be easily cut from the film on release in the bigoted South. As a result, the dazzling dancing duo, the Nicholas Brothers, can only be a footnote (or feetnotes) to the history of the Hollywood musical.\n\nHarold Nicholas, who has died aged 79, was seven years younger than his brother Fayard, and when they began in vaudeville aged seven and 14 respectively, lanky Fayard towered over his little brother. The better-looking Harold remained much shorter and slighter, but this did not disturb the perfect unity of their actions; any differences in their vertiginous dancing were revealed when they each did a solo spot during a number in an attempt to top one another in friendly sibling rivalry.\n\nThe sons of musicians, they and their sister began dancing at black vaudeville theatres billed as the Nicholas Kids. As a duo, they performed at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem in the early 1930s, moving on to the famed Cotton Club, and a short film called Pie, Pie, Blackbird (1932).\n\nAfter Samuel Goldwyn saw the brothers at the Cotton Club, he cast them in the tiny roles of street urchins in the Eddie Cantor musical Kid Millions (1934). Back on stage, they appeared in Blackbirds of 1936, which came to London. The Times critic wrote that the audience did not know whether to admire more Harold's \"twinkling feet or slow, baby smile.\"\n\nThe Nicholas Brothers' feet and smiles enlivened several Fox musicals during the 1940s. Among their show-stopping numbers was Chattanooga-Choo-Choo in Sun Valley Serenade (1941), which was sung by Dorothy Dandridge, whom Harold married the following year. They divorced soon after their daughter was born.\n\nHarold and Fayard also had snazzy dance routines in Down Argentine Way (1940), Tin Pan Alley (1940), and Orchestra Wives (1942), combining elegance with extraordinary acrobatics. They called their dancing \"classical tap\", a blend of jazz, tap, acrobatics (with supple splits), angular eccentricmovement, black vernacular dance and ballet.\n\n\"People always asked did we study ballet,\" Harold remarked. \"We never did.\" However, ballet choreographer George Balanchine cast them in The Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 and Babes in Arms (1937) on Broadway.\n\nIn the all-black musical Stormy Weather (1943), their Jumpin' Jive number provoked Fred Astaire to declare that it was the greatest movie musical moment he had ever seen. \"We had a huge set made of big steps,\" Harold recalled. \"My brother would jump over my head into a split on the step below me. I'd do the same thing over his head until we both got down on the floor.\" The brothers also dance on drums and leap over orchestra musicians.\n\nIn Vincente Minnelli's The Pirate (1948), their last feature together, Gene Kelly broke the colour bar by dancing with them in the rousing Be A Clown number. Dressed in the same blue-and-yellow motley, they formed a tumbling equilateral triangle in constant motion, a distinct change from the segregated specialities imposed upon the brothers during their screen career. Even though they are hardly distinguishable behind white clown's make-up, the routine was excised from the film in the South.\n\nIn recent years, Harold and Fayard were feted in the US, the subject of a tribute at Carnegie Hall in 1998, and recipients of honorary awards galore. They also charmed audiences in person at a season at the National Film Theatre in London a few years ago.\n\nBefore and after the Nicholas Brothers split up, Harold had a separate career. As a 12-year-old, he appeared in Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones; he introduced the song, Come Rain or Come Shine in the 1946 production of St Louis Woman; and later had a role in Sidney Poitier's Uptown Saturday Night (1974), as well as starring in the Broadway Duke Ellington musical Sophisticated Ladies in 1982 and in the touring musical The Tap Dance Kid (1985).\n\nThere is a wonderful moment in the film Tap (1989), when a young hoofer unwisely suggests a group of legendary old dancers has lost their legs. One of them is 68-year-old Harold Nicholas, who accepts the challenge with enthusiasm, and does his stuff, bringing back memories of the glory days of tap dancing and movie musicals.\n\nHe is survived by his brother, his third wife, a daughter and a son."
