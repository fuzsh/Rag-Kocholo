        "text": "SARATOGA SPRINGS – Legendary hoofers stole the spotlight from the thoroughbreds Sunday. Jazz tap dancing duo The Nicholas Brothers were inducted into The Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame at the National Dance Museum. “When the Nicholas brothers danced together they synergized such magic together,” said Constance Valis Hill, a guest speaker and author of “Brotherhood in Rhythm: The Jazz Tap Dancing of the Nicholas Brothers,” a biography of the Nicholas Brothers’ life and dance career. The brothers, Fayard, 86 and Harold, who passed away at 79 earlier this year, have shared screen and stage with Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington and Gene Kelly. Over their 60 years of dancing together, they are best known for their appearances in Hollywood musicals of the 1930s and ’40s. On Sunday, Swyer Studio filled with dance enthusiasts and special guests who came to honor the Nicholas brothers for their contributions to the world of dance. “You are an incredible star and an incredible human being,” said Katherine Hopkins Nicholas from the podium to her husband Fayard seated in the audience. “You are the most wonderfully beautiful gift God has ever given me.” To honor her late husband Harold, Rigmor Newman Nicholas read written homages to the Nicholas brothers from dance greats Leonard Reed and Maurice and Gregory Hines. Also in attendance was the Tony award-winning dancer/choreographer Savion Glover who has appeared on stage, film, and television. In tribute, Glover slipped on his tap shoes and dazzled the audience to its feet with a three-minute freestyle dance. “We really appreciate these men, as teachers, mentors and humanitarians,” Glover said, “They have taught me more about life than the dance.” After Glover’s performance Fayard and Rigmor stepped to the podium to accept their honors. The president of the museums’ board of directors, Heather Mabee, unveiled the 7-foot informative panel that will adorn the museum wall and that has still- photos of the Nicholas brothers in action and and a narrative written by Hill. Smiling, with his crystal award in hand, Fayard spoke to the dancers in the room. “My brother would have loved this and I hope we have inspired you to keep on dancing and I hope that dance will live forever,” Fayard said. Other inductees in the dance hall of fame include, Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, Fred Astaire and Martha Graham. The Nicholas Brothers are the first hoofers and dance team to be inducted."
