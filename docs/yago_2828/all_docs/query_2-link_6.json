        "text": "Dorothy Dandridge married Harold Nicholas on September 6, 1942, for Dorothy this was going to be the beautiful beginning of a life full of wedded bliss. Dorothy excelled in every role as a wife, she was a great cook and had an excellent taste for interior design. Harold was a good provider, but his love of golf and other women put a strain on their marriage. The birth of their daughter Harolyn, brought Dorothy immense joy and a renewed hope in her family. When Harolyn started showing signs of developmental delay, Dorothy was without her husband's support in finding answers from physicians. This was an emotional burden that was way too much for one to handle alone. Harold acknowledged how emotionally draining it was for Dorothy, \"It was a heavy load I left on her. Cause for her to be there alone to do all this, that was a heavy toll.\" Harolyn had severe brain damage, and stopped developing at the age of three. Dorothy always blamed herself for Harolyn's condition, and said that was the biggest hurt of her whole life. Dorothy and Harold's marriage continued to be strained and they were officially divorced in October of 1951. Harold had this to say about how he treated Dorothy during their marriage, \"I didn't treat her like I should have, as a loving husband should have treated his wife. Someone that her cared about and someone that he wanted to be with.\""
