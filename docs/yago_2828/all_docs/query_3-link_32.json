        "text": "Harold Nicholas, who as the younger half of the legendary black tap-dancing Nicholas Brothers inspired generations of hoofers with his grace and spectacular agility, has died. He was 79.\n\nHe died Monday of heart failure.\n\nThe Nicholas Brothers, Harold and his brother, Fayard, began their careers as children in vaudeville with their musician parents. They went on to stop shows on Broadway, in nightclubs, on television and in movies.\n\n\"We were tap-dancers but we put more style into it, more bodywork, instead of just footwork,\" Harold Nicholas recalled in a 1987 interview. \"I copied my brother. He was a natural dancer. Graceful.\"\n\nWith his brother and later as a solo performer, Harold Nicholas appeared in more than 50 movies, including The Big Broadcast of 1936 (1935), Down Argentine Way (1940), Tin Pan Alley (1940) and Sun Valley Serenade (1941).\n\nFred Astaire told the brothers that their dazzling footwork, leaps and splits in the Jumpin' Jive dance in Stormy Weather (1943) produced the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen.\n\n\"In Stormy Weather he had a huge set made of big steps,\" Nicholas recalled. \"My brother would jump over my head into a split on the step below me,\" he said. \"I'd do the same thing over his head until we both got down on the floor.\"\n\nThe brothers also appeared on Broadway in The Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 _ a production that also starred Bob Hope and Fanny Brice.\n\nFayard, born in 1914, and Harold, born in 1921, got interested in dancing from attending vaudeville shows while their parents played in the pit orchestra.\n\nThe brothers were good enough by 1928 to debut in vaudeville. In 1932 they made their film debut in a short, Pie Pie Blackbird, and got a booking at Harlem's famed Cotton Club. Movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn saw them at the club and cast them in the Eddie Cantor musical Kid Millions (1934).\n\nThe two became film stars despite racial restrictions that limited them largely to musical sequences that were sometimes cut from versions shown in the South. They finally danced with a white star, Gene Kelly, in their last film together, 1948's The Pirate.\n\nHarold's first marriage, to actor Dorothy Dandridge, ended in divorce after the two had a mentally disabled daughter. Dandridge was the first black actress to be nominated for an Academy Award for best actress. She died at 42 of a drug overdose.\n\nHe is survived by his third wife, Rigmor Newman Nicholas, and his brother, Fayard."
