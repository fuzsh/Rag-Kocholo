        "text": "Nicholas J. Rieth, age 80, a loving husband, dad, grandpa, great-grandpa and friend to many, peacefully left this world surrounded by his family on Friday, March 22, 2024, at Sharon S. Richardson Community Hospice. He was born to the late Art and Irene (Winter) Rieth on May 14, 1943, in St. Anna, WI.\n\nOn October 26, 1963, Nick was united in marriage to Betty Gries. The couple just celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary. Their love was an inspiration to everyone.\n\nNick was a hardworking man who dedicated many years of his life to the construction industry, serving as a Backhoe Operator for Wagner Excavating and a proud member of Local 139 Operating Engineers. He retired in 2000 and spent 12 years at Lakeside Campground in Montello as a groundskeeper. He also devoted over 30 years to the Cleveland Volunteer Fire Department as well as being a member of the Manitowoc County Arson Investigation Team.\n\nNick enjoyed hunting, fishing, cutting and splitting wood for his fireplace, sitting outside, feeding and watching the birds, driving David’s UTV, and spending time with his family. It was important to him that he called each of his children every day. He will be deeply missed.\n\nNick is survived by his loving wife, Betty; children, Karen (Ron) Perronne, David (Candy) Rieth, and Debbie (John) Blank; grandchildren, Joshua (Carly) Klopf, Ashley Rieth, Jacob Klopf, Christopher Rieth, and Rachel (Troy) Schmitt; great-grandchildren, Joy, Jason, Henley, Hayden, Josephine, Juliet, and Justin; sisters, MaryAnn Buelow and Diane Brunner and brothers-in-law, Harold Gries and Bill (Jean) Gries. He is further survived by a special niece, Cindy (Jerry) Kress, along with other nieces, nephews, family members and friends.\n\nAlong with his parents, Nick was preceded in death by his brother, Roger (Jan) Rieth; brothers-in-law, DuWayne Buelow and Tom Brunner and a son-in-law, Jim Klopf.\n\nA Memorial Service for Nick will be held at 1:00 PM on Friday, April 12, 2024, at Zimmer Westview Funeral & Cremation Care Center, W2132 Garton Rd in Howards Grove. Family will greet visitors on Friday, at the funeral home from 10:00 AM until the time of the service. Nick’s service will be livestreamed on his obituary page on the funeral home website.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, a memorial fund has been established in Nick’s name.\n\nThe family would like to thank the staff at both Vince Lombardi Cancer Clinic and Sharon S. Richardson Community Hospice for their care and compassion. We would also like to thank the Sheboygan Falls First Responders for the numerous visits to our home."
