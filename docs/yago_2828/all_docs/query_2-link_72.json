        "text": "When Dorothy Dandridge played a 1953 engagement at the glamorous Mocambo nightclub in Los Angeles, cigarette girls sold copies of Charles Alfred Kinsey's ''Sexual Behavior of the Human Female'' as a publicity stunt. That was one small measure of Dandridge's phenomenal sultriness, thanks to her rare mix of poised elegance and voluptuous beauty. Reviewing her great triumph on the movie screen, The Hollywood Reporter put it succinctly: ''Dorothy Dandridge in 'Carmen Jones' -- Wow!'' Describing another of her nightclub appearances, Time said aptly that she ''came wriggling out of the wings like a caterpillar on a hot rock.''\n\nLike her acquaintances Marilyn Monroe and Ava Gardner, Dandridge had allure that could bewitch an audience and demolish all memory of the nice girl next door. She had looks, talent, ambition, everything -- everything except a career. As an enticing black star of the 40's and 50's, she fell victim to bigotry, personal tragedy and one of Hollywood's great failures of imagination: after ''Carmen Jones'' in 1954, the year of Brown v. the Board of Education, there were no worthy follow-up roles for its incandescent star. She died at 42 in 1965, an apparent suicide, with $2.14 in the bank and much more than her share of regrets.\n\nAdored in her day especially by black audiences (''She was our queen,'' said Nichelle Nichols, who later went on to ''Star Trek'' fame), Dandridge later fell into relative obscurity. ''Carmen Jones'' is a television perennial, and filmmakers including Spike Lee (in ''Girl 6,'' whose heroine dreams of Dandridge as a role model) have offered glowing homages to her memory. But in David Thomson's ''Biographical Dictionary of Film,'' an invaluable reference book with 1,000 entries, where the D's go deep enough to include Mark Donskoi, Basil Dearden and Harry d'Abbadie d'Arrast, she does not even rate a mention.\n\nNow her memory is revived by ''Dorothy Dandridge,'' Donald Bogle's splendid and highly readable new biography (Amistad Press), and by a two-week retrospective (enterprisingly programmed by Mr. Bogle and Bruce Goldstein) at the Film Forum from tomorrow through July 3. In charting the course of her life, both the book and the film series also offer considerable insight into the racial climate that shaped Dandridge's rise and fall.\n\nAnd her story, which also has the makings of an extraordinary soap opera, will be heard again. Whitney Houston's production company is helping to present the series now that Ms. Houston has won a much-publicized battle for film rights to the biography. Others eager to star in the story reportedly included Halle Berry and Janet Jackson. (Among contemporary black female stars, it is Ms. Berry who comes closest to Dandridge's sexy insouciance and stately beauty.)\n\nFrom Churches To the Movies\n\nDandridge's story begins at a time when no mass-market movie about an alluring, tragic black heroine would have been undertaken. Born in 1922, she grew up well aware of segregation thanks to her career as a singing child star. First as part of the Wonder Children and then with the trio called the Dandridge Sisters (only one, Vivian, was actually her sister), she performed on the church circuit and then at the Cotton Club, where black singers were instructed not to mix with white patrons. Pushing her vigorously into show business were her mother, the character actress Ruby Dandridge, and Ruby's female lover, who cruelly disciplined the children. Dorothy had two stage mothers.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
