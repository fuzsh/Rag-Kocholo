At some point, she married Harold Nicholas Keogh. She became pregnant with his son.[2] One day during her pregnancy, she met with her sister-in-law Keigan at her family home.\n\nDuring their conversation, Betsy expressed disappointment at her husband’s lack of appearances at her doctor’s appointments. She also revealed to Keigan that she had entered her husband’s study behind his back and discovered payments from her father to her husband as a legal bribe. Keigan assured Betsy that she wouldn’t tell anyone but encouraged her to hire a lawyer for the future. The visit ended with Betsy asking Keigan to visit her again, to which she agreed.[3] Sometime after this, she would give birth to her son.\n\nAlternate Theories and Conclusions[]\n\nBased on Keigan's 8th Deduction quest, it appears Betsy may have later regretted informing Keigan about her husband's misdeeds, appearing visually upset.\n\nMentions[]\n\nLetters[]\n\nKeigan’s 2024 Letter\n\nDeductions[]\n\nClerk (Deduction Quest 8)\n\nOther[]\n\nClerk's Official Website Backstory"
