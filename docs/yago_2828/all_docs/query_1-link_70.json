        "text": "She was first choice for the role of Cleopatra but ultimately the role went to Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nIn September 1965 The New York Times reported that her death was caused by an embolism due to bone marrow particles from a fractured metatarsal bone in her right foot, that entered her bloodstream and reached her brain and lungs. However, the Los Angeles medical examiner attributed the death to an overdose of the anti-depression medication Tofranil.\n\nDelivered her only child via forceps at age 20, her daughter Harolynn Suzanne Nicholas on September 2, 1943. The father was her first husband, Harold Nicholas. Harolynn was born with a brain injury and reportedly died in 2003.\n\nHalle Berry, who portrayed Dorothy in Die Geschichte der Dorothy Dandridge (1999), became the first African-American to win \"Best Actress\" at the Academy Awards.\n\nShe turned down the role of Tuptim in Der König von Siam (1956), on the advice of Otto Preminger not to accept a role in which she was not the star - and Rita Moreno was subsequently cast in the role. The biopic Die Geschichte der Dorothy Dandridge (1999) also implies that Dandridge's refusal was because the character was a slave.\n\nWas considered for the role of Billie Holiday in a movie; however, the project did not materialize in her lifetime. When the movie did come to pass, the role was portrayed by Diana Ross.\n\nHer best friend was Geraldine Pate Nicholas Branton, former wife of Fayard Nicholas, of the tap dancing duo The Nicholas Brothers, who was her ex-brother-in-law.\n\nShe loved soul food. Her favorite was chitterlings and greens, which she ate only once a week.\n\nMadame Sul-Te-Wan was often rumored to be her real-life grandmother. In the definitive biography on Dandridge, by Donald Bogle, it is suggested that this rumor started because she played Dandridge's grandmother in Carmen Jones (1954)."
