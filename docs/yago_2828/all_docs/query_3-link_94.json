        "text": "Fayard Nicholas [1914 - 2006] and Harold Nicholas [1921 - 2000], constituted what was the most talented and spectacular power tap-dancing duo in the history of showbusiness. They grew up in Philadelphia where their parents played in the orchestra at the Standard Theatre, a vaudeville house. The brothers were soon in vaudeville themselves, billed initially as \"The Nicholas Kids\", alongside their sister, Dotty.\n\nBy 1932 they had graduated to the renowned Cotton Club in Harlem, where, for the next two years they delighted the all-white audiences and performed with the likes of Ethel Waters, Duke Ellington, and Cab Calloway. In 1936 the Nicholas Brothers made their Broadway debut with Bob Hope and Fanny Brice in The Ziegfeld Follies.\n\nA year later they were back on Broadway in the Rodgers and Hart hit musical Babes In Arms. Their film career had begun in 1932 with two short films, Black Network and Pie Pie Blackbird [featuring Eubie Blake and Nina Mae McKinney]. It continued with the Don Ameche - Betty Grable musical Down Argentine Way in 1940. The brothers later won a five year contract with 20th Century-Fox. The Nicholas Brothers contributed electrifying and superbly acrobatic dances to films such as Tin Pan Alley, The Great American Broadcast, Sun Valley Serenade [performing \"Chattanooga Choo-Choo\" alongside Harold's soon-to-be wife, Dorothy Dandridge], Stormy Weather, and The Pirate with Gene Kelly. In 1946 they both starred in the Broadway musical St. Louis Woman. As African-Americans, they were only allowed to be a speciality act in motion pictures. They were never considered for leading roles.\n\nStruggling with prejudice and racism in the United States, they worked in Europe in the 50s for several years where audiences and venues were integrated. Fayard decided to return to the USA, but Harold stayed in France and carved out a solo career. After seven years they were reunited in America and played in nightclubs and on television until Fayard developed arthritis and underwent two hip-replacement operations. Harold continued as a solo performer and was top-billed in the musical Back In The Big Time. Fayard was still active and won a Tony Award when he co-choreographed the 1989 Broadway musical Black And Blue. In 1991 the Nicholas Brothers received Kennedy Center Honors for their outstanding work over a period of more than 60 years. The documentary film, We Sing & We Dance, celebrated their wonderful careers and included tributes from Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines.\n\nHarold and Fayard left an indelible imprint on dance and the entertainment industry itself."
