So, what happened to Dorothy Dandridge's daughter?\n\nUnfortunately, Dorothy Dandridge's daughter spent almost her entire life with caretakers in a mental institution. Her father, Nicholas, was a famous dancer and a member of the world's most excellent tap-dancing pair known as the Nicholas Brothers.

In 1963, her late mother appeared on The Mike Douglas Show, right after being the first black actress to be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award. During the show, she revealed a dark secret she had kept for a long time.\n\nMy daughter had a brain injury at birth. I could sense that something was wrong when she was about two years old.\n\nDorothy was an upcoming young actress in 1943 residing in Los Angeles. She was newly married to her husband, Harold Nicholas. She was also expecting their first and only child together.\n\nHarolyn Suzanne Nicholas age of death\n\nIt is believed that she died in 2003. Some other reports indicate that she is still alive and in a mental health facility.\n\nHer mother went into labour, while at her sister-in-law's house, on September 2, 1943. Her husband was away with the car to play golf, and the delay in giving birth resulted in oxygen cutting off Harolyn's brain. The result was catastrophic as it led to permanent brain damage.\n\nThey presumed she was a normal child during the first year of the child's life. Not after her second birthday did they realize something was wrong. She could not speak even though her age mates were doing so.\n\nThey took Harolyn to a child psychoanalyst who presumed that both parents travelled much for work and thus, had inflicted psychological damage on their child. Later, they took her to a doctor who noticed something was wrong with the child.\n\nShe suffered from brain damage known as cerebral anoxia, a condition developed at birth. Unfortunately, it also meant that Harolyn would have a challenging and complicated life. The doctor told Dandridge;\n\nMrs. Nicholas, your daughter has brain damage; the best thing for you to do is give her up and have another.\n\nThe doctors convinced Harolyn Suzanne Nicholas's parents to give her daughter up to receive better care. Despite her career thriving, her personal life was crushing, and she, too, was dying inside. In 1954, she was nominated for Best Actress for her role in Carmen Jones, despite facing racism challenges.\n\nIn 1963, Dorothy was declared bankrupt and would sometimes be unable to pay her daughter's care fee resulting in her being dumped back to her. Finally, financial circumstances forced her to commit her daughter to a state institution for care.\n\nWho is Dorothy Dandridge's father?\n\nShe was born to her mother, Dorothy Dandridge, and father, Harold Nicholas, in 1943. She was mentally challenged due to brain damage suffered at the time of birth.\n\nHer father abandoned them when she was barely five years old. Dorothy Dandridge and Harold Nicholas had met at a cotton club in Harlem in 1938. Her parents married on September 6, 1942. Harolyn was born on September 2, 1943, and she was the only child the couple had together.\n\nHarold is alleged to have cheated on her mother numerous times with multiple women. The couple divorced, and Dorothy was married by Jack Denison.\n\nWhat happened to Dorothy Dandridge's daughter Harolyn?\n\nHarolyn Suzanne Nicholas's cause of death is severe brain damage which she suffered from the time of her birth. The condition prevented her from speaking or even recognizing her parents.\n\nDorothy Dandridge's mysterious death\n\nHarolyn's mother died a mysterious death in West Hollywood, California. Her lifeless body was found on September 8, 1965, and the cause was concluded due to be a drug overdose. She died at the age of 42. Her funeral was held on September 12, 1965, at the Little Chapel of the Flowers. Dorothy had one sister known as Vivian Dandridge.\n\nThe daughter of Dorothy Dandridge, Harolyn Suzanne Nicholas's story remains heartfelt to the world. Her life was full of pain and challenges, having been born with brain damage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Little known facts about Lil Durk's baby mamas and children\n\nBriefly.co.za recently shared less known facts about Lil Durk.
