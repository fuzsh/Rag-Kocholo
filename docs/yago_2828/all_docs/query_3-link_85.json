The family eventually settled in Pennsylvania, where his parents led the orchestra at the Standard Theater in Philadelphia. At 3, he was already performing with elder brother Fayard and sister Dorothy in a trio called The Nicholas Kids. Harold and Fayard were then booked on the radio show \"The Horn and Hardart Kiddie Hour.\" When the brothers then appeared in New York in March of 1932 at the Pearl Theatre doing a dance routine, they were spotted by the manager of the Lafayette Theater, who booked them to perform with jazz great Eubie Blake. That same year, they made their film debut in the short \"Pie Pie Blackbird,\" and on that strength, made a booking at Harlem's Cotton Club. Within two years, Samuel Goldwyn spotted them at the club and cast them in \"Kid Millions\" (1934). In 1936, when Harold was 15, the brothers appeared in the Ziegfeld Follies, and that appearance propelled them to international fame when they were signed to appear in a touring show called \"Blackbirds\" and visited several British cities, ending with London's West End. There, they picked up and incorporated classical dance into their repertoire. Back in the US in 1937, choreographer George Balanchine created a number for the brothers as part of the musical \"Babes in Arms,\" taking advantage of their highly acrobatic style. The 1940 film \"Down Argentine Way\" teamed their talents with choreographer Nick Castle and introduced Latin style to their repertoire. Twentieth Century-Fox then signed the Nicholas brothers to a five-year contract, \"Sun Valley Serenade\" (1941), featuring Dorothy Dandridge, who became Harold's first wife; \"Orchestra Wives\" (1942), and their legendary \"Jumpin' Jive,\" routine from \"Stormy Weather\" (1943), which featured an all-black cast, dated from this period. Gene Kelly then broke the color barrier when he insisted on appearing on screen with the brothers in the 1948 film \"The Pirate.\" It would be the brothers' last film together. When his marriage fell apart in 1949, he moved to France, making his home in Paris, where he lived for the next 15 years. He became fluent in several languages, toured in both Europe and North Africa, appeared in the 1963 film \"L'empire de la Nuit\" and recorded several albums. In later years, he appeared in \"Tap\" (1989), and the \"The Five Heartbeats\" (1990). The Nicholas Brothers were inducted into the first class of the Apollo Theater's Hall of Fame in 1986, received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1991, in 1998 the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award for Lifetime Achievement in Modern Dance, and in 2002 were inducted into the inaugural class of the International Tap Dance Hall of Fame. They have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7083 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nDancer. Entertainer.
