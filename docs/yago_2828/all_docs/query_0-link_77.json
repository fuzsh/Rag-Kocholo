        "text": "Harold Nicholas, the younger member of the dazzling tap-dancing Nicholas Brothers, died yesterday in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in New York City.\n\nThe cause was heart failure following surgery at New York Hospital, said Bruce Goldstein, a friend and a writer of the 1992 documentary ''Nicholas Brothers: We Sing and We Dance.''\n\nThe careers of Mr. Nicholas and his brother, Fayard, began in their childhood. Harold Nicholas continued to perform as a singer and raconteur into the 1990's as a guest artist with companies including Lynn Dally's Jazz Tap Ensemble, with which the brothers were to have appeared in a tribute this week in Los Angeles.\n\nThey danced in vaudeville, on Broadway, in nightclubs and on television. But it was their dancing in movie musicals that brought them the most acclaim and made them internationally famous.\n\nHarold Nicholas appeared in more than 50 films, from 1932 to 1989, including ''The Big Broadcast of 1936'' (1935), ''Down Argentine Way'' (1940), ''Tin Pan Alley'' (1940), ''Sun Valley Serenade'' (1941) and ''Stormy Weather'' (1943). The brothers' gifts were epitomized in ''Stormy Weather,'' an all-black 20th Century Fox musical, in which they seemed to explode on the screen in their trademark fast footwork and astonishing leaps and splits. Their ''Jumpin' Jive'' dance in that film, Fred Astaire told them, was the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen.\n\nIn that number the brothers danced on drums and leaped over the heads of orchestra musicians. ''Spins, cramp rolls, turns and crossover steps were woven into an intricate pattern of sound and movement, as the brothers spun out back-sliding rhythms that slipped smoothly from place to place on the stage,'' Constance Valis Hill wrote in her ''Brotherhood in Rhythm: The Jazz Tap Dancing of the Nicholas Brothers,'' published this year.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
