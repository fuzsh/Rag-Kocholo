        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25 - Fayard Nicholas, who with his brother Harold wowed the world of tap dancing with astonishing athleticism, inspiring generations of dancers from Fred Astaire to Savion Glover, died on Tuesday at his home here. He was 91.\n\nThe cause was pneumonia and other complications of a stroke he suffered in November, his son Tony said.\n\nFayard was 18 and Harold was 11 when they became the featured act at the Cotton Club in Harlem in 1932.\n\nDespite the racial hurdles facing them as black performers, they went on to Broadway, then Hollywood. Astaire once told the brothers that the acrobatic elegance and synchronicity of the \"Jumpin' Jive\" dance sequence in \"Stormy Weather\" (1943) made it the greatest movie-musical number he had ever seen. In that number, the brothers tap across music stands in an orchestra with the fearless exuberance of children stone-hopping across a pond. In the finale, they leap-frog seamlessly down a sweeping staircase.\n\nTheir polished urbanity and classic good looks made the Nicholas Brothers film stars despite the celluloid segregation that relegated them to nonspeaking parts and dance sequences that could be easily cut for racially squeamish audiences in the South. They finally danced with a white star, Gene Kelly, in their last film together, \"The Pirate\" (1948).\n\nAs children, the brothers were vaudeville brats who toured with their musician parents, with Fayard stealing dance steps and teaching them to his brother.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
