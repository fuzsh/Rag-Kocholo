Some people fly half-way around the world to experience (or force) this “moment” (guilty of that), while others have made it a daily occurrence or ritual (lucky them). Recently, I found myself on holiday in the most idyllic setting of Capri, Italy, but struggled to let go, despite the incredible scenery, swims and sunsets. I only got into the proper holiday spirit a few days before leaving; a little too late, I guess. Perhaps the busy holiday itinerary made me feel this way (why didn't I just stay put on one beach?!) But, it also made me realise I don't always have to go that far to find this feeling of…\n\nAndile Buka Andile, who hails from Soweto, has achieved plenty in his 30-something years of life. He published his first photo book, Crossing Strangers, in 2015; was awarded a Pro Helvetica Studio Residency in 2020, and has worked on a number of campaigns for Celebrated brands, while still managing to make time for personal projects.

In the water you are not heavy - your whole body holds all the complexity you will ever be. Of the many incredibly experiences I've had in the water, most recently I came home after a day of back-to-back meetings and just needed to unwind and to loosen up my tense shoulders. Kommetjie never disappoints with its breathtaking sunset palette. The sun was a deep orange, dancing with the ocean, its citrus-hued reflections flirting with the water's surface. To my right, shades of pink, orange and violet hovered above the mountain. I'd arrived in my swimming…\n\nThere is this photograph that hangs in our home. It is of me and my two daughters submerged in the warm waters of Anse Royale, Mahé,Seychelles. I have each daughter perched on either hip. Our haircuts are awful (DIYjobs since island life), but our souls are happy. Whenever I look at that photo it reminds me that never in my wildest dreams would I ever have believed that I'd spend a portion of my life living on a tropical island. It all started in 2011 when, at almost seven months pregnant with my first daughter, Chloé, I was invited on a media trip to the Seychelles, Probably not the best idea to travel when so far along, but there was no way that I was giving up the opportunity, especially as…"
