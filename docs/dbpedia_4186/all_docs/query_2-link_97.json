        "text": "High-energy cannabis strains can provide a burst of motivation, allowing you to keep active and crush the fatigue keeping you down. Or maybe you just prefer a good energizing strain in lieu of a morning cup of coffee, or to pair with hiking or exercise. Finding the perfect strain for you often requires a good deal of experimentation, but this list should give you a good jumping-off point.\n\nSome things to remember as you explore these strains:\n\nTHC-dominant strains are highly euphoric, and many of these varieties can actually cause sleepiness and a foggy head. The high-THC strains that appear in the list below are reported to be uplifting and inspiring, theoretically due to differences in their chemical makeup beyond THC. For high-THC strains, look for strains made up of pointed diamonds below.\n\nHigh-CBD strains or balanced CBD/THC strains contain much lower levels of THC, meaning they will provide only a gentle high (or no detectable high whatsoever). If you’re going for clear-headed relief of stress, choose a strain with little to no THC. For varieties containing CBD, look for strains composed of circles.\n\nAs you browse the strains below, pay attention to what colors you prefer—this can help you figure out what terpenes you like (or don’t like). Terpenes are aromatic compounds that determine the aroma and flavor of a strain, and may potentially be linked to various effects and benefits.\n\nDurban Poison\n\nPrimary terpenes: Not enough data\n\nCannabinoid profile: THC-dominant\n\nLate one night, I was struggling to finish an article and my eyes were beginning to heavy. I fired up my vaporizer, loaded some Durban Poison, and breathed in the sweet and spicy vapor. Within minutes, I found myself hammering away at the keyboard with resurrected creativity and engagement. Some suspect that this strain’s energy comes from elevated levels of the cannabinoid THCV (tetrahydrocannabivarin), but more research is needed to understand the effects of this molecule.\n\n“Durban Poison is like the “espresso” of cannabis. It wakes you up, cuts through the bleary fog and leaves you clearheaded and bright, gives you energy to go and seize the day.” –MrTibet\n\nFind Durban Poison nearby\n\nJillybean\n\nPrimary terpenes: Myrcene, caryophyllene, pinene\n\nCannabinoid profile: THC-dominant\n\nThe moment you unscrew the lid on Jillybean’s jar, the room fills with a sweet fragrance of oranges, honeyed mangoes, and sweet wildflowers. Jillybean is known to offer uplifting effects that make your mind soar with newfound inspiration without accelerating thoughts into a tangle of racy anxiety.\n\n“Great daytime fix for when you need to be social or productive. Gives a nice uplifting head buzz, but doesn’t ever weigh down your body. Leaves you motivated, happy, energetic, and focused.” –vinylvixen\n\nFind Jillybean nearby\n\nHarlequin\n\nPrimary terpenes: Myrcene, pinene, caryophyllene\n\nCannabinoid profile: Balanced CBD/THC\n\nSome people are sensitive to THC. It can make them anxious, paranoid, sleepy, dizzy, or dry out the mouth and eyes. Luckily, not every energizing strain contains high levels of THC. Take the high-CBD Harlequin for example. This strain provides a weightless sensation with minimal cerebral effects, making it an excellent choice for any tasks that require clearheaded cognition.\n\n“During my daily workouts I smoke a little Harlequin before strength training. It keeps me focused through the pain and helps to maximize my workout. It keeps me up and feeling good on my days off (I work graveyard shift).” – naturallyjass\n\nFind Harlequin nearby\n\nChocolope\n\nPrimary terpenes: Not enough data\n\nCannabinoid profile: THC-dominant\n\nMy go-to favorite for staying active, Chocolope is a fiercely cerebral strain whose uplifting effects will keep motivation flying high. Its earthy flavor pairs perfectly with coffee, and it just so happens that the strain’s energizing effects complement each other nicely. Long touted as the perfect “wake-and-bake” strain, Chocolope will leave you feeling unencumbered and motivated to take that long hike or hit the gym.\n\n“A great all-around daytime strain, Chocolope eases my worries and helps me get stuff done that I would be otherwise too stressed to handle. All of a sudden doing laundry, cooking, cleaning and running errands doesn’t feel like too much. This strain lifts the weight of the world off my shoulders and makes me want to do stuff!” – PhantomSpaceman\n\nFind Chocolope nearby\n\nGhost Train Haze\n\nPrimary terpenes: Terpinolene, myrcene, limonene\n\nCannabinoid profile: THC-dominant\n\nThis speedy strain is best saved for cannabis veterans and heavyweights. With a THC content high enough to put this strain on our list of strongest strains, you can count on quite the euphoric ride when you hop aboard the Ghost Train. For those of you who can hang with this extra-potent powerhouse, expect a trippy buzz that inspires appreciation of your surroundings, especially while outdoors.\n\n“When I smoke this, I really want to get up and go on adventures. I feel aware of my surroundings and can even focus very well. But, at the same time, feel very chill and carefree. Carefree is the best word to describe the feeling. You just feel ALIVE. You feel perfect.” – Shock_T\n\nFind Ghost Train Haze nearby\n\nGreen Crack\n\nPrimary terpenes: Myrcene, caryophyllene, ocimene\n\nCannabinoid profile: THC-dominant\n\nGreen Crack is a godsend for those of us who need a giant kick in the butt to get active. Though the raciness of its high can be too much for the paranoia-prone, imbibing in a comfortable setting often yields astonishingly stimulating effects. You’ll find your body humming with liveliness, fueling your desire to get out with friends and lose yourself to nonstop laughing fits.\n\n“OMG, this stuff made me want to rearrange my furniture for four hours. LOVE IT!” – itsmemsj\n\nFind Green Crack nearby\n\nXJ-13\n\nPrimary terpenes: Terpinolene, caryophyllene, pinene\n\nCannabinoid profile: THC-dominant\n\nLed by a pungent aroma of lemon, lime, and tropical fruit, XJ-13 is as much a pleasure in flavor as it is in effect. XJ has a way of simplifying life, encouraging you to let go of stress and emotional baggage. Unencumbered by mental weight, XJ-13 leaves you buzzing with newfound energy and allows you to take genuine pleasure in conversation, art, and activities.\n\n“This instinctively feels like an amazing strain for those with social anxiety as it brings your energy levels and creative thinking up. This may be a new favorite for the sativa lover in me.” – Koensayr"
