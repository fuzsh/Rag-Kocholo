        "text": "Right out of the chute and everything looks very cool. Love the official Cristo \"C\" logo.\n\nVery fond of those thin lap pools, too, b/c of a previous film we did.\n\nLooking forward to seeing more of your stuff...\n\nRezfactor said:\n\nWow! As always, great graphics, Justin! Very nice treatments there! Plus, a hottie! YES!\n\nThanks Rez! Ya, she's super nice too. Should be a fun lil film.\n\nThanks Jay... so far so good.\n\nJust had a small powwow to go over the final revisions of the script last night. JC and I are meeting again on saturday to finalize and flush out all the details. Should be good.\n\nLast thing I have to do is nail down the rental of an Underwater Housing for either the DVX or HVX. Not sure which to shoot it on at this point. Also, if anyone has access to a Jib, that would be super sweet! I'd probably need it for two days. (most likely a weekend) Possibly weekday.\n\nActors - Check.\n\nLocations - Check.\n\nGear - check.\n\nbrain - check.\n\n/j\n\nGeoff... HA! Seriously, I was thinking about that. I actually did that for a short film I shot last year. but, I ended up getting a few zip lock baggies and put in my digital camera and set it to movie mode. It was just so friggin' cold in the water, and so many baggies just caused it to be blurry as shit. For this shot, I'll need complete clarity of the actors.\n\nI've just started drawing all the storyboards so I'll probably post one or two in the upcoming days.\n\n/j\n\nGeoff_R said:\n\nYou could always use a giant ziplock bag for an underwater housing....\n\nHow deep do you want to go? You could use a large clear bucket/tub that is say is three feet tall with an open top. Stick the camera in the bottom and push the bucket in the water 2 1/2 feet. That could work. I of course would want completely submersed... but I'm crazy.\n\nEDIT: Hmmm... you want really clear, maybe this wouldn't work then.\n\nya, a clear bucket just won't do the trick. I'm ok with forking over the funds to get it done right.. (and safe). I had a scuba filmmaker all lined up, but unfortunately, she's about to move to florida so I won't catch her in time. Her friends are all pros and I just don't think I can afford the 6-700 price tag for all the gear, rental and services.\n\nI'm sure I'll think of something cool. Just gota find a sucker willing to throw his/her DVX/HVX in the thing and hope it doesn't spring a leak. Where's the guys from MYTH busters when you need them!\n\n/j\n\nWhat about a fish tank? or a large fish bowl which you turn upside down, put the camera in on a plate or something large and flat which you then 'gaff tape' to the fish bowl really well. Realistically, no water will get in due to air pressure. I really think this ''could work '' with a large enough round bowl, flip it upside and seal the bottom.\n\nAs a safety precaution against small amounts of water I'd wrap the camera with plastic wrap and even put some over the lens hood. That' won't mess your image up, I've used it outside for a rain shoot once.\n\nBrandon, So your DVX will be the test subject here? You really want to go with Geoff's fish tank with it?\n\nGeoff, man, there's no way I'd let anyone put their camera in a fish tank. Knowing the luck that be, it would flip over and flood everything. no way. I see what you are saying about the air pressure though. Surely one of those things couldn't be that much to rent. I bet they'd have some sort of insurance with it too to cover any dumb moves. maybe I could fake it.. take some still photos underwater, and then in AE do some cool bubblies and motion tracking? Nah.. that'll look dumb.\n\nCharli..\n\nStill looking for a composer. He's lost his marbles.\n\n/j\n\nlol. I don't think I'd do it either now that I think about it...\n\nBUT I have a cool idea...you empty the pool and then build an underwater housing dome complete with a above ground tunnel that will take you down! Okay...perhaps a little expensive...but very impressive!"
