        "text": "In Conversation w/ Nathaniel Stern & Sasha Stiles on Still Moving\n\nSpectrum interview coinciding with an curated Art Blocks Drop.\n\nread the interview in context on Art Blocks\n\nNathaniel Stern has been producing, writing about, and teaching digital art for more than two decades, and has presented his creative and scholarly work in an array of national and international contexts. Stern holds a B.S. in fashion from Cornell University, a graduate degree in computer art from the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University, and a doctorate in electrical engineering from Trinity College Dublin, and is currently Professor of Art and Design and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Director of UWM’s Startup Challenge.\n\nHis work has received funding from both the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts for projects ranging from digital art to a climate action startup, neurodiverse community building to books on ecological and interactive aesthetics. Stern lives with his wife, five kids, and half a dozen pets in a house built in around 1900, walks to work every day, and has made a habit of buying really funky prescription glasses—with more than two dozen pairs in his arsenal.\n\nSasha Stiles is a first-generation Kalmyk-American poet, literary artist, AI researcher, and author. Her most recent book Technelegy, co-written with GPT-2 and GPT-3, was published by Black Spring Press Group in 2021 and praised by Ray Kurzweil, among many others. A pioneer of algorithmic authorship, blockchain poetics, and publishing innovation, Stiles is also a co-founder of theVERSEverse, a literary NFT gallery. She holds an A.B. in English and American literature and language from Harvard University and a Master of Studies from the University of Oxford in twentieth-century literature, and her creative work has been featured in a range of international contexts.\n\nA sought-after speaker, Stiles has presented at Art Basel, the Brooklyn Museum, SXSW, Digilogue Istanbul, NFT.NYC, and VCA Invites: London, among others; and has served as Poetry Mentor to the humanoid android BINA48 since 2018. Stiles lives near New York City with her husband and studio partner, Kris Bones.\n\nJordan Kantor: Hi, Nathaniel and Sasha. It is a real pleasure to speak with you in advance of your inaugural Art Blocks project STILL MOVING. As a way to kick off the conversation, can you each talk a little bit about how you got into making art? Nathaniel, can you outline your journey first?\n\nNathaniel Stern: Both of my parents are English teachers. My father is a poet and Wordsworth scholar, used to write lyrics for Jimmy Radcliffe, and is still penning beautiful poems about my mother at age 95(!). I was encouraged to make music, write, and more generally be creative from a young age. That said—I guess as a form of rebellion of some kind—I went to an engineering high school, and was more or less happily on that path. But at 17, I was the driver in a reckless car accident where I, and others, were hurt. I began struggling with social anxiety and depression. (I probably always struggled with these, just beneath the surface, and admittedly still do). Art-making, music, and writing helped. I was already a voracious reader and listener, so I started exploring production in many forms. I joined several bands and wrote and performed live music (one of which was actually featured in Playboy magazine as a “band on the brink” when I was in college); started designing textiles and clothes, and sets and stages (I briefly interned with designer Nicole Miller); wrote stories and slam poetry (at CBGBs and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe back in the day); and dabbled in printmaking and more.\n\nI love experimenting and playing, was self-taught in a lot of this early on, and wound up pursuing fashion, music, and design in college. While there, in 1997, I took a class on Photoshop, and I was hooked. I couldn’t believe I could apply math and engineering in this way (run a filter, wait an hour … but it was so cool!). I used to hide in the labs when they closed, so I could stay overnight, to do things like scan spices, or bags full of water, or even flip over the scanner and traverse the lab (which later became a whole series of mine, with custom battery packs and my scanner in lily ponds, scuba diving, and elsewhere), then turned all of those into surface designs and prints. I started teaching myself very simple coding, and wound up at the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU right after graduation. Even then, for a long time I thought I would be a glorified designer sometimes doing art on the side.\n\nOne of my most vivid memories from this time is of my dad coming to my first group show at ITP. He and my mom had no idea what to expect; my mom thought installation art (I was doing a lot of embodied interactive work) was “like interior design but art,” and my pop thought I made web pages (he wasn’t wrong). But he sat down in front of a computer, and spent 35 minutes surfing and watching all of hektor.net—my first net.art project of video poems. hektor.net no longer works (it was all Flash and Streaming QuickTime and RealPlayer) but I have recently been salvaging several of its individual pieces and minting them with theVERSEverse.\n\nAnyhow, I had no idea what my father thought of it all while he watched—it was racy slam poetry performances intertwined with mythological and punk references, put through lots of digital effects. But eventually, he took out his earphones, turned to me with tears in his eyes, and said, “after all this time, you’re a poet.”\n\nThat was probably the day I decided that I was (a poet). An artist, too. It’s been a helluva ride since then.\n\nJK: Quite a journey, and what an evocative story with your father. Sasha, can you tell us a bit about your first forays into art?\n\nSasha Stiles: I’ve been writing poems and making multimedia text-based art my entire life. I published my first poem in a “proper” literary journal when I was a teenager, and have studied with many renowned writers; I met Allen Ginsberg when I was a student and he told me, “you have a way with words,” which gave me some confidence. At the same time, I’m not sure I ever identified as a poet in a traditional sense. I grew up obsessed with language artists like Cy Twombly, Carl Andre, Barbara Kruger, Glenn Ligon, Ed Ruscha, John Baldessari, Bruce Nauman, Glenn Ligon, and Jenny Holzer, and I’ve always felt most strongly drawn to hybrid poetics and poetry. I have a master’s degree in modern literature, but when it comes to creative writing, I chose not to do an MFA and, instead, to pursue a self-directed course of study that has allowed me to investigate more experimental areas, including visual and concrete literature; media-rich, electronically shaped text; and the poetics of technologies like AI-powered language models.\n\nFor me it’s never been “just” about the words. I love the idea that language is enhanced or altered by its presentation and arrangement … that through art and design, words can communicate beyond words. When I was young, I was obsessed with designing my own stationery and typefaces, making little books by hand. The tactility of language fascinates me: the way it feels in your mouth, in your hand, the way that paper and ink smells, the way it moves through your body. As the digital age has advanced, I’ve become even more curious about how the senses are involved in the production and interpretation and understanding of language, and how that’s impacted by increasingly frictionless, ephemeral interactions of text.\n\nI’ve also always been very interested in technology—thinking about my own relationship to it, researching cutting-edge examples of it. I was raised in a household immersed in scientific exploration, and for a long time now poetry has been my preferred mode of investigation, my way to study and understand complex topics that preoccupy me, from neural implants to artificial wombs to digital immortality to machine learning and intelligent systems.\n\nAlong the way, a few pivotal things happened.\n\nFirst: I have always loved reading sci-fi as well as nonfiction about advancing technologies and alternative intelligences, and I devoured books by the likes of Ray Kurzweil, Nick Bostrom, Martine Rothblatt, Ellen Ullman, and journals like Wired and Ars Technica … Through my reading and research, I became aware of a field called natural language processing—an area that has to do with using computer science and linguistics and AI to create machine systems that can understand and imitate the fundamentals of human language.\n\nI started learning about GPTs—generative pre-trained transformers, AI programs that can write like a human—and in 2018 I began writing poems with AI as a co-author—not just using off-the-shelf tools but fine-tuning and customizing them on my own writing and reference material. Online, I fueled my inspiration by seeking out AI-powered writers like Ross Goodwin, Allison Parrish, and Gwern Branwen, and thinking back to the generative work of Alison Knowles and aleatory writing movements.\n\nAround the same time, I met a humanoid android named BINA48, built by Hanson Robotics as an experiment in digital immortality. BINA48’s creators were probing whether off-earth data storage and future-proof tech could help us extend our lives and maybe even live forever. One day when I was talking to BINA48, she told me about her memories of gardening. The more I learned about this very poetic, very romantic project, the more I found myself wondering not whether a machine like BINA could write or read poetry, but why she might want to. Could an AI like her be not just intelligent but poetic? Imaginative? Wistful? Soon after, she became my poetry student, and I’ve been helping shape the literary mindfile of one of the world’s most advanced humanoid AI robots ever since. In one way or another, all my research and experimentation is about exploring new modes of human-machine collaboration, and challenging my own understanding of cognition and creativity.\n\nAll these forces—my interest in speculative technologies, my love of language, my growing fascination with questions of posthumanism, of the possibility of awareness or consciousness outside the human realm—have dramatically expanded my practice as a poet, and my understanding of what a poem can be and do, who or what a poet is.\n\nJK: Questions of posthumanism are some of the most pertinent and pressing of our day and obviously have issues of the technological baked in from the outset. Can you outline specifically how you each first got into digital or generative art, specifically?\n\nNS: It was really natural to me. It was obvious that I should scan physical media and make “dirty digital” work, rather than the clean lines that were easy in this new medium. If my body and its live performance was missing in the slam poetry move from stage to screen, then harsh lighting and extreme digital effects could make up for the crafted highlights I craved. I wanted audiences to move and be moved, to practice what those feelings might move them to do, so embodied interactive art was a clear step in that evolution. It wasn’t as linear as all that, of course, but getting my hands right into the bits of it all was definitely there from the beginning.\n\nAll this, and I was really lucky to meet and work with such incredible artists and thinkers. I stumbled into ITP by accident (my Cornell professor, Charlotte Jirousek, asked me to look at the site because she wanted me to design one like it for her, and I mistook her email as encouragement to apply to the program), and then took classes with Dan O’Sullivan, Leo Villareal, Marianne Petit, and Danny Rozin, worked alongside Camille Utterback, Jen Lewin, and Jessica Ling Findley, to name a few. Some of these folks are now well known, while all of them should be.\n\nAnd,and this is where Sasha and I are so sympathetic with one another, it was all grounded in this passion for words and literature, a strong foundation in social ethics and process philosophy. So when I moved to South Africa for six years after leaving NYU, wrapping in work with local dancers and praise poets, playing in William Kentridge’s studio and at museum residencies, re-thinking the digital within an African context … it blew my mind further still. I had to absorb it all and understand it better, so that became my doctorate and first book.\n\nThat pattern remains. Experiment and look, make and write, affection and reflection. It’s both my process, and what I hope for in my viewers. And “digital”—as medium and discipline, as concept and form, as potential itself—are always folded in with a long history of art and artfulness, synthesized towards open questions.\n\nSS: Even though I am an unrepentant lover of books and the power of the unadorned word, I began to regard my naked, printed poetry as a libretto of sorts—the nucleus of a fuller ecosystem of imagination and expression, or perhaps a kind of seed. What would happen if I planted my writing in the soil of new technologies? What if a poem could start on a page but grow and thrive in multiple dimensions, incorporating sound and light and motion? Where might the creative process take me if I augmented my own analog intelligence with a large language model powered by machine learning and rooted in the sum total of humanity’s written record—a turbocharged, nonhuman co-author? How and where might I be able to develop and share these evolving poetries in meaningful ways?\n\nFor me, hybridity has everything to do with a posthuman near-future of networked inspiration and intertextual language and literature—not replacing what we know, but starting to write the next chapter.\n\nJK: Such an incredible confluence of interests and experiences: I can see why you have such an intense creative partnership. Can you tell us a bit about how you each discovered the blockchain as a medium for art?\n\nNS: I’m not sure when I first encountered the blockchain. I remember a friend offering me a Bitcoin once in the early 2010s, and not being interested; in cryptocurrency’s infancy, I chatted to folks about the tech, not really caring much about its libertarian and capitalist foundations. My first real engagement was probably through Futherfield’s 2017 book, Artists Re:thinking the Blockchain. I love Furtherfield and everything they do (we go back to the early 2000s together) and would have paid far more attention in 2017 if I hadn’t been busy getting married, having more kids, switching departments, going up for promotion … I have vague memories of being invited into dialogue about it, to experiment with blockchain art on their list-serv, but I let it slip by until early 2021, when the market exploded. Even then, I was admittedly a naysayer. My plan was to make a highly critical work in the vein of my other networked performances with Scott Kildall, like Wikipedia Art (an editable artwork on the world’s most popular Encyclopedia) and Tweets in Space (exactly what it sounds like—tweets beamed to GJ667Cc with a high frequency, high amplitude radio telescope).\n\nBut … I take my research and art seriously. So when Scott and I scratched just below the surface, when I actually read Furtherfield’s book and spoke to people like Rhea Myers (we go way back as well), Simon DLR, and Sasha, I found earnest, interesting people using the platform as a disruptive, creative, collaborative, and empowering medium. DAOs made sense to me. Contracts following code as art peaked my interest in ways I didn’t expect. I started to think about ways we might “trans-act” that were non-monetary—not about ownership per se, but communicating, gifting, and receiving; relationships. The “words/code as performative” aspect of smart contracts was very appealing to my sensibilities. The work Scott and I produced wound up being collaborative and celebratory rather than highly critical, and I’m loving pushing the boundaries of what the platform affords. Some of the stuff I have in the pipeline take these ideas a lot further, try to use the blockchain itself to amplify romance and heartache in strange ways that tell us more about ourselves. It’s a fascinating time to be a digital artist.\n\nSS: In 2019, after “publishing” my digital, animated, multimedia poetry on Instagram for years, I began submitting to art venues like the Contemporary and Digital Art Fair (CADAF) in addition to the usual literary magazines, and curators started to take notice in a way that many poetry editors had not. My first IRL show of code poetry and AI experiments opened in 2020 at Art Yard, where we celebrated with a live AI workshop with my poetry student, the humanoid android BINA48; in the same month, the fashion brand Rag & Bone used my poetry on the runway at New York Fashion Week. Later that year, the curator Jess Conatser/Studio As We Are commissioned me to write a poem for Virtual New Year’s Eve, a metaversal experience organized by One Times Square and Times Square Arts. That show opened up a whole world of virtual possibilities, and introduced me to a slew of new media and crypto artists. Seeing my poetry alongside their artwork in the metaverse made me realize that there was tremendous potential in web3 for hybrid poets like me, who don’t just write but also perform and visualize and augment their words;poets who are artists. I realized right away that NFTs could be game-changing for my practice as a hybrid poet, and I dove right in.\n\nSince then, I have minted and sold poetry at Christie’s, SuperRare, Proof, Foundation, Hic et Nunc, Quantum, fxhash, Objkt, Versum, and elsewhere, and have been very fortunate to have my work exhibited in many prestigious analog and virtual realms, and to be invited to speak at literary, art and tech events worldwide.\n\nNonetheless, it was and can still be lonely for writers in a sea of crypto art. I was lucky to meet people like Kalen Iwamoto and James Yu and Aurece Vettier early on in 2021; we all instantly recognized the potential for writers in web3 and began building community and thinking about how to curate offerings and onboard more writers to the space. Later, thanks to the poet Artemis Wylde, I got involved in an on-chain poetry project called Etherpoems, where Kalen and I met Ana Maria Caballero, and we all joined forces, initiatives, and networks to create a blockchain-based poetry collective, which we launched as theVERSEverse in late 2021. We got off the ground with invaluable support from Gisel Florez, our art advisor, as well as some of my earliest collectors including Fanny Lakoubay and Kevin Abosch, and visionaries like my friends Sofia Garcia, Jesse Damiani, and Michael Spalter. It’s been a crazy ride ever since.\n\nJK: Yes, things do seem to move quickly in this space. Taking a step back, can you each reflect on how your creative process has evolved over time?\n\nNS: Starting out experimenting with digital, net.art, and interactive installation in the 1990s, I was used to this fast-paced, throw it online, get reactions, see what happens, kind of freneticism. My first major shift from that was when I moved to Johannesburg: everything slowed down. The internet, the pace of production, even getting around safely; I had to start anew with my understanding of the world—which was challenged quite a bit—and how I engaged with it as well as my networks within it.\n\nThere was also very little in terms of digital art at that moment in that city. I became part of the contemporary art scene, rather than living in a mostly digital world. I started engaging even more with the history of art and literature, with dancers and painters and printmakers, and found myself welcomed in museums and commercial galleries—not just digital festivals and pop-ups—so I started working on longer timelines and larger bodies of work. My first major solo museum show, The Storytellers, was in 2004 at the Johannesburg Art Gallery, and it had years of work in it, dozens of videos and prints (including printed ASCII art!), several installations, and interactive pieces. It was up for several months, and I got to meet and work with some incredible artists and curators that still influence me to this day.\n\nMy second shift was when I moved back to the US, after a brief stint in Ireland for graduate school, and because of UWM’s Office of Undergraduate research, I suddenly had student teams in my studio. Mentorship was heavily incorporated into my practice, and so was working more collaboratively with everything from conceptualization and production to travel and installation. I love having young people around, teaching me new things, challenging my ideas; and they get a lot out of being paid to work in a professional studio (by the hour, and also a cut of primary sales), meeting and working with other artists and curators. All of them go on to do great things, and my shows have only gotten bigger and more complex because of their contributions.\n\nAnd, more recently, the blockchain has worked to combine these two timelines, where I get to experiment and play and throw things up rapidly—make work that can only live online and on-chain—then take time to reflect on how such work might live differently in a museum or gallery several years down the line. STILL MOVING, for Art Blocks, is one of a few releases Sasha and I have done together thus far, and it is all pushing towards a large, IRL show that will span artist books, sculpture, installation, and more. I love not only working across disciplines and media, but also with multi-modal outputs that might bring new ideas, people, and possibilities to the fore.\n\nSS: On the one hand, I never thought I’d end up becoming poetry mentor to a young humanoid android, or selling poems at Christie’s, or getting to share my future visions with the likes of Ray Kurzweil. On the other hand, the work I’m doing now sometimes feels like the almost inevitable confluence of a lifetime of curiosities and obsessions, as well as a healthy contrarian streak, really wanting to do and question and investigate what I’m not supposed to. I’ve been told so many times that my AI writing “isn’t poetry,” that instead of writing about robots I should be writing about family and love and other “women’s subjects,” that I should get an MFA, that I should do what sells. But it’s doing all the things I’ve been warned against that has led me to discover my voice as a poet and artist. If I had stopped using AI or stopped minting NFTs as a reaction to the criticisms I received, I wouldn’t be here getting to explore what it means to publish a poetry collection as a series of generative editions, to co-author a series of embodied interactions enabled and linked by blockchain.\n\nJK: Following on this evolution, Sasha, I have seen you describe yourself as a “meta poet.” Can you talk a bit about what that term means?\n\nSS: I mean “meta poet” in the ancient Greek sense of “after,” “beyond,” “above” … My poetry tends to be language that is about itself, language that is self aware. I’ve always been really interested in the idea of the ars poetica—literally the art of poetry, poetry as an art form, a genre of poems that are about poetry—poems that explore the role of poets in society, the poet’s relationship to language and to the act of writing. In fact, my first sustained project in this area and also my first solo show in 2020 was called “Ars Poetica Cybernetica”—poetry not just as an art form but as a technological invention that has empowered consciousness and enhanced our human experience for more than thousands of years. The poetics of networked imagination, intelligent systems, the poetics of technology and communication.\n\nWhen I began working with AI, I referred to myself as a “transhuman translator,” layering human text with computer-generated interpretations and extrapolations as a new kind of poetic approach. It’s quite meta to think about how advancing technologies like AI-driven large language models and text to image tools can continue to expand and enhance our imagination and empower us to understand ourselves in new ways. And I think it’s very meta to make blockchain poetry inspired by the belief that poetry is one of the most profound and durable technologies we humans have ever invented—that poetry is the original blockchain, a data storage system developed before the advent of written language to preserve our most important information via poetic devices like meter, rhythm, rhyme, alliteration, assonance, and repetition.\n\nJK: Poetry as the original blockchain: that is a new way to think about collective consciousness and memory. Amazing. Can you talk a bit about how your art practice connects to (or departs from) other work you do? Your teaching or your work in neurodiverse community building, for example, Nathaniel?\n\nNS: I don’t really think of myself as a cutting edge artist. Rather, I most often come in just after those trailblazers have done their work, and the mainstream is aware of that new and different thing; folks are perhaps starting to talk about it, but mostly in black and white … Then, I nuance. I complexify. I bring one practice or discipline (or multiple) to another. I come in just after the crest of a hype cycle, and compare and contrast what’s happening to a similar dialog that came before (i.e., AI art critics now, as their comments relate to the negative photography discourse in the late 1800s), revel in the quality work that is just starting to happen, look for ways to poke and prod at the cracks and fissures that others found disappointing, but maybe find their beauty or tactility, or contrapuntally open them up further, but in different directions.\n\nI’m a synthesizer, an analog, an aesthete, and an engineer. It’s how I make art: experimenting and playing, hoping, and looking for something I didn’t expect that I can amplify, breaking down how that happened, understanding it through multiple lenses, moving, thinking, and feeling, then sharing. I love to share in my wonder.\n\nThat’s how I teach, too. I’m essentially in three departments:the departments of Art and Design and Mechanical Engineering, and our Lubar Entrepreneurship Center. I often say “I teach artists how to engineer, engineers how to art, and everyone how to sustain their passions” (the latter is how I define entrepreneurship). I try to bring curiosity and delight, depth and productive confusion to just about everything. There’s magic in that. My students (usually) love it.\n\nIt’s also how I engineer. The art leads to engineering (artificially aging phones for The World After Us turned into finding new uses for e-waste), and vice versa (my climate action startup that leverages the blockchain to convert small scale farms to regenerative practices was born out of a failed NFT drop with some friends). I am easily inspired by other people’s passions (how I wound up teaching creative technology to autistic teens in an effort to help build community, and an NSF mentor to a Sodium-Ion Battery startup) and I’m always looking for interesting opportunities.\n\nFor example, when I saw the NEA Research Lab call for proposals, I worked with the aforementioned team towards that grant to start the Autism Brilliance Lab for Entrepreneurship, quantifying and qualifying that work so it might be expanded nationally. When I was asked by Sasha to do AI poetry for theVERSEverse’s genText series, I figured GPT-3 would know all about Greek mythology—given the public domain texts it was trained on—but wondered if I could have the neural network tie it to space and the future, or if I could get the, the, the, the AI to stutter as a kind of performative space between (which became my still-in-process—though some are already available—12-piece collaboration with Anne Spalter, Future Mythologies).\n\nI guess I’m simply saying: there’s a lot to do, I’m naturally curious about things, and I want to bring others along for the ride. I’ve been super lucky (privileged) in what I have found. I’d add here that part of that luck (and privilege) is precisely in understanding how privileged I am, and doing my best to make an impact with it. I believe in the artist as a public figure, as both engaging and engaged; because the only things I appreciate as much as a beautiful and provocative work of art, are the discussions and actions that can grow out of one.\n\nGiven that, I also believe that generosity is key to contemporary practices of art. If art is a conversation, you gotta make people want to talk to you; you gotta be nice, you gotta ask questions, you have to not only be interesting, but interested—in other work and what others say and do.\n\nI believe in chit chat, in discourse, in studio critique, in humanity; I believe in art karma, in goin’ around and comin’ around, in sending folks to see things and meet people, and in sharing my tricks and my code and myself.\n\nTeaching is a part of my practice, and a part of my work. Writing is a part of my practice and a part of my work. Collaborating is always implicit in what I do, and often explicit towards the end of a given piece. It’s not a perfect approach; it can be hard sometimes, disappointing, I’ve been burned … but I’ve found openness and positivity to be an extraordinarily satisfying life most of the time.\n\nJK: Sasha, please tell us a bit about STILL MOVING.\n\nSS: I’d love to. STILL MOVING is an interactive, AI-powered poem about humanity’s visceral engagement with the virtual—written and published via the blockchain as a token word performance, and embodied by each collector as a uniquely intimate, personalized interpretation. Rooted deeply in my experiments with algorithmic authorship and my long-standing interest in how we engage with our digital devices, and in Nathaniel’s thoughtful, playful work in digital, interactive, and networked art, this long-form generative verse is intended as an on-chain ode to the relationship of bodies to machines. Literal and figurative wordplay activates the liminal space between text and reader, extending the two-dimensional screen/page into a somatic, material realm where language moves us in every sense of that phrase: up, down, sideways, forwards, backwards, and in otherwise inexpressible directions.\n\nUltimately, the project is an ars poetica about what it means to be a human body facing a machine: a showdown, a form of worship, a distraction, a mirror gaze, an other, an alter? After we bend to our technologies, do we spring back into shape, or assume new forms? Where does input end, and output begin? As we continue to think, work, and play faster than ever while rooted in place, it is still possible to be moved—really moved?\n\nThis impulse to reclaim our dynamism and intuitive physicality in an age of technological acceleration, bodily inertia, and rote gestures is something that Nathaniel and I have been engaging in separately for years, and began exploring together with COMPOSE (2022), a series of unique “pose/prose” poems commissioned for the exhibition “DYOR” at Kunsthalle Zürich. When curator Nina Roehrs asked about contributing a poem to the show, in collaboration with playrecordmint (a screen and sensor setup that enables a live audience to interact with and co-create coded artworks, which I first discovered thanks to my friend Leander Herzog) I immediately thought of my body language experiments created with PoseNet around 2019, and of Nathaniel’s long trajectory in this area, and we began working together to shape a piece that invited museum visitors to write a poem into existence with their bodies.\n\nSTILL MOVING is our fourth collaboration and represents a culmination (so far) of our combined years of research,experimentation, and art-making about technology and the body, of poetic performance, the intense physicality of personal expression, and the incredibly personal act of reading—in which any and every text offers a bespoke experience based on a reader’s background, memories, interests, etc. You could say that every reader is essentially a unique transaction hash that, when activated by code, triggers a 1/1 interpretation.\n\n‍STILL MOVING also embodies the future of web3 literature, in which the book—read-only—evolves into a read-write-interact experience, and authors begin to adopt such tools as webcams and NFTs in their writerly arsenal. Each unique edition is “written” via camera-based motion tracking (data confined to local machine only); human forms and gestures shape machine expression, and cybernetic serendipity inspires poetic association. Hence the wordplay of the title and the text: Make a move, and be moved; Stand still, and instill meaning …\n\nJK: So, what should collectors look for in the series as it is revealed?\n\nNS: Although I don’t tend to think of interactive art as subtle, the differences in each piece in this series are. Of course you’ll see lots of fun preview images with easter egg graphics, parts of the poem or poetic phrasings, a movie reference or even the occasional transaction hash itself revealed over time … But I’m more excited for when people play: different speeds and directions of the interactive animations, shadows and outlines and trails and curves … lines vs letters …\n\nFor me, this isn’t just about the generative attributes we can see. It’s about changing how we move, how we practice being moved, how we rehearse that movement by entangling and embodying words, actions, the blockchain, generativity, all of that, and none of that, and more in those awkward moments in front of our screens. I’m really hoping that collectors and viewers will not only share a JPG or screenshot, but rather perform–with different editions in the series, share videos with one another, talk through how it feels in real-time, how they relate to it as they do so, and learn from each other’s movements. It’s playfully serious, and seriously playful. I plan to try and model some of this with screen recordings the week before release, and I’m hoping for others to follow suit.\n\nJK: Sasha, do you have any thoughts about how this project participates in broader conversations in generative language poetry?\n\nSS: Generative is a word that’s very familiar to poets. We often talk about generative workshops, in which a teacher provides a prompt and we human poets free-write in response. And algorithmic authorship has deep roots in aleatory writing and the many avant-garde movements that experimented with mechanical or automated approaches to language. But still, it’s very rare to see poetry in the context of generative, digital art. The inclusion of this project on Art Blocks is a strong statement about the nature of poetry as an art form with a place alongside the many brilliant projects that are being developed and shared in this space. It says something very exciting about the rise of poetry collectors alongside art collectors—about the cultural currency of poetry.\n\nJK: Is there anything else you would like to share that would help viewers approach and appreciate your work?\n\nNS: I ask you to spend time with it. It is so easy to “own then dismiss” art more generally, and especially in the fast-paced world of digital art and NFTs. But there’s a lot there. There’s a lot to wonder about. I write books, and teach, and work on multi-year traveling exhibitions with documentaries and publications, etc., precisely because I am more interested in that complexity and nuance—in the discussions I get to have with other fascinating artists and scientists and thinkers—than I am in being first. I love working with Sasha because she is not only talented and smart, but thoughtful and intentional. She has so much integrity in what she does, and that is something I also strive for. Affection and reflection. Give me that half-hour my dad gave me for my poetry. Look at some of the work I’ve done over the past 25 years and try to make some of the connections I did—or your own, and tell me about them.\n\nI love being an artist. I love being alive. It is heartbreakingly beautiful. Let’s talk/think/make/write about it, together. Imagine what we could do, if we spent more time imagining what we could do…\n\nSS: I’m wary of what already seems to be a narrow view or a calcifying view of what AI-generated language and art sounds like or looks like … By layering a variety of perhaps unexpected approaches including moving type influenced by body language and a somewhat unconventional take on text-to-image/image-to-text, we hope to emphasize the tremendous variety, versatility, and creativity enabled by algorithmic tools. And as our respective artistic practices suggest, we are both very interested in what the future of language and literature holds; STILL MOVING is, I hope, a peek at one way in which storytelling may crack open and proliferate in a world of networked narration and imagination fueled by collective consciousness.\n\nJK: Thank you to you both for taking the time for this discussion, Sasha and Nathaniel. Before we close this conversation, are there any recent accomplishments you’d like to share?\n\nNS: That’s a hard question. I am always moving and am on to the next thing by nature, but I also don’t really put out much I don’t love (though there are plenty of projects I abandon; if you’re not failing, you’re not experimenting enough). Let’s see … I’m really proud of being curated on Art Blocks, to be honest! I’d also love for people to check out the documentary and catalog for my traveling museum show that is just ending its third and final leg—The World After Us: imaging techno-aesthetic futures—as well as its NFTs still available on Quantum. That show is probably the biggest and most complex of mine to date.\n\nBut, I’m most excited for what’s coming. Mother Computer, with Sasha, will be just as big if not bigger, and we recently found out we will be funded through the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s Office of Research to produce much of that art, a catalog, and series of artist books as part of the show. And I have three new, highly conceptual smart-contract-based works in the pipeline about love, time, gifting, and promises—romantic and cynical, sad and hopeful, and intensely careful—that could only exist on the Blockchain; I can’t wait to see how people feel about and react to them.\n\nSS: The audiobook of Technelegy—a four hour soundtrack with electronically enhanced spoken word and original music by my creative partner, Kris Bones—releases soon, as a media-rich publication as well as music NFTs. I’ve been working on this for two years and am incredibly excited to share it widely.\n\nThe Tickle\n\nTickle #82\n\nMonthly magazine for contemporary digital art and creative writing.\n\nThe literary feature this week is “Still Moving” from Sasha Stiles ( @sashastiles ) & Nathaniel Stern ( @nathanielstern ).\n\nIssue #82 features conversations with the artists Auriea Harvey ( @auriea ) and Eko33 ( @Eko3316 ).

AI AND MEMORY at @ EXPANDED.ART x The NFT Gallery, 11 April – 13 May, New York | London, where we showed and released Icarus and Ariadne, both part of our Future Mythologies series.\n\nWhen exploring new territories, it is often helpful to not walk alone. That’s probably why we see more and more artists collaborating on projects in the NFT space. Experiences can be shared and expertise combined. When Anne Spalter and Nathaniel Stern met, they both knew it was meant to be. Their encounter influenced their artistic practice and impacted their work with AI. Spalter and Stern have been collaborating ever since, exploring video, poetry, and AI.\n\nIn conversation with Anika Meier, the artists discuss their practice, working together, and the present and future of AI. And, of course, the conversation was also about Spalter Digital, one of the world’s largest private collections of early computer art, comprising over 1000 works from the second half of the twentieth century.\n\nread the entire interview with images on expanded.art. Text only is below\n\n–\n\nAnika Meier: Anne Spalter and Nathaniel Stern, FUTURE MYTHOLOGIES is your first collaboration. When and how have you met?\n\nNathaniel Stern: I had known about and been following Anne’s work for years, but I don’t think we met in person until she had an exhibition in Milwaukee, WI, at the St. Kate Arts Hotel. I’ve been in MKE for nearly 15 years, and that’s one of my favorite spots in town. At least four different people told me I had to go see her talk (brilliant!), and we also wound up sharing a meal thereafter with mutual friends. Not only did I absolutely love the work, but it’s what inspired me to finally get involved in AI and Web3. I began experimenting with both that very night.\n\nAnne Spalter: Yes! Multiple people that day told me they had invited someone named Nathaniel Stern, whom I really needed to meet. So I guess it was meant to be. I loved creating a solo show for the St. Kate’s art hotel in Milwaukee and used AI in most aspects, from GAN-based videos to large-scale inflatables based on AI-generated compositions. Nathaniel and I had productive conversations about AI right from the beginning, and I also learned that somehow he teaches full-time and has a family with five children in addition to his art practice. So I was incredibly impressed all around and a little jealous of his energy level.\n\nAM: When did you decide you would like to work on a project together?\n\nNS: Most of my early net.art in the 90s and 2000s was video poetry, and the majority of my work is text, textures, contextual… so I had already been working with theVERSEverse. When they asked me to do a series of AI poems for GenText, I wanted to do a new twist on some of that early work, where I had turned Greek mythological characters into slam poets—first in NYC venues like CBGBs and the Nuyorican Poet’s Cafe, then in streaming videos. In that early work, I had used a core story of my own as their new histories; this time, I wanted to mess with AI by doing things like making the AI stutter or overuse parenthetical thoughts, flipping known myths sideways, or putting the characters in faraway places. Ana Maria Caballero and I were brainstorming at NFT.NYC last year about who to ask to partner with me as the visual artist—since the whole series works in partnership—and we both jumped up and down when we thought to put our heroes in space and court Anne Spalter to be part of it.\n\nAS: Ever since reading classic poems by Yeats and T.S. Eliot in high school, I’ve been a fan of poetry. I think that, just like playing the violin well, it’s a skill that’s quite rare. Somehow in my adult life, however, I had stopped reading as much poetry—until I started seeing language-based NFTs created by members of a group called theVERSEverse. I immediately felt this was a revolutionary undertaking—bringing poetry to the blockchain, increasing its audience among a younger group of readers, and also, perhaps for the first time in history, creating a way for poets to make a living from their art. Most famous painters make a living from their work, but Wallace Stevens was an insurance salesman, and TS Eliot worked in a bank.\n\nAs a curator for one of the PlayboyxSeven shows, I had recommended an amazing poem that turned out to be by one of theVERSEverse members,Ana Caballero (the reviewing was blind), but I didn’t really know much about the origins or structure of the group. I was thrilled when Nathaniel reached out and suggested this collaboration, since I had never dreamed that I could be part of a group that wrote poetry.\n\nAM: FUTURE MYTHOLOGIES consists of a series of 12 poems written in collaboration with text-based AIs and incorporated into videos produced with the help of text-to-image AI. What can we learn from Greek mythology for the future?\n\nNS: These stories are so very rich and can be easily adapted to show us connections we hadn’t thought of. For example, in my piece OEDIPUS for hektor.net (originally put online in 1999, minted last year, and owned by Kevin Abosch), I turn Greek fatalism into the Ameritocracy, where you can’t escape fate any more than you can escape the class you are born into. A lot of the pieces in FUTURE MYTHOLOGIES reveal the patriarchal and rule-bound issues with these old stories. PENELOPE (on SuperRare), for example, stops waiting for Odysseus and takes off into the unknown. PANDORA (not yet released) is proud to have opened up that box of knowledge. ICARUS sends a big “FU to gravity” (and his father). They’re funny in their referentiality but still act as a kind of action and call to action.\n\nAS: One of the fun aspects of working with AI is not knowing what direction it will take you. Although all the visuals are guided by Nathaniel’s text—often using parts of the poems directly as prompt material—the visual outputs are never predetermined for me. I love the sense of working with a mysterious partner in AI and running with concepts that emerge from the text-to-image process. In Icarus, for example, my prompts started generating frames consisting only of feathers. This was 100% unexpected but immediately made sense, and I went with it because the explosive feathering evocatively suggested the rise and fall and stuttering described in the poem.\n\nI’m not sure my visuals carry a specific message for the future but are more about letting people see these classic stories in a new light and enjoy them from a modern visual perspective.\n\nStill from Icarus by Nathaniel Stern and Anne Spalter, 2023.\n\nAM:”I don’t fear the unknown. But I feel it”, does Odysseus say in the piece titled ODYS. Do these poems freeze a moment in time—our time—or how would you best describe them?\n\nNS: I love this question. To me, any great work of art is both frozen and moving (in many senses of that word). A photograph, for example, is a “still”, but what we see in that moment is not only what is in the frame. We all understand there are outside goings-on, a behind to any image, a before and an after, and more, and all of those potentials are caught in the very potent present of the image. An astute viewer also considers the context in which the piece was made: when, by whom, and in relation to what. Any given time is a smudge; any context is a tangling of possibilities. Odys and I feel all those potentials—their beauty and cynicism, their wonder and sadness. I agree with the proclamation, “I don’t fear the unknown. But I feel it”, Odys is not saying he is completely fearless. But what he feels—that intensity, that affect, that timeless yet constrained moment of potent potential—far outweighs (in fact, includes) his fear.\n\nAS: I agree that freezing a moment in time is a goal of much art. “For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!” right? These new tools we are using are very much of our moment in time, and using them to re-interpret these narratives will definitely situate them for future viewers.\n\nAM: Nathaniel, one of your professors at NYU recommended that you explore the relationship between speech and body. What did you find out?\n\nNS: Would it be cheating to point to 25 years of art practice and two peer-reviewed academic books in answer to this question? I can’t thank Dan O’Sullivan enough for his early provocations in my art-making and writing practices. Moving-thinking-feeling are all part of the same process; the world is always already made of conceptual-material formations. Matter thinks. Words play. Time suspends. Life and non-life are both heartbreakingly beautiful.\n\nAM: What are your thoughts about the relationship between speech and video when it comes to digital art?\n\nNS: It’s vital for me, and something I’ve been doing since dial-up! When I write poetry, I write it for performance and read it aloud as I write… I was a songwriter first, a poet second (like my dad!). When I was doing the slam poetry scene in NYC around 1999 and decided to go digital (this was before YouTube or MP4, so it was all Flash and Streaming QuickTime and the occasional RealPlayer, none of which exist any more), there was no question that I would perform them in video. Then I played between shots of me reading, custom animation, and harsh digital effects to “replace the body” with other intensities and effects on screen. I didn’t want the clean lines, so popular and easy to make in PhotoShop, etc., at the time; I wanted what I called the “dirty digital” to feel it. I had to play with a lot of compression and wait times, too. Most people could only view these at work, and it was funny to get emails about not warning that much of my poetry was NSFW (not a term I knew yet back then).\n\nAS: These pieces combine so many factors: written text, spoken words, still and moving visuals, and frequently audio atmospheres as well, so there’s a lot going on. I think it’s a delicate balancing act to create a final piece in which everything works together to create a whole greater than the sum of the parts.\n\nAM: It’s already difficult for an artist to decide when a project is finished. How did you approach this collaboration, and when did you know a piece was finished?\n\nNS: Anne, Sasha Stiles, and Ana Maria Caballero all pushed me in my performances, but I had so much fun writing and recording these poems that I wrapped them up pretty quickly. With the visuals and text, Anne and I go back and forth a fair amount until we are both happy with them, and we usually kick up the pace when we have a deadline.\n\nAS: I have definitely been the bottleneck in this project because Nathaniel finished the poems and voiceovers ages ago. Maybe I should have created some sort of template to produce them all with, but instead, each has been a challenging separate project, often taking several weeks to complete. The AI tools change constantly, and incorporating text and a specific visual illustration goal is new for me and not the way I usually work, so it has been a bit slow. And of course, I’ve been juggling other projects at the same time. I don’t think the problem is knowing when they are done, though. I don’t personally find this aesthetic decision much different when using digital technology than analog media.\n\nNS: Anne’s work is AMAZING and I don’t care how long it takes! I am absolutely thrilled to be working with her and to be able to call her a friend. Also: I can’t help it. I tend to keep my head down and in a project until it’s done because otherwise I’d never finish anything (re: five kids and a full time job… Did I mention I also direct an NEA-funded research lab around art and neurodiverse community building and am a co-founder of an NSF-funded climate action startup?)\n\nAS: Hahahaha. Thank you. And no, you did not mention that. I need whatever drugs you are on, lol. Aren’t you a runner as well? You know, in your free time…\n\nNS: Anne’s being humble. She is one of the most prolific and talented artists I know.\n\nAM: How and when did you start working with AI?\n\nNS: Indirectly, many years ago, through all the computer vision work I do. Directly, the night I met Anne, in early 2021.\n\nAS: In 2020, I saw fellow artist Carla Gannis post about something called playform.io, and I immediately applied for their beta program. Playform still exists and is great for GAN-based work, which tends to be overlooked with the text-to-image craze. It lets you use your own image sets, which appeals to me as an artist who has a lot of photographic and self-created source materials. I still enjoy the aesthetic of GAN imagery and videos and have created a number of works this way.\n\nWhen I first heard that there was a process that let you type in a few words and get an image based on their description, I was pretty sure it was made up. I remain constantly amazed and delighted by text-to-image AI and am often up at 2 AM trying “just one more thing.” I am now in several beta programs and often use multiple platforms at once to see which will give me the best results for a given prompt theme. In my Rabbit Takeover Drop of 557 Rabbits in a Post-Armageddon World, I also used ChatGPT and Sudowrite to create narratives for my images.\n\nAM: Have your thoughts and concerns about AI changed over the years, as well as your approach to creating art with AI?\n\nNS: They change all the time! My biggest concern at the moment is that so many people have such strong opinions without knowing much about the technologies and data behind most AI, not to mention the politics and revenue streams of each of the largest companies and models. My biggest, current project, – MOTHER COMPUTER: THINKING WITH NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCES, a series of drops and then a large-scale IRL exhibition with Sasha Stiles that will open in 2025 and travel thereafter, mostly tries to deepen and nuance conversations around AI (and its inner workings) and involve more non-computer / non-data folks into its fold.\n\nAS: I’ve always been a technological optimist. As part of stewarding Spalter Digital since the early 1990s, I’ve had to combat the knee-jerk reaction of many in the art world that the computer somehow usurps artistic agency from human beings. Although AI brings a dramatic new level of power to everyday computer users, I also feel that I’ve seen this movie before. Usually, when a writer makes a blanket claim about AI taking over visual production jobs and being a force of generally unstoppable evil, I can tell that they have never actually tried to make a specific image with any of the current tools. It’s not at all easy. I tend to think of AI as more of a really great sketchpad and idea generator than a stand-alone replacement for artistic creation. (I don’t know enough to comment on the larger issue of whether there will be a GAI and the repercussions of that for society, so this is just in terms of today’s issues in art creation.)\n\nAM: Anne, you are not only known as an artist but also as a collector of digital art. Michael Spalter and you started collecting digital art decades ago, when hardly anyone was interested in its history. You didn’t fear the unknown. What convinced you to trust a feeling and to continue this journey?\n\nAS: I was writing my textbook, THE COMPUTER IN THE VISUAL ARTS, and reached out to the pioneers who had somehow braved punched cards and hard-to-access equipment and made art with computers in the 1960s and 1970s. Michael Spalter, who majored in art history, said, “Wow, these artists are just like the Impressionists. The academy hates them; they can’t show their work, but they all know each other, trained with well known people, and have incredible bodies of work. We should see if we can support them and collect some pieces.” Because there was literally no market, we were able to afford some acquisitions. Being immersed in the history and getting to know the artists and their practices gave us an appreciation for their efforts that was not shared by most curators and critics. The collection continued to grow organically, but the NFT movement really brought digital art to the forefront for many people in a way that we never could have anticipated.\n\nAM: What are the criteria for historically relevant digital art for you? Have these changed over the years?\n\nAS: Michael Spalter and I focus on the 1950s–80s but do collect some more contemporary pieces that relate to works of that time period. In addition to standard metrics such as an artist’s complete body of work, show history, critical writings, and such, personal taste plays a large role. Each piece in the collection is something we chose because, if digital art never took off, we would still want to look at that work and would enjoy it.\n\nNS: Oh, let me jump in on this… I tend to be most inspired by two “historical” moments with the media formerly known as new: 1. The first time a new technology is used towards artistic ends, a platform-specific performativity around what that medium is and does (on blockchain, think Rhea Myers and the McCoys!); and 2. AFTER that, when a new technology hits the mainstream, just after the hype cycle crest, artists who have waited to understand the medium more begin to engage with its public implications. I think we’re still in that latter part with both AI and blockchain.\n\nThat said, I am a romantic at heart. I like to move and be moved. A fantastic work of art will accomplish movement no matter when it is made, and its medium will always be an integral part of its conceptual-material formation.\n\nCan I also just shout out Furtherfield here? Ruth and Marc, and their mantra, “Art and technology for eco-social change,” have always balanced the new and meaningful for international tech-nerd audiences and London locals in ways that make me swoon. I have worked with them and will continue to do so whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nAM: How does one develop criteria for art created with new technologies?\n\nNS: This is a harder question, in that there are so many ways a work of art can be contextually relevant. My first book looked more specifically at interactive art, and I argued that dance and movement aesthetics (of the viewer) and how they have us relate to the world outweighed whatever it is we “see” on screen. This is because we always wander around where the sensor is and how it makes us perform. But Blockchain art is both new in its concretization of transactions (something I plan to explore a lot more in the next year) and also in its use of ownership and affection for more “traditional” digital forms. All of this is to say our relationships to the work, both personal and communal, will always determine its value. But that might be monetary, embodied, political, interpersonal, or otherwise—probably many of these in combination.\n\nAS: In general, I use the same criteria for technological work as any other kind: do I feel something when I look at it or engage with it? I’m much more perceptually oriented than conceptually. It’s wonderful if an artwork has a strong idea behind it, but if it could be equally well or better expressed in writing, then it doesn’t succeed for me as a visual artwork.\n\nNS: I’m in the latter camp of the question I answered above, honestly. I like to wait, research, and play just when a new technology is being talked about in the mainstream (especially if it’s only naively and with fear), and then turn it around, nuance it, fuck with it, make it emotional, create deeper connections, show its relation to history and other art forms… To my painter colleagues, I am “cutting edge” with my work, but to many of my digital peers—and how I think of myself—I am more of a synthesizer and researcher than someone who is “first” most of the time. I love being an artist working with new technologies, but my experimentation can take some time, and I usually don’t mind that. I’ve been making interactive art for more than 20 years, and yet I still learn from everything I make; it often feels new again. My scanner art felt very new in its use of scanners in the 90s and now feels quaint but still relevant. My last big IRL show and solo NFT drop – THE WORLD AFTER US – was about what happens when we throw out our used tech, so it was often nostalgic in its materials but still felt fresh.\n\nAM: Is it helpful to be the first and to be early? Is this something you have in mind as artists and collectors?\n\nNS: It is definitely helpful! And especially now that there are digital collectors interested in what is thought to be groundbreaking work. That said, I don’t often have it in mind any more. I think I was one of the first to do digital video poetry with hektor.net (no longer working!), epic online narratives, large-scale interactive poetry in the US and Africa… and it didn’t matter much because, at the time, there weren’t many collectors of this kind of work, and provenance was very difficult (I wrote a piece about this here, and there’s an upcoming NFT Now story I was interviewed for around this topic). I mostly showed in galleries and museums, precisely so I could be part of larger art world discussions, and occasionally in private collections. I like to think that an ongoing inquiry and a significant body of work will interest collectors and collections now. But I’m only just starting to break through to NFT collectors, so I’ll have to let you know how that goes in the next year or three!\n\nBeing respected and talked about by other artists—for me, because of that history—seems to help. I’m most excited to bring some of my longer inquiries around gifting and time, interactivity and performance, on-chain in the next year, and I think a lot of the work I’m planning is both new in this space and decidedly blockchain-specific, while also being old hat for me. I’m hoping that will speak to a large audience. I’ve got some exciting plans!\n\nAll this being said, being collected is relatively new to me, other than the occasional museum or university, and some prints are for more casual collectors. I had given up making much money with my art decades ago and decided to spend more time as a researcher, teacher, and academic, trying to have an impact. And I like to think I have. So making a bit of money and, more importantly, being collected and thus archived are like major bonuses in my middle age.\n\nAS: I’m a bit of a techno-addict, so I tend to play with everything as soon as I can get my hands on it. Some tools end up being competitors in my practice, like digital video and video effects, and others, like 3D modeling, don’t mesh that well with my working process. I do think it can help to create work early with a new tool because people are interested in which artists might be using something new, and new tools can help extend one’s practice in unexpected ways. Being known for experimenting with NFTs was certainly a factor in leading Tina Rivers Ryan to curate me into her Feral File show, PEER TO PEER, which led to my work being acquired by the Buffalo AKG Museum of Art.\n\nAs a collector, there is no doubt that collecting in this field early was a huge advantage. We had galleries literally sell us things to free up storage and for less than the cost of the work’s frame. When you look at the price of NFTs now, especially generative art NFTs compared with the physical works of digital art pioneers, I think there are still many bargains out there.\n\nKaryk by Anne Spalter, a metaversal inflatable AI avatar, shown at Lume Studios, 2023.\n\nAM: Anne, you have seen many new technologies dismissed. Why do you think history still repeats itself? By now, one might think that it is clear that a technology is there to stay and impact culture and society, despite being harshly said to be of no relevance.\n\nAS: It certainly is a narrative that repeats itself! A common theme is fear of the machine taking away creative agency from humans. This was the case with reactions to photography, to the use of the computer to make generative drawings, and now to AI in image creation. Of course there are other factors as well, such as specific genres a technology might interrupt (portrait painting and the camera, for instance), as well as surrounding political issues (such as the use of computers by the military), but I think the primary one is this misunderstanding of artmaking and the role of the artist. Art is fundamentally something the artist does for themselves—you just see the byproducts of this process. It doesn’t really matter if an artist uses a paintbrush or a computer to pursue this inner journey.\n\nAnne Spalter is a leading digital artist, creating dystopian landscapes with AI and other technological tools. She established the first digital fine arts courses at Brown University and RISD during the 1990s, and wrote the book THE COMPUTER IN THE VISUAL ARTS. Together with Michael Spalter she oversees Spalter Digital, one of the largest private collections of early computer art.\n\nNathaniel Stern has been producing, writing about, and teaching digital art for more than 25 years. Stern has had international exhibitions and presentations, including Art Basel, and the Venice Biennale. He has been featured in WIRED, Scientific American, JUXTAPOZ, and Rhizome.\n\nCulture3\n\nNathaniel Stern on creating a cyber-natural future on the blockchain\n\nby Ola Kalejaye\n\nFor Nathaniel Stern, life extends far further than the human experience. Connecting the dots between human feeling, nature, and technology, he explores the endless bounds of sensibility through his art. He speaks to Ola Kalejaye about The World After Us, and using art to ensure that world is good.\n\nWhen Nathaniel Stern speaks about his work, his passion for the subject matter enlivens the conversation, steering it down tangential alleyways that enlighten his process with glorious context, while also bringing a cascade of new and interesting insights.\n\nSuch are the makings of the eclectic mind of a natural polymath and interdisciplinary artist. Nathaniel holds a joint appointment at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, teaching both Art & Design and Mechanical Engineering. It certainly scans for someone who embodies the mind of both artist and academic through the way they approach, well, everything.\n\nNathaniel expressed interest in a variety of creative media from a young age. The son of two English teachers, he first explored his creativity through music while attending an engineering high school. He went on to study fashion design at university, and it was there that Nathaniel faced the first major turning point of his artistic journey, and quite by chance.\n\nOne of Nathaniel’s undergraduate professors sent him a link to New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), which he interpreted as a suggestion that he apply. In reality, as Nathaniel learned a decade later, his professor had sent the link as a reference for what she wanted to hire Nathaniel to do with her own website, but the decision had already been made.\n\nFounded in 1979, the NYU ITP explores communications technologies, and how they can serve as vessels to spread art. The programme is also well known for its contributions to interactive art, which has been one of Nathaniel’s primary vehicles for expression.\n\nDuring his time at NYU, Nathaniel explored the notion of performativity, “how text and activity intertwine.” A major guiding inspiration came from his teacher, Professor Dan O’Sullivan, who noted Nathaniel’s particularly animated style of speaking, prompting him to explore the relationship between speech and the body. “That’s where my two loves kind of came together,” reflects Nathaniel. “It wound up completely changing my life. That’s where I became an artist.”\n\n“What might that cyber-natural future look like?”\n\n— Nathaniel Stern\n\nAs Nathaniel’s interests evolved, he honed in on his corporeal relationship to the environment, through the lens of affect. “Affect is the body’s response to the environment that doesn’t have a name yet,” he explains. “It’s an emotion without a qualification.”\n\nOne of his early explorations of this phenomenon was through a series of what he labels Compressionist images. Nathaniel would make custom imaging rigs by attaching battery packs to desktop scanners, rigging them to his body and moving through different landscapes.\n\nNathaniel’s experimental and ingenious project spanned over a decade, taking him and his imaging rigs scanning over hedges, through parks and streams, and wading through lakes and waterfalls.\n\nHe even spent three months learning to scuba dive with his equipment, to take his compressionist observations underwater. He and his team built five different sub-aqueous systems, and Nathaniel dived with three of them at three different sites.\n\nThanks to Nathaniel’s uniquely unusual method of capturing these “melty, slit-scan images,” the thoughts and questions they stimulated were beyond what Nathaniel could have ever planned. He was viewing the interrelationship between his body, technology, and the world around him in a wholly new way. He had found a way to visually represent affect.\n\nNathaniel began to wonder, what if the landscapes that he had been surveying had their own, unprocessed responses. Could there be some kind of nonhuman affect? And if there was, how might it express itself in an environment increasingly tampered with by human activity? This exploration manifested itself in what is perhaps Nathaniel’s signature work thus far, and the centre of his NFT collection launching on Quantum Art, The World After Us.\n\n“We need artists to make everyone have the will to make that difference.”\n\n— Nathaniel Stern\n\nThe title of the series is inspired by the book The World Without Us, which explores the progress of planet Earth if humanity were to go extinct. In The World After Us, he explores how biological life and the waste that humanity produces would intertwine in our absence.\n\n“If matter can move and think and feel,” Nathaniel asks, “what if it’s not just the plants that retake the planet? What if the digital materials themselves started to incubate and fester and spread?”\n\nThe World After Us is Nathaniel’s representation of what such a future would look like. For him, that future is neither blindly optimistic, nor some post-apocalyptic dystopia. “I wanted to imagine a space that is full of garbage, but life finds a way, because it always does,” he explains. “What might that cyber-natural future look like?”\n\nThe collection falls into three categories: old appliances reclaimed by plant life, fossilised phones and laptops, and devices repurposed into tools. Contemplating the future of our tech-driven society, Nathaniel’s images recontextualise our relationship to these quotidian items.\n\n“How can I change my relationship to this thing?,” he muses, asking both of himself and the viewer, “How do I understand it, no longer as this object of beauty and utility, but also as garbage.”\n\nArt is just one platform through which Nathaniel pursues these aims. A self-professed “Jack-of-All-Trades”, Nathaniel co-founded the climate action startup, Eco Labs, and sits on the Board of a battery company seeking to replace the lithium ion with the much more plentiful sodium ion in the battery-making process.\n\nHowever, for Nathaniel, art provides the most important piece of the puzzle when it comes to inducing systematic changes to our attitudes on waste. Nathaniel quotes his friend and collaborator, the soil scientist Johannes Lehmann: “I can tell you how to solve climate change, but we need artists to make everyone have the will to make that difference.”\n\n“What the blockchain has afforded me is that I get to live in both worlds at once.”\n\n— Nathaniel Stern\n\nNathaniel’s appreciation that much of that will could be inspired by the blockchain required a 180-degree change in perspective, from contempt to admiration. Indeed, he intended to make a “critical and negative work” about the blockchain with longtime collaborator Scott Kildall.\n\nHowever, when Nathaniel and Scott began their research, their opinions swiftly changed. “We came to it and we were like, oh shit, there’s something there,” he explains. “Yeah, there are crypto bros, but there are also really earnest people who want to leverage its power.”\n\nNathaniel recalls finding the work of artists and writers in the blockchain space, such as Simon de la Rouviere, and future collaborators Rhea Myers and the AI-collaborative poet Sasha Stiles. Their opinions on the blockchain firmly changed Nathaniel and Scott’s perspectives, who decided to instead create a work celebrating the blockchain, starting Nathaniel’s web3 journey in earnest.\n\n“We need artists to make everyone have the will to make that difference.”\n\n— Nathaniel Stern\n\nTo him, the NFT ecosystem provides a space for experimentation that had been eroding in the face of demands of galleries and museums, and more akin to the Net Art days of the 1990s. “I would just make something, throw it up, get feedback and see what happened,” he reminisces.\n\nBy contrast, whilst a gallery would support his work, all experimentation had to happen behind the scenes. In providing Nathaniel the means to sell and distribute his work directly, web3 lets him pursue his true interests.“What the blockchain has afforded me is that I get to live in both worlds at once.”\n\nTop of mind for Nathaniel is a longstanding desire to archive his work, which the blockchain enables for a digital work far better than any gallery. Though he does not fully buy into the concept of the blockchain lasting forever, he does find the concept of permanent immutability on the blockchain to be “a beautiful idea.”\n\n“The blockchain is already a promise we can’t possibly keep,” Nathaniel says, as he ponders what forever looks like, and beyond. “But I think that putting our trust in the trustless and timeless is itself beautiful. And romantic and cynical, and problematic and hopeful all at once.”\n\nby Ola Kalejaye – read full article in context on Culture3\n\ntheVERSEverse\n\nconVERSEverse with Nathaniel Stern\n\nBY ELISABETH SWEET\n\nNathaniel Stern is an awkward artist, writer, and teacher who likes awkward art, writing, and students. He is a Fulbright, NSF, and NEA grant recipient, a Professor of Art, Engineering, and Entrepreneurship at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and an Associate Researcher at the University of Johannesburg. His art ranges from ecological, participatory, and online interventions, interactive, immersive, and mixed reality environments, to prints, sculptures, videos, performances, and hybrid forms. His current research projects include eco sculptures, prints, and installations, machine learning and Blockchain performance, new forms of sodium-ion batteries, and neurodiverse community building for the work force (among other things).\n\nIn this conVERSEverse with Shannon Chen See, Nathaniel talks about his poetry journey, what makes the blockchain a unique medium, and his hopes for Web3.\n\nVV: Tell us a bit about your poetry journey before the blockchain.\n\nNS: Both of my parents are English teachers, so my love of language and word play goes way back. In college, I studied fashion design and music, and was part of a ska-reggae-pop band where I was the frontman and sang and wrote half the lyrics. We were featured in Playboy Magazine as a “Band on the Brink”. Boy, were they wrong. When the band split, I moved to New York for a graduate programme in digital art. I didn’t have time to do music anymore, but started doing the slam poetry circuit.\n\nI started thinking: what if we replaced the performance stage with the screen? And so I started streaming video poetry as early as 1999. I used Quicktime Streaming and Flash — mediums which no longer exist — to do character-based narratives and twists on Greek origin stories. For example, Hektor, the Fallen Hero, was very articulate but he never wanted to speak about the traumatic past, and so he was always dodging and weaving. Odysseus, my traveler, wanted to tell you about his journey, but he was a stutterer.\n\nAfter a while, I shed those characters and experimented with several other mediums like interactive installations using body tracking and slit scan photography while scuba diving. I’ve also spent considerable time writing more academic works: the first book about interactive installation, the second about non-human affect and bodies.\n\nAlongside my academic writing, for a solid 25 years or so, I engaged in performative networked art; these were often collaborations with Scott Kildall. We did one called “Wikipedia Art”, an intervention on Wikipedia. Like Wikipedia pages, it was an artwork that anyone could edit, as long as it followed Wikipedia’s rules, so you had to publish elsewhere and then cite back on Wikipedia. On the one hand, it was this beautiful art object that anyone could edit, but on the other hand it was this intervention into the power structures of knowledge to show that Wikipedia is just like every other knowledge base: mostly run by upper middle class white men. It exploded. Jimmy Wales – the Co-founder of Wikipedia – sued us for trademark infringement, and their lawyer, Mike Godwin – of Godwin law fame – called us trolls. It was incredible.\n\nVV: How did the blockchain impact your poetry journey?\n\nNS: Scott and I tend to look at relatively new technologies and intervene in them just as they hit the mainstream, ie. which platform is everyone currently talking about, but not really understanding. I saw the Beeple sale and I saw the Eminem “Without Me” video on Saturday Night Live, and I said, “Shit, we’re here”. I called Scott immediately and I was like, “We need to fuck with the blockchain”. Initially, we naively thought of doing a really negative intervention because we had the same mainstream interpretation of the blockchain as everyone else – cartoon monkeys and money – but since we take our artist practice seriously we started by doing research.\n\nRhea Myers reviewed my first book back in 2012, so I reached out to her saying, “Hey, R, tell me about the blockchain,” and we spoke for about an hour and a half. That conversation really accelerated my journey down the rabbit hole.\n\nAs we dug deeper, what Scott and I found in the blockchain space was some really earnest, interesting communities doing experimental work, wanting to leverage this very libertarian capitalist system to do very socialist, anarchist things.\n\nMy first project in the NFT space was with Scott Kildall, and heavily informed by Furtherfield, an organization pushing art and tech for eco-social change. I’ve been lucky to be a resident at Furtherfield and to have done three shows at their gallery. Scott and I worked on a project called “NFT Culture Proof”, a community-based participatory performance where everyone writes a story together, but the text itself is stored on-chain. Everybody loved it; nobody used it. Everyone talked about how cool it was, and in the end it just didn’t sell. The cheerleader in me wants to say, “Oh, it’s ahead of his time”, but I also might just not completely understand how the blockchain functions.\n\nPerhaps the best outcome of this project was stumbling on theVERSEverse and meeting Sasha, Ana, and Kalen. We were looking for crypto writers to collaborate with us and write prompts for the daily stories, and reached out to them to participate, so we all ended up working together on this.\n\nVV: How did you get involved with theVERSEverse?\n\nNS: I had started playing with AI thanks to Anne Spalter. She had a show here in Milwaukee where she spoke about AI art, and that same night I went home and signed up for Google Collab and started coding with AI.\n\nAround this time, theVERSEverse founders realized I was streaming video poetry back in the 90s, and we started having conversations about me working with theVERSEverse. To be honest, I was apprehensive to get back to writing poetry, but then Sasha said, “Why don’t you try gen text?”\n\nAnd that I felt more open to, because it felt like there was a co-pilot here, and I could play. That’s what artists do, right? The designer empathizes and the artist dumps the garbage bag on the table and sees what they can make. To me, AI is the garbage bag; it’s the non-human material.\n\nAI is actually a nice progression to go from human bodies to non-human bodies to non-human thought. Once I started playing, I fell in love. Especially because as I started brainstorming, I realized that GPT3 could help me go back to my roots. It will know Hektor, and all my Greek characters from grad school because it’s been trained on 45 terabytes of text. So I set out to update these characters and try to get the AI to stutter, try to get the AI to perform these characters differently.\n\nIt all came full circle when Ana and I were brainstorming a collaborator for this, and I was like, “Oh, let’s fucking ask Anne Spalter. That would be so cool!”. Ana said, “Okay, here’s what we’ll do: let’s do spaceship twists on the concept because Anne loves space.” Anne said yes immediately.\n\nIt feels so good to come full circle like this now. Admittedly, I’ve found much more of a home in visual art and in academic writing, but I’m really enjoying finding these new ways to collaborate around poetry again. I imagine I’ll start writing my own without the help of AI again too, but right now I’m really enjoying these AI poems with Anne Spalter and the work I’m doing with Sasha in generative AI, poetry, and art.\n\nVV: What makes the blockchain different from other mediums you’ve worked with?\n\nNS: First and foremost, for me the performative nature of the blockchain inherently makes it a time-based medium. Especially with this AI work that we’re doing, we have to partner it with blockchain because AI moves so rapidly that everything we make needs to be time stamped to show that history and progression.\n\nThe first-ever public-facing thing I did with blockchain was to write an article on my website about conservation and what the blockchain affords because of it. The idea that, now that when you buy a work, there’s the potential for custodianship and archiving that didn’t exist before. I used to sell my interactive installations for peanuts just to get into a museum collection with the hope that someone would care enough to maintain it on a regular basis. It’s unlikely that they are or they have been. But when it comes to the blockchain — and this is where the forces of capitalism are at play — it’s actually a good thing that people are spending a lot of money on it, because that means they’re going to look after it.\n\nRhea Meyers and Simon de la Rouviere’s work really spoke to me early on when it came to the blockchain. The kind of conceptual, performative, platform-based work that played with both the meaning and the work and its implications. That being said, that’s not to devalue the work of artists who are just putting JPEGs on-chain, because I think that too is a performance like going to do a poetry reading.\n\nI think we’re just beginning to understand the nuance to the different ways we can use blockchain as a medium. I’ve done things where I just had to update a flash poem, convert it to MP4, put them on-chain where the metadata of the work says “This is when this was actually made and this is how it was created”.\n\nAnd then I’ve got stuff where I’m really glad I minted it as soon as I did. I was looking at AI bias and so I made this whole body of work called “Are computers racist?” and I insisted on doing it in one day because I didn’t want to craft too hard. I didn’t want it to make computers look racist; I wanted to show where that inherent bias lay on that day.\n\nVV: What is your hope for Web3?\n\nNS: Web3 is coming, and now is the time we can decide as much as possible what this future internet will be and look like. Web1 was the information age, Web2 was the buying and social media age, and Web3 is trans-dash-actional. The question is: do our trans-dash-actions have to only be monetary? Although capitalism does back it and it’s built on libertarian foundations, fighting too much with that is like fighting gravity, so how do we leverage it?\n\nAt Ecolabs — a startup I’ve co-founded with Sev Nightingale and Samantha Tan — we’re trying to leverage Web3 to reverse climate change. What does that look like? Well, one of the ways is to work with small farmers who it’s not worth it for large companies that do carbon sequestration to work with. Firstly, we pay them through Web3. There are no intermediaries; we can easily send them money. Secondly, whereas other companies have an outcomes-based approach, we are trying to transform farming practices forever. Instead of paying the same farmer each year to not cut a tree down, we front the cost and convert a farmer permanently to no-till and rotational crops.\n\nWithout this approach, they would’ve lost money for the first two years converting to a new practice, but in the long term they make more money because it’s actually better for their crops, and that sequestration can continue in permanence.\n\nWe’re also leveraging Web3 for the votes that govern our decisions as an organization: how do we decide who we want to work with? That’s where DAOs can help us make more decentralized, democratic decisions. It’s not perfect, but it’s still far more democratic and community-oriented than a company is. I’d like to see more action-oriented NFTs in the future that help communities self govern and self sustain.\n\n—-\n\nCheck out Nathaniel’s work on theVERSEverse here.

How might we imaginatively repurpose our e-waste? Where might electronics lead our environmental and economic politics? Can we plan and act for a sustainable future? These questions are the core of Nathaniel Stern’s exhibition “The World After Us: Imaging Techno-Aesthetic Futures,” currently on view at MOWA|DTN.\n\nStern’s proposal is grand. He has cooked, smashed, melted, stacked and carved out phones, desktops and other e-waste and transformed them into an imaginary future in geologic time.\n\nStern is following the thread of Alan Weisman’s 2007 book, “The World Without Us.” In it, Weisman imagines how the natural world would reclaim our mechanized detritus in the absence of humans. Stern has created a visual document of this process. “The Wall After Us” is a network of screens, desktop computers, phones and cassette tape interwoven with ferns, potting soil and other greenery. The effect is of the damp, drippy understory of a forest that emerged from someone’s former office space.\n\nOther sculptures in the exhibition show expand on themes of degradation and rebirth. A pile of remote controls, receivers, fans and a pirated CD of David Bowie’s “Blackstar” are partly submerged in a terrarium filled with water. A dismal tube eternally dribbles water over this mass. As I leaned in I could smell the plastic and metal interacting with the water. It was vaguely noxious, the splashing water wafting decomposition into the air.\n\nElsewhere cellphones have been pressed and heated into a vestige of ash and carbon. These sculptures were powerful. Seeing what happens to objects we are so intimately connected to reduced to literal rubble had the effect of looking at a corpse.\n\nIn addition to describing the result of time on our technological devices, Stern also remarks on possibilities for repurposing them. Carapaces from Apple computers have been formed into a hammer, a wrench. The aspirational concept of beating swords into ploughshares is poetic, though undercut by Stern’s cheeky title: “Applecations.”\n\nInterestingly, the strongest work here emerges in photography and film. Stern has a designer’s eye behind the camera, and at times his photos of plant life growing from our old gadgets has a greater impact than the objects themselves. The color and light in the photos give them an atmospheric romanticism and a greater visual impact. The artist also includes a documentary where he eloquently presents his proposal. There is an irony in this, however, as the film is of course projected from a sleek, sexy flat screen.\n\nAt times the exhibition felt overly familiar, reminiscent of other art and literature describing the world emerging from the tide of mechanical reproduction, though ultimately it remains an important message. Our crisis of electronic consumption is happening now. Stern tells us there are ten billion phones produced per year, more than there are people to use them. Art can, and should, be a vehicle to expose this crisis to ourselves.

What happens to all the devices and digital media we leave behind? Are there ways we can plan for and enable a different future?\n\nArtist Nathaniel Stern ’99 is posing these questions in dramatic ways with “The World After Us: Imaging techno-aesthetic futures,” an exhibition through March 29 at the Museum of Wisconsin Art in Milwaukee.\n\nIt includes installations, sculptures, prints and photographs featuring plant life growing from electronic waste, and various media and devices – such as books and floppy disks, cellphones, laptops, keyboards, punch cards, audiotape, and Ethernet and USB cables – altered to resemble fossils.\n\n“You’re taught early on that data is bottomless, just ones and zeros,” Stern said. “And it’s gone if that information is lost, but the logical fallacy is that it is divorced from some material form. That is problematic in many ways. We’re constantly talking about sustainability and green environments, and we don’t take into account the matter around us.”\n\nStern combined scientific experimentation with artistic exploration to create the traveling exhibition.\n\n“I’ve worked with a botanist and horticulturists to figure out how to grow the plants inside the electronics,” he said. “My first thought was, ‘Were the electronics going to impact the plants?’ In time I found out the inverse is true; the plants would filter out the toxins.”\n\nHe also collaborated with Johannes Lehmann, professor of soil and crop sciences in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences’ School of Integrative Plant Science. They worked together on campus last summer to apply experimental pyrolysis techniques to burn and artificially age the items.\n\n“He started sending me things early in 2019, anything that he could find, intrigued to see what it would look like if we artificially aged it,” Lehmann said. “Apart from the fact we do it in 20 minutes rather than 5 million years, we wanted to see what a book, or a cellphone, would look like in millions of years.”\n\nHe wouldn’t normally think of the longevity of materials put in soil “past more than a few thousand years,” Lehmann said. “I don’t think in iPhones; I think in plants and leaves. This idea is so intriguing. Our nose gets poked into questions that we didn’t ask before.”\n\nStern reached out to scientists working with fossil fuels and aging, and most didn’t write back, he said. His classmate and friend Julie Goddard ’99, Ph.D. ’08, associate professor of food science, told Stern about Lehmann’s work with biochar, superheated organic material used to enrich soil.\n\n“Literally within hours of phoning Johannes, he said, ‘Let’s meet today,’” Stern said. “I was amazed how similar his lab tests and my studio tests are, how we label things … We work in much the same way.”\n\nThe artist worked with a forge and foundry to work out how to convert aluminum iMacs into tools; and [with Lehmann and Jessica Meuninck-Ganger of the University of Wisconsin] to turn phones into inks and make prints.\n\nStern has an experimental art background and began work on the project in 2016. Applying for a fellowship studying theory in the eschaton – the end of days – “gave me the idea for the fossils, and the degradation over geologic time of technological material,” Stern said. “I didn’t get the fellowship; however, the director of the center [political theorist Kennan Ferguson] reached out and said it was a great idea. He wound up becoming one of the catalog essayists on the show.”\n\nStern said he’s been playing around with technology for more than 20 years. “At Cornell, we were the only fashion program around that was doing things like 3D scanning and pattern grading,” he said. “It’s where I learned that you could be creative with technology. My interactive art comes from that basis in fashion.”\n\nAfter graduating from the College of Human Ecology, he returned to Cornell in 2002 as an artist-in-residence at Risley Residential College, and earned graduate degrees in art from New York University and electrical engineering from Trinity College in Dublin. Stern now holds a joint appointment as professor of art and design and of mechanical engineering at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.\n\nStern wants to explore the potential for change in recycling practices and the regulation of waste, beginning with how we perceive the products we throw away by the millions.\n\n“Many people understand the problem of waste and of toxicity,” he said. “There’s this intimate relationship we have with our technology; can we keep that relationship just one year longer? … Can we make biodegradable or compostable phones?”\n\n“Artists are starting to imagine these things,” Lehmann said. “They ask the uncomfortable questions about our future and our society.”\n\nSee original article on the Cornell Web site.\n\nShepherd Express\n\nNathaniel Stern’s Mad Science at MOWA Downtown\n\nby Shane McAdams\n\nIf I were to mention that I viewed an art exhibition of computer-based artwork that flirted with the spectacular, I think the assumption would be that the spectacle involved moving images, light and other sensational magic tricks associated with the productive potential of new media. In the case of Nathaniel Stern’s exhibition at the Museum of Wisconsin Art Downtown (MOWA | DTN), “The World After Us” (a name modified from Alan Weisman’s fascinating account of human ephemerality), the impact of his computer-generated art is based on computers and other technology itself—like the actual machines and hardware witnessed in various stages of degradation and reclamation.\n\nIt was a gut check to walk into the gallery on my cell phone, vaguely considering the refrain that I, like many of us, are “slaves” to our devices, and then witnessing the chaotic tangle of computers, motherboards and cellphones all bent to the Frankensteinian will of Stern, professor, artist and semi-mad scientist. As I stood in front of a blender filled with ravaged old Androids and RAZRs, a toaster holding a charred smartphone and what looked like a rotating cellphone torture rack, I might have put my thumb over the camera of my iPhone to prevent it from seeing the slaughter. But my phone should rest assured that these strange medieval-looking experiments with technology are all made with salvaged hardware procured through a program at UW-Milwaukee; no phones were hurt in the making of this exhibition.\n\nWhat might look like a graveyard or torture dungeon for spent hardware is actually a more redemptive setting. Stern’s no sado-technologist; rather, he’s an esthetic researcher hoping to reorient our relationship to computer waste by forcing us to look at it in new ways. Standing before a wall of degraded laptops and cables in the main gallery, appropriately titled “The Wall After Us,” I was reminded of Edward Burtynsky’s photographs of accumulated technological waste. It occurred to me that he and Stern are both grappling with an inversion of that quote by Joseph Stalin that one death is a tragedy and a million is a statistic. One personal device connects you with the world and reflects your individuality, while thousands of them in a pile is a tragic reminder of human limitations.\n\nConfronting these limitations seems so important to Stern precisely because the marketing teams in Silicon Valley exert so much force in the opposite direction. From the consumer side, computers are presented as pure, precious, transportive, liberating and enlightened. Apple Stores are designed to be visions of positivity. Stern notes in the catalog’s introduction that one of his profound revelations in researching this project was learning that waste from mining the raw materials vastly surpasses that of the products themselves, which means that simply engaging in responsible disposal is not enough by itself to arrive at sustainable levels of technological consumption.\n\nFor this reason, Stern, who began thinking about the exhibition in terms of our “intimate” relationships with technology, soon started to look at e-waste from different perspectives. He considered the legal and regulatory issues around disposal and ultimately began to wonder about the creative and inspirational possibilities that might result from his visual research. The “Phossils” that arise from these more experimental approaches provide the show some needed optimism and an entry point for those who would naturally begin thinking about solutions.\n\nStern collaborated with Cornell professor Johannes Lehmann, an expert in the burning material in zero oxygen known as pyrolysis.
