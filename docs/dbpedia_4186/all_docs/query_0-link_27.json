        "text": "I asked over 150 sportswriters which sports books they really love – not what books they think are the ‘best’ but rather the one’s the love – either their all-time favourites or hidden gems that they love.\n\nThis list is the compilation of their answers listed by writer. The ordering of the writers is almost entirely random. To read my analysis of which books were the most loved and more background on the list check out my commentary on the list in the All Sports Books Newsletter at https://allsportsbookreviews.substack.com/p/the-sports-books-that-sportswriters\n\nIf you just want to see the list of books separated by sport you can find it here https://allsportsbooks.reviews/2022/12/28/the-sports-books-that-sportswriters-love-the-list/\n\nThis is going to be a living document, updated every time I get a new answer from a different writer. If you find this list useful, please share with friends or on social media. Happy Reading!.\n\nAny comments below are from the author who chose the book/s. And some caveats – some writers focused on the hidden gem part of the question, others picked their all time favourites. Some chose one book, others picked 4 or 5 or 10. Almost every single person who responded said three things 1) that it was an impossible question, 2) that their favourites often change and 3) if I asked again a week later I might get an entirely different answer.\n\nSeth Wickersham (author of It’s Better To Be Feared: The New England Patriots Dynasty and the Pursuit of Greatness)\n\nThe sports books that most impacted me when I was first learning the craft — not saying best ever — are\n\n🥊 The Fight by Norman Mailer\n\n🏈 Joe Namath and the Other Guys by Rick Telander\n\n📰 The Franchise: A History of Sports Illustrated Magazine by Michael MacCambridge.\n\n🏈 You Gotta Play Hurt by Dan Jenkins\n\n🏀Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made by David Halberstam\n\nJorge Iber (author of numerous books on Latinos in American Football)\n\n⚾ Sandy Koufax: A Lefty’s Legacy by Jane Leavy\n\n⚾ Stealing Home: Los Angeles, the Dodgers, and the Lives Caught in Between by Eric Nusbaum\n\n🏈 King Football: Sport and Spectacle in the Golden Age of Radio and Newsreels, Movies and Magazines, the Weekly and Daily Press by Michael Oriard\n\n🏈 Playing Through the Whistle: Steel, Football, and an American Town by S.L. Price\n\nThe Rise of American High School Sports and the Search for Control: 1880-1930 by Robert Pruter\n\n🏈 For Pride, Profit, and Patriarchy : Football and the Incorporation of American Cultural Values by Gearld R. Gems\n\nSean Nam (author of Murder on Federal Street: Tyrone Everett, the Black Mafia, Fixed Fights and the Last Golden Age of Philadelphia Boxing)\n\n🥊 Sporting Blood: Tales from the Dark Side of Boxing by Carlos Acevedo\n\n🥊 The Arc of Boxing: The Rise and Decline of the Sweet Science by Mike Silver\n\n🥊 McIlvanney On Boxing by Hugh McIlvanney\n\n🥊 King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero by David Remnick\n\n🥊 On Boxing by Joyce Carol Oates\n\n🥊 Writers’ Fighters and Other Sweet Scientists by John Schulian\n\n🥊 Boxe by Jacques Henric\n\nJack McCallum (legendary author of amazing basketball books including Dream Team and 07 Seconds or Less)\n\n⚾ Ball Four by Jim Bouton with Leonard Shecter (groundbreaking)\n\n🏀 The Breaks of the Game by David Halberstam (of course)\n\n🏀 Heaven Is A Playground by Rick Telander\n\nSomething in the Air: American Passion and Defiance in the 1968 Mexico City Olympics by Richard Hoffer\n\n🏀 Big Game, Small World: A Basketball Adventure by Alexander Wolf\n\n⚽ Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby\n\n🏀 The City Game: Basketball from the Garden to the Playgrounds by Pete Axthelm.\n\n🎾 Levels of the Game by John McPhee – I liked it as much as much as the Bradley book\n\nThe Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance by David Epstein;\n\n🏀The Last Pass: Cousy, Russell, the Celtics, and What Matters in the End by Gary Pomerantz\n\n⚾ A False Spring by Pat Jordan\n\n🎾 Big Bill Tilden: The Triumphs and the Tragedy by Frank Deford\n\n⚾The Boys of Summer by Roger Kahn\n\n⚾Eight Men Out: The Black Sox and the 1919 World Series by Eliot Asinof\n\n…and the early Plimpton books.\n\nJames Stafford (author of How Wales Beat the Mighty All Blacks)\n\n🥊 The Sweet Science by A.J. Liebling\n\nPhil Quinlan (author of upcoming A Bang on the Ear)\n\n🚴 Rough Ride: Behind the Wheel With a Pro Cyclist by Paul Kimmage\n\nThe Choice by Philly McMahon (with Niall Kelly)\n\n⚽ Recovering by Richie Sadlier\n\n🏉 Engage: The Fall and Rise of Matt Hampson by Paul Kimmage\n\nHayden Meikle (sports editor of the Otago Daily Times)\n\n🏈 Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream by Buzz Bissinger – forever No 1 for me. I went to Odessa, Texas 18 years ago because of the book.\n\n🏉 Old Heroes: The 1956 Springbok Tour and the Lives Beyond by Warwick Roger\n\nJason Goldsmith (author of great books on soccer in Australia including Be My Guest)\n\n⚽ Thirty-One Nil: On the Road with Football’s Outsiders: A World Cup Odyssey by James Montague\n\n⚽ Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby\n\n⚽ Full Time: The Secret Life Of Tony Cascarino by Paul Kimmage\n\n⚽ The Away Game: The Inside Story of Australian Football’s Golden Generation by Matthew Hall\n\n⚽ The Aboriginal Soccer Tribe by Professor John Maynard\n\n⚽ Sheilas, Wogs and Poofters: An Incomplete Biography of Johnny Warren and Soccer in Australia by Johnny Warren (amazingly titled)\n\nDonald McRae (author of multiple amazing books including Dark Trade: Lost in Boxing)\n\n🎾 A Handful of Summers by Gordon Forbes was the first to really capture my imagination. It might seem very obscure now but, as a teenager growing up in South Africa, I loved it. Forbes was a South African tennis player and he and his doubles partner Abe Segal played the global circuit just as the game was stumbling towards professionalism in the 1960s. I haven’t read it for years but it was very funny first time around and it offered a behind-the-scenes account of life on the tennis treadmill. It took us into the locker room and right out on court, with a colourful array of characters, and it made me think that you could write about sport in a very different way to everything I had read until then on the sports pages.\n\n🥊 King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero by David Remnick. It focuses on a very brief period in heavyweight history and captures the years in which Cassius Clay became Muhammad Ali. Of course it is about the transformation of Ali, race, politics and life in America in the 1960s; but Sonny Liston and Floyd Patterson, who were such contrasting men, are also riveting. It is a book which reminded me that, through boxing, you can write about so much more than the fights that take place in the ring.\n\nKent Babb (Author of Not A Game and the peerless Across The River)\n\n🏈 The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game by Michael Lewis. I absolutely devoured it. It also changed my life. For me, this book opened my eyes on a world of genre-blending sports literature I didn’t know existed. Michael Lewis was telling one person’s story, yes, but also the story of a changing game—all leading to this magical intersection. I didn’t know this was even a thing. Now I look for these themes all the time in my writing for the Washington Post, and finding a story with layers like the ones Lewis is so great at finding should be any writer’s goal. If not for that book, I’m not sure what I would be writing about now, if I would be writing at all.\n\nJeff Pearlman (author of 10 amazing sports books)\n\nAmongst many others:\n\n⚾ Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig by Jonathan Eig\n\n⚾ The Bronx Zoo: The Astonishing Inside Story of the 1978 World Champion New York Yankees by Peter Golenbock and Sandy Lyle\n\n🏈 Namath: A Biography by Mark Kriegel\n\n🏀 Loose Balls: The Short Wild Life of the American Basketball Association by Terry Pluto\n\nMirin Fader (author of Giannis: The Improbable Rise of an NBA Champion)\n\n🏀 07 Seconds or Less: My Season on the Bench with the Runnin’ and Gunnin’ Phoenix Suns by Jack McCallum. This is the book that made me fall in love with sports writing. I couldn’t believe that an NBA coach let a journalist into practice. Every. Single. Day. Jack is one of the greatest sports writers of all time, and he really made me feel like I was there with this team.\n\n🏀 Go Up For Glory by Bill Russell: Wow was this an astounding read. There’s such a vulnerability, such a clear focus and passion in every sentence. I recommend everyone go back and read this.\n\n⚾ Sandy Koufax: A Lefty’s Legacy by Jane Leavy. I was really moved when I read this. As a woman sports writer, I’ve looked up to Jane for a very long time. This book is incredible and I learned so much about a legend who ruled before my time.\n\n🏀 Blood in the Garden: The Flagrant History of the 1990s New York Knicks by Chris Herring. The level of detail in this book is extraordinary. Chris made me care about a team and a franchise that I honestly hadn’t. It reinforced to me the idea that it’s the story, the players, the personalities, that make a book great. The human story. Not necessarily the wins or championships.\n\n🏀 Three Ring Circus Kobe, Shaq, Phil, and the Crazy Years of the Lakers Dynasty by Jeff Pearlman.This was my era Lakers and Jeff brought it to life. His biggest skill is unpacking personalities with uncanny detail to go along with his confident voice and command of narrative. I’ve enjoyed all of his books but this is the one that really stuck with me. I read this book in two sittings–that’s how amazing it was.\n\nIan O’Connor (author of a number of excellent books including Coach K)\n\n🏈 When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi by David Maraniss – my all-time favorite, in part because I attended the NJ high school where Vince Lombardi coached football & basketball.\n\n🏀 The City Game: Basketball from the Garden to the Playgrounds by Pete Axthelm.\n\nDan Good (author of the exceptionally good Playing Through the Pain: Ken Caminiti and the Steroids Confession That Changed Baseball Forever)\n\n⚾The Natural by Bernard Malamud\n\n🎾 Open by Andre Agassi\n\n⚾ Clemente: The Passion and Grace of Baseball’s Last Hero by David Maraniss\n\n💉 Game of Shadows: Barry Bonds, BALCO, and the Steroids Scandal that Rocked Professional Sports by Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada\n\n🏒 Boy on Ice: The Life and Death of Derek Boogaard by John Branch\n\nNige Tassell (author of a number of excellent sports books including The Bottom Corner: A Season With The Dreamers Of Non-League Football)\n\n⚽ My Father And Other Working-Class Football Heroes by Gary Imlach\n\n🥊 King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero by David Remnick\n\n🎽💉The Dirtiest Race in History: Ben Johnson, Carl Lewis and the 1988 Olympic 100m Final by Richard Moore\n\n🚴 King of the Mountains: How Colombia’s Cycling Heroes Changed Their Nation’s History by Matt Rendell\n\n⚽ Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football by David Winner\n\n🎱 Pocket Money: Bad Boys, Business Heads and Boom-time Snooker by Gordon Burn\n\nDave Hannigan (author of number of excellent books including Muhammad Ali: Fifteen Rounds in the Wilderness)\n\nThere are a couple I read at different stages of my life that influenced me and that I still regard as stone cold classics.\n\n⚾ A False Spring by Pat Jordan – one of the most under-rated sports books ever\n\n⚽ A Strange Kind of Glory: Sir Matt Busby and Manchester United by Eamon Dunphy – read it when an undergraduate in UCC and the scope of it and the writing was eye-opening to me, made me want to become a sportswriter .\n\n⚽ All Played Out: The Full Story of Italia ’90 by Pete Davies – might be the best soccer book ever written and I don’t understand how it doesn’t get more love.\n\n🥊 Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times by Thomas Hauser – again, read it in college and made me an Ali obsessive thereafter.\n\n🚴 Rough Ride: Behind the Wheel With a Pro Cyclist by Paul Kimmage – so raw and so brave in the way he wrote about himself and his sport.\n\nIf I write this response in the morning, there might be five different choices!\n\nMike Stanton (Author of Unbeaten. Rocky Marciano’s Fight for Perfection in a Crooked World)\n\n🏇Seabiscuit: An American Legend by Laura Hillenbrand – The writing, the storytelling, the contextualization of the times – all of these inspired me when I wrote Unbeaten.\n\n⚾The Boys of Summer by Roger Kahn – I loved not only because it’s about baseball but also the coming of age of a young sportswriter at a magical time.\n\n🏈 When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi by David Maraniss – a wonderful bio of Vince Lombardi. I’m just digging into Maraniss’s new bio of Jim Thorpe, Path Lit by Lightning. And by the way, Sally Jenkins wrote a great book about Thorpe’s Carlisle team’s epic game against an Army team at West Point featuring a young Dwight Eisenhower, The Real All Americans.\n\n🥊The Professional by W.C. Heinz\n\nChad Finn (Boston Globe columnist and editor of upcoming Story of the Red Sox)\n\nTwo of the more underrated ones:\n\n⚾ Stolen Season: A Journey Through America and Baseball’s Minor Leagues by David Lamb – accomplished LA Times foreign correspondent finds solace in minor league baseball\n\n⚾ Prophet of the Sandlots: Journeys with a Major League Scout by Mark Winegardner – about Phillies scout Tony Lucadello\n\nRob Neyer (author of Power Ball: Anatomy of a Modern Baseball Game)\n\n⚾ Ball Four by Jim Bouton with Leonard Shecter\n\n⚾ Historical Baseball Abstract by Bill James\n\n🏀 Loose Balls: The Short Wild Life of the American Basketball Association by Terry Pluto\n\n⚾ Bums: An Oral History of the Brooklyn Dodgers by Peter Golenbock\n\n🏈 When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi by David Maraniss\n\n⚾ The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth by Leigh Montville\n\n⚾ Pete Rose: An American Dilemma by Kostya Kennedy\n\n⚾ The Pitch That Killed: Carl Mays, Ray Chapman and the Pennant Race of 1920 by Mike Sowell\n\nI could name dozens of others that have impressed and inspired me – plus a bunch of baseball fiction (Roth, Coover, Kinsella, others)\n\nLuciano Wernicke (author of a number of books including the excellent Dark Goals)\n\n⚽ Football in Sun and Shadow by Eduardo Galeano\n\n⚽ The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football by David Goldblatt\n\n⚽ Futbolítica, by Ramón Usall (sadly not available in English)\n\n⚽ Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics by Jonathan Wilson\n\nNathan Fogg (author of the excellent How Not to Run a Football Club: Protests, Boycotts, Court Cases – The Inside Story of Blackpool FC)\n\n🏀07 Seconds or Less: My Season on the Bench with the Runnin’ and Gunnin’ Phoenix Suns by Jack McCallum – it’s about the 2007 Phoenix Suns under Mike D’Antoni. He joined the team over a season sat on the coaches bench and wrote about a team revolutionising basketball but which always seemed to fall short at the last hurdle. A really great example of an embedded journalist providing good sports reporting before Amazon and Netflix came along with their team documentaries.\n\n🥊 The Big If: The Life and Death of Johnny Own by Rick Broadbent – it’s about the boxer Johnny Owen who died after a fight with Lupe Pintor, traversing both their lives before they met that fateful night. Was a high bar to capture the story as well as it demanded and he nailed it.\n\nA shout out one of my dad’s favourite books which I’ve been promised in the will which is an out of print book by Oliver Jarrett called The Gifted One about a British/Jamaican boxer called Kirkland Laing who is a typical boom/bust story of having lots of talents but also lots of lows, and ended up homeless and addicted to drugs, but in his heyday beat Roberto Duran in one of the sports greatest and lesser known upsets.\n\nAndrew Maraniss (author of numerous books including Inaugural Ballers: The True Story of the First US Women’s Olympic Team\n\n🏀 The Breaks of the Game by David Halberstam\n\n🏀 A Sense of Where You Are: Bill Bradley at Princeton by John McPhee\n\nTyler Dunne (author of the excellent The Blood and Guts: How Tight Ends Save Football)\n\n🏈 America’s Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation by Michael MacCambridge\n\n🏈 Play Their Hearts Out: A Coach, His Star Recruit, and the Youth Basketball Machine by George Dohrmann\n\n🏈 It’s Better To Be Feared: The New England Patriots Dynasty and the Pursuit of Greatness by Seth Wickersham\n\n🏈 Sweetness: The Enigmatic Life of Walter Payton by Jeff Pearlman\n\n🏀 Not a Game: The Incredible Rise and Unthinkable Fall of Allen Iverson by Kent Babb\n\n🏃‍♂️ Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen’ by Christopher McDougall\n\nLuke Upton (Author of 3 rugby books, most recently Rugby’s Greatest Mavericks)\n\n🏉 Into the Wind – The Life of Carwyn James by Alun Gibbard – a fantastic read brilliantly evoking the life of a complex and talented man and the world in which he lived. The best rugby book I’ve ever read.\n\n🏉 Fringes: Life on the Edge of Professional Rugby by Ben Mercer – an honest and entertaining view of the lower end of professional French rugby\n\n🏉 Rucks, Mauls and Gaelic Football by Billy & Moss Keane – the biography of Moss Keane a warm and funny read about a true rugby maverick.\n\n⚾ The Boys of Summer by Roger Kahn – truly absorbing and obviously is one of the most, if not the most influential sports book ever.\n\n⚽ The Second Half by Roy Keane with Roddy Doyle – honest and thoughtful\n\n⚽ Rock Bottom by Paul Merson – raw and eye opening first book about Merson’s addictions.\n\nBruce Schoenfeld (author of The Match: Althea Gibson and Angela Buxton, and The Last Serious Thing. New book, Game of Edges: The Analytics Revolution and the Future of Professional Sports – coming in June 2023)\n\n⚾ The Glory of Their Times: The Story of the Early Days of Baseball Told by the Men Who Played by Lawrence Ritter\n\n⚽ All Played Out: The Full Story of Italia ’90 by Pete Davies\n\n🏒 The Game by Ken Dryden\n\nJon Finkel (author of a number of excellent books including Hoops Heist)\n\n⚾ Sandy Koufax: A Lefty’s Legacy by Jane Leavy\n\n⚾ Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero by Leigh Montville\n\n🏊 The Three Year Swim Club: The Untold Story of Maui’s Sugar Ditch Kids and Their Quest for Olympic Glory by Julie Checkoway\n\n⚾ Rickey: The Life and Legend of an American Original by Howard Bryant\n\n🏀Michael Jordan: The Life by Roland Lazenby\n\nGene de Gourville (Author of Forged from Love about the Trinidad and Tobago team at the 2006 World Cup)\n\n⚽ Football Against the Enemy by Simon Kuper – the book that made me realize that I wanted to be an author.\n\n⚽ 32 Programmes by Dave Roberts – I really loved the way that he described moments in his life and told that story.\n\n⚽ In the Heat of the Midday Sun by Steven Scragg – the way the story of the 86 World Cup was put together was what any fan of the event would want but has rarely ever been done.\n\nMatt Evans (author of USA ’94: The World Cup that Changed the Game)\n\n🏏 Steve Smith’s Men: Behind Australian Cricket’s Fall by Geoff Lemon.\n\n🏀 Showtime: Magic, Kareem, Riley and the Los Angeles Lakers Dynasty of the 1980s by Jeff Pearlman.\n\nPaul Little (author of In the Shadow of Benbulben: Dixie Dean at Sligo Rovers)\n\n⚽ The Damned United by David Peace – extraordinary story telling.\n\nTris Dixon (author of supurb Boxing books including Damage and Warrior: One Champion’s Incredible Search for His Identity)\n\n🥊 Muhammad Ali’s Greatest Fight: Cassius Clay vs USA by Howard Bingham\n\n🥊 Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times by Thomas Hauser\n\n🥊 Tarnished Armour: Hope and Fears in Heavyweight Boxing by Dominic Calder-Smith\n\n🥊 Dark Trade: Lost in Boxing by Donald McRae\n\n🥊 In Sunshine Or In Shadow: How Boxing Brought Hope in the Troubles by Donald McRae\n\n🥊 Boxing Babylon: Behind the Shadowy World of the Prize Ring by Nigel Collins\n\n🥊 The Years of the Locust: A True Story of Murder, Money and Mayhem in the Last Age of Boxing by Jon Hotten\n\n🥊 In This Corner 42 World Champions Tell Their Stories by Peter Heller\n\n🥊 A Flame of Pure Fire: Jack Dempsey and the Roaring Twenties by Roger Kahn,\n\n🥊 The Good Son: The Life of Ray Boom Boom Mancini by Mark Kriegel\n\n🥊 Fighting Words by Harry Mullan\n\n🥊 Ring of Deceit: Inside the Biggest Sports and Banking Scandal in History by Bruce Henderson and Dean Allison\n\n🥊 Hard Luck: The Triumph and Tragedy of “Irish” Jerry Quarry” by Steve Springer\n\n🥊 Dog Rounds: Death and Life in the Boxing Ring by Elliot Worsell\n\n🥊 King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero by David Remnick\n\nSeth Burkett (author of The Boy in Brazil)\n\n⚽ The Miracle of Castel di Sangro: A Tale of Passion and Folly in the Heart of Italy by Joe McGinnis\n\n⚽ Up Pohnpei: A Quest to Reclaim the Soul of Football by Leading the World’s Ultimate Underdogs to Glory by Paul Watson\n\n⚽ Futebol: Brazilian Way of Life by Alex Bellos\n\n🥊 A Man’s World: The Double Life of Emile Griffith by Donald McRae\n\nIan Ridley (author of numerous excellent books including The Breath of Sadness)\n\n⚽ Football Wizard – The Story of Billy Meredith: The Life and Times of Football’s First Superstar by John Harding.\n\nSteven Bell (author of three books including A Man of All Talents: The Extraordinary Life of Douglas ‘Duggy’ Clark)\n\n⚽ The Miracle of Castel di Sangro: A Tale of Passion and Folly in the Heart of Italy by Joe McGinnis\n\n⚽ Back From the Brink: The Autobiography by Paul McGrath\n\n🥊 Bundini: Don’t Believe the Hype by Todd D.

It’s not just a sports book — it’s an investigation into the power of streaks. But it’s completely fascinating, wildly entertaining, and utterly hilarious. It’s the best book I’ve ever read about the NBA. But it’s also the best book I’ve ever read about videogames, behavioral economics, stock-picking, Shakespeare and sugar-beet farming. I cannot recommend it highly enough!\n\nSteven Scragg (author of a trilogy of books on European club football and In Heat of the Midday Sun)\n\n⚽ My Father And Other Working-Class Football Heroes by Gary Imlach\n\n🎾 Open by Andre Agassi\n\nLuke G. Williams (author of multiple books including Richmond Unchained: The Biography of the World’s First Black Sporting Superstar)\n\n🥊 Dark Trade: Lost in Boxing by Donald McRae – Don is the master. No one finds the humanity of their subjects or is as emphatic as him.\n\n🥊 This Bloody Mary Is The Last Thing I Own by Jonathan Rendall.

Brilliantly researched account of the life and times of Jack Johnson, possibly the most significant sporting figure of the 20th century.\n\n🥊 Boxiana: Or, Sketches of Ancient and Modern Pugilism by Pierce Egan (1821). The founding father of sports journalism. Egan’s colourful prose brought to life the first golden era of British sport by illuminating the life and times of the bare knuckle boxing scene. Often overlooked and crying out for a definitive, annotated reissue.\n\n🥊 The Boxing Kings: When American Heavyweights Ruled the Ring by Paul Beston. Wonderfully readable account of the heavyweight championship holders, illuminating just how important the title was in America during its glory days. Sheds wonderful new light on familiar names and contains just the right amount of historical context and background.\n\n🎱 Black Farce and Cue Ball Wizards by Clive Everton. Everton’s career is one of the most astonishing in British sports writing. Over 50 years as editor of Snooker Scene magazine during which time he held snooker’s often corrupt and inept administrators to account. This book – part personal memoir part history of the game, is written with elegance and integrity.\n\nGreg Hanlon (author of Watch My Smoke with Eric Dickerson and A Giant Win with Tom Coughlin)\n\n🏈🦅 Bringing the Heat by Mark Bowden\n\nMartin Calladine (author of Fit and Proper People: The Lies and Fall of OWNAFC)\n\n⚽ How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the FA Cup by J.L. Carr – both my all-time favourite sports books and the only sports novel I really love. It’s the warm, whimsical story of a village football team that, powered by a wealthy landowner, an ex-pro and a Hungarian émigré academic, enter and win the FA Cup. It’s an hilarious book that will set off powerful nostalgia in anyone who’s spent any time in an isolated British village. There are many good books about the birth of football in the North West of England, but I’ve always found them a bit dry.\n\n⚽ Shooting Stars: The brief and Glorious history of Blackburn Olympic by Graham Phythian. A brief, vivid and hard-to-find account of the first team from the north of England to win the FA Cup. Although the club lasted just a decade, its story illuminates the formative years of the game to life with extraordinary detail. A masterpiece in miniature.\n\n🏀 Boom Town: The Fantastical Saga Of Oklahoma City, Its Chaotic Founding… Its Purloined Basketball Team, And The Dream Of Becoming A World Class Metropolis by Sam Anderson. An astonishing history of Oklahoma City, its culture and its basketball team. Wide-ranging and brilliantly written, I was completely gripped by the book despite it being about a city which I knew virtually nothing about and a sport that I don’t follow.\n\nDeclan Lynch (author of numerous books including Days of Heaven: Italia ’90 and the Charlton Years)\n\n⚽ The Rodfather: Inside the Beautiful (Ugly, Ridiculous, Hilarious) Game by Roddy Collins with Paul Howard.

If that couldn’t fire you up, you were hurtin’. Terry Pluto’s oral histories helped bring folks so much of the fun of the ABA and old NBA. Those books really lit me up about going out and getting to know the people in the league. Taylor Branch’s work with Bill Russell and all of his writing about MLK and civil rights really resonated with me, as did the work of the great political biographer, Robert Caro. The great John McPhee wrote “A Sense of Where You Are,” about Bill Bradley. Mark Kreigel’s book on Pistol Pete was a huge help. And John Feinstein on Bobby Knight? Holy shit. And Kareem’s “Giant Steps” and other works. Jonathan Abrams “Boys Among Men.” Bob Ryan’s work in illuminating the Celtics. Jackie Macmullan too. Sam Smith’s “The Jordan Rules.” Jack McCallum’s “Unfinished Business” on the Celtics. Cameron Stauth’s work. Scott Howard-Cooper on Steve Kerr. George Mumford’s “The Mindful Athlete,” Phil Jackson’s work. Rafe Bartholmew’s “Pacific Rims””; Peter Golenbock on Jim Valvano. Jeff Pearlman’s good to go. Chris Herring’s Blood Garden and other work. I enjoyed Timothy Bella on Sir Charles. David Remnick and David Maraniss are incredible bad asses. Charley Rosen’s work. Alex Wolff. The entire stable of Sports Illustrated writers for decades. So many have helped. Mark Heisler on Pat Riley. And I’m sure I’m leaving folks out. Just in basketball there’s an amazing community of writers out there. And that’s just hoops. Don’t get me started on baseball lit. Or football.\n\n(I liked Roland’s comment so much I didn’t try split it out into the different books)\n\nGeorge Tsitsonis (author of Achieving The Impossible-The Remarkable Story of Greece’s EURO 2004 Victory)\n\n⚽ Dynamo: Defending the Honour of Kiev by Andy Dougan\n\n⚽ Angels with Dirty Faces: The Footballing History of Argentina by Jonathan Wilson\n\n⚽ Stamping Grounds: Liechtenstein’s Quest for the World Cup by Charlie Connelly\n\n⚽ Minnows United: Adventures at the Fringes of the Beautful Game by Mat Guy\n\n⚽ The Miracle of Castel di Sangro: A Tale of Passion and Folly in the Heart of Italy by Joe McGinnis\n\n⚽ Thirty-One Nil: On the Road with Football’s Outsiders: A World Cup Odyssey by James Montague\n\n⚽ The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football by David Goldblatt;\n\n⚽ Football Against the Enemy by Simon Kuper\n\n⚽ Red Wine and Arepas: How Football is Becoming Venezuela’s Religion by Jordan Florit\n\n⚽ Who Ate All the Squid – Football Adventures in South Korea by Devon Rowcliffe\n\n⚽ Origin Stories: The Pioneers Who Took Football to the World by Chris Lee\n\nKevin Burke (author of One Night in Dudelange)\n\n⚽ Stamping Grounds: Liechtenstein’s Quest for the World Cup by Charlie Connelly\n\n⚽ Welcome to Hell?

How the horse and its jockey overcame their own demons is a wonderful tale and Hillenbrand has a beautiful writing style.\n\n🥊 Dark Trade: Lost in Boxing by Donald McRae. Brilliant behind the scenes look at the careers of boxers such as Chris Eubank, James Toney and Roy Jones. It explores the careers at the start and how certain fights affect them personally in a way no other boxing book has done since.\n\n🥊 Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson by Geoffrey Ward. The biography of Jack Johnson is an in depth read of the first black man to become world heavyweight champion. Him not caring about what others thought, at a time when his actions and words could have got him killed and people were trying to take him down, shows a remarkable bravery and in many ways inspirational. Excellent read by Ward and Ken Burns’ documentary based on the book is superb too.\n\n⚽ Provided You Don’t Kiss Me: 20 Years with Brian Clough by Duncan Hamilton. An excellent account of Hamilton’s friendship with Brian Clough, when Hamilton was a journalist in Nottingham. The workings of the friendship are a fascinating read in conjunction with what Clough was going through as manager of Nottingham Forest.\n\nMaurice Brosnan (Irish Examiner senior sportswriter)\n\nHurling: Revolution Years by Denis Walsh\n\n🏈 Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream by Buzz Bissinger\n\n🚴 Rough Ride: Behind the Wheel With a Pro Cyclist by Paul Kimmage\n\n🥊 The Sweet Science by A.J.

Wojnarowski spent a season with coach Bob Hurley’s St Anthony’s high school basketball team to document the impact Hurley and the teachers have on the lives of the kids who play for him. The book is an incredible documentation of how sport can change lives and how important it is to have some in your corner fighting to give you a chance.\n\n🏈 Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream by Buzz Bissinger – I love books by people who are embedded within a team. Sport can often be a vehicle to tell us about the people involved or the society in which they exist. Friday Night Lights is the best example of this concept with Bissinger exploring the idea of a high school sports team keeping a town together. Through this lens, Bissinger tells the story of a town whose best years seem behind it, of race and class, of what happens when society makes heroes and celebrities of kids (most players are 17), and what the fall out of that is when they stop playing.\n\n⚽ Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby. The most important book I’ve ever read. As a kid I always knew I had stories I wanted to write but I didn’t like reading. Reading something school made you do. Then I was given a copy of Fever Pitch and a whole world opened up. A book about someone who wanted be a writer who loved football. A book that explained that fandom wasn’t crazy, that feeling this way about your team happened to other people. Books could teach you that? I was hooked. And I have been ever since.\n\nTom Flight (author of Yer Joking Aren’t Ya: The Story of Middlesbrough’s 1996/97 Season)\n\n⚽ Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics by Jonathan Wilson – the one that means the most. I’d been a football fan all my life, then I picked up a copy when I turned 30 and it just seemed to open up a whole other dimension of being a football fan. I started writing about football after I’d read this.\n\n⚽ All Played Out: The Full Story of Italia ’90 by Pete Davies. I’m too young to remember Italia 90 but I came of age as a football fan in the early/mid 90’s and everything seemed to be in the shadow of this epic event. I would constantly ask my older brothers about it, and I rewatched a taped version of the BBC review of tournament endlessly. So reading this book was unforgettable the way it takes you right there amongst all the drama.\n\n🥊 Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson by Geoffrey Ward. Jack Johnson’s life is just an incredible story so well told here.\n\n🏀 The Great Nowitzki: Basketball and the Meaning of Life by Thomas Pletzinger.

That was during her description of one of the big races. What I learnt from Seabiscuit was that, although you have to do loads of research, you don’t have to spend lots of time advertising that to the reader. You should attribute everything of course – but not all the time and in every paragraph.\n\n🥊 King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero by David Remnick. In late 2010 I curated a ’50 greatest sports books of all time’ series in The Times. We asked loads of people for their top threes and then collated the results and ran the series over a week, culminating in the big reveal of the winner on the Saturday. The No.1 was ‘King of the World’ by David Remnick. We also secured an interview with Remnick which was a coup. At the time I hadn’t read it but naturally I did so straight away. It was worth all the nominations and praise it had received. Of course it helps if you are writing about the most charismatic sportsman of all time, but it’s still a stunningly brilliant book.\n\nP.J. Laverty (author of The Gaffer)\n\n🥊 King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero by David Remnick\n\n⚽ The Rise of Gerry Logan by Brian Glanville. Glanville is known more for his sports journalism but he wrote football fiction too.

The consistency of prose is excellent and annoying in equal measure as someone who finds the writing process a rollercoaster.\n\n⚽ Underground, Overground: The Fault Lines of Football Clubs by Andrew Thomas – I think nowhere near enough people have read this terrific, thoughtful read,\n\n⚽ The 50: Football’s Most Influential Players by Jon Driscoll – Jon Driscoll’s two books are superb but I don’t see anyone mention them – I cannot recommend them highly enough, The 50 in particular is a straight forward concept written with a love that shines through.\n\nAnthony Broxton (author of upcoming Hope and Glory: Rugby League in Thatcher’s Britain)\n\n🏉 Simply The Best – the story of the 1990 Kangaroos by Adrian McGregor remains the best piece of writing on rugby league. McGregor was working for the Sydney Morning Herald and to immerse himself in the Northern England culture, he rented a cottage for six months as the Kangaroos arrived for the most eagerly awaited tour in test history. McGregor combined the best of sports journalism with travel writing on the north to examine the British rugby league in its moment of radical change. As the Thatcher era was coming to an end, he used the tour to look at the social and cultural impact of the age. It remains the standard to which rugby league writers and historians should aspire to.\n\nJason Cannon (author of the excellent Charlie Murphy: The Iconoclastic Showman behind the Chicago Cubs)\n\n⚾ I was Right on Time: My Journey From the Negro Leagues to the Majors by Buck O’Neil\n\n🏀 Fall River Dreams: A Team’s Quest for Glory, A Town’s Search for Its Soul by Bill Reynolds\n\n🥊 A Flame of Pure Fire: Jack Dempsey and the Roaring Twenties by Roger Kahn\n\n⚾ October 1964 by David Halberstam\n\n🏈 Reading Football: How the Popular Press Created an American Spectacle by Michael Oriard\n\nRod Honecker (author of the upcoming Brick City Grudge Match)\n\n🥊 Max Schmeling: An Autobiography\n\n🥊 Somebody Up There Likes Me by Rocky Graziano\n\nMax lived an incredible life & Rocky’s tale of a wayward youth to redemption.

Much imitated, it’s a book that’s hard to beat.\n\n🚴 The Rider by Tim Krabbé – every cyclist’s favourite book.\n\n🚴 Alfonsina by Ilona Kamps – a sort-of photo-novel about the Italian cyclist Alfonsina Strada, who twice participated in Il Lombardia and later went on to try her hand at the Giro d’Italia. She is also the holder of a mythical Hour record. Cycling’s many myths are a passion project for me lately.\n\n🚴 The Descent: My Epic Fall From Cycling Superstardom to Doping Dead End by Thomas Dekker – one of the best books looking at cycling’s doping problem. It knocks all the Lance-Armstrong-and-My-Part-in-His-Downfall books into a cocked hat.\n\n🚴 The Art of Cycling: Philosophy, Meaning and Life on Two Wheels by James Hibbard – easily the best of 2022’s batch of cycling books, a memoir that tells the story of the author and his relationship with his father through a brief history of philosophy. It’s up there with a book like Emily Chappell’s ‘ What Goes Around ‘ for feeling like a fresh way to tell a story.\n\n⚾ The Curious Case of Sidd Finch by George Plimpton – A favourite baseball novel. Generally, it’s the world of baseball that has produced the better books. Even without understanding the game ( Who’s on first? ) I love the way novelists approach the sport without feeling the need to explain its rules, something too many novelists in other sports (especially cycling) can’t do.\n\nGary Shaw (author of five books including The Mersey Fighters)\n\n🏉 Rugby’s Great Split: Class, Culture and the Origins of Rugby League Football by Tony Collins. A few standout proper sports history books but for scale and great social insight you’ve got to go a long way to best the rugby league maestro.

Fascinating material.)\n\n🏈 One Knee Equals Two Feet: And Everything Else You Need to Know About Football by John Madden. (There’s never been a better spokesman/promoter of the game than the former Oakland Raiders coach and TV analyst. This book breaks down how Madden saw the game and explains how and why players excel on the gridiron. With Madden narrating the game, it’s, well, fun, very fun.)\n\nWhat’s Wrong With Sports by Howard Cosell. (The broadcasting giant delivers a scathing critique of sports’ biggest problems at the time of this book’s publication in 1991. Drug use, big-time college sports corruption, wealthy owners holding cities hostage to get taxpayer-supported new stadium … these are some of the topics Cosell addresses with the proper moral outrage.)\n\nA Year in the Sun: The Games, The Players, The Pleasure of Sports by George Vecsey\n\n🏀The Last Pass: Cousy, Russell, the Celtics, and What Matters in the End by Gary Pomerantz\n\n🚣‍♂️ Six Minutes in Berlin: Broadcast Spectacle and Rowing Gold at the Nazi Olympics by Michael J.

The ordering of the books isn’t very scientific – broadly those at the very top of each category were mentioned by multiple people but the majority in each category were only chosen once or twice. For my analysis of which books were the most loved check out my commentary on the list in the All Sports Books Newsletter at https://allsportsbookreviews.substack.com/p/the-sports-books-that-sportswriters\n\nIf you want to see which writer chose which books then you can check out the alternative version of the list at The List – Writers’ Choices.\n\nThis is going to be a living document, updated every time I get a new answer from a different writer. I also plan to update the list over time to give more detail on each book as well as links to who recommend them.\n\nIf you find this list useful, please share with friends or on social media.
