Find out how to become a marine biologist and dive into an exciting career!\n\nAs a marine biologist, you could help us better understand marine life; create more sustainable fisheries; manage the impact of climate change, marine plastic pollution and other human activities on species and ecosystems; encourage others to protect our oceans, and much more.\n\nWhether you’re studying, switching careers or simply exploring potential career paths, this guide will help you understand what marine biologists do, and how you can become one.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nWhat does a marine biologist do?\n\nMarine biologists study marine organisms and their interactions with the environment (including humans). They might specialise in anything from marine food chains or fish behaviour to how marine ecosystems are impacted by human activities.\n\nHere are just a few examples of what marine biologists can do:\n\nMarine ecology: Studying how marine organisms relate to their living and non-living environment.\n\nBehavioural ecology: Studying the behaviour of marine species\n\n(Biological) oceanography: Study the physical, chemical and biological properties of oceans.\n\nModelling. Build models to estimate the distribution and abundance of marine life in different locations\n\nGenetics: Studying the genetic diversity of marine species.\n\nPhysiology: Understanding how marine physiological processes are impacted by factors like climate change or pollution.\n\nTaxonomy: Discovering and classifying new marine species.\n\nPaleobiology: Studying fossil marine organisms.\n\nReproductive biology: Studying how marine species reproduce.\n\nSystematics: Studying the diversification of marine organisms, and their relationships through time.\n\nMolecular biology: Studying the activities within marine organisms at the level of cellular molecules like proteins.\n\nMarine biologists can apply science to areas such as:\n\nSustainable fisheries management\n\nInforming and influencing marine policy\n\nMonitoring and managing marine pollution\n\nMarine environmental education\n\nControlling non-native and invasive species\n\nInforming environmentally sustainable development (ecological consultancy), for example by assessing the impact development projects may have one marine life and people using Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs)\n\nCleaning up contaminated sites or damaged ecosystems (remediation, rehabilitation or restoration)\n\nSustainable shipping\n\nSustainable tourism (or ecotourism)\n\nPutting a value on the benefits that nature provides us (Environmental economics)\n\nUnderstanding past environments and climates\n\nCarrying out ex-situ (off-site) conservation in aquariums, etc.\n\nMarine biologists might also choose to specialise on specific areas, such as:\n\nTropical marine biology: Studying tropical marine organisms and ecosystems\n\nBenthic (sea floor) or pelagic (open ocean) systems\n\nMarine phycology: Studying marine algae\n\nAnd of course… marine conservation biology!\n\nIf you’re considering a career as a marine biologist, the sea’s the limit! Once trained, you might choose to become a champion for sharks, help local communities manage their fisheries, or help governments determine where to place marine reserves.\n\nWhere do marine biologists work?\n\nWhether you enjoy being in the field, in an office, in a lab, or diving at remote field sites, you can find an environment you thrive in with a marine biology career.\n\nUnderstanding the five main employer types can help you navigate a career in marine biology. They are:\n\nAcademia – Help create the research base that practitioners need to effectively conserve marine species and ecosystems.
