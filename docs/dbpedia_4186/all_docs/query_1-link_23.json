        "text": "The second $20 million signature event of the 2024 PGA Tour season, the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, will boast quite the lineup of participants, from some of the best golfers in the world (41 of the top 50 in the OWGR are competing) to a star-studded collection of other athletes. Tom Brady, Alex Smith, Aaron Rodgers, Pau Gasol, Larry Fitzgerald and Buster Posey are just a select few of the non-professional golfers teeing it up this week in the pro-am portion of the event, with Rodgers looking to successfully defend his title.\n\nUnlike in years past, the 2024 tour stop will have an 80-player field competing across just two courses, Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill Golf Course, and the amateurs will play for just the first two rounds. (Congrats to Jeff Rhodes, who played with Rory McIlroy and claimed the Pro-Am victory on Friday by one stroke over George Still, Pascal Grizot and Egon Durban.) There's also no cut this week in the pro event, and the Celebrity Shootout on Wednesday will not be happening this go-around, as well.\n\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will be making his debut in this tournament, after playing at Pebble Beach at the 2019 U.S. Open. He’ll be joined by reigning FedEx Cup champ Viktor Hovland (who won the 2018 U.S. Amateur at Pebble), Rory McIlroy, Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay, Max Homa and Matt Fitzpatrick, along with the top two FedEx Cup points leaders Chris Kirk and Matthieu Pavon. The players show up when the purse hits $20 million.\n\nRodgers and Ben Silverman won last year’s pro-am portion of the tournament at 26 under, and Justin Rose won for the first time in four years after a delay pushed the final day to Monday. It was his 11th win on tour, besting Brendon Todd and Brandon Wu by three shots.\n\nThis week's winner will receive 700 FedEx Cup points and a $3.6 million share of the $20 million prize money payout.\n\nTV Schedule\n\nGolf Channel will carry live coverage on Thursday and Friday from 3-7 p.m. EST. On Saturday, Golf Channel will start the coverage from 1-3 p.m. with CBS taking over with late afternoon coverage from 3-7 p.m. EST. On Sunday, Golf Channel begins coverage from 1-3 p.m. with CBS finishing the event from 3-6:30 p.m.\n\nSteaming Schedule\n\nPGA Tour Live streaming coverage takes place on ESPN+ from 11:30 a.m.-7 p.m. EDT from Thursday-Saturday, with Sunday's signoff coming at 6:30 p.m. This week's coverage includes the main feed, marquee groups, featured groups and featured hole.\n\nRELATED: Sign up for ESPN+ to watch PGA Tour Live and its 4,300+ hours of tournament coverage\n\nLeaderboard\n\nFind all live PGA Tour scoring data here.\n\nPublic\n\nPebble Beach Golf Links\n\nPebble Beach, CA, United States\n\nNot just the greatest meeting of land and sea in American golf, but the most extensive one, too, with nine holes perched immediately above the crashing Pacific surf—the fourth through 10th plus the 17th and 18th. Pebble’s sixth through eighth are golf’s real Amen Corner, with a few Hail Marys thrown in over an ocean cove on the eighth from atop a 75-foot-high bluff. Pebble hosted a successful U.S. Amateur in 2018 and a sixth U.S. Open in 2019. Recent improvements include the redesign of the once-treacherous 14th green, and reshaping of the par-3 17th green, both planned by Arnold Palmer’s Design Company a few years back—and the current changes to the iconic eighth hole. Pebble Beach hosted the Women's U.S. Open for the first time in 2023.\n\nView Course\n\nTee Times (all times EDT)\n\nSUNDAY/FINAL ROUND\n\nPublic\n\nSpyglass Hill Golf Course\n\nPebble Beach, CA, United States\n\nGiven the task of designing a course just up the 17 Mile Drive from Pebble Beach and Cypress Point, Robert Trent Jones responded with a combination of Pine Valley and Augusta National. The five opening holes, in Pine Valley-like sand dunes, are an all-too-brief encounter with the Pacific seacoast. The remaining holes are a stern hike through hills covered with majestic Monterey pines (which, sad to say, may someday disappear to pitch canker, but are being replaced in some areas with cypress trees). Add several water hazards that hearken back to the 16th at Augusta (a hole which Trent Jones designed, by the way) and you have what some panelists consider to be Trent’s finest work. Others say it’s the best course never to have hosted a major event. After all, even Pine Valley and Cypress Point have hosted Walker Cups.\n\nView Course\n\nPebble Beach Golf Links\n\nFirst tee\n\n10:45 a.m. -- Jordan Spieth, Taylor Montgomery, Andrew Putnam\n\n10:56 a.m. -- Tom Kim, Sam Ryder, Adam Hadwin\n\n11:07 a.m. -- Corey Conners, Byeong Hun An, Nicolai Højgaard\n\n11:18 a.m. -- Seamus Power, Tommy Fleetwood, S.H.
