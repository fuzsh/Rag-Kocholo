The results of ALTMs (Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Co, Pb, Cd, Zn, As, Hg) suggest that they are enriched naturally and with some local industrial sources for (avg. in Î¼gg(-1)) Fe (3530-7219), Mn (46-107.11), Cd (0.43-1.00) and Zn (48-103.98). Statistical results indicate that metal concentrations were from natural origin attributed to leaching, weathering process and industrial sources. Comparative studies of metal concentrations with sediment quality guidelines and ecotoxicological values indicate that there is no adverse biological effect. Enrichment factor and geoaccumulation indices results indicate moderate enhancement of Fe (Igeo class 1 in FMB), Cd (EF>50; Igeo classes 2-4) and Zn (Igeo classes 1 & 2).

Patients travel great distances to tertiary level care for management. This study aimed at analysing referral patterns to design an outreach programme for paediatric surgery in KwaZulu Natal. Data forms of patients referred to the service between January and July 2016 were correlated with the clinical record. Delays in management were compared to morbidity and mortality. Out of 781, 158 referrals were accepted as emergencies. The majority (62%) were children agedâ<â1 year. Gastro-intestinal problems (38.4%) and congenital anomalies (26.9%) formed the majority. Patients who died had a significantly longer delay in transfer. Longer total delay was associated with statistically significant greater morbidity. In a setting where a large rural population is served by single-centre tertiary care, delays exist and contribute to morbidity. The authors advocate the establishment of an outreach programme to address these issues.\n\nBuilding a Future without Gender Violence: Rural Teachers and Youth in Rural Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa, Leading Community Dialogue\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nde Lange, Naydene; Mitchell, Claudia\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis article advances the idea that rural youth and teachers are the key in leading community dialogue towards addressing gender-based violence (GBV) in their community through their film making.

A total of 513 rural households were randomly selected, and the descriptive results indicated that 51% of these households were food insecure, and they were somewhat negative about their entrepreneurial competencies. The estimated results indicated that entrepreneurship had a positive impact on food security. The study findings suggest that stimulating entrepreneurship through developing entrepreneurial competencies among the farming households is important for improved food security among rural households in SA.\n\nShanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) and the \"Big Five\" South African Research Universities\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBoshoff, N.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis article critically examines the methodology of the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) by generating raw scores for the \"big five\" South African research universities (Stellenbosch, Cape Town, Kwazulu-Natal, Pretoria and the Witwatersrand, henceforth referred to as SU, UCT, UKZN, UP and WITS) using the ARWUâ¦\n\nBurns in rural Kwa-Zulu Natal: epidemiology and the need for community health education.\n\nPubMed\n\nScheven, D; Barker, P; Govindasamy, J\n\n2012-12-01\n\nBurns are one of the leading causes of accidental deaths in South Africa. The northern Kwa-Zulu Natal (KZN) area, in which this study was conducted, has a population at high risk of burn. A large proportion of the population of KZN live in rural settlements and use traditional methods of cooking and heating. Children are often unsupervised or looked after by only slightly older children. This study investigates the need and potential focus of a health education programme within the setting of rural KZN. Examination of epidemiological data collected on 423 cases admitted to the Ngwelezana Hospital Burns Unit from 2008 to 2010. Children under the age of 12 were most at risk, making up 69.5% of all admissions. Most burns were caused in the home by incidents involving hot water and food (69.5%). Direct flame burns accounted for 19.6% of injuries and were more common with increasing age. Of the direct flame burns, 20.5% occurred during an epileptic seizure. Non-accidental injury accounted for 8.7% of burns. Public health awareness was assessed by investigating the use of first aid treatments, and the time delay between burn and presentation to hospital. First aid provision was attempted in 53.1% of cases. Only 1.1% of burn victims were treated with running water for 10 min or more. Other products commonly applied to the burn wound (31.7% of cases) included oil, ice or eggs, some of which are known to be harmful. The time from burn to presentation at hospital varied greatly. The median time of presentation for local residents was only 6h; however, the median referral delay from a district hospital was 6 days. These factors have important consequences on the outcome of burns. The implementation of a community health education programme which focuses on adults as well as children, has the potential to decrease both the incidence and morbidity associated with burns in rural KZN. The pattern of burns is similar to that seen in urban areas (mostly children, and mostly around\n\nKey Dimensions of Effective Leadership for Change: A Focus on Township and Rural Schools in South Africa\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNgcobo, Thandi; Tikly, Leon Paul\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe article identifies key dimensions of effective leadership for change in historically disadvantaged, township and rural schools in South Africa.

Although the sample included mainly township and rural primary and secondary schools it also included a smaller sample ofâ¦\n\nDangerous girls and cheating boys: Zulu-speaking disabled young peoples' constructs of heterosexual relationships in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nChappell, Paul\n\n2017-05-01\n\nAcross South Africa there is a growing body of work that explores gender dynamics in heterosexual relationships between young people aged 15-24Â years. This is mainly influenced by the high prevalence of HIV and the incidence of intimate partner violence in this age group. Most studies to date have been based upon non-disabled young people, with limited focus on young disabled people. In an attempt to address this gap, this paper describes findings from a study conducted with 22 Zulu-speaking young people with visual and physical disabilities in KwaZulu-Natal. Throughout the findings, young disabled participants appeared to downplay their disability with respect to intimate relationships and accentuated the interweaving of complementary and contentious discourses of gender and cultural identity. Taking cognisance of the intersectionality of gender and cultural discourses, the paper extend constructs of disabled sexualities beyond an exclusive gaze on disability in the South African context.\n\nThe Case of isiZulu for Non-Mother Tongue Speakers at the University of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa--Is the Compulsory Language Module Promoting Social Cohesion?\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNaidoo, Shamila; Gokool, Roshni; Ndebele, Hloniphani\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Minister of Higher Education, Blade Nzimande's, call on the 5th of April 2011 for South African universities to implement a policy which saw all university graduates exiting with a credit in an African language was the catalyst for the University of KwaZulu-Natal's decision to implement a compulsory isiZulu module for all non-mother tongueâ¦\n\nHilton College Farm School, Natal, South Africa.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBeveridge, Sue\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe Hilton College Farm School is a primary school providing for the educational needs of children in a rural area of Natal, South Africa.

K.; Phillips, D.\n\n2005-11-01\n\nThe Mesoproterozoic Natal Metamorphic Province of Kwazulu-Natal in South Africa is an assemblage of several tectonic units, including accreted oceanic island arcs, obducted oceanic crust and deformed basin material. The highly deformed Mfongosi Group occurs at the leading edge of collision (the Natal thrust front), against and directly overlying the southern margin of the Kaapvaal Craton. Structures within the Mfongosi Group record \"local\" D1 and D2 events, the first of which was \"oblique obduction\", with predominantly N- to NNE-verging thrusting ( D1). This was followed by sinistral transpression combined with vertical constriction, forming SW-plunging kink folds and SW-plunging prolate pillow basalts ( D2). The third and final event ( D3) was E-W to ESE-WNW extension in a post-thrusting phase, defined by fibrous antitaxial quartz-calcite veining. The westernmost portion of the Mfongosi Group, the Ngubevu area, shows significantly higher finite strains (up to Rf = 12) compared to central Mfongosi and eastern Nkandlha areas ( Rf = 1.5 and less), suggesting highly oblique, largely NE-directed initial collision. Deformation of the NTF in the context of nappe emplacement is constrained by 40Ar/ 39Ar dating of post-cataclastic nematoblastic/porphyroblastic hornblende of the Manyane amphibolite close to the thrust between the Tugela nappe and the Mfongosi Group in the Mfongosi area. Hornblende overgrew the products of low-temperature deformation during the \"local\" D1 and D2. A minimum age of 1171 Â± 16 Ma (95% conf., including J-error; weighted by âMSWD; MSWD = 4.3) is obtained for the tectonic juxtaposition of the Tugela nappe against the southern portions of the \"Mfongosi Basin\". This \"local\" D1 and D2 of the Mfongosi Group pre-dates the regional \"oblique D1\" and \"left-lateral D2\" previously determined for the central and southern terranes of the Natal Metamorphic Province by other researchers. Comparison of the 1171 Â± 16 Ma age, with ages for shearing and\n\nMy Fulbright Experience in South Africa\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCapps, Ken\n\n2009-08-01\n\nAs part of the Fulbright Scholar Program, the author lectured in general chemistry courses and assisted with curriculum development at the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal.

Health concerns resulting from the co-existence of over-nutrition and under-nutrition in low income populations in South Africa have been fully recognized in the last two decades. This study aimed to further investigate dietary adequacy amongst adults in rural KwaZulu-Natal, by determining daily energy and nutrient intakes, and identifying the degree of satisfaction of dietary requirements. Cross-sectional study assessing dietary adequacy from 24-hour dietary recalls of randomly selected 136 adults in Empangeni, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Results are presented for men (nâ=â52) and women (nâ=â84) 19-50 and >50 years old. Mean energy intake was greatest in women >50 years (2852 kcal/day) and exceeded Dietary Reference Intake's for both men and women, regardless of age. Mean daily energy intake from carbohydrates was 69% for men and 67% for women, above the Dietary Reference Intake range of 45-65%. Sodium was also consumed in excess, and the Dietary Reference Intakes of vitamins A, B12, C, D, and E, calcium, zinc and pantothenic acid were not met by the majority of the population. Despite mandatory fortification of staple South African foods, micronutrient inadequacies are evident among adults in rural South African communities. Given the excess caloric intake and the rising prevalence of obesity and other non-communicable diseases in South Africa, a focus on diet quality may be a more effective approach to influence micronutrient status than a focus on diet quantity.\n\nHIV/AIDS Stigma Attitudes among Educators in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nChao, Li-Wei; Gow, Jeff; Akintola, Goke; Pauly, Mark\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground: One hundred and twenty educators from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, underwent HIV/AIDS training.

Furthermore, university students constitute an important community in the intervention against the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Students in the age group of 15-24 years are at a greater risk of HIV infection than any other group in the country; yet, little is known about why they continue to engage in risky sexual practices. This study was designed to explore the sexual behaviour of students in a metropolitan Durban University of Technology in KwaZulu-Natal to understand the social factors underlying their risk of HIV infection. This is a qualitative study that used cluster sampling where the population was stratified by campus and faculty. The study population was selected using a standard randomization technique. This was a part of a multi-phased research project aimed at providing a sero-prevalence baseline and an analysis of risk-taking behaviour at a Durban University of Technology in the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality area. The study highlights peer pressure among students as an influence in promoting high-risk sexual behaviour. Within this context, the findings revealed that university students lack the ability to negotiate risk-aware decisions especially regarding sexual relationships. This study draws attention to the perspectives of African university students regarding their risk-taking sexual practices and selected factors which influence such behaviour. The findings are not exhaustive in exploring contextual antecedents that shape students' sexual practices. However, they provide an important basis in understanding key factors which expose students to HIV infections. The study provides insights into opportunities for further studies as well as preventative implications.\n\nThe Development of Conceptions of the Right to Literacy in Traditional Rural Africa\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDay, Kathryn Louise\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis study examined conceptions of the right to literacy in children, adolescents, and young adults living in rural Zulu villages in the mountains of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, as one instantiation of the development of conceptions of human rights in a developing world setting.

The method recoveries, limits of detection (LOD), and limits of quantification were determined. The method recoveries were 58.4% to 103%, and the LODs ranged between 1.16âng/L and 29.1âng/L for water and between 0.58âng/g and 14.5âng/g for sediment. The drugs were all present in wastewater and in most of the surface water and sediment samples. Aspirin was the most abundant pharmaceutical observed, 118âÂ±â0.82âÎ¼g/L in wastewater influent, and the most observed antibiotic was nalidixic acid (25.2-29.9âÎ¼g/L in wastewater); bezafibrate was the least observed. The distribution pattern of the antipyretic in water indicates more impact in suburban sites. The solid-liquid partitioning of the pharmaceuticals between sediment and water, measured as the distribution coefficient (logâKD ) gave an average accumulation magnitude of 10Ã to 32Ã in sediments than in water. The downstream distribution patterns for both water and sediment indicate discharge contributions from wastewater, agricultural activities, domestic waste disposal, and possible sewer system leakages. Although concentrations of the pharmaceuticals were comparable with those obtained from some other countries, the contamination of the present study site with pharmaceuticals has been over time and continues at present, making effective management and control necessary.

Muthama\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract The Dioscorea buchananii complex is shown to comprise three species, one of which is divided into two subspecies, based on morphological data. Two species, Dioscorea rupicola Kunth and Dioscorea multiloba Kunth, are endemic or subendemic to South Africa and of widespread occurrence in KwaZulu Natal. They differ markedly from each other in inflorescence and floral morphology and appear to be ecologically differentiated. The third species, Dioscorea buchananii Benth., is primarily found in southeastern tropical Africa, but a small number of specimens collected in South Africa in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are placed in an endemic subspecies, Dioscorea buchananii subsp. undatiloba (Baker) Wilkin. The latter taxon is a high priority in terms of rediscovery and conservation. Keys, descriptions, supporting information and illustrations are provided and made available online through eMonocot biodiversity informatics tools. Three nomenclatural acts are undertaken: two names are placed in synonymy and a new combination made.

Post-apartheid population policies shifted away from population control to aligning policies to the global agenda that placed emphasis on the link between population and development. The focus on population and development polices in post-apartheid South Africa is on social equality, justice and peace rather than controlling sections of the population. Given the shift, this paper interrogates the conceptions of contraceptive use among rural communities in KwaZulu-Natal. Our primary objective is to understand the dynamics surrounding access to and use of family planning services in peri-urban and rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal. Using focus group data, the findings of the study suggest that different social categories interact with the family planning programmes differently. How teenagers and married women perceive the value of family planning differs. Gender differences regarding the use of condoms are also evident.

Post-apartheid population policies shifted away from population control to aligning policies to the global agenda that placed emphasis on the link between population and development. The focus on population and development polices in post-apartheid South Africa is on social equality, justice and peace rather than controlling sections of the population. Given the shift, this paper interrogates the conceptions of contraceptive use among rural communities in KwaZulu-Natal. Our primary objective is to understand the dynamics surrounding access to and use of family planning services in peri-urban and rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal. Using focus group data, the findings of the study suggest that different social categories interact with the family planning programmes differently. How teenagers and married women perceive the value of family planning differs. Gender differences regarding the use of condoms are also evident. The paper attempts to grapple with the non-use of condoms despite the knowledge that these prevent pregnancy and provide protection from sexually-transmitted diseases. The contribution of this paper lies in its identification of socio-cultural factors and the political economy underlying the different attitudes towards contraceptive use in rural KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nThe ammonite genus Prionocycloceras (Spath, 1926), from the Coniacian of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKlinger, Herbert C.; Kennedy, William J.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nSubprionocyclus latiumbilicatus (Van Hoepen, 1968), and Subprionocyclus obesus (Van Hoepen, 1968), are revised, and referred to Prionocycloceras (Spath, 1926), a genus not previously recognised from the South African Cretaceous.

Aim: The aim of this study is to describe the associations between some hypothesized factors and the presence of symptomatic VVC. Subjects and Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 90 women diagnosed with symptomatic VVC and 108 women without symptomatic VVC were recruited when attending Umlazi D clinic, a primary health clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa between June 2011 and December 2011. Confirmed symptomatic VVC was determined by Gram stain and microbiological culture of vaginal swabs. For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women, HIV ribonucleic acid load in plasma and genital fluid was determined by real-time-polymerase chain reaction (BioMerieux, Lyon, France). CD4 counts were obtained from patientsâ medical records. Data were analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 (SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL, USA). Multiple logistic regression models were used to exclude univariate confounders. All tests were two-sided and a P < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Results: A total of 90% (81/90) of patients with symptomatic VVC complained of vulval itching, soreness and vaginal discharge when compared to 75.9% (82/108) of patients without symptomatic VVC (P < 0.01). Whilst pregnancy was independently associated with symptomatic VVC (P < 0.01), the latter was inversely related to Nugent's scores (P < 0.01). When compared with HIV negative women, the odds for symptomatic VVC increased among women with HIV-associated immunocompromise (CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3, P < 0.001), significantly shedding HIV in their genital tracts (P = 0.04), with plasma HIV load > 1000 copies/mL (P < 0.001). There was a significant negative association between the use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy and the presence of symptomatic VVC in HIV\n\nAn Investigation on Students' Risky Sexual Behavior at KwaZulu-Natal University, Durban, South Africa\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMutinta, Given; Govender, Kaymarlin; Gow, Jeff; George, Gavin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nUniversity environments are fertile grounds for risky sexual behaviors.

Methodology: All (N=325) Indian matriculation students, at high schools, in Northern Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa, were included in the study. A questionnaire was administered to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice of CSB. Results and conclusion: The study showed a prevalence of 16.9%. Most smokers (98.2%) had commenced the practice after the age of 10 years. The most common reason given for CSB was experimentation (83.6%). Main influence was family members followed by teachers and advertisements. The association between smoking and lung cancer was well-known by smokers (90.7%). There was very little awareness of anti-smoking programmes or organizations. Alarmingly, there was little formal health education on the dangers of smoking in schools. The implications of these results are discussed and recommendations on decreasing CSB are made.

In KwaZulu-Natal, in South Africa, antiretroviral therapy is available to some HIV-positive individuals. Antiretroviral adherence is an important issue for limiting HIV infection. Adherence to therapy may be linked to social support, particularly amidst the stigma prevalent in HIV. The purpose of this study was to examine characteristics related to social support and antiretroviral medication adherence. This cross-sectional, descriptive study explored the nature of the relationships among social support and other selected variables, including sociodemographic variables, quality of life, and adherence. After ethical review board approval, the sample of HIV-infected individuals who received care in outpatient clinics were recruited and completed the self-report instruments. The sample included English and/or isiZulu-speaking (n=149) individuals over the age of 18 years receiving treatment for HIV/AIDS. A total of 149 patients with a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS agreed to participate and completed questionnaires after completing informed consent procedures. The study participants were recruited at four outpatient settings in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. A descriptive, exploratory, cross-sectional design was utilized to explore the research questions: What are the characteristics of social support and the relationship to antiretroviral adherence in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa? Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to answer the research questions. Data analyses indicated that social support scores on the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey were moderate (M=64.4; S.D.=14.7) among the study participants. The number of close friends and family were significantly correlated with a greater sense of social support. Despite this, the lowest scores on the quality-of-life measure using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 item survey were reported on the Social\n\nMetamorphic charnockite in contact aureoles around intrusive enderbite from Natal, South Africa\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan den Kerkhof, Alfons M.; Grantham, Geoffrey H.\n\nIn the Port Edward area of southern Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa, charnockitic aureoles up to 10m in width in the normally garnetiferous Nicholson's Point Granite, are developed adjacent to intrusive contacts with the Port Edward Enderbite and anhydrous pegmatitic veins. Mineralogical differences between the country rock and charnockitic aureole suggest that the dehydration reaction Bt+Qtz-->Opx+Kfs+H2O and the reaction of Grt+Qtz-->Opx+Pl were responsible for the charnockitization. The compositions of fluid inclusions show systematic variation with: (1) the Port Edward Enderbite being dominated by CO2 and N2 fluid inclusions; (2) the non-charnockitized granite by saline aqueous inclusions with 18-23 EqWt% NaCl; (3) the charnockitic aureoles by low-salinity and pure water inclusions (<7 EqWt% NaCl); (4) the pegmatites by aqueous inclusions of various salinity with minor CO2. As a result of the thermal event the homogenization temperatures of the inclusions in charnockite show a much larger range (up to 390Â°C) compared to the fluid inclusions in granite (mostly <250Â°C). Contrary to fluid-controlled charnockitization (brines, CO2) which may have taken place along shear zones away from the intrusive body, the present ``proximal'' charnockitized granite formed directly at the contact with enderbite. The inclusions indicate contact metamorphism induced by the intrusion of ``dry'' enderbitic magma into ``wet'' granite resulting in local dehydration. This was confirmed by cathodoluminescence microscopy showing textures indicative for the local reduction of structural water in the charnockite quartz. Two-pyroxene thermometry on the Port Edward Enderbite suggests intrusion at temperatures of 1000-1050Â°C into country rock with temperature of <700Â°C. The temperature of aureole formation must have been between 700Â°C (breakdown of pyrite to form pyrrhotite) and 1000Â°C. Charnockitization was probably controlled largely by heat related to anhydrous intrusions causing\n\nGeological hazards associated with intense rain and flooding in Natal\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nThomas, M. A.; van Schalkwyk, A.\n\n1993-02-01\n\nThe combination of rugged topography and climate predisposes the province of Natal to severe floods. Information available since 1856 shows that bridge and slope failures have been recorded in twenty out of twenty-five flood episodes. Bridge failures are caused mostly by geological factors. The mechanism of failure can be classified broadly into foundation failures and changes of river course. Scour and debris build-up have led to failures of foundations located in rock and alluvial sediments. In preparing and replacing bridges the aims have been to increase the area of waterway, increase foundation depths to reach more competent strata and lay protection along banks and abutments to counteract scour. Historically, slope failures have not been well documented but following the 1987/88 storms 223 slope failures were recorded. The classification of the failures allowed the mechanisms of failure to be ascertained, and general design considerations to be reviewed. In areas adjacent to the Drakensberg Mountains slope failures are part of a natural erosion cycle which may be accelerated in periods of heavy rain. Throughout Natal, hummocky ground adjacent to dolerite intrusions reveals the on-going history of failure caused by water ingress and the generation of high pore water pressures on the slip planes. Classic flows occurred throughout the Greater Durban area where residual sandy soils of the Natal Group sandstone became supersaturated. Slumping was common on steep terrain underlain by granite-gneiss in the Kwa-Zulu area. Shales of the Pietermaritzburg Formation are notoriously unstable, yet few failures occurred during the summer storms of 1987/88. Inadequate drainage was responsible for many failures, this was particularly so along the railways.\n\nSector switching among histopathologists in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a qualitative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRuggunan, Shaun D; Singh, Suveera\n\n2013-05-30\n\nThe mobility of health care professionals from the public to private sector is prevalent in South Africa. However, literature on sector switching of clinical doctors remains limited. It is against this background that this study aims to make the labour market visible for histopathologists and identify the reasons for sector switching. This study is exploratory and descriptive. It uses qualitative methods, such as in-depth interviews, with 70% (n = 16/23) of the population of histopathologists in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Lee's (1966) push-pull theory is adapted to explain the pull sector switching behaviours of histopathologists. Interviews were recorded and independently transcribed. The narratives of the participants were coded to reflect the main themes that contributed to their sector switching behaviours. Five key themes emerged as reasons for the mobility of histopathologists from the public to private sector in KwaZulu-Natal. The findings indicate that remuneration, working conditions, work flexibility, career pathing and autonomy of labour processes are the key drivers of this mobility. Histopathologists provide a core function in the health care chain. However, their invisibility in academic discourse in both public health and human resources for health indicates the paucity of research undertaken on the importance of these specialists in the health care chain. This is especially significant in developing countries like South Africa, where there is a dearth of these specialists. This study, while exploratory, aims to open a dialogue to better understand their reasons for sector switching and, hopefully, inform policies on training, recruitment and retention of these specialists.\n\nSector switching among histopathologists in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a qualitative study\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground The mobility of health care professionals from the public to private sector is prevalent in South Africa.

H.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nBlood samples were obtained on four occasions over a 12-month period from individuals living in KwaZulu, South Africa, who had been exposed to DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane) as a consequence of its use in their homes to control transmission of malaria. The longitudinal changes in serum DDT and its major metabolities, DDE and DDD, were determined. No additional risk was considered to have been presented by the increases that occurred following application of the pesticide. There were significant increases in DDT, DDE and sigma DDT (DDT + its metabolites) for the age group > or = 21 years, but for the age group 3-20 years a reduction in serum levels occurred over 12 months. Two concurrent processes probably govern the increase and decrease in serum levels, and the relative contributions of each interchange as the individual becomes older. The results suggest that children in KwaZulu experience conditions that differ from those of their parents, as well as from those that affect children in developed countries. In consequence, it is desirable that risk assessments of vector control chemicals consider all sectors of a population.

Scaphitid ammonites are described and illustrated from the Upper Cretaceous of the coastal region of north-eastern South Africa. Scaphites kieslingswaldensis Langenhan and Grundey, 1891, Scaphites manasoaensis Collignon, 1965, and Yezoites concinna sp. nov. occur in the Coniacian part of the St Lucia Formation in northern KwaZulu-Natal. A further Yezoites sp. may also be from this level. Argentoscaphites corrugatus sp. nov. occurs in the Santonian to Lower Campanian Mzamba Formation on the northernmost coast of Eastern Cape Province. Yezoites australis sp. nov. occurs in the Upper Santonian part of the St Lucia and Mzamba formations of these areas, and Scaphites reesidei Collignon, 1969, is recorded from the Lower Campanian part of the Mzamba Formation. The scaphitid assemblage includes species previously described from Western Europe and Madagascar, together with Argentoscaphites, previously known only from Patagonia (and possibly South India). Dimorphism is recognised in Scaphites reesidei, Yezoites concinna sp. nov. and Y. australis sp. nov. Argentoscaphites corrugatus sp. nov. and Yezoites sp. are represented by microconchs only. Dimorphism has not been recognised in Scaphites kieslingswaldensis.\n\nSpatial distribution of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) patients in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKapwata, Thandi; Morris, Natashia; Campbell, Angela; Mthiyane, Thuli; Mpangase, Primrose; Nelson, Kristin N.; Allana, Salim; Brust, James C. M.; Moodley, Pravi; Mlisana, Koleka\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, has among the highest burden of XDR TB worldwide with the majority of cases occurring due to transmission. Poor access to health facilities can be a barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment of TB, which can contribute to ongoing transmission. We sought to determine the geographic distribution of XDR TB patients and proximity to health facilities in KwaZulu-Natal. Methods We recruited adults and children with XDR TB diagnosed in KwaZulu-Natal. We calculated distance and time from participantsâ home to the closest hospital or clinic, as well as to the actual facility that diagnosed XDR TB, using tools within ArcGIS Network analyst. Speed of travel was assigned to road classes based on Department of Transport regulations. Results were compared to guidelines for the provision of social facilities in South Africa: 5km to a clinic and 30km to a hospital. Results During 2011â2014, 1027 new XDR TB cases were diagnosed throughout all 11 districts of KwaZulu-Natal, of whom 404 (39%) were enrolled and had geospatial data collected. Participants would have had to travel a mean distance of 2.9 km (CI 95%: 1.8â4.1) to the nearest clinic and 17.6 km (CI 95%: 11.4â23.8) to the nearest hospital. Actual distances that participants travelled to the health facility that diagnosed XDR TB ranged from <10 km (n = 143, 36%) to >50 km (n = 109, 27%), with a mean of 69 km. The majority (77%) of participants travelled farther than the recommended distance to a clinic (5 km) and 39% travelled farther than the recommended distance to a hospital (30 km). Nearly half (46%) of participants were diagnosed at a health facility in eThekwini district, of whom, 36% resided outside the Durban metropolitan area. Conclusions XDR TB cases are widely distributed throughout KwaZulu-Natal province with a denser focus in eThekwini district. Patients travelled long distances to the health facility where they were diagnosed with XDR TB, suggesting a\n\nPrimary Drug Resistance in South Africa: Data from 10 Years of Surveys\n\nPubMed Central\n\nManasa, Justen; Katzenstein, David; Cassol, Sharon; Newell, Marie-Louise\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbstract HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) could reverse the gains of antiretroviral rollout. To ensure that current first-line therapies remain effective, TDR levels in recently infected treatment-naive patients need to be monitored. A literature review and data mining exercise was carried out to determine the temporal trends in TDR in South Africa. In addition, 72 sequences from seroconvertors identified from Africa Centre's 2010 HIV surveillance round were also examined for TDR. Publicly available data on TDR were retrieved from GenBank, curated in RegaDB, and analyzed using the Calibrated Population Resistance Program. There was no evidence of TDR from the 2010 rural KwaZulu Natal samples. Ten datasets with a total of 1618 sequences collected between 2000 and 2010 were pooled to provide a temporal analysis of TDR. The year with the highest TDR rate was 2002 [6.67%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.09â13.79%; n=6/90]. After 2002, TDR levels returned to <5% (WHO low-level threshold) and showed no statistically significant increase in the interval between 2002 and 2010. The most common mutations were associated with NNRTI resistance, K103N, followed by Y181C and Y188C/L. Five sequences had multiple resistance mutations associated with NNRTI resistance. There is no evidence of TDR in rural KwaZulu-Natal. TDR levels in South Africa have remained low following a downward trend since 2003. Continuous vigilance in monitoring of TDR is needed as more patients are initiated and maintained onto antiretroviral therapy.

In South Africa, it is practiced, among others, by the Zulu ethnic group who live mainly in the province of KwaZulu Natal. After falling into relative disuse in the Zulu community, the practice of virginity testing made a comeback some 10 years ago at around the time of the country's first democratic election and coinciding with the period when the HIV pandemic began to take hold. In July 2005 the South African Parliament passed a new Children's Bill which will prohibit virginity testing of children. The Bill has been met with outrage and public protest on the part of Zulu citizens. Traditional circumcision rites are also addressed in the new bill but are not banned. Instead, male children are given the right to refuse to participate in traditional initiation ceremonies which include circumcision. This paper asks why the practice of virginity testing is regarded as so troubling to the new democratic order that the state has chosen to take the heavy-handed route of banning it. The paper further asks why the state's approach to traditional male circumcision has been so different to its approach to virginity testing. Finally, the paper asks what these two challenging cases in the country's new democracy tell us about the nature of liberal democratic citizenship in South Africa 10 years after apartheid's formal demise.\n\nStudent Perceptions of Agricultural Education Programme Processes at Selected High Schools in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKidane, T.

South Africa has set targets to eliminate malaria by 2018 and research into complementary vector control tools such as the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is ongoing. It is important to understand community perceptions regarding malaria transmission and control interventions to enable development of community awareness campaign messages appropriate to the needs of the community. We aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding malaria transmission to inform a public awareness campaign for SIT in Jozini Local Municipality, Mamfene in KwaZulu-Natal province. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in three communities in Mamfene, KwaZulu-Natal during 2015. A structured field piloted questionnaire was administered to 400 randomly selected heads of households. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data. Of the 400 participants interviewed, 99% had heard about malaria and correctly associated it with mosquito bites. The sources of malaria information were the local health facility (53%), radio (16%) and community meetings (7%). Approximately 63% of the participants were able to identify three or four symptoms of malaria. The majority (76%) were confident that indoor residual spraying (IRS) kills mosquitoes and prevents infection. Bed nets were used by 2% of the participants. SIT knowledge was poor (9%), however 63% of the participants were supportive of mosquito releases for research purposes. The remaining 37% raised concerns and fears, including fear of the unknown and lack of information on the SIT. Appropriate knowledge, positive attitude and acceptable treatment-seeking behaviour for malaria were demonstrated by members of the community. Community involvement will be crucial in achieving success of the SIT and future studies should further investigate concerns raised by the community.

The study is based on longitudinal, population-based data collected by the Africa Centre demographic surveillance system. We consider whether the high rates of non-marriage among Africans in South Africa reported in the 1980s were reversed following the political transformation underway by the 1990s. Our findings show that marriage has continued to decline with a small increase in cohabitation among unmarried couples, particularly in more urbanised areas. Comparing surveillance and census data, we highlight problems with the use of the âliving togetherâ marital status category in a highly mobile population.

H.; Allen, A. R.; Cornell, D. H.; Harris, C.\n\n1996-10-01\n\nIn the Port Edward area of southern Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa, charnockitic aureoles up to Ë4 m in width are developed adjacent to contacts with Port Edward enderbite and pegmatites intruded into the normally garnetiferous Nicholson's Point granite. Other mineralogical differences between the aureoles and the granite include increased myrmekite and significantly less biotite in the former and the replacement of pyrite by pyrrhotite in the charnockitic rocks. No significant differences in major element chemistry between the garnet-biotite Nicholson's Point granite and charnockitic Nicholson's Point granite are seen, except possibly for higher CaO and TiO 2 in the charnockite. Higher Rb, Th, Nb and Y contents in the garnet-biotite granite suggest that these elements have been locally depleted from garnet-biotite granite during char nockitisation. This depletion is considered to be related to the reduction in biotite. Strontium and Ba contents are significantly higher in the charnockite. Generally higher S contents in the charnockite suggest S metasomatism, with S possibly being added from the enderbite. No differences in Î´18O isotope data are seen between the garnetiferous and hypersthene bearing granite. In the charnockite the LREEs are weakly depleted whereas the HREEs show greater depletion compared to the garnetiferous granite. The depletions in REEs are thought to be related to the breakdown of garnet. Europium is marginally enriched or unchanged in the charnockite relative to the garnetiferous granite. Two-pyroxene thermometry on the Port Edward enderbite suggests that it was intruded at temperatures of Ë1000-1100Â°C. The replacement of pyrite by pyrrhotite is also consistent with a thermal auroele. Consequently the charnockitic zones developed around the intrusions of Port Edward enderbite may result from the thermally driven dehydration of biotite. The aureoles developed adjacent to pegmatites are not considered to have resulted from heat but probably\n\nGenetic structure of South African Nguni (Zulu) sheep populations reveals admixture with exotic breeds\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKunene, Nokuthula Winfred\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe population of Zulu sheep is reported to have declined by 7.4% between 2007 and 2011 due to crossbreeding. There is insufficient information on the genetic diversity of the Zulu sheep populations in the different area of KwaZulu Natal where they are reared. The study investigated genetic variation and genetic structure within and among eight Zulu sheep populations using 26 microsatellite markers. In addition, Damara, Dorper and South African Merino breeds were included to assess the genetic relationship between these breeds and the Zulu sheep. The results showed that there is considerable genetic diversity among the Zulu sheep populations (expected heterozygosity ranging from 0.57 to 0.69) and the level of inbreeding was not remarkable. The structure analysis results revealed that Makhathini Research Station and UNIZULU research station share common genetic structure, while three populations (Nongoma, Ulundi and Nquthu) had some admixture with the exotic Dorper breed. Thus, there is a need for sustainable breeding and conservation programmes to control the gene flow, in order to stop possible genetic dilution of the Zulu sheep.

There is insufficient information on the genetic diversity of the Zulu sheep populations in the different area of KwaZulu Natal where they are reared. The study investigated genetic variation and genetic structure within and among eight Zulu sheep populations using 26 microsatellite markers. In addition, Damara, Dorper and South African Merino breeds were included to assess the genetic relationship between these breeds and the Zulu sheep. The results showed that there is considerable genetic diversity among the Zulu sheep populations (expected heterozygosity ranging from 0.57 to 0.69) and the level of inbreeding was not remarkable. The structure analysis results revealed that Makhathini Research Station and UNIZULU research station share common genetic structure, while three populations (Nongoma, Ulundi and Nquthu) had some admixture with the exotic Dorper breed. Thus, there is a need for sustainable breeding and conservation programmes to control the gene flow, in order to stop possible genetic dilution of the Zulu sheep.\n\nBetween the Lines: Gender in the Reception of Texts by School Children in Rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBalfour, Robert\n\n2003-01-01\n\nExplores the interface between literature, gender, culture, and language within an educational context.

A survey of the autopsy service provided by district surgeons in Kwazulu-Natal.\n\nPubMed\n\nDada, M A; Clarke, J E\n\n2000-01-01\n\nTo provide information on the overall quality of the autopsy service provided by district surgeons in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and in particular to identify factors which may have a negative impact on the judicial process. Confidential questionnaires were sent to 73 district surgeons and 216 legal practitioners including prosecution advocates, regional court prosecutors, defence advocates and attorneys. One hundred and twenty (43%) replies (47 doctors and 73 lawyers) were suitable for analysis. District surgeons have no shortage of experience or maturity but their performance is hampered by the following: lack of appropriate training in forensic pathology; high case load; inadequate facilities and support staff; and lack of access to ancillary services. This study has shown that the standard of autopsy services by district surgeons varies considerably. Overall, there is evidence that inadequacies on the part of district surgeons have negative repercussions for the criminal justice system. Urgent attention should be given to implement training programmes for the district surgeons and to improve service conditions.\n\nSouth Africa: Durban's ante-natal clinic environment and its impact on a woman's choice to test for HIV during pregnancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nGroves, Allison K; Eyakuze, Cynthia\n\n2010-10-01\n\nInformed consent, counselling and confidentiality are key tenets of a human rights approach to HIV testing. In this article, based on an oral poster presentation at AIDS 2010, Allison K. Groves and Cynthia Eyakuze discuss the results of a study on HIV testing of women in ante-natal clinics in Durban, South Africa and how communication about testing may undermine the practice of obtaining informed consent.\n\nAreca nut and tobacco chewing habits in Durban, KwaZulu Natal.\n\nPubMed\n\nBissessur, S; Naidoo, S\n\n2009-11-01\n\nAreca nut/quid chewing is a habit that is commonly practiced in the Indian subcontinent and this age-old social habit is still being practiced by the Indians in South Africa. The areca nut/quid is prepared in a variety of ways. The quid may be prepared with or without tobacco. This habit is said to be associated with the development of oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), a premalignant lesion, oral leukoplakia and oral cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of areca nut/quid chewing (with or without tobacco), associated habits (smoking and alcohol consumption) as well as the awareness of the risks. The study was cross-sectional in design and used administered questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to collect the data. A convenience sample of 101 respondents was interviewed. More than three quarter were born in South Africa and the rest were migrant communities from Pakistan, India and Dubai. All respondents from the migrant community were males. Slightly more females than maleschewed areca nut/quid. Popular ingredients that were chewed included areca nut, betel leaf, lime and paan masala. Enjoyment and special functions were the most important reasons for chewing areca nut. Family influence was a reason for chewing. Nearly 60% did not know whether areca nut chewing is harmful to their health. The majority have not attempted to give up the habit. It is recommended that aggressive awareness programmes on the hazardous effects of areca nut/quid chewing be developed similar to those for smoking cessation. Government health warnings need to be written on paan packaging. Taxes need to be imposed on the areca nut and condiments. Age restrictions need to be imposed on purchasing of the areca nut/quid thus making access difficult for the children.\n\nElemental distribution in seaweed, Gelidium abbottiorum along the KwaZulu-Natal Coastline, South Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nMisheer, Natasha; Kindness, Andrew; Jonnalagadda, Sreekanth B\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe total concentrations of 7 selected metals, namely manganese, iron, zinc, titanium, boron, arsenic and mercury, were monitored for one annual cycle covering four seasons in the seaweed, Gelidium abbottiorum, at four sampling sites at Zinkwasi, Ballito, Treasure beach and Park Rynie along the South-East coastline of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to assess the current status of the marine environment. Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrophotometry, Mercury Cold Vapour AAS, and Hydride Generation AAS were used for the determination of metal concentrations. Mn concentrations were particularly high in the G. abbottiorum species, followed by Fe, As and B concentrations which were in the 3-8 ppm range. Ti and Zn were in the 100-400 ppb range, while Hg was low and below 100 ppb. A typical sample of G. abbottiorum at Treasure beach, a site close to Durban metropolis in winter had Mn (8.6 ppm), Fe (4.6 ppm), As (5.6 ppm), B (3.0 ppm), Ti (420 ppb), Zn (167 ppb) and Hg (7.5 ppb). All metals recorded a decrease in concentrations from winter to spring with the exception of Hg. The Hg levels increased considerably from winter to spring.\n\nHIV/AIDS, growth and poverty in KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa: an integrated survey, demographic and economy-wide analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground This paper estimates the economic impact of HIV/AIDS on the KwaZulu-Natal province and the rest of South Africa. Methods We extended previous studies by employing: an integrated analytical framework that combined firm surveys of workers' HIV prevalence by sector and occupation; a demographic model that produced both population and workforce projections; and a regionalized economy-wide model linked to a survey-based micro-simulation module. This framework permits a full macro-microeconomic assessment. Results Results indicate that HIV/AIDS greatly reduces annual economic growth, mainly by lowering the long-run rate of technical change. However, impacts on income poverty are small, and inequality is reduced by HIV/AIDS. This is because high unemployment among low-income households minimises the economic costs of increased mortality. By contrast, slower economic growth hurts higher income households despite lower HIV prevalence. Conclusion We conclude that the increase in economic growth that results from addressing HIV/AIDS is sufficient to offset the population pressure placed on income poverty. Moreover, incentives to mitigate HIV/AIDS lie not only with poorer infected households, but also with uninfected higher income households. Our findings reveal the substantial burden that HIV/AIDS places on future economic development in KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa, and confirms the need for policies to curb the economic costs of the pandemic.

Across 16 clinics, 1,890 HIV+ patients on ART completed a risk-focused audio computer-assisted self-interview upon enrolling in a prevention-with-positives intervention trial. Results demonstrated that 62 % of HIV-positive patients' recent unprotected sexual acts involved HIV-negative or HIV status unknown partners. For HIV-positive women, multivariable correlates of unprotected sex with HIV-negative or HIV status unknown partners were indicative of poor HIV prevention-related information and of sexual partnership-associated behavioral skills barriers. For HIV-positive men, multivariable correlates represented motivational barriers, characterized by negative condom attitudes and the experience of depressive symptomatology, as well as possible underlying information deficits. Findings suggest that interventions addressing gender-specific and culturally-relevant information, motivation, and behavioral skills barriers could help reduce HIV transmission risk behavior among HIV-positive South Africans.\n\nSeaweeds along KwaZulu-Natal coast of South Africa-3: elemental uptake by Ulva lactuca (Sea lettuce).\n\nPubMed\n\nMisheer, Natasha; Kindness, A; Jonnalagadda, S B\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe elemental uptake by Ulva lactuca (Sea lettuce), a marine macro-algae (chlorophyta, green alga) grown richly along KwaZulu-Natal coastline. The total elemental concentrations of seven important elements, namely manganese, iron, arsenic, boron, titanium, zinc and mercury, selected based on their abundance in U. lactuca were investigated for one year cycle (June 2002 to May 2003). The four selected sampling sites, Zinkwasi, Ballito, Treasure Beach and Park Ryrie are spread over 150 km wide along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline from North to South. The Ulva lectuca possess good manganese and arsenic accumulating ability and an excellent bio-indicator for most of the metals studied. A typical U. lectuca sample at Zinkwasi (in winter) recorded Mn (25.3 +/- 1.16 ppm), Fe (21.0 +/- 0.85 ppm), As (6.2 +/- 0.30 ppm), B (935 +/- 14 ppb), Ti (863 +/- 34 ppb), Zn (421 +/- 21 ppb), and Hg (61.3 +/- 1.2 ppb). The general trend found at all sites was high elemental concentrations in winter and a decrease in concentrations from winter to spring and summer. Iron uptake was lowest in summer and autumn at all sites. Ulva lactuca recorded highest mercury levels (>400 ppb) during the spring season at the Treasure Beach site near Durban.\n\nYoung Peopleâs Sexual Partnerships in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa: Patterns, Contextual Influences, and HIV Risk\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHarrison, Abigail; Cleland, John; Frohlich, Janet\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCertain sexual partnering practices, such as multiple, concurrent or age-discrepant partnerships, are known to increase HIV risk. Yet the underlying dynamics of young peopleâs relationships are less understood. Using household survey and qualitative data, this study examines the partnership context of HIV risk, including partner types, their characteristics, and key aspects of partnership dynamics, including partner numbers and age differences, duration, concurrency, and frequency of contact among youth aged 15â24 in rural KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa. One-third of men reported multiple and/or concurrent partnering, while one-quarter of women had partners > 5 years older. Non-participation in civic organizations or schooling was correlated with higher risk partnerships for women, but not men. On average, relationships lasted >1 year for women and men, and were frequently characterized as âseriousâ. However, qualitative findings pointed to the sequential and overlapping nature of relationships, with distance and mobility as important influences. These fluid partnership patterns are an important feature of young peopleâs sexual risk in the context of South Africaâs severe HIV epidemic.

However, webcams can also be a useful tool in assessing changes in coastal morphology and coastal processes. This information can be used by managers to assist in planning. A number of fixed-position beach webcams are freely available to the South African public via various tourism, surfing, weather and aviation websites, individual clubs and a cell-phone network provider. The advantages of these public networks are that the information is free and as the webcams are fixed, afford a consistent and comparable view of the beach. The disadvantage is that you are at the mercy of the provider: resolution is generally poor, downtime and communication are out of your control, and you have no influence over the positioning of the webcam or the discontinuity of service. Notwithstanding the above, the existing webcams can still provide valuable information. From the network of beach webcams available in South Africa we analyse imagery from three beach webcams located in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, at Umhlanga, Margate beach and lagoon, and Amanzimtoti beach and lagoon to examine the coastal dynamics. From these case studies we illustrate seasonal beach rotation and lagoon mouth dynamics, specifically why outlets migrate southwards in opposition to regional longshore drift.\n\nMale circumcision for HIV prevention: female risk compensatory behaviour in South Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nGreevy, Clare; King, Rebecca; Haffejee, Firoza\n\n2018-05-20\n\nSouth Africa promotes male circumcision (MC) as an HIV prevention method and implemented a national plan to scale-up MC in the country from 2012 to 2016. Literature has suggested that female risk compensatory behaviours (RCBs) are occurring in countries where these programmes have been implemented. Behaviours such as decreased condom use, concurrent sexual partners and sexual activity during the circumcision wound-healing period have the potential to jeopardise the campaigns' objectives. Literature has shown that directly providing women with MC information results in correct knowledge however, previous studies have not directly sought women's views and ideas on engagement with the information. This study aims to identify and explore female RCBs in relation to MC campaigns in South Africa, and to identify interventions that would result in greater female involvement in the campaigns. Snowball sampling was used to conduct twelve qualitative vignette-facilitated semi-structured interviews with women residing in a municipal housing estate in Durban, Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa. Interviews were audio-recorded, verbatim transcribed and analysed using framework analysis. MC knowledge and understanding varied, with some participants mistaking MC as direct HIV protection for females. Despite a lack in knowledge, the majority of women did not report signs of RCBs. Even with a lack of evidence of RCBs, misinterpretation of the MC protective effect has the potential to lead to RCBs; a concept acknowledged in the literature. Several women expressed that MC campaigns are directed to males only and expressed a keenness to be more involved. Suggested interventions include couple counselling and female information sessions in community clinics. Exploring women's attitude towards involvement in MC campaigns fills in a research knowledge gap that is important to international health, as women have a vital role to play in reducing the transmission of HIV.\n\nRedescription of Potamonautes sidneyi (Rathbun, 1904) (Decapoda, Potamonautidae) and description of a new congeneric species from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPeer, Nasreen; Gouws, Gavin; Lazo-Wasem, Eric; Perissinotto, Renzo; Miranda, Nelson A.F.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract A new species of freshwater crab, Potamonautes danielsi sp. n., is described from the southern region of the KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Potamonautes danielsi most closely resembles Potamonautes sidneyi which is re-described here, but can be distinguished by a suite of key morphological characters including carapace shape and width, slim pereopods, inflated propodi of the chelipeds, and the shape and terminal segment length:subterminal segment length ratio of the 1st gonopod. In a previous study (Gouws et al. 2015), a 9.2â11.8 % divergence was found in the mitochondrial COI and 16S genes of the Potamonautes sidneyi clade, allowing for the delineation of a new species. Despite the clear molecular distinction between the two species, it is difficult to separate them based on individual morphological characters, as there is a great deal of overlap even among key features. The new species is found in slow-moving mountain streams and pools at high altitudes between Umhlanga and Mtamvuna, in KwaZulu-Natal.

Nevertheless, few LMIC studies have examined individuals with psychosis in non-urban, non-hospital settings. Using the perspective of formal and informal community service providers, we aimed to uncover descriptions of people with psychosis in a rural South African community and illuminate the potential complexities of their help-seeking journeys. We conducted a qualitative study of 40 key informant interviews and seven focus groups with stakeholders (traditional leaders, traditional healers, religious leaders, health care nurses, heads of non-governmental organizations, schoolteachers, community caregivers) in a rural Zulu community (Vulindlela). Thematic analysis of the data was performed using the inductive analysis approach. Interviewees discussed 32 individuals with probable psychosis in their community and provided rich descriptions of their symptoms. A complex picture of help-seeking behavior, primarily involving informal mental health service providers, emerged. Over half of the reported cases had no contact with formal health services in the course of their help-seeking journey; while more than two-thirds never attended a hospital and only 1 in 8 accessed a psychiatric hospital. Our results highlight the important role of informal care providers in LMICs as well as the need for more research on mental illness and local providers in non-hospital contexts. Community stakeholders can contribute to a fuller understanding of these issues, thereby assisting in the creation of appropriate and effective mental health interventions for rural South African communities like Vulindlela.\n\nGambling participation and problem gambling severity among rural and peri-urban poor South African adults in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nPubMed\n\nDellis, Andrew; Spurrett, David; Hofmeyr, Andre; Sharp, Carla; Ross, Don\n\n2013-09-01\n\nPoor South Africans are significantly poorer and have lower employment rates than the subjects of most published research on gambling prevalence and problem gambling. Some existing work suggests relationships between gambling activity (including severity of risk for problem gambling), income, employment status and casino proximity. The objective of the study reported here is to establish the prevalence of gambling, including at risk and pathological gambling, and the profile of gambling activities in two samples of poor South African adults living in a rural and a peri-urban community. A total of 300 (150 male, 150 female) adults in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa in communities selected using census data, completed the Problem Gambling Severity Index and a survey of socioeconomic and household information, and of gambling knowledge and activity. It was found that gambling was common, and-except for lottery participation-mostly informal or unlicensed. Significant differences between rural and peri-urban populations were found. Peri-urban subjects were slightly less poor, and gambled more and on a different and wider range of activities. Problem and at risk gamblers were disproportionately represented among the more urbanised. Casino proximity appeared largely irrelevant to gambling activity.\n\nExperiences of families caring for an HIV-infected child in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: an exploratory study.\n\nPubMed\n\nDemmer, Craig\n\n2011-07-01\n\nIn South Africa, 2.5% of children are living with HIV. KwaZulu-Natal is the province most affected by the epidemic and has the highest number of pregnant women living with HIV. This study reports on a qualitative study to assess the views and experiences of those involved in caring for a child with HIV/AIDS. In-depth interviews were conducted in KwaZulu-Natal with 13 women who were the primary caregivers of a child with HIV/AIDS and 12 key informants who worked with children and families living with HIV/AIDS. The combination of widespread poverty and HIV-related stigma was perceived to compromise the health of a child with HIV/AIDS. Caregivers' primary focus was on economic survival and there was little income to meet basic human needs including the child's. Stigmatizing attitudes caused some caregivers to keep their child's sickness a secret and symptoms were sometimes ignored or treatment delayed. Little material and emotional support was available to caregivers who were overwhelmed by multiple stresses in this context. Support group interventions for caregivers of children with HIV/AIDS can be a useful resource provided that they jointly address the economic and psychological needs of caregivers. A stronger commitment at the national level to reduce poverty and HIV-related stigma is needed to strengthen the capacity of families who are caring for children with HIV/AIDS.\n\nHIV Stigma and Unprotected Sex among PLWH in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: A Longitudinal Exploration of Mediating Mechanisms\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEarnshaw, Valerie A.; Smith, Laramie R.; Shuper, Paul A.; Fisher, William A.; Cornman, Deborah H.; Fisher, Jeffrey D.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSocial and structural factors including HIV stigma are theorized to drive global disparities in HIV prevalence. This study tests whether HIV self-stigma, or experiences of stigma at the individual level, is associated with engagement in unprotected sex among PLWH in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where 37.4% of adults are living with HIV compared with 0.8% worldwide. It further explores whether depressive symptoms, HIV status disclosure to sex partners, and/or condom use attitudes mediate potential associations between HIV self-stigma and unprotected sex. Participants, including 924 PLWH, were recruited from primary care clinics and completed baseline, 6-, 12-, and 18- month survey assessments between 2008 and 2011. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses were used to examine longitudinal within-subjects associations between HIV self-stigma, mediators, and unprotected sex with both HIV-negative/unknown and HIV-positive partners. Results demonstrate that HIV self-stigma was prospectively associated with greater likelihood of unprotected sex with HIV-negative/unknown partners. None of the variables explored significantly mediated this association. HIV self-stigma was also prospectively associated with greater likelihood of unprotected sex with HIV-positive partners via the mediators of greater depressive symptoms and more negative condom use attitudes. The current study suggests that HIV self-stigma undermines HIV secondary prevention and care efforts among PLWH in KwaZulu-Natal. It is therefore critical to address HIV stigma at the social/structural level to reduce HIV self-stigma at the individual level and ultimately curb global disparities in HIV prevalence. In the absence of widespread social/structural change, interventions that treat depressive symptoms and encourage more positive condom use attitudes despite the existence of HIV stigma may buffer associations between HIV self-stigma and unprotected sex with HIV-positive partners among PLWH in KwaZulu-Natal. PMID\n\nImproving public health information: a data quality intervention in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nMphatswe, W; Mate, K S; Bennett, B; Ngidi, H; Reddy, J; Barker, P M; Rollins, N\n\n2012-03-01\n\nTo evaluate the effect of an intervention to improve the quality of data used to monitor the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of the human immunodeficiency virus in South Africa. The study involved 58 antenatal clinics and 20 delivery wards (37 urban, 21 rural and 20 semi-urban) in KwaZulu-Natal province that provided PMTCT services and reported data to the District Health Information System. The data improvement intervention, which was implemented between May 2008 and March 2009, involved training on data collection and feedback for health information personnel and programme managers, monthly data reviews and data audits at health-care facilities. Data on six data elements used to monitor PMTCT services and recorded in the information system were compared with source data from health facility registers before, during and after the intervention. Data completeness (i.e. their presence in the system) and accuracy (i.e. being within 10% of their true value) were evaluated. The level of data completeness increased from 26% before to 64% after the intervention. Similarly, the proportion of data in the information system considered accurate increased from 37% to 65% (P < 0.0001). Moreover, the correlation between data in the information system and those from facility registers rose from 0.54 to 0.92. A simple, practical data improvement intervention significantly increased the completeness and accuracy of the data used to monitor PMTCT services in South Africa.\n\nGatekeeping and its impact on father involvement among Black South Africans in rural KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nPubMed\n\nMakusha, Tawanda; Richter, Linda\n\n2016-01-01\n\nInvolved and caring fatherhood contributes to the health and wellbeing of children, women and men. The corollary is also true - men, women and children are affected when fathers are not involved or supportive of their children. Many factors affect fathers' involvement, including women's attitudes, the history and nature of the relationship between mother and father, and the cultural context. This study explores gatekeeping and its impact on father involvement among Black South Africans in rural KwaZulu-Natal. Among married couples, gatekeeping occurs with respect to childcare and housework through women's attempts to validate their maternal identity according to socially and culturally constructed gender roles. Among unmarried, non-resident parents, women control father-child contact and involvement, with mothers and/or their families either facilitating or inhibiting father involvement. In this context, we found that cultural gatekeeping had a huge impact on father involvement, with the non-payment of inhlawulo or lobola regulating father-child involvement. In a country like South Africa, where there is high non-marital fertility and father-child non-residence, future research, parenting and family programmes should focus on strategies that encourage positive paternal involvement as well as maternal and cultural support for father involvement, regardless of parental relationship and residence status.\n\nImproved rates of exclusive breastfeeding at 14Â weeks of age in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa: what are the challenges now?\n\nPubMed\n\nHorwood, C; Haskins, L; Engebretsen, I M; Phakathi, S; Connolly, C; Coutsoudis, A; Spies, L\n\n2018-06-19\n\nIncreasing the rate of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) to 50% in the first six months of life is one of six major global targets set by the United Nations Decade of Nutrition, and is essential to achieve the sustainable development goals to eradicate hunger and end malnutrition by 2030. A survey using multistage random sampling design included 99 primary health care (PHC) clinics in all 11 districts in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). All mothers and caregivers of infants 14Â weeks of age attending the clinics in the study period were requested to participate in a structured interview to explore feeding practices since birth. As non-maternal caregivers may not have detailed knowledge of feeding practices, they provided limited information about current feeding practices. Respondents who consistently reported giving no other food or fluids except breastmilk since birth were classified as practising exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), and those who were currently breastfeeding but had given other food or fluids since birth were categorised as practising mixed breastfeeding (MBF). A total of 4172 interviews were conducted with mothers and caregivers of 14Â week old infants. Among mothers 49.8% were EBF, 23.1% were MBF and 27.0% were not breastfeeding. Among non-maternal caregivers 11.8% reported EBF, 23.4% MBF and 62.3% were not giving breastmilk. Higher education (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.8) and being in the highest socio-economic tertile (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9) were risk factors for not practising EBF, while returning to work (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.3) or school (OR 0.2 95% CI, 0.1-0.3) was associated with less EBF. HIV-positive mothers were more likely to have never started breastfeeding (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.7-4.8). However, they were similar in having stopped breastfeeding by 14Â weeks (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.9-1.4) compared to HIV-negative mothers, and, they had similar rates of EBF at 14Â weeks of age (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.9-1.3). Estimates of breastfeeding practices at 14Â weeks in KZN are higher\n\nAntiretroviral treatment and the health workforce in South Africa: how have ART workers been affected by scaling up?\n\nPubMed\n\nTobi, Patrick; George, Gavin; Schmidt, Elena; Renton, Adrian\n\n2008-12-01\n\nTo investigate the effect of scaling up antiretroviral treatment (ART) on the working environment and motivation of health workers in South Africa; and to suggest strategies to minimize negative effects and maximise positive effects. Exploratory interviews with health managers and senior clinical staff were used to identify locally relevant work environment indicators. A self-reported Likert scale questionnaire was administered to a randomly selected cohort of 269 health professionals at health facilities in KwaZulu Natal and Western Cape provinces of South Africa that included ART delivery sites. The cohort was disaggregated into ART and non-ART groups and differences between the two compared with Fisher's exact test and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test. The ART sub-cohort reported: (i) a lighter workload (P = 0.013), (ii) higher level of staffing (P = 0.010), (iii) lower sickness absence (P = 0.032), (iv) higher overall job satisfaction (P = 0.010), (v) poorer physical state of their work premises (P = 0.003), and (vi) higher staff turnover (P = 0.036). Conclusion Scale-up affects the work environment in ways that influence workers' motivation both positively and negatively. A net negative balance is likely to drive staff out-migration, undermine the quality of care and compromise the capacity of the programme to achieve significant scale.
