        "text": "In issue 44 of The Cultured Traveller, shaped by generations of Maharanas, Joseph Mortimer finds moments of calm in captivating UDAIPUR to uncover the unique character of the Rajasthani city that wears its history on its sleeve. First time contributor, Imad Yassin, digitally disconnects and takes time out at a SILENT RETREAT on Bali; Samantha Henderson visits the ISLAND OF HAWAI’I – home to some of the most active volcanoes on the planet. And not one to travel light, iconic British fashion and textile designer, ZANDRA RHODES, reveals how she criss-crosses the globe in such effortless style. From a tented Himalayan lodge on the banks of the Mo Chu River in Bhutan’s Punakha Valley, to a Californian inn which has been welcoming guests since the 1880s, The Cultured Traveller team checks out a dozen new hotels that each offers a culture-rich stay. And lapped by the Gulf of Thailand’s warm waters, Nicholas Chrisostomou hops around a cluster of lush, unspoilt islands off Cambodia's south coast."
