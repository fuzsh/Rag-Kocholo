And by we, I mean that I picked it, and Sai gamely went along. For some reason, she trusted me with the planning for this trip. That was her mistake, and likely the last time she would make that mistake again. Prepare yourself for a lengthy report of this two week vacation. You might learn something new, seeing as I learned a lot, but be warned, I have a tendency to take facts and screw them up.\n\nI came to Africa to bag a big one. But unlike a rich Minnesotan dentist, I didn’t plan to butcher a beloved lion (my mother would roll over in her grave, and my Buddhist wife would karmically curse me in my next life, or give me hell in this one). Instead, my trophy would (hopefully) be a finishers medal from Comrades, the 56 mile +/- footrace featuring a field capped at 20,000 people, who I assume like me would rather hurt themselves than an innocent lion. The stated goal for this trip was to run the Comrades Marathon. However, that was just one part of the package. We planned to do as much as we could in our two weeks. Starting with a flight from DC on May 20th, we’d arrive in Johannesburg on May 21st, I’d run the race from Pietermaritzburg to Durban on May 29th, and we’d fly back from Cape Town on June 4th, arriving back in DC on June 5th, with in-between stops to safari, sight-see, wine and dine, and whatever else I could come up with, though Sai nixed my suggestion for her to go swimming with the sharks (chicken).\n\nThis is my running diary from our trip. But it’s not just about running. And hopefully it won’t have much about diarrhea, though my verbosity may be diagnosed as diarrhea of the pen (or printer). There will be a fair number of footnotes, and probably a note or two about my feet (may God have mercy on their soles). And plenty of bad puns. Enjoy or ignore.\n\nComrades\n\nComrades is the oldest and largest ultramarathon in the world. It runs through the Valley of a Thousand Hills, though the website didn’t warn me that there would be that many when I signed up for it last fall. It goes between Pietermaritzburg and Durban, alternating directions each year, with 2016 being a “down” run to the Durban destination. Of the 20,000 entrants, we’ll see how many actually start, and how many of us hopefully finish. It’s Vic Clapham’s fault, as he founded the race to commemorate fallen brothers in arms after the first World War, with the first running in 1921, continuing every year since except for a hiatus during World War II[1]. I figured 2016 was a good chance for me to try my hand and feet at it, since there’s a scary possibility that crazy Donald may soon come to power and inadvertently (or advertently?) start WWIII, impacting future runnings.\n\nDrugs\n\nTo begin, we needed vaccinations for typhoid and malaria pills (we are both current on Hepatitis vaccinations, and we weren’t entering any yellow fever areas). I worried a bit about typhoid, as some symptoms include lethargy, poor appetite, headache, generalized aches and pains, fever, diarrhea, chest congestion and abdominal pain. Most of my ultramarathons have led to most of those symptoms, so how would I know if the vaccination worked? Likewise, malaria symptoms can include fever, chills, headache, sweats, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dry cough, muscle or back pain (or both), and an enlarged spleen. Again, (except for the spleen part), these all sound like running induced ailments. So, by the end of this trip, I may be carrying typhoid and malaria, or I may just be a wimp from my run. Either way, you should probably keep your distance.\n\nI didn’t think the typhoid shot or malaria pills were enough, so prior to the trip, I found a bunch of additional drugs to take. My chest cold and cough did not respond to the first course of antibiotics, so the doctor gave me cough medicine, stronger antibiotics, and steroids, so I could really be ready to run! Before you flag my race report with an asterisk, know this: cheaters never win (except for Lance, and he only won seven times), and I’ll spare you the suspense, I didn’t win, nor did I cheat, which doesn’t seem right either.\n\nNow for more medical jargon than you’d ever care to know: Prednisone (my prescribed juice) is a glucocorticosteroid on the banned “in competition” list. This means that you cannot take it from 12 hours before the start through the end of the competition. According to the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency), its appearance on the prohibited list is “more due to dangerous side effects than performance enhancing effects.” Large doses increase cardiac output, cause mood elevation, euphoria, and increased motor activity. Personally, I think this sounds great. I recommend Prednisone to everyone. It’s like ecstasy, but to treat bronchitis. Oh, those side effects: hyperglycemia, reduced bone density, adrenal insufficiency, weight gain, muscle breakdown and anovulation (menstrual irregularities). Since I was trying to get healthy enough to run 55+ miles, I wasn’t too worried about the weight gain, I knew I’d experience plenty of muscle breakdown anyway, and I leave the ovulating to Sai. The other side effects, well, I guess I’d have to roll the dice.\n\nAnd there are always Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs), but a little info on that front: The application should be filed at least 30 days before the event (and I hadn’t planned to get sick that far in advance). In exceptional cases, TUEs may be approved retroactively, but apparently if you are not very competitive, no one really cares what you take. So while I thought it might be cool to join the ranks of Salazar’s athletes, I’m not ranked, and WADA has better things to worry about.[2]\n\nSo my Prednisone prescription was scaled to run out by 5/25, with the run out of Pietermarizburg scheduled on 5/29. This meant that I would be without the benefit of a bigger heart and better mood on race morning, but I would be compliant with the official drug policies. Alternatively, what if I saved up and popped the magic pills like S-caps or Swedish fish during the run, attaining euphoria and racing like a Russian, just hoping that my heart doesn’t explode?![3]\n\nSome eerie similarities to blow your mind (coincidence – you bet!) before this report really gets started. In 1922, Sir Arthur Newton[4] at the age of 39 ran his first Comrades. He managed to edge out 88 people. Arthur Newton has 12 letters. So does Ben Apfelbaum. Guess how old I am, heading into my first Comrades? Now if I can manage to beat 88 people, maybe I’ll end up a Comrades legend still regaled 94 years from now. Okay, Sir Arthur won his race, and while I trust I’ll beat the same number of competitors, I also expect several thousand to finish in front of me. Newton went on to win the race four more times, running considerably faster over a tougher course (predating paved roads, crowd support and aid stations). Another interesting fact – Newtie (I feel like I know him well enough now to call him that) ran his first race as a form of protest against some unfair taxes on his farm (or something)[5]; imagine if Teabaggers Tea Party people followed this same strategy – Paul Ryan might really run his 3 hour marathon![6]\n\nDay 0 – Friday, May 20th – Pre-Flight Jitters\n\nMy recent track record of visiting foreign places during times of turmoil (Paris attacks of 2015; Thailand civil unrest of 2012; Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006) and sparse details on a plane crash the day before we left (ISIS / ISIL?), had me a little nervous boarding our Friday flight. I was hoping for a trouble-free trip, with no global dramas playing out around us. This way, Sai and I could just focus on our own spousal melodramas instead of wartime correspondence.\n\nWe flew from Dulles at 5:40 p.m. on Friday, landing in Dakar at 1 a.m. (still Eastern Time – I didn’t adjust to local yet). What country is Dakar in? Surely I’m not the only one that didn’t know it was the capital of Senegal. It’s the westernmost edge of the African mainland, and a refueling / re-cleaning point for South African Air to keep us on the plane for an extra hour and half on its “direct” flight to Johannesburg. Leg #2 would get us the rest of the way there, another eight hours later. During the flight, I endured a couple of coughing fits, which meant I was counting down eight days to race, and still not breathing well… It also meant I didn’t sleep well. But Sai didn’t sleep well first, so I couldn’t expect to get a good night’s rest without her sonorous snores, my very own yellow noise machine.\n\nDay 1 – Saturday, May 21st – Jo Hell No!\n\nJohannesburg, Jo’Burg, Jozi, or Just-Don’t-Go-burg. Everyone warned us to be wary because it’s a scary place. Even Fodor (my other main source for planning information) fills its sales pitch with daunting cautions, such as highlighting a beautiful new bridge before telling readers not to cross it or you’ll get mugged. Thrice I was told by people who’d been that we should get the hell out as quickly as possible. Sai’s co-worker, who is from South Africa, reiterated this advice.\n\nSo, if you’re reading this presently, either I made it back and typed up my report and Jozi is not that bad (I’m anticipating a cross between Baltimore and Baghdad), or my chicken-scratch scribbles have been preserved posthumously by the predator who took my life and travel journal, in which case, I won’t be recommending Jo-Crazy-For-Going-There-Burg to any of my friends, but I do at least somewhat appreciate the murdering thug’s respect for my writing. Either way, after that ridiculously long run-on sentence (don’t worry, that won’t be the worst), many of you are likely cursing Jo’Burg’s bogeyman for not terminating the effort before it affronted your eyes. Sorry for your suffering.\n\nAfter over 16 hours of plane time, we arrived at O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, where we were greeted by the Iron Maiden world tour jet on the adjacent tarmac! Who knew those guys were still touring, let alone coming or going through South Africa? Not that it mattered. I was never a fan, and surely Sai is not interested in seeing a cheesy 80s hair band that probably doesn’t have much hair left anyway. Now if it was the GNR tour, I might have started our first fight. Then again, Run To The Hills would be a hell of a theme song for Comrades…\n\nWe picked up our rental car, I nearly sideswiped quite a few cars on the highway, and before I struck another vehicle, something struck me: WTF am I doing driving on the wrong (right-hand) side of the car on the wrong (left) side of the road, with a wife screaming at me to get over into the correct lane, when said wife Sai learned to drive backwards herself in Bangkok? Let me just tell you now, if Sai had only done all the driving, so many of the fights that follow in this report may have been averted. But she’d rather just yell at me from the passenger seat, so it’s her fault that we fought every time we went anywhere on wheels.\n\nWe eventually made it to our gated hotel in Rosebank (a nice Jo’Burg suburb), where despite the waning stress from the scary drive across town, I felt safe enough to leave our locked car. We crossed the street to the closed Rosebank Mall (surprising that the shops close at six on a Saturday night, but I prefer window shopping to watching the woman go nuts inside the stores). Don’t worry, Sai should have time to shop before the end of the trip, assuming survival of Johannesburg. We grabbed a simple dinner and called it an early night. Besides the tough drive, the only other threat was a prolonged coughing fit before dinner. Seven days to get healthy…\n\nDay 2 – Sunday, May 22nd – Jozi and the Fraidy Cats\n\nJo’Burg, for real this time. The airport to highway to the cushy suburb hardly qualifies. Today, we hopped a single stop on the GauTrain to Park Station where we boarded the hop-on, hop-off city tour bus to take us around without the risk of my driving. The GauTrain is spotless and efficient, though infrequent, with trains 30 minutes apart. The double-decker bus brought us through the heart of the city and gave a lot of information, some of which I’ll try to summarize for you now; just know I work from memory, so facts are fluid. Read Wikipedia, Fodor’s, or anything you can find for a more reliable source. But if you’re too lazy, you’ve been warned twice already. So, with caveats covered, here goes.\n\nIn 1886, a bunch of Aussies all named George co-discovered gold in this obscure, otherwise worthless location. George Harrison netted the claim, while the other Georges got the proverbial shaft (not the golden one). Mr. Harrison flipped the mining rights for 10 pounds and disappeared, never to be heard from again until he resurfaced as a mop-topped British guitarist 70 years later. Or maybe that last one was a different George Harrison; I guess there could be more than one. Regardless, people flocked to the region like flies to shit or like girls to gold jewelry, and the shanty towns progressed to a big city named Johannesburg, named after one of several Johannes, not sure which. Did you know that Jo’Burg is over a mile high? In your face, Denver. It’s the largest city in the world without any viable reason for being (no lakes, seas, rivers, or ports; water must be channeled in from hundreds of kilometers away). In other words, why would anyone settle here? Oh yeah, because girls (and gangstas) like their gold.\n\nSurrounding the city, yellow hills are the repositories of old mines. They’ve started planting trees and grasses on these embankments, because the dust is toxic (and ugly). These same ugly yellow hills also used to demarcate separation of the city proper from its poorer suburbs during the apartheid era. Don’t worry, I’ll tell you more about that shortly. They are also currently re-mining these same mining dumps because modern technology has enabled them to squeeze a little more money out of the earth.\n\nSo where to now? How about Soweto! We had opted for the Soweto excursion extension tour option, so we hopped off at the Gold Reef Casino, grabbed a quick bite to eat, hit the jackpot at the slots which we planned to use to pay off our muggers, then hopped in a smaller van for the ride to the South West Townships with a personal guide named Spu (as opposed to the headphone recordings from the bus). Spu was short for two tougher names to pronounce, so he produced tougher names for each of us, with mysterious meanings to be given later in the tour.\n\nSoweto was where the Africans were sent to clear out the slums in Johannesburg in 1910, under the thin guise of a public health concern after a plague outbreak. Whereas the poor white workers were allowed to remain in the city, the non-whites were forced out as part of the divide and rule program. According to our guide who has spent his entire life in Soweto, today it welcomes people of all ethnicities. However, during our (admittedly limited) two hour tour, the only white people we saw were our fellow tourists.\n\nSoweto is a series of townships where during apartheid, different races and tribes were kept separated from each other. Many of the areas consisted of very small, single story sorry looking abodes with four bedrooms somehow crammed inside, but no indoor plumbing. On the side of the road, some people were selling plastic tubs which are too tiny for kiddie pools, but apparently they are big enough to act as bath tubs (you bathe sectionally, according to Spu). Between some of the houses, some lean-to sheds or corrugated metal pieces or plastic sheets were erected for additional income, in an early, unheralded version of Air B&B. Hostels, shanties, and tent cities also house immigrants too poor to afford a brick structure. Many are from Lesotho and other poorer African nations, where workers come to stay for a short time in these hovels, save up money, and go back to provide for their families.\n\nWe stopped at the Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum, where we learned about the student uprising from 1976. On June 16th of that year, a bunch of understandably angry youths peacefully protested the inferior educations they were receiving at their racially segregated schools. In response, the local police pulled a Montgomery Burns and released the hounds, against which the students defended themselves, so the cops used lead, shooting dead dozens of kids, including 13 year old Hector Pieterson. This incident gained great notoriety and strengthened the resolve of those fighting against the racist regime, garnering greater support for the oppressed, and became a key turning point in the anti-apartheid movement, which would end with free elections just 18 years later (almost a Hector and a half of lifetimes longer).[7]\n\nBut Soweto wasn’t all depressing, just mostly. We passed a huge stadium, home playing grounds for the Kaizer Chiefs. Like Iron Maiden, I didn’t know they were still around, but I think I still have one of their CDs in a box in my basement. Good for them that they can fill a big arena like that today. The stadium was prominent in South Africa’s 2010 hosting of the World Cup, when vuvuzelas became the most annoying sound since Miley Cyrus (sorry, tried finding a more annoying singer from 2010, but she was the worst I found – please provide a better fill-in here if you can from that period). We saw the former homes of Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu just two blocks apart on the same street, though they never co-existed because Mandela spent those years at Robben Island. If you’re lucky, maybe I’ll tell you about Robben Island when we go to Cape Town (if you’re really curious or impatient, jump to Day 12). Soweto brags that this is the only street on the planet that had two Nobel Peace Prize winners. Last stop was Kliptown, where District 9 was filmed. This was what I expected all of Soweto to look like from the movie, and parts were true to that form, some places were even worse, but most were better. There was a nice new complex in Kliptown with the only 4 star hotel in Soweto, and a monument with carvings from South Africa’s 1955 Freedom Charter, many of which later became part of the Constitution (after free elections). Radical ideas from this Freedom Charter included Equal Rights, Wealth Distribution, Education for All, and Living Wages. Bernie Sanders would pop a boner.\n\nSo our new Soweto / Xhosa / Bantu (or whatever) names were Rolihlahla for me, and Nolufasso (sp?) for Sai. Mine was apparently a nickname given to Mandela as a child, meaning troublemaker. Not sure if being nicknamed after the great Madiba in this case was a compliment though. Sai’s name, while it sounded like he was going after her weight, meant something to the effect of one who keeps things simple. I think our buddy Spu clearly missed the marks on both counts, mine and my drama queen’s.\n\nI thought from my limited research that Apartheid started in 1948 and ended in the early 90’s, thanks to the shame brought on the country by its negative portrayal in Lethal Weapon 2, just as Rocky double-handedly knocked out the USSR in 80’s, and Team America: World Police established Americans as the biggest dicks in the 00’s[8]. But now that I’ve toured the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg, our next mood-killing stop (working against my Prednisone here guys), I know a lot more than before which I’ll proceed to bore you with now, assuming you’re still reading. Come on people, it’s only Day 2! Some SA history, as I understand it…\n\nNative Africans lived like Bushmen, perfectly happy for thousands of years, following eons of evolution (sorry Creationists, not discrediting the bible, just relating “facts” from the phony “fossils” found in Africa). Peaceful Southern African living among the warring tribes was then interrupted when the damn Dutch decided to find warmer climes, followed by the bloody Brits. The European settlers displaced the locals, brought in their own slaves, raided the natural resources, warred with each other and the locals, and completely plagiarized American history (replacing Indians with Africans), except they never tried that whole melting pot concept that we have here in the US, and they weren’t as effective in wiping out the Natives (not enough smallpox blankets I guess).\n\nIn the early 1900s, the Europeans struck a brilliant compromise for their divided country: the white ruling minority would take a measly 92% of the land, while the majority population of Africans would get to share the full 8%! Everyone wins, right? It was practically a unanimously approved decision (easier since only white men had the right to vote). The percentages were adjusted a few points a few years later, but not much. Africans were not enslaved under this measure, they were just forced into subservience. There were also a lot of poor, angry white people, who loved to blame the non-whites (Africans and Indians, mostly) for taking their jobs (insert a South Park “took our jobs” meme here). Next, the opportunistic, elitist whites worked with the poor, angry, redneck racists to form the Nationalist Party in 1948. This twisted government enacted segregation on steroids (and not the good kind) to break families apart. There were dozens of laws implemented to restrict the rights and actions of the majority of South Africans, in a program designed to divide and rule (for fear of unified resistance). It forced non-whites to carry passbooks at all times to show where they were allowed to be and when; if found without a passbook, they’d be arrested[9].\n\nSouth Africa imprisoned, tortured, murdered, massacred many opponents of its awful Apartheid program. Mandela (imprisoned), Biko (tortured, murdered), and little Hector (massacred) were but a few famous examples. Eventually, amidst worldwide pressure from the outside and enough resistance from within (and of course, Danny Glover’s deadpan delivery revoking the bad guy’s diplomatic immunity), the Apartheid era ended, Mandela went from prison to president, Matt Damon won some rugby matches, and everyone lived happily ever after![10]\n\nOne other gold nugget of Johannesburg knowledge – did you know that Gandhi lived here for many years? There’s a downtown Gandhi Square. The little Indian legend got his law degree in England before coming to South Africa to be inspired by his mistreatment as a colored person. A Rosa Parks-like train experience and further injustices motivated the Mahatma to dedicate his life to helping oppressed Indians, first in Johannesburg, before returning to his homeland. Hearing our recorded audio guide seemingly brag about the bullshit abuse of Gandhi as a hometown contributing claim to his fame, it reminded me of an old skit I saw a few years ago. I think it was “The Whitest Kids You Know” or maybe Tosh.O[11], where a guy is talking to a girl who is doing a report on Rosa Parks. He brags to her that his relative was the guy who told her to move to the back of the bus, and was therefore equally important in changing the world!\n\nDay 3 – Monday, May 23rd – Driving Miss Sai\n\nBy now, you’ve probably figured out (if you’re paying attention) that I survived Jo-Not-So-Bad-Burg. I’ll miss Sai though. T.I.A. (This Is Africa); sacrifices have to be made. No, I didn’t abandon my beloved; the thought only crossed my mind every 10 minutes or so on the seven hour drive from Jo’Burg to the Kruger Gate, minus the 40 minutes for our enjoyable lunch along the way. So, 6 hours 20 minutes of driving, with Sai’s backseat driver critiques driving me crazier every 10 minutes or so (on average, she was not that consistent), equates to a long way of saying that I pondered peaceful life without the love of my life only 38 times along the way, give or take. If you’re wondering why she would be critiquing me from the backseat, it could be A) To assert her dominance, like Miss Daisy, or B) To be safely out of arm’s reach, or C) It’s just an expression, and Sai really preferred to sit right next to me, with her screams of “Watch out for that car / truck / bus / person / cow / goat!” piercing right into my unaccustomed left eardrum (it’s usually my right ear aurally assaulted, driving on the right (right) side of the road, with her to my right).\n\nYes, we both survived Johannesburg, and I’ll summarize by saying that it was not as bad as I had feared, but I don’t see a need to revisit, and would likely not be recommending it to others.\n\nOnce outside the City of Gold, highway driving wasn’t bad. My white knuckles loosened after the first hour, and the scenery shifted to an arid landscape for a while, broken up by stretches of farms. Twice, in the distance, nuclear reactors starkly stood out in the skyline. Did you know that parts of South Africa use nuclear power? I now knew something new and so do you (assuming you didn’t already). As we moved farther east, the scene picked up more and more green, more rolling hills, mountains, trees, etc. Good stuff. My job was not to crash, while Sai should have been taking moving pictures; instead, she chose to take pot-shots at me for passing too tightly, not switching lanes fast enough, driving too close to that other vehicle… In other words, take my thousands of words for it (since we lacked many pictures from this stretch), it was very nice. I will admit, there was one legitimate cause for alarm when I tried to squeeze past a slow-moving truck just as the passing lane suddenly ended, with oncoming traffic coming on quickly. Oh yeah, there was also the time I nearly made roadkill out of a flagman. But still, my mission (not to crash) was accomplished.\n\nWe checked into the Protea Hotel Kruger Gate at around 4 p.m. It’s a beautiful hotel just outside the Paul Kruger Gate into the Kruger National Park. Paul Kruger was a leader of the Boers fighting the Brits in the late 1800s, becoming President of South Africa, and namesake for a park, gate, park gate hotel, rand, and many other things I’m sure. Would you rather be leader of Boers, boars, or bores? We were greeted by a bunch of vervet monkeys climbing all over the entry canopy and trees. Check those little buggers off the list of wildlife! I almost feel guilty eating red vervet cupcakes after seeing their source, but I don’t think the species is endangered, so it’s okay. We could have stayed inside the park or at a private game reserve, but Sai trusted me, and I chose this place based on good reviews, great location, nice price, and an on-site fitness center that included a treadmill[12], which better get used to justify this selection (despite co-workers joking about it, I really didn’t want to go for an outdoor run and get hunted by a Big 5 game animal. We’ve already established that I am a pussy). We booked a full day safari for Tuesday, with the plan for me to take some pictures while Sai yells at another driver.\n\nDay 4 – Tuesday, May 24th – 50 Shades of Lion\n\nAt 5:10 a.m. our synchronized alarms woke us, and by 6:10 we were at the Kruger Gate with our Echo Safari tour. After paying the international gate fee (280 Rand per person – ~$19 / each), we were on the lookout for the Big Five by Seven (that is, looking for the Big 5 Animals by 7 a.m., not looking for a big 5×7). For the uninitiated, the Big Five safari animals are Cape Buffalo, Elephant, Rhino, Leopard, and Lion. The moniker came from hunting days, but the term has a nice ring to it, so it stuck, and now that’s the list for everyone to check off whether a tour is successful or not. It’s a bit short-sighted, as there’s so much more to see, but you need to start somewhere. We started out with a giraffe, which isn’t on the list, so it didn’t count and our guide just sped past before we could take pictures of this worthless creature. Just kidding, though shortly afterward, I asked him to stop for some distant mammal. After reversing the vehicle, he said it was just an impala, and a distant one at that, so not worth any effort. Thanks Bud. Way to shoot me down in the first fifteen minutes. Our guide then pointed out a distant rhino. Okay, I admit, his was better than mine. Stupid impala. But I wasn’t done yet. We saw kudus and a crane, countless more impala everywhere, then another rhino, this time crossing the road right in front of us!\n\nCan that be beat? You bet it can! Minutes later, we approached a line of cars aligning themselves to take close-up shots of two lions. The etiquette is to get in, take your pics, and then get out when more people come, so that they get a turn. However, our perfect timing gave us a wide window to watch the two wild cats, who were at this time not feeling so wild. Mr. Lion, whom we’ll call Jaime, sat behind Cersei (sorry, HBO GO would not let us watch the latest Game of Thrones in South Africa, so Sai and I had to improvise). Anyway, the two big, beautiful beasts just lounged with Jaime occasionally looking around at us, thinking “Have I had Thai lately? Or maybe that Indian woman would make a nice snack.” Meanwhile, we continued to snap pictures, expecting to be booted from our prime viewing area at any moment.\n\nCan that be beat? Okay, but just once more. Don’t get greedy. Jaime started to lick Cersei (prudes, be warned, this gets a little graphic). Cersei started to perk up. Jaime licked some more. Cersei crawled a few feet into the street (setting up for the spotlight). Jaime climbed aboard, growled and nibbled, and went to town on her kitty, doggy-style. Maybe thirty seconds later, the big guy was done, and Cersei rolled onto her back and lit a cigarette. Jaime posed majestically for the cameras. I swear it’s true! Except for the smoking part (Cersei’s more of a drinker, not a smoker). I’ve got the whole thing on video, pervy voyeur that I am. Sai’s afraid that I might get fired for having kitty porn on my company phone. According to our guide, Cersei’s rollover afterwards is the lioness’ way of trying to help her lover’s load reach the egg. This wasn’t just sex for sex or for fun or for our personal show or recreational, this was purely procreational, as God intended (except for the whole Lannister incest taboo).\n\nAfter the lion’s mighty showing (I wish my wife was that satisfied after less than a minute’s work), we ventured on to try to intrude on the personal moments of more large mammals without rooms. And before you ask (you greedy bastards), no, the fucking lions cannot be beat! (Words no one from Detroit has ever uttered).\n\nWe drove on, and I espied another giraffe. This time, my vision was not immediately dismissed, and we found a couple more long necks hanging behind the first one. Since they weren’t as close to our open air vehicle and didn’t seem to be setting up for a sex show anytime soon (no foreplay licking), we soon moved on. Wait, Elephant! I hollered out again from the back (there were only five of us plus our driver in the eleven seat safari vehicle; it’s not that I was shouting over a busload or anything. There were only ten other eyes, and Sai’s were probably focused on finding faults in the driver’s driving). Our guide backed up, and we were rewarded with my first African elephant, followed by his wife and two kids. And though they were a bit back off the road at first glance, while we waited, they wandered down and crossed right in front of us (always park at the elephant crossing sign. They’re very disciplined creatures).\n\nAgain, we drove on, and I was feeling emboldened. “Over there! Other side of the stream is a big animal!” I’m not a zoologist, how am I supposed to know what these random, foreign animals are? Hippo – whoever heard of such a thing? We backed up a bit and saw more large creatures taking a drink from this same stream (actually the Sabie River, but unusually low (winter, drought)). Our guide called these buffalo. That’s #4 for the score on Big Five (Rhino, Lion, Elephant, Buffalo – in case you don’t have them down yet), but before I could get photographic proof, we were off again, speeding up the road to investigate a closer big thing. Our fearless driver made a beeline for it, and we had a much closer view of our very own cape buffalo. He was pretty ugly, I thought. He looked pretty angry; perhaps they can read minds? I tried thinking less insulting thoughts about the big, ugly bastard (that’s bub for short – did you know that when someone calls you Bub, they’re really insulting you?). We took close-up pictures of our fourth Big Five species, and in less than 2 hours of looking! And that included humping lions! Who needs a leopard anyway?\n\nWe drove some more, because our determined guide was not as ready to just declare the whole trip a success as I was, and along the way, we saw another group of elephants (what’s the word for a herd of elephants? I believe it’s an RNC), another rhino, a really long snake slithering across the street right in front of us, a hyena, more giraffes, another lion right down the road from our fornicating friends (Lancel sat alone, looking judgmentally at the other two), some cool birds (don’t ask what kind), baboons, an inyala, and for good measure, how about a freaking leopard!\n\nWe followed a line of vehicles across a low, single lane bridge, when our go-to guide shouted out Leopard! The limber cat leapt onto the bridge in front of the car in front of us. We scrambled to our feet to hang out the open sides of our safari ride[13], hoping to steal an image of the stealthy carnivore, but it was quickly over to the other side and back down off the bridge. So close. Our driver was not done yet. He crossed the bridge, u-turned, and returned for an encore, which the well-trained leopard provided! Again, it was a short show, but still satisfying (like a laying lion). Five for Five. By the time we stopped for lunch, I was left wondering what we could possibly get out of the afternoon drive. Sai and I were the only ones in our group to elect to do the full day safari.\n\nAfter we dropped our three along-riders, I asked our personal driver to deliver us some zebras, since I couldn’t think of another big Kruger creature. Half an hour later, we had our first zebra. You never forget your first. To prove it was no fluke, (though I can’t imagine anyone mistaking a zebra for a fluke[14]), ten minutes later, he found us three more!\n\nHe asked if I knew what a pumbaa is. A puma? I didn’t think the big, black cats were a possibility in this park, or the guidebook surely would have mentioned it[15]… “No, Pumbaa – do you know Lion King?” he asked, and pointed out a few scurrying little tusked pigs – oh, warthogs! Later, he would point out Zazu, a colorful, red-billed hornbill in a tree, rounding out the Lion King cast (even though Simba was grown and going by the name of Jaime now; the movie and play downplay Nala being his sister).\n\nOur guide was more than just a great spotter and namer. He also answered lots of questions and told us tons of information without our asking. Some bits I’ve tried to retain:\n\nRhinos are very endangered. Their only predator (once grown) are poachers. Despite the Park’s best efforts, on average a rhino is illegally butchered every day for its valuable horn, and otherwise left to rot on the spot.\n\nAfrican wild dogs are even more endangered than rhinos. There are only approximately 120 left in the preserve. The alpha males and alpha females are not as (re)productive as other species, and unknown diseases are further thinning their population. We didn’t see any, but I am not complaining. We saw more than enough of everything else, and if I wanted to see some diseased, wild dogs, I could go back to Bangkok.\n\nThe lion population is relatively stable at this time, though there have been scares when buffalo get an outbreak of tuberculosis and the big cats feast on the sick capers, contracting TB too, shrinking their numbers. Kruger National Park tries to balance letting nature run its course versus intervening to treat sick animals.\n\nHad enough? Let me just say that the safari is truly an awesome experience. I could write thousands of words (I believe I just did), trying (and failing) to capture the wonder, but instead, I hope that you can share in the hundreds of pictures and handful of videos (some sexual in nature) to get a better appreciation for the experience. But know that seeing it firsthand, in the bush, is worth more than two in the hand… Not sure where I was going with that last one, but you know what I mean. We vowed never again, as any future safari expedition would surely pale in comparison.\n\nDay 5 – Wednesday, May 25th – The Blind Leading the Blyde\n\nTo avoid the inevitable disappointment of a second safari after our first extraordinary foray, we decided to explore the Blyde River Canyon, the third largest canyon in the world. What are #1 and 2? Don’t ask me, Fodor only taught me #3. Good luck looking it up too, because when I tried, the different websites had canyons all over the map (some didn’t even mention Blyde). It depends on how you measure it (length, depth, width, accessibility, etc.). Regardless, Blyde is big and green and offers a scenic drive with several popular viewing points.\n\n[Note to Readers – Skip the next two paragraphs to avoid a boring description of another Ben / Sai driving fight.]\n\nTo get there, I programmed GPSai with the simplest instructions: 1. Tell me when to turn. 2. Don’t tell me how to drive. Wanna guess how Nolufasso did with this assignment? 0 for 2. There was a basic map in the trusty guidebook that would get us to our target destination with minimal turns or surprises. Some say the journey is more fun than the endpoint; others say it’s more fun to enjoy a stress-free straight shot. Sai says we go wherever the GPS tells us to, since it was supposed to shave a few minutes off the aforementioned easy route. This shortcut took us through several random small towns and villages, well off the beaten highway path. There were countless cattle encounters and goat crossings galore. We were definitely taking the scenic route to our scenic route. We finally found a major road, and I was feeling more confident (less odd looks from villagers and livestock), when of course we went off course onto a smaller road, which then led to a smaller one still, then, as we were gazing ahead at the looming large mountains straight ahead, the pavement ended and we were headed north on a nice dirt road, which itself seemed to degrade further as we continued on the sure path as dictated by the two ladies telling me which way to go (Sai and Ms. Google Maps). The rocky road jostled the hell out of us as it took us past seemingly unmanned farmland (we saw animals, but few people or houses), testing the treads of our rental non-ATV. Sai assured me that we would arrive in a mere 20 km more on this off-road path; I explained how if the Honda Ballade ended in a ditch, I’d have a manageable time retracing our route on foot, but she’d be toast. A little later, we passed another group of cows walking down the middle of their secluded street, along with a rather surprised looking young cowherd (no relation to Colin, as far as I could tell), clearly wondering where the hell we were going, but I guess too chicken to ask. Soon, a positive sign appeared, when a large service vehicle caught up from behind. We let him pass, but he pulled over in front to ask us the same question that was on the coward’s mind. His laughter at our planned endpoint was not as positive a sign, and he pointed us back in the opposite direction. So much for the shortcut.\n\nThus began fight #2, with the first following Sai’s refusal to follow the second rule – DON’T TELL ME HOW TO DRIVE!! By now, I had adjusted to the South African style of aggressive driving. Slow-moving vehicle on a blind curve? No problem. Just jump across the centerline into oncoming traffic lanes, accelerate, and pass away! Well, you actually hold your breath (and your passenger holds their tongue), and you both hope not to literally pass away. That’s the way it’s done in SA. So when Sai wasn’t screaming at me, I was actually having fun. But after the dirt road debacle, I questioned her mapping skills when she planned a recovery that would take us an hour south, only to take another route back northwest to where we were trying to go. Fodor’s trusty map (the one she refused to follow in the first place) showed a simpler, northerly route around the big mountain. After fifteen minutes of arguing in the middle of a random parking lot about general map reading comprehension and common sense, she finally agreed to let me drive my way. Fun times.\n\nThe easterly, overly and through-mountain route turned out to be as scenic as the Panorama Route on the backside, which was our planned return road all along. We made it to the top of the canyon tour intact, and proceeded south from there back in the direction of our hotel. First stop was the Three Rondavels, mountain peaks across the gorge that resemble thatch huts, with a lovely river and dam far down below us on our high side. It’s a popular postcard view from the Mpumalanga Province. We next visited Bourke’s Luck Potholes, another neat roadside scenic attraction. It’s a series of cascading falls that’ve carved gullies (nicknamed potholes by some dork named Bourke) into the sides of the canyon cliffs. Between stops 2 and 3, we drove through a staged burn of dry grass (not the funny kind – we were only high in altitude) which was a little scary, seeing smoke and ash and not much else for a few short seconds until we were safely out the other side. At least I hope it was staged. Otherwise, we should have stopped to scold the group of pyromaniac stoners. God’s Window was our third stop, where we again enjoyed picturesque views of valleys below. Knowing where we were going was much less stressful, and we enjoyed the leisurely drive, jamming out to some SA tunes whenever FM signals allowed. The livestock crossings were far fewer, though there were regular monkey sightings instead. But monkeys are boring, so we headed back to Kruger for a quick buffet bite and then to look for bigger buggers in the black. Our vow to avoid disappointing follow up safaris lasted approximately 28 hours.\n\nFilling our 20 seat vehicle were Sai, myself, and a guy from Brazil, plus our spotter / driver. Weekday, wintertime travels are the way to go, if you don’t like crowds. I don’t like crowds. Our driver had his headlights and a handheld spotlight shining out the right (wrong) side of the large open sided ride. A couple of empty seats back sat our Brazilian illuminati, with Sai and I seated opposite sharing the third spotlight to search for glowing eyes in the dark of the left side.\n\nFirst complaint – the driver drove fast! By the time you think you might’ve spotted something, it was already well passed.\n\nSecond complaint (I like to complain) – the driver was deaf! Whenever one of us thought we saw something, it would take a group effort (and we were a small group) to gain the driver’s attention. By this time, our nocturnal target was even farther behind. Still, like a champ, our deaf speed racer would dutifully reverse course, shine his own light, and tell us it was just another group of stupid impalas (deja vu). Sorry Chevy, those things are dime a dozen in Kruger. For what it’s worth, they do make a nice sausage, which we enjoyed at dinner a few hours earlier. We also saw a couple kudu, which also make for nice sausage.\n\nThird complaint – we sucked at night spotting. Not a single big cat was seen in our two hour tour. We did see a civet, a smaller predatory cat, and some hyenas were spotted, so that counts for something. Hyenas are nasty scavengers, not predators. They think they’re so smart, they’re always laughing at others. We also found three hippos, and a night owl elephant and giraffe (mostly courtesy of the show-off, multi-tasking driver; Sai and I were aces at spotting stupid impalas though).\n\nOverall, it was an interesting change of scenery from the daytime viewing to glowing eyes in the dark. Though, as predicted, it could not measure up to the high bar set from our previous day’s success. If we’d seen a big cat in action, it would’ve been awesome. Instead, it was just okay. I guess it’s lions, leopards, or bust.\n\nDay 6 – Thursday, May 26th – Sabi Sauce\n\nBy now, I’m sure you’ve had enough safari. People say it’s a once in a lifetime experience, and Sai and I had now gone on two tours (Tuesday’s all day extravaganza and Wednesday’s weak witnessing of the park after dark). So for Thursday, we elected to stay away from that Boer Kruger’s park and went to Sabi Sands instead. We were picked up at 5 a.m. (sleep’s overrated) and shuttled to the private game reserve roughly an hour away (though literally next door to our hotel – it’s a huge piece of land, with bumpy roads and several checkpoints to get there). For roughly double the price of Kruger for maybe half the time, you can tour a smaller animal enclosure. Having to wake up an hour earlier and adding in the commute, it sounds pretty awful, doesn’t it?\n\nWell please disregard the short shrift (if you haven’t automatically), and consider the following: Sabi Sands is a large, densely animally populated property. Instead of national park serviced roads full of safari tour groups, private drivers, minivans, service vehicles, park police, etc., SS (Sabi Sands) has a handful of large all-terrain vehicles all going in different directions throughout the land on dirt tracks, such that you’d only occasionally see another group. And when an animal was spotted, we didn’t have to edge up or back on the main road, hoping it might come our way or hit a clearance so we could get a better view; here the driver would simply off-road it right to them! (In the lowveld, the bush is not as thick as in other regions, particularly in the dry, winter season. This makes it easier to drive through if you have the right ATV). While we were very fortunate to have some front row seats for Big Five (and other) animal sightings inside Kruger, inside SS, this is more of the norm. It is a much more intimate experience in general.\n\nOur guide this time was likewise very knowledgeable, though this guy was much more eager to explain. We received random nuggets in whispered tones from our first guide. The SS guy (that sounds bad); Sabi Guy was like an information geyser, spewing more than I wanted to know. Easy, bub, let me just enjoy the rhino fifteen feet away, listening to him chew, rather than you telling me what he’s doing or telling me about the scabs on his neck on which those little birds are chewing… It was information overload, especially since I only retain a few snippets before I butcher the facts. Still, he was well intentioned, as am I as I try to share some stuff I found interesting without leading you too far astray (whatever’s wrong in the following is from my own misunderstanding – do not doubt Mr. Know-It-All Sabi Sands Guide).\n\nWhite rhinos are rare and endangered, though not as rare as black rhinos. All of the rhinos we had seen so far were “white”, though I could not have guessed it without the guides calling them that. Turns out, I’m not as color-blind as this might have led me to believe. White rhinos are so named because of a bad translation of the word for wide, which was in reference to the shape of their mouths (you thought I was going to call out their wide asses, didn’t you? Fat rhino shamer, shame on you). Instead of fixing the translation, the name just stuck, relegating their skinnier-mouthed cousins to the spectral opposite colored name, to separate the species (some rhino-shit apartheid politics, if you ask me). There are several tell-tale signs between the two species, but most are too subtle for an idiot like me, so the easiest one to remember is that black rhinos are antagonistic, anti-social loners (like me!) who would rather charge you than pose for your picture.[16] Black rhinos also prefer thicker bush, and are less less rare (slightly more common, though you can’t call an endangered species common) in those areas. Luckily for us, we had the safer white rhinos in rare abundance on this day. Horny bastards with erectile dysfunction, missing values, and disposable income have created a market for rhino horns, under the mistaken belief that the magical points will somehow help the dicks of these dicks. Rhino horns are made of keratin. This is the same material as fingernails and hair. Mr. Sabi Tour Guide Know It All told us we’d be just as hard chewing our own fingernails as paying for magic rhino horn powder[17]. In other words, unless you’re a male rhino, you should never have a rhino boner.\n\nWe saw a single rhino chilling for our viewing pleasure, then another single, then a pair of lady rhinos a short while after that. Next, a group of four, then two more, and by then, we simply passed them by as if they were impalas. Can you imagine getting to the point where you’re like “What’s that? Oh, it’s just another rhino. Nothing to see here.”\n\nWe also saw wildebeests and warthogs and a waterbuck (missing whales and walri (what’s the plural of walrus?) to wrap up W animals I can think of offhand), some eagles (like the Doug Pederson era in Philly, hard to get overly excited about), mini-mongeese (what’s the plural of mongoose?), a giraffe, a hyena, kudu, endless worthless impalas, and a dazzling array of zebras. Here’s another fun fact from me[18]. Zebras tend to stand out because of their black and white stripes (relax, that’s not the fun fact. It’s a boring, obvious fact, I’m getting to the good stuff). As a defense mechanism, zebras in herds will run around in circles with their collective black and white stripes swirling together to confuse their hungry predators, so that a single animal is hard to isolate and stalk from the group. Thus a dazzle of zebras! In the one pack we saw, there are around two dozen of the referees, so I couldn’t pick out which one to eat.\n\nInstead, they fed us a nice breakfast at one of the Sabi Sands Resorts before shuttling us back to our hotel. It is an option to consider staying at one of these high-end resorts, where the high-priced nightly fee includes twice daily game drives like the one we went on, but our Protea Hotel offered us more flexibility (plus a shitty treadmill). On the ride back, we saw a cape buffalo and a couple of elephants, bringing our Big Five tracking up to 60% for those keeping score (which everyone does). Another big cat-less bonanza. Fuck those stupid lions and lazy leopards who refused to grace us with their presence. I was willing to sacrifice the Canadian couple from our group to feed the ferocious felines, but apparently SA animals find Canucks to be tasteless and boring too[19].\n\nAfter seeming less than excited about safaris ahead of the trip, and then seeming fully sated from the first full day, Sai surprised me[20] by getting the big game bug and pushing for another tour after Sabi. The girl was hooked!\n\nAnother look for the Big Two took us back to Kruger, this time in our own rental car. After three official tries, we felt expert enough to do it ourselves without guides. We filled the afternoon with five plus hours of slow driving through the park, before forlornly returning to the hotel, once again defeated. Okay, that’s a bit strong. For the day, we had experienced a bumper crop of rhinos plus the dazzle of zebras at Sabi, followed by Kruger’s offering of enough packs of tusked pachyderms to fill a brokered convention. I haven’t seen that many elephants since _____ (insert your own fat joke here. Sometimes the setup is too easy, just like your _____ (insert your own slutty family member here)). We saw so many elephants, twice in packs of ten or more (I didn’t take my shoes off to get an exact count), that the long-trunked troops took over where the earlier rhinos left off, meaning that they became passe, like those good for nothing except for sausage impalas.\n\nWe even saw a bunch of hippos, including three of them playing hide and seek in a big lake / pond (not sure its official designation – but it was a large body of water with three blobs bobbing just below the surface, with fat heads and backs poking above). Most of the hippos we saw were distant and hard to focus on, but that’s okay, I like to keep my distance from most hipsters anyway. There was a small croc sunning itself on a rock, blending well but given away by the other vehicles stopping to snap pics (a telltale sign of some kind of animal that would otherwise likely be missed). A box turtle got in on the action by taking his time crossing the street, stalling traffic in the process. More kudus and inyalas and Sai found us our own giraffe, until we were pursued by others pulling behind to see what we were seeing.\n\nBut the best was towards the last with a group of Cape buffalo. My expert wife (even if she couldn’t spew animal facts) spotted an ugly animal off in the distance. We lacked the all-terrain tires[21] from Sabi’s safari, so we simply waited to see if the big ugly would come our way. Should we stay or should we go, we pondered, like the Clash song, as other vehicles pulled up behind, saw the distant buffalo, and moved along, but our patience was rewarded when three rather large, unhappy-looking, angry-mooing animals gave us a walk-by. Their passing glances seemed to convey a clear message that said “Fuck you Ben. You’ve been calling us ugly for days now. We could easily turn and charge and your ass would be grass. That pathetic little Honda couldn’t stop us. But we’re the bigger, better beasts here, and you’re beneath us. Despite all your hurtful remarks, we won’t hurt you back. Know this, bruh, in a few short days, you’ll be gasping for air and wishing for mercy on the road toward Durban. We’ll be right here, basking in our glorious bushveld, and laughing like hyenas at your ugly, out-of-shape, sarcastic, sorry ass. Izokuthoba, Comrade.”\n\nAnd with that, they were gone. Damn those magnificent mind-readers! They’ve moved up on my Big Five list, above those lame cats that I don’t think even exist. Leopards must be like leprechauns, only seen by drunken Irish (is there any other kind?). And lions only show up in some twisted bestiality dreams of mine. But the Cape buffalo, those boys are real. I ended that evening crawled up in a fetal position crying, but that’s not unusual. For her part, Sai snored away.\n\nDay 7 – Friday, May 27th – Last Chance for Lions\n\n[Another entry worth skipping. More Ben and Sai bickering. Like the old Aussie Georges once said (I imagine) “Sometimes you get gold. More often, you get shafted.” Today was the latter.]\n\nWhy does Nolufasso (the simplifier) always have to make it so complicated? The Skukuza gas station was around thirty minutes away. The Skukuza airport and rental car drop-off was ten minutes beyond that. All we had to do was drive around Kruger for a couple of hours, not see any mythical lions[22], fill up gas, and head for our flight to Durban. Simple enough, Nolufasso? Not so fast. First, Sai insisted that we didn’t need to fill the tank before returning the car (despite the fact that the rental agency specifically instructed us that we’d be charged extra if we didn’t), so I protested but relented because Sai is stubborn and I knew the argument would go on until we missed our flight if I didn’t just give in. I’d rather search for invisible leopards than continue to rationalize with an irrational wife. Then, as we were approaching the airport, she asked if we should get gas first. I ignored her. After unloading everything and checking in and dropping the Honda key, Sai comes back to tell me that we need petrol. I was a little miffed. And by miffed, I mean f-ing pissed, though I dutifully took the key back, said “I’ll be back” (not in an Ahnold accent), and dutifully left to fill in the tank while she waited at the airport. I even waited until I was a minute down the road with the windows up and well out of her earshot before I unleashed the fury of profanities.\n\nAfter gassing up, I drove back to the airport, espying along the way my last large group of impalas milling around in the road, a soaring, circling large bird (if only I had a tour guide with me, I could tell you what kind, but it was big, black and white, and cool looking), and then a bunch of bloated-ass baboons. Seeing these wild animals tamed me, and I was feeling much more mellow when I made it back to the airport. I didn’t even care if Sai apologized for being wrong and wasting my time; I was feeling that magnanimous. All I needed was for her not to give me attitude for leaving her helplessly alone in a beautiful airport lounge that resembled the lobby of an African resort. Guess what happened next?\n\nSai was pissed that I didn’t tell her where I was going. I still think it was rather obvious when she said we needed gas, I said I’d be back, where the $%^@ do you think I was going? She was pissed that I left her with the carry-on luggage, rather than lugging it back to the car, because apparently it is impossible to use the bathroom if you have to watch a few bags. Camouflage predators were secretly lurking throughout that lounge, waiting to pounce if she dared try to pee without me. She was pissed that I didn’t take her with me. So, I was even more pissed that she was pissed at me, and that she was so pissy with me, so we spent half our time waiting for our flight exchanging nasty-grams in front of golden girl tourists who were wondering what type of wild animals had followed them into the terminal to stage a scene for their viewing displeasure. Good times.\n\nIn retrospect, it is likely that I was feeling the mounting stress of the impending race[23], shortening my usually lengthy fuse. I admitted as much to her, which she insisted I document, so there it is. You know you can’t spell Saint without Sai, said no one ever before now.\n\nWe bounced back through Jo’Burg before boarding the second leg to Durban on two of the smoothest flights I’ve ever been on. Their airport security was efficient, boarding and take-off were on-time, and both planes landed early. Despite being short flights, we were served snacks and drinks, and there were no BS extra charges like most stateside flights.\n\nOf course our rollercoaster day hit another downslide when Sai’s psycho side reappeared on the ride to the hotel, and then again from the hotel to dinner, before she settled after drinking some wine. I tried to think of the best way to keep her liquored up for the balance of the trip.\n\nDay 8 – Saturday, May 28th – Calm Before the Storm\n\nNot sure that calm is the right word for it, more like resigned to my fate at this point. My measly mile morning run (cut short for need of a toilet, not by need to taper) told me three things. 1) Durban has a beautiful downtown stadium and Indian Ocean coastline that I didn’t see driving in the dark the night before. 2) Durban has a lot of big hills! And 3) Hopefully with better luck finding bathrooms along the way, I’d only need to repeat this slow, less than pleasant effort ~55 more times the next day.\n\nAt breakfast, Sai and I spoke with a nice French woman working for the UN in Tanzania. According to Elle (not her real name, but I couldn’t pronounce or spell her real name, so Elle it is), living in Tanzania, there’s not much to do but to take up running, at least in her case. We agreed to try to coordinate the ride to the start. She told us that the last bus to Pietermaritzburg would be leaving at 3:30 a.m.\n\nDuring the twenty minute drive from the hotel to the race expo, Sai decided that she wanted no part of Durban driving, and would not be following this same route to drop Elle and me off for our bus eighteen hours later. Durban’s a big city (third largest in SA, behind Jozi and Cape Town), and driving in a foreign city is a little scary, but I was pretty sure Sai would have survived. Besides, she had nothing better to do at 3 a.m. Oh well, minor details, with plenty of time to figure out how I would get to the start. We reached the race expo, and it was a spectacular spectacle (if you like those sorts of things like I do). Next to the Boston Marathon, Comrades had probably the next best pre-race exposition of any race I’ve been to. Tons of booths showcasing all kinds of gear, gadgets, goods and goos, regional race registrations, food stalls, plus everything Comrades-labeled you can think of at their main sponsor New Balance store. After I picked up my race bibs, pins, timing chip, tee shirt, visor, and Comrades bag, we wandered around, picking up a couple of Comrades shirts, and Sai tried some shock treatment[24]. I bought a one-way bus ticket to a faraway town, and we exited the convention center in under an hour. I could have easily spent much more time (and money) there, but it’s not for everyone, and I’d get enough Comrades stuff the next day, in a long road trek.\n\nNext, we drove up to Pietermaritzburg so I could get the lay of the land. It would be dark when I’d see it again pre-dawn the next day, so I figured we’d get it in all its daylight glory today. And it was glorious. Okay, maybe glorious is a bit strong (by an exponential factor), but it was amply okay (a hell of a lot nicer than Jo’Burg). We saw the City Hall that would start it all, with plenty of runners in town to pick up their numbers and to enjoy a couple hours of extra sleep versus those of us coming from Durban in the morning. (You can stay in Durban, but then have to make your way to Pietermaritzburg for the start, or you can stay in Pietermaritzburg, but then have to make your way back after the finish; Durban is bigger and had more to offer for Sai, so I opted to stay there). We popped into a local museum where displayed animals were a lot less exciting than the living creatures in the wild (though much easier to spot), and hit up Nando’s for some tasty peri peri chicken for lunch. According to the fast food restaurant’s history, the peri peri sauces are the only positives from the original Portuguese visitors.\n\nMy biggest takeaway was that it didn’t seem too far or even particularly hilly on the main highway drive out. Sure, the real course would follow a more serpentine route, (which should also promise better scenery and fewer vehicles), with an extra hill or two, but the direct drive gave me a little more confidence that I could make it from Point B to A.\n\nOn the return journey, my Thai navigator navigated like a Portuguese pro, taking us onto the back roads that traversed the Valley of a Thousand Hills, and followed a good portion of the course. And damn it all, it took a hell of a lot longer and revealed so many hills otherwise hidden from the highway! My confidence from just a paragraph ago quickly evaporated. Still, the quiet drive was a nice way of scoping out what I thought could be my final resting place. If I dropped dead there, those background hills would make a nice backdrop for my broken body. It was very scenic, winding its way through little towns with vistas of rolling hills all around. We stopped at a quaint little bohemian village selling handmade specialties. We stopped at the Comrades Wall of Honour (their spelling), where I picked out some legends I knew about from my pre-race studies[25] and from generally following the sport (Arthur Newton, Bill Rowan, Wally Hayward, Alberto Salazar, Ann Trason, to name just a few). I won’t be joining their ranks in this lifetime, but next time, who knows? Maybe I’ll be born with more talent and a better work ethic. Doubtful, I’ll more likely come back as a cockroach (if you believe in Karma), or be too busy burning (if you buy into those hellish doctrines), so this passing visit to the Wall of Honour was probably the closest I’ll ever get.\n\nEnough depressing thoughts about running and mortality and eternal damnation, so we went to the beach. Nice beaches, though nothing to compare to the beauty of the Thai islands (I’ve been spoiled). Pasta dinner and early back to the B&B, where our very helpful host Vincent assured me that he’d already figured out race transportation for me (and Elle) from the hotel. We would meet at 2:45 in the lobby. Sai could sleep in. Despite the nerves that had me feeling nauseated most of the day, with the looming doom and gloom of a long, painful run hanging over my head, I somehow managed to get a little sleep that night.\n\nDay 9 – Sunday, May 29th – COMRADES!!\n\nIzokuthoba – It will humble you. This was the message for the 91st Comrades Marathon. Well consider me humbled. And hobbled. And happy! Sure, that took a lot longer than I thought it would, but a week ago, I was worried that I wouldn’t make it to the start of the 2016 race, let alone to the finish of the 2.1 marathon long “marathon”. The official measurement relayed to us at the start of this down run was 89.2 km, or 55.4 miles for the metrically challenged.\n\nThe down run covers the original route from 1921, going from Pietermaritzburg down to Durban. Next year will be an up run, generally reversing the course, except it starts at City Hall of the first city and ends in a stadium at the destination, such that the routes are a little different (the up run is usually about a mile shorter, those slackers). To the South African purists[26], only partial credit is given for completing one of the runs; you need both an up and a down (in either order) to have truly experienced the full fury of Comrades. But why stop there, when you can run it over and over and over… Vic Boston completed his 40th consecutive race on the day that I completed my first. The old man breezed past me sometime after 80 km, adding another humbling moment to a day full of them. I was five months old when Vic ran his first Comrades in 1977. Mr. Boston was just one (extremely impressive) example, and not even the longest running. South Africans revere this race, to the point where 95% of the 20,000 entrants are domestic, and roughly 2/3rds of all runners are repeaters.\n\nComrades is the oldest and largest ultramarathon in the world. It is South Africa’s equivalent premier running event to the US’ Boston Marathon. Having now done both[27], I feel qualified enough to offer some comparisons. If you’ve likewise done both, feel free to skip past the next several paragraphs, as you’ve likely come to your own conclusions. Or, if you read and disagree, you’re welcome to write your own report or publish a paper entitled “Ben is an Idiot,” but that won’t surprise many people. For those who have only done one or the other or neither, feel free to trust me, but as always, caveat emptor (Latin loosely for “Ben is an idiot”).\n\nBoth B and C (need to find a big A race to fill the ABCs of running) are old runs. Boston dates back to 1897, Comrades to 1921. Both are point to point, passing through a bunch of different towns along the way. Both started meagerly, with the first Boston consisting of 10 finishers, while Comrades managed 16. Neither allowed women to officially run until much later, Boston in 1972, Comrades in 1975[28]. Both have since grown to preeminent bucket list races for many people, with entry requirements and capped fields limited only by the logistical demands of the streets and organizers (in other words, if there were no caps, the fields would continue to grow). Both have large prize purses and attract the world’s best elite runners at the front. But those are the boring facts. These are not what make the runs special.\n\nBoston is traditionally run on Patriots Day, a Monday in April when most offices are closed for their local fake holiday. This means that people can stay home and hang out, and spend hours on their curbs eating and drinking, and pointing and laughing at the pained expressions on the masochistic men and women running (or wheeling) past. Of course, no one admits this. They cover it up with enthusiastic “looking great” cheers of encouragement, but that’s a lie. I have photographic proof from every race I’ve ever done that I am never “looking great”. Comrades has changed its date over the years, but is now on a Sunday in late May, and features the same fanfare as Boston along the route. While driving the course on Saturday, we heard the race director predicting a crowd of 400,000 to be lining the way, (plus another 5 million people watching on TV). It’s these people who make these races so much “fun”.\n\nThe carnival atmosphere and supportive crowds (even if they are secretly laughing at us) are what really set these races apart from any others in my humble opinion. And since I’ve been humbled, I can offer that opinion freely. It is an addictive rush to run past the screaming hordes, like you’re part of something big. It’s a synergistic effect, runners, crowd and race all combining into an “event”. In both cases, people gear their year towards it. You don’t just jump in either. You plan for, register early, train, qualify, train some more (not necessarily in that order), and hope to be handed a metal medal to reward your mettle at the end of it. You can also pick up your trophy race clothes (tees, hats, long sleeves, jackets, etc.) to show others that you were part of it (though I didn’t buy too much at the expo, since I was afraid I’d have to give away the goods if I didn’t finish. Also, I’m cheap.).\n\nThe runners are so different in so many ways, but the similarities are striking. You see Boston Marathoners who run the race religiously, year after year, just like the Comrades veterans who keep returning and reuniting with previous pals on the long trek between towns. In both events, unless you’re in the top tier, you can see a sea of bodies stretching out in front and behind for miles, showing how many others are going through the same thing.\n\nMy first Boston (back in ’97) was one of the coolest running experiences of my life. Comrades may not have matched it, mainly because I was not feeling as strong as I was in that Boston run, but it was pretty darn cool too. (I’d rank Comrades above my ’03 and ’14 Bostons). Some differences though, to prevent any Boston vets from feeling like there’s no need to travel to South Africa, or vice versa, because there are some big separators between the two runs, not just an extra 29 miles in SA (though that is probably the scariest factor).\n\nPeople swear by ultramarathons as being such a tighter knit community, where a low-key crowd is pulling together and pulling for each other, as opposed to a cutthroat road competition. There is usually some merit to this stereotype, as most ultras are more laidback, with almost always less than a 1000 runners (JFK being the closest I’ve run to that count, most are closer to 100), whereas most of the road races I typically run have ten or twenty times that count. When you’re running for half a day or more, there’s no rush to get in and out of aid stations, and the pace is more conversational. You’re seeing many of the same people over and over again, as you yo-yo back and forth, or pass back on the out and back sections, or loop around to catch each other. You often recognize familiar faces from previous races as well, as there are only so many ultra nuts in a given region. In the bigger races, there is much more anonymity, and I wouldn’t say animosity, but rather indifference to those around you. So for Comrades to combine the ultra distance with the big road race size, I wasn’t sure how it would play out, whether it would be the community experience or the road rage competition. I needn’t have worried, as the field epitomized the camaraderie of the race name. Many times when I felt defeated, random strangers would offer support, telling me to come along and run with them, or asking what was ailing me and suggesting this or that to help alleviate the suffering. In other big races, it’s not uncommon to offer a quick “hang in there” or “almost there” or other simple pick me up, but Comrades makes it more personal, via their brilliant bib system.\n\nIf there’s one thing I’d like Boston to plagiarize from Comrades (reversing the course and ending in Hopkinton not being a good idea), it would be the race bibs. The CMA[29] gives runners two bibs, one for front and the other for your back. These bibs tell your whole story, more or less. While it might mean something to hear someone shout out “Go Number 19647!”, having them instead say “Good job Ben, welcome to South Africa, how are you enjoying your first Comrades?” is a bit more personal. I won’t cover the entire bib system because it’s too complicated for me, but some basics are as follows: Foreign runners wear blue bibs, while locals wear white. If you’ve run ten or more (or won three times) you get a green bib, regardless of where you’re from. If you’ve run nine (or nineteen, or twenty nine, etc.) and are going for a milestone #10, 20, 30 or 40, you wear a yellow bib, so people around you instantly recognize the accomplishment you’re after. If you’re going for your second straight (a back to back), your bib is outlined accordingly. So, you can tell a lot about a runner just from the color of their bib. The tag also gives your first name prominently, and lists the number of completed runs as well. From this, my blue bib with the number 0 and my name told the people around me that I was a long way from home without a clue as to what I was doing. It is a great conversation starter! During the run, a very friendly complete stranger saw me struggling, and said “Come on Ben. You can do this!” I immediately spotted his yellow bib, and asked which milestone he was running for, #10 or 20? He said “let me surprise you” and pointed out the number 29, telling me that he was on his way to his 30th completion. I shook his hand, congratulated him on being a young-looking badass, and proceeded to eat his dust. Likewise, as we approached the stadium, I was celebrating with the zeroes around me by shouting “come on _____ (names unimportant), let’s go collect our first medals!” It’s such a simple system, but it says so much about the runners. BAA[30], if you’re reading this, steal Comrades’ bib system!\n\nAnyway, enough preamble, history, preaching, ado; I’ll get on with my specific humbling experience[31]. The day started with a 2:15 a.m. alarm, and I was quickly up and showered and dressed, then busily dowsing myself in sunscreen in the hotel lobby while waiting for my ride to downtown Durban, where I’d hop on a bus to Pietermaritzburg, where I’d hop off that bus and try to return to Durban on foot, where I’d hopefully find my wife waiting in the Kingsmead Cricket Stadium, from which we’d figure out how to get back to the hotel so I could shower again and get back into bed. Sounds kind of pointless, to wake up so early to go so far out of the way just to circle back to the same initial prone position, but the same can be said for getting out of bed every day.\n\nOur international carload of one American (me), one French woman living in Tanzania (Elle), and two South Africans (Sam and her mother, our driver) drove to Pietermaritzburg (sorry, that joke-sounding intro deserves a better punchline), which was a pleasant surprise to Elle and me, as we thought we were only being dropped off in Durban to board the bus to Pietermaritzburg. In these things, things often don’t go according to plan, but now and then, they go better. The ride consisted of Elle fretting that she’d lost her international wrist band, Sam’s mom complaining that the American pop / hip hop music Sam was playing was crap, Sam telling me that I’d have no problem earning a silver medal, and me, stupidly believing Sam’s over-confidence in my abilities.\n\nSeven weeks ago, I felt pretty good about my training and fitness; since then, I’d missed as many days as I’d run, and the few runs were of minimal quality. From December through early April, I’d averaged around 60 miles per week, with long runs of 46 in February, a solid qualifying marathon in March, and a decent 50 miler in April. After that 50, I suffered a type of shin splints to my extensor halluces longus tendon, which extends from my left big toe up the front of my shin. That sucked. But a desperate round of physical therapy including cupping and dry needling[32], a separate acupuncture and moxibustion treatment, rest, ice, compression sock and elevation (RICE), and I was able to overcome the shin-kick feeling after a couple of weeks. Then, when I was getting ready to re-up the miles again, I ran through a sore throat (neck up symptoms), but the cold spread downward into a chest cold, cough and congestion, which got progressively worse until I could ignore it no longer and backed off again. Two courses of antibiotics later (plus cough medicine, cough drops, some non-performance enhancing steroids (out of competition), neti-potting, and rest), and I was feeling nowhere near as good as before, but at least healthy enough to line up at the start.\n\nI’d done a lot of research[33] and planning for this race, as South Africa is a long way from DC, and I didn’t want to go this distance only to not be able to go the distance, as the cornfield voice would say. From this research, I realized that although the record for this race was faster than the world record pace for 50 miles, this would not be an easy road run. This was going to be tough. Comrades was the main purpose of the trip for me (not as much a priority for Sai), so I had to finish first and foremost. A secondary goal would be to break 9 hours and earn a Bill Rowan medal. Anything beyond this would be bonus. So, when Sam started telling me that a silver medal was a sure thing, of course I instinctively disregarded my own expectations and knowledge and bought into her expertise, since she had once run the race in the opposite direction a few years prior and knew my capabilities from one qualifying marathon. We’ve previously established that I am an idiot, so you probably know where this is going.\n\nI’ll explain the medal system now. Top 10 men and Top 10 women each earn gold medals. Positions 11 through 6:00:00 earn Wally Hayward medals, named after the winner from 1930, 50, 51, 53, and 1954. Wally tarnished his perfect record by not winning when he returned in 1988 and 1989, though he further distinguished himself as the oldest finisher at the age of 80 in that last run. After Wally, silver medals are given for running between 6:00 and 7:30:00, then Bill Rowan medals for 7:30 to 9:00:00. Bill Rowan won the first Comrades in 1921 in a time of 8:59. Bronze medals are awarded for 9:00 to 11:00:00, and Vic Clapham medals are given for 11:00 to 12:00:00. Vic Clapham founded the event. After 12:00, no medals are given. All times are based on the gun, not chip times.\n\nFor some perspective on these medals, in 2016, there were 20,000 entrants (the capped max), with 16,808 starting, and 14,603 finishing. Of these, 20 earned Gold medals. 16 earned Wally Haywards. 607 earned Silvers. 2,248 earned Bill Rowans. 11,541 earned Bronze and Vic Claphams[34]. 171 finished after the 12 hour cutoff.\n\nIn other words, I had no business even thinking about silver.\n\nWe arrived in P-Diddy-Burg just after 4 a.m., with almost 90 minutes to chill before go time. Temps were in the mid-40s Fahrenheit, maybe 7-8 degrees Celsius, say 280 degrees Kelvin to cover all the bases. Perfect running weather, though it wouldn’t stay that cool, and it was chilly for standing around. Locals were freezing. I supplemented my racing singlet with arm sleeves that I later removed before the start. Hours later, baking under the African sun, I couldn’t believe that some people were still wearing long sleeves and/or gloves. Upon arrival, I was accosted by a local who said something to me in what I believe was a Bantu language (it wasn’t English, beyond that, I confess ignorance), so I played the dumb tourist that I am by smiling and saying thank you. “Why do you say thank you?” was his immediate challenging reply, to which my sleep-deprived, addled mind could not come up with a satisfactory answer. In hindsight, I’m pretty sure he had cursed me with a tribal incantation to bring the solar burn of a thousand suns upon my sorry white epidermis, and the muscular burn of a thousand hills upon my sorry weak muscles that day. Fool that I am, I gratefully accepted his curse. (Some might argue that I brought both of these burdens upon myself, but I blame that random mystic).\n\nSkipping forward an hour, I was in the B Corral shoulder to shoulder with thousands of South Africans and far fewer foreigners. This meant that the enthusiastic chorus to the national anthem was so much more impressive than the usual tepid response to the Star Spangled Banner before US races (where most people respectfully quiet down and take off their hats, but only a few weirdos sing along). No offense F.S. Key, but their tune sounded a lot better. Then, Shosholoza was played, and the crowd really ramps it up to an eleven. I’d read about this pre-race ritual, but hadn’t paid it much thought. In the trenches, it is stirring. From the helpful Comrades USA newsletter, I knew the lyrics meant something about running forward from the mountains, but I felt it more powerful not knowing the full meaning. Like Red said in the Shawshank Redemption: “I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don’t want to know. Some things are best left unsaid. I’d like to think they were singing about something so beautiful, it can’t be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it.” Shosholoza was stuck in my head for the first couple of hours of the run[35].\n\nFollowing Shosholoza, they played the song from the legendary race between Chevy Chase and Anthony Michael Hall in National Lampoon’s Vacation (not Holiday Road; the Chariots of Fire theme), and everyone proceeded to fall asleep. Okay, that’s unfair, it’s a great running song, just a boring (albeit classic) movie (C of F, not NL’s V). Some aside irony – Chariots of Fire is about a devout Christian runner who was willing to forego his chance at Olympic glory because his God would not want him to compete on a Sunday. Here we were, thousands of runners deep, getting ready to spend all day Sunday running a race kicked off by the theme song from that same movie. Eric Liddell would not approve. And three film references for two songs? Maybe I should spend more time training and less time watching TV.\n\nAnyway, after the inspiring Shosholoza (SA’s version of IM’s Run To the Hills), and Chariots of Fire, I was fired up, a cannon was fired, and I took off as if fired from a cannon. Just kidding, but I did of course start out too fast. Old habits (particularly bad ones) die hard, as would I in a few short hours (not literally). It took me maybe 40 seconds to get from my position in Corral B across the starting line, so the gun time versus chip time medal cutoff would not be any kind of excuse. Kudos again to South African efficiency (from flights to expo pickup to race start, everything ran smoothly. If only I had some South African blood, maybe I would too). I hit the first 5k in around 27 minutes, 10k in 52, 20k at 1:42, half marathon (just over 21k) at 1:47, and was feeling fine cardiovascularly (not hacking up a lung from the old chest cold, to my great relief). I maintained this same pace through 30k, reached in 2:32, which meant that I was generally on pace for a 7:30 type effort (at roughly 1/3rd into the run), so maybe Sam was right!\n\nI backed off a bit in the next third, at first intentionally, and then automatically. I downed the first “marathon[36]” in around 3:45, so I had fallen off the silver line, but I still had plenty of time banked for reaching a Rowan, right? Then, with less than thirty miles to go, things got interesting. And by interesting, I mean ugly. The course traverses the Valley of a Thousand Hills, but this is poorly named because I’m pretty sure they missed a few in that count. While this was a down run, it was not lacking in nice uphill climbs either. After a few hours on these rollercoaster roads, my legs were ruined. Calf cramping became a constant (unwelcome) companion for the second half of the race, and the quads were similarly stricken. At least I was not alone in these ailments, as the “physiotherapy” tents at select aid stations were staffed with attendees ready to rub down our spasming muscles, cold spray us, or ice our aching limbs. I lost track of how many times I took advantage of this service, but each time it would get me back on track towards Durban until the next set of cramps would stop me in my tracks again[37]. The worst was the dreaded double cramp, when both calves would seize at the same time, and I’d spring forward and nearly face plant. There were only a few of these synchronized lockdowns and I somehow managed never to hit the ground.\n\nMy second half strategy was to run the uphills for as long as I could, then walk when the running became too tough. I’d follow a similar plan for the downs. And for the flats, I never found any, so it didn’t matter. I walked a lot. Each time, someone would come up from behind, read my name, and personally encourage me to push on. And it usually worked. There was one part somewhere before the midway where I had to wave off my helpful comrades because I wanted to walk as much to enjoy the view as to rest the legs. Though brutal, it really is a scenic course when you look around, rather than looking down (or up) at the road and mass of bodies in front of you or just seeking out aid. The most impressive stretches were between the towns, where surrounding hillsides showcased vast vistas of green countryside for miles, speckled with occasional homes, with a lengthening snake of runners winding down its middle in the longest, sweatiest parade you can imagine. These peaceful moments of reflection at the course beauty would then be interrupted by my profanities at the next set of cramps.\n\nIn between these quiet moments of pain, we were treated to towns of screaming supporters. I had countless shouts of USA! USA! as I passed by. One of my better decisions was to go with the USA Comrades singlet ordered through the aforementioned Comrades USA newsletter, though in hindsight, I probably should have opted for the sleeved version, as back, shoulder, and under arm sunburns are the pits. Many locals welcomed me to their country or thanked me for visiting. It was nice to be in a foreign land where they didn’t look at me like the ugly American that I am. Many also yelled out references to the Donald, most unflatteringly, such as “Please don’t vote for Trump.” Perhaps they see similarities to their shameful recent past with a Nationalist Party acting for the pure benefit of a wealthy, white upper class, exploiting immigrants and non-whites in an isolationist (pariah), screw the rest of the world approach, and feel that such a person wouldn’t make America great again. Or maybe they just don’t like his small hands and big hair[38]. But I didn’t instigate discussions of politics!\n\nEveryone was incredibly friendly and supportive, except for one guy (besides me. Everyone knows I’m an asshole.). Somewhere with around 20 miles to go (or 32 km), I was overtaken by a bus of runners (their term for a group running together) while walking through an aid station. I didn’t know they were coming, and I was practically stampeded. I also apparently offensively impeded one of the runners in this bus, as he shouted something at me (I yelled an apology), then continued to turn around and glare at me for the next couple of hundred meters or so. I thought he wanted to come back to fight me, but he ultimately realized that I probably wouldn’t put up much of a fight, so he continued on with his run. Anyway, everyone else was great, but that one guy sucks.\n\nOne of the sponsored aid stations had an announcer who called me out as I approached. “Here comes Ben from the USA, working towards his first Comrades!”, to which I proudly waved to the crowds, before he suddenly announced “Ben, you’re about to be passed by a girl”, to which I shamefully shouted “Thanks Tania” as she ran away from me. We passed rural schools of young African children holding out their hands for us to high five on our way. We passed an older prep school of boys in ties and jackets, somehow not melting in that brutal sun[39].\n\nAs the KM to go signs continued to go down in number, my confidence in being able to complete the “run” continued to grow. 21 km to go meant a simple (not so simple) half marathon stood in my way from being able to get off my feet. Somewhere in this range, I found a second wind and started to regroup, perhaps inspired by a stunning blonde sunning herself and cheering us on. She shouted “Go Ben!” or “Way to go Ben!” or maybe it was “Go away Ben!”, but whatever it was, it included my name, and it was special. I really hope her boyfriend doesn’t shoot her in the toilet on Valentine’s Day[40].\n\nMy second wind had me running strong again, passing back some of the many who had earlier left me for dead. New life! Until Cowies Hill, one of the last big climbs, somewhere around 17 km from the finish, which killed my momentum again. I was resigned to bronze glory by this point, with Rowan long since having left the building, and was busily doing mental math to figure out how slow could I go before I’d be running for a Vic Clapham medal. With 16 km to go, ten miles left, if I’m at 7:40, eight minute miles = 9 hours, which is impossible; 200 minutes = 20 minutes per mile = 11 hours, I’m golden bronzen. I hit 50 miles at around 8:35, which is consistent with most of my trail efforts for that distance. Although I thought I’d surely be able to run much faster than that on the roads, not on this day. 10k to go – 6 miles; 8k to go – 5 miles; 5k to go – 3 miles; 4k – 2.5 miles; 3k – less than 2 miles; simple math to keep myself heading for the light at the end of this tunnel of pain. 2k – 1 ¼ miles; 1k – just over half a mile to go![41]\n\nWith under a km to go, some people chose to walk it in to bask in the moment. That thought never crossed my mind. I was determined to run it in, as long as I could. Approaching and entering the stadium is like running down Copley Plaza, with a mass of humanity enveloping you in a rapturous roar. Twice during this stretch, I kind of zoned out and lost myself in the experience. Both times, it only lasted a few steps, but I’d find myself suddenly back again, wondering what the hell just happened, and how did I not fall over? Was this an out of body experience or just a momentary lapse of reason? I don’t know; it’s never happened before, so I’ll just chalk it up to some special Comrades juju.\n\nThen we entered the Kingsmead Cricket Stadium, and proceeded with a counter-clockwise procession around the infield. The stands held thousands of supporters (including my wife), but they blended into background blurs and noise, as I was too focused on completing the semi-circuit to the finish line. I wouldn’t call it a sprint, but there was extra pep in my step and I was passing a few people during this final push. I heard the speaker system announcing me in, as an American completing my first Comrades and challenging me to come back for more, but I had no interest in considering the suggestion at this time. I just wanted to celebrate the end of this one.\n\nFinal time was 9 hours 41 minutes and 30 seconds (gun time), putting me in 4,215th place. For this, I received a small bronze medal. Not to sound ungrateful, but I had expected a Flavor Flav sized neck ornament for the effort, not the little lanyard and coin-sized decoration they gave me. Oh well, it’ll have to do. This was one of the toughest runs I’ve ever done. Izokuthoba – Comrades parlance for “you’re an idiot.[42]”\n\nDay 10 – Monday, May 30th – EsCape\n\nGoodbye, Goble Palms. Our Victorian style manse B&B was a nice home for our short stay in Durban. Vincent, the manager, was the most gracious host you could ever ask for. In addition to organizing transportation for me to the race, he bent over backwards to meet any request for any guest. He reminded me of Geoffrey from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air in terms of appearance, service and accent, though he lacked the TV butler’s snark.\n\nRegrettably, I didn’t have enough to share about the city of Durban, since I spent most of our days there either prepping or resting for, or running and recovering from Comrades, so I wasn’t a good tourist. There is a lot more to offer in this city than the bits I’ve had occasion to share. For instance, Sai visited the Durban Aquarium while I was running / walking / limping, so there’s that. She said it was full of fish. Durban also allows you to go cage fighting with sharks and bungee jumping from its gorgeous soccer stadium, but since Sai refused both options, the boring report is her fault.\n\nThe airport was full of yellow-shirted cripples. These were not the victims from Thailand’s red-shirt / yellow-shirt civil war from a few years ago; everyone coordinated to wear their Comrades swag shirt to show off their achievement. Loser that I am, I missed the memo, so while those walking wounded appeared impressive in their trophy tees, I just looked like a slow gimp without an excuse. A quick, smooth flight deposited us into Cape Town, for the next phase of our adventure.\n\nWe stayed at the Victoria & Alfred Hotel in the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, next to the Victoria & Alfred Mall, and a bunch of other V&A themed establishments, named after the old queen and her son (not to be confused with Albert, the queen’s hubby). This waterfront district is a hub of commercial development, trying to emulate and exceed the waterfront revitalizations of other cities such as Sydney, and San Francisco, according to the city bus tour. They have a save ferris wheel amidst the hotels, shops, restaurants, and harbor, as the big wheels seem to be popular as of late. Outside of Vegas and amusement parks, where are all the roller coasters? Much more fun than a boring ferris wheel, imho.\n\nSai and I embarked on a romantic, private sunset cruise, just the two of us, the crew, and a couple dozen others crammed onto the boat. It wasn’t romantic at all, but neither am I, so it was fitting. We rode out on choppy waves (no chumming, fortunately), sipping champagne, and watching the sun settle lower and lower over the water in front of us, while Table Mountain and Cape Town stood out behind us. Fanie, our funny first mate, provided the entertainment for the cruise, as well as a few facts for us foreigners to quickly forget. He pointed out the large soccer stadium from the 2010 World Cup (not nearly as nice as Durban’s architectural marvel, nor as impressive as the ugly, massive one from Soweto, but a solid number three on my list of SA soccer stadia). He showed us a hole in the (sea)wall where he said Robben Island prisoners would be deposited to await pickup. He pointed out the boat that brought Mandela back to the mainland (named Dias – the boat, not the mainland). Fanie told us all about a high priced hotel that’s hosted celebrities and entertainers, as well as himself, their very own VIC (very important cleaner).\n\nMost importantly, this day signified that the hard part of the trip was now behind us. Much like Table Mountain looms over Cape Town, Comrades had hung over my head for the first week; from this point forward, I had shed that load and could relax, even if I couldn’t walk up or down steps. I even admitted aloud that the stress leading up to the run may have shortened my patience with my ever-patient, perfect wife[43]. Such is life.\n\nDay 11 – Tuesday, May 31st – Cape Crusaders\n\nCape Town is nice. It’s very clean, modern, and very different from Johannesburg. Sai thought it looked fake, but gladly opted for this fraud over the ugly reality of the larger city where we started this trip. The V&A Waterfront proved to be the perfect base for our tourist operation; plenty of shopping (for her), dining (for both), water activities (such as a sunset cruise, if you will, whale watching if you want (assuming your wife wants it too), etc.), and easy access for the tours that follow.\n\nWe utilized the hop-on, hop-off city bus tour to peruse the pretty city. According to the audio guide, Cape Town has good feng shui, but we never had a chance to try it as we were more interested in eating African food. Table Mountain is the backdrop to everything, with its flat top flanked by Lion’s Head and Devil’s Peak (and no, I did not see the lion, nor the devil for that matter; just some big rocks). TM was our first hopping off point of interest. A week ago, or pretty much any other time, I would have made Sai trek up the mountain with me on one of its many trails. However, on this day, we took the cable car, as my legs were still feeling humbled from Sunday. When it first opened in 1929, the cable car was not very popular. Today, people are much lazier, so the six minute spinning cab to the top (the spinning part is pretty cool) tends to beat out the multi-hour hike more often than not. Sai was not complaining.\n\nOnce at the top, you are forced to brave the brutal elements on your own. This consists of walking across a relatively flat, broad ridge, taking pictures of the surrounding seas (Atlantic Ocean to the west, Table Bay to the north, Indian Ocean to the southeast) and city and beaches below, while bracing against some gusty winds. We’re such wimps (and gimps). The mountain is impressive, an outdoor person’s paradise, good for climbing, hiking, mountain biking, hang-gliding, or (in our lazy case) just cable car riding and hanging at the top with the dassies. Sai was initially afraid of the giant rats, which are actually badgers, related somehow to elephants (according to the audio guide). The wife had way too much energy bounding around on the mountaintop, while I winced with every small change in grade (not too bad on the flats); it was obvious that I should have made her hike up. Alas, we took the easy way back down too.\n\nThe tour bus brought us down on the backside of the mountain, where beautiful beaches run the coast, with pricy real estate on the water and up the side of the escarpment. We briefly hopped out at Camps Bay Beach, but were quickly accosted by too many “artists” hawking their handmade wares to stay for very long. The next bus couldn’t come soon enough. If you enjoy supporting starving artists, homeless sculptors, purveyors of cheap sunglasses, or other aggressively friendly touts, this is the place for you. To escape, Sai finally agreed to buy something, so we now have a little carved elephant that cost us all of 30 Rand (less than $2); we got off easy that time, and didn’t get off the bus again until we reached the city center.\n\nThe upper level of the double decker bus was more of a safe haven for Sai, as she did not feel the need to constantly ask if I’d locked the doors every time a suspicious looking person stood in the street. In Durban, she once feared a one-armed homeless woman who was carrying something in her single appendage. I was fairly confident that the lady wasn’t about to drop her worldly possessions and carjack us. On the bus, Sai may have still asked about locked doors, but I was too in tune with the jams playing on our earphones to heed her. Between historic tidbits, we were treated to South African rhythms including my new favorite Shosholoza and the Lion Sleeps Tonight (you know the “Wim-o-weh” song). Next best song was Mr. Mandela, wit"
