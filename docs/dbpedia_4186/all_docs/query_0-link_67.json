        "text": "Renos Nicos Spanoudes chats to Kylie Kaiser from By Kylie flowers,a bespoke, exclusive collection of flowers and arrangements created just for you. Inspired by love, every arrangement infused with passion.\n\nDon’t just give flowers, make it a message with meaning says florist By Kylie. Johannesburg: Nothing says ‘I love you’ quite like flowers. But an arrangement can say so much more than a single phrase, said florist Kylie Kaiser.\n\nFlowers have a language of their own, and scripting poetry from petals is as important as the decision to give someone flowers in the first place. She said: Flowers have a language of their own, and each type of flower conveys a different message. While red roses are often considered the traditional choice for Valentine’s Day, they are not the only option. In fact, there are many other flowers that can express your feelings just as beautifully, no matter what they’re for. While red roses are the stock standard for Valentine’s Day, for example, it should not exclude other flowers, arrangements that tell a story or a narrative. Kylie elaborated: Imagine thinking outside the box a bit, and telling a story with the arrangement that you select. Imagine picking the flowers, the colours and even the vessel they’re packaged in as part of a bigger story. This could be how a couple perhaps met, or the story of a stormy relationship that ended in unbridled romance, or a fairytale of love at first sight. Kylie said it doesn’t really matter what the story is, but while red roses always share deep love and passion, deeper meaning and personalised, creative interpretations of love could add deeper meaning to an arrangement. And it doesn’t have to break the bank, she added.\n\nhttps://www.bykylie.co.za/\n\nhttps://www.bykylie.co.za/Personalised-Hat-Box-p527506451\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/KylieButlerFloristry/\n\nFlowers by kylie (@flowers_by_kylie) ...\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes chats to celebrity chef Dario de Angeli who is renowned for the magical culinary experiences at Cube Kitchen and Est Est Alea. Clico Restaurant is now proud to announce their collaboration with Dario de Angeli.\n\nDario has introduced his new and exciting lunch and dinner menus at Clico Restaurant which will undoubtedly ‘wow’ the discerning diner.\n\nIn overseeing Clico’s operations as well as the F&B, Dario’s 30 years plus experience in the hotel, restaurant and hospitality industry both locally and internationally, will take Clico to new heights. His sound knowledge and understanding of implementing a full spectrum of management solutions, running small, medium and large production will elevate an already award-winning experience at Clico.\n\nHe may even include some dishes from his sell-out cookbook on the menu. Says Chef Dario of this exciting new collaboration: “I have cooked in deserts and 5-Star establishments, catered for celebrity functions and advised and assisted in the development of numerous brands. I have judged for Eat Out Magazine Awards and San Pellegrino Restaurant Top 50 Awards in my travels to 67 countries. Luckily, I still know the difference between Barolo and Burgundy, Islay and The Highlands and I am so ready to take on this new challenge with great gusto!”\n\nhttps://clico.co.za/dario-de-angeli/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B9AM0dxHI2K/\n\nhttps://mypr.co.za/clico-announces-exciting-collaboration-with-dario-de-angeli/\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.486328074763170&type=3&comment_id=486352988094012\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/dario-de-angeli-84b44524/?originalSubdomain=za\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes chats to actor, Yamikani Mahaka-Phiri, playing the role of Dino in Calling Us Home.

Be moved by the soaring music, drums that pulse the heartbeat of a continent, and by an amazing journey that will sweep you from the plains of Africa, across the sea, to the icy North of an American city.\n\nCalling Us Home is a story that tells of a great love, but it is also one that humbly yet firmly touches on some of humanity’s big issues, such as the plight of refugees, the many challenges women face and the need for greater empathy, understanding and care in an uncertain world.\n\nPlaying the lead role of Grace is Cape Town based Devonecia Swartz, with the roles of the American leads Rafael and Isabella being performed by Míchel Alejandro Castillo and Monica Tulia Ramirez respectively, both residing in New York, USA. They are ably supported by (in alphabetical order) Thokozani Jiyane (Nelson); Mthokozisi Emkay Khanyile (Ivan); Yamikani Mahaka-Phiri (Dino); Nobuntu Mpahlaza(Mother); René Setlhako (Lindiwe); Hanna So (Angie) and Micah Stojakovic (Ben).

TechMarkit takes the sting out of back-to-school shopping. A new year brings plenty of opportunities to start afresh, but also a long list of back-to-school and student must-haves from a tech perspective, including laptops, tablets and cellphones. TechMarkit really shines with their wide range of pre-owned and reconditioned laptops, tablets, cellphones and Kindles from both its store in Rosebank Mall and their user-friendly website.\n\nCustomers buying or trading in devices at TechMarkit can be assured of both credibility and integrity, which are integral parts of the TechMarkit DNA. Another noteworthy aspect of the TechMarkit experience is trading in old devices to be repurposed and given back to the community. Hirsch call this the ‘circular economy’, where devices are refurbished and reconditioned to ensure that more people have access to affordable, high-quality devices. TechMarkit has been trading online since November 2021 but opened its bricks and mortar store in Rosebank Mall in May 2022 where one-on-one discussions with knowledgeable staff ensure you leave with exactly what you need without breaking the bank.\n\nVisit the first TechMarkit store at Rosebank Mall located at 50 Bath Avenue, Rosebank, Johannesburg. For more information on a world of shopping splendour, visit their website.\n\nLocation: Level 3, Shop No. 314 Rosebank Mall, (opposite SOKO Dsitrict)\n\nLandline: 087 059 5500\n\nEmail: rosebank@techmarkit.co.za\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes shares Katerina Simboni Paraskevas’ tribute for this week which features various Soccer Stadium slogans which have been turned into songs and each has its own history.\n\nSlogans declaring loyalty and love for the team, slogans against opponents, lyrical slogans, sarcastic slogans, insulting slogans, slogans that give colour to a struggle.\n\nMany, perhaps, wonder what to be the main source of inspiration of the \"poets of the tribune\". Certainly the adoration towards the club, given the love for the players, certainly the feeling of rivalry are what bring the lyrical inspiration. But what about the rhythm? Here, very often, come recorded songs and big hits to lend their melody.\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes chats to Darren Meltz about Queer Chorus.\n\nThe Johannesburg Queer Chorus is a 54-member strong ensemble for the LGBTQ community and its friends — meaning anybody who sees themself as an ally is welcome to join.\n\nThe JQC will have one more performance this year and will hold another round of auditions at the beginning of next year for prospective members.\n\nFor their upcoming festive performance, Starry Sky, they’ve prepared some Christmas carols, some usual numbers — even a song about Hanukkah.

Kaige says “Music has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, I grew up playing the guitar, reading sheet music and learnt how to DJ at the age of 12. It is something that was always a part of my life however with tennis being my main point of interest, music took a back seat,” says Bertasso who gained notoriety when he became the first contestant on M-Net’s popular reality TV series, Love Island SA, to leave the show voluntarily, due to his mental health which was the reason for his departure.\n\nChasing his passion has led him to the release of his debut single. Bertasso believes in the importance of music having a deeper meaning behind it and credits this belief for his unique sound.\n\n“The single is an electronic dance song with a touch of house music. It masks the pain in the beginning and allows for a happy build into Finding Me. This summer hit will have people bobbing their heads as it echoes familiar narratives with them. Making this track has grown me and that growth has seamlessly infused itself into the sound which represents the cycle of growth. When we find our healing, we find our happiness.” says Bertasso.\n\n“What I’m most excited about is for people to hear and know my story. I like most of us have been through so much and the hard part of it has birthed this creativity within me. I want people to know that they are not alone and they too can find happiness even in the worst.”\n\nFinding Me is available on all major digital platforms now.\n\nYou can stream the single here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=rAc4VFlG4ng\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA DETAILS:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/land_of_kaige/?hl=en\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes interviews Durban-based actress, Katishcka Kiara, who portrays the role of Pauline in the Netflix series, Blood & Water. She is a 24-year-old South African actress, model and influencer who studied at AFDA Durban, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Live Performance.\n\nKatishchka plays the character of Pauline. She has subsequently shot another Netflix series (post-filming season three of Blood & Water in March-May 2022). The upcoming Netflix series, 'The Hive' is directed by Gareth Crocker & Nick Wolmarans. This is set to air in 2023 on Netflix. Increased accurate representation of Indian females in the media and entertainment industry is one of the main reasons that Katishcka got into the industry. She wants to add to the inclusion of Indian faces and Indian stories into narratives and represent them authentically. She is currently the only Indian cast member in the main cast of 'Blood & Water'.\n\nAfter graduating, Katishcka starred in the short film, 'Slumber Party' directed by Palesa Lebona which was part of the National Film and Video Foundation's Female Filmmaker's Project. The film aired on SABC 1 in 2019 and is currently available for streaming on Showmax.\n\nHer big break came in 2021 when she was cast in the second season of 'Blood & Water' on Netflix; a highly successful Netflix South Africa original that aired worldwide and was trending in the top 10 shows on Netflix internationally.\n\nKatishcka has also starred in a featured role in an upcoming Amazon series, 'The Power' which is created by the creators of 'The Handmaid's Tale'.\n\nOn the content creation and influencer front, Katishcka collaborates and partners with brands like Netflix, Sorbet, Edgars, The ARC Store, Krispy Kreme, amongst others, to create content on Instagram and TikTok. Her TikTok following is at 11,2K and her highest viewed TikTok video is at 795K views; which is part of a popular content series that she created for TikTok called; “Indian Families”.\n\nKatishcka is currently based in Durban but frequently works in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Other hobbies include: being really good at accents (British, American, Australian, Indian, Irish), yoga/fitness and meditation.\n\nKatishcka is passionate about sharing her mental health journey with anxiety and depression and how spirituality and lifestyle changes have helped her.\n\nhttps://www.timeslive.co.za/tshisa-live/tshisa-live/2021-09-20-durban-actress-a-new-face-on-netflix-hit-series-blood--water/\n\nKatishcka Kiara (@katishcka) • Instagram photos and videos\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/katishcka/\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes chats to Des Lidberg about his new book Every Day Is An Opening Night - Our Journey Together (Paperback).\n\nBoth a deeply personal memoir and a glimpse into their socio- political activism, Every Day Is An Opening Night by Des and Dawn Lindberg documents the joys and challenges of a lifetime in South African theatre – as musicians, performers, song writers, stage designers, managers, impresarios and ultimately legends of the entertainment industry.\n\nThe book traces the duo’s 55-year career, from singing folk songs in the Troubadour coffee-bar in Johannesburg to taking their “Folk on Trek” shows on tour across South Africa and (then) Rhodesia, and producing and performing in major musicals all over southern Africa. Highlights of their story include their controversial multiracial production of Godspell, the duo’s legendary Sunday-night Soirées and the founding of the annual Naledi Theatre Awards, now in their 18th year.\n\nTheir story unfolds during a turbulent era in South Africa’s history: a time when local unrest, international opprobrium, sanctions and an intransigent government combined to create a challenging environment for artistes. Along the way, they worked with famous musicians, endured Special Branch attention, had their albums banned, won and lost court-cases… and quietly persevered, undaunted, as musical anti-apartheid activists. Their friends and collaborators constitute a roll call of some of the best-loved personalities in the arts and show business, from Jeremy Taylor and Mark Banks to Johnny Clegg and John Kani, with appearances by the legendary Taubie Kushlick, Pieter-Dirk Uys, author Gordon Forbes, pianist Richard Clayderman and UK comedian Spike Milligan. The reminiscences are told with a light touch – sometimes poignant, frequently funny – and enhanced by a generous gallery of photographs.\n\nWhile the original manuscript was completed before the tragic loss of Dawn in December 2020, the book now stands in honour of her life, telling the tale of two pioneers of South African entertainment in their own words. As Des writes in the coda: “If this book achieves nothing else, I am determined that it will help me to sign off on our story in a way that does justice to the extraordinary leader, wife, mother, partner and lover Dawn was. Our story is a joyful one, and we tell it together as a celebration of life.”\n\nhttps://www.loot.co.za/product/every-day-is-an-opening-night/vdmp-7280-g980\n\nhttps://www.desdawn.co.za/about-us/\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes chats to Josh Lindberg (Director) and Daniel Geddes (Actor) about the Olivier Award nominated play ‘Cruise' for six shows only at Theatre Linden in Johannesburg from Tuesday 6th – Sunday 11th December 2022.\n\nPresented by HIV@40 and starring Daniel Geddes, Cruise is “an emotional roller-coaster without ever once losing its hold on your attention” – Evening Standard. Cruise is the true story of what should have been Michael Spencer’s last night on earth. When diagnosed with HIV in 1984 , Michael is told he will have four years left to live. So, with the clock ticking, he and his partner Dave decide to sell their house, flog the car and spend everything and party like it is the last days of the world.\n\nThis play is an emotional rollercoaster at times and at others, an hilarious ode to gay culture in the 80’s and how AIDS changed the community forever. Its staging in South Africa is very appropriate, as 2022 marks the 40th anniversary of the arrival of the HIV /AIDS pandemic on the African continent.\n\nCruise opened in the West End of London in the thick of the Covid-19 Pandemic and was the first play to surface out of the pandemic. It ran for a month at The Duchess Theatre and due to popular demand and rave reviews, transferred to the Apollo Theatre in the West End, closing in September 2022. This South African production of Cruise is directed by Josh Lindberg, with original music by Roelof Colyn, set design by Wilhelm Disbergen, lighting by Jane Gosnell and produced by Colin Law with funding grants from the NAC , Department of Sports, Arts and Culture , PESP and AfroAsia Philanthropy (Thailand). Cruise stars the inimitable Daniel Geddes in the re-staging of the Jack Holden original work.\n\nDaniel Geddes adds; “I’m super excited and honoured to be sinking my teeth into this incredible role. This Olivier nominated play is so important, and I can’t wait for South African audiences to see Jack’s amazing work for the first time this December.”\n\nJack Holden is delighted that the South African premiere of Cruise is the first international production of his play. Cruise runs at Theatre Linden, Johannesburg from Tuesday 6th December – Sunday 11th December for 6 shows only. Performances from Tuesday – Saturday at 19h30, Sunday at 14h30.\n\nTickets are R200 and bookings are via Quicket. There is a 10% discount available for Pensioners and Students. The production runs for 90 minutes with no interval. No under 16s.\n\nhttps://www.inyourpocket.com/johannesburg/cruise-at-theatre-linden_27578e\n\nhttps://www.quicket.co.za/events/196625-cruise/?ref=events-list#/\n\nthetheatrelinden.co.za/facebook.com/thetheatrelinden\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes chats to Nadia Virasamy, about Moving into Dance which celebrates the Katlehong Community Dance Initiative (KCDI) on December 3rd.\n\nThe Katlehong Community Dance Initiative (KCDI) is a partnership between acclaimed dance training provider and professional dance company, the Moving into Dance Trust (a Non-for-profit) and the Ithuba Community College (ICC). Situated with the community, ICC has been a beacon of hope for academically minded youngsters who are striving to go beyond their current socio-economic situations.\n\nNadia Virasamy, CEO of MID said: “The KCDI was essentially about providing children and youth in the area a form of recreation through dance also to inspire them to drive employment opportunities through the performing arts. This is what we set out to do ad this is what we have achieved. Having worked with more than 800 children and youth per week has truly gone beyond all our expectations but it has shown us the hunger for the arts in the area”.\n\nThe project for this year draws to a close in December and will be celebrated through a final performance at the Zonkizizwe Community Hall on 3 December 2022 at 13h00 called Dance Katlehong! Entrance is free.\n\nThe community is encouraged to show their support to the youth of Katlehong by attending.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Movingintodance78/\n\n#IVET\n\n#entrepreneurshipeducation\n\n#primaryschool #ICCJHB\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes chats to Marcel Meyer about Star+Crossed during Saturday’s Role.\n\nAbrahamse & Meyer Productions and VR Theatrical join forces to present the world première of a thrilling new musical, Star+Crossed, inspired by the life of one of South Africa’s most eccentric daughters, Elizabeth Klarer, at the Artscape Arena from 9 - 31 December 2022.\n\nKlarer gained fame and notoriety during the height of apartheid with her incredible claim that she was abducted by an Alien from the foothills of the Drakensberg, transported to his Utopian planet in the Alpha Centauri System, where she bore him a son, before returning to earth, to spread his message of love, compassion, and his urgent call to protect our planet and find more sustainable ways of living here on earth.\n\nSpanning almost nine decades, from 1910, with the formation of the Union of South Africa, until 1994, when Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa’s first democratically elected president, Star+Crossed explores how we use stories and fantasies to transmute a dark, barren world into something more meaningful, mythic, and beautiful.\n\nThe musical, with book and lyrics by Marcel Meyer and music by Wessel Odendaal, centres on two unlikely people finding each other in extraordinary circumstances while forging a profound connection that transcends, time, space, and South Africa’s oppressive apartheid laws. An interstellar love story for the ages with a lush, romantic, original score that is bound to transport audiences to the stratosphere and beyond.\n\nStar+Crossed runs from 9 - 31 December 2022 in the Artscape Arena, Cape Town.\n\nPerformances are Tuesdays – Saturdays at 8pm, with additional matinee performances on Saturdays and Sundays at 2pm.

Today it boasts an entrepreneurial spirit with a craft industry, a local community work programme centred around food gardens and a tourism association led by local tour operator Kwame Moroeng, who carries the history of Munsieville in his bones.\n\nPartnering with the Cradle of Humankind, The Cradle Tourism Company (TCTC), Mogale City local municipality and the Economic Development arm of Gauteng provincial government, Munsieville will host a market and kids day on December 3rd at the Munsieville Sports Complex from 10:00 – 15:00.\n\nThe market, organised by the innovative team from Locrate Markets, supports local crafters and entrepreneurs and there will also be a kiddies soccer tournament, a music festival and business talks.

Two staff members and an alumnus from the Faculty of Arts and Design, Pfunzo Sidogi (Fine and Studio Arts), Dr Anna-Marie Jansen van Vuuren (Visual Communication), and Katlego Chale (actor, playwright, and former student of the Department of Performing Arts), have contributed chapters to a new book, Public Intellectuals in South Africa: Critical Voices from the Past, published by Wits University Press.\n\nIn summarizing the book, Sidogi and Dr Jansen van Vuuren say: “This edited volume engages with the currents and histories of public intellectualism in South Africa. It uses Edward Said’s definition of a public intellectual as ‘someone who uses accessible language to address a designated public of social and political significance.’ Although the book is not limited to cultural intellectuals, many of the chapters explore the content and legacies of South African public intellectuals who focussed on the arts and cultural spheres. This list includes both well-known and marginalised figures: Magema Fuze, John Dube, Aggrey Klaaste, Mewa Ramgobin, Koos Roets, Elijah Makiwane, Mandisi Sindo, William Pretorius, and Dr Thomas Duncan Greenlees,” they add.\n\nIn his chapter, Sidogi explores the emergence of what he has termed Black Art Criticism in The Bantu World newspaper during the 1930s. “The Bantu World newspaper was the most influential and widely circulated publication among Black people in South Africa during the mid-twentieth century. By using The Bantu World as a case study, I chronicle the early manifestation of visual arts journalism produced by Black writers who were interested in the development of art created by Black artists during the 1930s and beyond,” says Sidogi.\n\nDr Jansen van Vuuren, film critic and Screenwriting lecturer at the Department of Visual Communication, contributed a chapter titled ‘Kaalgat Critique’: The Public Intellectualism of Koos Roets as Afrikaans Satirist.\n\nFor more information about the book, visit https://witspress.co.za/catalogue/public-intellectuals-in-south-africa/\n\nhttps://www.tut.ac.za/news-and-press/article?NID=481\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes chats to Steven Stead about Sinbad the Sailor which docks at the Teatro this Festive Season.\n\nTeaming up with Kickstart Productions, the popular Durban based Theatre Company will present a fun-filled family pantomime for the festive season, Sinbad The Sailor at the Teatro, Montecasino from 19 November to 23 December 2022.\n\nIt is a riotous romp over the Seven Seas, in the company of the famous sailor, Sinbad, and his madcap crew and family! With gloriously colourful sets and costumes that evoke the exotic mystery and magic of the Arabian Nights, and exciting music and dance, inspired by Bollywood, this is a unique, unforgettable pantomime experience for the entire family.\n\nKickstart Theatre Company is famous for its holiday pantomimes and this year is no different. The 16-strong cast features some of the creams of South Africa’s talent. Sinbad features newcomer Micah Stojakovic in the title role, Schoeman Smit as Dame Donna Kebab, Murray Todd as Long John Slither and Samantha Peo as Morgiana the Magnificent. The delightful heroine of the piece is Princess Marina (Kiruna-Lind Devar), and the magical larger-than-life Genie of the Seven Seas is played by Yamikani Phiri with Lelo Ramasimong as the no-nonsense Ameena; Sandi Dlangalala as the deliciously vague Silly Billy Souvlaki; and Mthokozisi Zulu as the trusty pirate sidekick, Mustapha Kitkat.

Horton must protect his friend Jojo and other Whos from a world of naysayers and dangers. He must also guard an abandoned egg that's been left in his care by the irresponsible Mayzie La Bird. Although Horton faces ridicule, danger and a trial, the brave Gertrude McFuzz never loses faith in him. The powers of friendship, loyalty, family and community are challenged and ultimately emerge triumphant!\n\nAnd true to all Dr Seuss stories, audiences discover what it takes for Horton to withstand ridicule and danger to save the day, during an unforgettable tale of adventure, heroism, perseverance and loyalty.\n\nhttps://www.broadwayworld.com/south-africa/article/National-Childrens-Theatre-to-Present-SEUSSICAL-JR-This-Month-20221017\n\nTo add to the excitement NCT will host a series of fun Seuss-tivities for children: face painting, word walls, selfies, as well as a Dr Seuss-themed children's costume contest and a colouring-in contest.\n\nWhen at NCT: 30 October to 22 Dec at NCT's Imagination Theatre, Parktown, Johannesburg\n\nBook NCT: Quicket - tickets are R140\n\nhttps://cloud.broadwayworld.com/rec/ticketclick.cfm?fromlink=2203744®id=157&articlelink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quicket.co.za%2Fevents%2F174004-seussical-jr?\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes chats to musician and producer Johathan Rubain about the Hallelujah Arts Festival coming to Cape Town.\n\nThe inaugural Hallelujah Arts Festival comes to Cape Town this November with three jam-packed days of Praise and performance.\n\nHanover Park-born musician and TV presenter, Jonathan Rubain, is set to host a special weekend of Praise and performances known as the inaugural Hallelujah Arts Festival, which will take place in The Mother City this November. Rubain has recently celebrated shooting the 100th episode of his popular show, Koortjies Met Jonathan and is ready for even bigger things with this very unique gospel music festival. He will be hosting a weekend of Gospel, Jazz, Spiritual Dance, Comedy, and Praise & Worship in celebration of South Africa's unique culture at the Good Hope Christian Centre in Ottery on 25, 26 and 27 November. “The Hallelujah Arts Festival aims to host a variety of different shows all packed into one weekend,” said the multi-talented 38-year-old. “It has always been a dream of mine to host a Gospel festival. This will be the inaugural festival and I hope to take it to Pretoria next year. Our country needs more Gospel festivals. There are all kinds of festivals happening around the country but hardly Gospel festivals. I aim to reach the young and the old at this festival,” he said, calling on all South Africans to make their way to Cape Town on this special weekend.\n\nThe festival will run over three days starting with a night of Spiritual Dancing which will be directed by Lauren George of Prophetic Dance Ministries. The Saturday afternoon will be devoted to Praise and Worship by Durban-based and multi-award-winning Gospel artist Dumi Mkokstad. Saturday evening sees the multi-talented Justin-Lee Schultz take to the stage with his band, all the way from the USA. Audiences will see Kyle Shepherd on Keys, Don Vino on Saxophone, Cameron Ward on Guitars, Jonathan Rubain on Bass and Keith De Bruyn on Drums.\n\nSunday afternoon is a special one as comedian Marc Lottering does his first Christian comedy set. This promises to be special to both Marc and the audience as Marc grew up in church with his parents being the Pastors of the church. Sunday evening will see the end of the festival with a Pinkster concert with many of the country's favourite Pinkster artists like Jonathan Rubain, Pastor Roland Miggels, Kurt Coetzee, David Jantjies and many more.\n\nEVENT DETAILS:\n\nVenue: Good Hope Christian Centre in Ottery\n\nAddress: Plantation Rd & Panton Rd, Ferness, Cape Town, 7800\n\nTicket prices: Tickets are available now at Computicket at R150 per show.

They have performed on most well-known festival stages, countless dives and the odd train platform across the country. Songs flow seamlessly from a low tide of alternative/gothic folk to a high of progressive rock, with iconic vocal harmony, narrative lyrics and intricate instrumentation all present across this shore. The Fishwives’ debut album, 'ALGAE' was released in 2019, and has been described as echoing an entire 70's record collection without trying to reproduce what was.\n\nThe band is fronted by Lizzie Gaisford and Sarah-leigh Burger. Both write the songs, occasionally in collaboration, and alternate lead and backing vocals. Burger is chief guitarist, also picking up mandolin and ukulele, and Gaisford moves between guitar, keys and accordion. Powering the music are Strato Copteros on drums and Anton Brink on fretless bass – a rhythm section brotherhood spanning 13 years, with roots in the Eastern Cape blues outift, ‘SunshiP.’\n\nIn Fluorescence\n\nThe EP ‘In Fluorescence’ was recorded by Jo Ellis at Blue Room Studios, Ladismith, Klein Karoo. The title is a cumulation of references to the artwork and all four songs: reflection and refraction, moonlit waves, luminescent marine life, flowerheads, as well as the artificial light of places where certain song-characters might be institutionalised.\n\nIt opens with the eponymous ‘The Fishwife Song,’ a lament loosely referring to Hokusai’s shunga design, ‘The Dream of the Fisherman’s Wife.’ Second is the whimsical, melancholic abstract ‘Moon,’ followed by a tongue-in-cheek blues account of a femme fatale going by the name of ‘Daisy.’ The EP closes with the climactic ‘Same Day’ – somewhat prophetic in theme to the lockdown experience.\n\nThese are four of the band’s oldest songs and were present on the setlists of Burger and Gaisford’s earliest duo performances. Thus, they have been worked and reworked extensively, and have been influenced by past collaborations, manifestations and have been moulded by the development in the band’s style.\n\n‘In Fluorescence’ was released at the National Arts Festival, Makhanda and is initially available on Bandcamp. It will be released on all streaming platforms on 16 December.\n\nSongwriting Credits:\n\nThe Fishwife Song: Lizzie Gaisford\n\nMoon: Sarah-leigh Burger\n\nDaisy: Sarah-leigh Burger\n\nSame Day: Sarah-leigh Burger\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thefishwives/\n\nsadiethegoatfish@gmail.com\n\nlinktr.ee/fishwivesband\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nDuring Saturday’s Role, Renos Nicos Spanoudes chats to Frank Masilela about the Youth & Work/Housing Nexus and the Them Again Collective.\n\nThe Youth and the work/housing nexus in Ethiopia and South Africa is a collaborative research project between the University of Sheffield (UK), The University of Witwatersrand (Johannesburg, South Africa) and The University of Hawassa (Hawassa, Ethiopia). Ethiopia and South Africa’s youth experience high unemployment and lack affordable housing. Ethiopia recently invested in Africa’s largest industrial complex in Hawassa, yet low wages and scarce housing prohibits sustainable futures for young workers. Labour turnover is very high.\n\nIn South Africa, wavering historic investment in Ekangala, Bronkhorstspruit, a former industrial decentralisation site, means high youth unemployment. Successful provision\n\nof state housing means some youth are housed, but cannot afford living costs. Faced with this wicked problem youth respond creatively to manage these near-impossible fluid conditions. The relationship between youth, work and housing is under-theorised, particularly in terms of youth and state/private sector’s responses. Focusing on these two cases of state intervention, this study examines the youth work/housing nexus, asking how this nexus is experienced, what are the key challenges, what are the responses of youth and state/private sector actors, and what are the implications for youth futures and urban sustainability.\n\nThe research outcomes will be presented at Masakhane Hall in Ekangala on November 5th 2022 and will then be presented in the Fassler Gallery, inside the John Moffat building at the University of the Witwatersrand from November 8th to November 15th 2022. The research will be presented in the form of an exhibition, which will include various media outputs developed by the youth representatives from Ekangala. Outputs include illustrated publications as well as a podcast, spoken word poem, song and video - all of which offer insight into the experiences and lives of young people living in Ekangala.\n\nThem Again Collective\n\ninfo@themagaincollective.com\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nDuring Saturday’s Role, Renos Nicos Spanoudes chats to owner of the boutique winery Onoma.\n\nÒnoma Private Cellar is a family owned and operated boutique winery nestled at the foot of the Stellenbosch Hills on Felicia Farm. The farm was purchased by the Yiannakis family in 1999 and in the years that followed, Com Yiannakis produced excellent quality grapes which were sold on to the larger estates in the area.\n\nWith farming in their blood, the farm was intended as a retirement lifestyle project for the family. Sadly, Com Yiannakis passed away before the family could realise their dream of creating their own private wine label. His son Blaise who has a law degree under his belt, ex art and diamond dealer aptly selected the wines which were maturing in barrel at the time of his father’s passing to be Ònoma Private Cellar’s hallmark release.\n\nHis brief to Ònoma’s winemaker, Matthew van Heerden, was to create classic wines in the Greek winemaking tradition: “Simply put, we wanted Ònoma Private Cellar wines to be made with no elaborate fuss, allowing the quality of the grapes to shine through. Our winemaker executed this brilliantly. We are very proud that we have not compromised quality in search of profit.”\n\nThis is evidenced in the number of accolades already racked up by their wines in only four short years since release:\n\nSyrah 2021 was awarded a Double Gold – Michelangelo Wine Awards 2022\n\nCabernet Sauvignon 2018 has a 4.5-star Platter 2022rating and was awarded Gold in the Michelangelo Wine Awards 2021\n\nChardonnay 2018 boasts a 4-star Platter 2021\n\nCabernet Sauvignon 2017 has earned a 4-star Platter 2022 and Gold in the Michelangelo Wine Awards 2021\n\nÒnoma 2016 Chardonnay was awarded Double Gold in the Michelangelo Wine Awards 2019\n\nhttps://throughmywineglass.co.za/onoma-private-cellar-blazing-a-trail-in-the-wine-industry/\n\nhttps://miziziyangu.com/2022/10/24/onoma-private-cellar-blazing-a-trail-in-the-wine-industry/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OnomaWines/\n\nÒnoma Private Cellar (@onoma_privatecellar) • Instagram\n\nRenos Nicos Spanoudes chats to Vash Singh about Alladin and his Wonderful Lamp during Saturday’s Role on Hellenic Radio.

Part love poem, part surrealist narrative, and part philosophical treatise, Fanon’s play reads as a testimony to the power and possibilities of love as an act of resistance. This contemporary reimagining of the text explores the edge between love, shadow and violence.\n\nTamara Guhrs and Stacy Hardy join forces with KwaSha, the Market Theatre Lab and Windybrow Arts Centre, to present this work at a time when Fanon’s writing has new relevance for a generation of young South Africans questioning the limits and possibilities of revolution today.\n\nThe Drowning Eye is performed in the midst of the exhibition, Revolutionary Love, which seeks to explore the role of historical loves within revolutionary movements. Both works are made possible by funding from the French Institute South Africa (IFAS) and Mazarz, with additional research supported by the Neubauer Collegium for Culture & Society, University of Chicago.\n\nhttps://www.webtickets.co.za/V2/Event.aspx?itemid=1519174058\n\nhttps://markettheatre.co.za/the-drowning-eye/\n\nListen to the interview with Tamara Guhrs here:\n\nOn Saturday morning’s edition of Saturday’s Role With Reno, host Renos Nicos Spanoudes spoke to Gregg Homann about a thrilling new version of Eugene Ionesco’s gripping play ‘The Lesson’ at The Market Theatre. “The Lesson” by Greg Homann stars theatre veterans Graham Hopkins and Fiona Ramsay alongside newcomer Lihle Ngubo.\n\nThis thrilling new version of Eugène Ionesco’s gripping play is based on a translation by Donald Watson. It is a darkly entertaining theatre production about enforcing power by using knowledge and culture as a weapon. Set in a small university town, an eager eighteen-year-old student arrives at the Professor’s home for a lesson. The action begins in a naturalistic way but shifts into a stylistic and visual feast as more surrealist and absurdist events take hold. What starts as a farcical interaction between the two becomes something more sinister.\n\nDon’t miss this funny, breath-taking and chilling look at what happens when power, knowledge and culture collide.\n\nThe Market Theatre\n\n9 to 30 October 2022\n\nBook now at webtickets!\n\nhttps://www.newslink.co.za/2022/10/05/eugene-ionescos-the-lesson-by-greg-homann/\n\nGreg Homann (@greghomann) / Twitter\n\nListen to the interview with Greg Homann here:\n\nOn Saturday morning’s edition of Saturday’s Role With Reno, host Renos Spanoudes spoke to Eva Meklis Mazza about Sex, Lies & Alibis, a much anticipated final installment in Eva Mazza's “sex-trilogy”. Following hot on the heels of the bestsellers Sex, Lies & Stellenbosch and its sequel, Sex, Lies, Declassified, this one promises to be December’s hottest read. Like the most addictive of Netflix series, Alibis, with its many twist and turns, will have readers turning pages in anticipation to discover what finally happens to our heroine, Jen and the rest of the sometimes sexy, and always dysfunctional cast from Stellenbosch, with its penchant for impropriety and unapologetic wealth.\n\nAfter stumbling on her adulterous husband, John, in book one, by the time Jen gets to the final part of the trilogy, she's discovered that happy endings don’t necessarily come in the form of a man, no matter how good the sex or how exquisite the backdrop. Despite trying to escape her past by flying to Monte Carlo where she's landed a million dollar contract to re-design the interior of a superyacht, circumstances beyond her control force her to return to the Stellenbosch winelands. Now it's time for Jen to confront the sex, the lies, the declassified scandals and uncover the made-up alibis.\n\nThe steamiest book you'll read this summer!\n\nEva Meklis Mazza (@meklismazza)\n\nhttps://www.nb.co.za/en/view-book?id=9781990973604\n\nListen to the interview with Eva Meklis Mazza here:"
