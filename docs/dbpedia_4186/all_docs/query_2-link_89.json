        "text": "High-riding SA recordbreaker and national champion jockey elect Richard Fourie will partner recent WSB Gr2 1900 winner Future Swing for Justin Snaith in the forthcoming R5 million Hollywoodbets Gr1 Durban July.\n\nRichard Fourie won the Durban July in 2014 on Legislate, in 2019 on Do It Again and in 2020 on Belgarion.\n\nAll three were trained by SA Champion Justin Snaith, and the 38 year old jockey is sticking to a tried and trusted recipe as he bids for a fourth victory in the great race on 6 July.\n\n“Richard has partnered Future Swing particularly well and he is the perfect rider for this son of Futura – our horse likes to be up on the pace, with a good turn-of-foot as he is a relentless galloper. He’s as honest as they come and with a weight of 54kg, he has to be a serious contender,” Justin Snaith told the Sporting Post on Monday.\n\nBred by Drakenstein, Future Swing is a son of former SA Horse Of The Year Futura (Dynasty) out of the twice winning Carousel Swing, a daughter of retired champion Trippi (End Sweep).\n\nRaced in partnership by Drakenstein, Kalinga and Pamela Isdell, Future Swing is a R600 000 National Yearling Sale graduate and a winner of 7 races with 8 places from 17 starts for stakes of R1 119 850.\n\nFuture Swing is currently quoted at 25-2 in the Hollywoodbets Durban July ante-post betting market."
