        "text": "Brett Crawford Clinches Back-to-Back Wins at the 2024 HollywoodBets Durban July with Oriental Charm's Triumph\n\nBrett Crawford celebrated consecutive victories in the prestigious R5 Million Hollywoodbets Durban July as the three-year-old colt, Oriental Charm, secured a memorable win in the 128th edition of Africa's most renowned horse race. Owned by Greg Bortz, Leon Ellman, and Gina Goldsmith, Oriental Charm showcased exceptional prowess on the track.\n\nRidden by JP van der Merwe, Oriental Charm took an early lead shortly after the start. Van der Merwe's daring strategy paid off as the colt maintained his position, fending off challenges from outsider Cousin Casey, Royal Victory, and Flag Man.\n\nDespite being the top weight, See It Again encountered some misfortune due to scrimmaging around the 1400m mark. Jockey Piere Strydom had to check his mount's pace as Oriental Charm cut across his path near the finish line, impacting See It Again's run.\n\nThe race favorite, Green With Envy, had every opportunity but was unable to close the gap, finishing two lengths behind Oriental Charm.\n\nCrawford's meticulous planning for Oriental Charm mirrored the preparation for last year's winner, Winchester Mansion. Oriental Charm finished second in the Gr2 WSB 1900 and clinched victory in the G3 Hollywoodbets Dolphins Cup Trial, paving the way for this stunning Durban July win.\n\nA crowd of over 40,000 attendees enjoyed the thrilling race day, highlighted by a performance from South African supergroup Mango Groove, who also performed the National Anthem."
