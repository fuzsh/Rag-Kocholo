        "text": "Special effects were great in this piece! I need to definitely get with you, because that stuff is great. I liked the story and the movie. There were few problems I saw. The acting in the cpu room with the couple didn't seem to have the same urgency the match the situation at hand. The guy's acting initially wasn't strong (from his first words), but I did feel like it got better in the scene. There was another part with the Dr. (gas mask guy) was talking to the wife - the voice sounded bad or wrong or something. I think you could add that typical sort of gas mask talk and breathing that we always hear and that will fix that. I've never done that before, so I don't how to do it, but I just think it would add more to that scene.\n\nOther than that, I did like the cinematography, editing and the music. This was very ambitious and I'm impressed to know you shot it on the HV20. I'll PM you with more questions. Good job on this.\n\nThe acting was a bit unbalanced in spots... and IMO it is due to poorly written dialog. I think you (as a director) capture some terrific moments, but I think you would do really well to team up with someone as a scriptwriter, specifically for some of the dialog. Again, your stories are also terrific and compelling, but the dialog just wasn't there for me.\n\nMuaha. Grammar Police are on your trail!! Just messin'...\n\nDialogue.\n\nThanks Robert and Stephen! I'm glad you enjoyed it.\n\nBrandon... Thank you! I'm glad you liked the score. That was actually the easiest part of this process. Overall, i felt the dialog worked and I'm very happy with the way it turned out. With every film, i learn new things... and the crits I've gotten so far will most definitely help me with my next film.\n\nKeep em' rollin.\n\n/j\n\nDialogue is probably the hardest part of a script to write. It's rare to hear anything that isn't written by a seasoned professional (aka paid and produced) that sounds right. No worries, we live and learn. Keep going, dude.\n\nHey! This was very slick - very professional. And wow the location is amazing - looked great - sounded great - technically I couldn't fault it. The last shot was particularly easy on the eyes - reminded me of the final scene in Fight Club somewhat - just visually of course.\n\nThe dialogue, although not my cup of tea, suited the genre and style and worked in the context of this movie. It was a little bit 'sci-fi by numbers' but you certainly hit every beat.\n\nWould like to see this dirtied up a bit I think - it's all so pretty and polished - you could take it to another level by taking a risk or two - maybe if you actually involved the kid in the story? If we actually saw him then it would be more affecting. I did feel for the female protagonist though - you made the right choice concentrating on her.\n\nSo yep - really good job but don't be afraid to play with genre - take more risks and mess with expectations - you've obviously got the technical stuff down so just focus on the heart of the film and what you're trying to say and you'll really be onto something!\n\nJustin, this is my favorite work I've seen from you by far. The VFX were excellent and well thought out in regards to their subtlety and mixture into the story. I'm on a little on the fence with the story and performances...it's very dramatic in the dialogue which took me out of it at times, perhaps a little too preachy? It might just be me, but the only time I can relate to characters speaking in 'epic' finite terms in when I've been with them for a long time or they're communicating that message through simple, non-dramatic acting. (Think of when Bruce Wayne decides to leave Gotham in Batman Begins, he just hands the guy that coat and says \"be careful...they're going to come looking for me...who?...everyone\") I think that's the best way I can explain my point there.\n\nThe VFX rock and it's awesome how you did some of these set extensions. The bridge/walkway was amazing as is that final shot of the woman looking out that wide window... but I feel like those set pieces contrast so heavily against the kitchen and this guy's office... the kitchen, even with the holographic monitor, appears very out of place for me and takes me out of the world. With his office, it was a similar blow... he had those old CRT monitors and it just didn't feel real to me compared to the rest of the world and the scope of what was apparently happening. I'm sure the majority of this boils down to budget and time constraints... the VFX are insanely time consuming and I know good locations are often never free.\n\nAll in all, enjoyed this film man and it's in my top three. Keep up the good work.\n\nOkay, so I watched this last night and pen and inked some quick notes. Nothing too long, just something...quick.\n\nI first want to say that beyond the 3D stuff, I think I have tried every tutorial online that shows how to do some of your effects, lol. I'm a tutorial junky. But I love the way you worked the special effects into the film vice making the film about the special fx.\n\nFor an Indy Short, your 3D team did an awesome job.\n\nI agree on previous reviews about the Mahlen entrance, but you've gotten the point by now. Oh, and awesome costume. We used the 'old gas mask' look for one of the supers in Blackout for Lossfest.\n\nOn the whole, this was a good visual piece, though the story wasn't all that gripping. Not being negative, but the six minutes seemed like fifteen, and not in an overly good way. Don't get me wrong, I totally dug the film on the whole. It was a superior film in every regard. Just maybe a little more action.\n\nSo Kudos on a job well done!"
