        "text": "American singer and songwriter (born 1981)\n\nAlicia Augello Cook (born January 25, 1981),[3][4][5][6][7] known professionally as Alicia Keys, is an American singer and songwriter. A classically trained pianist, Keys began composing songs when she was the age of 12 and was signed by Columbia Records at the age of 15. After disputes with the label, she signed with J Records to release her debut studio album, Songs in A Minor (2001). Met with critical acclaim and commercial success, the album sold over 12 million copies worldwide and won five awards at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. It contained the Billboard Hot 100-number one single \"Fallin'.\" Her second album, The Diary of Alicia Keys (2003) was met with continued success, selling eight million units worldwide and spawning the singles \"You Don't Know My Name\", \"If I Ain't Got You\", and \"Diary\" (featuring Tony! Toni! Toné!).[8] Its release earned an additional four Grammy Awards.[9]\n\nHer 2004 duet with Usher, \"My Boo\", became her second number-one single. Keys' first live album, Unplugged (2005), spawned the single \"Unbreakable\" and made her the first female artist to have an MTV Unplugged project debut atop the Billboard 200. Her third album, As I Am (2007), sold seven million units worldwide and yielded her third Billboard Hot 100-number one single. \"No One.\" In 2007, Keys made her film debut in the action-thriller Smokin' Aces, and performed the theme song to the James Bond film Quantum of Solace with her single \"Another Way to Die\" (with Jack White) the following year.[10] Her fourth album, The Element of Freedom (2009), peaked the UK Albums Chart, sold four million copies worldwide, and was supported by the singles \"Doesn't Mean Anything\", \"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\", and \"Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready).\" That same year, her 2009 single \"Empire State of Mind\" (with Jay-Z) became her fourth number-one in the United States. Her fifth album, Girl on Fire (2012), became her fourth non-consecutive album to peak the Billboard 200 and was supported by its lead single of the same name; her sixth album, Here (2016), peaked at number two on the chart. Her seventh and eighth studio albums, Alicia (2020) and Keys (2021), spawned the singles \"Show Me Love\" (featuring Miguel), \"Underdog\", \"Lala\" and \"Best of Me\". Her first independent release, Santa Baby (2022), was a holiday album. In 2023, she wrote, composed and co-produced her first Broadway musical, Hell's Kitchen.\n\nKeys has sold over 90 million records worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. She was named by Billboard as the Top Artist of the 2000s in the R&B/Hip-Hop category,[11] and placed tenth on their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years. She has received numerous accolades in her career, including 16 Grammy Awards, 17 NAACP Image Awards, 12 ASCAP Awards, and an award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and National Music Publishers Association. VH1 included her on their 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and 100 Greatest Women in Music lists, while Time has named her in their 100 list of most influential people in 2005 and 2017. Keys is also acclaimed for her humanitarian work, philanthropy, and activism. She co-founded the nonprofit HIV/AIDS-fighting organization Keep a Child Alive in 2003, for which she serves as Global Ambassador.\n\nEarly life, family and education\n\n[edit]\n\nAlicia Augello Cook was born on January 25, 1981,[6][7] in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.[12][13] She is the only child of Teresa Augello, who was a paralegal and part-time actress, and one of three children of Craig Cook, who was a flight attendant.[14][15] Keys's father is African American and her mother is of Italian and \"Irish or Scottish\" descent; her mother's paternal grandparents were immigrants from Sciacca, Sicily;[16][17] and Lamezia Terme, in Calabria.[18] Named after her Puerto Rican godmother,[19] Keys has said that she was comfortable with her multiracial heritage because she felt she was able to \"relate to different cultures\".[12][20] Keys's father left when she was two years old. She was subsequently raised by her mother during her formative years at Manhattan Plaza[21] in Hell's Kitchen.[22] Keys has stated that her parents never had a relationship, and her father was not in her life.[23] Although she did not like to speak about her father in order to not feed stereotypes, Keys remarked in 2001: \"I'm not in contact with him. That's fine. When I was younger, I minded about that. [It] made me angry. But it helped show me what a strong woman my mother was, and made me want to be strong like her. Probably, it was better for me this way.\"[12] Keys and her mother lived in a one-bedroom apartment.[24] Her mother often worked three jobs to provide for Keys, who \"learned how to survive\" from her mother's example of tenacity and self-reliance.[25]\n\nFrom a young age, Keys struggled with self-esteem issues, hiding little by little when her differences made her vulnerable to judgment, and later uninvited sexual attention.[27][28][29] Living in the rough neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen,[22][23] she was, from an early age, regularly exposed to street violence, drugs, prostitution, and subjected to sexual propositions in the sex trade- and crime-riddled area.[29][30][31] \"I saw a variety of people growing up, and lifestyles, lows and highs. I think it makes you realize right away what you want and what you don't want,\" Keys said.[32] Keys recalled feeling fearful early on of the \"animal instinct\" she witnessed, and eventually feeling \"high\" due to recurrent harassment.[27][33] Her experiences in the streets had led her to carry a homemade knife for protection.[34][35] She became very wary,[35][36] emotionally guarded, and she began wearing gender-neutral clothing and what would become her trademark cornrows.[39] Keys explained that she is grateful for growing up where she did as it prepared her for the parallels in the music industry, particularly as she was a teenager starting out; she could maintain a particular focus and not derail herself.[29][40] She credits her \"tough\" mother for anchoring her on a right path as opposed to many people she knew who ended up on the wrong path and in jail. Keys attributed her unusual maturity as a young girl to her mother, who depended on her to be responsible while she worked to provide for them and gave Keys as many opportunities as possible.[35][36]\n\nKeys loved music and singing from early childhood. She recalled her mother playing jazz records of artists such as Thelonious Monk, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Louis Armstrong on Sunday mornings—early musical moments Keys considers influential in kindling her interest in and emotional connection to music.[12][25] In preschool, Keys sang in her school's production of the musical Cats and was cast as Dorothy Gale in a production of The Wizard of Oz.[41] Keys discovered that she had a passion for the piano by age six, as she loved the sound and feel of the instrument and desired to play and learn it.[26][42] When Keys was ten,[43] a neighborhood friend who was moving home gave her family an old upright piano. This proved pivotal for Keys's musical development, which allowed her to practice, to play, and to benefit fully from music lessons at an early age.[23] Keys began receiving classical piano training by age seven,[44] practicing six hours a day,[42] learning the Suzuki method and playing composers such as Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, and Satie.[23][45] She was particularly drawn to \"blue, dark, shadowy\" and melancholic compositions, as well as the passionate romanticism of \"blue composers\" like Chopin.[46] Inspired by the film Philadelphia, Keys wrote her first song about her departed grandfather on her piano by age 12. The scene in the film in which Tom Hanks's character listens to opera on a record player notably affected Keys, who \"never showed emotion very well\".[26] After seeing the film, Keys, \"for the first time, could express how [she] felt through the music.\"[23][42]\n\nKeys's mother had encouraged her to participate in different extracurricular activities, including music, dance, theater, and gymnastics, so she could \"find her muse\".[41][47] Her extracurricular activities gave her focus and drive, and helped keep her out of trouble.[34][42][45] Keys remained so occupied with her various pursuits that she experienced her first burnout before adolescence. Before her 13th birthday, she expressed to her mother that she was too overwhelmed and wanted to disengage, at which point her mother took some time off with her and encouraged her to keep focusing on piano.[41] Keys would continue studying classical music until the age of 18.[42] Keys regards her education in classical piano and dedication to classical music as vital for her stability in her youth and her development as a musician and songwriter.[12][26] Keys later said of her classical background:\n\nThat type of studying, that type of discipline ... after a while, I realized what it provided me – focus, the ability to pay attention for a long enough period of time to make progress; the work ethic; the actual knowledge of music, that then unlocked the ability to write my own music, put my own chords and things I heard in my own head to different lyrics that I maybe felt, and I never, ever had to wait for anybody to write something for me.[48]\n\nKeys enrolled in the Professional Performing Arts School at the age of 12, where she took music, dance, and theater classes and majored in choir.[29] In her preteen years, Keys and her bass-playing friend formed their first group, though neither \"knew too much about how pop songs worked\".[23][45] Keys would continue singing, writing songs, and performing in musical groups throughout junior high and high school.[25][41][44] She became an accomplished pianist; according to some sources, after her classical-music teacher had nothing left to teach her, she began studying jazz at age 14[47][49] (this claim, however, was challenged by Keys's music teacher herself).[50] Living in the \"musical melting pot\" city, Keys had already been discovering other genres of music, including soul music, hip hop, R&B, and taken affinity to artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield. Keen on dissecting music, Keys continued developing her songwriting and finding her own 'flow and style\" through her exploration of the intricacies in different music.[26][45][51]\n\nKeys spent more time in Harlem during her teenage years. She connected with the cultural and racial diversity in the neighborhood, where she expanded upon her musical exploration, and her character was also solidified. \"Harlem raised me in a lot of ways,\" Keys remarked. \"[It] taught me how to think fast, how to play the game ... taught me leadership, how to get out of bad situations when you need to, how to hold my own.\"[12][44] During this period, she met her good friend who would later become her long-term collaborator and boyfriend Kerry Brothers Jr., also famously known as Krucial.[25][44]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1985–1997\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1985, at the age of four, Keys appeared on The Cosby Show as Maria, one of Rudy's slumber-party friends.[52]\n\nIn 1994, manager Jeff Robinson met 13-year-old Keys, who participated in his brother's youth organization called Teens in Motion.[41][53] Robinson's brother had been giving Keys vocal lessons in Harlem.[42] His brother had talked to him about Keys and advised him to go see her, but Robinson shrugged it off as he had \"heard that story 1,000 times\". At the time, Keys was part of a three-member band that had formed in the Bronx and was performing in Harlem.[41][49] Robinson eventually agreed to his brother's request, and went to see Keys perform with her group at the Police Athletic League center in Harlem. He was soon taken by Keys, her soulful singing, playing contemporary and classical music and performing her own songs.[41][44] Robinson was excited by audiences' reactions to her. Impressed by her talents, charisma, image, and maturity, Robinson considered her to be the \"total package\", and took her under his wing.[47][49][53] By this time, Keys had already written two of the songs that she would later include on her debut album: \"Butterflyz\" and \"The Life\".[47][49]\n\nRobinson wanted Keys to be informed and prepared for the music industry, so he took her everywhere with him, including all the meetings with attorneys and negotiations with record labels, while the teenager often became disgruntled with the process.[41] Robinson had urged Keys to pursue a solo career, as she remained reluctant, preferring the musical interactions of a group. She took Robinson's advice after her group disbanded, and contacted Robinson who in 1995 introduced her to A&R executive Peter Edge.\n\nRobinson and Edge helped Keys assemble some demos of songs she had written and set up a showcases for label executives.[25][41][44] Keys performed on the piano for executives of various labels, and a bidding war ensued.[23][44] Edge was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company, Warner Bros. Records, to work at Clive Davis' Arista Records.[23][41][54] During this period, Columbia Records had approached Keys for a record deal, offering her a $26,000 white baby grand piano; after negotiations with her and her manager, she signed to the label, at age 15. Keys was also finishing high school, and her academic success had provided her opportunity for scholarship and early admission to university.[23][41][54] That year, Keys accepted a scholarship to study at Columbia University in Manhattan.[25] She graduated from high school early as valedictorian, at the age of 16, and began attending Columbia University at that age while working on her music.[23][47] Keys attempted to manage a difficult schedule between university and working in the studio into the morning, compounding stress and a distant relationship with her mother. She often stayed away from home, and wrote some of the most \"depressing\" poems of her life during this period. Keys decided to drop out of college after a month to pursue music full-time.[25][38][47]\n\nColumbia Records had recruited a team of songwriters, producers and stylists to work on Keys and her music. They wanted Keys to submit to their creative and image decisions.[25] Keys said they were not receptive to her contributions and being a musician and music creator.[47][48] While Keys worked on her songs, Columbia executives attempted to change her material; they wanted her to sing and have others create the music, forcing big-name producers on her who demanded she also write with people with whom she was not comfortable.[12][42] She would go into sessions already prepared with music she had composed, but the label would dismiss her work in favor of their vision.[48] \"It was a constant battle, it was a lot of -isms\", Keys recalled. \"There was the sexism, but it was more the ageism – you're too young, how could you possibly know what you want to do? – and oh God, that just irked me to death, I hated that.\"[25] \"The music coming out was very disappointing\", she recalled. \"You have this desire to have something good, and you have thoughts and ideas, but when you finish the music it's shit, and it keeps on going like that.\"[44] Keys would be in \"perpetual music industry purgatory\" under Columbia, while they ultimately \"relegated [her] to the shelf\".[49] She had performed \"Little Drummer Girl\" for So So Def's Christmas compilation in 1996,[49] and later co-wrote the song \"Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)\" for the Men in Black (1997) film soundtrack, the only released recording Keys made with Columbia.[38][42]\n\nKeys \"hated\" the experience of writing with the people Columbia brought in. \"I remember driving to the studio one day with dread in my chest,\" she recalled.[23] Keys said the producers would also sexually proposition her.[12][29][47] \"It's all over the place. And it's crazy. And it's very difficult to understand and handle,\" she said.[47] Keys had already built a \"protect yourself\" mentality from growing up in Hell's Kitchen, which served her as a young teen then in the industry having to rebuff the advances of producers and being around people who \"just wanted to use [her]\".[29][40] Keys felt like she could not show weakness.[29] Executives at Columbia also wanted to manufacture her image, with her \"hair blown out and flowing\", short dresses, and asking her to lose weight; \"they wanted me to be the same as everyone else,\" Keys felt.[23] \"I had horrible experiences,\" she recalled. \"They were so disrespectful ... I started figuring, 'Hey, nothing's worth all this.'\"[12] As months passed, Keys had grown more frustrated and depressed with the situation, while the label requested the finished tracks.[23][44][47] Keys recalled, \"it was around that time that I realized that I couldn't do it with other people. I had to do it more with myself, with the people that I felt comfortable with or by myself with my piano.\"[47] Keys decided to sit in with some producers and engineers to ask questions and watch them technically work on other artists' music.[44] \"The only way it would sound like anything I would be remotely proud of is if I did it,\" Keys determined. \"I already knew my way around the keyboard, so that was an advantage. And the rest was watching people work on other artists and watching how they layer things.\"[44]\n\nHer partner Kerry \"Krucial\" Brothers suggested to Keys she buy her own equipment and record on her own.[47] Keys began working separately from the label, exploring more production and engineering on her own with her own equipment.[44] She had moved out of her mother's apartment and into a sixth-floor walk-up apartment in Harlem with Brothers, where she fit a recording studio into their bedroom and worked on her music.[47] Keys felt being on her own was \"necessary\" for her sanity. She was \"going through a lot\" with herself and with her mother, and she \"needed the space\"; \"I needed to have my own thoughts, to do my own thing.\"[44] Keys and Brothers later moved to Queens and together they turned the basement into KrucialKeys Studios.[47] Keys would return to her mother's house periodically, particularly when she felt \"lost or unbalanced or alone\". \"She would probably be working and I would sit at the piano,\" she reminisced.[47] During this time, she composed the song \"Troubles\", which started as \"a conversation with God\", working on it further in Harlem. Around this time the album \"started coming together\", and she composed and recorded most of the songs that would appear on her album.[36][44][47] \"Finally, I knew how to structure my feelings into something that made sense, something that can translate to people\", Keys. \"That was a changing point. My confidence was up, way up.\"[44] The different experience reinvigorated Keys and her music.[47] While the album was nearly completed, Columbia's management changed and more creative differences emerged with the new executives. Keys brought her songs to the executives, who rejected her work, saying it \"sounded like one long demo\". They wanted Keys to sing over loops,[44] and told Keys they will bring in a \"top\" team and get her \"a more radio-friendly sound\". Keys would not allow it; \"they already had set the monster loose\", she recalled. \"Once I started producing my own stuff there wasn't any going back.\"[47] Keys stated that Columbia had the \"wrong vision\" for her. \"They didn't want me to be an individual, didn't really care,\" Keys concluded. \"They just wanted to put me in a box.\"[12] Control over her creative process was \"everything\" to Keys.[48]\n\nKeys had wanted to leave Columbia since they began \"completely disrespecting [her] musical creativity\".[23] Leaving Columbia was \"a hell of a fight,\" she recalled. \"Out of spite, they were threatening to keep everything I'd created even though they hated it. I thought I'd have to start over again just to get out, but I didn't care.\"[23] Keys said in 2001: \"It's been one trial, one test of confidence and faith after the next.\" To Keys, \"success doesn't just mean that I'm the singer, and you give me my 14 points, and that's all. That's not how it's going to go down.\"[55] Edge, who was by that time head of A&R at Arista Records,[25] said, \"I didn't see that there was much hands-on development at Columbia, and she was smart enough to figure that out and to ask to be released from her contract, which was a bold move for a new artist.\"[47] Edge introduced Keys to Arista's then-president, Clive Davis, in 1998.[25][56]\n\n1998–2002: Breakthrough with Songs in A Minor\n\n[edit]\n\nRobinson and Keys, with Davis's help, were able to negotiate out of the Columbia contract and she signed to Arista Records in late 1998.[42][47][54] Keys was also able to leave with the music she had created.[23] Davis gave Keys the creative freedom and control she wanted, and encouraged her to be herself.[12][56] Keys said of Davis's instinct: \"he knows which artists are the ones that maybe are needing to craft their own sound and style and songs, and you just have to let an artist go and find that space. And I think he somehow knew that and saw that in me and really just let me find that.\"[49] After signing with Davis, Keys continued honing her songs.[12] Keys almost chose Wilde as her stage name at the age of 16 until her manager suggested the name Keys after a dream he had. She felt that name embodied her both as a performer and person.[57] Keys contributed her songs \"Rock wit U\" and \"Rear View Mirror\" to the soundtracks of the films Shaft (2000) and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001).[58][59]\n\nIn 2000, Davis was ousted from Arista, and the release of Keys's album was put on hold. Later that year, Davis formed J Records and immediately signed Keys to the label.[23] \"He didn't try to divert me to something else,\" Keys said on following Davis to his new label. He understood that she wants to be herself and not \"made into what somebody else thinks I should be.\"[38]\n\nKeys played small shows across America, performed at industry showcases for months and then on television.[44][56] Davis thought \"pop stations might feel she's too urban. Urban might feel she's too traditional\", and as he felt Keys was a \"compelling, hypnotic performer\" best experienced in person, he had Keys perform her music to different crowds in different places to spread the word.[41][44][56] \"I created opportunities for those who saw her to spread the word\", Davis recalled. \"She is her own ambassador.\"[41] Davis wanted to \"let people discover her, and you can only do that with a few artists.\"[25][51] Keys later performed on The Tonight Show in promotion for her upcoming debut.[44] Davis wrote a letter to Oprah asking her to have Keys, Jill Scott, and India.Arie perform on her show to promote new women in music.[44] Oprah booked Keys the day she heard her song \"Fallin'\", her debut single.[12][41] Keys performed the song on Oprah's show the week prior to the release of her debut album.[49] \"Fallin'\", released as a single in April, went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and stayed atop the chart for six consecutive weeks.[49][60] Ebony magazine wrote that at the time \"the music that was pumping on the airwaves was hip-hop and rap – not Alicia's unique blend of classical meets soul, meets hip-hop, meets, well, Alicia. What could have been a recipe for disaster ... turned into the opportunity of a lifetime.\"[41] Keys as an artist since her early days, Davis said, \"does her own thing. She has set out her own vision. That's the way it is for artists of her ilk ... They don't try to fit in. They try to establish their own paths ... [she has] sure natural instinct and sure vision\" and \"a respect for musical history.\"[25][41]\n\nSongs in A Minor, which included material that Columbia Records had rejected, was released on June 5, 2001,[47][49] to critical acclaim.[63][64][65] Musically, it incorporated classical piano in an R&B, soul and jazz-fused album.[66] Jam! described the music as \"old-school urban sounds and attitude set against a backdrop of classical piano and sweet, warm vocals\".[67] USA Today wrote that Keys \"taps into the blues, soul, jazz and even classical music to propel haunting melodies and hard-driving funk\".[68] Songs in A Minor would be \"lauded for its mix of traditional soul values and city-girl coolness\", wrote The Guardian.[36] PopMatters wrote that \"Keys's Songs in A Minor is a testament to her desire (and patience) to create a project that most reflects her sensibilities as a 20-year-old woman and as a musical, cultural, and racial hybrid.\"[51]\n\nSongs in A Minor debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number one, selling 236,000 in its first week at retail.[22][49] In its second week, word of mouth and exposure from television performances was so significant that record stores requested another 450,000 copies.[44] The album went on to sell over 6.2 million copies in the United States and 12 million internationally.[69][70] It was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.[71][72] Songs in A Minor established Keys's popularity both inside and outside of the United States where she became the best-selling new artist and R&B artist of the year.[49][73]\n\nThe album's second single, \"A Woman's Worth\", was released in February 2002 and peaked at seven on the Hot 100 and number three on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs; becoming her second top ten single on both charts.[74] Released in June, \"How Come You Don't Call Me\", Keys's cover of Prince's song, served as the album's third single, peaking at 59 on the Hot 100.

The following year, the album was reissued as Remixed & Unplugged in A Minor, which included eight remixes and seven unplugged versions of the songs from the original.[75]\n\nSongs in A Minor received six Grammy Award nominations, including Record of the Year for \"Fallin'\". At the 2002 Grammy Awards, Keys won five awards: Song of the Year, Best Woman R&B Vocal Performance, and Best R&B Song for \"Fallin'\", Best New Artist, and Best R&B Album.[76] Keys tied Lauryn Hill's record for the most Grammy wins for a woman solo artist in a year.[23][77] That year, Keys wrote and produced the song \"Impossible\" for Christina Aguilera's album Stripped (2002), also providing background vocals and piano.[78][79] During the early 2000s, Keys also made small cameos in television series Charmed and American Dreams.[7]\n\n2003–2005: The Diary of Alicia Keys and Unplugged\n\n[edit]\n\nKeys followed up her debut with The Diary of Alicia Keys, which was released in December 2003.

The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for three weeks, became her first number-one single on the Hot 100 since 2001's \"Fallin'\". Keys won Best R&B Video for \"If I Ain't Got You\" at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards; she performed the song and \"Higher Ground\" with Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.[89][90]\n\nWhile attending the Cannes Film Festival in May 2004, it was announced that Keys intended to make her film debut in a biopic about biracial piano prodigy Philippa Schuyler.[91] The film was to be co-produced by Halle Berry and Marc Platt.[92] September 25, Alicia Keys headlined The Great Wall Concert, initially called the Wall of Hope concert, on the Northern Gate Juyongguan section of the Great Wall of China, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the wall's restoration project that was part of a series of benefit concerts.[93][94]\n\nLater that year, Keys released her book Tears for Water: Songbook of Poems and Lyrics, a collection of unreleased poems from her journals and lyrics. The title derived from one of her poems, \"Love and Chains\", from the line: \"I don't mind drinking my tears for water.\"[95] She said the title is the foundation of her writing because \"everything I have ever written has stemmed from my tears of joy, of pain, of sorrow, of depression, even of question\".[96] The book sold over US$500,000 and Keys made The New York Times bestseller list in 2005.[32][97] The following year, she won a second consecutive award for Best R&B Video at the MTV Video Music Awards for the video \"Karma\".[98] Keys performed \"If I Ain't Got You\" and then joined Jamie Foxx and Quincy Jones in a rendition of \"Georgia on My Mind\", the Hoagy Carmichael song made famous by Ray Charles in 1960 at the 2005 Grammy Awards.[99] That evening, she won four Grammy Awards: Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"If I Ain't Got You\", Best R&B Song for \"You Don't Know My Name\", Best R&B Album for The Diary of Alicia Keys, and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals\" for \"My Boo\" with Usher.[100]\n\nKeys performed and taped her installment of the MTV Unplugged series in July 2005 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.[101] During this session, Keys added new arrangements to her original songs and performed a few choice covers.[102] The session was released on CD and DVD in October 2005.

Her grandmother had died and her family was heavily dependent on her. She felt she needed to \"escape\" and went to Egypt for three weeks. She explained: \"That trip was definitely the most crucial thing I've ever done for myself in my life to date. It was a very difficult time that I was dealing with, and it just came to the point where I really needed to—basically, I just needed to run away, honestly. And I needed to get as far away as possible.\"[112]\n\nIn November 2006 Keys performed live with David Bowie at a fundraising event in New York.

The magazine also claimed she said that Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. were \"essentially assassinated, their beefs stoked by the government and the media, to stop another great black leader from existing\".[29] Keys later wrote a statement clarifying the issues and saying her words were misinterpreted.[139] Later that year, Keys was criticized by anti-smoking campaigners after billboard posters for her forthcoming concerts in Indonesia featured a logo for the A Mild cigarette brand sponsored by tobacco firm Philip Morris.

stage Keys \"invariably starts with a little Beethoven\" and \"moves into rhythm-and-blues that's accessorized with hip-hop scratching, jazz scat-singing and glimmers of gospel.\"[47] Keys's debut album, PopMatters wrote, reflects her sensibilities as young woman and as a \"musical, cultural, and racial hybrid.\"[51] NPR stated in 2016 that Keys's overall work consists of notable \"diversity to style and form\".[48] Salon wrote that the diversity of Keys's music is \"representative of her own border-breaking background and also emblematic of the variety responsible for the excitement and energy of American culture.\"[290]\n\nKeys's lyrical content has included themes of love, heartbreak, female empowerment, hope, her philosophy of life and struggles, inner city life experiences, and social and political commentary.[12][22][32][51][260][290][291] John Pareles of The New York Times noted that Keys presents herself as a musician first, and lyrically, her songs \"plunge into the unsettled domain of female identity in the hip-hop era, determined to work their way through conflicting imperatives\", while she plays multiple roles in her songs, expressing loyalty, jealousy, rejection, sadness, desire, fear, uncertainty, and tenacity.[47] Pareles considered in 2007 that Keys did not \"offer private details in her songs\" and that her musical compositions make up for a lack of lyrical refinement.[281][284] Gregory Stephen Tate of The Village Voice compared Keys's writing and production to 1970s music.[292] NPR described a few foundational elements in Key's music: \"heartache or infatuation\", a \"tenderness and emotion made heavy with wisdom\", a \"patiently unfurling melody\", and her \"yearning\" voice.[48] In 2016, referencing her sixth album, Here, Salon

Not only was she mean on the ivories, but she showed true musicianship, writing and performing her material\".[263] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone wrote that Keys \"reintroduced the idea of a self-reliant (but still pop-friendly) R&B singer-songwriter – a type that stretches back to Stevie Wonder\", crossing generational lines in the process.[268] On MSN's list of \"Contemporary R&B, hip hop and rap icons\", it was stated that Keys \"set a high bar\" from the outset of her career, \"drawing from her classical technique as a pianist, enhanced by her ease as a multi-instrumentalist...and songwriting steeped in her formal studies.\"[258] AllMusic wrote that her debut \"kicked off a wave of ambitious new neo-soul songsters\" and \"fit neatly into the movement of ambitious yet classicist new female singer/songwriters that ranged from the worldbeat-inflected pop of Nelly Furtado to the jazzy Norah Jones, whose success may not have been possible if Keys hadn't laid the groundwork\".[319]\n\nKeys transcends genres, The Recording Academy also stated, incorporating her \"classical background into her music and including gospel, jazz, blues and vintage soul, rock, and pop influences\", and she is \"one of the most respected musicians of today.\"[307] Jet said that in 2001, Keys \"ushered in a marriage between classical and soul music.\"[38] BBC's Babita Sharma stated in 2016 that Keys has had a significant impact \"on the R&B-soul-jazz sound of the last two decades\".[266] MOBO described Keys as an accomplished pianist, singer, songwriter and producer who is \"responsible for the emergence of vintage R&B imbibed with a post-modernist twist where genres divinely melt\" and \"has made a consistent and indelible contribution\" to the music industry, her \"unique approach\" making classical music more accessible and \"diffusing barriers between traditional and contemporary\".[270] ASCAP stated that Keys's \"innovative and enduring contributions to rhythm & soul music have earned her an Extraordinary Place in American Popular Music.\"[315]\n\nKeys has been credited with inspiring and influencing many artists,[49][320] including a younger generation of artists like Adele,[321] Rihanna,[322][323] Janelle Monáe,[324] H.E.R.,[325] Jessie Ware,[326][327] James Bay,[328] Ella Mai,[329] Wyvern Lingo,[320] Anuhea Jenkins,[330] Jorja Smith,[331][332] Lauren Jauregui,[333][334] Normani,[333] Alessia Cara,[335][336] Ruth-Anne Cunningham,[337] Lianne La Havas,[338][339][340] Heather Russell,[341] Grimes,[342] and Sophie Delila.[343]\n\nAchievements\n\n[edit]\n\nKeys is one of the world's best-selling music artists and is also listed on the Recording Industry Association of America's best-selling artists in the United States, selling over 17.8 million albums and 21.9 million digital songs.[344] She has sold over 30 million albums worldwide,[345][346] while her singles \"No One\" and \"Empire State of Mind\" are also amongst the list of best-selling singles worldwide.[347][348] Billboard ranked Keys as the fifth-most successful artist of the 2000s decade,[150] top R&B artist of the 2000s decade,[349] and placed her at number 10 in their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years.[350] Keys was the best-selling new artist and best-selling R&B artist of 2001.[73] She has attained 4 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles from 9 top-ten singles.[351] She has also attained 8 Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Airplay number-one singles,[352][353] and set a Guinness World Record on the former in 2008, when she became the first artist to replace herself at number one with \"No One\" and \"Like You'll Never See Me Again\".[354] Keys is one of three female artists included on Billboard magazine's list of the \"Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters, 2000–2011\" for writing songs that topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[355]\n\nKeys has earned numerous awards including 16 Grammy Awards,[356] 17 NAACP Image Awards, 9 Billboard Music Awards and 7 BET Awards.[357] Keys received 5 Grammy Awards in 2002, becoming the second female artist to win as many in one night.[358] In 2005, Keys was awarded the Songwriters Hall of Fame Hal David Starlight Award, which honors \"gifted songwriters who are at an apex in their careers and are making a significant impact in the music industry via their original songs\".[26][283] That year, ASCAP awarded Keys Songwriter of the Year at its Rhythm & Soul Music Awards.[314] In 2007, she was a recipient of The Recording Academy Honors, which \"celebrate outstanding individuals whose work embodies excellence and integrity and who have improved the environment for the creative community.\"[359] In 2014, Fuse ranked her as the thirteenth-most awarded musician of all time.[360] In 2020,Pollstar listed Keys among top female artists of the 21st century in the concert industry;
