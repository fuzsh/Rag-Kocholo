        "text": "Lambda Literary would like to open this statement with an apology for our silence during a time of terrorism and genocide. We acknowledge that as an organization, we arrived late to this moment. The lack of clarity on who we are internally resulted in an abdication of the responsibility we have to our community members whose lives, families, and art have been impacted by violence. We own this breach of trust and understand that it cannot be mended within our organization or communities without acknowledging that we have caused others to feel unheard or excluded.\n\nWe join other institutions in demanding a permanent ceasefire, the immediate release of hostages, and an end to Israeli apartheid. We demand Israel cease its obstruction of humanitarian aid into Gaza. And we demand that those who participate in these atrocities be held accountable under international laws and those of the lands in which they reside.\n\nSince its inception, Lambda has championed underrepresented LGBTQ+ voices by nurturing and advocating for LGBTQ+ writers and their readers. Our mission is rooted in the belief that elevating these voices creates a stronger, more pluralistic world and affirms the value of our diverse stories and lives. We recognize the value and intersectionality of each LGBTQ+ person’s life, and our struggle for liberation is intertwined with broader movements for full equality. We believe that people and communities with different identities coexisting peacefully and equitably is essential to every person’s self-actualization and liberation. For this reason, we stand in solidarity against genocide, white supremacy, and systems of oppression. We also stand with the region’s oppressed LGBTQ+ communities and call for an end to homophobia and transphobia.\n\nAfter the Hamas attack on the 7th of October and the deaths of over 1,139 people in Israel, more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the Occupied West Bank and Gaza. These figures do not include those missing, injured, or held hostage. Approximately 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced and now face death from disease or starvation. We are witness to the attempted annihilation of a people and their cultures, as Israel’s ongoing bombardment and invasion have destroyed Gaza’s infrastructure, homes, arts institutions, schools, and hospitals. We mourn the loss of civilians, medical workers, journalists, and artists. Condemnation of the Israeli government and Hamas should not be conflated with anti-Arab racism or antisemitism, which are abhorrent.\n\nOver the past months, members of our staff and board met with community stakeholders, received public feedback, and came together to discuss how we can meaningfully support struggles for Palestinian freedom. We extend our deepest gratitude to those individuals who have pushed to hold us to a higher standard, and who have themselves been brave and candid in sharing with us both their pain and their vision for what Lambda should represent.\n\nWe, the Lambda board and staff have reached a shared understanding that the nature of who we are as an organization requires that when we commit ourselves to a stated belief, it must be embodied in praxis. To that end, we have begun work on a number of initiatives and features within Lambda’s existing programs that we hope to share with you soon. We welcome opportunities to hold essential conversations with community members about Lambda’s mission in action and meaningful representations of solidarity.\n\nNew York, NY, June 1, 2021 – Lambda Literary, the nation’s premier LGBTQ literary organization, announced the winners of the 33rd Annual Lambda Literary Awards (a.k.a. the “Lammys”) this evening at a live Zoom ceremony hosted by Rakesh Satyal, who won a Lambda Literary Award for his debut novel, Blue Boy.\n\nAs they have done for over three decades, this year’s Lammys again celebrate powerful, necessary writing that centers the LGBTQ experience. With last year’s award ceremony cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s virtual celebration was a welcome return for an organization dedicated to honoring the very best in LGBTQ literature. Throughout the evening, presenters and winners highlighted the impact the Lammys have had in uplifting queer voices. Novelist Torrey Peters, author of Detransition, Baby, kicked off the festivities speaking of her joy to be presenting for “an organization for which trans writing and trans authors aren’t an afterthought.” Alex Gino, who won a Lammy in 2016 for their middle grade debut, George, highlighted the importance of the explosion of books featuring queer characters for young people while noting that across the country just one in five queer students experience course work that includes positive representations of LGBTQ people and history. John Paul Brammer, author of Hola Papi: How to Come Out in a Walmart Parking Lot and Other Life Lessons, began his presentation by noting, “As a gay person from rural America, books were some of the only community I had growing up,” while Ryan O’Connell, creator and star of Special, joked, “I love books and I love gay, and I love it when books and gay go together.”\n\nRepresenting the diversity of the LGBTQ experience, this year’s Lammy winners once again highlight Lambda Literary’s reputation for recognizing queer literature in all of its many forms, and many winners acknowledged that diversity in their speeches. In accepting the Lammy for Transgender Nonfiction for The Black Trans Prayer Book, J Mase III & Dane Figueroa Edidi said, “We hope that this work is a tool that helps to celebrate and heal our community.” Mohsin Zaidi, whose A Dutiful Boy: A Memoir of a Gay Muslim’s Journey to Acceptance won the Lammy for Gay Memoir/Biography, noted that he had been told there wouldn’t be much interest for his book in the U.S., but continued, “Stories don’t have a nationality and I think that’s even more true of our stories, of stories from the queer community.” Joshua Whitehead, winner of the LGBTQ Anthology Lammy for Love after the End: An Anthology of Two-Spirit and Indigiqueer Speculative Fiction, ended his speech with a joyous, “welcome to the Two-Spirit Indigiqueer, fem glittery, fantastic, trans, Indigenous future we deserve,” while Mike Curato, winner of the LGBTQ Young Adult Lammy for Flamer claimed his award for “all the sissies, all the queers, all the Pinoy boys who feel unseen, I see you. And for anyone who has dwelt in darkness, there is light inside you even if you can’t see it.”\n\nThe evening’s celebration, which has always doubled as a fundraiser to help support Lambda Literary’s programs, concluded with a performance by Grammy Award nominated artist and lesbian icon, Meshell Ndegeocello. “This year’s ceremony was a true celebration for us after what has been an unimaginably difficult year for so many,” said Sue Landers, executive director of Lambda Literary. “While we couldn’t be together in person again this year, we are so excited to be back honoring LGBTQ literature and all of the wonderful writers who make up our community. Congratulations to all of this year’s winners.”The Lammys are the most prestigious award in LGBTQ publishing. Please join us in celebrating the following authors and their literary accomplishments.\n\nLesbian Fiction\n\nFiebre Tropical, Juli Delgado Lopera, Feminist Press\n\nGay Fiction\n\nNeotenica, Joon Oluchi Lee, Nightboat Books\n\nBisexual Fiction\n\nYou Exist Too Much, Zaina Arafat, Catapult\n\nTransgender Fiction\n\nThe Thirty Names of Night, Zeyn Joukhadar, Atria Books\n\nBisexual Nonfiction\n\nWow, No Thank You.: Essays, Samantha Irby, Vintage\n\nTransgender Nonfiction\n\nThe Black Trans Prayer Book, J Mase III & Dane Figueroa Edidi, The Black Trans Prayer Book\n\nLGBTQ Nonfiction\n\nThe Lonely Letters, Ashon T.

Kenan, who won a Lambda Literary Award in 1992 for his novel Let the Dead Bury Their Dead, passed away in August of 2020 and the prize bearing his name honors writers whose work explores themes of Black LGBTQ life, culture, and history, with its winner receiving a $3,000 cash prize. Ana-Maurine Lara is the inaugural recipient of the prize. Other special prizes announced throughout the evening included Brontez Purnell and Sarah Gerard winning the Jim Duggins Outstanding Mid-Career Novelist Prize, a $5,000 prize given annually to two LGBTQ-identified authors who have published multiple novels and show promise to continue publishing high quality work for years to come. Nancy Agabian won the $2,500 Jeanne Córdova Prize for Lesbian/Queer Nonfiction, granted to a writer committed to nonfiction work that captures the depth and complexity of lesbian and queer life, culture, and history. The Judith Markowitz Award recognizes two writers whose work demonstrates exceptional potential, and T Kira Madden and Taylor Johnson were awarded this year’s $1,000 prizes. More information on these winners and their prizes is available here.\n\nLambda Literary thanks the following sponsors for their support of the Lammys.\n\nPrevious Next\n\nEditor’s Note: Recently, author John Weir shared the following post on his Facebook page. We found the post to be a moment of clarity despite the cultural uncertainty. He kindly let us share it.\n\nSocial distancing? Went for a midnight run in Prospect Park, met nary a soul–which was actually kind of pleasant–forgive me, Jesus–found myself thinking about the disasters I’d lived through in NYC, or witnessed elsewhere–“Disasters I’ve Known,” not about my romantic life!–rather: In 1983-84, I ran a Writers Group for People With AIDS, Thanksgiving to Easter, and they all died, all the members, 12 guys; and so did the two “buddies” to whom I was assigned by Gay Men’s Health Crisis; and that was what being 24 was like!\n\nAnd then my friend David Feinberg died, spectacularly, theatrically, for months; and that was being 34! And then 9/11, and the city shut down for months afterwards: the National Guard in tanks patrolling Lower Manhattan, empty stores, empty streets–who knew I’d miss tourists!\n\nAnd because of magazine pieces I was assigned to write, I was in Oklahoma City the day the government knocked down the gutted shell of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building; and a week after Hurricane Katrina, I was in Houston, where thousands of displaced people, who’d spent days living in terror in the New Orleans’ Superdome, were now living in fear and uncertainty in the Houston Astrodome, sleeping on fold–out cots across the outfield.\n\nDisaster changes people, rearranges their cells, wrecks their lives and sometimes weirdly saves them; and the government always behaves badly. The slow response. The negligent response. Sometimes criminally negligent. The inept response, the self–serving response, the refusal altogether to respond. I know why people hate the government, but voting for Trump was running with a lit torch into a matchstick house: now you’re on fire too, whether or not you know it.\n\nWhere’s the redemption? What’s the lesson learned? Just that–I guess–we got through it–if we did! Not everybody survives traumatic loss. Pardon my keen grasp of the obvious. You will surprise yourself, though, at what you can endure; and while people who cannot or will not help may fall away and out of your life, still, people who seem amazingly caring and able, and whom you would not have known otherwise, will show up, abruptly, miraculously. And while suffering is a big price to pay for connection, that’s something disaster also brings, in addition to loss: connection.\n\n“For such loss, abundant recompense?” Wordsworth says! But he never met Trump. I wouldn’t say “recompense,” anyway, and who wants abundance? Abundance would crush me. Deprivation I can handle! I’m right for disaster, I guess. Something it gives: the chance to fight together with relative strangers against loss or the threat of loss. A kind of communion. To discover people who care, not because they know you, but because they don’t–because they take for granted that you matter as much as they do, just because you’re on the planet, and we’re in this together.\n\nRejoice bibliophiles! November has arrived and so has a cavalcade of fall books. This month you can pick up new releases from Dennis Cooper, Mari SanGiovanni, Sheila Ortiz Taylor, Chantal Regnault, and Samuel Delany. (more…)\n\nWhat causes us to call each other ‘family’? Do genetic links hold meanings in the absence of actually meeting one who shares them? Is blood thicker than water when water is all you’ve ever known? Each of these questions is considered in Blood Strangers (Heyday Books), a memoir of one woman’s search for her father’s biological family. Briccetti documents, in vivid detail and often elegant prose, her obsession with her own genealogy. (more…)\n\nThe end of a hot and extremely dry summer brought a number of enjoyable distractions. Richard Stevenson’s latest Don Strachey case shows author and P.I. back in top form, thirty years after their debut. There were second novels from Joseph R.G. DeMarco and Scott Sherman. Jordan Castillo Price and Andrea Speed continued their alternate universe mystery series, joined by newcomer Stephen Osborne. I am happy to report that I was part of Cheyenne Publishing’s decision to bring Ruth Sims’s pioneering YA Pride Pack mysteries back into print. Two authors — Michael Gouda and Marshall Thornton — brought off that rarity: single-author short story collections. And two anthologies of all new crime writing appeared, one edited by DeMarco and the other by Greg Herren and J.M. Redmann. Plus, the excellent film adaptation of Ken Bruen’s comic thriller Blitz became available onDVD. (more…)\n\nThe chronicle of the displaced, teenage sex worker is such a staple of gay film and literature that he’s almost his own genre. From Richie McMullen’s Enchanted Youth to Gus Van Sant’s My Own Private Idaho, the young, inflammable rebel’s trials, tribulations, and “liberation” loom large in the creative mind with harsh lessons and dark, sexual adventures on urban mean streets. (more…)\n\nSet in the declining town of Leominster, Massachusetts in the 1980s, Michael Graves’ blistering debut collection Dirty One (Chelsea Station Editions) depicts the harrowing lives of working-class adolescents on the verge. (more…)\n\n“When fiction is made according to its nature, it should reinforce our sense of the supernatural by grounding it in concrete, observable reality.” -Flannery O’Connor\n\nThe Caregiver, the latest by the prolific Rick R. Reed, due out this month from Dreamspinner Press (cover art by Paul Richmond), is a straightforward traditional romance that may surprise his large horror romance fan base. But as Reed points out, “I am not one to stay within the lines when it comes to genre.” Readers who are fans of his horror romances know that they can trust Reed to deliver solid stories and strong characters and that trust is rewarded in this powerfully, satisfying romance set in the midst of the AIDS crises in the mid-90s. (more…)\n\n“I’m always interested in the idea of the sacred and profane. I’m a very spiritual and sexual person. Liberating my spirituality, by being irreligious, and my sexuality, by coming out, empowered me more.”\n\nAzwan Ismail is an engineer, poet and editor in Kuala Lumpur. He came to my attention last year when his It Gets Better video appeared on YouTube. Immediately after uploading it, Azwan found himself in the center of a media firestorm that resulted in death threats. Because of his tremendous courage, Change.org named him a Gay Rights Hero of 2010. He edited Orang Macam Kita (People Like Us), the first-ever Malay-language LGBT anthology (Matahari Books, 2010). (more…)\n\nSapphire’s first novel, Push, is a regular selection for my Introduction to Women’s Studies classes. Students enjoy reading the novel and watching, on their own, the film, Precious directed by Lee Daniels, with its major stars. Often we discuss the movie’s fidelity to the novel and where it diverges, thinking about how the two forms of artistic expression work differently. More importantly, however, we discuss the important questions Push raises about literacy, poverty, and AIDS. (more…)\n\nOne of the problems with comics anthologies is that they aren’t always good. You’re forced to plod through a lot of not-so-talented and amateur creations, in hopes of discovering one or two slivers of greatness. Famous artists contribute to the call for work, but instead of crafting new, exciting stuff, they dig through their closet and pawn off B-grade comics that no one else would publish, because they know a small publisher will slobber over their big name. It’s rare to find compilations that are as carefully constructed, drawn and written as artist’s individual monograms. (more…)\n\nImagine you wrote a book and it was shortlisted for the National Book Award. Imagine the excitement you would feel getting the phone call telling you that your words are being recognized for their literary excellence. Now imagine finding out you were nominated by accident because your book’s title sounds similar to the one that was actually supposed to be nominated. That’s what happened to Lauren Myracle last week. Myracle, a New York Times bestselling author of middle grade and young adult novels, was named as a Young People’s Literature finalist for her latest novel, Shine, about a girl who struggles to find the truth in small town North Carolina after her best guy friend falls victim to a brutal hate crime. (more…)\n\nHappy Accidents (Voice), Jane Lynch’s breezy memoir about her life and work as a post-Stonewall American actor, has something for everyone. It is an interesting mix of Americana as well as a cross-section of the history of stage and TV sketch comedy. Both narrative and nostalgia, Happy Accidents is fun with flair, a chronicle of happenstance and the absurdities of life as she gleefully connects the dots between her personal and professional life. Lynch explains humor, and her always present desire for laughter (more…)\n\nThe Brown Boi Project in Oakland, CA just finished up it’s third annual leadership retreat. A “community of masculine of center womyn, men, two-spirit people, transmen, and our allies committed to transforming our privilege of masculinity, gender, and race into tools for achieving Racial and Gender Justice,” the Brown Boi Project holds annual leadership retreats for masculine of center people of color aged 35 and under who wish to “work across issues and communities, talk about race, class, culture, gender and sexuality, and explore what a commitment to social justice looks like.”\n\nIn addition to its leadership retreats, the BBP also has released a ground breaking health book, Freeing Ourselves: A Guide to Health and Self Love for Brown Bois. (more…)\n\nIt’s a shame that summer is over, for Terrance Dean has written a textbook example of the fast-paced “summer novel” with Mogul (Atria Books). Drawing on his experience in the music business, already discussed in his 2008 non-fiction book Hiding In Hip Hop: On the Down Low in the Entertainment Industry from Music to Hollywood, Dean here lays out the life and hidden loves of a top producer “on the DL.” (more…)\n\n“Writing these pieces was almost like putting together an album. I wanted fifty-dollar words and I wanted to create literary pop. Colorful, fizzy, glitterized fiction.”\n\nReviewer Richard Labonte recently branded Michael Graves “a next-generation master of prose” based on the strength of his startling original collection of short stories, Dirty One (Chelsea Station Editions). Tom Cardamone chats with the refreshingly enthusiastic author about Halloween, Mitt Romney, suburban drug use and more. (more…)\n\nThe opening chapter of The Girls Club (Bywater Books) by Sally Bellerose lays it all out on the table. But this just a taste of what the reader will find throughout the rest of the novel—body, sisterhood, illness, family, confused sexuality. In this unabashed prose, Bellerose captures a specific time, place, and circumstance while managing to remain timeless in her story. The narrator, Cora Rose, and her two sisters, Marie and Renee, dominate this book—they make it readable, believable, engrossing. (more…)\n\nFor me, and for many fans of literary fiction, particularly the gay ones, a new Alan Hollinghurst novel is an event. From 1988, when his first book The Swimming Pool Library was published to great acclaim, to 2004 when he won the Booker Prize for The Line of Beauty, Hollinghurst became known as one of Britain’s great novelists and arguably the greatest gay novelist writing in English today. (more…)\n\nToday, two new poems by Monica McClure. (more…)\n\nOn a beautiful fall evening at New York’s Dixon Place on Tuesday October 5, writer Dinick Martinez took the stage, reading from a black and white composition notebook; “It’s hard to forget the harrowing moments when I was blind in love with the wrong man.”\n\nThe audience murmured an understanding response to the experience and the specificity of the language, perhaps remembering moments when they were also blind in love with the wrong person. (more…)\n\nPost-Modern Meta Alert! Writer Stephen Beachy has not only injected himself as a character into his latest work of fiction, Boneyard (Verse Chorus), he has also cleverly placed himself in the book’s press materials/book trailer. (more…)\n\nDuring my senior year of college, as I was researching for my thesis on the poetic response to AIDS, I ran across Tim Dlugos’s “Retrovir” in Michael Klein’s anthology Poets for Life: 76 Poets Respond to AIDS. Immediately gut-checked and seduced by those few poems, I went searching for more Dlugos, which wasn’t exactly easy, even in the age of instant access to, well, almost anything. Through several used and rare book dealers, I found copies of Dlugos’ Strong Place (with introduction by David Trinidad), Powerless (again, Trinidad introduction), and a rare chapbook, For Years. When news circulated that Trinidad was in the process of editing a Collected Poems, I waited intently. The wait was well worth it (more…)\n\nSomething I often find annoying about biographies is their blatant attempts to shape our responses. Either the writer crafts an homage, believing the subject is beyond reproach, or barely concealed antipathy creates a portrait that is diminishing. Such is not the case with Robert A. Schanke’s current treatise: Queer Theatre and the Legacy of Cal Yeomans. Schanke scrupulously details his tumultuous life and career, never hesitating to elaborate for the sake of balance and fairness. (more…)\n\n“I absolutely believe that writing and publishing erotica, especially for minorities, is a political act. We must write our own stories, our own truths, otherwise our detractors and enemies will do it for us”\n\nI picked up Best Lesbian Erotica 1998 when I worked at an indie bookstore, and it changed my trajectory. Suddenly I was asking myself, why do I love this lesbian erotica so much? (more…)\n\n“It’s a blessing and a curse, this business of writing about everything that challenges, confounds, or embarrasses me. Contrary to how it must seem, it actually springs from an aversion to self-reflection. If I didn’t write about my life, I would never understand what the hell was happening.”\n\n“The Banal and the Profane” is a monthly Lambda Literary column in which we lift the veil on both the writerly life and the publishing industry. In each installment, we ask a different LGBT writer, or LGBT person of interest in the book industry, to guide us through a week in their lives.\n\nThis month’s “Banal and Profane” column comes to us from Melissa Febos. (more…)\n\nDeadline: November 15, 2024\n\nPerugia Press, a feminist micro press publishing emerging women poets, is seeking submissions for the 2025 Perugia Press Prize Contest. The contest is open from August 1st to November 15th for full-length poetry manuscripts by women, which includes all gender-expansive definitions of that term, who have no more than one previously published full-length book.\n\nFor more details about the prize, eligibility, and guidelines for submitting manuscripts, please click on the button below.\n\nDeadline: August 23, 2024\n\nHoliday House and Peachtree Publishing are looking for publishing interns for the Fall 2024 season. For more details view the links below.\n\nThe Holiday House internship is hybrid out of Manhattan and is posted below:\n\nThe Peachtree internship is hybrid out of Atlanta and is posted below:\n\nEXTENDED Deadline for submissions: November 20, 2024\n\nTo the End: Divorce narratives from queer, trans, non binary, gay, bisexual, lesbian, two-spirit, gender-expansive, and intersex writers aims to explore the full depth and breadth of divorce narratives from queer, trans, non-binary, two-spirit, genderfluid, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and intersex writers. Divorce can be painful, clarifying, freeing, extremely messy, and/or full of renewed life.

Tracing the intergenerational struggles of Black and Native American women (and sometimes men), primarily in the Southern States (but also in other places) she articulates not only the individual emotional lives of her protagonists, but also a large-scale (re)vision of American history, and of what it means to survive (in) America. Through her work with LaVenson press and her Story Garden Studios she has also worked tirelessly to aid and promote other Black women writers. Her latest novel, Trinity, shows her going from strength to strength: it is truly a book by a writer at mid-career, in full command of her themes and methods, ready to depart to further challenges.\n\nAbout K.M.

M. Soehnlein’s beautifully crafted novels have animated various slices of queer life, culminating in his most recent work, the award-winning Army of Lovers, a powerful and poignant must-read set during an important period of LGBTQ history.

She divides her time between Brooklyn and the Hudson Valley, New York where she lives with her wife, Bea, and her rescue pitbull, Pongo.\n\nOn Davies’ work, the judges remarked:\n\nStephanie Davies’ book, Other Girls Like Me, recalls the queer feminist culture, community, music, activism, and protest of the 70s and 80s with humor and wit. Her work in progress is a moving and promising work of intimacy and friendship in the face of loss. We are excited for her future projects.\n\nLambda Literary is thrilled to announce Federico Erebia and River 瑩瑩 Dandelion as the winners of the 2024 Judith A. Markowitz Award for Exceptional New LGBTQ Writers.\n\nLambda Literary has played a pivotal role in nurturing the development of exceptional new LGBTQ writers through the Writers Retreat for Emerging LGBTQ Voices, internships, and writing and performance opportunities. Supporting emerging LGBTQ writers is central to our mission: they are the future of LGBTQ literature.\n\nThe Judith A. Markowitz Award for Exceptional New LGBTQ Writers recognizes LGBTQ-identified writers whose work demonstrates their strong potential for promising careers. The award includes a cash prize of $1,500.\n\nAbout Federico Erebia\n\nFederico Erebia is a retired physician, woodworker, author, poet, and illustrator. He received a BA from the College of Wooster, and an MD from Brown University.\n\nHe is the recipient of Lambda Literary’s 2024 Judith A. Markowitz Award for Exceptional New LGBTQ Writer. His debut novel, Pedro & Daniel (Levine Querido 2023) is longlisted for the 2024 Massachusetts Book Award; is “A Must Read Title” at the Massachusetts Center for the Book, a Library of Congress affiliate; is a 2023 Kirkus Reviews Best of the Year; and was featured on NPR’s Weekend Edition. It received starred reviews from Kirkus, Publishers Weekly, and Shelf Awareness.\n\nErebia is on the SCBWI Impact & Legacy Fund’s steering committee, where he created the School Librarian’s Mini Library grants: In less than two years, over 600 books by and/or about marginalized or underrepresented individuals have been sent to twenty-one schools, reaching over twenty thousand students. He is on the board of Read Your World, Inc. He is a member of several other writing groups.\n\nHe identifies as intersectional: he is gay, Mexican American, and neurodivergent. He and his husband live near Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nOn Erebia’s work, a judge remarked:\n\nWriting for children comes with a moral imperative impossible to ignore: writing inclusively, openly, honestly, and kindly about the realities children experience, including trauma, questions of identity, familial relationships, and more. Erebia’s deeply engaging blend of poetry and prose lovingly and thoughtfully does exactly this, examining experiences as well as neurodiversity, Latine (specifically Mexican) diaspora, and queerness in a way that centers intersectionality and is accessible for readers of all ages. The concerns of Erebia’s writing are echoed in his community engagement in diversifying kidlit in multiple organizations, which is particularly vital in this era of book banning. Writers come from all stages in life, and we are delighted to support Erebia’s second career.\n\nAbout River 瑩瑩 Dandelion\n\nRiver 瑩瑩 Dandelion is a practitioner of ancestral medicine through writing poetry, teaching, filmmaking, energy healing, and creating ceremony. As a poet, he writes to connect with the unseen and unspoken so we can feel and heal. As a filmmaker, he creates poetic and narrative films that center emotional safety, trans joy, and intergenerational healing. As a healing arts practitioner, he activates energy healing to help clients move through transition and transformation. Winner of the 2024 Judith Markowitz Prize for Exceptional New LGBTQ Writers, River is the author of remembering (y)our light, his debut chapbook on honoring matriarchs and ancestors across generations.\n\nRiver has been awarded residencies and fellowships from Headlands Center for the Arts, Tin House, Lambda Literary, Kundiman, Third World Newsreel, Bread Loaf Environmental Writers’ Conference, and more. He has performed and presented his work globally at venues including Dodge Poetry Festival, Museum of the City of New York, and the University of Havana. His work is published in numerous journals and anthologies. His poetic film, Spells for Safety, premiered at the Newark LGBTQ Film Festival. River loves to swim and does this work for queer and trans ancestors and descendants to come. For more, visit: riverdandelion.com.\n\nOn Dandelion’s work, a judge commented:\n\nMasterful poetry echoes thematic concerns within its form, word choice, imagery, and structure, and Chan’s work exhibits these characteristics with a deft and thoughtful hand. Meditations on lineage (both familial and otherwise), language, community, Asian (specifically Chinese) diaspora, desire, and gender are reinforced with choices in every line. It is obvious Chan’s community work feeds into his creative work and vice-versa, thinking through intersectionality by blending the personal with the sociopolitical. He builds space for queer and trans writers both within his poetry and outside, in his curation and creation of multimedia art, approach to pedagogy, anti-racist workshops, and community building. Chan is a shining example of who this prize is meant to highlight."
