Headline earnings per share in- creased by 125.3% to 1 150.6 cents compared with 2021, and were up 17% compared with the last pre-pandemic period. Dividends came to 150c per share, after a final 100c (2021: 60c) dividend was declared. “We are encouraged by the progress we made, amidst all the headwinds, in our continued journey of recovery and in delivering on our strategy to optimise our portfolio in order to unlock stakeholder value,” said chief executive Jannie Durand in a…\n\nPower utility has not come up with a new figure for the estimated budget ESKOM has for the first time made a public admission that the cost for the upgrades of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station will surge above the initially budgeted R20 billion. The struggling power utility, however, has not managed to come up with a new figure for the estimated budget to extend the lifespan of the Koeberg power station by a further 20 years. Eskom’s acting chief nuclear officer, Keith Featherstone, yesterday said that the original cost estimate of R20bn was done in the 2010 parameter, and if reassessed in today’s values it would be significantly different. Featherstone was briefing the joint meeting of the portfolio committees on mineral resources and energy, and public enterprises on…\n\nSOUTH African consumers are facing a bleak and uncertain period in the months ahead before the year ends as household finances remained under pressure in the second quarter on elevated prices and rising interest rates. The SA Reserve Bank (SARB) yesterday said that household finances deteriorated slightly in the second quarter, hurt by higher inflation, rising debt service costs and lower household net wealth. In its Quarterly Bulletin, the SARB said household consumption expenditure slowed to 0.6% quarter-on-quarter from 1.2% weighed on by softer income growth as higher inflation eroded the growth in real personal disposable income. Inflation rose above its target range of 3 to 6% in the second quarter mainly due to Russia’s war in Ukraine, forcing the central bank to adopt an aggressive monetary policy and hike…\n\nAS STATISTICS South Africa released employment statistics for the second quarter yesterday, which showed a 1.2% decrease over the previous quarter, economists say a jobs recovery to pre-pandemic levels may still be some way off. According to Koketso Mano, a senior economist at FNB, commenting on the Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES), prevailing geopolitical tensions, elevated inflation and tightening global financial conditions are expected to slow the momentum in global growth. “This, along with local energy supply constraints, is likely to impede employment prospects … Ultimately, the employment recovery to pre-pandemic levels may still be protracted in the near term, lagging the recovery in earnings. “In the longer term, further progress on structural reform and more robust growth in private sector investment should support employment growth,” she said. QES data yesterday…\n\nRENOWNED business leader, Sir Roger Carr, captured the essence of the challenge of establishing a good corporate reputation in observing that “It’s not simply how much money you make, but equally, how you make money that counts.” Few intangible assets are as valuable and yet as slippery as corporate reputation. Above all else, however, corporate reputation is dependent on the need for the company to be true to its purpose and value proposition. It is the alleged abrogation of this fundamental corporate commandment that makes the Competition Commission’s recent raid and seizure of documents and hard drives of eight insurance companies so perplexing. In broad terms, corporate reputation is generally defined as a collective assessment of a company’s attractiveness to a specific group of stakeholders relative to a reference group…\n\nMC MINING has launched a R472 million rights offer as it plans to construct a new thermal and metallurgical coal mine in Limpopo. The company said yesterday that the rights issue offer of new shares in MC Mining would be at an issue price of A$0.20 (R2.34) per new share for eligible shareholders in Australia and New Zealand and R2.36 per new share for eligible shareholders in South Africa. Senosi Group Investment Holdings and Dendocept Proprietary have underwritten the offer, which would be used to part fund the development of the Makhado project. Proceeds from the rights issue are critical in terms of the firm’s obligations to $26m (about R470m) in debt funding that’s also been arranged. MC Mining CEO and managing director Godfrey Gomwe said the capital raise…"
