Sometimes used to describe only males who are attracted primarily to other males.\n\nGender: the social and cultural codes used to distinguish between what a society considers \"masculine\" or \"feminine\" conduct.\n\nGender expression: the external characteristics and behaviors which societies define as \"masculine\" or \"feminine\"-including such attributes as dress, appearance, mannerisms, speech patterns, and social behavior and interactions.\n\nGender identity: a person's internal, deeply felt sense of being male or female, or something other than or in between male and female.\n\nHeterosexual: a person attracted primarily to people of the opposite sex.\n\nHomosexual: a person attracted primarily to people of the same sex.\n\nLesbian: a female attracted primarily to other females.\n\nLGBT: lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender; an inclusive term for groups and identities sometimes also associated together as \"sexual minorities.\"\n\nQueer: Often used as a slur in English to refer to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons, the term \"queer\" has been reclaimed by many people in the US and other countries as an expression of pride in one's sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nSexual orientation: the way in which a person's sexual and emotional desires are directed. The term categorizes according to the sex of the object of desire-that is, it describes whether a person is attracted primarily toward people of the same or opposite sex, or to both.\n\nTransgender: One whose inner gender identity differs from the physical characteristics of their body at birth. Female-to-male (FTM) transgender people were born with female bodies but have a predominantly male gender identity; male-to-female (MTF) transgender people were born with male bodies but have a predominantly female gender identity.\n\nTranssexual: One who has undergone sex reassignment surgery so that his/her physical sex corresponds to his/her internal gender identity.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nA. Summary\n\nIn the mid-1990s, South Africa emerged from decades of oppression, during which equality had been both a rallying cry and a remote dream, and wrestled with the question of how to turn the slogan into a reality for its peoples.\n\nAt the same time, politicians elsewhere in southern Africa¾facing shrinking public support and the threat of electoral defeat¾began exploring how to make inequality a powerful slogan in itself. One leader discovered a potential target and a vituperative language that struck a responsive chord among his people. Others followed suit. They have echoed and reinforced one another across borders and over time¾scapegoating one group of people for their countries' difficulties, and explicitly excluding \"homosexuals\" from constitutional protections granted to their other citizens.\n\nSouthern Africa is burdened by poverty and political uncertainty, and devastated by higher rates of HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficieny virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) infection than any other region in the world. Yet in some countries, politicians, instead of directly addressing those issues, have made calls to persecute and cast out homosexuals (or \"gays and lesbians,\" \"sodomists,\" or \"sexual perverts\") commonplace. Robert Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, popularized those calls through widely publicized statements, reiterated regularly since 1995. \"We don't believe they [gay men and lesbians] have any rights at all,\" he said, \"It cannot be right for human rights groups to dehumanize us to the status of beasts.\" Mugabe justifies his intolerance with the claim that homosexuality is \"un-African,\" describing it as a disease \"coming from so-called developed nations.\"\n\nSam Nujoma, president of Namibia, took up the cry almost immediately. According to an official statement by Nujoma's party,\n\nMost of ardent supporters of this perverts [sic] are Europeans who imagine themselves to be the bulwark of civilization and enlightenment... we made sacrifices for the liberation of this country and we are not going to allow individuals with alien practices such as homosexuality to destroy the social fabric of our society.\n\nWe are convinced that homosexuality is not a natural and objective form of moral history but a hideous deviation of decrepit and inhuman sordid behavior.... Homosexuality deserves a severe contempt and disdain from the Namibian people and should be uprooted totally as a practice.\n\nPoliticians in Zambia in 1998 outdid one another in condemning the only homosexual man in the entire country who had dared to \"come out\" to the press. Botswana not only clung to its colonial-era criminalization of male homosexual acts, but in 1998 broadened it to punish women having sex with women. The leaders of other countries have joined the chorus, with President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda declaring in 1999 that \"I have told the CID [Criminal Investigations Department] to look for homosexuals, lock them up and charge them.\"\n\nIn this report, Human Rights Watch and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) document and analyze the impact of state-sponsored homophobia in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Zambia, and Botswana. The report shows how these attacks attempt to create an atmosphere of intolerance in which governments can erode the basic principles of human rights, and individuals can abuse others with impunity. It contrasts these to the different situation in South Africa, where the constitution has promised an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation-but where a lack of will as well as foresight has kept these promises short of fulfillment.\n\nAs this report documents, the verbal attacks by political leaders have often led to persecution and violence. In Zimbabwe and Namibia, in particular, public vilification has set off police harassment of those who break norms for sexual conduct and gender expression. Official crackdowns have frequently followed politicians' statements. People have been detained and tortured by police, or abused by prison guards.\n\nThroughout the region, neighbors, strangers, and families have also joined in the violence. In the communities where they live, men and women accused of homosexuality have been assaulted and often driven underground. Some have been expelled from schools or jobs, or chased from hospitals or homes. Some have been driven into exile. Some have committed suicide.\n\nIn Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, laws criminalizing consensual homosexual conduct¾so-called \"sodomy laws\"¾enable many of these abuses. Such laws violate international protections of the right to privacy, and protections against discrimination. Yet basic freedoms of association, assembly, and expression are also under threat. In all four countries, civil-society organizations have been denied legal status or threatened with closure because they defended homosexuals. Publications have been censored; peaceful gatherings have been harassed or denied protection.\n\nIn many countries, however, civil society has remained silent about these violations-including organizations dedicated to the defense of human rights. Namibia and Botswana have revealed exceptions; there, feminist activists and human rights defenders, as well as leaders of some Christian churches, have spoken out against intolerance. In many places, however, tenuous organizations of gays and lesbians, identifying by the names that politicians use against them, have been left to defend themselves as best they can.\n\nSouth Africa presents a different example. The principle of equality and non-discrimination embodied in the country's 1996 constitution sees a source of strength in the diversity of a country with eleven official languages, innumerable religious institutions, and uncounted and often contradictory cultural traditions. The constitution vows in its preamble to \"heal the divisions of the past\" and to \"lay the foundations for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of the people and every citizen is equally protected by law.\" It creates institutions as well as protections toward this goal, striving to accommodate difference while defusing violence.\n\nProfound economic inequalities transect South Africa; racial, ideological, and sexual violence persists; the few who can obtain AIDS drugs live, while millions prepare to die. While steps taken by the government to address these divisions have been important, they remain inadequate. In this report, we show the persistence of community prejudice and violence. We document how, in the absence of clear state action to implement it, the constitution's Equality Clause remains inaccessible and unfulfilled for lesbians and gay men living in townships and rural areas. We examine the foot-dragging of political leaders in changing laws, and in creating mechanisms for enforcement and remedy. Silence and inaction endanger the constitution's promise.\n\nYet other states still refuse even to make such a promise.\n\nB. Contexts: HIV/AIDS, Inequality, Identity\n\nA number of contexts need to be understood as a background to the spread of state-sponsored homophobia in the region.\n\nThe first is the intersection of sexuality with the massive, overwhelming, and mounting HIV/AIDS pandemic. The disease has already claimed over 21 million lives in sub-Saharan Africa, and the southern African countries in which this research was conducted are the global epicenter of the crisis. The epidemic is so widespread in the region-about one in four adults is infected in most of these countries, in Botswana more than one in three-that every sexually active person may be considered a member of a high-risk group. The proximity of death is a fact of life in every country discussed here. Many people interviewed in this report have already died of AIDS.\n\nAs the Appendix to this report shows, social prejudice and criminal penalties against certain kinds of sexual conduct long antedate the appearance of AIDS. Yet the pandemic and the attendant atmosphere of fear give states and societies additional incentives to control and punish non-conforming sexualities¾while making that repression doubly destructive.\n\nAlthough the predominant means of HIV transmission in southern Africa is heterosexual sexual activity, many segments of society still associate AIDS with \"homosexuals.\" This can compound the marginalization of many people living with HIV/AIDS, who face additional stigma through the presumption that they have practiced prohibited sex. Meanwhile, those who endure discrimination for engaging in homosexual activity may find they are presumed as well to be both victims of AIDS and its \"carriers.\" Men who have sex with men, and women who have sex with women, often fear the social and legal consequences of seeking testing or treatment.\n\nOn a larger scale, the burgeoning epidemic has arguably hardened opposition to repealing sodomy laws, though this is difficult to document when both HIV/AIDS and same-sex conduct are so shrouded in silence and stigma. The social devastation which AIDS brings¾the collapse of family and community structures¾is sometimes blamed on a \"homosexuality\" encroaching from beyond national borders. Fears enveloping HIV have certainly contributed to repressing discussion of, and education about, sexual health and sexual rights.\n\nThe history of responses to the AIDS pandemic shows that any national HIV/AIDS prevention effort hoping for success should work respectfully with communities made vulnerable by their sexual conduct or orientation, and should protect their human rights as a priority. Unless they can openly and safely seek and gain access to HIV/AIDS prevention services and information, men who have sex with men and women who have sex with women are at particular risk in the epidemic. The rhetoric of discrimination documented in this report is an acute threat to the anti-AIDS efforts these countries have mounted.\n\nA second context is the uneasy course of democratization in the region.\n\nThe struggle against colonialism and white minority rule lasted longer in southern Africa than almost anywhere else in the continent. Though Zambia and Botswana achieved independence from Britain in 1964 and 1966 respectively, and Portugal relinquished Angola and Mozambique in 1975, Zimbabwe held its first all-race elections only in 1980, Namibia in 1990, and South Africa in 1994. Progress has been made toward establishing democratic processes and institutions in all these countries, but it has been uneven and uncertain. The accomplishment of South Africa¾not only in holding free elections, but in undertaking a wholesale transformation of the repressive apparatus of the colonial state¾remains virtually unique.\n\nIn Zimbabwe in particular, President Mugabe presides over a dissolving economy and a deep popular demand for democracy. Gays and lesbians have served him as a scapegoat for the first and a sideshow from the second. Mugabe speaks of his country's gays and lesbians as both servants and symbol of forces outside Zimbabwe, and outside Africa, threatening the cultural integrity and welfare of his country. He sees them as vanguard of, and metaphor for, a neo-colonial invasion.\n\nSexuality and gender are loaded questions in every country and culture, involving as they do the ways in which societies define and reproduce themselves. That cultural weight can also make them convenient issues for states to exploit, in the effort to impose some semblance of political unity on fractious populations-and for politicians to employ, in the quest to preserve power.\n\nZimbabwe's economic unraveling, the collapse of its public health system, and its political instability are real disasters. In translating them into the terms of a culture war, however, Mugabe's only success is in changing the subject. In a characteristic speech in 2000, he attacked the United Kingdom (U.K.), which had condemned his policy of land seizures, accusing it of opposing Zimbabwe because he personally opposed homosexuality. \"We are against this homosexuality,\" he said, \"and we as chiefs in Zimbabwe should fight against such Western practices and respect our culture.\" And he concluded: \"These economic woes will come and go. So let us unite against the enemy.\"\n\nWhen Mugabe's attacks on homosexuals began, the human rights community in Zimbabwe¾with a few exceptions¾failed to respond. Some voiced fear that defending a marginal group in a hostile environment would devastate their work; others refused to see the attacks as relevant to their work as rights activists.\n\nYet the techniques Mugabe explored in vilifying lesbians and gays-depicting them as a group outside the scope of rights, stoking public fear and loathing, and eroding the rule of law-have since found new victims. Mugabe has attacked peaceful political opposition both through trumped-up legal charges and extralegal violence. He has supported the extrajudicial seizure of land, and has incited and defended violence against both the white farm owners and their African employees. He has undermined the independence of the judiciary; he has conducted, and triumphed in, an election in which intimidation was rampant. Increasingly, state policy in Zimbabwe has been voiced in demagogic speeches, not in democratic law, and carried out not by delegated agents but by armed gangs.\n\nPresident Nujoma of Namibia has described gays and lesbians in terms as violent as any Mugabe used. Yet, by contrast to Zimbabwe, civil society stood up to President Nujoma from the start. Human rights organizations in Namibia immediately analyzed and answered attacks on gays and lesbians as a challenge to the principles of rights. The National Society for Human Rights in Windhoek described Nujoma's rhetoric as an indication of emerging authoritarianism in Namibia. \"The move appears to be a tip of an insidious, much wider and protracted strategy spearheaded by and or run from State House and such campaigns are apparently aimed at stemming the tide of a rapidly growing civil society in Namibia,\" the organization said.\n\nThe official vilification of groups within Namibian society has also progressed beyond homosexuals. Nujoma has attacked independent media, political opposition leaders, women's rights activists, and foreigners. The small but vigorous human rights organizations within Namibia, however, continue to condemn both Nujoma's outbursts and the social divisions they incite.\n\nZambia-where a coalition of trade unions, intellectuals, and activists displaced the almost three decades-old Kaunda government, only to find that its successor showed the same authoritarian tendencies-provides another illustration. The administration of Frederick Chiluba (1991-2001), implementing deeply unpopular economic policies, found the Mugabe model an attractive prescription for boosting its flagging support. Demonizing homosexuals-to which it devoted several months in 1998-provided a useful distraction, and a convenient way of gaining political credit with both Christian churches and rural traditionalists. Yet it confirmed an indifference to rights protections that steadily characterized how the government answeredother challenges to its political control.\n\nThese examples are telling. They reiterate that an assault launched against one group may signal an erosion of the rights of others. Yet they also suggest that the stigma attached to sexual nonconformity can be a test of democratic process¾a measure of the latitude it offers political as well as personal dissent. The condition of the most vulnerable people and the most marginalized identities in a society should serve as a barometer of its openness and civic maturity.\n\nFor Zimbabwe's government, verbal fusillades against homosexuals proved the opening shots in a violent campaign against all independent social movements and any organized opposition. Meanwhile, for Namibia's NGOs, defending homosexuals was not a \"private\" issue but a crux and condition for defending civil society itself. That government and those organizations grasped the same insight. Affirming the equality of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people means negating the state's claim to ironclad control over the person, as well as over what can appear or be expressed in the public sphere. It is a step toward developing African democracy.\n\nA third context for this report involves the question of identity¾of where terms such as \"gay\" and \"lesbian\" come from, and what, in an African context, they may mean.\n\nUnable to protect their populations against the public health disaster generated by HIV/AIDS, as well as political and economic crisis, southern African governments have fallen back on the language of protecting \"cultural authenticity.\" Ironically, the quest for such \"authenticity\" often takes up the tools of colonial oppression. Politicians in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, and Namibia all defend archaic sodomy laws as bulwarks of integrity against Western incursions.\n\nYet the laws themselves are alien to any \"African culture.\" They are colonial importations-brought in by British and Dutch settlers, modeled on European codes, but enforced with particular intensity against \"native\" sexual conduct which colonials, always both prurient and puritanical, saw as exotically unrestrained.\n\nAnd arguably, it is the Mugabes and Nujomas of southern Africa, purveyors of the idea that homosexuality is \"un-African,\" who have helped create the identity of the \"homosexual\" in the region.\n\nTerminologies for sexual conduct and experience are multifarious. (A glossary of some key terms as we employ them can be found at the beginning of this report.) Many common terms are of surprisingly recent coinage. And clearly many such labels would neither be recognized nor accepted by all the people they are intended to describe-or by all the people who face discrimination because of the description. Many men who have sex with men, in Africa or elsewhere, might not even know the terms \"homosexual\" or \"gay.\" A biological woman in Zambia who regularly wears men's clothing may consider herself a \"hermaphrodite\" or a man-and might reject the term \"transgender\" with incomprehension.\n\nThis is more than a matter of translation. The concept of \"sexual orientation\"-as a way for people to cement a public identity built around the sex of the person for whom they feel desire-is unfamiliar to many cultures. In some situations, including many studied in this report, women may think of themselves instead in terms of how they correspond or not to \"feminine\" codes of conduct or appearance. In some situations, including many studied in this report, men may similarly see their looks or dress or mannerisms as defining them more than their desires-or may see the sexual role they play (as penetrator or penetrated partner in a sex act) as more significant than the sex of their desired object.\n\nIt is clear that homosexual conduct-desire for, and erotic acts or emotional relationships between, people of the same sex-has always existed throughout Africa, as everywhere in the world. Yet homosexual identity, and the concept of \"sexual orientation,\" have not. Those concepts (as Michel Foucault affirmed, and historians have detailed) developed in particular, Western contexts-as ways of interpreting the fact of homosexual conduct, and attaching individual as well as social meaning to it.\n\nThis does not mean that people who adopt the label \"homosexual\" in non-Western cultural settings are somehow \"inauthentic.\" No one receives an identity-social or familial, as \"son\" or \"chief,\" for instance-in pristine and undiluted form from society or tradition; it always takes on personal and internal meanings, as well as shadings from the social surroundings and the historical moment. Similarly, people who identify as \"homosexual\" or \"gay\" or \"lesbian\" in a cultural situation where the term is new do not merely adopt an unbroken set of imported associations. They creatively adapt the term and its meaning to their own conditions and their cultural inheritance.\n\nThe rhetoric of a Mugabe or a Nujoma has given many men and women experiencing same-sex desire in Zimbabwe or Namibia a name for themselves. They do not take the terms \"homosexual\" or \"lesbian\" or \"gay\" from a foreign cadre of cultural corrupters; they take it from the words of their political leaders. In this sense, Mugabe and Nujoma are indeed \"promoters\" of \"homosexuality\" in their societies.\n\nYet the people who assume this identity and name use them for purposes rooted in their own place and time. In particular, in interviews with numerous men and women throughout southern Africa, it became evident that many defined their sexual and emotional desires, and the intricacy of identity based on those desires, not as a matter of \"sexual orientation,\" but rather as one of gender. They experienced themselves as defined not so much by whom they desired, as by how they appeared and acted.\n\nMen attracted to men, and women attracted to women, built their identities less around that erotic need itself than around their crossing of culturally stipulated boundaries between masculinity and femininity. Their self-images derived from defying convention and asserting uniqueness by flouting, in their everyday dress and conduct, expectations of what a \"man\" or \"woman\" should be. They deployed terms such as \"gay\" or \"lesbian\" strategically, as ways of becoming recognizable and visible to one another (and, sometimes, to the international community) and creating a subculture where people could turn for safety and self-defense. Yet many believed that they faced discrimination and hatred not because people imagined, and loathed, what they did sexually-but because people looked at them and saw a man refusing to be a \"man,\" or a woman refusing to be a \"woman.\"\n\nThat the identity means something different does not make the discrimination less real. As IGLHRC has elsewhere written,\n\nAny group identity is subject to contest and continual redefinition; yet arguments, whether external or internal to the group, about the meanings of key terms in no way mitigate the reality of hatred or the ubiquity of unequal treatment. Racism is no less dangerous because the meaning of \"race\" has been questioned or reconfigured by scientific or political discourses. Anti-Semitism does not abate because Jews and anti-Semites alike may argue the definition of a Jew…. The fluidity of identity neither constrains prejudice, nor palliates it.\n\nIn fostering hatred toward people called \"gays\" and \"lesbians,\" Mugabe and Nujoma also further a suffusive suspicion in which families, neighbors, co-workers, and police are all alert for the tell-tale signs of non-conformity that they equate with guilt. Gestures become giveaways. Girls and boys and men and women who fail to adhere to rigid norms dictating how they must walk, talk, dress, and act, find a name waiting for them, an interpretation ready for their idiosyncrasies, and an identity poised to be imposed-one they may or may not wish to claim. In effect, they are condemned as much for their self-expression as for their presumed \"sexual orientation.\"\n\nWhere comparable violations of the freedom of expression happen in other contexts, human rights activists respond. When repressive governments discriminate against women by imposing and enforcing dress codes, we recognize that the freedom of expression is at issue, threatened by unwarranted control of personal choice in how the body is presented and seen. Yet many human rights activists find their sympathy exhausted when the acts of expression being punished fall outside a gendered norm-when females dress or act in a way which defies general definitions of \"femininity,\" or when males flout a socially imposed codification of manhood. When employers fire them, when the police arrest them, when their communities reject them, the victims themselves are often blamed for wanting to dress and express themselves outside those rigid norms.\n\nThis silence leaves the field of public life to the voices of political leaders who incite hatred in order to institutionalize intolerance. The silence and the ensuing violence must end.\n\nC. Brief Recommendations\n\nThe campaign of hate in southern Africa raises basic questions. Those committed to the defence of rights must decide whether the promises in treaties, and the commitments made by civil societies, are in fact universal-or whether marginalization, moral particularism, and stigma can exclude unpopular individuals and groups from their scope.\n\nAmid armed conflict, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the collapse of health care and educational systems, and inequalities within countries and among continents that defy every principle of social justice, the consequences of political leaders vilifying marginalized groups may seem small. They are not. These attacks serve as a political distraction from urgent social and economic needs. They divert debate away from reaching solutions, toward seeking scapegoats. They strike at communities' capacity to accommodate diversity and accept change.\n\nFinally, left unchallenged, they subtly but inexorably reduce rights protections back to the level of a popularity contest. Preaching that dignity is denied those whom a consensus deems despised, they make freedoms depend not on the sense of a shared humanity but on opinion polls. Discrimination is by definition not directed at those whom a society wholeheartedly embraces and respects. It is aimed at those reviled and rejected, made vulnerable by stigma. And official intolerance is most dangerous when the contempt for its objects is most generally shared. State rhetoric then helps make hatred appear an ordinary, accepted, expected part of public life. Tolerating those first attacks creates a climate in which attacks on human rights escalate and spread. Politically motivated intolerance toward minorities is often just the initial salvo in an assault on the fundamental principle of equality and respect for the inherent dignity of all human beings.\n\nSouthern African leaders must reverse the trend toward division, discrimination, and abuse. Human Rights Watch and IGLHRC call on states and state officials to:\n\n·refrain from statements promoting intolerance and from inciting discrimination and abuse;\n\n·repeal laws, including \"sodomy laws,\" which violate human rights, including the rights to privacy and freedom of expression;\n\n·change or repeal other laws which discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, including laws on rape and domestic violence, or laws which deny access to marriage and related benefits to same-sex couples; and\n\n·enact positive protections against discrimination, including discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nIt is not enough for states to recognize rights. They must be realized. Paper protections must be made understandable and accessible even to the most disempowered populations. States, including South Africa, must turn existing constitutional promises into law, policy, and practice. State officials themselves must be trained to implement protections fully and fairly. Human Rights Watch and IGLHRC call on states to:\n\n·publicize and promote awareness of rights protections and how to use them;\n\n·create and allocate adequate resources to accessible forms of remedy for human rights violations, with mechanisms empowered and informed to address the specific needs of vulnerable populations;\n\n·ensure that legal representation and legal remedy are economically and practically accessible to everyone; and\n\n·train state officials, particularly throughout the criminal justice system, in human rights and non-discrimination, and in sensitivity to gender and to minorities and vulnerable groups.\n\nFinally, civil society has responsibilities as well. The examples of Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa show how human rights activists willing to defend the most marginalized members of society also safeguard the basic institutions of democracy. The decay of those institutions in Zimbabwe shows the dangers of inaction when intolerance first appears. Human Rights Watch and IGLHRC call on civil society actors, and particularly human rights movements to:\n\n·speak out whenever state officials incite or practice discrimination or abuse; and\n\n·seek out marginalized and stigmatized groups, and work to bring their concerns into the mainstream of human rights and other social movements.\n\nDetailed recommendations can be found at the end of this report.\n\nII. The Spread of Homophobic Rhetoric in Southern Africa\n\nThis chapter identifies the leaders who helped, and some who hindered, the spread of homophobia in southern Africa-and records the words they used to do it. The rest of this report explores the consequences.\n\nA. Zimbabwe: From Book Fair to Book Burning\n\nIt started with a celebration. On August 1, 1995, the Zimbabwe International Book Fair (ZIBF) opened in Harare. In the twelve years of its existence, the event had become a centerpiece of African intellectual life, an opportunity for writers, critics, and publishers across the continent to converse. The theme of the 1995 fair was \"Human rights and justice.\"\n\nMore was inaugurated than the fair itself. A campaign of intolerance began which has continued for over seven years.\n\nOn July 24, the fair's organizers-an independent trust-had received a letter from a government official condemning the decision to allot a booth to a small human rights organization called Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (GALZ). \"The Government strongly objects to the presence of the GALZ stand at the Book Fair which has the effect of giving acceptance and legitimacy to GALZ,\" the letter read. \"Whilst acknowledging the dynamic nature of culture, the fact still remains that both Zimbabwean society and government do not accept the public display of homosexual literature and material…. In the interest of continued cooperation with the Government, please, withdraw the participation of GALZ at this public event.\"\n\nThe panicked trustees asked GALZ to remove itself voluntarily from the book fair; the organization refused. Founded in 1989, GALZ had served to network and support a small, closeted community of self-identified gays and lesbians. Initially most of its membership was white; now it was trying to reach out to a broader community. This meant raising its public profile. GALZ had hoped the fair would be a chance to do so safely, by distributing information about its own work, about homosexuality, and about human rights.\n\nAs the fair trustees later explained, they \"were faced with a very difficult and painful decision … we had to face not only withdrawal of state participation and support but also the very real possibility of further state action or disruption of the fair itself. With great reluctance and acting under severe constraint, we withdraw acceptance of GALZ's participation.\"\n\nZimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, opened the book fair on August 1. The censorship had already drawn outrage from some prominent participants. Nonetheless, Mugabe made it the major theme of his speech. He painted homosexuals as people who flaunted their sexual conduct shamelessly; he effectively identified the book fair stand as a public sexual act. \"Human Rights and Justice,\" said Mugabe, was an issue which\n\nhas occupied the attention of the governments and people throughout the world in increasing measure over the past decade … My government is committed to the respect of human rights, and striking a practical balance among the rights of the majority versus those of minorities and the individual….\n\nFreedom, however, is not a selfish, one way street….. The greater the freedom one enjoys, the greater the responsibility one owes the community which bestows that freedom….\n\nLet me give an obvious example of a taboo here, but one which is universally recognized. While, between a married couple, sexual relations are not only permissible but expected, such relations should, however, never be seen to occur in public, for example in streets or public parks. No married couple could be heard to argue that because they have a legal right to practice sex, they can do so anywhere. This is because we all accept that the intimate nature of such relations demands privacy.\n\nSupposing those persons who believe that the denial of their alleged rights to have sex in public is a violation of their human rights formed an association in defence and protection of it and proceeded to write booklets and other forms of literature on the subject of their rights. Is any sane government which is a protector of society's moral values expected to countenance their accessions?\n\nI find it extremely outrageous and repugnant to my human conscience that such immoral and repulsive organisations, like those of homosexuals who offend both against the law of nature and the morals of religious beliefs espoused by our society, should have any advocates in our midst and even elsewhere in the world.\n\nIf we accept homosexuality as a right, as is being argued by the association of sodomists and sexual perverts, what moral fibre shall our society ever have to deny organised drug addicts, or even those given to bestiality, the rights they might claim and allege they possess under the rubric of individual freedom and human rights, including the freedom of the Press to write, publish and publicise their literature on them?\n\nOfficial homophobia was not new in Zimbabwe. Arrests had long happened, and GALZ members' apartments had been raided in recent years. Indeed, the state-sponsored press had, throughout 1994 and 1995, carried an increasing number of sensational articles about homosexuals; in one, the minister of home affairs stated, \"We are going to arrest them. It is illegal in this country.\" Mugabe had already condemned homosexuality as \"abominable and destructive\" in a speech in early 1995.\n\nMugabe, first elected in 1980 when Zimbabwe held its first all-race elections, was facing growing opposition by the late 1990s. To deflect criticism, he turned to the issue of land redistribution. He also increasingly blamed the country's affluent white minority for Zimbabwe's ills. Homosexuality, which the president had discovered galvanized press and public alike, became an additional tool for discrediting Zimbabwe's whites. (GALZ at the time was still a largely white organization, itself significantly hampered by internal racism. It became almost exclusively black in the following years, partly as a result of Mugabe's vilification-as gays and lesbians from high-density areas sought out the organization for support amid mounting community and family pressures, and as many whites left in fear of a government crackdown.)\n\nIn a stream of pronouncements Mugabe returned obsessively to the question of \"homosexuals,\" \"sodomists,\" and \"perverts.\" \"I don't believe they have any rights at all,\" he told reporters after his book fair speech. Less than two weeks later, speaking on a national holiday, he said that homosexuality \"degrades human dignity. It's unnatural and there is no question ever of allowing these people to behave worse than dogs and pigs.\" He told his listeners, \"What we are being persuaded to accept is sub-animal behaviour and we will never allow it here. If you see people parading themselves as lesbians and gays, arrest them and hand them over to the police.\" And when a group of U.S. members of Congress sent Mugabe a letter of protest, he told supporters of his ruling party ZANU-PF, \"Let the Americans keep their sodomy, bestiality, stupid and foolish ways to themselves, out of Zimbabwe…. Let them be gay in the US, Europe and elsewhere…. They shall be sad people here.\"\n\nSeveral notes Mugabe struck would be repeated again and again, by his supporters and by other politicians, in Zimbabwe and elsewhere. There was the notion that rights have limits, that some people by definition cannot enjoy them-that the idea of a common human dignity is incompatible with preserving national or local particularity. If humanity could not be universal, though, the nation must be uniform: there was the question of cultural authenticity, the defense of an apparently cohesive and consensus-founded identity, either country- or continent-wide, against external invasion or internal differentiation. And there was the very question of terminology: who exactly were the enemies Mugabe combatted? Were they \"gays and lesbians\"; \"homosexuals\"; or, more archaically, \"sodomists\" or even practitioners of bestiality?\n\nOne Zimbabwean parliamentarian resorted to a-seemingly non-standard-dictionary in a subsequent debate:\n\nI looked up a number of authorities and the sum total of all these definitions is this one. These homosexuals are people given to social pleasures. This is one definition. The second definition says these are people given to inordinate pleasure. The third definition describes them as licentious and this means morally rotten and promiscuous. The fourth definition describes them as lecherous, this means lewd, unchaste, base, and given to debauchery….\n\nWhat is at issue in cultural terms is a conflict of interest between the whole body, which is the Zimbabwean community and part of that body represented by individuals or groups of individuals.-The whole body is more important than any single dispensable part. When your finger starts festering and becomes a danger to the body you cut it off. -The homosexuals are the festering finger.\n\nControversies over GALZ's participation threatened to become a regular feature of the book fair. In 1996, GALZ again applied for a stand. The fair trustees promised to resist government pressure; the government promised not to apply it. A week before the fair began, however, the Ministry of Information announced a government order barring GALZ from appearing-\"to protect and guarantee the cultural health of the country from possible erosion.\" The banning order did not actually appear in writing. GALZ therefore continued to plan on participating. However-anticipating how the Mugabe regime would deal with other political opponents in future-shadowy threats of mob action surfaced. A leader of a \"student group\" was quoted in the government press as saying,\n\nWe are ready to raze down the stands and go to jail. Our actions will be for a noble cause. We want to protect the values of our culture. The essence of the fair should be exhibiting what the country has achieved and can offer in literal arts, and absolutely not homosexuality.\n\nAt a preliminary conference on national book policy, noisy demonstrators protested the book fair's trustees. Finally, the day before the fair opened, the chairman of the Board of Censors issued a hastily written order to the trustees, prohibiting GALZ from appearing, \"based on 17(1) of the Censorship and Entertainment Control Act\"-a provision allowing the state to ban any exhibition or entertainment which is \"undesirable\" or likely to cause \"breaches of the peace, disorderly or immoral behavior.\" The order indicated that the trustees as well as GALZ members could be jailed if GALZ appeared.\n\nThe book fair trustees stated they would comply. However, GALZ rapidly sued the government, saying it was standing up \"not just for gay rights but for the holistic principle of freedom of speech, which applies to all individuals and communities in this country.\" On the second day of the fair, the Harare High Court set aside the government's ban. The judge held that the government could not censor material without examining it first. GALZ had taken its stand in court. Now it took over its stand at the fair.\n\nHowever, hostile crowds menaced the exhibition. According to a GALZ statement,\n\nOn the second public day …GALZ was forcibly prevented from taking up its position at the Fair because a violent mob, led by Public Prosecutor Herbert Ushewokunze, descended on the GALZ stand. The Public Prosecutor stated that he and his followers represented \"the People's Court\" and that they \"did not care about High Court Rulings.\" This provided concrete evidence of a direct link between government and the violence against GALZ.\n\nGALZ left its stand symbolically empty until the last day of the fair, when they took up a position at the margins of the exhibition ground-so as to be able to escape if violence recurred. It did: at mid-day, reports came that a mob was approaching the fair. GALZ members left; a small book burning followed. According to the organization, \"The mob trashed the stand and tried to burn remnants of the literature around the stand.\"\n\nOther nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were mixed in their responses to the GALZ controversies. When, in 1997, a Zimbabwean politician launched a campaign to have homosexuals whipped and castrated, a leader of the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, a human rights group, spoke out against him. Others were more tepid. Indeed, the government adeptly used the issue to divide civil society. In 1997, GALZ joined the \"Sixteen Days of Activism\" campaign, a coalition of organizations drawing attention to rights violations against women. The state-controlled Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation withdrew prime-time radio and T.V. programming it had offered the coalition, accusing it of being \"a front for GALZ.\" Other members of the campaign distanced themselves from GALZ, saying the group \"should first resolve its difficulties with government before involving itself in coalition business.\" GALZ eventually withdrew from the campaign.\n\nMany of Zimbabwe's churches joined in denouncing homosexuals. In 1996, campaigning for re-election-and for the votes of church members-Mugabe had specifically appealed to pastors to stand with him in condemning homosexuality.\n\nIn 1998, the eighth general assembly of the World Council of Churches (WCC) was due to be held in Harare, a much-anticipated publicity opportunity for the regime. The assembly would include a \"Padare\" or public space for discussions and exhibitions by accredited groups and NGOs. GALZ applied to participate. Even two years before the assembly began, however, local churches made it clear they would oppose GALZ's presence. At a 1996 press conference announcing the upcoming assembly, Anglican Bishop Jonathan Siyachitema, president of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC)-the hosting organization-used the occasion to denounce homosexuality: \"We are not going to allow, as a Christian body, gays in our council and destroy that which we cherish: our culture,\" he said. He added, \"if people want to masquerade as homosexuals\" at the assembly, \"we declare that the law must take its course.\"\n\nNot all church members agreed. Ecumenical Support Services, a progressive lay body within the Anglican church, sponsored GALZ's application, and on that basis the WCC initially approved it. As word that GALZ might actually appear at the Padare spread, however, local churches mobilized against it. A group called Concerned Christians began circulating a petition to bar GALZ. Bishop Siyachitema again took to newspaper columns, stressing the opposition of the ZCC: \"We feel that Zimbabweans should not be coerced into a practice that is alien to them.\" The Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe said, \"the WCC is putting us to shame, when our politicians are the ones who have to preach to the church that homosexuality is wrong.\" By July, over twenty Protestant churches had stated their objections. The press whipped up outrage. One writer declared, \"Christianity the world over has been slowly accepting such evils like homosexuals in their denominations because Christian denominations are dividing themselves endlessly…. We expected their representatives to stand for justice, that is to represent the views of the majority of this country.\" A state newspaper editorialized that \"the majority on a daily basis silently looks away to accommodate these sexual perverts as they go about their pastime. But for them to want to propagate their 'faith' at conferences is stretching people's patience a bit too far.\"\n\nThe WCC itself faced internal rifts on the issue of homosexuality. Some members, particularly in Europe and the United States, pressed for an open discussion of sexual diversity; many of these wished to move the assembly to another country, in response to Mugabe's rhetoric and human rights record. Other member churches, particularly Eastern Orthodox ones, were determined to exclude homosexuality from the assembly's agenda, threatening a boycott if the debate took place. The WCC was clearly unwilling to defend an embattled gay group, and in the end moved to eliminate GALZ's potentially divisive presence, which it knew would spur such a debate through publicity alone. It told GALZ that an endorsement from a lay institution was insufficient. To participate, it needed the support of a bona fide church.\n\nNo church in Zimbabwe, and none in neighboring South Africa, was willing to take up GALZ, in the face of the militant opposition of politicians and the ZCC. The organization was finally denied accreditation, though it was able to bring some members into the Padare under the auspices of a sympathetic human rights NGO.\n\n\"Animals in the jungle are better than these people because at least they know that this is a man or a woman,\" President Mugabe said in a 1998 speech. In the same speech Mugabe criticized the independent media: \"In Britain you will never find a paper that speaks bad about that country; why then in Zimbabwe do we not adopt a common ideology?\" Mugabe grew more and more dependent on his own stable of state-controlled media, and increasingly the work of harassing GALZ was left to them. The Herald and its sister paper, the Sunday Mail, both state-controlled, steadily tried to embarrass the NGO.\n\nIn May 1998, for example, the Sunday Mail published a front-page article accusing GALZ of running a brothel from its office, as well as showing pornographic videos. (At the time, GALZ was able to rent premises in a low-density area of Harare. There, it offered counselling services for people dealing with issues of sexuality and of HIV, along with a resource library and a social gathering-place.) The reporter, who claimed to have inside knowledge of GALZ's dealings, said the organization provided sex to foreigners, noting that \"After one party I saw some tourists leaving the centre, accompanied by more than one teenager.\" According to Keith Goddard, GALZ's programmes manager, the reporter had earlier joined the organization undercover, with the mission of finding or fabricating a scandal to discredit GALZ.\n\nGALZ demanded, but never received, a retraction. Both the Herald and the Sunday Mail continued to amass accusations against the organization. One week later, the Sunday Mail alleged that GALZ members had made death threats against its reporters. Two weeks after that, it charged the \"controversial organization\" of holding \"rowdy parties\" featuring \"public indecency.\" Other headlines proclaimed \"Opposition mounts against gays, lesbians\" and \"Homosexuality is morally bankrupt.\"\n\nThe allegations began at the same time Goddard was arrested on blatantly false charges of \"sodomy\" (described in Chapter III below)-and helped build animosity toward him and his work in the public mind. They also came as Canaan Banana, the former president of Zimbabwe and Mugabe's revolutionary comrade-in-arms, faced trial for \"sodomy\" as well, in a well-publicized scandal. (See Appendix, \"Before the Law.\") Goddard's arrest and the campaign against GALZ may have drawn attention away from the embarassing proximity of a \"sodomite\" to the present president\n\nWhile the press continues to pursue GALZ, Mugabe has taken up grander themes. His concern has moved from the presence of homosexuals within Zimbabwe to visions of external coalitions against the country. Internationally isolated, he sees constellations of conspiratorial homosexuals opposing him.. These visions have multiplied since, in October 1999, Mugabe was subjected to a citizen's arrest by a British gay activist while shopping in London. Press and government whipped up outrage against Britain: at a Commonwealth meeting, Mugabe accused \"gangster gays\" of working for the British \"gangster regime.\" He told a meeting of traditional leaders in Zimbabwe that Britain sought to promote homosexuality in Zimbabwe: \"We are against this homosexuality and we as chiefs in Zimbabwe should fight against such Western practices and respect our culture…. Let us fight against the enemy.\" He repeatedly accused U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair's government of being controlled by homosexuals.\n\nAt campaign rallies for the 2002 presidential election, Mugabe emphasized that he had \"real men\" around him. He called on Tony Blair to \"expose\" his cabinet, saying, \"I have people who are married in my cabinet. He has homosexuals and they make John marry Joseph and let Mary get married to Rosemary…. We can form clubs, but we will never have homosexual clubs. In fact, we will punish them.\"\n\nIn April 2002 the head of one of the main mouthpieces of Mugabe's many denunciations, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, Alum Mpofu, was forced to resign. He had allegedly been caught having sex with a man in a Harare nightclub. In June 2002, an opposition legislator testified in a court case that he had heard rumors of an affair between Mpofu and Mugabe's powerful minister of information, Jonathan Moyo. With homosexuality threatening to intrude in the highest echelons of Zimbabwe's government, Mugabe reportedly ordered a \"witch hunt\" against any homosexuals in his administration. One South African newspaper asserted that Mugabe asked his Central Intelligence Organisation, responsible for state security and the president's protection, to assemble lists of gays in official service. A source told a Zimbabwean reporter that \"The president made it clear that the world would see him as a hypocrite if he attacked … Tony Blair for having a cabinet full of gays when these very same people are said to be in his administration.\"\n\nRita Makarau, then a member of Parliament from Mugabe's ZANU-PF party, and a politician often presented as a liberal face of the regime, told us in 2000 that\n\nI believe lesbians and gays were indeed always part of our society. There was not tolerance as such; but a spirit that if they only kept to themselves we would not interfere. The problem, you know, is that there is not a culture of human rights in Zimbabwe. I try to look to the future, to rights that can be interpreted or gained through jurisprudence. I try to say to people, \"give us five years!\"\n\nB. Namibia: Obsession and Opportunism\n\nMugabe's statements drew international condemnation, but also international imitation. In neighboring Namibia Gwen Lister, publisher of the Namibian, the country's main independent press organ, remembers how startled she was when homosexuality became a political question there, in the months after Mugabe exploited it.\n\nMany people were a bit confused at the time: it's years after independence, we've never heard a word about these things, why suddenly is this becoming an issue? If I'm asked the question, I think it's really opportunistic, I think at times it's a question of finding a scapegoat when things go wrong.… Don't forget, to a very large degree, the people they are speaking to are in the rural areas, are not illiterate but peasant folk that they are talking to about these things, and making it seem as though all these whites from all over the world are coming here to Namibia to turn black Namibians into gays and lesbians…. If there's been a huge scandal of corruption then suddenly they'll shout the odds about gays and lesbians…. It's something that seems to happen in waves. You'll find right at this time [November 2001] that the gay and lesbian issue isn't on the national agenda at all. But who's to say that come December when something else happens, it's not suddenly going to be put right in people's faces once again?\n\nThe first wave started among lower officials-but, as Lister says, \"the trend began with the president. There's absolutely no question about that…. In order to please the president, other figures who are not as high on the political spectrum as he join in by making these noises from time to time.\"\n\nIn October 1995, only months after the Harare Book Fair controversy, Namibia's deputy minister for lands, resettlement, and rehabilitation told a reporter that \"Homosexuality is like cancer or AIDS and everything should be done to stop its spread in Namibia.\" He urged that gays and lesbians be \"operated on to remove unnatural hormones,\" and tied the struggle against external perversion to the liberation struggle: according to the reporter, he \"said he did not take up arms to fight for an immoral society, neither does he want his children to live in such a corrupt state.\" Soon after, Namibia's finance minister, Helmut Angula, wrote a long article arguing that \"homosexuality is an unnatural behavioural disorder which is alien to African culture … [and] a product of industrialised society, where there is plenty of boredom and unbridled materialism, as well as liberalism bordering on anarchy.\"\n\nAnother wave came in 1998. Late that year, Minister of Home Affairs Jerry Ekandjo stated in the National Assembly that he planned to introduce new legislation against homosexual acts. \"It is my considered opinion,\" he said, \"that the so-called gay rights can never qualify as human rights. They are wrongly claimed because it is inimical to true Namibian culture, African culture and religion. They should be classified as human wrongs which must rank as sin against society and God.\"\n\nNo such legislation was ever introduced. Two years later, however, the minister returned to the subject. Speaking to a group of newly graduated police officers in October 2000, he urged them to \"eliminate\" gays and lesbians \"from the face of Namibia,\" saying that the \"Constitution does not guarantee rights for gays and lesbians,\" and that police must take measures to combat all such \"unnatural acts, including murder.\" An opposition MP demanded clarification from the minister on the floor of the National Assembly. Ekandjo answered that \"elimination does not only mean to kill. According to the dictionary meaning, elimination may also mean to ignore, put aside, and [get] rid of.\" However, he insisted, \"We never had moffies [a derogatory term for gay or effeminate men widely used in the region] in mind when SWAPO drafted the Namibian Constitution ten years ago.\"\n\nMost conspicuously, however, President Nujoma has periodically weighed in in statements closely echoing Mugabe's, with sometimes vague, sometimes ominously specific threats. In December 1996, Nujoma declared that \"all necessary steps must be taken to combat influences that are influencing us and our children in a negative way. Homosexuals must be condemned and rejected in our society.\" In the ensuing controversy-with the feminist organization Sister Namibia strongly criticizing the president's remarks-the ruling South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) party swung strongly behind its leader, effectively making homophobia a political platform in Namibia. In what observers called an \"unprecedented\" move, the party issued a statement supporting the president, threatening his opponents, and vowing to \"uproot\" homosexuality:\n\nIt should be noted that most of ardent supporters of this perverts [sic] are Europeans who imagine themselves to be the bulwark of civilization and enlightenment …\n\nIf there is a matter which must be dealt with utmost urgency, it is the need to revitalise our inherent culture and its moral values which we have identified with foreign immoral values. Promotion of homosexuality in our society scorns many sets of our values…\n\nThe moral values of our nation, as defended by the President, incorporate the fundamental principles of nature and should not be equated to the vile practices of homosexuals which has a backlash. Homosexuality deserves a severe contempt and disdain from the Namibian people and should be uprooted totally as a practice.\n\nNujoma has repeated his threats regularly. Later in 1997, he warned the SWAPO Youth League that homosexuals \"should not impose on the human rights of others. The youth should be vigilant and guard against foreigners who claim to know development and democracy better than us…. Where were they when we sacrificed our lives during the liberation struggle?\" In 2000, attending a cultural gathering where a chief spoke in condemnation of homosexuality, Nujoma urged parents and traditional leaders \"to whip\" those who refused to follow cultural norms, \"because culture is the fundamental source of respect and wisdom of any given nation.\"\n\nA rapid-fire series of statements from Nujoma came early in the next year. In March 2001, the president told university students that \"The Republic of Namibia does not allow homosexuality, lesbianism here. Police are ordered to arrest you, and deport you and imprison you too.\" In April 2001, he voiced horror at recent weddings of same-sex couples in the Netherlands. He warned homosexuals would be barred from entering Namibia: \"If they arrive at the Hosea Kutako Airport, we'll send them back with the same aircraft-if they are couples or found to be homosexuals.\" And he added, \"The constitution is being misinterpreted by colonialists who are confused. They are using the constitution to protect homosexuals and lesbians in an irresponsible way.\" In the same month, he urged traditional leaders and local officials to \"see to it that there are no criminals, gays and lesbians in your villages and regions.\" Later that month he elaborated on the theme at a SWAPO rally, criticizing the forces of \"imperialism\" and saying that \"The enemy is still trying to come back with sinister manoeuvres and tricks called lesbians and homosexuality and globalisation. These are all madness and they claim to be Christians…. They colonised us and now they claim human rights when we condemn and reject them. In Namibia there will be no lesbian and homosexual [sic] left.\"\n\nAlso in early 2001, Nujoma told an interviewer that\n\nEach nation, each people on earth have their own cultures, way of life. But I detest the way human rights [are] being put that they [homosexuals] should parade in the streets behaving like animals…. God created a man and a woman separately. Now we have women marrying each other and men marrying each other. What is this madness? You must remain with your cultures in Europe. Don't bring it to Namibia because we are not going to impose our cultures on you.\n\nWhen the interviewer, a German-born Namibian citizen, asked how such comments corresponded to the constitution, Nujoma grew agitated:\n\nThat is a constitution that was made by SWAPO, we are the ones who fought for the liberation of this country for you to talk about a constitution. What do you know about [a] constitution? You sided with the enemy here!… Keep away your system of corruption, anti-God and animal behaviour from the Republic of Namibia.\n\nThe interviewer asked again about \"gay and lesbianism\" and Nujoma replied:\n\nKeep away from our country, please. Don't repeat those words. They are unacceptable here. If you want us to work with you, respect our laws and respect our rights. Those words you are mentioning are un-Namibian.\n\nThe government was prepared to punish civil society actors for using the \"un-Namibian\" words. Little more than a year before the interview quoted above, Nujoma's administration had tried to discredit the country's largest women's rights organization, for including a reference to gay and lesbian rights in an advocacy document. Sister Namibia, a feminist NGO, had organized other civil society actors to collaborate on a document called the Namibian Women's Manifesto: the goal was to support and publicize the government's National Gender Policy, turning its generalizations into specific recommendations relevant to everyday life. The twenty-five-page document contained only two references to lesbians-one including them in a list of women to be protected from discrimination; another asking political parties to state their stances on gay and lesbian rights. Five days before the manifesto's release in 1999, the SWAPO Women's Council condemned it, saying that it differed from the state policy in that \"they included homosexuality issues in their so-called manifesto…. They have to find another platform to address homosexuality and not within the context of gender issues.\" The head of the national Department of Women's Affairs said the manifesto \"has no other message than asking women in Namibia to promote homosexuality.\" State agencies distanced themselves from NGOS associated with the manifesto; unsubtle pressures were applied to divide civil society and isolate Sister Namibia.\n\nThe controversy over the Women's Manifesto pitted the ruling party's women's league against independent feminist organizers from civil society. Sister Namibia is headed by an open lesbian, Elizabeth Khaxas; the accusations of \"promoting homosexuality\" were in part aimed at her work. In 1996, when Nujoma launched his first comments against homosexuality, he chose a meeting of the SWAPO Women's Council to do so. Even then, some feminists took this as a message: that respectable women worked within the state and party, while deviants pursued activism outside.\n\nCivil society has in fact responded to SWAPO's attacks. From the beginning, in 1995, Sister Namibia had criticized official homophobia, stating publicly that \"We believe that gays and lesbians should have the same rights as heterosexuals in all spheres of life.\" The next year, it boldly condemned the utterances of the president himself, declaring, \"We must stand up now together and speak out against this or any other kind of hate speech and oppression against any member of our communities.\" When Minister Ekandjo threatened anti-gay legislation in 1998, other NGOs opposed him. The National Society for Human Rights (NSHR) had produced gay-friendly educational materials ; its president, Phil ya Nangoloh, told us that year, \"We do not tolerate discrimination on any grounds. We think government has run out of issues, and wants to whip up emotion by talking about gayness. It is behaving ridiculously, like an elephant chasing a squirrel.\"\n\nIn 1997, Sister Namibia provided space and helped gay men and lesbians found their own network for support and advocacy, called The Rainbow Project (TRP). In 2001, when Nujoma threatened lesbians and gays with arrest and deportation, TRP was able to build a coalition in response. The National Society for Human Rights issued press releases and an open letter to the president condemning the threats. TRP called for a march to affirm the freedom and safety of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people. As word of the march spread, the organizers began hearing of threats, including a statement by SWAPO Youth League that the \"march will never take place.\" Human rights activists in Windhoek supported the original organizers and turned the rally into a \"march for the human rights of all.\" More than one thousand people rallied at the event; all the major human rights groups were involved. Some NGOs expressed private support for the march but declined to participate because they were dependent on SWAPO for funding. After the march, President Nujoma asked, \"How dare they march in a country we liberated?\"\n\nStill, Ian Swartz, TRP's coordinator, says that fear has impeded the group's efforts to provide counselling and support services to people abused or discriminated against for their sexual orientation or gender identity. According to Swartz, most lesbians and gay men are so frightened of being identified that they will not come to TRP's quarters in Windhoek. The group provides almost all their services through a telephone hotline.\n\nStaff at NSHR have also noted an increase in attacks on their work, Phil ya Nangoloh told Human Rights Watch in 2001. \"Those of us who work at the society have been attacked as traitors, as spies, and for being un-African. We've also been attacked for promoting homosexuality because we are critical of the attacks by the president and the minister of home affairs and by the SFF [Special Field Forces]. We are not promoting homosexuality, we are promoting human rights.\" Ya Nangoloh added, \"Gays and lesbians have been in Africa for a long time-we have words in our local language for gay people. They are not a threat to the president. But we can't ignore what he's said because it is becoming very dangerous.\"\n\nNorman Tjombe of the Legal Action Center (LAC) believes that SWAPO is trying to distract its constituencies from its failure to address mass unemployment, land reform issues, and a growing HIV epidemic. \"Perverse sex\" is a perfect diversion. \"In our culture we have strong ideas regarding men and women. Men are strong-women are submissive. No other expression of sexuality is permitted. Nujoma knows that most Namibians are intolerant of homosexuality, so he attacks gays and lesbians. The government is making attacks on homosexuality a central part of its outlook. But it will not end with homosexuality-it is to create a culture of intolerance-a culture that will grow. Either we change this culture and become more tolerant or it will get worse.\"\n\nSwartz also expressed concern about the culture of intolerance the state promotes. \"First it was attacks on homosexuals. Then it became rhetoric about 'purifying' Namibia, which meant attacks on whites, Afrikaans-speaking Namibians, and then all foreigners and women who marry foreigners. Also, just like Mugabe, Nujoma is attacking landowners and the independent media.\"\n\nYa Nangoloh notes the attacks are often personal. Independent judges have been vilified for deciding against the government: \"Individuals have been attacked as traitors, as foreigners, racists, reactionaries, and imperialists.\" Ya Nangoloh himself has been called, in a government press release, a traitor who \"DESERTED the national liberation struggle\" and \"vilifies the SWAPO government\" to \"receive his daily bread from his sponsors.\"\n\nGwen Lister of the Namibian also observes that the attacks on homosexuals are often \"personally directed.\" Another activist says, \"It is a small country and they know who to target. You mustn't think that they are talking about a group in general. They know who they mean.\"\n\nFor example, Elizabeth Khaxas and her German-born partner, Liz Frank, fought a years-long legal battle to have their relationship recognized for immigration purposes. Although they had lived together and raised a son, the Ministry of Home Affairs fought to deny Frank a residency permit, threatening her with deportation. Indeed, in 2000, Home Affairs Minister Ekandjo specifically commented in Parliament on Frank's and Khaxas' case-saying mockingly that he would remain opposed to recognizing their status as a couple \"until it is scientifically tested that they can produce a baby.\" The case reached the country's Supreme Court in 2001; in a split decision in March of that year, it found that a same-sex relationship could not be recognized by Namibian law, and could not count in favor of the application. President Nujoma's threat to \"deport\" lesbians and gays came shortly after the Supreme Court decision. It was evidently in part meant to menace Frank and Khaxas.\n\nHenning Melber, director of the Namibian Economic Research Policy Unit (NEPRU), told us in 1998:\n\nOne must look on Namibia as a traumatized place, perhaps a schizophrenic place. There is an unresolved history in this country, a history of authoritarian personality structures. The country has been through trauma, a terrible period of repression and a war. This produces a typical phenomenon of very dependent individual personalities, the result of a long history of colonialism and brutality and fear. Such personalities can easily be mobilized against a minority. And sexuality is very much bound up with fear.\n\nThen, though, there is a split in public awareness and political awareness. Repression co-exists with liberalism. One part of the government will say it wants to eradicate the enemy. Another part hurries in to say that it wants to give everyone rights.\n\nAnd the fear of the internal enemy is tied to fears of external enemies. Homophobic sentiments are mixed with xenophobic sentiments. It is terrible. And it is depressing.\n\nAs Gwen Lister had predicted, another \"wave\" of violent rhetoric may have begun. In August 2002 President Nujoma again mixed homophobia with fear of the outside. Speaking to the Namibia Public Workers Union Congress, he denounced what he called \"British imperialism\" and its anti-Mugabe stance: \"Today it is Zimbabwe, tomorrow it is Namibia or any other country. We must unite and support Zimbabwe. We cannot allow imperialism to take over our continent again.\" And he criticized wealthy countries for tying development aid to human rights, which he linked with promoting homosexuality.\n\nIn Namibia we will not allow these lesbians and gays. We fought the liberation struggle without that. We do not need it in our country . . . We have whites who are Namibian, but they must remember they have no right to force their culture on anyone. If they are lesbian, they can do it at home, but not show it in public… I warn you as workers not to allow homosexuality. Africa will be destroyed.\n\nC. Zambia: \"Wanting to Help Others Was the Worst Crime of All\"\n\nZambia, in a few months in 1998 experienced something akin to the hysterical rhetoric about homosexuality which Mugabe and Nujoma had inflicted on their countries over several years. A newspaper article describing a single, isolated gay man's experiences provoked a vast national controversy. Church leaders, NGO officials, students and professors, and professional politicians all stepped forward to voice their horror of homosexuality. The vice-president and ultimately the president of the country joined the condemnations. By the time the furor died down, homosexuals had been driven even more deeply underground, or beyond the country's borders altogether. And human rights organizations, and civil society agents in general, had been stigmatized as being agents of a foreign agenda.\n\nIn July 1998, a young man named Francis Yabe Chisambisha went to the offices of Zambia's largest independent newspaper, told them he was homosexual, and asked if they would like an interview. Reporters leapt at the chance. Chisambisha's self-revelation, his \"coming out,\" was, as he explained to our researcher later, born of wanting not to continue in concealment. The Post published Chisambisha's interview, and photograph, on its first page. The story, which used his full name, spread over three pages; it concentrated on his sexual experiences. \"I'm 25, gay, with 33 sex partners,\" said the front headline; an interior header added, \"I am gay and enjoying it …\" Buried in the article was a more moving message. Chisambisha explained why he went public:\n\nFirstly, what I want is to tell society that this gay thing has been there even before our generation. I want society to be aware that it is happening in Zambia and there are people who want to be respected for their choice. It's just that in our African culture, it's believed to be taboo and hence people do it in hiding,\" he said. \"But the fact that I am doing it, shows that this practice is there and will continue to be there as long as man is there. Our friends in South Africa and Zimbabwe and elsewhere have spoken out that they want their feelings to be respected and be allowed to enjoy their sexual preferences. That is what I want to do here in Zambia. It makes me feel bad to be criticized that what you are doing is wrong when I am not causing harm to the person I am doing it with.\n\nSecondly, Francis said he wants to form an association so that Zambian gays can fight for their rights.\n\nChisambisha told us later, \"I was alone and I wanted not to be, and I wanted to help others not to be. I found out that being alone was legal. Wanting not to be alone was criminal. Wanting to help others was the worst crime of all.\"\n\nChisambisha's confession sparked a mammoth scandal. The response was instant. The day after Chisambisha's confession, the Post was already receiving hand-delivered indignant letters. \"There is totally nothing good in being gay that one should feel that it is an achievement to come out in the open,\" one read. The rest of the press scrambled to rival the scoop; when, weeks later, a headline screamed \"Another gay surfaces,\" it seemed like relief for desperate reporters. Homosexuality had almost never been publicly discussed in Zambia; now, for months, most newspapers carried several stories a week about it. Virtually all condemned it. The independent Post was willing at least occasionally to convey Chisambisha's and other sympathetic perspectives; the state-sponsored press was uniformly negative.\n\nA women's columnist headlined an account of the controversy, \"Homosexuality not new but can be stopped here,\" and pictured advocacy for sexual rights as deleterious to development:\n\nIn advanced societies, where people have attained so much that they have nothing much to do in life, they tend to turn to such unnatural practices as a pastime. In the first world, people have achieved so much in life. They have three meals a day, all the fruits and drinks of any imaginable luxury at their disposal. Since some of them may not have much work to do any more, they search for hobbies and some, unfortunately, end up in homosexuality. But in third world countries, particularly in Sub Saharan Africa, we have so much work to do, we cannot even afford to think of homosexuality…. The energies being channeled toward unproductive ventures like forming gay associations could be used for more meaningful projects like poverty alleviation … The relevant authorities should be prompted to act against people purporting to enhance their human rights by engaging in unacceptable practices.\n\nReporters conducted \"man-in-the-street\" interviews, gauging the indignation they helped to foster. One writer asked Lusakans about the proposal to let gays form an NGO:\n\nA cross-section of the public interviewed during a random survey seem to be in unison that such a move is unacceptable and should not be encouraged in any way as it would merely be perpetuating a vice. The outraged people noted that although homosexual and lesbian organizations might be in existence elsewhere, it was totally alien in Zambian society and everything should be done to ensure it did not take off.\n\nAnother cited the Zimbabwean situation, saying many Zambians\n\nvehemently oppose the wholesale importation of Western culture including negative and retrogressive values like homosexuality, which some say is an insult to the conscience of the human being for even the low animals, some people interviewed say, know better. President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe who not long ago put up a strong fight against gays in his country drew a similar analogue and said homosexuals are worse than animals.\n\n\"Homos, lesbians, go to hell!\" one piece was headlined:\n\nWhen the bad news fouled my ears to the effect that homosexuals, lesbians, I mean the gays, have started walking the streets with their heads upright, my soul was shaken to its very foundation….\n\nThese homosexuals, and these lesbians, wonders will never end! Are you telling me they have the courage to waste the taxpayer's stationery, I mean my stationery, by registering an association with the Registrar of Societies?\n\nRegistrar of Societies, I don't expect it to happen, but if a lesbian gathers enough courage and exhibits her ugly face in the confines of your beautiful office for the sinful, shameful purpose of registering what will sinfully and shamefully be known as the Lesbians Union of Zambia, give her the boot, particularly on her rump steak, you know what I mean by her rump steak, don't you? What I mean is, give her marching orders thus: By the left, quick match! Left, right, left, right, On the double!…\n\nHomosexuals, lesbians, gays, you homosexuals, go home, who needs you? Did I say go home? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant go to Hell. Look, homosexuals, lesbians, gays and the likes of you, no home is fit for you. . . .\n\nAll of you need to be sent to a special institution to undergo special and thorough examination. Something is certainly the matter with you.\n\nFew dared raise dissenting voices. Former president Kenneth Kaunda initially urged Zambians to \"cool down and think about\" the question of \"how to handle these brothers and sisters.\" A furious response from press and politicians ensued; one writer sneered, \"It took just one ill-timed, ill-conceived, ill-advised statement uttered in probably less than one minute to invalidate… Kaunda's claim to 74.5 years of wisdom.\" Kaunda soon retracted his sympathy, explaining that \"They are sick, in my opinion, and they should be helped to come back to normalcy.\"\n\nFrancis Chisambisha found one lone defender. On the day after his interview was published, the Post's front page announced that Alfred Zulu, head of the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT), wanted to support Chisambisha. \"Gay people,\" said Zulu, \"just like lesbians, are normal people and are entitled to fundamental human rights and should not be discriminated against.\"\n\nZulu's organization had previously worked principally on election monitoring and on the rights of traditional chiefs. He quickly, however, became the country's main spokesperson on the issue of sexual orientation. In part because of provocative assertions by Zulu about homosexuals' prevalence in Zambia, he was mocked as well as vilified. That a self-proclaimed heterosexual man should defend homosexuals particularly outraged many. At one raucous public meeting, a pastor pleaded with him to admit that he was gay, so that \"society will know how to deal with you.\"\n\nA forum on the issue organized by journalism students at a local college erupted into violence, with Zulu as the target. One press account said that Zulu and a fellow staffer \"narrowly escaped lynching\" when the audience grew outraged at their \"advocating homosexuality.\" Students switched off lights in the auditorium \"so that they could manhandle the two gay advocates\"; police intervened to protect them.\n\nWithin weeks, Zulu and Chisambisha had decided to form an NGO, the Lesbian, Gays, Bisexual and Transgender Persons Association (LEGATRA). Its creation was announced to the press by ZIMT, and again drew banner headlines. At first it planned to operate through the parent organization. Ultimately, though, LEGATRA hoped to apply for legal registration.\n\nThe idea of an association roused still more outrage. The ministers of legal affairs and of information were followed by the minister of home affairs and a spokesman for the national police in warning that anyone trying to register such an association would be arrested. The minister of legal affairs observed that \"the registration of such an association was in itself a crime.\" And government spokesman David Mpamba, calling homosexuality \"un-African and an abomination to society which would cause social decay,\" called on Alfred Zulu to step down \"for misleading the nation on a moral issue of homosexuality.\"\n\nThe minister of health warned against allowing LEGATRA to register, stating that \"allowing homosexual groups in Zambia would worsen the AIDS situation.\" In Parliament, then Vice-President Christon Tembo announced that people defending the rights of homosexuals faced jail. Since the penal code prohibited homosexual conduct, \"If anybody promotes gay rights after this statement the law will take its course. We need to protect public morality. Human rights do not operate in a vacuum.\" And he added, \"An association formed to further the interests of homosexuals can never be registered in Zambia.… [T]hose who will persist in championing the cause for homosexuality activities in Zambia risk being arrested.\" Several gay men who had given their names to LEGATRA went into hiding after these public threats.\n\nThen president Chiluba finally addressed the issue in October 1998, in a speech on the thirty-fourth anniversary of Zambia's independence. Showing palpable disgust, according to observers, he said, \"Homosexuality is the deepest level of depravity. It is unbiblical and abnormal. How do you expect my government to accept something that is abnormal?\" He accused Zulu of pandering to foreign funding, and promised that his administration would prevent homosexuality from gaining a foothold in Zambia.\n\nChiluba's party, the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), had been swept into power in a 1991 landslide election victory, propelled by revulsion at the structural adjustment plans imposed in the 1980s. It was an uneasy coalition of trade unions, intellectuals, and conservative rural populations. Chiluba quickly found himself introducing still more rigorous economic reforms. With prices spiraling, urban support for the MMD plummeted; the adminstration found itself more and more reliant on rural constituencies, and by extension on the Christian congregations particularly influential there. One of its first steps had been to promulgate a constitution declaring Zambia a \"Christian nation.\" Now, homosexuality became a convenient occasion for politicians to cement their alliance with churches, and prove their readiness to defend the religious identity of the state.\n\nTwo days after Francis Chisambisha came out in the press, Archbishop John Mambo, superintendent of the Church of God for the Central African Region, said that \"homosexuality cannot be an issue of human rights because it is against the teachings of the Bible.\" Later, at a national conference on human rights, Mambo opposed the registration of gay organizations. Reverend John Jere of Zambia United Christian Action declared, \"Our government should take a Biblical stand against such evils\" as homosexuality. Zambia is a center for the activities of North American-based fundamentalist Christian evangelists: their approaches and language were invoked in debates. One Zambian newspaper simply reprinted materials describing the work of a U.S. Christian organization which allegedly \"converted\" gays, Exodus International, to support the idea that \"Christian counselling\" could cure homosexuals and return them to the fold of society.\n\nOther civil society actors almost uniformly opposed ZIMT and LEGATRA. Many spoke out on the issue despite its irrelevance to their own mandates. Truckers Association of Zambia (TAZ) Chairman Charles Madondo said, \"I find it strange that anyone can talk of human rights on somebody doing something not only illegal but also unChristian. Perceiving such practices as human rights is the same as condoning adultery or even murder.\" The chair of the Zambia Peace Bureau, and the president of the Assocation of Zambian Private Investigators and Security Organizations, gave statements to the press condemning homosexuality. Traditional chiefs, with an eye on their own relationship to the state, weighed in:\n\nThe Tonga Traditional Association yesterday called on Government to deregister the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) and arrest all its leaders who have been campaigning for gay rights in Zambia.\n\nTonga Traditional Association president Dickson Namanza said in Lusaka yesterday that Government was encouraging lawlessness by not arresting the ZIMT leaders, whose gay rights campaign was illegal.…\n\nHe said chiefs needed to jointly support Government in its firm stand against the practice whose campaign was being funded by powerful Western donors.\n\nMr. Namanza called on Government to increase its funding to traditional rulers whom he said played very important roles in issues such as the one ignited by ZIMT and LEGATRA.\n\nMuleya Mwananyanda, information officer of the Zambian human rights group Afronet, told our researcher in 1998 that \"the human rights movement is divided on this issue. It is hard not to say that this [homosexuality] is a new kind of right for us. And then people say, 'why should we be fighting for a new right when we don't have our old rights yet?'\" In fact, ZIMT was the only human rights organization to speak out for homosexuals. Many other groups expressly working for democracy and human rights went out of their way to speak against homosexuals. George Kunda, head of the Law Association of Zambia, told reporters that\n\nunder existing laws no one was permitted to be involved in unnatural acts like sodomy or lesbianism. . . . On the people who had come out in the open claiming that they were gays he noted that they risked being prosecuted because it was a crime under the Penal Code.…\n\n\"Sodomy or those other things they are fighting for are acts against the order of nature which are not allowed by our existing law,\" Mr. Kunda said.\n\nThe executive director of the Foundation for Democratic Process (FoDEP), a group promoting civic education and fair elections, accused ZIMT of \"encouraging the discrimination against gays by encouraging them to come out in the open.\" The head of Rainbow Monitors, an election-monitoring NGO close to the government, said that \"it is a matter of urgency that the campaign for the rights of homosexuals and lesbians be nipped in the bud…. The law in Zambia is very clear on the status of homosexual and other sodomy activities and any persons engaging in or advocating for sodomy is [sic] guilty of breaking the law.\" Archibald Ngcobo, chair of the Southern African Human Rights Foundation, said that homosexuality remained taboo in Africa: \"We should not even gloss over that factor. Based on our cultural side it is against African tradition.\" And Mike Zulu, president of Focus for Democracy (FOD) told Francis Chisambisha in a public panel, \"You chaps are sick. You need help. You need what I call sex therapy…. I wouldn't want any of my children to be spoiled just because of you chaps.\"\n\nA dean at the University of Zambia saw homosexuality as defining the limits of human rights:\n\nRights have to be natural and anything not deriving its legitimacy from the natural phenomenon can't be said to be a right. Social irresponsibility has extended to unthinkable levels that perverts and sadists are busy lurking in the dark bringing ideas against moral standards in the country all in the name of democracy and human rights…. Every society has minimum standards of acceptable behavior and those for homosexuality championing those filthy practices should not be condoned at all.\n\nOur researcher in November 1998 met with three members of Zambia's Permanent Human Rights Commission, established by the government in 1997 as an independent monitoring body. The members emphasized that they could not intervene on homosexual issues. The chair, Judge Lombe Chibesakunda, told our researcher that \"this is not one of our priority areas of concern. We are concerned with pressing issues, including poverty and prisons.\" She stressed the importance of \"balancing rights,\" noting that \"the rights of children have to be balanced against the rights of gays.\" And she condemned the intolerance of Western societies \"which do not take the idiosyncrasies of a given society into account.\" Reverend Foston Sakala, another commission member, said, \"It is appropriate to consider levels of development of countries. For us, the timing is wrong.\"\n\nThe controversy eventually¾and perhaps most dangerously¾became one over how civil society was funded, and the motives of its funders. In September 1998, the Norwegian Embassy gave a substantial grant to ZIMT, and expressly targeted part of it for supporting the organization's work with LEGATRA. A new furor erupted when the donation was reported in the state-sponsored press. One letter to the editor demanded, \"Are donors gay?\" Diplomats of other embassies were questioned by reporters, resulting in the reassuring headline, \"Gay rights no condition for Japanese aid.\" An editorial stated, \"We have reason to suspect that many of those behind the alliance formed by gays and lesbians in Zambia are money-mongers who are more interested in donor funds which … the West has promised them.\"\n\nIn an extraordinary confrontation, Norway's ambassador was summoned by the minister of foreign affairs to explain the grant. Speaking under conditions of anonymity, an official at the Norwegian Embassy told our researcher,\n\nThe Ambassador was told quite strongly that it was unacceptable for a foreign embassy to intervene in illegal conduct in this country. It reached the level of a written reply from our foreign minister to the Zambian foreign minister. I cannot tell you its contents. But I can tell you that our position generally is, first, that priorities are set by NGOs themselves, and second, that we were giving support to ZIMT to sponsor discussion. And we assume that having discussions and so forth on an issue is not illegal. But I can tell you that this kind of thing becomes known in the diplomatic community. I believe it will make many embassies more careful than us about whom they support. And I believe it will make many NGOs very careful about what they discuss.\n\nAnders Pedersen, first secretary at the Embassy of Sweden, exemplified this caution. \"For me personally,\" he told our researcher, homosexuality \"is an issue you must defend.\" But he added,\n\nFor us it has been very much a question of-operating here in Zambia, you must make a distinction between our values in our society, and what kind of discussion can we have in Zambia…. The Norwegian Embassy's situation, we defend, we sympathize. But should Sweden stand with them publicly? No; we have decided it is not the right way.\n\nWestern donors and embassies in Zambia, as in much of Africa, had shifted their priorities since the 1980s away from funding government projects toward promoting non-governmental organizations. \"Donor-driven democratization,\" as one Zambian political scientiest called it, promoted an independent, often critical civil society: but governments which lost direct aid might well doubly resent the perception that the funds were channeled to enable their opponents. With President Chiluba himself accusing NGOs of selling out Zambians to an agenda set by foreign funders, the controversy over homosexuality threatened to become one over the legitimacy¾and \"authenticity\"¾of civil society itself.\n\nThe IGLHRC representative visiting Zambia in November 1998 found a minuscule gay community in terror and disarray. Francis Chisambisha had not seen or spoken to his family since he came out in the Post in July. He had earlier been studying at an agricultural college run by the United Church of Zambia. After the article appeared, however, he was barred from taking his exams, and told verbally that he was suspended from the school. Now he stayed with friends, moving from house to house regularly in fear of the police. Others associated with LEGATRA were homeless, expelled by their families who discovered or suspected they were gay.\n\nLEGATRA was still an illegal organization. The Registrar of Societies had not arrested ZIMT staffers who came to present LEGATRA's application for registration; he had repeatedly turned them away, though, claiming he had run out of forms. The IGLHRC representative visited the registrar, Herbert Nyendwa, together with ZIMT and LEGATRA members. Nyendwa confirmed that he could not register the group, \"any more than I could a Satanic organization.\"\n\nLEGATRA ceased to exist within a few months. By 1999, most of its members had fled the country. ZIMT also collapsed as an organization in 2000.\n\nD. Botswana\n\nOne explanation for the spread of homophobic rhetoric on the African continent was offered in 1998 by South Africa's Zackie Achmat. Achmat, a former anti-apartheid activist and revered figure in his country's progressive politics, founded his country's National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality; he has since become a renowned campaigner for access to HIV treatment. Many African politicians, Achmat told our researcher,\n\nwant to blame the West for everything, homosexuality included. And they are right, the West is responsible for their rhetoric, but in a different way than they say. The West, the IMF, the World Bank, push structural adjustment plans on these countries. And they are starved and devastated by it. Food is unaffordable, health care unavailable; educations, opportunities, pensions are all gone. And the populations are enraged, rightly. And the governments used to depend on one class to support them when the chips were down: civil servants. Intellectuals used to know that you emerged from the universities and you had a lifetime government job. No more: the government jobs are gone, courtesy of the IMF's orders. The civil servants are all redundant. And so these governments are precarious and terrified. The people are roused up against them, and there is no one to support them. Their only real hope is that people die of AIDS or hunger before they are angry enough to rebel.\n\nAnd what do they find? They say \"homosexual\" and two sorts come running to them: the Christian churches and the African traditionalists, two groups who usually won't even speak to one another, come flocking behind the government's banner. Suddenly they have support. It's a magic word. They think it is a perfect solution. For now.\n\nIn diverse corners of Africa, other countries have heard rhetoric similar to Mugabe's.\n\nIn Botswana, discussion of homosexuality intensified in 1998, when the process of revising the penal code raised prospects that the sodomy law might be repealed. Political forces mobilized to forestall the possibility. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) faced an election in the next year, and the opposition tentatively favored sodomy law repeal. Molosiwa Selepeng, political affairs secretary in the president's office, told a reporter that \"Homosexual practice remains a crime in Botswana and this reflects the overwhelming majority attitudes in this country.\" He said those attitudes found homosexuality \"unnatural and abhorrent.\" The executive secretary of the ruling BDP said his party \"could not even debate the issue of homosexuality\" because it \"would shock the Batswana nation.\"\n\nThe vice-president of Botswana, Seretse Ian Khama, also spoke out against homosexuals. Asked in Parliament to clarify the government's position, he said:\n\nHuman rights are not a licence to commit unnatural acts which offend the social norms of behaviour … The law is abundantly clear that homosexuality, performed either by males or females, in public or private is an offence punishable by law.\n\nSeveral traditional leaders vocally opposed relaxing the penal code, according to a reporter:\n\nBakgatla Kgosi Linchwe"
