Never underestimate a cell\n\nWe should not underestimate cells. Conor and Dodi talk with Dr Brett Kagan who conducted research to understand the brain and test ‘sentient’ brain cells, using the 1970s game, known as ‘Pong’. In another conversation, Professor Petra Levin and Kunaal Joshi explain how they have demonstrated that there is no ‘average’ life of a cell.\n\nAt the end of this episode, we hope to have proven that cells are not to be overlooked and still have so much to tell us about human health.\n\nView transcript\n\n68. CRISPR and molecular aging\n\nWhat do CRISPR and longevity have in common? Not much, except it's all molecular.\n\nWe speak to two different CEOs focused on improving human health. We begin with Dr Benjamin Oakes, Co-Founder, President, and CEO of Scribe Therapeutics who takes us through the discovery, potential, and possible limitations of CRISPR.\n\nThen we are joined by fellow visionary, Dr Kristen Fortney, the CEO, and co-founder of BioAge, a clinical stage biotechnology company developing therapies that treat disease by targeting the biology of ageing.\n\nView transcript\n\n67. Revived therapies (part 1) – Psychedelics\n\nPsychedelic treatment is a therapy which is on the rise according to the increasing number of studies on the use of psylocibin, ketamine and MDMA to treat mental health disorders such as PTSD. In this episode, Conor talks to Prof. Eric Vermetten, a psychiatrist who has been working with the military in the Netherlands for the last 25 years helping Dutch armed forces and the uniformed people in the face of PTSD and psychotraumatology.\n\nView transcript\n\n64. Pain in the body and the brain\n\nIn this episode, we are focusing intently on the microbiome and how it is increasingly being linked to disease and illness. It seems that this is true for understanding illness of the body and the brain. Dr Amir Minerbi, the Deputy Director of the Institute for Pain Medicine at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, Israel talks to us about how the microbiome may hold the secrets of fibromyalgia. This chronic disorder causes widespread pain, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and potentially dozens of other symptoms.\n\nWe are also joined by Prof Illana Gozes, Director of Elton Laboratory for Molecular Neuroendocrinology in the Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine in Tel Aviv University. She elaborates on her research surrounding the role of specific microbiota signatures as a biomarker for PTSD.\n\nThe link between physical and mental health and the microbiome is a fascinating connection, and one we intend to explore to the fullest.\n\nView transcript\n\n63. Organ on a chip: Part 2\n\nIn this second episode of a two-part series on organ on a chip technology, we sit down with Christos Michas, R&D scientist and engineer at Curi Bio, and Alice White, professor of mechanical engineering at Boston University. Christos and Alice are taking the organ on a chip to another level with the miniPUMP, a heart on a chip which is the first step in understanding the interaction of therapeutic drugs on the heart. As cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death in the industrialized world, there is a lot of interest in understanding how these diseases emerge and how we can develop therapeutics.\n\nView transcript\n\n62. Organ on a chip: Part 1\n\nIn this first episode of a two-part series on organ on a chip technology, we discuss with Jan Turner, formerly part of Safer Medicines Trust, how these organoids can help us move away from the inefficient animal model.\n\nView transcript\n\n61. Genetic and genomic databases\n\nWe have a lot of information at our fingertips, so how do we make sense of it all to transform human health? Conor and Dodi speak to two experts who are making sense of this information overload by creating genetic and genomic databases. Dr Artem Babaian, a computational biologist and now Assistant Professor leading The Laboratory for RNA-Based Lifeforms at the University of Toronto, explains how he and his team uncovered 100 000 novel viruses in old genetic data that could help us predict future pandemics. Professor Jinchuan Xing, Associate Professor at Rutgers University in the Department of Genetics doing research on genomic variation, walks us through his study on using genomic data to predict infertility from aneuploid egg production.\n\nView transcript\n\n60.
