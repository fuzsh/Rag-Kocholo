        "text": "This chapter surveys queenship in the Iberian Peninsula in the Middle Ages. Even though legal codes and didactic texts written by men mapped out gender norms and stereotypes regarding women, and tended to limit the role of queens as rulers, many queens took active roles in politics, whether they were queens in their own right, royal consorts, regents and lieutenants, queen-mothers or dowagers. In the Middle Ages, rulership and kingship were not synonymous, and monarchical power was a broad enterprise in which other members of the royal family participated, particularly the queen—especially given the fact that the government and the court were very much integrated, and that there was little distinction between the public and the private spheres in royal circles. This chapter analyzes how power was conceived and used by queens, and also surveys the pillars of medieval queenship: the role of the family, the networks of power and patronage (religious, political, artistic, etc.) created by queens to wield authority and influence, and how piety and ceremonial functioned and were entwined. Particular historical contexts, the evolution of the legal tradition and canon law, and the constitution of broader and more complex realms all affected the model of queenship and made it evolve. In sum, this contribution emphasizes the queen’s role in medieval monarchy."
