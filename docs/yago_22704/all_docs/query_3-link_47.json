        "text": "The discipline description does not refer to the attorneyâ€™s prior disciplinary history and/or the aggravating or mitigating circumstances found pursuant to the Alabama Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline. Caution is advised when attempting to compare the discipline imposed against an attorney for a particular violation to the discipline imposed against another attorney for a seemingly similar violation.\n\nPrior to January 1, 2018, the Alabama Rules of Disciplinary Procedure did not allow for publication of discipline on the Alabama State Bar website. Any discipline imposed prior to January 1, 2018, has been edited as possible, to remove any identifying information pertaining to the disciplined attorney. Public discipline issued on or after January 1, 2018, will identify the disciplined attorney. Public discipline includes public probation, public reprimand with general publication, suspension and disbarment. Non-public discipline issued on or after January 1, 2018, will not identify the disciplined attorney."
