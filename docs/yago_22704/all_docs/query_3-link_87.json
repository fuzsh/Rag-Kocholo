The issue is whether State B's anti-lapse statute applies to Martha's children.\n\nIn general, if a beneficiary dies before a testator dies, the gift from the testator to the beneficiary will consider to have lapsed. Further, anti-lapse statutes generally only apply to lineal descendents, like children. However, when a state has an anti-lapse statute the statute will apply. Here, State B's statute is broad stating \"if a beneficiary predeceases the testator, the deceased beneficiary's surviving issue take the share of the deceased beneficiary would have taken unless the will expressly provides otherwise.\" This statute does not limit anti-lapse to only blood relatives, so Martha and her children are protected by it.\n\nMartha's children will receive the deceased beneficiary's share that she would have taken because the will does not provide otherwise. Therefore, John will receive half of the Testator's estate and Martha's children will receive the other half of the estate.\n\nIV. The issue is whether Robert has a claim for anything.\n\nGenerally, under an intestacy statute, Robert would split the estate with his brother, John. If the court did not admit the holograph will, then Robert would share the estate with his brother 50-50. However, since the holographic will is likely admitted to probate Robert will not take anything. Robert may be able to make a claim that Testator did not have the capacity at the time of the will since Testator could not specifically name Marth, a person that he had known for many years, but this claim will likely fail.\n\nMEE Question 2\n\nOn February 1, a woman began serving a 60-day sentence in the county jail for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. On February 4, a detective from the county sheriff’s department took the woman from her cell to an interrogation room in the jail building. He informed her that she was a suspect in a homicide investigation and that he wanted to ask her some questions. The detective then read the woman the state’s standard Miranda warnings:\n\nYou have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in court. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. If you decide that you wish to speak with us, you may change your mind and stop the questioning at any time. You may also ask for a lawyer at any time.\n\nThe detective asked the woman if she understood these rights. When she replied, “Yes, and I want a lawyer,” questioning ceased immediately, and she was returned to her cell\n\nOn March 15, the detective removed the woman from her cell and took her back to the same interrogation room. The detective told her that he wanted to ask her questions about the homicide because he had new information about her involvement. The detective read her the same Miranda warnings he had read on February 4 and asked her whether she understood her rights. She said, “Yes.”\n\nThe woman then asked the detective, “If I ask you to get me a lawyer, how long until one gets here?” The detective replied as follows:\n\nWe have no way of getting you a lawyer immediately, but one will be appointed for you, if you wish, if and when you go to court. We don’t know when that will happen. If you wish to answer questions now without a lawyer present, you have the right to stop answering questions at any time. You also have the right to stop answering questions until a lawyer is present.\n\nThe detective’s statement accurately characterized the procedure for appointment of counsel. The woman then said, “I might need a lawyer.” The detective responded, “That’s your call, ma’am.\n\nAfter a few minutes of silence, the woman took a Miranda waiver form from the detective and checked the boxes indicating that the rights had been read to her, that she understood them, and that she wished to waive her rights and answer questions. She then signed the form. After the detective began to question her, she confessed to the homicide.\n\nThe woman was charged with murder in state court. Her lawyer filed a motion to suppress the woman’s March 15 statements to the detective, alleging three violations of her Miranda rights by the detective:\n\n(1) Interrogating the woman on March 15 after she had invoked her Miranda right to counsel on February 4.\n\n(2) Incorrectly conveying to the woman her Miranda right to counsel by the statements he made on March 15.\n\n(3) Interrogating the woman on March 15 after she had invoked her Miranda right to counsel on March 15.\n\nThis state affords a criminal defendant no greater rights than those mandated by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAfter an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion to suppress on all three grounds raised by defense counsel.\n\nDid the court err? Explain.\n\nSample Answer\n\nI. Interrogation of the Woman on 3/15 after her invocation on 2/4.\n\nThe issue here is whether the police can obtain a valid Miranda waiver after the right to counsel was previously invoked.\n\nMiranda Doctrine applies to confessions made during custodial interrogation. A suspect is in custody when they would not feel reasonably free to terminate the encounter (or are unable to), and a suspect is being interrogated when subject to express questioning or its functional equivalent. If a suspect is being interrogated in custody such that Miranda Doctrine applies, the Supreme Court requires certain warnings to be given which inform a suspect of their rights. Any waiver of Miranda must be knowing and voluntary. Further, the right to silent or the right to counsel must be affirmatively invoked by the suspect, at which point questioning must stop immediately. The right to remain silent needs to be scrupulously honored, while the right to counsel depends on more factors, such as the location, the officers, the offenses, and also how much time has passed since the invocation. Two weeks is commonly used as a period wherein the police can re-engage with the suspect.\n\nHere, the police subjected the suspect to custodial interrogation. She was in prison and brought specifically into another room. No evidence is given about her state of mind, but being incarcerated is a good indicator of her being in custody. Further, the detective was clearly intent on interrogating her about the homicide, so, the detective proceeded to give her, in full and validly, her Miranda warnings by telling her she had the right to counsel, the right to having counsel appointed, and the right to ask for one at any time. The woman's subsequent invocation of counsel was effective, by stating \"I want a lawyer,\" and as prescribed, questioning ceased immediately. Then, over five weeks after the initial encounter, the detectives re-engaged with the suspect, again validly read her the Miranda rights and she read the form, checked each box, said she understood them, and then proceeded to waiver her rights and answer questions.\n\nIn conclusion, the amount of time that passed means that the detective re-engaging the suspect after her invocation of the right to counsel was not contrary to the constitution. The Court did not err in denying the motion.\n\nII. The Conveyance of Her Miranda Right to Counsel\n\nThe issue here is whether the detective's conveyance or classification of her right to counsel by the statements he made violated the suspect's rights.\n\nAs stated above, Miranda doctrine requires an affirmative invocation of the suspect of their right to counsel. Further, it's stated that the detective's follow-up statements accurately characterized the procedure for appointment of counsel.\n\nHere, the suspect did not affirmatively invoke her right to counsel a second time, but rather asked a follow-up procedural question to the detective. He then gave her the information she asked for, and by saying \"I might need a lawyer,\" the detective did not have a duty to stop questioning. He accurately read her her rights and then proceeded to make sure she understood them by answering her questions and providing her with a form to review. Further, the warnings given clearly show that she had a right to an attorney, a right to have an attorney appointed, and that she could ask for one at any time. Stating \"that's your call ma'am\" to an ineffective invocation doesn't lend itself to the conclusion that the detective did not properly convey her right to counsel to her.\n\nThe Offier did not wrongfully convey her right to an attorney, but rather effectively gave her Miranda warnings and then answered her questions. He had no duty to refrain from questioning after her answer. The Court did not err.\n\nIII. Invocation of the Right to Counsel on 3/15.\n\nThe issue here is whether the suspect invoked her right to counsel by her statements made on 3/15.\n\nAs stated above, Miranda doctrine requires an affirmative invocation of the suspect of their right to counsel. If not specifically asserted, the police can seek a valid Miranda waiver by making sure that the suspect was aware of their rights and that the waiver was knowing and voluntary.\n\nHere, the detective gave the Miranda warnings, which were necessary because the suspect was again subject to custodial (in prison) interrogation (getting asked express questions). Rather than affirmatively invoke her right to counsel as she did previously, she merely responded \"I might need a lawyer\" and asked a question about how long until the lawyer could get the interrogation site. This isn't a proper invocation, and so the detective attempted to engage the suspect to get a waiver, where the rights were read, the suspect was orally asked whether she understood her rights, and then was provided a form with individual check boxes for acknowledging that she understood her rights and wished to waive them. The statements made after that waiver are not subject to exclusion because they were voluntary.\n\nIn conclusion, the court did not err and the suspect's rights were not violated because she did not invoke her right to counsel again.\n\nSample Answer\n\nInterrogating the woman on March 15 After Invoking Right to Counsel on February 4.\n\nThe trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress on the first count for invocation of right to counsel. The issue is how long are police required to refrain from questioning a suspect after they validly invoke their right to counsel. The Fifth Amendment protects individuals from self-incrimination and the right to be free from making incriminating statements. In Miranda, the Supreme Court extended this right to custodial interrogation environments. Miranda applies when a suspect is in a custodial interrogation situation. Custody is determined by an objective standard and asks whether or not a suspect would objectively feel reasonably free to leave under the circumstances. Custody will be found in highly coercive situations like the one here in an interrogation room. Second, the police must be \"interrogating\" the person. Interrogation is also an objective test under Innis that asks whether a reasonable person would feel compelled to answer or the comments would reasonably elicit a response from the defendant. Here, Miranda was required during the entire sequence of interrogation because the police were questioning the defendant in custody (an interrogation room) and asking about an ongoing homicide investigation. (Note the 6th Amendment does not apply here because defenant was only charged with DUI and the 6th Amendment is offense specific post-charging). A reasonable person would not feel free to leave the interrogation room and would be reasonably understood by the detective to elicit a response from the woman.\n\nIf Miranda is applicable, a defendant that invokes the right to counsel must be left alone for 14 days under the Edwards Doctrine. Moreover, the invocation of the right to counsel must be clear and unambiguous. Here, the suspect validly and unambiguously invoked her right to counsel by saying \"I want my lawyer.\" This triggers the 14 day Edwards period. Here, the police abided by Edwards and waited long after 14 days to continue interrogating the suspect. Defendant invoked her right to counsel on February 4th and was not questioned again until March 15 well after the 14 day period. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding the interrogation valid on March 15.\n\nIncorrectly Conveying to the Woman Her Miranda right to counsel by the statements he made on March 15.\n\nThe police correctly conveyed the woman's right to counsel by statements he made on March 15. The issue is whether a police officer may inform a suspect of Miranda and how specific the rights must be read. The Supreme Court has liberally applied Miranda and held that a reasonable conveyance standard is appropriate. Under this standard, the police need not be exact in the conveyance or recital, but must convey the key facts that a suspect may stay silent and may request a lawyer etc. Here, on February 4, the police stated the Miranda warnings verbatim \"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you etc...\" On March 15, the detective removed the woman from her cell and took her back to the interrogation room. The detective read her the same Miranda warnings he read above on February 4 and asked her whether she understood.\" She replied yes. Based on the liberal reasonable conveyance standard, the detective repeating the detailed warnings listed above will be more than sufficient to be constitutional. Thus, the detective did not err and the trial court did not err in finding that there was not constitutional defect with the conveyance and statements on March 15.\n\nInterrogating the Woman on March 15 after she Invokes Miranda Right to Counsel on March 15.\n\nThe trial court did not err in finding that the woman was properly interrogated on March 15. The issue is whether the woman constitutionally and clearly invoked her right to counsel on March 15. As discussed above, Miranda right to counsel must be unambiguously invoked by the defendant as she did on Feb 4. A defendant may waive her right to counsel through a (1) knowing, (2) intentional, and (3) voluntary waiver. First, on March 15, she never legally invoked her right to counsel. Unlike on February 4, staying \"I might need a lawyer\" is not sufficiently clear to invoke the right and the woman waived her rights. After a few minutes of silence, the woman signed the Miranda waiver form and checked the boxes that she had been read her rights, she understood them, and she wished to waive them. She then signed the form. She confessed later to homicide. Woman did not invoke her right to counsel and even if she did, she waived the right. Woman knowingly signed the form and checked the boxes, and waived her rights to not answer. In conclusion, woman never constitutionally and clearly invoked her right to counsel on March 15, and even if she did, she waived the right and the trial court correctly denied all motions to suppress.\n\nMEE Question 3\n\nParent Inc., a company in the renewable energy business, has several subsidiaries. In all cases, Parent maintains control of its subsidiaries by selecting the members of each subsidiary’s board of directors, most of whom also serve as officers and employees of Parent.\n\nOne of the subsidiaries, HomeSolar Inc. (incorporated in a jurisdiction that has adopted a version of the Model Business Corporation Act), was acquired three years ago by Parent. Parent owns 80% of HomeSolar’s voting shares, with the remaining shares publicly traded on a national stock exchange. HomeSolar manufactures and sells products exclusively for the residential solar power market.\n\nAnother subsidiary, IndustrialSolar Inc., is wholly owned by Parent and manufactures products exclusively for the industrial solar power market.\n\nA shareholder of HomeSolar, after making a proper demand on the board to which the board failed to timely respond, brought a derivative suit against Parent, as the controlling shareholder of HomeSolar, making the following allegations:\n\n(1) HomeSolar has not paid dividends since being acquired by Parent three years ago. In SEC filings, HomeSolar has explained that its no-dividend policy provides funds for its research and development budget as it seeks to develop new products for the residential solar power market in which it operates. Nonetheless, HomeSolar has more than adequate earnings and was obligated to pay dividends to its shareholders.\n\n(2) Since acquiring HomeSolar, Parent has caused HomeSolar to purchase the “rare earth” minerals necessary for the manufacture of its residential solar panels from SolarMaterials Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. SolarMaterials was created for the purpose of acquiring such minerals and reselling them to the various renewable energy subsidiaries of the Parent group. The long-term contract under which HomeSolar purchases rare earth minerals from SolarMaterials, however, sets prices significantly higher than the current market prices under similar long-term contracts for such minerals.\n\n(3) After Parent learned about a large government grant to develop industrial-scale solar projects, Parent caused IndustrialSolar to apply for and secure this grant, denying HomeSolar the opportunity to obtain this grant.\n\nDid Parent breach any duties to HomeSolar with respect to HomeSolar’s no-dividend policy? Explain.\n\n2. Did Parent breach any duties to HomeSolar with respect to HomeSolar’s contract with SolarMaterials for the purchase of rare earth minerals? Explain.\n\n3. Did Parent breach any duties to HomeSolar by denying HomeSolar the opportunity to apply for the government grant? Explain.\n\nSample Answer\n\nNo Dividend Policy\n\nParent did not breach any duties to HomeSolar with respect to HomeSolar's no dividend policy. At issue is the authority of the board of directors to authorize, or rather deny, paying out dividends. As an initial matter, Parent does owe fiduciary duties to HomeSolar. This is because Parent owns 80% of HomeSolar's voting shares and Parent maintains control of its subsidiaries (of which HomeSolar is one) by selecintg the members of each subsidiary's board of directors, most of whom also serve as officers and employees of Parent. Because Parent is a controlling shareholder of HomeSolar and because Parent controls what appears to be the entirety of HomeSolar's board by placing its own officers and employees of the board, Parent owes fiduciary duties to its subsidiaries. The first question is whether Parent breached any duties to HomeSolar by not paying out dividends. Parent did not breach any duties in this regard. First, the derivative suit is not a proper derivative action. A suit to force a company to pay out dividends is a direct suit that an individual shareholder must bring. A failure to pay out dividends is not a proper derivative suit. That aside, Parent still did not violate any duties to HomeSolar with its no divided policy. Unless stated otherwise in the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws, the board of directors are under no duty to pay out dividends. Paying out dividends is in their sole discretion. Only if a shareholder can show abuse of that discretion can a court find that a failure to pay out dividends is a breach of a duty. Here, Parent was exercising its proper discretion by having the board of HomeSolar not declare dividends, and it was not an abuse of discretion. There is no evidence that HomeSolar's articles or bylaws mandate that the board must pay out dividends. As such, there is no breach there. Furthemore, the decision not to pay out dividends appears to be a properly exercised use of discretion. By not paying out dividends, HomeSolar can provide funds for research and development budget in seeking to develop new products for the residential solar power market in which it operates. This is a perfectly valid exercise of discretion. Just because HomeSolar has more than adequate earnings and the shareholder believes that HomeSolar is obligated to pay dividends does not mean Parent must have HomeSolar pay out dividends. Parent, as majority shareholder and de facto controller of the board of directors of HomeSolar, may exercise its discretion in paying out dividends. Unless the articles or the bylaws provide otherwise, or past history indicated a dividend payment regularly with a sudden, unjusitifed stop, a shareholder cannot force a board to approve a payout of dividends. Parent did not breach any duties to HomeSolar with respect to HomeSolar's no-divident policy.\n\nContract with SolarMaterials\n\nParent did breach its duties to HomeSolar with respect to HomeSolar's contract with SolarMaterials for the purchase of rare earth minerals. At issue is whether this contract was improper self dealing that violates the fiduciary duty of loyalty. The board of directors of a corporation, as well as its officers, owe a duty to the corporation to act in good faith and in a way that an ordinary person would reasonably believe is in the corporation's best interests. The board and officers further owe a duty to act as an ordinarily prudent person in like circumstances would reasonably act. The former sentence is the duty of loyalty. One way a board of directors can violate the duty of loyalty is by engaging in a self-interested transaction. Where the board of directors of one company serve another company and engage in dealings between the first company and the second, the board of directors are engaged in self-dealing unless some exceptions are met. Here, the board of directors of HomeSolar is made up of Parent's officers and employees. Furthermore, SolarMaterials Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As such, when HomeSolar's board of directors engages in deals with SolarMaterials, the board is self-dealing because, as a wholly owned subsidiary, what's good for SolarMaterials is good for Parent, which is good for the officers and employees. As such, Parent and its officers and employees serving on the board of HomeSolar were engaged in self dealing, which violates the duty of loyalty. A board of directors will not have been deemed to breach the fiduciary duties of loyalty for self dealing if: (1) the deal was fair to the company; (2) after a disclosure of all the material facts, a majority of disinterested board members approve; or (3) after a disclosure of all the material facts, a majority of disinterested shares entitled to vote approve the measure. Here, no such procedures took place. First, the deal was not fair to HomeSolar because the long-term contract with SolarMaterials is set at prices significantly higher than the current market prices under similar long-term contracts for such minerals. Second, it appears there was no vote of disinterested board members with a full disclosure of all material facts, primarily because it seems that there are no disinterested board members on HomeSolar's board. Lastly, there appears to have been no vote of the disinterested shareholders, because Parent was interested since SolarMaterials is its wholly owned subsidiary. Because the board of HomeSolar, officers and employees of Parent who owned SolarMaterials as its wholly owned subsidiary, were engaged in self-dealing with the transaction between HomeSolar and SolarMaterials without any saving exception, Parent has breached its fiduciary duties of loyalty to HomeSolar for self dealing.\n\nGovernment Grant\n\nParent did not breach any duties to HomeSolar by denying HomeSolar the opportunity to apply for the government grant. At issue is whether Parent usurped a corporate opportunity from HomeSolar. Usurping a corporate oppportunity is a breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty. A board member, or board, or controlling shareholder usurps a corporate opportunity when it takes a business opportunity that the company reasonably had an expectation in. The person or entity in question must alert the company of the opportunity and allow the company to decide whether or not to take it. Insufficient funds to take the opportunity is no defense. Additionally, an opportunity will be deemed to be an opportunity that the company had a reasonale expectation in when that opportunity was in the same business line as the company. Here, because it can be fairly stated that the government grants were not an opportunity HomeSolar had a reasonable expectation or interest in, Parent did not breach the duty of loyalty by usurping this opportunity. The government grants were to develop industrial-scale solar projects. IndustrialSolar is wholly owned by parent and manufactures products exclusively for the industrial solar power market. HomeSolar, on the other hand, manufactures and sells its products exclusively for the residential solar power market. Since a grant to develop industrial scale solar projects was exclusively the domain of IndustrialSolar and not residential in any way, it cannot be said that HomeSolar had an expectation in that opportunity. HomeSolar is exclusively a residential solar company. The government grants were for industrial projects. These are two separate business lines. HomeSolar had no expectation in this opportunity, therefore Parent did not breach the duty of loyalty by usurping the opportunity through IndustrialSolar.\n\nSample Answer\n\nI. The No-Dividend Policy\n\nThe issue here is whether Parent company breached any duties owed to HomeSolar with respect to the no-dividend policy in effect after the acquisition.\n\nA derivative suit is instituted on behalf of a corporation by shareholder against its directors (in this case officers and employees of the Parent company) for a breach of fiduciary duties owed to them by the directors. A precusor to a derivative suit, absent it being futile, is a pre-suit demand on the board, otherwise litigation can ensue. Among these fiduciary duties are the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care provides that the directors cannot be grossly negligent in their carrying out of the business practices of the corporation, but business decisions made by directors are subject to the Business Judgment Rule, a rebuttable presumption which presumes that the directors act in good faith in carrying out the duties of the corporation. Normally, the discretion to delare dividends lies entirely with the directors, unless they refuse to do so in bad faith.\n\nHere, although HomeSolar has more that adequate earnings to potentially declare a dividend, there is no evidence of bad faith such that the directors couldn't exercise their discretion in determining whether to declare a dividend. The reason given, that it provides funds for research and development appears to be in good faith and entitled to the presumptions under the Business Judgment Rule.\n\nIn conclusion, Parent did not breach its duties in failing to declare dividends, unless the shareholder can show bad faith. (This is also more commonly shown in a direct suit, rather than derivative).\n\nII. The Contract with SolarMaterials\n\nThe issue here is whether Parent company breached any duties owed to HomeSolar with respect to the mandated purchasing contract between HomeSolar and SolarMaterials, another subsidiary.\n\nThe Duty of Loyalty prevents the directors of a corporation from making transactions that are a conflict of interest with the director's duty of loyalty to the company. Common examples of conflict of interest transactions are self-dealing, usurping corporate business opportunities, and directly competing with the corporation. In a case where there are interested directors on both sides of a transaction (self-dealing for ex.), the duty of loyalty is implicated unless there has been a full disclosure of all the material facts to the transaction and a majority vote to affirm the transaction by a majority of the uninterested directors. The duty of care may also be implicated in a situation where the directors act grossly negligent in the carrying on of business affairs, as discussed above.\n\nHere, the duty of loyalty is implicated in a few respects. First, Parent company places interested directors on the boards of both SolarMaterials and HomeSolar, and is the parent company of both. This is a self-dealing transaction wherein they are voting to contract from HomeSolar with another subsidiary at a price higher than the current market prices, and there is no evidence that this is being voted on by the uninterested directors. Further, this isn't the type of circumstance where there was a short-form merger and requires relaxed standards of disclosure and notice, because Parent only owns 80% of the shares instead of the requisite 90%. Thus, the interested directors from Parent company are on both sides of the transaction, it implicates the duty of loyalty because this is a form of self-dealing, and further, the duty of care is implicated because the contract price being paid is higher than the current market rates.\n\nIn sum, the contract with SolarMaterials breaches the Duty of Loyalty to HomeSolar and potentially also the duty of care.\n\nIII. Denying the Opportunity to Apply for the Government Grant\n\nThe issue here is whether Parent breached any duties owed to HomeSolar with respect to the business opportunity of applying for the federal grant.\n\nThe duty of loyalty also prevents interested directors from competing with the corporation through outside business ventures, as mentioned above. It also prevents directors from usurping corporate business opportunities. Some factors to consider on whether or not the business opportunity was usurped is whether the uninterested directors knew about it, whether it was the type of transactions that the corporation regularly engaged in, and whether or not they elected not to pursue the opportunity.\n\nHere, the subsidary of Parent company, IndustrialSolar elected to apply for a secure a grant, denying the opportunity of HomeSolar to obtain it. This means that IndustrialSolar was directly competing with HomeSolar because shareholders from HomeSolar may have wanted to pursue applying for that grant but were denied the opportunity. Further, this could be considered a usurping of a business opportunity, violating the duty of loyalty because the uninterested directors were not given a chance to try and pursue the grant despite it being potentially beneficial to them.\n\nIn sum, this conduct in favoring IndustrialSolar likely violated the duty of loyalty as well.\n\nMEE Question 4\n\nOn March 1, a contractor and an owner of movie theaters signed an agreement providing that, no later than August 15, the contractor would install seats in the owner’s new movie theater. The agreed-upon price was $100,000, which was less than the $150,000 that other similar contractors would charge for the same work. The agreement required that the owner pay the contractor half the price at the time the work commenced and the other half at completion. The contractor was willing to do the work for less money than its competitors because the contractor was new to the area and hoped to build up a positive reputation.\n\nThe agreement further provided that the contractor would start work no later than July 1. On\n\nJuly 1, before beginning the agreed-upon work, the contractor informed the owner that it would not perform its obligations under the agreement because it had obtained a more lucrative installation contract elsewhere. At that point, no payments had been made to the contractor.\n\nThe installation of the seats was the last step necessary for the theater to open to the public. The owner, which had anticipated that the contractor would install the seats by the August 15 deadline, had planned and widely promoted a film festival for September 1–10 to celebrate the opening of the new movie theater.\n\nImmediately after learning that the contractor would not install the seats, the owner began to look for a substitute contractor. Despite diligent efforts, the owner could not find a contractor that would agree to install the seats by August 15. Eventually, after an extensive search, the owner found a substitute contractor that agreed to install the seats for $150,000 by September 15. No other contractor could be found who would agree to install the seats at a lower price or before September 15.\n\nInstallation of the seats was completed on September 15, the substitute contractor was paid $150,000, and the theater opened a few days later. Because the theater had no seats at the time of the film festival scheduled for September 1–10, the owner canceled the festival.\n\nThe owner sued the original contractor for breach of contract, and the parties agreed to a non-jury trial. The judge has concluded that the contractor’s actions with respect to the seat-installation agreement constituted a breach of contract by the contractor. In addition, the judge has made the following findings of fact:\n\nThe contractor was unaware that the owner was planning to hold a film festival when it entered into the contract.\n\nThe owner would have made a profit of $35,000 if the seats had been installed in the new movie theater and the film festival had been presented there as scheduled on September 1–10.\n\nThe owner could have relocated the film festival to a nearby college auditorium that was available September 1–10 and, if this had occurred, the owner would have made a profit of $25,000.\n\nDo the damages recoverable by the owner include $50,000 for the amount paid to the substitute contractor above the $100,000 price to be paid to the original contractor under the contract? Explain.\n\nMay the owner recover for lost profits resulting from the cancellation of the film festival? Explain.\n\nAssuming that the owner is entitled to recover for lost profits resulting from the cancellation of the film festival, how much should the owner recover? Explain.\n\nSample Answer\n\n1) Common law governs breach of contract suits where the subject matter of the contract is not for the sale of goods. Here, the parties contracted for installation of seats, which is a service.\n\nThe issue here is whether the additional $50,000 is recoverable where the original contract was entered into at a price lower than fair market value. In a breach of contract case, the typical remedy under common law will be expectation damages. Expectation damages are intended to put the party in the same place as they would have been if the contract had been completed. These damages also seek to ensure that each party recovers the \"benefit of their bargain.\" Here, the original contract price was $100,000, which was $50,000 lower than what similar contractors in the area would pay. However, this reduction in price was not due to a mistake by one party, but rather due to the contractor's willingness to do the work at a lower price because he was hoping to build up his reputation. The fact that the contractor was on notice that this was a lower price is not problematic to his recovery of the full $150,000 because this was the \"bargain\" he contracted to. The contractor was the party who breached by informing the owner that he would not fulfill the contract on July 1. The owner is therefore entitled to compensate him for the services rendered by the substitute contractor as of July 1, given this is an unequivocal anticipatory repudiation. The owner sought out substitute performance using diligent efforts, and found a contractor who completed the installation for $150,000. Therefore, in order for the owner to be compensated for the benefit of his bargain, he is entitled to teh difference beetween the substituted service less the contract price, which in this case will include the $50,000 above the price to be paid.\n\n2) The owner will not be able to recover lost profits. Lost profits are available to the non-breaching party when the contract expressly states that time is of the essence or where the breaching party was aware that a delay in there performance will result in lost profits. Without such notice or contractual language, the court will not award lost profits given it is not foreseeable at the time of contract that a delay would cause the owner to lose profits. This is especially true if the lost profits would be hard to calculate given there was a new enterprise or business venture. Here, the contract stated that the seats would be installed by no later than August 15th but there is no time is of the eseence clause. However, at common law, it is assumed that unless stated, time is of the essence and contractors have a reasonable time to complete performance if there are any delays. Further, there is no evidence that the contractor was aware of the need for the seats to be installed by August 15th nor was he aware of the pending film festival. The court found specifically that the contract was unaware of the plans to hold a film festival at the time it entered into the contract. The contract was breached well in advance of the date performance was due and even so, on the date construction was to start. The contractor was not able to find a replacement contractors that could finish until September 15th, but that will not affect the lost profits analysis given there was no notice of these potential lost profits at the time of contract. Further, this venture was new, so it would be difficult to predict the level of profits to be earned at the time of contract. Therefore, the contractor will not be liable to the owner for lost profits from the film festival.\n\n3) If the owner is entitled to recover lost profits, he would be able to recover $35,000. The issue is whether it is reasonable for the court to reduce the damages for a film festival at the local college when the purpose of the festival was to celebrate the new theater's opening. Where there is a breach of contract, the non-breaching party will have a duty to mitigate damages through reasonable efforts. Where damages are mititgated, the profits earned from the substitute performance will be deducted from the damages owed. In the case of a personal services contract, the court will not require the party to perform services that are not sufficiently similar to those it contracted to complete. Here, the purpose of hosting the film festival was for the owner to celebrate his new theater. Hosting a festival at a local college would not fulfill this same purpose for the owner in creating publicity around the theater. If this was found to be a reasonable alternative, the damages recoverable would only be $10,000 but here, the purpose of the festival would not be fulfilled. Therefore, the owner should recover for the full $35,000.\n\nSample Answer\n\n$50,000 for the Amount Paid to the Substitute Contractor\n\nThe first issue is whether the $50,000 paid to the substitute contractor is recoverable by the plaintiff-movie theater owner.\n\nThe judge found that the contractor's actions with respect to the seat installment agreement constituted a breach of contract between the movie theater owner and the contractor. It is irrelevant for damages purposes in this case whether the common law or the Uniform Commercial Code (hereinafter \"UCC\") governs this claim. Typically, the UCC governs contracts for the sale of goods, and the common law governs where services are the bargained-for benefit. Where there is a combination of goods and services negotiated in a contract, courts typically employ the predominant purpose test unless otherwise provided for in the contract at issue. Here, a mixture of goods and services was to be provided for the $100,000. The movie theater owner negotiated to pay that price to cover both the cost of the chair (the goods) and the cost of installation (the services). Analyzing the issue under the predominant purpose test, we do not know how much of the $100,000 was to be paid for the goods and how much for the services. However, it apppears from the agreement that the predominant purpose of the contract was the services: it was the installation of the seats that concerned the owner rather than the seats themselves: it is likely the owner could have ordered and received the seats from any manufacturer before August 15, but the owner needed the seats installed in the theater, which is likely the predominant purpose. Thus, the common law governs in this case.\n\nIn the event of a breach under the common law, the plaintiff in a contracts action is entitled to recover damages resulting from the breach. Monetary damages can include, among others, expectation damages, reliance damages, and consequential damages. Expectation damages seek to put the nonbreaching party in the same position he or she would have been in absent a breach; reliance damages, which cannot be awarded in connection with expectation damages, compensate the nonbreaching party for any expenses incurred in reliance on performance of the contract; consequential damages are those damages that flow from the result of the breach. Regarding this sepcific award, expectation damages would be most appropriate because the additional $50,000 is easily quantifiable, and the movie theater owner is seeking with these damages to be placed in the position the owner would have been if the contract had been performed, i.e. that seats were installed in the theater for $100,000.\n\nTo recover expectation damages, the damages must be easily quanitifiable, and the recovery must place the nonbreaching party in the same position as if the breach had not occurred. It is appropriate in a construction contract to calculate these damages by subtracting the contract price from the price actually paid. Because the contractor unequivocally notiifed the owner that it would not perform before performance was set to begin, this constitutes an anticipatory repudiation. In addition, there must be no defense to liability, such that performance of the contract was impossible, impractical, or that the purpose of the contract was frustrated. There are no facts to indicate the availability of such a defense here: to the contrary, the contractor breached solely because it obtained a more lucrative contact elsewhere. Even where a breach occurred without defense, however, a plaintiff always has an obligation to mitigate damages to any extent practicable, particularly in the case of anticipatory repudiation. This means that the plaintiff has the duty to put in a good faith effort offset the costs that will occur as a result of the breach and may not simply inactively allow the breach to occur and sue for damages.\n\nHere, the plaintiff expected when he or she formed the contract that seats would be installed in the movie theater for $100,000. Instead, seats were installed in the movie theater for $150,000, $50,000 more than what the plaintiff expected. There is no defense available to the contractor that would relieve it of its obligations under the contract. In addition, the owner fulfilled its obligations to mitigate damages: the facts indicate the the owner began \"diligent efforts\" and an \"extensive search\" \"immediately\" after learning the contractor would breach. This conduct satisfies the owner's duty to mitigate damages, and the movie theater owner is entitled to damages.\n\nReliance damages are unavailable in this case. There are no facts indicating the owner expended any funds relying that the contract be fulfilled, but costs from things such as advertising the film festival would fall into this category. However, the amount paid for things like this is presumably less than the $50,000 available as expectation damages, and a plaintiff may not recover both expectation and reliance damages, so the owner would be better-suited to seek the expectation damages.\n\nThus, it is appropriate for the movie theater owner to recover the $50,000 as expectation damages from the contractor.\n\nLost Profits from the Cancellation of the Film Festival\n\nThe next issue is whether the movie theater owner is entitled to recover lost profits resulting from the cancellation of the film festival.\n\nUnbeknownst to the contractor, the movie theater owner needed the seats installed in its theater by August 15 to be prepared for the planned film festival at the theater. Had the duties been performed in accordance with the agreed-upon terms in the contract, the movie theater owner anticipated it would have made $35,000 in profits from the movie festival.\n\nSuch a loss would likely be characterized as consequential damages. Consequential damages are those harms which flow from the result of the breach. Consequential damages are recoverable only where the plaintiff can show that the damages were foreseeable and that the defendant knew that the plaintiff would suffer a unique harm as a result of the breach. It is foreseeable that a movie theater owner would lose profits from ticket sales as a result of the contractor's breach, although it is difficult to say whether the profits from a movie festival would be foreseeable. However, this award likely is unavailable because the judge found that the contractor did not know about the festival, i.e. that the movie owner would suffer these unique damages as a result of the breach.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that the owner will be able to recover the lost profits from the movie festival.\n\nAmount of Lost Profits from the Cancellation of the Film Festival\n\nThe foregoing notwithstanding, there is still an issue of how much the owner would be able to recover if it could recover lost profits from the movie festival.\n\nAssuming that is the case, it is likely that the movie theater owner would be able to recover $35,000, because, despite any duty to mitigate, it could likely show some reason why moving the location of the film festival was unreasonable.\n\nWhen a breach of contract occurs, there is a duty on the nonbreaching party to mitigate damages to the extent reasonable. In its defense, the contractor has shown that the movie theater could have mitigated its damages relating to lost profits. The owner expected to make $35,000 if it had been able to show the film festival if the breach had not occurred, but the contractor proved that the owner could have still made $25,000 if it had moved the festival, thus mitigating the damages. However, the owner would likely be successful in showing that it is impractiable for a movie theater to show a film festival at a separate location. Even where the theater could make some profit, the purpose of a movie theater's business is to provide a venue for the public to watch movies. Part of the business model iincludes enticing customers to return to the theater so the theater may continue to profit. Requiring a movie theater to present a film festival at an alternative location would frustrate the entire purpose of the movie theater's business, and there would be thus no duty to move the location of the film festival.\n\nThus, the owner would likely be able to recover the full $35,000 fo lost profits.\n\nMEE Question 5\n\nTwelve years ago, Wendy and Frank were married in State A. One year later, their daughter, Danielle, was born in State A. The couple and their daughter have continued to live in State A.\n\nOne year ago, Frank lost his job as a steelworker after suffering a serious back injury. Frank’s doctor has said that he will not be able to return to work.\n\nOne month ago, Frank filed an action against Wendy seeking spousal support. Frank filed the action after Wendy, a commercial airline pilot whose work frequently necessitates her absence from home, stopped depositing her wages into the couple’s joint bank account and refused to pay household bills. Frank’s unemployment insurance is inadequate to pay all the household bills.\n\nDanielle’s school recently sent her parents a note indicating that Danielle will not be allowed to enroll in school next year unless the parents provide proof of her vaccination. Frank, based on his personal, nonreligious beliefs, has consistently refused to allow Danielle to receive any vaccinations. Danielle does not satisfy the requirements for a medical exemption. State A has amended its mandatory vaccination law by eliminating all nonmedical exemptions based on “personal beliefs.” As amended, the law requires, as a precondition to a child’s enrollment in any public school, that “the child’s parent or guardian must provide proof that the child has received all vaccinations mandated by the State Department of Health.” Frank has brought an action challenging the State A vaccination law under the U.S. Constitution as a violation of his parental rights.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Danielle, age 11, with her parents’ permission, went to visit her aunt in State B. One week into the visit, the aunt called Frank and Wendy and told them that Danielle did not want to return to her parents’ home because “Mom is always traveling, Dad is really depressed since his back injury, and I just can’t stand living there anymore.” The aunt told Frank and Wendy that “I can’t in good conscience send her home, so I’m immediately going to court to seek legal custody.”\n\nMay Frank obtain spousal support from Wendy? Explain.\n\n2. Will Frank’s constitutional challenge prevail? Explain.\n\n3. In what state must the aunt file a custody petition? Explain.\n\n4. Is the court likely to grant legal custody of Danielle to her aunt? Explain.\n\nSample Answer\n\n1. The issue is whether an spouse is required to support a relationship financially. In certain aspects, individuals who are married are considered to be one unit under the law; meanwhile, in other ways they continue having their individual identities. A marriage is not only about the duties and rights that spouses have as a unit under the law, but also includes several duties to each other. The doctrine of necessaries in one of those duties that is owed from one spouse to the other. It requires that a spouse be liable for what is necessary within a marital relationship and family. This doctrine includes supplying the basic sustenance (food, clothing, a roof over their head) and can include the paying of medical expenses, as medical care is also considered to be a necessary. The doctrine of necessaries applies because what is at issue are the family's household bills. This doctrine would also apply even if Frank needed the money to pay his medical expenses as a result of his back injury. Although Wendy may not be required to deposit her money into the couple's join bank account, under the doctrine of necessaries she would be required to pay the household bills.\n\nSpousal support is limited to situations where a married couple has gotten divorced and there is an economically dependent spouse. Frank may be considered an economically dependent spouse because he cannot return to work due to a back injury and his unemployment insurance is not enough; however, he is not filing for divorce and therefore cannot obtain spousal support from Wendy. Wendy will be required to pay the household bills and provide the necessaries that are needed within this marital relationship.\n\n2. Constitutionally, parents have rights as to how they raise their children and how they are educated. However, these rights are subject to certain limitations by state and requiring vaccinations of children who are enrolling in school would an appropriate limitation. The right of a parent to raise their children is a fundamental right under the constitution. State laws that violate a fundamental right are subject to strict scrutiny. In order for a law to pass strict scrutiny it must be necessary to pursue a compelling government interest. Here, State A's law that requires proof of all vaccinations mandated by the state's department of health would pass strict scrutiny because there is a compelling government interest: the health of the entire state. This interest is compelling because not only are the lives of children who attend at risk, but also any other child who comes into contact with those children, as well as the family members, and any other people who come into contact with diseases that could be protected from by vaccinations. The law is necessary because there are less restrictive ways to ensure that each child who attends public schools are vaccinated. The facts state that Danielle does not satisfy the requirements for medical exceptions, meaning that the law likely has certain exceptions, and only non-medical exemptions based on \"personal beliefs\" were eliminated showing that it is narrowly tailored. Because the State A statute passes strict scrutiny Frank's constitutional challenge would not prevail.\n\n3. Aunt must file in State A because State A is Danielle's home state. The issue is whether a child custody petition can be fild and heard in the state where the child is physically located. A child custody petition must be filed in the home state of a child. A child's home state is determined by where they have been living consecutively for 6 months. Based on the facts Frank, Wendy and Danielle have lived in State A for more than the past 6 months. Danielle has not been in state B long enough for it to be her home state. Even if she were there for 6 consecutive months it would not become her home state as she is not there with her parent or parents. Danielle's home state is the domicile of her parents, which is state A, because as a child she cannot chose her domicile, instead it is determined by operation of law.\n\n4. The issue is whether a court can terminate the parental rights of biological parents when a third-party petitions for custody. When a court is looking to grant custody as between parents, the court looks to the best interest of the child. In this consideration, the court has many considerations like the mental, emotional and physical health of the parties, who has been the primary caregiver, how well adjusted the child would be, if the child is 12 years old or over the court will heavily weigh what the child wants. If the child is younger than 12, the court will not give the child's desire that much weight. However, when the custody battle is between a parent and a third-party, the court will look at whether the parents are unfit to have custody over the child. Unfitness is determined if the parents have abandoned the child or if the parents have abused the child. The court is not likely to grant aunt legal custody of Danielle to her aunt unless the court finds that her parents are unfit. The facts here do not hint at Wendy and Frank being unfit, they may not be perfect because Wendy is barely home and the father's despression, however this is not likely to be found as unfittness by the court, even though Danielle wants to stay with her aunt.\n\nSample Answer\n\n1. May Frank obtain spousal support from Wendy?\n\nSpousal support, or alimony, is generally awarded in situations where one spouse is unable to live without the assistance of another spouse (although it frequently comes up in divorce situations unlike here). It is typically given after reviewing a totality of the circumstances including factors such as; income of both spouses, length of marriage, health, lifestyle, necessity, change in circumstance, etc.. Here, Frank and Wendy were married for 12 years, shared a joint bank account, had a child, Danielle. A year ago, frank lost his job as a steelworker after he suffered a serious back injury and he will be unable to return to work. In addition, Wendy has stopped depositing her wages in the bank account and refuses to pay household bills. Wendy is a commercial airline pilot, whose work frequently necessitates her absence but she holds a steady job. In addition, Frank's unemployment insurance is not enough to pay all the household bills. Based on these facts, it seems likely a court will look at Frank's situation and find it a rather grim outlook after review of all the circumstances. Thus, it is likely that a court may grant Frank some spousal support from wendy to ensure the household bills are paid and Frank can sufficiently make it on his own without a job that he used to help support them all these years.\n\n2. Will Frank's constitutional challenge prevail?\n\nTypically parental rights over a child are both legal and physical rights over the child's day to day physical routine and activities (such as school, extracurriculars, etc..) or legal rights and abilities such as religious beliefs, etc.. These rights stem from your fundamental rights in the constitution of a right to privacy. Typically a parent does have the right to hold a child from medicine for religious reasons. This right will only be breached in the most extreme of circumstances if they go against the best interests and general welfare of the child or could result in death (modern trend). Here, Frank's right is based on his personal, non-religious beliefs, and that is to refuse Danielle of vaccinations. In addition, Danielle does not satisfy the requirements for a medical exemption and State A has amended its vacinnation law by eliminating all nonmedical exemptions based on \"personal beliefs.\" As amended, to enroll in public school there must be proof that the child has received all vaccinations mandated by the State Department of health.\n\nParental rights may fall under an individuals privacy rights which are a fundamental right. Fundamental rights are governed by strict scrutiny when evaluating if rights were violated. Strict scrutiny looks to see if a government can show that there were no less restrictive means to showing/proving a compelling government interest. Here, it seems unlikely that a court will allow this challenge to prevail. Keeping the public up to date in vaccinations is an compelling government interest as it promotes the general health and welfare of the public not to mention in this situation the health and wellness of students in public schools who could get sick or Danielle's getting sick from lack of vaccinations. It is also unlikely that there is a less restrictive mean than a proof of vaccination form to allow enrollment in the public school. This will be hard to prove against for Frank as the amendment seems to be in the best interest of the child, children in public schools, and the state, all compelling government interests in a very low restrictive way. Thus, Frank's constitutional challenge will likely not prevail.\n\n3. In what state must the aunt file a custody petition?\n\nChild custody is governed under the UCCJEA, the Uniform child custody jurisidiction enforcement act. Under the UCCJEA (And if the CKPA, child kidnapping preventation act, applies) it typically would follow suit in the same way, only a state which has custody jurisdiction over the child can make decisions on custody. Under the UCCJEA, custody is usually decided in two ways: the first, the home state test which is where if a child has lived in a home state continouosly in the last 6 months and still either resides there or a parent retains a connection to the state within the next 6 months, that state will have home state jurisdiction. If home state jurisdiction does not exist pursuant to the above, then courts will look to see which state has the most signigicant connection to the child. In addition, under the full faith and credit clause, any jurisdiction that is valid in State A will be valid in State B. So were the aunt able to file in A and receive custody, State B will be able to enforce it.\n\nHere, it seems likely that home state jurisdiction would apply here. Danielle has lived in State A since she was born with her parents, this is a continuous domicile as she has lived there in the last 6 months continuously without interruption. While she is in State B with her Aunt now, who is challenging their legal custody, her parents are still in State A and she has only been gone for 2 weeks. Thus, if home state jurisdiciton is found (likely it is) the aunt must file the custody petition in State A who will retain custody jurisdiction. If home state does not apply, the most significant connects test applies and even then it seems likely that State A would hold jurisdiction as she has lived there for 12 years, goes to school in State A, and both her parents still live there. In addition, she went to visit her Aunt with her parents permission. Thus, it seems that no matter the test, state A holds jurisdiction however under the UCCJEA, it seems likely the home state jurisdiction test will be followed and applicable.\n\n4. Is the court likely to grant legal custody of Danielle to her aunt?\n\nTypically, biological parents have a right to take care of their children over any other individuals, unless they are incapicated, they cannot supply for the best interests and general welfare of the child, or take care of the child. In addition, a child's wants, if of sufficient maturity, will also be taken into account. Here, Frank cannot work after suffering a severe injury at work however he is of sound mind and not abusing, hurting, or otehrwise affecting Danielle negatively in anyway. It will be argued that Danielle stated that he is very depressed and it will likely also be brought up that he refuses to allow her vaccinnations. These both can be against the interest and general welfare of the child, Danielle. In addition, it is brought up by Danielle that her mom is always travelling and likely her absence from home affects Danielle negatively especially given the recent situation of her mom not helpign with household bills. But there is no indication that she is not of sound mind or harming Danielle in anyway. As Danielle is 11 and of sound mind, a court will take her statement and listen to it given she is stating she cant stand to live there anymore. Typically, a biological parents rights to their child is only broken in those situations where it is clear keepign the child there is resulting in abuse, harm, or clearly not in the best interests and welfare of the child. Here, neither parents harm her but their current sitaution is only causing stress and strife to Danielle's life. However, her mom travelling for work and her dad depressed after a workplace injury, with neither causing any harm to Danielle, is likely not enough reason right now for their parental rights to be terminated and legal custody granted to Danielle's aunt. If it is to be seen that the parents divorce, things continue to go down hill and they cant provide for her and pay for bills and her meals or school, etc.. then maybe a court will find that it is no longer in her best interest to stay with her parents.\n\nMEE Question 6\n\nTrident Healthcare Inc., incorporated in State X, owns and operates hospitals and clinics in States X, Y, and Z. Medical information for all of Trident’s current and former patients is stored on computer equipment housed at Trident’s corporate headquarters in State X.\n\nLast December, unknown persons hacked into Trident’s computer system and obtained the personal medical information of at least 30,000 Trident patients, including 5,000 patients living in State X, 10,000 patients living in State Y, and 15,000 patients living in State Z. However, there is no evidence that the thieves have used any of this medical information.\n\nThe State X Privacy Protection Act imposes an absolute duty on health-care providers, including companies like Trident, to keep patient medical information private. The legislature concluded that the “invasion of privacy” resulting from data breaches causes significant harm to the individuals involved. Thus, the law allows any person whose private medical information is obtained by an unauthorized third party in any manner to recover actual damages from the health-care provider. Further, because such damages are sometimes difficult to quantify, the state law provides that an individual is entitled to a minimum statutory (nominal) damages award of $500 to compensate for this “invasion of privacy.” This state law is not preempted by any federal law.\n\nA man, who is a citizen of State X and whose medical records were stored in the Trident computers, has brought a class action in the federal district court of State X against Trident on behalf of himself and all the persons whose health-care information was taken during the hacking of Trident’s computer system. The man is represented by counsel with extensive experience in class actions of this type. The complaint is limited to claims arising out of the hacking of medical information. It seeks no actual damages but does seek statutory damages on behalf of all members of the class pursuant to the State X statute. The complaint alleges the facts detailed above and alleges that the court has jurisdiction based on diversity, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332. The complaint also alleges that most if not all of Trident’s patients are U.S. citizens who are domiciled in the states where they receive their health care.\n\nState X’s legislatively adopted Civil Practice Rules provide that “if any statute or law of this state allows for an award of statutory or nominal damages, recovery of such damages may be sought in an individual action but not in a class action.”\n\nTrident has moved to dismiss the man’s class action brought in federal district court, arguing that (i) the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the state-law claim raised by the class action, (ii) the action fails to allege a claim upon which relief can be granted because of the state law barring class actions to recover statutory damages, and (iii) the man does not have standing to bring a statutory damages claim in federal court.\n\nWith respect to each of these arguments, how should the court rule? Explain.\n\nSample Answer\n\n1) The issue is how the court should rule with regard to Trident's motion to dismiss concerning the subject-matter jurisdiction claim.\n\nIn order to have subject matter jurisdiction over a state law claim, a court must have either federal question jurisdiction, meaning the plaintiff's complaint concerns rights or statutes under federal law, or diversity jurisdiction, which requires the plaintiff and defendant to be from different states (complete diversity), and for the amount in controversy to exceed $75,000. A corporation's domicile is both the place of incorporation and its principal place of business, which courts have held is the \"nerve center\" of the corporation. In a class action, under the Class Action Fairness Act, the parties need only have minimal diversity (at least one plaintiff must be diverse from at least one defendant), the amount in controvery must exceed $5 million, and the plaintiffs must equal or exceed 100 people.\n\nThe man is from State X, and Trident is incorporated in State X. Trident's principal place of business is likely also State X, where its corporate headquarters are located, although Trident has clinics in other states. Assuming that at least some of the affected persons from other states join the action (and are properly added to the class under Rule 23), complete diversity will be satisfied. One-thousand people would have to join in order for the amount-in-controversy to exceed the CAFA threshold of $5 million ($500 per person, times 1,000 people equals $5 million). Assuming that the man and his lawyer can find people to satisfy these threshold amounts, the court will have diversity subject matter jurisdiction over the claim.\n\n2) The issue is how the court should rule on Trident's motion that The man failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because of the state law barring class actions.\n\nA court with diversity jurisdiction over a claim is obligated to apply the state law in which it sits concerning substantive matters, and federal law concerning procedural matters under the U.S. Supreme Court's Erie decision. However, even if there is a state law governing an area, the state statute or rule may be prevented, if there is evidence that a federal rule or statute was intended to \"occupy the field\" in the area of litigation.\n\nAlthough State X's legislature adopted a Civil Practice Rule that is direclty on point to this action, there are counterveiling interests at stake here. There is evidence that Congress passed the Class Action Fairness Act to occupy the field of class actions, and therefore should preempt all state law in this area. Additionally, there is a federal rule on point, Rule 23, which governs class action requirements. As such, it is likely that a court will find that if he can meet the rule 23 requirements and CAFA standards, it will not be granted.\n\n3) The issue is whether the man has standing to bring this statutory damages claim in federal court.\n\nIn order to have a standing, a person must suffer an injury-in-fact. That injury must be caused by the defendant, and the plaintiff must have suffered damages. There must also be redressability of the plaintiff's claim.\n\nAccording to the Privacy Protection Act, the man and his similarly situated class members have standing because the breach of privacy caused injury, that injury was caused by Trident, and the statute provides a method for redressability in the form of statutory damages.\n\nWhen a claim is in federal court under diversity jurisdiction, a court must apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits. Klaxon. Assuming that the claim is properly in federal court (see above), the court is obligated to apply State X's substantive law. The Privacy Protection Act is substantive because it creates rights and a cause of action (a method of redressability) for the citizens of State X (and those who avail themselves of State X's laws).\n\nAlthough the Man did not suffer actual damages as a result of the hacking, the PPA, which the federal district court of State X overseeing a claim by way of diversity jurisdiction must apply as substantive state law, gave the Man standing, even in federal court.\n\nSample Answer\n\nSubject Matter Jurisdiction\n\nThe court does not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the state law claim. At issue is whether the man can use the federal act permitting general diversity rather than complete diversity for this to meet subject matter jurisdiction. Ordinarily, when a case is based on a state law claim only, a federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction when there is complete diversity and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. Complete diversity means every single plaintiff must be difference from every single defendant. In class actions, only the named class representative's residency matters for determining subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity. Furthermore, the named class representative must have a claim where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 on its own. Aggregation is not permitting. Therefore, under ordinary rules, there is no subject matter diversity here. A human citizen's residency for subject matter jurisdiction is determined based on that person's domicile, where the person is located with the intent to remain as domiciled. Here, the man is a resident of State X. For a corporation, a corporation is domiciled in every state it is incorporated and its personal place of business, which is the nerve center where directors and officers direct and control the corporation's actions. This is usually the corporation headquarters. Here Trident Healthcare Inc is incorporated in State X and has its principal place of business in State X. Therefore, this a State X plaintiff versus a State X defendant. Complete diversity is failed. Additionally, since the man's damages are probably limited to $500, then he does not meet the amount in controversy either.\n\nHowever, the federal legisalture enacted a statute that confers subject matter jurisdiction on class actions based on general diversity. Under this statute, a federal court may have subject matter jurisdiction when any plaintiff is diverse from any defendant. This statute applies when two factors are met: (1) there are more than 500 plaintiffs and (2) the total amount in controversy exceeds $5 million. Here, at least 30,000 people were injured by the hacking, well above the federal statutory number. Furthermore, even if each plaintiff is limited to $500, the total damages would be $15 million, well over the $5 million threshold. Therefore, since there are well over 500 plaintiffs and the alleged damages are well over the $5 million, the federal statute applies to confer subject matter jurisdiction. Since plaintiffs from State Y and State Z are diverse from Trident, a State X corporation, there is general diversity. Some plaintiffs are different from the defendant. Therefore, the federal statute confers subject matter jurisdiction in this case. The court does not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the state law claim.\n\nFailure to State a Claim and Eerie\n\nThe action does not fail to allege a claim upon which relief can be granted because of the state law claim barring class actions to recover statutory damages. At issue is whether the Eerie doctrine applies. When a federal court is sitting in diversity jurisdiction, it must apply two different set of laws. The federal court must apply the state substantive law but also apply the federal procedural law. When two procedural laws seem to conflict, the court will first decide whether or not there is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure on point. If so, it must be applied over the state law. If not, the court then must decide if the state law is actually procedural or whether it is actually substantive. There are five categories of rules that are immediately substantive like the statute of limitations, the tolling of the statute of limitations, the elements of claims or defenses etc. If not, the court will conduct an analysis determining whether the state law is \"outcome determinative,\" whether applying the state law would increase forum shopping, and whether the state has an interest in having its laws applied. Here, a state law provides that if any statute of law of the state provides for an individual award of statutory or nominal damages, recovery of such damages are limited to individual actions but prohibited in class actions. The analysis is easy because there is a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure directly on point. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 affords plaintiffs the ability to be certified as a class action when it meets the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and representative requirements. If so, the court can certify the class action. Furthermore, the class action must involve one of three common themes, including the fact that a common necleus surrounds the one action. Here, all of the requirements are met and the third type of class action can be certified. As such, FRCP 23 directly conflicts with State X's law. Because there is a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure directly on point, the federal court must apply that federal rule. Therefore, this action can be certified as a class action and the action does not fail to allege a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n\nStanding\n\nThe man has standing to bring a statutory damages claim in federal court. At issue is whether the man has met all three requirements for standing. In order for a federal court to hear a plaintiff's cause of action, that plaintiff must have standing to bring the claim. Standing requires three things: an injury, causation, and redressability. Here, all three elements are met. First, the man clearly suffered an injury. While his medical information has not been used by the hacking thieves, his information was still stolen and he was injured in that regard. While it may be too remote to find that there will be an injury based on the thieves using the information, just the fact that the man's information was stolen indicates he suffered an injury. The legislature of State X itself has found that there is significant harm to indivduals via an invasion of privacy in these types of situations. Furthermore, there is causation. This requires that the defendant be the cause of the plaintiff's injury. While the direct cause of injury may have been the hackers, Trident can still be considered the cause of the data breach. Had Trident exercised better care and protected the medical information of its patients better, perhaps the breach would not have happened. There is sufficient plausibility to say that Trident did not provide its medical patients with enough protection regarding their medical information. Thus, Trident can be deemed the cause of the man's injury. Lastly, there is redressability, which means the court can grant some kind of relief to the plaintiff for the injury. Here, the court can award the man monetary damages, or declaratory relief as well. The monetary damages alone are sufficient to show that the court could redress the man's injury and make him whole. Since the man can show an injury, Trident causing that injury, and the court's ability to redress that injury, the man has standing to bring a statutory damages claim in federal court."
