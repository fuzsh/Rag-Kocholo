        "text": "No, unless you made a special request, and that request was approved. In general, applicants are able to access personal belongings during breaks and, if necessary, during the exam in the company of a proctor. A special request can be made at least 18 days in advance of the exam online from your user home page. All requests must be supported (if applicable) by written documentation from a treatment provider.\n\nOn the first day of the bar exam, registration begins at 6:30 a.m., make sure to give yourself enough time to register, go through door security and be in your seats no later than 8:15 a.m. Instructions begin promptly at 8:15 a.m.\n\nThere is no registration on the second day of the bar exam. Doors to the testing center will open at 7:00 a.m. Please plan for enough time to go through door security and be in your seats no later than 8:15 a.m. Instructions begin promptly at 8:15 a.m.\n\nAny applicant with a disability for which testing accommodation is needed must request such accommodation though the online admissions site at least 80 days prior to the examination date. Applicants requesting testing accommodations because of disabilities must provide appropriate documentation of the disability and specify the extent to which the standard testing procedures need to be modified. The burden of proof is on the applicant to show the need for any testing accommodations. The Bar reserves the right to make final judgement concerning testing accommodations and may have documentation reviewed by a medical specialist, psychologist or learning disability specialist. See the online admissions site for additional information and click here for instructions regarding testing accommodations requests and required documentation. Any testing accommodation may not compromise the integrity or security of the examination or affect the standards set for the examination.\n\nYour agent for service is not required to be a Washington lawyer; you may designate a friend or family member, or your firm’s branch office, as long as the agent is within the state of Washington. If you can’t find an individual you may designate a service organization. Neither the Secretary of State nor the WSBA may be designated as an agent of service. We cannot recommend any businesses or services, but an internet search should provide several options. Please note that you must provide your agent’s street address, not a post office box or other private mailbox location.\n\nOnce you complete all of thenew admittee licensing requirements, a recommendation for your admission is sent to the Washington Supreme Court. It generally takes two to three weeks for the Court to issue an admission order admitting you to the practice of law in Washington. You will be notified by email from WSBA when you have been admitted and a license number is assigned. Your bar card and certificate will be mailed within two to three weeks.\n\nIf you are employed as house counsel in Washington State, you can choose between applying for the limited license or for full admission by way of admission by motion. The WSBA encourages lawyers who are licensed in another U.S state or territory and have active legal experience for three of the past five years, to apply for Admission by Motion. Lawyers who are admitted by motion are fully licensed members of the WSBA and are authorized to fully practice law and appear in Washington State courts.\n\nLawyers admitted under APR 8(f) as house counsel are strictly limited to providing advice to their employer-client and cannot appear in court but still must abide by the same MCLE requirements and license fees as fully licensed lawyers. Additionally, if a lawyer licensed as house counsel under APR 8(f) later applies for full admission by motion, they will have to pay all of the same application fees again.\n\nAll applicants for Admission by Motion must take the Washington Law Component (WLC), a 60-question online test that can be taken at any time after submitting an application. House counsel applicants do not have to take this test, but they do have access to the materials if they want to review them.\n\nIf you are employed as House Counsel in Washington State, you can choose between applying for the limited House Counsel license or for full admission and licensing by way of admission by motion.

Lawyers who are admitted by motion are members of the WSBA and are fully licensed to practice law and appear in Washington State Courts. Lawyers licensed under Washington Supreme Court Admission and Practice Rule (APR))8(f) as House Counsel are strictly limited to providing advice to their employer-client and cannot appear in court, but they still must abide by the same MCLE requirements and pay the same license fees as active status lawyers. Additionally, if a lawyer licensed as House Counsel under Washington Supreme Court (APR)8(f) later applies for full admission by motion, they will have to pay all of the same application fees again.\n\nIf you have a UBE score of 266 or higher from another state, you can transfer your score to Washington for up to 40 months after the date of the administration of the UBE in which the score was earned. The Washington Supreme Court reduced the minimum UBE passing score in Washington from 270 to 266 for all exams administered from July 2020 through the implementation of the NextGen Bar Exam, including examinations already administered in February 2023, July 2023 and February 2024. The minimum passing score of 266 applies equally to UBE Score Transfers under APR 3(d).\n\nThe MPRE score must be acquired 3 years before or after the date you sat for the UBE. You must have sat for the full UBE. Washington only accepts official UBE score transcripts in their entirety from the NCBE. We do not accept score transfers for the individual test components, nor do we allow applicants to register for select parts of the exam\n\nAll applicants for Admission by Motion must take the Washington Law Component (WLC), a 60-question online test that can be taken at any time after submitting an application.
