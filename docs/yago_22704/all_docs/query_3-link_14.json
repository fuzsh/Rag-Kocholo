        "text": "Islamabad, Pakistan – A court in Pakistan has rejected an appeal by former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife to suspend a February ruling that their 2018 marriage violated Islamic law.\n\nThe decision by the court in Islamabad on Thursday means that Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, will remain behind bars.\n\nThe seven-year jail sentence, handed on February 3, was announced five days before the country’s general elections and followed two other convictions for Khan in separate cases. Both have since been overturned.\n\nThe marriage case against the couple was filed last year by Bibi’s former husband, Khawar Maneka, who alleged that his divorced wife did not observe the necessary three-month break required under Islamic law before marrying Khan.\n\nManeka claims he divorced his wife in November 2017. Khan announced his third marriage with Bibi in February 2018, months before he became the prime minister.\n\nThe couple filed multiple appeals against the conviction, seeking a suspension of the judgement.\n\nAnother appeal by Khan and Bibi to annul the February conviction is expected to be heard from July 2.\n\nSayed Zulfiqar Bukhari, a senior leader of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party and close aide of the cricketer-turned-politician, described Thursday’s ruling as a “sad day for the judiciary”.\n\n“The hatred of a few is adamant to destroy all institutions for it. Dismissing the appeal shows that there is nothing on Imran Khan and his wife except this outrageous case,” Bukhari told Al Jazeera.\n\n“This case is disgusting at all levels. Is [this] what the current setup wants to be remembered for – keeping Imran Khan and his wife in jail in a fake marriage case,” he asked.\n\nOmar Ayub Khan, another senior PTI leader and member of parliament, condemned the court’s decision and said an appeal would be filed.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the party had warned that a new political crisis would grip the country if Khan was not released.\n\n“The former prime minister has been imprisoned for 11 months, while during this time he has been acquitted or granted bail in 18 different cases,” the PTI said in its statement.\n\nRana Sanaullah, a top leader of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) party, had recently alleged that Khan’s narrative was to sow chaos in the country.\n\nKhan and his wife were previously handed a separate 14-year sentence in a case related to the illegal sale of state gifts, but in April their conviction was overturned by the Islamabad High Court.\n\nKhan had also been sentenced to 10 years on charges of leaking state secrets, along with former Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.\n\nEarlier this month, the Islamabad High Court overturned that verdict, but Khan remained behind bars due to his conviction in the unlawful marriage case.\n\nIn May, the same court had granted Khan bail in a high-profile land deal case in which he was accused of colluding with Malik Riaz, a real estate tycoon. Khan has been accused of signing a deal with Riaz that caused the national exchequer a loss of more than $239m in a quid pro quo arrangement with the businessman to build an educational institute.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last month alleged that “some judges” were favouring Khan.\n\n“While many judges are patriotic, a few black sheep facilitated Imran Khan’s million corruption,” he said at a PMLN event.\n\nKhan was in power from August 2018 till April 2022 before being removed through a vote of no confidence in parliament, which he blamed on a United States-led conspiracy that also involved Pakistan’s powerful military establishment – a charge denied by both.\n\nThe Pakistani military, which has directly ruled the country for more than three decades and has an overreaching influence in the political sphere, was also accused of orchestrating Khan’s rise to power.\n\nFollowing his removal from office, Khan and his PTI have been facing a state crackdown which intensified after May 2023 when the former prime minister was briefly arrested.\n\nHis followers went on a rampage, protesting against his arrest and demanding his immediate release. Khan was released in less than 48 hours, but thousands of party workers and leaders were arrested, with more than 100 tried in draconian military courts.\n\nThe PTI continued to face difficulties as it was barred from using its electoral symbol – the cricket bat – in the February elections while Khan was declared ineligible to participate due to his imprisonment."
