        "text": "When the news got out last week that 80-year-old convicted murderer Charles Manson and Afton Elaine “Star” Burton, the 26-year-old woman who runs his social media sites, have been granted a marriage license by the state of California, it caused a considerable uproar — especially among lonely singles who lamented their own inability to find love while ol’ Charlie somehow got engaged without ever leaving the confines of Corcoran State Prison.\n\nBut as the saying goes, it’s not you — it’s them. While killing someone isn’t a recommended way to attract a mate, it certainly does seem to work for some folks. Hybristophilia — the condition of being turned on by someone who commits a violent crime — has often been cited by psychologists as an explanation for why some women (and men) willingly marry jailbirds. If Manson does get hitched while rotting in prison, he certainly won’t be the first convicted murderer to do so."
