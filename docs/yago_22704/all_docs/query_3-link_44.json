The revelation or discovery of any of the following may be cause for further inquiry before the board recommends whether the applicant or registrant possesses the character and fitness to practice law:\n\na. unlawful conduct;\n\nb. academic misconduct;\n\nc. making or procuring any false or misleading statement or omission of relevant information, including any false or misleading statement or omission on the Bar Application, or any amendment, or in any testimony or sworn statement submitted to the board;\n\nd. misconduct in employment;\n\ne. acts involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation;\n\nf. abuse of legal process;\n\ng. financial irresponsibility;\n\nh. neglect of professional obligations;\n\ni. violation of an order of a court;\n\nj. evidence of a mental disorder that may impair the ability to practice law;\n\nk. evidence of a substance use disorder that may impair the ability to practice law;\n\nl. denial of admission to the bar in another jurisdiction on character and fitness grounds;\n\nm. disciplinary action by a lawyer disciplinary agency or other professional disciplinary agency of any jurisdiction; or\n\nn. any other conduct that reflects adversely on the character or fitness of the applicant.\n\n3-12 Determination of Present Character. The board must determine whether the applicant or registrant has provided satisfactory evidence of good moral character. The following factors, among others, will be considered in assigning weight and significance to prior conduct:\n\na. age at the time of the conduct;\n\nb. recency of the conduct;\n\nc. reliability of the information concerning the conduct;\n\nd. seriousness of the conduct;\n\ne. factors underlying the conduct;\n\nf. cumulative effect of the conduct or information;\n\ng. evidence of rehabilitation;\n\nh. positive social contributions since the conduct;\n\ni. candor in the admissions process; and,\n\nj. materiality of any omissions or misrepresentations.\n\n3-13 Elements of Rehabilitation. Any applicant or registrant who affirmatively asserts rehabilitation from prior conduct that adversely reflects on the person's character and fitness for admission to the bar must produce clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation including, but not limited to, the following elements:\n\na. strict compliance with the specific conditions of any disciplinary, judicial, administrative, or other order, where applicable;\n\nb. unimpeachable character and moral standing in the community;\n\nc. good reputation for professional ability, where applicable;\n\nd. lack of malice and ill feeling toward those who, by duty, were compelled to bring about the disciplinary, judicial, administrative, or other proceeding;\n\ne. personal assurances, supported by corroborating evidence, of a desire and intention to conduct one's self in an exemplary fashion in the future;\n\nf. restitution of funds or property, where applicable; and,\n\ng. positive action showing rehabilitation by occupation, religion, or community or civic service. Merely showing that an individual is now living as and doing those things he or she should have done throughout life, although necessary to prove rehabilitation, does not prove that the individual has undertaken a useful and constructive place in society.

Any person subpoenaed to appear and give testimony or to produce documents who refuses to appear to testify before the board, to answer any questions, or to produce documents, may be held in contempt of the board.

In cases where the facts are undisputed regarding an applicant's or registrant's prior conduct that adversely affects his or her character and fitness for admission to The Florida Bar, the board may forgo an investigative hearing and proceed directly with the execution of a Consent Agreement or the filing of Specifications as provided in rule 3-22.5.\n\n3-22.5 Board Action Following an Investigative Hearing. After an investigative hearing, the board may make any of the following determinations:\n\na. The applicant or registrant has established his or her qualifications as to character and fitness.\n\nb. The board will offer to the applicant or registrant a Consent Agreement in lieu of the filing of Specifications pertaining to drug, alcohol, or psychological problems and subject to provisions of rule 5-15.

The response to Specifications must be served in the form of a verified answer to the Specifications within 25 days of service of the Specifications.\n\n3-23.1 Failure to Serve the Answer. If an applicant or registrant fails to serve an answer to the Specifications within the 25-day deadline or within any extension of time allowed by the board, the Specifications will be deemed admitted, and the failure to serve an answer shall constitute a waiver of the applicant’s right to a formal hearing before the board pursuant to rule 3-23.2. The board will enter Findings of Fact, finding the Specifications proven, and appropriate conclusions of law that may include a recommendation that the applicant not be admitted to The Florida Bar, or that the registrant has not established his or her qualifications as to character and fitness.\n\n3-23.2 Formal Hearing. Except as provided in rule 3-23.1, any applicant or registrant who receives Specifications is entitled to a formal hearing before the board, representation by counsel at his or her own expense, disclosure by the Office of General Counsel of its witness and exhibit lists, cross-examination of witnesses, presentation of witnesses and exhibits on his or her own behalf, and access to the board’s subpoena power.

An order withholding adjudication of guilt of a charged felony will constitute conclusive proof of the criminal offense(s) charged.

The admissibility of results of a polygraph examination will be in accordance with Florida law.\n\n3-23.3 Formal Hearing Cost. Any applicant or registrant who receives Specifications that require the scheduling of a formal hearing must pay the administrative cost of $600.\n\n3-23.4 Selection of a Preferred Formal Hearing Date.

The applicant or registrant has not established his or her qualifications as to character and fitness and that the applicant or registrant be denied admission to The Florida Bar. A 2-year disqualification period is presumed to be the minimum period of time required before an applicant or registrant may reapply for admission and establish rehabilitation. In a case involving significant mitigating circumstances, the board has the discretion to recommend that the applicant or registrant be allowed to reapply for admission within a specified period of less than 2 years. In a case involving significant aggravating factors (including but not limited to material omissions or misrepresentations in the application process), the board has the discretion to recommend that the applicant or registrant be disqualified from reapplying for admission for a specified period greater than 2 years, but not more than 5 years.

The Findings, conclusions, and recommendation are subject to review by the Supreme Court of Florida as specified under rule 3-40. The Findings, conclusions, and recommendation are final, if not appealed, except in cases involving a favorable recommendation for applicants seeking readmission to the practice of law after having been disbarred or having resigned pending disciplinary proceedings. In those cases, the board will file a report containing its recommendation with the Supreme Court of Florida for final action by the court. Admission to The Florida Bar for those applicants will occur only by public order of the court. All reports, pleadings, correspondence, and papers received by the court in those cases are public information and exempt from the confidentiality provision of rule 1-60.\n\n3-23.8 Formal Hearing Transcript Cost.

The board may use the services of expert drafters to prepare bar examination questions, either by arranging for the drafting services of qualified persons, including out-of-state law teachers, or by using the services of the National Conference of Bar Examiners or another national agency. The board may use the services of trained expert readers. Readers will be selected solely upon the qualifications of the individuals.\n\n4-24.1 Essay Questions. Every essay question, whether drafted by the examiners or by expert drafters, will be thoroughly briefed on every point of law in the question and the question analyzed and approved by the board preceding inclusion of the question on the General Bar Examination.\n\n4-24.2 Machine-Scored Questions. Every machine-scored item of Part A must specify authority for the best response, and every item and authority should be analyzed and approved by the board preceding inclusion of the item on the General Bar Examination.\n\n4-25 Submission Methods. Applicants who take the General Bar Examination must do so for the sole purpose of fulfilling the admission requirements for The Florida Bar. An applicant may elect to take the General Bar Examination by either of the following methods:\n\na. Overall Method. Overall method is used only if the applicant takes Parts A and B during the same administration of the General Bar Examination.\n\nb. Individual Method. Individual method is used if the applicant takes only 1 part of the General Bar Examination. Applicants who elect to take only 1 part of the General Bar Examination under the individual method may not combine a score attained on 1 part from 1 administration with a score on the other part from a different administration. Applicants may not take Part A only using this method unless they have previously taken the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE) in Florida.\n\n4-25.1 Retention of Passing Status. If an applicant attains a passing scaled score on only 1 part and elects to take the overall method of the General Bar Examination as described above, the previous passing status will not be replaced by a failing status if the applicant fails to achieve a passing score on a subsequent submission effort.\n\n4-26 Scoring Method. Each examination paper produced by an applicant on the General Bar Examination will be separately graded. Papers will be graded and reported by number and not by applicant's name. The name of the writer of the examination paper will not be revealed by the staff to the members of the board or readers or any source other than the Supreme Court of Florida. To ensure maximum uniformity in all grading of essay questions, the board will use the services of multiple calibrated readers.\n\n4-26.1 Examination Scaling. The scores of each section of Part A will be converted to a common scale by a recognized statistical procedure so that each section is equally weighted. The sum of the converted section scores is the total score for Part A. All total scores attained by the applicants on Part A are converted to the same distribution as their Multistate Bar Examination (MBE) scaled scores. MBE scores (Part B) are the scaled scores on the MBE provided by the National Conference of Bar Examiners. Scaled scores are used in order to ensure that the standard of measurement of competence from examination to examination is not affected by the difficulty of the particular test or the ability of that particular group as distinguished from the general population of applicants.\n\n4-26.2 Pass/Fail Line. Effective July 1, 2004, each applicant must attain a scaled score of 136 or better on Part A and on Part B under the individual method and an average of 136 or better under the overall method, or such scaled score as may be fixed by the court.\n\n4-30 Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination.

Each examination paper produced by an applicant on the MPRE will be separately graded. The raw score attained by each applicant will be converted to a scaled score by the National Conference of Bar Examiners or its designee in order to ensure that the standard of measurement of competence from examination to examination is not affected by the difficulty of the particular test or the ability of that particular group as distinguished from the general population of applicants.\n\n4-33.1 Transfer of Score. The applicant must direct requests to transfer the score attained on the MPRE to the agency that administers the MPRE. Scores are transferred on a certificate supplied by the agency and must be forwarded directly by that agency to the board.\n\n4-33.2 Pass/Fail Line. On the MPRE, each applicant must attain a scaled score of 80 or better, or such scaled score as may be fixed by the court.\n\n4-40 Application for the General Bar Examination.\n\n4-41 Application Requirements.

Except for emergency petitions as designated by the board, no request for test accommodations will be processed if received after January 15 for the February examination or after June 15 for the July examination.\n\n4-43 Filing After the Deadline.
