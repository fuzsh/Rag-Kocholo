        "text": "(a)The Board of Law Examiners shall be composed of at least six members of The Missouri Bar learned in the law. This Court shall appoint each member for a term of nine years exclusive of any unexpired term. Any members appointed after March 1, 2001, should not be called on to serve more than one term.\n\nThe members of the board shall take and subscribe an oath or affirmation prior to the assumption of their official duties to discharge faithfully and impartially the duties of their office.\n\nThe board shall designate one of its members to serve as president and one as vice-president.\n\nThis Court may remove any member of the board and may also fill any vacancies on the board due to death, resignation or inability to serve.\n\nThe members of the board shall receive such compensation as may be allowed by this Court out of funds arising from application fees.\n\nThe Court may appoint an executive director of the board who shall serve at the pleasure of the Court.\n\n(b)All appropriate expenses for operations, equipment and expenses shall be paid from funds arising from application fees. After the payment of expenses following the July bar examination, funds remaining in the Board of Law Examiners account that exceed anticipated expenses may be disbursed, with the approval of the Court, to the Advisory Committee fund, to the board of trustees of The Missouri Bar, and to The Missouri Bar in such amounts as the Court shall determine to meet the needs of such entities.(a)Every applicant for admission to the bar by examination shall file with the clerk of this Court an application for bar examination in the form prescribed by the board. In order to be timely filed, an application shall be properly filed on or before March 1 for the July examination and on or before the prior October 1 for the February examination. For applicants who failed the most recent examination and are applying for the next scheduled examination, the application shall be properly filed on or before May 1 for the July examination and on or before the prior October 1 for the February examination in order to be timely filed. The prescribed fee, which is non-refundable, shall accompany the application. Applications will be accepted no earlier than February 1 for the July examination and no earlier than the prior September 1 for the February examination.(b)Subject to payment of an increased fee as set out in the prescribed fee schedule, an application filed after the timely filing date prescribed in Rule 8.07(a) will be accepted if it is properly filed no later than May 1 for the July examination or December 1 for the February examination. An application not properly filed by May 1 for the July examination or by December 1 for the February examination will not be accepted.(c)Except as provided in Rule 8.07(d), no person shall be eligible to take the bar examination until such person shall have met all the requirements for graduation with a juris doctorate degree from a law school approved by the American Bar Association. No applicant for admission by examination shall be certified for admission until the juris doctorate degree has been conferred. Proof that the requirements of this Rule 8.07(c) have been met shall be provided in such form and at such time as the board requires.(d)A person who fails to meet the requirement set out in Rule 8.07(c) because that person graduated from a law school not approved by the American Bar Association, located either in the United States or outside the United States, may request permission from the board to take the bar examination upon furnishing satisfactory evidence that the person:\n\n1. Has been admitted by examination to the bar and holds an active law license in another state or territory of the United States or in the District of Columbia and has engaged full-time in the practice of law in such state, territory, or the District of Columbia for at least three of the five years immediately preceding the date upon which the person initially submits an application to take the bar examination in Missouri; or2.

Has been admitted to practice law in the foreign country where his or her law degree was conferred and has been in good standing throughout the period of such admission and has engaged in the full-time practice of law outside the United States for a period of at least three of the five years preceding the date upon which the person initially submits an application to take the bar examination in Missouri; or2. Has been admitted to practice law in the foreign country where his or her law degree was conferred and has been in good standing throughout the period of such admission and has completed successfully, in their entirety, at least 24 semester credit hours in residence at a law school approved by the American Bar Association wholly within the three years preceding the date upon which the person initially submits an application to take the bar examination in Missouri; or3.Has been admitted to practice law in the foreign country where his or her law degree was conferred and has been in good standing throughout the period of such admission and has met all requirements for graduation with a Master of Laws degree from a law school approved by the American Bar Association.\n\n1. Applications are deemed \"properly filed\" when the prescribed fee is tendered in full, the electronic portion of the application and character and fitness application are submitted electronically, and the executed Authorization and Release form is uploaded or received by mail. Any portion of an application that is returned for postage or because it is improperly addressed will not be considered properly postmarked. If the filing deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline shall be the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.2. If the application is not substantially complete, as determined by the board, and is rejected for filing, the applicable increased late fee will be imposed if a complete application is not properly postmarked or received by the filing deadline.3. Upon written notice to the board received no later than 5:00 p.m. on the fourteenth day before the examination applied for, an applicant may postpone taking the examination applied for and carry forward the application fee one time to the next scheduled examination. The applicant shall pay a postponement fee as set out in the prescribed fee schedule, within 10 days of submitting written notice of postponement. Except for extraordinary circumstances and good cause shown, an applicant who does not submit timely written notice of postponement shall be required to pay the prescribed application fee in full in order to sit for any future examination. By allowing an applicant to postpone taking the examination, the board does not waive, alter, or extend any provisions of Rule 8.1. The \"practice of law\" is a term of art. Though no broad rule can be drawn to define the \"practice of law,\" it connotes more than merely working with legally related matters. The applicant bears the burden to prove he or she has been engaged in the full-time practice of law such that the applicant's professional experience and responsibilities are sufficient to satisfy the board that the applicant should be admitted under this Rule 8.10.2. An applicant's practice of law, including, but not limited to, practice under Rule 8.105 or Rule 8.06, within, or from an office located within, the State of Missouri will not, under any circumstances, be considered by the board in determining compliance with Rule 8.10(a)(4)(A), unless the applicant was lawfully engaged in full-time practice pursuant to a temporary license under Rule 8.106.3. An applicant must be able to demonstrate that he or she satisfies the requirements of this Rule 8.10 as of the date the application is submitted; practice after the date of application will not be considered.4. An applicant's candor in representing his or her eligibility under this Rule 8.10 will be considered by the Board as a part of its evaluation of the applicant's character and fitness.5. The term \"in-house counsel\" in Rule 8.10(a)(4)(D) means a person who is employed as a lawyer exclusively by a corporation or its subsidiaries or affiliates, an association, a business, or a governmental entity and the employer's business consists of activities other than the practice of law or the provision of legal services.(a)A lawyer admitted to the practice of law in another United States jurisdiction, or who is a foreign lawyer, may receive a limited license to practice law in this state if the lawyer:\n\n1.

In all other respects, the lawyer receiving a license pursuant to this Rule 8.105 shall be deemed a lawyer licensed to practice law in this state.(d)A limited license issued pursuant to this Rule 8.105 shall be automatically nullified if the lawyer's employment in this state by the employer qualifying under Rule 8.105(a)(1) is terminated or if the lawyer is no longer licensed to practice law in another United States or foreign jurisdiction as required by Rule 8.105(a).\n\nThe limited license shall be reinstated if a lawyer's employment is terminated and:\n\n1. Another employer qualifying under Rule 8.105(a)(1) immediately thereafter employs the lawyer, and2. The lawyer notifies the clerk of this Court of the new employer.\n\nA lawyer admitted pursuant to this Rule 8.105 is required to immediately notify the clerk of this Court of any change in the lawyer's employment or in the lawyer's licensure status in another United States or foreign jurisdiction.

Such entities shall report to the board, which may make such further investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself concerning the character and fitness of the applicant.\n\nThe board may have medical records or other documents reviewed by physicians or other professionals to obtain such professional’s expert opinion in cases involving a physical or mental impairment bearing upon an applicant's character and fitness or in cases involving bar examination testing accommodations. The expense of such review shall be borne by the board.\n\nIf necessary, in cases involving a physical or mental impairment bearing upon an applicant’s character and fitness or bearing upon bar examination testing accommodations, the board may request the applicant to undergo an independent evaluation or examination by a professional approved by the board.

Any member of the board may administer such oaths and affirmations.(g)The board may impose such conditions as it deems necessary upon its approval of an application for character and fitness report filed by an applicant as provided in Rule 8.05(b). Approval of an application may be conditioned upon successful completion of such programs or treatments required by the board for alcohol abuse, substance abuse, sexual misconduct, or management of emotional or mental problems or money management.

All such conditional approvals of applications and all such programs shall be limited to conditions involving areas that adversely affect the applicant's ability to responsibly further the public interest.(h)Violation of any condition imposed under Rule 8.11(g) shall be self-reported to the board by the applicant. Any material violation shall be prima facie basis for immediate revocation of conditional approval and for denial of permission to take the bar examination.(i)In addition to disclosure allowed by Rule 8.11(b), the board may, as reasonably necessary, disclose information relating to a specific applicant to:\n\n1. Sources contacted during the board's character and fitness investigation; and2. Lawyer disciplinary or admissions authorities in other jurisdictions when the information relates to possible unethical conduct by a lawyer licensed or a person applying for licensure to practice in that jurisdiction.\n\n(a)If the board refuses to grant approval of any application, the applicant may request a hearing by the board by notifying the executive director of the board in writing within 15 days after the board has provided written notice of refusal to the applicant.

A copy of the appeal shall be filed with the executive director of the board within 15 days after the board's decision is provided to the applicant.\n\nThe board, within 30 days after receipt of the notice of appeal, shall file with the clerk of this Court the original notice of appeal together with a statement of the board's action and position in the matter and, when evidence has been taken, shall order a transcript of such portions of the evidence as considered necessary by the board. A copy of the statement of the board and such transcript shall at the same time be served upon the applicant.\n\nThe applicant may, at applicant's own expense, file a transcript of any other portion of the evidence heard by the board as applicant considers necessary and serve a copy upon the executive director of the board.\n\nThis Court shall not hear or receive additional evidence.\n\n(e)This Court, on application of the board, may make such orders as it shall consider appropriate with regard to payment of or security for the costs and other expenses of hearings and appeals provided for herein."
