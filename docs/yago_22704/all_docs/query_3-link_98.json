The deed of alienation in fee simple of any person, of any lands, tenements or hereditaments shall have the same effect and operation for barring all estate tail and other interests in the lands, tenements or hereditaments, as such persons being a party cognizor to a fine in due manner levied, or party vouchee to a common recovery with a double voucher in due manner suffered, of the lands, tenements or hereditaments.

However, it is the policy of the State to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by encouraging the development and use of renewable resources and to remove obstacles thereto. Accordingly, reasonable restrictions on roof mounted systems for obtaining solar energy are those restrictions that do not significantly increase the cost of the system or significantly decrease its efficiency or specified performance, or that allow for an alternative system of comparable cost, efficiency, and energy conservation benefits.\n\n(d) This section shall not amend, nullify, or affect the enforceability of any conservation easement or historic preservation covenant.\n\n(e) (1) a. For purposes of this section, a property ownerâs vote under this subsection may be expressed as follows:\n\n1. An in-person vote at a meeting.\n\n2.

The input or direction provided by the maintenance corporation, homeownerâs association, or neighboring property owner on the placement of the roof mounted system for obtaining solar energy must be consistent with a reasonable restriction imposed under subsection (c) of this section.\n\n2. If the covenants, restrictions, or conditions governing the ownerâs property do not impose a reasonable restriction on a roof mounted system for obtaining solar energy, the input or direction provided by the maintenance corporation, homeownerâs association, or neighboring property owner on the placement of the system must be reasonable. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)a.2., âreasonableâ means input or direction that does not significantly increase the cost of the roof mounted system for obtaining solar energy or significantly decrease the systemâs efficiency or specified performance.\n\nb. The maintenance corporation, homeownerâs association, or neighboring property owner shall provide the input or direction required under this paragraph (f)(2) to the owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the mailing address provide under paragraph (f)(1)b. of this section.\n\nc.
