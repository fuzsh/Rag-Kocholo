The Bar of Indiana\n\nThe bar of this state shall consist of all attorneys in good standing who, prior to July 1, 1931, were duly admitted to practice law by the circuit courts of this state, and all attorneys in good standing who, subsequently thereto, have been or hereafter shall be admitted to practice by this court.\n\nRule 1.1. Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education\n\nThe Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education shall provide for the efficient management of the State Board of Law Examiners, the Indiana Commission for Continuing Legal Education, the registration of attorneys, and the Indiana roll of attorneys. The Supreme Court shall appoint the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education.\n\nRule 2. Registration and Fees\n\n(a) Name and Address. All attorneys in active or inactive good standing, duly admitted to the practice of law in the State of Indiana shall file with the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education, their correct name, office and residence address, office telephone number, electronic mail address, and county of residence; provided, however, such residence addresses and electronic mail addresses shall be confidential and excluded from public access. Said attorneys shall notify the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education of any change of address (including electronic mail address), change of telephone number, or change of name within thirty (30) days of such change. A notice of a change of name shall be accompanied by a copy of the court record or an affidavit that states the name change. The names and addresses so filed shall be effective for all notices involving licenses as attorneys and/or disciplinary matters, and a failure to file same shall be a waiver of notice involving licenses as attorneys and/or disciplinary matters. The Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education shall annually send a certified list of attorneys, together with their non-confidential addresses on file to the Indiana State Bar Association.\n\n(b) Annual Registration Fee--Active Attorneys. Except as provided in sections (c) or (d), each attorney who is a member of the bar of this Court on August 1 of each year shall, so long as the attorney is a member of the Bar of this Court, pay a registration fee of one hundred eighty dollars ($180.00) on or before October 1 of such year. A delinquent fee in the amount of one hundred thirty dollars ($130.00) shall be added to the registration fee for fees paid after October 1 and on or before October 15 of each year; a delinquent fee in the amount of one hundred eighty dollars ($180.00) shall be added to the registration fee for fees paid after October 15 and on or before December 31 of each year; and a delinquent fee in the amount of three hundred thirty dollars ($330.00) shall be added to the registration fee for fees paid after December 31 of each year. An attorney who has paid the registration fee under this subsection and any applicable delinquent fees and who is otherwise eligible to practice law in this state shall be considered to be in active good standing.\n\nAny attorney admitted to practice law in this State on a date subsequent to August 1 of each year shall, within ten (10) days of the date of his or her admission to the Bar of the Court, or by October 1 of said year, whichever date is later, pay a registration fee of one hundred eighty dollars ($180.00).\n\n(c) Annual Registration Fee--Inactive Attorneys. One-half (1/2) of the registration fee referred to in section (b) shall be required of an attorney who files with the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education, on or before October 1 of each year, an affidavit of inactivity, stating that he or she is currently in active good standing or wishes to retain inactive standing, and that he or she neither holds judicial office nor is engaged in the practice of law in this state, except for practice permitted under Rule 6.2 Section 2(c). A delinquent fee in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be added to the registration fee for fees paid after October 1 and on or before October 15 of each year; and a delinquent fee in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be added to the registration fee for fees paid after October 15 of each year. An attorney who has paid the registration fee under this section and any applicable delinquent fees shall be considered to be in inactive good standing. An inactive attorney shall promptly notify the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education of a desire to return to active status, and pay the applicable registration fee for the current year, prior to any act of practicing law.\n\n(d) Annual Registration Fee--Retired Attorneys. No registration fee shall be required of an attorney who files with the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education, by October 1 of any year, an affidavit of retirement, stating that he or she is currently in active or inactive good standing, neither holds judicial office nor is engaged in the practice of law in this state, and does not plan to return to the practice of law, except for practice permitted under Rule 6.2 Section 2(c). An affidavit of retirement, once filed, shall be effective for each succeeding year or until the attorney is reinstated pursuant to section (e).\n\n(e) Reinstatement of Retired Attorneys. In the event there is no basis for the suspension of the attorney’s license to practice law, a retired attorney’s privilege to practice law shall be reinstated upon submitting to the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education a written application for reinstatement and payment of:\n\n(1) the unpaid registration fee for the year of reinstatement;\n\n(2) registration fees, including delinquent fees, in the amount referred to in section (b) for each year of retirement; and\n\n(3) an administrative reinstatement fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00).\n\nThe Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education shall deposit the administrative reinstatement fee referred to in subsection (e)(3) into the “Attorney Services-Annual Fees” account, described in section (m).\n\n(f) IOLTA Certification. On or before October 1 of each year, every attorney admitted to practice law in this state shall certify to the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education of this Court that all client funds that are nominal in amount or to be held for a short period of time by the attorney so that they could not earn income for the client in excess of the costs incurred to secure such income are held in an IOLTA account (as that term is defined in Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.15(f)) of the attorney or law firm or that the attorney is exempt under the provisions of Prof. Cond. R. 1.15(g)(2). Any attorney who fails to make an IOLTA certification on or before October 1 of each year shall be assessed a delinquent fee according to the schedule set forth in section (b) if the attorney is active or section (c) if the attorney is inactive.\n\n(g) Annual Registration Notice. On or before August 1 of each year, the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education of this Court shall mail a notice to or notify via electronic mail each attorney then admitted to the bar of this Court who is in active or inactive good standing that: (i) a registration fee must be paid on or before October 1; and (ii) the certification required by section (f) of this rule and by Ind. Prof. Cond. R. 1.15(g) must be filed with the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education on or before October 1. The Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education shall also send such notice to the Clerk for each circuit and superior court in this State for posting in a prominent place in the courthouse, the Indiana State Bar Association, and such print and other media publishers of legal information as the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education reasonably determines appropriate. Provided, however, that the failure of the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education to send such notice will not mitigate the duty to pay the required fee and file the required certification.\n\n(h) Failure to Pay Registration Fee; Reinstatement. Any attorney who fails to pay a registration fee required under section (b) or (c) or fails to file the certification required by section (f) of this rule and by Ind.Prof. Cond. R. 1.15(g) shall be subject to suspension from the practice of law and sanctions for contempt of this Court in the event he or she thereafter engages in the practice of law in this State. In the event there is no basis for the continued suspension of the attorney's license to practice law, such an attorney's privilege to practice law shall be reinstated upon submitting to the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education a written application for reinstatement and payment of:\n\n(1) the applicable unpaid registration fee for the year of suspension;\n\n(2) any delinquent fees for the year of suspension due pursuant to section (b) or (c);\n\n(3) the applicable unpaid registration fee for the year of reinstatement, if different from the year of suspension;\n\n(4) a registration fee, including delinquent fees, in the amount referred to in section (c) for all intervening years of suspension;\n\n(5) an administrative reinstatement fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00); and\n\n(6) the certification required by section (f) of this rule.\n\nThe Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education shall deposit the administrative reinstatement fee referred to in subsection (h)(5) in to the “Attorney Services-Annual Fees” account, described in section (m).\n\n(i) Certification of Good Standing. The Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education shall issue a certificate of active good standing or inactive good standing approved by this Court to any attorney upon the receipt of the annual registration fee and any applicable delinquent fees referred to in sections (b) and (c), respectively. The certificate of active good standing shall include a statement to the effect that the lawyer has filed the certification required by section (f) of this rule.\n\n(j) Annual Continuing Education Fee -- Non-attorney Judges.\n\n(1) On or before August 1, of each year, the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education shall mail or electronically mail to each non-attorney judge a notice that an education fee of forty-five dollars ($45.00) must be paid on or before the first day of October. Failure to pay the education fee on or before October 1, will result in the imposition of a delinquency fee of forty-five dollars ($45.00).\n\n(2) Any non-attorney judge who fails to pay the education fee shall be subject to suspension from judicial office. A non-attorney judge may resume office upon written application, payment of unpaid education fees and payment of the delinquency fee set out in subsection (1).\n\n(k) Effective Dates.\n\n(1) The requirement in section (c) that inactive attorneys pay an annual registration fee shall apply to all inactive attorneys and shall be effective for the annual fee due on or before October 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any other provision in this rule, any inactive attorney who filed an affidavit of inactivity on or before October 1, 2001 and who, after suspension for nonpayment of the annual registration fee referred to in section (c), thereafter seeks reinstatement to active or inactive attorney status pursuant to section (h), shall not be required to pay unpaid registration or delinquent fees pursuant to (h)(4) for any year prior to October 1, 2002.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this rule, any attorney who, after suspension for nonpayment of the annual registration fee referred to in section (b), thereafter seeks reinstatement to active or inactive attorney status pursuant to section (h), shall not be required to pay unpaid registration or delinquent fees pursuant to section (h)(4) for any year prior to October 1, 2002.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision in this rule, any retired attorney who seeks reinstatement to active attorney status pursuant to section (e) shall not be required to pay unpaid registration or delinquent fees pursuant to (e)(2) for any year prior to October 1, 2002.\n\n(l) Affidavit of Permanent Withdrawal. An attorney in good standing, who is current in payment of all applicable registration fees and other financial obligations imposed by these rules, and who is not the subject of an investigation into, or a pending proceeding involving, allegations of misconduct, who desires to relinquish permanently his or her license to practice law in the State of Indiana may do so by tendering an Affidavit of Permanent Withdrawal from the practice of law in this State to the Executive Secretary of the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission. The Executive Secretary shall promptly verify the eligibility of the attorney to resign under this section, and if eligible, forward a certification of eligibility, together with the Affidavit of Permanent Withdrawal to the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education, and the Executive Director shall show on the roll of attorneys that the attorney's Indiana law license has been relinquished permanently and that the lawyer is no longer considered an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Indiana. An attorney who permanently withdraws under this section shall not be eligible for reinstatement under section (e) or (h), but may apply for admission under Admission and Discipline Rules 3 through 21. In the event the attorney is not eligible to permanently withdraw under this section, the Executive Secretary shall promptly notify the attorney of all reasons for ineligibility.\n\n(m) Deposit and Use of Funds.\n\n(1) Deposit of Funds.

Any court of the State of Indiana, in the exercise of discretion, may permit a member of the bar of another state or territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia, not admitted pursuant to Rule 21, to appear in a particular case or proceeding, only if the court before which the attorney wishes to appear or in the case of an administrative proceeding, the Supreme Court, determines that there is good cause for such appearance and that each of the following conditions is met:\n\n(1) A member of the bar of this state has appeared and agreed to act as co- counsel.\n\n(2) The attorney is not a resident of the state of Indiana, regularly employed in the state of Indiana, or regularly engaged in business or professional activities in the state of Indiana.\n\n(3) The attorney has made payment to the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education a case specific registration fee of $300, accompanied by a copy of the Verified Petition for Temporary Admission that the attorney intends to file pursuant to subdivision (4) below. Upon receipt of the registration fee and petition, the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education will issue a temporary admission attorney number and payment receipt to the attorney seeking admission. If the attorney's verified petition for temporary admission is thereafter denied, the registration fee shall not be refunded.\n\n(4) The attorney files a certificate of good standing issued within the previous thirty days by the highest court in each state in which the attorney is admitted to practice law and a verified petition, co-signed by co-counsel designated pursuant to subdivision (a)(1), setting forth:\n\n(i) The attorney's residential address, office address, office telephone number, electronic mail address, and the name and address of the attorney's law firm or employer, if applicable;\n\n(ii) All states or territories in which the attorney has ever been licensed to practice law, including the dates of admission to practice and any attorney registration numbers;\n\n(iii) That the attorney is currently a member in good standing in all jurisdictions listed in (ii);\n\n(iv) That the attorney has never been suspended, disbarred or resigned as a result of a disciplinary charge, investigation, or proceeding from the practice of law in any jurisdiction; or, if the attorney has been suspended, disbarred or resigned from the practice of law, the petition shall specify the jurisdiction, the charges, the address of the court and disciplinary authority which imposed the sanction, and the reasons why the court should grant temporary admission not withstanding prior acts of misconduct;\n\n(v) That no disciplinary proceeding is presently pending against the attorney in any jurisdiction; or, if any proceeding is pending, the petition shall specify the jurisdiction, the charges and the address of the disciplinary authority investigating the charges. An attorney admitted under this rule shall have a continuing obligation during the period of such admission promptly to advise the court of a disposition made of pending charges or the institution of new disciplinary proceedings;\n\n(vi) A list of all cases and proceedings, including caption and case number, in which the attorney has appeared in any court or administrative agency of this state during the last five (5) years by temporary admission.\n\n(vii) Absent good cause, repeated appearances by any person pursuant to this rule shall be cause for denial of the petition. A demonstration that good cause exists for the appearance shall include at least one of the following:\n\n(a) the cause in which the attorney seeks admission involves a complex field of law in which the attorney has special expertise,\n\n(b) there has been an attorney-client relationship with the client for an extended period of time,\n\n(c) there is a lack of local counsel with adequate expertise in the field involved,\n\n(d) the cause presents questions of law involving the law of the foreign jurisdiction in which the applicant is licensed, or\n\n(e) such other reason similar to those set forth in this subsection as would present good cause for the temporary admission.\n\n(viii) A statement that the attorney has read and will be bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct adopted by the Supreme Court, and that the attorney consents to the jurisdiction of the State of Indiana, the Indiana Supreme Court, and the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission to resolve any disciplinary matter that might arise as a result of the representation.\n\n(ix) A statement that the attorney has paid the registration fee to the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education in compliance with subdivision (a)(3) of this rule, together with a copy of the payment receipt and temporary admission attorney number issued by the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education pursuant to subdivision (3).\n\n(b) Responsibilities of Attorneys. Members of the bar of this state serving as co-counsel under this rule shall sign all briefs, papers and pleadings in the cause and shall be jointly responsible therefore. The signature of co-counsel constitutes a certificate that, to the best of co-counsel's knowledge, information and belief, there is good ground to support the signed document and that it is not interposed for delay or any other improper reason. Unless ordered by the trial court, local counsel need not be personally present at proceeding before the court.\n\n(c) Failure to Register, or Otherwise Perform as Required. Any foreign attorney who fails to register or pay the registration fee as required under subsection (a) shall be subject to discipline in this state. Members of the bar of this state serving as co-counsel under this rule shall be subject to discipline if the attorney admitted under this rule fails to pay the required fees or otherwise fails to satisfy the requirements of this rule.\n\nThe amendments apply only to requests for Temporary Admission on Petition filed on or after January 1, 2022.\n\nIf an attorney has been granted temporary admission status in a case prior to January 1, 2022, the attorney need not pay a renewal fee in that case. For cases initiated after January 1, 2022, an attorney must pay the temporary admission registration fee for each case.\n\nIf more than one (1) attorney from one firm is appearing pursuant to a Temporary Admission on Petition in a particular case or proceeding on behalf of the same client, each attorney appearing nevertheless has an individual obligation to comply with the Rule as amended.\n\nRule 4. Roll of Attorneys\n\nA record shall hereafter be made and entered on the order book of this court of the admission, enrollment, resignation, suspension, disbarment, reinstatement, and recertification of any and all members of the bar of this court. In addition, the Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Admissions and Continuing Education shall keep, and from time to time revise, a permanent electronic database of the members of the bar of this court who have been enrolled as such, showing the name, address, and date of admission of each living member.\n\nRule 5. Foreign Legal Consultants\n\n(1) General Regulation as to Licensing. In its discretion, the Supreme Court may license to practice in Indiana as a foreign legal consultant, without examination, an applicant who:\n\n(a) is a member in good standing of a recognized legal profession in a foreign country, the members of which are admitted to practice as attorneys or counselors at law or the equivalent and are subject to effective regulation and discipline by a duly constituted professional body or a public authority;\n\n(b) for at least five of the seven years immediately preceding his or her application has been a member in good standing of such legal profession and has actually been engaged in the practice of law in the said foreign country or elsewhere substantially involving or relating to the rendering of advice or the provision of legal services concerning the law of the said foreign country;\n\n(c) possesses the good moral character and general fitness requisite for a member of the bar of Indiana; and\n\n(d) intends to practice as a foreign legal consultant in Indiana and to maintain an office in this State for that purpose.\n\n(2) Proof Required. An applicant under this Rule shall file with the State Board of Law Examiners:\n\n(a) a certificate from the professional body or public authority in such foreign country having final jurisdiction over professional discipline, certifying as to the applicant's admission to practice and the date thereof, and as to his or her good standing as such attorney or counselor at law or the equivalent;\n\n(b) a letter of recommendation from one of the members of the executive body of such professional body or public authority or from one of the judges of the highest law court or court of original jurisdiction of such foreign country and a letter of recommendation from at least one attorney who is licensed to practice law in the State of Indiana other than as a foreign legal consultant;\n\n(c) a duly authenticated English translation of such certificate and such letter if, in either case, it is not in English;\n\n(d) the National Conference of Bar Examiners questionnaire and affidavit along with the payment of the requisite fee and such other evidence as to the applicant's educational and professional qualifications, good moral character and general fitness, and compliance with the requirements of Section 1 of this Rule as the State Board of Law Examiners may require;\n\n(e) a copy or summary of the law and customs of the foreign country that describes the opportunity afforded to members of the Bar of Indiana to establish offices for the giving of legal advice to clients in such foreign country, together with an authenticated English translation if it is not in English; and\n\n(f) the requisite documentation evidencing compliance with the immigration laws of the United States.\n\n(3) Reciprocal Treatment of Members of the Bar of Indiana. In considering whether to license an applicant to practice as a foreign legal consultant, the Supreme Court may in its discretion take into account whether a member of the bar of Indiana would have a reasonable and practical opportunity to establish an office for the giving of legal advice to clients in the applicant's country of admission. Any member of the bar who is seeking or has sought to establish an office in that country may request the court to consider the matter, or the Court may do so sua sponte.\n\n(4) Scope of Practice. A person licensed to practice as a foreign legal consultant under this Rule shall be limited to rendering professional legal advice on the law of the foreign country where the foreign legal consultant is admitted to practice.

The applicant must be at least 21 years of age and possess good moral character and fitness to practice law. The applicant shall have the burden of proving that he or she possesses the requisite good moral character and fitness to practice law.

There shall be appointed by this Court a Committee on Character and Fitness in each Supreme Court judicial district, consisting of at least one attorney-at-law from each county in such district. The members of such committee shall continue in office until their successors are appointed. The State Board of Law Examiners shall provide a copy of each application for admission to the bar of this state to the local member of the Committee on Character and Fitness in the Indiana county which the applicant selects. A member of the committee, or some member designated by the State Board of Law Examiners, shall require the personal attendance of each applicant before the member, and inquire into the question as to whether or not the applicant is possessed of those requisites of good moral character and fitness, has adequate knowledge of the standards and ideals of the profession, and is familiar with and agrees to be bound by the Indiana Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct, all as necessary to qualify him to serve as an attorney.

The committee member shall forward such findings and recommendations and all papers filed in connection therewith to the State Board of Law Examiners, which Board shall at its next meeting review said findings, make such further inquiry as it sees fit, and take such action as the matter requires.\n\nSection 5. The Board may, upon its own motion, require an applicant to appear before the full Board, or a committee composed of members of the Board, for inquiry into the applicant's character and fitness. The Board may continue such appearance and require that the applicant submit additional information, evaluations or proofs before concluding such appearance.\n\nSection 6. The Board of Law Examiners shall make a finding regarding each applicant:\n\n(a) That the applicant possesses the requisite good moral character and fitness and has satisfied the general qualifications to be eligible to be admitted to practice law in Indiana, subject to continued qualification; or\n\n(b) That the applicant has failed to sustain his or her burden of proof that the applicant possesses good moral character and fitness, and has satisfied all of the general qualifications to be admitted to the practice of law, in which case the Board may find that the applicant should not be permitted to reapply for admission to practice law or should be permitted to reapply only after a specific period of time; or\n\n(c) That the Board has special concerns about the proof of applicant's moral character and fitness based upon evidence of drug, alcohol, psychological or behavioral problems, but in lieu of denying admission to the bar finds that the applicant has satisfied the Board as to his or her character and fitness, and has also satisfied the general qualifications, sufficiently to be eligible for conditional admission upon such terms and conditions as specified by the Board, said conditional admission to be administered by the Board over a period of time not to exceed five (5) years. The conditional admission shall be governed by Internal Rules and Policies adopted by the Board. The fact that the admission is conditional shall be confidential; or\n\n(d) That the Board has special concerns about the proof of applicant's moral character and fitness based upon evidence of drug, alcohol, psychological or behavioral problems, but in lieu of denying admission to the bar finds that the applicant's admission be withheld for a specified period of time, not to exceed two (2) years, to allow the applicant to establish and prove rehabilitation. If at the end of the specified period of time the applicant shall have satisfied requirements to be eligible for admission to practice law, barring subsequent disclosure of matters adversely reflecting upon the applicant's character and fitness, the applicant will be eligible for admission upon passing the examination requirements. The Board may permit the applicant to take any examination administered during that period; or\n\n(e) That the Board has special concerns about the proof of applicant's moral character and fitness based upon evidence of drug, alcohol, psychological or behavioral problems, but in lieu of denying admission to the bar finds that the behavior giving rise to the special concern has occurred of such recent date to prevent the Board from determining whether the applicant has sufficiently established his or her qualifications and the Board extends the time for further inquiry for a reasonable time, not to exceed one (1) year, and the Board may permit the applicant to take any examination administered during that period.\n\nSection 7. If the Board finds that the applicant is not eligible for admission, or if the Board finds that an applicant is eligible for admission only upon condition under Section 6(c), whether after inquiry into the applicant's character and fitness to practice law, or determination that the applicant has failed to establish satisfaction of general qualifications, or in the case of an applicant for admission on foreign license, failure to prove that he or she has met the requirements of Rule 6, Sections 1 through 3, or if a conditional admittee has violated the terms of conditional admission, the applicant or conditional admittee may request a hearing under Section 9 of this Rule by filing a written request for such hearing with the Board within thirty (30) days of mailing of notice to the applicant of the finding of the Board.\n\nSection 8. The necessity of a hearing as provided in Section 9 of this Rule may be dispensed with by the Board where the evidence is not in dispute and the subject matter of the hearing may be submitted to the Supreme Court upon written findings and specifications adopted by the Board.\n\nSection 9. If the applicant or conditional admittee timely requests a hearing, or if the State Board of Law Examiners in connection with further inquiry shall deem it advisable to hold a hearing, the State Board of Law Examiners will schedule a hearing pursuant to the provisions of this Section.\n\n(a) In such event, the Board may appoint a hearing panel from the members of the Board, consisting of three members. Said panel shall select from among its members a presiding officer and shall schedule and conduct such hearing. All of the above rules and regulations with respect to the action of the Board shall apply at said hearing.\n\n(b) If, in connection with said further inquiry, the State Board of Law Examiners shall deem it advisable to hold a hearing, the applicant or conditional admittee shall be informed of the substance of the matter to be inquired into by written notice served on the applicant or conditional admittee by mailing such notice to the applicant or conditional admittee at such person's last known address as shown by the Board's record by certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten (10) days before the date set for said hearing.\n\n(c) A record of the proceedings shall be taken by electronic recording equipment provided by the Board. If necessary this record shall be transcribed by the staff of the Executive Director.\n\n(d) The panel shall report its findings to the Board for consideration and decision.\n\n(e) The State Board of Law Examiners, at any such hearing, or otherwise, shall have the power to administer oaths, to issue subpoenas to require attendance at said hearing and for the production of documentary or other evidence. In case of the refusal of a witness to attend said hearing, to produce documentary or other evidence or to testify, the said Board shall certify such failure to the Court, and such witness shall be dealt with as for a contempt. Witnesses shall receive the fees and mileage provided by law for witnesses in civil cases. The Board may employ outside legal counsel to represent the interest of the State of Indiana at such hearing.\n\n(f) The applicant or conditional admittee shall have the right to attend such hearing in person, to examine and cross-examine witnesses and otherwise participate in said hearing and to require the attendance of witnesses and production of documentary and other evidence by subpoena. An applicant or conditional admittee may be represented by counsel at such person's expense.\n\n(g) Upon the conclusion of said hearing, the State Board of Law Examiners shall enter findings as provided in Section 6 (a) through (e) of this Rule.\n\n(h) In the event the Board makes a finding other than that the applicant or conditional admittee does possess good moral character and fitness and has satisfied the general qualifications to be admitted to practice as provided in Section 6 (a) of this Rule, a final report of the proceedings, including specific findings of fact, conclusion and recommendations shall be prepared. The Board shall notify the applicant or conditional admittee and all counsel of record of the action of the Board, including with such notice a copy of the final report.\n\nSection 10. If, after following the hearing procedures in Section 5, 8 & 9 of this Rule, the Board determines that a conditional admittee has violated any of the conditions of the admission, or if the Board determines that any applicant admitted under these rules falsified or failed to fully inform the Board of facts bearing upon the applicant's character and fitness and general qualifications to practice law prior to admission, the Board may impose additional conditions, including without limitation, an additional term of conditional admission for up to five (5) years, or the Board may certify such findings to the Supreme Court of Indiana with the recommendation that the Court revoke such admission, along with a recommended period of time before the conditional admittee can submit a new application for admission. A conditional admittee whose conditional admission has been revoked by the Supreme Court shall not be readmitted, except upon a new application and examination, after the expiration of the revocation period set by order of the Supreme Court.\n\nRule 13.

Each applicant for admission to the Indiana bar by written examination must establish to the satisfaction of the State Board of Law Examiners that the applicant:\n\n(a) Has obtained a JD degree (or its equivalent) from a law school located in the United States that at the time of the applicant’s graduation was on the approved list of the Council of Legal Education and Admission to the Bar of the American Bar Association. (The Indiana Supreme Court reserves the right to disapprove any school regardless of ABA approval.);\n\n(b) Has satisfactorily completed the law course required for graduation and furnishes to the Board a certificate from the dean of the law school (or the dean’s designee) that the applicant will receive a JD degree (or its equivalent) as a matter of course at a future date, pursuant to Rule 15; and\n\n(c) Has completed two cumulative semester hours of legal ethics or professional responsibility in law school.\n\nSection 2. Early Examination Rule. An applicant, who has fewer than five hours to complete and is within one-hundred days of graduating from an ABA-approved law school, has satisfactorily passed work in the subject matter as set forth in Section 1, and has otherwise completed all requirements for admission to the bar, may take the examination but may not be admitted to the Indiana bar until the applicant has met all other requirements for admission and has graduated from an ABA-approved law school.\n\nSection 3. Certification of Educational Qualifications. The law school dean (or the dean’s designee) shall certify an applicant’s completion of the subject-matter requirements under this rule and must file such certification with the Board at least twenty days before the examination.\n\nSection 4. Waiver of Educational Qualification. The Board may in its discretion waive the requirement in Section 1(a) for an applicant who (1) has graduated from a law school located in the United States that is not approved by the ABA, was eligible upon graduation from that law school to take the bar examination of another state, and the Board finds is qualified by reason of education or experience to take the Indiana bar examination; or (2) has completed legal education in a jurisdiction outside the United States, has obtained a graduate degree from an ABA-approved law school in a program based on American law, and the Board finds is qualified by reason of education or experience to take the Indiana bar examination.\n\nApplicants seeking a waiver under this section must petition the Board by letter and provide the Board with the following materials:\n\n(a) Official transcripts from each undergraduate college or university the applicant attended, reflecting all courses taken, the grade for each course, the number of semester hours of credit earned, and the degree(s) awarded, if any.\n\n(b) Official transcripts from each law school the applicant attended, reflecting all courses taken, the grade for each course, the number of semester hours of credit earned, and the degree(s) awarded, if any.\n\n(c) A narrative statement that includes a description of the applicant’s legal education and training, a description of the applicant’s work history, and reasons why the applicant believes a waiver is warranted.\n\n(d) Bar examination results—number of graduates from the applicant’s law school(s) who passed/failed, classified by state administering the exam, for the previous three years.\n\n(e) A statement of whether the applicant has applied to take the bar exam in any other jurisdiction and the result of that request, and the result of any bar examination taken by the applicant.\n\n(f) For applicants who have completed legal education outside the United States, a description of that country’s legal system, including, but not limited to, whether the English common law substantially forms the basis of that country’s jurisprudence and whether English is the language of instruction and practice in the courts of that jurisdiction.\n\n(g) Any other documentation, material, or information the applicant believes is relevant to establish the applicant is qualified by reason of education or experience to take the Indiana bar examination.\n\nAny document submitted to the Board that is not in the English language must be translated into English. The Board may request additional information or material as it deems appropriate, and no material submitted to the Board will be returned to the applicant. The Board should grant a waiver when doing so would be in the public interest after balancing all relevant factors including the applicant’s educational history and achievement, work history and achievement, bar exam results from other jurisdictions, desire to practice law in Indiana, and familiarity with the American legal system. The Board’s decision is subject to final approval by the Court.\n\nRule 14. Review\n\nSection 1. Before the release of the results of the Indiana bar examination, the Board of Law Examiners shall review the written answers of all applicants who are within five (5) points of achieving a passing score of 264 on the examination to confirm that the written answers have been graded correctly.
