        "text": "Misc. Notes\n\nJaime, Prince of Aragon & Valencia, or Jaime de Aragon y Entenza, was the son of Alfonso IV, King of AragÃ³n, and Teresa de Entenza y Antillon, and is also known as Jaime Cabrera. He was born in Zaragoza, in 1320, and inherited the title of XVII Conde [Count] de Urgel at the death of his mother in 1327. He became Vizconde [Viscount] de Ager on May 15, 1328.\n\nWhen Jaime was about 15, which would have been in about 1335, he had an affair with a doncella [maiden], descended from Elvira de Zayas, who was of an old and distinguished family from the city of Calatayud in AragÃ³n. The result of this affair was an illegitimate daughter, whose name we don't know. This same source mentions a son, Luis Cabrera, but doesn't say who his mother was.\n\nJaime's father died in 1336, and Jaime's older brother, Pedro succeeded to the throne, while Jaime became gobernador general del reino [governor-general of the kingdom], a position usually occupied by the heir to the throne. In 1336, too, Jaime, now 16, married Cecilia de Comenges, or Cecile de Comminges, in Catalonia. She was born in about 1321, in Comminges, France, the daughter of Juan Bernardo de Comenges, count of Comenges and viscount of Tours, and his wife, Matea. Jaime and Cecilia had two children, Pedro and Isabel de AragÃ³n y Comenges.\n\nIn 1347, Pedro, who had as yet no male heir, illegally named his daughter Constanza heir to the throne, in place of his brother Jaime,the rightful heir, whom Pedro disliked and distrusted.\n\nJaime gathered a strong party of supporters in Valencia. Pedro, becoming aware of this, ordered him to resign his office and to withdraw from Valencia, forbidding him to appear in any other large town, such as Zaragoza, Barcelona or LÃ©rida, and assigning to him as a residence the villa of Montblanc. He dismissed the officials whom Jaime, by virtue of his office, had appointed, and replaced them with men devoted to himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Jaime had gone to Fuentes de Ebro, not far from Zaragoza, and invited the barons and knights to join him, to abandon all personal quarrels and to unite in defense of the legal succession to the throne. He then led them to Zaragoza, invited the Princes Ferdinand and John, his half brothers, whom Pedro's animosity had driven into Castile, to join him, and sent out a general call to activate a 'union' in defense of the laws and privileges of the kingdom.\n\nThe movement in AragÃ³n steadily increased in numbers and Pedro was invited to Zaragoza to meet with its leaders. He delayed for sometime and did his best to strengthen the number of his own adherents, but when it became clear that he was completely outnumbered, he went to Zaragoza, where he found the Princes Ferdinand and John, who were supported by 400 Castilian knights. He also found, to his considerable alarm, that Valencia had joined AragÃ³n and were preparing for war if they failed to secure their demands.\n\nPedro made a speech in which he agreed to recognize the 'union' and to grant all of its demands, while, at the same time, his supporters were rallying the royalists [those still loyal to the king] in Zaragoza itself, promising high positions to those who would help defeat the 'union' and playing on the fears of those who were concerned by thepresence of Ferdinand and John, and their Castilian knights. Pedro's real plan was to satisfy the 'union' until he could return to Catalonia, which had remained loyal, and where he supposed he could raise additional support. All this was meant to remain a secret but at the final meeting between the 'union' leaders and Pedro, he provoked a bitter quarrel between himself and his brother, Jaime, whom he accused of treachery to the kingdom. When the supporters of Jaime raised a general call to arms, Pedro's supporters were forced to reveal themselves in order to escort the king safely away from the meeting.\n\nBefore he left Zaragoza, Pedro again agreed to grant the demands of the 'union', and to restore his brother to his office, and to revoke the succession of Constanza to the throne. He returned to Catalonia at the end of October, 1347, and began to gather an army to attack the 'union', whose hostility was not decreased by the fact that his brother, Jaime, suddenly died of a mysterious disease, which was naturally attributed to poison. While convincing evidence is lacking, there is no doubt that popular sentiment accused Pedro of fratricide, and that no serious attempt has since been made to refute this accusation.\n\nJaime died on November 15, 1347, in Barcelona, and was buried in the Monasterio de San Francisco, near the altar to San Nicolas, which is the high altar of that church. His body was then moved to Balaguer, as he had requested before he died, but was later returned to the Monasterio de San Francisco, this time, to the chapel of Santa Elisabet where his body lay with other members of the royal family of AragÃ³n. Cecilia died on June 16, 1381, or in 1384, and was buried in the church of Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Almata in the city of Balaguer.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChildren of Jaime, Prince of AragÃ³n, and ??? ???:\n\ni ??? de Aragon [13th great grandmother of Perucho]\n\nii Luis Cabrera, Conde de AragÃ³n, also appears as a son of Jaime but we don't know the name of his mother. Luis Cabrera married Elvira Ponce de Leon.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChildren of Jaime, Prince of AragÃ³n, and Cecilia de Comenges:\n\niii Pedro de Aragon Urgel, Conde de Urgel, was born in 1337, or in 1340, and in 1363, married Beatrix de Cardona, daughter of Conde Hugo de Cardona and Blanca de Ampurias, in Cardona. Beatrix died in 1372, and, in 1375, Pedro married Margherita Palaiologina, SeÃ±ora d'Acqui, the daughter of Isabel de AragÃ³n, Pedro's first cousin, and Giovanni Palaiologos, Marquis de Monferrato. Another source says the father of Margherita was John II, Margrave [Lord] de Montferrat. Pedro and Margherita had eight children, Antonio, Jaime, Pedro, Juan, Beatriz, Leonor, Cecilia, and Isabel de Urgel. Pedro died in June 1408, in Balaguer. Margherita died in 1420, in Morella.\n\niv Isabel de Aragon Urgel married Hugo Folch, Conde de Cardona, who died in 1400."
