        "text": "TRENTON – Married detectives with the New Jersey State Police today agreed to forfeit their jobs to resolve charges that they filed false reports about their conduct during a physical altercation in a bar in North Wildwood, N.J., in February 2020.\n\nAs part of a negotiated resolution with the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability (OPIA), Detective Sgt. 1st Class Gregory Ogden, 52, and Detective Sgt. Dorothy Ogden, 46, both of Hammonton, N.J., today entered consent orders in which they agreed to forfeit their positions with the New Jersey State Police and be permanently barred from public office and public employment in New Jersey. During an appearance today before Superior Court Judge Peter E. Warshaw in Mercer County, the couple also waived indictment and agreed to be charged by accusation with fourth-degree falsifying or tampering with records. They previously were charged by complaint-summons with that offense. Under the resolution, the state agreed that it would not oppose the couple’s application to the Pre-Trial Intervention (PTI) program, and the judge today admitted the couple into PTI. If they successfully complete the program, the criminal charge against them will be dismissed.\n\nThe New Jersey State Police Office of Professional Standards initially investigated this matter and referred it to the OPIA Corruption Bureau.\n\nOn Feb. 22, 2020, the Ogdens were at the Exit 6 Bar in North Wildwood when they were involved in a physical altercation with other patrons, during which Gregory was struck in the head with a bottle. The incident resulted in the North Wildwood Police Department responding to an aggravated assault complaint. The couple failed to immediately notify their chain of command in the New Jersey State Police as required. Instead, they waited two days and then allegedly submitted official New Jersey State Police Special Reports, dated Feb. 24, 2020, that falsely described what had occurred, particularly their conduct during the incident, as revealed by video footage and other evidence.\n\nThe case was prosecuted by Deputy Attorney General Brian Uzdavinis of the OPIA Corruption Bureau, under the supervision of Bureau Chief Peter Lee and OPIA Deputy Director Anthony Picione.\n\nActing Attorney General Bruck thanked the New Jersey State Police Office of Professional Standards for their investigation and referral.\n\nDefense Attorneys\n\nFor Gregory Ogden: Robert A. Ebberup, Esq., Toms River, N.J.\n\nFor Dorothy Ogden: Katherine D. Hartman, Esq., Moorestown N.J.\n\n###"
