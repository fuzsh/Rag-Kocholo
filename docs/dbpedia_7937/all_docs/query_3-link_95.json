        "meta_description": "In 2023, more than 158,000 Pennsylvanian families saved more than $267 million on clean energy and energy efficiency investmentsWASHINGTON – Today, in advance of the two-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) released new data from the IRS and new analysis by the Office of Economic Policy showing that more than 158,000 Pennsylvanian families benefitted from more than $267 million in tax credits to lower the costs of clean energy and energy efficiency upgrades to their homes during 2023. Today’s announcement marks the first public release of data from 2023 tax filings showing the benefit of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax incentives for consumers.  Nationwide, the number of families benefiting from these expanded credits for investments that lower their utility bills increased almost one third compared to tax year 2021, prior to passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, and the aggregate value of the credits increased by almost two thirds. The new data shows the Inflation Reduction Act is achieving its goal to lower both the upfront cost of clean energy and energy efficiency investments and monthly utility bills for American families. In addition to upfront cost savings on home improvements, consumers will save on their energy bills for years to come. Recent research from U.S. national labs and analysis from Treasury’s Office of Economic Policy shows that after consumers adopt these upgrades, they can save hundreds or thousands of dollars per year on their utility bills, depending on the upgrades made to their homes. For example, household installing residential solar have saved a median of $2,230 annually, and households that install efficient heat pumps and improve building efficiency are expected to save up to $600, $1,200, or $3,100 per year, based on the type of heating and cooling system that is being replaced.“The Biden-Harris Administration’s top economic priority is lowering costs for American families, and the Inflation Reduction Act is advancing that goal by making home energy upgrades more affordable and cutting monthly utility bills,” said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “The law has lowered the cost of clean energy upgrades for more than 158,000 Pennsylvanian families, saving them hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars annually on their utility bills for many years to come.” “Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, Pennsylvania is experiencing a clean energy and manufacturing boom and Pennsylvanians are spending less on their prescription drugs, taxes, and more. This legislation invests in American industry, creates good jobs for Pennsylvanians, and ensures that the Commonwealth continues to power the Nation,” said Senator Bob Casey. “Pennsylvania communities and families are feeling the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act and I will keep fighting for critical investments in our Commonwealth.”“The Inflation Reduction Act serves as one of the most significant investments our country has ever made to advance the environmental industry, save families money, and create good-paying jobs,” said Representative Matt Cartwright (PA-08). “This historic legislation also provides incentives for firms to locate the next generation of renewable energy manufacturing in Northeast Pennsylvania, an area whose history was fueled by coal and is now poised for the next generation of manufacturing.”“As we mark the second anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, its impact on Pennsylvania is undeniable. In fact, its impact on Chester and Berks Counties is firsthand evidence of its success,” said Representative Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06). “This generational investment continues to yield dividends across southeastern Pennsylvania, benefiting small business owners, seniors, and farmers alike. Just last month, I welcomed the Biden-Harris Administration to our community to talk about how the Inflation Reduction Act is boosting our agricultural economy – and that’s just one part of this historic legislation. By capping the cost of prescription drugs, reducing energy costs, creating new manufacturing jobs, and securing a cleaner future, this legislation fulfills our promise to combat climate change and build stronger communities.

This credit helps families afford investments in solar electricity generation, solar water heating, and battery storage, among others.
