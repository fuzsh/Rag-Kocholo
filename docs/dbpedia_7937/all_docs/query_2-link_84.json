        "text": "Meet the Mets\n\nThe Mets were off yesterday, but they’re set to begin a wild ten-game road trip that will see them play three games in Anaheim, one in St. Louis, three in Denver, and three in Seattle.\n\nLaura Albanese writes that the road trip could shape the rest of the Mets’ season.\n\nWill Sammon and Tim Britton wrote aboute rival teams’ perception of the Mets’ trade deadline.\n\nAnthony Rieber wonders which Mets legend will be the next to have his number retired.\n\nFrancisco Lindor is the Mets’ 2024 Heart and Hustle winner.\n\nAround the National League East\n\nThe Braves beat the Marlins, gaining a half-game on the Mets in the Wild Card standings in the process.\n\nAround Major League Baseball\n\nMike Trout suffered another meniscus tear and is done for the season, which ends with just 29 games played—a new single-season low for him as he’s spent far more time on the injured list than on the field since the beginning of the 2021 season.\n\nSonny Gray was great, but the Cardinals blew a two-run lead in the bottom of the ninth as the Cubs scored three runs for a walk-off win over them.\n\nAs you might have noticed when the Mets completed a season sweep of them recently, the Yankees are getting a ton of offense from Juan Soto and Aaron Judge—but not much from everyone else.\n\nWith about one-third of the season remaining, here’s what it means to be in first place at this juncture. And here are some updated power rankings following the trade deadline.\n\nMajor League Baseball announced its postseason schedule and has included some very sensible flexibility in it.\n\nTrevor Rogers didn’t fare well in his first start with the Orioles as the team was trounced by the Guardians.\n\nThe Royals defeated the Tigers rather easily.\n\nIn a game featuring two of the teams the Mets will play on this road trip, the Rockies beat the Angels.\n\nYesterday at Amazin’ Avenue\n\nLukas Vlahos took a deep dive in grading the Mets’ moves at the trade deadline.\n\nThis Date in Mets History"
