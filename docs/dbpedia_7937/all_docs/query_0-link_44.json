        "text": "Hello all.\n\nI was actually browsing weather.com, finished there, bored, moved on, on again, and somehow I ended up looking at a map of US time zones.\n\nUnless I'm reading it wrong, various states are split with a timezone line. A small corner of Texas for example seems to be on a different time to the rest of the state. Others like South Dakota seem to be split down the middle. Also, for no apparent reason there is a small section of Oregon that seems to be on Mountain time.\n\nWhat's that all about? Doesn't that get confusing and/or annoying for the people that live near the line? :thinking:\n\nI always assumed that US time zones were divided down state lines.\n\nSo, do any of you live just near these lines that split states?\n\nDo you leave for work at 8.30am and arrive there at 8am?\n\nSeems odd but I suppose you get used to it.\n\nPerhaps more confusing are the states that don't use Daylight Saving (sometimes called Summer Time). Arizona is in the Mountain Time zone, but because it doesn't use Daylight Savings Time, half the year it is on California Time. Just to add confusion, the Navajo Reservation in North East Arizona does use Daylight Saving time, while the rest of the state does not.\n\nPortions of Indiana didn't use Daylight Saving Time until recently (2006).\n\nHawaii doesn't use it either, but they aren't in the same time zone as anyone else anyway.\n\nI grew up in W OH, not that far from the IN border. The time zones lines and \"partials\" were an attempt to join together regional communities that tended to share work and life hours. That being said, the slightly ackward time zones, shifting or not with DST, etc, didn't matter that much as a kid.\n\nOnce I grew up and saw the impact DST can have on a networked database interfacing to, and tracking time sensitive processes that are running during a DST time change, the impact hit home. :thumbsdow I don't write code, but I have sat through plenty of meetings with customers that had to deal with this.\n\nSlightly off the original topic, but I would be happy to see us stop shifting the time each spring and fall - just leave mother earth to its natural cycle.\n\nI grew up in W OH, not that far from the IN border.

She just moves on no matter if we get up an hour later during summer or not. I personally like the DST since I get see more daylight after work. Even though it might sound strange for a flashaholic :shakehead\n\nEric\n\nIn Hawaii, we don't adjust our clocks, and as mentioned earlier, have our own little timezone. No confusion here. However, not everyone understands that Hawaii is not a part of the Pacific time zone. We would periodically get calls at 5 a.m. on the weekends from telemarketers or pollsters calling from the east coast which is 6 hours ahead.\n\nI used to work for a company that worked in MANY time zones, 24x7. We had a very simple way - EVERYTHING in the database was in UTC. Even though almost everything in the company was translated to NY time (as that's were 90% of the work was done), we just did everything behind the scenes in UTC, and just did the appropriate conversions on the fly\n\nDST saves GJ of energy yearly due to reduced light and A/C use. Mother earth's natural cycle certainly appreciates that.\n\nHi Luke. I work from my home, and start at 5am each day, so there is no A/C or power savings benefit for me one way or the other. If DST saves so much energy, then lets just stay on that version and stop the switching.\n\nSimilar to was.lost, I work with a firm in Germany a lot, and right now, we are shifted from normal. For me, its actually better right now as there is more time zone overlap than before the switch."
