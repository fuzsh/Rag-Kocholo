        "text": "PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A Flood Watch has been issued for parts of our area Sunday for heavy downpours that can lead to localized flooding.\n\nSUNDAY: This looks to be our most active day of the next seven days. We'll have a few rounds of downpours and thunderstorms. It's tropically humid all day, but it looks like the bulk of the thunderstorms and heavy rain threat will hold off until the afternoon and evening. Storms can produce gusty winds, but we're most concerned about the threat for localized flooding, high 82.\n\nMONDAY: A few spotty showers and storms late in the day, high 84.\n\nTUESDAY: A leftover morning shower is possible. Otherwise, it's partly sunny and we're turning less humid, high 76.\n\nWEDNESDAY: Mostly sunny and pleasant, high 77.\n\nTHURSDAY: Another beautiful day with plenty of sun, high 79.\n\nFRIDAY: Sunny and seasonable, high 84.\n\nSATURDAY: Turning warmer under mostly sunny skies, high 88."
