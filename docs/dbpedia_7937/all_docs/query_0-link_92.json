        "text": "Tropical Storm Debby is slowly moving northeast off the South Carolina coast, after leaving six dead in Florida.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is expecting the storm to strengthen throughout the day and into tonight.\n\nWatches and warnings are in effect along the Carolinas as the storm surge is threatening the possibility of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the coastline over the next 48 hours. Tropical storm warnings are still in effect with sustained winds at 45mph and higher gusts.\n\nWhere is Debby headed next?\n\nDebby is expected to turn toward the north and north-west today, but then a faster motion toward the north and northeast across the Mid-Atlantic region is expected Thursday and Friday.\n\nWhat is timeline of impacts to the Northeast?\n\nThe National Weather Service forecasts that Debby will approach the region, or Pennsylvania by Friday evening and then is expected to accelerate to the Northeast with time, although calling for the heaviest rains to occur to the west.\n\nThe entire region of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania is still expected to get excessive rainfall leading to flooding concerns Thursday into Friday.\n\nNorthwest of the I-95 corridor, including portions of Carbon and Monroe counties in Pennsylvania, are expected to get an additional 2-4 inches of rain with locally higher amounts exceeding 5inches between Thursday into Friday, according the NWS.\n\nWith the grounds already very saturated, and rivers, creeks and streams running high, flood watches are to be expected.\n\nNWS forecasts that Debby could bring 30-40 mph gusts to high elevations and areas near the coastline, and warns that isolated tornados are possible.\n\nThere is a gale warning off the entire coast of New Jersey."
