Thunderstorms associated with marginally severe wind gusts will be possible on Monday over the eastern half of North Carolina into the Mid-Atlantic, and from far east Texas into Louisiana. Isolated severe wind gusts and hail may occur from parts of the central and northern High Plains into the northern Rockies. ...North Carolina/Mid-Atlantic... An upper-level trough will move across the eastern U.S. on Monday, as an associated cold front advances eastward into the coastal areas of the middle Atlantic Seaboard. Along and ahead of the front, surface dewpoints are forecast to be in the lower 70s F. This will result in weak instability by early afternoon near the coast from North Carolina into the Mid-Atlantic. Surface heating and increasing low-level convergence along the front will enable thunderstorms to form during the afternoon. Additional storms are forecast to develop in the post-frontal airmass. In most areas, forecast soundings suggest that 0-6 km shear will be around 30 knots with 0-3 km lapse rates peaking in the 7 to 7.5 C/km range. This could be enough for isolated severe wind gusts associated with the stronger multicells during the mid to late aftennnoon. ...Far East Texas/Louisiana... North-northwesterly mid-level flow will be in place on Monday over much of the central U.S. At the surface, a cold front will be located across the Red River and Sabine River Valleys. Surface dewpoints are forecast to be in the lower 70s F from east Texas into western and central Louisiana. This will contribute to a narrow corridor of moderate instability by afternoon. Isolated thunderstorms may form along and to the east of this axis of instability with storms moving south-southeastward toward the Gulf Coast during the mid to late afternoon. A consensus of model forecasts at this time in the Sabine River Valley Monday currently have MLCAPE peaking in the 2000 to 3000 J/kg range, with 0-6 km shear near 30 knots. This would support an isolated severe threat, with a potential for marginally severe wind gusts. ...Central and Northern High Plains/Northern Rockies... An upper-level ridge is forecast to move eastward across the central and northern High Plains on Monday. To the west of the ridge, an axis of moderate instability will be in place by afternoon from eastern Colorado northward into the western Dakotas and eastern Montana. As surface temperatures warm during the day, convection will likely form in the higher terrain. Additional more isolated storms may develop in the lower elevations. Forecast soundings along and near the instability axis by mid to late afternoon have MLCAPE peaking in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range, with 0-3 km lapse rates becoming very steep. This, combined with relatively large surface temperature-dewpoint spreads should be favorable for high-based storms associated with isolated severe wind gusts. Hail will also be possible with the stronger cores. ..Broyles.. 08/18/2024 CLICK TO GET WUUS02 PTSDY2 PRODUCT NOTE: THE NEXT DAY 2 OUTLOOK IS SCHEDULED BY 1730Z"
