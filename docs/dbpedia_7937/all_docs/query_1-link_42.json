        "text": "Time Zones\n\nA time zone is one among the 24 spherical lunes, which is a section on the globe in a north/south direction having equal width, each assigned with one of the 24 hours.\n\nEvery section observes a uniform standard time to keep track of the day and night cycle. It means that in each geographic region within a time zone, people use the same time.\n\nAll these zones are defined by the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by a number of hours centered on the prime meridian.\n\nThe U.S. Time Zones\n\nThe below map depicts the six time zones of the United States and the actual time in the different time zones.\n\nIt is given from West to East:\n\nHawaii-Aleutian Time (HAT)\n\nHawaii-Aleutian Standard Time – HAST (UTC-10)\n\nHawaii-Aleutian Daylight Time – HADT (UTC-9)\n\nAlaska Time (AST)\n\nAlaska Standard Time – AKST (UTC-9)\n\nAlaska Daylight Time – AKDT (UTC-8)\n\nPacific Time (PT)\n\nPacific Standard Time – PST (UTC-8)\n\nPacific Daylight Time – PDT (UTC-7)\n\nMountain Time (MT)\n\nMountain Standard Time – MST (UTC-7)\n\nMountain Daylight Time – MDT (UTC-6)\n\nCentral Time (CT)\n\nCentral Standard Time – CST (UTC-6)\n\nCentral Daylight Time – CDT (UTC-5)\n\nEastern Time (ET)\n\nEastern Standard Time – EST (UTC-5)\n\nEastern Daylight Time – EDT (UTC-4)\n\nWhile the below states lie in two time zones:\n\nThe U.S. Weather Divisions\n\nIn the U.S., there are 344 climate divisions that are based on the CONUS (Continental US). For every climatic division, monthly station temperature and precipitation values are computed from the daily observations.\n\nThe divisional values are weighted by area to compute state-wide values, and the state-wide values are weighted by area to compute regional values.\n\nThe U.S. is typically grouped into five regions: The Northeast, the Southwest, the West, the Southeast, and the Midwest. USA climate varies dramatically by region.\n\nThe area could be split even further into three types of climate: coastal Mediterranean climates, Desert climates, and Mountainous alpine climates. In all three of these areas, summers are hot and dry.\n\nThere Are 4 Major Climate Zones:\n\nTropical zone from 0°–23.5° (between the tropics)\n\nSubtropics from 23.5°–40°\n\nTemperate zone from 40°–60°\n\nCold zone from 60°–90°\n\nThe Six Major Climate Regions Are Polar, Temperate, Arid, Tropical, Mediterranean and Tundra.\n\nPolar Chill. Polar climates are very cold and dry throughout the year. …\n\nTemperate Regions\n\nArid Zones\n\nDamp Tropical Regions\n\nThe Mild Mediterranean\n\nThe Cold Tundra\n\nSome people prefer to have all four seasons – fall, winter, spring and summer – and all of the weather that comes with each.\n\nList of States in the U.S. With the Best Weather Conditions:\n\nCalifornia\n\nHawaii\n\nTexas\n\nArizona\n\nFlorida\n\nGeorgia\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nDelaware\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nLouisiana"
