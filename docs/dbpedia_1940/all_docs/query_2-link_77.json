This document provides an introduction to the laws governing intestate and testamentary succession in India. It notes that there is no uniform succession law in India, as different religious communities, regions, and tribes follow diverse personal laws. The Indian Succession Act of 1865 aimed to unify succession laws but failed due to incorporating principles foreign to Indian culture. As a result, succession laws continue to be governed by religious laws as well as later laws introduced by British, French, and Portuguese rulers. The key personal laws governing succession for Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsis, Jews, and tribal communities are discussed.",
