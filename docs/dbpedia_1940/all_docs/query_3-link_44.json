        "text": "Here is a short commentary on the story of Mithila and some key landmarks\n\nMithila comprises certain parts of Bihar and Jharkhand of India and adjoining districts of the eastern Terai of Nepal. The native language in Mithila is Maithili. The name Mithila is commonly used to refer to the Videha Kingdom, as well as to the modern-day territories that fall within the ancient boundaries of Videha.\n\nMithila first gained prominence after being settled by Indo-Aryan peoples who established the Videha kingdom. During the Later Vedic period (c. 1100–500 BCE), Videha became one of the major political and cultural centers of Ancient India, along with Kuru and Panchala. The kings of the Videha Kingdom were called Janakas.\n\nFrom the 11th century to the 20th century, Mithila was ruled by the Karnatas, the Oiniwar Dynasty and the Khandwala Dynasty a.k.a. Raj Darbhanga. The rulers of the Oiniwar Dynasty and the Raj Darbhanga were Maithil Brahmins. It was during the reign of the Raj Darbhanga family that the capital of Mithila was shifted to Darbhanga.\n\nIn 1324, Ghyasuddin Tughluq, the emperor of Delhi invaded Mithila, defeated Harisimhadeva, entrusted Mithila to his family priest Kameshvar Jha, a Maithil Brahmin of the Oinwar dynasty. Tughlaq took control of Bihar, and from the end of the Tughlaq Dynasty until the establishment of the Mughal Empire in 1526, there was anarchy and chaos in the region.\n\nAkbar (reigned from 1556 to 1605) realised that taxes from Mithila could only be collected if there was a king who could ensure peace there. Akbar summoned Rajpandit Chandrapati Thakur to Delhi and asked him to name one of his sons who could be made caretaker and tax collector for his lands in Mithila. Chandrapati Thakur named his middle son, Mahesh Thakur, and Akbar declared Mahesh Thakur as the caretaker of Mithila on the day of Ram Navami in 1557 AD. Pt. Mahesh Thakur was of the mool, Kharaure Bhaur and hence that dynasty was called ‘Khandwala Kul’ and the capital was made at Rajgram in Madhubani District.\n\nDuring the Malla dynasty’s rule Maithili spread far and wide throughout Nepal from the 16th to the 17th century.During this period, at least seventy Maithili dramas were produced. In the drama Harishchandranrityam by Siddhinarayanadeva (1620–57), some characters speak pure colloquial Maithili, while others speak Bengali, Sanskrit or Prakrit. After the demise of Maheshwar Singh, the ruler of Darbhanga Raj, in 1860, the Raj was taken over by the British Government as regent. The Darbhanga Raj returned to his successor, Maharaj Lakshmeshwar Singh.\n\nLakshmeshwar Singh was the eldest son of Maharaja Maheshwar Singh of Darbhanga. He, along with his younger brother, Rameshwar Singh received a western education from Government appointed tutors as well as a traditional Indian education from a Sanskrit Pandit. He constructed hundreds of miles of roads in various parts of the Raj, planting them with tens of thousands of trees for the comfort of travellers, as part of generating employment for people effected by famine. He constructed iron bridges over all the navigable rivers. He built, and entirely supported, a first-class Dispensary at Darbhanga. Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh built an Anglo-vernacular school as well as nearly 30 vernacular schools of different grades; and subsidised a much larger number of educational institutions. He was also one of the founders of Indian National Congress as well as one of the main financial contributors thereto. He is known for purchasing Lowhter Castle for the venue of the 1888 Allahabad Congress session when the British denied permission to use any public place. The British commissioned Edward Onslow Ford to make a statue of Lakshmeshwar Singh. This is installed at Dalhousie Square in Kolkata.\n\nOn the occasion of the Jubilee of the reign of Queen Victoria, Lakshmeshwar Singh was declared as a Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, and was promoted to Knight Grand Commander in 1897. He was also a member of the Royal Commission on Opium of 1895, formed by British Government along with Haridas Viharidas Desai who was the Diwan of Junagadh. The Royal Opium Commission consisted of a 9-member team of which 7 were British and 2 were Indians and its chairman was Earl Brassey.\n\nThe Khandwala dynasty ruled as the Raj Darbhanga, beginning with Mahesh Thakur, who died in 1558. The last ruler was Kameshwar Singh, whose reign from 1929 came to an end in 1947 with the independence of India, when all the kingdoms merged with Union of India.\n\nCulture\n\nMadhubani/Mithila Painting\n\nMadhubani art or Mithila painting is practiced in the Mithila region of India and Nepal. It was traditionally created by the women of different communities of the Mithila region. It is named after Madhubani district of Bihar, India which is where it originated. This painting as a form of wall art was practiced widely throughout the region; the more recent development of painting on paper and canvas originated among the villages around Madhubani, and it is these latter developments that may correctly be referred to as Madhubani art.\n\nMithila Paag\n\nThe Paag is a headdress in the Mithila region of India and Nepal worn by Maithil people. It is a symbol of honor and respect and a significant part of Maithil culture.\n\nThe Paag dates back to pre-historic times when it was made of plant leaves. It exists today in a modified form. The Paag is wore by the whole Maithil community. The colour of the Paag also carries a lot of significance. The red Paag is worn by the bridegroom and by those who are undergoing the sacred thread rituals. Paag of mustard colour is donned by those attending wedding ceremonies and the elders wear a white Paag.\n\nThis Paag now features place in the popular Macmillan Dictionary. For now, Macmillan Dictionary explains Paag as “a kind of headgear worn by people in the Mithila belt of India.”\n\nOn 10 February 2017, India Posts released a set of sixteen commemorative postage stamps on “Headgears of India”. The Mithila Paag was featured on one of those postage stamps.\n\nSabhagachi\n\nSaurath Sabha is a place situated in between Madhubani and Rahika. And Saurath sabha is great place in the culture and tradition of Mithila. The Saurath Sabha is started by Maharaja Hardev singh in fourteen century. It is a place where nearly 1 or 2 lakh people gather in the month of July for marriage. The traditional process of writing record of marriage called “Sindanth” for Bride (Dulhan) or Groom (Dulha) System. The King Hardev singh also started Registration (Panjikaran) system for Bride and Groom.\n\nLanguage\n\nPeople of Mithila region speak Maithili primarily and are well versed in other languages like Hindi, Nepali, English, Bhojpuri for other different purposes.\n\nThis language is an Indo-Aryan language native to the Indian subcontinent, mainly spoken in India and Nepal and is one of the 22 recognised Indian languages. In Nepal, it is spoken in the eastern Terai and is the second most prevalent language of Nepal. Tirhuta was formerly the primary script for written Maithili. Less commonly, it was also written in the local variant of Kaithi. The publishing of Maithili books in Mithilakshar script was started by Acharya Ramlochan Saran.\n\nCalcutta University recognized Maithili in 1917, and other universities followed suit. In 2002, Maithili was recognized on the VIII schedule of the Indian Constitution as a major Indian language; Maithili is now one of the twenty-two Scheduled languages of India.\n\nMaithil Cuisine\n\nMaithil cuisine is a part of Indian cuisine and Nepalese cuisine. It is a culinary style which originated in Mithila. Some traditional Maithil dishes are:\n\nDahi-Chura\n\nVegetable of Arikanchan\n\nGhooghni\n\nTraditional Pickles, made of fruits and vegetables which are generally mixed with ingredients like salt, spices, and vegetable oils and are set to mature in a moisture less medium.\n\nTarua of Tilkor\n\nBada\n\nBadee\n\nMaachh\n\nMutton\n\nPurakiya ( also known as Gujia) which is basically dumplings.\n\nMakhan Payas\n\nAnarasa\n\nBagiya\n\nSakrouri\n\nTemples and Religious Landmarks\n\nUgna Mahadev Temple, Bhwanipur\n\nShyama Temple, Rajnagar\n\nKapileshwar Temple, Darbhanga\n\nJanki Mandir, Janakpur, Nepal\n\nUgra Tara Sthan, Mahishi, Saharsa\n\nJanki Temple, Sitamarhi\n\nPunaura Dham, Sitamarhi\n\nUchaith Sthan, Madhubani\n\nAhilya Sthan, Darbhanga\n\nKaali Temple, Madhubani\n\nKusheshwar Sthan, Darbhanga\n\nChandika Sthan, Sonbarsa\n\nSingheshwar Sthan, Madhepura"
