        "text": "The past twelve months have seen an appalling series of deaths of people irreplaceable in my life. I am sure you have your own list of singular creators, remarkable men and women who have “moved offstage,” but my list includes Larry McKenna, Max Morath, Manfred Selchow, Harriet Choice, and most recently, Bill Allred, Robert D. Rusch, and Jan Evensmo.\n\nWhat follows, more personal history than research paper, will be short on exact dates, but I hope readers will understand the grief, astonishment, and rage that I am now feeling. John Berryman wrote a poem on the death of his friends and peers that begins “I’m cross with god,” and although shaking one’s fist at the heavens is not effective, I feel the same way.\n\nBoth Bob Rusch (who signed off as RDR) and Jan Evensmo came into my life many decades ago, and to some eyes my contact with them would seem tenuous at most: I never saw Bob face-to-face and Jan only once, but both of them were strong presences in my life for those same decades. They were very dear to me, and no one can take their place. I will explain.\n\nI was reading about jazz from my earliest teens, and I then subscribed to a few periodicals to learn more about musicians and their latest recordings, as well as historical retrospectives. First there was the IAJRC JOURNAL — IAJRC standing for International Association of Jazz Record Collectors, then the Mississippi Rag. The first of these subscriptions pre-dates any computer use; the second was a little more recent, but both began in the previous century. The IAJRC felt, at times, like an international version of the clubhouse that met in someone’s basement, and the editor solicited record reviews and other material. I don’t remember when I began writing for them, but I had time and energy (a holiday from grading freshman essays) and so I submitted reviews of records I had bought. Parallel to this, I should note, I was a thirtyish untenured instructor at Nassau Community College, someone who liked to see his name in print and was flattered that his views on, say, the latest Concord lp would be published.\n\nI wrote enough for the Journal to summon up the energy, or perhaps hubris, to ask the then editor, whose name I have forgotten, if I could be granted a free subscription, and received a haughty reply that HE had never asked for such a thing, suggesting that something was morally wrong with my doing so. I turned elsewhere. I have written about Leslie Johnson, the endearing editor of the Rag, but that association ended with her death. (Everyone who came in contact with Leslie will look wistful at the mention of her name.)\n\nNear my college was a well-stocked Tower Records, whose jazz department had a space for periodicals, and I spent some time there, after browsing the three dozen bins of my favorite artists, leaning against the browser, reading CADENCE for free. It was published montly in Redwood, New York, and its editor was one Robert D. Rusch. I suspect I wrote Mr. Rusch a letter, immodestly detailing my previous publications (I had also written for some jazz magazines that tended to stop publication shortly after I had submitted reviews, alas) and he began to send me parcels of CDs and books. Both the discs and the books came with one top corner cut off, to discourage resale as new, and they had small rectangular orange stickers with CADENCE’s contact details. I have many such benevolences still on my shelves.\n\nMany of the artists covered in that journal were new to me, and many, because I was more provincial then than I hope I am now, seemed positively weird, but Bob was a seeker after truth. Although Leslie Johnson wanted to support the fragile art of hot music with positive reviews, Bob had a pugnacious side. I remember well that when I submitted a review of a Billy Taylor compilation on the Classics label, and said Taylor, then a Jazz Eminence, bored me with his repetition of pet phrases, I called Bob to ask if such heresy was all right, and was delighted that he encouraged me to be as iconoclastic as I liked.\n\nCADENCE was and is honest, a striking rarity in the world of jazz journalism, where a favorable review of A’s new disc, book, or gig, may nestle comfortably near A’s paid ad for their work. Bob’a magazine ran advertisements, but he made sure that there was a blank page, noted as such, between the ads and the reviews. I could write quickly and hand in copy promptly, so the parcels of CDs and books came quickly and they were generous.\n\nBob wanted me to — his own word — “stretch,” perhaps beyond what he perceived as my provincialism. And when I said to him, “Suppose I — out of my limited awareness — say that a saxophonist reminds me of Dexter Gordon when people who know more will hear them as copying Hank Mobley? I don’t want to make mistakes out of ignorance?” he assured me that he would catch any such errors before they saw print. So, mixed in with the Arbors and Concords would be a solo CD by a saxophonist, four long pieces on the tragedy of Chernobyl, a CD the saxophonist had created and paid for in every detail. I might have found it difficult to listen to, like cramming a sheaf of dry crackers in my mouth and trying to swallow, and I battled with the ethical conflict between “telling the truth” and feeling that I was doing the artist an unkindness by saying that the CD was tedious. Who was I, in the name of “honest criticism,” to ensure that some ambitious creator found their art unsaleable, simply because I found it boring? I no longer wanted to parade my subjective reactions under the heading of criticism that someone might take seriously, so, with much thought, I stopped writing for Bob.\n\nBut I did so with great regret. Of course some of the pangs came from no longer receiving free CDs and books, but more than that, it meant I lost contact with the man who signed off as “RDR.” He could appear gruff; his emails were often abrupt in their presentation (he had no time to waste) but he was unfailingly kind to me. I remember phone conversations about a variety of subjects — one in particular a detailing of the dynamics of long marital car trips — that are memorable to me today.\n\nAnd he was as attentive to his fellow beings as he was to the sounds on a disc. When I began writing for his magazine, I was in an unhappy marriage, and when the phone rang in the kitchen (this, of course, dates the story) my then-wife would stand near me to eavesdrop on what was going on, which made for tension in my voice. When she and I separated, and I had my first phone conversation with Bob, I said nothing of my changed circumstances, but he made a point of telling me how different, how relaxed I sounded, which was a great gift to me, helping me to look back on the lengthy painful experience from an outsider’s perspective, all the things I had tried to pretend were not happening.\n\nAt some point, he suffered a stroke, but apparently he kept listening and writing. And he turned to painting. The obituary says that he left us at 80, which is and was all too soon. He did not look for cyber-attention, which is why there is no portrait of him here, and I have offered instead a CADENCE cover. He remains a powerful presence in my thought, and he is one of the people who, by their encouragement, gave me courage to write without hiding behind tactful veils. We all need people who stand behind us, their hand on our shoulder, saying “Go ahead. It’s OK.”\n\nSome appropriate music for RDR:\n\nI wrote about Jan Evensmo in 2016, here, but he had been a jazz-hero since the Seventies and eventually a friendly correspondent. Our most recent e-mail exchange was on December 27, 2023.\n\nHe was a remarkable and original scholar and human being, someone who codified an idea and did the arduous sustained work to bring it to life, all the while sharing it with us. Jazz had discographies — unadorned data-based listings of recordings, usually in chronological order, with the artists arranged alphabetically. And eventually more subjective essays on artists appeared, tracing the shape of their careers, recording by recording. Sometimes the latter was part of a life-study, hence the jazz biography. But Jan invented and mastered what he called “solographies,” chronological listings of recordings, broadcasts, film soundtracks and more — any aural evidence we had — of an artist, in chronological order.\n\nLet us say someone wanted to know the facts of all the times Chu Berry was recorded, in whatever medium. A discography would list the records; a biography might add to that list with life-events. But what Jan did was to listen closely to the evidence, no matter how arcane or inaccessible, state its details (not only the song and the musical context, but the length of the solo passage) and then — and here’s the beautiful part — make a judgment and give his reasons. Those judgments could be rhapsodic or sharp-edged, and, to his credit, he often went back and revised himself when he felt he had been wrong, noting his first (perhaps myopic) response and changing it, admirably. So, in reading any entry, one had a double experience: the analytical facts intertwined with highly personal (and well-reasoned) reactions. It was the printed equivalent of being invited to a wise friend’s house to listen to and discuss records, when that friend would say, “That is so very wonderful!” but also “I am disappointed by that piece of music.”\n\nThe scope of his investigations — his curiosity, his eagerness to hear something new and wonderful (because he didn’t take pleasure in loudly announcing that he thought a solo was second-rate) — was huge.\n\nWhen you visit his extraordinary site, https://www.jazzarcheology.com/, you see that the latest additions to the musicians whose work he was exploring are Sandy Williams, Ray Nance, Henry Hagemann, Phil Urso, and George Matthews. Wisely, he left the figures whose work has already been documented (Armstrong, Holiday, Parker, Ellington, Goodman, Tatum) to others. But who else was listening to everything Phil Urso had recorded?\n\nI first encountered his dazzling work in the middle Seventies, thanks to a generous collector and friend, Bill Coverdale, who shared my fascination with the trumpeter Joe Thomas. In those pre-computer days, Bill and I communicated by typed letters, phone calls, cassette tapes, and photostats. Bill lent me Jan’s booklets on Joe Thomas and Bill Coleman, if I recall correctly, and they were not only full of information and sharp-eared perspectives on music I knew or thought I knew, but they opened a treasure-box of recordings I wanted to hear . . . shiny objects to pursue and then treasure.\n\nI don’t know when I first wrote to Jan, but I believe he had noted he was looking for rare recordings by artists we revered in common, and I let him know I had them and sent cassette copies. And then, because our interchange had been kind, I took a risk and said, “Is there any way I could hear ________? (I think it was a Jerry Newman live recording of Frank Newton called FORNICULI, FORNICULA, FORNICULATE — Newman’s odd boyish humor at work.) Jan put me in touch with the collector who had given the music to him, and I received a copy in the mail. And, slowly and intermittently, our trading-friendship began. I had received some rare music; I sent it to him, asking for something rare in return, and we proceeded. (I doubt that my experience is unique in a world of collectors who are simultaneously keeping their treasures locked up but making the odd copy for someone who has something they want, both sides writing DO NOT COPY on the side of the cassette and pretending not to see their music-driven violations of their own code.)\n\nWhen he began to share his work online, in the site mentioned above, I would get an email saying that he had explored a new artist, or, more frequently, he had added material to a dozen entries on musicians one thought he’d already explored more deeply than anyone else had. I would send him new treasures or things I had uncovered, and would receive some of my own requests with kind (although sharply-focused) replies. It, and he, became a constantly-replenished feast. And the more I read of his commentary, the more endearing a person he became: his unique self, both enthusiastic and salty, came through.\n\nI met him once in person, at the Whitley Bay Jazz Party, sometime around 2012. In a room full of people talking about music and records, he came up to me, introduced himself happily, stood there while I told him (I hope briefly) how much his work meant to me, he graciously returned the compliments, we shook hands, and he went off to talk to an expert, an admirer, a friend.\n\nEveryone who benefited from his work will miss the information he gave us so lavishly and consistently. Some of us will also miss the man who apparently spent his life getting it right, making sure those of us who shared his loves did so from a platform of correct information.\n\nI do not privilege one of these men above the other. Bob helped me become braver; Jan metaphorically invited me and anyone else to his house to share what he heard. It’s been said before, but the art form called jazz is sustained and developed by people who never adjust a ligature.\n\nI mourn these losses. But what does one do with such grief?\n\nIn conversation, one of my dear friends, the superb jazz drummer Bernard Flegar, was lamenting the death of trombone master Bill Allred, and wrote, “I am truly saddened by Bill’s death and will forever try to digest losing Butch [Miles].” I thought about this for a moment and wrote back, “The way to mourn is to play.” Others have said it, but Bernard — driving the Louis-inspired ARMSTRONG’S AMBASSADORS — can make sure that Butch and others are still alive in his own playing. I can strive to be as encouraging as Bob Rusch, as generous as Jan Evensmo. Will I equal them? I don’t know. But acting in the best tradition is better than passive grief, or so I feel.\n\nI forego the usual closing flourishes. Back soon.\n\nImagine an engrossing book “about” jazz that has very little to say about the music. None of the usual content or digressions: anecdotal stories of musicians; portraits of club owners, record producers, concert impresarios. No one’s mother plays the organ; no one has a loving mentor or a horrible first gig.\n\nBut the book, MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MUSIC, by Bruce D. Epperson (University of Chicago Press, 2013) is an intriguing study of something most people involved in the music in more than a casual way find invaluable: discographies.\n\nA discography, for those new to this, is an essay — or book-length — or a dozen volumes — or an online source — that documents the recorded history of this music. As a bibliography (at the end of your fifth-grade report on The Eye) lists the works consulted, a discography seeks to present all the information known on these recordings. It can be limited to one artist, a span of time, a style or genre, or it can attempt to be encyclopedic, comprehensive. Before jazz existed, of course, there were catalogues of compositions — think of the BWV numbers or Kochel numbers for Bach or Mozart. But it was only when listeners and collectors began seriously to both amass and study recorded evidence — artifacts of performance — that the idea and the actual realization of discography came into being.\n\nEpperson comes to this book (the result of five years’ study — and it shows in the best way) from a singular perspective. He is neither a musician nor a collector; rather, he is a bibliophile fascinated by the books and the people who envisioned and created them. (For some “jazz readers,” this is a perspective that takes some getting used to. It is as if one was handed “a study of Shakeapeare” that was really a history of the most renowned and influential editors of the texts of the plays. If one feels at a distance reading about everyone from the first innovators up to Tom Lord, Epperson’s lively prose will stand up to the accompaniment of one’s favorite recordings — all the master and alternate takes in chronological order, of course.)\n\nA good deal of the book is a serious but not dry historical survey of the form — discographical research and publication, as we know it, began in England in the late Twenties and continues as I write this. At first, it was an outgrowth of the urge common among collectors to know all so that all could be possessed. If one fell in love with the sound of Bix Beiderbecke or Eddie Lang, for instance, one wanted to know exactly what recordings they had appeared on (and which were tempting imitations) so that one could, in this world or an ideal one, possess all their music or at least know that it existed. I think of an orinthologist’s “life-list,” where birds spotted get checked off, and I have seen many discographies that are also tidy or untidy lists of what a particular collector has. (I’ve done it myself, and I recall reading my copies of Rust, Jepsen, Lord, and specialized discographies with a mixture of awe and yearning: “Another take of X MARKS MY SPOT exists? And it was issued on Bolivian OKeh? And I don’t have it? How can I hear it?”)\n\nWhy were discographies desirable or necessary? When jazz performances were issued on single discs, often without the individual players listed on the label, one couldn’t be sure who the Kentucky Grasshoppers or Lil’s Hot Shots were. One could trust one’s ears, but that method has often led to what I would call Collector’s Enthusiasm, where every muted trumpet solo had to be by King Oliver; a vague aural shadow of saxophone on a 1934 Clarence Williams record — could that be Lester Young? So, at first, they were lists created by collectors, then made public as more widespread enthusiasm about famous and obscure recordings developed. Then, discographies could serve an ideological purpose: all the recordings in these pages have notable “jazz interest” (translation: they reflect my aesthetic values); they could be divided along racial lines to reflect theorizing about the development of an art form. From more balanced perspectives, they could reflect much about the ways in which art was made public, and tell a great deal about individual artists or groups.\n\nEpperson’s book deals adeptly with the ideas behind the varieties of discographies, and he does so by specific reference — tracing the changes in the form through specific publications and the writers / researchers responsible for them. This might, to the uninitiated, seem like a scriptural list of begats beginning with R.D. Darrell, but the creators themselves seem to have been at best energetic, at worst acrimonious. There are many small contentions documented in this book: questions of accuracy, of plagiarism, of theory and practice. Epperson’s story begins in England, takes in France and New Orleans, digresses most pleasingly into the phenomenon of “field recordings” and the changes brought in discography and record collecting by the long-playing record, and comes up as close to the present as possible. I was amused and pleased to see jazz scholars I know and admire depicted in these pages: Jan Evensmo, Manfred Selchow, Robert Rusch.\n\nEpperson concludes with some deep philosophical questions (with commentary by Michael Fitzgerald, who knows the field deeply): in this new world, where it appears that everything one wants to hear can be heard in digital format, stripped of its evidence, what effect on discography as a scholarly endeavor or a music-lover’s act of reverence? And for the twenty-first century listener who can have all the issued and some unissued recordings of The Bohemian Stompers in one neat multi-disc set, are comprehensive discographies necessary or are they an antique manifestation of the urge to have all the rarities in one place?\n\nIncidentally, the title isn’t Epperson’s point of view — it comes from a 1947 article by Ernest Borneman, “The Jazz Cult.” The book has useful illustrations of pages taken from the respective discographies, generous footnotes and bibliography.\n\nI think this book will have a lasting place in the libraries of many jazz enthusiasts and collectors, and I can see it treated with equal pleasure and respect in graduate programs in library science. But that makes it sound too serious. Epperson is a lively, witty writer, and although he tends to fairness to all sides so thoroughly as to occasionally seem diffident, his sharp observations are a real pleasure.\n\nI said at the start that the book was different from most jazz tomes in that it wasn’t deeply based on anecdotage, but one story has stuck in my mind. The renowned British discographer Brian Rust, Epperson tells us, was already collecting jazz records by the time he was 13 — in 1935 — “it was cheap, and it was approved by the family nurse, who assured them that ‘it’s not possible for germs to survive on smooth surfaces.'”\n\nIf anyone comes to you and asks what you are doing, for the love of goodness, with those records or compact discs, feel free to offer that answer. Jazz records are, if nothing else, sanitary, and thus laudably safer than other objects by which we might amuse ourselves.\n\nMay your happiness increase!"
