        "text": "Early life\n\nChesney Henry Baker was born on 23rd December 1929 in Yale, Oklahoma, to Chesney Sr., a professional guitarist, and Vera, a pianist. Chet started out by singing in the church choir, but things changed when he was introduced to brass instruments. After his father initially gave him a trombone, it proved too big for the child, and he was soon given a trumpet – falling in love with the instrument with noticeable improvements in just two weeks.\n\n1946: First recruitment to the military\n\nChet left school aged 16 to join the US Army, and was assigned to Berlin where he joined the army band. He left the forces two years later, and took up a music theory class at El Camino College in LA, but dropped out in his second year to re-enlist in the Army. He once again became a member of the army band, and when he was discharged again in 1951, Chet began to pursue a musical career. He also married his first wife, Charlene Souder, in 1950. The marriage didn't last long.\n\n1952: Charlie Parker and The Gerry Mulligan Quartet\n\nChet started out by playing in Vido Musso's band with Stan Getz, and in June 1952, Chet grasped the opportunity to play with renowned saxophonist, Charlie 'Bird' Parker, auditioning and winning a place to tour the West Coast when he was 22-years-old. A month later, Chet joined the Gerry Mulligan Quartet – a huge break for the musician, as they became a huge success together and were thought of as pivotal to the 'cool jazz' trend. Playing a solo in 'My Funny Valentine' with Gerry was a huge moment for Chet. It would later become one of Baker's signature songs. Their version of the track would be inducted into the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry in 2015 for its significance. Chet's quartet began to release albums from 1953 to 1956, including Chet Baker Sings, which received the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 2001.\n\n1955: Dipping his toe in the acting world\n\nChet gained his first acting role in Hell's Horizon, a war film in which he played 'Jockey' and played the trumpet. Although he was offered a studio contract, he decided to stick with his musical career, and in 1956 he toured around Europe for eight months, recording Chet Baker In Europe. Upon returning to the US, Chet formed a quintet with Phil Urso and Bobby Timmons, and tried a different style from his normal, relaxed way of playing – this time, testing the waters with a bebop style.\n\n1956: Second wife and first child\n\nChet also met his second wife, Halema Alli, in the spring of 1956, and married her soon after. They welcomed their first and only child together the following year, Chesney Aftab Baker, in 1957, with some sources saying he was nicknamed Rory. Although it's not known exactly when they split up, this marriage was also over quickly, possibly because Chet began to use drugs around this time.\n\n1960: Downward spiral and drug use\n\nChet's life became consumed by narcotics, and he pawned off instruments in order to pay for the habit. Things worsened when he was jailed in Italy on drug charges for a year and a half, as well as being expelled from Germany and the UK, where he was due to appear as himself in film The Stolen Hours. He was even deported back to the US, where he would perform in San Francisco and San Jose in between his prison terms for prescription fraud.\n\n1966: Assaulted in San Francisco and third wife Carol\n\nHe was the victim of a physical assault in 1966 in which his tooth was cracked, ruining his embouchure and leaving him unable to play the trumpet. Work at a gas station followed until he was able to retrain himself. Meanwhile, Chet met his third and final wife, Carol Baker, and married in November 1965.\n\n1970: Comeback\n\nChet took steps to get back on track in the 70s, getting dentures to help his trumpet playing, taking methadone to control his addiction and moving to New York City to start recording and performing again. He even reunited with Gerry Mulligan, performing together at Carnegie Hall in 1974 and also returned to Europe, eventually spending most of his time in the continent and returning to the US only once a year to give performances.\n\n1983: Friendship with Elvis Costello\n\nHe collaborated with British singer Elvis Costello on his album Punch the Clock in 1983, playing a solo on 'Shipbuilding' which helped boost Chet's popularity among a new audience, and the two became friends. Elvis performed alongside Chet in 1986 for Chet Baker: Live at Ronnie Scott's London, and interviewed him about his life and career in between songs.\n\n1988: Death\n\nChet could never quite kick his habit, and fell from his hotel room in Amsterdam on 13th May 1988 at the age of 58. Drugs were found in his system, and his death was ruled to be an accident as it was thought he'd accidentally locked himself out of his room and was attempting to access another room across the balcony.\n\nTributes\n\nThere have been many tributes to Chet since his untimely death, with his unfinished biography being published with the title As Though I Had Wings and even optioned for a film adaptation. He was the subject of the 'semi-factual, semi-fictional' blockbuster film Born to Be Blue in 2015, with Ethan Hawke starring as the trumpeter. An album was also released in 2020, a recording of a live show from his European tour in 1981 entitled Salt Peanuts (Live), named for the club he played In Cologne."
