        "text": "Jazz guitarist/composer/arranger and educator Dale Bruning excites his audiences with the superb quality of his playing.\n\nA native of Carbondale, Pennsylvania, guitarist, composer, arranger, author, and educator Dale Bruning spent time living, working and recording in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York during the 1940s and 1950s. During his tenure in the United States Navy from 1953-57, he was a guitarist and arranger, and when called upon, he also played piano, bass, vibes, and percussion.\n\nUpon his release in 1957, he studied at Temple University, declaring and graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in psychology. He took as many music classes as he could. Concurrently, he studied music and guitar with world renowned educator Dennis Sandole.\n\nIn 1961, Mr. Bruning became the leader of the house band for The Del Shields Show, a television variety program that originated from Philadelphia on WRCV, an NBC affiliate. In 1964, he and his family moved to Denver.\n\nAn accident in 1988 nearly ended Mr. Bruning’s career as a performing musician. While securing a window pane in the rubbish can, a piece of glass broke and slashed a deep cut across his left wrist. His median nerve to the fingers and the thumb tendon were badly cut. Dr. Charles Hamlin rebuilt the sheath around the nerve, enabling it to regenerate itself. The doctor’s strong suggestion to Dale was to play a few minutes each day so that the muscles would not atrophy.\n\nThen, a few months later, he was to accept gigs and play out again. Enter vocalist Lynn Skinner, a dear friend with a compassionate heart. She had bee hired to bring in a trio with her and play at LaCouple in Denver. She did. Dale was one of the players on the gig. Because of Dr. Hamlin, Lynn Skinner, his wife, Hazel, and his own perseverance, he once again became his own amazing playing self.\n\nAfter this tragedy, his commitment to playing was fueled by his deep passion for the music and his own acts of courage every time he picked up the guitar to practice, knowing the pain would be excruciating. His valor during the slow rehabilitative process was rewarded, however, as he has become an even stronger performer than prior to the accident. Considering that he has little feeling in one finger, he amazes audiences with his ability and agility on the fingerboard.\n\nHis prowess as a performer is equaled by his talent in composing, arranging and teaching. During his 45 plus years of private teaching, he has expressed the joy of jazz to more than 3000 students, many of whom went on to become professional musicians. Among those include Bill Frisell, Mark Patterson, Keith Oxman, Tim O’Brien, Pat Donohue, and Mark Simon.\n\nHe has been featured in such prestigious magazines as 20th Century Guitar and Just Jazz Guitar, with superb CD reviews found in JazzTimes, Jazz Journal of England, Guitar Player, Cadence, Jazzscene of Oregon, The Denver Post, The Oregonian, The Omaha Herald, 20th Century Guitar, Western Australia Guitar Society newsletter, Berman Foundation newsletter and Just Jazz Guitar.\n\nHe is also an entrant in The Jazz Guitar book by Maurice J. Summerfield, Ashley Mark Publishing Company, © 1998, United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1995, he and his business partner, writer/concert & CD producer Jude Hibler, began their Jazz Link Enterprises CD label by coproducing The Dale Bruning Quartet: Tomorrow’s Reflections (JLECD-44001). He has since recorded Conference Call with Michael Moore (JLECD-44002); Reunion with Bill Frisell (JLECD-40072), and is heard on Live! at Sherman’s Coffee House (JLECD-44003) with Rich Chiaraluce on reeds/leader and Kenny Walker on bass.\n\nOn the 2002 JLE release, The Timeless Music of Harold Arlen, Bruning’s Quartet features Michael Moore, bass; Rich Chiaraluce, reeds; and Paul Romaine, drums. Partner Hibler is the Narrator and is also heard on this recording.\n\nThe Timeless Music of Harry Warren CD finds The More I See You, Jeepers Creepers, I Had the Craziest Dream and so many other hits from the 1930s-1950s on this recording.\n\nHis 2005 release, Easy Does It! The Music of Charles Eakin features himself, Rich Chiaraluce, Mark Simon, and Paul Romaine.\n\nIn 2006, Music of Gershwin, By George! is his latest recording. This CD on the JLE label includes pianist Jeff Jenkins, bassist Mark Simon, and drummer Paul Romaine. Dale arranged all of the music and is the leader/guitarist.\n\nHis other CDs include Music of Gershwin, By George! – Dale Bruning Quartet, Classical Connections, Vol I: with Ali Ryerson and Classical Connections, Vol II: with Ali Ryerson\n\nAlso in 2006, he was the honoree of The Dale Bruning Celebration Day – a four hour tribute to him and his accomplishments in music and in his personal life as being one of the major influences in the jazz world throughout the world. More than 350 people attended this time of recognition, including Bill Frisell and Gene Bertoncini.\n\nIn 1997, Bruning authored his first book: The Dale Bruning Jazz Guitar Series, Volume I: Phrasing and Articulation (© 1997, Jazz Link Enterprises Publishers). His Vol II book – The Dale Bruning Jazz Guitar Series, Volume II: Phrasing and Arpeggios (© 2010, (Jazz Link Enterprises Publishers) is available at this website. In 2014, this third book was published titled The Dale Bruning Jazz Guitar Series, Volume III: Phasing: Scales & Intervals.\n\nThanks for the Memory…Jim Hall is a double-CD as a tribute to the late Jim Hall. On the JLE label, this incredible release in 2014 of The Dale Bruning Sextet, includes Bill Frisell, Ron Miles, Mark Patterson, Mark Simon, and Paul Romaine.\n\nIn October, 2016, The Dale Bruning Jazz and American Music Scholarship Endowment was established at Metro State University at Denver.\n\nDale has 9 Lesson videos available at youtube.com/judehibler. Best part for you? They are free!! He also has 6 concert movies available. They, too are at youtube.com/judehibler and are also free.\n\nWhen Covid played havoc with the world, Dale and I decided to dissolve Jazz Link Enterprises and resume our individual interests by each of us having our own website. Hence, the dalebruning.com and judehibler.com sites made more sense to us. Come visit each of us.\n\n…Jude Hibler\n\nMr. Bruning lives in Thornton, Colorado.\n\nby Jude Hibler"
