The sextet for the session was brimming with top talent from the West Coast Jazz scene including tenor saxophonist Phil Urso, pianist Carl Perkins, bassist Curtis Counce, and drummer Larance Marable.\n\nA notable feature of the date was its focus on the compositions of saxophonist Jimmy Heath who penned five of the album’s tracks: “Picture of Heath,” “For Miles and Miles,” “C.T.A.,” “For Minors Only,” and “Resonant Emotions.” The set is rounded out by two of Pepper’s tunes—“Minor-Yours” and “Tynan Tyme”—and the playing throughout is unfailingly vibrant with exquisite solos and lively band interplay all of which which makes this a quintessential cool jazz date.\n\nThis mono Blue Note Tone Poet Vinyl Edition was produced by Joe Harley, mastered by Kevin Gray (Cohearent Audio) from the original analog master tapes, pressed on heavyweight vinyl at Record Technology Inc. (RTI), and packaged in a deluxe tip-on jacket.\n\nTRACKLISTING:\n\nA1: For Minors Only\n\nA2: Minor-Yours\n\nA3: Resonant Emotions\n\nA4: Tynan Tyme\n\nB1: Picture Of Heath\n\nB2: For Miles And Miles\n\nB3: C.T.A."
