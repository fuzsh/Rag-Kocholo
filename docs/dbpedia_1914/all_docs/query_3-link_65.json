        "text": "On the road with the Buddy Morrow Orchestra (BMO). Some of the other Geneva-area musicians that worked with this band included Ray DeSio, trombonist; Joe Kloess, pianist; and Suzanne Stewart, vocalist. Occasionally, Morrow would let his band members do a 'jazz' set during intermissions. Morrow, who treated LaFaro like a son, often had to remind him to play what was written for the band.\n\nThe BMO traveled the same circuit as the Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ) for part of this year. During a visit to Detroit, while LaFaro was practicing in his room at the Wolverine Hotel, MJQ bassist, Percy Heath heard him practicing and knocked on his door to introduce himself. The two became friends and later on Heath jokingly remarked to LaFaro, \"If you are going to go to all that trouble, Man, why not play guitar?\" To which LaFaro responded, \"Because bass is my instrument.\" (Letter, 1 November 1996, Suzanne Stewart-Knight.)\n\nGig: Carnegie Hall -- with the Chet Baker Quintet.\n\nThe Annual Birdland Tour [i.e., The Birdland Stars of '57 or Birdland All-Stars Revue] opened Friday 15 February at Carnegie Hall, New York and closed 17 March in Washington, DC.\n\nCast included Sarah Vaughn, Billy Eckstein, Jeri Southern, Count Basie band with Joe Williams, Bud Powell, Phineas Newborn, Lester Young, Chet Baker, Zoot Sims, Seldon Powell, the Terry Gibbs quartet with Terry Pollard, and Rolf Kuhn. -- Down Beat 24.03 (February 6, 1957), p. 9. LaFaro was playing with Chet Baker at this time.\n\n\"Chet Baker's group popped out for a pair of originals by Manny Albam and Bob Brookmeyer. Baker had a front line of tenors Seldon Powell, Zoot Sims, and Phil Urso, with German clarinetist Rolf Kuhn. Both numbers [i.e., compositions] were highlighted by Sims' easy, swinging tenor and the punchy, single-note style of Powell. On both numbers there was apparently some confusion in getting back to the head after the final rhythm break.\" -- Down Beat 24:06 (March 21, 1957), p. 12.\n\n\"En decembre 1957, il file vers Chicago afin de jouer quelques semaines avec Ira Sullivan et Pat Moran. C'est le temps de son premier disque, avec [Mlle.] Pat Moran, pour Audio Fidelity.\" (Binchet, p. 20).\n\n\"I [LaFaro] don't like to look back, because the whole point in jazz is doing it now. I don't even like any of my records except maybe the first one I did with [Miss] Pat Moran on Audio Fidelity.\" (Williams, \"Introducing Scott LaFaro\" Jazz Review 3 (August 1960) p. 16.)"
