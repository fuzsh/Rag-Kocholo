        "text": "Some saxophonists – and singers too – have problems adjusting their lungs to the elevation when they perform in Colorado.\n\nJoe Lovano, a contemporary master of the jazz tenor saxophone, isn’t concerned about a lapse in his prowess when he plays at altitude in Boulder tonight.\n\n“My family’s from Mount Etna in Sicily, so I can handle it,” he recently told The Denver Post while laughing off the challenge.\n\nLovano’s connection to the famous volcano is appropriate: He’s capable of explosive improvisational bursts, as evidenced by a long string of winning releases making him as consistent a recording artist as any figure on today’s jazz scene.\n\n“The first time I played Boulder, it was with Woody Herman’s band in the late ’70s,” Lovano said. At 53, he is one of the last in a line of sax behemoths who served under the bandleader dating back to the 1930s. The ranks include Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Gene Ammons and current Denver resident Phil Urso.\n\nWith the great road bandleaders (such as Herman, Duke Ellington and Count Basie) now long gone, young jazz performers don’t have the opportunity to work in and enjoy the camaraderie of a large musical organization. Lovano finds value in those formative years to this day.\n\n“I joined Woody when I was 23,” he said. “It gave me a lot of strength and foundation to develop as a leader. He had confidence in letting me play and featuring me. It was a real springboard.”\n\nThe years logged on the road with Herman not only linked Lovano with a grand jazz history, it led to friendships and connections with other young musicians at the time, like saxophonist Bob Belden, also a member of the late-period Herman big band.\n\nBelden has come into his own as a composer, and recently called Lovano to record some tenor and clarinet solos on a new soundtrack CD for the film “Three Days of Rain” (Sunnyside), a drama set in Lovano’s hometown of Cleveland. The results are what’s come to be known as typically Lovano: sincere, authoritative performances displaying what Belden, in the disc’s liner notes, calls Lovano’s “warm, wet sound.”\n\nBut straight-ahead variations on ballads and blues are just two points of departure for Lovano’s creative excursions, which can successfully run toward the more avant-garde.\n\nHe’s as comfortable interacting with veterans (like 87-year old pianist Hank Jones on last years’ “Joyous Encounter” CD) as he is trading ideas in small groups with musicians decades younger than him. The latter group includes the members of his current quartet, who will be onstage with him in Boulder tonight. Lovano calls his band “really fresh and beautiful.”\n\n“In my generation, I’ve been really fortunate to span so many different expressive periods in jazz to study,” he said.\n\n“I came to New York (where he is now based) in the ’70s and had the experience of playing with so many people, cultures and generations. The multigenerational thing has always been part of my development.”\n\nLovano has made the most of his ability to synthesize jazz history and use it to his artistic advantage. He seeks that knowledge of the music in those he works with as well.\n\n“I look for people to play with who have an insight into the deeper understanding of the world of music,” he said.\n\nLovano also makes it a point to collaborate with artists who are creatively attuned to one another.\n\n“People who improvise are different from people who just play solos,” he said. “A lot of people play at the same time, but some people know how to play together. And it’s not just how they play, but they know what’s happened, what’s happening and what could happen.”\n\nBret Saunders writes about jazz for The Denver Post.
