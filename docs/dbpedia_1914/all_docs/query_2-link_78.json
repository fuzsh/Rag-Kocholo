        "text": "Tony Fruscella (February 4, 1927 – August 14, 1969) was a mellow, lyrical, cool American jazz trumpeter in the vein of Chet Baker who unfortunately lived a similarly addictive lifestyle that led to a tragically premature death.\n\nFruscella was born in Greenwich Village in 1927, into a family that belonged to the Italian-American working class of that area. His childhood years are largely undocumented, but he was brought up in an orphanage from an early age and seems to have had little exposure to music other than as it related to the church. However, he left the orphanage when he was about fourteen or fifteen, started studying the trumpet, and came into contact with both classical music and jazz.\n\nHe appears to have been quick to develop his skills and was soon playing in public. When he was eighteen he went into the army and gained more experience by playing in an army band. It was around this time that Fruscella also encountered the new modern sounds of the day, and the post-war years saw him mixing with the many young, white New York jazzmen who were devoted to bebop and cool jazz. They had an almost-fanatical belief in the music and had little time for anything else.\n\nOne of the musicians who participated in these sessions was an alto-player by the name of Chick Maures, and in 1948 he and Fruscella recorded for a small label called Century, though the records never appeared commercially until thirty years later. Of course, by 1946 bebop was well-established, and the music shows the influence of the famous Charlie Parker quintet of those days. Fruscella's trumpet playing, though superficially akin to that of Miles Davis, had its own subtlety and warmth. Fruscella married teenage singer Morgana King in 1947. They had a daughter Graysan (1950–2008)\n\nFruscella and the others no doubt continued to play when and where they could, and a few even got to work professionally. But paying jobs, especially those involving jazz, were often hard to come by. Bob Reisner, a writer around Greenwich Village in the early1950s, recalled that Fruscella never seemed to have a permanent address. \"Short marriages, short stays in hospitals and jails, and he invented the crash pad. He walked the streets, an orphan of the world, but with incredible dignity. He never accepted anything for free. He would cook and clean and play music if you put him up.\"\n\nThe chaotic nature of Fruscella's life wasn't improved by his use of alcohol and drugs. He wasn't alone in this. Chick Maures, his companion on the 1948 record date, died from a drugs overdose in 1954, and Don Joseph, a trumpeter who was not unlike Fruscella in his playing and was close to him as a person, had a career that was marred by drug addiction. Both were wayward to the point of self-destruction.There were a few moments of near-glory in Fruscella's career however. In February, 1952, he joined forces with altoist Herb Geller, tenorman Phil Urso, pianist Bill Triglia, and a couple of others, to produce some music which ought to have been heard at the time and drawn some attention to Fruscella. Instead, it simply disappeared into the vaults, and Fruscella and his companions carried on struggling to play their music and earn a living.\n\nA little steady work did come along now and then, and in 1953 Fruscella was hired to play with Stan Getz's group. Some poorly-recorded excerpts from a broadcast from Birdland do exist, and on \"Dear Old Stockholm\" Fruscella demonstrates all that was best in his playing as he shapes a solo that is relaxed, warm, melodically coherent, and in which the use of spaces between the notes is as important as the notes themselves. Some listeners might think there is a resemblance to Chet Baker in Fruscella's sound.\n\nHe did play with Gerry Mulligan's group briefly in 1954, but it is only slight, and Fruscella very much had his own way of constructing a solo. 1955 was probably the peak year in Fruscella' s short career, and he was featured on a couple of recordings by Stan Getz and was also invited to make an LP under his own name for the Atlantic label, a well-established company.\n\nWhat happened to Tony Fruscella after 1955? Very little, it seems, if the reference books are anything to go by. He probably still played at jam sessions and perhaps even did some club work in obscure places, but the \"dogged will to fail\" that Bob Reisner saw in him, and his drug and alcohol problems, must have held him back. Also in 1956 his marriage to Morgana King ended in divorce.\n\nThe 1960s were lean years for a lot of jazzmen, as pop music took over in clubs, dance halls, and on the radio. His kind of music, quiet, reflective, and requiring sympathy and understanding from the listener was hardly likely to appeal to many people. It never had, it's only fair to say, but things got even worse. Apart from a few hospital stays caused by his well-known personal problems nothing at all is known of his activities in the sixties. Tony Fruscella died on April 14th 1969, whilst at a friend’s apartment. The cause of death was cirrhosis and heart failure.”\n\n(Edited mainly from Jazz Profiles)"
