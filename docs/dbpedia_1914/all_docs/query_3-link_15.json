        "text": "Keith Richards, Robert Brissette, and Ron Wood during Brissette’s post-Hot Hero career.\n\nPost-Production Notes\n\nAe13U: After Hot Hero, the band stuck together as 212 [ed. note: pronounced “two-one-two”] and performed in the NYC/New Jersey area. How long did you perform together? Where there any other band members besides the original four during this time? Did you keep the same sound as 212 as you did as the HHB, or freed from network constraints, how did your music evolve? Did you perform covers or originals and any recordings as 212?\n\nRobert Brissette: The 212 band played shows in the greater New York area. A lot of people knew us from HHS; there were no other players than us. We played original tunes and maybe performed “Get Together,” the well-known Youngblood's song that Felix actually produced, every now and then. Our original stuff came from the various influences we all had. The song “Promises,” which we performed on Show #6 if I recall, was written by Mark Cunningham and a singer he worked with prior to HHS. Not sure whether I could get my hands on any of our recordings.\n\nThe Hot Hero Band performing “Get Together.”\n\nAe13U: Did Felix Pappalardi have any involvement with 212, or was his involvement just with the show?\n\nRobert Brissette: Felix's involvement was confined to the show. I believe he came to see us from time to time in NYC.\n\nAe13U: NYC in the late 70s and early 80s was an exciting time to be young and in a band. Can you give us a peek behind the curtain and discuss some of the band and venues 212 ran across at that time?\n\nRobert Brissette: We played a number of the big rock clubs in the area - Tramps, Gildersleeves, The Ritz and various outdoor venues as well. We ran into bands like Foreigner, Aerosmith, Eddie Money, Joe Jackson, Little River Band, Joan Jett and others [ed. note: Eddie Money, Joe Jackson, and the Little River Band, also played on HHS].\n\nAe13U: Any idea who might still have the rights or the master tapes to all those Hot Hero Band recordings? I know there is a company [Retro Video Inc.] that sells footage from Hot Hero Sandwich (and many other series) including the musical performances, but I’m guessing NBC still owns all those rights. Can you give any insight into all this?\n\nRobert Brissette: With respect to the rights to the shows, NBC would own the exclusive rights to the video content. Any music performed on the show would be part of a separate copyright/licensing arrangement as dictated by the label that owns the master recording.\n\nAe13U: In an article you posted online, you noted you worked in the entertainment marketing for many years. Can you tell us a little bit about what you did, who you worked for, and who you worked with?\n\nRobert Brissette: EMCI/Rockbill was the premier entertainment market company in the US, and we worked with Fortune 500 clients and top-name artists putting strategic alliances together, including Sprint/Rolling Stones; Discover Card/Ringo Starr; Honda Scooters/Sting; Sears/Phil Collins; Gitano/Shania Twain; Pepsi/Michael Jackson, Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Lionel Richie and many others. I was VP Event Marketing and helped sell-in and activate the deals we negotiated. I traveled on most of the tours and met artists and clients alike on a regular basis.\n\nAe13U: You’re still active in the music scene in the New York City area with the band, Twist Of Fate. Can you tell us a little about that? How long have you been involved and how would you describe the band’s sound?\n\nRobert Brissette: I have played in a very popular band, Twist Of Fate, for nearly sixteen years. We have a big following in Westchester County, our home base, and pride ourselves on our repertoire and lively presentation. We rehearse weekly, play often and have over 150 songs on our list. Band has guitar, bass, drums, steel drums, fiddle/violin and sax. By virtue of that atypical configuration, we have a sound that no other band has. Twist Of Fate has a Facebook page and a website: www.twistoffatemusic.com.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nA very special thanks to Robert Brissette on behalf of all Hot Hero Sandwich fans for his gracious participation in this effort to document the series and give us a backstage pass look for the Hot Hero Band. There will be more interviews with other Hot Hero Band members, so stay tuned!\n\n● ● ●"
