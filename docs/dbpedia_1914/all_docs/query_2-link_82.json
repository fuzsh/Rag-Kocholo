        "text": "Frank let it leak to the ladies that he knew Chet personally, a complete lie. They were skeptical, so when Baker left the bandstand for a break, Frank walked up and said, “Hey, Chet. Artt Frank. Remember me?”\n\nChet didn’t, and said so. But after Frank had returned to the bar, to the derision of those who’d witnessed the brush-off, Baker caught his eye and gestured for Frank to meet him outside.\n\n“Maybe he felt sorry for me because he hadn’t acknowledged me,” muses Frank. “But we go outside, and he says, ‘Where were we supposed to have met?’\n\n“I said, ‘Chet, I can’t bullshit you. I’ve never met you before. I just heard you on the radio, man, coming back from Korea.’\n\n“We walked out to the end of the street and stood on the curb. The traffic was moving by quite rapidly, and he stood there, all mesmerized. I said, ‘You all right, man?’ And he said, ‘Oh, yeah. It’s just these cars, man. If I hadn’t been a trumpet player, I’d have been a racecar driver. And my dream would’ve been to drive a car in Le Mans— and win.’ ”\n\nSince the Storyville gig was being broadcast over the radio and had strict time and repertoire requirements, Frank wasn’t able to sit in that night. However, Baker told the drummer that the band had a month-long gig coming up at Birdland in New York, and if Frank wanted to come up then, he’d be glad to have him guest with the band.\n\nThat sounded great to Artt Frank, who’d already sat in with the likes of Charlie Parker and Bud Powell in that same famed venue. However, when the time came to go, Frank was unable to find anyone to cover his shifts at the mill.\n\nThe two men wouldn’t meet again for nearly a decade and a half.\n\n* * *\n\nIn 1973, Chet told me he was going up to visit his old friend in Denver, Colorado, a guy by the name of Phil Urso, the tenor saxophone player. While he’s there, Dizzy Gillespie’s there, and he says, “Are you working?” Chet says, “No.” So Dizzy Gillespie calls the Village Gate in New York City and gets him a gig. Everyone thinks this is his first comeback gig, but the first comeback gig he ever had was with me, in 1969 in Hollywood.\n\n-Artt Frank\n\nThe Melody Room job was a success, drawing celebrities like Old Hollywood’s Frankie Avalon, Dennis Cole (then starring in the TV series Felony Squad), Lenny Bruce’s mother and widow, and a rising Ike and Tina Turner, who were working next door at the Classic Cat Burlesque. Management extended the quartet’s booking, and while Baker had many more ups and downs until his 1988 death from a fall in Amsterdam, there was no doubt he was on his way back."
