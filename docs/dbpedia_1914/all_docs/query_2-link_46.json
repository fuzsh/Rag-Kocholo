What's going on. But jazz fans the knowledgeable jazz fans of course are aware of the sun yourself from at least the mid 50s. I got a friend who's an alto player and worships a guy I know he's out there listening to himself or not being down here to listen I know you folks have been cooped up in the house with your relatives from Wisconsin since Thursday with leftover turkey this is a good excuse to get out of the house and. You know kick loose a little bit. Oh sure you know. Left you can\n\nonly watch so much football and eat so much turkey and some relatives from Wisconsin within you say. Plus if they're if they're from Wisconsin and that you know that the chill of the air will bother about all of those babies about it. Roger if you've got relatives in Mississippi or.

Come on down and join us. You'd love to see us portions of the broadcast they are made possible in part by the Coors Brewing Company and its Coors literacy pass it\n\non. Campaign as you can enjoy jazz KUVO and remember Corps literacy and pass it on. So your so you'll have to put these on if you want to hear what's going on. And indeed we've got we've got Phil with us my golly were on there. We're on. Nice opening set. Thank you very much. We surely enjoyed it here and folks at home in their cars got a chance to hear you. Goodness it's good to get in people's car. And it was living. I tell you it's great to have you here I remember a couple of years ago when you came to visit us out to the studio when you and Tony Rodriguez came by I was wonderful. Yeah we had a great time that day that was a nice essence and yet of course you guys held down the fort on Sunday nights out there at the Primavera for awhile from of about 14 months gone. Yeah a lot of musicians came by and sat in with you every day risk on the set and then there are a lot of important people it was a great what is banned. Oh yeah. Yeah. Everybody can. Have. A wonderful experience. I mean.\n\nI you know I promised the audience I would I would reminisce just a little bit. Sure and I only want to go back as far as you want to go. And that's cool but we were talk a little bit when we talked on the phone a few days ago about some recordings the other day on the air I think it was Friday I got a chance to play a track that was right you're of course well familiar with him and as part of the Art Pepper Chet Baker legacy and your contributions to to that great recording session it was a track called mine or yours. That was Art Pepper and The album is called Playboy. And done by. The world Pacific. Richard Richard Bach was the producer of course he's the head enchilada. Well you remember those things real easy has it it was Curtis Council's rhythm section. Curtis council tried to launch Marilyn discounts in. A guy that played the piano with his elbow up and they're running the ball Perkins. Carl Perkins and you know I don't know a lot about him he was it or he was part of the Curtis Curtis Council.\n\nBasically what a waste. A West Coast contingent rightmost part of the trumpet player was Jack Sheldon. Jeremy and then Curtis counts Lawrence Marable. And Carl Perkins. And they'd. And. They came up with the idea of a list of Playboys album you know 55 or so for the second time around 56 Yeah. And. They decide to add me in the front line and. They wrote a nice little thing about. Our. Nice thing about Chet. Hart had a long experience more experience on a longer playing and leader Chet and I I said and playing along. Then back with Stan Kasten back in forty eight forty nine and sure like to go back that far but but you know art at that time was being touted as the most talented alto player since Parker one of the most beautiful alto players around that at that time was great and I had a beautiful sound. And could improvise great and just and Reign of Elizabeth and this was before he has problems then me and you know what. Well he had he had some problems with the ladies and he has a problem with drinking if he had some plans with this before did a\n\nstance in other words and yes I'll carry. Yeah and I thought he has to get loosened up in different ways. Right right. We all understand those Sure. So that's nine thousand fifty six. Yeah now when did you go into the studio and record what's been hailed from Downbeat magazine I think it was 55 or 56. The album The philosophy of earth so all that was done 54 and 54. Ozzie Cadena put that together for Savoy. OK ansible support jazz. Yeah they hired Bobby Brook Myra first to get the horn and the right. I went down to hear Miles Davis and asked him if I could use his rhythm section which was composed of the time. Percy Heath and Kenny Clarke and Arsenal were also just one of the child and said hey how about tomorrow night at 6 o'clock you know after I have Miles for mission of course. Sure and that's all that Bobby book my album Long myself first and then the clock ourselves and we went and got a five star down downbeat writers\n\nsure did one that was really something to get it wasn't for the the the original with themselves it was really integration and the feeling of yeah although the actual session the way came off his knee. That's what that's the way the writer said Judy. The rhythm section really made things click you know. Yeah I couldn't do anything. And the charts were nice and easy. Simon. Bobby sounded good. Of course. Firstly he's can talk ourselves of course oh yeah HARAZIM coming on and on his own now as he owes me some money. There's always somebody out there will be here a few turns on that sure. Savoy a bit later on became region I believe. You know that cause. Yes yes that's true. Well the label now is that the Savoy jazz and muse as they are under the ownership of a gentleman named Joe Fields was based out of New Jersey and I once in a while once a year or so I get up to talk with him and I you know feel I've been\n\nafter him for a while now to release that because number one it's out of print. The philosophy of verse on muse on Savoy is out of print and number two. Meaning that it's out of print that means that that you cannot buy it anywhere unless for some reason a collector has it or someone I know you have personally have a copy. I know that I overheard something about five or six maybe eight years ago. That the Japanese bought 25000 copies. And that I know Ozzie Cadena had something to do with it. Right. I know sell 25000 coverage out and give me about 250 bucks or something. Well the name is yeah but anyway that the Japanese have 25000 copies on matters as far as I'm sure Shabab revoke mine the data I mentioned and. Some of the things on there with an organ trio. That I play and I see my other nice things on. And that are all about the album. And it's all very well. And you know well without the Japanese by Sure.\n\nNow right after that by the way if you just joined us filler so is our guest this evening live from multiple to back and fill in his quartet will be up in just a few moments to get into the third set leaving our second set live for the pack were 25 markets come down and join us we'd love to see here tonight indeed is a special honor to have Phil but they are moving on right after that isn't it. Is that when you first met Chet Baker and got on the road or one on I met I met Jeff. Right after mine to. Safety for 55 right when they booked Miles Davis and the Birdman was his quartet. And. Sonny Rollins asked me if he could use my horn to play with my kids. And. Chet was playing already with us friend. Carson. Carson Smith and Bob Dylan. And his quartet and so Jerry Mulligan and to and Chad we're talking at the bar you know. I walk into Gerry. Mulligan and I said. Which introduced me to chest injury chest and I think\n\nhis injuries at this Chet This is Phil Phil says just as I heard a lot of nice things about you. You got your horn you know right away. Sure. Well I got over there in the corner booth you know I love that whole thing. Oh that would have been. The worst thing that could possibly have. Sure but I went up and played two sets with him when the. Electric lights televised on. A few other nice things and 54. Yeah and then he asked me to draw in a row and he wanted to make a change. And we need another piano player because Russ Raymond was going to leave to go to L.A. to do some studio work and decided to stay out there. Sure. We started off down the fence to the two weeks of bird land and finished with the without the piano just like a jury Mulligan sword's not really. A piano and we played all modern arrangements at Slate. Then we got to Detroit. And we picked. Out A. Like pick up a diamond. What a player. And we got\n\nhim accounted for. A year. And then we went back to. Philadelphia picked up Bobby chairmans and then restart. Bobby Timmons Yeah we think you guy was before the law before like you know yes this is a way for art of light hearted heard of them. Yeah just the one that we lobby for Monique Yeah right. And we he we were playing the the show both in Philadelphia. And him and his friend were standing there and. He always said he asked he asked our drummer sick of sands of stoppage I'm sure. Bob is a chaos initial Chet heard him and just was just floored. You know the way he plays it's on going the road and you're sure Phil had all the money and I. Got out of wild guesses. How about Bill 75 to start where then get shipped to hundreds of drake when do we leave. Right after this gig you know the ashes like on Thursday or Friday and Saturday and we're done. Sure. Some. Are following. Levi's. That Sunday or Monday. But Bobby really around and out of her. See I didn't know that I had no idea. Bobby Timmons was with his look at\n\nPanama. City. Bass player was. A Bill Evans. Scott the files come a fall and then Lawrence Marable. Them I checked myself. Sure. I'm going to. Have this swing swing group. So you were with Jeff what 15 15 16 years but on call on stand by OK. Whenever he would check me for five years for. A role the say and have two years off OK and then an hour we would go out three to go to Europe. For it for six months or so. Sure. I understand festivals. Clubs club dates over there so I went to what did you settle into. The Denver area. Actually when I came to Denver in 1957 after he was. On the European. Tour. Once a day for a penalty. That's when he took it towards it. Peter let me. And. My leaving out. They say Oh yeah. James Bond Jimmy Bond\n\nand they went over there in the quartet. And. They when they came back Where then. I joined them I rejoined and again they needed another horn so. I was. I was available. Yeah. It was a it was an experience for the. City experience sure that it was the limit as it. Cut you settlin the Denver the late 60s enders to 57 we had our member July 4th replying over. All that number. Right. I could see the fireworks going in. The night flight. And I just I thought that's how our numbers 57. Sometimes. Think it's. July Fourth and you're originally from where Elizabeth New Jersey. Elizabeth New Jersey. What is it about the Jersey that has produced so many marvelous jazz musicians. There's Hank Mobley there. With us only Kill Bill Evans around Sure sure missions at the heart of that all. Stars jersey seems to be a place where they really come from Detroit to not forget the Detroit effects of this social. Jackson that. Freddie Hubbard. Was facing Zaw magic that when you when you do that this is what\n\nwhat basically is is this was going to be your calling so to speak as a young man you got a chance to get into the city. And here although. I lived in Elizabeth so about 25 minutes. 30 minutes away by bus sure or by train. Or. If you drove and. Don't drive because it's. Not a parking place it's always been that way even in the 30s and 40s. Parking places and most impossible so you go in she had a block square area. Basis treat. Her like. She wanted to go home. All those places. Which I. Like. And they were. There was and I enjoy it. Join us. And to play with those people. There and to be with and then I played last affair for. I got to play with Miles for a few months but then that's a later date. It wasn't what they were that was well it was before. Before check back in 1955. All right around in there. Chad had a. He was over and. Charlie Parker found him sure. You know.\n\nAnd in California and I was in New York playing with Oscar predator and different groups. And. I just got with so many who can't I can't think of. All of them. Chuckling. Kind of for. The Miles Davis thing that came from common sense and said Torrence simply was the biggest thing on the radio in the 50s. New York right. And he took a band up. We did the hi hat in our Boston for two weeks which will The band consists of Kenny Clarke. Percy he's. A No. No piano. M. Jackson myself. JJ and miles. That lasted two weeks and it. Lets you. Down a Baltimore. Song at last too. Yeah it's a phase. And Sid was the emcee and he. Sure he collected all the money to. Hire goodness he was a little bit under the table if you know if you follow me. And Miles and him had a. Scuffle so. He just disbanded at the time was sure. I can't blame him. But when they're not doing. Business with. Honest people. Why continue. You know\n\nand. You know. It makes sense. Yeah that's the kind of person he was and if you didn't know it why. It took. Didn't take very long to find out. It's amazing. That so I want to thank you very much for. Having to go out thank you. And we look forward to your next that the next five minutes or so. All right I will get get my music set all set up. All right. Thank you very much thank you. Thank you both for listening and thank you very much for having me. Cause you're most welcome. Phil or so in our booth here the the second booth probably for the musicians Dor. The. Period eligible to play. That's what if the market up calls Landolin are broadcast as usual continues till 11 o'clock this evening and we're just a few minutes away from having. Philip his quartet back up on the bandstand. If you want to call it that. It's that. It's a permanent.\n\nSemipermanent riser that holds the piano and a drum kit and. CHORUS. The fuse to the base of. The horn players now stand on the floor and say stages that reduced a bit. But tonight we're featuring fillers on tenor and soprano. Along with Andy Weil on piano. And we have on bass Mark diamond and all the drops a fine drummer one of my favorite hysteria. Mr. Chris Leak Oh yeah. ANDREA SEABROOK So kick it. That's all yeah they've got a pretty good stuff. We always have to keep an eye on the microphone stand over there with his gold. Headed out. For you best dad on a surprise one heck of a conversation here at AM but I'm taping it at home so yeah it he was. Phil is an interesting gentleman. Part of living jazz history. That's right. You know was he was telling us he was these cutlasses and stories it's great to\n\nto hear that that's part of the treasure of being able to. Have a few minutes and. You know and we all are benefit from this we all share from the experience of the band. The caliber of musician of pillows all because you don't want to it's gone. You know what's what's people like to live so long as we all do sometimes. Point those are. Our experiences and that. You know lifelong to Shari's and dreams that move on I mean it's like it's like Author Haley in there and you know the whole roots scenario if you if you get a chance to talk to one of your loved ones who it was a little older. And could get you could reminisce a little bit about. Some of the things that happen in your family history that go back 50 60 70 80 years. You better take advantage of all especially from the point of view of someone who was there. Yeah. As opposed to a biographer or a historian I'm sure is going to look at it from that\n\ndispassionate kind of arm's length view. Yeah we're trying to be unbiased and stuff and Phil is a cat who went through it he was there he was and I was living it. That's that's part of the jazz life you know. To be. If if I can use the word indoctrinated I mean when you start getting into jazz and the further you get some stories in here in the music and how the music relates. To you know it's his life he's playing and he's playing the horn. And when you get to hear some of his experiences it gives you a little insight on this play and why he plays and wait while you hear what you hear what else. He's just a treasure that's for sure. So we're real fortunate to have it down here tonight that's for sure. Well there's an old saying at the end. And. In this business a lot of times you have to be lucky to be noticed and to get the opportunity. But you have to be good to last and to make it feel Arsal has certainly proven that he's severely a good thing. And\n\nagain one of these days. I know we talk about it every once in awhile but one of these days we will. Get a copy of the philosophy of our self. Recorded it all in 1954 on the Savoy label and one of the downbeat magazines of five star albums of the year that he has he want to seniors for best tenor player. Right Winona. He was a banker he was our modest alleging that and I didn't quite get around to that it was in the measure normal stars as well so yeah so this is a guy that. Has been there and he's still doing it as you can hear. And you can come down here and see him in person you know night to meet you know you hate to say the word living legend because it's like you know it's so overused but in this case you know like I said I've talked to horn players and when they heard or saw I was going to be done you know. Whoa. Well the other thing else too is also is not just one players you talk to any positions and the people who have had an opportunity to associate with Phil and play with him when they\n\ntalk about jazz when they talk about jazz in Denver there's a few names that get thrown around and in that small group of names whether you're a young musician or an older these issues they say you talk about jazz you talk about the pillars so and what he means to the soul. Of the jazz legacy and we're very lucky that he has been a resident. There for as long as he has he's OK. We're at 17 minutes after 10 o'clock I'm going to go back up to the bandstand again a reminder that portions of KUVO broadcast are made possible in part by the Coors Brewing Company and its corps literacy pass it on campaign enjoy jazz on KUVO and remember Coors literacy. Pass it on. It's time to take it back up as the bill is now.

Yeah we had a great time that day that was a nice essence and yet of course you guys held down the fort on Sunday nights out there at the Primavera for awhile from of about 14 months gone. Yeah a lot of musicians came by and sat in with you every day risk on the set and then there are a lot of important people it was a great what is banned. Oh yeah. Yeah. Everybody can. Have. A wonderful experience. I mean.\n\nI you know I promised the audience I would I would reminisce just a little bit. Sure and I only want to go back as far as you want to go. And that's cool but we were talk a little bit when we talked on the phone a few days ago about some recordings the other day on the air I think it was Friday I got a chance to play a track that was right you're of course well familiar with him and as part of the Art Pepper Chet Baker legacy and your contributions to to that great recording session it was a track called mine or yours. That was Art Pepper and The album is called Playboy. And done by. The world Pacific. Richard Richard Bach was the producer of course he's the head enchilada. Well you remember those things real easy has it it was Curtis Council's rhythm section. Curtis council tried to launch Marilyn discounts in. A guy that played the piano with his elbow up and they're running the ball Perkins. Carl Perkins and you know I don't know a lot about him he was it or he was part of the Curtis Curtis Council.\n\nBasically what a waste. A West Coast contingent rightmost part of the trumpet player was Jack Sheldon. Jeremy and then Curtis counts Lawrence Marable. And Carl Perkins. And they'd. And. They came up with the idea of a list of Playboys album you know 55 or so for the second time around 56 Yeah. And. They decide to add me in the front line and. They wrote a nice little thing about. Our. Nice thing about Chet. Hart had a long experience more experience on a longer playing and leader Chet and I I said and playing along. Then back with Stan Kasten back in forty eight forty nine and sure like to go back that far but but you know art at that time was being touted as the most talented alto player since Parker one of the most beautiful alto players around that at that time was great and I had a beautiful sound. And could improvise great and just and Reign of Elizabeth and this was before he has problems then me and you know what. Well he had he had some problems with the ladies and he has a problem with drinking if he had some plans with this before did a\n\nstance in other words and yes I'll carry. Yeah and I thought he has to get loosened up in different ways. Right right. We all understand those Sure. So that's nine thousand fifty six. Yeah now when did you go into the studio and record what's been hailed from Downbeat magazine I think it was 55 or 56. The album The philosophy of earth so all that was done 54 and 54. Ozzie Cadena put that together for Savoy. OK ansible support jazz. Yeah they hired Bobby Brook Myra first to get the horn and the right. I went down to hear Miles Davis and asked him if I could use his rhythm section which was composed of the time. Percy Heath and Kenny Clarke and Arsenal were also just one of the child and said hey how about tomorrow night at 6 o'clock you know after I have Miles for mission of course. Sure and that's all that Bobby book my album Long myself first and then the clock ourselves and we went and got a five star down downbeat writers\n\nsure did one that was really something to get it wasn't for the the the original with themselves it was really integration and the feeling of yeah although the actual session the way came off his knee. That's what that's the way the writer said Judy. The rhythm section really made things click you know. Yeah I couldn't do anything. And the charts were nice and easy. Simon. Bobby sounded good. Of course. Firstly he's can talk ourselves of course oh yeah HARAZIM coming on and on his own now as he owes me some money. There's always somebody out there will be here a few turns on that sure. Savoy a bit later on became region I believe. You know that cause. Yes yes that's true. Well the label now is that the Savoy jazz and muse as they are under the ownership of a gentleman named Joe Fields was based out of New Jersey and I once in a while once a year or so I get up to talk with him and I you know feel I've been\n\nafter him for a while now to release that because number one it's out of print. The philosophy of verse on muse on Savoy is out of print and number two. Meaning that it's out of print that means that that you cannot buy it anywhere unless for some reason a collector has it or someone I know you have personally have a copy. I know that I overheard something about five or six maybe eight years ago. That the Japanese bought 25000 copies. And that I know Ozzie Cadena had something to do with it. Right. I know sell 25000 coverage out and give me about 250 bucks or something. Well the name is yeah but anyway that the Japanese have 25000 copies on matters as far as I'm sure Shabab revoke mine the data I mentioned and. Some of the things on there with an organ trio. That I play and I see my other nice things on. And that are all about the album. And it's all very well. And you know well without the Japanese by Sure.\n\nNow right after that by the way if you just joined us filler so is our guest this evening live from multiple to back and fill in his quartet will be up in just a few moments to get into the third set leaving our second set live for the pack were 25 markets come down and join us we'd love to see here tonight indeed is a special honor to have Phil but they are moving on right after that isn't it. Is that when you first met Chet Baker and got on the road or one on I met I met Jeff. Right after mine to. Safety for 55 right when they booked Miles Davis and the Birdman was his quartet. And. Sonny Rollins asked me if he could use my horn to play with my kids. And. Chet was playing already with us friend. Carson. Carson Smith and Bob Dylan. And his quartet and so Jerry Mulligan and to and Chad we're talking at the bar you know. I walk into Gerry. Mulligan and I said. Which introduced me to chest injury chest and I think\n\nhis injuries at this Chet This is Phil Phil says just as I heard a lot of nice things about you. You got your horn you know right away. Sure. Well I got over there in the corner booth you know I love that whole thing. Oh that would have been. The worst thing that could possibly have. Sure but I went up and played two sets with him when the. Electric lights televised on. A few other nice things and 54. Yeah and then he asked me to draw in a row and he wanted to make a change. And we need another piano player because Russ Raymond was going to leave to go to L.A. to do some studio work and decided to stay out there. Sure. We started off down the fence to the two weeks of bird land and finished with the without the piano just like a jury Mulligan sword's not really. A piano and we played all modern arrangements at Slate. Then we got to Detroit. And we picked. Out A. Like pick up a diamond. What a player. And we got\n\nhim accounted for. A year. And then we went back to. Philadelphia picked up Bobby chairmans and then restart. Bobby Timmons Yeah we think you guy was before the law before like you know yes this is a way for art of light hearted heard of them. Yeah just the one that we lobby for Monique Yeah right. And we he we were playing the the show both in Philadelphia. And him and his friend were standing there and. He always said he asked he asked our drummer sick of sands of stoppage I'm sure. Bob is a chaos initial Chet heard him and just was just floored. You know the way he plays it's on going the road and you're sure Phil had all the money and I. Got out of wild guesses. How about Bill 75 to start where then get shipped to hundreds of drake when do we leave. Right after this gig you know the ashes like on Thursday or Friday and Saturday and we're done. Sure. Some. Are following. Levi's. That Sunday or Monday. But Bobby really around and out of her. See I didn't know that I had no idea. Bobby Timmons was with his look at\n\nPanama. City. Bass player was. A Bill Evans. Scott the files come a fall and then Lawrence Marable. Them I checked myself. Sure. I'm going to. Have this swing swing group. So you were with Jeff what 15 15 16 years but on call on stand by OK. Whenever he would check me for five years for. A role the say and have two years off OK and then an hour we would go out three to go to Europe. For it for six months or so. Sure. I understand festivals. Clubs club dates over there so I went to what did you settle into. The Denver area. Actually when I came to Denver in 1957 after he was. On the European. Tour. Once a day for a penalty. That's when he took it towards it. Peter let me. And. My leaving out. They say Oh yeah. James Bond Jimmy Bond\n\nand they went over there in the quartet. And. They when they came back Where then. I joined them I rejoined and again they needed another horn so. I was. I was available. Yeah. It was a it was an experience for the. City experience sure that it was the limit as it. Cut you settlin the Denver the late 60s enders to 57 we had our member July 4th replying over. All that number. Right. I could see the fireworks going in. The night flight. And I just I thought that's how our numbers 57. Sometimes. Think it's. July Fourth and you're originally from where Elizabeth New Jersey. Elizabeth New Jersey. What is it about the Jersey that has produced so many marvelous jazz musicians. There's Hank Mobley there. With us only Kill Bill Evans around Sure sure missions at the heart of that all. Stars jersey seems to be a place where they really come from Detroit to not forget the Detroit effects of this social. Jackson that. Freddie Hubbard. Was facing Zaw magic that when you when you do that this is what\n\nwhat basically is is this was going to be your calling so to speak as a young man you got a chance to get into the city. And here although. I lived in Elizabeth so about 25 minutes. 30 minutes away by bus sure or by train. Or. If you drove and. Don't drive because it's. Not a parking place it's always been that way even in the 30s and 40s. Parking places and most impossible so you go in she had a block square area. Basis treat. Her like. She wanted to go home. All those places. Which I. Like. And they were. There was and I enjoy it. Join us. And to play with those people. There and to be with and then I played last affair for. I got to play with Miles for a few months but then that's a later date. It wasn't what they were that was well it was before. Before check back in 1955. All right around in there. Chad had a. He was over and. Charlie Parker found him sure. You know.\n\nAnd in California and I was in New York playing with Oscar predator and different groups. And. I just got with so many who can't I can't think of. All of them. Chuckling. Kind of for. The Miles Davis thing that came from common sense and said Torrence simply was the biggest thing on the radio in the 50s. New York right. And he took a band up. We did the hi hat in our Boston for two weeks which will The band consists of Kenny Clarke. Percy he's. A No. No piano. M. Jackson myself. JJ and miles. That lasted two weeks and it. Lets you. Down a Baltimore. Song at last too. Yeah it's a phase. And Sid was the emcee and he. Sure he collected all the money to. Hire goodness he was a little bit under the table if you know if you follow me. And Miles and him had a. Scuffle so. He just disbanded at the time was sure. I can't blame him. But when they're not doing. Business with. Honest people. Why continue. You know\n\nand. You know. It makes sense. Yeah that's the kind of person he was and if you didn't know it why. It took. Didn't take very long to find out. It's amazing. That so I want to thank you very much for. Having to go out thank you. And we look forward to your next that the next five minutes or so. All right I will get get my music set all set up. All right. Thank you very much thank you. Thank you both for listening and thank you very much for having me. Cause you're most welcome. Phil or so in our booth here the the second booth probably for the musicians Dor. The. Period eligible to play. That's what if the market up calls Landolin are broadcast as usual continues till 11 o'clock this evening and we're just a few minutes away from having. Philip his quartet back up on the bandstand. If you want to call it that. It's that. It's a permanent.\n\nSemipermanent riser that holds the piano and a drum kit and. CHORUS. The fuse to the base of. The horn players now stand on the floor and say stages that reduced a bit. But tonight we're featuring fillers on tenor and soprano. Along with Andy Weil on piano. And we have on bass Mark diamond and all the drops a fine drummer one of my favorite hysteria. Mr. Chris Leak Oh yeah. ANDREA SEABROOK So kick it. That's all yeah they've got a pretty good stuff. We always have to keep an eye on the microphone stand over there with his gold. Headed out. For you best dad on a surprise one heck of a conversation here at AM but I'm taping it at home so yeah it he was. Phil is an interesting gentleman. Part of living jazz history. That's right. You know was he was telling us he was these cutlasses and stories it's great to\n\nto hear that that's part of the treasure of being able to. Have a few minutes and. You know and we all are benefit from this we all share from the experience of the band. The caliber of musician of pillows all because you don't want to it's gone. You know what's what's people like to live so long as we all do sometimes. Point those are. Our experiences and that. You know lifelong to Shari's and dreams that move on I mean it's like it's like Author Haley in there and you know the whole roots scenario if you if you get a chance to talk to one of your loved ones who it was a little older. And could get you could reminisce a little bit about. Some of the things that happen in your family history that go back 50 60 70 80 years. You better take advantage of all especially from the point of view of someone who was there. Yeah. As opposed to a biographer or a historian I'm sure is going to look at it from that\n\ndispassionate kind of arm's length view. Yeah we're trying to be unbiased and stuff and Phil is a cat who went through it he was there he was and I was living it. That's that's part of the jazz life you know. To be. If if I can use the word indoctrinated I mean when you start getting into jazz and the further you get some stories in here in the music and how the music relates. To you know it's his life he's playing and he's playing the horn. And when you get to hear some of his experiences it gives you a little insight on this play and why he plays and wait while you hear what you hear what else. He's just a treasure that's for sure. So we're real fortunate to have it down here tonight that's for sure. Well there's an old saying at the end. And. In this business a lot of times you have to be lucky to be noticed and to get the opportunity. But you have to be good to last and to make it feel Arsal has certainly proven that he's severely a good thing. And\n\nagain one of these days. I know we talk about it every once in awhile but one of these days we will. Get a copy of the philosophy of our self. Recorded it all in 1954 on the Savoy label and one of the downbeat magazines of five star albums of the year that he has he want to seniors for best tenor player. Right Winona. He was a banker he was our modest alleging that and I didn't quite get around to that it was in the measure normal stars as well so yeah so this is a guy that. Has been there and he's still doing it as you can hear. And you can come down here and see him in person you know night to meet you know you hate to say the word living legend because it's like you know it's so overused but in this case you know like I said I've talked to horn players and when they heard or saw I was going to be done you know. Whoa. Well the other thing else too is also is not just one players you talk to any positions and the people who have had an opportunity to associate with Phil and play with him when they\n\ntalk about jazz when they talk about jazz in Denver there's a few names that get thrown around and in that small group of names whether you're a young musician or an older these issues they say you talk about jazz you talk about the pillars so and what he means to the soul. Of the jazz legacy and we're very lucky that he has been a resident. There for as long as he has he's OK. We're at 17 minutes after 10 o'clock I'm going to go back up to the bandstand again a reminder that portions of KUVO broadcast are made possible in part by the Coors Brewing Company and its corps literacy pass it on campaign enjoy jazz on KUVO and remember Coors literacy. Pass it on. It's time to take it back up as the bill is now. Taking out his tenor saxophone and if you just joined us again as a piano bass along with Chris Lee on drums and Mr. Phil or so on tenor saxophone the filler\n\nQuartet for the 25th market invite you to come on down music until at least midnight tonight.
