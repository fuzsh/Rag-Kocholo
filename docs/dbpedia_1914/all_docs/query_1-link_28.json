        "text": "The obituary is now up online at the Denver Post site:\n\nWorld renowned jazz tenor saxophonist Phil Urso passed away on April 7. Services will be held on Friday, April 11 at 2 PM St Jude Church, Florida and Garrison Street, Lakewood. Phil is survived by his wife Licia (Bruna), daughter Stephanie, son in law Chris, and grandchildren Luke and Hannah.\n\nPublished in the Denver Newspaper Agency on 4/9/2008.\n\nDenver Post\n\nGuest Book\n\nMarc Myers' mention of Phil's friendship with Gerry Mulligan in the Elliot Lawrence Orchestra has led me to another of Phil's solos in my record collection. It's on the Lawrence band's version of Mulligan's \"Elevation\", recorded on April 13 1949. I have it on a CBS LP called Gerry Mulligan: the Arranger.\n\n\"When a Japanese dive-bomber crashed onto the deck of his aircraft carrier near Saipan in 1943, Phil was hurled into the ocean, managing to avoid burning fuel and wreckage\".\n\nWow - when you think of it, even to have a musical career after this was something of a miracle."
