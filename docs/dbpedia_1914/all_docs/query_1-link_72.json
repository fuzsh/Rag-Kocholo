In particular, the variety of harmonies and meters employed with a careful use of dynamics does not betray the trio’s classical academic studies. They generate atmospheres which are rarefied and intense at the same time, while respecting a basic organicity throughout the leader’s various compositions – as happens to the very particular interpretations of Newman or of the Tears For Fears, without forgetting Glass.\n\nThe trio’s interplay and the various thematic improvisations lead back the album’s patterns to the environment of jazz , without ever sacrificing their scoring, which is central for the themes and developments of certain compositions. This is the case of 41th Championship (ironically titled) or in the final End Of The Summer, whose mood is evocative and conclusive, dedicated to the end of a season, as a metaphor for life.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nArtist(s)\n\nGiuseppe Urso: Musician, composer, arranger and conductor, Giuseppe Urso, a native of Palermo, Italy, has earned the highest grade in symphonic percussion and jazz music with the highest marks with honors.\n\nIn his career he has mixed experiences in various musical contexts: from big bands to symphony orchestras, many projects as a leader and many projects as a leader and as a sideman performing with Phil Woods, Cedar Walton, Vince Mendoza, Clark Terry, Arturo Sandoval, Dave Liebman, Patti Austin, Rachel Ferrell, Billy Childs, Diane Schuur, Phil Woods, Toots Thielemans, Noa, Jack Walrath, Dave Kikoski, Eumir Deodato, Tigran Hamasyan, Bill Carrothers, Bobby Watson, Ernie Watts, Emil Richards, Joe Porcaro, Martial Solal, Less Mc Cann, Wayne Bergeron, Darren Barrett, John Serry and many other international artists.\n\nHe is present in numerous recordings some of which as a leader and composer, receiving acknowledgments from the specialized critic.
