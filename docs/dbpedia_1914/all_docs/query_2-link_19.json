        "text": "4 LPs plus 2 tracks on 2 CDs\n\nDOUBLE CD\n\nHI-FI\n\n24 BIT\n\nDIGITALLY REMASTERED\n\nPhil Urso (1925-2008) was an excellent tenor saxophonist mainly known through his various recordings with Chet Baker. Before their first album together in 1956, jazz fans first noticed Urso in 1949 after his solos on Elevation and Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea with Elliot Lawrence s orchestra. By 1953, he merited serious consideration as one of the most consistently rewarding of the younger tenors. His tone and approach was in the Lester Young-and-second-line tradition, but he had his own identifiable voice. He also was one of the few white musicians Miles Davis could accept, and a swinger who could adapt imaginatively to all tempos. In his own words, I played a little more dark, and Miles liked that.\n\nThis CD collection contains all his recordings from 1953 to 1959, as a leader or featured guest point in case, his work on baritone, in addition to his usual tenor with the Jomar Dagron quintet. You will hear Urso playing with such musicians as Walter Bishop Jr, Bob Brookmeyer, Horace Silver, Kenny Clarke, Bobby Timmons, Ron Washington, Bobby Banks, and as a bonus his album with the Oscar Pettiford new jazz sextet. They show a player of real stature enough for Chet Baker to tell him (in a letter in 1971) I have always felt you were and are the most underrated of America s jazz players and composers."
