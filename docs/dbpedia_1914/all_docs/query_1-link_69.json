        "text": "Having teamed up on two prior Pacific Jazz recordings, trumpeter Chet Baker & alto saxophonist Art Pepper continued their fruitful collaboration with the supremely swinging 1956 album Picture of Heath (which was originally released as Playboys until Hugh Hefner objected). The sextet for the session was brimming with top talent from the West Coast Jazz scene including tenor saxophonist Phil Urso, pianist Carl Perkins, bassist Curtis Counce, and drummer Larance Marable. A notable feature of the date was its focus on the compositions of saxophonist Jimmy Heath who penned five of the album’s tracks: “Picture of Heath,” “For Miles and Miles,” “C.T.A.,” “For Minors Only,” and “Resonant Emotions.” The set is rounded out by two of Pepper’s tunes—“Minor-Yours” and “Tynan Tyme”—and the playing throughout is unfailingly vibrant with exquisite solos and lively band interplay all of which which makes this a quintessential cool jazz date.\n\nExcluded from sitewide sales/discounts. Limited to 4 per customer."
