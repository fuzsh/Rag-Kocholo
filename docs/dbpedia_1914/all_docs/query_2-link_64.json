        "text": "Artt Frank\n\n\"In my estimation, other then Charlie Parker, Chet was the greatest lyrical player of all time. And like 'Bird', Chet could say more in a four-bar phrase than any one I've ever heard!\"\n\n-- Artt Frank\n\nStyle | Philosophy | Future Plans | Discography | Quotes and Comments | Web Links | Sound Samples\n\n* * * FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE * * *\n\nLos Angeles, CA (PRWEB) February 20, 2014\n\nJazz Hall of Fame Drummer’s Memoir Captures Missing Years With Trumpeter Chet Baker\n\nIndependent publisher, BooksEndependent, LLC today announced the release of the personal, never before told story of “Chet Baker: The Missing Years, A Memoir by Artt Frank,” available in both trade paperback and Kindle Edition eBook. Foreword by Bobby Shew.\n\nArtt's book is now available through Amazon.com.\n\n\"A must-read for everyone from the casual jazz fan to the serious student of jazz history. - JB Dyas, PhD, VP, Education and Curriculum Development, Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz\"\n\nArtt is an inductee to the Jazz Hall of Fame! Please read the acceptance letter.\n\n\"Artt Frank is one of the most consistently decent and creative people I have ever met. He is legendary in his humanity. It is thrilling that he is being inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame and my family and I are simply over the moon that this is happening for him.\"\n\nInternationally Acclaimed Actress, Sharon Stone\n\nHall of Fame Bop drummer/composer/lyricist/vocalist Artt Frank was born in the small paper mill town of Westbrook, Maine on March 9, 1933, and is best known for his long-term association with trumpet immortal Chet Baker, with whom he worked on and off for 14 years. Artt has also been associated with an impressive list of jazz luminaries over the past sixty years including the great Charlie Parker, Tadd Dameron, Dexter Gordon, Sonny Stitt, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, singer Billie Holiday and many others. Artt is also an ex-professional fighter.\n\nARTT FRANK, bop drummer/composer, is part of a dying breed -one of the few authentic bop musicians on the scene today. He is best known for his long term association with Chet Baker, with whom Artt worked on and off for 14 years. He has also worked with Jimmy Heath, Al Cohn, Ted Curson, Sonny Stitt, Phil Moore and many others, including one memorable night with Billie Holiday. He has also sat in on several occasions with Charlie Parker, Lee Morgan, Tadd Dameron, Dexter Gordon and Bud Powell. Artt is 100% ear player who plays from the seat of his pants. He listens intently to his band mates and responds with lightning quickness, utilizing appropriate shading and perfect placement. His dynamics, especially on brushes, are most engaging. He really generates both spark and fire. When he uses sticks, you know immediately that he's a pure bebop drummer whose roots run deep. And he locks in the time by bearing down forcefully on his hi-hat on the after beat, which produces the sensation of continued forward propulsion. On occasion he'll throw in unpredictable, yet perfectly placed bass drum bombs against the ride cymbal- then shifts seamlessly to left hand accents on the snare. His four limbs are seemingly independent and yet the effect is like an unbroken chain of movement that both supports and fashions itself around the soloist.\n\nStyle\n\n\"Since I play a hundred percent by ear, I respond pretty much to what is going on around me. I know who I am, whom I've played with, and what I have come through, so it isn't like I have to sit down behind a set of drums and let the other musicians hear how I play. They know from the very first hit on the snare that I am authentic be-bop.\n\n\"The conditions I grew up in, the musicians, the clubs, the owners, they don't exist any more. I am part of a dying breed. All those wonderful cats I used to play with are gone, but they're still very much alive in my heart and when I'm sitting alone in my room thinking about those good old times, I can actually hear Bird, Tadd, Dexter, Bud and Chet. Yeah man, the mind is a beautiful place.\n\n\"I have had no formal musical training to build on, which in a sense limits what I can do musically. I learned to draw a circle around my limitations and became the master of that circle, and I never think of what I'm going to play, or where I'm going to place a beat or an accent or drop a bass drum bomb. It just happens, it's what Charlie Parker called placement. That's what he said I had naturally, good time and natural placement.\n\n\"Drummers of today have arsenals of technique and fantastic chops. Just about every one of them are monsters. But technique, however astonishing it may be, is meaningless unless you can tell your own personal story, like Bird said: \"Man, if you ain't lived it you can't really play it\". Techniques and chops are essential, but if these are not applied in the proper place within the framework of a given tune, it will upset the time and rhythm and throw everything off kilter. Drummers should develop their ears and learn to be more sympathetic and supportive toward the soloist. Time, rhythm, and placement are the most essential tools in bop drumming. As to my approach, I play just on the backside of the beat giving the time that special laid back sensation of push and pull, no matter what the tempo may be. Bop drumming is unique because it has its own personal identity. It cannot be mistaken for swing, Dixieland, free or fusion. Bebop is more than just a style of jazz. It's a feeling and sound from a moment in time that no longer exists, except on recordings. This is the era from which I came.\n\n\"Whenever I play -- in a nightclub, concert hall, museum, or recording studio; whether I'm playing my own compositions or those of the greats of the past -- I always seek to bring out what I refer to as the three P's: pain, pathos, and poignancy. I tell musicians, when you find these... you've found the heart, body and soul of the composition; the very essence of life. That's what it's really all about. The immortals of bop; Bird, Miles, Tadd, Monk, Dex, Bud, Ritchie, Sonny Rollins, Sonny Stitt, Lee, Fats, Chet and the other pioneers; all of them had these three P's within their daily lives -- and that is what made their sound so warm and lyrically great. They lived what they played!\"\n\nPhilosophy\n\n\"My whole philosopy of music is to build a spiritual unity in sound. If an audience becomes a part of that unity, if only for a few minutes, then I have accomplished what I have set out to do. This is my way of sharing with others all the wonderful gifts that GOD has bestowed upon me. In my compositions, this unity is expressed through lyricism. A melody that can be understood, felt and shared is a very powerful thing as is the sharing that we show in love for one another - a spiritual unity coming down from, and ascending up to the FATHER of LIGHTS who gives it continuously when you ask.\"\n\nFuture Plans\n\n\"Only God knows what my future holds. I want to continue to compose meaningful music, such as haunting ballads, jazz waltz, sambas, and God willing I shall. I also hope to record more CD's and do live jazz concerts, as well as to help budding jazz musicians with promise to gain important exposure, and to the best of my ability love everyone, as YESHUA commanded, and to be there for any one who may need me.\"\n\nDiscography\n\nThe Artt Frank Jazz Ensemble -- \"In The Moment\", 2004\n\nThis swinging CD was recorded in early Spring 2004 and introduces seven new original compositions by Artt and co-composer Graham Bruce.\n\nArtt Frank, drums; Harold Danko, piano; Phil Bowler, bass; Graham Bruce, trumpet / flugelhorn; Ken Barry, tenor sax; Matt Criscuolo, alto sax; with guest artists Tony Lombardozzi, guitar; vocalists Giacomo Gates and Yvonne Kauffman; and Earla Porch.\n\nThe music on this CD is straight ahead authentic bop. \"The whole concept behind this,\" according to Artt, \"was to recapture the long, lost sound and personal intimacy of playing in the small cramped nightclubs of the late '40's and early '50's around New York City, and bring it to lilfe on recording. To do that, I had to find a smalll studio with good acoustics, and which had no isolated booths or baffles. I found such a place but there were drawbacks. The studio didn't have a piano. I wanted that special ambiance, so I had an upright piano brought in and had it placed in the center of the room and had each musician stand close beside it, with the bass and drums just a few feet away. We didn't rehearse the tunes because I wanted everything to be spontaneous -- as it would be in a club setting. I kicked off each tune and these cats just smoked! Every tune was done in a single take except for the Matt Criscuolo composition, 'Julian,' which was done in the second take.\n\n\"Listening to the playback, I was absolutely pleased with the musicianship and the results. I achieved what I wanted... that warm-up-close and personal sound of being in a small New York City jazz club of the past, and playing, In The Moment!\"\n\nThough he cannot read a single note of music, Artt has composed nearly 50 beautiful songs beginning with a jazz waltz called \"Waltz For Sharon Stone,\" which is now a popular CD. When asked how he was able to accomplish this without his having any knowledge of how to read music, he replied that he believed it was because of his deep love and faith in almighty GOD and YESHUA (Jesus) that he was given the wonderful gift to create beautifullly haunting melodies. \"There is just no other answer,\" he said.\n\nArtt went on to say that he composes music by humming the melody into a recorder, then sends it to his pianist friends and co-composers, Charles Loos, Nic Bariluk, Graham Bruce, Harold Danko, Matt Criscuolo, Phil Urso, Ken Barry, and most recently, Rob Boone. Artt's melodies fall into the category of romantic jazz, and a number of them would be ideal for motion picture soundtrack themes. He feels very strongly that he was put on earth to play drums and to write beautiful romantic music. And, God willing, he will.\n\nCOMPOSITIONS TO DATE BY ARTT FRANK Always Together (ballad) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Arttwork (bop) Artt Frank / Nic Bariluk A Few Bucks Ahead (bop) Artt Frank / Nic Bariluk Afterglow Of Love (ballad) Artt and Lisa Frank / Graham Bruce Ali (ballad) Lisa and Artt Frank / Charles Loos Brothers (ballad) Artt and Lisa Frank / Graham Bruce Bru's Waltz (jazz waltz) Artt Frank / Rob Boone Brosamba (samba) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Carol Ann (ballad) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Casa de Cisne (House of Swan) (the marriage samba) Artt Frank /\n\nGraham Bruce\n\nChristmastime All Year (romantic Christmas ballad) Artt Frank / Nic Bariluk / Tony Purrone Dave and Iola (ballad) Artt Frank / Rob Boone Does It Matter (ballad) Artt Frank / Harold Danko Don't Cry When You Lose (ballad) Artt Frank / Earla Frank 18th and Vine (bop) Artt Frank / Chris Clarke Eyes Of A Child (ballad) Lisa and Artt Frank / Graham Bruce For Pete's Sake (bop) Artt Frank / Rob Boone Great Scott (calypso) Artt and Lisa Frank / Graham Bruce It's Over Now (ballad) Artt Frank / Earla Frank Jack and Lucille (romantic jazz waltz) Artt Frank / Matt Criscuolo\n\nJim's Song (bop) Artt Frank / Warren Chiasson\n\nKathy's Groove (samba) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Kelly's Hope (ballad) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Keeping Bebop Alive (bop) Artt Frank / Nic Bariluk Leah's Waltz (jazz waltz) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Lisa Lea (jazz waltz) Artt Frank / Nic Bariluk Liebway (Bop) Artt Frank / Phil Urso / Graham Bruce Lonely Walk -- Memories of Chet (sad ballad) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Love and Spaghetti (jazz waltz) Artt Frank / Nic Bariluk Lullaby for Roan (classical) Artt Frank / Matt Criscuolo Most of All (bop) Artt Frank / Rob Boone Nenette (jazz waltz) Artt Frank / Ken Barry On The Heath (bop) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce\n\nRefuge (sad ballad) Artt Frank / Joe Cartwright Rhonda Joy (jazz waltz) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Rob and The Cradle (bop) Artt Frank / Rob Boone\n\nSamba En Volandros (\"Samba In The Air\") Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Samba Jan (samba) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Sam Is The Most (bop) Artt Frank / Rob Boone Saundering (samba / bossa) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Song For My Mother (sad ballad) Artt Frank / Nic Bariluk Seventh Day (ballad) Artt Frank / Nic Bariluk Shirley (ballad) Artt Frank / Nic Bariluk Sisters (jazz waltz) Artt Frank / Nic Bariluk Sonny And Lucille (samba) Artt Frank / Rob Boone\n\nSonnyside Up (bop) Artt Frank / Rob Boone\n\nSouvenir (sad ballad) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce That's Matt (bop) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce The Scene's McLean (bop) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce\n\nWaitin' For Clayton (bop) Artt Frank / Ken Barry Waltz For Bert (jazz waltz) Artt Frank / Graham Bruce Waltz For Sharon Stone (jazz waltz) Artt and Lisa Frank / Charles Loos Winter In July (bossa nova) Artt and Lisa Frank / Nic Bariluk\n\nThat Trio Thing -- Released in 2003 by MJA Records\n\nJoe Cartwright, piano; Steve Rigazzi, bass; Artt Frank, drums\n\nThis CD was recorded on two separate occasions in Overland Park, Kansas, by tenor saxophonist / engineer Ken Barry, in the early summer of 2001, and completed in the late spring of 2002, when Artt returned to the area.\n\nThree new tunes are introduced: \"Refuge,\" a haunting ballad that reflects on the tragedy of 9/11, written by Artt and Joe; \"Brosamba,\" a dark samba, by Artt and trumpeter Graham Bruce; and \"Unit VI,\" by Joe for his son.\n\nJOE CARTWRIGHT on the making of the CD: \"This unique trio CD was recorded in a small piano recital hall as opposed to a recording studio. There was very little preparation and no rehearsal whatsoever. The sessions were very relaxed and loose, no pressure. This method of recording really emphasizes spontaneity and empathy. This is truly the essence of jazz.\n\n\"Artt's drum concept for this recording was to use brushes exclusively. It is rare to find a drummer that has such a wide range of colors and shading in his dynamic palette. Artt creates a masterpiece each time he paints with his brushes. He accomplishes this while swinging intensely. Artt, you are a master.\"\n\nSTEVE RIGAZZI on the making of the CD: \"Artt's suggestion for this CD was to record, as he put it, 'without the use of a net.' Artt wanted us to do it virtually unrehearsed and completely fresh, which is exactly what we did. The interaction between the players; the dynamics and execution is what makes this recording unique. Artt speaks volumes with every swish of his brushes. Man, he can make a rusty gate swing!\"\n\nARTT FRANK on the making of the CD: \"Over the last fifty or so years I've been a part of some of the greatest rhythm sections ever formed and I must tell you, working with Joe Cartwright and Steve Rigazzi, is as good as it gets! The interplay between each of us.... The dynamics, rhythm, the point / counterpoint and shading -- it was uncanny, like we'd been together for years, instead of two nights, nine months apart. I sent my old friend, Dave Brubeck, a copy of the rough mix and he really liked it. He even wrote something about Joe and Steve. He felt they were very gifted musicians. You know what? I do too!\"\n\nThe Artt Frank Quartet Live at the Aldrich Museum, Sweetheart Records, recorded in 1998.\n\nArtt Frank, drums; Harold Danko, piano; Cameron Brown, bass and Rich Perry, tenor sax.\n\nThis concert marked the historical reunion of three world class jazz musicians who hadn't played together in twenty-three years since working together with Chet Baker. Artt Frank, Harold Danko and Cameron Brown -- by Chet's own admission, the most potent rhythm section he had ever worked with.\n\nPat Morrissey / Artt Frank: Souvenir, released in 1999, MJA Records label\n\nThis CD was recorded in early 1999, and features some of Artt's original compositions along with new arrangements of standards that were favorites of Chet Baker.\n\nPat Morrissey, who has recently passed away and will be deeply missed by his friends, relatives, and fans, plays trumpet, along with Ken Barry on tenor sax and flute, his wife Kathy Frank playing drums on one selection, pianist Harold Danko, and bassist Phil Bowler: Harold, Phil, and Artt were one of Chet's favorite rhythm sections to work with.\n\nArtt Frank notes, \"Ken's playing is so reminiscent of Chet Baker, even though Chet played trumpet and flugelhorn, the similarity in their playing is astounding when you consider that Chet always played with simplicity, yet with so much great lyricism -- and he blew the greatest long tones of anyone in jazz history. When listening to Chet and Ken's playing, you seem to be carried constantly upward, as an eagle soars on a thermal draft. Chet, I feel, would have absolutely loved to have played in ensemble with Kenny because Chet always loved to have someone of equal lyrical ability to play counterpoint with. As an example, listen to Kenny's poignant lines on my Souvenir.\"\n\nArtt Frank presents Chris Clarke -- \"From The Heart\", MJA RECORDS -- Recorded in Kansas City, Mo. in 2000\n\nThis CD presents Artt's latest discovery -- jazz pianist Chris Clarke, and also showcases several wonderfully talented Kansas City musicians as well.\n\nTim Perryman, trombone; Gerald Dunn, alto sax; Josh Sclar, tenor sax; the late great Pat Morrissey, trumpet; James Ward and Tyrone Clark, bass; Donivan Bailey, Mike Warren, and Artt Frank, drums; Tommy Stewart, percussion; and mainstay of the Artt Frank ensemble, Ken Barry, tenor sax and soprano sax.\n\nThis CD features three of Artt's latest compositions. A pure bop tune entitled \"18th and Vine,\" which pays honor to Kansas City's historic jazz district. Melody and lyrics by Artt and the harmonic chord changes were written by Chris Clarke. Artt also pays tribute to the former wife of Bill Evans, Nenette. The jazz waltz, \"Nenette,\" was co-written by son-in-law Ken Barry and his wife (Artt's daughter) Kathy Frank-Barry, and Lisa L. Frank.\n\nWaltz for Sharon Stone, Released in 1998, a jazz ensemble, MJA Records label\n\nThis is a showcase for six of Artt's original compositions. The title track pays honor to the famous actress for her charitable work at Planet Hope, an organization that helps the homeless.\n\nThis music is straight ahead romantic jazz, with a highly textured rich sound that includes renowned Viennese violinist Rudy Berger, tenor sax player Rich Perry, flutist Ali Ryerson, pianist co-composer Nik Bariluk, bassist Phil Bowler and Matt Criscuolo on alto sax.\n\nTwo Legends Of Bop -- due for release in 2003\n\nThis CD is a live jazz performance recorded in New Haven, Connecticut sponsored by Jazz Haven, a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of jazz. Featuring co-leaders Artt Frank and saxophonist, composer/educator and leader of the Woody Herman Big Band, Frank Tiberi. Other musicians include renowned pianist Harold Danko and the incredible bassist, Phil Bowler.\n\nLooking for the Light, a Tribute to Chet Baker - Recorded in 1993\n\nThis CCB CD features favorite tunes, of Chet and the sparkling Chet Baker rhythm section of the 80's. Dave Liebman plays brilliant soprano sax, along with Artt, Phil Markowitz on piano, Dennis Irwin on bass and Billy Dowling on trumpet.\n\nChet Baker Live at Buffalo, CCB RECORDS, 1984\n\nChet Baker, trumpet; Sal Nistico, tenor sax; Lorne Lofsky, guitar; Artt Frank, drums and Chris Connors, bass. Recorded at the Renaissance II in 1984.\n\nArtt Frank Quartet, Dig Records, 1979\n\nSteve Veikley, trumpet; Ed Fiarenza, tenor sax; Mike Dooner, piano; Artt Frank, drums and Bruce Gertz, bass.\n\nCCB RECORDS plans to release a number of live performance recordings of Chet with Artt on drums, beginning with Chet's historical comeback performance in Hollywood, Ca. in 1968. These will be known as The HISTORIC / ARCHIVAL SERIES -- truly a collectors item.\n\nChet Baker Quartet, \"Burnin' at Backstreet\" -- CCB RECORDS, 1980\n\nChet Baker, trumpet, vocal; Drew Salperto, piano; Artt Frank, drums; Mike Formanek, bass. Recorded live at the Club Backstreet in 1980\n\nChet's solo work is awesomely incredible -- pure bop playing. He and Artt are on fire -- both are smokin'! It's like a world tennis championship match -- Artt serves and Chet vollies, and vice versa. Chet's opening statement on \"Stella by Starlight\" has to be considered by far... the most creative run of notes in the history of jazz... and Artt's brushwork seethes: at the same time, sensitive and supportive. He knows precisely when and where to push Chet. Great CD!!\n\nSome of the musicians with whom Artt has performed in the past 57 years:\n\nRoy Ayers\n\nCurtis Amy\n\nChet Baker\n\nJoe Beck\n\nPepper Adams\n\nRudi Berger\n\nPhil Bowler\n\nBob Bowman\n\nJoshua Breakstone\n\nCameron Brown\n\nChris Brubeck\n\nLenny Breaux\n\nHayes Burnette\n\nGraham Bruce\n\nKen Barry\n\nJoe Cartwright\n\nBuck Clayton\n\nWarren Chiasson\n\nAl Cohn\n\nJoe Cohn\n\nSerge Chaloff\n\nPaul Carlon\n\nMatt Criscuolo\n\nChris Connors\n\nTed Curson\n\nHank Crawford\n\nChris Clarke\n\nTadd Dameron\n\nHarold Danko\n\nMiles Davis\n\nSteve Davis\n\nFrank DelaRosa\n\nJoe Di Orio\n\nDon Doane\n\nLou Donaldson\n\nMike Dooner\n\nDavid Dyson\n\nNapua Davoy\n\nMario Escandera\n\nBill Evans\n\nCarl Fontana\n\nRoy Frazee\n\nMike Formanek\n\nJoe Farrell\n\nJeff Fuller\n\nDexter Gordon\n\nJoe Gordon\n\nSlim Gaillard\n\nHal Galper\n\nJimmy Gannon\n\nGiacomo Gates\n\nBruce Gertz\n\nJimmy Heath\n\nBillie Holiday\n\nRichard ‘Groove’ Holmes\n\nJoe Henderson\n\nStephen Houben\n\nRoni Ben Hur\n\nDennis Irwin\n\nCarmell Jones\n\nJ J Johnson\n\nSheila Jordan\n\nTeddy Kotick\n\nHarold Land\n\nDave Liebman\n\nJoe Lano\n\nBrad Leali\n\nScott Lee\n\nHerbie Lewis\n\nSabby Lewis\n\nTravis Jenkins\n\nCharlie Jennison\n\nPete Levy\n\nTony Lombardozzi\n\nLorne Lofsky\n\nCharles Loos\n\nMax Lucas\n\nFrank Luther\n\nPeter Madson\n\nPhil Markowitz\n\nSam Most\n\nRon McClure\n\nThelonius Monk\n\nWes Montgomery\n\nPhil Moore III\n\nLee Morgan\n\nMike Metheny\n\nPat Morrissey\n\nBob Mover\n\nGerry Mulligan\n\nMike Musallame\n\nSal Nistico\n\nHod O’Brien\n\nCharlie Parker\n\nKing Pleasure\n\nMoacyr Pexoto\n\nEarla Porch\n\nJacques Pelzer\n\nArt Pepper\n\nRich Perry\n\nBill Plummer\n\nBud Powell\n\nRichie Powell\n\nJoe Puma\n\nTony Purrone\n\nMike Ridley\n\nScott Robinson\n\nFrank Rossolino\n\nAli Ryerson\n\nMike Robinowitz\n\nSteve Rigazzi\n\nDrew Salperto\n\nDavid Schnitter\n\nSal Salvatore\n\nGray Sargent\n\nJack Stella\n\nCarl Saunders\n\nThornel Schwartz\n\nZoot Simms\n\nCarson Smith\n\nAlbert Stimpson\n\nGerald Spaits\n\nSonny Stitt\n\nFrank Strazzeri\n\nIra Sullivan\n\nRandy Sandke\n\nPeter Smith\n\nFrank Tiberi\n\nPhil Urso\n\nMiraslav Vitous\n\nLeroy Vinegar\n\nSteve Veikley\n\nBenny Waters\n\nGillian Ward\n\nLee Weisman\n\nPhil Wilson\n\nMichael Weiss\n\nLester Young\n\nQuotes and Comments\n\n\"Artt Frank looks insistently forward with energy, breaking the shackles of musical restraints. He's a hard swinger, with tons of experience and tradition which equal total artistry every time he sits behind a drum set. What a vivid drummer and jazz pace setter! Few can match Artt Frank for the sheer beauty of his compositions. He is setting new standards-both as a composer and drummer-which mark him as a unique jazz artist and legend. This man is a gift to jazz!\" Tim Price -- Saxophone Journal, and Jazz Artist -author and clinician\n\n\"Artt is the real shit, man. His groove is so rooted!\" Phil Markowitz, jazz pianist\n\n\"Artt Frank is one of those few cats who 'play in the moment.'\" Warren Chaisson, vibraphonist\n\n\"You're a little raw -- but you got good time and you know where to put things (accents, fills) -- placement.\" Charlie Parker on Artt's drumming at age 17 at the Royal Roost Club in NYC, 1949: and, \"Yeah... yeah... Now you're sweepin' the store clean, man!\" Charlie Parker on Artt's drumming two years later, NYC, 1951\n\n\"You go upstairs, you go downstairs... No matter where you go musically, Artt's playing is always in the pocket!\" Al Cohn, legendary tenor saxophonist\n\n\"Artt's the egg that holds the mix together.\" Phillip Moore III, jazz pianist / composer\n\n\"You play so sensitively, man. You'll do just fine. Just fine.\" Comments made by Billie Holiday to Artt on the memorable night he worked with her in 1955\n\n\"Artt's a pure bop drummer. Plain and simple. He's for real, man.\" Harold Danko, jazz pianist / composer / educator\n\n\"Artt Frank is a metronomic monster back there - he becomes one with the drum kit.\" Herb Snitzer, former Metronome & Downbeat vice president\n\n\"Artt Frank is a drummer who is felt rather than heard. Knowing how to whisper and precisely when to shout. Engaging!\" Leonard Feather, jazz writer and critic\n\n\"Smokin' Smokin' Smokin'! Artt creates both spark and fire, man!\" Sal Nistico on Artt's drumming\n\n\"Artt's brushwork is seething, pulsating, threadneedle, engaging. His stickwork, driving, pulling and explosive, He's very compelling to see and hear.\" Edward Marquez, Entertainment News, West Los Angeles\n\n\"Artt really stirs the soup back there.\" Jimmy Heath, legendary composer, player\n\n\"Artt is the drummer's drummer. Give Artt a pair of brushes or sticks and he'll make a garbage can cover sound like the most expensive snare drum. This cat swings.\" Teddy Kotick, former bassist with Charlie Parker, Horace Silver and Bill Evans, and two years with Artt Frank's quintet\n\n\"Artt's drumming is totally unique compared to the drummers of today simply because he is a product of the bop era and that affords him absolute credibility.\" Giacomo Gates, recording artist\n\n\"Artt Frank's drumming is most engaging and compelling.\" Fred Buchard, Downbeat Magazine\n\n\"Geez.............this is wonderful music. Thank you very much. I told Michelle after about 2 seconds that it was you on drums. No question. I love your energy and committment.........and the way you bring the best out of your brothers. What a thang!\" Bassist Dennis Woodrich\n\n\"The drummer in any jazz group is a pivotal figure. He must be aware of melody, rhythm, dynamics, timbre, structure. He must be supportive and sensitive to the mood of others in the group, and ready to erupt when it is his turn to solo. Artt Frank, a veteran bop drummer, who has played with such monumental jazz artists as Charlie Parker, Sonny Stitt, Bud Powell, and Chet Baker has given students of drumming a complete guide in how to master the subtlities of that pivotal role, and still swing.\n\n'When hearing you play on, \"That Trio Thing,\" your playing was swinging yet unobtrusive! It reminded me of a time when Chet was having some trouble with his teeth and only played a few tunes on trumpet but sang wonderfully on some other songs. Again, you were very supportive. Because Chet was singing quite softly, it was amazing that you could swing so quietly behind him. Some very good percussionists can't or don't want to come down in volume, and if forced to,they seem to lose interest in what they are doing. I hope your health allows you to continue to play \"in your own sweet way.\" Jazz legend Dave Brubeck\n\n\"Artt Frank is a phenomenon... a musician who was and is an essential element in the development of a distinctive jazz style. Remarkably, he is still playing with passion and energy, listening and creating with his fellow musicians and responding to their ideas with lightning reflexes and tasteful support!\" Chris Brubeck\n\n\"Artt is the real deal-the feel, hits, kicks, most of all the touch. He represents a way of playing that goes to the heart of jazz drumming which is to support and enhance the soloist. Artt is living history.\" David Liebman\n\n\"Artt's playing is so driving, fresh and 'in the moment' that it seems as though he conceived the idea a millesecond before its played. Its not in the least predictable!\" Saxophonist Matt Criscuolo\n\n\"Artt is one of those unsung heros of the be bop era. He's an authentic bop drummer, who- without any formal education- knows all the ins and outs of this particular style. The music pours out of his heart- He's a great time-keeper, someone who can make a dead man wiggle his toes. His beat pushes the music forwards constantly, without speeding up the tempo. And while doing all that, he's able to react on anything that's happening around him. He can be firm with the sticks and subtle with the brushes, but also subtle with sticks and firm with brushes; he can swing without making a lot of noise, without raising his voice. All this made him the drummer Chet Baker loved to work with when he started his comeback around 1969.\"Jeroen de Valk, \"Chet Baker, his life and his music\"-Berkeley Hills Books\n\n\"It's great that Artt Frank has put his thoughts and ideas on jazz music and drumming into a book. Its important for the next generation to be able to share the experience and knowledge Artt had accumulated in his many years as a sensitive and swinging jazz artist.\" Dave Stryker, jazz guitarist\n\nBebop was never about the notes, recalls noted drummer -- Article in the Oct. 26th 2006 Tucson Citizen\n\n\"Artt Frank is one of the last of the 'real deal bebop drummers...a living treasure .\"\n\n- Terri Lyne Carrington\n\n\"I always learn something from listening to and watching Artt play. The thing that comes through his music for me is the strength of his heart, playing for all he's worth.\"\n\n- Todd Strait\n\n\"In the near future, few people will have the opportunity to see or study with those individuals whom I would call the real masters of jazz drumming. There are many great players today, but almost all lack the real credentials which include recording/performing with the legendary musicians responsible for creating jazz. Artt Frank fits all these criteria.\"\n\n- Darren Lyons of Darren Lyons Quartet\n\n\"Artt's dynamics and ability to keep bands swinging, while at the same time not overpowering the soloist, are some of the techniques he demonstrates, while sharing from his vast experience as a session and live player.\"\n\n- Aynsley Dunbar\n\n\"Artt's concept touches on an essential part of music-making - using the ear as well as the source for sound and ideas. Artt's playing embodies these principles, and reminds us that ear chops is the greatest technique a drummer can posses to realize truly creative playing.\"\n\n- Jeff Brillinger, drummer for Chet Baker, John Pattitucci, Ken Peplowski\n\n\"If anyone has inherited Chet's musical soul, I would say it is Artt Frank.\"\n\n- Ali Ryerson, Jazz Flutist for Billy Taylor, Kenny Barron, Stephane Grappelli, Art Farmer, Joe Beck\n\n\"Artt Frank doesn't just play drums: he plays music!\"\n\n- Stan Levey\n\n\"Drummer Artt Frank embodies a certain spirit...a love of melodic, swinging music which is the very essence of Jazz.\"\n\n- Steve Davis, Jazz Trombonist (Art Blakey, Jackie McLean, Chick Corea)\n\n\"Artt is the master of the lost art of swinging hard while at the same time playing soft. He's always there supporting you but his playing never impinges upon your consciousness to distract you from soloing.\"\n\n- Hal Galper, Jazz Pianist (Chet Baker, Cannonball Adderly, Phil Woods, Johnny Hodges, Art Blakey)\n\n\"Artt Frank is an extraordinary musician - a consummate bop drummer whose strong pulse can always be felt by the groups in which he performs; yet his sensitivity keeps him from overwhelming the ensemble's music. This combination of strength and delicacy has made him a favorite with many outstanding leaders, most notably Chet Baker, but also Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Sonny Stitt and Dexter Gordon.\"\n\n- William Gottlieb, World-Renowned Jazz Photographer\n\n\"Artt Frank is right in the forefront among those innovators like Max Roach and Art Blakey. Anyone who could remain so long with such a discriminating musician as Chet Baker better be damn good.\"\n\n- Herman Leonard, World-Renowned Jazz Photographer\n\n\"Artt Frank is a rare breed of natural musicians. He was born with a sense of swing and sensitivity.\"\n\n- Bruce Gertz, Jazz Bassist (Gil Evans, Dave Brubeck, Lee Konitz, Joe Lovano, Danilo Perez, and Professor, Berklee School of Music, Boston)\n\n\"Artt, great website. Full of artistry and magic. I have always been a total Chet Baker-Artt Frank fan. Nobody can play the brushes with the soul as you. Your spirituality and love of life is uplifting. Peace be with you Artt.\" - Brad Hodges\n\n\"Artt- what a delight to hear and feel your brush playing. Its all there- a great swingin' feel, a fat sound, melodic soloing, rhythmic subtley, a variety of articulations, dynamics, the be bop vocabulary, and a great samba feel. I really dig the feeling of INTENSITY that underlies everything you play- be it a sweep, a tap, a slap, or a WHAP! Thanks for the inspiration.- I know my brush playing just got a little better.\"\n\nJeff Brillinger - Former drummer with Chet Baker\n\n\"I love his (Artt Frank) playing.
