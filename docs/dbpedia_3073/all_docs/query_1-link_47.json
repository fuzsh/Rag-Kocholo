        "text": "Hedwig and the Angry Inch (1999 Script) 87,675 views\n\nHEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH\n\nText by John Cameron Mitchell. Music & lyrics by Stephen Trask.\n\nHedwig and The Angry Inch was originally presented at the Westbeth Theatre Center on February 27, 1997 by David Binder. It was presented off-Broadway at the Jane Street Theatre on February 14, 1998 by Peter Askin, Susann Brinkley, James B. Freydberg.\n\nThe cast was as follows:\n\nHedwig/Tommy Gnosis - John Cameron Mitchell\n\nYitzhak - Miriam Shor\n\nThe Angry Inch - Cheater, comprised of Stephen Trask, Chris Weilding, Dave McKinley, Scott Bilbrey\n\nDirected by Peter Askin\n\nSet by James Youmans\n\nLighting by Kevin Adams\n\nAUTHORS' NOTE\n\nThis script is, at best, a record of a single evening of a single production of Hedwig and the Angry Inch. We deliberately developed it over a number of years in non-theatrical venues—rock clubs, drag bars, birthday parties, friends' patios—in order to keep it free-flowing, improvisational, alive. We encourage other productions to keep this sense of freedom by ad-libbing when appropriate within the confines of the world of the piece. This script reflects that we were performing at the Hotel Riverview where survivors of the Titanic actually stayed. Tommy Gnosis was therefore \"performing\" nearby at Giants Stadium. We feel that every production should be site-specific so that the character of Hedwig is actually performing in and commenting on the space the production is occupying. Feel free to change the text to accommodate the environment. Just be witty, damn it!\n\n- John Cameron Mitchell & Stephen Trask\n\nPLAY SCRIPT\n\n(A riverside fleabag hotel ballroom with a stage at one end. Upstage is an emergency exit door. Projected on the back wall of the stage is a rock and roll band logo: Hedwig and The Angry Inch. Already on stage is The Angry Inch, a tacky rock band dressed flashily in 80's high style, lots of shoulderpads and stone-washed denim. YITZHAK, a sullen male roadie, trudges to the center stage mike.)\n\nYITZHAK\n\n(in an Eastern European accent)\n\nLadies and gentlemen, whether you like it or not... Hedwig.\n\n(Oh, Beautiful begins on majestic solo guitar and HEDWIG enters down the center aisle. She is wrapped in a full length acid-washed denim cape inspired by the American flag. Black light floods the stage as she takes it. She whips open the cape to reveal a lining painted to look like a wall. Shining fluorescently are the spray-painted words \"Yankee go home with me.\")\n\nHEDWIG\n\nDon't you know me? I'm the new Berlin Wall. Try and tear me down!\n\nTear Me Down\n\n(illustrated by a projected montage of images of the Berlin Wall)\n\nI was born on the other side\n\nof a town ripped in two\n\nI made it over the great divide\n\nNow I'm coming for you\n\nEnemies and adversaries\n\nthey try and tear me down\n\nYou want me, baby, I dare you\n\nTry and tear me down\n\nI rose from off of the doctor's slab\n\nlike Lazarus from the pit\n\nNow everyone wants to take a stab\n\nand decorate me\n\nwith blood graffiti and spit\n\nEnemies and adversaries\n\nthey try and tear me down\n\nYou want me, baby, I dare you\n\nTry and tear me down\n\nYITZHAK\n\n(who has been singing backup, shouts out:)\n\nOn August 13, 1961,\n\na wall was erected\n\ndown the middle of the city of Berlin.\n\nThe world was divided by a cold war\n\nand the Berlin wall\n\nwas the most hated symbol of that divide\n\nReviled. Graffitied. Spit upon.\n\nWe thought the wall would stand forever,\n\nand now that it's gone,\n\nwe don't know who we are anymore.\n\nLadies and Gentleman,\n\nHedwig is like that wall,\n\nstanding before you in the divide\n\nbetween East and West,\n\nSlavery and Freedom,\n\nMan and Woman,\n\nTop and Bottom.\n\nAnd you can try and tear her down,\n\nbut before you do,\n\nremember one thing.\n\nHEDWIG\n\nListen\n\nThere ain't much of a difference\n\nbetween a bridge and a wall\n\nWithout me right in the middle, babe\n\nyou would be nothing at all\n\nEnemies and adversaries\n\nthey try and tear me down\n\nYou want me, baby, I dare you\n\ntry and tear me down.\n\n(YITZHAK upstages HEDWIG with a fabulous high note, HEDWIG pulls the cable out of his mike and regains supremacy.)\n\nHEDWIG\n\n... down!\n\n(Big arena rock finish!)\n\nHEDWIG\n\nThank you! Thank you, you're so sweet. I do love a warm hand on my entrance. My name is Hedwig. Please welcome The Angry Inch! And my man Friday through Thursday, Yitzhak! (stepping on Yitzhak's applause) There's really no need. There's none. I'm thrilled you could join me for this special opening night performance here at the beautiful Hotel Riverview, (an ad slogan: \"Hotel Riverview—you can really view the river!\") This grand ballroom has a celebrated history as a place of sanctuary... of succor, if you will... having once sheltered the surviving crew of the Titanic. Perhaps they can hear me now. (addressing them) You brave unfortunate souls—blasted by man's hubris and washed up on cruel shores—I, who am simply blasted and washed up, salute you! Welcome to the fabulous first night of my unlimited New York run. And when it comes to huge openings, a lot of people think of me. Many more of you, though, have only recently become aware of me.\n\n(She refers to a projected New York Post cover dominated by a police mugshot of a bandaged young man with a silver cross painted on his forehead. The man bears a remarkable likeness to HEDWIG. The headline reads: \"TOMMY TO TOTS: I'M SORRY!\")\n\nIt took a tragedy to make you finally pay attention. But now you're interested. Intrigued even.\n\n(Projection zooms to a tiny box at the bottom of the page featuring a smiling mugshot of a bandaged HEDWIG with the caption, \"Who is Mystery Woman?\")\n\n(in a broad American accent) Who is this Hedwig and why have we never heard about her before, Bob? (back to her normal accent) Well, that's a question I've been asking myself for years minus the Bob. How did some slip of a girlyboy from communist East Berlin become the internationally ignored song stylist barely standing before you? That's what I want to talk about tonight. I'm not here to talk about calamity or scandal. I'm not here to talk about my relationship with a certain well-known rock icon, Tommy Gnosis .... (projection zooms to man's mugshot) Even though, at this very moment, he's probably talking about me. By some freak coincidence, he's previewing his \"Tour of Atonement\" tonight at Giants Stadium, right across the river.\n\n(She pushes open the upstage emergency exit door. Blinding light pours in. We hear arena-sized cheers... )\n\nTOMMY (off)\n\n... Hello New York! Listen ... listen ... there's someone I want to thank for the way they've handled this tragedy ... With incredible loyalty in the face of a lot of lies. And that someone is ...\n\n(HEDWIG draws herself up.)\n\nTOMMY (off)\n\n... you! My fans!\n\n(Her face falls. The crowd cheers. A cheesy intro to Tear Me Down begins.)\n\nTOMMY (off)\n\n... and together, no one's gonna tear us down!\n\n(sings:)\n\nEnemies and adversaries\n\nthey try and tear me down—\n\n(HEDWIG slams the door.)\n\nHEDWIG\n\nI wrote every song on that album! And by the way, the tabloids got it right. He was driving, he was on blow, he was getting blown by yours truly, and he did hit the schoolbus full of deaf children. One survived,—now blind. I taught him everything he knows—and has apparently forgotten—about rock and roll and he barely mentions my name on that giant sucking sound Larry King calls a show, which I'm sure you all saw because if you hadn't, I'd be singing to the desk clerk and, if I was lucky, my agent, Phyllis Stein—did you make it this time, Phyllis? (She is overcome. She recovers.)\n\nI'm sorry. I'm wide open tonight.\n\n(projected zoom to HEDWIG's mugshot)\n\nYou see, the road is my home. My home, the road. And when I think of all the people I have come upon in my travels, I have to think about the people who have come upon me.\n\n(projected childlike drawings on a Berlin-like wall illuminate the following)\n\nThe geography of human contact, the triangulation of a pair of eyes on my face, the latitude and longitude of a hand on my body. These are the only clues I have to my place in the world. To who I am. Who is Mystery Woman!? (laughs) I laugh, because I will cry if I don't.\n\nI recently found my first diary, age 2 through 6, fully illustrated (referring to the projected drawings) ... And I realized that so many people have touched me on my way to this stage tonight. How can I say who touched me the most? My father? ...\n\n(projection of a crude drawing of a dad and little boy holding hands)\n\nThe American G.I.? ... Who left when I was barely old enough to speak my first words: \"Daddy, when I grow up, I'll kill you\"? Could it have been my East German mother?\n\n(projection of a mom and little boy not holding hands)\n\nNo, when she touched me it was usually by accident. Reaching for the beans at the table or something. One day, we were watching Jesus Christ Superstar on American Forces Television.\n\n(a crude drawing of the face of Jesus on a T.V. screen)\n\nI turned to Mother:\n\n(HEDWIG as child:) \"Jesus said the darndest things.\"\n\nShe slapped me.\n\n(MOM:) \"Don't you ever mention that name to me again.\"\n\n(HEDWIG as child:) \"But He died for our sins.\"\n\n(MOM:) \"So did Hitler.\"\n\n(HEDWIG as child:) \"What?\"\n\n(MOM:) \"Absolute power corrupts.\"\n\n(HEDWIG as child:) \"Absolutely!\"\n\n(MOM:) \"Better to be powerless, my son.\"\n\nShe got her wish when the Wall went up.\n\n(Jesus gets glasses but loses hair. Suddenly He's Vladimir Lenin on the T.V.)\n\nWe happened to be living on the East side and mother was given a job teaching sculpture to limbless children. Socialism, God rest its soul!\n\n(She repairs to a booth with a table.)\n\nMost of my time was spent listening to American Forces Radio. Our apartment was so small that mother made me play it in the oven. Late at night, I would rest my head on the top rack ... (rests her head on the table) And listen to the American masters ... Toni Tenille! ... Debby Boone! ... Anne Murray! ... who was actually a Canadian working in the American idiom. Then there were the crypto-homo rockers: Lou Reed! ... Iggy Pop! ... David Bowie! ... who was actually an idiom working in America and Canada. These artists left as deep an impression on me as that oven rack did on my face. To be a young American in muskrat love soft as an easy chair, not even the chair, I am I said! Have I never been mellow? Have I never tried? And the colored girls sing...\n\nYITZHAK\n\nDoo do doo...\n\nHEDWIG\n\nI sang along.\n\nYITZHAK & HEDWIG\n\n... doo do doo ...\n\nHEDWIG\n\nBut never with the melody. How could I do it better than Toni or Debby?\n\nYITZHAK\n\n... doo do doo ...\n\nHEDWIG\n\nOnce I couldn't resist: (singing from You Light Up My Life) \"It can't be wrong, if it feels so—!\" Mother threw a tomato at my head.\n\nYITZHAK\n\n... doo do doo ...\n\nHEDWIG\n\nBut I was really quite content to sing gentle backup harmonies in my oven.\n\nYITZHAK\n\n... doo do doo ...\n\nHEDWIG\n\nWhile mother sculpted in the shower.\n\nYITZHAK\n\nDoo do doo.\n\n(YITZHAK stops singing.)\n\nHEDWIG\n\nWhen the hour grew late and it was time for bed, she would shout from the bathroom, \"Well, that's me!\" And I would reply from the kitchen, \"Well, I guess that's me too.\" We would wash our feet and brush our teeth and lay down on the narrow pallet that we had shared since Daddy left...\n\n(a drawing of two figures lying uncomfortably back to back)\n\n... like two pieces of a puzzle that don't quite fit but are jammed together and left on a table by... (railing at the heavens) ... some dangerous shut-in with too much time on his hands!\n\n(gentle guitar intro begins)\n\nI'm sorry, I'm completely dilated right now. I'd like to share with you a bedtime story that mother once whispered to me in the dark and later retracted. Whatever allowed her to reveal such a story to such a little boy, I'll never know. But I remember it like it happened yesterday.\n\nThe Origin of Love\n\n(Crude drawings illustrate the story.)\n\nWhen the earth was still flat,\n\nAnd clouds made of fire,\n\nAnd mountains stretched up to the sky,\n\nSometimes higher,\n\nFolks roamed the earth\n\nLike big rolling kegs.\n\nThey had two sets of arms.\n\nThey had two sets of legs.\n\nThey had two faces peering\n\nOut of one giant head\n\nSo they could watch all around them\n\nAs they talked; while they read.\n\nAnd they never knew nothing of love.\n\nIt was before the origin of love.\n\nThe origin of love\n\nAnd there were three sexes then,\n\nOne that looked like two men\n\nGlued up back to back,\n\nCalled the children of the sun.\n\nAnd similar in shape and girth\n\nWere the children of the earth.\n\nThey looked like two girls\n\nRolled up in one.\n\nAnd the children of the moon\n\nLooked like a fork shoved on a spoon.\n\nThey were part sun, part earth,\n\nPart daughter, part son.\n\nThe origin of love.\n\nNow the gods grew quite scared\n\nOf our strength and defiance\n\nAnd Thor said,\n\n\"I'm gonna kill them all\n\nWith my hammer,\n\nLike I killed the giants.\"\n\nAnd Zeus said, \"No,\n\nYou better let me\n\nUse my lightning, like scissors,\n\nLike I cut the legs off the whales\n\nAnd dinosaurs into lizards.\"\n\nThen he grabbed up some bolts\n\nAnd he let out a laugh,\n\nSaid, \"I'll split them right down the middle.\n\nGonna cut them right up in half.\"\n\nAnd then storm clouds gathered above\n\nInto great balls of fire\n\nAnd then fire shot down\n\nFrom the sky in bolts\n\nLike shining blades\n\nOf a knife.\n\nAnd it ripped\n\nRight through the flesh\n\nOf the children of the sun\n\nAnd the moon\n\nAnd the earth.\n\nAnd some Indian god\n\nSewed the wound up into a hole,\n\nPulled it round to our belly\n\nTo remind us of the price we pay.\n\nAnd Osiris and the gods of the Nile\n\nGathered up a big storm\n\nTo blow a hurricane,\n\nTo scatter us away,\n\nIn a flood of wind and rain,\n\nAnd a sea of tidal waves,\n\nTo wash us all away,\n\nAnd if we don't behave\n\nThey'll cut us down again\n\nAnd we'll be hopping around on one foot\n\nAnd looking through one eye.\n\nLast time I saw you\n\nWe had just split in two.\n\nYou were looking at me.\n\nI was looking at you.\n\nYou had a way so familiar,\n\nBut I could not recognize, Cause you had blood on your face;\n\nI had blood in my eyes.\n\nBut I could swear by your expression\n\nThat the pain down in your soul\n\nWas the same as the one down in mine.\n\nThat's the pain,\n\nCuts a straight line\n\nDown through the heart;\n\nWe called it love.\n\nSo we wrapped our arms around each other,\n\nTrying to shove ourselves back together.\n\nWe were making love,\n\nMaking love.\n\nIt was a cold dark evening,\n\nSuch a long time ago,\n\nWhen by the mighty hand of Jove,\n\nIt was a sad story\n\nHow we became\n\nLonely two-legged creatures,\n\nIt's the story of\n\nThe origin of love.\n\nThat's the origin of love.\n\nAfter mother finished, she began to snore. But I had to go somewhere I could think. I crept into the kitchen and put my head in the oven.\n\nIt is clear that I must find my other half. But is it a he or a she? Is it Daddy? He went away. Or Mother? I was suddenly afraid to go back to bed. What does this person look like? Identical to me? Or somehow complementary? Does my other half have what I don't? Did he get the looks, the luck, the love? Were we really separated forcibly or did he just run off with the good stuff? Or did I? Will this person embarrass me? And what about sex? Is that how we put ourselves back together again? Is that what Daddy was trying to do? Or can two people actually become one again? And if we're driving on the Autobahn when it happens, can we still use the diamond lane?\n\nPractical questions of wholeness. Completion. Think of it. I thought of it. I thought of the power. (YITZHAK holds up a hand mirror.) The gods were terrified! (HEDWIG looks in the mirror and recoils.)\n\nHEDWIG\n\nMagnifying side. Very funny, Yitzhak. Very passive-aggressive. (points into the house) Look, Yitzhak, immigration!\n\n(YITZHAK is deflated.) If you behave, I might let you shave my back. That will be all. (YITZHAK seethes off to the side. HEDWIG admires herself in the mirror.)\n\nHow's my hair? Is there trouble in the west wing? (refers to large curls) These are actually my lungs. My Aquanet lungs. They kick in on the high notes. Now, I want to you to be serious. Just the other day I was telling Yitzhak how nervous I was about tonight...\n\n(YITZHAK has removed a flowing wig from a shelf and is lovingly combing it.)\n\n(HEDWIG smooths her denim dress.)\n\n... Would I still be able to fit into that old Sergio Valente? There was no time to diet, so I had my heart removed. Suddenly, I was a perfect size six!\n\n(She hears YITZHAK singing softly and catches him swishing about with the hairpiece on his head.)\n\nWAS MACHST DU DA VERDAMMT NOCH MAL?\n\n(A redfaced YITZHAK whips the wig back onto the prop shelf.)\n\nHEDWIG\n\nI'm sorry you had to see that, ladies and gentlemen. When I met him he said he wanted to be a model. A foot model, maybe. Enough about him, let's get back to the—\n\nYITZHAK\n\n(surreptitiously into a mike)\n\nBitch.\n\nHEDWIG\n\nYes? Did someone call my name? I thought I heard my—\n\nYITZHAK\n\nBitch.\n\n(HEDWIG looks back at YITZHAK. YITZHAK, as if searching for the source of the voice, opens the emergency door. The Tommy Gnosis concert pours in again.)\n\nTOMMY (off)\n\n—I realized there was only one person who had ever really been there for me in my life. And that person was me. The accident was a cry for help. I was yelling \"Help!\" to me—\n\n(HEDWIG slams the door.)\n\nHEDWIG\n\nWell, what about me? Without me he never would've swerved into that oncoming short bus and got all that attention! Let me just take a second here, against the advice of my lawyers, Jacoby, Meyers and Lee Bailey. I had just wrapped up a late-night engagement in the meat-packing district. We're talking about the tony, newly renovated, meat-packing district. You've heard of SoHo? NoHo? This is MePa. I was standing there on 14th Street, the very boulevard of MePa, when a limo pulled up. I stepped into it, naturally mistaking it for my own. In the limo sat Tommy Gnosis. We were both astonished. It had been years. So we dropped the driver off and drove up and down the island, doing drugs and catching up. We talked about the disappointing sales of his second album—the one he wrote without me. He spoke of his loneliness. I reminded him of happier days. I just couldn't keep my mouth shut and, well, you know the rest. So you can imagine, when the story broke, Tommy's people offered me a small fortune to keep all this to myself. As if I'd accept their filthy lucre. As if selling the story of someone else's pain was my only means of support. As if I hadn't already launched my new fragrance: \"Atrocity.\" By Hedwig.\n\n(projection of Atrocity logo)\n\nIt's a fragrance for a man or a woman. Or a freak. I digress. One day in the late mid eighties... I was in my early late twenties. I had just been dismissed from university after delivering a brilliant lecture on the aggressive influence of German philosophy on rock and roll entitled: \"You, Kant, Always Get What You Want\". At 26, my academic career was over, I had never kissed a boy and I was still sleeping with mom. The search for my other half on this side of the Wall had proved futile. Might he be found on the other?\n\n(projection of drawn figures separated by wall)\n\nBut how to get over? People died trying. Such were the thoughts flooding my tiny head on the day that I was sunning myself in an old bomb crater I had discovered near the Wall. I am naked, face down, on a piece of broken church, inhaling a fragrant westerly breeze. The new McDonalds has just opened on the other side. My God, I deserve a break today. All I ever get is the unhappy meal. The sun is hot, but I feel a sudden chill. I look over my shoulder. A head-shaped shadow is resting on the pillow of my ass.\n\n(LUTHER:) \"Girl, I sure don't mean to annoy you. My name is Corporal Luther Robinson.\"\n\nI turn my body to face him.\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"My name is Hansel.\"\n\nLuther is silent for a moment as he stares at my little bishop in a turtleneck.\n\n(LUTHER:) \"Hansel. Well. You must like candy.\"\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"I like Gummi Baerchen.\"\n\nOut of his pocket comes a strange packet that says \"Gummy Bears\" on it. Gummy Bears? (projection of bear) I select a single clear bear. It is the biggest one I've ever seen. The taste is completely different from a Gummi Bear yet it is somehow familiar. It is much sweeter than a Gummi Bear and softer, too. Its little gummy body stretches on the rack of my molars. Wow, I feel so optimistic. What is that flavor? He pours me a handful, his eyes heavy with an unfamiliar desire. Could it be a desire to please? Me? I suddenly recognize the flavor in my mouth. It's the taste of power. Not bad.\n\n(LUTHER:) \"Damn, Hansel, I can't believe you're not a girl, you're so fine. Why don't you take the whole bag?\"\n\nHe searches my face for news of his fate. His expression is echoed in scores of tiny faces pressing against clear plastic. Panting faces of every imaginable color, creed and non-Aryan origin fogging up the bag like the windows of a Polish bathhouse. It's only a shower. Absolute power. (slaps herself) I push Luther away and stumble naked through the ruins, back towards blander, less complicated confections, leaving in my wake a trail of rainbow carnage.\n\nNext day, Hansel follows the trail back.\n\n... and lying on my slab are three Milky Ways, a roll of Necco Wafers, some Pop Rocks, and a Giant-Size Sugar Daddy named Luther.\n\n(A projection of LUTHER's and HEDWIG's bodies commingling in the shape of a swastika is accompanied by a few bars of Deutschland Über Alles which segue into...)\n\nSugar Daddy\n\nI've got a sweet tooth\n\nfor licorice drops and jelly roll,\n\nHey sugar daddy, Hansel needs some sugar in his bowl.\n\nI'll lay out fine china on the linen\n\nand polish up the chrome\n\nand if you got some sugar for me,\n\nSugar Daddy, bring it home.\n\nBlack strap molasses,\n\nyou're my orange blossom honey bear.\n\nBring me Versace blue jeans\n\nand black designer underwear.\n\nLet's dress up like the disco-dancing jet set\n\nin Milan and Rome.\n\nAnd if you got some sugar for me,\n\nSugar Daddy, bring it home.\n\nOh the thrill of control,\n\nlike the rush of rock and roll,\n\nis the sweetest taste I've known.\n\nSo come on, Sugar Daddy, bring it home.\n\nWhen honey bees go shopping\n\nit's something to be seen.\n\nThey swarm to wild flowers\n\nand get nectar for the queen.\n\nAnd every gift you bring me\n\ngets me dripping like a honeycomb\n\nand if you got some sugar for me,\n\nSugar Daddy, bring it home.\n\nOh the thrill of control,\n\nlike a Blitzkrieg on the roll,\n\nis the sweetest taste I've known.\n\nSo if you got some sugar\n\nbring it home.\n\nOh come on, Sugar Daddy bring it home!\n\nWhiskey and French cigarettes,\n\na motorbike with high-speed jets,\n\na Waterpik, a Cuisinart\n\nand a hypo-allergenic dog.\n\nI want all the luxuries of the modern age,\n\nand every item on every page\n\nin the Lillian Vernon catalogue.\n\nLUTHER:\"Oh baby, something's crossed my mind\n\nAnd I was thinking you'd look so fine\n\nin a velvet dress\n\nwith heels and an ermine stole.\"\n\nHANSEL: \"Oh, Luther darling, heaven knows\n\nI've never put on women's clothes\n\nexcept for once\n\nmy mother's camisole.\"\n\nSo you think only a woman can truly love a man.\n\nThen you buy me the dress\n\nI'll be more woman\n\nthan a man like you can stand.\n\nI'll be your Venus on a chocolate clam shell\n\nrising on a sea of marshmallow foam\n\nand if you got some sugar for me,\n\nSugar Daddy, bring it home.\n\nIt's our tradition to control, Like Erich Honecker and Helmut Kohl,\n\nFrom the Ukraine to the Rhone.\n\nSweet home über alles,\n\nLord, I'm coming home\n\nSo come on, Sugar Daddy, bring me home.\n\n(She whips out an American flag for the big finish.)\n\nIt wasn't a traditional wedding. For example, when Luther popped the question, I was on my knees. I invited him home for dinner—\n\n(Fanning herself, she opens the emergency door for air. The concert barges in again.)\n\nTOMMY\n\n—me, the real me, the me I used to be—\n\n(She closes the door quickly.)\n\nHEDWIG\n\nAfter dessert, Luther produces a ring, an application for American citizenship, and a wig.\n\n(HANSEL:) \"He loves me, mother. He wants to marry me and get me the hell out of here.\"\n\nI put the wig on my head.

Junction City, Kansas.\n\nHEDWIG\n\nI sit in my mobile home, and on bootleg cable, watch the Wall come down. Divorced, penniless, a woman. I cry, because I will laugh if I don't.\n\nSuddenly, I miss Mother. I consider calling Berlin, but then remember with envy her recent escape to sunny Yugoslavia. Perhaps Luther would be home. No, he was never the one. Never the missing half.\n\nI catch myself in a mirror and for the first time see clearly the horror hunkering on my head. The same carpet remnant that Luther presented to me a year ago to disguise my receding ... receding ... I'm receding. I tear the wig from my scalp and hurl it across the room at a pile of unopened anniversary presents.\n\n(lights soften, mournful piano intro begins)\n\nThere it lies, feigning shock. My personal hair system. My personal hell.

YITZHAK adds the extension to HEDWIG's wig. She changes into a fabulous new dress.)\n\nI put on some make-up\n\nand turn up the eight-track\n\nI'm pulling the wig down from the shelf\n\nSuddenly I'm this punk rock star\n\nof stage and screen\n\nand I ain't never\n\nI'm never turning back\n\n(YITZHAK helps HEDWIG on with a fur coat.)\n\nThank you. I think we have our single! (spits beer into audience) That was a rock and roll gesture. Actually that was a heavy metal gesture. Want to see a punk rock gesture? (fills mouth with beer; a threatening pause; then she spits it all over herself) It's the direction of the aggression that defines it. How 'bout this band? On bass, Jacek; on drums, Schlatko; on guitar, Krzyzhtoff; and my trusted musical director, Skszp! So very talented. And so very lucky to be here. Right, boys?\n\nBAND\n\nYes, Miss Hedwig.\n\nHEDWIG\n\nVery good, boys. Let's watch the tempo next time. (She models the fur coat.) You like the pelt? Some bitch stopped me on the way in, \"What poor, unfortunate creature had to die for you to wear that?\" \"My Aunt Trudi,\" I replied.\n\n(She turns to check her make-up—a large splotch of red paint is revealed on the back of the coat. An onstage pay phone starts to ring.)\n\nI told him to turn that off before the show. I should take this.\n\n(YITZHAK carries the pay phone to her.)\n\n(to audience) Serbian cell phone. (into phone) Hello? (to audience) It's my agent, Phyllis Stein. (an exciting private conversation; she hangs up) Guess who's the new spokeswoman for the Tourist Board of Greater Serbia? (singing to the tune of Happy Christmas) \"Come back to Greater Serbia. Come Christian, come Jew. We hope you can join us. We've cleansed it for you.\"\n\nI'm feeling a little isolated up here. Have I introduced my husband, Yitzhak? We met during my Great Croatian Tour of the early mid-nineties. He was the most famous drag queen in Zagreb. Phyllis thought he would make a great opening act. Billed as \"The Last Jewess in the Balkans,\" he lipsynched something from Yentl under the name Krystal Nacht. He was good. He was too good. His applause drowned out my introduction and I refused to go on. But on my way out, he begged me to take him with me. My face might have been my mother's, it was so still. I said to him, \"Krystal, to walk away, you gotta leave something behind. I'll marry you on the condition that a wig never touch your head again.\" He agreed and we've been inseparable ever since. And we'll continue to be. Right, Yitzhak? (pointing into the house) Look, Yitzhak, immigration! (YITZHAK doesn't look.) Barbra Streisand! (nothing) You're no fun, go back to your hole. (YITZHAK goes.) Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you are becoming fans of Hedwig. Because I find that / am certainly becoming a f—\n\nYITZHAK\n\nCunt.\n\nHEDWIG\n\n(turns to the alley door)\n\nFinally! Finally, Tommy's getting around to—\n\n(She opens the door.)\n\nTOMMY (off)\n\n... me, me, me, me—\n\n(She closes the door. Then opens it.)\n\nTOMMY\n\n... one day, this little trailer trash kid put on some of his mom's eye-liner, grabbed his beat-up J.C. Penney guitar and called himself Tommy Gnosis!\n\n(She slams the door.)\n\nHEDWIG\n\nTommy! Can you hear me? From this milkless tit, you sucked the very business we call show, (to audience) Okay. Okay. You want to know about Tommy Gnosis? I'll tell you about Tommy Gnosis. Get this dead thing off me.\n\n(YITZHAK removes her fur coat and wig extension. Hedwig turns to the band.)\n\nLEUTE, WIRIMPROVISIEREN JETZT! BLEIBT DRAN!\n\nAfter my divorce, I scraped by with babysitting gigs and odd jobs. Mostly the jobs we call blow. I had lost my job at the base PX and I had lost my gag reflex. You do the math. I sat for the baby of General Speck, commander of the nearby army fort. His other son was the Artist Formerly Known As My Buttboy.\n\n(projection of drawing of TOMMY)\n\nYes, Tommy Speck. Tommy was a seventeen-year-old, four-eyed, pock-marked, Dungeons and Dragons-obsessed Jesus freak with a fish on his truck and I found him incredibly hot. Perhaps it was his disdain for authority, his struggle with organized religion. One day, I walked in on him punishing the bishop.\n\nHe was in the bath with the door wide open, clearly waiting for me. I reached down, finished His Grace off, and dropped a flyer on the bathmat. \"By the way, Tommy, I am performing a short set tonight at Dr. Espresso's Seattle-Style Coffee Enema Bar. Maybe I'll see you there.\" I had recently returned to my first love, music. I had tried singing once back in Berlin. They threw tomatoes. After the show I had a nice salad. But newly motivated, I bought a cheap electric piano. (piano phrase from some cheesy hit) That song was built in, it was so cheap. And I found a couple of Korean sargeants' wives who churned out a mean rhythm section. (bad drums) Somehow we became quite a draw singing the hits of the day under the name The Angry Inch.\n\n(projection of Dr. Espresso's logo)\n\nThat night the audience was small but hostile.\n\n(lounge version of Smells Like Teen Spirit winds down)\n\n(to audience) Thank you. Both of you. That song was by Kurt Cobain. That kid's got a future, huh? And how 'bout Kwang-yi on guitar? Give it up! Kwang-yi! (bad guitar solo) Give it up, Kwang. Looks like we have a celebrity here tonight over by the Sweet & Low. Ladies and gentlemen, little Tommy Speck, the General's son! (BAND claps half-heartedly.) That's more than I got, honey. He's embarrassed. (piano intro starts) Well, I'm a little nervous myself. This is the first song I've ever written. And it's written for a guy to sing. We're talking to Phil Collins' people. But then aren't we all?\n\nWicked Little Town\n\nYou know, the sun is in your eyes\n\nAnd hurricanes and rains\n\nand black and cloudy skies.\n\nYou're running up and down that hill.\n\nYou turn it on and off at will.\n\nThere's nothing here to thrill\n\nor bring you down.\n\nAnd if you've got no other choice\n\nYou know you can follow my voice\n\nthrough the dark turns and noise\n\nof this wicked little town.\n\nOh Lady, luck has led you here\n\nand they're so twisted up\n\nthey'll twist you up. I fear\n\nthe pious, hateful and devout,\n\nyou're turning tricks til you're turned out,\n\nthe wind so cold it burns,\n\nyou're burning out and blowing round.\n\nAnd if you've got no other choice\n\nyou know you can follow my voice\n\nthrough the dark turns and noise\n\nof this wicked little town.\n\nThe fates are vicious and they're cruel.\n\nYou learn too late you've used two wishes\n\nlike a fool\n\nand then you're someone you are not,\n\nand Junction City ain't the spot, remember Mrs. Lot\n\nand when she turned around.\n\nAnd if you got no other choice\n\nyou know you can follow my voice\n\nthrough the dark turns and noise\n\nof this wicked little town.\n\n(She blows a kiss to TOMMY on the final chord. She dabs her face with a towel and looks down at it. She holds it up.)\n\nThe shroud of Hedwig, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nThe next day, I was putting the little Speck baby to bed when Tommy appeared with a very expensive-looking electric guitar.\n\n(TOMMY:) \"Your show... that song ... my dad... gave me this guitar to apologize for being a pathetic little dictator. You want to come up to my room?\"\n\nWe went up to the attic and he sang me songs. \"Classics,\" I was informed. The bands were new to me: Boston, Kansas, America, Europe, Asia. I put my hand on his strings. \"Travel exhausts me.\"\n\n(TOMMY:) \"Where are you from, Hedwig?\"\n\nI told him my story. His face might have been a Yes album cover it was so still.\n\n(TOMMY:) \"Have you accepted Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as your personal savior?\"\n\nI told him I was aware of Our Lord. Loved His work.\n\n(TOMMY:) \"You know, what He saved us from was His fucking father. I mean what kind of God creates Adam in His image, pulls Eve out of him to keep him company, and then tells them not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge? That was so micromanaging. So was Adam. But Eve. Eve just wanted to know shit. She took a bite of the apple and found out what was good and what was evil. And she gave it to Adam so he would know. Because they were in love. And that was good they now knew. Hedwig, will you give me the apple?\"\n\nThe words spilling from those lips. And his eyes. His irises were clear cylinders of surprising depth. And emptiness. Only a few puddles of bluish pain sloshed around inside. Same blue as my eyes.\n\n(Acoustic guitar and projections accompany the following.)\n\nAt the time, Tommy's performance options were limited to the occasional guitar mass. I initiated a six month curriculum of rock history, lyrics, grooming and vocal training—my patented oven technique. For his graduation, I gave him his name, Tommy Gnosis (The word is projected.), the Greek word for knowledge. We collaborated. Songs exploded out of us. He started singing backup for me at Dr. Espresso's. Teenage girls started showing up. I added a few duets. Standing-room only. Then, the Sizzler called. In three months, we were outgrossing monster trucks in Wichita. With that kind of money coming in, I was able to give up all my jobs and devote myself entirely to our career. We were very happy.\n\nOne day, I am curled up in the trailer with my usual late-afternoon constitutional of grain alcohol and Brita. I like to be good to myself. Suddenly, Tommy is at the door in tears.\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"Honey, what is it?\"\n\n(TOMMY:) \"My dad ... and my mom ... and my parents.\"\n\nI hold him as I never had been held. But as usual he squirms, slides behind me and clutches my spine to his chest. I am suddenly very much aware that we haven't kissed in all the months we've been together. In fact, he has maintained a near-perfect ignorance of the front of me. Perhaps because of his preference for over-the-shoulder love.\n\n(projection of HEDWIG's and TOMMY's figures in a \"spooning\" position)\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"Honey, why don't you work on that new song while I finish shaving your eyebrows?\"\n\n(guitar)\n\n(TOMMY sings:) \"Look what you done ... (The chord is wrong.) Shit.\"\n\nAnother song blows in from the trailer next door.\n\nYITZHAK\n\n(sings I Will Always Love You a la Whitney Houston)\n\n... and IIIIIIIII ...\n\nHEDWIG\n\nThis song has been playing on a loop for three days.\n\nYITZHAK\n\n.... will always love you. I will always love you ...\n\nHEDWIG\n\nTommy looks up at me through new lenses, one blue and one pink.\n\n(TOMMY:) \"What do you think? Does love last forever?\"\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"No, but this song does.\"\n\n(TOMMY:) \"Do not knock a multiplatinum single. I wish I could hit those notes.\"\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"Just move your lips and I'll sing them for you, honey. From a shadowy corner of the stage. Like Mick Jagger's back-up singer.\"\n\nWe laugh at the professional reference. I return to his brows.\n\nYITZHAK\n\n(singing)\n\nBut most of all I wish you love ...\n\nHEDWIG\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"Seriously, Tom, yes. I believe love is immortal.\"\n\n(guitar chords)\n\n(TOMMY sings:) \"Look what you done ... (bad chord) goddammit! How is it immortal?\"\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"Well, perhaps because love creates something that was not there before.\"\n\n(TOMMY:) \"What, like procreation?\"\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"Yes, but not only.\"\n\n(TOMMY:) \"What, like recreation?\"\n\nHe grabs my ass and he laughs. I don't.\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"Sometimes just creation. Don't move.\"\n\nI paint a bold silver cross on his forehead.\n\n(guitar chords)\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"Honey, have you thought of a B flat after that B?\"\n\n(chords)\n\n(TOMMY sings:) \"Look what you done—\"\n\n(The B flat works gloriously, TOMMY looks up at her in awe.)\n\nYITZHAK\n\n(modulating)\n\nAnd IIIIII! ...\n\n(YITZHAK continues to sing through the following.)\n\nHEDWIG\n\nTommy slowly rises and draws the curtains that are attached at the top and the bottom. He reachs out his hand. I take it. I notice how well his \"Harlem Spice\" nail color complements my own \"Dusty Menses\". He spins me into his arms and rubs his pelvis ... into the small of my back.\n\n(TOMMY sings:) \"Look what you done. You made me whole. Before I met you, I was the song. But now I'm the video.\"\n\n(HEDWIG sings:) \"Look what I've done. I made you whole. You know that you were just a ham. Then came me, the Dole ... pineapple rings.\"\n\nHe laughs and I am filled with an ancient clarity. He's the one.\n\n(Origin of Love chords. A projection appears of two complementary faces—one male, one female—familiar from The Origin of Love sequence.)\n\nNo blood in my eyes, no blood on his face. He's the one. The one who was taken. The one who left. The twin born by fission. He'll die in fusion, our fusion, cold fusion, unlimited power, unlimited knowledge, the secrets he must hold, the memories that we shared but are now forgotton, the words to complete the sentence that I began, \"I am ...!\" My eyes fill with muddy Maybelline tears.\n\n(TOMMY:) \"Oh, Hedwig. Oh, God. When Eve was still inside Adam, they were in Paradise. When she was separated from him, that's when Paradise was lost. So when she enters him again, Paradise will be regained!\"\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"That's right, however you want it, honey, just kiss me while we do it.\"\n\nI wrench my body around to face him and thrust his hand between my legs—\n\n(TOMMY:) \"What is that?\"\n\n(pause)\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"That's what I have to work with.\"\n\n(pause)\n\n(TOMMY:) \"My mom is probably wondering where I—\"\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"Sissy. Nancy, girly, lispyboy. What are you afraid of?\"\n\n(TOMMY:) \"I love you.\"\n\n(HEDWIG:) \"Then love the front of me.\"\n\nHe runs out the back door.\n\n(Guitar intro, HEDWIG tries to sing but cannot. Silence. Her accompanist, SKSZP, begins to sing.)\n\nThe Long Grift\n\nLook what you've done,\n\nyou gigolo.\n\nYou know that I loved you, hon,\n\nand I didn't want to know\n\nthat your cool,\n\nseductive serenade\n\nwas a tool\n\nof your trade,\n\nyou gigolo.\n\nOf all the riches you've surveyed,\n\nand all that you can lift,\n\nI'm just another dollar that you made\n\nin your long, long grift\n\n(HEDWIG removes her wig to reveal a shorter, crueler one beneath. She joins YITZHAK and sings backup with him.)\n\nLook what you've done,\n\nyou gigolo.\n\nAnother hustle has been run,\n\nand now you ought to know\n\nthat this fool\n\ncan no longer be swayed\n\nby the tools\n\nof your trade,\n\nyou gigolo.\n\nI'm just another john you've gypped,\n\nanother sucker stiffed,\n\na walk-on role in the script\n\nto your long, long grift.\n\nThe love that had me in your grip\n\nwas just a long, long grift.\n\n(HEDWIG studies YITZHAK with new interest.)\n\nHEDWIG\n\nIt's nice over here. Out of the spotlight. You and me. Singing backup in our oven. Couple of survivors. The German and the Jew. Think of the symmetry. Think of the power. Think of the publicity. The gods would be terrified.\n\n(HEDWIG goes to kiss YITZHAK. He spits in her face and walks away.)\n\nHedwig's Lament\n\nI was born on the other side\n\nof a town ripped in two\n\nAnd no matter how hard I've tried\n\nI end up black and blue\n\nI rose from off of the doctor's slab\n\nI lost a piece of my heart\n\nNow everyone gets to take a stab\n\nThey cut me up into parts\n\nI gave a piece to my mother\n\nI gave a piece to my man\n\nI gave a piece to the rock star\n\nHe took the good stuff and ran\n\nExquisite Corpse\n\nOh God\n\nI'm all sewn up\n\nA hardened razor-cut\n\nScar map across my body\n\nAnd you can trace the lines\n\nThrough Misery's design\n\nThat map across my body\n\nA collage\n\nAll sewn up\n\nA montage\n\nAll sewn up\n\nA random pattern with a needle and thread\n\nThe overlapping way diseases are spread\n\nThrough a tornado body\n\nWith a hand grenade head\n\nAnd the legs are two lovers entwined\n\nInside I'm hollowed out\n\nOutside's a paper shroud\n\nAnd all the rest's illusion\n\nThat there's a will and soul\n\nThat we can wrest control\n\nFrom chaos and confusion\n\nA collage\n\nAll sewn up\n\nA montage\n\nAll sewn up\n\nThe automatist's undoing\n\nThe whole world starts unscrewing\n\nAs time collapses and space warps\n\nYou see decay and ruin\n\nI tell you \"No, no, no, no\n\nYou make such an exquisite corpse\"\n\nI've got it all sewn up\n\nA hardened razor cut\n\nScar map across my body\n\nAnd you can trace the lines\n\nThrough Misery's design\n\nThat map across my body\n\nA collage\n\nAll sewn up\n\nA montage\n\nAll sewn up\n\n(She tears open her dress and pulls two tomatoes from her bra. She smashes them on her body and crumples to the floor. The BAND glories in her collapse. The music crescendoes, disintegrates and crossfades to stadium-sized cheers. HEDWIG's body lies motionless. The piano intro to Wicked Little Town begins as the glowing word GNOSIS fills the upstage wall.)\n\nTOMMY (off)\n\nBefore I go, I'd like to sing a song that someone wrote for me a long time ago. I don't know where she is tonight. But if you're real quiet... maybe she can hear me.\n\n(HEDWIG rises into new light, a bold silver cross shining on her brow. She has become TOMMY in concert.)\n\nWicked Little Town (reprise)\n\nForgive me,\n\nFor I did not know.\n\n'Cause I was just a boy\n\nAnd you were so much more\n\nThan any god could ever plan,\n\nMore than a woman or a man.\n\nAnd now I understand\n\nHow much I took from you:\n\nThat, when everything starts breaking down,\n\nYou take the pieces off the ground\n\nAnd show this wicked town\n\nsomething beautiful and new.\n\nYou think that Luck\n\nHas left you there.\n\nBut maybe there's nothing\n\nUp in the sky but air.\n\nAnd there's no mystical design,\n\nNo cosmic lover preassigned.\n\nThere's nothing you can find\n\nthat cannot be found.\n\n'Cause, with all the changes\n\nyou've been through,\n\nIt seems the stranger's always you,\n\nAlone again in some new\n\nWicked little town.\n\nSo, when you've got no other choice\n\nYou know you can follow my voice\n\nThrough the dark turns and noise\n\nOf this wicked little town.\n\nOh, it's a wicked little town.\n\nGoodbye, wicked little town.\n\n(The ballroom lighting is restored. Silence. HEDWIG/TOMMY nods to the band. A guitar intro begins. The projection of the two complementary faces from The Origin of Love appears. HEDWIG retrieves the wig extension and begins to sing.)\n\nMidnight Radio\n\nRain falls hard\n\nBurns dry\n\nA dream\n\nOr a song\n\nThat hits you so hard\n\nFilling you up\n\nAnd suddenly gone\n\n(She holds the wig out to YITZHAK. With a sigh, YITZHAK takes it and begins to put it on HEDWIG's head. HEDWIG stops him. YITZHAK hesitates, then places the wig on his own head.)\n\nBreathe Feel Love\n\nGive Free\n\nKnow in your soul\n\nLike your blood knows the way\n\nFrom your heart to your brain\n\nKnow that you're whole\n\n(HEDWIG begs Yitzhak's hand. He grants it and they dance. She releases his hand, setting him free. YITZHAK is bewildered at first. Then he slowly descends the stage and exits into the house with the grace of new hope. HEDWIG waves goodbye.)\n\nAnd you're shining\n\nLike the brightest star\n\nA transmission\n\nOn the midnight radio\n\nAnd you're spinning\n\nLike a 45\n\nBallerina\n\nDancing to your rock and roll\n\nHere's to Patti\n\nand Tina\n\nand Yoko\n\nAretha\n\nand Nona\n\nand Nico\n\nand me\n\nAnd all the strange rock and rollers\n\nYou know you're doing all right\n\nSo hold on to each other\n\nYou gotta hold on tonight\n\nAnd you're shining\n\nLike the brightest stars\n\nA transmission\n\nOn the midnight radio\n\nAnd you're spinning\n\nYour new 45s\n\nAll the misfits and the losers\n\nYeah, you know you're rock and rollers\n\nSpinning to your rock and roll\n\nLift up your hands\n\n(The upstage door opens under its own power.
