        "text": "According to a 27 Sep 1993 LAT article, screenwriter Tim Metcalfe completed the script in 1987 and described the project, then titled California, as a “black comedy.” In a “Counterpunch” column published in the 25 Oct 1993 LAT, Dominic Sena said that he came across the property in Nov 1990, after more than eighteen months of searching for a project to direct as his debut feature. Production notes in AMPAS library files stated that the film also marked the first feature collaboration between Sena and producer Aristides McGarry, who previously worked together on several television commercials and music videos. As they continued with other assignments over next sixteen months, Sena, McGarry, and co-producer Mitch Sacharoff composed a total of eleven drafts of the screenplay. A 25 Oct 1993 LAT story suggested that the filmmakers oversaw the extensive rewrites themselves, since there was not enough money to hire another writer after Propaganda Films made clear they were dissatisfied with Metcalfe’s two “disappointing” and “reluctant” attempts to address script revisions in early 1991. In the 27 Sep 1993 LAT, Metcalfe defended his version of the screenplay and criticized Sena for adding a new scene and a “simplistic, clichéd” voice-over narration by David Duchovny’s character, “Brian Kessler.” As Propaganda regained faith in the project, the budget was increased from $4 million to $8.5 million. A 1 Feb 1991 DV article reported the involvement of executive producing partners Jim Kouf and Lynn Bigelow, with casting expected to be completed in time for a summer 1991 start date. A few months later, the 6 Aug 1991 DV claimed production had been postponed until sometime in 1992.\n\nA 12 May 1992 HR production chart announced that California had begun filming 11 May 1992 in Los Angeles, CA. However, production notes stated that the first five weeks of filming took place in Atlanta, GA, before moving to the California desert for an additional four weeks. During one night in Barstow, CA, the crew was forced to halt production when a 7.4-magnitude earthquake occurred forty miles away from set.\n\nFollowing principal photography, the 26 Oct 1992 HR stated that PolyGram Filmed Entertainment had entered into a co-production financing deal with Viacom Pictures, which allowed Gramercy Pictures to release the film in spring 1993.\n\nDespite rumors that California state officials objected to the use of the state name due to the film’s violent content, the 24 Aug 1993 DV listed an alternate explanation for the title’s spelling: Because the original title matched that of Paramount’s 1947 western, California (see entry), filmmakers used the phonetic spelling, Kalifornia, to avoid the hassle of filing a claim to reuse the registered title with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).\n\nThe 13 Sep 1993 issue of People magazine reported that real-life couple Juliette Lewis and Brad Pitt ended their three-year relationship shortly after filming concluded, causing complications for the film’s publicity department and destroying the picture’s “best marketing ploy.” According to a 6 Apr 1992 People item, Lewis and Pitt had negotiated identical salaries of $700,000 after holding out on the producers’ initial offers of $500,000 each.\n\nThe MPAA Classification and Ratings Administration originally issued the film an NC-17 rating for violent and sexual content, and a 27 May 1993 LAT news item reported that producer Steve Golin lost his appeal to have the rating changed. As a result, Gramercy delayed the 27 Aug 1993 release until 3 Sep 1993 while filmmakers decided whether to edit the picture or follow through with possibly limited distribution. Sometime later, the 1 Jul 1993 HR announced that Gramercy President Russell Schwartz reluctantly decided to re-cut some of the more explicit scenes, which earned the film an R rating. The 2010 DVD release contains both the theatrical and “unrated” versions. The unrated version includes about one minute of extra footage.\n\nA review in the 25 Aug 1993 DV noted that Kalifornia premiered to positive reviews when it played in competition at Canada’s Montreal World Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI international critics award and the award for Best Artistic Contribution. A 6 Aug 1993 LAT item indicated the Los Angeles premiere was scheduled to take place 23 Aug 1993 at the Directors Guild of America, with proceeds benefitting the American Cinematheque’s Programming Fund.\n\nEnd credits state: “Special thanks to Rand Hoffman, Ted MacKinney, Miles Mogulescu, Cheryl Nelson, Malcolm Ritchie, Jim Tauber, Kurt Woolner, Mark Wolfe, Peter Graves, Deana Elwell, David Daugherty,” and, “Maps used by permission of Rand McNally, R.L. 92-S-78.”\n\nLess\n\nAfter writing a magazine article about serial killers, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, graduate student Brian Kessler receives an advance for a book deal.

Back at the trailer park, police find the charred remnants of Early’s home with the body of his landlord recently buried in the backyard. In Tennessee, the travelers stop at an estate where a family was once slaughtered. As Brian speaks to the homeowner, Early steals a purse by reaching through an open window. When they are denied access to the house, they stop for dinner. Carrie is disgusted by Early’s lack of manners and suspects he will be unable to pay for the remainder of the trip. The next morning, Adele emerges from her motel room with short hair, explaining that Early cut it for her. When they stop for gas, Early stabs a man in the bathroom while Adele tells Carrie that he occasionally beats her for using crude language, drinking, and behaving in ways he finds inappropriate. That evening, Brian and Early drop their girl friends at the hotel before going to a local bar to play billiards. Adele suggests they all move into a house together once they reach California. Carrie is uncomfortable with the idea, but feels bad for Adele and offers to fix her scraggly haircut. When she confronts Adele about Early’s violent behavior, the younger woman explains she was raped as a girl and thinks of Early as her protector, despite the fact that he has served jail time for carrying a gun and resisting arrest. At the bar, an unruly patron starts a fight with Early, who retaliates by violently kicking him. Upon their return to the motel, Carrie’s uneasiness increases when she learns Early told Brian he was arrested for stealing a car, and believes he may be lying about something worse. The next day, Carrie notices a gun tucked inside Early’s bag. They pull over so Early can show Brian how to fire and insists he keep the weapon. In Mt. Juliet, Texas, Early and Adele stay in the car as Brian and Carrie inspect a slaughterhouse. Still fixated on Early’s delinquency, Carrie berates Brian for becoming friendly with him and admits she only agreed to take photographs for his book so they would leave for California. As she storms away, she notices Carrie and Early having sex in the backseat of the car and stops to secretly take a picture. When Early notices her, she runs back to Brian and proclaims she will leave unless he agrees to abandon their companions. At the next gas station, Carrie goes inside the shop and sees a television news report naming Early as a murder suspect. Early rushes inside and holds Carrie and the attendant hostage while he robs the cash register. After killing the attendant with a shotgun, Early drags the screaming Carrie back to the car and instructs Adele to continue driving toward California. The next day, Early insists they stop at a murder site in Nevada, where he and Brian tour an abandoned mine. As Brian attempts to psychoanalyze Early’s motives, passing police officers identify their vehicle and instruct Carrie and Adele to step away from the car with their arms raised. Early appears, fatally shooting one officer and injuring the other. He attempts to convince Brian to kill the man, but Brian refuses. Later, Early holds Carrie and Brian hostage inside the home of an elderly couple named Musgrave. After he murders the husband, Adele secretly allows the bereft Mrs. Musgrave to leave the house and begs her boyfriend to stop hurting people. Carrie unties herself and screams for Adele, who lies dead on the patio. Sparing Brian’s life, Early knocks him unconscious and forces Carrie back into the car. Meanwhile, Mrs. Musgrave returns to find Brian still alive and lets him borrow her truck. He chases Carrie and Early to the Dreamland Nuclear Test Range on the California—Nevada border. In his haste, Brian swerves off the dusty road and crashes the truck, falling unconscious again. Inside a house, Carrie stabs Early with a shard of glass and attempts to escape, but he handcuffs her to a bed and assaults her. At sunrise, Brian knocks Early unconscious with a shovel and finds Carrie in the bedroom, unable to speak. Early revives and stabs Brian with a knife, but Brian grabs Early’s fallen gun and shoots him in the head. Sometime later, Carrie and Brian move into a house on the California coast. When Carrie announces that a gallery is interested in her work, Brian takes her to lunch to celebrate. They leave together, abandoning a display of photographs from their trip and letting a tape recording of Adele play over the cassette player.\n\nLess"
