LJ Shen just dropped her first explosive read in 2020 in the form of Angry God and Vaughn Spencer and she took ZERO prisoners. Good Lord this story was EVERYTHING!!! This author has once again delivered a MAGNIFICENT read that has left me speechless, in awe and honestly heartbroken that it's over. Angry God is epic and solidified itself as Leigh Shen's BEST READ EVER!\n\nAfter reading the first two books in the All Saints High series you might think you know who Vaughn Spencer is but you honestly have NO idea! I have never loved an LJ character the way I love Vaughn. He has the attitude and personality of his father but the artistic soul of his mother. Leigh Shen really broke the mold with his character encapsulating who he is, what happened to him and how he was affected by the one person in his life that burrowed deep within him and never left.\n\nLikewise, Lenora is pure magic. I love everything about her. She is raw and wounded and his perfect match. Their banter was FIRE and their chemistry just as combustible. Overall, you will DIE for this story. As usual Shen's writing is innovative and provocative. Her books are always original and always full of the typical snark and smart dialogue that she is known for. This story is the first of many bombs this author will drop in 2020 and I seriously can't wait for this epic ride! 5 stars! ~Ratula ❤\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\n***AVAILABLE NOW - FULL REVIEW ***\n\n5 Sad It’s Over CROWNS\n\nHauntingly Beautiful. Completely Unexpected. Vaughn crept up on me, and broke me down. He owns my heart, and I never want it back.\n\nVaughn Spencer is more than I ever expected. I obviously expected some Vicious elements, he is his father’s son after all, based on his behavior in the previous books, but I didn’t expect the softer parts, the broken parts. Based on the title, readers know there is something that has affected Vaughn in a monumental way, and the way LJ Shen handled it and the fallout with Vaughn’s character was exceptionally well done. She handles it with care and respect, and I love how he loves Lenora, the way he shows her in the end, the heart he tears out of his chest and hands to her. He is one of the most vulnerable characters Leigh has created.\n\nLenora. Oh, boy. She is perfect for Vaughn, matched in every way. She pushes back, she is smart, and she is artistically driven. They communicated on another level in this book, fully opening up to each other as the novel evolved, and she was truly a heroine who loves her hero for who he is, what he has endured, and where he is now. She takes nothing lying done, and I was thrilled to see her holding his hand in the end.\n\nOf course, Angry God wouldn’t be complete without Vicious and Emilia, and did Shen ever deliver for their characters. The way the love the son can be felt through the pages. I felt what they felt, I empathized with them, because LJ puts you there. She writes their scenes in a way that you have no choice but to feel it, every hard, angry, destructive moment. Even through all that, you could still find the love of the original SOS couple.\n\nLike every single book in this series, Shen tackles major issues, topics, themes, and she did it with integrity and respect to the content. There are triggers in this book, for sure, but I am believer that literature (and romance is) should be a reflection of issues that we experience and plague the world, and sadly the issues in Angry God are rampant still today. Addressing these issues makes us more empathetic, more aware, more humane. Vaughn and Lenora’s story absolutely does that. The pain they suffer, the antagonism of a young romance as they stumble through their feelings, and the final HEA shows reader so many things - that light can bloom in the darkest of places, that love can shatter darkness and heal wounds, and that real family, blood or not, will love all your broken pieces and hold you together when you fall apart.\n\nL.J. Shen started this journey with Vicious and it ends with his son, Vaughn, the 8th and final book (as of now) in the Todos Santos world. This series has brought us full circle. These characters and this world has taught me so much. I’ve grown, laughed, loved with this fictional people, and that is the power of a phenomenal romance.\n\nBeta read\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\nForget best book of 2020. Angry God is an all-time best novel. This is by far LJ Shen’s greatest work yet!\n\nI want to start by saying Vicious by LJ Shen left a lasting impression on the romance community for a reason. That book hit us all with an unexpected impact we never saw coming. The second generation is no different.\n\nEnter Vaughn Spencer.\n\nWe’ve heard from Daria and Knight and Luna. LJ left us hanging a bit longer for Vaughn because that wait is necessary. I wasn’t prepared. Nothing could make me ready for what I just experienced. I ventured into the depths unknowing how irrecoverably this book would change me.\n\nThe intensity is cranked to maximum from page one, and I was lost in the abyss by the third chapter. The ferocity rattled the walls along with my ribs. There are no words powerful enough to describe how this story makes me feel. I laughed and cried...cursed the characters only to praise them moments later. Emotional whiplash has never felt so damn good. It’s electric and nonstop, leaving me on the edge on a tightrope without escape.\n\nNothing I can say will be adequate enough to explain the beautiful destruction this book delivers. The complexity is thousands of layers deep. Secrets, revenge, passion, enemies, twists, and redemption are tossed around in a kaleidoscope of epic proportions. Lovers of angst will be drooling. Fans of enemies to lovers will fall to their knees. Anyone seeking a revenge plot will find it overflowing here. But simply considering this a romance is vast understatement. This book ticks off boxes for readers of all genres. Suspense, drama, mystery, psychological...it’s all here for the taking.\n\nWe raise the standards of great romance and LJ Shen will continue to obliterate them.

Hold on for an indescribable ride that will leave you breathless, and satisfied to your soul.\n\nFebruary 28, 2020\n\ni'd like to formally apologize to lj shen\n\nmy official stance was that i wasn't going to bother with this book after some lukewarm and honestly fucking terrible books that lj's released recently (looking at you ITUE). i think the stale beta readers coupled with the too frequent releases was turning me off from her books entirely. but when i saw it was available for free thru audible escapes i figured i could passively listen.\n\nand lo and behold, this was actually a solid release. i think my judgment of this book is due in part to the fact that i went in with such low expectations. but upon further reflection, i actually think this book is pretty good. not great, not spectacular, definitely not ORIGINAL. but very solid.\n\nwhat i enjoyed\n\ni think what worked for ME here is the whole damaged hero thing. i am a sucker for a guy with a past, and usually that can excuse behavior. and it did here. to be frank, i think the complaints about vaughn being a bully/pussy are a little unfounded. i mean we all kind of knew this was going to be a bully romance as almost all of LJ's books are. but i don't think Vaughn was particularly horrible by comparison. in fact, the things he does to make up for his treatment of Lenora actually were kinda sweet. not condoning bullying or whatever but also, let's not act like we didn't know what we were in for.\n\nalso, i'm not a psychologist, but the behavior that Vaughn exhibits as a result of his trauma kinda makes sense given the kind of guy he is. again... not condoning it. but it was enough to justify the things that occur in the story.\n\nanother BIG thing for me is that the plot here made sense. it felt like LJ actually used an outline and knew where she was going with things. that is out and out the biggest complaint i had with the first two books in this series. ridiculous plot twists, superfluous side characters, needless drama, and MEANDERING plot. this book seems fairly... coherent. like there was a plan. and that kind of moistened the ole drawers after the shit i went thru with her last 4 releases.\n\nand lastly, i uh. figured out i'm sort of here for the blood play. the sex/sexual scenes in this were fucking hot. i was here for it.\n\nwhat needed work\n\nthis was not an original story. it read similarly to Vicious, that's a valid criticism.\n\nand overall, i think LJ could stand to do a little more romantic development between her characters. she's still falling into the trap of having love admissions at 80% and then separating the characters. just to get them back together in a big ole PDA way.\n\nbut it would be a nice change of pace to watch a story unfold in a linear fashion. even if it's enemies to lovers, a friends step would be nice. to see why people actually work well together. which is one of the pitfalls of enemies to lovers. you spend all this time hating each other you don't have time figure out why you'd work as a couple, you're too busy boning.\n\nin summation\n\ni'm a stupid bitch, but i enjoyed this nevertheless. 4 stars.\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\nThis book. THIS BOOK. I don't think I could have prepared myself for this rollercoaster ride of emotions even if I tried. Every time I think LJ Shen has written my favourite book by her, tops it with the next one. Angry God has all the angst, the emotion and incredible writing that I've come to expect and love from LJ. This story pushes boundaries, it broke my damn heart, it made me fall in love with Vicious all over again. The heroine is badass, strong and the perfect pairing for this broken, damaged hero. It's been months since I read Angry God and I still think about these characters and that is the mark of a memorable, beautifully written story.\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\nA thought provoking story that will stay not only in my heart, but the hearts of those who encounter it as well.\n\nLJ Shen outdid herself completely with this conclusion of Todos Santos world.\n\nVaughn Spencer was not only vicious and ruthless, he was savage and completely deranged.\n\nMove over Daddy Vic, the heir next in line is ready to take his throne. And that he did.\n\nHis story wasn’t what I was expecting yet was everything and so much more.\n\nHis queen, Lenora, she was not meek, she rolled with the punches and my gosh her love shone through so hard. Thankfully it did, that light penetrated Vaughn’s cold heart and brought it back to life.\n\nThrough blood, chaos and disorder two artists become each others muses for an epic love story for the ages.\n\nI am sad to leave Todos Santos behind. This world has brought so much joy into my world. But I wouldn’t want any other ending but this one.\n\nWe are all sinners, we are all saints, some are reckless, some are broken and some are angry. We are all beautiful survivors.\n\nJuly 11, 2022\n\nAngry, dark, mysterious & totally hot God meets good girl gone bad!\n\nI’ve been waiting for Vaughn’s story since the first book in the All Saints High series came out. Vicious was one of the most compelling characters in the Sinners of Saints series and the story of his romance with Vaughn’s Mother Emilia was a great hate to love, bully romance before the current trend of bully romance books started to blow up recently.\n\nVaughn has been very mysterious in the first two books, they portray him much the same as in the early parts of this book. He is one of the hottest guys in the school, and all the girls want him. They are more attracted because he really doesn’t care about anyone or anything except his art. He hangs out with his friends Hunter and Knight and he chooses different girls to give him oral at parties or even in school, not caring if other people are around. Vaughn isn’t willing to return the favor to the girls but they keep getting in line for him.\n\nThis book goes into Vaughn’s background to when he meets a girl named Lenora (a.k.a Lenny) on a family vacation when they are kids. Vaughn and Lenny meet once more after that at a prestigious summer arts program, then she moves to Todos Santos for her senior year of high school at All Saints High. I like the way this book is told in both Vaughn and Lenora’s point of view because Vaughn’s inner commentary is pretty funny, actually both of theirs are.\n\nVaughn has some issues with something Lenny saw during that summer art program. Lenny says at one point that she doesn’t get why Vaughn made such a big deal about it because it really wasn’t anything to be embarrassed over. Though there are clues, we don’t find out what happened till later in the story. Vaughn and Lenny seem to have a connection or fascination with each other because of the shared secret, or maybe because of some electricity or attraction between them that night after he chased her down.\n\nThough neither Vaughn nor Lenny wants to admit it that they feel anything for each other. Every time Vaughn catches himself staring at Lenny, thinking about her, or telling other guys to stay away from her he justifies to himself that it isn’t because he feels anything at all about her. His inner commentary gets funnier the more he gets to know Lenny as their friendship has ups and downs.\n\n“He came to her room every night.\n\nNot that I was keeping tabs or anything.\n\nI was just in the neighborhood when it happened.\n\nAnd by in “the neighborhood,” I mean in her hallway, lurking.\n\nAnd by “in her hallway, lurking,” I mean clearly I needed professional help, an intervention, and a fucking life. I found myself standing behind a Louise Bourgeois statue for hours daily, waiting like some kind of a rabid Belieber.”\n\nVaughn and Lenny seemed to have one of those kind of love stories that was fated or meant to be. It was like since the time they met as children they always belonged to each other and nobody else. I like this type of story. I really enjoyed the struggle both Lenny and Vaughn went through in this book, as well as the mystery and the journey throughout the story.\n\nThe parts with Vaughn and Vicious are so awesome as well. They are so alike in many ways that you would think that they could almost not communicate at all. But Vicious is the best husband and father. He is not in the book a lot, but the parts he is are great! He also has some good surprises in store for the reader in this book!\n\nBlog|Goodreads|Facebook|Instagram|Twitter|BookBub\n\nNovember 7, 2023\n\nWOW WOW WOW!! LJ Shen starts 2020 with a bang!!\n\nVaughn and Lenora owned music heart from the first few pages and to say that I did not want their story to end is an understatement. The author delivers the last book in a series that is undeniably one of the best I have ever read, with characters that are unforgettable.\n\nAngry God is a straight up powerful read, managing to be bitterly funny , profoundly tragic and raw, as well as giving us great insight into art and music.\n\nThat’s just if you take it at face value.\n\nIt’s more than that.\n\nIt’s an impressive story, capturing the spirits of Vaughn and his muse, in gripping prose, telling a compelling and wholly unique tale.\n\nLJ Shen is a master at explaining how the human mind is what we as flawed insecure human beings wrestle with the most. Vaughn is his worse enemy , he is the definition of anti hero but for me he is the hero of a generation- he is my perfectly imperfect hero.\n\nAnna Karenna once said “monster don’t hide under our bed , they live inside our head”.\n\nVaughn and his muse are tormented by their own thoughts and how they interpret circumstances differently.\n\nDaddy Vicious and Emilia OMG OMG\n\nAngry God is in its own league in the literary world. I don’t think masterpieces are flawless... art pieces are not perfect ... it’s the eye, the soul, the awe that make it perfect to the eye. Angry God is unique in the purest sense of the word-one of a kind.\n\n*Arc kindly provided by the author for an honest review.\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\nI wish I could say this was everything that I'd hoped Vaughn's book would be, but it was a disappointment more than anything. I genuinely enjoyed the first two books in the All Saints High series, despite not really being into romances set in high school anymore, but I put my trust in LJ Shen knowing she could deliver fantastic writing, characters, angst, and steam. While PR and BK had all of that, Angry God in comparison fell flat. I'd been so hyped from the Vaughn/Lenny scenes we got in BK – their chemistry in that book was on fire! Their banter was so much fun! But sadly, I didn't feel the romance, didn't BELIEVE in their romance. It was just a fucked-up sociopath on a warpath for revenge, and he didn't care who he had to hurt or use in order to do it.\n\nAt the end of BK, we knew Lenny and Vaughn had gone to England for an art program. Going into AG, I was expecting it to start off around that time. Instead, we get a good third of the book set during their final year of high school... and it felt like nothing was happening. The story moved so slowly I felt bored along with frustrated. Vaughn would be unbelievably cruel to Lenny (and his classmates) but also follow her around like a lost puppy, Lenny would try to act cool and collected but still get bullied by Vaughn and the mean girls. Rinse and repeat all this drama, until they finally left for England. I actually did like whenever Lenny stood up for herself – I NEED these NA heroines in bully romances to stand up to their bullies if I'm going to enjoy the story. But then any time Vaughn doled out scraps of his affection and attention, Lenny would soak it up like she'd been living in a desert, despite how horribly he treated her the other 90% of the time.\n\nVaughn's quest for revenge is a mystery to everyone, but it's fairly predictable to the reader. Something awful happened to him as a young boy, which is why he's the sociopath that he is. While I sympathized with his tragic past, I never really grew to care for Vaughn... like, at all. He had SO MUCH POTENTIAL, but it all got squandered away by his endless BJs and melodramatic thoughts. I didn't hate him, I didn't like him either. LJ Shen has written some fabulous alpha-holes in the past, but sadly Vaughn is on the lower end of the spectrum. All I could think about was that he really needed to see a therapist.\n\nThe parts I did enjoy? The scenes with Vaughn's parents. I can't say that I loved Vicious in his own book, but anytime he shows up in any of the author's other books, he shines. I loved seeing him as a husband and father. I loved his love for his wife and son. It's hard not to compare father and son but Vaughn didn't make an impression on me as much as Vicious did. Also, Vicious gave some GOOD grovel, whereas Vaughn did not.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm a little wary of anything else LJ Shen has in store for us now. I gave her latest two book 2 stars, which is so disappointing when I used to give her 4's and 5's. I'm not giving up on her just yet, but I'm reaaally hoping we get back that spark that made me love her books.\n\nI also gotta give a trigger warning despite it being slightly spoilery, or at least it makes it easier to connect the dots: child rape/abuse\n\nMarch 1, 2020\n\ni'm going to quote Lola for this\n\n\"The Magic Is Gone\"\n\nWant to read\n\nMarch 16, 2020\n\nStand-alone\n\nRelease: February 18, 2020\n\nBooks in All Saints High series are stand-alones:\n\nBook 1: Pretty Reckless - Daria’s story\n\nBook 2: Broken Knight - Knight’s story\n\nBook 3: Angry God - Vaughn’s story\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\n'ANGRY GOD' is the third full length romance book in L.J. Shen's 'All Saints High' series. Mainly spoken in Dual Perspective.\n\nAngry God was one of my most highly anticipated, my most stalked after book of 2020 and it was everything I could’ve wished for! After encountering Vaughn Spencer in previous books, where his arrogant attitude was all up in our grills we all couldn't wait to get our hands on his book!! And he didn't disappoint us!!\n\nOh how my 'Heartless Prince' broke my heart, his story wrung everything out of me, those twisty turns had my stomach in knots and it just fitted with the storyline perfectly. I was like a mumma bear wanting to protect her cub, I wanted justice and it was handed out perfectly! In all the name of vengeance. How fitting how it was all wrapped up nicely in a Vicious bow! Making it believable how much like his father he truly was.\n\nVaughn is a dark untouchable arrogant a-whole, a broody artist, he's standoffish, Lenora is the complete opposite, she's a good girl with good grades, a high achiever, but is also an up and coming artist. These two met when they were much younger and that one meeting left a lasting impression.\n\nIt was real, raw, ruthless, and relentless on my heart. This book ticked all my boxes and in record speeds I inhaled it. The angst levels were over the top which made my angst stabby heart soar!! I was in my happy place!! Inhaling this, devouring this, enjoying this crazy ride this author put me on.\n\n* Teaser used is off the authors facebook page *\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\n3-3.5 stars\n\nI was so excited to read Angry God. I mean, this is Vaughn, Viscous and Emilia's son we're talking about. Getting to know him in the first two books of this series made me even more excited. While I enjoyed the last 25-30% so much, the first/middle was kind of a mess for me, unfortunately.\n\nVaughn Spencer is quiet and a bit unusual for a high school senior. He' the only child of Viscous and Emilia and I've been super intrigued by him. Lenora is Poppy's sister and she and Vaughn have a history. When she comes to Tados Santos for her senior year of high school, Vaughn makes it his mission to make her time at his school as miserable as possible. Even though these two hate one another, you can truly feel the tension and chemistry oozing off of them.\n\nOh Vaughn... there were some of his actions I could not take. I just couldn't justify or handle them. It was too much for me. By the end, I loved him and sympathized with him, but I never truly forgot how he treated Leny and some of the things he did. Leny wasn't perfect either, but overall I found her much more likable than Vaughn and I liked that she stood up for herself. My favorite part of this book was the last chunk of it. Not only getting to see a different side of Vaughn, but getting chapters from both Viscous and Emilia was such a treat!\n\nWhen I love LJ Shen's book, I really freaking love her books. And when they don't work for me, they just don't work. Fortunately, I love more of them than I don't. Her writing is always top notch and even though this wasn't my favorite of her books, it still had some great, unforgettable moments and I look forward to her next release! If you're a fan of angsty enemies to lovers romance, and don't mind some pretty harsh bully type romances, pick this one up! It will probably be a big win for you!\n\nJanuary 6, 2021\n\nVaughn and Lenora have the most unsanitary sex life i've ever read.\n\nso, yeah. this was just meh for me and after reading everything, i really think Pretty Reckless is my favorite just because no one dies there and i actually liked the development even tho the drama was straight out of a 2000 teen rom-com movie (aka Mean Girls).\n\nalright, first lets get on with\n\nwhat i liked:\n\n➳ Vicious & Emilia.\n\nto be honest, reading Vicious' inner monologue about how much he loves Emilia is the ONE thing i was looking for in Vaughn's inner monologue when it comes to Lenora. Vicious' love for Em is so incomparable and reading their chapters are the only times i cried like a baby.\n\n➳ when they finally become a couple and stopped playing games.\n\ntoo bad this was just a small portion of the book.\n\n➳ Vaughn & Lenora being virgins.\n\nfina-fuckin-lly a H who's a virgin (still kind of a ho tho since he got bj's from random women in the beginning).\n\nand now lets get on with\n\nwhat i didn't like (SPOILERS & TW!!):\n\n➳ the OW/OM drama.\n\nVaughn had a bj with Lenora's bully (Arabella) in front of her and classmates, and as revenge, Lenora handcuffed Vaughn to her bed and made him watch her get orally pleasured by her friend (Pope).\n\ni was angry when Vaughn did it but weirdly enough, i was cheering Lenora on?? i didn't really care about Vaughn's feelings by then because he was a straight-up asshole and i know this is all double-standard but I DID NOT CARE . this is the first time i've seen a heroine make the H taste their own medicine and i was all for it. though, i really didn't like how they had sex the first time literally a day after Lenora made Vaughn watch.\n\n➳ what even is development??\n\nyeah. this disappointed me the most. instead of seeing a good development, we get to see stupid powerplay mind games and immature drama. and honestly, the middle part was just so boring to me.\n\n➳ unsanitary sex scenes.\n\ntwo words: CHISEL & BLOOD .\n\nEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWW\n\nall i wanted to do was grab my holy water and do this\n\n➳ Vicious 2.0 (Vaughn).\n\ni don't know man... he was just so unlikeable to me and he had no redeeming qualities, especially in the beginning when he went on and on about how ugly Lenora is. i feel like Vaughn was just trying so hard to be Vicious and i honestly i felt no sympathy for him whatsoever. I JUST DIDN'T CARE.\n\n➳ TW: full-on child molestation scene.\n\nthis is very triggering and it really did upset me. so yes people, be aware that Vaughn's abuse takes place in CHAPTER 22.\n\n____________________________________\n\nbut yeah, this wasn't a good book since i wanted to dnf and it was so hard for me to finish. nothing really stood out for me and i honestly preferred the stupid teenage drama in PR rather than the toxic drama in this one.\n\nand someone mentioned something about changing beta readers and i agree because her latest books are Just. Not. It.\n\nso all in all, Vaughn and Lenora are two fucked up individuals and imma pray for em.\n\n2 stars\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\nWHAT THE BLOODY HELL IS THIS??\n\nTo say that I am disappointed would be a HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT!!!\n\nY’all fucking knew....since 2018 I’ve been excited for this book. This was my most anticipated read to date by LJ. Then BK happened and I was like OK maybe it’s a fluke because I enjoyed her previous books. Then she started this Lenny Vs Poppy debate just like she did with BK and I was like this is getting old really fucking quickly. So I decided to stay off of her Sparrow page because I was beginning to dislike the book before I even read it. Then the mess that was ITUE happened and listen....I was overrrrrr LJ because that was the worst book that I read last year. I’m still asking myself WTF! It’s like her work has been slowly deteriorating over the years and none of her betas will tell her because they are too busy kissing her ass to stay in the IT Crowd!\n\nHow can someone who wrote Scandalous and Midnight Blue put out this garbage is beyond me.\n\nAG is the most PREDICTABLE book ever! I was hoping that LJ tapped into her creative bone with this book but it’s very clear that she can no longer find it. There are so many directions that she could of gone with Vaughn but she chose the most basic and mediocre story ever!\n\nIt’s the same story as Vicious but she threw in some child molestation and disgusting scenes and called it a Dark Romance. I’m sorry but this book is TRASH! There is nothing redeeming about ANY of the characters in this book and quite frankly I found it stupid. Vaughn is Vics son as in (Baron Spencer) and you’re telling me that he didn’t go to his dad when something happened to him as a child?? Instead she created this unimaginative plot. LJ keeps writing these books and it’s making me hate the original sinners and that’s not ok. Honestly she could of skipped this entire fucking series and I would of been grateful.\n\nI’m not even touching on Lenora and the OW drama because it’s played out just like her Bully Romance books are Played The Fuck Out!!!\n\nAfter this I don’t think I’ll be reading anything from LJ again. I can’t continue to read an author who keeps writing the SAME fucking books with just different characters.\n\nAlso putting people in a “haunted” castle and having them act like vampires ain’t it sis!!\n\nAugust 7, 2024\n\n5 stars\n\nIf you're super into Enemies to Lovers, Academic Rivals, childhood connection, and virgin mcs then this book is for you.💞\n\n— Please, I love Vaughn Spencer! Like, he's my baby, my love. I'd die for him. I don't know why, but I would. I fell in love with his daddy, and I was super glad that when I read this series, we already had Vaughn's book, or I was going to cry because of how long L.J. Shen takes to write. 🥺\n\n❝That’s my one, perfect summer moment in the South of France, watching the face of the girl I will love forever for the very first time.❞\n\n— Lenora Astalis is my favorite heroine aside from Emilia! I mean, she was a badass and freaking super adorable. 🥺 I can't help but love her so much! She has a caring side with lots of attitude! The girl knows her self-worth and never once lets Vaughn get the upper hand or step upon her. She gives as good as she takes, and that's proven by the stunt she did with Rafe. 💀 SHE'S THE ORIGINAL GOTH BARBIE AND NO ONE CAN CHANGE MY MIND! ✨\n\n❝But if we were silver, Vaughn Spencer was gold. If we were good, he was brilliant.❞\n\n— Vaughn's character is a mixture of my three FAVORITE CHARACTERS, and I am obsessed. His scenes in other books about how he was mysterious, never ate in front of anyone, never talked to anyone, and NEVER RETURNED THE PLEASURE. 💀 I mean, I was on my knees, and he was stone-cold too, eheheheh! But the moment we got introduced to Lenny in Broken Knight, he was being a cutie and asking Knight why he didn't take him to lunch with Poppy and Lenny! 🥺 God, I was actually a little scared that he might end up with that friend of Daria (the one who was crying that she loves Vaughn and all when Daria was exposed).\n\n❝No one could take my pain away. No one.❞\n\nI love psychos misunderstood heroes who are made into what they are now because of circumstances and not because they're wired like that. What are you.... a circuit? Nevermind, his trauma and how he was abused and dealt with everything, why he kept silent and stopped feeling altogether, that all he wanted was revenge 😭. My heart breaks for that little 8-year-old boy who loved his mom and dad so dearly that he didn't tell them what happened to him! 💔 And the fact that he didn't take his revenge in the end because he CHOSE THE GIRL! 🥲💞\n\n❝No more treating me like I’m your property. We both know I’m your equal.❞\n\nTHIS BOOK IS WORTHY OF THE TROPE PSYCHOPATH X HIS MATCH! Lenora was as crazy as he was, and they both were so perfect yet so messy together, ugh! They both just went to extreme levels to make the other person jealous and prove that they don't hold any importance! (p.s ow/om scene once).\n\n❝She wanted the internship at Carlisle Prep just as much as I did, but for very different reasons.❞\n\nIT'S ACADEMIC RIVALS TOO 😭, and they actually fought for a position for Internship in England! Or you can say it was INTERNEE AND HIS ASSISTANT ROMANCE 🤭\n\n❝But I want to kiss you. A lot. And everywhere. And...I guess I don’t mind if you end up liking it when I do.❞\n\n• This book is super angsty with loads of jealousy, possessive scenes, great over-the-top banter, and sexual tension! The good part? Both the hero and heroine are virgins! 😍 And it has so many sweet moments as well as super asshole behavior from Vaughn and great retaliation from Lenny! 👏🏻 And they've also met each other in childhood (9-10 and 12-13) 🥺\n\n❝I’m not a huge fan of the human race.❞\n\n❝Me either. But then there’s your mother. I am a huge fucking fan of hers.❞\n\nDaddy Vicious and Emilia's scene had me on my knees! And she slapped him?! 😭💀 Please, I was lowkey waiting for that slap in their own book, and it never came, BUT NOW??? 🤡🫠 Nevermind, I love them!\n\nThe epilogue just stole a piece of my heart! 🥺💗.\n\nedit: Rina kent copied vaughn and Lenora's entire relationship for GOD OF RUIN 😭 but nothing can beat the OGs. 💘\n\nMay 23, 2020\n\nOne Word: YIKES.\n\nFirst off, I am shocked there are not more trigger warnings for this book, especially from the author specifically. PLEASE BE AWARE that this book deals with sexual assault, pedophilia, and self harm. Very explicitly. Some may view this as a spoiler, but you really need to know what you're getting into before starting this book.\n\nWhen this book started, I thought it was fine. Lenny and Vaughn were in high school together and hating each other. Their relationship reminded me a lot of the relationship in Vicious. Lenny saw something about Vaughn that he didn't want anyone to know and he hated her for it. We didn't know what it was. In Vicious, though, we got the characters as adults and their relationship had so much tension and chemistry. In this book, I didn't feel any of that chemistry. I didn't care about Lenny or Vaughn. It might be because Vaughn was apparently CONSTANTLY getting *ahem* pleasured IN PUBLIC. ALL THE TIME. So it was kind of his thing. Yeah, no thank you.\n\nThe second half of this book takes place in London at this prestigious internship for artists. I really did enjoy the art aspect of the book, but this plot line was overshadowed by crazy storylines about blackmail and murder. These kids just happen to be filthy rich and be able to get their hands on millions of dollars to try and fix their problems. As I read on, the book got more and more outrageous and I felt less and less connected to the characters and their romance.\n\nWhile I did love seeing Vaughn's parents, I really didn't like how we got a random chapter from each of their POVs near the end. We spent the entire book with Vaughn and Lenny's POVs and it jarred me being taken out and put into someone else's mind for just one chapter.\n\nOverall, I think LJ Shen is just not the writer for me. I haven't enjoyed the last two books I've read now and I'm not so sure I'll enjoy The Hunter, especially from what I've heard about it. She's trying to write the same tropes and taking them to the extremes, which just isn't for me.\n\nSeptember 26, 2020\n\n\"Any last words?”\n\n“I…” he started.\n\n“Kidding. I don’t give a fuck\"\n\nTruth to be told This book was 3 stars for me for the first 50%\n\nI fairly enjoyed Vaughn's mind, I cracked up 😂.\n\nHis POVs were sooo good. Throughout the book I was looking forward to his thoughts and Dialogues constantly.\n\nHe is sharp like his father and fiery 😌 and a complete alpha as he should be.\n\nBut I am sorely disappointed with Lenora's character.\n\nI think Lenora is kind of a fool 🙄. Also doesn’t she have a career or life goal to accomplish?\n\nI mean she 24×7 thinks about Vaughn 😂 Girl can u stop fan-girling over him?\n\nCut him some slack honey 🤣\n\nand Allow me to breathe for 1 whole mintue.\n\nApart from blaming Vaughn and thrusting her problems or V cards on his face 🤣 what was her contribution to the book?\n\nFor a change can she stop interrupting people in mid sentence and Start taking hints 😣?\n\nOppssss!! Did I just point out \"taking Hints\" 😐!!!\n\nWho is her sister again ? Oh Yes !! Poppy 😂\n\nA toddler has more brain cells and better Game Plan than Lenora\n\nAnd\n\nGod!! Listening is a virtue you know 🤣\n\nShe and her whole family is a loser 😒\n\nVaughn is sharp, cunning, calculative and smart as hell on the other hand there is Miss Dummy Dumb 😂\n\nSorry no match I didn't find them compatible.

MASSIVE YIKES. this will contain spoilers because i’ve got some receipts and i’m gonna gladly rant about the garbage fire that was angry god.\n\none of my main issues with angry god was the lack of development in vaughn and lenora’s relationship. 70% of the book was spent vaughn being an asshole to her for no reason whatsoever, there’s legit 0 reason why he would hate her, NONE, NINGUNA! and then suddenly he realizes he actually loves her and that all of his terrible actions towards her were actually done because of his love for her. that’s some fucked up shit if i do say so myself.\n\nanother issue was vaughn’s character. i did not care about him. i did not like the way he trated every single person like trash when they had done nothing to him, he even said some awful shit to knight, his supposedly best friend. i just couldn’t care less about the hero in this book. and the fact that all of his actions get somehow excused because of what happened to him as a kid is bullshit. was what happened to vaugh when he was a kid horrible? yes. do people handle with trauma in different ways? yes, but that doesn’t excuse you being a dick to literally everyone. he needed a lot of therapy and the fact that everything gets brushed under the carpet, even after his parents find out what happened to him, was disgusting. this is what vicious tells emilia after she finds out their son was sexually abused when he was a kid: “the best thing we can do for him is prentend it never happened, that you still don’t know” because that’s the sure way to deal with trauma, PRETEND IT NEVER HAPPENED! your trauma will be gone and everything will be grand wohoo! like i said, their son needed professional help, not pretending nothing ever happened to him.\n\nGoing back to why i hated the hero of this book, here’s some receipts:\n\n• he made lenora’s nemesis suck his dick off in the middle of a school hallway in front of the ENTIRE STUDENT BODY (!!!!) and lenora just to “prove a point” (he was pissed because she had just said that she would never be with a monster like him).\n\n• vaughn when thinking about/talking to the heroine:\n\n“my little dancing monkey. so agreeable you could get her to deepthroat a baseball bat if you asked, and not even nicely”.\n\n“your face disgusts me so much”\n\n“good, i might remember your insignificant existence in a couple years”\n\n“i’m starting to consider it. you’ll be my pro bono case. not full-on fucking, but feeling your lip ring on my cock no longer makes me want to vomit”\n\n“getting pushed around a little was just what the doctor ordered. by me. not anyone else. only ever fucking me” (he’s talking about how only HE gets to bully her and make her life hell, not anyone else in the school)\n\n“i was going to take every single thing she loved and cared about. not because she interested me, but because she was a means to an end” (not really, the only thing he needed to get his revenge was the internship, bullying her and making her life hell was just because he was a literal asshole, i repeat, THERE WAS NO REASON WHY VAUGHN HATED LENORA)\n\n“you will do nothing but suck my cock and cater to my every need this next semester” (lmao sure jan)\n\n“if you prove to know how to suck a cock, i might show you some of the places, just as long as you don’t confuse this for a relationship or expect me to get you off. i don’t get people off” (no comments)\n\n“i wasn’t going to use her services, unless her lips counted as service when they wrapped around my cock every night” (again, no comments)\n\n“whatever you have going with him stops now, you were my property at all saints, and you’re sure as fuck my possession here”(oof the love that exudes off of him)\n\n“if she was dumb enough to say i never gave her a birthday present, i really had no goddamn interest in tapping her ass anyway” (he legit just thinks she’s a hole to fuck, no more no less)\n\n“i slid the chisel into her pussy, i wasn’t going to hurt her, not really” (i just…. he put a chisel INSIDE HER, like an actual tool that could have hurt her lit rally speechless)\n\n• bonus lenora quote:\n\n“essentially, deep down, we all liked to be sexually degraded, just a bit”. ma’am is everything okay at home??? i don’t think you can speak for the entire female population and say something like that. i don’t think the majority of women like to be treated like trash when having sex, but you do you.\n\nand that leaves us with the last thing about this book that i hated, and it was the outrageous and ridiculous things that kept happening in this book. i don’t know why but the plot points that lj shen used in this book were incredibly unrealistic. the whole drug-smuggling thing, the way harry ends up being killed and no one suspects a thing when the place screamed “crime scene”, the whole arabella/lenora’s father miscommunication plotline, lenora’s father giving the internship to vaughn instead of his own daughter just so that she would fall in love with vaughn because according to her father “he could see the magic surrounding them when vaughn gave lenora a piece of brownie when they were actual kids”. LET THAT RIDICULOUS THOUGHT SINK IN. and again another epilogue where characters that are barely out of their teenage years are having kids. literally every one of this series’ epilogues is the same. 19/20 years old getting married and pregnant immediately. apparently, the author doesn’t know any other way of ending her books. they all got to get married and have kids by the age of 20. in this economy??? i don’t think so ma’am. i’m tired, and i’m glad that this is the last lj shen book that i will ever pick up in my entire life. good riddance!\n\nRead\n\nJuly 20, 2020\n\nAngry God is LIVE and FREE with Kindle Unlimited.\n\nIt is an ANGSTY, DARK bully romance with a twist.

The thing that disappointed me the most though...? Vicious and Emilia as parents. 😱\n\nI finished the book, but my eyes kept rolling till the end. 😬\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\nStoic Tutankhamun. Heartless prince. Empty-chested mummy.\n\nOR in this case Vaughn Spencer\n\nI was wired in messy-ass knots. Made out of metal cords instead of veins. An empty black box instead of a heart. A laser-focused vision to detect weaknesses instead of pupils.\n\nHe was angry at the world, wanted to raze it to the ground, turn everything to ashes.\n\nHe has lava of vengeance boiling and running in his veins, his soul perforated and the lava leaked out and burned everybody in his proximity\n\nHe's a punishing personality, lives for an agenda, his goal to hunt and kill. But his target...?\n\nLenora Astalis walks into his life at crucial juncture and each encounter turns his life. His heart goes through a personality transplant and unbeknownst to him, she humanizes him.\n\nHe HATES that\n\nLenora has a spine of steel and mouth of a brat. Not the one to lie down and roll over, she wears army boots and isn't afraid to toe kick in the balls of her opponents. This girl is on fire!!!\n\nOne thing I knew about men like Vaughn Spencer—they either broke you or you broke them. There was no middle ground. But I wasn’t going to be the one picking up the pieces when we were done with each other.\n\nThen comes the hard part. The secrets that tumble out SLAY YOU DEAD!!\n\nThey're degrading, immoral and inhuman. I was stunned speechless and my heart tore in two!\n\nLeigh does a solid job of surprising you with a Baseball thwack of a twist and the whole perspective shifts askew. Rights and wrongs get entangled, relationships turn on their heads, and amidst all this tornado, lonely hearts become one.\n\n\"Only difference was, my tragedy was silent and embarrassing, and hers—loud and publicly acknowledged.\"\n\nThe story packs a powerful punch, actually several. It's hard hitting, hard feeling, hard to digest at some points and hiding behind it is a lot of heart, poignancy, sadness and misery.\n\nBrash front and pained heart are smoke and mirrors. Tough shell hides scarred souls and that's what makes it all worthwhile\n\n4 stars for Silver & Gold\n\n#BookBistroBlogApproved\n\nFollow me on:\n\nBookBistroBlog@gmail.com\n\nhttps://Twitter.com/BookBistro\n\nwww.instagram.com/BookBistroBlog\n\nhttps://bookbistroblogger.blogspot.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/BookB...\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\nLENNY'S CHARACTER WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF SHE DIDNT THINK ABOUT VAUGHN 24/7.........AND IF SHE DIDNT LIKE TO DRINK BLOOD\n\nIG- Miftahul_mslovesreading\n\nREVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\n\nOkay so let me just say that if this book was a vampire romance where the author shows Vaughn was converted into a vampire when he was in the castle where lenny's Uncle bit him instead of raped him and thats the reason Vaughn is angry cuz he wanted to stay a human and lenny is also a vampire.......trust me this book would have made more sense than the actual shit this is. And lets not talk about Lenny's love for drinking blood...like this book not dark, it's like the author made it a vampire book instead of a \"dark\" book as people call cuz no, THIS BOOK IS NO WHERE NEAR DARK. its just vaughn and lenny have signs of becoming a vampire which no one noticed. i mean vaughn's face is so pale and then lenny likes to drink blood.....\n\nThe beginning of the book was so boring and after 27% i started skipping pages, there was literally no story accept for the fact that Vaughn was raped and his parents are the worst parents of the world. I literally only read this book to see the relationship between Vaughn and his parents but there were NONE. Vicious and Emilla literally ignores him, and there was no scene of how Emila felt about Rosie's death......THEY ARE FREAKING SISTERS, ATLEAST ADD ONE SCENE WHERE SHE GRIEFS . I actually dont even blame the author to write this book in this way which disappointed many readers, I blame the hype. Thats it. the hype because it's like the hype made her want to make Angry god the best book and for that she messed it up.\n\nTHIS BOOK WAS NOT EVEN DARK! I was laughing while reading it because L.J tried to freaking hard to show this book is dark. She even made Lenny and all the character's, including Vaughn say that \" Vaughn is a bad boy, he has dark vibes, he is not like the other guys in his age. Through out the whole book everyone kept saying that, specially Lenny. I felt it how hard the author was trying to make this book \"dark\" but whenever there was Vaughn or Lenny's scene I was like.. Vampire is that you?.\n\nI liked Lenora A LOT and her character would have been better if the author didnt highlight Vaughn so much or made lenny think about Vaughn's 24/7. When they both were like 9 and 10, they behaved like 50 yr old adults which put me off. Like I get it now a days no one behaves like teenagers in books but at least let kids behave like kids. All Vaughn and lenora did was glare and threaten each other. Did I mention all Vaughn ever wants is a Blow job? AJ wants a BJ though out the whole book, in every page there was the mention of blow job. LIKE SOMONE SUCK HIS DICK GOOD AND SHUT HIM UP. From the first book { pretty reckless} it was shown that Vaughn is that big bad boy and here as I said the author tried really hard to show that at some point it became really annoying. Vaughn was not dark or bad.\n\nThe characters had no depth at all , they were stuck in that I hate him, I hate her, I hate her, I hate him thing and there were so many unnecessary things mentioned and the scenes were dragged which made it really boring to read. The author put many kinks and blood drinking * gag* scenes in this book to make it look oh so dark that i legit started laughing.\n\nI was so fucking disappointed because Vic and emila were barely mentioned, they had like three scenes and it did not do any justice and this book was not worth the hype. at least not for me. Emila had only one main scene where she goes to slap vicious.....uhhh... i mean she learns that vaughn was raped and she goes to england and Vicious tells her to forget and move on. *eye roll*. I mean they didnt even notice all these years when Vaughn was acting different? I thought Vic and Emila will be great parents but NOOOOOO. They were like Vaughn is a different kid, let him do whatever he wants. we live our lives and ignore him. *sigh*\n\nAnother thing I hated was that there was no conclusion, I MEAN THERE WAS NO DEAN SCENES. I cant, I just.....cant. I thought we will get a glimpse of all the characters from sinners of saints series and all saints high since Angry God is the most hyped book and I guess the last book of the series? but there was none, it focused on HOW ANGRY VAUGHN IS * face palm* I have so many things to say but ugh, i am tired. this book was a shit show..the only thing I liked was that vaughn called lenora Ugly which is different cuz she is not the hottest or the most beautiful girl in the entire school which we see in ALL highschool books. At least this part was different and nice to read. And Lj needs to change her beta readers, either they are too scared to say that book is shit to her face or they just do it on purpose.....\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\nThis is a hard one to rate for me... There were definitely parts where I would go for 5 stars, but also plenty of parts where I would give 2... So I guess I will go with 3,5 stars.\n\nEven though I really enjoyed reading this one, I also found it a bit OTT. So much was thrown in, and I felt it took away from the romance. There wasn't a whole lot of steam in this one but what was there could be described as quite \"kinky\".\n\nI do advise people with triggers to read some full reviews with spoilers because there are plenty to go around in this one.\n\nI will write a full review when I feel more up to it (kinda under the weather right now)\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\nVaughn has intrigued me since he was first brought into this series. So closed off and angry and beautiful!\n\nVaughn Spencer might of just been the man to ruin me forever, this beautiful broken man just captured my heart completely with his entire being and I’ll never love another as much as I do him.\n\nWhen I went into this book never did I expect to get out of it what I did. The storyline was so much more than I ever expected. It’s hard, it’s dark, 100% captivating and insanely intense everything you would associate with Vaughn Spencer.\n\nI will NOT go much into the storyline because spoilers are awful and nobody wants them but I will say this whole book was phenomenal. Vaughn is far from perfect but we get to see what’s behind everything that’s made him who he is and it’s a tough ride to be on but one you won’t be able to get off at any time.\n\nVaughn and Lenora are so different but at the same time similar. Vaughn is closed of and hates being near people that aren’t his close two friends or his mum and dad but beneath his hard heart there’s so much more to him. Lenora is actually perfect. I couldn’t ask for a better heroine than her. She’s sassy and stands her ground with bullies. She’s brave and beautiful and you can’t help but love her fiercely. These two together could take over the whole entire world.\n\nI can’t leave out the cameos in this book either because damn, I loved them so much. So shout out to LJ for putting them in here where they needed to be, I love them all.\n\nLJ Shen truly outdid herself on Angry God, the final book in the All Saints High series. She held nothing back and gave us her all and delivered us with this heartbreakingly beautiful story that is Vaughn and Lenora.\n\nReading this book was an experience I’ll never forget, the feelings and the emotions you experience whilst reading it is powerful and I love that about this author. The mystery that is Vaughn Spencer has now been cracked and I’m so here and living for it.\n\nPrepare to be shocked, prepare to have your mind blown in a way only LJ Shen can do. Incredible.\n\nAngry God is beautiful and heartbreaking all mixed up into one intense ball of emotions. Hands down LJ’s best book to date and definitely the best book of 2020.\n\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\n*****FIVE STARS*****\n\n{ARC Generously Provided by Author}\n\nWe were an unfinished business, personal and always walking the tightrope between love and hate. But we were always something, Len. We will always be something.\n\nI have to admit, Vaughn has not been my favorite character in the All Saints High series. He’s always been a little too moody and aloof for my liking, and I was hoping that he’d get paired up with someone who was his complete opposite. Lenora wasn’t my first choice for his love interest. After having finished reading ”ANGRY GOD”, I can honestly say that I was completely wrong about everything. I didn’t expect to enjoy Vaughn and Lenora’s story as much as I did. I love a good enemies-to-lovers romance, but I am not a fan of the Hero being a complete douchebag. We learn that Vaughn isn’t inherently the cruel monster that he lets everyone believe that he is. There’s a reason why he keeps to himself a lot and doesn’t show emotions and that made this character have so much more depth than I ever expected of him.\n\nLenora was the perfect fit for Vaughn. She kept him on his toes and challenged him when no one else would dare to. She softened out his rough edges and he helped to make her the fighter that she grew up to be. That is what I consider a perfect match. I still hold Knight close to my heart but I now have a new appreciation of Vaughn Spencer as well.\n\nHere are my overall ratings:\n\nHero: 5\n\nHeroine: 4.5\n\nPlot: 4.5\n\nAngst: 5\n\nSteam: 5\n\nChemistry Between Hero & Heroine: 5\n\n”ANGRY GOD is now available!\n\nAmazon US: https://tinyurl.com/sky8y7d\n\nAmazon Worldwide: mybook.to/AGLJShen\n\nPaperback: mybook.to/AGPBShen"
