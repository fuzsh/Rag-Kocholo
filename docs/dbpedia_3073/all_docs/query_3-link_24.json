        "text": "III\n\nThe Roads Diverge\n\n1822–1825\n\n(LETTERS 81 TO 127)\n\nWITH THE PUBLICATION OF HIS BOOK of verse in September 1821 Bryant had, within four years of his first appearance in the North American Review, earned some fame as both poet and critic, and found friends at Cambridge, Boston, and New York who watched his progress sympathetically. Meanwhile, he made his living at the law and followed a course which, among his Berkshire County contemporaries, not seldom led to the legislature and to the national Congress. As tithing man, town clerk, Supreme Judicial Court Councilor, justice of the peace, clerk of the center school district, secretary of the Berkshire Federal–Republican party convention, and occasional public orator, he was often in the public eye.\n\nDuring his bachelor years in Great Barrington, Bryant had suppressed his distaste for what he termed to his father “skulking about in holes and corners of the earth.” For a time he thought he had broken the “spell” of his early enchantment with the “dear, dear witchery of song.” As a justice of the peace, he settled his neighbors’ disputes; as an attorney, he pressed their claims in the county courthouse at Lenox. He tilted with legal opponents in the courtroom and quarreled with them outside, and he caricatured their craggy faces on drafts of his letters and poems. In the guise of a sophisticated social critic, he ridiculed in newspaper essays his neighbors’ oddities and affectations in home, office, pulpit, and barnyard. He attended agricultural fairs and Fourth of July festivities, danced at parties and balls, played whist, and poked fun at popular songs and common gossip. And he sang to the Barrington girls he courted, as he once had to those of Worthington and Bridgewater.\n\nBut Cullen’s marriage in 1821, the birth a year later of a daughter, and his gradual assumption after his father’s death of the responsibility for the well-being of his younger brothers and sisters, on the one hand, and the insistence of his literary friends, on the other, that he increase his poetic output, sharpened his dilemma. He had defined this earlier for Edward Channing: “You certainly need use no apology to one who does not follow the study of the law very eagerly, because he likes other studies better; and yet devotes little of his time to them, for fear that they should give him a dislike to law.”\n\nBetween 1822 and 1824 Bryant busied himself with several diverse activities which, though they broadened his preparation for a later career, must at the time have seemed, even to him, to be at variance with his natural genius.\n\nThe liberalizing influences of Peter Bryant and Samuel Howe on Cullen’s religious thought, and of William Baylies on his sense of social responsibility, were enhanced by his friendships with the Sedgwicks, especially Henry and Theodore II. Bryant’s long report to Andrews Norton at Cambridge on the condition of religion in Berkshire County in 1822 defined the beliefs which underlay his expression thereafter. His public appeal, at the close of 1823, for aid to the Greek revolutionaries in their struggle against Turkish rule led to the composition of several poems hailing their cause, and showed his growing concern with world affairs. His study of French with a sometime Napoleonic officer, L[ouis?] Boutin, joined in by his wife and child, initiated his acquisition of half a dozen modern languages during the following decade. And occasional letters to village and city newspapers reflected an impulse to propose opinions on social, political, and literary matters to a wider audience than that of the North American Review.\n\nThe apparent paucity of his verse composition during this period is evidenced by his accepting a dare from several lawyer friends to write a political farce for the stage, only to lay it forever aside, and his quitting midway the composition of a long narrative poem on a mythic theme from Cotton Mather’s Magnalia Christi Americana of the early-eighteenth century. Not until he was asked at the end of 1823 to furnish verses on a continuing basis to the United States Literary Gazette at Boston, and offered payment for them, did Bryant recover his best mode of composition.\n\nIn the meantime, his friendly critics had not forgotten him. Dana and Phillips, worried at his distraction with politics and other matters, wrote of their concern to the Sedgwick brothers. Accounting to Bryant in October 1823 on the slender sales of his 1821 Poems, Phillips remarked, “I wish you to write something more by and by that with these shall make a volume that can be bound.” And he confided the following spring to Henry Sedgwick at New York City, “I am apprehensive that he grows careless of poetry, and will let his talent sleep.” Their encouragement brought Bryant to visit the Sedgwicks in New York in April 1824. At Robert’s home he met Cooper, Halleck, Sands, Sparks, and other busy writers. Here he began to think he might make a living at the literary career he had followed only fitfully for a decade.\n\nHis visit to New York that spring did not, by itself, impel Bryant to abandon the law. His final frustration with “legal chicanery,” as he later called it, came in the fall, when a verdict for slander he had twice won for a client, before first judge and then jury, was overturned on appeal by a hair-splitting decision. But his resolution to quit his profession coincided closely with published praise of his poems in the Literary Gazette and of those which were reprinted in Great Britain. When the Sedgwick brothers invited him to revisit them in the spring of 1825, while they completed arrangements for him to edit a new literary monthly, the New-York Review, Bryant went eagerly.\n\nReturning to Berkshire after successful negotiations in the metropolis, Bryant exulted over his imminent escape from the “disagreeable drudgery” of the law. Charles Sedgwick wrote to his brother Henry, “Every time I saw him, every muscle of his face teemed with happiness. He kissed the children, talked much and smiled at every thing. He said more about your kindness to him than I have ever heard him express before, in regard to any body.” On May 1, 1825, Bryant left Great Barrington and the law for an editorial career in New York City which would occupy him for the rest of his life, extending over more than half a century.\n\n81. [To Nathaniel Preston?]1\n\nGreat Barrington March 12 1822.\n\nDear Sir,—\n\nAs you seem determined not to stand midwife at the bringing forth of John Calvin & the Saybrook platform2 in Sheffield,—I have sent you some prescriptions for retarding the parturition.—I think however that they will come into the world too late to do much harm and that the wonderful birth will prove to be nothing more than a super foetation, or stillborn perhaps—or at most that the only signs of life attending it will be the few feeble wailings it may utter before it is silent forever—\n\nTo be serious however as you are in want of books on the Unitarian controversy I will recommend some and others I will send you.—In the first place then—I recommend the Old and New Testaments as the best Unitarian books I am acquainted with—Read the 17th chapter of St. John’s Gospel, the perusal of which eight years since convinced me of the inferiority and subordination of the Son to the Father.3\n\nI send you Dr. Ware’s Letters a good summary and defence of those points of Doctrine on which rational Christians differ from the orthodox, with the exception of the Doctrine of the Trinity which is not treated of in that publication.4\n\nOn the subject of the Trinity particularly, I se[nd yo]u a pamphlet written by Jacob Norton who belongs to the Arian division of Unitarians—those who hold to the preexistence of Christ his superangelic nature &c—points which are denied by us plain humanitarians. I wish I could send you a better book on this subject—but as he attacks the Trinitarian hypothesis with considerable spirit, and gives a sort of review of the text commonly cited to support it—and moreover as it is the only connected treatise I have on the subject I have concluded to send it to you—5 There is a book entitled Yates’s Reply to Wardlaw, which contains a most admirable argument on this subject and which I hope to own before long.—6\n\nI have several Numbers of the Unitarian Miscellany which carry on a sort of skirmishing warfare on the fra[il]ties of orthodoxy.7—If what I have sent you sh[ould] agree with your digestion better than the knotty and ligneous points of Calvinism—I will send them also.—With those sentiments of esteem which I trust ever [entitles] those whose independence of intellect leaves them to examine for themselves the subjects which interest them most\n\nI am sir—\n\nYr friend\n\nW.

New England’s “peculiar church polity” was codified at the Massachusetts synod of 1648 in the Cambridge Platform, formalizing Puritan theocratic rule. In 1708 its tenets were subscribed to by the Connecticut Congregationalists in the adoption of the Saybrook Platform. See The American Puritans: Their Prose and Poetry, ed. Perry Miller (Garden City: Doubleday [1956]), pp. 37, 121.\n\n3.

Bryant’s remark that he had gained Unitarian beliefs eight years earlier suggests that he may have first met with Yates’s Reply while studying law with Samuel Howe at Worthington. Mrs. Howe wrote later that, though her husband strongly opposed her liberal views when they were married in 1813, soon afterward Henry D. Sedgwick, a zealous Unitarian, lent him “ ‘Yates’s Answer to Wardlaw.’ This book and the New Testament he read with care, … comparing it with Scripture; and was entirely convinced of the truth and reasonableness of the Unitarian faith, which he afterwards held through life.” Quoted in Lesley, Recollections of My Mother, p. 237.\n\n7.

Dana\n\nGreat Barrington March 28th, 1822.\n\nMy Dear Sir\n\nI have just received yours of the 15th inst. together with the 5th No. of the Idle Man. I ought certainly to apologize for not having written to you earlier and you would have heard from me immediately after I received your 4th No.—but you are to know that a trifling enlargement of my family took place about that time and though I can hardly tell why it should be so yet the fact is that this circumstance has kept my affairs particularly of a literary kind in a sort of hassle ever since.—1\n\nI will own to you that of late I have been deterred from writing by the cause to which you allude.2 The sorrow that I felt must attend such a loss had to me a kind of sacredness about it which I feared to violate, and I knew that I could bring no consolation.\n\nI must not suffer you to speak so slightingly of your 4th No. The second letter from town has more than made amends for any faults of its elder brother.3 But the story of Thomas Thornton4 which I have just read has in my opinion merit of a higher, and more decided kind than any thing you have written for the Idle Man except The Son.5 It has one species of merit which does more to render an author immediately popular than any other—I mean that of exciting a deep interest in the event of the story. I have great hopes from it.\n\nYou are right in believing that my principal feeling when I was made acquainted with the rejection of my review was that of regret at being disappointed in the hope I had formed that I might be of some service to you. I did not indeed feel altogether certain that it would be admitted, from what I knew of the opposition made to you by some of those concerned in the North American Review, but when I thought of the praises sometimes lavished by that work on productions which your most strenuous opposers could not think for a moment of putting in comparison with yours I must confess I hardly expected it would be refused admission. If however the reason for rejecting it was that it was badly written, it was a good one, if true, and ought to have prevailed.6 If the article can be made to answer any purpose I hope you will not hesitate to make use of it—though I do not know of any periodical work in which it could be inserted with the hope of its doing you much good—I do not know any thing about the Literary Repository.7 Has not the Analectic Magazine8 more reputation? But of this subject you have better means of judging than I. I do not regret the labour of composing the article. I only regret that that labour has been of so little service to you.—\n\nI hope the unpleasant sensations in the head of which you complain will make you look carefully to your health. My experience has taught me that the state of the head depends very much on that of the stomach and the condition of the stomach is again dependent on the due regulation of diet and exercise. But exercise ought to be taken at proper times. A few minutes violent exercise or half-an-hour’s intense study immediately after a meal have put my head in confusion and kept it buzzing for a whole day.—\n\nYou greatly overrate the help your work receives from my verses. If the readers of your work have the same sort of feeling about the poetical part of your work that I have about that of most periodical publications, they care very little whether they read it or not. However, that you may not be out of poetry for your next number I send you what follows.9 In the mean time you may depend on my doing every thing I can for you in the Newspapers. My regards to all my friends.\n\nYours truly\n\nWILLIAM C. BRYANT\n\nMANUSCRIPTS: LH (final); NYPL–GR (draft).\n\n1.

Dana\n\nGreat Barrington July 20, 1822.\n\nDear Sir—\n\nI cannot tell how it is, but when I have a letter to write and at last set myself seriously about it I am always surprised at seeing how long I have delayed it. But I have infinitely less patience [when] I expect one from a friend.\n\nI know in some measure how to feel for you under the dreadful misfortune you mention.1 I have myself a little daughter playing under my roof and when I make your case my own I can judge of the sharpness of your sufferings. Yet you know how to apply to these sorrows the best consolations in store for them. It is true that nature must have its way, and the first burst of grief cannot be restrained, but the memory of those whom we loved so much at last becomes a sacred and cherished companion to us, that comes in aid of our virtue and comforts us under the falsehood and unkindness of the world. We find that desolate as our situation at first seemed to be, our friends are not altogether lost us; we commune with their images in our own hearts.\n\nAnd then we reflect that we ought [not] to grieve, for they have past through all the sufferings that God has provided to educate and chasten those he loves, and now they can suffer no longer;—and with regard to ourselves, life has something more and better for us to do than to brood forever over the loneliness and darkness of our own lot.\n\nI hope you will get the better of your invisible enemies as Dennie once called them the nerves.2 Let me be your physician. I rec[om]mend then the air of the fields, and exercise in the garden. To talk of early rising I suppose would do no good—you and your doctor have settled that point.\n\nThe review of the Idle Man in the North American is certainly a very cautiously written production.3 I have, as well as you, no doubt that the author was instructed where he ought to find fault, and how small a measure of reluctant praise it would do to bestow. Why should he couple the Club Room4 with the Idle Man in that article? I cannot tell, unless it was to insinuate the notion that they were works of nearly equal merit. They seem to me oddly yoked, and I cannot see in the extracts he gives from the Club Room quite merit enough to justify his encomiums. But the thing is done, and may good come of it.\n\nI have received the paper you forwarded to me, and about the same time somebody else sent me another like it.—The paragraph relating to me has been copied in the Newspapers in this vicinity, and people here are just beginning to enquire about my book.5\n\nMiss Sedgwick’s New England Tale is quite popular.6 A second edition is in the press. I hope you like it.—You see that American productions are coming into fashion a little.\n\nIf Verplanck’s plan for you should take effect I wish you a good salary, an agreeable situation and a pleasant duty.7—Should you visit New York this season you will not only try to take me in your way but will actually do it. Take the steam boat or a packet to Albany,—from that place the stage runs to Hartford through this town. From this place you can go home by the way of Hartford, or I will carry you [to] Stockbridge and you can go by way of Springfield.—\n\nRemember me to all my friends in your part of the world.\n\nYour friend\n\nW. C. BRYANT\n\nMANUSCRIPT: NYPL–GR ADDRESS: Richard H. Dana Esq. / Cambridge / Mass POSTMARK (in script): Great Barrington July 30th POSTAL ANNOTATION: 12½.\n\n1. Dana’s letter of c. July 1 is unrecovered. A brief quotation, apparently from this letter, in Life, I, 196, concerns only his comment on a notice in Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine of William Roscoe’s Specimens of the American Poets (see Note 5). Dana had evidently written of his depression over his wife’s death, recorded later by his son: “To those of us who saw our father’s grief, which no description we have read of agony short of madness has equalled, … it might well be a peculiar lasting & sacred thing.” Richard H. Dana, Jr.: An Autobiographical Sketch, ed. Robert F. Metzdorf (Hamden, Connecticut, 1953), p. 34.\n\n2. Joseph Dennie (1768–1812), essayist and editor of the weekly Port Folio at Philadelphia, 1801–1812.\n\n3. William H. Prescott, later the distinguished historian, had written for the NAR, 14 (April 1822), 319–350, a long article titled “Essay Writing” in which, having discussed in detail the form initiated in England by Addison and Steele and brought to America by Irving, he tackled the deficiencies of both the short-lived The Club-Room (Boston, February–July, 1820) and the principal author of The Idle Man. He found Dana guilty of “hopeless perversity of taste” and “mystical, vague and unintelligible phraseology,” and suggested that his uniformly “amiable” and “beautiful character” could interest only the few, rather than the many (pp. 340–347). But his praise for Bryant’s poetry was unrestrained: “We cannot quit the Idle Man, without expressing our obligation to the Muse, who has enriched these pages with such eloquent pictures of American scenery, as must add new and valuable treasures to descriptive poetry” (p. 349).\n\n4. The Club-Room was founded in 1820 by Joseph T. Buckingham, later more successful as editor of the New-England Magazine (1831–1835) and the Boston Courier (1824–1848). Mott, American Journalism, pp. 187, 208, 262.\n\n5. Early in 1822 a volume entitled Specimens of the American Poets; with Critical Notices and a Preface, containing the eight poems in Bryant’s collection, was published at London. The editor, William Roscoe, introduced these in a laudatory notice which was copied in Berkshire County papers. On July 18 the Stockbridge Berkshire Star printed a letter (probably written by Bryant’s friend Charles Sedgwick) from “An American,” who complained, “It is not much to the credit of American discernment … that we do not value our diamonds till the rays of their brilliance come to us reflected back from across the Atlantic.… This distinguished individual is not only an American but an inhabitant of Massachusetts, and not only an inhabitant of Massachusetts, but of the County of Berkshire.” The writer then quoted Roscoe’s notice, including the remarks, “The publication of this small volume of poems by Mr. Bryant, will induce a belief that America is destined very speedily to become the mother of poets.… If the approving judgement of the English public can add any weight to Mr. Bryant’s claims to the admiration of his countrymen, his Poems only require to be known to entitle him to it” (pp. 189–191). Having read a similar comment, in a notice of Roscoe’s Specimens in Blackwood’s for June 1822, Dana wrote Bryant, “They seem to be fully aware that you are another sort of man from those bound up with you.” Life, I, 196.\n\n6.

Subsequently Verplanck had apparently urged Dana to come to New York and take an editorial position, a suggestion he repeated four years later. See Letters 149 and 159; July, Essential New Yorker, p. 117.\n\n84. For the BERKSHIRE STAR. To the Electors of the Berkshire District.1\n\n[Great Barrington, ante October 31, 1822]\n\nGENTLEMEN.—\n\nI cannot resist the desire I have of saying a few words to you on the subject of the approaching election of a Member of Congress for this District.\n\nI am no proficient in the Art of Rhetoric, and shall not be able to give you such an eloquent and florid address as I read in the Pittsfield Sun of last week, on the same subject, some parts of which exceeded my poor capacity and learning to comprehend.2 I am only a plain man, speaking to plain men like myself, and shall be satisfied if I can state a few simple facts in such a way as to meet the approbation of those among my fellow citizens, who, like myself, make no pretensions to the character of scholars and critics. Indeed, if I were able to amuse you with a flourish of fine sentences on this occasion, it would answer no purpose for me to try; for my design is not to pervert the truth, or to deceive any man, but only to state to you my ideas on this subject in the clearest manner I am able.3\n\nIn the first place, then, I hope you are all aware of the importance of being represented in Congress by a man of ability and integrity. I do not know that this consideration is more important at the present time than at any other. But I know that the nation has interests, which ought always to be watched over, and should never be entrusted to the care of those whom we do not know to be perfectly capable of managing them. None of us would trust himself in a public coach, on a dangerous road, with a postillion, who, we suspected, did not know how to drive; or embark on board a vessel, even for a short voyage, with a pilot who never saw salt water before. We are guilty of a similar folly when we put the interests and welfare of our country into the hands of those with the correctness of whose political principles, or with whose capacity in a political situation, we are not acquainted.\n\nBut this is not all. The candidate for whom we give our votes ought not only to be a fit man, but the fittest man. When we find it necessary to entrust any body with the management of our private concerns, we apply to the best man for that purpose whom we know. When we would employ an artist, or a mechanic, or a laborer on our farms, we engage the man who will do our work best and most profitably. We ought not to do worse [f]or our country than we do for ourselves. It is our duty to give her the best servants we can get.\n\nNow it is extremely fortunate for us, that at the present time we can sit calmly down and weigh the merits of the different candidates who are held up for the next election, without having our minds influenced or agitated by any of the prejudices and passions that have prevailed in party times. It is my earnest wish that all considerations of this sort may be entirely laid aside on the present occasion. There are now two candidates in this district, of whom I am told that one receives his principal support from the Democratic party, and the other from the Federal. But this surely is no reason why we should vote for one or the other. Let us look to their real and substantial qualifications, for the office of Member of Congress. I will just ask you to go along with me in a brief review of these; and hope that our minds will be made up on this subject, exactly as we find the one to have an advantage in this respect over the other.\n\nWith regard to Col. DWIGHT—4\n\nHe is a man whose abilities and integrity are not questioned even by his opposers.\n\nHe has been tried and found faithful, having already served us ably and uprightly in the same office for which he is now a candidate.\n\nHis political principles are well known to be sound, enlarged and liberal.\n\nHis political conduct has been remarkable for dignity, moderation, and freedom from party bias.\n\nHe is no less qualified to serve us by his personal influence and interest with those among whom he will find himself at the seat of government, than by his acquaintance with the principles of sound legislation.\n\nHe is a native of Berkshire, and attached to us and our interest by the strongest ties.\n\nHe is a farmer, and thus intimately connected with the most numerous, useful, and responsible class of men in the District.\n\nI can say all this of Col. DWIGHT. I could say no more of any man. If a candidate is able and upright; if he is well acquainted with the duties of the office for which he is supported; if habit has given him skill in the practice of those duties; if he has peculiar advantages and opportunities for performing them; and if circumstances of a peculiar kind dispose him to perform them with greater readiness, I see not what more can be required or had.\n\nExamine this list of qualifications, my friends, and see whether it is not singularly fortunate that they are all found in one individual! I cannot think that you will at present leave out a man thus rarely gifted, from an office which he has discharged so creditably to himself and to his constituents. You would not be apt, in your private concerns, to decline availing yourself of the services of one who had been faithful, diligent, and useful in your employment, merely for the sake of employing another with whose merits you were not so well acquainted.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Jarvis, the other candidate,5 I admit with pleasure that his integrity is not to be doubted. He has also shown great talents in the exercise of his profession. In the course of my business, I have been sometimes led to attend the courts at Lenox, and have been entertained by his ingenious manner of managing causes, and the flashes of wit with which his arguments are usually enlivened.\n\nI am told also that he has written a book entitled the Republican, containing many excellent observations on the science of government, taken from a variety of authors; and that copies of this work have been sent to Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson, each of which gentlemen has had the civility to write the author a very polite letter on the subject.6\n\nI am told likewise that he has gained great popularity in the town of Pittsfield, by supporting certain measures very offensive to the town of Boston, lately proposed in the Legislature of this State.7\n\nBut after all it seems to me that the balance of fitness and qualifications for the place of Member of Congress is in favor of Col. DWIGHT. I cannot help saying also, that I regret very much that Mr. Jarvis should have consented to become a candidate against him. I should have been glad to see all opposition to the re-election of Col. DWIGHT laid aside. He has entered upon his parliamentary career with great promise of success and usefulness;—I should be glad to have him continue in it, till he gains that rank and influence on the floor of Congress that he soon must;—till he has had time to do for the reputation and interests of the North, all that his talents enable him to do. These are my feelings. I claim no credit for them—but in his opposers they would have been magnanimous. They have, however, chosen to take a different course,—but in this, I am inclined to think, that the great body of our citizens will have too much prudence and good sense to follow them. The electors of the Berkshire District will, I hope, bear in mind a certain passage of Scripture, which I take the liberty to quote, not irreverently, but as a maxim of practical wisdom—No man having drank old wine straightway desireth new for he saith the old is better.8\n\nDRAPER.9\n\nMANUSCRIPT: NYPL–GR (draft) TEXT: Berkshire Star, Stockbridge, Thursday, October 31, 1822.\n\n1.

Jarvis’ proponent in the Pittsfield Sun had demanded, “On questions when the gigantic powers of eastern talents and eastern wealth were reared against the country interest, was he not the bold and fearless advocate of your rights?” Had he not urged a tax on “the immense sums of money invested in Insurance Companies, and which heretofore have escaped unnoticed and untaxed?”\n\n8.

Dana\n\nGreat Barrington Nov. 17 1822.\n\nDear Sir\n\nI have been some disappointed at not having seen you in Great Barrington this fall—though I hardly expected you would tempt the Yellow Fever, in New York.1\n\nThere is some justice in your reproofs. I acknowledge myself to be a bad correspondent—but I am not without apology. I write very little—there is a sort of sterility, I believe, in my genius,—but why, my dear sir, must you always wait for an answer from me before you write again—I hold that in a correspondence it is the duty of each party to contribute according to his ability. Now, as you are a practised and experienced author, fertile in intellectual resources, with a host of fine ideas at your command, and a rich wardrobe of fine dresses for them, if you were to write two letters to my one, you would hardly do your share.—\n\nYesterday I received the Centinel of Wednesday the 13th. It contains a furious attack on your last Number of the Idle Man. I send you an answer to it, which I would have directed immediately to the Editor of the Centinel without troubling you with it—but I recollected the squeamishness of the Boston Editors, and fearing that if I sent it to Russell I should hear no more of it, I concluded to inclose it to you.2 If you should think it worth while, you will hand it to Mr. Phillips or some other friend with my request that he would get it inserted in one of the Newspapers.—It is amusing to think that any body should take alarm at your books, but at all events it is a fortunate circumstance. There is no class of works that excite so much curiosity and get so much notoriety and so great a run, as those of which the ability is undisputed but the morality a little doubtful.—Therefore, though the fears of your well wisher, as he styles himself, appear to me supremely ridiculous and groundless—and though I am half inclined to believe them affected yet I am not sorry that he has come out with them.—It will draw more attention to the work,—besides giving me the pleasure of telling the public what I think of it—But if, as may perhaps be the case—and I do not know that this is not the most probable event—the attack on your work should be only laughed at by those who may meet with it, and then forgotten—why then it will do you no harm you know.—\n\nI rejoice at what you tell me, that you have in some measure regained your composure and serenity of mind.3 It must be so;—life must have its cheerful as well as its gloomy moments, or it would be insupportable. It is a common and rather trite topic with moralists to compare the life of man to the natural year, and to run a parallel through their various stages of youth maturity and decline, but they resemble each other quite as much in the alternations of storm and sunshine with which they are diversified.—\n\nNon semper imbres nubibus hispidos\n\nManant in agros; aut mare Caspium\n\nVexant inaequales procellae\n\nUsque; nec Armeniis in oris\n\nAmice Valgi, stat glacies iners\n\nMenses per omnes; aut Aquilonibus\n\nQuerceta Gargani laborant\n\nEt foliis viduantur orni.4\n\nIs your work sold at any of the bookstores in Albany? I have heard several persons complain that they have sent there for it without being able to get it.\n\nNow it is healthy again in New York I suppose you will go there. I shall expect to see you here either on your way thither or your return.—Remember me to all my friends in your quarter & believe me\n\nTruly yours\n\nWM. C.

To the COLUMBIAN CENTINEL, Boston\n\n[Great Barrington, c. November 17, 1822]\n\nTHE IDLE MAN. Vol. II.—No. 1.\n\nIt is a common amusement with a certain class of ingenious gentlemen, when there are no convenient objects at hand on which to exert their spirit of adventure, to conjure up scare-crows of their own invention, equip them in the most frightful manner their imagination can suggest, and when they have made them sufficiently hideous, to fall foul of them tooth and nail, batter them terribly, and scatter about without remorse the horrible paraphernalia in which they had just drest them up. Somebody, who calls himself a well wisher to the Author of the Idle Man, has given the public an entertainment of this kind in the Centinel of Nov. 13th. I must confess I was a little startled at the zeal and fury with which he assaulted his chimera; I began to think him in blood earnest, and to have some apprehensions that what he flew at so fiercely was in reality the dangerous and detestable thing he seemed to think it.\n\nBut as it is not my way to make up my opinion hastily on such subjects, I thought it might be well just to look at the book which had the odd fortune to call forth so much clamour from the well wisher of its Author. I took up the 1st No. of Vol. 2d. of the Idle Man, to see if I could find in it those pernicious tendencies which the writer in the Centinel considers as so apparent. At first the narrative seemed to me rather heavy, but, as I proceeded, my attention became strongly fixed, and I was soon so absorbed in the perusal that I wholly forgot my original purpose.1\n\nI was carried along by a sort of fearful interest which I had not the power to resist. I was made to watch, from its very birth, the progress of the latent distemper of the imagination, the secret predisposition to insanity that sometimes lurks in minds otherwise finely constituted, to see its gathering strength from a variety of circumstances, and at length breaking out in the commission of acts of horror, and finally destroying its wretched victim.2\n\nWhen I had done reading the work, I set myself to reflect on its moral tendency, and I have the pleasure of assuring those who have not seen this Number of the Idle Man, that it is as harmless as it is profoundly interesting. I cannot see that the Author’s aim is to show, as the writer in the Centinel would seem to insinuate, that society exerts an unfriendly influence on great minds, and that to such, the soft and gentle ties of society are a curse and a spell of evil. It seems to me that he only attempts what is innocent enough, namely, to describe the workings of a disease of the imagination, from the first morbid speck, to the time when it has wholly mastered the reason; to show by what strange and unthought of means it is fostered and how perversely it makes its food of what would produce in other minds only a healthful and cheerful excitement. Such is the plan, nor is it executed in such a manner as to give any just occasion for censure. We acknowledge the power of genius, but it is not employed to make us in love with the deeds or the fate of the hero of this story. The very strength and pathos with which his reasonings, his fancies, and his feelings are given, only serve to make us see more clearly the error that pervades them. The path he has trod is shown to us in dark and fearful colours. I am sure that it is not drawn so as to excite in anyone the wish to tread it after him. Let us rather say that it is marked out that it may be dreaded and avoided.\n\nThe writer in the Centinel has some very pretty sentiments about the beneficial influences of society—the misfortune is that they are nothing to the purpose. There is no attempt in the narrative of PAUL FELTON to disgust men with society—its effect upon the mind of PAUL is not represented as more unfortunate than that of solitude, each is made to do its work. It was in solitude that his mind was cultivated and impressed with its peculiar bias; it was there too that the malady grew upon him and was nourished, which finally destroyed both him and the innocent creature connected with him.\n\nBut though the writer in the Centinel has succeeded very well in the province of sentiment, he seems to have failed in that of reasoning. “Unable,” says he, “to display the workings of a mighty mind engaged in a mighty cause, with all its vast faculties intensely bent to the accomplishment of an adequate object, he [the author of the Idle Man]3 has represented his hero as yielding to the morbid influence of a diseased imagination,” &c. The influence of a diseased imagination must be morbid of course, and so far the writer’s logic is good, though at the expense of a little tautology; but when he says, that because the author of the Idle Man has done one thing, it is therefore certain that he is unable to do another, it seems to me that he strains hard for an inference. If the author of that work has chosen to represent his hero under the dominion of a distempered fancy, (a subject by the way which Shakespeare has not disdained, and which has called forth some of the proudest efforts of his genius) are we therefore to conclude that he was not capable of showing him in his sober senses? I might as well conclude that because Shakespeare wrote Hamlet, it is impossible that he could have written Julius Cesar; or that because I have seen the writer in the Centinel fighting with his own shadow, he is incapable of doing any thing else.\n\nBut the writer says that the developements of the mysteries of the human soul exhibited in this No. of the Idle Man are unnecessary, and asks why they were made. Alas! many things have been written both in the olden time and in these days of degeneracy quite as unnecessary as the story of Paul Felton.—Beautiful revelations of love and pity, powerful representations of stronger and fiercer emotions have been given us and continue to be given, by gifted spirits, without the least necessity in the world. For my part, I rejoice that my countryman has contributed his share to these; and am far from dreading any pernicious consequence from what he has done. I dwell with interest on the disclosures he has made of what is in man, and am conscious of no evil influence. To the sound mind they can do no harm, and he who is predisposed to insane wanderings, would extract melancholy, I suppose, from a description of Adam and Eve in Paradise.\n\nY.4\n\nMANUSCRIPT: Unrecovered TEXT: Columbian Centinel, Boston, November 27, 1822, p. 1.\n\n1. “Paul Felton,” the last of three short novels Dana wrote for The Idle Man, was reprinted in his Poems and Prose Writings (Philadelphia and Boston, 1833), pp. 271–377.\n\n2. This story reflects the deep impression Edmund Kean’s acting of Shakespearean roles had made on Dana the preceding year, when he had written, “It has been said that Lear was a study for any one who would make himself acquainted with the workings of an insane mind. There is no doubt of it. Nor is it less true, that the acting of Kean was a complete embodying of these working.” See 71.5. Paul Felton’s derangement on the desolate heath, and his companionship with the mad boy Abel, strongly suggest Lear and Edgar. Felton’s suspicion of his innocent wife, Esther, his jealousy of her rejected suitor Ridgley, and his eventual murder of Esther, unmistakably echo Othello.\n\n3. Brackets as in printed text.\n\n4.

Bryant of Great Barrington in the County of Berkshire & Commth of Massachusetts for a valuable consideration do hereby transfer and convey to Charles Sedgwick, Robert F. Barnard, Thomas Twining Benjamin Sheldon & Henry W. Dwight Esquires the Copy Right of the annexed production, written by me entitled—The Heroes—a Farce, in three Acts.1\n\nWILLIAM C. BRYANT\n\nMANUSCRIPT: HEHL.\n\n1. On February 2, 1823, Peter Rush Bryant, then in Great Barrington being tutored by his brother for entrance to college, wrote his mother, “Cullen has written a farce upon the late duel and sent it somewhere by the mail. He is very secret when writing anything.” Weston Family Papers. This jeu d’esprit was evidently the product of a dare by Bryant’s fellow-lawyers during a county court term. An agreement signed at Lenox on October 31, 1822, by those named in his conveyance states, “We the subscribers hereby engage & promise to pay to Wm. C. Bryant Esqr. the sum of Two hundred [fifty] Dollars within three months from date, provided the sd W. C. Bryant shall within that time write a farce founded on the story of Col. Cumming & George McDuffie [see 88.3] & transfer the copy right thereof to the subscribers.” NYPL–BG. Barnard was the father of Frederick A. P. Barnard, president of Columbia University from 1864 to 1889. Twining and Sheldon are otherwise unidentified. In the margin of the above-mentioned agreement Bryant wrote, “This paper was retd to me in Apl 1823 cancelled without a farthing being paid upon it.”\n\n88. To Charles Sedgwick\n\nGreat Barrington Feb. 12, 1823.\n\nDear Sir.—\n\nThe line you sent me last week I did not receive till Wednesday afternoon, when it was handed me by Mr. Griswold;1 and since that time I have found no opportunity to get a letter to Lenox.\n\nYou request me to give you my opinion on the best method of disposing of the farce. I may come too late with what I have to say on that subject—if so let this be a letter of apology.\n\nIn the first place then I say—That the decision of this question must depend very much on the merits of the production. If it is not likely to succeed on the stage my advice is to do nothing with it. I am really so doubtful of my abilities in the department I have attempted, that were you to be of opinion that it would not take with the public, I should be neither disappointed nor mortified in the least, and should cancel a certain paper that I have,2 as readily as I would blot a bad line out of a poem. Therefore I entreat you to lay aside all respect for the vanity of authorship, in making your decision—and all apprehensions of offending a sensitiveness in regard to their own works which afflicts most writers, and which I myself have my full share of in other instances but which in the present, I can assure you has no place. Then again, if the public have already got enough of Cumming and McDuffie and are glutted with the witticisms and squibs and moralizing on that subject, as may well be the case (you can judge better than I) then I would give the same advice and should myself take the same course as if the play were good for nothing. But if, not merely from the intrinsic merit of the production but from other circumstances there is a good prospect—not a probable one merely but a pretty certain one that it will succeed on the stage—then I would offer it to the managers of some theatre and get it printed at the same time. If not likely to succeed on the stage it is not likely to succeed at all—for who ever heard of such a thing as a closet farce!—In case you do any thing with it I cannot tell which would be the better place for bringing it out. The subject, I think would be less stale at Boston than at New York—but then the Boston folks are so full of notions. If they get a maggot in their heads they will cry up a thing at a furious rate—if not it falls like lead. At New York the gale of patronage blows more steadily; and the rain of public favour drops upon what is mediocre and tolerable as well as upon what is taking and fashionable—Albany I know nothing of.—The mail bag is come—Goodbye—3\n\nYrs truly\n\nW C BRYANT\n\nI leave the whole matter with you to decide—\n\nMANUSCRIPT: MHS ADDRESS: Charles Sedgwick Esq / Lenox POSTAL ANNOTATION: PAID 6.\n\n1.

William Cumming. See Edwin L. Green, George McDuffie (Columbia, South Carolina: The State Company, 1936), pp. 33–36. Sedgwick tried, through his brothers Henry and Robert in New York, to find a producer for the farce, writing Bryant on February 14, “In regard to the satire of the play we both know that it is excellent—As to its success neither you nor I nor any body else can tell before hand.… One word abt. the contract—the bond—the money is fairly earned & fairly due” (but was not paid; see 87.1). NYPL–BG. Six weeks later Charles reported to Bryant his brothers’ lack of enthusiasm: “Happily for me you are too well acquainted with the opinions of the Sedgwick tribe to take in dudgeon Mr. Harry’s free sayings abt. the farce.” March 28, 1823, NYPL–BG. So Bryant filed his play with other discarded manuscripts, and seems never to have mentioned it again. See Life, I, 187–188; Birdsall, Berkshire County, pp. 278–279.\n\n89. To Charles Webster, Editor, BERKSHIRE STAR\n\n[Great Barrington, c. April 15, 1823]1\n\nMr. W.\n\nIt is no uncommon thing either with individuals or bodies of men when galled by the utterance of unwelcome truths against which they cannot well defend themselves to give vent to the violence of their feelings and endeavour to divert the attention of the publick by making a great clamour about something else. A few harmless remarks in the Star of the 27th of March last on the course it was expected the federalists of Pittsfield would take in relation to the late Senatorial election drew forth from a writer in the last Star a most bitter tirade against a certain town in the South part of the County.—I expected to have seen some justification of the conduct of our Pittsfield friends or some extenuation at least, if not an absolute denial of the charge brought against them.2 No such thing. The writer has done like a man who because <his windows had been pelted by mischievous boys> he had heard some unfavourable report about himself, should start out into the highway to horsewhip the first man he meets. In answer to the accusation against Pittsfield he has presented us with a long list of political sins committed by the inhabitants [of] a certain other place of which he deigns to give us no other information than that it lies in the south part of Berkshire—3 I applaud the ingenuity of the stratagem. I must own that it was the wisest course that an inhabitant of Pittsfield could take on this delicate occasion. It was natural too that one trained to legal investigations should betray some traces of his profession in his mode of thinking on political subjects, and following in some sort the analogy of that rule by which counsel select the proper evidence to support the causes they undertake, should endeavour to get rid of an unwelcome accusation against his townsmen by the best expedient the nature of the case will admit of.—On the subject which called forth the remarks of this writer, I have nothing to say. The charge has not been denied or extenuated; the mischief has already been done and cannot be repaired by talking about it. But it may not perhaps be altogether unamusing or uninstructive to see in what manner the writer, who signs himself No Town Sticker has made and supported the charges which he intended to divert the publick odium from the town of which he himself is an inhabitant.—If I can form any judgment of that place meant by this writer I feel no more partiality for it than I do for Pittsfield, and whenever it shall so far forget itself as to assume an impunity that does not belong to it let the publick […].\n\nThere was says the writer a gross and palpable compromise made in the Nomination of Senators for 1819 for the purpose of aiding the Congressional Ticket. I was not better pleased with this [picked?] Nomination than the writer himself—It was too much like the Pittsfield nomination of 1822. But I never thought of ascribing it to interested motives. It was the opinion of many worthy and judicious men all over the state at that time that a union of the Parties was both desirable and practicable when there was no storm and stress. But the attempt to effect that union I think in this County failed. The break was too green to heal over, the two parties retained too much personal feeling and too much recollection of past animosity to coalesce. The experiment was an unfortunate one indeed, but who has authorized the writer to say that it was got up to serve a local ambition?\n\nThere is no action that can be performed,—the most virtuous the most disinterested & praiseworthy, to which a malignant ingenuity cannot assign some sinister purpose.—\n\nThe next political crime laid to the charge of a certain town in the south part of the County is that its delegates in the convention of 1820 were desirous of furnishing a candidate from their own town. Granting this to be true, and I do not know or care whether it is so or not, was this an offence of unusual enormity?—Have not the delegates from other towns committed the same crime with impunity—and is it not natural that gentlemen should give their suffrages on such occasions for those with whose deserts they are best acquainted?—But it would seem not so when the town to which the writer alludes acquiesced in the decision of the convention.—\n\nBut there was no nomination in 1821 except one made by an individual and an inhabitant of the nameless town [who] went to a gentleman of Pittsfield and proposed to him to stand candidate at the approaching election of Senators.—I have no means of knowing whether this story be true or not, but suppose for a moment that it is—Will it be said that the individual who made this proposal had not as much right to meddle with the nomination as the individual who finally published it? Or if the people do not choose to send their delegates and make a nomination themselves is it the pleasure of this writer that nobody shall be permitted to propose a candidate to the suffrage of the people through the medium of the newspapers? Or when a gentleman is to be nominated by his friends would he forbid that they should first consult him respecting it?\n\nThe writer then goes on to say that in 1822 Mr. Jarvis4 was put in nomination to the exclusion of a candidate from the southern part of the county, that this nomination originated in a local feeling wholly foreign to the interests of Pittsfield or the honour of the candidate, and that the object was entirely different from the one indicated by the measure. That this measure had the effect of preventing the nomination of a candidate from the south, I admit—that it was intended to produce that effect I deny. Equally unfounded is the assertion that the nomination was made without regard to the merits of the candidate, or that its object was different from what would naturally be inferred from the measure itself.—These bold assertions are as gratuitous as they are bold.—They have been made in the face of the county—In the face of the county I challenge the writer to produce a shadow of proof in their favour. Let him make his words good if he can.—\n\nThe writer conceives that the nomination of Mr. Leavenworth was not correctly made.5 I hardly know how it should have been made to suit the fastidious humour of this writer. He is dissatisfied with nominations made in conventions and with nominations made out of them. But a nomination of a gentleman who had only one vote less in the caucus than one of the persons who was at length agreed on as candidate, made at a time when it was too late to call a convention seems to me liable to as few objections as are usually brought against any nomination whatever.—The writer thinks on the whole that he shall vote for Mr. Leavenworth. If he kept this resolution he deserves credit for it. Let him share the praise of fidelity and constancy with the Seraph Abdiel.\n\n------------------------faithful found\n\nAmong the faithless-------------------------6\n\nOf the various charges of artifice, treachery, impudence stupidity dishonour faithless ingratitude and pertinacious selfishness I do not think it necessary to take any notice. They are cheap terms of vituperation and may be applied with as much ease where they are not deserved as where they are.—But when the writer of the article I have been considering looks over it in his cooler moments and sees into what intemperance of language his passions have betrayed him, when he sees how indifferent and inconsequential in themselves are the facts on which he has founded his charges, and how destitute of all proof is the assertion that they originated in bad motives, if he is a person of that fair and candid mind that I am still willing to believe him notwithstanding his heat on this subject I am sure that his natural ingenuousness will summon the blood into his cheeks.—\n\n[unsigned]\n\nMANUSCRIPT: NYPL–GR (draft).\n\n1.

Cf. Paradise Lost V.896–897.\n\n90. To Andrews Norton1\n\n[Great Barrington, c. August 1, 1823]\n\nThere are three religious societies in Great Barrington—the Congregational—the Episcopal—& the Baptist Societies.—The two former are nearly equal to each other in point of Numbers and include about two thirds of our population. The Baptist Society comprises about three fourths of the remaining third, and the rest are with hardly an exception Methodists.\n\nThe Congregationalists are mostly Calvinists, the Episcopalians Arminians—The members of these two societies living every where intermixed with each other and having churches in the same neighbourhood and settled ministers of a very respectable character there prevails a good deal of jealousy among them—The Congregationalists cannot see in the Episcopalians the proper mystical evidences of Richard Sullivan’s regeneration2 and the Episcopalians accuse the Congregationalists with neglecting those positive ordinances which are presented as the conditions of salvation or what is the same thing suffering them to be administered by unauthorized & unconsecrated hands.—The C are continually labouring to get up a high state of religious excitement—the Ep discourage & retard it. The Baptists living in a separate quarter of the town and including in their number many who have no other care about religion than to get rid of being taxed for its support seem pretty indifferent about other sects. The more conscientious among them however prefer the Congregationalists & sometimes attend their worship—The Methodists are rather inclined to the Ep form of worship—though they are apt to consider its followers as too cold & doubt the vitality of their religion—\n\nIn almost every Town in this vicinity there is a society of Congregationalists of the Calvinistic persuasion with a settled minister. There are however several Baptist congregations one or two Methodist Societies and a sprinkling of Universalists and Episcopalians.—\n\n2. Of the inhabitants of Great Barrington a very few only are professed Unitarians—The Unitarians of this Town are generally men of correct morals and upright dealings—but from having taken a disgust to religion in the status in which it is taught in the Calvinistic pulpits are not I fear the most devotional or pious. They would however I have no doubt be willing to promote any project which has for its design the diffusion of correct views of Christianity—\n\n3rd. Our Representative Dr. B Rogers3 might perhaps communicate some information on the subject.—\n\n4th & 5th The measures used to oppose the spread of Unitarianism are violent denunciations of its doctrines from the orthodox pulpits and exhortations to read no publications written for the purpose of insinuating into the mind the dangerous and seducing doctrines of that sect. Unitarianism is put on the same footing with Mahometanism & Deism, and its followers are denied the name of Christians and its doctrines represented as bringing eternal perdition on those who embrace them.4 The Unitarian clergy are represented as artful & subtle reasoners who have refined away all the essentials of religion, and though they may be in the main tolerably moral are attached to the pleasures of the world & destitute of real piety—Harvard University comes in for its share of vituperation, and is in fact the great dread of most of our orthodox clergy.5—Sometimes the opinions of the Unitarians are [much misre]presented—\n\n6th. The effects of these representations are what might naturally be expected—Those who place implicit confidence in the opinions of the clergy have imbibed a sort of horror at the mysterious heresy whose doctrines they are forbidden to look too narrowly into, and some of this feeling is naturally extended to the persons of its professors. Upon others, and their number is increasing, the only effect of so much noise about Unitarianism has been to excite their curiosity to know what it is—and having been acquainted with its tenets they are grown more charitable […].\n\n7th Unitarianism is not by any means declining—Six years since when I came to the County of Berkshire there was not to my knowledge a Unitarian in it—Now there is scarcely a town in which there are not a few—professedly so—in some numbers who enter into its views of Christianity—It was about three years since that the Orthodox clergy of this county were apprised that the heresy of Unitarianism had passed the barriers of our mountains, and general agreement was entered into by the association of this district to preach it down.—They preached accordingly till they had wearied both themselves and their hearers—till the spirit of enquiry had gathered strength from the means used to suppress it, and they whose tenets were denounced had been stimulated to make some exertions in their turn—At present the clergy seem to have varied their mode of warfare. They appear to consider the heresy of Unitarianism as an evil whose growth cannot be checked by Human means, and are employing the usual means to produce in all those possible that preternatural state of religious feeling called an awakening by which they hope to effect at last [its] extermination.\n\n8th. In addition to the distribution of tracts I should think that a few discourses from a preacher of rational Christianity in some of our best towns would be attended with great advantage and tend very much to remove the erroneous notions entertained concerning these doctrines, and prove what many profess to doubt the connection between them and piety—Many from motives of curiosity would go to hear an Unitarian preacher who could not be persuaded to read a tract.—\n\n9th. The Christian Disciple is taken in this Town and some other parts of the County—The Unitarian Miscellany has an agent here and several subscribers. The Christian Register is taken in one of the Towns of this vicinity—Some Episcopalians take the Churchman’s Magazine. But the great vehicle of religious intelligence—the great conduit of spiritual nourishment to the good people of this place is the Religious Intelligencer, to which its importunate agents have secured a wide circulation, and of which at least 300 copies come weekly to the inhabitants of the County of Berkshire—Orthodox tracts are almost the only ones circulated and read, and these are distributed with great assiduity.6\n\n10—I think that well chosen Unitarian tracts would be read with some interest and with a good effect in this vicinity—\n\n11th. 12 & 13—Among the Orthodox strictly so called there is but little charity toward Unitarians. They are lost without exception. But in many of those societies which support orthodox clergymen there are numbers favourably disposed toward Unitarianism.—The Towns of Stockbridge & Pittsfield contain many Unitarians—gentlemen of great respectability.—I would mention the following as gentlemen from whom information might be obtained upon the questions addressed in your circular & with whom the committee might correspond.—Dr Nathaniel Preston, Postmaster, Sheffield7—Geo. Whitney Esq. Stockbridge8—Chas. Sedgwick Esq., Lenox—Saml. McKay Esq. Pittsfield9—Hon George Hull Sandisfield—10\n\n14. The Universalists have many followers in the neighbouring towns of Sheffield Egremont & Washington & some very respectable ones—One Pickering from Andover—a man of considerable talent at extemporaneous speaking has been the great apostle of that sect, and done much to diffuse its doctrines—Many Universalist tracts written by him have been distributed in the vicinity—It is difficult to say what description of Universalism is most prevalent—Pickering discarded the doctrine of future punishment altogether—but other teachers introduced by him favour the notion of a limited punishment—11 The former doctrine as it appears to me however is caught up eagerly by the profligate and desperate—though it is embraced by many virtuous people—The Universalists in this neighbourhood seem sometimes a little inclined to identify themselves with Unitarians, & some preachers among them (they have no pastorates) have argued agst. the Error of the Trinity—I have given Unitarian tracts to some of them & had the satisfaction to see that they were read with interest & effect. I have never found Unitarian books in their homes.\n\n[unsigned]\n\nMANUSCRIPT: NYPL–GR (draft).\n\n1. On July 15 Professor Norton (see 78.6) had sent Bryant a questionnaire beginning, “What is the state of Religion in Barrington and its vicinity?” with the explanation, “The preceding … has been sent round by a committee of a society composed of gentlemen in Boston and its neighborhood—several of the Boston clergy, of the officers of the college, and some laymen such as Mr. Quincy, Mr. R. Sullivan &c. No gentleman of the committee having the pleasure of your acquaintance, I was requested to forward it to you; and you can if you please return an answer directed to me.” NYPL–BG.

The previous year Catharine Sedgwick had written a friend, “I quite long to look upon a Christian minister who does not regard me as a heathen and a publican.… Some of my friends here have, as I learn, been a little troubled [at her becoming an author], but, after the crime of confessed Unitarianism, nothing can surprise them.” Her devoted aunt remarked to Miss Sedgwick about that time, “Come and see me as often as you can, dear, for you know, after this world, we shall never meet again.” Sedgwick, Life and Letters, pp. 156–157.\n\n5. Under the influence of such Unitarian pioneers as Henry Ware, Sr. (1764–1845) and William Ellery Channing (1780–1842), Harvard had become the center of liberal religious views. The citadel of Calvinistic orthodoxy was now Andover Theological Seminary. Rusk, Emerson, p. 99.\n\n6. The Christian Disciple and Theological Review (1813–1823), then edited at Boston by Henry Ware, Jr., was succeeded by the Christian Examiner. The Unitarian Miscellany and Christian Monitor (1821–1824), begun at Baltimore by Jared Sparks, was conducted at this time by Francis W. P. Greenwood, later pastor of King’s Chapel at Boston. The Christian Register: An Evangelical Magazine (1822–1823), edited by James Blythe of Lexington, Kentucky, lasted only one year. The Churchman’s Magazine of New Haven appeared intermittently between 1804 and 1827, when it gave way to the Episcopal Watchman.

But as it is uncertain whether he will be received, and as he will not enter the institution until June, if at all, he has concluded in the mean time to apply himself to his college studies so that if he should be rejected at West Point he might not miss the opportunity of entering some one of the colleges without losing a year.1\n\nI am not certain that West Point would not be a good place for him. The learned professions a[re] getting to be a poor way of making a livelihood, and he will at least have the advantage of being able to choose the military profession if he should happen to like it.—\n\nPeter says that he wishes you to send for him about the […]2 see that it will be convenient […]2 Frances has been this summer in a state of health far from being firm, and she finds herself uniformly ill on any unusual fatigue.—I think therefore that I must get my household into such a state as to give her as little hard work to do as I can.—\n\nPeter seems to think that he must have a cloak but wishes that the plaid may not be bought till he comes home, as he would like to have a voice in the choosing of it. It took nine yards for my cloak but it is made very full.—He likewise wishes me to say that he will need another pair of pantaloons this winter.—\n\nIf he should apply himself to his studies this winter—you will not of course think of getting a school for him.3—It is possible however that he may not study so well at home as at some other place; and if he should find that to be the case with him I would advise him to leave home instantly.\n\nWe are all tolerably well—Frances desires her love—\n\nYour affectionate son\n\n[signature missing]\n\nMANUSCRIPT: BCHS.\n\n1.

To Isaac Parker1\n\nGreat Barrington Oct 5 1823\n\nSir—\n\nIn the action Grotius Bloss vs Augustus Tobey on which a verdict was rendered at the last Term of the S[upreme] J[udicial] C[ourt] in Berkshire & a motion made in arrest of judgment, I have just been told that a written argument was expected of me as counsel for the pl[aintif]f immediately.2 I have not [had] time since I learnt this to prepare one, and as the cause is an important one to my client on account of the magnitude of the Bill of Cost, and several questions of some nicety are involved in it I hope that a little time will be indulged us, and as soon as may be, Mr. Jarvis & myself will transmit written arguments.\n\nAt the time the motion in arrest of judgment was made which was immediately before the close of the session I was absent and the associate counsel in the haste of the moment & without time for deliberation moved to take judgment on the first & seventh counts. I am at present rather inclined to think that these are not the best in the declaration, particularly the former.—The reason why an earlier election was not made will be understood from the following circumstances. Mr. Jarvis at the time the verdict was rendered recommended to me to look over the declaration and select such counts as I thought most proper to receive the verdict on—The Judge informed us that we had a right to receive the verdict on any of the counts as it was a general one—but went on to say that he did not see why we were not safe enough in taking a general verdict—adding however that we must “judge for ourselves.”—In consequence of this intimation, I did not request that opportunity of examining the several counts which without doubt would have been allowed us and a general verdict was entered.—\n\nUnder these circumstances I am not without hopes that the court will suffer us to amend our motion,—particularly as the other party cannot in any manner be prejudiced by it.\n\nAs soon as I can consult Mr. Jarvis I will forward the amended motion for the consideration of the Court.—\n\nI remain Sir\n\nvery respectfully yrs.\n\nWM C. BRYANT—\n\nMANUSCRIPT: NYPL–GR (draft) ADDRESS: Hon Isaac Parker.\n\n1. Isaac Parker (1768–1830, Harvard 1786), Chief Justice since 1814 of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, was also Royall Professor at the Harvard Law School, of which he had been the principal founder. Bryant knew Parker would hold court terms at Lenox in March and September 1824.\n\n2. At the June 1823 term of the Court of Common Pleas Bryant won for storekeeper Grotius Bloss of nearby Alford a judicial assessment of damages and costs against a neighbor, Augustus Tobey, who had accused Bloss publicly of burning his own store to collect the insurance on its goods. This judgment was confirmed by a jury in September at the Supreme Judicial Court term. But Tobey’s lawyers, led by veteran John Whiting (see 41.2), moved successfully in arrest of judgment. As Bryant explains, during his absence his associate counsel William C. Jarvis was hurried into a decision which put the victorious plaintiff on the defensive. Bryant’s later “plain, common-sense argument” failed to convince the appellate justices, who overturned the jury verdict in September 1824 and levied court costs against Bryant’s client. Supreme Judicial Court Records, May Term, 1823–May Term, 1827, pp. 164–169, Berkshire County Court, Pittsfield, Massachusetts. See also Bigelow, Bryant, pp. 38–39; Life, I, 201–202; Berkshire Eagle, June 20, 1878. This reversal of judgment was crucial in Bryant’s decision soon afterward to quit the law for journalism. Half a century later he wrote of the verdict, “By a piece of pure chicane, in a case the merits of which were with my client and were perfectly understood by the parties, the court, the jury and every body who heard the trial or heard of it, my client was turned out of court after the jury had awarded him damages and deprived of what they intended he should receive. This did not much heighten my respect for the law.” Letter to unidentified correspondent, May 7, 1878, Lafayette College Library.\n\n93. To Messrs. Robert B. Southwick & Co.1\n\nGreat Barrington Dec 27, 1823.\n\nGentlemen.\n\nSometime since I wrote you that I had seen Jno. C. Deming and that he promised to call on you and make some arrangement of the demand against him and [Cyrenus] Stevens. Since that time I have not heard from you.\n\nAt present I have some news to communicate concerning him and Stevens of no very agreeable nature.\n\nA man in West Stockbridge, a creditor of Deming to a considerable amount, and who had given him money to discharge a certain debt, which he neglected to pay over & appropriated to his own use, was sued on that debt and called on Deming for security. Deming made to him an assignment of all his effects, and in the assignment stipulated that if the property assigned upon being sold should bring more than enough to pay this debt the surplus should be applied towards the payment of other claims which were mentioned in the assignment, and among which I cannot learn that yours was named. The property however, it is said, will not more than pay the debt it was first intended to secure. In the mean time Deming went off to the State of New York, and is now in Albany on the limits.—One of the creditors, whose name was mentioned in the assignment, has attached the property assigned—and the consequence, it is expected, will be a law suit.\n\nWhile these things were transacting, Stevens was buying goods in the City of New York. He purchased, it is said, a considerable assortment, but he has not sent them to this state, nor is it expected that he will. Both they and he are somewhere in your state, and it is likely will not soon be seen here. Stevens it seems owed debts to a considerable amount, and both he and Deming have mutually been security for each other.\n\nSuch are the particulars as far as I have been able to learn them. It was impossible to secure any thing on your demand; the first news of Deming’s failure being after the assignment of his property.—\n\nI hope you may be able to get something of them in your State—though they will probably attempt to keep their property as much under cover as they can—\n\nI am Gentlemen\n\nYrs.

If I were to say that I leave [it] wholly to your generosity, I should show myself destitute of that quality—for you might then be induced to give too much through fear of giving too little. I will not therefore leave it to be settled exactly in that way. You say that you are offered terms which put it in your power to pay for what assistance you want, and that you have engaged the support of some of the best writers in Boston and its vicinity.3 Let the compensation you allow me be proportioned to what you allow others, and such as the terms offered you by your publishers enable you easily to make, and whatever it may be, I shall be entirely satisfied. I hope, at least, that you will think my assistance of sufficient value to entitle me to receive the “Gazette,” as it comes out.\n\nOn such conditions I will send to the publishers of your [work in th]e course of the year, the number of poems you men[tion. In]4 the mean time you will permit me to express the hope that your undertaking may be successful. I have no doubt that it will be so; the demand for such things is increasing, and what is of more consequence they are getting into better hands.\n\nI am Sir\n\nYr. obt. humble Servt.\n\nWM. C.

Parsons replied on February 14 to Bryant’s suggestion, “Let the compensation you allow me be proportioned to what you allow others” (Letter 94): “You speak of the terms we offer other gentlemen, but the plain truth is, there are almost none whose aid we should value so much, and therefore think compensation greater in proportion to the amount received than they have, less than that you should have.—The result to which we come, is, that we ask you to furnish us, an average of about 100 lines a month, and receive for it, $200 a year—Less than this we could not offer, and more we cannot afford.” NYPL–BG.\n\n3.

And this, I think was all that he was paid.” Parsons to Godwin, October 27, 1879, NYPL–GR. In fact, between April 1, 1824, and May 15, 1825, Bryant’s contribution of twenty-three poems totaling 1,187 lines was almost precisely that asked by Parsons. His compensation was thus nearly nine dollars a poem, rather than two.\n\n4. Letter 95.\n\n98. To Messrs. Robert B. Southwick & Co.\n\nGreat Barrington Apl 10 1824.\n\nGentlemen.\n\nOn last Monday all the hides in the vats of Cyrenus Stevens in West Stockbridge were attached and taken out on a writ in favour of Spencer & Crocker of West Stockbridge1 against Stevens. As soon as I learnt this fact which was yesterday I went to W. Stockbridge to learn more particularly what had been done. On my arrival I found that 500 hides had been attached, of which 400 were afterwards replevied as the property of Simeon Brown of Pittsfield who had taken them away with him to Pittsfield. The remaining 100 were slaughter hides. I have thought it my duty to give you this information that you might take such steps as you may think expedient.—\n\nYrs. respectfully\n\nWILLIAM C.

To Theophilus Parsons\n\nGreat Barrington Apl 12 1824.\n\nMy Dear Sir—\n\nYours of the 31st ult. I received two or three days since;1 and I have inclosed you a few contributions for your paper as soon as I could find time to copy them.—2\n\nEvery letter I have received from you has been something more than a week on the road. If you will take the pains to direct them via Hartford they will get to me in two days. Will you be so obliging as to give orders that my copy of the Gazette and other copies which may be taken in Gt Barrington be directed in that manner.—\n\nAs for the payment of the $200.00—it is an old maxim that a good paymaster pays when his work is done:—that, I suppose will be at the end of the year.—It might however be convenient for me to receive $100.00 at the end of 6 mouths—It may be sent by mail, unless I should previously direct otherwise.\n\nI am sir\n\nTruly yours\n\nWILLIAM C. BRYANT\n\nMANUSCRIPT: BPL ADDRESS: Theophilus Parsons Esq / Tauton.—/ Mass. POSTMARK (in script): Gt Barrington Apl. 12. POSTAL ANNOTATION: 25.\n\n1. Parsons wrote on March 31 that the first number of the USLG, though delayed, was in type, and “you will shortly see Rizpah in print.” He asked contributions for the second number by return mail, inquiring how Bryant would like to receive his compensation. NYPL–BG.\n\n2. These were “The Old Man’s Funeral,” USLG, 1 (April 15, 1824), 31; “The Rivulet,” ibid. (May 15), 69–72; and “March,” ibid. (June 1), 64. See Poems (1876), pp. 67–73. The manuscripts of these poems are in HEHL.\n\n100. To Frances F. Bryant\n\nNew York, Apl. 29, 1824.\n\nMy dear Frances—\n\nI have on the whole made up my mind not to come home this week1—the weather has been so bad that I have seen little of the city as yet—and as there is no knowing when I shall be here again, I think I had better take time to look about me before I leave the place.—Miss [Catharine] Sedgwick has undertaken the charge of getting a bonnet for you, but as the weather has been rainy for two or three days past she has not been out, and I do not intend to come away till the bonnet is bought.\n\nI dined yeste[rda]y at Mr. Robert Sedgwick’s in a company of authors. Mr. [James Fenimore] Cooper the novelist—Mr. [Fitz-Greene] Halleck author of Fanny—Mr. [Robert Charles] Sands author of Yamoyden—Mr. Johnson the Reporter2—& some other literary gentlemen—Mr. Cooper engaged the whole conversation to himself—he seems a little giddy with [the] great success his works have met with.3—Hier, au soir, nous allâmes Mons. Ives4 et moi, chez une famille Française, ou nous jouâmes au whist, et parlâmes Français tout le temps.5 Thomas has insisted upon my accompanying him two or three times to Mr Robt Sedgwick’s whose lady6 has a very pretty sister with whom he seems (but that is between ourselves) épris [smitten], and the ladies say there is something in it;—and that is scandal enough for one letter.—\n\nI got in on Sunday Morning at 5 o’clock & heard two sermons from Parson Ware7 & very good ones too—Tuesday we had [Jared] Sparks Editor of the N. American Review to dine with us—a man of very agreeable manners—he was on his way to Boston from Baltimore.—\n\nPlease to tell Dr. Leavenworth, if I do not get home Monday—to make my apology to the world—& get somebody to take down the votes for me, and make the proper memorandums.8—Good bye—Baisez la petite Fanchette pour moi [kiss little Fanny for me]—and give my regards to the family—\n\nYour affectionate husband\n\nWM C. BRYANT.\n\nP. S. I have not told you when to expect me.—If I do not come home this week you may expect me next Wednesday—\n\nW[illiam?] has been very busy with Ama[nd]a—he tells me this morning that she has comp[leted] her purchases of furniture & will probably have a house more magnificently furnished than any other in G. B. which information you may give to all whom it may concern.—9\n\nW C B\n\nMANUSCRIPT: NYPL–GR ADDRESS: Mrs. Frances Bryant / Great Barrington / Mass.—DOCKETED: W. C. B. NY. PUBLISHED (in part): Life, I, 189–190.\n\n1. Henry Sedgwick, aware of Bryant’s growing distaste for legal practice and for Great Barrington, had invited him to visit New York City in the Spring. Sedgwick to Bryant, March 20, 1824, NYPL–BG.\n\n2. William Johnson (1769–1848, Yale 1788), a legal scholar, was Reporter for the Supreme Court of New York and for the Court of Chancery.\n\n3. In his memorial discourse on Cooper in 1852 Bryant recalled having been “somewhat startled, coming as I did from the seclusion of a country life, with a certain emphatic frankness in his manner, which, however, I came at last to like and to admire.” See Bryant, “Cooper,” p. 60.\n\n4. Thomas Earl Ives (1802–1843, Yale 1822), third son of the late Gen. Thomas Ives of Great Barrington and brother of Bryant’s former law partner, George Ives, was later a practicing lawyer at New Orleans. Dexter, Graduates of Yale, Supplement, pp. 93–94.\n\n5. “Last evening Mr. Ives and I went to the home of a French family, where we played whist and spoke French the whole time.”\n\n6. Mrs. Elizabeth Ellery Sedgwick, of Newport, Rhode Island, was herself a woman of notable beauty who had been Washington Allston’s model for his painting of a prophetess. Sedgwick, Life and Letters, pp. 148–150.\n\n7. Rev. William Ware (1797–1852, Harvard 1816), pastor since 1821 of the Second Congregational (Unitarian) Church in New York City. See 63.1.\n\n8. As town clerk of Great Barrington, Bryant was responsible for recording votes in the imminent election for local and state officers. David Leavenworth, a justice of the peace, was then his landlord. See 89.5.\n\n9. Probably William Sherwood of Great Barrington and his bride. See Sherwood to Bryant, February 22, 1823, NYPL–BG. Sherwood later owned the boardinghouse at 385 [West] Fourth Street in Greenwich Village where the Bryants lived after their return from Europe in 1836.\n\n101. To Theophilus Parsons\n\nGreat Barrington May 26, 1824.\n\nMy dear Sir.\n\nYours of the 5th. reached Great Barrington during my absence in attending the Sup. Court at Lenox, where I was detained about a fortnight, and I received yours of the 18th. a day or two after my return. I see that you have found out my foible—a propensity to procrastinate, but I am ashamed to think that it has given you any trouble, and I do not mean that for the future you shall have any cause to reproach me for any want of punctuality.—1\n\nIn the little poem entitled—The Oldman’s Funeral—at the end of the fir"
