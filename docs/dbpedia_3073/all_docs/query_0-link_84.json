Moreover, as Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky explain in this issue, the administration has focused the discussion on retail terrorism, to the exclusion of wholesale terrorism; rarely does anyone call the government to account for supporting, and in large part operating, the most extensive terror network in history. It is difficult to define ter- rorism, so the \"experts\" define it however they want. The report of the Vice President's Task Force on Combatting Ter- rorism is a case in point; it says terrorism is \"the unlawful use or threat of violence against persons or property to further political or social objectives.\" [Emphasis added.] The prob- lem is who decides what is \"lawful\" and what is not. \"International terrorism\" is not the struggle of the Blacks of South Africa and Namibia for national liberation; it is not the fight of the Palestinians for their ancestral lands; it is not the battle of the Nicaraguans to bring democracy to their country after 50 years of dictatorship. International terrorism is the U.S. bombing of Libya; it is the Israeli invasion of Lebanon; it is the South African invasion of Zimbabwe, Angola, and Mozambique; it is the contra war in Nicaragua: and it is the death squads in Chile, El Salvador, and Guatemala. More Secrecy and Intimidation While we continue our struggle to bring you information you cannot find in the mainstream media, the administration is expanding its campaign to restrict the flow of information and to intimidate the media. We warned years ago that the In- telligence Identities Protection Act was just the tip of the iceberg, and that it was not just aimed at stopping this maga- zine, but at chilling the establishment media. Recent CIA pro- nouncements indicate that such intimidation remains a prior- ity. In May the Agency announced that it thought the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Washington Times, Time, and Newsweek should be prosecuted for revealing details of the Ronald Pelton case. While the idea that the administration would ever prosecute Arnaud de Borchgrave's sleazy Moonie rag is preposterous, the other publications were, despite their public indignation, scared. The Post actually censored a lead story. Then in June the CIA attempted to obtain prior review of forthcoming publications not written by former employees. And in July, Casey began to push for the \"You Spy, You Die\" bill, not only preventing convicted spies from keeping the pro- ceeds of their activities or selling the rights to their stories, but also authorizing the government to seize the assets of news- papers or other organizations that might be found guilty of violating the law they threatened to use against coverage of the Pollard case. The CIA is making a push for more power than it has had in decades. As a State Department official told the New York Times (July 12, 1986), \"Casey is dying for it [operational re- sponsibility for the contra war-which he was given]. If we can win, he can walk away with an agency that is rehabilitated to the best days of the cold war, able to conduct wars and throw governments out.\" Rightwing fanatics set up organizations like the \"RAMBO Coalition,\" whose members include Alpha 66, Tradition, Family and Property, and a host of other extremist organiza- tions. Retired General John Singlaub, head of the U.S. Council for World Freedom, announces that the way to deal with ter- rorists is to \"rubblize\" the camps where they live.

He fled to the mountains and spent some years training himself to be his own master spy, combin- ing \"the cunning of the spy with the anxieties of the brutal des- pot whose intelligence he collected,\" and while in exile, he \"mastered twenty-two languages and dialects, traveling over Asia Minor-at the age of fourteen-disguised as a caravan boy. He visited many tribes, learned about their customs and spied upon their military strength.\"' Mithridates returned to Pontus, and, after murdering his mother, his sister (whom he had married), and his sons, spent eighteen years terrorizing the likes of Sulfa, Lucullus, and Pompey. He was, even for his times, singularly brutal, respon- sible for the massacres of hundreds of thousands of people in the far corners of the known world, \"one of the most formida- ble opponents Rome ever had.\"' Except for the family problems,' there are interesting paral- lels between the affairs of Mithridates the Great and Vernon Anthony (\"Dick\") Walters, the current United States Ambas- sador to the United Nations. For one thing, Walters is a well known linguist who speaks eight languages and many dialects and \"likes to slip into a country unannounced before a meeting with a head of state so he can ride the buses around and pick up the local slang and intonation.\"More to the point, Walters, like Mithridates, is linked to countless coups, wars, and mas- sacres around the world. But while his role as linguist is widely publicized, his high stature as Grand Master of state terrorism, his decades of ties to wholesale butchery in Iran, Brazil, Guatemala, Chile, Argentina, and most recently, Nicaragua, do not appear in the State Department press releases or the raft 1.

In October 1942 he \"took part in the assault landing at Safi, Morocco.\" (This appears to be the extent of Walters's combat experience.) He then taught \"Prisoner of War Interrogation\" at Camp Richie. Although not mentioned in his official biography, Walters later trained Brazilian troops at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where lie be- came close friends with a young officer, Humberto ('astelo Branco, who, more than 20 years later, was to take power in the coup which overthrew President Joao Goulart and installed a long-lasting regime infamous for its brutality and torture of leftists, especially students and unionists.' Walters was aide de camp to General Mark W. Clark in Italy and then, until the end of the War, combat liaison officer with the 1st Brazilian Infan- try Division in Italy (living on the same floor with his friend Castelo Branco).' All the abovementioned countries are ones with which Walters was later to have significant tics. Walters spent more than 25 years in it succession of military assignments, usually as military attache or interpreter, and generally under the aegis of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was in Brazil in 1945 with Secretary of State Marshall and President Truman, and attended the 1947 Pan American ('on- ference in Bogota, Colombia. This was his first brush with rev- olution and counterrevolution; the massive protests against the 5. The major media are extraordinarily kind to Dick Walters. See. for exam plc, \"An Fnvoy Who Specializes in Sensitive Missions.\" it profile in tae Net, York Tinte,%, June 3, 1982, in which he is quoted as responding to his critics. \"If I was it had man, I couldn't keep doing this.'' And. ''Reagan Nominates Walters To Be Ambassador to U.N.,'' in the Washington /'o.et, February 9, 1985, which highlights the \"stern warning\" he gave Roberto D'Auhuisson not to assassinate the U.S. Ambassador. Yet the Times piece notes that ''his she emphasis of the human rights issue\" has on praise from conservatives, and the Post points out that \"his strong anticommunist views . . have made hint it favorite of conservative Republican administrations.'' Walters refers to the 1953 coup in Iran, the 1954 coup in Guatemala, the 1964 coup in Bevil. and the 1973 coup in Chile as \"revolutions.'' His perspicacity is tempered by his knee-jerk rightwing sentiments. In March 1986 he was quoted: ''I mean, how do we really know that Marcos is this unpopular'.'

Curiously, Walters received a medal for his service during this incident, leading to speculation about his role in the events. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Walters was all over the globe, most significantly, as we will see below, in Iran, Italy, Brazil, France, and Vietnam (only one month, in 1967, from which, presumably, he derived the experience to write his \"Sunset at Saigon\"). He spent three years in secret negotia- tions with the Chinese, and, in the words of his official biog- raphy, \"smuggled Henry Kissinger into Paris on 15 different occasions to conduct such negotiations.\" His military promotions were unprecedented, considering his beginnings as a private. His Brazilian escapades in 1964 earned the Colonel a promotion to Brigadier General; his one month in Vietnam three years later got him his second star, as Major General; and when, in April 1972, he was appointed Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, he became a Lieuten- ant General. He retired in July 1976 and spent the Carter years in an action-packed civilian career. Then, shortly after Presi- dent Reagan entered office, Walters returned through the re- volving door and began four years' State Department service as Ambassador-at-Large, before becoming U.N. Ambassador. Prior to examining his post-military career, it is enlightening to review Walters's far-flung operations in the coup-filled years from 1953 to 1973. Early Dirty Work Walters admits, and associates confirm, that he was in- volved in the 1953 putsch which overthrew the government of Premier Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran and reinstalled the young Shah.'? In the early 1960s he was military attache in Rome, actively blocking the Kennedy administration's \"open- ing\" towards the Italian left.\" Presumably Walters was in- 9 Ramon Jimeno and Marcela Caldas, \"Vernon Anthony Walters: El Agente Secreto de la Diplomacia Silenciosa,\" in Zona (Bogota, Colombia), April 23, 1986, p. 46. 10.

Ibid. volved in the massive CIA campaign to fund lavishly the Christian Democratic Party in its otherwise risky electoral bat- tles against the Communist Party of Italy. While it is not known whether Walters knew CIA veteran Hugh Montgom- ery\" in the 1960s, at present he and Walters do work together; Montgomery is Alternate Representative for Special Political Affairs in the United States delegation to the United Nations, with the rank of Ambassador, according to the current U.N. diplomatic list. Brazil In 1962 Walters was posted to Brazil as military attache. Al- though Walters insists he was nothing more than a \"well-in- formed observer\" of the events that followed,\" it is obvious that he was up to his neck in the plotting which culminated in the bloody coup of 1964. He was, according to Jan Knippers Black, the \"linchpin, the one person all the officers would talk to while they were still afraid to talk with one another.\"\" In- deed, he was such a good \"observer\" that he told Washington one week in advance the exact day the coup was to take place.\" Moreover, he breakfasted with Castelo Branco the morning after the coup began, urging him to assume the presidency, and he lunched with him the day after the inauguration.\" Walters never acknowledged Castelo Branco's consummate vicious- ness nor conceded the enormity of his regime's acts. In his au- tobiography he wrote: \"I never saw Castelo Branco do a mean thing or heard him say a shameful word. The moral integrity of the man was beyond challenge.\"\" And as to the installation of the brutal Brazilian military dictatorship, he wrote: \"A regime basically unfriendly to the United States had been replaced by another one much more friendly. Some may regard this as bad. I do not. I am convinced that if the revolution [sic] had not oc- curred, Brazil would have gone the way of Cuba.\"\" In fact, various government documents suggest that Walters played an extremely crucial role both in fomenting and in accomplishing the coup. In the year preceding the March 31, 1964 start of the coup, a series of CIA documents-some still classified, some partially released, and some fully declas- sified--describe a meticulous investigation into the attitude of the Brazilian military regarding the Goulart government. One, written in May 1963, notes that \"Military becoming more anti- Goulart.\"19 Another, in July, worries about \"Military's hesi- tance to overthrow constitutional regime. \"'? Shortly thereafter, another document describes the \"possibility of a rightist coup. \"\" During this period, the person best situated to sway the hesitant rightist military leaders was Colonel Vernon Wal- 12.

They detail a U.S. plan called \"Brother Sam,\" which not only describes foreknowledge of the coup, but also notes the proba- bility of Castelo Branco's assuming its leadership, and indi- cates that if the coup appeared to be failing, the U.S. Navy was to intervene. These are the same documents which describe Walters's breakfast with his old friend, Castelo Branco.' Officially With the CIA Walter's friendship with Nixon, solidified in 1958 when he protected the then Vice President from the spitting, rock- throwing crowds in Venezuela, led to his appointment, in April 1972, as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, a post he filled under four Directors, Richard Helms, James Schlesinger, William Colby, and George Bush. John Dean testified during the Watergate trials that he had been told Walters \"was a good friend of the White House and the White House had put him in the Deputy Director position so they could have some influ- ence over the Agency. \"2' He served from 1972 to 1976, a sem- inal period in CIA history, which ran from Watergate through the overthrow of Allende in Chile to the Church Committee hearings, the intervention in Angola, and the planning of the assassination of Orlando Letelier. Vernon Walters played im- portant roles throughout this period. The Great Watergate Myth Part of the Walters mythology is his allegedly firm, moral, and indignant refusal to be a part of any cover-up of what came to be known as the Watergate scandal. Indeed, his autobiog- raphy paints a picture of incorruptible valor: \"I looked [John Dean] right in the eye and said, 'Fire everyone connected with this.' \"\" The fact is that when Walters was first asked, by Nixon aide Bob Haldeman, to warn the FBI (falsely) that a strenuous investigation of Watergate would jeopardize ongoing CIA operations, he did just that. Within minutes of receiving those orders, he was on his way to FBI Director Patrick Gray.\" Several days later Walters was still stonewalling, advising John Dean that the then Director, Richard Helms, wanted to distance himself and the Agency from the growing scandal. They did not want to expose the administration's deep involve- ment; they just wanted to keep the Agency out of any further involvement. In fact, for all his posturing, Walters never re- tracted the phony warning he had delivered to Gray.' He con- nived with Dean on possible scenarios to use. Two weeks after his first, eager involvement, Walters realized he could not stall the investigation much further. When Gray, also anxious to protect himself, asked Walters if he could put the CIA's request in writing, Walters said he could not write such a \"spurious\" letter. The relieved Gray then understood that he could let the investigation, already with a momentum of its own, go on; Walters did not want to he in the position of wittingly covering up crimes, especially as so many people would know about it. Still, it was almost a rear later that he first informed the Department of Justice of his knowledge of the White House's efforts to have the CIA stop the FBI, and during that year he received the Agency's Distin- guished Intelligence Medal, for doing such a good job of keep- ing the CIA out of the Watergate morass.=\" Yet, as Jeff Stein has pointed out, \"Walters's recounting of the affair leads one to believe he was naive and misled. 'I had been in Washington for six weeks at this point and it simply did not occur to me that the Chief of Staff to the President might he asking me to do something that was illegal or wrong.' But at this point in his career, Walters had been engaged in various intelligence operations for more than thirty years.\"\"' Indeed, his year of silence speaks more eloquently than his diffident autobiography. Chile, Allende, and Letelier One of the most controversial series of charges against Wal- ters involve his connections with the fascist opposition to the administration of Chilean President Salvador Allende, to the overthrow of Allende, and to the assassination of former Chi- lean Defense Minister Orlando Letelier. While DDCI, Walters was in charge of the close liaison be- tween the CIA and the Chilean intelligence services, which cooperated closely in the efforts to overthrow the Allende gov- ernment. They also reportedly received considerable help from Walters's friends in the Brazilian service. \" But the most controversial allegation against Walters is that he was complicit in the assassination of Letelicr.\" In July 1976 the police in Paraguay had in jail an alleged CIA informant, it possible cause of considerable embarrassment to the U.S. At the same time, Conrado Pappalardo, the assistant to Paraguayan President Alfredo Stroessner, was pressuring the U.S. Ambassador, George Landau, to comply with a request made by Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Stroessner. Pinochet wanted two Chilean agents to travel to the U.S. on false Paraguayan passports, which Stroessncr had approved, but they now needed U.S. entry visas, and the two agents were in Paraguay waiting for the visas. When Ambassador Landau expressed concern and remarked that the request was rather un- usual, he was told by Pappalardo not to worry, that DDCI Ver- non Walters knew all about it and that the two men were to re- port to Walters when they arrived in the U.S. Landau was unable to reach Walters, who was on leave in Florida at the time, and after considerable soul-searching, he issued the visas. But he took some precautions, photocopying the passports before returning them, and sending a detailed 22. Massing, op. cit., n. 7, p. 22.

Landau as- sumed that the issuance of the visas related to some CIA- Paraguay deal to free the imprisoned agent. However, on Au- gust 4, Landau received a cable from Walters indicating that he knew nothing of the matter, that he had no plans to meet with the Chileans, and suggesting that Landau confer further with the State Department. Landau notified the Paraguayans that the visas were to be considered revoked and demanded the passports back. Shortly thereafter, Walters did travel to Paraguay, ostensibly on a mission involved solely with the captured agent. Despite repeated requests Landau did not get the passports back until October 29, and they were returned with the photo- graphs of the bearers removed. But Landau had photocopied the passports; later he was to learn that one of the two \"Chi- leans\" was Michael Vernon Townley, one of the men who planted the bomb which, on September 21, 1976--when he was awaiting the return of the passports-killed Letelier. It is almost impossible to believe, from all of the studies which have been published, and from the testimony of several trials and congressional hearings, that Vernon Walters did not have advance knowledge of a major Chilean secret police oper- ation in the U.S. being planned in July and August of 1976, but no directly incriminating evidence has been found. Walters vigorously denies any connection with, or foreknowledge of, the Letelier assassination, although he has admitted to many meetings with Colonel Contreras in his years as DDCI.;2 Walters's \"Private Life,\" 1976-1981 Whatever his reasons for leaving the Ford administration well before the elections, Walters spent the Carter years close to the friends he had made over the past three decades. And playing upon those friendships proved no fiscal hardship. In 1980, for example, Walters made nearly half a million dollars, $300,000 of which was a fee from what may be one of the most misleadingly named companies in the United States, Environ- mental Energy Systems, Inc., of Alexandria, Virginia, which is, curiously, a major arms merchant. The money was a con- sultant's fee for assisting them in their efforts (apparently un- successful) to sell tanks to the King of Morocco. As the com- pany president told the New York Times, \"We went to him be- cause he had the connections, he knew the King of Morocco. \"33 In fact Walters has used his relationship with King Hassan through the years, ever since 1942, when he gave the then 13-year-old Crown Prince a ride in his Army tank. Walters's work with Morocco during this time period has even more ominous overtones. He was (and possibly still is) a general partner in a Vienna, Virginia organization called Morocco Travel Advisers. In a letter to the Senate submitted with his April 1, 1981 Disclosure Statement he said the com- pany \"provides tours of Morocco for and at the expense of U.S. travel agents.\" But he also noted that it was involved in \"the development of tourism in the far south of Morocco and 32.

Michael Massing (op. cit. n. 7, p. 23) says that Walters acknowl- edged two meetings with Contreras, but his letter denies discussing Letelier \"in any of the meetings with Colonel Contreras,\" language which suggests rather a greater number of encounters. 33.

Both portions, however, comprise the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, whose people, led by Polisario, have been struggling for their independence for many years. Moreover, it was Walters, as DDCI, who convinced the Spanish to relinquish its colony to Morocco and Mauritania in the first place.\" If \"Environmental Energy\" means military equipment, we can only surmise what \"Travel Advisers\" means. It would ap- pear to be aimed directly at Polisario and the Sahrawi people. Walters's Ties to Guatemala Vernon Walters was perhaps President Reagan's most prom- inent apologist for the brutal military dictatorship of General Romeo Lucas Garcia of Guatemala. He visited Lucas Garcia three times; in a May 1981 press conference in Guatemala City, Walters said the U.S. wanted to help Lucas Garcia de- fend \"peace and liberty.\"\" When asked about Guatemalan human rights violations, Walters said, \"There will be human rights problems in the year 3000 with the governments of Mars and the moon. There are some problems that are never re- solved.\"\" A month later, U.S. aid for Guatemala resumed at a significant level. Walters had ties to Guatemala and its murderous leaders from his \"civilian\" interlude in the late 1970s. One of the clients he listed in his Senate disclosure statement was Basic Research International, S.A., \"an international oil cartel scouting the fields of Guatemala.\" They paid him $1000 a day as a \"consultant,\" to try to influence the Guatemalan govern- ment to lift oil production quotas. It has been charged that in this project, Basic Research issued exaggerated estimates of Guatemalan oil reserves which the State Department then used to justify continued U.S. support for the brutal regime. In fact, it has been reported that he continued to represent this com- pany unofficially even while in Guatemala officially, during the May 1981 trip noted above.\" Walters continues to flack for Guatemala. In 1985 he told an interviewer that the administration's \"quiet diplomacy\" really worked; the Guatemalan military is \"not killing as many people as they did before.\"3\" This faint praise was not even true; virtually all reports indicated that the Guatemalan govern- ment at the time continued to have the worst human rights re- cord in the area. Joining the Reagan Administration Walters was appointed a senior adviser to then Secretary of 34. According to Jeff Gerth's congressional sources, \"One of Mr. Walters's last missions in the CIA was a trip in late 1975 to Spain, where in meetings with King Hassan 11 of Morocco and Spanish officials he convinced Spain to give up control of Western Sahara, a Spanish colony in Africa long sought by Morocco.\" New York Times, December 6, 1981 . 35.

On July 22, 1981, after Senate confirma- tion, he was sworn in as Ambassador-at-Large. Among his ear- liest duties was a deep involvement in the administration's war against Nicaragua. In 1981 and 1982 he made numerous trips to Argentina to arrange for that government's training of con- tras and for their handling of various secret payments to contra leaders, particularly prior to the final approval of the CIA's original plans. Ironically, the Argentine regime was not well repaid for its clandestine help to Walters in supporting Reagan's Nicaragua policies. The New York Times was unusually frank: \"In dozens of recent world missions, Mr. Walters has hurried six times to Argentina alone, most recently taking on the thankless task of telling his friends in the junta that, with war beginning in the Falklands, Washington had to side with Britain.\"Walters had a special role in the building up of the contra forces waging their brutal war against Nicaragua. According to the testimony of former contra leader Edgar Chamorro,\"' Wal- ters was instrumental in consolidating the forces of the former members of Somoza's National Guard: \"At that time, the ex-National Guardsmen were divided into several small bands operating along the Nicaragua-Honduras border. The largest of the bands, headed by Enrique Ber- mudez, a former Colonel, was called the 15th of September Legion. They were not an effective military force and repre- sented no more than a minor irritant to the Nicaraguan gov- ernment. Prior to the UDN's merger with these people, Gen- eral Walters himself arranged for all the bands to be incorpo- rated within the 15th of September Legion, and for the mili- tary government of Argentina to send several army officers to serve as advisers and trainers . . . the new organization was called the Fuerza Democratica Nicaraguense (National Democratic Force), or by its Spanish acronym, FDN.\" during the CIA's operations in Angola in 1975 and 1976, and had tried to get the Brazilians (unsuccessfully) and then the French (successfully) involved in the operations.42 Walters's presence in Africa is ubiquitous; nearly every year as Ambas- sador-at-Large he made whirlwind tours of numerous African countries. In one instance, Angola was bombed by South Af- rica just after he departed. Walters in for Kirkpatrick In February 1985, Walters was nominated by President Reagan to succeed Jeane Kirkpatrick as United Nations Am- bassador. Although most reportage continued to praise Wal- ters, reiterating all the old war stories, some of the journals were less than flattering. As Claudia Wright noted in the New Statesman, \"Walters's candidacy for the U.N. post carries an unusual cachet: Directly or indirectly, he has been involved in overthrowing more governments than any other official still serving in the U.S. government.\"\" And even U.S. News & World Report pointed out that Secretary of State George Shultz wanted Walters in the job, but without cabinet rank, \"to signal a lowered U.S. appraisal of the worth of the world body.\"\" Indeed, the downplaying of the role of the United Nations is a pillar of Reagan's foreign policy. And Walters is a staunch adherent of the Reagan Doctrine which, in its haughty disdain for international law, would just as soon see the world body destroyed. He has called the U.N. a \"measured disappoint- ment,\" because it has \"drifted away from resolution of con- flicts.\" Walters has promised to be \"very tough,\" to \"work very hard to change these voting patterns [unfavorable to the U.S.].\"\" His professed love for conflict resolution belies the administration's-and Walters's-contempt for the World Court, as evidenced by their refusal to participate in the case brought, successfully, by Nicaragua to challenge the contra war. Colombia and San Andres Island One of Walters's most significant achievements in his per- sonal war against Nicaragua was a secret agreement he negotiated with the then President of Colombia, Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala aimed at setting up a top secret U.S. military base on the Colombian island of San Andres, only 125 miles off the east coast of Nicaragua. Some $50 million worth of sophisticated tracking radar and anti-aircraft batteries have re- portedly been installed on the island and nearby keys.\" Forever Morocco Walters has remained intimately involved with Morocco for more than 40 years. Most recently he seems to have played a considerable role in the rapprochement between Algeria and Morocco, which led to a cooling of Algerian support for Polisario. Walters is said to be close to the number two man in Algeria, Prime Minister Abdelhamid Brahimi, who lived in the U.S. in 1976, and through whom Walters arranged for the first official visit of Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid to Presi- dent Reagan. Another likely Walters operation in Morocco was the use of that country, in 1981, for meetings between high U.S. officials and Angolan traitor Jonas Savimbi. Walters had been DDCI 39.

The Blackmailer Recent press reports note that Walters has been absent from his U.N. post nearly continually the past few months, traveling around the world on more secret missions. As usual, his trips go undocumented while incidents of U.S.-sponsored terrorism continue unabated. If all else fails, Walters is not above simple blackmail. U.S. News & World Report has described how he fended off a po- tentially hostile Senator during the Watergate hearings by dis- creetly threatening to bring up at the hearings the time the Sen- ator had asked Walters, then military attache in Paris, to ship some luxury items illegally through military channels for a group of junketing Senators.46 These are the kinds of moves Mithridates would have approved. ? 42.

U.S. News & World Report, February 18, 1985, p. 10. In fact, the dis- pute over cabinet status, in being leaked to the press, led to the agreement that Walters would have cabinet rank, but was followed by another dispute, whether Walters would automatically serve on the National Security Council. According to the New York Times (March 26, 1985, p. 1), Walters was \"so distressed at not being asked to serve on the council that he submitted his resig- nation this afternoon.\" His petulance was short-lived; the next day it was an- nounced that Walters would accept the U.N. post even though it did not in- clude an automatic seat on the NSC. The President's press secretary did an- nounce, though, that the President had the \"highest regard\" for Walters and valued his counsel. (New York Times, March 27, 1985, p. A3.) 45.

Herman* For the average citizen of the West, the idea of the United States as a sponsor of international terrorism-let alone the dom- inant sponsor'-would appear utterly incomprehensible. After all, one reads daily that the United States is leading the charge against something it calls \"terrorism,\" and it regularly assails its allies for dragging their feet in responding to ter- rorism. On the other hand, the U.S. government has organized a mercenary army to attack Nicaragua, and even provided it with a printed manual of recommended acts of sabotage and murder, which has been implemented by the proxy army, at the cost of well over a thousand Nicaraguan civilian lives. The U.S. government has given unstinting support to the apart- heid government of South Africa, which has invaded, and or- ganized its own mercenary armies, to subvert a string of frontline states, again at the cost of many thousands of civilian lives.' The western media, however, never refer to the United States or South Africa as \"terrorist states,\" even though both of them have killed vastly greater numbers than Qaddafi or the Red Brigades.' The reason for the western misperception is that the power- ful define terrorism, and the western media loyally follow the agenda of their own leaders. The powerful naturally define ter- rorism to exclude their own acts and those of their friends and clients. \"If I don't like it, call it terrorism.\" The current administration in Washington has found it possi- ble arbitrarily to designate any group or country which it op- poses as \"terrorist,\" and this will be transmitted to the public by the mass media without serious criticism or laughter. In his speech before the American Bar Association on July 8, 1985, President Reagan named five states as engaging in serious state terrorism-North Korea, Libya, Iran, Cuba, and Nicaragua. The Soviet Union was presumably omitted because of the up- coming Summit meeting. The media reported that Syria had been spared as \"a gesture of gratitude\" to President Assad for his role in negotiating the release of 39 U.S. hostages in Leba- non!' The press failed to discuss the fact that South Africa and Guatemala (among others) were omitted, that Nicaragua does 1.

See Table I and the text below. 4. Bernard Weinraub, \"President Accuses 5 'Outlaw States' of World Ter- ror,\" New York Times, July 9, 1985, p. 1. * Edward S. Herman is professor of finance at the Wharton School of the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania, and the author of numerous books and articles on U.S. foreign policy. His most recent book, with Frank Brodhead, is \"The Rise and Fall of the Bulgarian Connection\" (New York: Sheridan Square Publica- tions, 1986). Number 26 (Summer 1986) not murder its own citizens as South Africa and Guatemala have done on a large scale, and that Nicaragua has not invaded other countries or organized subversive forces to destabilize other countries, as South Africa has done in many places and as the United States does quite openly to Nicaragua itself. The ludicrousness and hypocrisy of the United States calling Nicaragua a terrorist state was entirely unnoticed and without effect on the objective reporting by the U.S. press. With if compliant mass media, especially in the United States but also among its clients, terror is what the powerful U.S. government declares to be terror. As it is now using the concept with auda- cious and arbitrary abandon, it is employing the \"It 'l don't like it, call it terrorism\" definition of terrorism. Exclusion of State Terrorism: Retail Versus Wholesale Terror In its semantic manipulation of terrorism and related words, a number of devices are used by the United States and its intel- lectual spokespersons to differentiate friends and self from \"terrorists.\" Perhaps the most important is to confine the use of the word to non-state actors and actions: i.e., to define ter- rorism as the use of violence to oppose governments.` This de- parts from standard and traditional usage, according to which terrorism is a mode of governing as well as of opposing govern- ments by means of intimidation.\" By excluding governments, South Africa, Guatemala, and Israel are removed from the category of terrorist, while the Af- rican National Congress (ANC), rebel groups in Guatemala, and the PLO are automatically eligible. This is grotesque in terms of both numbers of victims and forms of violence em- ployed by state and non-state intimidators,' but it is extremely convenient in terms of western priorities and interests. The governments protected by this word usage are allies, clients, and self; the groups automatically made \"terrorists\" oppose 5. How President Reagan nevertheless refers to Nicaragua and other enemy states as \"terrorist\" will be discussed below under '' International terrorism' and its supporters.\" 6. The fifth edition of Webster's Collegiate Dictionar.r, for example, de- fines terrorism as \"a mode of governing, or of opposing government, by in- timidation.\" The American Heritage Dictionarc defines it as \"The use of ter- ror, violence and intimidation to achieve an end.\" This does not exclude gov- ernments, and the third accepted usage given is explicitly \"A system of gov- ernment that uses terror to rule.\" In the past, terrorism was assumed to refer primarily to acts of government. According to a U.N. study of terrorism, \"While at first it applied mainly to those acts and policies of Government which were designed to spread terror among a population for the purpose of ensuring its submission to and contx- mity with the will of those Governments, it now seems to he mainly applied to actions by individuals, or groups of individuals... ..The Origins and Funda- mental Causes of International Terrorism,\" in M. Cherif Bassiouni, ed., Intel- national Terrorism and Political Crime., (Springfield. 111.: Charles Thomas, 1975), p. 5. The identification of terrorism with government receded with the rise of organized western state terror and modern public relations. 7. State terrorists use torture on a large scale: dissident groups rarely engage in this form of terror. See \"U.S. Sponsorship of International Terrorism.\" in this issue. Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170003-6 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100170003-6 these clients and western defense of the status quo.\" To focus more sharply on the absurdity of this definitional system, I use the concepts of \"retail\" and \"wholesale\" terror: Dissident individuals and groups kill on a retail basis (that is, on a small scale, with limited technological resources to kill, and with small numbers of victims); states kill wholesale. This fairly obvious but neglected point is displayed dramatically on Table 1, which compares the numbers killed by state and non- state terrorists in recent decades. It can be quickly observed that single incidents of state terrorism frequently involve many more killings than multi-year totals for non-state terrorists (not to speak of the vastly greater numbers allocable to state ter- rorists on a multi-year basis). In fact, one can see from this table that the multi-year aggregates for the Baader-Meinhof gang (a part of row 1), the Red Brigades (only a part of the re- latively small Italian total on row 2),' and the PLO (row 3)- the bogeymen of the western media-even when taken to- gether fall short of the totals for single episodes of violence by South Africa, El Salvador, and Israel. The table suggests that if we were to allow state (wholesale) terror to be included in our definition of terror and give it attention remotely proportional to numbers, El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Israel and the United States itself would be pushed to center stage,'? the Red Brigades and PLO would recede to the background. But this would not conform to the demands of western power. Terrorism Versus \"Retaliation\" A second important device allowing \"terrorist\" to be ap- plied only to the enemy is distinguishing between terrorism and \"retaliation,\" and simply asserting that we and our friends only \"retaliate\" to somebody else's \"terrorism.\" In a se- quence of violence, it is often very difficult to determine where the process began, and thus the distinction between terror and retaliation is often arbitrary and depends on the ability of one side to establish its claim by sheer power. Thus, when Israel bombed Tunis, killing 20 Tunisian bystanders as well as many more Palestinians, the Reagan administration and the West ac- cepted this as \"retaliation,\" even though the action at Larnaca that allegedly elicited the Tunis attack was explicitly stated by its perpetrators to have been a retaliatory act against Mossad agents involved in Israeli hijackings of ships. A note found on the body of one of the Rome terrorists speaks of vengeance for the Israeli-sponsored massacres of Palestinians at Shatila and Shaba, but this was not taken seriously in the West as making the Rome attacks merely \"retaliation\" for a prior terrorism.\" As Israel is a client state of the United States, the West allows Israel to kill always in \"retaliation,\" never as terrorism, whereas the 8. This usage is completely institutionalized in western discussions of ter- rorism. This is reflected, for example, in so-called \"risk-assessment\" analyses by professionals in that new field. Thus the U.S. consulting firm Risks Intema- tional, Inc., confines terrorism entirely to dissident violence and excludes state murders by, say, Pinochet's government in Chile, by definition. In fact, in a recent assessment, it finds that the leading victim of terrorism in 1984 was the state of Chile! Executive Risk Assessment, December 1985, p. 30. 9. The total number killed by the Red Brigades between 1969 and 1982 has been estimated by D. Della Porta at 90, which is about the same number as were killed in the single rightwing massacre at the Bologna railway station. Cifre Crudeli (Bologna: 11 Mulino [Istituto Cattaneo], 1984), Table 14, p. 61. 10. As Pol Pot was in his heyday of power, and as the Soviets have been in their attacks on Afghanistan since 1979. 1 I . The Tunis attack was of course directed at a PLO official residence. We may ask, however, whether if, immediately following the Beirut massacres of Palestinians, the PLO had successfully attacked the building of the Israeli Par- liament, killing dozens of Israeli officials, this would have been considered legitimate targeting and \"retaliation.\" And if not, why not'' PLO and other Palestinian groups are never allowed to be retaliating; they only engage in terrorism.'2 Terrorists as Indiscriminate Killers Terrorists are also sometimes distinguished from non-ter- rorist perpetrators of violence by an alleged randomness or in- discriminateness in their attacks. This is presumably less moral than non-random killing, and the claim is used to lend an aura of evil to terrorists and benignness to the other (frequently state) killers. Well-targeted killing, however, is not evidently more decent than random killing, unless the targeted victims are thought to be deserving of their fate. If redheads, or school teachers were targeted, would this be morally superior to ran- dom killing? If, however, the targeted victims are alleged to be Communists or PLO officials, in the West this may give the re- quisite moral aura. Frequently, of course, the targeted victims are not the only casualties, as in Tunis, but the claim of having gone after a \"legitimate\" target helps justify the casualties that are allegedly unintended. As a question of fact, however, non-state terrorists such as the Baader-Meinhof gang and PLO, or SWAPO in Namibia, or the NLF in Vietnam, have not been more prone to indiscrimi- nate killing than state terrorists. Most non-state dissident acts of violence are carefully targeted at some symbol of abuse, and in the case of the NLF in South Vietnam, non-selective vio- lence was punishable as alienating the popular base sought by NLF strategy. Where dissidents take hostages, of course, the victims are often random, but neither the number of such cases nor the ensuing casualties have been large (the deaths have been a small part of the small retail totals on Table 1).\" On the other hand, state terror also presents a mixed picture of targeted and indiscriminate killing. State terrorists in Latin America have deliberately sought out political activists and leaders and cadres of organized groups, but where the targeted groups are large and diverse, and the term \"cadres\" is defined broadly (e.g., active union members), the policies are reasona- bly described as indiscriminate. Furthermore, state terror is often very \"generous\" in attacking civilians at large where these are seen as a virtual enemy population. McClintock points out that \"in the case of a mass-based insurgency, sec- onded by the vast majority of the population, the perception of the `innocent civilian' becomes obscured.\" He contends that in Guatemala and El Salvador in the mid-1980s, and in the last years of Somoza, the tactics of state terror \"have taken on an almost random, mass-oriented form.\"'? The point applies to the U.S. assault on Indochina. The essence of U.S. policy in Indochina was the massive use of firepower in the countryside, based on minimal targeting information. Civilian deaths were seen as having the merits of reducing an enemy population, forcing an exodus into the cities, arousing intense fear, and oc- casionally even killing an enemy soldier. In the U.S. mass 12. What makes this system of words especially inappropriate is that Israel has gone to great pains to designate the PLO as \"terrorist\" in order not to have to deal with the Palestinians, except as a group to marginalize and exterminate. For a discussion of the fact that the Israeli government invaded Lebanon in 1982 to avoid the threat of political negotiations, claiming, of course, that they were cleaning out nests of \"terrorists,\" see Noam Chomsky, \"Libya in U.S. Demonology\" in this issue. The U.S. media swallowed entirely the Israeli claim to be \"retaliating\" to \"terrorism.\" 13. A significant proportion of hostages who have been killed have been victims of state efforts to recover the hostages by force. Those so killed are usually attributed to the dissident terrorists. 14.

This was partly true, in that the villages at- tacked did house a population supportive of the indigenous re- bels. Clearly, however, bombing addressed to an entire rural population is reasonably described as indiscriminate. This is reflected in the staggering casualty rates that were imposed on the defenseless peasant populations (see Table I, row 22). These policies have been brought to El Salvador where the United States is now carrying out, mainly but not entirely by a proxy army and airforce, a Vietnam-style anti-peoples war in the countryside.' Casualty levels are huge, but the western media have turned their attention to \"terrorism.\" The same Salvadoran victim of U.S. napalm and white phosphorus bombs. points apply to Israeli bombing raids during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and those currently being carried out against Shi'ite villages in Southern Lebanon, with heavy firepower di- rected at heavily populated civilian areas and therefore involv- ing essentially random killing. Again, the West is not aroused and does not talk about going to the \"source\" of these killings; they are not \"terrorism.\" Terrorists as Manipulators of the Media Another basis on which western terrorism experts attempt to confine attention to individual and small group actions rather than the more massive state violence is by focusing on the al- leged manipulation of the media by terrorists.

Some retail terrorist activities are designed to attract attention to grievances, and the terrorists count on the media giving publicity to their hijackings and tak- ing of hostages. State terrorists, by contrast, do not rely on the media in their own processes of intimidation, because their ca- pacity for violence is sufficiently great to have the desired ef- fects without deliberate enlistment of publicity. In fact, the problem for state terrorists is keeping the media quiet, so that violence can be carried out without undue public reaction. As dissident terrorists seek publicity, while state terrorists shun it as interfering with their freedom to kill, it is obvious that a focus on the \"theatre of terror\" automatically serves an apologetic function. It also allows conservatives to berate the media for \"encouraging terrorism\" by giving the terrorists a great deal of publicity. This involves a double deception. One is the implication that the media treat dissident terrorists sym- pathetically. While the media occasionally do convey some of the grievances of the terrorists and allow them to appear in a human light, media coverage of terrorist events is still heavily dominated by official views and by a focus on the fate of the victims. In the aftermath of the actions these emphases and re- crimination against the terrorists are overwhelming. The second deception is more serious. The analysts of \"ter- ror theatre\" fail to see the important role that publicity about dissident terror plays in sanctioning state terrorism. It was not a coincidence that the great increase in western attention to \"ter- rorism\" has accompanied the Reagan arms buildup, placement of missiles in Western Europe, and more aggressive attacks by the United States and its surrogates against Nicaraguans, Lebanese, Angolans, and Salvadoran rebels. Reagan's explict shift in emphasis from \"human rights\" to \"terrorism\" was virtual acknowledgement of support for state terrorists and simultaneous diversion of attention to lesser terrorists.\" The great attention now given to the theatre of terror doesn't help the retail terrorists;\" it strengthens the claims of those who only \"retaliate\" to the terror of others. The Reagan adminis- tration's manipulation of the Libyan threat, from the mythical \"hit squads\" of 1981 to the deliberately provoked encounters off the Libyan coast and recent direct attacks, have been desig- ned to shift attention from the assault on Central America, the Palestinians and assorted other Arab groups, and the frontline Israeli tanks abandon ruins after destroying Shi'ite village of Ma'arakeh. 17. Another Orwellism may be noted here: State terrorists don't engage in terrorism, they violate \"human rights''; only retail terrorists \"terrorize.\" 18. For example, the PLO's status has been greatly reduced in the 1980s. because while massive Israeli attacks on its infrastructure has aroused no seri- ous western recriminations at Israeli terrorism, as each PLO attack is \"ter- rorism\" it suffers a steady accumulation of moral deficits.

The \"theatre of terror\" is man- aged from Washington to serve its perceived interests. My Terror as \"Counter-terror\" Another frequently encountered concept in western ter- rorism semantics is \"counter-terrorism.\" As the United States and its clients, like South Africa, El Salvador, and Guatemala, do not (by definition) engage in terrorism, their attacks on their enemies require alternative words. One, as we have seen, is re- taliation. But retaliation implies a response to an immediately preceding act. We need a word that allows a more continuous assault on the bases and populations of \"terrorists.\" The gap has been filled by the concept of \"counter-terror.\" For us and our allies, immediate violent responses are retaliation; longer term attacks are counter-terror. Thus, South Africa's systema- tic assaults on its neighbors to induce them to refuse sanctuary to the ANC and SWAPO-''terrorists\" in western semantics and political language\"are counter-terrorism. Similarly, the massacres of peasants carried out by the Guatemalan state to root out any opposition (i.e., \"terrorists\") is counter-terror.\" In short, what in western terrorism semantics is called ''counter terror\" is in reality a dressed up form of state (wholesale) terror. \"International Terrorism\" and its Supporters A final semantic adjustment is needed so that the western es- tablishment can tar certain disfavored states with the terrorist brush. This is done with the aid of the concept of an \"interna- tional terrorist,\" who either kills across national borders or kills with the support of a foreign power. In western terrorism semantics, a state whose agents cross a border to kill is not en- gaging in \"international terrorism,\" nor is aiding a state that employs systematic violence supporting international ter- rorism. Thus, if the United States aids Pinochet and Botha, this is not supporting international terrorism. On the other hand, aid to the ANC, or any other group opposing government is au- tomatically aid to international terrorists. This is enormously helpful to Botha, Pinochet, and Reagan. On this system of def- initions, also, aid by Nicaragua to the rebels of El Salvador makes the rebels international terrorists and the Nicaraguan government a \"terrorist state.\" Attacks on both are \"counter- terrorism.\" On the other hand, U.S. aid to the Sal vadoran gov- ernment is exempt from any such labeling, even though it was massive killing by the U.S.-sponsored regimes in El Salvador that literally forced a guerrilla movement into existence in the early 1980s.' As the West is generally trying to bolster up existing regimes against threats from below, a definitional sys- tem that renders all rebels and liberation movements terrorists by virtue of receiving aid, while not doing the same for aid to a government they are trying to unseat, is extremely convenient. A problem arises, of course, where the West itself supports 19. In an interview with the Johannesburg Financial Mail, November 18, 1983, Charles Lichenstein, the Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., stated that \" destahilization will remain in force until Angola and Mo:,ambique do not permit their territory to he used by terrorists [sic] to attack South Africa.\" 20. In 1985 the Reagan administration requested $5 million for the Guatemalan police and security assistance as part of what it called a \"counter- terrorism\" package. 21.

If the United States organizes and supports the contras, and South Africa (and the United States) do the same for Savimhi in An- gola, strict adherence to the West's own skewed definitions makes the United States and South Africa \"terrorist states.\" How is this handled'? The answer is, once again, power defines terrorism: what we and our allies do cannot he terrorism, so that any incompatible definitions-even our own must he temporarily abandoned and special exceptions made. The system of terrorism semantics To summarize the western definitional system and its conse- quences: If the Soviet Union gives aid to the PLO, it is Support- ing terrorism and is a terrorist state, because the PLO uses force to oppose Israel. That intimidation is terrorism. It the United States gives aid to Israel, which invades Lebanon, im- poses collective punishment on West Bank Arabs, and homhs Tunis and assorted other PLO \"havens,\" this is not supporting terrorism because Israel only \"retaliates\" or engages in ''counter-terrorism,\" as does the United States. If the United States aids the Salvadoran government as it slaughters several thousand civilians a year, this is not support of terrorism be- cause a state killing and torturing its own citizens is excluded from the western definition. Also, if some of the people being slaughtered are rebelling, they are \"terrorists\" and the allied government is slaughtering as ''counter-terrorism\" (as in Guatemala). If the United States organizes and aids the ron- tras, and supports South Africa as the latter invades its neigh- bors and organizes subversive armies across its borders, this is not terrorism either because the victims are aiding \"terrorists\" (and we and our allies are again \"countering'' terror), or by a special exemption to the especially virtuous who also happens to own the most guns and the biggest cash balance. ?

By Philip Paull* Whether the media identify the same individual as a \"soldier of fortune,\" \"international killer,\" '\"dangerous' murder sus- pect,\" or \"terrorist\" often depends on what government di- rected or paid for the killing. A recent aborted attempt by Ber- keley police to arrest a man wanted for murder, for example, was depicted by two Bay Area journalists, Michael Taylor of the San Francisco Chronicle and Vince Bielski of the Daily Californian as a straight local news story rather than one with far-reaching political dimensions, mainly, I assert, because the wanted killer had worked for the State of Israel, a Cold War ally of the United States. Had the wanted man been an agent of the Libyan government, the story would have made front page news in the New York Times. Bielski's June 6 Californian arti- cle was headlined \"Cop bungles arrest of international killer; David Lee Williams, Israeli-American terrorist. Man escapes after shown own photo,\" and describes the al- leged murderer matter-of-factly as \"an assassin who has oper- ated in the Middle East.\" Michael Taylor's June 5 Chronicle story, \"'Dangerous' Murder Suspect Evades Manhunt in Berkeley,\" provides more details about the suspect: To wit, David Lee Williams, also known by his Israeli nom de guerre David Abrams, wanted by the FBI for a brutal double murder, has numerous handguns and automatic weapons and worked as house manager of Chabad House, a residence hall for Jewish students near the Uni- versity of California. He has been the target of an FBI manhunt since last February.

The suspect \"popped up\" in Is- rael in the early 1970s, and served in the Israeli Defense Force for one year. \"In 1973, he became an officer in the national police force and served on the border patrol in occupied ter- ritories.\" He worked in the Jerusalem police force, and in 1983, presumably in reward for a decade of unspecified ser- vices rendered to the State of Israel, was granted Israeli citizen- ship (which also required conversion to Judaism). During this same period, according to unnamed FBI, U.S. Navy, and Israeli intelligence sources cited by Taylor, and from statements made by Williams to friends, he was also an \"assassin in the Middle East,\" a \"mercenary\" (for the Is- raelis, presumably), and a \"gunrunner\" with \"volatile\" moods. The real story involves more than just a \"bungled arrest,\" obviously. For a decade or more Williams served the Israeli defense and security services. Yet none of the news reporters sought to uncover what role, if any, the U.S. government played in this arrangement. Were U.S. intelligence agencies- always in close contact with Israeli intelligence-aware of this use of a U.S. national'? Neither story uncovered or even questioned the possible duties Williams/Abrams performed as a member of the Israeli armed forces and the Israeli national police, particularly duties performed in the Israeli-occupied territories. What were the duties that required the use of an American mercenary when Is- rael possesses the most highly trained military/intelligence per- sonnel in the world? Is it possible the Israeli government is en- gaged in activities they wish to keep secret from its own citizenry? Is this an isolated case or part of a pattern'? Whom did Williams actually assassinate \"in the Middle East,\" and who directed and financed the assassinations'? How and where was Williams involved in gunrunning'? The local media coverage also missed the indirect but nevertheless significant connection between the Williams/Ab- rams case and the ongoing Pollard spy case. The Israelis have been saying that the 'c'ollard case represents an isolated rogue espionage caper and that no other Americans have been em- ployed by the Israeli security and intelligence services as spies for Israel. But what about employing Americans for Israeli- sponsored covert action \"dirty tricks\" operations involving as- sassinations and gunrunning? In the Pollard spy case, the Israelis created a new identity for Pollard which he would assume, together with a Swiss bank account and pension after a planned decade of service to the State of Israel. This scheme included the granting of an Israeli passport and Israeli citizenship. In the Williams case the same employment pattern is followed, casting doubt on Israeli de- nials that the Pollard case is unique.

It captures with some accuracy the current rela- tions between the United States and Libya, a minor actor on the stage of international terrorism. More generally, St. Augustine's tale reaches to the heart of the cynical frenzy over \"international terrorism\" currently being orchestrated as a cover for western violence, and illumi- nates the meaning of the concept in contemporary western usage. The term \"terrorism\" came into use at the end of the * Noam Chomsky is professor of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of numerous works on political theory and current events.

That concept, plainly, is of little benefit to the practitioners of state terrorism, who, holding power, are in a position to control the system of thought and expression. The original sense has therefore been abandoned, and the term \"terrorism\" has come to he applied mainly to \"retail terrorism\" by individuals or groups.' Whereas the term was once applied to Emperors who molest their own subjects and the world, now it is restricted to thieves who molest the powerful. Extricating ourselves from the system of indoctrination, we will use the term \"terrorism\" to refer to the threat or use of violence to intimidate or coerce (generally for political ends), whether it is the wholesale terrorism of the Emperor or the re- tail terrorism of the thief. 1. \"Origins and Fundamental Causes of International Terrorism,\" UU.N.

In the course of the hysteria orchestrated to serve other ends, all sorts of charges have been made, but the record confirms the April 1986 statement of a senior U.S. intelligence official that \"what happened a few weeks ago is that Khadafy, who previously had used his people primarily to assassinate Libyan dissidents, made a clear decision to target Americans.\"' Qaddafi's alleged decision followed the Gulf of Sidra incident, when a U.S. air and naval armada sank Libyan vessels with many killed, and is entirely legitimate, indeed much belated, under the cynical doctrines professed by the United States executive, as we shall see directly. Amnesty International reports that Libya's terrorist killings began in early 1980, at the time when Jimmy Carter launched the terrorist war in El Salvador with Jose Napoleon Duarte serving as a cover to ensure that arms would flow to the killers. While Libya was killing 14 of its own citizens, along with a handful of others, the U.S. client regime of El Salvador killed some 50,000 of its citizens in the course of what Bishop Rivera y Damas, who succeeded the assassinated Archbishop Rom- ero, described in October 1980 as \"a war of extermination and genocide against a defenseless civilian population.\" The secu- rity forces who perform these necessary chores were hailed by Duarte, a few weeks later, for their \"valiant service alongside the people against subversion\" while he conceded that \"the masses were with the guerrillas\" when this exercise began under the Carter-Duarte alliance. Duarte expressed this praise for the mass murderers as he was sworn in as President of the Junta in an effort to lend it legitimacy and ensure the flow of arms after the murder of four American churchwomen, gener- ally regarded here as improper, though such partisans of terror and torture as Jeane Kirkpatrick and Alexander Haig, offered justifications even for this act. The slaughter in El Salvador is not mere state terrorism on a massive scale, but international terrorism, given the organiza- tion, supply, training, and direct participation by the ruler of the hemisphere. The same is true of the massacre of some 70,000 Guatemalans in the same years, when U.S. arms to the murderers flowed at close to the normal level contrary to what is commonly alleged, though it was necessary to call in U.S. proxies, the neo-Nazi Argentine generals and Israel, to imple- ment the slaughter more efficiently, and to construct an arms pipeline involving Belgium and other collaborators, under the illegal direction of the Pentagon and the CIA. Meanwhile Reagan and his associates extolled the killers and torturers for their human rights improvements and \"total dedication to de- mocracy.\" \"The striking feature of Libyan atrocities,\" two observers note in reviewing the Amnesty International study of state terror, \"is that they are the only ones whose numbers are sufficiently limited that the individual cases can be enumer- ated,\" in striking contrast to Argentina, Indonesia, or the Cen- tral American states where the Emperor molests the world.' 2.

References not given here and below can be found in my Turning the Tide (Boston: South End Press, 1985). U.S. international terrorism in El Salvador is hailed as a magnificent achievement across the mainstream political spec- trum in the United States because it laid the basis for what is called \"democracy\" in western parlance: namely, the rule of elite groups serving the needs of the Global Enforcer with the public occasionally mobilized to ratify elite decisions. In El Salvador, the United States organized what Herman and Brodhead call \"demonstration elections\" to pacify the home front, carried out in an atmosphere of \"terror and despair, macabre rumor and grisly reality,\" in the words of the obser- vers of the British Parliamentary Human Rights Group.' The U.S. press lauded this demonstration of our passionate com- mitment to democracy, as Pravda does under similar cir- cumstances. Guatemala is also considered a success, for simi- lar reasons. When half the population is marched to the polls after it has been properly traumatized by U.S.-backed vio- lence, enlightened American humanists are overjoyed at this renewed demonstration of our love for democracy, untroubled by the rise in death squad killings after the elections (including at least 94 deaths and 35 disappearances in the weeks following President Marco Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo's January inaugura- tion), the open recognition by the newly-elected president that he can do nothing given the roots of actual power in the mili- tary and the oligarchy and that the civilian government are merely \"the managers of bankruptcy and misery,\"' and the fact that the reaction in the United States helps convert the elections into a means for the U.S. to participate more fully in state terror and repression, as in El Salvador. In fact, elections in U.S. terror states are often a disaster for the domestic popu- lation, for this essential reason. These two examples, of course, represent only a small part of the U.S. role in interna- tional terrorism during the 1980s, and the grisly record goes back many years. In short, Libya is indeed a terrorist state, but in the world of international terrorism, it is hardly even a bit player. \"Their Side\" Is Terrorist The pirate's maxim explains the useful concept of \"interna- tional terrorism\" only in part. It is necessary to add a second feature: An act of terrorism enters the canon only if it is com- mitted by \"their side,\" not ours. Consider, for example, the public relations campaign about \"international terrorism\" launched in early 1981 by the Reagan administration. The 4. Edward S. Herman and Frank Brodhead, Demonstration Elections (Bos- ton: South End Press, 1984). They define this concept to refer to a device of foreign intervention in which elections are \"organized and staged by a foreign power primarily to pacify a restive home population,\" discussing several other examples as well and showing in detail that they are no less farcical than elec- tions held under Soviet authority. Their term \"demonstration elections\" was borrowed and radically misused with reference to the election in Nicaragua by Robert Leiken (New York Review of Books, December 5, 1985), as part of his campaign in support of the terrorist proxy army established by the U.S. to at- tack Nicaragua from its Honduran and Costa Rican bases. See Brodhead and Herman's letter, published after half a year's delay along with others by British Parliamentary observers (June 26, 1986), and Leiken's response, tacitly con- ceding the accuracy of their critique (by evasion) while claiming that they de- signed their concept \"as a way of focusing attention on Western imperialism while diverting it from Soviet imperialism . . . in line with their apparent be- lief that there is only one superpower villain.\" This is the standard reflex of propagandists whose deceit is exposed, in this case, requiring the suppression of Brodhead and Herman's harsh critique of elections in Poland along with much else. The remainder of Leiken's response and his articles themselves maintain a comparable level of integrity and merit careful reading for those in- terested in the workings of the U.S. ideological system. 5.

Since only acts committed by \"their side\" count as terrorism, it follows that Sterling is necessarily cor- rect, whatever the facts. In the real world, the story is quite dif- ferent. The major victims of international terrorism' in the sev- eral decades prior to the Sterling-Laqueur pronouncements were Cuba and the Palestinians, but none of this counts, by definition. When Israel bombs Palestinian refugee camps kill- ing many civilians-often without even a pretense of \"re- prisal\"-or sends its troops into Lebanese villages in \"coun- terterror\" operations where they murder and destroy, or hijacks ships and places thousands of hostages in prison camps under horrifying conditions, this is not \"terrorism\"; in fact, the rare voices of protest are thunderously condemned by loyal Party Liners for their \"anti-Semitism\" and \"double stan- dard,\" demonstrated by their failure to join the chorus of praise for \"a country that cares for human life\" (Washington Post), whose \"high moral purpose\" (Time) is the object of never-ending awe and acclaim, a country which, according to its American claque, \"is held to a higher law, as interpreted for it by journalists\" (Walter Goodman).\" Similarly, it is not terrorism when paramilitary forces operating from U.S. bases and trained by the CIA bombard Cuban hotels, sink fishing boats and attack Russian ships in Cuban harbors, poison crops and livestock, attempt to assassi- nate Castro, and so on, in missions that were running almost weekly at their peak.\" These and innumerable similar actions on the part of the Emperor and his clients are not the subject of conferences and learned tomes, or of anguished commentary and diatribes in the media and journals of opinion. Not only is \"terrorism\" defined for ideological serviceabil- ity, but standards of evidence are also conveniently set so as to achieve the Emperor's goals. To demonstrate Libya's role as a state terrorist, the flimsiest evidence, or none at all, will suf- fice. The headline of a New York Times editorial justifying the terrorist attack that killed some 100 people in Libya reads \"To 6.

It is only a minor defect that no evidence has been presented to implicate Libya in these actions. The Italian and Austrian governments stated that the terrorists were trained in Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon and had come via Damas- cus, a conclusion reiterated by Israeli Defense Minister Rabin. Four months later, in response to U.S. claims about Libyan in- volvement in the Vienna attack, the Austrian Minister of Inte- rior stated that \"there is not the slightest evidence to implicate Libya,\" again citing Syria as the connection and adding that Washington had never presented the evidence of Libyan com- plicity it had promised to provide to the Austrian authorities. He also added the correct but-in the U.S.-inexpressible comment that the problem of Lebanese-based terrorism lies largely in the failure to solve the Palestine problem, which has led desperate people to turn to violence, exactly the result in- tended by U.S. -Israeli terrorism, a matter to which we return. \"' If an individual implicated in a terrorist act once paid a visit to Libya, or is alleged to have received training or funds from Libya in the past, that suffices for condemnation of Qaddaf i as a \"mad dog\" who must be eradicated. The same standards would implicate the CIA in the murderous exploits of Cuban exiles, among numerous others. Keeping just to 1985, one of the suspects in the bombing of the Air India jumbo jet near Ire- land that was the year's worst terrorist act, killing 329 people, was trained in an anti-communist school for mercenaries in Alabama. The terrorist action that cost the most lives in the Middle East was a car-bombing in Beirut in March that killed 80 people and wounded 200, carried out by a Lebanese intelli- gence unit trained and supported by the CIA, in an effort to kill a Shi'ite leader who was believed to have been involved in \"terrorist attacks against U.S. installations\" in Beirut; the term \"terrorism\" is commonly used by foreign armies in refer- ence to actions against them by the local population which, as in this case, plausibly see them as an occupying force attempt- ing to impose a detested political settlement.\" By the standards of evidence used in the case of Libya, the U.S. is the world's leading terrorist power, even if we exclude the wholesale ter- rorism ruled ineligible by the propaganda system by the means already described. What the President calls \"the evil scourge of terrorists\" (in the specific western sense) was placed in the central focus of attention by the Reagan administration as it cane into office in 1981. The reasons were transparent, though inexpressible within the doctrinal system. The administration was committed to three related policies, all achieved with some success: (I ) transfer of resources from the poor to the rich; (2) a massive in- crease in the state sector of the economy in the traditional American way, through the Pentagon system--a device to force the public to invest in high technology industry by means of the state-guaranteed market fir the production of high tech- I0.

Such policies cannot be presented to the public in the terms in which they are intended. They can be implemented only if the general population is properly fright- ened by monsters against whom we must defend ourselves. The standard device is an appeal to the threat of Reagan's \"Evil Empire,\" what President Kennedy called \"the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy\" bent on world conquest, as he launched a rather similar program.' But confrontation with the Evil Empire can be a dangerous affair, so it is prefera- ble to do battle with safer enemies designated as the Evil Em- pire's proxies, a choice that conforms well to the third plank in the Reagan agenda, pursued for quite independent reasons: to ensure \"stability\" and \"order\" in our global domains. The \"international terrorism\" of properly chosen pirates, or of enemies such as Nicaragua or Salvadoran peasants who dare to defend themselves from our terrorist attack, is a far preferable target, and with an efficiently functioning propaganda system, it can be exploited to induce a proper sense of fear and mobili- zation among the domestic population. Qaddafi as Scapegoat Libya fit the need perfectly. Qaddafi is easy to hate and Libya is weak and defenseless, so that martial flourishes and, when needed, murder of Libyans can be conducted with im- punity. The glorious military victory in Grenada, a culmination of the extreme hostility and aggressiveness of the Carter- Reagan administrations after the Bishop government threatened to consider the needs of the poor population, served similar ends. The point is readily perceived abroad. American journalist Donald Neff, writing in a British publication about the March 1986 Gulf of Sidra incident, comments that \"this Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi with his adopted daughter, who was killed in the bombing of his home. 12. Kennedy's program was limited to the second and third plank of the Reagan agenda; the first, which was enthusiastically supported by congres- sional Democrats under Reagan and indeed had already been proposed by Car- ter, in direct violation of the will of the public, reflects the decline in relative U.S. power in the intervening years. It is no longer feasible to pursue \"great societies at home and grand designs abroad,\" in the words of Kennedy adviser Walter Heller, so the former must be abandoned. On public attitudes, see Turning the Tide, chapter 5, and Thomas Ferguson and Joel Rogers, Atlantic Monthly, May 1986. was less of a Rambo-style operation than a demonstration of the bully on the block picking a fight. It was typical of Reagan. In his five years in office, he has repeatedly got away with lording it over little guys. He did this time too.\"\" It is an inter- esting fact about American culture that this regular show of cowardice and two-bit thuggery seems to strike a responsive chord. The public relations specialists of the Reagan administration understood the utility of the Libyan enemy and wasted little time in confronting this dangerous foe. Libya was at once des- ignated as a prime agent of the Soviet-inspired \"t"
