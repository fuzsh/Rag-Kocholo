        "text": "ABOUT\n\nSacramento Shines Bright with Stars\n\nThe Sacramento region boasts some of the world’s greatest entertainers and artists, athletes, journalists, entrepreneurs and scientists. Sacramento Walk of Stars honors national and worldwide accomplishments made by those who call or once called the Sacramento region home.\n\nYou don’t have to look far to see how our region is shaping the world. Turn on NBC Nightly News for Rancho Cordova’s own Lester Holt. Walk the halls of our renowned art galleries to catch a glimpse of our region’s scenery painted by Gregory Kondos or the stylized realism of Wayne Thiebaud. Watch highlights of some of the world’s greatest Olympians to see our very own Summer Sanders or Debbie Meyer. Catch a movie, watch a television show or see a play and you’ll see the likes of Sacramento’s Colin Hanks, Sam Elliott, Greta Gerwig or LeVar Burton. And, the list goes on and on.\n\nA Fantastic City Amenity for Businesses, Residents, and Visitors\n\nCrocker Branding & Communications leads a group of local businesses, economic development organizations and community influencers to bring the Sacramento Walk of Stars to life. After two years of planning, the first stars were honored in 2016 with five stars along L Street between 18th and 19th streets. An additional four stars were honored on the south side of L Street. We will be back in The Handle District with 2019 stars sure to capture visitor attention, grace the sidewalks in front of leading Midtown restaurants and shops and bring a sense of discovery and history to everyone walking by.\n\nEvery year, beautiful bronze and terrazzo stars will be placed at select locations in midtown and downtown. The five inaugural stars were placed along L Street between 18th and 19th streets in summer 2016.\n\nThe Sacramento Walk of Stars is a nonprofit 501C4 organization. We provide a civic amenity with educational, cultural and economic benefits for residents, businesses and visitors to the Sacramento region.\n\nQuestions? Contact us at hello@sacramentowalkofstars.com."
