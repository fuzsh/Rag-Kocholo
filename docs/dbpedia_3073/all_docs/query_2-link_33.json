        "text": "SCENE: An aerial shot of Boston, Massachusetts, daytime. The shot changes to the exterior of a house, covered in vines. Inside we see a bedroom, with a blond woman sleeping in bed. The sheets have a forest pattern. Next to the bed is a small table and chair, both covered with books. A knock on the door sounds.\n\nAgent Howard: Agent Parker?\n\nAudrey Parker: Oh, no. No, no, no.\n\nAudrey fiddles with her alarm clock, and accidentally turns on the radio, which plays \"Love Will Keep Us Together\". She turns the radio off and hurries to the living room to answer the door. Like the bedroom, the living room is sparsely decorated. There is a large wardrobe and some framed pictures of the woods leaning next to the wall. There are a couple small tables, both covered with books. Even the mantel is covered with books.\n\nHoward: (knocking) Agent Parker? Where are you?\n\nAudrey: God, it's kind of early, isn't it? (opens the door)\n\nHoward: Couldn't wait. (Howard enters, and looks around the room.) It's impressive how little you've done with... so little.\n\nAudrey: Well, it's what I do with all the vacation time that I don't get. Hit a bunch of outlet stores, and furniture shop with all the guys that I don't meet.\n\nA close-up of the coffee table shows us two specific book title: \"To the Tenth Generation\" and \"Unstake My Heart\". Audrey has closed the front door and returned to stand in front of Howard, at attention with her hands clasped loosely behind her back.\n\nHoward: (Looks down at the coffee table and picks up \"Unstake my heart\".) Never took you for uh...teenage vampires.\n\nAudrey: Oh, well you should see what I read on the plane.\n\nHoward: FBI is non-fiction work. I need you to keep it that way.\n\nAudrey: Is this about Miami? (Audrey puts her hair up in a messy bun, and sits down on an empty chair, one knee pulled toward her chest.)\n\nHoward: Oh, yeah. I'm talking about Miami. We've been through this.\n\nAudrey: You know, being open to possibilities is how we close cases... Like that one.\n\nHoward: It sends you down blind alleys, too. (Audrey picks at her nails.)\n\nAudrey: Yeah, well where I grew up, a blind alley was even better than reality. (Audrey snaps her fingers and fidgets slightly, before standing and going over to the wardrobe.) So... where are you sending me this time?\n\nHoward: Haven. Maine. Hometown of one Jonas Lester. (Howard removes a thin folder from his coat and puts it on the coffee table. Audrey pulls out a suitcase.) He escaped a federal lock-up nineteen hours ago. Killed a guard doing it. Find Lester. Bring him back. (Audrey picks the file up from the table, and opens it, scanning through the pages.) Nothing else. That's your reality. You're a good agent, Audrey. And someday, maybe, you'll be a great agent. Just... focus on the job.\n\nAudrey: (Audrey closes the folder and puts it down on the table.) Put the book on the table when you're done with it. (Audrey turns to leave and Howard puts the book in his coat pocket.)\n\n***** SCENE: Tuwiuwok Bluff, night. Jonas Lester is running through the woods, chasing a man. They break into a clearing at the bluff's edge. Lester points his gun at the man.\n\nLester: Stop! Stop, damn it! Stop! Stop, damn it! Don't make me shoot you! Aaaah!\n\nThe gun blows out of Lester's hand, flying high off the edge of the cliff. A second later, Lester himself is blown backwards off the cliff, screaming. The man walks to the edge and looks out to where Lester fell. The clouds begin to part and the \"Haven\" logo appears. ***** SCENE: Haven, daytime. Audrey Parker drives on a long winding road next to the water's edge. She listens to the radio.\n\n[Radio]: This just in: Six of Tommy Bolt's seven missing fingers have been returned. This is Ryan Wisely at WDLH, the Voice of Haven.\n\nAudrey flicks the radio. \"Love Will Keep Us Together\" comes on. She looks back up at the road to see a huge crack has formed in the middle of the road. She swerves hard. Her car crashes through the guard and almost completely tips off the cliff edge. When the car fully stops, it's halfway off the edge of the cliff. Waves crash on the rocks below.\n\nAudrey: Okay... Nuh-uh. No. There's no way I'm dying to this.\n\nShe risks leaning forward to turn the radio off. The car creaks terribly.\n\nAudrey: Alright, um.\n\nA man taps on the passenger window, startling her.\n\nAudrey: God!\n\nNathan: You need some help?\n\nAudrey: No. No, I'm all right. Thank you.\n\nNathan: Oh. Okay, then.\n\n(Nathan steps away from the car, leaving.)\n\nAudrey: God. Unbelievable.\n\n(Nathan appears on the driver's side of the car, starling Audrey)\n\nAudrey: Whoa!\n\nNathan gestures at the locked door. Audrey undoes the lock. He opens the door, reaches in, grabs her by the shoulder and pulls her out. Once out of the car, the car tips over the edge of the cliff. Nathan and Audrey stand at the edge of the cliff, looking down, watching it crash down to the bottom.\n\nNathan: Shame about the car.\n\nAudrey: Eh, it's a rental.\n\nNathan glaces over at Audrey, and notices that she has gun holstered at her waist. He quickly draws his weapon, and noticing his movement, she mimics him, drawing her gun as well. They face off in a weaver stance.\n\nAudrey: Whoa! FBI! Who are you?\n\nNathan: Haven PD. Who are you?\n\nAudrey: FBI. Are you deaf?\n\nNathan: How do I know that?\n\nAudrey: Okay, well, for starters, I'm wearing the gun on my belt. It's a government-issue 9mm. And they gave me, you know, one of these.\n\n(She reaches into her jacket, then stops when Nathan protests.)\n\nNathan: Hey, keep your hands where I can see them.\n\nAudrey: Okay, what am I going to do? Pull out another gun?\n\n(Nathan gestures with his gun, indicating that she should grab her badge. Audrey reaches back into her jacket and pulls out her badge.) A\n\nAudrey: Alright. Come on, I showed you mine.\n\n(Nathan pulls out his badge and Audrey squints at it. Realizing, he flips the badge in his hand, so that his ID card is now facing out, and holds it up next to his face to show her that he matches the picture on the card.) Okay. (They both slowly lower their guns and reholster them.) So, uh... are all your roads this bad?\n\nNathan: Sandstone. Likes to shift.\n\nAudrey: Uh huh.\n\nNathan: Can I give you a ride somewhere?\n\nAudrey: I guess it's friendlier than if I commandeer your vehicle.\n\nNathan: Probably less paperwork, too.\n\nAudrey: (smiles). Hmmph.\n\nAudrey and Nathan walk over to his truck. He opens the passenger door for her.\n\nAudrey: Thank you. (Audrey pulls the door closed, accidentally slamming it on Nathan's fingers.) Oh! I'm sorry are... are you alright?\n\nNathan: It's alright. I didn't feel it.\n\nAudrey: Oh. Tough guy, huh?\n\nNathan walks around the car, and gets into the driver's seat. He starts the engine.\n\nAudrey: Hey, uh I don't suppose you've seen a guy named Jonas Lester recently?\n\nNathan: Just left him.\n\nNathan's truck pulls away\n\n***** SCENE: The beach below Tuwiuwok Bluff. A large area is cornered off with police tape. Two cruisers and an ambulance are parked on the side of the road. Audrey is bent over the dead body of Jonas Lester. She iwears crime scene gloves and using a plastic pen to manipulate the folds of his jacket. Nathan and Chief Garland Wournos walk up.\n\nGarland: Well, keep looking all you want. This man's pretty dead. Tends not to change much.\n\nNathan: Chief Wuornos, this is...\n\nAudrey: (standing) Special Agent Audrey Parker.\n\nGarland: Oh. It's the FBI. Well, is this one of those situations where you're here claiming to help, but you're really just here to step on my toes?\n\nAudrey: Not in these shoes. I came here, actually, looking for him.\n\nAudrey bends back down over the body.\n\nGarland: Yeah. Yeah, we got the alert when Jonas, here, escaped.\n\nAudrey: The Bureau thought that he might return to his hometown. I guess he did. Ah! Somebody missed something.\n\nAudrey uses a pair of tweezers to pull out a small piece of paper.\n\nAudrey: There's writing on it. (Nathan crouches down next to Audrey and pulls out an evidence bag.) I can't read whatever this is, but it's worth checking out.\n\nAudrey drops the slip of paper into the evidence bag.\n\nNathan: I'll get it to the lab in Bangor.\n\nNathan leaves with the evidence bag. Garland pulls out a packet of nicotine gum.\n\nGarland: Well, why don't you enlighten us? What does the FBI Special Agent have in the way of insight?\n\nAudrey: Well, his injuries don't suggest a struggle. I don't think he was dragged here.\n\nGarland: You don't?\n\nAudrey: (standing) He died last night.\n\nGarland pops a piece of nicotine gum.\n\nAudrey: But your guys are going to have to give us the exact time. At first glance, it looks like he fell from up there, (gestures up to Tuwiuwok Bluff) but his body is way too far from the edge, you know, unless there's a cannon up there or something. Anyway, I'm not sold on it being an accident.\n\nGarland: You're over-thinking this. The best thing Jonas Lester ever did for this town was die. So, as far as I'm concerned, we're done.\n\nAudrey: He killed a federal employee, so my investigation isn't done until I know why he came back here and what happened to him.\n\nGarland: Nathan, get yourself a real crime to investigate here.\n\nHe starts to walk off.\n\nNathan: Chief, how about I show Agent Parker around, while we tie up the loose ends.\n\nGarland: Go ahead. Waste his time, too. He's got nothing else to do with it.\n\nGarland walks off and Audrey takes out her phone to call Agent Howard.\n\nInside a sedan with raindrops on the windows, Agent Howard's phone rings. He answers:\n\nHoward: Howard.\n\nAudrey: It's Parker. Lester's dead.\n\nHoward: How'd it happen?\n\nAudrey: Well, they're calling it an accident, but something doesn't seem right.\n\nHoward: Sounds right up your alley, Agent Parker.\n\nAudrey: Chief Wuornos doesn't think so.\n\nHoward: I trust your instincts.\n\nAudrey: I'm working with a local detective, uh... (Audrey looks to Nathan for a name to give Howard.)\n\nNathan: Wuornos.\n\n*****\n\nAudrey: You call your dad the chief?\n\nNathan: I call my boss the chief.\n\nAudrey: He's a stubborn man. What's his deal? Is he testing me?\n\nNathan: Not you. Me.\n\nAudrey: Hey, no offense, but half the reason I want to solve this case is just to piss him off.\n\nNathan: And it would.\n\nAudrey: I guess that's one advantage of being raised by the state: not much parental conflict.\n\nAudrey and Nathan reach a sign saying \"Tumiuwok Bluff, Haven Municipal Department of Recreation\"\n\nNathan: So... you're an orphan?\n\nAudrey: I'm a free agent. Tuwiuwok. Is that Native American?\n\nNathan: Migmaw, yeah. It means, \"Haven.\"\n\nAudrey: It's easier to spell, I guess. Huh. (Overhead pan of a dirt path to the edge of the bluff.) These must be Lester's footprints. It looks like they're chasing a second set right... here. And Lester's end...abruptly, here.\n\nNathan: Could be.\n\nAudrey: Uprooted trees? Well, that... that's strange. You guys get tornadoes up here this time of year?\n\nNathan: Maybe... one a year.\n\nAudrey: Really? 'Cause something did a number on these trees.\n\nNathan: No wind last night. I already checked.\n\nAudrey: You did?\n\nNathan: Couldn't find a cannon, either.\n\nAudrey: (chuckling) Hmm.\n\nNathan pulls a fedora out from behind a tree. Audrey uses a pen to pull a handgun up out of the moss\n\nAudrey: Now we're talking.\n\nNathan: (Walking over to Audrey) Nice gun, though Lester wasn't shot. I did find this.\n\nAudrey: A hat?\n\nNathan: I know a guy who wears a hat like this.\n\nAudrey: So do I, but that doesn't make it evidence.\n\nNathan: Well, Lester stole all my guy's money.\n\nAudrey: Well, okay! So that makes it evidence. Let's go talk to your guy.\n\n***** SCENE: Nathan's truck drives into town. We see a small seaside town with some brightly colored houses and boats in the harbor.\n\nNathan: Welcome to Haven. You like pancakes? We've got good pancakes.\n\nAudrey: What about lobster? I mean, isn't Maine famous for lobster?\n\nNathan: I don't like lobster. I really like pancakes.\n\nThey drive past a cemetery at the edge of town and into streets lined with stores.\n\nAudrey: I like the truck.\n\nNathan: Thanks. Had it since I was nineteen\n\nAudrey: How do you keep a car that long?\n\nNathan: I don't drive off cliffs.\n\nNathan parks next to a contemporary art gallery, across the street from a shop selling menswear, and they get out of the car and start walking.\n\nAudrey: So... Who's this hat belong to?\n\nNathan: Conrad Brower. Gulf War vet, local handyman. Went into the service with Lester. Conrad came out an unemployed hero, Lester came out a loser with computer skills. Did time for stealing VA benefits from guys he was in with.\n\nAudrey: Including Conrad.\n\nNathan: Yep.\n\n(We see Conrad doing some repair work on a building.)\n\nNathan: Hey, Conrad. Helping Marion again?\n\nConrad: Nathan. That's what I do.\n\nNathan: Found your hat up on Tuwiuwok Bluff.\n\nAudrey hands the hat to Conrad.\n\nConrad: Thanks. Appreciate it.\n\nAudrey: Uh... (She walks closer Conrad) were you out there yesterday evening?\n\nConrad: Maintain the perimeter. (pause) Please.\n\nAudrey: (To Nathan) What?\n\nNathan: Uh... Conrad has personal space issues.\n\nAudrey: Right. (Audrey backs up to where she was standing next to Nathan.) Pardon me, Mr. Brower. (Audrey pulls out her FBI badge.) Any particular time you were planning on answering my question?\n\nConrad: I was up there this morning. I like to watch the boats head out. Forgot the hat, I guess.\n\nAudrey: And you never saw Jonas Lester?\n\nConrad: Not moving.\n\nAudrey: But you did know him.\n\nConrad: You mean the service.\n\nAudrey: Right. And then when he got out he stole all your money.\n\nConrad: Not just mine. I know where you're going.\n\nNathan: Conrad... Yesterday, late afternoon, evening, where were you?\n\nConrad: Digging clams. Out to Edgewater Bay. 'Till sunset.\n\nAudrey: (to Nathan) Alright, you speak monosyllable. You wanna try to break through his perimeter while I go inside and talk to the shop owner?\n\nNathan: Sure.\n\nAudrey walks past Conrad, towards the door of the shop.\n\nConrad: Where are you going?\n\nAudrey: Mr. Brower, if you have something that you want to tell me, you go right on ahead.\n\nSuddenly a thick fog descends, making it hard to see anything.\n\nAudrey: That's weird.\n\nConrad walks a step away, disappearing into the fog.\n\nAudrey: Conrad? Conrad!\n\nNathan: He's gone.\n\n[Man yelling, squealing brakes]\n\nNathan starts walking out into what we can barely see is the street. Audrey narrowly avoids being hit by a bicyclist who seems to come out of nowhere. Suddenly we see that Nathan has walked in front of a large truck, barely visible because of the headlines.\n\n[Horn blaring]\n\nAudrey: Nathan! Watch out!\n\nShe tackles him to the ground, pushing him out of the way of the truck.[Horn blaring]\n\n***** SCENE: Still on the same street in Haven, but the fog has cleared and an ambulance is arrived. Nathan is sitting balanced on the edge of a gurney. A doctor, Eleanor, is drawing his blood, while Audrey looks on. In the background, Chief Wuornos appears to be questioning some civilians.\n\n[Radio chatter]\n\nEleanor: Congratulations, Nathan. Now you get to come back with me for an MRI. Another one.\n\nNathan: Lucky number nine.\n\nEleanor: Yeah. Cheer up. The tenth one's free! He's a regular.\n\nNathan: I'll be back in a jiff.\n\nAudrey: You seriously can't feel pain?\n\nNathan: It's called idiopathic neuropathy.\n\nAudrey: You really couldn't feel it when that car door hit your hand?\n\nNathan: No.\n\nAudrey: Can you feel fire?\n\nNathan: No.\n\nAudrey: Ice?\n\nNathan: (deadpan) Oddly, yes, I can feel ice.\n\nAudrey: You can feel ice?\n\nNathan: No. I can feel a headache coming on, though.\n\nAudrey: Hey, so that was strange. I've never seen fog like that before.\n\nNathan: Maine gets lots of kinds of fog.\n\nEleanor: Alright. Get in the back.\n\nNathan: Oh, I can drive myself.\n\nEleanor: I'm not arguing with you, Nathan. The back.\n\nEleanor and Nathan walk towards the amubulance.\n\nAudrey: Go. I'll call the Bureau and then check out Conrad's alibi.\n\nNathan: Eleanor, you're overreacting.\n\nAs Audrey walks away from the ambulance, she calls Agent Howard.\n\nHoward: Howard.\n\nAudrey: Agent Howard, yeah. I'm still here. I haven't found anything. Nothing relevant, anyway, but I'll keep in touch. Okay, bye.\n\nAudrey stops just short of walking into two older men, Dave and Vince Teagues.\n\nVince: You must be Agent Parker. I understand you're investigating Jonas Lester's death.\n\nAudrey: And you are...?\n\nDave: Dave Tiggs. My brother, Vince. (He hands her his card.) Publishers, editors, and every damn thing else in the Haven Herald.\n\nVince: We thought Lester'd be our lead, but now it'll be the fog.\n\nAudrey: Yeah. That fog was strange, right?\n\nDave: Well, welcome to Haven.\n\nVince: Keep feeling like I've seen you before.\n\nAudrey: That didn't sound creepy at all.\n\nDave: Oh, Lord. It does.\n\nVince: Doesn't it?\n\nDave: Only because you said it, Vince. How bout we drop by later and you can answer a few questions about the case?\n\nAudrey: How about I just call you?\n\nVince: Oh! Fierce, isn't she?\n\nDave: Well change your mind, drop by.\n\nDave walks off.\n\nVince: We serve Mai Tais at 3.\n\nAudrey: Okay.\n\nDave pulls a tandem bicycle out from the curb and gets on in front. Vince gets on behind.\n\nVince: I want to ride in the front this time.\n\nDave: No, no. I always ride in the front.\n\nVince: Well, it's my turn now.\n\nNathan: Agent Parker. (He walks up to Audrey.) MRIs are overrated. Let's go talk to Mary.\n\n***** SCENE: Nathan and Audrey walk into Hours, Marion's antique store.\n\nMarion: Nathan. Is everyone alright out there?\n\nNathan: They will be. This is Audrey Parker with the FBI.\n\nMarion: Marion Caldwell. This is my friend, Ted Ford.\n\nTed: Hello.\n\nAudrey: Is this Santa Barbara? (She looks down at a set of postcards, clearly labeled Santa Barbara.)\n\nMarion: Yes. Have you been there?\n\nAudrey: Twice. Once for a pedophile, the other for a serial killer.\n\nTed: Marion and I are thinking of moving there and buying a shop.\n\nAudrey: Oh! Oh. (awkwardly) It's beautiful. It's beautiful, and it's a lot safer now.\n\nMarion: Well, we're just... flirting with the idea.\n\nTed: Marion lost her mother not long ago, and I think the change might do her some good.\n\nMarion: Ted's had antique shops all over. I've never left Haven, so... it's a big step.\n\nAudrey: Uh, Conrad Brower, he works for you, right?\n\nMarion: Yes, he does. He's been very helpful since my mother passed.\n\nAudrey: And how well do you know him?\n\nMarion: Oh, we grew up together.\n\nTed: What's this about?\n\nNathan: Do either of you know Jonas Lester?\n\nNathan's cell phone rings.\n\nTed: The guy who died? I heard about it.\n\nNathan walks out of the shop to answer his phone.\n\nAudrey: Do you know where Conrad was last night?\n\nMarion: Yes, I dropped him off at the Edgewater Beach to go clamming. He made me stay for the first bucket. He's so thoughtful that way.\n\nAudrey: I'm sure he is.\n\nTed: Whatever you might be thinking, Agent Parker, Conrad's a solid guy.\n\nMarion: Oh, he just couldn't be involved. Conrad is the gentlest man I've ever met.\n\nNathan hangs up his phone and walks back into the store.\n\nNathan: Excuse me. We need to go.\n\nAudrey: Thank you.\n\nTed puts his arm around Marion and smiles at them leaving.\n\n***** SCENE: Nathan and Audrey walk out to a dock.\n\nAudrey: Okay, you know, this better be good, because Marion might have more to tell me about Conrad.\n\nNathan: Gun trace came in. Belongs to a guy I know. Duke Crocker.\n\nAudrey: You like him for this?\n\nNathan: I don't like him, period.\n\nNathan walks on to a boat.'\n\nNathan: Okay, now. Let's see what we're smuggling this week. (in a raised voice) Hello? Duke!\n\nNathan climbs up to the cockpit of the boat and peers into the window. We focus on a June 2010 tide table with the bottom righthand corner ripped off. No one's in there.\n\nNathan: (shouting) Duke! (in a normal tone of voice, to Audrey) Ugh. He's not here.\n\nNathan gets off the boat and returns to Audrey.\n\nNathan: Everything about this guy is a pain in my ass.\n\nNathan starts walking off the dock, with Audrey following him.\n\nAudrey: Why? Because he wasn't home?\n\nNathan: Because he's unreliable, untrustworthy, a total waste of...\n\nAudrey: - Yeah, yeah, I got it. (pause) Wait. Where are you going?\n\nNathan: To look for Duke under the usual rocks.\n\n****\n\nSCENE: A view of the town again. It's starting to get dark. Conrad knocks on the door to Hours, and Marion lets him in, closing the door behind him.\n\nMarion: The police were just here looking for you.\n\nConrad: You shouldn't be talking to them.\n\nMarion: Conrad, this isn't good.\n\nConrad: Marion, you trust me, don't you?\n\nThere's an awkward pause.\n\nMarion: Do you remember when we were kids? You taught me how to swim. Remember how afraid I was to go under the water?\n\nConrad: You did it eventually.\n\nMarion: Yes. Because I was safe with you. I have always trusted you. But this thing with Lester, I don't know.\n\nConrad: Then let me handle this myself.\n\nMarion: I'm afraid, Conrad.\n\nConrad: So am I.\n\n****\n\nSCENE: We hear a clap of thunder from the inside of Hours and then see the storm increase as we pan over to the docks, where Audrey is on the phone. Lightning flashes.\n\nAudrey: He hasn't shown up here, either. Tell Howard that I'll just touch base with him later.\n\nIt begins to hail.Audrey: Perfect. Thank you!\n\nAudrey runs off the dock with a hand over her head to hold off some of the hail. Lightning strikes a power box as she runs past, and she is thrown back, off the dock. She hits the water with a large splash and the scene ends with her appearing to sink into the waves.\n\n*****\n\nSCENE: It's morning on the harbor. Audrey wakes up in bed in the cabin of a boat, tucked under the covers. She startles and checks under the covers to see what she's wearing. Realizing that she's naked, she pulls the covers back down.\n\nAudrey: Damn it!\n\nShe finds her gun and her badge on top of a denim shirt next to the bed. She goes out to the main part of the boat wearing just the shirt, holding her gun aiming downwards but ready to shoot.\n\nAudrey: You took my clothes.\n\nPan to a newspaper in Japanese, which lowers to reveal the face of Duke Crocker.\n\nDuke: Good morning.\n\nAudrey: You took my clothes.\n\nDuke: Well, now I laundered your clothes. I saved your life. That's an odd combination, when you think about it. I mean, if you think about it.\n\nAudrey: You must be Duke.\n\nDuke smiles and starts putting together a cup of coffee from a french press.\n\nDuke: Milk... (He walks up to Audrey and hands her a mug.) One sugar, right?\n\nAudrey: No. No, and why would you know how I take my coffee?\n\nDuke: I wouldn't. But it would have been cool if I did.\n\nAudrey chuckles and takes the mug of coffee, walking over to a clothes line where her pants and shirt from the day before are hanging. Audrey grabs her pants and dresses over the course of the following conversation.\n\nAudrey: Do you know Jonas Lester?\n\nDuke: Uh... I know he's dead. That's it. Just... dead.\n\nAudrey: You might want to rethink your answer.\n\nDuke: Oh. Really?\n\nAudrey: Yeah, your gun was found where he died.\n\nDuke: Doesn't sound like me.\n\nAudrey: Well, you know... everybody makes mistakes.\n\nDuke sits back down with his newspaper and his own cup of coffee.\n\nDuke: I didn't make that one. My gun was stolen.\n\nAudrey: Okay, so... of all the guns in the world, he stole yours. Yep. That's convenient. And then, you don't report it, which is also convenient and illegal.\n\nDuke: Actually, I did report it. Nathan didn't mention that part, did he? (Duke smiles) I thought as much. So are we good?\n\nAudrey: If you're telling me the truth, we might be. Nathan really doesn't like you.\n\nDuke: Oh, and let me guess what he said. Uh... \"He's unreliable, dishonest, and a general pain in the butt.\"\n\nAudrey: Ass. Yeah, he said ass.\n\nAudrey is now fully dressed and picks up her cup of coffee.\n\nDuke: Wow. And strangely, I was going to say that. I was.\n\nAudrey: Was he right?\n\nDuke makes an equivocating gesture in response.\n\nPan to the dock, which looks battered by the previous night's storm.\n\nAudrey: Is the weather ever normal here?\n\nDuke: It's uh... normal for Maine.\n\nAudrey: 'Cause this damage, this is odd. And I need to get a bird's eye view picture of this. Oh. Oh no. My cell phone. Oh, crap, it's...\n\nDuke: Oh, yeah. It's toast. But I uh... I got you another one.\n\nHe hands her a pale pink, rhinestone covered flip phone.\n\nAudrey: A princess phone?\n\nDuke: Seriously? You really need to work on your \"thank you\"s.\n\nAudrey turns away skeptically. The scene ends before we can see if she takes the phone.\n\n**** SCENE: The Haven police office. We pan through the building to see several police officers at work, one of whom is bringing in a handcuffed criminal. In an office, Audrey sits behind a desk looking at a paper, while Nathan stands over a different desk.\n\nNathan: I don't care if he reported it. It's his gun, and he needs to explain it to me.\n\nAudrey: Well, you could have told me that before I talked to him. The guy's not all bad. He saved my life and then he served me coffee.\n\nNathan: I've known him since he was five. He's all bad. (Audrey hands him a pice of paper) What's this?\n\nAudrey: Instant hail storm. The fog starts in town and then heads out to sea. There's something strange going on here, right?\n\nNathan: So what? It's weather. It's weird. Bangor forensics restored the paper we found on Lester's body. Turns out, it's from the tide calendar on Duke's boat. It's boring, but it's real evidence.\n\nNathan hands her a blown up image of a scrap of paper. It matches the torn corner of the tide calendar and has the numbers 2-5-7-8-9 written over it.\n\nAudrey: I know but... 25789. What do those numbers mean?\n\nNathan: That's what I plan on asking him. You coming?\n\nAudrey: No, you go. I got enough to take care of between Conrad and the weather.\n\nNathan: Suit yourself. (He walks out of the office.)\n\nGarland: So, have you managed to turn your accident into a murder yet?\n\nAudrey looks up to see that Chief Wuornos has walked into the office.\n\nAudrey: Good to see you, too, Chief.\n\nGarland: You're still wasting Nathan's time.\n\nAudrey: Actually, I have a few leads, and your son just linked the tide calendar that we found on Lester's body to... Tide calendar...\n\nShe starts typing on the computer.\n\nGarland: Oh, your meds just kicked in, did they?\n\nAudrey: Hey, can you go clamming at Edgewater Beach at high tide?\n\nGarland: Depends on how long you can hold your breath.\n\nAudrey walks out of the office.\n\n****\n\nSCENE: Audrey drives a new rental car up to Hours and gets out. Conrad is outside of the building.\n\nAudrey: You lied to me, Conrad. I know you weren't clamming. Makes me think you were up on that cliff with Lester.\n\nConrad: You don't understand.\n\nAudrey: No, I understand you lied to me, you had Marion lie to me, you had plenty of reasons to kill the man who ruined you.\n\nShe's now a foot or two away from Conrad.\n\nConrad: Respect the perimeter!\n\nAudrey ignores this and walks closer\n\nAudrey: How did you get him so far from the cliff?\n\nConrad: Please, stay away.\n\nMarion runs out of the shop and goes to stand behind Conrad.\n\nMarion: Agent Parker, leave him alone.\n\nConrad turns towards Marion\n\nConrad: Get away...\n\nAudrey: (grabbing Conrad's shoulder to turn him back towards her) Tell me! Whoa!\n\nAudrey is blown back into her car in a sudden gust of wind."
