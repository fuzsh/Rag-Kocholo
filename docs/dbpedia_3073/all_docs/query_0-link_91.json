        "text": "Major Margaret “Hot Lips” Houlihan (Objecting to a wounded North Korean soldier in the O.R.): That man is a prisoner of war, doctor!\n\nCaptain “Trapper” John McIntyre: So are you, sweetheart, but you don’t know it.\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAfter you’ve read enough books about movies and interviews with people who make or star in them and seen enough “making of” home-video documentaries, certain essential truisms become manifest, and make sorting things out a little easier. One lesson I’ve learned is that nothing Dustin Hoffman has ever said about a movie is to be believed. (I’m not saying he’s a liar. I’m sure he believes every word he says.) Another is that Orson Welles, like Truman Capote, liked a good story better than reality. And yet another is that nearly everything Robert Altman had to say about MASH bears about as much relationship to reality as the contents of the Warren Report.*\n\nOne example, at random: Sally Kellerman’s famous shower scene. Gary Burghoff, who played “Radar” O’Reilly in the movie as well as the subsequent television series, has always said that to make her feel less self-conscious he jokingly proposed that everyone on the camera side in her line of sight strip too. Kellerman later said that when the tent flap raised up she saw Burghoff standing naked next to the camera, which the actor confirmed. But to hear Altman tell it on the MASH DVD commentary, it was his idea, and both he and Burghoff were nude. It’s a minor incident, I know, but after hearing Altman claim for two hours that everything that worked in MASH was his and everything he felt did not was due to someone else it was a blessed relief to go directly to The Godfather commentary track and hear Francis Ford Coppola giving credit to his cinematographer, his actors, his assistants and anyone else who contributed a line or a bit of business or made a suggestion that enriched his movie. Altman also never missed an opportunity to run down the Richard Hooker novel on which his movie was based, which he called bad and racist, or (especially) the subsequent television series… which he called bad and racist…\n\nOne can well understand Altman’s bitterness. He was paid only $75,000 for directing a movie that, made for less than $4 million reaped $40 million at the box office at the time of its release (back, as they say, when $40 million was real money) and eventually became, through the teevee show, a cash-cow that is still being milked. Further, not only did 20th Century-Fox not exhibit the integrity and basic decency required to reward Altman with even a nominal bonus for having made their biggest-grossing picture of the year and the third highest-grossing movie released in 1970 but his teenage son eventually racked up some $2 million for writing the lyrics to that movie’s theme song. Although Altman liked to claim the movie gave him something more than money — his career — from his consistent, sour comments on it, the financial deprivations of MASH clearly bugged him for the remainder of his life.\n\nAbout the book and the show, however, Robert Altman was full of shit.\n\nSince first picking up, at the age of 13, the novel attributed to Richard Hooker (the nom de plume of the physician Richard Hornberger, Jr. in collaboration with the journalist W.C. Heinz, who polished the manuscript) I have read MASH more times than any other book, and always with undiminished pleasure. It is true that Hornberger was a social conservative, although his novel does not necessarily reflect that. It is also the case that, having been drafted and sent to Korea in 1952 he missed the period, roughly 1950 — 1951, during which the M.A.S.H (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) units were at their most mobile, so there is no “bug-out” in the book as there often were before he arrived, and which later memorably occurred in the television series. I will further attest that, yes, Hornberger’s novel (like the eventual movie and, for a single season, the show) contains a black doctor called Oliver Wendell Jones and nicknamed “Spearchucker” during his college years as a javelin thrower. But since he is as much a part of “The Swamp” as Hawkeye Pierce, “Trapper John” McIntyre or Duke Forrest, the Southerner with whom he reaches a mutually respectful accommodation, and is a superior surgeon in no way stereotyped or subservient, I have never felt any racial animus toward this character on the part of the author. Indeed, Dr. Jones is such a part of the fraternity of the Swamp he’s also in the two subsequent novels Hornberger wrote in the 1970s.† (Although the author is, I admit, rather freer in MASH with the ugly epithet “gook,” still in use in the Vietnam era, as well as, at least once, “Chink.”) As for the series, which the rock-ribbed Maine Republican Hornberger despised for its liberal attitudes, the charge by Altman of racism is even more absurd. The last thing Larry Gelbart, who developed the show for television, would have wanted to be associated with was a racist series; while I have yet to meet anyone who (aside from myself) remembers watching it, Gelbart parlayed his “M*A*S*H” success into a second, short-lived comedy series called “Roll Out!” in 1973 and which centered on the black supply drivers in World War II France, and that at a time when there were no other series on the American air featuring a majority-black cast. (Even that superliberal Norman Lear didn’t have one until 1974 when “Good Times” premiered.) At least Hornberger ascribes to the Korean locals the wider variety of jobs they performed in the camps, which the series largely ignored… as did, for all his talk of other people’s racism, Altman’s movie.\n\nAside from the foregoing, the content of the “M*A*S*H” series speaks for itself, as it did for 11 seasons on CBS. The television “M*A*S*H” can be criticized on a number of levels, not least of which was its increasing preachiness and concessions to the vanity of its stars — Loretta Swit’s terrible 1980s hairdos, for example, and the softening of her character to the point where she barely had a reason to exist. But to deem the show as Altman frequently (and reflexively?) did “racist,” is risible.\n\nExactly why the novel MASH appeals to me to the degree that I’ve re-read it repeatedly since 1974 is a bit of a mystery, one I’m not sure I can fully explain. In addition to my deep fondness for the characters Hornberger created and who have become beloved of, by now, generations of readers, movie audiences and television (and home video) viewers across the globe, I suppose I like the dryness of his prose style and the matter-of-fact tone even when he’s describing outrages both comic and dramatic, as well as the genuinely witty manner with which the Swampmen communicate and the sharp playfulness of their verbal acrobatics, a trait they share in a more self-conscious, deliberately humorous manner with the characters in Catch-22 whose burlesque of language is of course representative of Joseph Heller’s satirical use of vaudeville humor. I admire the oddball characters in the book, seldom as self-righteous as their cinematic and television counterparts. I like its episodic structure — Ring Lardner, Jr., who adapted it for the movies, quite rightly observed that it was less a novel than a collection of short stories featuring the same characters — and the way it, like the movie, begins with Hawkeye and Duke arriving in Korea and ends with their leaving. I appreciate the seriousness with which the operating theatre is treated because Hornberger, like Lardner and Altman and Gelbart, never loses sight of why these men are in Korea. And, frankly, the book simply makes me laugh, a lot. I do think the series bested Hornberger and Altman in one respect: Making explicit what Gelbart considered the material’s perfect existential conundrum, young surgeons patching up even younger soldiers to be sent to the hospitals of Seoul and Tokyo where they will be given fuller treatment and rehabilitation and, all too often, returned to active duty to be shot (or in any case, shot at) and bombed again.\n\nI suppose that, taken together, these novelistic factors simply exert a pull on my literary imagination that is irresistible. And that’s not to mention a few items not even the movie, for all its irreverence, dared to depict. I’m thinking partly of the way the Swampmen torment a staggeringly insensitive Protestant chaplain, partly of the way the “Painless Pole”‘s bout of impotence is resolved by dint of a blue ribbon tied around his prodigious appendage before he’s resurrected (Painless doesn’t know whether he went to Heaven or to Hell but wherever he was, he declares happily, “I won First Prize”) and mostly of the way Hawkeye and Duke raise the necessary tuition, room, board and travel expenses for their young houseboy Ho-Jon‡ to attend Pierce’s alma mater after he’s been drafted by the ROK Armed Forces, wounded in battle and fixed up by the Swampmen: By convincing Trapper John to grow out his beard and his locks, be photographed as Jesus, autograph hundreds of the subsequent snaps for sale as souvenirs and, kept perpetually drunk, be tied to a cross and dangled from a helicopter for personal appearances. It would undoubtedly have made a hilariously irreligious addition to the picture but even the sardonic atheist Lardner, whose only novel (The Ecstasy of Owen Muir) was an anti-clerical satire, wasn’t brave enough to include it in his screenplay and I doubt the lapsed-Catholic Altman could have gotten away with it on a studio picture in 1969 even if he’d tried.\n\nWhat Robert Altman did get away with in MASH was almost everything else, and which helped make the movie a cultural touchstone and a box-office phenomenon. Although thwarted in his attempt to make explicit that the picture was set in Vietnam (20th Century-Fox insisted on a “dedication scroll” making clear it was actually Korea) those who saw MASH when it was new and the increasingly hated war in Vietnam was raging fruitlessly and murderously on, especially its core youthful audience, had no difficulty drawing the inference.§ They understood that war is an obscenity beside which sexual pranks, irreligious commentary and four-letter words are as a few skinned knees to a holocaust. The things Altman, and Ingo Preminger, the movie’s producer, fought for, such as the bloody, sometimes painful and occasionally excruciating operating room scenes, were the things that mattered, and what MASH was about. (Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, the producer of the television series, had similar problems, at least in the early days of the show, with the suits at CBS.) The stark juxtaposition of humor with genuine horror, common now, was unique at the time. It’s intrinsic to the novel but, even for the late 1960s — the picture was filmed in 1969 but released in early 1970 — strikingly different from the then-current tone of movie comedy.\n\nMASH didn’t sound like other American movies of the time either; Altman placed small mobile microphones on many of his actors, enabling him to catch what was necessary of the overlapping dialogue in the group scenes, such as in the mess hall when Duke and Hawkeye arrive in camp. Then there were screwball bits like the Japanese recordings of popular American songs of the early ’50s from Radio Tokyo and the inane announcements on the camp P.A. system, an effect arrived at during editing, was carried through the picture and which reaches a dazzling apogee at the end, when the announcer nonchalantly informs us that, “Tonight’s movie has been… MASH” and introduces the actors over fast clips from their performances. (Please refrain when describing this to your friends from using the hack-word “meta.”) And while Altman did not write, nor reap the rewards of, the lyrics to the cleverly titled “Suicide is Painless,” the phrase was his, as were the song’s poker metaphors; the Painless Pole (John Schuck) runs a 24-hour poker game in his tent. The look of MASH was different too: Not merely Altman’s use of zooms or the pointed way he and Danford B. Greene edited the picture but the rich, grainy diffusion of the widescreen Panavision images arrived at by the director and his gifted cinematographer Harold E. Stine; the only comparably shot (and edited) contemporary American movie comedy I can think of is The Graduate of 1967. Stine had to be flexible, as when on the day of filming the “farewell dinner” for Painless his director got the idea to shoot it as a parody of Da Vinci’s Last Supper, complete unto Elliott Gould crooking his finger at John Schuck à la Judas Iscariot. Hornberger calls the stag party The Last Supper in his novel, and Lardner repeats the line in his screenplay, so the idea was there from the beginning. It just took Altman’s perverse visual genius to make it explicit.\n\nLardner, whose credit (and subsequent Oscar) as the picture’s screenwriter was pretty much the last nail in the coffin of Red Scare-era blacklisting, rightly objected to the needless slapstick at the beginning of the movie, when a supply sergeant gets into a physical altercation with a pair of MPs after Hawkeye drives off in one of his jeeps and wrongly to the football game, which he felt was too long and lent the wrong tone, as well as to Hawkeye (Donald Sutherland) and Duke (Tom Skerritt) taunting Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) by leading a group-sing of “Onward, Christian Soldiers.” (The pair sing it in his script, but others in the camp don’t pick up on it as they do in the movie.) As to the game, Hornberger spends an equivalent amount of time on it in his novel, and its antic spirit is a needed corrective to the alternative deluges of blood and boredom the surgeons are faced with, both in the book and in the movie. The scenarist was understandably upset when he finally saw a screening of the picture. I doubt he’d ever encountered anything like it, and the shock of seeing and hearing Altman’s revolutionary approach to the scenes and the dialogue must have been profound for a man who got his start writing movie scripts in the early 1940s. Lardner reevaluated MASH over time (his Academy Award surely helped there) and so presumably recognized that Altman did not alter the script so much as he and his cast enhanced and enlivened it. Despite his own narcissism, even Altman freely and repeatedly gave his screenwriter credit for the movie’s shape and form, and its success. Lardner cleverly fused the religious nut in Duke and Hawkeye’s tent in the book with Burns, for example, and the basic structure of the movie is his. Altman credited his writer as well with concocting the vicious but very funny sequence in which the Swampmen wire Hot Lips’ tent for sound and broadcast her assignation with Frank over the P.A. system. (Father Mulcahy: “Is this The Bickersons? I love them.”) On the other hand, I don’t know whether it was Altman or the actors who came up with the notion of Hawkeye and Trapper camping it up the morning after Frank and Hot Lips’ thwarted liaison, but it hasn’t aged well.\n\nThat isn’t the only example of dated “fag” humor in the picture. One area in which I fault Altman’s approach is the manner in which Painless reacts to his bout of temporary impotence in, respectively, the novel, the screenplay and the completed movie. Hornberger merely has Painless, a periodic depressive, listening to his prodigious appendage with Hawkeye’s stethoscope and announcing, “I think it’s dead.” Lardner has him assume that after an incident with a nurse in which he couldn’t achieve an erection he’s become “homosexual.” Altman and the movie’s Painless, John Schuck, up that ante (“Well… I’m a fairy”) which to their credit Hawkeye and the other doctors ridicule him for declaring on no evidence other than not being able to get it up a single time. This, in now-typical fashion, leads to current online ignoramuses writing that Painless “comes out as gay” to Hawkeye. Jesus, who breeds these idiots? And why?\n\nAside: Painless — or in any case, Schuck — is responsible in MASH for the first use of the word “fuck” in an American studio picture. Altman had instructed the actor to taunt his opponent on the football field and in a rehearsal ad lib Shuck barked, “All right, bub, your fuckin’ head is comin’ right off!” He had no idea Altman would use the take. Joan Tewkesbury, in the forward to her published Nashville screenplay, recalled the young 1970 audience exploding into cheers and applause when they heard that.¶\n\nThose who come to MASH only after years of watching the television series can quickly grow bemused or even confused that characters they knew during the show’s long lifetime (and even lengthier afterlife) are so different in the movie. As played by Alan Alda and initially written by Gelbart, Hawkeye Pierce in particular is warmer and less snide than in Donald Sutherland’s original performance. (Alda’s Hawkeye is also a bachelor.) Duke of course never made it to teevee, and Spearchucker lasted less than a season. Radar started out on the series more or less as he was in the picture — Gary Burghoff considered him “a sardonic little guy,” far from the naïve innocent he quickly evolved into on the show. And Lt. Colonel Henry Blake is vastly different from book and movie to series. Hornberger’s (and Lardner and Altman’s) Blake (Roger Bowen) is Regular Army, not a civilian doctor drafted into command as McLean Stevenson’s Henry was on television. While as sweet in his own confused way as his series doppelgänger (the gentle William Christopher) Father Mulcahy (René Auberjonois) is more bumbling in the movie where, with his ginger Irish hair he’s known as “Dago Red.” The character in the picture who is furthest from his teevee counterpart is Frank Burns; Duvall’s Burns is as sour, incompetent and self-righteous as Larry Linville’s on the show but not nearly as much of a ninny. And while Linville is a brilliant comic technician and, occasionally, less than despicable, there’s a deeply unpleasant quality to Duvall’s performance, and to the character as Lardner (and, earlier, Hornberger) envisioned him. Although, despite his loathsomeness and hypocrisy, Frank’s exit from the 4077th, strapped into a straight-jacket and escorted by MPs is, I would argue, not presented by Altman as intentionally humorous — Duvall, photographed behind the rising heat waves of a trash-barrel fire, appears utterly depressed and defeated and even Sutherland’s Hawkeye looks away — viewers whose responses to Burns are trained by years of Linville’s portrayal roar with laughter at the sight; it’s happened every time I’ve seen MASH with an audience, and I would very much like to know if moviegoers in 1970, well before the series took hold of the popular imagination, reacted the same way. Young audiences were so reflexively anti-establishment then that it’s certainly possible even if their current, older selves rush to defend lying hack politicians and government institutions and demand censorship when it doesn’t appear quickly enough to satisfy their well-honed sense of self-loathing. They’ve become Frank Burns.\n\nI don’t mean to suggest by my comments above that Sutherland is in any way a liability to the picture. In spite of his and his co-star’s discontent with Altman and attempts to get him replaced — for which Gould later apologized — the role of Hawkeye Pierce turned out to be a career-maker for Sutherland, who until then had been floating on the periphery of American movies. His persona as an actor tends to be dry and understated if not phlegmatic, entirely unlike Alan Alda’s, which sometimes makes him a bit of a chilly presence. Well, the Hawkeye Pierce of the novel isn’t the most ebullient character in the world either. Sutherland’s cool makes for a nice contrast with the warmer, scruffier appeal of Elliott Gould’s Trapper John and the half-cynical, half-perplexed Southern charm of Tom Skerritt’s Duke Forrest. Skerritt was even more of an unknown than Sutherland. (Gould was Ted in the 1969 Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice and had received an Academy Award nomination for his assured comic performance.) Tom Skerritt’s immense likability redeems a character who could have been a boor, especially in the early scenes where he is erotically aggressive to the exclusion of almost any other emotion and, later, a conventional Georgia bigot. Sally Kellerman’s Margaret Houlihan (called, curiously, “O’Houlihan” by both Roger Bowen and G. Wood’s General Hammond, but by no one else) is rigid and foolish but not silly, a complaint one could lodge against the TV version of her, at least in the early years, even as one was laughing at what Loretta Swit said and did. The movie’s “Hot Lips” becomes a bit silly, once her hard shell is softened, as when she leads cheers at the football match and seems utterly bewildered by the rules of the game. (Hot Lips: A red flag! We got a red flag! / Henry: It’s a penalty, you blithering idiots!)\n\nKellerman’s performance has very interesting curlicues, as when Trapper John is made Chief Surgeon and calls for sex, Lt. “Scorch” (Dawne Damon) is offered up to him and he points to Houlihan shouting, “No, no, no, that one — the sultry bitch with the fire in her eyes! Take her clothes off and bring her to me!” In Lardner’s script, “her eyes [are] blazing with indignation” but in the movie Kellerman’s flash with defiance… accompanied by a smirk of erotic interest. Kellerman’s Hot Lips takes the journey in under two hours that it took the producers of the TV “M*A*S*H” five seasons to achieve. By the end of the movie she’s not only relaxed, perhaps more than could reasonably have been expected, she’s succumbed to Duke’s charms; the look of panic she expresses with only her eyes at the news that he’s being discharged from the Army is remarkable, and gives the character a sudden and unexpected aura of emotional vulnerability. Her best scene, of course, is just after the shower revelation, when she demands that Henry court-martial the Swampmen (“This isn’t a hospital, it’s an insane asylum…”) Altman cannily had Kellerman do the scene directly after she’d gone through the shower sequence, when the actress’s emotions were still on edge and it’s among the pictures’ most indelible moments. I suspect it was this hysterical monologue, and the look of utter disbelief on her face when Henry dismisses her, that got Kellerman her Academy Award nomination.\n\nThe company Altman assembled for MASH in 1969 may well have been the best ensemble cast seen in an American comedy in three decades, or since His Girl Friday in 1940, and even there the range of characters was much smaller. I don’t think there have ever been as many “Introducing” credits in a movie before or since, and many of those actors went on to decades of success in movies, television and (in the case of René Auberjonois) theatre. Roger Bowen’s Henry Blake is not the lovable klutz played so memorably by McLean Stevenson; he’s Regular Army yet easily manipulated by the Swampmen and almost pathetically eager to speechify (“Ever since the dark days before Pearl Harbor I have proudly worn this uniform…”) Auberjonois’ Mulcahy is as well-meaning as William Christopher’s eventual teevee iteration but more tenuously connected to the world; he stumbles around in a gentle daze, equally fearful of giving offense to man and God. In the instantly infamous group revelation of Hot Lips Houlihan’s true hair color his first response is to shield Ho-Jon’s eyes, and he’s terrified of giving absolution to the would-be suicide Painless, even though he knows, as Painless doesn’t, that the whole thing is a charade. It was Auberjonois who discovered the blessing for a chariot and suggested he speak it over Duke and Hawkeye’s jeep at the end, sure that Altman would love it. (He did.)\n\nDavid Arkin is very funny as Blake’s ineffectual aid Vollmer, the unexpected hero of the football game, whom no one in camp respects or heeds and who is heard (along with Marvin Miller and, supposedly, Ted Knight) throughout the picture reading the absurdly gung-ho war-movie come-ons and administrative announcements over the P.A. system, some of which Altman altered from actual memos at Fox. For the series, Gelbart and Reynolds essentially conflated Vollmer and Radar and made him less officious, as Arkin is, than un-worldly. My only complaint about Altman’s otherwise nearly perfect casting has to do with Carl Gottlieb as the anesthesiologist “Ugly John.” This has nothing to do with Gottlieb’s performance but with what seems an almost deliberate misunderstanding of the character’s name. As Hornberger makes clear in the novel, “Ugly John” got his name from being the handsomest man at the 4077th. (At least Gottlieb is, while heavy, reasonably attractive. The casting of the undeniably homely John Orchard, who played the role during the first season of the television series, almost seems cruel by comparison.) Especially notable among the supporting ensemble are the charming Jo Ann Pflug as Lt. “Dish”; the strikingly beautiful Indus Arthur as Henry’s bed-mate Leslie; Ken Prymus singing “Suicide is Painless” during The Last Supper and grinning with the pleasure of performance even as the words he’s vocalizing are wholly to do with death; Fred Williamson, remarkably assured in his movie debut; the understated Michael Murphy as “Me Lay” Marston; Bud Cort as the gullible Private Boone; Dale Ishimoto, splendid as the doctor examining Ho-Jon at the Korean induction center; and the songwriter Bobby Troup as the beleaguered sergeant whose response to the golf-happy Hawkeye and Trapper John is to repeat the concise phrase, “Goddamn army.”\n\nI have written elsewhere that, while I am a militant anti-auteurist, at least as regards non-writer/directors, Robert Altman tends to be the exception to every one of my rules. I was disgusted the other day to stumble across one of those ridiculous internet polls on movies, this one listing Altman as “the 34th greatest director of all time.” I was too dispirited by this to look any further, but I’d be willing to bet that Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese both placed in the top ten, if not the top five. I’m not claiming that Altman deserves the ultimate slot — I don’t know who does, nor do I care especially — but if it isn’t John Ford or Orson Welles or Francis Coppola or Robert Altman, I also don’t know what greatness means any longer. Of all American sound film directors, only these four it seems to me were genuine poets, and seeing their best work not only alters the way one views movies, it alters the viewer.**\n\nNot that there is a great deal of poetry on display in MASH; its tone is too antic, and subversive. There’s nothing in it that rivals the image of Warren Beatty dying in the snow or Julie Christie’s faraway opium gaze at the end of McCabe and Mrs. Miller, or the women listening to Keith Carradine singing “I’m Easy” in Nashville, or the dreamlike imagery of 3 Women, or the haunting juxtaposition of the funeral rites that begin Vincent and Theo with, on the soundtrack, the multi-million dollar auction of Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” with its privileged fiscal obscenity, the figures rising ever higher as Vincent’s body is placed in a pauper’s grave. But if ever a filmmaker’s identifiable, idiosyncratic touch is evident from the opening frames of a movie, it’s here. Audiences in 1970 couldn’t have known of course that Robert Altman’s highly individualistic aural and visual aesthetic was, essentially, being unveiled in MASH, but two or three pictures later those elements were obvious and recurrent enough to be considered a personal style. Altman was amused at having become an adjective, and bemused by how often the term “Altmanesque” concerned externals only. But this is the way of such things. What people generally mean by that neologism is items like overlapping dialogue, slow camera zooms, an improvisatory approach (which does not mean letting actors improvise during a take) and ensemble acting. What isn’t considered as often is tone, and the filmmaker’s humanist concerns.\n\nGelbart always credited Altman with the look of the TV “M*A*S*H,” naturally achieved in miniature, and the series opening is essentially a paraphrase of the movie’s credit sequence, helicopters flying the wounded into the 4077th and the personnel on the ground scrambling to get these damaged bodies to Pre-Op. And if the hills and even the camp itself look uncannily like those of the movie it’s because the series was shot on the picture’s standing sets, and in the hills of what was then the Fox location ranch and is now the Malibu Creek State Park. (The exterior of the Swamp is clearly the same, right down to the Moorish hex symbol painted on the door, but Hawkeye’s gin still is original to the series.) Set designs aside, Altman’s sensibilities are all over MASH, mostly to the good. The innovative use of sound was a key part of his technical approach and I’ve always been taken with the way during Duke and Hawkeye’s discussion with Henry Blake about getting in a chest surgeon the filmmaker cuts to the men on duty in a very busy (and very bloody) Pre-Op while the dialogue continues on the soundtrack, the Swampmen’s point about being understaffed made explicit by the vivid juxtaposition of word and image. Or take the way during the eavesdropping on Frank Burns and Hot Lips the P.A. system attains a disturbing, echoey sound that matches the would-be lovers’ panic. Or how, when the generator fails and plunges the O.R. into blackness and nurses appear with flashlight torches, the doctors begin singing “When the Lights Go On Again (All Over the World.)” Altman’s Operating Room is not only bloodier than the O.R. of the television series, it’s noisier. When Hawkeye is amputating a leg, we hear the sound of the saw cutting through bone. When suction is applied by a nurse, that is heard as well.\n\nAltman was light on his feet throughout the filming, adapting to take advantage of happy accidents, such as the crashed helicopter in the background during the scene in which the doctors question whether Major Houlihan is a natural blonde. (A Fox pilot had crashed the ‘copter; he was unhurt.) In this Altman resembles Orson Welles, as indeed does his concern with sound. When Hawkeye and Trapper John return from golfing in Tokyo wearing plus fours and are immediately engulfed in wounded patients, the director films them at floor level from the calves up amid scrap buckets, blood and gore. (He claimed he wasn’t interested in filming the Tokyo sequence until he saw that image. Yet another load, if you’ll forgive me, of patented Altman bullshit. Why were they wearing those duds if they hadn’t gone golfing in Japan?) Occasionally an attempt at indirection is strained, as when Lt. Dish leaves for home, seemingly in a fury at having been conned by Hawkeye into sleeping with the well-endowed Painless Pole after his “suicide” until, airborne in a helicopter, she looks directly into the lens and grins delightedly.\n\nA much more effective feint is Duke’s homecoming fantasy when Hawkeye announces their orders have come through. It was, in imitation of the novel, in Lardner’s screenplay, but as a realistic scene. Making it purely imaginary is a marvelous touch, as is the improvement on Hornberger in the mess scene in which Hawkeye tells off Major Houlihan and she asks, to the world at large, “I wonder how a degenerated person like that could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps?” In the book, and in Lardner’s screenplay, the question is addressed to Hawkeye who replies, “Sister, if I knew the answer to that, I sure as hell wouldn’t be here.” How much richer, funnier and more satisfying, in the movie, is Father Mulcahy’s simple declaration, “He was drafted.” Curiously, it was not Lardner who gave Kellerman the line that forever connects Margaret Houlihan to her nickname (“Oh, Frank, my lips are hot! Kiss my hot lips!”) He did, however, go further in his script than Altman as far as vulgarity is concerned when, speculating on the color of Hot Lips’ pubic hair Duke opines that he prefers “blonde pussy.” But had there been heard in any movie before MASH the sound of women leading a cheer for a numbered football player (Tim Brown in this case) with the words, “69 is divine!”?\n\nMy cavils about the way Altman put MASH together are so few it almost feels churlish to mention them. The O.R. scene where Trapper John gives Houlihan a backhanded compliment (“Hot Lips, you may be a pain in the ass but you’re a damn good nurse”) and she murmurs, “Thanks, Trapper” precedes the shower scene but the change in her character feels like something that should occur much later in the movie, before the football game. That’s a continuity flaw; my other complaints concern content. When “Dago Red” asks how he enjoyed his visit to Tokyo Trapper’s response (“I screwed a Kabuki dancer”) is appalling. Mulcahy isn’t Frank Burns. Why insult the poor man that way? Similarly, there’s a terrible moment of Hawkeye and Trapper babbling in mock-Japanese on their arrival in Tokyo which, judging from the way what Sutherland and Gould say in voice-over in no way matches what the actors are speaking on film, was a deliberate after-thought by Altman. This from the man who constantly accused Richard Hornberger and Larry Gelbart of racism?\n\nAs an example of Robert Altman’s perversity, nothing concerning MASH exceeds the germination of what may be its most recognized element: Johnny Mandel’s theme, replicated in hundreds of television episodes and far and away the melody for which its versatile composer is best known. When he conceived the need for a song to send Painless off, Altman very cannily selected the theme (death), the central metaphor (poker) and a title that brought together the name of Schuck’s character with the notion of suicide. Yet he insisted that it ought to be “the stupidest song ever written,” for which his “idiot son” should write the lyrics. Mandel later said he had to get drunk to set Mike Altman’s lyrics which, even if do they revolve around an assonant near-rhyme (“Suicide is painless/It brings on many changes…”) are strikingly mature to have come from the mind and imagination of a 14-year old. Yet his father clearly wanted a deliberately bad song, with “stupid” music. Would anyone still be humming Mandel’s melody if Altman had gotten what he asked for?\n\nTo the director’s credit, he was impressed enough by the song to have it recorded for the main title sequence, where “Suicide is Painless” benefited enormously from the superb orchestrations by Herbert W. Spencer. Think of how softly it begins, with strummed acoustic guitar chords in B minor interspersed with finger cymbal chimes and eventual strings and percussion, wrapped around a Brian Wilson-style vocal. The song, and that particular arrangement of it, are so good it is astonishing to see what other movie songs in 1970 got the Oscar nomination Mandel and Mike Altman didn’t. I have no quarrel with “For All We Know” from Lovers and Other Strangers, the eventual winner, nor with the magnificent Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer song “Whistling Away the Dark” from Darling Lili, nor for that matter with Leslie Bricusse’s sardonic “Thank You Very Much” from Scrooge. But can anyone tell me why two numbers no one remembers (“Till Love Touches Your Life” from something called Madron, and “Pieces of Dreams,” from, as they used to say, the film of the same name) were doing on the list even if the latter was by Michel Legrand and Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman?\n\nMandel, one of the most original voices of his era, was not only a superb craftsman who could with equal invention assay pictures as disparate as The Americanization of Emily, The Sandpiper (for which he and Paul Francis Webster won Best Song for “The Shadow of Your Smile”), Harper, The Russians Are Coming The Russians Are Coming, Point Blank, Escape to Witch Mountain, The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea, Agatha and The Verdict; he was also an accomplished jazz performer and composed one of the few true jazz (as opposed to jazzy or jazz-inspired) movie scores, for I Want to Live! Although his MASH score is brief it includes the most felicitous of several military marches he composed for movies (it takes off neatly from Alfred Newman’s 20th Century-Fox fanfare), a hilariously sanctified accompaniment for Lt. Dish’s unveiling of the Painless Pole’s stupendous accoutrement, deliberately melodramatic underscore for the scene in Tokyo where Hawkeye and Trapper confront the MPs with a mock-serious invocation of spy movie clichés, and an amusing gallop for the football game, complete with slide-whistle. Good comedy scores that do not attempt to be humorous through lugubrious mickeymousing are rare. Genuinely witty ones are the unicorns of cinematic euphony.\n\nRather shockingly, while MASH received five Academy Award nominations including Picture and Director, it was not nominated for its highly distinctive — and, for its time, revolutionary — sound. And speaking of such things: I was astounded several years ago while leafing through the MusicHound soundtrack guide to note that the MASH soundtrack album was given the lowest rating (a “Woof!”) while the author of the brief review claimed that the LP was pointless and that one might listen to it once but not twice. I grant you that when I got my copy in 1974 and listened to the record incessantly I was a MASH-crazy 13-year-old (and home-video in the form of cassettes or laserdiscs did not yet exist for most Americans.) But as a keepsake of the movie, I don’t see how the Columbia producer Thomas Z. Shepard’s calculatedly messy album could be bettered. Shepard, who for years afterward was Sondheim’s indispensable cast album producer, understood instinctively what Altman had wrought, and replicated it as a listening experience. The dialogue excerpts were not only well chosen, they were edited brilliantly, even dazzlingly, into the whole, creating a small masterpiece of comedic collage. If nothing else Shepard isolated some key lines in the football sequence in a way I wish Altman had — so they can actually be heard.\n\nText copyright 2002 by Scott Ross\n\n*The picture, like the book on which it was based, was called MASH, not M*A*S*H. It’s MASH in the opening credits; the asterisks were added to the poster art, the subsequent paperback reissues of the source novel, the 1970 soundtrack LP and of course the television series.\n\n†Hornberger was also listed as the co-author of a dozen M*A*S*H Goes to… novels in the mid-to-late-1970s but these books, commissioned to cash in on the roaring success of the television series, were written entirely by William E. Butterworth. (His own titles were the 1971 M*A*S*H Goes to Maine and the 1977 M*A*S*H Mania.) Hornberger was infuriated when the movie took off because he’d sold his rights for a mere few thousand dollars — in that he certainly resembled Robert Altman — so in addition to the millions of Pocket Books paperback reissue copies that continued to sell well into the ’80s these “sequel” novels, even if he didn’t write a word of them, were a good means to fast cash for him as the copyright holder.\n\n‡Ho-Jon’s arrival at the 4077th as a war casualty was part of a subplot cut from MASH before its release. Supposedly his dead body was originally removed during the football game sequence, and while one appreciates the filmmakers’ juxtaposition of high-powered leisure activity with grim reality, the moment would surely have destroyed the comedy of the ball game and brought down the entire picture. (Lardner’s screenplay contains a sad, ambiguous moment when a recurrence of his wound is deemed inoperable, but not the boy’s subsequent death.) Interestingly, the North Korean soldier on the operating table is not Kim Atwood, but Atwood is clearly who is subsequently being operated on. It seems obvious that Altman and his editors were forced to splice two separate sequences together for the sake of continuity, but considering the director’s wanton attributions of racism to Hooker, Gelbart and everyone else, there is a whiff of “they all look alike” in the confusion of the North Korean and the former Swamp houseboy. Parenthetically, “Ho-Jon” is allegedly not a Korean name.\n\n§The hats worn by what the U.S. military is pleased to call “indigenous personnel” during the Seoul sequence are deliberately incorrect, as Altman insisted they be Vietnamese and not Korean, even though Hawkeye jokingly says the boy should go to the head of the line because he’s one of Korean president Syngman Rhee’s sons and all radio news stories heard on the soundtrack are datelined Korea. So much, once again, for Robert Altman’s claims. That scroll, which includes one of Dwight D. Eisenhower’s more famous election pledges, reminds me of something Gore Vidal once said of him: “Eisenhower always read his campaign speeches with a real sense of discovery. ‘And if elected… I will go to Korea?!?‘”\n\n¶Being too young to have seen MASH in a theater I had to make do with the autumn 1974 “CBS Friday Night Movies” airing of it which was of course heavily censored. Given the soundtrack album for Christmas, when I heard Schuck say that line the top of my 13-going-on-14-year old’s head nearly came off. I finally got to see the picture on a big screen a year or so later and was bitterly disappointed that it had been re-cut for a “PG” rating, the word “fuckin'” dropped out on the soundtrack (and the Hot Lips shower scene truncated, as well as some of the OR gore). It wasn’t that I had a prurient interest in hearing “fuck” in a movie — this was the ’70s after all and the “R”-rated American pictures I was getting in to see then were becoming routinely more profane, as was the popular fiction I was then reading — but I did want to see my movies, if I was experiencing them in a theater rather than on a TV set, unadulterated. I saw the picture subsequently several times in this bowdlerized fashion, in theaters and on cable, before Fox finally released the original, un-tampered-with MASH on home video. Similarly, when the picture was re-released in 1973 (along with the reissue of the 1970 soundtrack LP I was given in ’74) someone removed the “Suicide is Painless” vocal from the main title of both movie and record and replaced it with Ahmad Jamal’s funky (and identically-timed) instrumental. Fortunately, the vocal was eventually reinstated in the picture. An eventual CD release of the soundtrack includes both.\n\n**Note that I said both “sound” and “American.” The poets of silent film range from D.W. Griffith and King Vidor to Buster Keaton and his collaborators, and there is no shortage of great, poetic filmmakers, sound and silent, in world cinema.\n\nPost-Script, January 2023\n\nAnent my comments above, in the footnote section, on the M*A*S*H Goes to… novels of the 1970s attributed to William E. Butterworth and Richard Hooker: I attempted over the holidays to re-read them for the first time since the age of 14 or 15, and had to give it up as a bad job after two and a half titles, leaving nine-and-a-half unread. If Hooker wrote any of the material in them, the only trace of his style (and medical expertise) I can find in the books are the occasional passages involving surgical procedure. What Butterworth, their apparent actual author, is chiefly concerned with is depicting convoluted and determinedly “wacky” scenarios involving versions of Hawkeye, Trapper John and “Hot Lips” Houlihan that bear little relation to their previous literary counterparts (and none at all to their television versions) with a growing, and increasingly annoying, supporting cast including an obnoxious Russian-American opera singer, two bumbling New Orleans-based reporters, a sexually suspect diplomat, a gaggle of alcoholic (and extremely unfunny) Cajuns and — God help us — a largely benign, German-inflected, Yiddish-prone American Secretary of State who can only be a comic rendition of that Teutonic psychopath Henry Kissinger. Even worse (if such can be imaged) the social and “comedic” attitudes exhibited by Butterworth, a genuine hack who under the pen-name W.E.B. Griffin published nearly 60 military-themed thrillers, are stuck in some weird, reactionary world where women are either brainless sex-pots, alternately cooing and screeching, or suspicious sitcom-like hausfraus, militant man-hating “libbers” and/or “radical” lefties, while gay men are “exquisitely mannered,” wispy little queens or sex-mad, prissy faggots. Butterworth’s moving of the action in these books to the 1970s also makes hay of the characters’ original ages; “Hot Lips,” for example, is described by Hooker/Hornberger in MASH as being “fortyish,” making her, if you care to extrapolate, “sixtyish” in the books although still depicted as a hot, stacked number lusted after by many. At the beginning of the second book (M*A*S*H Goes to Paris) Hawkeye and his wife Mary are expecting another child, although both would be, in Hooker’s chronology, in their 50s. One almost gets the idea, reading these novels, that time has in some weird way frozen since 1951, although Henry Blake shows up periodically as a Major-General. Based on the first three titles, the series is about as ugly a betrayal of the affections of M*A*S*H aficionados as can be imagined. Butterworth even renames Walter “Radar” O’Reilly “Robespierre,” and Hooker lets him get away with it. Robespierre O’Reilly?!?\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAlthough I am still in something of a state of disbelief over the deaths, in 2018, of Harlan Ellison and William Goldman who, although neither had published much of anything new in decades, remain among the American writers highest in my personal Pantheon, this past year — as is increasingly the case as one ages — saw the passing of several touchstones: Two of my favorite writers, who could not have been further apart except in general excellence (Toni Morrison, John Simon); a novelist (Patricia Nell Warrren) whose popular work from my nascent gay adolescence meant more to me at that time than almost any other’s; an actor (Albert Finney) and a comedian (Tim Conway) I cherished; a cartoonist of genius (Howard Cruse) whose unabashedly gay milieu helped limn the contours of my young manhood; four musical figures whose recordings — two known to me from childhood (André Previn, Doris Day), one from puberty (Michel Legrand) and the last from my hot youth (Leon Redbone) — remain unimpeachable favorites of my adulthood; and a giant of the theatre (Harold Prince) whose approach to staging musical plays was vastly influential in the culture at large, and to the way I wrote my own plays. These are the ones that hurt the most, but there was, as there always is, plenty of only slightly lesser tristesse to go around in 2019.\n\nI. Actors\n\nCarol Channing, 97. It was common when I was young to hear people lamenting that Channing didn’t get to play Dolly Gallagher Levi in in the movie of her most famous stage musical. Had those people seen Thoroughly Modern Millie? (Had the Academy, which gave her a Best Supporting Actress nomination for it?) With her popping eyes, elaborate wigs, wide mouth, facial tics, grand gestures, deliberate baritone (sometimes bass) singing voice, and teasing, outsized persona, Channing’s affect was less feminine than that of a drag queen with a uterus. On stage, as Dolly, she probably seemed ingenious; in her few screen roles and with the camera capturing each grimace and moue and the mike picking up every nuance of her kewpie-doll gushing Channing was, like Ethel Merman (another absurdly outré performer these same ignoramuses used perpetually to cite as “wasted by the movies”) a freak, lacking only the appurtenances of the side-show. With her character in it limited to dialogue only (or better still, re-cast) and with no elaborate musical numbers to show her off her freak attributes, Millie might have emerged as a minor comedy classic rather than the pleasant but overblown (and, because overlong, tiring) exercise it became.*\n\nKaye Ballard, 93. Ballard (née Catherine Gloria Balotta) was another Broadway freak, with a huge voice, a good range, and, in comedy, an arch performing style perhaps best suited to TV farce like “The Doris Day Show” and “The Mothers-in-Law,” where she played her excited volubility against Eve Arden’s dry acerbity (although the plots were strictly from “I Love Lucy.”) Yet her appeal was considerable — she was more human than Channing — and when she got her teeth into a great, sultry ballad like the Jerome Moross / John La Touche “Lazy Afternoon” in The Golden Apple, she could be incandescent, even hair-raising. Her tandem act with the treasurable Alice Ghostly in the original, Julie Andrews-starred 1957 Cinderella, in which the pair sang the knowing “Stepsisters’ Lament” duet, remains indelible. Another splendid Ballard recording: “There’s Always a Woman”, a bitch-fest cut from Anyone Can Whistle which Ballard performed with the great Sally Mayes on the Unsung Sondheim album. The way she rolls the word “delicious” off her spiteful tongue is a vest-pocket tutorial in how to get the absolute, zesty most out of a tiny line reading.\n\nWas Ballard a Lesbian? To quote Robert Preston in S.O.B., “Is Batman a transvestite? Who knows?”\n\nJulie Adams, 92. Adams was fine in a very good 1953 James Stewart Western, Bend of the River, but, cultural memory being what it is, will likely be remembered longest for being menaced, in a white one-piece, by the Creature from the Black Lagoon.\n\nAlbert Finney, 82. Although he walked away from Lawrence of Arabia before it began, Finney triumphed as Henry Fielding’s Tom Jones in the hilariously earthy 1963 adaptation by John Osborne and directed by Tony Richardson; the famous “eating scene” between Finney and Joyce Redman is still among the most paralyzingly funny sequences in post-war movies. As adept at comedy as he was at drama, Finney was also as devoted to the stage as to film, ever returning to Shakespeare, Chekhov and Feydeau, his true métier. He could be subtle or hammy, as required, and his conviction was total; even in the veriest trash he is never less than watchable. Among his best movie performances: Opposite Audrey Hepburn in the time-shattering Stanley Donen/Frederic Raphael dramatic comedy Two for the Road (1967); a delicious Ebenezer in Scrooge (1970); unrecognizable as Hercule Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express (1974); the conflicted, and increasingly frightened, police detective of Wolfen (1981); the agonizingly obsessive husband in Shoot the Moon (1982); the Donald Wolfit-inspired “Sir” in The Dresser (1983); the doomed, alcoholic British consul in Under the Volcano (1984); the unsinkable Irish mobster in Miller’s Crossing (1990); as Crocker-Harris in Terence Rattigan’s The Browning Version (1994); the paterfamilias of Sidney Lumet’s astonishing final feature, Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead (2007); and, movingly, the unbowed ancient caretaker of Skyfall (2012). In 1975, he performed an amusing cameo in Gene Wilder’s spoof The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes’ Smarter Brother. It’s difficult for me, who grew up watching him, and who cherished his presence, to imagine to a world without an Albert Finney in it.\n\nJan-Michael Vincent. 73. Once both disarmingly attractive, and charmingly amiable (“Danger Island” on “The Banana Splits Show,” The World’s Greatest Athlete, Bite the Bullet, Big Wednesday), later a victim of alcoholism and diabetes, Vincent ended up a bitter, angry and staggeringly homophobic single amputee. A sad ending to a once-promising career.\n\nBeverley Owen, 81. The original Marilyn on “The Munsters,” for them as cares. Which I don’t. Why did I post this? Because I care about you…\n\nKatherine Helmond, 89. When she played the perpetually confused Jessica Tate on “Soap,” one puzzled stare into the camera by this woman, perfectly timed, was enough to put me on the floor. She had her best movie role as Jonathan Pryce’s cosmetically-obsessed mother in Terry Gilliam’s Brazil (1985). Gilliam’s depiction was prescient; we’ve since witnessed 35 years’ worth of women, and men, whose every gaze into a mirror must include a profoundly disorienting lack of immediate recognition.\n\nDenise Nickerson, 62. Remembered by moviegoers of my generation as the obnoxious Violet in the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nSeymour Cassel, 84. Active largely in American independent movies, especially for John Cassavetes (Too Late Blues, Faces, Minnie and Moskowitz, The Killing of a Chinese Bookie, Opening Night and Love Streams) he also had roles in more mainstream pictures such as Coogan’s Bluff (1968), The Last Tycoon (1976), Valentino (1977), Convoy (1978), Dick Tracy (1990), Honeymoon in Vegas (1992) and Indecent Proposal (1993).\n\nGeorgia Engel, 70. With her slightly breathless, baby-doll voice, zany logic and sweetly expressed forthrightness Engel, a late addition to the cast, was an endearing Georgette on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” (and, later, Ray Romano’s mother-in-law on “Everybody Loves Raymond.”)\n\nPeter Mayhew, 74. Mayhew was the man beneath the mask and the shaggy, bandoliered body as Chewbacca in five Star Wars pictures and, like so many giants (he had Marfan syndrome), a gentle soul.\n\nBarbara Perry, 97. A reliable character actor known for her series performances (“The Andy Griffith Show,” “My Three Sons,” “Bewitched”) Perry earned her minor immortality in the Ross household as the first Pickles Sorrell on “The Dick Van Dyke Show.”\n\nPeggy Lipton, 72. I’ve never been happy my friend Michael Dorfman committed suicide, but I’m slightly relieved he’ll never have to hear of the death of his first big TV crush.\n\nTim Conway, 85. “The Carol Burnett Show” didn’t really need Tim Conway; it was funny enough already, and a much more devastating blow than Conway’s never being on it would have been the loss of Harvey Korman (as time eventually proved) or even Vicki Lawrence. But Conway, in his recurring guest appearances, gave the series some of its funniest, and most memorable moments… particularly when the rest of the cast was reacting to him on-camera. What most civilians didn’t know (a friend and fellow young actor complained to me when we were both 12 that the people on the Burnett show were “unprofessional”!) was that Conway, like Nancy Walker, merely walked through rehearsals; what we were seeing on the air the cast was also seeing for the first time. And while his actions were certainly devious, and perhaps a little sadistic, the break-ups became part of the shtick of the show. My father used to relish the way Conway broke Korman up, and he wasn’t alone; their double-act became one the classic running-gags of 1970s American television. In addition to his Oldest Man character, which he’d performed in his nightclub act with Ernie Anderson Conway also contributed to the show his phlegmatic Swedish businessman Mr. Tudball (a character he created), forever battling Burnett as his inept secretary Mrs. “A-Whiggins” and once, in the soap spoof “As the Stomach Turns,” had a memorable slow-motion fall down a staircase. (Conway always knew exactly how, and where, to put the button on any physical gag.) He also, infamously, got broken up himself by Lawrence during one of his elongated, un-scripted interpolations, an agonizingly pointless anecdote about a “Siamese elephant.” As with Jonathan Winters, whom in his improvisational genius Conway in some ways resembled, his gifts were never fully employed, or appreciated, in his movie work, although he developed a third double-act on-screen, this time with Don Knotts. Those pictures are variable, but Conway’s work on the Burnett show is evergreen and, quite literally, peerless. There was no one like him.\n\nSylvia Miles, 94. Brash personality more than actor, Miles was a hard-edged Sally Rogers in the Carl Reiner pilot “Head of the Family,” which eventually became (with, blessedly, Rose Marie in the role) “The Dick Van Dyke Show.” She won the first of her two Oscar nominations as a kept woman who ends up taking not sex but money from Jon Voight’s Joe Buck in Midnight Cowboy (1969) and her second for her boozy, blowsy loser in Farewell, My Lovely (1975). Miles famously dropped a salad into the lap of the critic John Simon, a comestible that grew to become all manner of hefty dishes in her retelling. Miles also starred, with Joe Dallesandro, in Andy Warhol’s 1972 Sunset Boulevard spoof Heat. Didn’t Warhol get that Sunset Boulveard was a black comedy to begin with?\n\nMax Wright, 75. An idiosyncratic and often very funny character actor (Reds, Simon, All That Jazz) Wright found his greatest fame in the aggressively stupid alien-puppet situation comedy “ALF,” and is now associated solely with tabloid sleaze-stories about his addictions and sexual encounters with homeless men. Sigh.\n\nArte Johnson, 90. Remembered almost solely for his run on “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In,” where he introduced such indelible characters as a German soldier who seems not to have noticed that the War had ended years earlier (“Verrry interesting…”) and Tyrone F. Horneigh (pronounced, in a sop to the era’s network standards and practices, as “Horn-eye”), the degenerate old man who plunked himself down on the park bench occupied by his unwilling inamorata Gladys Ormphby (Ruth Buzzi), rasped indecent nothings to her, and was rewarded by a smack with her handbag, eventually toppling off the bench while intoning some dopey “punch”-line. It was a predictable, one-joke running-gag… and, especially if you were an 8-or 9-year old as I was, a very funny one; the only “Laugh-In” character I imitated as often as Lily Tomlin’s Ernestine was Johnson’s Tyrone.\n\nFreddie Jones, 91. Onstage Jones was the originator of “Sir” in Ronald Harwood’s play The Dresser, and while he appeared in movies as divergent as Marat/Sade and Far from the Madding Crowd (both 1967), The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom (1968), Harry Nilsson’s Son of Dracula (1973), Juggernaut (1974), the delightful John Cleese/Chekhov short film Romance with a Double Bass (1975), Ladies in Lavender (2004) and seemingly countless British films and television series, he stays most vivid in the theatre of my mind as the abusive, terrifying ringmaster of the 1980 The Elephant Man.\n\nBill Macy, 97. God finally got you for that, Walter.\n\nRip Torn, 88. Famously widowed by Geraldine Page (the bell on their New York apartment read “Torn Page”) and older cousin to Sissy Spacek, Torn once attacked Norman Mailer with a hammer (well, which of us at one time or another wouldn’t have liked to?), allegedly pulled a knife on Dennis Hopper (again, who didn’t want to?) and was a notable drunk. And while he appeared in prominent or supporting roles in movies such as Sweet Bird of Youth (1962), You’re a Big Boy Now (1966), Tropic of Cancer (1969, as Henry Miller), The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976), Nasty Habits (1977), Coma (1978), The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1969), Cross Creek (1983, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award), Men in Black (1997) and Wonder Boys (2000) he was infinitely less interesting an actor than his wife and cousin. Machismo is a fucking bore.\n\nDavid Hedison, 92. Immortal in some circles as The Fly (1958), Hedison was the most congenial of Felix Leiters, twice: Live and Let Die in 1973 and License to Kill (1989) in which he first married, then suffered the fate Ian Fleming devised for the character in the novel Live and Let Die. (“He disagreed with something that ate him.”)\n\nRussi Taylor, 75. The curse of having the longest-running animated series in television history is that over time your voice actors tend to die. Taylor was a “Simpsons” stalwart from the beginning, providing the voices for the twins Sherri and Terri, the German exchange student Üter and the conniving nerd Martin Prince.\n\nPeter Fonda, 79. The less-talented of Henry’s children, Peter enjoyed his greatest success with the appallingly overrated Easy Rider in 1969, in which, as co-scenarist and co-star of this annoying, pretentious, self-indulgent mess, he bore much responsibility for the subsequent inundation of numbingly bad “youthquake” movies that washed up on shore in its wake. Considering the profoundly dysfunctional family from which he sprang, I am unsurprised to have discovered that Fonda, enraged at President Trump’s immigration policies (very little different from Obama’s) Tweeted that, “We should rip Barron Trump from the arms of First Lady Melania Trump and put him in a cage with pedophiles.” (He also “suggested that Americans should seek out names of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in order to protest outside of their homes and the schools of their children.” — Lisa Gutierrez, The Kansas City Star) Thus was Fonda a typical liberal, trumpeting his concern for others while wishing harassment and rape on minors. Imagine his outrage had anyone suggested such things about the Obama daughters, or the children of Obama’s officials. But then, I guess the children of prominent figures are only off-limits if their parents are perceived as liberals. On the subject of Millennials voting, to parents concerned their children might cast a vote for Trump, Fonda’s advice was to “take their early ballots, fill them out [emphasis mine] and mail them in, or take the ballot to the voting place and give it to the officials… no more worrying!” I think we can easily imagine his reaction had his father suggested such a thing in, say, 1968. But as I’ve often said (and tire of having to say): Scratch a liberal, find a fascist. (Thanks to Eliot M. Camarena for Fonda’s Tweet advocating paternal voter-fraud.)\n\nAnna Quayle, 86. Warmly recalled by musical aficionados for her Tony award-winning performance in the Newley/Bricusse Stop the World — I Want to Get Off, Quayle was also the women with whom John Lennon has a funny dalliance on the stairs in A Hard Day’s Night (1964), the child-hating Baroness in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) and the maid of Sigmund Freud in The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976).\n\nValerie Harper, 80. Adults of (ahem!) a certain age will vividly recall their first glimpse of Harper as Rhoda Morgenstern, washing the windows of the Minneapolis apartment she thought was going to be hers on the first episode of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” in 1970 and memorably sparring for the next seven years with Cloris Leachman’s Phyllis Lindstrom. Her subsequent spin-off, “Rhoda” made her, arguably, the most famous Jew on television, but Harper was a Gentile. (So — and please brace yourself — was Nancy Walker.) Although “Rhoda” was never as good, or as respected, as the show that spawned it, it was sometimes gut-bustingly funny (it helped if you relished Jewish humor, which I did, and do) and Rhoda’s wedding was the highest-rated television episode of the ‘70s before “Roots.”\n\nCarol Lynley, 77. Lynley, who was strikingly pretty, had a tendency to extreme emotionality (Bunny Lake Is Missing, The Poseidon Adventure) but in the right role (as Darren McGavin’s grounded girlfriend in the 1972 television movie “The Night Stalker” for example) she could be quite engaging.\n\nPhyllis Newman, 86. Newman won a Tony for her comedic role in the Jule Styne/ Betty Comden and Adolph Green musical Subways Are for Sleeping, a spread in Life magazine, and Green’s undying love. (They married soon after and were together until his death.) Newman’s character appeared in a nothing but a towel the entire evening, and her 4-minute solo “I Was a Shoo-In” was a comic goldmine. I also cherish the way she introduced “Who’s That Woman?” in the 1986 concert version of Follies; when Newman says, “If I do this number… we all do this number!” there can be no argument.\n\nDiahann Carroll, 84.\n\nThe first black performer to win a Tony for Best Actress (Richard Rodgers’ No Strings, 1962) Carroll was also in the movies of Carmen Jones (1954) and Porgy and Bess (1959) and had the lead in the Broadway musical House of Flowers whose rich Harold Arlen/Truman Capote score included the exquisite ballad “A Sleepin’ Bee.” From 1968-1973 she was the young widowed mother “Julia” for NBC, often cited as the first non-stereotyped black woman on television. (Although Carroll herself said Julia was “the white Negro.”) But it was a sweet series, often poignant and sometimes very funny, as in this telephone exchange between Julia and her new employer (Lloyd Nolan as what Harlan Ellison would have called “a crusty-but-lovable doctor”), with whom she has been placed by an agency:\n\nJulia: Did they tell you I’m colored?\n\nDr. Chegley: What color are you?\n\nJulia: Why, I’m Negro.\n\nDr. Chegley: Have you always been a Negro, or are you just trying to be fashionable?\n\nRip Taylor, 88. Two Rips loosed in one year! Taylor’s shtick — the toupee, the flamboyant (read, “screaming queen”) persona, the confetti — was so over the top you either roared, or rolled your eyes and switched channels. I often roared.\n\nMichael J. Pollard, 80. From Bye Bye Birdie on stage to Bonnie and Clyde on screen is quite a leap, and while Pollard lacked the physical attributes ever to become a star, he was always engaging, even when, as in Bonnie, he was practically a moron. (While Beatty infamously vetoed the ménage David Newman and Robert Benton wrote into their Bonnie script, which would have involved Pollard, had his objection been aesthetic rather than cowardly I wouldn’t have blamed him.) Pollard later had a charming role in Steve Martin’s 1987 Roxanne and an unexpectedly moving one in Scrooged (1988).\n\nJoan Staley, 79. A model and an actor, Staley will always occupy a warm chamber of my heart for her delightful performance opposite Don Knotts in The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.\n\nPhilip McKeon. 55. McKeon replaced Alfred Lutter after the pilot as the son in television’s “Alice”, weirdly spun from the far superior movie Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore. I include him largely because he was never spoken of as being involved with a woman and also never declared himself one way or another, for which some smug fool on Pinterest praised him for “keeping [his private life] where it belongs.” Hey, buddy — would you still say that had McKeon posed for photos with a wife and children?\n\nRon Leibman, 82. Leibman was the very definition of a working actor in America. He divided his time between stage, movies and television, racking up an array of marvelous, buoyant performances in each: The Hot Rock (1972), superb as the union organizer Reuben in Norma Rae (1979), breaking his wrist while making a typically vehement point as the D.A. in Night Falls on Manhattan (1996); racking up an Emmy in the title role of the short-lived Kaz (1978-79); playing Kilroy in Tennessee Williams’ Camino Real in 1959 and appearing in productions of A View from the Bridge, Dead End, The Deputy, Uncle Vanya (as Astrov), Beckett’s End Game (as Clov), Volpone, The Three Sisters, We Bombed in New Haven, Richard III (as Richard), I Ought to Be in Pictures, Tartuffe (in the title role, naturally), Neil Simon’s Rumors, Tony Kushner’s Angels in America: Millennium Approaches (as Roy Cohn, a performance that yielded him a Tony), Angels in America: Perestroika, The Merchant of Venice (as Shylock) and Kushner’s version of A Dybbuk. His zest for acting was obvious, and infectious, and only once (in the 1974 The Super Cops) have I seen him give a bad performance. But since the picture itself was conceived and executed as a cartoon, Leibman’s overacting was of a piece with the rest.\n\nRené Auberjonois, 79. A year before his sweetly ineffectual Father Francis “Dago Red” Mulcahy in MASH, Auberjonois was camping up a storm on Broadway as Katharine Hepburn’s gay rival Sebastian in the Alan Jay Lerner/Andre Previn Coco, singing the vicious satirical tango “Fiasco” and winning a Tony in the process. He went on to perform in three additional pictures for Robert Altman: 1970’s Brewster McCloud, in which he played a lecturer who slowly evolves into a giant bird, the glorious McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971) and Images (1972). He did more television than movies (“Benson,” “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine“) and I also remember him as a robust swashbuckler in a 1976 TV movie called Panache, which, being an inveterate fan of Cryano de Bergerac and Richard Lester’s Three Musketeers movies, I had to watch. On Broadway he was Malvolio in Twelfth Night (1972), The Good Doctor, Neil Simon’s 1973 adaptation of several short Chekhov plays; the Duke in Roger Miller’s Huckleberry Finn musical Big River (1984), the 2004 revival of Larry Gelbart’s Sly Fox and, in the Cy Coleman musical City of Angels (1989) had a veritable field day with Gelbart’s trademark mixed metaphors and David Zippel’s too-clever-by-half lyrics. In 1987 Auberjonois gave perfect voice to the rapacious, Inspector Clouseau-like French chef in The Little Mermaid (1987), gleefully singing, in the best Folies Bergère style, Howard Ashman’s delicious lyric “Les Poissons.”\n\nCarol Spinney. 85. The once and future Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch.\n\nDanny Aiello, 86. Aiello’s stardom, such as it was and for as long as it lasted, came late: He was for years a union rep for bus workers, and a bouncer at The Improv, before being cast in Bang the Drum Slowly (1973) and as Tony Rosato in The Godfather Part II (1974), in which he ad-libbed the line, “Michael Corleone says hello!” during the failed hit on Michael V. Gazzo’s Frank Pentangeli. He was a frightening racist cop in the excellent Fort Apache — The Bronx (1981), Mia Farrow’s abusive husband in The Purple Rose of Cairo (1085) and Cher’s hapless, mother-ridden fiancée in Moonstruck (1987). His best work on film, and his most prominent role, was as the pizzeria owner Sal in Spike Lee’s literally incendiary Do the Right Thing (1989). An essentially decent man, Sal is too hidebound to budge even slightly. It’s his pizza shop; why should he accommodate his black patrons… even though they’re pretty much the only ones he has? Sal’s tragedy is that he could have easily prevented the conflagration that explodes in the movie’s gripping last act, but didn’t know how to integrate his Italian pride with a responsibility to the neighborhood in which he makes his living.\n\nSue (née Suellyn) Lyon, 73. Lyons became an overnight pop icon in 1962 as Lolita in the Stanley Kubrick adaptation of Nabokov’s book, itself wildly controversial when it was published in 1955. Lyon’s casting was, one presumes, a compromise: Too advanced in age and too developed physically at 14 to really represent the 12-year old “Lo” of the novel (she looked at least 16, and yes, those two year jumps matter) Lyons took some of the heat off the filkmmakers — but she also turned in an exceptional performance opposite James Mason’s peerless Humbert Humbert. Two years later she was the lubricious teenager in love with Richard Burton’s defrocked minister in the superb John Huston movie of Tennessee Williams’ The Night of the Iguana in which among other things she had a strange, wonderful scene, suggested by Williams, in which the pair walk on broken glass in their bare feet. She was very good as a missionary in China in John Ford’s final picture, the underrated 7 Women (1966) and had leading roles in The Flim-Flam Man and Tony Rome in 1967. Aside from her beauty, which was obvious, she brought a sharp intelligence to everything she did. Whenever I see Carol Lynley in a movie I mentally re-cast her role with Lyons; it improves whatever I’m watching by at least 25 per cent. Lyons’ final acting role was in 1980. Her loss was the audience’s as well.\n\nII. Theatre\n\nHarold Prince, 91. The last of the great, visionary super-dirctors of the American musical theatre, the man who put together such shows as Cabaret, Company and Follies the way a great playwright does.\n\nBetty Corwin, 98. Corwin’s was not a name known outside New York, or theatre and library circles (or New York theatre and library circles) but anyone who cares about plays and musicals should give her a tip of the hat. It was her idea to create archival video records of the offerings on and Off-Broadway, and to house them in a special collection (Theatre Film and Tape Archive) at the New York Library for the Performing Arts. And while these are obviously not the flashier, and more professional, two-and-three camera affairs later developed for PBS programs such as Theatre in America (remember when PBS actually cared about theatre? Remember when PBS cared about anything other than money?) they are a treasure-house nonetheless. How else would you be able to see a video tape of the original Follies, or A Chorus Line? Bless you, Betty.\n\nSir Jonathan Miller, 85. Hearing that anyone has dementia or has died of Alzheimer’s is depressing, but especially so when the person in question has lived a life of the mind. Miller was such a polymath his theatrical career is almost the least of his interests, and achievements. Miller began as a member of Beyond the Fringe, all of whom became important figures in theatre and movies and British comedy, particularly the actor/playwright Alan Bennett. He was also a physician, a theatrical director (the agonizing Merchant of Venice with Olivier was his) and an author. For 40 years I have treasured his Fringe monologue “The Heat Death of the Universe” with its immortal last line: Turn your face to the wall, my darling, while the gentlemen… trot by.\n\n* Channing could also be a beast. I strongly suspect what she put Mary Martin and James Kirkwood through during rehearsals and road-tour for the latter’s comedy Legends! hastened his death by heart attack two years later. (And that’s not to mention Martin’s increasing deafness or her justifiable fury at her character’s monologue about breast cancer being cut by the producer, which caused her to back out of an eventual Broadway production, killing the show’s chances. See Kirkwood’s Diary of a Mad Playwright: Perilous Adventures on the Road with Mary Martin and Carol Channing.)\n\nText copyright 2019 by Scott Ross"
