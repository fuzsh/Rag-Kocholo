        "text": "Link to today’s strip.\n\nThere are a lot of folks nowadays who despair over the state of the world. Folks who are religious tell us that, although things may seem bad, God is a kind and loving father who watches over us all, and offers hope to mankind with the promise of ultimate goodness. I guess my question is then, if God loves us all, why did He allow panel two to come into being? It seems to me that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for a lot less than a Les Moore crotch shot. In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, unless that man reads Funky Winkerbean. Suddenly, having an eye is the worst thing ever. If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out! Or, you know, burn the newspaper.\n\nPerhaps this is God’s way of telling us that we’d better shape up, because the horrors of Hell are far more horrible than we are capable of imagining. In other words…things can get worse than panel two.\n\nOkay, I’m scaring myself now. So, on a strip level, I hate to say it, but this seems more evidence that Tom Batiuk is well aware that his audience is composed entirely of critics, and this drawing of Les is his “Up yours!” to them. I guess my initial response would be “Grow up.” Tom Batiuk is not without talent. Why doesn’t he use it? If this is the case, I just find it very, very sad.\n\nSo let’s have some fun with it. Let’s make it a happy thing. Let’s turn that money shot into a funny spot. (Sorry.)\n\nRecommended soundtrack: open a new browser tab, load this, and put it in the background. Suddenly Les Moore is magic!"
