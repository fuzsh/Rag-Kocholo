        "text": "Tag: Screenwriting\n\nWriting\n\nThree Categories of Screenwriting Notes\n\nLast week, I shared several links to showrunner wisdom. This week, I figured I’d share one of the inevitable outcomes of screenwriting: notes. I’ve linked to professional writer, de factor pop culture historian, and prolific blogger Mark Evanier before (definitely check out his series on rejection), but here’s a nice piece about the three categories of notes you’re likely to experience as a screenwriter (spurred on by an article by his former screenwriting partner now…\n\nContinue reading\n\nProducing Writing\n\nMore About Showrunner Rules and Writers’ Rooms\n\nSo I’ve been meaning to do a few more posts about screenwriting and I realized I never followed up on “The 11 Laws of Showrunning by Javier Grillo-Marxuach” which I wrote about back in April… and which shows how the year is racing away from me. You see, I meant to follow up the next week with this interview with Javier Grillo-Marxuach where he talks about the 11 Laws, his books Shoot This One and…\n\nContinue reading\n\nProducing Various and Sundry Writing\n\nAlternate Hollywoods\n\nI’ve had the chance to catch up on a lot of Scriptnotes episodes over the past few weeks, which is always a good thing. Scriptnotes is a weekly podcast hosted by screenwriters John August and Craig Mazin which has been going on for over a decade and continues to have things about and interesting to screenwriters. As I’ve been meaning to do some posts about the future of Hollywood following last year’s strikes and the…\n\nContinue reading\n\nWriting\n\nThings to Come: Sci-fi Adaptation Edition\n\nI’m way overdue in posting about David Agranoff’s article for Tor from last December. In the wake of the adaptations of Dune and Foundation that were released last Fall, adaptations of quintessentially influential science fiction series, what landmark work might be adapted next? (And yes, I see you there amid your psychohistory textbooks, ardent Foundation fan. I know you’re waiting to wryly expound about how Foundation has yet to be adapted. A Seldon Crisis which…\n\nContinue reading\n\nWriting\n\nThe Work, not Art, of Screenwriting, via Billy Ray\n\nGiven last week’s post about David Lynch and screenwriting, I knew I wanted to do another screenwriting post. And then last night’s Oscar ceremony got me thinking about the film industry and its future and I remembered a column by screenwriter Billy Ray. It’s from 2016, but it doesn’t seem any less apropos in its calls to action. Note that the column is very much about Hollywood/mainstream film industry filmmaking, but it’s not like the…\n\nContinue reading\n\nWriting\n\nScreenwriting through the David Lynch Lens\n\nLast week, I posted a few videos about David Lynch and how to hook yourself an idea or two. Well, as you might expect, I plowed through a number of Lynch videos at the same time, in part because the two I shared last week are just about the nature of getting ideas. But, in fact, the first video I watched was a piece asking Lynch about his screenwriting process… and since it’s just over…\n\nContinue reading\n\nRaves Writing\n\nFarscape and Mental Health\n\nI’ve mentioned before about my love of the space opera Farscape even going so far as to detail many of my reasons to recommend it. While I touch on the writing insofar as their episodes move at a rapid clip that puts many older TV shows to shame, one aspect I haven’t dwelt on was how the show deals with mental health in general and trauma in particular. Enter James Hoare’s piece for The Companion.…\n\nContinue reading\n\nWriting\n\nAaron Sorkin Gives Screenwriting Support\n\nPurveyor of hyperreal –and immensely satisfying– dialogue, playwright/screenwriter Aaron Sorkin jumped online last week to give a few really choice answers to some Twitter questions. Enjoy.\n\nContinue reading\n\nWriting\n\nWriting Like an Angry God\n\nI have often mentioned Scriptnotes, the screenwriting podcast hosted by John August and Craig Mazin, as a source from some really good information and inspiration for writing. On the one hand, I could arguably link to them just about every week, but if I had to pick just one this year, this week’s unprecedented solo effort by Craig Mazin is one you should listen to if you’re about to embark on writing a feature film…\n\nContinue reading"
