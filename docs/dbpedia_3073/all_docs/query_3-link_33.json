Moral man is man considered as the subject of these rights and obligations.” 1 But if the problem remains the same, the answers have differed widely. There was perhaps more homogeneity, a greater consensus gentium, during the Christian Middle Ages than there has been at any other time. The break up of the Christian metaphysical hegemony led to new views of man and of morals. Although, strictly speaking, no positions were discovered that had not been anticipated by the Greek philosophers, we may none¬ theless speak of a renewal of ethical thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The rationalistic emphasis of Descartes, and later of the Cambridge Platonists and others, brought about the powerful reaction first of Hobbes and then of Mandeville. Hobbes sees no real moral difference inhering in actions, since he derives obligation from power and justice from the social compact. Mandeville uncovers the path to utilitarianism, while apparently conserving the rigoristic distinction between virtue (nonegoism) and vice (egoism). In France, Bayle’s corrosive skepticism ques¬ tioned all accepted notions and abetted the upsurge of a “morale laique” which social and psychological changes in the cultural 1 Principes du droit de la nature et des gens, I, p. 13. XI\n\nXU\n\nIntroduction\n\ncomplex of his time were fostering. The rise of rational scientific materialism threw a new light on man’s place in the world, on his nature and motivation. He was seen as moved by appetite, fear, and pride; his reason was often derogated as an instrument of self-interest, his moral conscience reduced to habituation or fear of sanctions.2 To many it now seemed doubtful that a divine influence was immanent and operative in the conscience, or at least that it produced a firm, valid, and (in the Kantian sense) practical awareness of obligation—a doubt which had already been announced by the Augustinian and Reformation conceptions of Christianity. Even deists, men of moderate tendencies, although hoping that somewhere in the universe there is a power which is on the side of right, thought they had better seek out a more concrete foundation in man’s nature as a social being, a naturalistic foundation independent of metaphysics. Such solutions at least left the hope of either inducing or com¬ pelling men to conform to moral principles in their conduct. Where Christianity broke down, something had to be put in its place, lest the human moral world succumb before the onslaught of those who insinuated that there was no right but only might, no valid law but only tyranny, and no hope for changing what had to be. Somehow, the light would be kept burning in the human habitation, even if it were true that outside was nothing but the dark night of an indifferent universe.. The history of eighteenth-century ethical speculation is, then, one of challenge and response. The first challenge came from the emptiness which ensued in the minds of many thinking men from the collapse of the Christian cosmos. It seemed at first not too difficult to replace what had been lost, and even to set the new structure on firmer ground.3 But then the second challenge came 21 have already pointed out that confidence in reason—at least in a kind of practi¬ cal reason—was reintroduced by some of the same writers in the doctrine of en¬ lightened self-interest, and in the belief that “enlightenment” can be increased among men. (L. G. Crocker, An Age of Crisis. Man and World in Eighteenth Cen¬ tury French Thought p. 253.) Rationalism increased in the second half of the cen¬ tury, even as its antithesis, sentimentalism, also did. 3 “Eighteenth century philosophers,” writes J. L. Talmon, “faced a mighty chal¬ lenge.” The Church accused secular philosophy of destroying the two essential con¬ ditions of morality—an absolute point of reference, and the unity of human ex¬ istence—thereby undermining society. \"The philosophes felt the challenge so keenly that, as Diderot put it, they regarded it their sacred duty to show not only that their morality was just as good as religious ethics, but much better.” [Cf. An Age of Crisis, chap. 13.] “A great deal of eighteenth century thought would assume a different complexion, if it was constantly remembered that though a philosophy of\n\nIntroduction\n\nxiii\n\nfrom those who tore down whatever such humanists tried to build. These challengers declared that mankind had to live permanently in the ruins and rubble of the collapsed moral world, perhaps with armed guards to keep looters and snipers in check, perhaps with none. This group of radicals, although they were few, could not be ignored. They reintegrated man within the all-embracing fold of nature to a degree which denied him any transcendence or ex¬ ceptional status. Diderot, for instance, warns us that “it’s every man for himself in this world,” and that “the world is the house of the strong.” This was the second challenge. It grew out of the critical rationalism of the eighteenth century, its psychology, its theories of determinism and materialism. Robespierre, speaking to the Convention on the eighteenth Floreal of year n, summarized with understanding this aspect of the century which lay behind him. “In a large part we owe them [the philosophes] that kind of practical philosophy which, reducing egoism to a system, con¬ siders human society as a war of ruse, success as the rule of justice and injustice, probity as an affair of taste and convention, and the world as the patrimony of clever crooks.” How accurate this diagnosis was we shall have ample occasion to observe in this volume. But any student of the eighteenth century will realize to what extent it is confirmed, even outside of the philosophic writings, in the theatre from Turcaret to Le Mariage de Figaro and in the development of the novel. Robespierre’s diagnosis, however, is only a partial truth. The vast majority of writers were concerned, quite to the contrary, with a positive response to the challenge, with avoiding that posi¬ tion which he sets forth as the heritage of the philosophes. The facts of nature, they recognized, may include those which the immoralists cited as their justification. There is, however, another fact: the moral world in man. It is here that the problem of the genesis of moral experience becomes important, and we can under¬ stand why so many writers were concerned with it. If we knew the origin, it was thought, we would know the status of the moral life: whether it was natural or artificial (to use the vocabulary of the time); whether it was primary—that is, coequal with the egoistic protest, revolt and spontaneity, [it] was intensely aware of the challenge to redefine the guarantees of social cohesion and morality. The philosophes were anxious to show that not they, but their opponents, were the anarchists from the point of view of the natural order.” (The Rise of Totalitarian Democracy, pp. 21-22.)\n\nXIV\n\nIntroduction\n\nimpulses, even though at variance with them—or secondary, the product of culture; and whether it was instinctual, emotional, or rational. The two principal traditional approaches to ethics, the intuitional and the utilitarian, reveal their shape in this inquiry and foreshadow their responses to the major substantive problem of ethical value. Certainly, the epistemological inquiry would not in itself solve the moral problem. No matter what the truth happened to be concerning the origin and status of “moral knowledge,” it could never do away with the ineradicable reality of moral dilemmas and decisions. It would not tell us, in any troubled situation of life, what is the right thing to do, or determine us to do that right thing even if we knew it. Indeed, in some cases it may have had a contrary effect and discredited moral conventions by uncovering irrational or scandalous origins. At the least, it seemed evident that the development of the moral notions in any culture does not, in itself, confer absolute authority on our traditional and instinctive moral feelings.4 On one thing the defenders of morality, religious or humanistic, were agreed, although they would not have expressed it in the same phrases or concurred on the ultimate motivating goal. The essence of the moral problem, it was clear to all, was that of the socialization of the egoistic individual. This was the basic reason why ethics and politics became inseparable. The nihilists were precisely those who denied any status to this problem or solved it in favor of the natural egoistic propensities. On the one hand, there is the moral conscience, whatever its origin, commanding us to think in terms of others, or more exactly, of standards and acts which underlie and safeguard the existence of society.5 On the other hand, there are the instinctual, egoistic drives of the individual toward pleasure, power, and pride. Since men are free, as many observed, from the compelling fixity of instinctual animal behavior, they are free to violate conscience and prefer self to collectivity. The measure must be balanced, or social life and the survival of the species become impossible. And yet there were some who asserted, and innumerably more who acted as if they, too, asserted that such limitations on the individual egoistic 4Cresson: Le Probleme moral et les philosophes, p. 182. 6 This is clearly and precisely stated by Raynal, Histoire des Deux Indes XIX, chap. XIV.\n\nLivre\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nvitalities violated the universal natural law which makes the weak the victims of the strong. For them moral law was an artifice of the weak to frustrate nature, and as such can command no status in the eyes of the strong. Eighteenth-century ethics, consequently, does not separate theory from the practical need to make men virtuous. A twentieth-century ethical philosopher writes: “The author does not undertake to teach the duties of the gentleman, nor to show that virtue is preferable to vice and that he who submits to its rules is not the dupe of his prejudices.”6 Such a statement would have been deemed most strange in eighteenth-century France. The basis of values, the nature of virtue, the reasons why we should be virtuous, and the methods of making men virtuous were all considered as the phases of a single problem, and the last two phases tormented philosophers not the least. Mandeville, for instance, contrasts the state of nature in which the self only is considered with the social state. In the latter, the problem is to make men believe “it was more beneficial for every Body to conquer than indulge his inter¬ est, and much better to mind the Publick than what seemed his private interest.” 7 Furthermore, this problem supplied the link between ethical and political speculation which were so closely allied at that time. “All men,” states Hume, “are sensible of the necessity to maintain peace and order, and all men are sensible of the necessity of peace and order for the maintenance of society. Yet, not withstanding this strong and obvious necessity, such is the frailty or perverseness of our nature! it is impossible to keep men faithfully and unerr¬ ingly in the paths of justice. Some extraordinary circumstances may happen in which a man finds his interests to be more pro¬ moted by fraud or rapine than hurt by the breach which his in¬ justice makes in the social union. But much more frequently he is seduced from his great and important, but distant interests, by the allurement of present, though often very frivolous, tempta¬ tions. This great weakness is incurable in human nature. Men must, therefore, endeavour to palliate what they cannot cure.” 8 This problem, in France at least, was further conditioned by 6 Dupreel, Traite de morale, p. v. 7 Kaye, The Fable of the Bees, I, p. 28 (original pagination). 8 “Of the Origin of Government,” in Hume’s Moral and Political Philosophy, ed. H. D. Aiken, New York, 1948, p. 311.\n\nIntroduction\n\nXVI\n\nthe prevailing theory that the quest for happiness or pleasure and the avoidance of pain or displeasure were the motives of all action. Such a supposition slants the problem in a definite direction and leads to d’Holbach’s concise formulation: “To make men happy through virtue: that is the great problem which ethics must under¬ take to resolve.” 9 This direction of thought was, in fact, apparent much before d’Holbach. Butler had already written, “I suppose it may be spoken of as very much the distinction of the present to profess a contracted spirit and greater regards to self-interest than appears to have been done formerly.” 10 This turn toward naturalism projects another aspect of d’Holbach’s problem. If self-love is the center of the psychic life and its unique motivation (a debated question which we analyzed in the first volume of this study), how could one explain the fact that man is inevitably a moral being? Nor could one escape this fact by denying, as some sought to do, the existence of God and valid imperatives. The moral facts, such as self-sacrifice, and the ethical judgments were irremovable. There were, then, two principle general questions (each having many facets) in eighteenth-century ethical speculation. The first concerns the origin of our moral judgments. Does “right” refer to inherent characteristics of actions, or does it only indicate ap¬ proval? By what principle of our constitution are we led to form such distinctions? Is it, for instance, by our reason, which also perceives the distinction between truth and falsehood, or perhaps by some other peculiar power of perception or of intuition? Why do we approve of some acts as right and disapprove of others as wrong? Is the root to be found in the emotion of pity or in selfinterest? Are these distinctions necessary or local and conditioned? This entire problem which was not of interest to the ancients now becomes important, in part because it is related to the wider prob¬ lem of knowledge. The second question relates to the object of moral approbation. Is there a common quality of rightness in the different modes of virtue (benevolence, rational self-love, proper action in a given situation)? If this quality is the unegoistic, that which tends toward the common good, what is its relation to the egoistic? Again we inquire, first, how it made its appearance beside the egoistic, and 9 Le Systeme social, III, p. 164. 30 Five Sermons, Sermon IV, p. 1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nXVII\n\nthen, wherefrom it derives a superior validity in choice, and after that, why men should be guided by its sway (the practical problem of inducing them to be so guided). On the question of origin, it might be held that both egoistic and altruistic impulses are among the original endowment of human nature, or that the egoistic becomes altruistic as a result of rational meditation, or again, that the altruistic grew out of the facts and needs of society.11 In the first case, man is held to be naturally a moral being. This does not necessarily mean that he would be a moral being without society, but that he brings to social experience innate moral attitudes,\n\npredispositions, and\n\neven, perhaps, criteria. The Natural Law and moral sense theories fit in here. The other two theories implied that the moral life is an artificial accretion, resulting in different ways from society. These theories did not, in turn, deny innate potentialities, but they emphasized the implantation and inculcation of moral experience. They also held such experience to be a valuable and necessary supplement imposed upon the natural.12 This attitude contrasted with the view of the immoralists, who also considered the ethical as an artificial adjunct, but concluded that it was invalid and to be abandoned, if not by all of society at least by the superior and the strong. Other questions followed from these, inevitably, but they were mainly rephrasings or special aspects of the main question. Is justice prior to law or does it derive from law? This is really to ask again whether the feeling of right and wrong is prior to society, or whether it stems from it, or is at least validated by it. Either of these views involved the assumption that society—in the sense of stable relations and codes—came into being. Still another way of approaching the problem hinged on a decision as to whether moral notions depend on an immutable, absolute order, such as God’s will, universal reason, or human nature, or whether they grew up as an empirical reaction to the particular experience of various cultures. Followers of the traditional Natural Law theories adhered to the idea of an immutable order. Moral sense theorists found an¬ other absolute basis in human nature. Utilitarians and naturalists might prefer the solution of experiential development; but often, n See A. Schweitzer, Civilization and Ethics, London, 1946, p. 71. 12 “Natural” is taken here in the sense of “original,” “spontaneous.” For definitions of these and other terms, see An Age of Crisis, Prefatory Note.\n\nXV111\n\nIntroduction\n\nlike Voltaire and Diderot, they mingled two or more theories. The force of the belief in a universal human nature was too great to be ignored entirely by most writers, but the content of this uni¬ versal was subject to a variety of interpretations.13 Rivarol, near the close of the period, summarizes this thinking. “Morals, like the political body itself, is founded on homogeneity: for there is none between man and beast, nor between man and God. Among animals, they would be founded on animality; among angels on spirituality; among men, they would be founded on humanity, mother of all virtues, for it leads first to justice and then to benefi¬ cence.” 14 A natural morality, then, would be one based on uni¬ versal in the human psyche, which might, in turn, depend on universals in our physical and social life. “The philosophes\n\nwrites\n\nR. R. Palmer, “obtained the advantages of theology by appealing to an absolute humanity . . . they invoked the judgment of man in general. Diderot in particular took this course. He deplored the fact that Helvetius should call ideas of right and wrong mere local and variable conventions.” 15 Morality might be “artificial,” in the sense that it developed from social living, but it was none¬ theless a natural development. With this even Rousseau would have agreed. On the other hand, it was also possible to conceive of nature not as a fixed order, but as a living process devoid of finalities, as a history pregnant with the unforeseeable. Either at¬ titude permitted the belief that mankind could be organized for the achievement of definite objects, and in ways so opposite as to foreshadow the cleavage between a totalitarian or a liberal society. Reason in the Age of Enlightenment, as in any other age, de¬ manded a conceptual morality objectifying and projecting its own existence. Whether such concepts formed a body of knowledge or truth was another question which vexed inquiring minds. It was also assumed by most that the will has the capacity to direct action in accordance with such universals and the demands of a particular situation. Here, however, great complexities arose for those who argued that actions are necessarily determined, and for those who maintained that reason is only the servant of the pas¬ sions. 33 See An Age of Crisis, chap. 7. 11 Maximes et Pensees, in Oeuvres, 1950, I, p. 248. 35 Catholics and Unbelievers, Princeton, 1939, p. 191.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nWe shall encounter many other problems which grew out of the effort of exploration and reconstruction. We shall see that the French writers of the eighteenth century—both philosophes and others—were deeply and constantly concerned with abstract ques¬ tions relating to the moral life (even as they were with abstract questions relating to human nature, the political and economic organization of society, the origins of religion, societies, myth, etc.). They could not easily forget their preoccupation with the basic, multifaceted problem of our moral and social coexistence.16 History is a succession of evolving cultural complexes, each of which is a tension of conflicting polarities, themselves ever-evolv¬ ing, creating moments of unstable stability like the points in the flight of Zeno’s arrow, leading to a new cultural complex. The “unity” or “character” of a period lies in the unique dynamic equilibrium it achieves; that is to say, in the peculiar forms and emphases given to the polarities, resulting in the unique form of the relatively stabilized tension of evolving contraries which pre¬ vails; a uniqueness which includes, among the factors, the peculiar shape of the questions that are asked and the “preconceptions” and other tools which are brought to bear in the quest for their solution. Independence and dependence (the individual and the whole), the universal and the particular, the absolute and the relative; authority (conformity) versus criticism (originality), reli¬ ance on pure intellect versus trust in feeling (in its physical and emotional forms), nature versus art—these are among the unending polarities whose metamorphoses and recombinations, impelled by the changing facts of culture and the natural restlessness or dis¬ satisfaction which characterizes the species, lead us, insensibly or by brusque revolution, from one cultural complex to its equally self-liquidating successor. It is the aim of this study to supply a view of many of the con¬ flicting elements of the cultural complex of eighteenth-century France, a view of their peculiar nature (reflecting the facts of that cultural moment), and of the peculiar balance of their opposing 16 Cf. J. L. Talmon: “But Carcassonne himself had to admit that the nearer we get to the French Revolution, the more prevalent, not to say universal, becomes abstract and dogmatic thinking, and that in the more strictly political field.” (Op. cit., p. 261.) The statement is even truer in regard to ethical thinking and the two are, as we shall see, indissolubly linked.\n\nXX\n\nIntroduction\n\nforce which created a dynamic tension with sufficient stability to warrant the appelation, “Age of Enlightenment.’’ 17 17 A word of caution. The reader will, it is hoped, discriminate between the objec¬ tive analysis of eighteenth-century ideas and the author’s critical perspective upon them. It is nowhere suggested that materialism and amoralism are interchangeable words; or that there is any logical connection between moral idealism (or lack of it) and a given metaphysical position. Where a logical connection is asserted, in this volume or in An Age of Crisis, between ideas and events, reference is usually to a particular historical framework, outlook or intellectual climate, that of the period under study, rather than to abstract logic. Finally, it is worth repeating that the word “nihilism” is always to be taken in the ethical sense, as the denial of the validity of all distinctions of moral value.\n\nThe Nature and Genesis oj Moral Experience\n\nOne\n\nNATURAL LAW\n\nI. A Brief Historical View\n\nBroadly speaking, there are only three possible sources of our moral judgments. We may hold them from a direct revelation of God’s will, communicated to a silent humanity by his prophets or vicars. In this case they are above all experience and are com¬ mands from a superior which may conceivably contradict our reason and our notions of utility. Contrariwise, they may be held to derive from experience and to be subsequently formulated by arbitrary custom, by affective reactions, or by rational reflection, in other words, by a purely human moral process. Somewhere between these two stands the doctrine of Natural Law. It holds moral truths to be prior to experience and yet involved in experi¬ ence, to be above expediency and yet fundamentally more useful than expediency, to be set forth by the will of God and yet directly discoverable by each human being through that intuitive aspect of his rationality commonly denominated “right reason.” Natural Law may be properly considered as a doctrine, when we contemplate it as a part of the mainstream of Western philos¬ ophy and jurisprudence. In reality, it is something much more important and profound, for the doctrine only formulates an intuitive belief, rationally conceived or not, which always reasserts itself within a given tradition; namely, that there is an objective right and wrong in the very nature of things and their relation¬ ships, divorced from general utility, self-interest, or emotional\n\n3\n\nNature and Culture\n\n4\n\npreference.1 Such a belief has perforce been modified into typical forms corresponding to the peculiar outlook of a given moment or milieu. Its validity and even its existence have been denied by various philosophical sects, such as the Sophists, the utilitarians and positivists, and the Hegelian idealists, all of whom, through the exercise of discursive reason, have evolved systems to which such a notion would be inimical. Yet, like the intuition of our self or of our freedom, the belief in Natural Law persists, and even as a doctrine of jurisprudence has enjoyed a powerful revival\n\nin\n\nrecent years. The historian can obviously follow it only through its written formulations.2 He will find it in systems of law, from Justinian’s Code to the American Constitution; in literature and philosophy from Sophocles and Aristotle to Maritain and Proust. The content of Natural Law has always been somewhat vague and imprecise. It changes somewhat according to the formulations of its various exponents and is consequently not quite the same for Cicero, Voltaire, or Burke. Some recent apologists of Natural Law, Catholics or political conservatives, have gone too far in an attempt to unify a “Natural Law tradition,” from Plato up till Hobbes and Grotius—generally deriving a theory which happens to be that of Aquinas. This is a patent distortion, for the history as well as the philosophy of Natural Law is extremely complex, with significant differences not only between pagans and medieval Christians, but also among the writers of each of these groups. Nonetheless, we find throughout a consistent basic attitude toward the relation of positive law to justice and right, and a common core of prescriptions and of rights. The prescriptions involve an intuitive grasp of justice in human relations: the fulfillment of contractual obligations, gratitude, or the return of good for good, the accomplishment of other undeniable obligations in the family, in the cultural group, and even among nations. Obligations imply rights, and it is on this subject that we find the widest differences of opinion among the proponents of Natural Law, though the right to life, and to what is necessary to maintain life, would be granted by all. Occidental thought has conceived of two rather different kinds of Natural Law. From the time of the Greeks until the middle of 1 An\n\nintuitive notion may be true or false. No judgment is intended here. - Thus he will find no direct evidence of it among the ancient Hebrews, who did not work it out as a formulation, but who tacitly conceived of such a truth.\n\nNatural Law\n\n5\n\nthe seventeenth century, there was a major tradition, growing in magnificence throughout that long period despite variations and contradictions. Then, as a result of the collapse of the inherited value system during the late Renaissance and the concomitant rise of empirical science, a different kind of law of nature was gradually evolved by Hobbes and his successors, one that had new and often unexpected ramifications.3 In the major tradition, nature, and not abstract reason, is supposedly the norm. The laws of ethics thus endeavor to escape the vagaries of individual human reason and will which are so often fallacious or corrupted by the egoistic propensities. And yet the “nature” that is involved in the Natural Law concept is not at all that nature of which we conceive in the broad and universal sense of the word: the laws which make the planets revolve in their courses and the plants to grow; nor yet the impulses which govern the affective and instinctual existence, or the animal souls in men and in beasts. It is that nature, or that part of nature, which is perceptible alone to beings who enjoy a rational mode of exist¬ ence, and its laws are applicable to such beings alone. Natural Law is considered inseparable from the law of reason, for reason is the natural structure, or at least the obligation of men. It is not a law for angels, since its function is to confine, to direct, and to regulate the impulses of the animal soul. It is, then, a law made by God for man, independent of his will and dependent on his reason (that is, his “right reason,” not his logical powers) only for its per¬ ception and not for its existence. Reason then is a guide or dis¬ coverer, but not a creator. As a law of nature, the Natural Law is universal and immutable. It is nonconventional and transcends culture itself. “It was con¬ ceived as an ultimate law inherent in the nature of things and centered in man himself. Clearly, belief in Natural Law assumes a noble idea of man, of his unique value both as a free and rational individual and as a social being.” 4 The Natural Law in sum was immutable because it emanated from God; universal because of the common nature of man and because its foundation was rational. We must, however, go beyond this. Natural Law is “nat¬ ural” only because of a certain concept of nature, one which holds 3 See L. G. Crocker, An Age of Crisis, chap. i. Cf. A.

Stanlis, Edmund Burke and the Natural Law, p. 8.\n\nNature and Culture\n\n6\n\nit to be definable in terms of proper ends, and which takes certain regularities to be indicative of those ends. “Unnatural acts” occur in nature but violate the ends conceived of as natural. The seventeenth-century shift in viewpoint on man and the universe brought about a corresponding revision in the concept of Natural Law. The world was no longer seen, by advanced thinkers, as an ordered cosmos. The State was the highest expression of power, not of morality. And man, far from being an essentially rational being, was selfish and cruel, moved by his egoistic impulses and passions. A new idea of “natural law” dawns, reminding us of Ulpian’s “regrettable” intrusion into the more comforting classical doctrine: the only universal law is “the law of nature” (as we shall call it, to distinguish it from Natural Law theories), one which does not distinguish man from beast, but embraces them both, and perhaps all living things, in the pursuit of the elemental needs of life, therefore of power. For Ulpian, however, and for others who adhered to his view, the problem was to “moralize” nature, trans¬ posing to it moral categories of social origin. And now it is the categories of natural science that will be applied to the social state to give it stability. Hobbes rejected the notion that man is a political and social animal as an error of political idealism. Man is an animal mech¬ anistically determined, living in a godless and amoral world. In such a philosophy there was obviously no place for the traditional Natural Law. “Where there is no common power there is no law; where no law, no injustice” (.Leviathan, Ch. XII, 1651). Although Hobbes continues to use the traditional terminology, he revolu¬ tionizes the concept, for he starts not from natural order, but from natural chaos as the human condition. Power, will, and need now become the naturalistic components of a law which operates entirely within the human experience, and has no existence out¬ side of it. Law, for Hobbes, “is the world of him, that by right hath command over others.” 5 “Traditional natural law,” writes Leo Strauss, “is primarily and mainly an objective ‘rule and measure,’ a binding order prior to, and independent of the human will, while modern natural law is, or tends to be, primarily and mainly a series of ‘rights,’ of subjective claims, originating in the human will.” 6 6 Leviathan, chap. XV. Cf. De Give, chap. XIV, art. 1 and R. Polin, Philosophic et politique chez Hobbes, p. 179. 6 Natural Right and History, p 183.\n\nNatural Law\n\n7\n\nThis law, existing in the state of nature, has no ethical content, no normative function. It is based on a fundamental “nature” which results in necessary tendencies; this nature is the fear of violent death and the desire for security. The law of nature is a factual experience of man’s power and faculties which lead him to seek what is good. It asserts the individual’s right to life and to what he needs for life: the right to the end includes the right to the means.7 Since man possesses reason, he is sole judge of what is his good and of the best means to secure it. He has a “right to any¬ thing which he so pursues and gets.” When men voluntarily enter into the social compact, the state of nature gives way to positive law. Hobbes, then, separates clearly the two ideas in the word “droit,” law and right. A law is a com¬ mand with the power to enforce it. A right is the free and legit¬ imate use of power.8 And “right reason” is only the most efficient calculation. But positive law is not limited by a prior and superior moral law by which it is to be judged for its worth and moral rightness. It is the only source of justice and there is no appeal as long as power can prudentially maintain itself. Law founds right and maintains it. The State and primarily its head, the monarch, may be absolute and arbitrary (although he is in practice limited by what the sensible sovereign will do and by what the people can do against him). Hobbes, by his concepts of man and the state of nature, makes absolutism, within the realistic bounds of power, and unlimited sovereignty both necessary and morally justifiable. Once the social contract is entered upon, relationships and, con¬ sequently, laws change. We may properly apply to Hobbes Rous¬ seau’s warning, that we must not confuse what is natural in the state of nature with what is natural in the social state. The social compact has certain essential or “natural” implications which derive from its essence and from right reason. These are obliga¬ tions, “artificial” calculations which are not, however, anti-natural. They constitute a “Natural Law” which the ruler of a society may not disregard with impunity. In society, then, we have a Natural Law, but rights are dependent on positive laws. The situation of the state of nature is thus reversed. Obligation now comes into being because mutuality is expressible in society, and Hobbes, the realist, recognizes no obligation which is not an effective, external 7 De corpore politico, in The Moral and Political Works of Thomas Hobbes, Lon¬ don, 1750, p. 36. 8 Polin, op. cit., p. 181.\n\n8\n\nNature and Culture\n\nconstraint.9 What characterizes Hobbes’s derivation of Natural Law in the social state is the fixity of his prescriptions, resulting from his effort to achieve certainty and stability by conceiving moral rules very much as one would mathematical axioms.10 For Hobbes, then, there are really two forms of Natural Law. In the state of nature, his doctrine is purely one of “rights of na¬ ture,’’ and not one of limits upon rights, or obligations. Moral Natural Law arises only in society, out of a transformation of the conditions of egoistic self-realization. On the one hand, civil law may not contradict Natural Law (except at its own risk). On the other hand, Natural Law becomes obligation only in the form of civil laws (enforceable commands), and Natural Law itself com¬ mands obedience to all the laws of a State; so that no civil law can be charged with violating the Natural Law—it is the only inter¬ preter of Natural Law—nor is there any prior definition of justice to limit positive laws. The influence of Hobbes was complex. On the one hand, a strong and persistent adverse reaction denounced his concept of man in the state of nature, its lack of rational and moral law, and the absolutism which it justified. On the other hand, his imprint on Natural Law theory, with its shift to empirical realities of the human will, was indelible.11 Although Locke denied Hobbes’s view of man and refuted his political theories, he was nonetheless influenced by him to the point of absorbing some essential aspects of the new doctrine of Natural Law. Locke, it is true, desired to reaffirm the traditional Natural Law and to put it on a sounder basis. The essential differ¬ ence is that for Locke the world is a moral order in which man par¬ ticipates; for Hobbes it is merely a natural order, in which man is called upon to build a moral order. Because of the many natural obstacles, declares Hobbes, force is necessary to moral obligation. Locke, on the other hand, insists that even in the state of nature man was bound by a natural moral law, inasmuch as he is a ra9 Ill the view of the traditional doctrine, Hobbes confuses the moral order with the juridical. Natural Law concerns knowing, not legislating, man as man, not a political community. Each man has within himself the judiciary authority of hu¬ manity. (J. Maritain, “Natural Law and Moral Law,” pp. 69-70.) 10 The laws are listed both in De Give, chap. Ill, and in Leviathan, chap. XIV, XV. For an excellent summary, see R. Polin, op. cit., pp. 191-93, and the table on pp. 200-1. u Many of his basic views were followed and reinforced by Spinoza; see Tractatus theologico-politicus, chap. XVI.\n\nNatural Law\n\n9\n\ntional creature, a part of the divinely established order of the world, an order operating through laws. “Natural Law” includes the free power of the rational individual, but this freedom, as a condition of its own existence, calls forth obligation.12 On several major points, however, Locke departs from the tradi¬ tional Natural Law doctrines, for instance, in his emphasis on rights. Also, man, not having innate ideas, lacks an immediate perception of Natural Law—although it is “natural” to him in the sense that it is a natural result of the use of his natural rational faculties. But it is not immediately discoverable to his conscience, not readable in the “heart,” not ascertainable by a consensus gentium.\n\nConscience and therefore\n\nthe laws and customs of\n\npeoples are relative and diverse. The discovery of moral truths depends, then, on correct reasoning, and moral truths are con¬ sidered to be fixed rules, as provable and ultimately as self-evident as a mathematical theorem. Furthermore, Locke’s account of mo¬ tivation stresses the pleasure-pain principle, leading thereby to the utilitarian criterion of the greatest happiness—which also con¬ firms the utilitarian emphasis on rights as the means to attain this goal. (Here we must remember that for Hobbes—as for Rousseau, but under quite different conditions—society puts an end to nat¬ ural rights, or at least transforms them; while for Locke, the whole purpose and justification of a society lay in the protection and enhancement of these rights.) Although Natural Law is not “justi¬ fied” by its utility, the motive for conforming to it is one of selfinterest.13 Finally, Locke swerved from the main stream of Natural Law theory by rooting his theories in a presocial “state of nature.” The consequences are manifold. The natural equality of this state becomes the source of natural rights. It follows also that although society is in conformity with human nature, men are not at once compelled by a social instinct to live in political communities. From this, the social contract doctrine ensues inevitably. The contract theory severs the State from nature. It assumes an indi¬ vidual will to establish “a relationship of mutual obligation which would not otherwise exist by the law of nature.”14 We come now to the second source which feeds into the new stream. As Hobbes is the fountainhead of the first, so Grotius is “See R. Polin, La Politique morale de John Locke, p. 100. 13 Ibid., II, chap. 28, art. iv, ii. u D’Entrfeves, op. cit., p. 57. See G. H. Sabine, A History of Political Theory, New York, 1950, p. 529.\n\nio\n\nNature and Culture\n\nof the second.15 It is the unfortunate tendency on the part of some recent writers to confound Hobbes, Locke, and Grotius into a single monstrous faction of secularists. No one, however, would have been more horrified than Grotius by Hobbes’s philosophy of naturalism. He belonged to an entirely alien school of thought. Grotius, an Arminian Protestant, was concerned with counter¬ ing the doctrine of Luther and Calvin (one which had its precedent in William of Occam and the Nominalists), that law depended on the arbitrary will of God and, mutatis mutandis, on the arbitrary will of the State, as affirmed by Machiavelli and Bodin.16 This doctrine, ultimately, was not unlike that of Hobbes who also placed will above reason or an eternal moral order. Law, Grotius felt, must be independent of arbitrary will and of particular facts or historical experience. Natural Law is the source of obligation which in turn is the mother of civil law.17 It must be based on pure reason, not on power. In establishing this abstract or inde¬ pendent validity, he gave Natural Law a renewed vitality and restored its importance. But he did it at the price of a concession that was fraught with unexpected consequences. Like the Stoics, and unlike the Roman jurists and Aquinas, he considered law as possessing a logical or mathematical certainty which even God could not change; so that, even though it is the will of God, it is, in a sense, independent of his will. It was in this framework that Grotius wrote these famous lines: What we have been saying would have a degree of validity even if we should concede that which cannot be conceded with¬ out the utmost wickedness, that there is no God, or that the affairs of men are of no concern to him. . . . Just as even God cannot cause that two times two should not make four, so he cannot cause that that which is intrinsically evil be not evil.18 The consequences of this statement went beyond Grotius’ inten¬ tion and turned out to be the support of a humanistic ethics and a secular Natural Law. “He proved that it was possible to build 16 In point of time, Grotius precedes Hobbes. His De lure pads et belli dates from 1625; Hobbes s De Cive was published in 1642, the Leviathan in 1651. 38 Luther and Calvin could not accept Natural Law as the sign of the dignity of human nature and as the mediator between man and God. 17 Le Droit de la guerre et de la paix, ed. Pradier-Foder6, 1867, I, p. 21. 38 Prolegomena, par. 11; I, i, x. Actually this idea had already been expounded by Sudrez and the group of Spanish jurists. See W. A. Dunning, A History of Political Theories, I, pp. 134, 138.\n\nNatural Law\n\n11\n\nup a theory of laws independent of theological presuppositions.” 19 From the traditional viewpoint, this began a schism in which Natural Law ceased to be a participation in Eternal Law and God became merely its guarantor. In Pufendorf (1672), Burlamaqui (1747), and de Vattel (1758), Natural Law becomes a purely rational construction. ‘‘What Grotius had set forth as a hypothesis has become a thesis. The self-evidence of natural law has made the existence of God perfectly superfluous.”20 Although this statement is essentially true, all these writers do express their belief that Natural Law has its source in God. Moreover, the individu¬ alism characteristic of the modern natural rights or Natural Law theory is rooted in the doctrine of the social contract, which is not accepted by Grotius (and which is, at best, only implied by Burlamaqui). Grotius intended Natural Law to be an abstract theory, not a revolutionary doctrine; he was, we recall, an upholder of slavery and the divine right of kings. It is true, on the other hand, that Grotius did reinterpret the idea of natural rights, giving them a greater importance than previously. Rights, he thought, depend not merely on eternal principles, but on qualities inher¬ ent in persons, on ‘‘that quality in a person which makes it just or right for him either to possess certain things or to do certain actions.” Therefore, the end of positive law was, in part, to protect these rights.21 In the eighteenth century, there will gradually be, after de Vattel especially, an adamant demand for specific and rigidly conceived rights, compared to the vague, pliable, and prudential rights of the earlier theory—“rights” which could be modified to suit al¬ most any regime. The modern theory “was not, properly speaking, a theory of law at all. It was a theory of rights.” 22 This momentous 19 D’Entr£ves, op. cit., p. 52. Hans J. Morgenthau comments: “Thus he took the decisive step from the concept of a theological world, whose divine government is above human understanding as well as action, to the concept of an inherently ra¬ tional world of which man is a part and which he can understand and act upon.” (,Scientific Man vs. Power Politics, Chicago, 1940, p. 13.) For J. Maritain, Grotius’ error was to concentrate on the order of nature as deciphered by human reason, rather than on the relation between the order of nature and eternal reason (op. cit., p. 67). 20 D’Entrfeves, op. cit., p. 53. 21 For Pufendorf’s attempt to “save the phenomena,” see Le Droit de la nature et des gens, Amsterdam, 1734, Bk. VII, chap. 1, 2, etc. ^D’Entrfeves, op. cit., p. 59. But we must recognize the fact that totally different political systems are developed: absolutist (Hobbes, Grotius, Spinoza, Pufendorf), or liberal (Locke and some eighteenth-century French writers).\n\nNature and Culture\n\n12\n\nchange and the ensuing ambiguity of “Natural Law” rested partly on an ambiguity of vocabulary, the words ius and droit referring both to a system of law and to rights. On the other hand, it should also be noted that the eighteenth-century proponents of natural rights did not deny, as is charged, normative limits on rights and make of them a pure experience of will and power. There was an ethical norm inherent in their theory of natural rights, in its basic principle of equality or reciprocity. It is therefore equally inac¬ curate to assert that this theory held natural rights to be absolute. Rather it declared them to be unalienable to other individuals or to the State. Now we must note a curious historical phenomenon which is usually overlooked by historians of Natural Law. Even as the new natural rights version of Natural Law was growing in strength, with its valuation of individual prerogatives and satisfactions, there was an increasing tendency, which we shall later observe in some detail, toward theories of utilitarianism and social control for the good of all. While with some writers (notably in England), this concept was designed to include the rights of the individuals within the purlieu of general welfare, with many others (especially in France), the locus of these rights is displaced from the indi¬ vidual to the community. In this process as we see it, for instance in the works of Morelly, Helvetius, Mably, and Rousseau, the “natural rights of the individual” vanish.23 It is the good of the community which it is the absolute right of the community to realize, even, or more exactly, necessarily at the cost of individual rights, since private natural rights and social utility are often, in view of the egoistic nature of man, incompatible. This new de¬ mand for natural rights, combining then the social or communal with private rights, but emphasizing the former, became that doctrine of natural rights, absolutist in character, which Burke cor¬ rectly denounced as contrary to the moral prescriptions of tradi¬ tional Natural Law and as being equivalent to power, and not to right at all. Let us summarize the two divergent doctrines, remembering that this resume is schematic and that there are many important 23 “Morelly and Mably completely rejected the current individualism and declared that happiness is to be found only in an organized society where the individual satisfaction is deliberately subordinated to the public good.” (K. Martin, French Lib¬ eral Thought in the Eighteenth Century, Boston, 1929, p. 242.) Mably, however, also asserts the rights of individuals, and even the right to revolt.\n\nNatural Law\n\n13\n\nvariations in each. The classical-Christian theory maintains a Godgiven moral law which is prior and superior to the individual and his claims. It is “known by human reason, but human reason has no part in its establishment.’’ It includes certain general rights of the individual inasmuch as he is a moral being. Although these rights inhere in nature and will (subjective motivation), their ulti¬ mate source and justification is God’s moral law. Willed personal interests are irrelevant, unless they are reconciled with objective reason -which does not derive from self-interest and is the correc¬ tive of self-interest, the latter being an atomizing and not a societal force. However, there is no antithesis between nature and society, and therefore no “natural rights’’ claim against society. Society is given equally with the person. Social institutions are part of the natural order and must respond to the Natural Law which is superior to them, but not antecedent or separate from them. They must, then, take into account man’s natural rights as a moral being under Natural Law. However, these rights do not exist independ¬ ently of the social context or against it, but rather achieve their reality and their realization within a specific cultural context, and their concrete forms are modified thereby. No rights can be as¬ serted, on an individual, natural, or communal basis, against the moral law or the social institutions which properly reflect it; for those rights, like man himself, do not exist prior to them or in¬ dependently of them. Natural Law, social institutions (properly conceived), and human rights are one complex, inseparable and indivisible. The individual is not independent of history or of institutions, and to think of him in this way is invalid. We must therefore separate civil rights from natural rights: the former de¬ rive from civil society, not from nature or God. The “modern Natural Law doctrine’’ emphasizes the individual and the empirical reality of his actual experience, needs, and claims. It is really an exaltation of human will for human ends, without a contemplative participation in divine reason. Yet it is not, as conservatives charge, a pure doctrine of will and power. It is a theory of right, one which involves the use of power for its realization; but power is not made equivalent to right. The right is to the means or power. The whole sense of the doctrine is precisely a revolt against force or power, as embodied in existing institutions. It leads to a demand for abstract, that is, for rigid and specific rights which are held to be natural and God-given. Although\n\nH\n\nNature and Culture\n\nnatural rights are admittedly only a corollary of Natural Law, in some writers, notably Locke and numerous partisans of the French Revolution, they acquire the primary importance; they are ulti¬ mately, in the nineteenth century, severed from Natural Law which is abandoned by positivist sociology and jurisprudence as a metaphysical doctrine. The “modern theory” assumes a state of nature as a historical or a hypothetical reality. The state of nature concept inevitably throws emphasis on natural freedom and equal¬ ity. It makes rights (and with some writers, obligations) both prior to and independent of any given society. The natural rights theory emphasizes the break between nature and culture or convention (between nature and art, as it is sometimes phrased). The tradi¬ tional Natural Law theory had distinguished the two without making them antithetical—in fact it had usually emphasized' that the realization of Natural Law came about naturally through con¬ ventional institutions. For the theorists of the later view, individ¬ ual rights inhere in each individual as a human being and are limited or conditioned only by the same rights of all other in¬ dividuals, according to the principles of equity and equality. Their source is human nature and will alone, that is, the natural desire for satisfaction and self-fulfillment, although these may be held ultimately to derive from God. Our rights remain valid and un¬ modified (though limited) in society, which is a voluntary associa¬ tion whose only justification is their furtherance. Therefore they are superior to any particular established form of government, which must adhere to them, failing which, revolution becomes legitimate. The mere existence of institutions is, then, no argu¬ ment for their validity or for their conformity with Natural Law. One might well say the contrary, for history is the history of irra¬ tionality and error. But reason is capable of creating a rational and just society, de novo. It has the right and the duty to do so. The historical outcome of this theory was the severance of juridical law and moral law (already evident in Montaigne, Descartes, and Pas¬ cal)—a process which has begun to be reversed only in recent years. There remains an important point, one that has also been usually overlooked. What we have called the secondary source of modern Natural Law theory, stemming from Grotius, was essen¬ tially not a theory of rights or of voluntarism, but a theory of moral knowledge and of the origin of moral experience. In Eng-\n\nNatural Law\n\n15\n\nland, this factor was relatively unimportant, because of the in¬ fluence of Hobbes and Locke, and also, perhaps, because of the empirical shape of mind. As a result, many English defenders of innate objective moral truth turned away from Natural Law to what seemed like more empirical solutions, such as the moral sense theory, moral intuition, or natural sympathy. In France, however, where Hobbes was also universally condemned, there was no Locke to transform appealingly and to perpetuate certain ele¬ ments of his doctrine, for in that country Locke was known and admired for his metaphysical more than for his political thought. Rousseau, who absorbed much of Hobbes, wrote after the middle of the century and, moreover, went in an opposite direction from Locke. Consequently, Natural Law could still flourish in France, even if with some secularization, as a true ethical theory, and there was no need to resort to the moral sense hypothesis which, as we shall see, had little appeal to the French. And yet when the French Revolution broke out, the Natural Law doctrine was no longer the chief support of moral certitude. Just as in England, it termi¬ nates in the natural rights doctrine, in the Declaration des Droits de Vhomme. French and Anglo-Saxons fuse in Thomas Paine’s ardent support of the Revolution, and in his unforgettable re¬ buttal of Burke. How extensive, then, and how deep did the Natural Law current remain in eighteenth-century French ethical speculation? This is the question we must principally examine. Why and when did it cease to be an ethical theory and become one of voluntarism and natural rights? This question, too, al¬ though outside the scope of pure ethical inquiry, demands at least a brief reply.\n\nII. Natural Law in Eighteenth-Century France What thief will abide a thief?—Saint Augustine\n\nThe Christian apologists had found themselves ever since the rise of the seventeenth-century libertin movement in an ambiva¬ lent position. On the one hand, they desired to confirm the status of Natural Law as a part of the Christian tradition and structure, and a needed defense against amoralism and immoralism. On the other hand, in response to the new foe, it became equally urgent to limit the role of Natural Law, or at least, to decry its supposed\n\ni6\n\nNature and Culture\n\nsufficiency and self-sufficiency; for freethinkers and deists were now asserting that Natural Law made revealed and institutionalized religions superfluous, and some went so far as to find it independ¬ ent of divine establishment. The apologists’ defense of Natural Law combines a basic unity with significant divergences of approach and argumentation.1 We have already noted the existence of such disparities among Chris¬ tians before the eighteenth century, despite the superficial ap¬ pearance of a unified traditional Natural Law doctrine. Now they will become more marked, and are characterized by their reflec¬ tion of and response to certain current notions and problems. Among the most important of these are the pervasive belief in a unique self-interest motivation and the state of nature theories deriving from Hobbes. One of the main threats to Christian Natural Law was the de¬ velopment of a naturalistic Natural Law which asserted the same moral principles but divorced them from God and a moral uni¬ verse, predicating them solely on the kind of utilitarianism which was later to be embodied in the theory of natural selection. An¬ other danger came from a small group of thinkers who admitted only a “law of nature’’ which amounted to a denial of any moral Natural Law. Against both of these groups the apologists had to maintain the existence of a moral order in the world duplicated by a moral realm in man, which, in effect, became the explanation of the genesis of moral judgments and obligations. The problem in relation to the first group was clearly set forth by the apologist Postel, from the vantage point of the year 1769. “There is almost none of our philosophes who does not admit a Natural Law. But several of them make it consist of that innate human tendency to seek in everything our welfare and what is use¬ ful to us; others, with a more refined and spiritual feeling, make it consist of that inspiration of reason which prescribes certain principles to every reasonable creature. . .\n\n2\n\nAs for the second group, it is most interesting to see Crousaz, in his refutation of Pope (1737) written before radical materialism had received much expression outside of clandestine manuscripts, attacking its basic position as he found it expressed in the writings 1 The exception to the unity was the Jansenists. “They were the only group who consistently refused to see in Natural Law a standard of right and wrong . . .” (Palmer, Catholics and Unbelievers, p. 28). - L’Incredule conduit a la religion catholique, Tournay, 1769, pp. 135-38.\n\nNatural Law\n\n17\n\nof the Leibnizian optimists. Pope had argued that if such natural disasters as earthquakes do not upset the natural order, why should the existence of a Borgia or a Cataline? The implication is that everything is natural and necessary in a necessary world, the best world possible. And Crousaz correctly points out that such words confuse the moral with the physical and make pleasures, virtues, and vices the inevitable results of an eternal chain.3 As early as 1692, Abbadie assumed a connection between Nat¬ ural Law and self-interest. By this time, the self-interest reduction of motivation was already a widespread theory, as a result of the writings of Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, the libertins, and certain theologians.4 The full implications and “dangers” of this position were not yet evident. Abbadie, attempting to establish the origin and validity of obligation, is concerned rather in showing that it does not come from education. He finds two innate forces in man. The first is sensitivity to pleasure and pain which is attached to self-preservation; the second is reason. The error, he argues, is to dissociate the two; whereas the natural use of reason is the proper direction of self-love. From this it is clear that duties and moral laws have a natural derivation as mechanisms of self-preservation, and such virtues as temperance, justice, moderation, beneficence are the result.5 Abbadie in this fashion resolves the dilemma of nature and reason. Yet he seems acutely aware that the moral problem is not solved thereby; that, as Hobbes and Pascal had made plain, law exists only insofar as it is realized and enforced. For he adds at once that the validity of his concept is conditioned by our immortality. The tendency to lasciviousness, injustice, and greed are also so natural that the law deriving from “reasonable nature” is ineffective by itself. “Thus the Natural Law is in man, but the perfection and extent of that law is in man immortal.” 0 Abbadie thus reaches an accord with Christian doctrine and simul¬ taneously rejects the libertin appeal to the sufficiency of Natural Law. Two or three later apologists also bowed to the pressure of the current psychology. Nicolas Bergier, one of the most able Catholic writers and one who for a while frequented the d’Holbach clan, 3 Examen de I’Essay de Monsieur Pope sur I’homme, Lausanne, 1737, p. 82. 4 See An Age of Crisis, chap. io, and especially p. 258. 5 Compare the argument of the materialist, d’Holbach, in chap. 3, infra. 6 L’Art de se connoitre soi-mesme, ou La Recherche des sources de la morale, La Haye, 1692, pp. 60-64.\n\ni8\n\nNature and Culture\n\ninquired into the nature of obligation, which he properly saw as the nucleus of the moral problem.7 Man therefore has two orders of judgment, moral and selfish. Why, he asks, should the moral win out over the selfish? Why should I sacrifice my happiness? “The reason will be the foundation of moral obligation.’’ And it is this: I am happy when I have made the sacrifice. Bergier’s answer is not only a petitio principii, but is (as Kant was to show) un¬ moral. He thinks only in terms of interest. And yet he fails to ask the main question: suppose that in making the sacrifice my happi¬ ness and self-interest come out less well than in not making it, then where is my obligation? But Bergier makes matters even worse by the assumption which enables him to avoid this question. The sacrifice is a reasonable pleasure, he avers, not madness, because of God’s future rewards and punishments; and if this is not true, then “man has no other laws or duties than those of animal packs in the forest.’’ After this, his statement that Natural Law—pity, beneficence, justice—is written in our conscience loses the force of a moral imperative.8 In this utilitarian confirmation of Natural Law by means of a supposed virtue-happiness (and vice-unhappiness) equivalence, we have one of the key ideas of the century, and we shall later find it interesting to follow its fortunes among the opponents of Chris¬ tianity. Other apologists, however, took a different tack and either denounced the utilitarian trap or shied away from it. The littera¬ teur and apologist, Denesle, for one, tried to separate moral ex¬ perience and pleasure by considering as quite distinct the pleasure felt in doing good.9 This brings us to a moral dilemma which could not be solved in eighteenth-century terms of the “unique pleasure motive,” which would have required action to be unpleasurable in order to be moral. Eighteenth-century thinkers were unable to distinguish between the pleasure, immediate or consequent, we take in an act, and the pleasure (or satisfaction) we experience in contemplating ourselves as the subject of that act (which may itself be unpleasant), according to a projected ego7 Examen de la religion, 1771, II, pp. 314-25. On Bergier, see the authoritative article by Alfred J. Bingham, ‘‘The Abb6 Bergier: An Eighteenth-Century Catholic Apologist.” 8 Similar concessions were made by Ph.-Louis Gerard in his Comte de Valmont (I, pp. 454-67), a work that went through fifteen editions. 0 Examen du materialisme, 1754, I, pp. 81-84.\n\nNatural Law\n\n»9\n\nimage.10 Such an image may be of ourself as a moral being, who selects higher values and performs obligations inherent in the re¬ lations of things.11 In their defense of Natural Law as the origin of our moral ex¬ perience, most apologists took care to emphasize the necessity of Revelation as a completion and corrective to the intuitively per¬ ceived moral law which characterizes man as a rational animal. Reason, says the abbe Sigorgne (who was also a professor of philoso¬ phy and a physicist), adds something to animality, imposes re¬ quirements of its own. Man has his own destiny.12 Yet, he adds, reason is obviously insufficient as a principle of conduct. The more astute apologists also denied a state of nature. The motive is evident in the refutation of Helvetius’ De I’Homme by the theologian Pichon.13 Helvetius had demonstrated that there could have been no virtue before society, since virtue is only re¬ spect of mutual obligation. Therefore the larger number of the “See Arthur O. Lovejoy, “Terminal and Adjectival Values,” Journal of Philoso¬ phy, 46:593-608, 1950. 11 This statement is not intended to exclude the possibility of loving the right for its own sake. Let us note briefly the most widely read of the other writers in this group. The popular abbe Pluche sought to divorce ethics from a social origin, and obligation from interest; he denied the state of nature with its resulting unmoral independence. His traditionalism is contaminated by introduction of the “fear of injustice” motiva¬ tion and by this interesting idea: “if [man] had a sixth sense, he would experience new duties which would govern the use and condemn the abuse of that sense. It is therefore relatively to his needs that man feels turned toward the immutable principles of a morality which rules his condition.” (Le Spectacle de la nature, 1746, VI, pp. 6-17; V, pp. 188-90.) The good abbe would have been shocked to know that he was anticipating the evolutionary materialism implicit in Diderot’s Lettre sur les aveugles (1749). In the second half of the century, Hayer, in his sprawling twenty-one volume refutation of the philosophes devotes many pages to the support of Natural Law. His criticisms of Voltaire and Diderot are of particular interest. (La Religion vengee, 1752-60, VIII, p- 3 ff.; X, pp. 168-93.) Hayer’s error—a not uncommon one, in the Natural Law group, was to make reason the “essence” of man, instead of a distin¬ guishing characteristic. In his chapter on d’Alembert, Hayer bases Natural Law on well-regulated self-love, the desire to have others do good to us. This again ap¬ proaches the “naturalistic Natural Law” of certain philosophes! The abbe Guidi naively places Natural Law above Revelation (Entretiens philosophiques sur la religion, 1772, I, pp. 156-57; his work, incidentally, contains a very good statement of the materialistic philosophy and some of the most inter¬ esting arguments against it). 12 Le Philosophe chretien, Avignon, 1765, pp. 9-10, 37. His view is fundamentally not dissimilar from that of a contemporary biologist, George Gaylord Simpson, The Meaning of Evolution, New Haven, 1950. 13Les Arguments de la raison, ou Examen de I’Homme, de M. Helvetius (Londres, 1776, pp. 81-84).\n\nNature and Culture\n\n20\n\ndefenders of Natural Law insisted that men have always been so¬ cial. Even this hedge was insufficient in the eyes of most apologists, since it only made Natural Law coextensive with men. Conse¬ quently they insisted further on the imposition of Natural Law by God; and a few, placing the existence of Natural Law above the danger of its self-sufficiency, even asserted its independence from God.\n\n*\n\nDefense of Natural Law continued, then, throughout the cen¬ tury. It acquired renewed force in the writings of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, who was concerned about the danger of nihilism. For this reason he condemns Locke. “He did not suspect that by denying man innate ideas, he was supplying arguments to anarch¬ ism and materialism’’ by making moral judgments conventional.14 But we have been provided with Natural Law which identifies personal interest and the general interest. These reflections lead Bernardin to a practical law, analogous to Kant’s: “Do you desire to know whether a maxim is just in relation to others? apply it to yourself. In relation to yourself? apply it to others, extend it to all men: if it cannot be applied to all, it can be applied to none.” 15 Bernardin’s most significant and best-reasoned piece on ethics is one that has generally been overlooked. Entitled “De la Nature de la morale” (1798), it is really a report on a prize contest of the Institut National in which he was a judge.16 He is critical of papers which placed the basis of morals in education, laws, or “our so fickle heart.” 17 He will not allow morals to be derived from selflove, which is tied to our passions; nor from the social order, which is often oppressive, unjust, and conducive to unhappiness; nor from the general interest, which is frequently contrary to private interest (a notable admission, for the time!); nor from Adam Smith’s sympathy, since it omits duties toward ourselves. The fact is that we are subject to two kinds of morality, explains Bernardin. There is a human kind, deriving from passions and varying with customs; and a divine morality springing from reason, 14 Harmonies de la nature, in Oeuvres posthumes, 1833, pp. 259-60. 15Ibid., p. 295. The posthumous Harmonies were left-overs from the\n\nEtudes de la nature (1784), therefore contemporaneous with Kant. Note also the use of the word “maxim.” The treatment in the published Etudes is less interesting, declamatory, poorly reasoned. (Oeuvres completes, 1818, V, p. 4 ft.) 36 Oeuvres, VIII, pp. 423-41. 17 Compare with his attack on reason in the Etudes, loc. cit.\n\nNatural Law\n\n21\n\n“an intuition of the laws which God has established between men • • • a conscience given by nature.” The first, the morality of passion, Bernardin declares, embracing in anticipation both Freud and Adler, has two parts, love and ambition. It separates men; whereas the morality of reason unites them in harmony and shows them that the reward of virtues is in heaven. The rational law does not vary with special interests but is immutable. Thus Bernardin, like Kant, reacts against the winds of eighteenth-century doctrine by reaching for a rigoristic moral absolutism.18 Samuel Formey, the prolific Protestant apologist who flourished in the middle of the century at the Academy of Berlin, offers the rather curious case of a defender of traditional Natural Law who has fallen under the influence of Christian Wolff’s new interpreta¬ tions. As early as 1745, Formey seems to have been swayed by Wolff, whose monumental Ius naturae methodo scientifca pertractatum had appeared in 1741. In a paper read before the Academie de Berlin (“Sur la Loi naturelle”), Formey asserts that the denial of God has nothing to do with the validity of moral law: “the foundation of rectitude is in the nature of man. ... It is not enough to deny God, you must also deny and strip human¬ ity.” 19 By making Natural Law purely “natural” and also by his em¬ phasis on rights, Formey takes an important step toward the newer conceptions of natural right doctrine. He advances still further in that direction in a later work, Le Bonheur (1754), by defining the propriety of acts as a relation with our happiness, this relation forming Natural Law or moral law. It is obvious that the accent is now completely displaced. “Since man can be motivated (deter¬ mine?) only by his appetite for good and his aversion for ill,20 and since nonindifferent actions have a fixed and determinate relation with man’s happiness [an assertion not substantiated by Formey], 33 We must note Marmontel’s statement: “Man’s duties, if we take away the law imposed by God, are only conventions, calculations of a free intercourse, in which each would have the right to protect his own interests and to break agreements whenever he felt himself hurt.” If God were eliminated, then Marmontel would find himself in accord with the most rebellious of atheists, and he virtually admits this. (Legons d’un pere d ses enfants sur la morale, in Oeuvres completes, 1819, XVII, pp. 232-34, 276.) 19 Histoire de l’Academie de Berlin, 1745, Berlin, 1746, pp. 102-3. Cf. Diderot, in “Droit naturel.” 20 Formey uses the words “le bien” and “le mal,” terms which have a utilitarian as well as moral denotation.\n\n22\n\nNature and Culture\n\nit follows that our actions have immutable relations with our hap¬ piness. . . . Consequently, natural laws are immutable laws.” 21 If all men are moved by the same motives, and if this relationship is fixed, it is obvious that ‘‘given the same circumstances, what obliges one obliges all.” Formey thus attempts to prove the uni¬ versality and immutability of Natural Law in a way which, though still a priori in its reasoning, rests on utilitarian and naturalistic premises more than on divine.22 Among the deists, too, and among those nominal Christians who cannot be classified as apologists or theologians, we easily observe the persistence of traditional Natural Law throughout the century, though with a definite falling off in the last decades, and with the same traces of infiltration by the new doctrines. Bayle, as might be expected, both confirms and weakens Natural Law. In chapter CLXXII of the Pensees diverses sur la comete, he assures us that “there are ideas of honor in the human species, which are the work of nature, that is, of general Providence.” But in the Continuation des Pensees diverses, he declares that “noth¬ ing is more confused” than Natural Law, for every moral law is contradicted by opposite usages. On a later page, however, he adds, “Even scoundrels have the idea of justice.” 23 Bayle’s principal statement in support of Natural Law is found in the Reponse aux questions d’un provincial. “We must be virtuous” is a proposi¬ tion, he says, which is “as eternally true, necessary and immutable as this other one, man is a reasonable animal.” Natural Law is thus grounded on rationality; but Bayle turns away from the usual concomitant support, its origin in God’s will. God cannot change the essence of things—of a sphere, of arithmetic, or of 21 In Formey’s Preface to his abridged translation of Wolff, the statement is even more radical. Morality is not a matter of self-sacrifice or altruism. All a man does for his neighbor makes himself better and happier; or else, “we must strike [such acts] out from the category of duties.” (Principes du droit de la nature et des gens, Amsterdam, 1758.) 23 In another piece published the same year, Formey lays greater weight on the voice of conscience. “It is, then, a divine voice, it is the eternal voice of truth which is speaking within me.” This voice coincides with Natural Law. (“Du vrai bonheur,” in Melanges philosophiques, Leyde, 1754, II, p. 74 ft.) The little known Bernard Lambert, whose writings appeared under the name of Fr£re Thomas Jacob, pointed out the “dangerous” implications of Formey’s theorizing. Jacob’s work is valuable as a criticism of all the important Natural Law doctrines of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. See Essai sur la jurisprudence universelle, 1779, pp. 15-91. 28 Oeuvres diverses, La Haye, 1737, III, p. 221. On pp. 405-8 he gives us a closely reasoned argument supporting the traditional Natural Law doctrine which is too long to reproduce here.\n\nNatural Law\n\n23\n\nvirtue. “Virtue was therefore morally good before God knew it to be such, but God has known it to be such because it was such.” Otherwise, before God willed virtue and vice in acts, it must be admitted that he saw them indifferently, that he might have willed the vicious to be virtuous, and that he may, some day, change his mind and abrogate existing moral laws. In such a view, 34-3 = 6 only so long as it pleases God and may be false elsewhere in the universe.24 Bayle thus carries forward Grotius’ “paradox,” and in this regard, at least, helps prepare the way for new ideas of Natural Law. Bayle's comparison of Natural Law with mathematical laws overlays his basic skepticism. Unlike physical laws, mathematical laws do not necessarily correspond to reality. Bayle never doubts the truth of moral precepts, any more than he does the properties of an ideal geometrical figure, but their existence is in an ideal world, one without passions. “I mean that, without exception, all moral laws must be submitted to that natural idea of equity which . . . illuminates every man as he comes into the world.” 25 But then he goes on to hint that, unfortunately, this “illumina¬ tion” fades before the brighter light of passions, self-interest, custom, and education. We must always bear in mind both do¬ mains, abstract right and the world as it is, for each has its own reality. “Natural Law differs from all other laws in that what it commands is good in itself, and what it forbids is bad in itself, whereas other laws make something illicit by forbidding it, or good by commanding it.”26 Clearly,\n\nthen,\n\nBayle realistically\n\nrecognizes the need for both concepts of law, that of essential right, that of pragmatic command. A group of writers in the middle years of the century support, in one way or another, the traditional approach to Natural Law.27 21 Ibid., 25 Ibid.,\n\nIll, pp. 987, 675. II, p. 369. See also the strong statement, ibid., Ill, pp. 964-65, which is almost identical with Voltaire’s defense of Natural Law. Also, IV, pp. 258-60. 26 Ibid., IV, p. 262. 27 Among lesser writers, we should note Pine Andre’s formalist absolutism, which is in many ways close to Shaftesbury. (Essai sur le beau [1741], Amsterdam, 1749, pp. 38-74.) Richer d’Aube’s stout defense of Natural Law against Carneades, Grotius and Hobbes anticipates Diderot’s “Droit naturel.” He attributes to the “social body” the right of decision in moral matters; unless, indeed, \"stripping himself of the prejudices which self-interest might have given him, he [the individual] puts him¬ self in a position to decide as the social body would, if it were assembled.” (Essai sur les principes du droit et de la morale, 1743, pp. i-xix.) Morelly, the deistic totalitarian communist, assumes the Natural Law in his Code de la nature (1755), but treats it more fully in his earlier work, Essai sur le coeur\n\nNature and Culture\n\n24\n\nStrube de Piermont’s Ebauche des loix naturelles et du droit primitif accepts pleasure and chagrin as related to the experience of obligation.28 However, they are not necessarily related to the utility of an act, according to Strube, but rather to its propriety for a man. The interesting fact about Strube is that while, on the one hand, he reaffirms traditional Natural Law, stating, for in¬ stance, that the union of men in society supposes a pre-existing order, and that men have a deep desire to be useful to their fel¬ lows even at their own cost; on the other hand, he takes a step forward toward a naturalistic view. He does this when he declares that the unity of the genre humain is only an intellectual, not a real, notion; 29 the only real union is that which derives from common needs and the need for mutual help, the latter being a variable.30 From this he concludes that Natural Law mus't be looked for not in the intellect, but in the passions of love (leading to acts of self-preservation) and hate (prevention of destructive acts). Strube carries this interesting analysis one step further when he notes, “We must however admit that there are some cruel men who, insensitive to the keenest sufferings of their fellows, seem even to take joy in inflicting suffering on them.” 31 Thus men are instinctively propelled to proper acts of self-preservation, and, in “perverted” cases, to improper destructive acts. But there can be no natural principle authorizing us to treat others any way we wish, or else “there would be no more injustice or wrong in any¬ thing we do, whatever hurts and sorrows we may cause others. The rule, or rather the privilege, which would result from such a prin¬ ciple, would make us the judge of all our acts, and we would no humain (1745). Man “brings at birth if not the first idea of morals, at least the facility of grasping them when they are presented to him”—that is, the relation of acts to the public interest, and of the latter to his own. (Pp. 172, 193-96.) The law of equity has its root in the equality involved in the relation of reciprocity. A formalist and a rigorist, Morelly insists that an act, to be virtuous, must be per¬ formed with no thought of reward, and only for the sake of virtue. Ten years later, Morelly’s ideas have evolved. Natural Law is now a principle of self-interest, in¬ stilled in us by God. The moral truths it leads to have a rigorous mathematical certainty. (Code de la nature, ed. Chinard, pp. 157, 244.) Toussaint offers a classic model of Natural Law doctrine. Unlike Voltaire, he denies that virtue is conformity with positive laws. “Sovereigns can proclaim and abrogate laws; but they cannot create, or annihilate virtues.” Les Moeurs (1748), Amsterdam, 1777, pp. xxv-xxvi. 28“Nouvelle edition” (?), Amsterdam, 1744, p. 59. 29 Compare a similar denial by Rousseau, in the second chapter of the first version of the Contrat social. 30 P. 29. 31 P- 35-48.\n\nNatural Law\n\n25\n\nlonger be accountable to anyone.”32 Strube, in this remarkably clairvoyant statement, poses the problem of nihilism, especially in its sadistic form. Burlamaqui, writing in 1747, exercised considerable influence through his Principes du droit naturel. A comparison with Mon¬ tesquieu’s De VEsprit des lois would illuminate some of the dichot¬ omies and disparities of that complex of ideas which is embraced under the phrase,\n\n“Eighteenth-century political\n\nthought.”\n\nIn\n\nregard to Natural Law, Burlamaqui holds it to consist of rules which are imposed by God through human reason.33 But droit is an idea relative to human nature and must be deduced from it. From reason and its judgments, inasmuch as they indicate the way to perfection and happiness, arises obligation, “for to approve is to recognize that one should do something; and to condemn is to recognize that one should not do it.” 34 Obligation may be defined, then, as “a restriction on natural freedom, produced by reason. . . .” Right is defined as “the power which man has to use his free¬ dom and natural forces in a certain way . . . insofar as this ex¬ ercise of his powers is approved by reason.” 35 Reason, then, is one link to the normative character of droit. It distinguishes our “right” from our power; and Hobbes’s definition, or Spinoza’s, is avoided by the inference of the moral character of this reason. And so, “anything which man can reasonably do becomes for him a right.” A second link to norma agendi is the essential in¬ divisibility of right and obligation. If reason approves an act, that is, grants it to be a right, it simultaneously imposes the idea of obligation on others. Obligation, now, is derived only indirectly or ultimately from reason, but immediately from rights. We have an obligation because men have rights. Burlamaqui does not say, like the traditional theorists, that because men are obliged to cer¬ tain duties, rights (usually in some vague and uncertain way) are involved in these moral commands. As soon as we go outside man’s essential nature and consider his various states and relations of dependency, we see him sub¬ ject to the will of a superior. “This is the right we call law.” Law must be in accord with reason, however, to be obligatory, 32 p. 50. 33 Principes du droit naturel, Amsterdam, 1748, II, p. 2. 34 Ibid., I, p. 92. 35 Ibid., I, p. 101.\n\nNature and Culture\n\n26\n\nthat is, in accord “with the nature and constitution of man, and [must]\n\nbe ultimately related to his happiness, which reason\n\nrequires him to pursue.” 36 Law, when it conforms to the condi¬ tions of legitimacy, is the highest source of obligation.37 The morality of an act is its conformity to the law which should rule it. Nevertheless the sole supposition that a creature is reason¬ able, and that it is reasonable to do or not to do certain things, constitutes obligation and suffices to establish a system of moral duties. A father must care for his children, since their welfare depends on it; the approval of his reason makes the act morally good. Therefore, the common arguments that the person who obliges and who is obliged cannot be one and the same, and that a superior is necessary so that one may not release himself from obligation, are untenable. In this way Burlamaqui unfolds a theory of obligation and of Natural Law which is in many respects classical, but which also contains some new ideas. The emphasis on rights and the right to happiness and on the self-sufficiency of reason are among these. He also brings to the fore the vexed question of the relation of “right” to “good” or “useful.” Although he is obviously not a utilitarian, there is no doubt in his mind that the word “right” is indissolubly related to a functional end, human happiness and welfare. It consists, however, of general and immutable rules. The coincidence of the right and the good is the working of Providence. Montesquieu is closer than Burlamaqui, in some regards, to the classical doctrine of Natural Law, and yet, in a more important sense, he is further away from it.38 In the Lettres persanes (1721), he asserts his belief in the uni¬ versality of physical laws and in the existence of natural economic laws.39 There are also moral natural laws, whose principle is sum¬ marized in his defense of justice. “Justice is a relationship of propriety, which really exists between two things; this relation is always the same, regardless of the being who contemplates it, 86 Ibid., I, pp. 115-16. 87 Ibid., I, p. 141. 38 The Essai touchant les lois naturelles (Oeuvres, III, pp. 175-99) is probably not by Montesquieu. See R. Shackleton, Montesquieu, p. 249m This essay, perhaps by a disciple, emphasizes the involvement of self-interest in moral judgments, along¬ side the objective distinction between right and wrong. It also separates virtue (right action) from obligation, which derives from laws (of God or men) that effectively oblige. 30 Lettre XCVII, and note 2 in Antoine Adam’s edition.\n\nNatural Law\n\n27\n\nbe it God, angel, or man.” 40 Justice is eternal and independent of human conventions—if it were dependent on them, ‘‘this would be a terrible truth, which we should hide from ourselves.” Our experience of justice involves an inner feeling, but also requires rational intuition. It is inhibited by self-interest and the passions. It does not depend on this other important truth: ‘‘justice to others is charity to ourselves.” 41 Thus moral value, while not separated from self-interest, is made independent of it, prior and superior to it. As Montesquieu’s thought matures and evolves, his interest in Natural Law recedes.42 In the Esprit des lois (1748), he is preoc¬ cupied almost exclusively by the dynamic power forces of state¬ craft, and by the nonmoral physical and historical factors. The art of government is seen as a pragmatic art. Basically, Montesquieu believes as firmly as ever in Natural Law, and his conception of it is close to that of Aquinas—or to that of Burke; in other words, it is the traditional view. It is still a matter of basic laws to be discovered in objective relationships stemming from human nature and needs, and linked with a rational universe ordained by God.43 The moral and political spheres, as well as the physical, are con¬ sidered subject to natural laws, and there too the order of nature is constant. The moral laws are normative; the physical and polit¬ ical laws, though descriptive, may become normative, judging from Montesquieu’s subsequent treatment of them. These rela¬ tions, abstractly considered, are absolute, prior to intelligent beings and their positive laws.44 Such laws may therefore be unjust. Here Montesquieu’s analysis and his interest in the subject come to an end. He seems almost to wish to point out the place of this inherited, rationalistic basis of politics and to be rid of it.45 He draws no precise political precepts nor does he attempt to 40Lettre LXXXIII. Also in 1721, in the Traite des Devoirs (Pens£e 1226). a Lettre XII. 43 As Shackleton remarks, “he is not interested in speculation on the presocial con¬ dition of mankind or the mode of its emergence from that condition into the State” (op. cit., p. 249). This, however, is in accord with the traditional doctrine. 43 Livre Premier, chaps. 1,2. 44 \"To say that there is nothing just or unjust except what positive laws com¬ mand or forbid is to say that before a circle had been drawn, all the radii were not equal.” (De I’Esprit des Loix, ed. Jean Brethe de La Gressaye, 1950, I, chap. 1.) The formulation is, of course, old. Cf. Samuel Clarke, A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God, Part II. 45 L. Stapleton points out that the comparative and historical method tended to discard the idea of universal law applicable to “men of different habits and cus¬ toms, living in different stages of development.” (Justice and World Society, p. 82.)\n\n28\n\nNature and Culture\n\napply Natural Law to any of the real problems of government. He is aware that the concrete, effective forms of law vary, and these conditions are the ones that seem to him really significant.46 The basis of any morality, for Montesquieu, is a metaphysical assumption about the world and man which overrides individual and cultural differences; but his practical morality is founded on human psychology. Inasmuch as this is so, the natural laws relat¬ ing to human behavior and needs are always present in his mind. But the positive form which they take and the concrete conditions in which they are given form and in which they operate are his immediate concern. Natural Law thus recedes to a background, even to a nominal position as Montesquieu advances toward the positivist, utilitarian view which, paradoxically, was to arouse the hostility of other utilitarian political theorists who followed him. G. H. Sabine, consequently, errs in claiming that Montesquieu “had never considered Natural Law with any care.” 47 On the other hand, he is correct in stating that this was “a conventional way of getting started;” and that “what interested him was the idea that this fundamental natural law in society, which he identified in the usual way with reason, must operate in different environments and so must produce different institutions in different places.” Sabine also accuses Montesquieu of including in his concept of Natural Law “disparate features,” moral, social, physiological. Sabine is here involved in a serious confusion which occurs again in Sergio Cotta’s treatment—a confusion of the laws in the second chapter of the first book with those of the first chapter.48 As a result of this confusion, Cotta himself accuses of confusion critics who have found a Natural Law concept in these opening pages. In the first chapter Montesquieu does sketch a theory of Natural Law, including its metaphysic, its juridical logic, and its specific content (in the ninth paragraph). None of the latter is physio¬ logical; it is explicitly referred to as “the intelligent world,” in open contrast with the physical world. It is clearly a matter of equity; of the “ought,” not of descriptive law.49 In this chapter 40 “The effort of reason should therefore bear less on abstract, general, uniform, immutable law, flowing directly from human nature, than on positive law which a given society has made for itself under the influence of certain factors.” (I, chap. 18.) 47 Op. cit., p. 554. 48 Montesquieu e la scienza della societa, p. 356 ff. 49 “We must therefore admit relationships of equity prior to the positive law which establishes them: such as, for example, supposing there were a society of men, it would be just to obey their laws; if they were intelligent beings who had\n\nNatural Law\n\n29\n\nMontesquieu uses the phrase, “loi naturelle.” The second chapter, however, headed by a significantly different phrase, “Des Loix de la nature ” no longer treats this subject, as Sabine and Cotta have erroneously assumed. It refers rather to the laws which “derive solely from the constitution of our being,” or as he has put it in the preceding paragraph, from man “as a physical being.” 50 The laws in the first chapter, however, constituting Natural Law, are outside of these factors—in their origin and import. They are rational, not empirical-naturalistic. It is for this reason that Mon¬ tesquieu is obliged in the second chapter to postulate a hypothetical state of nature in which he does not believe, in order, like Rousseau later, to conceive for a moment of a presocial, premoral, physical man-animal.\n\nCotta’s\n\namazing\n\n“discovery”\n\nthat\n\nMontesquieu’s\n\nnatural laws, as sketched in chapter II, are physiological and not moral rests, then, on two misconceptions: first, that there can be no Natural Law theory without a belief in a state of nature; second, that Montesquieu is writing about the same kind of law in chapters I and II, when, in fact, he is opposing to positive laws (which he goes on to treat in the third chapter) tivo kinds of prior law, moral Natural Law (chapter I) and the laws of (physical) na¬ ture (chapter II). It is much more accurate to say, with Brunschvicg, that the conflict in Montesquieu is between a Natural Law deriving from man’s reason and moral nature (a law superior to positive laws) and his continuing demonstration that laws are only the result of conditions of fact. It is therefore important to recall once again the distinction between the doctrine or theory of Nat¬ ural Law and the fact that there are “laws of nature.” In the latter sense, Montesquieu’s whole object is to discover natural laws which are pure descriptions of what is indispensable as a result of the nature of the State in question; such laws are normative only in the quite different sense that they are necessary if the State is to survive. received some benefit from another being, they ought to have gratitude for it; if an intelligent being had created another intelligent being, the created being ought to remain in the dependency which he had from his origin; an intelligent being, who has done harm to an intelligent being, deserves to receive the same hurt, and so on with the others.” (Italics added.) 60 Shackleton’s list of Montesquieu’s natural laws (op. cit., p 250) refers to these laws, and to their development in Book XXVI. So do his astute comments on the character of these laws as descriptive rather than normative, characterizing in simple principles “the activities of man in relation to nature.” Montesquieu then proceeds to “treat them as normative principles.”\n\n30\n\nNature and Culture The second of the century’s great figures in whose thought Nat¬\n\nural Law theory is interwoven was Voltaire. His writings are especially fascinating in regard to this subject, for they are the clearest testimonial to the difficulties traditional Natural Law was experiencing in the intellectual medium of the Enlightenment. Voltaire desired most earnestly, even desperately, to maintain the truth of Natural Law and also the existence of God and freedom of the will, in order to provide a secure foundation for ethics. A reading of Candide or several of his other tales or poems reveals how well he appreciated the menace of moral nihilism. His intel¬ lectual life was a struggle within himself. He had to give up free¬ dom; he clung to God as a drowning man to a timber; and he defiantly asserted Natural Law, time and again, with a varying admixture of alien emphases. The difficulty was that such a doctrine involved him in conflict with other aspects of his ideology. As a “purist” believer in sensationism, he assumes the tabula rasa, which was precisely (and more logically) the fount of antithetical theories, such as Helvetius’, that men are susceptible to conditioning without any limitation from Natural Law. Voltaire was quite aware of the difficulty. In the second part of the Poeme sur la loi naturelle (1*756), he attempts to refute four objections to a universal morality. Two of the four are variations of the problem inevitably raised by sensationism: that remorse and conscience may be only a habit.51 That Voltaire’s own philosophy might well have been pointed in the same direc¬ tion is evidenced by his later article, “Imagination,” in which he maintains that all our abstract ideas are based on concrete repre¬ sentations and concrete experiential images.62 In the Poeme} he poses the problem frankly. On insiste, on me dit: “L’enfant dans son berceau N’est point illumine par ce divin flambeau; C’est 1’education qui forme ses pensees; Par l’exemple d’autrui ses moeurs lui sont tracees; II n’a rien dans l’esprit, il n’a rien dans le coeur; De ce qui l’environne il n’est qu’imitateur.53 51 The other two are the variability of laws and customs, and the prevalence of crimes.

Moland, Vol. ig, p. 428 (published in 1765, written perhaps in 1757). 63 Compare the verses in Zaire (1732, I, p. i): Je le vois trop: les soucis qu’on prend de notre enfance, Forment nos sentiments, nos moeurs, notre croyance. . . . L instruction fait tout, et la main de nos peres Grave en nos faibles coeurs ces premiers caract^res. . . .\n\nNatural Law\n\n31\n\nIn his reply, Voltaire does not belittle the power of environment, but insists on the real existence of an unchangeable basis for the reception or interpretation of experience. Mais les premiers ressorts sont faits d’une autre main; Leur pouvoir est constant, leur principe est divin. These “springs” are the instincts, which in man include a “moral instinct,” or the necessity of reacting morally to experience, that is, of making moral judgments. Such judgments are, although a result of experience, generated necessarily. II faut que l’enfant croisse, afin qu’il les exerce; II ne les connait pas sous la main qui le berce. Comparisons with animals follow to sustain the argument. “Tout murit par le temps, et s’accroit par l’usage.” Voltaire thus rejects what he conceived to be Descartes’ innate ideas, already present at birth; 54 but si"
