The mural was installed on the occasion of the 50th Birthday of the Community Foundation of Greater Des Moines.\n\nEach image illustrated inside the letters of DES MOINES represents a project the Community Foundation has been proud to support through grantmaking and community leadership efforts.\n\nD – World Food Prize Hall of Laureates\n\nE – Lauridsen Skatepark and the WOW skateable art\n\nS – Principal Riverwalk\n\nM – Robert D.

Schuh has exhibited in a number of national arts festivals and has collectors across the United States as well as in Canada and Europe. His artworks feature in both private and public venues, where he aims to transform cities, neighborhoods, and private collections.\n\n10647 Des Moines https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/des-moines/ Thomas Agran\n\nThe mural presents a panorama of downtown Des Moines from the vantage point of the capitol dome. Agran and collaborator Drew Etienne sought to create an artwork that celebrates a sense of place using color, edge quality, and atmosphere to engage this large wall, but that integrates itself and does not overwhelm downtown. Inspired by their own studio practices, painters they studied with, such as Eve Mansdorf and Bobbie McKibbin, and artists like Antonio Lopez Garcia, the mural exists more as a painting in a public space than a prescriptive or singular message. This large-scale wall presented a challenge in terms of creating a brush painted mural. For the artists, it is important that their murals have the warmth of human touch, and a goal was to keep the imagery highly legible, but the paint handling open and spontaneous. The palette matches the surroundings. The mural reads crisply from a distance, but dissolves into irregular marks up close – the magic of painting.\n\nThe artists intend for the grandeur of the mural’s scale and composition to honor the goals of the commissioning party, and celebrate not just the city of Des Moines, but also the expansive sense of space and distance that can be enjoyed in Iowa. They hope that the mural presents itself as a public cultural asset of the city, and an act of human/artistic expression that helps authentically author a sense of place vs. a branding act of “creative placemaking.”\n\n2024\n\nOperation Downtown and the Greater Des Moines Partnership\n\nPaint Site Specific Short-Term Other Public Art Downtown\n\nRoCA Building, 208 Court Ave, Des Moines, IA 50309\n\n10648 Thomas Agran American https://www.thomasagran.com/\n\nBorn in Kentucky, raised in Ohio, and currently residing in Iowa City, Iowa, Thomas Agran is interested in the Midwest — for both its charms as well as its challenges. He is particularly dedicated to the Midwestern landscape, its total transformation through agriculture, and the political, social, and environmental consequences of that change. Some of his paintings also explore the complicated nexus of food, agriculture, nostalgia, and marketing. Working from observation is a part of Agran’s regular studio practice and informs his work directly.\n\nAgran has taught painting and drawing at the university level since 2011 and worked for 3 years as the Director of Public Art for the Iowa City Downtown District. In addition to his studio work, Agran has designed, executed, managed, and mentored over 50 mural projects – from private commissions to large municipal scale work in historically sensitive areas to community engaged and participatory mural and public art projects. In addition to his studio practice, mural work, and teaching, he also works as a consultant for murals and other public art projects and programs. Agran’s mural work focuses on bringing the human touch into the built environment in ways that are sensitive to urban context, natural environment, and community.\n\n10634 Future https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/future/ Jill Wells\n\nThe Community Foundation commissioned Jill Wells to paint the 4,500-square foot mural, Future, for the Evelyn K. Davis Center for Working Families. In conversations with Marvin DeJear, former Director of The Evelyn K. Davis Center for Working Families, Wells focused on African American homeownership as a central theme in the life work of Evelyn K. Davis and J. Barry Griswell.\n\nWells aimed to execute a mural that exhibits diversity and tells multiple stories. She and co-muralist Marissa Hernandez depict our community in a manner that is relatable and legible to the passer-by, both pedestrians and drivers traveling between 15-30 miles per hour. Wells’ design process was multifaceted. She created three designs, conducted community outreach, met with the Davis family, and wrote a personal letter to Mrs. Griswell. Wells found that Barry and Evelyn were described as passionate, persistent, responsible, optimistic, imaginative, organized problem solvers, and risk-takers. Wells sought to create an artwork “rich with representation that felt like the heart and spirit of Evelyn, Barry, and our community.”\n\nIn addition to the central themes of the mural, which include African American homeownership, peer-to-peer-fellowship, and education, the following foliate symbols are also present:\n\nGREEN (color) depicts hope, renewal, and revival.\n\nMonstera: symbolizes honor, respect, and longevity (Great for: Someone who values their background and family history).\n\nSnake Plant: symbolizes cleanliness and tenacity (Great for: Someone who is creative or as a housewarming gift because it naturally purifies the air).\n\nFerns: symbolize sincerity towards others.\n\nHosta: symbolizes devotion and friendship and very effective in groups or massed.\n\n2023\n\nCommissioned by the Community Foundation of Greater Des Moines\n\nPaint Site Specific Short-Term Other Public Art Downtown\n\nEvelyn K.

Born in 1980 in Des Moines, Iowa, Wells was raised in Indianola, Iowa.\n\nShe studied at Drake University (BFA 2005). An award-winning painter, Wells has been in practice for more than 18 years, with public and private works in Iowa, Mississippi, Arizona and New Orleans.\n\nHer artwork is represented in the permanent collections of: Disability Rights Iowa, Iowa Lutheran Hospital, Blank Park Zoo, YMCA of Greater Des Moines, The Annette Nature Center, Polk County Jail (west wing) and Creative Visions Human Development Center. In 2020, Lavender and Lime profiled Wells in an online published portrait manifesto series, Black Lives Matter Portrait Manifesto. Most recently, Wells was the recipient of the Iowa Creative Incubator Fellowship through Mainframe Studios. Currently Jill Wells serves on the Board of Directors for The After School Arts Program and works as a full-time Artist.\n\nARTIST’S STATEMENT:\n\nMy practice begins with a sound, a song, a sent, a texture, a look or glance, an emotion or injustice, a celebration, problem, or memory. Once inspiration strikes, I then move to creating: creating through materials, mediums, space, research, investigating, developing a narrative, creative-thinking and creative problem-solving. I am very mindful when creating and this involves thinking as well as “not thinking.” My practice is somewhat ritualistic when it comes to the actual production process. Art, for me, is about narration, connectivity and addressing needed areas. It is about having internal and/or external conversations with others, and making connections through one’s thoughts, emotions, space.\n\n​\n\n10624 Monroe Colston Cornerstone Mural https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/monroe-colston-cornerstone-mural/ ASPHATE\n\nThe Community Foundation’s first president, Monroe Colston, was he honored through the Monroe Colston Cornerstone Mural, completed on the east wall of the C3 Center by local artist ASPHATE and the Scarce Elementz Crew. As Community Foundation Executive Director, Kristi Knous, remarked at the dedication, Colston’s “…leadership paved the way for future generations, the very people who are learning, growing and gathering in the C3 Center today.”\n\nPrior to serving as the first president of the Community Foundation of Greater Des Moines, Colston was an executive leader at the Des Moines Chamber of Commerce (now the Greater Des Moines Partnership) and was the real estate commissioner for the State of Iowa. He served in the US Army, the Boy Scouts of America, and the US Postal Service. Colston paved the way for people of color in Iowa as the founder of Blacks in Management, Inc., and served on numerous boards including the Mercy Medical Center Board, Bankers Trust (the first African American so elected), NAACP, and the Brain Trust to the Congressional Black Caucus. Colston passed away at age 77 in 2011. Learn more about Monroe Colston through this video.\n\nThe Monroe Colston Cornerstone Mural was installed and dedicated in September 2023 to coincide with the opening of the Community Foundation’s new C3 Center. The Mural is on the east wall of the C3 Center, located at 1910 Ingersoll Avenue, behind the Finkbine Building. The C3 Center represents the three C’s: Connection, Collaboration, and Community and is home several of Des Moines’ non-profit organizations.\n\n2023\n\nCommissioned by the Community Foundation of Greater Des Moines\n\nPaint Site Specific Short-Term Other Public Art Downtown\n\nC3 Center, 1910 Ingersoll Avenue, east wall\n\n7106 ASPHATE & LETER91 American http://www.scarceelementz.com/\n\nASPHATE (pictured) and LETER91 are both graffiti writers carrying near 10-year tenures, as well as crewmates in Scarce Elementz, a nationally recognized mural crew.

Aside from syntax, the Des Moines’ native’s medium of choice is the spray can and surface of choice remains anything that will hold pigment from freights to concrete.\n\nABOUT LETER91\n\nBased in Phoenix Arizona, LETER91 is a freelance artist who focuses on paintings, murals, events and projects. Self-taught, LETER91 creates studio and live, on-site painting, logo design, tattoo design and shirt design.

Weber\n\n“SWISH” is a project initiated in 2019 by GDMPAF that transforms basketball courts in ethnically diverse and low-income areas. The project involved two phases with a mural in each location: first on the basketball court at Oakridge Neighborhood in Des Moines, and second: a traditional mural on the side of Oakridge’s Building 301.\n\nJordan Weber, a Des Moines native and artist-activist, was the lead artist and designer for both murals. The theme that carries through both pieces honors Yore Jieng, a 14-year-old Oakridge resident whose life was taken too soon. He loved basketball and spent many hours on the very same court. Five years after his death, in the fall of 2021, dozens of people gathered at the court to dedicate the newly completed King Yore I mural atop the court he used to play on so often. The image depicts Yore wearing a Laker’s jersey and a titled Nubian crown atop his head with flowers from South Sudan.\n\nIn 2002, Yore’s family immigrated from Sudan. The piece draws on both Yore’s Sudanese roots and his accomplishments here in Iowa. Weber explained further, “The idea was to put a crown on Yore’s head slightly tilted because we know how hard it is to make it out of situations that we may be from.” King Yore II, the second mural in the project, covers a wall at Oakridge facing Blank Children’s Hospital. Painted by Jill Wells, the image depicts Yore yet again with a crown, but instead outlines his silhouette in native Sudanese flowers and butterflies, memorializing his life.\n\nWith both phases of the SWISH project completed, an event of celebration and remembrance was held in January of 2023 at Oakridge. King Yore I & II remind us of what Yore enjoyed most in life and serves as a statement to the dreams and potential of all who will step onto the court.\n\n2022\n\n\"SWISH\" is funded through the GDMPAF Director’s Discretionary Fund, a GC20 Capital Project grant from Bravo Greater Des Moines, and Knapp Properties LC. The basketball courts were engineered and repaired with sponsorship from Oakridge Neighborhood.\n\nPaint Site Specific Short-Term 10103 SWISH 41.592578, -93.636323\n\nThe basketball court is north of the 1400 block of Center Street in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nhttps://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mural-honors-teen-Yore-Jieng.pdf 592 Jordan J.

installed at the John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park. The 12-foot-high bronze female figure has one arm and stands on a peg leg. The dark patina of the bronze suggests the passage of time. While monumental in size, she is vulnerable. Bhabha often explores such dualities in her work, drawing upon multiple perspectives from humanity’s shared history. The sculpture invites contemplation from various angles, reflecting the mythological Roman god Janus, the god of transitions, doors, gates, and abstract dichotomies such as life and death.

Her imposing, fragmented figures draw upon representations of the human form from the Paleolithic to present, generating amalgamations of time and place. She considers the comparisons between found and manmade materials in her work, often using bronze for her large-scale figural sculptures.\n\nBhabha was born in Karachi, Pakistan and came to the United States to study at the Rhode Island School of Design (BA 1985) and Columbia University (MFA 1989). Her works are collected and exhibited internationally; institutions include, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2018, she was selected for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s annual Cantor Roof Garden Commission.\n\n9957 Liftoff https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/lift-off/ Alice Aycock\n\nWho has seen the wind?\n\nNeither I nor you:\n\nBut when the leaves hang trembling\n\nThe wind is passing through.\n\nWho has seen the wind?\n\nNeither you nor I:\n\nBut when the trees bow down their heads\n\nThe wind is passing by.\n\n— Christina Rossetti (1830-94)\n\nAir is a quiet constant in our life, what we need to be alive at all. When air begins to move, a breeze can set our world into motion, with trees gently swaying or leaves scattering. When air becomes wind, it can be a caress, but it can also be a force that turns the very air we breathe into a tornado. Being surrounded only by air, being lifted off of the earth was only a dream for humanity until modern times when airplanes took us up into the skies. Being aloft in the air is both one of the most exhilarating and the most terrifying experiences that humans can have.\n\nAlice Aycock’s sculpture makes visible the air that sustains, delights, and frightens us and that also represents our awareness of things beyond the ground we stand on. Her structures are precisely engineered to embody the forces of nature and to suggest the feelings they provoke in us. Often made up of thin, curving slices of steel, Aycock’s sculptures evoke currents of air, especially ones that could lift us beyond the earth – in our imaginations as well as our actual bodies.\n\nHer sculpture, Liftoff, is installed in the best possible place in the greater Des Moines community: at the entrance to the airport. Aycock has referred to the sensation she has when the airplane leaves the ground and climbs toward the clouds, a feeling that is widely shared and is likely anticipated by passengers arriving to catch their flights. At first glance, the sculpture immediately creates the effect of moving air that can carry us up and away. It also may make us think of the propellors and turbines that spin and induce the energy to overcome gravity and take us into the open air and off to other places.\n\nPainted a dazzling white, Liftoff catches the light that, like air, is constantly moving and changing. Every view of the sculpture is different and distinct, tracing the sun’s progress across the sky or, at times, the clouds that drift overhead. Even at night, the sculpture is dramatically lit so that it will glow as travelers pass in and out of the airport.\n\nLiftoff serves partly as a memorial to Johnny Danos, a bon vivant whose charm, energy, generosity, and congeniality was devoted to the enhancement of Des Moines. After retirement from a distinguished career in business, Danos led the Community Foundation of Greater Des Moines to a spectacular success that continues to enliven the life of the city.\n\nWritten by Lea Rosson DeLong, Ph.D., art historian | curator\n\n2021\n\nGreater Des Moines Public Art Foundation Collection, 2021.1; Commissioned by Greater Des Moines Public Art Foundation, this landmark sculpture honors Johnny Danos (1939-2018).\n\nMajor contributions were provided by the Johnny Danos Better Together Fund, Community Foundation of Greater Des Moines and Teresa Van Vleet-Danos,\n\nCity of Des Moines, Des Moines International Airport, Mary and John Pappajohn, Brooks-Richer Endow Iowa Fund, Charlotte and Fred Hubbell, and Trudy Hurd, In memory of David Hurd.\n\nPainted Aluminum, Stainless Steel Outdoor Sculpture Long-Term\n\nMuch of my work in both the public and private spheres has been a meditation on the philosophical and metaphorical ramifications of science and technology from the simplest tool (the arrowhead and the plow) to the invention of flight and the computer. Many of these works have incorporated references to energy in the form of spirals, whirlpools, spinning tops, whirly-gigs, and so on. I try to visualize the movement of wind energy as it flows up and down creating random whirlpools and forming dynamic three-dimensional massing of forms. The sculptural assemblage references the expressive quality of wind and flow dynamics.\n\nMetaphorically, the work speaks to the exhilaration and sense of excitement that travelers feel during takeoff and landing. As a frequent traveler, I always experience the moment the plane leaves the ground and the Earth itself as a truly magical sensation of levitation. Aerospace travel feels as though it defies gravity.\n\n--Alice Aycock\n\nLiftoff 41.531161, -93.646136\n\nProminently located on the median formed by the divided, entrance and exit of the Des Moines International Airport complex.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoIe-kxyjqU https://youtu.be/dYNmXCfs8YE https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Aycock-brochure.pdf 213 Alice Aycock American born 1946 http://www.aaycock.com/\n\nALICE AYCOCK\n\nLea Rosson DeLong, Ph.D., art historian | curator\n\nAlice Aycock has been a major international artist for decades, beginning in the 1970s, when she began installing her sculptures throughout the United States and abroad. In addition to her sculpture in Des Moines, Aycock’s works are also found at other airports (such as Kansas City and Philadelphia), including two of the nation’s busiest: JFK in New York and Dulles in Washington DC. Among her many well known installations is Paper Chase (2014), a series of seven sculptures that raced along several blocks of New York’s Park Avenue. Her work is in the collections of major museums such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the National Gallery in Washington DC, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nBorn in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Aycock was interested in movement from an early age, especially as expressed in her own body by dancing. “The very beginning of my creative consciousness was the immediacy of dance,” she has explained.[1] The twirling motions of dance and its leaps through space are among our earliest childhood sensations of exhilaration and of altering our perception of the world, and Aycock has translated those recollections into works of art. Later on, she developed a fascination with science and technology, especially where those reveal nature both inside and out.\n\nShe graduated from Douglass College in New Brunswick, NJ before receiving her Masters at Hunter College in New York in 1971. Her earliest works were part of the Land Art style in which artists use the landscape itself and the forces that shape it as their medium. Soon, she began to focus on art that expressed motion, with a tone of spontaneity and lightness, but which was usually fabricated from highly industrialized, precisely engineered steel or synthetic materials. Her aerial, twisting shapes were anchored to the ground or a firm base, but they reached toward the sky in a way that evoked the forces within nature that develop and then decay.\n\nAycock taught at the Yale University School of Art (1988-1992) and is currently on the faculty at the School of the Visual Arts in New York. In addition to her numerous commissions for major sculptural installations, Aycock also exhibits the drawings and similar plans for these projects.\n\n1.

Born in Jerusalem in 1951, he first studied engineering, but was quickly drawn to the cinema. He received an undergraduate degree in film at Beit Zvi School for the Performing Arts in Ramat Gan, and moved to Paris where he studied cinematic theory at the Sorbonne (Université Sorbonne Nouvelle – Paris III).\n\nBy 1984, he had established his reputation as producer and director with the legendary satirical French magazine, Hara Kiri/Charlie Hebdo and created the first original fiction made for the emergent video-cassettes market in France (a box office success).\n\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, Oyoram developed a unique cinematographic language on the margins of the French film industry. His principal preoccupations were short length films, often made for French television. In addition to innovations in the narrative formats, there were important formal innovations related to his preoccupation with the place of the spectator in the space where the films were projected. His large scale installations led to films which allowed the viewer a greater degree of autonomy.\n\nIn 1993, Oyoram founded a company Cinéma hors écran (Offscreen Motion Pictures) not only to continue with his experimentation into the narrative dimensions of the medium but also into the forms going beyond the mechanics of the cinematic language to imagine “film” projected into a variety of new settings.\n\nPierre-Henri Deleau, co-founder “la Quinzaine des Réalisateurs” at the Cannes Festival, said that Oyoram’s art, “leaves open the question as to whether he is a poet making films or a filmmaker making poetry.”\n\nTwo years after founding Cinéma hors écran, Oyoram entered into a partnership with the LVMH group which allowed him unprecedented freedom to continue his tireless effort to expand the physical, technical and conceptual boundaries of film.\n\nHis visual art work has been commissioned by prestigious companies including Cartier, Van Cliff & Arpel, Sony, and Louis Vuitton.\n\nOyoram’s visual inventions have included small eye-glass lenses used to reveal the wearer’s subjective viewpoint to a 15 meter high clock, a spectacular metaphor dramatizing time as a circus ring. A designer, script-writer, and director, Oyoram experiments with immersive cinematic experiences as in the 2003 traveling exhibit Diamonds and the Power of Love shown in Tokyo, Las Vegas and Paris, featuring 11 mannequins brought to life by the magic of image- projection. In Retrophobies, a composition of 26 films simultaneously playing on large screens, Oyoram fused art and technology to invent “Vunettes” for an individual audio-visual experience in a public space. He also pioneered the seamless mix of painted canvas and moving images in Double You See, a traveling exhibition shown in 2006-2007 in Paris and Hamburg. Since 2007, when he imagined into creation “virtual windows” in the famous rotunda Dior Avenue Montaigne, Oyoram has designed monumental visual moving fresques for Dior.\n\nWith the completion of his studio in Des Moines, his recent work has moved into immersive environments that can be seen as the culmination of many decades of experimentation into the poetic and sensorial possibilities of a cinematic visual language.\n\n9921 The Black Crown of Perpetual Loss https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/the-black-crown-of-perpetual-loss/ Larassa Kabel\n\nThe Black Crown of Perpetual Loss builds upon artist Larassa Kabel’s frequent use of animals to explore difficult truths about love and death. Inspired by a small Bronze Age figure in The Menil Collection of Houston, TX, Kabel’s bronze sculpture uses a two-headed stag to represent the intrinsic ties between love and loss. The stags are modeled on fallow deer, a species bred worldwide for their beauty and collectibility as trophies. The head with the erect ears represents love while the head with the ears tipped down represents loss and was modeled after a photograph of a dead stag that was being held up by a hunter. The dimensions of this unique cast bronze sculpture are 45 x 47 x 31 inches (114.3 x 119.38 x 78.74 cm). It the first long-term, public art commissioned by The Avenues, a consortium of property and business owners and neighbors on Grand Avenue and Ingersoll Avenue who are working together to promote this historic area on the west side of Des Moines, Iowa. The Black Crown of Perpetual Loss is installed on the lawn of the Plymouth Place apartment building which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n2019\n\nMade possible by The Avenues of Ingersoll & Grand, private donors, Bravo Greater Des Moines, the Iowa Arts Council, and the National Endowment for the Art\n\nBronze Sculpture Long-Term\n\nLove is an essential and mysterious force in our lives, but our culture ignores the reality that grief is the price of love.\n\nThe truth is that love, like everything else, will eventually end. We are so afraid of the pain of loss that we pretend it will never happen. I think this is a huge mistake. By acknowledging the temporary nature of our relationships, we are more likely to appreciate what we have while we have it.\n\nI am interested in the ways that people try to hold on to something they love for “forever”. The irony that someone would harvest a deer in order to recreate it as a taxidermy mount, a lesser version of itself, is fascinating.\n\nThe Black Crown of Perpetual Loss 41.381990, -93.651720\n\nLocated at the northeast corner of the intersection of Ingersoll Avenue and 42nd Street on the lawn of Plymouth Place apartments.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAIx2ru2U3A&t=18s Courtney Kinzer 7783 Larassa Kabel American Born 1970 https://www.larassakabel.com\n\nLarassa Kabel, born 1970 in Mt. Clemens, MI, is a visual artist who often uses photorealistic drawings, paintings and prints to address issues of loss, fear, compassion, gender and feminism. She wants her work to start conversations about the “sad, hard parts” of human experience and help people “support one another in a difficult world.”\n\nThrough the concept of compassion, her work encompasses a broad range of emotional states, spanning the worst moments of life to recognizing one another’s humanity regardless of gender or shape or life choices.\n\nIn 2015 Kabel co-founded Chicken Tractor, a nonprofit organization that creates professional development, exhibition, networking and micro-funding opportunities for emerging and mid-career Iowa artists. In 2016, she received the first Dave Hurd Innovator of the Year Award from the Des Moines Arts Festival. The new award recognizes an individual or organization that demonstrates the pursuit of innovation in the arts.\n\nKabel was an Iowa Arts Council Artist Fellow in 2015 and one of the Des Moines Art Center’s Iowa Artists 2010. Her painting of the Obamas’ dog, Bo, was selected for the White House Christmas card in 2012, and her colored-pencil portrait titled “Don’t Stop Believing” was acquired by the Des Moines Art Center for its permanent collection in 2014.\n\nHer work — which also includes mixed media, sculpture and collaborative projects with other artists — has been exhibited in museums and galleries throughout Iowa and the US, including Chicago, Cincinnati, Houston, Kansas City, Miami, New York City, and other cities in Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana and New York. Kabel has organized compelling projects in Des Moines which have included Beyond Nature (2013) and UPSpeak (2016.)\n\n9804 River Constellation https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/river-constellation/ River Constellation Team River Constellation is a responsive sculpture evoking a thicket of light and sound, honoring the donors who support Des Moines’ Water Works Park. Forty-five (45) ten-foot tall poles holding 12-inch diameter orbs that softly pulse with light are arranged to suggest the path of the Raccoon River through Water Works Park’s 1,500 acre natural environment. Individual rings mounted to the poles are engraved with the names of park sponsors. Motion sensors trigger an infinitely variable musical composition of birdsong and a mixed ensemble. Sound exciters mounted within the globes play the music which is generated as a unique expression each time it begins, serenading those who explore within the sculpture’s terrain. The artist team of Beau Kenyon and Natalia Zubko worked collaboratively to create River Constellation. The fabricator was JunoWorks; sound and light design was by Dispersion; musicians were Bridget Cappel (mezzo soprano), Meridian Prall (alto), Evan Hammond (baritone), Kariann Voigts (clarinet), Kevin Judge (bassoon), Bret Seebeck (horn), Matt Halbert (trombone), Julie Fox Henson (violinist), Mary Pshonik (cello), and Beau Kenyon (piano).

The project is being implemented in collaboration with the Des Moines Regional Transit Authority (DART) as part of a larger streetscape project.\n\nIn 2019, the 6th Avenue Corridor (6AC) Urban Neighborhood Main Street Program advanced the longest and most environmentally-sustainable streetscape project undertaken by the City of Des Moines. The district, located along 6th Avenue, links downtown Des Moines with historic neighborhoods to the north. Twelve (12) bus shelters are being installed in three phases along this 1.2- mile district stretching from the Des Moines River Bridge south to Interstate 235.\n\nEach design is digitally embedded into the glass panels of each bus shelter. The objective has created a collection with a common theme and inspiration to establish a distinct visual identity for transit in the 6th Avenue Corridor district. Each shelter structure features five glass panels and the designs will expand across the surface of each panel.\n\nSheena Rose’s concept designs combined two major bodies of her work: “Sweet Gossip” and “Town.”\n\n“Sweet Gossip“ is a collaborative project with artist Sheena Rose, photographer Adrian Richards and art historian Natalie McGuire. The project looks at the Pop culture of Barbados and the phrases or comments that Barbadians use when gossiping or in certain situations. In this series, Sheena Rose references some of the stereotypes and places them within everyday situations in the paintings. She incorporates her paintings into performances in the streets and public spaces where the gossip is overheard.\n\n“Town“ is about the busy urban life style the artist encounters when she travels to different countries. Rose sees the world with lots of lines and images extending over a different image — partially covering one another. Many of these compositions overlap other cities and stores. She finds towns are very interesting places to draw. Particularly, the daily lives of persons and the idea of the space.\n\nIncorporating six vivid hues into these designs, the artist fills the composition with colors that are meaningful to her: orange represents diversity; yellow personifies welcome; purple expresses condition; blue reflects lightness; green embodies growth; and pink becomes balance. 2020\n\nThe 6AC Bus Shelter Art Project is funded by the 6th Avenue Corridor Urban Neighborhood Main Street Program, with partial support from Greater Des Moines Public Art Foundation.\n\nGlass, Plastic, laminated Installation In-Progress\n\nThe idea to do the ‘Mash Up’ of these specific styles comes from my desire to express the personality of the space, the vibrancy of the people and the architecture of the cityscape as a background all at once. Because that is how a city lives and breathes.\n\n\"Sweet Gossip\" focuses on Barbadian Pop Culture and the phrases or comments that Barbadians use when gossiping or in certain situations.

Rose is a Fulbright Scholar and earned a BFA Honors degree, in addition to a MFA from The University of North Carolina at Greensboro.\n\nThe nature and meaning of contemporary identity, particularly her Caribbean identity, is one of Rose’s major themes. In drawings such as Town and Crowd, and in her paintings and animation, she continues to explore who people are at any given moment, in any given place.\n\nRose was awarded a number of international artist residencies, and has exhibited her work throughout the United States, as well as internationally in South America, Canada, Caribbean, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Prestigious art institutions, for example the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts (aka “MoCADA”), Queens Museum in New York; and Turner Contemporary in Kent, England have exhibited her work.\n\nIn 2017, Rose performed her work “Island and Monster” at the prestigious Royal Academy of Arts, London. Her performance was developed in response to sketches that she has making to express her conflicted feelings of belonging and displacement, which emerged with her return to the Caribbean after completing an MFA in North Carolina. To reckon with her changing relationship to her home, Sheena became both the island and the monster, looking in from outside as a way to negotiate this return. Also in 2017, she performed “Island and Monster” at MoCADA in New York City.\n\nIn 2019, she created a two-story mural at the Inter-American Development Bank Headquarters located in Washington, DC. She also created a large-scale mural for an exhibition called “The Other Side of Now” at the Pérez Art Museum in Miami (aka PAMM), Florida.\n\nRose has been the recipient of a number of international artist’s residencies and her work has also been included in a number of Art Fairs, Film Festivals and Auctions such as Prizm Art Fair, Third Horizon Film Festival and Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation Auction- Art for Life.\n\nRose’s work is also featured on the cover of three books, Small Axe 43, “See Me Here,” Robert and Christopher Publishers and in 2015 her work graced the cover of Naomi Jackson’s book “The Star Side of Bird Hill”. Huffington Post and E People Magazine voted that cover one of the best book covers for the year 2015.\n\nSheena has been featured in the New York Times, Huffington Post, Travel & Leisure Magazine, and Vogue. In 2018, Sheena created poster artwork for the play “Emma and Max”, written and directed by Todd Solondz. In 2019, She created a two story mural at the Inter- American Development Bank Headquarters in Washington DC.Sheena also created nine feet tall women mural for an exhibition called “The Other Side of Now” in the Perez Art Museum Miami.\n\nSheena Rose is also known for her art presence on social media.\n\nHer resume includes a listing of her honors, solo and group exhibitions, artist residencies, performances, publications, and projects.\n\n9682 Even Water https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/even-water/ Cliff Garten\n\nWater plays a critical role in a community’s quality of life, from public health and safety to recreation and beauty. Knowing what a watershed is and how we can each play a role in preserving its function and value is important but rarely understood. The West Des Moines Public Arts Advisory Commission use this public art initiative to raise awareness of watersheds and everyday actions which residents and businesses can take to improve water quality in a watershed.\n\nEvery person who participates in and experiences Even Water can be enlightened, empowered, and proud to live in West Des Moines. Even Water is an eight-piece cycle suite of permanent sculptures installed in Raccoon River Park in 2019. It is fabricated in mirror polished stainless steel and bronze.\n\nFour poetic sculptures are: A Changing Lake, The Water Table, The Oxbow, The Well, and The Water Balance. EVEN WATER: A Changing Lake A Changing Lake is a sculpture of four frames that asks the viewer to perceive the constant change brought about by people and the landscape. Blue Heron Lake is not a geologically formed lake, but the result of a quarrying operation begun in 1955. A Changing Lake chronicles the decades of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. During these decades the confluence of the quarrying operation and rising and falling of the Raccoon River brought the Lake and the River together in an unrelenting dance. The quarry unearthed five springs which filled the cavity left by the River to flow into and join the Lake. At its early elevations and at high water the River and Lake became one. Reclamation of the landscape as a park, again separated the flow of the River from the Lake. A Changing Lake is comprised of four bronze picture planes in which the River and Lake are seen as open windows to the other sculptures in Even Water and the landscape beyond. Through these “windows” viewers can see that Blue Heron Lake was not part of the landscape 60 years ago. Its arrival through human intervention was recent compared to the long history of the land. The 3-dimensional map of the site, or picture through a window that outlines the changing shape of the lake, was inspired by aerial photos of 1955, 1967, 1974, and 1990. EVEN WATER: The Water Balance The form or process of engineering that makes the 2019 equilibrium of the site possible in described in the sculpture, The Water Balance. This sculpture is a metaphor for the pervasive concept of people engineering water on the land. Throughout time people have changed the course of water to cohabit the land. This has been done by re-channeling of rivers, diverting water for roads and land use, creating lakes and reservoirs, under-grounding rivers and streams. The engineering of the flow of the Raccoon River and creation of a dike between the River and the Lake separated the cleaner water of Blue Heron Lake fed by underground springs and the water of Raccoon River, sullied by continual agricultural runoff. In the natural topography of the site, the River is approximately two and one-half feet lower that the level of the Lake. Three engineered pipes, very much like a balance scale redistribute the water from the Lake back into the River. This continues until the lake and River reach an equilibrium again awaiting the next flood in the water cycle. Because the River is lower than the Lake, the Lake will drain into the River until it is below the level of the pipe and cannot drain any more. There is a slight downward slop of the pipe to encourage the water to move toward the River. The bronze and stainless-steel sculpture, The Water Balance, examines this relationship represented by a pipe which is like a balance bean resting precariously on the tip of a pyramid , balancing the flow of Lake water back into the River until the two systems reach equilibrium once more. EVEN WATER: The Oxbow The Oxbow is a slice of the River turned on edge to illustrate the form of a meandering River through the landscape. The sculpture is two steel sections of the Raccoon River, placed back-to-back, the original form of the Oxbow from 1955 aerial photographs and the straightened engineered form of the River from aerial photos taken in 1998. An oxbow lake is a U-shaped body of water that forms when a wider meander from the main stem of a river is cut off, creating a free-standing body of water. This landform is so named for its distinctive curved shape, resembling the bow pin of an oxbow. Though the form in the “Oxbow” sculpture represents a classic oxbow shape of a river, in this case rather than creating a separate body of water from the River, the River and the space of the oxbow have been absorbed by the Lake. With civil engineering, the Raccoon River still runs free around Blue Heron Lake. The River is always moving and slightly changing its course. The oxbow in the River seasonally joins the Lake during peak periods of flow. EVEN WATER: The Water Table The Water Table is a bronze table-like form whose top surface is in the shape of Blue Heron Lake in the decade of 2011-2020. The shape of this lake is what most residents and visitors of West Des Moines probably understand as a “natural lake”, when in reality it is a lake whose form has been determined not only by natural forces, but by manipulation and engineering of the landscape that have brought the Lake into equilibrium with the River. At most the Lake is only 30-feet-deep, a depth set by the depth of the quarrying operation that formed its bottom. The depth has been magnified in the sculpture in order to create the thickness of the sculpture. The bronze sculpture depicts the lake and five small extensions that reach downward into the bedrock of the landscape. The five bronze extensions represent springs, fingers of the water table or aquifer below the Lake. In real life these provide a yearly flow of cold water through separations or cracks in the bedrock. This prevents the water from warming and creating the algae blooms that clog so many other lakes which do not have a supply of cold water to prevent its growth. The story of water in Iowa and on this particular site is much deeper. Hundreds of feet below the surface are a series of aquifers, like the layers of icing in a cake. These aquifers are underground rivers that sometimes surface as springs. As climate change warms the earth our population seeks clean water, many aquifers have been depleted of their supply of water. There are eight wells houses on the site that take water from the water table below Raccoon River Park. EVEN WATER: The Well The Well sculpture diagrams the ‘tapping’ of the water table for potable water. After drilling, the piping extends down to the bedrock where the water table rests. The eight small well houses located located near Raccoon River Park’s playing fields are equipped with piping extending into the earth. These wells are used to bring water into West Des Moines’s water system.\n\n2019\n\nPublic Art Collection, City of West Des Moines, Iowa\n\nBronze, Stainless Steel Site Specific Long-Term\n\nThe sculpture, Even Water, takes advantage of chronicling the use and movement of water throughout the Park, by selecting four major processes that are constantly influencing the Park and the greater Des Moines landscape. The events become moments rendered in bronze and mirrored polished stainless steel that are poetic interpretations of the natural course of water and its engineered systems in the landscape. The sculptures and poetry are a kind of rebus that must be experiential sum to the artwork. The sculptures define forms and processes that allow water to determined the landscape form and landscape process of Raccoon River Park. They are both natural and engineered structures. The combination of the \"natural\" and the man made hold the meaning and poetic resonance for peoples understanding of Raccoon River Park. The essential discovery is the confluence of engineering and landscape process. We thought we could determine nature and now we have.\n\nWest Des Moines 41.554517, -93.730772\n\nRaccoon River Park\n\nhttps://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Even-Water-by-Cliff-Garten.pdf 9679 Cliff Garten American born 1958 http://www.cliffgartenstudio.com\n\nArtist Cliff Garten has completed more than 50 sculptures throughout the U.S. and Canada in collaboration with significant architecture, landscape architecture, and engineering projects. While sought after for creating evocative and nuanced site-specific sculptures within the civic realm, Garten also maintains an independent studio practice creating small-scale sculptures and works on paper.\n\nGarten’s artistic approach toward civic sculpture explores the expressive potential of infrastructure. He places his sculpture within the everyday as a way to re-imagine how civic infrastructure might perform beyond its basic function. Garten believes that our infrastructure systems “have done a remarkable job of satisfying our needs, but not necessarily our desires.” The diversity and depth of his civic practice testify to his mastery of increasing the sculptural expression of engineered public structures and places. By connecting people to places through sculptural material, social history, and ecology, his civic sculptures locate the latent potential within a public space.\n\nIn recent years, Garten’s sculptural practice has resulted in the creation of finely mastered works on paper. Intrigued by the computer-generated construction drawings used to fabricate his monumental civic sculptures, he selects compositions to be transposed to paper. The resulting digital archival prints capture lines that are rendered so finely that they evanesce, with all the residual force and transparency of an X-ray.\n\nGarten has also developed a private body of work whose subject matter is a corollary to his public practice and is grounded in our human relationship to what he calls “an altered Nature.” The result is a series of studio sculptures, entitled Being and Home and I Love Nature, Nature Loves Me, that mediate the materiality of the way we reside. The installations question how we consume our resources through visual allegories that are as appealing as they are sinister. Just as Garten’s works on paper extend his use of digital engineering technology with surprisingly delicate and refined results, the studio sculptures investigate the conceptual underpinnings of his civic sculptures.\n\nGarten is the recipient of two Individual Artist Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Bush Foundation Fellowship for Individual Artists, the Bush Foundation Leadership Fellowship, and the Jerome Foundation Travelling Artist Grant.

The word Love in upper-case letters, arranged in a square with a tilted letter “O”. Beginning in 1964, Indiana began to create images and objects using the word LOVE. Indiana maintained that a single word could be a viable subject of art by harnessing its emotional charge and the power of language. With the universality of the word and subject in mind, the Museum of Modern Art selected his image of LOVE as its Christmas card in 1965, and the US Postal Service created a stamp with the image in 1973. It was quickly adopted by the “love generation” and enjoyed mass appeal, which continues today. Other works in the edition of this particular format and colors are in the collections of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and Tate Modern in London. Many museums around the world, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Brooklyn Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, National Gallery of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others, hold additional works by the artist. Many versions of Robert Indiana’s Love sculpture that exist worldwide (1969–1999). Here is the list. The first rendering of it in sculpture was made in 1970. Sculptural versions now appear in urban centers around the globe. Variants employ the Hebrew, Chinese, Italian and Spanish languages, as well as the original English language.\n\n1969-1999\n\nDes Moines Art Center Permanent Collections; Purchased with funds from John and Mary Pappajohn, 2019\n\nPainted Steel Sculpture Long-Term\n\n“Here the quartered field is filled with the four letters of love, as compactly and economically as possible, but with my interest in the circle still called to mind by the tilted ‘o’.\"\n\nIt all started with my being exposed to Christian Science as a child. At one time I was even a member of the Church. “Love” is the key word—it’s the only word that ever appears in a Christian Science church. No crucifixes, no baby Jesuses, no saints. Nothing except one word: “L-O-V-E.\" ...

Indiana defined himself as a “sign painter” because of his preference for iconic images of numbers and letters, often taken from the American signs around him. He became a prominent member of the Pop Art movement.\n\nHe is best known for his series of LOVE paintings and sculptures, which employed bold and colorful letter forms to spell out the word “love.” His LOVE paintings and sculptures have come to represent peace internationally.\n\nBorn Robert Earl Clark on September 13, 1928 in New Castle, IN, he adopted the name of his home state after serving in the US military. Indiana went on to receive his BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1954. Following the advice of his friend Ellsworth Kelly, the artist relocated to New York, setting up a studio in the Coenties Slip neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. It was here that Indiana became acquainted with a number of prominent artists, including Agnes Martin, Jack Youngerman, and James Rosenquist. Over the following decades his work became increasingly popular, with both his LOVE and HOPE motifs transformed into a number of public sculptures. In September 2013, the Whitney Museum of American Art opened “Robert Indiana: Beyond LOVE,” the artist’s first retrospective in New York.\n\n“Indiana’s famous image features the word L-O-V-E rendered in colorful capital letters, with the first two letters stacked on top of the other two, and the letter “O” tilted as if it were being swept off its feet. Since he designed the earliest versions, in the 1960s, the logo has acquired a life of its own, appearing on everything from posters and album covers to T-shirts and jewelry”, wrote . “Mr. Indiana called it the 20th century’s “most plagiarized work of art,” and he kept a collection of knockoffs in his home, a historic Victorian building, to prove it.”\n\n9492 Iron Tree Trunk https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/iron-tree-trunk/ Ai Weiwei “Iron Tree Trunk” (2015) a life-sized cast of a tree found in the Jiangxi Province of Weiwei’s native China, unites individual pieces of iron into a whole structure. Its size comes matched by small nuances, down to tree rings around the base and weathered cracks in the bark. This massive cast of a tree references both the cultural tradition of finding poetry and contemplation in natural phenomena. It also alludes to the challenges inherent in China’s rush to industrialization. The overall dimensions of Ai Weiwei’s “Iron Tree Trunk” (2015) is 198 × 76 3/4 × 39 3/8 in. (503 × 195 × 100 cm.) The artist cast this sculpture from the remains of a single large tree, so unlike some of his other tree works, which can be described as Frankenstein-like assemblages, this piece is more monolithic and naturalistic. In 2009, Ai Weiwei began collecting organic wood fragments from the mountainous regions of Jiangxi in southern China and meticulously constructing the roots and branches into intricate tree compositions. These monumental sculptures are based on a wooden predecessors and took years to compose. The trees complex, animated branches conjure images of dragons that recur throughout the Chinese visual tradition. The untreated surface evolves over time, developing an oxidized patina with even greater visual dimension. With these evocatively powerful works, Ai Weiwei creates a contemplative environment for the viewer, inviting reflection on their relationship to nature, culture, history, and self. From a distance they register as trees – but closer examination reveals a myriad of awkward cuts and stainless steel bolts which hold the sculptures together. Each is a metaphor for cultures and communities of widespread diversity brought together as a social whole is foundational to the artists intention. 2015\n\nDes Moines Art Center Permanent Collections; Purchased with funds from John and Mary Pappajohn, 2018.43\n\nCast Iron Outdoor Sculpture Long-Term 9487 Pappajohn Sculpture Park 41.58517704694221,-93.63457245361246\n\nSoutheast portion of Pappajohn Sculpture Park; along Locust Avenue, between 15th and 13th Streets in downtown Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH2xpfTVhQk 9487 Ai Weiwei Chinese b. 1957 Beijing, China https://www.aiweiwei.com\n\nAi Weiwei was born in Beijing, China in 1957. An outspoken human rights activist, Ai was arrested by Chinese authorities in April 2011 and held incommunicado for three months. Upon his release, he was prohibited from traveling abroad, engaging in public speech, and was subjected to continued government surveillance. Ai’s position as a provocateur and dissident artist informs the tenor and reception of much of his recent work. He is one of the leading cultural figures of his generation and serves as an example for free expression both in China and internationally.\n\nHe infuses his sculptures, photographs, performance and public artworks with political conviction and personal poetry, often making use of recognizable and historic Chinese art forms in critical examinations of a host of contemporary Chinese political and social issues. In his sculptural works he often uses reclaimed materials—ancient pottery and wood from destroyed temples—in a conceptual gesture that connects tradition with contemporary social concerns. He also employs sarcasm, juxtaposition, and repetition to reinvigorate the potency and symbolism of traditional images and to reframe the familiar with minimal means. He measures our existence in relation to economic, political, natural and social forces, uniting craftsmanship with conceptual creativity. Universal symbols of humanity and community, such as bicycles, flowers and trees, as well as the perennial problems of borders and conflicts are given renewed potency though installations, sculptures, films and photographs, while Ai continues to speak out publicly on issues he believes important. A writer and curator, Ai extends his practice across multiple disciplines and through social media to communicate with a global public and to engage fellow artists with projects on a massive scale..\n\nAi Weiwei attended the Beijing Film Academy and the Parsons School of Design in New York. He has received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Politics and Social Science, University of Ghent, Belgium (2010), as well as many awards, including the Skowhegan Medal (2011) and the Chinese Contemporary Art Award (2008). His work has appeared in major exhibitions at Kunsthaus Bregenz (2011); the Victoria & Albert Museum, London (2011); Asia Society Museum, New York (2011); Tate Modern, London (2010); São Paulo Bienal (2010); Haus der Kunst, Munich (2009); Mori Art Museum, Tokyo (2009); and Documenta XII (2007).\n\nLink on Twitter\n\n8898 Bus Wrap #10: Multiple Black https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/bus-wrap-10-multiple-black/ Mitchell Squire Created by artist Mitchell Squire, Multiple Black is the title of the tenth (10th) commission by the Greater Des Moines Public Art Foundation in collaboration with the DART (Des Moines Area Regional Transport Authority).

The bus travels approximately 27,000 miles per year or 2,250 miles per month into communities throughout Greater Des Moines. These routes include Ankeny, Altoona, Pleasant Hill, Des Moines, Grimes, Windsor Heights, West Des Moines, Clive, Urbandale and Johnston. Zigs Zag, Zags Zig was unveiled to the public on 13 March 2019 at DART Central Station.\n\nThe title of the design, Zigs Zag, Zags Zig, refers to the back and forth nature of this design. Formally the work uses two different line-based patterns (one soft and undulating the other hard and diagonal), the sawtooth triangles that serve to interrupt and define the patterns, and a binary palate of black and white to create a cacophony of movement and some level of disorientation for the viewer. Conceptually, the work is grounded in ideas of a more emotional back and forth and how one can vacillate between polarities of feelings in this current moment, and in this case places as they travel to and from on the bus.\n\nDisruption coloration is found in many species of animals were the bold pattern actually confuses the eye of other animals who cannot distinguish the pattern from the background. In this case, the weaving structure of a twill pattern (think denim jeans) is enlarged and layered with a photograph of undulating striped fabric. Foreground becomes background and background foreground as the viewers eye searches for a resting spot. The imagery of the undulating cloth creates movement and dimension while the flatter twill pattern creates a strong diagonal. These patterns are about textiles systems but also about math and geometry. The zig zag shape is derived from the flat pattern of an icosahedron, one the five regular platonic solids and essential shape in the expensive fields of geometry, philosophy and astronomy. I am specifically interested how the geometric principles of 3-d form making relate to textile logic systems; both the structural integrity of woven cloth and the decorative patterning.\n\n2019\n\nCommissioned by Greater Des Moines Public Art Foundation, 2018\n\nDigital Image on Vinyl Site Specific Short-Term\n\nMy work pays homage to sophisticated textile traditions including age-old indigenous processes in form-making and domestic hand-spun textile production. It is equally informed by the Platonic geometry used in architectural forms and sculptures pioneered by American architect Buckminster Fuller. Mathematics is at the heart of these systems of logic – both pliable textiles and Platonic solids – and serves as the springboard for bold, material-based explorations. Between the inflated scale and bold patterns this work destabilizes conventional gender based value systems of hard and soft form-making, and encourages a deep engagement with our material world.\n\nGreater Des Moines 41.5834591, -93.62443310000003\n\nA different bus route each day begins on 620 Cherry Street at the DART Central Station in downtown Des Moines.

First held in 1973, RAGBRAI is the largest bike-touring event in the world.\n\nThe Register is Iowa’s largest and most influential newspaper and RAGBRAI has become a Register tradition. The Register’s sponsorship of RAGBRAI – began in 1973 when writer John Karras challenged columnist Donald Kaul to do a border-to-border bicycle ride across Iowa.\n\nJohn Karras\n\nJohn Karras (born 1930), an avid bicyclist, is a former feature writer/copy editor for the Des Moines Register. Karras suggested to Kaul that he ride his bicycle across Iowa and write columns about what he saw from that perspective. Karras made up the name, with its unwieldy acronym as something of a joke. “RAGBRAI”, that is. There from the start, in 1973, a co-host up to the present and Karras has been a participant in most of the rides.\n\nDonald Kaul\n\nDonald Kaul (December 25, 1934 – July 22, 2018), also an accomplished rider, is an American journalist and pundit, and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1987 and 1999. Kaul retired after three decades writing opinion columns, mainly for the Des Moines Register, where he established his liberal and satirical style.\n\n2020\n\nCommissioned by RAGBRAI in collaboration with Greater Des Moines Public Art Foundation\n\nBronze, Steel Outdoor Sculpture Long-Term\n\nI sculpt to achieve a visceral response. My core purpose is to inspire, teach and heal through art. We can feel and immerse ourselves in an experience simply through what our eyes experience. Victory, laughter, camaraderie, glory, defeat, the pain of loss, or celebration of life are energies I breathe into and instill in my art. I want to share a passion and experience in a way that affects everyone. I engage imaginations.\n\nThe work presented here illustrates my ability to communicate ideas, capture the essence of a moment and provoke mental dialog. There has been no more profound sensation of success than the response from people who have sought me out to express how my art has resonated with them and why. I am known for powerful and moving monumental imagery. I am an athlete and an artist moved by all that is human in body and spirit.

As a result, pumpkins, usually covered in the artist’s signature fields of polka dots, have appeared in her art since she was a young girl. “It seems pumpkins do not inspire much respect,” Kusama once said. “But I was enchanted by their charming and winsome form. What appealed to me most was the pumpkin’s generous unpretentiousness.” These words also seem an apt description of Pumpkin (L), an 8 foot bronze celebrating the undulating curves of a ripe pumpkin. Accentuated with trails of polka dots, the giant gourd looks like it might come from a fairy tale landscape. As is the case with most fairy tales, uncanny or even menacing undertones may be found in this sculpture, evident in its large scale, dark colors, and the vining, fertile nature of the pumpkin itself. Many viewers will make associations with playful Halloween celebrations and the autumn harvest, lending the work a familiarity and “unpretentiousness” that can be found in much of Kusama’s work. The overall dimensions of Pumpkin (L) is 94 7/8 × 92 1/2 × 92 1/2 in., 3306.9 lb. (241 × 235 × 235 cm., 1500 kg.)

Constructed and animated images colorfully and dramatically transform the facade of a building in downtown Des Moines.\n\n“Mental Banquet: Painting with Lights” was presented at 8 PM, Sunday evening, 14 October 2018 and projected again at 9 PM on Tuesday evening, 16 October 2018. Admission was free for both public events. The experience was a thrilling visionary feast between real architecture and a virtual tale. The October 16 presentation coincided with the United Nations’ annual celebration of “World Food Day.”\n\n“Mental Banquet” was designed for the east-facing facade of the World Food Prize Hall of Laureates on the west bank of the Des Moines River at 100 Locust Street in downtown Des Moines (see “About the Site”.) The project was viewed from any area with an unobstructed view of the east exterior face of the building.\n\nOyoram’s process of mapping architecture expanded the conventional projection of content matching the size of the building structure. “Mental Banquet” captured the space, the architecture details, and the ambiance that emerged from the location.\n\nA groundbreaking spectacle, “Mental Banquet: Painting with Lights,” engaged the public with an expression of rhythm and form that also revealed a story about the site. The building’s historical function as a library and cultural center melded into a new vision of honoring individual advancements in improving the global food supply. “Mental Banquet” expressed the acts of going, growing, changing, and the processing of time.\n\n“Oyoram is well known for his off-screen digital projections,” said M. Jessica Rowe, director of Greater Des Moines Public Art Foundation. “The project was a standout, and reflected the artist’s interest in complex systems of aesthetics, architecture and technology.”\n\nEmbodying artistic traditions of teamwork to unparalleled extents, Oyoram’s Mental Banquet: Painting with Lights (2018) celebrated both the triumph of technology and the splendor of our natural world. The artist combined his aesthetic from nature’s formal beauty and exuberant ornamentation with the Beaux-arts building. The dimensions of the project Mental Banquet: Painting with Lights— approximately 72 x 164 feet (22 x 50 meters) — mirrored the dimensions of the east facade of the Hall of Laureates.\n\nABOUT THE SITE\n\nDesigned in 1899 by Architects Smith & Gutterson as the main branch of Des Moines Public Library, this restored Beaux-Arts style building is today known as The World Food Prize Hall of Laureates. The ornamented facade includes classical details and sculptural enrichments, such as symmetrical arched and pedimented doors, columns and windows. The building was built in 1900-03 as part of a plan to develop the riverfront in Des Moines. It is located at 100 Locust Street, along the Principal Riverwalk between Walnut and Locust Streets in the heart of the city.\n\n2018\n\nGreater Des Moines Public Art Foundation organized and funded the October 14 and 16, 2018 presentation, with in-kind support from CLE Productions, Ruan Transportation Management Systems, Inc., and The World Food Prize Foundation for access to the east facade of Hall of Laureates.\n\nArchitectural mapping projection Moving Image and Sound Archive\n\nAbout 17,000 years ago, a few highly skilled homo sapiens artists were doing what I am trying to do today: tell a story by painting and engraving on stone walls. The art was discovered in 1940, in Lascaux cave in Dordogne, a region in southwest France. After Picasso visited the cave in the 1950’s, he reportedly emerged and exclaimed: “We have invented nothing.” Miró once said, “Painting has been in a state of decadence since the age of caves.”\n\nBut I have been intrigued by more than the value of cave paintings. These were drawn about 14,000 years before the invention of writing!... What a long learning process to transform visual drawings into symbols - letters - words and sentences with meaning.\n\nObserving our way of life today, at first I was worried: we are reading less and less, we are using icons, short messages and bird sounds to communicate. We no longer use our pen and even our purchases are signed with a finger. On second thought and maybe third, I changed my mind. Maybe we are not regressing, maybe we are in a process of elaborating a new language that will include literal and pictorial fragments; a universal language of the mind transcends countries and cultural borders.\n\nToday the cave’s stone has become a building and I am drawing visual poetry using\n\nlight rays on its façade that, similar to a human face, has a lot to reveal.\n\nSeptember 22, 2018\n\nPrincipal Riverwalk 41.587679, -93.618699\n\nThe east façade, The World Food Prize, Hall of Laureates, 100 Locust Street, Des Moines, Iowa\n\nhttps://luxtown.art/sample 8602 Yorame Mevorach American, French, Israeli born Jerusalem 1951 https://luxtown.art\n\nYorame Mevorach (also known as Oyoram) is a Franco-Israeli artist and filmmaker. Born in Jerusalem in 1951, he first studied engineering, but was quickly drawn to the cinema. He received an undergraduate degree in film at Beit Zvi School for the Performing Arts in Ramat Gan, and moved to Paris where he studied cinematic theory at the Sorbonne (Université Sorbonne Nouvelle – Paris III).\n\nBy 1984, he had established his reputation as producer and director with the legendary satirical French magazine, Hara Kiri/Charlie Hebdo and created the first original fiction made for the emergent video-cassettes market in France (a box office success).\n\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, Oyoram developed a unique cinematographic language on the margins of the French film industry. His principal preoccupations were short length films, often made for French television. In addition to innovations in the narrative formats, there were important formal innovations related to his preoccupation with the place of the spectator in the space where the films were projected. His large scale installations led to films which allowed the viewer a greater degree of autonomy.\n\nIn 1993, Oyoram founded a company Cinéma hors écran (Offscreen Motion Pictures) not only to continue with his experimentation into the narrative dimensions of the medium but also into the forms going beyond the mechanics of the cinematic language to imagine “film” projected into a variety of new settings.\n\nPierre-Henri Deleau, co-founder “la Quinzaine des Réalisateurs” at the Cannes Festival, said that Oyoram’s art, “leaves open the question as to whether he is a poet making films or a filmmaker making poetry.”\n\nTwo years after founding Cinéma hors écran, Oyoram entered into a partnership with the LVMH group which allowed him unprecedented freedom to continue his tireless effort to expand the physical, technical and conceptual boundaries of film.\n\nHis visual art work has been commissioned by prestigious companies including Cartier, Van Cliff & Arpel, Sony, and Louis Vuitton.\n\nOyoram’s visual inventions have included small eye-glass lenses used to reveal the wearer’s subjective viewpoint to a 15 meter high clock, a spectacular metaphor dramatizing time as a circus ring. A designer, script-writer, and director, Oyoram experiments with immersive cinematic experiences as in the 2003 traveling exhibit Diamonds and the Power of Love shown in Tokyo, Las Vegas and Paris, featuring 11 mannequins brought to life by the magic of image- projection. In Retrophobies, a composition of 26 films simultaneously playing on large screens, Oyoram fused art and technology to invent “Vunettes” for an individual audio-visual experience in a public space. He also pioneered the seamless mix of painted canvas and moving images in Double You See, a traveling exhibition shown in 2006-2007 in Paris and Hamburg. Since 2007, when he imagined into creation “virtual windows” in the famous rotunda Dior Avenue Montaigne, Oyoram has designed monumental visual moving fresques for Dior.\n\nWith the completion of his studio in D"
