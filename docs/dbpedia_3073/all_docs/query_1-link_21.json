However, they still made a phenomenal picture and one that I don’t think I would rate lower if I didn’t know this amazing cast and crew.\n\nTo begin, the script is an incredibly impressive one and I don’t want to spoil it. What I will say is the characters and their connections are ones that were incredibly satisfying to see how they all intertwined. Second, these people can act. Even though many are friends or friends of friends, I was still able to be pulled into this world.\n\nI can’t believe just what these people were able to accomplish. Not only did they make a feature length film, but they made a damn good one. I knew these people had a future, but they have made their mark and are great talent. Congratulations."
