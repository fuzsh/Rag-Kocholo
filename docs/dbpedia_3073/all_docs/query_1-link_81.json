        "text": "Wrath of an Angry God\n\nby Gibson Michaels\n\nSeries: The Sentience Trilogy, #3<Kindle Edition, 340 pg.\n\nArc Flash Publishing, 2015\n\nRead: March 4 – 5, 2017\n\nI’m posting this because: 1. I didn’t want to look like I was abandoning this series on a whim. 2. If I’m going to say that I’m going to finish books that authors give me, I’d better have a reason for not sticking with that.\n\nI’m not posting this because I want to trash Mr. Michaels or his work. I am curious about what happens at the end of this series — I’ve read about 978 pages of it, and on the whole, have enjoyed it.\n\nSo why am I not finishing this? Because frankly, I don’t care what the justification you give (and I can think of several), raping your wife for her own good (at best) or to get her to conform to cultural norms (at worse) is just not something I’m going to read."
