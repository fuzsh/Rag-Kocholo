After two tough years in Chicago, the Solomon family retreats to a desolate sunflower farm in North Dakota. Their new calm of farm life is shattered when 16-year-old Jess (Twilight's Kristen Stewart) and her two year old brother Ben begin to see nightmarish apparitions, visions that nobody else can see. Jess must battle with forces far from beyond the grave in a desperate hope to save her family and prove her sanity. The godfathers of modern horror, Danny and Oxide Pang (The Eye), make their highly anticipate English-language debut alongside acclaimed producer Sam Raimi (The Grudge, The Evil Dead). The Messengers is a tense and terrifying blend of American horror and Asian extreme cinema.
