Poon will produce alongside Zachary Green, Leon Tong and Kat Goh.\n\nPHOTOS: 35 of 2014’s Most Anticipated Movies: ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past,’ ‘Mockingjay,’ ‘Spider-Man 2’\n\nTong is set to start shooting in May in Singapore. In the vein of The Ring and The Grudge, Email stars Reed as a young journalist who travels to Singapore to investigate the mysterious circumstances of her sister’s death and discovers a string of bizarre killings involving a cursed email. Along the way she meets Ted, an ex-pat technology reporter, and together they face the supernatural forces and unravel a mysterious conspiracy far bigger than they expected.\n\nJason Shuman, whose credits include horror hit The Messengers, and Lauren Selig will executive produce.\n\nReed has two films now in postproduction: Scout, in which she stars opposite Ellen Burstyn and Jane Seymour, and Murder of a Cat, starring Greg Kinnear, Blythe Danner and J.K. Simmons."
