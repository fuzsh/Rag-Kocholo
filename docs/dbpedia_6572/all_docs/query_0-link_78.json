        "text": "Ghost House Pictures principal and filmmaker Sam Raimi has announced (via THR) that he'll produce a new supernatural horror project called Refuge. The film is based on a pitch by up-and-coming British director Corin Hardy about a remote town terrorized by a Yeti, the mythological creature native to the mountains of the Himalayas. Hardy will direct from a script by fellow British writer Tom de Ville, whose only credits are the TV shows \"Urban Gothic\" and \"Lexx.\" Hardy and De Ville are also working on a short film with the same premise that is designed to help Hardy refine his vision while the script is being written.\n\nSteve Zeitchik over on THR compares this mentorship to that of Guillermo del Toro, who finds great up-and-coming filmmakers and helps produce and develop their projects so that they'll have a chance to take off. Raimi has previously produced horror films like The Grudge, The Messengers, and 30 Days of Night. I don't even know why, but I'm intrigued by a yeti concept that will hopefully be high quality. Other memorable yeti appearances recently include in the atrocious The Mummy 3 and the straight-to-DVD film Yeti, although I never saw either of those, hence why I hope this will be much better. Stay tuned for updates."
