        "text": "When you think of the full moon, what comes to mind? Werewolves, perhaps? Understandable. But what about …corn? September’s full moon is commonly known as the Harvest Moon, but it also has another nickname: The Corn Moon. To celebrate the end of September, here are 13 cornfield horror movies you can watch during tonight’s Corn Moon!\n\nHere they are, in no particular order other than the first one…\n\n1. Children of the Corn (1984)\n\nYou knew this was going to be on the list, so why not put it at the top, right? Based on Stephen King’s short story, Children of the Corn is perhaps the most iconic corn-related horror movie. It’s about a cult of children who worship a malevolent entity in a cornfield known as He Who Walks Behind the Rows.\n\nThese kids aren’t your typical playground buddies; they’re ruthless, religious zealots who believe that sacrificing adults to the cornfield is the path to salvation. The cornfield itself becomes a character in the story, serving as both the backdrop and a primary source of horror in the film. The towering stalks hide the children as they carry out their deadly rituals, making the vast fields feel like a maze of menace. The isolation and eerie silence of the cornfields intensify the feeling of dread, amplifying every scare.\n\nIt’s no wonder Stephen King seems to have a thing for corn and cornfields! There’s one more of his adaptations on this list, but there could have been many more if I hadn’t shown some restraint. Speaking of which, be sure to check out Stephen King’s bleak 1922, which features cornfields quite heavily, as well as the absolutely hilarious death-by-corncob scene in Sleepwalkers.\n\n2. Husk (2011)\n\nIn Husk, a group of friends embarks on a road trip and ends up stranded in the middle of nowhere. Their luck takes a gruesome turn when they stumble upon a seemingly abandoned farm surrounded by endless rows of corn. The idyllic setting quickly turns into a nightmare, and not just because they’re lost.\n\nWhat’s truly unnerving about Husk is the contrast between the natural beauty of the cornfields and the potentially supernatural(?!) horror that lurks within. As the friends venture deeper into the maze-like expanse of the cornfield, they realize they’re not alone. But who—or what—is out there with them?\n\n3. The Fields (2011)\n\nSet in rural Pennsylvania in the early 1970s, The Fields follows the story of a young boy named Steven, who is sent to stay with his grandparents on their corn farm for the summer.\n\nAs you’d expect, the cornfields quickly become more than just a scenic backdrop. They transform into a foreboding maze of horror as strange occurrences and unexplainable events begin to plague Steven and his family. The rows of corn hide unsettling secrets and are the key to solving a sinister mystery\n\nBased on a true story, The Fields turns the peaceful farm life and the beauty of cornfields into true nightmare fuel. It’s a reminder that even the most serene settings can hide the darkest of secrets.\n\n4. Scarecrows (1988)\n\nThe premise of Scarecrows is deceptively simple: a group of bank robbers, on the run with their ill-gotten gains, hijacks a plane and forces it to land in a remote cornfield. As they seek refuge and a way out, they stumble upon an old farmhouse surrounded by creepy scarecrows. But these aren’t your typical stuffed shirts on sticks; they’re sinister, supernatural beings.\n\nWhile the title beings definitely take center stage, as you watch (or rewatch) this 1988 horror oddity, pay close attention to why it’s also a great cornfield horror movie. The robbers are trapped in a claustrophobic prison of corn and the straw-stuffed wardens are out to enact brutal justice!\n\n5. Pearl (2022)\n\nA prequel to Ti West’s X, Mia Goth turns in an award-worthy performance as the title character in this slasher that’s destined to become a modern classic.\n\nNearly all of Pearl takes place in, around, or near cornfields. Including one especially memorable sexually-charged dance with the scarecrow who resides within the field. Yikes!\n\n6. Scarecrow (2002)\n\nScarecrow revolves around a college fraternity prank that goes horribly wrong. In an attempt to scare a fellow student, the pranksters disturb a cursed cornfield. The film’s brilliance lies in its ability to subvert expectations, especially at the time. Scarecrow takes a familiar setting—the picturesque cornfield—and transforms it into a landscape where every corner hides a new horror and serves as both a trap and a battleground for the characters.\n\nHonestly, Scarecrow mostly terrible but in a really fun way (a perfect example of “so bad it’s good”). It’s early 2000’s nostalgia from the fashions to the fact we thought 40-year-olds made passable “just gradated from high school” college freshman. It’s also notable for starring scream queen Tiffany Shepis and Richard Elfman (brother of Danny Elfman). It’s a great pick if you’re gathered together with your friends for a few beers during tonight’s Corn Moon!\n\n7. The Messengers 2: The Scarecrow (2009)\n\nThe Messengers 2: The Scarecrow is a 2009 horror film that serves as a prequel to the original The Messengers (2007). In this prequel, the film explores the backstory of the malevolent supernatural entities featured in the first movie.\n\nBut, while the first film had fields of sunflowers, this one takes place primarily in cornfields! One of the most memorable scenes in The Messengers 2: The Scarecrow involves a thrilling and suspenseful chase through a cornfield. And it features Norman Reedus AKA Daryl Dixon from The Walking Dead!\n\nThe Messengers 2 is filled with suspense, fear, and a sense of isolation. Plus it showcases Norman Reedus’ ability to deliver a compelling and tense performance while surrounded by corn.\n\n8. Jeepers Creepers II (2003)\n\nIn Jeepers Creepers II, a group of high school students and their coach find themselves trapped on a school bus in the middle of a remote cornfield. Their situation becomes increasingly dire as they realize they are being hunted by the Creeper, a winged, supernatural creature in a big floppy hat that emerges every 23 years to feed on human body parts.\n\nThe cornfield scenes in Jeepers Creepers II are a standout element of the film, adding both depth and intensity to the horror narrative. They demonstrate how the setting itself can become a character in a horror story, contributing to the overall atmosphere of dread and fear and are a big part of why this sequel might just outshine the original!\n\n9. Halloween II (2009)\n\nIn this sequel to Rob Zombie’s 2007 reboot of John Carpenter’s classic, we find Laurie Strode (played by Scout Taylor-Compton) grappling with the traumatic aftermath of her first encounter with Michael Myers. As the story unfolds, the tranquil countryside of Haddonfield, Illinois becomes a haunting backdrop. Among the standout scenes is one set in a cornfield.\n\nThe cornfield sequence is a masterclass in building suspense within the confines of the seemingly endless rows of cornstalks. As Laurie navigates the labyrinthine cornfield, she’s pursued by her own demons and the relentless Michael Myers. The cornfield becomes a place of terror, where every rustle of the leaves and whisper of the wind intensifies the dread.\n\nNot everyone appreciates Rob Zombie’s reimagining of horror staples, but when watching Halloween II during the Corn Moon, be prepared to see cornfields in a whole new, spine-tingling light.\n\n10. A Quiet Place (2018)\n\nA Quiet Place is set in a post-apocalyptic world where most of humanity has been wiped out by mysterious and deadly creatures that hunt by sound. The film follows a family, the Abbotts, as they struggle to survive in this silent and perilous world.\n\nThis may be the absolute peak of suspenseful cornfield horror movies! As members of the family find themselves having to move through a cornfield, every rustle of the cornstalks and every creak of the earth under their feet could alert the nearby creatures.\n\nThe silence is deafening, and every step feels like it could be someone’s last. The cornfield, while not the primary setting of the film, becomes a treacherous obstacle course where every move must be calculated to avoid making a sound.\n\nWhat makes this scene so effective is the combination of visual storytelling and the use of sound, or rather the lack thereof. The audience is acutely aware of the danger, and every moment feels like a heart-pounding race against time. Without giving away too many spoilers, the cornfield scene is a pivotal moment in the film and showcases the creativity and skill of the filmmakers. It’s a must watch, even for those who don’t normally like horror movies.\n\n11. Signs (2002)\n\nSigns is a sci-fi horror thriller film directed by M. Night Shyamalan and starring Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, and Rory Culkin. The film revolves around a family living on a farm in rural Pennsylvania and their encounters with mysterious crop circles appearing in their cornfield.\n\nThe cast turn in great performances and if you don’t think TOO hard about the “twist,” you’ll have a great time.\n\n12. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019)\n\nA horror anthology film, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark centers on a group of friends who uncover a cursed book filled with terrifying tales that become real as they’re read. One of these tales unleashes Harold, a scarecrow that will haunt your dreams for decades.\n\nScarecrows and cornfields just seem to go together, don’t they? Like Harold and childhood trauma. The special FX for Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark are taken right from the pages of the illustrations from the book the film is based on and they do not disappoint!\n\n13. Secret Window (2004)\n\nEnding this list is another entry from Stephen King: Secret Window.\n\nJohnny Depp plays Mort Rainey, a depressed writer who decides to isolate himself in a cabin to work on his next book after his marriage fell apart. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nA cornfield plays a significant role in the ending scenes of Secret Window and, more importantly, Johnny Depp’s Mort reminds us just how delicious freshly harvested corn can be!\n\nSo, grab some buttered corn on the cob, an elote, or just some popcorn and enjoy some cornfield horror movies tonight when September’s Corn Moon rises!\n\nImages were purchased via MovieStillsDB and Cinematerial."
