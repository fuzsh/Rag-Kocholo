        "text": "The arguments presented in this book are clear and organized in a logical manner. Among the different writers whose works are featured in the book, they offer different examples to explore the genre of horror films from different perspectives. The writers also attempt to explain the how modern day horror film are related to certain themes of blood and gore, and the relationships between pornography and horror film among other things.\n\nHorror films in the 1950s were very different from those in modern times, as 1960’s Psycho is often credited as the father of modern horror film. 50s horror films would often fit into the science fiction or thriller genres today. The 50s were known as the “Monster Movie decade”, as films often used aliens and monsters to reflect communism or fascism, fears reminiscent of the era (American Movie Classics Company LLC, 2017). The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) was released in 3-D and used a foam and latex suit to create one of film’s most famous monsters- Gill-Man (see image 10) (American Movie Classics Company LLC, 2017). The suit was very realistic for its time and is often cited as a landmark for visual effects. GOJIRA: FIND SFX STUFF\n\nThere are many risk factors that had been associated with home invasion. The first risk factor will be vulnerable, this one the risk factors the offender target their victim by if the person is vulnerable. The offender wants the victim to be vulnerable because the, “robbers confront victims for longer periods of time and try to avoid being injured, they are likely to prefer occupants who will not resist an attack” (Heinonen, & Eck, n.d.). The next thing the offender look for is insecure. The robber wants to do a home invasion on a person or people who have insecure it has attracted the offender on, “based on the security of people in their home, about which they may not always be certain” ( Heinonen,& Eck,n.d.).Consistent plays a major part\n\nHi Jamuna, thank you for your sharing. I read all our classmates' responses, and I decided to come back to comment your response because you picked one of my favorite's horror movies. I like the way you describe the poster very details. The main colors of the poster are dark gray and black. The little girl wears a white dress, hold a doll, which is Annabella, and carry a lamp. The background is also dark and dull with a house and a tree. That build the movie's story and creates a fear to audiences because that is not a good idea to see a girl on the outside of the house in the midnight. I agree with you that the filmmakers try to reflect the horror shape to the poster, and it works. I do not know I cannot open your link. It maybe dead, I guess.\n\nAmerican horror films have often played on our societal fears, and in Candyman (Bernard Rose, 1992), the film directly deals with race, reminding us that it is still very much a problem in society today, and that ‘our traumatic racial past still haunts us’ (Vern, 2015). The film ‘marks the introduction of an African-American monster to the horror mainstream’ (Donaldson, 2011) and it ‘succeeds in asking some very pointed questions about race and class’ (Elizabeth, 1992). Ultimately this is done by investigating ‘the obscure fears we harbour about the unknown’ – or the racial ‘other’ (Blackwell, 2015). Andrew Tudor says that ‘typically, a horror movie will exploit the tensions implicit in a particular contrast, confronting known with the\n\nMost modern scary movies are jam packed with gushing gore, high-pitched screaming, and fascinating special effects. The storylines are super predictable of modern horror movies. In the film The Haunting based on the book by Shirley Jackson by not once do you see a ghost or blood, but it is just as, if not more, frightening as any other movie. The Haunting plays with your mind. This movie will definitely make you think twice about everything you observe while watching it. This movie made me ponder on everyday life. What truly is our reality? Are people we see as “mentally ill” the ones who are actually experiencing the true reality of the world? How do I know my reality is the same as everyone else's?\n\nHorror films have been around for over 100 years, petrifying people and bringing their worst fears to life but still they can’t get enough of this sick and gory genre that is unbelievably entertaining and captivating to the audience. Horror comes with many sub-genres from your bloody slashers like Friday the 13th to your Supernatural-Horrors like The Exorcist, but in the end they all seem to do their job by scaring you and leaving you with nightmares for weeks on end. Usually Horror’s films have the same character stereotypes such as the nerd, the jock, the slut, the virgin, the junky, the tough hero, the unlikely hero and last but not least the masked murderer, but yet they all play their own part in the making of these horrors movies whether it is the extremely slow walk the killer does but almost always catches the victim, or the unwise decision to split up and investigate where the unusual noise is coming from.\n\nAmazingly, I don’t know how I am still alive. Being the idiot that I am, I decided it was a good idea to play with a ouija board. Calling spirits out to get me seemed like a pretty fun idea until I realized that I had goofed up.Demons were harassing me from all angles, throwing books at me and destroying plates while flickering the lights on and off over and over again, I seriously thought it was the end of me.Extreme precautions were something I seriously overlooked and I honestly regretted it that night and I will probably take them next time.\n\nFor Cohen & Felson’s Routine Activity Theory (1979), predatorial crime occurs from the presence of three underpinning variables/elements of motivated offenders, suitable targets and an absence of capable guardians (Cohen & Felson, 1979). Applying these variables/elements to the circumstances of the local burglary offences identifies the offences to be predominantly occurring to suitable targets of multi-story residential apartments, where offenders have gained access by climbing several stories or a drain pipe, with no resident present in the dwelling (absence of capable guardians) and in an area populated with motivated offenders being refugees and housing commission residents (Cohen & Felson, 1979; QPS, 2017). Further to this, the theorists who developed Routine Activity Theory (Cohen & Felson, 1979) also propose that changes to everyday activities explain the causation of a trending crime rate (Jones, 2013). In relation to the local burglary offences, the offence dates ranged between 18 January 2017 to 1 February 2017, being the end of the December school holidays (QPS, 2017). This presents a time period whereby residents are returning to work and school, leaving their dwellings unattended which demonstrates a change in everyday activities (Jones,\n\nHaving Halloween just around the corner the horror genre has been on demand. What is a horror genre? Horror is defined as being “an intense feeling of fear, shock, or disgust” and genre is defined as being “a category of artistic composition, as in music or literature, characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter” according to Oxford Dictionary. Therefore a horror genre is a horror film in one of the many categories in a genre that makes the audience feel fear, shock or disgust. Many of the films that everyone watches today are now called movies. Since scary movies have been requested, Netflix has even added a “Halloween favorites” on its search bar.\n\nHorror films are movies that aim to elicit a strong physiological reaction in the viewer, such as raised heartbeat and fear. Three horror films by the names of Psycho, Scream and The Messengers will be analysed and compared to an episode of the popular children’s show Shaun the Sheep. Five elements will be addressed in this analysis, those being camera techniques, Mise-en-scene, Editing, Lighting and Sound.\n\nSpecial effects have become essential to horror movies because it has allowed for filmmakers to incorporate more creative ways to make their horror movies more interesting and immersive to viewers. However, it has also allowed for horror movies to become some of the costliest projects to produce and have even allowed for some independent companies not to secure the needed funds to continue making horror movies. This has caused for some people to oppose the use of special effects because the increased cost of special effects has allowed for only the big-name and high-budget companies to survive and not allow for independent companies to be able to compete with them. Additionally, people have also started opposing special effects due to the increased\n\nHorror films were not rejected from mainstream society the same way that exploitation films were. Horror films usually did not have big Hollywood stars. They were considered feature films that had a stronger focus on settings and characters. The themes that were dealt with in the horror realm tended to be psychological and based on present day fears. The themes included death, fear of science and fear of losing\n\nGenres are categorized in several ways. The use of genre is important in film because producers believe it would be good for marketing. There are different types of films. Action films is where the protagonist is involve in physical fights or chases. Adventure films involve the explorations the protagonist has throughout the story. Comedy films is mainly about humor.
