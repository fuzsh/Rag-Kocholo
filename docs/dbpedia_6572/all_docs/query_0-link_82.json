        "text": "If you haven’t yet seen A24 and Saint Maud director Rose Glass’ new movie Love Lies Bleeding, you should definitely get out there and support it in theaters while you can. The critically acclaimed romantic thriller is one of this year’s best movies so far, driven by incredible lead performances from Katy O’Brian and the always compelling Kristen Stewart.\n\nKaty O’Brian just landed a huge role in Mission Impossible 8, but what’s next for Kristen Stewart? Well, for starters, don’t expect to see her in any Marvel movies anytime soon.\n\nStewart tells the “Not Skinny but Not Fat” podcast, “I will likely never do a Marvel movie … it sounds like a fucking nightmare, actually.” She further explains, “You would have to put so much money and so much trust into one person … and it doesn’t happen.”\n\n“And so therefore what ends up happening is this algorithmic, weird experience where you can’t feel personal at all about it. So likely not,” Kristen Stewart continues in her chat with the podcast. “But maybe the world changes, that’s what I’m saying.” She notes, however, “if Greta Gerwig asked me to do a Marvel movie, then I would do it.”\n\nSo what DOES Kristen Stewart want to do next? Chatting with Variety on the red carpet just a couple months back, she indicated that she’s far more interested in horror than Marvel!\n\n“I’d like to make a good scary movie,” Stewart answered when asked what she’d like to do next. “Like something a little more psychological. Yeah, a really good horror movie.”\n\nKristen Stewart is of course no stranger to the horror/thriller genres, getting her start as a child actor in David Fincher’s Panic Room. From there, she starred in 2007 horror movie The Messengers, as well as the Twilight movies, ghost story Personal Shopper, and 2018’s Lizzie. And don’t forget 2020’s Underwater or David Cronenberg’s Crimes of the Future.\n\nThe ball is in your court, filmmakers. Let’s make it happen.\n\nThe first film in the Predator franchise in the wake of Disney taking over 20th Century Fox, Prey went direct-to-Hulu back in 2022, but the Alien franchise’s first film under the Disney umbrella is getting a big theatrical release this weekend. But that wasn’t always the case.\n\nAs you may recall, Alien: Romulus was originally announced as a Hulu movie, and director Fede Alvarez explains what changed – and when it changed – in a new chat with Variety.\n\nIt was back in 2021 that Alien: Romulus was planning a Hulu debut, which Alvarez says was “a reaction to theaters being completely gone” at the time, deep in the heart of the pandemic.\n\n“That decision was not made at the point where theaters were healthy,” Alvarez explains to Variety. “[But] it was always going to be an ambitious movie for [a streaming] platform.”\n\nHe continues, “I remember making an announcement to everybody that this movie was going in theaters, and there was a big cheer. I was like, wow, even the gaffer cares that this goes into theaters!”\n\nThe pivot to theatrical for Alien: Romulus looks to have been a smart one on the part of 20th Century Studios, as the film opened to $6.5 million in Thursday previews last night.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter notes, “Romulus bit off a strong $6.5 million in Thursday previews, putting the highly anticipated August event on course to open to a better-than-expected $40 million-plus in another win for the Disney film empire and the summer box office overall.”\n\nIn Alien: Romulus, “While scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonizers come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe.”\n\nCailee Spaeny (The Craft: Legacy, Pacific Rim Uprising) leads the cast alongside Isabela Merced, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Spike Fearn and Aileen Wu.\n\nFede Alvarez co-wrote the script with Rodo Sayagues (Evil Dead). Ridley Scott is on board as producer for the film, the first movie in the franchise to be released by Disney.\n\nAlien: Romulus is based on characters created by Dan O’Bannon and Ronald Shusett."
