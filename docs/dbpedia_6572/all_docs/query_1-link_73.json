        "text": "It was December of 1996. As a sixteen-year old movie nerd and a growing box office pundit, there was no movie I was excited for more than Mars Attacks!. Yes, I mean Tim Burton's big budget sci-fi comedy ode to a series of ghoulish cult trading cards. The film featured an all star cast and was Burton's return to live-action blockbuster filmmaking four years after Batman Returns broke records but cashed out in record speed partially due to controversy over its violence and sexual content. Starring Jack Nicholson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Glenn Close, Michael J. Fox , and Pierce Brosnan among others, the picture was Warner Bros./ Time Warner Inc.'s big would-be blockbuster for the year-end season.\n\nSurely if I and the other film geeks I found on the (relatively new) Internet were thrilled about this one that meant that the populace at large would be too, right? But then the weekend of December 13th came and went, and no one went to Mars Attacks!. The film, which I loved upon seeing it at a paid sneak preview over Thanksgiving weekend, earned just $9.3 million on opening weekend and eventually cashed out with just $37m domestic and $101m worldwide on a (depending on who you asked) $70-$100m budget. It was a potent lesson for a die-hard Tim Burton fan still young enough this stuff personally. And it's a lesson I imagine his fans, especially his younger fans, are relearning this week with Crimson Peak. Crimson Peak's debut wasn't just disappointing in terms of realistic expectations, it was shockingly low even by the most pessimistic presumptions.\n\nThe $55 million Legendary Pictures/Universal release earned just $13.1m this weekend, and it didn't do much better overseas with a $13.6m foreign haul. I don't mean to pick a film while it's down, especially an ambitious original genre entry from a major studio and a genuine auteur (and that I didn't care for the film does not mean I wasn't rooting for it to succeed). But the numbers offered seem to indicate that not only did Crimson Peak not click with audiences, but, like a certain $80m sci-fi horror comedy from 19 years ago, the very elements that made the film stand out in the crowd may well have actively turned would-be moviegoers away from the film this weekend. And the feverish anticipation among the faithful was not remotely representative of the general public at large.\n\nDespite elements that arguably should have pointed to Crimson Peak being something of a horror event, it opened to lower grosses than any number of \"cheapo horror movie of the week\" options. Last January, The Woman In Black 2 kicked off 2015 with a $15 million debut weekend. No stars, a loose connection to a vaguely popular Daniel Radcliffe horror hammer film, poor reviews, and absolutely no buzz going into the weekend. And yet The Woman In Black 2 earned a touch more than Crimson Peak. So did The Messengers, a cheap Super Bowl weekend offering from 2007 with a pre-Twilight Kristen Stewart. That film snagged a $14m debut weekend.\n\nEven The Rite, that Anthony Hopkins religious horror film that we all forgot about, opened with $19m in early 2011. And if you want to play the adjusted-for-inflation game, Crimson Peak made less this weekend than One Missed Call, The Eye, Darkness Falls, Stay Alive, and any number of other cheap supernatural horror films that probably forgot even existed. Not only did Crimson Peak not measure up to the 1999 remake of The Haunted, it opened lower than the $15m debut weekend of the remake of House on Haunted Hill.\n\nHere's the crazy thing: It opened to less than half of the $28 million debut procured in January 2013 by Mama, which also starred Jessica Chastain and was heavily promoted as a Guillermo del Toro production even though it was directed by Andres Muschietti. So a film executive-produced by del Toro and starring Jessica Chastain opens to 2.1x what an actual Guillermo del Toro-directed genre entry co-starring Jessica Chastain and at least one other media-friendly (Tom Hiddleston) movie star pulls off. What this all points to in today's terms is that the Internet adulation for Guillermo del Toro and Tom Hiddleston is not replicated in the mainstream, and that Jessica Chastain is only a star in the sense that she can further goose people to see a movie they otherwise wanted to see.\n\nThat the current moviegoing world is so heavily concept-driven is not a surprise, it's something we've discussed for ages, but it is a little surprising that the concepts behind Crimson Peak seemed to actively repel would-be ticket buyers. While the second trailer was a bit too spoiler-y, there really wasn't anything wrong with the marketing campaign. Universal debuted the first trailer as a surprise attachment to Fifty Shades of Grey last February, which seemed like a good fit considering both films offer painfully unhealthy relationships being sold as romance. The second trailer went out with Pitch Perfect 2 (and the R-rated Mad Max: Fury Road), so you're talking about two decent trailers that had tons of eyeballs due to the mega hits on which they were attached to.\n\nI would argue that Universal waited too long for the review embargo, as the Fantastic Fest audience gave it unofficial good-to-great notices weeks ago but were embargoed until a few days before release when the rest of the critics saw the film. But, through no fault of Universal's, the trades went a day early and offered mostly negative takes, which meant that the first impressions were not from the geek fanbase but the trade papers. But it's a horror film, ever the critic proof genre if there ever was one, even if the R-rating meant a stronger sell to older audiences and thus a premium on reviews.\n\nAnd even if you argue that audiences weren't necessarily thrilled about a period piece gothic horror film, there is a contingent of audience members who will basically see whatever major horror film happens to be out there. And yet this opening tracks below the chunk of moviegoers that generally show up for pretty much any wide release horror film from a major studio. So no, I don't think Universal made a mistake selling the picture as a horror film, as that's an inherently commercial genre. So now the question becomes whether the director himself is somewhat to blame for this result.\n\nUniversal/Comcast Corp. certainly sold the film as a horror tale, playing up the gothic chills and supernatural peril, and then Guillermo del Toro spent the last two weeks or so stressing on social media that the film is not really a horror film but rather a gothic romance. Besides not being entirely accurate (it fails the \"still a better love story than Twilight\" test in about eight different ways), it also ignores the fact that horror films don't have to be devoid of richly drawn characters, passionate emotions, and elements from other genres. Not only was it somewhat of a slap in the face to actual horror fans, but it also meant that you lost chunks of the audience that would have shown up for any old horror movie over the Halloween season.\n\nTo the extent that moviegoers at large pay attention to the director's Twitter account, it's tough to sell a film as a big-budget horror spectacular and then have the director swear that it's not really a horror film. At least Goosebumps didn't pretend to be a gothic romance. You would think that a big budget horror movie with Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, Mia Wasikowa, and Charlie Hunnam and directed by Guillermo del Toro and released by a major studio would be a noticeably bigger genre event than The Lazarus Effect. But it wasn't, it opened with just $2 million more, and that's scary.\n\nIt's as potent an example as I've seen since Dredd of the disconnect between online interest and mainstream interest. And considering how geek-centric the media became over the last few years, it's a jolting reminder that random film bloggers from prestigious outlets proclaiming the Crimson Peak trailer to be the most epic thing ever doesn't mean that general audiences are going to respond. Guillermo del Toro may be a gifted filmmaker and a passionate advocate of his craft, but he he is not a Spielberg or a Tarantino at this juncture. This opening is, adjusted for inflation, worse than Mimic and the film will likely end up earning less domestically than Pan's Labyrinth ($37m in 2006) and possibly Mimic ($25m in 1997).\n\nLike Tim Burton in 1996, the fact that film nerds worship him does not mean he was a known entity. He certainly isn't enough of a draw to make people show up to what felt like a big-budget inside joke. That's arguably what Crimson Peak is. I don't say that to be dismissive, and for the record I still like Mars Attacks! (although it plays today as the most blindingly right-wing Big Hollywood-friendly political satire you can imagine). Mars Attacks! was a star-driven big-budget spectacular that no one wanted to see. The specific would-be box-office friendly elements (goofy looking aliens, black comedy, wacky special effects, 1960's-style camp, etc.) seemingly drove moviegoers into the arms of Jerry Maguire and Beavis and Butthead Do America.\n\nLikewise, the \"stars\" in Crimson Peak are merely Internet-famous in terms of box office draw, and the gothic period piece elements aren't inherently catnip to regular moviegoers. In retrospect, and I will admit I didn't see this level of box office disappointment coming down the pike, Crimson Peak seemed calculated to appeal to almost no one outside of the del Toro faithful, which was a demographic that isn't as large as some of us thought. Maybe the film could have scored bigger on a less crowded weekend, without the kid-safe Goosebumps and the still-strong Hotel Transylvania 2 snagging the horror fans and Bridge of Spies and The Martian snagging the adult moviegoers.\n\nBut in the end Crimson Peak, a period piece gothic horror film with the kind of stars who light up the Internet without lighting up the box office directed by a distinctive auteur with a faithful fan base, played only to audiences who specifically wanted all of those things. And in the end, the demographic for those specific elements in a stew were pretty small. Again, what's most striking about Crimson Peak is that it opened on the level of a small-scale, star-less, \"nobody cares\" horror movie. But I would argue, with the advantage of hindsight, that Crimson Peak is a prime example that even in our geek-centric entertainment media the celebrities and filmmakers we film nerds obsess over aren't necessarily box office draws for the general public.\n\nThe Internet couldn't make Dredd a hit, nor Scott Pilgrim vs the World or Mars Attacks!. I learned an important lesson nineteen years ago, that my interests were not necessarily shared by the mainstream and that the films I presumed would be huge hits because they looked great to me could out-and-out flop. It was a lesson I learned at least twice in 1996, with Mars Attacks! and That Thing You Do a couple months earlier. But as of today, the lesson is the same.\n\nLike Fantastic Four and arguably Aloha!, the failure of Crimson Peak is a jolt because the film's debut is well below what should have been expected as something of a rock bottom potential for the sub-genre and the elements involved. The specific geek-friendly components that made up Crimson Peak were not only not inherently commercial but arguably somewhat of a repellent for audiences who had plenty of other options this weekend. That's a tragedy, but in retrospect it perhaps should not have been a surprise."
