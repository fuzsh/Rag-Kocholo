        "text": "RadioFree.com: How did you come to cast Kristen Stewart as the lead in this film?\n\nOXIDE: Actually, she was recommended by the studio and Sam Raimi. We saw tape of her, talked it over, had a screentest, and found that she was the most suitable actress for the role.\n\nWhat made her an ideal choice?\n\nHer character has to deal with family problems, and at the same time, she needs to contend with seeing ghosts while her parents question her sanity. It's an important aspect for the character, and the actress, and we found that she could handle it.\n\nWas it a similar casting process for the other main actors (Dylan McDermott, John Corbett, and Penelope Ann Miller)?\n\nYes. They were also recommended by Sam Raimi and the studio.\n\nWere you more focused on the thematic elements of the family dynamic, or the supernatural elements of the restless ghosts?\n\nWe needed to compromise. We always concentrate on the story first, but the studio wants more action. So we spent our time compromising between the family and the ghosts.\n\nHow closely did you work with Sam Raimi on the project?\n\nFor about two months, we sat together and had a meeting every day with Sam.\n\nHow did you first meet him? Did you get together because of your work on The Eye?\n\nI think so. They tried to contact us about shooting The Messengers because Sam Raimi had seen our movies The Eye and Bangkok Dangerous. So we flew to Los Angeles to meet him, had a conversation, and then finally made the decision to make this movie together.\n\nIn terms of it being a storytelling device, what do you like about the horror genre?\n\nI love the horror movie environment. The environment for us is very important. And we love the silent environment in the movie, because it is conducive to making people feel scared. And the theater is dark already, so we can make the environment of the movie look like the environment of the theater, with the audience sitting inside a dark room. It's quite interesting for me.\n\nWhat served as the inspiration for the story's atmosphere?\n\nSometimes we can be inspired by music to shoot an environment that can make the audience feel scared. And we tried to imagine how the movie could relate to our life--situations we would normally encounter every day. We always concentrated on this.\n\nThe massive sunflower field and giant flock of crows (actually played by ravens) are two major symbols in the movie. How did you accomplish those specific visuals?\n\nThe studio spent a lot of money to make the sunflower field. And the crows, they were quite difficult to control. There was a lot of CGI involved. We spent a lot of time trying to shoot the birds, but then finally, we used CGI to help us create those flocks.\n\nWhat was the hardest thing to shoot?\n\nI think it's trying to make the animals scary. Sometimes we think we can make it scary, but find out after shooting that it does not have the impact we thought it would. So then we would try again, and try to imagine the audience's perspective, and not just only come from our point of view.\n\nWe've heard that you and your brother have had possible brushes with the paranormal. What did you encounter?\n\nOne time, I saw a shadow walking on a road--but only the shadow, without a person, without a body. I saw it very clearly. I tried to find what was casting the shadow, but I could not see it. All I saw was a very clear shadow of a human walking on the road. And this was in the afternoon, not at night. It's really amazing.\n\nAnd what was your brother's encounter?\n\nIt was similar to this situation. He saw someone walking into an elevator, but when he followed them inside, nobody was there. It's quite scary.\n\nDo you have any plans to work with Sam Raimi again?\n\nI hope so. I think we need to wait till The Messengers is released in the US and see how it does.\n\nWould you want to stick to horror for your next film, or would you like to tackle a different genre?\n\nWe would love to try anything different, not just horror. Maybe an action or mystery.\n\nWhat is your favorite American horror movie?\n\nThe original Omen, part one.\n\nOne last question: How did you get the name \"Oxide\"?\n\nIt's just a chemical name. [laughs] One day, someone asked me, \"What is your nickname?\" And in my mind, I just came up with Oxide. And after I say Oxide, I feel people usually remember my name, which is good for me. I might not remember their name, but they remember mine.\n\nWell, it's definitely working, and everyone seems to dig it! Thanks for your time.\n\nYou're welcome."
