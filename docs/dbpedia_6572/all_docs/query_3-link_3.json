        "text": "One bright afternoon last summer, I sat in a Chinese restaurant outside Regina, Saskatchewan, talking horror movies with Danny and Oxide Pang.\n\nWhen it comes to horror, Danny was saying, Americans crave explanation. “Every detail has to be logical. Why is the ghost flying? Why is the ghost walking? Why does the ghost attack that guy and not the other guy? They keep asking.” He shook his head slightly in frustration. “This is a ghost movie,” Danny said. “Ghosts are already illogical.”\n\nBorn in Hong Kong in 1965, the Pang twins have directed, separately or together, a half-dozen films: crime stories, thrillers, psychological dramas, comedies. But they will always be known for their ghosts, specifically those that haunted their best-known film, “The Eye,” which came out in 2002. It told the story of a young blind woman who has her sight restored by a surgical procedure and soon realizes that her new corneas also allow her to see ghosts.\n\nIf you must know, the ghosts do not fly. They occasionally walk, and they don’t really attack anybody. They mainly just mope spookily around on their own ghostly business, puttering in hallways and hanging out in stairwells, taking turns creeping out the heroine until they are escorted to the afterlife by a mysterious group of smudgy, leotarded grim reapers.\n\nLike many Pang films, “The Eye” deploys a startling visual palette — strategic blurs, cuts and off-kilter framing that combine, in a way, to blind the audience just as the main character is gaining her sight. The ghosts are felt more than they are seen — the way we feel the prickle of someone reading over our shoulders in the subway. In one of the film’s more memorable moments, the heroine boards an elevator and senses the presence of an elderly man floating somewhere behind her, dryly sucking at the air, seemingly trying to get her attention. We instantly sympathize: the sequence is only marginally more tense than getting caught in an elevator with a stranger who isn’t undead, and naturally, she doesn’t turn around. Oxide, Danny’s very-slightly-older, slightly-more-roguish twin, told me that this scene caused much of Hong Kong to stop taking elevators altogether, but he said it with such self-satisfied mischief in his eyes that it was difficult to take him seriously.\n\nThe Pangs were in Saskatchewan making their first English-language horror film, “The Messengers,” due to be released in early 2007. It is the story of a Chicago family who flee the city to the peace of a Midwestern sunflower farm, only to find themselves menaced by a family of ghosts and a murder of angry crows. The film is being produced by Ghost House, one of a number of new all-horror production banners, though Ghost House has a pedigree: it is a joint venture between Joe Drake and Nathan Kahane of Mandate Pictures, on the one hand, and on the other, Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert, who more than 20 years ago made the seminal vacationing-teenagers-stalked-by-evil-wood-spirits film, “The Evil Dead.”\n\nWhen I had lunch with the Pangs, they were already several weeks into shooting. I asked them how it was shaping up. Danny laughed ruefully. “Right now, it’s really logical,” he said.\n\n“We tried to combine it together,” Oxide said. “To make it logical and keep it scary. We’re trying to learn.”\n\n“The Eye” was the Pang brothers’ first Hong Kong production. Before then, they lived and worked primarily in Thailand, where they started out in commercials. But the particulars of their geography did not seem to matter in 2002. After the underground success of the Japanese haunted-videotape film “Ringu,” in the late 90’s, and the mainstream success of its English language remake, “The Ring,” in 2001, the U.S. was not picky about what part of Asia it got its scares from. And so “The Eye” picked up a limited theatrical release in the States, a small eddy in the dark, inky wave of Asian horror films and remakes that have swamped our shores over the past five years.\n\n“The Ring” led the way, followed by the haunted-house movie “The Grudge,” the haunted Roosevelt Island movie, “Dark Water,” and the forthcoming haunted-computer film, “Pulse.” All derive from Japanese films that were already cult hits on video in the U.S. when they were remade here, and like “The Eye,” they are all spooked by similar preoccupations: the supernatural reasserting itself within the rational world, often via the very technology that had banished it (be it VHS tapes, modern medicine or, as in “Pulse,” the Internet — a kind of MySpace.com of the living dead); the replacement of traditional horror movie “scares” with slow, spooky elevator rides; and also, creepy children, who either are ghosts or just hang around with them.\n\nThough the wave has subsided somewhat, the aftereffects of the Asian ghost boom are still being felt. Once confined to big-city video stores, original Asian horror titles have begun to infect even the most remote suburban chains (largely because of the efforts of Japanese producer Taka Ichise, whose “J-Horror” line of original, straight-to-DVD Japanese-language horror films has spawned its own wave of English-language remakes). And more generally, the Asian horror boom has opened America to a provocative new generation of talented foreign directors who might otherwise have languished in art houses or on video. It undoubtedly cultivated an audience for provocative directors like Park Chanwook of South Korea and Takashi Miike of Japan (even though their brilliant, sometimes grueling physical-psychodramas cannot really be described as horror — their fondness for cutting off tongues and feet in their films notwithstanding). Beyond Asia there is England’s Neil Marshall, whose subterranean thriller “The Descent” is one of the most anticipated horror films of the summer; France’s Alexandre Aja, who recently remade Wes Craven’s seminal 70’s vacationing-family-stalked-by-mutants film “The Hills Have Eyes”; and Australia’s James Wan and Leigh Whannell, whose $1.2 million Rube Goldbergian mutilation film “Saw” boggled Hollywood with an $18 million opening weekend in 2004.\n\nFor directors like the Pangs, the Asian ghost boom might not get them straight to Hollywood (they will not, for example, be directing the American remake of “The Eye,” currently in development), but it did get them to Regina.\n\nThough I’d been in Regina for a couple of days, this lunch was the first time I’d ever seen the Pangs together. As is typical of their collaborations, they were directing the film on alternating days: one supervised the set while the other worked on a rough edit of the previous day’s shots — a time-saving technique developed on the perpetually rushed productions they are used to. While both speak English rather proficiently, they had brought along their own assistant director from Hong Kong to interpret their often spare direction: a grim, round man named Cub, who has one of the most imposing deadpans I’ve ever encountered. Cub described the difference between making a film in Asia and making a film in Hollywood this way: “There’s more food here. Every day, two hours before the real meal, there will be sandwiches. So every day when sandwiches come around, we know: two hours to lunch.”\n\nI visited the set on an Oxide day. While the interiors were being shot on a local sound stage, the sunflower farm scenes were staged in a hot green valley some 50 minutes north of Regina. In addition to the steady stream of food, there were other cues that this was a set buoyed by the typical though still-startling largess of a Hollywood budget. The Pangs chose the spot in the valley that most appealed to them visually, and a two-story family home was built there from scratch — all peeling paint and dying vines on the outside; on the inside, a hollow plywood shell. It was surrounded by some 60,000 actual sunflowers, planted from seed, with another 20,000 silk sunflowers from China on standby.\n\nDylan McDermott, who plays the father of the family, was wandering around the set wearing a bloody shirt with pitchfork holes in it. The Pangs were shooting a scene at the house where McDermott’s character, Roy, would be taken away on a stretcher as the family of ghosts looked on from an upstairs window.\n\nJason Shuman, one of the film’s producers, pulled Oxide aside.\n\n“Did you see Roy? Is it too much blood?”\n\n“No,” Oxide said. “He’ll be covered with blankets.”\n\n“And the ghosts.. . .” Jason said. “They don’t look like ghosts anymore. They just look like people. Is that O.K.?”\n\n“Of course, of course,” Oxide said.\n\nMeanwhile, Cub was standing nearby, offering his regular 1,000-yard stare, when he was approached by a young guy who had been hired to take photos of the production.\n\n“What do you say in Hong Kong when you want to say, ‘Action’?” the young photographer asked.\n\n“Action,” Cub said, without pausing or even moving his eyes.\n\nHorror, like comedy, has always been something of a reptilian-brain endeavor, unusual among the arts insofar as it is successful only when it is able to produce a single, audible emotional effect — a scream or a laugh — that is primal, cathartic and difficult to understand. This is one reason that horror has always been a director’s medium: the horror movie is a contraption, and it takes a certain organizational flair to design, pace and frame a scare.\n\nAbout a month before I went to Regina, I visited Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert in Raimi’s office, along with their partner in Ghost House, Joe Drake. The term that kept coming up was “roller coaster.” “It’s the novelty of a horror-movie concept that attracts the audience,” Tapert was saying. “They want the new and the different. They want the roller coaster built with new curves in it.”\n\nTapert and Raimi, who met in college at Michigan State, first learned how to build a horror movie in 1978. They were just 24 and 19, respectively. Along with Raimi’s high-school friend Bruce Campbell, Raimi and Tapert had worked on a Super 8 offbeat comedy. But the only kind of feature film they could raise money for, Tapert figured, was a horror movie. So they all went to the drive-in.\n\n“Everyone else was making out in the cars around us, and these three geeks were actually watching the movie,” Raimi recalled. “A tremendous amount of European films came into America back then, and they were horror and soft-core for the drive-ins. None of them ever made it to the hard tops.” Raimi paused and laughed softly. “That’s a term they don’t even use anymore.\n\n“We’d watch these films, and they always had 30 minutes of slow stuff. Then they had a good scare. Then there was another 15 minutes of slow stuff. Then there was a good suspense sequence. Then there was more slow stuff. Then a good ending.\n\n“So after about 20 of these, Rob and Bruce and I said, ‘Why don’t we just make one that has all the good stuff and skip the slow stuff?”’\n\nThe result was “The Evil Dead,” shot on half a shoestring in a decomposing cabin in the Tennessee woods in the winter of 1979 and released in 1983. Drawing as much from the Three Stooges as from classic horror films, it was economical, unrelenting and infused with a kind of manic ingenuity — particularly in the swooping evil-spirit P.O.V. shots that would become a Raimi trademark, and the distressing spectacle of a young woman being molested by a tree. One executive who turned the script down in disgust called it 90 minutes of the possession scene from “The Exorcist.” Tapert would later tell me with a smile that the guiding principle for “The Evil Dead” was this: “Punish the audience.”\n\nWhile “Halloween” and “Friday the 13th” ushered in a decade of masked-killer films that would define horror in the 80’s, “The Evil Dead” nestled into the cult following that accrued around a pack of uncompromising American horror films from the 70’s, including George Romero’s zombie films, Wes Craven’s “Last House on the Left” and Tobe Hooper’s “Texas Chainsaw Massacre.” The films were often laced with corrosive social commentary, and their low budgets gave them an amateur, near-documentary feel that would make them all the more harrowing. There were rarely ever any slow parts — just a constant, anxious buzz.\n\nBy the 90’s, however, horror had waned as a genre. Countless iterations of “Friday the 13th” and “Nightmare on Elm Street” had fallen into rote familiarity and low comedy and gradually disappeared, to be replaced by the knowing self-parody of the “Scream” films. Horror didn’t go away, but with the drive-ins gone, it found new, often-profitable exile in the direct-to-video market. Raimi, meanwhile, left the genre behind, making “Evil Dead 2” as a kind of satire of the first, and turning to pure slapstick by the second sequel, “Army of Darkness.” In 1998 he earned acclaim for his somber, humane thriller, “A Simple Plan,” and then brought a reverent, pulp sensibility to “Spider-Man,” which made the film among the most successful in history and Raimi an A-list director.\n\nIt was around this time that Joe Drake founded his own production company, which would become Mandate Films. Drake had spent years selling movies to overseas territories for studios like Lions Gate, and he takes obvious pleasure in measuring the market’s appetite. Later he would tell me a story about a producer acquaintance of his who had gone to Indonesia. “He asked the Indonesian buyers what they wanted, and they said, ‘Creature stories.’ And so he asked, ‘What creatures?’ And I don’t remember the exact order, but it was something like snakes first, and then alligators, and then tigers. And so he made a movie with a tiger fighting an alligator.”\n\nBy 2002, Drake began to sense that there was an audience for well-made, modestly budgeted genre movies that wasn’t being served. He and his business partner, Nathan Kahane, decided to start a single-genre production banner, and they wanted a name director to headline it. They were thinking maybe comedy, until Raimi’s and Tapert’s names came up. Then the path was clear: horror. Drake remembered being amazed by two things about the pair: that they would be interested at all, and that the entire deal was struck with a handshake. “We actually shook hands,” he said again, astonishment in his eyes.\n\nThis was not the way it was supposed to be. Horror was traditionally B-movie territory. It had long been a place where A-list talent might start out — Francis Ford Coppola with “Dementia 13,” for example, or James Cameron with “Piranha II: The Spawning” — but not one where it typically longed to return. But by the early 00’s, the distinction between A movies and B movies was blurring, in no small part because of the success of the Asian horror remakes. “The Ring” and “Dark Water” were attracting Academy Award nominees and lending the genre respectability it hadn’t seen since Gregory Peck tried to kill the devil child in “The Omen.”\n\nIn the meantime, the 70’s horror library, from the iconic (“The Texas Chainsaw Massacre”) to the pedestrian (“The Amityville Horror”) has been profitably plundered for remakes (though curiously, the remake of “Amityville” was stripped of its Satanic subtext, filling in the scares with a dare-I-say typically Asian vengeful ghost plot line, plus a rousing gabled-rooftop chase scene). And for the first time in a decade, the hard-core, largely male horror fans who long ago had been ceded by Hollywood to the direct-to-video market are now being lured back to the theaters with a string of violent, hard-R horror films.\n\nConsider Eli Roth’s “Hostel,” which opened at No. 1 in January, replacing “The Chronicles of Narnia.” Like many horror films, it opened at around $20 million. Not a huge amount, but bear in mind that its budget was less than $5 million. And bear in mind that it was an R movie, thus reducing its potential audience, and what’s more that it was an R-rated movie about teenagers running afoul of an elite torture club in Slovakia. Bear in mind that this $4.8 million R-rated torture movie has gone on to earn some $80 million worldwide, and you might get a sense as to why studios seem eager to rely on scare-driven niche films to offset what they’re really frightened of: a changing marketplace in which box office is besieged like a teenager in a cabin by DVD sales and the looming threat of the Internet and on-demand cable distribution; where the great mass-market monsters of old like “King Kong” or “Mission: Impossible III” can open at two to three times the audience of the average horror movie and still be considered, on Monday morning, a tragic, wounded beast.\n\nJoe Drake is allergic to the suggestion that he saw any of this coming. “I think right now the horror feature is defying gravity,” he said. “We’re all kind of looking at it going, God, another horror movie has opened well. It sort of defies logic.” Nor is it to suggest that Raimi’s and Tapert’s instincts to get back in the horror game were in any way mercenary; if anything Raimi seems genuinely delighted to be back, reputedly going over every Ghost House script and marketing campaign with avid, affectionate attention. It’s only to say that, while the drive-ins where Tapert and Raimi initially studied the horror movie have disappeared, drive-in movies are thriving in a way they haven’t in decades.\n\nInitially, Raimi and Tapert thought they would give a Ghost House movie a very specific, recognizable structure, going back to the formula they had teased out of the drive-in. “We did start with a very hard formula of five sequences of six minutes of suspense,” Raimi recalled, “no less than 18 scares. Because we knew that three or four would be cut, and three or four wouldn’t work, but we’d end up with 10 or 11 really jolting, leap-out-of-your-seat moments for the audience.”\n\nAll that changed when they saw the original Japanese-language version of “The Grudge.” Tapert and Raimi were not new to Asian cinema and the talents that were incubating there. They had worked a lot of kinetic, Hong Kong-style action into their 90’s TV series “Xena: Warrior Princess,” and they produced John Woo’s first English-language film. But this was a roller coaster that they had not seen before. “Ju-on,” as it was originally titled, was a quiet film about a house with a ghost rattling in the attic and a curse that attached itself indiscriminately to even the most casual passers-by. It had little discernible plot or logic, jumped back and forth in time and moved at the speed of dread. This was nothing but the slow stuff.\n\nAnd yet, it was shot entirely on practical locations — the kind of stripped-down, efficient, uncomfortable kind of horror filmmaking that Tapert and Raimi had started out in. And in no small part because of its novelty and nightmarish strangeness, it delivered a number of new curves. As Tapert put it: “A little black cat is scary. Evil little kids are scary. But evil little kids who mew like a cat?” He laughed, still shivering. “Well, that’s a new combination.”\n\nIn an unusual turn, Raimi and Tapert hired the original director of “The Grudge,” Takashi Shimizu, to helm his own English-language remake of the film, even though he speaks no English. Shot in Tokyo, it’s exceedingly faithful to the original, except with more computer-generated imagery and the pointed addition of a rooftop scene in which a Japanese police office explains to Sarah Michelle Gellar the logic of the story’s central haunting.\n\nAfter the success of the “The Grudge,” the proposed Ghost House formula would be thrown out the window. Just as Tapert and Raimi had rewritten the rules of the horror movie back at the drive-in, now they would look all over the world for directors who could build them a new roller coaster.\n\nThe first film the Pangs made together was a ghost story.\n\n“It was so simple,” Oxide told me on the set one afternoon during lunch. “A man, at midnight, looking in a mirror, peeling an apple.” It’s a Chinese folk tale, he explained: if you peel an apple at midnight in one unbroken piece, you see your future in the mirror. If you break the peel, a ghost appears.”\n\nI asked him if that’s what happened in this short film.\n\n“It’s not complete yet,” he said. “I shot it in the corridor of my building. It was low lighting, so when we shot it, it was black. So we didn’t finish,” he laughed. “We were 14.”\n\n“How old are you now?” I asked.\n\n“Fourteen?” he said, eyebrows raised, and then he collapsed in laughter.\n\nIn fact, both Pangs are 41, and their lives have entwined with the typical amount of creepy mischief you might expect from identical twins. Growing up in Hong Kong, they regularly switched identities in the classroom, and when they saw my tape recorder, Danny introduced himself as Oxide almost reflexively. After “The Eye,” each of the brothers decided to make a movie on his own: “Leave Me Alone,” by Danny, and “Ab-Normal Beauty,” by Oxide — both thrillers involving zero ghosts. When they watched the rough edits, they realized that both films featured a pivotal car accident at about the 10-minute mark. It was too good a joke to pass up: Oxide asked for Danny’s accident footage to replace his own.\n\nThey first worked together as adults in 1999 on “Bangkok Dangerous,” a fierce, pulpy crime film about a deaf-mute hit man that combined the Hong Kong-style operatic action and the Thai-Buddhist languor of the Pangs’ twin homelands. Here they first and most boldly developed their style: an audacious cascade of varying film stocks, colors and speeds that is equally adept at capturing the agonizing slow motion of a sexual assault as it is the strangely painterly image of a man fighting off a horde of phantoms with his own luminous flatulence.\n\nThis latter scene is from the “The Eye 10,” which, despite its title, is the second and probably final sequel to “The Eye.” The film, which the Pangs directed in Hong Kong and Thailand, is controversial even among their fans for jettisoning the story of “The Eye” altogether and replacing it with a buffoonish teenage comedy, including a ghostly break-dance fight. In fact, “The Eye 10” perfectly captured the Pangs’ eagerness to move from genre to genre, to learn and to move on.\n\n“After our action movie,” Oxide said, “we wanted to make a ghost movie.”\n\n“Why?” I asked.\n\nOxide said, simply, “To try.”\n\n“We want to make action, comedy, ghost movies.. . .”\n\n“You want to make everything?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Oxide said.\n\nWhen asked what attracted them to this particular movie, Oxide’s answer was swift: “Sam Raimi.” The Pangs had seen Raimi’s work as kids in Hong Kong and loved it.“The pacing, the pacing!” Oxide exclaimed, perhaps not surprisingly: much of Raimi’s early work and all the “Evil Dead” films lurch wildly between real, sometimes affecting earnestness and pure clowning.\n\nWhen Raimi first invited them to consider the script of “The Messengers,” the story involved an evil scarecrow that demanded human sacrifice. This was not entirely to the Pangs’ liking, so they proposed two major changes. Instead of a scarecrow, there should be ghosts, and there should be a creepy child: an infant who can see the ghosts but cannot tell anyone about them.\n\nAlmost immediately, the Pangs started sketching out the scares, designing and framing the film first on scraps of paper and then on storyboards as the script was still being written. They were not terribly concerned with the plot that would connect and make sense of these moments. In fact, talking to Oxide now, the whole idea of plot seemed remote, strange, overly logical. Asian movies, he said, are allowed to be “unreasonable,” and to his mind, scarier. “With a scary movie,” he said, “when the audience comes out of a theater, all that matters is whether it’s scary. No one says, this scary movie is so cool. It’s so reasonable.”\n\nLater I would speak with Mark Wheaton, a screenwriter, about this view. Wheaton worked on the final draft of “The Messengers,” a job he received in part because of the credentials he earned as a writer for Fangoria, the magazine of record for the horror fan base. According to Wheaton, the American horror film had been defanging evil for decades. By the end of the “Nightmare on Elm Street” series, he said, you pretty much knew what would happen the moment the lights went down: “Whoever the last girl standing is defeats Freddy.” But in Asian horror, there is no puzzle to solve that will chase off the illogical ghosts. The characters in “The Grudge” are haunted not because of a past sin that they can atone for, Wheaton said. They are haunted because they walked past the house. “This movie put the fangs back in and said: ‘Actually, you aren’t strong enough to beat this. Hollywood was wrong. You cannot win.”’\n\n“The Eye” is a perfect example of this differing sensibility. At the end of the movie, the heroine waits in a traffic jam. She begins to see masses of the grim-reaper ghosts assembling amid the cars. The audience sees that a truck accident ahead is about to set off a gas explosion that will kill everyone for blocks around. As the heroine begins screaming at everyone around her to run for their lives, the American viewer sees, almost disappointingly, a classic resolution: she has only a few minutes to save the day. How will she use her rare and unusual power for good? Will she follow the ghosts to the disabled truck? Will the heroic boyfriend help her? But then the truck explodes, and the heroine is left wandering among the charred remains of mothers clutching their infant children.\n\nOh, thinks the American viewer. Or, that could happen.\n\nWhile it’s a grisly scene, it’s not so much the fatalities that are alien and troubling as the fatalism — far more so than a meowing child. Much hay has been made about the connection between the headiness of the horror market these days and the national mood after 9/11. And it is true that, between unrelenting natural disasters and the war on terror, we are feeling pretty jumpy. The last time we were this existentially freaked out as a nation was directly after Vietnam, when Raimi and his colleagues were rewriting the rules of horror. Curiously, though, Hollywood’s remakes of those very films often turn them upside down: where the cannibal clan in “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” was a subversive distortion of the classic American family, its remake is not grueling but comforting, drenched in the sheen of big budgets and nostalgia. With few exceptions, we have given over the real scary questions to those who were not born here: Do you need to be threatened with certain death in order to at last appreciate life (“Saw”)? Why go on living once your entire family has been killed (“The Hills Have Eyes”)?\n\nPerhaps because it is so difficult to face, we seem to be off-shoring our deepest fear, the creeping terror of the day: despite our rare and unusual power, what if we cannot stop the evil? What if we can’t win?\n\nI asked Oxide again if there was a reason he and his brother were attracted to ghost stories, other than just wanting to try them out.\n\nHe nodded. “It’s like U.F.O.’s,” he said. “It’s something you will never get an answer to.”\n\nI asked him if that meant he would make a U.F.O. film.\n\nHe nodded quickly, eyebrows raised, “Later!” he said. “Later!”\n\nI went back to the set on a Danny day.\n\n“They’re very into eyes,” said Penelope Ann Miller, who plays the mother of the family. “One time, Oxide told me to look to the right and hold it. But I looked to the left for one second. All of a sudden, Cub’s arms went up in the air, and I said: ‘I’m sorry! I’m sorry!”’\n\nBoth brothers direct with spare efficiency. They are used to telling stories without a lot of language, for international audiences, with very precise visuals, and doing it fast. When one actor asked to go back to an earlier part of the scene to get into character, Danny didn’t understand. Why would they go back to something he’s already shot? “Danny told me,” Miller said, “you have to empty your cup to drink from my tea.”\n\nBut now, as the sun went down over the sunflowers, Miller told me that the brothers had softened to the American system. In one of the last scenes of the film, Miller’s character is supposed to come out to the yard carrying lemonade. The family has survived, but the cost has been high, and the scene is supposed to be silent and calm. But she couldn’t help herself. She put her chin up and announced, “I have lemonade!”\n\nImmediately filming stopped. Jason Shuman, the producer, said: “No! It’s too corny!”\n\n“But Danny said, ‘I love it,”’ Miller said. “‘It’s so American!”’\n\nWith the sun nearly set, the horror over for the day, Penelope Ann Miller laughed. “I couldn’t just stand there. Who makes lemonade without saying they made lemonade?”"
