        "text": "Horror’s ability for social commentary, its ability to catch the current pulse of society, is a component unique to its genre. In the past few years the genre seemed to have receded into a niche market, distanced from the spotlight it used to own. Horror always seems to me to go through cyclical phases. This is a new and exciting phase. In the past few years I have noticed a trend, and it seems to only be growing in momentum. I have been keeping my eye on it since the release of the Babadook in 2014. Which to many, myself included, was quite the breakthrough film. In the past many have said that horror films cannot be all that intelligent, but this new generation of films prove that assumption wrong. The premises of these films are escaping the usual, often predictable, narrative themes of the past. The blockbuster franchise horror appears to be a thing of the past. Mumble core, slow burners based in psychological torture is the name of the indie horror game for this new generation. The genre has been in desperate need of revival (don’t shoot the messenger), not necessarily a revival to become popular again, but one that allows it to prove its social and artistic relevance again. I feel that this change could allow the genre to gain a fresh perspective on the pulse of society, thus making it a more valuable genre once again. So far we’ve seen films like Hush, Hereditary, Raw, Mother!, Get Out, It Follows, The Witch, and some consider A Quite Place, to be a smarter kind of horror (I’m on the fence about this particular opinion). I feel A Quite Place had a lot of potential, but the film has many gaping plot holes.\n\nHereditary also has something else going for it; it’s a horror based explicitly on psychological and emotional situations. It is, with few exceptions, based in reality. Unconventional yes maybe, to some, but I feel it was the bringing back to reality that allows the genre to be so fresh again. Some of the best horror films are the ones based in reality, those that connect with us on personal levels, playing on our deepest internal fears. Hereditary does this with a twist of spiritual horror to keep itself true to genre tropes. It balances these two components very intelligently.\n\nThe film was directed by Ari Aster, a relative unknown up until this point. Aster found great success in the breakout film. It was A24’s biggest money maker worldwide in July of this year. It took in $77.5M at the global box office, according to Deadline (slashfilmcast.com, Chris Evangelista). Get Out made a domestic gross of $176,040,665, while The Witch made a worldwide total of $40,423,945 (boxofficemojo.com). We all know in Hollywood (even on the indie scene) numbers talk, and Hereditary had a very loud voice this summer. Larger production companies and indie companies alike are both seeing that these kind of films are paying.\n\nThe writing and camera work are fresh and rather exciting. There are several images that I can still recall, like the shot out of the window looking towards the tree house and the bright blood red light from the space heater glares thought the ceiling window. The image is striking and frankly chilling within the context of the film. The deep blackness that surrounds the characters during night scenes is also very enveloping. The cinematography was done by Pawel Pogorzelski (best known for Water for Elephants). I fell in love with the look of this film instantly, Pogorzelski clearly had a specific vision which fell in tandem with the mood of the film.\n\nThe film is well written, and down to earth enough emotionally that you feel for the characters. They all operate in a grey area, none of them are really good or really bad. There are moments where we truly feel hate for their actions, but we still understand them on a human level. They reveal to us the deepest, nasty, emotions that none of us are willing to admit we have. That in a sense, is the real horror of this film. Annie has a dream that she tells her son Peter she wishes he was never born, Annie struggles bitterly with her relationship with her mother even after her death. My thoughts go to the dinner table scene between Collette and Wolff, the words exchanged between mother and son are nothing short of raw and violent. These are the kind of issues the film delves into, it forces you to confront the darkest parts of humanity.\n\nIt is not without flaw however. The film’s main tragedy was rather predictable, the looming sense of dread could have been played up much more. The film also has a lot of breathing room, which leaves enough space for one to figure out the plot twist fairly easily before the climax of the film. Only after seeing the film can one decide if this is really a flaw. I think a little more narrative ambiguity could have been employed to better mask the outcome at the end of the film. Because of this the end feels more like an affirmation of one’s guesses rather than a revelation.\n\nOne thing that stuck out to me was the creation of a final guy as opposed to a final girl (which is more expected and typical of the genre). Peter (Alex Wolff) is the last standing family member who has any touch with reality. I find this to be more of an interesting and smart narrative choice as opposed to a statement on gender within the genre. But of course this choice can be read either way. All the family members fall one by one, and as viewers we are never quite sure who will be the last one standing. We are naturally rooting for Annie (Toni Collette) to make it out at the end, but our alliance shifts from her to her son Peter. Just like our alliance shifts to the final girl (Collette) in a more traditional horror, it shifts instead to the final guy (Wolff) in a similar pattern of events.\n\nI would love to see horror films continue this trend. I was never a great lover of the genre, but in these past two years, with the genre evolving, I’m beginning to love what I see. My opinions on the more modern films of the genre are also quickly evolving. The intelligent mixing of genre tropes with a narrative base in reality, psychological horror, with an indie mumble core style is fresh and (the numbers have spoken) popular with mainstream and indie audiences alike. We would all be wise to keep an eye on the evolution of the genre. I’m sure there are many surprises in the future for us cinephiles."
