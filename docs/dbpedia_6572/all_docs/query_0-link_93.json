        "text": "28 Weeks Later, the terrifying sequel to Danny Boyle's apocalyptic hit about zombies roaming the empty streets of London, has distinctly modern relevance. But, says Mark Kermode, it joins a brilliant tradition of British horrors that turn familiar sights into killing fields.\n\nPhilip French: ... a third-rate Wes Craven horror production made in South Africa and set on a deserted island off the North American coast\n\nGillian Anderson's latest returns to the subject matter of 70s B-movies like Last House on the Left. Is this a fit topic for entertainment?\n\nPhilip French: A bad time is had by all as The Exorcist meets The Wicker Man in America's Deep South."
