        "text": "Although the field of medievalism on screen is fairly young, there is already a massive amount of work on the topic in English alone. By medievalism, I am referring to recreations or evocations of the Middle Ages, purposefully or unwittingly. By screen, I am referring to movies, television, and short form content.\n\nI’m maintaining this bibliography for several reasons. First, I couldn’t find anything comparable on the Internet (or in print). Second, I wanted to keep track of what I had read and still needed to read. After a while I’ve seen so many papers, articles, and books in footnotes that I lose track. I haven’t read all of these works (yet!) and I haven’t annotated all that I’ve read.\n\nI’ll update this list as I continue to find, consume, and annotate works in this Sisyphean task. If you have any recommended additions, please feel free to holler at me in the comments or via email (scottmanning13@gmail.com).\n\nIntroductions and Methodologies\n\nThe following papers and books are superb places to start with medievalism on screen.\n\nAberth, John. A Knight at the Movies: Medieval History on Film. New York: Routledge, 2003.\n\nAberth’s book-length treatment on medievalism on screen is one of the earliest written and it is a superb introduction. Aberth understands that “cinema neither can nor ought to take the place of historical scholarship,” but “it would be foolhardy of historians to neglect this medium altogether.” Thus, the author is “in favor of historians soiling their hands with the movies.”\n\nThe author groups movies together by topic into 6 chapters, covering King Arthur, vikings, the Crusades, Robin Hood, the Black Death, and Joan of Arc. The approach is not to simply give a “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” on the accuracy of every film, but instead to “illustrate the complex relationship between modern and medieval history, for how we choose to remember the past reveals much about how we live in the present.” At the beginning of each chapter, Aberth examines how medieval and modern chronicles view the events or people in question, as well as the transmission of those chronicles in various mediums. These introductions act as mini-historiographies for each topic. This is helpful in understanding not just if the filmmaker got something right or wrong, but to understand why. It could include limitations of the medium, artistic necessities, politics, or just a lack of accessible history.\n\nIn many instances, Aberth reveals how films can get facts wrong, but still capture the essence of something from the medieval world. Aberth assumes positive intent by filmmakers, but admits to not holding back against “films that I feel mangle with malicious intent their medieval subject.” For example, The Black Knight (1954) receives derision for its visible telephone poles, poor choreography, and for being “perhaps the most politically driven film ever set in the Middle Ages.”\n\nAberth concludes “movie magic (and disaster) remains elusive,” and “the best we can do, perhaps, is dissect how a particular film got things right or wrong after it was made.”\n\nBernau, Anke and Bettina Bildhauer, eds. Medieval Film. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2009.\n\nBildhauer, Bettina. “Medievalism and Cinema.” In The Cambridge Companion to Medievalism. Edited by Louise D’Arcens, 45-59. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016.\n\nBildhauer offers a succinct introduction to the current academic thinking around “medieval film,” which carries a broad definition of “anything that is perceived to be medieval by film-makers and audiences, including academic audiences.” That can include full-length movies, television programs, documentaries, short-films, and video art, which focus not just on films set in the Middle Ages, but also adaptations of medieval literature, adaptations of modern literature taking place at least partially in the Middle Ages, or fantasy worlds with medieval elements. It can even include other genres without apparent medieval attributes such as westerns, science fiction, and even detective films. Hence, why you can find academic papers on medievalism in Star Wars (see the Science Fiction section below).\n\nThe author then explores some of the methods that academics use to analyze medieval film such as historical accuracy. This remains a hotly contested topic as some academics seemingly rage against anachronisms while others argue “film-makers can only do so much to attempt to include the latest research.” Then there are film-makers who are deliberate in their anachronisms (e.g., the Nike swoosh in A Knight’s Tale). Finally, there is the notion of whether it “feels” authentic to the audience who likely doesn’t know what’s accurate.\n\nThe author also touches on the “icons of the medieval,” which are “visual or acoustic short-cuts that evoke the period across a large number of films, such as knights, church bells, bad teeth and dirt.” On the thematic level, there is a lengthy exploration of the notion of temporal displacement in both the settings and perspectives within the film.\n\nBhildhauer emphasizes the need for academics to embrace medieval film, concluding, “Who says academic engagements with the Middle Ages are more important than, or indeed fundamentally different from, cultural or artistic ones? And who knows which future Tolkien or Jacques Le Goff might become interested in medieval matters by watching Brave or The Seventh Seal?”\n\nThis is a lengthy summary for a 14-page chapter in this bibliography, but this short chapter sums up the field where some book-length treatments don’t. If you’re getting started in medievalism on screen, I highly recommend reading Bildhauer’s chapter.\n\nBurt, Richard. “Getting Schmedieval: Of Manuscripts and Film Prologues, Paratexts, and Parodies.” Exemplaria 19, no. 2 (2007): 217-242.\n\nBurt tackles “cinematic paratext”–the title sequences, optional on-screen text, documentaries, interviews, commentary, and even posters associated with digitized and home releases of historical medieval films. The methods and intentions of filmmakers vary, but something as simple as a medieval scroll could be meant to emphasize authenticity or simply lampoon the medieval. In addition, the addition of paratext in the home releases can change the tone, meanings, and messages of the original films. Burt walks through several use cases on how historians can analyze paratext and where historians have fell short in past attempts.\n\nDahm, Murray. “Watching History Happen. Medieval Warfare on Film.” Medieval Warfare. May 16, 2013.\n\nDahm provides a broad overview of medieval films with clips from YouTube, emphasizing they “should be regarded as a starting point rather than a finishing one. If through a flawed film you discover aspects of history you didn’t know existed, you have the film to thank. You can still enjoy the film: just remember, it’s a film, not history. History still has to be found in good old fashioned sources and research, but if film leads you there – All hail the film!”\n\nDriver, Martha W. and Sid Ray, eds. The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy. Jefferson: McFarland, 2004.\n\nDriver and Ray have collected 11 papers on a large swath of topics along with 5 introductory papers of their own. Each chapter is thorough with its own filmography. Although “medieval hero” is the theme, this is a superb introduction to medievalism on screen. I’ve categorized each paper elsewhere throughout this bibliography, but the topics include languages and accents in The Lord of Rings trilogy; how audiences perceive authenticity in medieval films; the Arthurian subplot in Little Miss Marker (1934); neomedievalism masculinity in Star Wars (1977) and E.T. (1982); medieval and modern views on the virginity of heroines; reshaping traditional definitions of the medieval knight; an exploration of the power of heroes’ weapons from Homer to Dirty Harry; uses and appropriations of Merlin of as a character, plot device, and guide on screen; incorporating modern topics and themes through knights; using Joan of Arc films as teaching tools in the classroom; and of course, teaching the medieval hero on screen in the classroom.\n\nElliott, Andrew B. R. Remaking the Middle Ages: The Methods of Cinema and History in Portraying the Medieval World. Jefferson: McFarland, 2011.\n\nIn this work, Elliott jumps into the anachronism debate, stating “there can often be some value gleaned from looking at where and why filmmakers ‘get things wrong.’” The latter is important, because “audience expectations can have as much influence in the construction of the Middle Ages as the historical period itself.” Essentially, filmmakers are aiming for what audiences will accept as authentic, not what historians will accept.\n\nIn order to explore this phenomenon, Elliott coins the term “historicon” to identify a film’s “visual conventions which each aim to evoke to the spectator an element of ‘medievality.’” These can include images such as knights, castles, and princesses. In addition to historicons, there are “the use of symbolic tropes, images or sequences of events (feasting scenes, knights in state, peasants at work, etc.).” The author argues that historians should abandon identifying and condemning anachronisms for history’s sake and instead seek to understand why filmmakers employ them. To do this, Elliott explores several medieval films with this model and reveals medievalism in popular culture.\n\nI’ve found this lexicon and approach very useful in my own analysis of trebuchets on screen.\n\nFinke, Laurie A. and Martin B. Shichtman. Cinematic Illuminations: The Middle Ages on Film. Baltimore: The John Hopkins University Press, 2010.\n\nIn this lengthy introduction to medievalism on screen, Finke and Shichtman offer multiple models to explore “the myriad ways in which contemporary popular culture uses the medieval past as a fantasy frame for making sense of our own world.” This enables them to “use our students’ experience of film to make them better readers of medieval literature–of its poetry, its history, and its art.” The following is a brief overview of some of the models, but this overview will hardly do them justice.\n\nTo explore the content of films, the authors present their “three little medievalisms”–nostalgia for better times, the association with less-civilized times, and the seeds of modernity. Immediately, the authors demonstrate how these can be used for films with a medieval setting, films that employ purposeful anachronisms, and modern-day films that simply employ medieval themes. This chapter alone fulfills “a central task for this book” by theorizing “the fantasy of medievalism.”\n\nThen there is the model to explore the series of stock features, or signs that signify “medievalness” in order “to locate the viewer within the medieval framework of the film.” For this, the authors offer 4 syntagms–genre, formula, convention, and iconography. These incorporate some standard film theories, but with a medieval twist. The authors identify “filth” as “the icon that functions most vividly to call up the Middle Ages for the popular viewer.” Also interesting is notion that even sound can serve as an icon.\n\nThese are just some examples, as the authors offer more models on exploring historical accuracy, comparisons with medieval manuscripts, the influence of modern politics, and modern anxieties about the past, present, and future. Throughout the book, they explore more than 40 films, some in incredible depth.\n\nMarshall, David W. “Introduction: The Medievalism of Popular Culture.” In Mass Market Medieval: Essays on the Middle Ages in Popular Culture. Edited by David W. Marshall, 1-12. Jefferson: McFarland, 2007.\n\nIn this introduction, Marshall chronicles the rise of medievalism as an academic field. Although it is not focused purely on medievalism on screen, the author situates the sub-field within medievalism, emphasizing that other sub-fields are rising. In addition, the author chronicles some of the earliest works from the 1980s and 1990s on movie medievalism, paying tribute to Martin B. Schichtman, Norris J. Lacy, Kevin J. Harty, and others (look for their names throughout this bibliography). Although other medievalists have mentioned these names and works, this short paper does a superb job of detailing the rise of movie medievalism within the context of medievalism.\n\nPugh, Tison and Angela Jane Weisl. “Movie Medievalism.” In Medievalisms: Making the Past in the Present, 83-100 New York: Routledge, 2013.\n\nIn their chapter on movie medievalisms, Pugh and Weisl emphasize that that it is impossible to create a medieval film free of anachronisms. As such, “it is not the presence of anachronisms in a film that merits analysis and investigation as much as their function.” To do this, they adopt Thomas Green’s rubric for identifying types of anachronisms—naïve, abusive, serendipitous, creative, and tragic, adding a sixth type, essential. They then run five different Arthurian films through this modified rubric. The exercise is fruitful and provides a useful model for analyzing medievalism on screen, as they reveal where a film may be successful because of or despite its anachronisms. Abusive anachronisms become too easy to identify in films that insist in their own accuracy, often getting basic dates, facts, and events wrong while eschewing the more entertaining, salacious stories of Arthur for the sake of “accuracy.” Intentional anachronisms can work for lampooning myths or criticizing modern perceptions. Finally, essential anachronisms are necessary to bring the story to the modern viewer who doesn’t understand languages such as medieval French.\n\nWilliams, David John. “Looking at the Middle Ages in the Cinema: An Overview.” Film & History: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Film and Television Studies 29, no. 1-2 (1999): 8-19.\n\nWilliams provides an overview of common perspectives on medieval movies among academics, even listing some of their favorites based on informal polling. The author then presents four different types of medieval movies–the epic, the realistic, the literary adaptation, and the auteur. The author chooses one film for each type and examines them in detail, discussing what works and doesn’t work, revealing that each approach has its merits.\n\nWoods, William F. “Authenticating Realism in Medieval Film.” In The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy. Edited by Martha W. Driver and Sid Ray, 38-51. Jefferson: McFarland, 2004.\n\nWoods explores how audiences perceive and judge authenticity in medieval films. The author concludes with many others that audiences accept “what we think we know” about the medieval world, but that is only part of the equation. In addition, it is what audiences “need to think and feel about that dim medieval twilight when pain, death, and taxes were so much closer to the bone.” Woods explores how violence, extreme facial closeups, and identifying with melodramatic characters help audiences accept medieval movies as authentic.\n\nAs a Teaching Tool\n\nEach of these papers provides anecdotes and explores how teachers have incorporated medieval film into their medieval history and medievalism courses. Many of these are refreshingly vulnerable, as the authors describe in detail their successes and failures with students.\n\nBeatie, Bruce A. “Arthurian Films and Arthurian Texts: Problems of Reception and Comprehension.” Arthurian Interpretations 2 (1988): 65-78.\n\nBeatie focuses on the use of Arthruian films in a “Faces of Camelot” undergraduate course where students watched 7 films, discussed the films and relevant readings, and received traditional lectures on Arthurian romance. Beatie chose this approach because “any real understanding of Arthurian literature, especially of its medieval texts, depends on an awareness of certain literary conventions with which college students today are rarely familiar, and on background knowledge of a period and a tradition which few students command.” The author found that the films provided media-oriented students with “a more immediate and profound means of access to the sometimes difficult works of Arthurian literary tradition.” The course and paper climax in the lecture and discussion of Excalibur (1981), which “was perhaps the most exciting event in my nearly thirty years of undergraduate teaching.”\n\nBurkholder, Peter. “From Passive Viewer to Active Learner: Strategies for Teaching Medieval Film.” Studies in Medieval & Renaissance Teaching 24, no. 1 (2017).\n\nCoote, Lesley A. and Brian J. Levy. “‘The Middle Ages Go to the Movies’: Medieval Texts, Medievalism, and E-Learning.” Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Teaching 10, no. 2 (2003).\n\nDriver, Martha W. “‘Stond and Delyver’: Teaching the Medieval Movie.” In The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy. Edited by Martha W. Driver and Sid Ray, 211-. Jefferson: McFarland, 2004.\n\nDriver explores specific scenes in various movies useful for the classroom. Particular attention paid to Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975).\n\nDriver, Martha. “Teaching the Middle Ages on Film: Visual Narrative and the Historical Record.” History Compass 5, no. 1 (2007) 159-174.\n\nDriver believes “film remains one of the most useful tools for talking about the Middle Ages, for conveying with graphic immediacy some subjects not fully conjured by the written word.” The author offers examples of reviewing clips from films with students including King Arthur (2004), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), and Tristan & Isolde (2006), while then reading relevant medieval texts with the class. The anachronisms of the film were not harmful, but instead offered fodder for “lively discussion.” In addition, works of fiction based in the Middle Ages are helpful. For example, Driver found it was possible to read Beowulf through the prism of The 13th Warrior (1999).\n\nGanim, John M. “The Hero in the Classroom.” In The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy. Edited by Martha W. Driver and Sid Ray, 237-249. Jefferson: McFarland, 2004.\n\nGanim explores the challenges of teaching a “medieval hero on screen” course. The author’s scope is broad, including Arthurian legend, Braveheart (1995), and The 13th Warrior (1999). Ganim address specific challenges such as dealing with so much readily information about films on the Internet and the prevalence of studio copy that emphasizes the filmmakers’ intent. The author had to tweak approaches in questioning and challenging students to guide them away from what the Internet had to say about films and instead spark original thought. The author concludes, “Students respond instinctively to the idealism of the medieval film hero. They react more slowly to a critique of that idealism.”\n\nHarty, Kevin J. “Teaching Arthurian Film.” In Approaches to Teaching the Arthurian Tradition. Edited by Maureen Fries and Jeanie Watson, 147-150. New York: MLA, 1992.\n\nHarty recognizes that when undergraduate students “show up for the first day of a semester-long course in Arthurian literature, few have read–and some have never heard of–Chrétien, Wolfram, Malory, Tennyson, Twain, or White.” As such, The author renamed a 14-week course to “King Arthur in Literature and Film.” The paper provides a complete syllabus and Harty narrates each week’s objectives with anecdotes from students’ reactions.\n\nKelly, A. Keith. “Beyond Historical Accuracy: A Postmodern View of Movies and Medievalism.” Perspicuitas (2004): 1-19.\n\nKelly challenges the conflicting apathetic and hypercritical attitudes exuded by historians toward medieval films. In exploring the ways to use films to teach history, the author emphases “an assessment of medieval film that is limited to accuracy is woefully inadequate.” The author then uses films such as The 13th Warrior (1999), Braveheart (1995), First Knight (1995), and A Knight’s Tale (2001) to explore how such films are not historically accurate and are instead shaped by our collective understanding of the past and present.\n\nMcClain, Lee Tobin. “Introducing Medieval Romance via Popular Films: Bringing the Other Closer.” Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Teaching 5, no. 2 (1997): 59-63.\n\nMcClain (previously Tobin–see below) describes employing medieval films in a romance course, using clips from Camelot (1967), Excalibur (1981), Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), and Casablanca (1942). This article has some remarkable insights, as McClain found “students are more comfortable with medieval stories we read after viewing the familiar fight scenes in the Arthurian films.” In addition, “When I began using Casablanca to represent modern romance, however, I soon realized that for students, 1942 is almost as long ago as 1492. Most of my students quickly lumped Casablanca together with the medieval period.” Finally, “students are media experts, much more so than I am, and using media frees students to educate the educator.” McClain goes on to describe learning new things from students with every lesson using this method.\n\nMyers, Michael D. “Teaching Medieval History through Legend and Film.” Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Teaching 5, no. 2 (1997).\n\nPaden, William D. “I Learned It at the Movies: Teaching Medieval Film.” Studies in Medievalism 13 (2005): 79-98.\n\nAfter teaching medieval movies at Northwestern University since 1989, Paden describes methods of categorizing the films into “historical, literary, and imaginary.” Paden then examines one film for each category–The Lion in Winter (1968), Perceval le Gallois (1978), and Platoon (1986), respectively. Imaginary is the most creative, as it can be any film with themes from the medieval past or literature. Paden concludes, “Medieval movies are symptoms of historical consciousness at the time of their production” and “by seeking to understand medieval movies we can gain insight into what the past means for us.”\n\nPagès, Meriem. “You Can’t Do This to Disney! Popular Medievalisms in the Classroom.” In Medieval Afterlives in Contemporary Culture. Edited by Gail Ashton, 58-66. London: Bloomsbury, 2015.\n\nPagès takes us directly into their medieval courses where they fully embrace medievalism, as the author believes “popular image of the Middle Ages can turn, if approached properly, into a lasting passion for Medieval Studies.” Each course starts with asking the students to describe what comes to mind when they hear “Middle Ages.” Pagès takes notes and emphasizes they want the students to focus on how people, places, and events are portrayed. Then the method involves reading medieval texts followed by watching clips from medieval movies and television, asking students to describe the portrayals.\n\nOne interesting pitfall Pagès addresses is the age difference between some professors and students. A more seasoned professor may not be familiar with all the medievalisms students experienced throughout their childhood, especially in games. As Pagès bluntly states, “Popular medievalism is demanding.”\n\nPsaki, F. Regina. “Pasolini’s Decameron and Teaching the Middle Ages.” Medieval Feminist Forum 23, no. 1 (1997): 47-52.\n\nPsaki believes “looking critically at films as readings of their sources helps students to understand the poetics of borrowing, adaptation, and appropriation which governed literary activity in the Middle Ages.” To facilitate this experience, Psaki incorporates a variety of films, but focuses the article on Decameron (1971). Psaki shares reactions from students on the filmmakers’ take on Boccaccio’s original story. The teacher also focuses on the ideological agenda of the filmmaker.\n\nStaines, David. “The Tradition of King Arthur: The Grail in Legend and Film.” Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Teaching 4, no. 1 (1993): 3-12.\n\nTobin, Lee Ann. “Contemporary Medievalism as a Teaching Tool.” Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Teaching 1, no. 2 (1990): 13-19.\n\nThe author argues philosophically and practically in favor of “using students’ existing knowledge of medievalism” as a teaching tool. For example, even if the student has a skewed perception because of a medieval film, it is still helpful by giving the student “something to actively adjust according to new information.” Also interesting are the author’s surveys on students’ familiarity with medieval films. The author then uses the results to provide examples on how to incorporate them into the classroom.\n\nWiethaus, Ulrike and Jane E. Jeffrey. “Cinematic Representations of Medieval Women and heir Legacy: Using Film, Text, and Theory to Teach Medieval Women’s Culture.” Medieval Feminist Forum 25, no. 1 (1998): 40-46.\n\nWiethaus and Jeffrey provide an introduction to their course on medieval women’s culture, as well as a complete copy of their 15-week syllabus that includes weekly reading and film viewings.\n\nWoods, William F. “Cinematic Medievalism: Reflections on a Film Workshop.” Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Teaching 9, no. 1 (2002): 81-93.\n\nFilmographies\n\nMost medievalism on screen scholarship include a filmography in the back. The following works are purely filmographies, often providing brief details and reviews of each movie. See Arthurian Legend on Screen for filmographies focusing exclusively on Arthurian works.\n\nBlanton, Virginia, Martha M. Johnson-Olin, and Charlene Miller. Medieval Women in Film: An Annotated Handlist and Reference Guide, with Essays on Teaching The Sorceress. 2nd ed. Medieval Feminist Forum, 2014.\n\nThe authors provide an annotated list of nearly 400 films, television series, and documentaries featuring portrayals of medieval women. The authors have grouped movies into historical, literature, and folklore. Then within each of those categories, the authors provide further groupings (e.g., Crusades, Joan of Arc). The most exhaustive of the entries include title, release date, director, and run time, along with brief commentary on the portrayal of women, but there is always enough information to point the reader in the right direction. They humbly admit that it is “in no way is this handlist exhaustive or complete,” but there is no other medieval filmography actively being updated with such a focus.\n\nCoote, Lesley. “Survey of Twenty-First Century ‘Medieval’ Film.” In Medieval Afterlives in Contemporary Culture. Edited by Gail Ashton, 103-114. London: Bloomsbury, 2015.\n\nIn this survey, Coote thematically analyzes 37 different medieval films and film series from the 21st-century. The narrative is by no means all-inclusive, but it is the first of its kind for the new century. In addition, it is broad in its approach, including fantasy series such as Shrek and Harry Potter, as well as the anime series Berserk.\n\nHalsall, Paul. “Medieval History in the Movies.” Internet Medieval Sourcebook, created 1996, last revised June 8, 2002.\n\nAlthough abandoned in 2002 and not nearly as extensive as Harty’s book (see below), Halsall’s online list of 268 different medieval movies provides different categorizations missing from other filmographies–region and topic. Whereas Harty and Williams list films either alphabetically or by release date, Halsall utilizes categories such as Pagan Late Antiquity, Law, Crusades, and Homosexual/Transgendered Characters. In addition, there are lists of best/worst films by accuracy. There is also a short list of “myths” common in medieval period films.\n\nFor a review and critique of the filmography and methods of the lists, see Rosenstone’s “Reel Joan of Arc” (2003) in the Miscellaneous section below.\n\nHarty, Kevin J. The Reel Middle Ages: American, Western and Eastern European, Middle Eastern and Asian Films About Medieval Europe. Jefferson: McFarland, 1999.\n\nThis is the work that many credit with solidifying medievalism on screen as an academic discipline. After nearly 20 years, there is nothing else like it in print. The book is an encyclopedia of 564 medieval films released between 1897 and 1996. Harty not only provides essential details on each film, but also summaries and short commentaries along with references to reviews and discussions on the films. This is the best place to start when trying to get a grasp on the vastness of medieval movies from the 20th-century.\n\nFilms are arranged alphabetically by title. Desperately needed is an arrangement of films by periods, places, and themes. For an arrangement by release date see the works of David Williams (below).\n\nHolly, Linda Tarte. “Medievalism in Film: The Matter of Arthur, A Filmography.” In Mittelalter-Rezeption III.

Future updates are promised.\n\nWilliams, David. “Medieval Movies.” The Yearbook of English Studies 20 (1990): 1-32.\n\nWilliams provides one of the early introductions to medieval movies, presenting some of the typical questions around the role of the historian–anachronism, presentism, and audience expectations. The author traces reoccuring and evolving themes affected by world events–the Depression, world wars, Nuclear threat. At the end, Williams provides a “far from exhaustive” filmography of 244 medieval films between 1898 and 1988, grouped by year. Each entry contains only the bare essentials–Title, director, location, and an indication if its animated.\n\nWilliams, David John. “Medieval Movies: A Filmography.” Film & History: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Film and Television Studies 29, no. 1-2 (1999): 20-32.\n\nIn this updated filmography, Williams provides only a brief introduction and then a much more comprehensive listing of films, grouped by year from 1898 to 1996. Along with title, director, and location, Williams also attempts to include the studio for each film, but is admittedly not always successful. In addition, Williams admits this is a work in progress with more entries to come. Comparatively, this it contains 380 films compared to the 244 films in the 1990 filmography (see above).\n\nArthurian Legend\n\nAs John Aberth pointed out, “There are more books about Arthurian films than perhaps about any other medieval film genre.” This still holds true today and the same goes for articles, thus there is a separate page for Arthurian Legend on Screen: An Annotated Bibliography.\n\nBeowulf\n\nAlthough Beowulf is the most-read work in English literature, there were virtually no theatrical treatments of the film until 1999 (see Haydock and Risden below). Since then, films such as Beowulf (1999), The 13th Warrior (1999), Beowulf & Grendel (2005), the computer-animated Beowulf (2007), and Outlander (2008) have hit theaters as attempts to closely or loosely adapt the poem. As such, most of the medievalism scholarship has focused on these films, but can also include television treatments and films that appropriate characters and themes from the poem.\n\nAcker, Paul. “Beowulf at the Movies.” In Teaching Beowulf in the Twenty-First Century.

In the process, Grewell reveals that attempts to tone down the “Christian” morals of the poem while enhancing the pagan world, the filmmakers infused a different set of Christian morals into the film.\n\nHaydock, Nickolas. “Film Theory, the Sister Arts Tradition, and the Cinematic Beowulf.” Studies in Medievalism 22 (2013): 153-180.\n\nUsing Beowulf, Haydock explores how “inter-arts comparisons occupy the borderland” of “crossovers and continuities between traditional scholarship and movie medievalism.” To do this, Haydock examines the scholarship on adaptations by other mediums such as literature and art, and compares them to the scholarship on movie medievalism.\n\nA version of this paper also appears in Beowulf on Film (see below).\n\nHaydock, Nickolas. “Making Sacrifices: Beowulf and Film.” The Year’s Work in Medievalism 27 (2012).\n\nHaydock reviews the openings of recent Beowulf films, concluding that although they differ from the poem in terms of events and content, they carry similar themes of sacrifice.\n\nA version of this paper also appears in Beowulf on Film (see below).\n\nHaydock, Nickolas. “Meat Puzzles: Beowulf and Horror Film.” Studies in Medievalism 23 (2014): 123-146.\n\nHaydock, Nickolas and E. L. Risden. Beowulf on Film: Adaptations and Variations. Jefferson: McFarland, 2013.\n\nHaydock and Risden combine their previously published and presented papers, as well as new material to produce this book-length treatment on the medievalism of Beowulf movies. While these include the obvious films such as Beowulf (1999), The 13th Warrior (1999), Beowulf & Grendel (2005), Beowulf (2007), and Outlander (2008) there is also extensive analysis on films and televsion shows that appropriate themes, characters, and elements from the epic such as No Such Thing (2001) and Xena’s Beowulf episodes in season 5 of the series.\n\nThere are several general themes that immediately crop up. First, there were virtually no theatrical treatments of Beowulf until 1999, save for the animated musical Grendel, Grendel, Grendel (1981). Second, of the rash of Beowulf films released since then, only one has turned a profit. Finally, none of these films is wholly faithful to the source material. As the authors examine these films, they find that most of them incorporate elements from Lord of the Rings while also producing “an accumulation of themes inherited from earlier film Beowulfs.”\n\nAfter examining so many Beowulfs, Risden concludes it is “unlikely, if not impossible, within mainstream cinema” to produce “a full-length Beowulf film that actually sticks pretty closely to the poem.” The book ends with Haydock’s ideal film treatment of Beowulf in a trilogy format, which is a pleasure to read.\n\nHinz, Philipp and Margitta Rouse. “Adaptation as Hyperreality: The (A)historicism of Trauma in Robert Zemeckis’s Beowulf.” In The Medieval Motion Picture: The Politics of Adaptation. Edited by Andrew James Johnston, Margitta Rouse, and Philipp Hinz, 129-153.

L. “A Corporate Neo-Beowulf: Ready or Not, Here We Come.” Studies in Medievalism 21 (2012): 49-56.\n\nRisden analyzes No Such Thing (2001), a satiric Beowulf story that the author believes is “a marvelous and under-appreciated cinematic revision of the Anglo-Saxon epic” that “represents the most notable and most polar alternative of the cinematic commoditization process.”\n\nRisden, E. L. “The Cinematic Sexualizing of Beowulf.” Essays in Medieval Studies 26 (2010): 109-115.\n\nRisden argues that the sexualizing of Beowulf in recent films has served to eliminate the “ideas of heroism, loyalty, and personal accomplishment balanced with martial service and self-sacrifice” found in the original epic. Instead, viewers get “exoticisization and titillation that reshape the story as fable about the problems of male sex-drive.”\n\nA version of this paper also appears in Beowulf on Film (see above).\n\nBraveheart (1995)\n\nWorks on movie medievalism often evoke Mel Gibson’s Braveheart (1995) for its distortions of history and its global influence. There are far too many papers criticizing the historical accuracy of the film and only a few are listed here to provide a flavor for the topic.\n\nCanitz, A. E. Christa. “‘Historians . . . Will Say I Am a Liar’: The Ideology of False Truth Claims in Mel Gibson’s Braveheart and Luc Besson’s The Messenger.” Studies in Medievalism 13 (2005): 127-142.\n\nCostley, Tom. “Braveheart Versus Rob Roy: How Stirling Won the Tourist Battle.” Researchplus (June 1997): 14-15.\n\nDahm, Murray. “‘The Dead Cost of Nothing’: Edward I on Film.” Medieval Warfare 8, no. 2 (2018): 56-57.\n\nIn this brief article, Dahm tells us Edward I “was a complex figure with a multi-faceted reign who has seldom been portrayed on film; however, in all bar one depiction he is painted as the villain.”\n\nEdensor, Tim. “Reading Braveheart: Representing and Contesting Scottish Identity.” Scottish Affairs 21 (1997): 135-158.\n\nEdensor examines the local impact on Scottish tourism and identity from Braveheart (1995). The author pays particular attention to how the travel industry used the success of the movie to entice tourists to Stirling. Similarly, various political parties appropriated the Hollywood version of William Wallace to promote their campaigns and agendas. Although, there were plenty of critics of the film.\n\nHague, Euan. “Scotland on Film: Attitudes and Opinions About Braveheart.” Études Écossaises 6 (1999): 75-89.\n\nHawley, Kenneth Carr. “The Re-Making of a Mythic Hero: Scottish Nationalism in Braveheart.” Master’s thesis, Texas Tech University, 1998.\n\nKeller, James R. “Masculinity and Marginality in Rob Roy and Braveheart.” Journal of Popular Film and Television 24, no. 4 (1997): 146-151.\n\nKrossa, Sharon L. “Braveheart Errors: An Illustration of Scale.” Medieval Scotland, July 23, 2001.\n\nKrossa seeks to emphasize the scale of historical errors in Braveheart by detailing the errors found in just the first two minutes with a total of 18. The author concludes, “Every bit and every aspect of these introductory scenes are, to put it bluntly, wrong. And the rest of the film follows the same pattern.”\n\nThis provides historians with an easy answer to popular questions about accuracy in medieval movies–“Well there are 18 factual errors in the first 2 minutes of Braveheart.”\n\nLuhr, William. “Mutilating Mel: Martyrdom and Masculinity in Braveheart.” In Mythologies of Violence in Postmodern Media. Edited by Christopher Sharret, 227-246. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1999.\n\nMcArthur, Colin. “Braveheart and the Scottish Aesthetic Dementia.” In Screening the Past: Film and the Representation of History. Edited by Tony Barta, 167-188. Westport: Praeger, 1998.\n\nMcArthur, Colin. Brigadoon, Braveheart and the Scots: Distortions of Scotland in Hollywood Cinema. New York: Palgrave, 2003.\n\nAlthough not focused exclusively on Braveheart, half the book tackles the movie and its reception in and out of Scotland. McArthur gives particular focus to the film’s distortions and selective appropriations of history and integration of Hollywood tropes to create a modern medieval myth. In addition, the author traces the appropriations made by viewers of the film to support ideologies and nationalist movements in Scotland.\n\nMcArthur also examines the origins of the film’s historical inaccuracies, tracing many of them to themes and characters from previous Hollywood movies, none of which had anything to do with the figure of William Wallace.\n\nSharp, Michael D. “Remaking Medieval Heroism: Nationalism and Sexuality in Braveheart.” Florilegium 15 (1998): 251-266.\n\nSharp argues that nationalism and sexuality are “intimately intertwined” in Braveheart “and that the film uses male sexuality in particular as a way of expressing the relationship between citizen and country.” The depiction of William Wallace is “emphatic and consistent in its use of male sexuality as a sign of a nation’s morale strength.” His heterosexual love and desire to avenge his wife’s death are contrasted against the depictions of English rape, incestual thoughts, homosexuality, and sexism. The author thoroughly analyzes the depictions of Edward II, who “never once makes it out of the castle,” even for an archery tournament. Conversely, “Wallace fights outdoors, in hand-to-hand combat, with the fate of his nation at stake.”\n\nRay, Sid. “Hunks, History, and Homophobia: Masculinity Politics in Braveheart and Edward II.” Film & History: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Film and Television Studies 29, no. 3-4 (1999): 22-31.\n\nShippey, Tom. “Medievalisms and Why They Matter.” Studies in Medievalism 17 (2009): 45-54.\n\nAlthough not exclusively about Braveheart, Shippey uses the movie to illustrate a larger point that “scholars have a duty to trace connections, to expose errors, and above all to make their voices heard inside and outside the academy.” As for Braveheart, the author calls the film a “historical travesty” and theorizes that “if the United Kingdom does break up, as some predict, it will have played a significant part.”\n\nSturtevant, Paul B. “Mel Gibson, you Magnificent Bastard.” The Public Medievalist, July 31, 2014.\n\nSturtevant tackles major inaccuracies in Braveheart, arguing that it is a good film, but “terrible history.” The film is so good that if Scotland votes to leave the UK, then the author believes “that at least a small portion of the blame or credit could be laid at the feet of one anti-Semitic, misogynistic Australian: Mel Gibson.”\n\nChaucer / A Knight’s Tale (2001)\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer has found nominal success in Hollywood adaptations of his work with A Knight’s Tale (2001) being the standout exception. The following works focus predominately on the adaptations of Chaucer’s stories.\n\nCetiner-Oktem, Zuleyha. “Dreaming the Middle Ages: American Neomedievalism in A Knight’s Tale and Timeline.” Interactions (2009): 43-56.\n\nCetiner-Oktem explores how American culture may be seeking to restore ancestral ties to Europe through neomedievalism in films such as A Knight’s Tale (2001) and Timeline (2003).\n\nD’Arcens, Louise. “Deconstruction and the Medieval Indefinite Article: The Undecidable Medievalism of Brian Helgeland’s A Knight’s Tale.” Parergon 25.2 (2008): 80-98.\n\nForni, Kathleen. “Reinventing Chaucer: Helgeland’s A Knight’s Tale.” Chaucer Review 37, no. 3 (2003): 253-264.\n\nForni immediately admits that “this delightfully anachronistic fairy tale” bares little resemblance to the original literary work. “However, Helgeland’s apparently idiosyncratic representation of Chaucer’s character does indeed provoke (at least the literary critic) to consider both the history of the Chaucerian persona and how Chaucer is constructed in the popular imagination.”\n\nGreen, Martin. “The Dialectic of Adaptation: The Canterbury Tales of Pier Paolo Pasolini.” Literature/Film Quarterly 4, no. 1 (1976): 46-53.\n\nHardwick, Paul. “Arthurising the Wife of Bath: Two Chaucer Adaptations.” The Year’s Work in Medievalism 32 (2017).\n\nHarty, Kevin J. “Chaucher for a New Millennium: The BBC Canterbury Tales.” In Mass Market Medieval: Essays on the Middle Ages in Popular Culture. Edited by David W. Marshall, 13-27. Jefferson: McFarland, 2007.\n\nHarty examines the BBC 2003 television series The Canterbury Tales. Unlike Chaucer’s original interconnected work, these are six standalone episodes that are the work of six writers and four directors, which is evident to Harty. The author also sees a much bleaker world portrayed in the BBC series than in Chaucer’s original work.\n\nHarty, Kevin J. “Chaucer in Performance.” In Chaucer: An Oxford Guide.

Trigg concludes “the distinctions between medieval and medievalist literature, or medieval and medievalism studies are clear to most within the academy, but virtually meaningless outside it.”\n\nWilkes, Hannah. “Chaucer Comes to Hollywood: Changing Stars and Staying Authentic in A Knight’s Tale.” Studies in Popular Culture 35, no. 1 (2012): 91-107.\n\nCrusades\n\nThese works focus almost exclusively on film and television involving the Crusades.\n\nBonet, Maria and John Style. “Utopia and the Middle Ages in Popular Culture: A Reading of Ridley Scott’s Kingdom of Heaven.” Spaces of Utopia 5 (2007): 55-93.\n\nDahm, Murray. “An Invisible Clash: The Battle of Hattin on Film.” Medieval Warfare 7, no. 4 (2017): 56-57.\n\nDahm, Murray. “A Modern Film in Medieval Garb: Kingdom of Heaven.” Medieval Warfare 6, no. 5 (2016): 54-55.\n\nHalim, Hala. “The Signs of Saladin: A Modern Cinematic Rendition of Medieval Heroism.” Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics 12 (1992): 78-94.\n\nHaydock, Nickolas and E.

For works related to The Sword in the Stone (1963), see the Arthurian section above.\n\nAttwood, Adam I. Social Aesthetics and the School Environment: A Case Study of the Chivalric Ethos. New York: Palgrave, 2018.\n\nAttwood dedicates a chapter that focuses on Disney’s contribution to the popular perception of chivalry, which “provides additional context to explain the influence of popular culture on pre-service K-8 teachers’ perceptions of chivalry as a historical social construct.”\n\nBradford, Clare. “‘Where Happily Ever After Happens Every Day’: The Medievalisms of Disney’s Princesses.” In The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-tale and Fantasy Past.

Edited by Tison Pugh and Susan Aronsten, 243-. New York: Palgrave, 2012.\n\nCecire examines Disney’s live-action musical Enchanted (2007), a “film that refuses any historical anchor for Disney’s fairy-tale ethos” and instead relies on neomedievalism, as it poaches from Disney’s archive of fairy tales for its source material.\n\nCraven, Allison. “Esmeralda of Notre-Dame: The Gypsy in Medieval View from Hugo to Disney.” In The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-tale and Fantasy Past.

Edited by Tison Pugh and Susan Aronsten, 153-167. New York: Palgrave, 2012.\n\nFoster examines Disney’s Man in Space trilogy (1955) and Unidentified Flying Oddball (1979) “from a historical perspective and understands them as reflections of Walt Disney’s seemingly contradictory fascination with the medieval era and his technological enthusiasm, an enthusiasm that played out not only in the films and parks but also in Disney’s support of America’s burgeoning and continuing space agenda.” The optimism in Disney and Americans did not live up to the history of the space program. Foster concludes, “Disney’s emphasis on futuristic medievalism in his creations reflects the blind faith that Americans have in technology and our sterilized interpretation of how we invented the twenty-first century.”\n\nHatch, David A. “The Carnival Mirror: Ideological Twists on The Feast of Fools in Disney’s Adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.” Response: The Digital Journal of Popular Culture Scholarship 1 (2016).\n\nKelly, Kathleen Coyne. “Disney’s Medievalized Ecologies in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Sleeping Beauty.” In The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-tale and Fantasy Past.

Edited by Tison Pugh and Susan Aronsten, 97-113. New York: Palgrave, 2012.\n\nLabbie analyzes the use of medieval alchemy in the various versions of the “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” in Fantasia (1940), Fantasia 2000 (1999), and The Sorcerer’s Apprentice (2010), which “exhibit the ways that Disney’s medievalism is manifested even in its most apparently modern or contemporary technological innovations and applications.”\n\nMitchell-Smith, Ilan. “The United Princesses of America: Ethnic Diversity and Cultural Purity in Disney’s Medieval Past.” In The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-tale and Fantasy Past. Edited by Tison Pugh and Susan Aronsten, 209-224. New York: Palgrave, 2012.\n\nNorako, Leila K. Review of Brave. Medievally Speaking, August 30, 2013.\n\nThis is more than just a review of Brave (2012). Norako examines the common feedback from historians on the medieval settings and anachronisms in the film. In the process, the author explores how medieval romance, anachronisms, and modern themes make a good movie.\n\nPavlinich, Elan. “The Chaucerian Debate of Auctorite versus Experience in Disney’s Sleeping Beauty and Maleficent.” The Year’s Work in Medievalism 30 (2015).\n\nPavlinich argues that by “citing both women’s experience and Disney as the source for the film’s auctorite [authority], Maleficent strives to recuperate Disney’s Sleeping Beauty narrative for an audience who is familiar with feminist criticism.” The author makes comparisons with Chaucer’s debate with textual authority.\n\nSturtevant, Paul. “‘You Don’t Learn It Deliberately, But You Just Know It from What You’ve Seen’: British Understandings of the Medieval Past Gleaned from Disney’s Fairy Tales.” In The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-tale and Fantasy Past. Edited by Tison Pugh and Susan Aronsten, 77-96. New York: Palgrave, 2012.\n\nSturtevant attempts to quantify the amount of influence Disney has on children’s perspective of the medieval world through a sociological study with British students (not kids), focusing on “how Disney’s animated films influenced their current perceptions of the Middle Ages, whether those films were self-evidently medieval in setting and provenance or not.” Along with Disney’s traditional medievalism films (e.g., Sleeping Beauty), Sturtevant focuses on how Aladdin shapes perceptions on the medieval Islamic world.\n\nTelotte, J. P. “Flatness and Depth: Classic Disney’s Medieval Vision.” The Year’s Work in Medievalism 30 (2015).\n\nTelotte traces the evolution of castles in Disney animation from thee earliest days to Brave (2012). From movie to movie, the depth and representation of castles grow, as technology, and the need for medevialism change.\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nThere are countless articles online covering medievalism in HBO’s Game of Thrones television series. I’ve included some of the more salient ones below, but you can find more on The Conversation.\n\nAskey, Brooke. “‘I’d Rather Have No Brains and Two Balls’: Eunuchs, Masculinity, and Power in Game of Thrones.” The Journal of Popular Culture 51, no. 1 (2018): 50-67.\n\nAlthough Askey concedes that “criticisms of the series’ portrayal of women, people of color, and the poor are justified,” Game of Thrones “does make strides in subverting some problematic constructions of gender,” albeit “mostly in the roles of the male characters’ fears of castration.”\n\nBleisteiner, Martin. “Perils of Generation: Incest, Romance, and the Proliferation of Narrative in Game of Thrones.” In The Medieval Motion Picture: The Politics of Adaptation. Edited by Andrew James Johnston, Margitta Rouse, and Philipp Hinz, 155-169. New York: Palgrave, 2014.\n\nByrne, Philippa. “Why medievalists should stop talking about Game of Thrones.” The Conversation, June 15, 2016.\n\nByrne is “skeptical about using Game of Thrones as a way into medieval history,” to say the least. The reasons focus on the conglomeration of periods and places mixed with dragons. In addition, the gruesomeness of GoT reinforces the notion of “The Dark Ages,” a negative stereotype medievalists have struggled to eradicate. The author sees more fruit gained in engaging with medieval period works (minus the fantasy) such as The Last Kingdom and The White Queen. The brief article is unique in its seemingly lone voice against a tidal wave of medievalists engaging with the GoT phenomenon.\n\nCarroll, Shiloh. Medievalism in A Song of Ice & Fire & Game of Thrones. Woodbridge: D. S. Brewer, 2018.\n\nClark, James. “How the Battle of the Bastards squares with medieval history.” The Conversation, June 24, 2016.\n\nDeVries, Kelly. “Game of Thrones as History: It’s Not as Realistic As It Seems–and That’s Good.” Foreign Affairs, March 29, 2012.\n\nDeVries tells us that “as a historian of the period, I can assure you that the real Middle Ages were very boring — and if Martin’s epic were truly historically accurate, it would be very boring too.” The author emphasizes that the mythical figures of Beowulf, King Arthur, Robin Hood, and St. George were not nearly as exciting as their real-life counterparts. Similarly, with a few exceptions, real campaigns and battles were tedious, logistical nightmares that hardly make for entertaining viewing. DeVries reviews several medieval inspirations for characters and events throughout GoT.\n\nFacchini, Riccardo. “‘I watch it for historic reasons.’ Representation and reception of the Middle Ages in A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones.” Práticas da História 5 (2017): 43-73.\n\nGebhardt, Torben R. “Homosexuality in Television Medievalism.” In The Middle Ages on Television: Critical Essays. Edited by Meriem Pagès and Karolyn Kinane, 197-213. Jefferson: McFarland, 2015.\n\nGebhardt starts with an outline of portrayals of homosexuals in television (positive and negative) before moving onto portrayals in television medievalism. Then the author explores “how gay characters are represented” in the first four seasons of Game of Thrones, drawing “conclusions about neomedievalism as well as about the importance of ‘provocative entertainment’ to modern perceptions and representations of homosexuality.\n\nKennedy, Kathleen E. “Game of Thrones’ Medieval Crap.” The Public Medievalist, July 22, 2017.\n\nUsing a rather graphic montage from Game of Thrones, Kennedy explores what the medieval options were for dealing with feces before the advent of indoor plumbing.\n\nLarrington, Carolyne. Winter is Coming: The Medieval World of Game of Thrones. London: I. B. Tauris, 2016.\n\nThis book does not analyze the sources of Game of Thrones, but instead is “about what happens when medievalist Game of Thrones fans get together, discussing what Westeros and Essos have in common with both the historical medieval world and the altogether more arcane and vivid world of the medieval imagination: parallels, reminiscences, shared structures and understandings.” Focuses on books and HBO series.\n\nMondschein, Ken.

The author looks at the record from the perspective of secular and religious law, as well as class.

Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2015.\n\nBridge takes scholars to task for the lack of work on the Harry Potter films, especially as part of the epic genre. By admitting the series to the epic cinematic canon, Bridge argues it “will enable us to examine how the series is unique in being the first epic made for, featuring, and largely made popular by children.” To make the case, Bridge uses every definition of epic available including Aristotle’s definition for the classical epic: “length, unified action, multiple plots, a story that arouses pity and fear, an epic hero, spectacle, and a happy resolution”; definitions specific to epic films such as “characterized by sweeping visual images”; and even a film dictionary that defines epics as “films dealing with major historical . . . themes.”\n\nAfter making the case for Harry Potter as an epic, Bridge examines how the film series addresses children’s fears and aspirations, and appeals to their “cross-cultural structures of belonging and identification” and their “inchoate sense of collective desire.”\n\nLin, Ming-Hsun. “Fitting the Glass Slipper: A Comparative Study of the Princess’s Role in the Harry Potter Novels and Films.” In Fairy Tale Films: Visions of Ambiguity.

Elferen identifies three different levels where music’s role in the fantastic occurs: “that of accompanying fantastic narratives in the shape of a carefully constructed soundtrack”; “that of inviting characters and audiences into fantasy through the portals of magical instruments”; and “that of a metaphysical generator of alternative worlds and realities.” The author pays particular attention to the music in The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003),\n\nEverett, William A. “King Arthur in Popular Musical Theater and Musical Film.” In King Arthur in Music.

Still, there are plenty of works that often feature The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952), the animated Robin Hood (1973), Robin and Marian (1976), Robin Hood: Princess of Thieves (1991), and Robin Hood (2010).\n\nBehlmer, Rudy. “Robin Hood on the Screen: From Legend to Film.” In Robin Hood: An Anthology of Scholarship and Criticism.

Although each film is decidedly different from the others, Harty finds reoccurring themes of “opposition to tyranny and oppression, concern for the downtrodden and disempowered, and a happy ending.”\n\nJohnson, Valerie B. “Ecomedievalism: Applying Ecotheory to Medievalism and Neomedievalism.” Studies in Medievalism 24 (2015): 31-37.\n\nJohnson examines the films The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and Robin Hood (2010), as well as the BBC television series Robin Hood (2006-2009), focusing on evolution in depictions of the forest as a blank slate for medieval fantasy.\n\nJohnston, Andrew James. “Marian Rewrites the Legend: The Temporality of Archaeological Remains in Richard Lester’s Robin and Marian.” In The Medieval Motion Picture: The Politics of Adaptation.

Woodbridge: D. S. Brewer, 1999.\n\nKnight argues that despite the critical and academic lambasting of Mel Brooks’s irreverent Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993), it still fits well within the mainstream of Robin Hood tradition. The author finds that the strength of the myth is in its ability to be mocked.\n\nLeitch, Thomas. “Adaptations without Sources: The Adventures of Robin Hood.” Literature/Film Quarterly 36, no. 1 (2008): 21-30.\n\nLeitch explains “both why viewers are so ready to dismiss adaptations of the outlaw’s story as unfaithful and why fidelity to an original text is impossible.” In the process, Leitch utilizes four models of adaptation: authorized, forbidden, creative, and as a general challenger to the social institutions of the day. The fourth is the most interesting and complex, worthy of more exploration.\n\nNollen, Scott Allen. Robin Hood: A Cinematic History of the English Outlaw and his Scottish Counterparts. Jefferson: McFarland, 1999.\n\nThis is one of the first book-length treatments for medievalism on screen, focusing entirely on Robin Hood. Nollen rightly brags that this book covers “nearly a millennium, the years 1066-1998,” as the first 84 pages covers the known history, legends, and storytelling of the outlaw up until 1900 in chronological order. This includes not only appropriated anecdotes from obscure historical figures, but also Scottish contenders for the outlaw title such as Rob Roy and William Wallace.\n\nThe rest of the book follows the cinematic releases of Robin Hood, again in chronological order of release. These chapters refer back to the history at the beginning, which readers will find useful to following along. Details include not only production information, but also identifying what was the inspiration for the characters and story elements. The author also focuses on Robin Hood-esque tropes that appear outside of the medieval period genre, such as westerns.\n\nThe end of the book includes 39 films with cast and credit details.\n\nPaul, Andrew. “Reassessing Blacklist Era Television: Civil Libertarianism in You Are There, The Adventures of Robin Hood, and The Buccaneers.” American Studies 54, no. 1 (2015): 29-52.\n\nPugh, Tison. “Queer Crusading, Military Masculinity, and Allegories of Vietnam in Richard Lester’s Robin and Marian.” Studies in Medievalism 19 (2010): 114-134.\n\nRichards, Jeffrey. “Robin Hood on the Screen.” In Robin Hood: An Anthology of Scholarship and Criticism.

The author argues that “any new film version of the Robin Hood legend must be seen against the background of our tradition of Robin Hood films and no film characterizes that tradition better than” The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). The author then explores changes and additions to the Robin Hood tradition throughout history. As for Robin and Marian, Stapleford concludes “the film is ultimately about us,” as it is stripped of its post-medieval “courtly chivalrous traditions.”\n\nStock, Lorraine K. and Candance Gregory-Abbott. “The ‘Other’ Women of Sherwood: The Construction of Difference and Gender in Cinematic Treatments of the Robin Hood Legend.” In Race, Class and Gender in “Medieval” Cinema.

Edited by Martha W. Driver and Sid Ray, 73-89. Jefferson: McFarland, 2004.\n\nHenthrone analyzes the rise of neomedievalism and its brand of masculinity in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which had its origins in a 19th-century view of the medieval world. The author uses this prism to view the original Star Wars (1977) and E.T. (1982), two coming-of-age films directed at young boys that “suggested that faith, loyalty, and courage were the basis for true masculinity and that women were simply victims to be rescued or prizes to be won.” However, the popularity of neomediavalism science fiction films would not last, as dystopian future films such as The Terminator (1984) and Aliens (1986) would come to dominate the box office by the mid-1980s.\n\nHume, Kathryn. “Medieval Romance and Science Fiction: The Anatomy of a Resemblance.” Journal of Popular Culture 16, no. 1 (1982): 15-26.\n\nHume explores five different themes common across medieval romance and science fiction. The author mostly focuses on literature, but the same conclusions apply to the screen, especially with evocations of Star Trek and Star Wars throughout the piece. Hume proposes several interesting parallels such as the knight and squire alongside Han Solo and Chewbacca.\n\nHume, Kathryn. “Quest Romance in Science Fiction.” In A Companion to Romance: From Classical to Contemporary.

New York: Palgrave, 2003.\n\nAlthough not exclusively focused on medeivalism on screen, Weisl spends half the book examining medieval romance in Star Trek and Arthurian legend persistent in Star Wars. This is a prime example where the definition of medievalism on screen extends outside the realm of historical films and explores themes in other genres such as science fiction. On that note, the rest of the book is just as fascinating, exploring the medievalism of baseball records set in the 1990s and the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Common themes include saints, relics, pilgrimages, confessions, gender, chivalry, and romantic deferral.\n\nTolkien\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien’s work (academic and literary) is entrenched in medievalism and there is a plethora of scholarship on his publications and influence. One place to start is the annually-published Tolkien Studies. The works below focus almost exclusively on medievalism in film and television adaptations of Tolkien, typically Peter Jackson’s two trilogies–The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003) and The Hobbit (2012-2014).\n\nAuger, Emily E. “The Lord of the Rings’ Interlace: The Adaptation to Film.” Mythlore 30, no. 1-2 (2011): 143-62.\n\nBarker, Martin and Ernest Mathijs, eds.

With this, the author concludes that “by shifting the audience from hobbit-dwarf slapstick to reserved heroism, the films promote what could be called a ‘traditional-essentialist’ view of the Middle Ages, one in which the medieval stands for hierarchical social order, for the erasure of difference in the name of preserving a dominant culture and for masculinist martial virtue celebrating unquestioning self-sacrifice as the highest good.”\n\nConversely, the warrior-heroes Aragorn, Gandalf and Legolas maintain a level of seriousness throughout. This “reinforces the films’ valorization of white, male, upper-class, able-bodied characters.”\n\nCarretero-Gonzales, Margárita. “Tolkien after Tolkien: Medieval and Medieval Intertexts in Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings.” In Fantasy and Science-Fiction Medievalisms: From Isaac Asimov to A Game of Thrones. Edited by Helen Young, 35-56. Amherst: Cambria Press, 2015.\n\nThe author explores the process of the filmmakers in converting Tolkien’s work to the screen. While one might consider Tolkien’s books descriptive, he still relied on “the endless powers of suggestion of what he termed ‘true literature.'” Thus, there was plenty of work necessary for the filmmakers in envisioning the precise details of buildings, rooms, and cultures, as well as “clothes, weapons, hairdos, costumes, furniture, and all sorts of other props.” Carretero-Gonzales explores the intertexts from Tolkien, as well as medievalisms that joined together to form Peter Jackson’s creation.\n\nComer, Todd A. “The Disabled Hero: Being and Ethics in Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings.” Mythlore 35, no. 1 (20016): 113-131.\n\nCroft, Janet Brennan, ed.

While Jackson’s films follow this approach successfully, the films take them one step further with accents.

In addition, these films tend to be more “about modern Western life in a period dress.” Regardless, Austin finds usefulness in both types films, as they challenge historians to re-read texts and rethink what they know about the past, encouraging more curiosity about history.\n\nBenson, Ed. “Culture Wars Medieval and Modern in Le Moine et la sorcière.” Film & History: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Film and Television Studies 29, no. 1-2 (1999): 56-70.\n\nBernau, Anke. “‘Poison to the Infant, but Tonic to the Man’: Timing The Birth of a Nation.” In Medieval Film.

The author makes the case that “there is a long history of twisting the facts of medieval conflict to suit the needs and interests of general audiences, so that current movies and video games actually fit quite nicely into a traditional ‘medieval’ mold of storytelling.”\n\nIn addition, “demanding that filmmakers and game designers shape up and ‘get their facts straight’ is disingenuous, insofar as it suggests that medievalists and military historians are all on the same page.” To make this case, Burkholder reviews some of the evolving scholarship on medieval knights.\n\nBurkholder, Peter. “X Marks the Plot: Crossbows in Medieval Film.” Studies in Popular Culture 38, no. 1 (2015): 19-40.\n\nBurkholder, Peter and David Rosen. “Child Soldiers in Medieval(esque) Cinema.” In War, Myths, and Fairy Tales.

New York: Palgrave, 2017.\n\nBurkholder and Rosen use the term “medievalesque” as opposed to medievalism to describe “medieval and medieval inspired cinematic fantasy worlds.” They found that the use of child soldiers in such films “are far more concerned with creating an aura of symbolic, emotional, and psychological authenticity than historical accuracy.” In addition, “the results are familiar depictions that are continuously recycled, creating immediately recognizable medievalesque fantasy worlds on the screen.”\n\nThe authors focus on popular films such as Braveheart (1995), the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–2003), King Arthur (2004), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Robin Hood (2010), and the Harry Potter series (2001–2011).\n\nBurns, David R. and Deborah R.

The threads of analysis include “hero/heroine saved through love and/or self-sacrifice”; “‘major personality shift’ of the hero under the influence of love”; and the “quest and rescue.” Films include Casablanca (1942), Excalibur (1981), Roxanne (1987), Pretty Woman (1990), Beauty and the Beast (1991), As Good As It Gets (1997), The Matrix (1999), Slumdog Millionaire (2008), and Tangled (2010).\n\nD’Arcens, Louise. “Presentism.” In Medievalism: Key Critical Terms. Edited by Elizabeth Emery and Richard Utz, 181-188. Woodbridge: D. S. Brewer, 2014.\n\nIn this article, D’Arcens defines presentism as “the practice of representing, interpreting, and, more importantly, evaluating the past according to the values, standards, ambitions, and anxieties of a later ‘present.'” D’Arcens identifies three approaches of presentism–first, using modern standards to judge the past; second, using the past as a nostalgic correction to modernity; and third, “depicting the medieval past as alive and present within modernity.” This last approach, D’Arcens sees as “an ingenious and playful variety.”\n\nAlthough presentism is by no means limited to the screen, D’Arcens cites multiple movies as examples including The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey (1988), Black Knight (2001), A Kid in King Arthur’s Court (1995), and Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure (1989).\n\ndeWinter, Jennifer. “Neo-Bushido: Neomedieval Animé and Japanese Essence.” In Neomedievalism in the Media.

Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2014.\n\nElliott takes on the lack of medieval and early modern period drama on British television, believing that these periods “can also bring something to the debate, frequently harnessing precisely those same values and ideas that characterize the more familiar kinds of period dramas.” To do this, Elliott focuses on Robin Hood, King Arthur, and the Crusades on their ability to address three key issues typical of period dramas–evoking national identity and nostalgia, producing quality British television, and dealing with contemporary issues.\n\nElliott, Andrew B.

New York: Palgrave, 2017.\n\nGrimbert focuses on love potion depictions in Tristan and Iseult films, which is “one of the most telling ways in which the directors distinguish themselves” in the retelling of the legend. The author examines four films–L’Éternel Retour (1943), Lovespell or Tristan and Isolt (1979), I Skugga Hrafnsina (1988), and Tristan and Isolde (2006).\n\nGrindley, Carl James. “Arms and the Man: The Curious Inaccuracy of Medieval Arms and Armor in Contemporary Film.” Film & History (2006): 14-19.\n\nGrindley, Carl James. “The Hagiography of Steel: The Hero’s Weapon and Its Place in Pop Culture.” In The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy. Edited by Martha W. Driver and Sid Ray, 151-166. Jefferson: McFarland, 2004.\n\nGrindley explores the “long campaign to define the hero by making fetish objects of his or her artifacts,” particularly weapons and armor. The exploration traces descriptions of hero’s weapons through Homer, Beowulf, and Arthurian legend before turning to films such as Dirty Harry (1972), Conan the Barbarian (1982), and Excalibur (1981). Grindley finds that the weapons are often the most powerful, yet only useful in the hands of their heroes, a concept that “has remained relatively consistent for nearly three thousand years.”\n\nHantke, Steffen. “Going Medieval: Representations of Post-Nuclear Survival in Threads and The Tripods on the BBC (1984).” AAA: Arbeiten aus Anglistik und Amerikanistik 38, no. 1 (2013): 3-17.\n\nHaydock, Nickolas. Movie Medievalism: The Imaginary Middle Ages. Jefferson: McFarland & Company, 2008.\n\nHaydock offers a mishmash of analysis across a multitude of films and themes. Although not a cohesive approach, the book is especially valuable for what Haydock has to say about particular films. In addition, the work is full of superb kernels such as “there are fewer and fewer barriers between the study of the Middle Ages and the study of medievalism. Indeed, all of us will one day be accused of having done medievalism rather than medieval studies.” And, “Our ideas about the distant past are perhaps more vulnerable to the lure of cinema because there is no immediate access to falsification. The very alterity of the Middle Ages works to make it an especially potent preserve of fantasy, the realm par excellence of the Imaginary.”\n\nHaydock tends to introduce potentially useful theories and models, but does not follow them through effectively. The simplest example is coining the term “cinemedievalism” and using it throughout the book, but the book is titled “Movie Medievalism.” This work is a difficult place to start for the uninitiated, but the more seasoned medievalist will undoubtedly find it intriguing.\n\nHodapp, William. “Arthur, Beowulf, Robin Hood, and Hollywood’s Desire for Origins.” The Year’s Work in Medievalism 26 (2011): 66-89.\n\nJancovich, Mark. “‘The Purest Knight of All’: Nation, History, and Representation in ‘El Cid’ (1960).” Cinema Journal 40, no. 1 (2000): 79-103.\n\nJancovich, Mark. “‘There’s Nothing So Wrong with a Hollywood Script That a Bunch of Giant CGI Scorpions Can’t Solve’: Computer Generated Images and Camp in the Critical Reception of the Post-Gladiator Historical Epics.” In The Return of the Epic Film: Genre, Aesthetics and History in the 21st Century. Edited by Andrew B. R. Elliott, 57-73. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2015.\n\nJancovich explores the reception of CGI in historical epics. Remarkably, Gladiator (2001) was derided for its use, but with the release of each new epic film, critics slowly began to accept it, especially by the release of Kingdom of Heaven (2005). Between Gladiator and Clash of the Titans (2010), the author found that most reviews attempted to engage in “political readings of these films in an attempt to add weight and significance to the practice of film reviewing, [but] these readings were not very developed.” Instead, the reviewers “were more concerned with the use of spectacle in these films, particularly the use of CGI.” Also of interest is the author’s discussion on the reception of King Arthur (2004) in this context.\n\nJewers, Caroline. “Hard Day’s Knights: First Knight, A Knight’s Tale, and Black Knight.” In The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy.
