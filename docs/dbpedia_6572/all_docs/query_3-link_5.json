        "text": "As a horror film, it is lacking a few key elements, such as a build up in suspense, a mystery to keep you guessing what will happen next, surprises throughout the movie that come from out of nowhere and fear. The film should have a dramatic build up leading to a big surprise at the end, but instead it just ends. It hardly creates fear, besides a few small jump scares throughout the film. There aren’t any moments that make you want to hide under the blankets because you're afraid of what will happen next, which is kind of what you would expect going to watch a horror film. Edgar Wright has used comedy to make the movie more relatable and realistic. This is achieved by having a\n\nInsidious easily fits the film conventions of the horror genre and themes. Insidious incorporates classic horror elements like haunted houses, ghosts, children being possessed, and outside experts of the spiritual world. A family with three children start to witness things out of the ordinary and are unable to understand what they are seeing. The mother, for instance, knew she was seeing strange deities, but her husband refused to believe it and thought she was just out of it. The classic element of denying there is anything out of the ordinary going on is a classic horror element. Typically the people who deny the reality that there might be something supernatural happening, are the first people to be killed or affected in some manner.\n\nThe rating system also ignores the fact that the age divisions are wide-ranging. The different age divisions are ages 0-13, 13-17, over 17, and over 18. The main concern is the group of kids aged 0-13. The problem with this is a four-year-old and a twelve-year-old would react in different ways to a movie because “younger children attribute life and realism to any character that looks real” while older children are more mature and\n\nIf there's one sub-genre of hip-hop that I'm not privy too, then it would definitely be horrorcore. Horrorcore, formed in the early 90s, saw rappers bring up horror-themed subject matter in their rhymes, often discussing topics such as serial killing and satan worship. I often find horrorcore rappers to be gimmicky, and reliant on cheap shocks rather than lyrical prowess (Insane Clown Posse has become a definitive act for the genre for these reasons). That said though, the genre certainly has an important place in hip-hop history, and in many ways bridges the gap between late 80s gangsta rap, with hardcore artists of the late 90s. With the success of gangsta rappers like N.W.A. and The Geto Boys, combined with the fact\n\nAmerican horror films have often played on our societal fears, and in Candyman (Bernard Rose, 1992), the film directly deals with race, reminding us that it is still very much a problem in society today, and that ‘our traumatic racial past still haunts us’ (Vern, 2015). The film ‘marks the introduction of an African-American monster to the horror mainstream’ (Donaldson, 2011) and it ‘succeeds in asking some very pointed questions about race and class’ (Elizabeth, 1992). Ultimately this is done by investigating ‘the obscure fears we harbour about the unknown’ – or the racial ‘other’ (Blackwell, 2015). Andrew Tudor says that ‘typically, a horror movie will exploit the tensions implicit in a particular contrast, confronting known with the\n\nA girl runs frantically through the woods trying to escape an axe wielding villain. The defenseless victim suddenly trips and collapses to the ground. The villain laughs wickedly as he lifts the axe above his head. The girl releases a final scream as the weapon quickly ends her life, causing the audience to go silent as they watch the villain drag away the lifeless body. Death, blood, guts, suspense, screaming, and terror are all just a few things to expect when watching a modern day horror film. What is horror? Horror can be defined as an intense feeling of fear, shock, or disgust. (Wilson) The description of horror is not very pleasant, but for some reason horror films are extremely popular. Why is this so? People are addicted to the\n\nThe horror genre is appropriate for young readers because we're old enough and we are the age of 12-13 years old. The horror genre isn't like the movies that are rated R while the stories are pg 13. We aren't kids that get nightmares so easily were the right age to read horror stories because it's way less gruesome than the news.\n\nAccording to King, civilized people enjoy horror movies because it shows that we are not afraid and it is a way to exercise our dark sides. Watching horror movies allows for use to face some of our greatest fears, and once conquered, we feel better about our abilities to face our fears. Every civilized person has a dark side to them and this can be feed by watching horror movies. The content in horror movies fuels our need to see death and other horrible parts of the human experience. In reality, horror movies keep some of our sanity in check.\n\nOne in four college students in a recent study said they experience lingering effects of a frightful movie or TV experience from childhood. (Bernie DeGroat) Fear is an unpleasant emotion caused by the belief the someone or something is dangerous causing pain, or threats. It is not appropriate for middle schoolers to read classic horror stories like “The Tell-Tale Heart”, because they can cause them anxiety and it can make them aggressive after watching scary movies.\n\nThe setting of the movie is just as important as any other aspect of the film. The fact that it takes place in a mental hospital/institution on a remote island surrounded by rocky cliffs, huge waves, caves, steeps along with a creepy lighthouse, where it is said cruel experiments take place, screams suspense and thrill. The island is surrounded with tall brick walls laced with electric fencing and only one port to leave and arrive. The facility itself gives off an eerie feel with its creepy architect. Inside, the buildings are littered with labyrinth style spaces that seem to almost consume its inhabitants. Flickering, somewhat, unreliable lighting and approaching storm adds to sketchy scenery. I feel this makes the audience feel at unease throughout the film, as if\n\nHorror films are movies that aim to elicit a strong physiological reaction in the viewer, such as raised heartbeat and fear. Three horror films by the names of Psycho, Scream and The Messengers will be analysed and compared to an episode of the popular children’s show Shaun the Sheep. Five elements will be addressed in this analysis, those being camera techniques, Mise-en-scene, Editing, Lighting and Sound.\n\nA sixteen-year-old boy sits on the couch and watches a horror movie. Suddenly, a scene where a man stabs a woman emerges on the television screen. The boy is not distressed by this scene because he is used to witnessing a great deal of violence before. He just learned a new idea and increased his criminal expertise. As a result, horror movies inspire copycat crimes. Copycat crimes are defined as those that are “inspired, motivated or modeled after acts that have occurred before in the media” (“Understanding”). The crimes themselves either mirror the inspiring acts or are simply based upon them. Violence and criminal behavior shown in horror movies affect people psychologically and physically. Watching violence in the media desensitizes people to the world around them and enables them to become more familiar with violence and crime. One may conclude that horror movies do not affect them because they watch horror for fun, however, people are unconsciously affected by watching horror movies. Although most people believe horror movies do not impact them, horror movies inspire people to commit copycat crimes in real life because the violence portrayed in the media psychologically damages people and makes them more aware of violence."
