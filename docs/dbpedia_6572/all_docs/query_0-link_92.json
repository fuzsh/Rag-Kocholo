Some attack Roy [the dad]. But they're driven away by a man named John Burwell, who Roy hires to help with the farm.\n\nAnd from the movie's Wikipedia entry:\n\nWhile at a local store, Jess [the teenage daughter] sees a newspaper clipping of the family, with the father revealed to be none other than John Burwell, who has always been kind to her.\n\nSpoiler about the ending:\n\nAs it turns out, John is actually John Rollins, the man who, in a fit of madness, murdered his entire family, shown in the beginning of the film.\n\nThere was a prequel movie released about the story of John Rollins named Messengers 2: The Scarecrow which is truer to plot originally suggested for The Messengers."
