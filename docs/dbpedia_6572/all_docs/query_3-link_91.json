        "text": "Horror comes in a variety of flavors, and “scary” is a fairly relative term. What terrifies one person might not work for the next. Luckily for fans of horror movies, Netflix has a wide variety when it comes to nightmare fuel and we’ve gathered the some of the scariest movies of all time on Netflix for this streaming list.\n\nWhether you’re in the mood for a simple scary movie, a slasher flick, a James Wan haunting, an indie thriller, something from Netflix’s original films, or a zombie apocalypse, there’s something for every kind of horror fan on this streaming service.\n\nHere are the 25 best horror movies on Netflix.\n\nLast updated on June 24, 2024.\n\n1. Hush\n\nYear: 2016\n\nCast: Kate Siegel, John Gallagher Jr., Michael Trucco\n\nGenre: Horror, Thriller\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 82 minutes\n\nDirector: Mike Flanagan\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nMike Flanagan has produced some spine-chilling work for Netflix in recent years with his Haunting of Hill House series and Midnight Mass but he excels at horror in its feature-length form as well, and this film proves it. The premise is fairly simple: a deaf woman (Kate Siegel), reeling from a break-up and seeking solitude in a cabin in the wilderness, is terrorized by a masked killer. What elevates this nightmare is how Flanagan puts the audience in Siegel’s shoes, having his villain prowl and stalk and rather creepily invade her home without her knowledge.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n2. Jaws\n\nYear: 1975\n\nCast: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss\n\nGenre: Thriller\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 124 minutes\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nWith just a few bars on the piano and an oversized mechanical shark, Steven Spielberg terrorized generations of moviegoers with Jaws. The film follows a local sheriff, a marine biologist, and an old seafarer who team up to hunt a great white shark who has a worrisome bloodlust and seems to be targeting a small beach town during the busiest time of the year. Spielberg’s camera work – the lingering, underwater shots, the quick cuts of flesh being torn from bone, and rows of teeth flashing to the surface – make this exercise in inciting aquaphobia even more chilling. You’ll never look at a carefree day at the beach the same way again.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n3. The Strays\n\nYear: 2023\n\nCast: Ashley Madekwe, Bukky Bakray\n\nGenre: Thriller\n\nRating: TV-MA\n\nRuntime: 100 minutes\n\nDirector: Nathaniel Martello-White\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThis British thriller from first-time director Nathaniel Martello-White pulls inspiration from Jordan Peele films like Get Out and Us to deliver a haunting examination of race, class, and generational trauma. With shifting POVs and a multi-chapter plot, the story follows Neve (Ashley Madekwe), a white-passing. bi-racial woman living the perfect life in upper-crust suburbia with her husband and two children. But, when two strangers from her past pop up to wreak havoc on her personal life, Neve is forced to choose between the truth and the fantasy she’s spent so long building.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n4. Vivarium\n\nYear: 2019\n\nCast: Imogen Poots, Jesse Eisenberg\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 97 minutes\n\nDirector: Lorcan Finnegan\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nImogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg star in this horror thriller that breaks up its bleak plot with bright moments of dark comedy. Poots plays Gemma, Eisenberg her boyfriend, Tom, as the couple prep to take the next step in their relationship: house hunting. But their search for the perfect starter home ends with them trapped in some sort of hell where they must raise a strange child before they can earn their freedom. It’s a total millennial nightmare.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n5. Paranormal Activity\n\nYear: 2007\n\nCast: Katie Featherston, Micah Sloat, Mark Fredrichs\n\nGenre: Horror, Mystery\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 86 minutes\n\nDirector: Oren Peli\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThe found footage genre certainly seems done to death, but the first Paranormal Activity is still a lot of fun and fright. Although it certainly spawned some not-as-great sequels and inspired plenty of copycats, the original should be on anyone’s horror binge list. The film focuses on a married couple’s attempt to figure out and put an end to the supernatural occurrences happening in their home by way of a tripod. It’s just realistic enough to give you nightmares, or, at the very least, make you uneasy about turning off the lights.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n6. Veronica\n\nYear: 2017\n\nCast: Sandra Escacena, Bruna Gonzalez, Claudia Placer\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nRating: TV-MA\n\nRuntime: 105 minutes\n\nDirector: Paco Plaza\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nAfter losing her father, young Veronica (Sandra Escacena) and two classmates attempt to contact the other side with a Ouija board during a solar eclipse. It’s a truly disastrous decision that might be frustratingly obvious in any other film. Naturally, something more sinister breaks through and it ends up causing turmoil in Veronica’s life, complete with hallucinations and hauntings and the kind of twisted nightmares that will scare you off of your own sleep.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n7. Creep\n\nYear: 2014\n\nCast: Patrick Brice, Mark Duplass\n\nGenre: Horror, Thriller\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 77 minutes\n\nDirector: Patrick Brice\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThis cult-favorite footage horror film from Mark Duplass and director Patrick Brice is an unnerving watch, with a terrifying tension that builds to a truly disturbing epilogue. Duplass is strange and off-putting here as an eccentric loner named Josef who posts a bizarre ad on Craigslist requesting a videographer follow him for 24 hours, documenting his life. He tells Aaron (Brice), the unsuspecting cameraman, that the footage is for his unborn child as he has an inoperable brain tumor, but the reality (and horror) soon dawns on Aaron that he’s the real star of this weird, deadly social experiment.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n8. The Ritual\n\nYear: 2017\n\nCast: Rafe Spall, Arsher Ali, Robert James-Collier\n\nGenre: Horror, Mystery\n\nRating: TV-MA\n\nRuntime: 94 minutes\n\nDirector: David Bruckner\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThis Netflix nightmare follows a group of friends who venture into the Scandinavian wilderness in order to honor their recently-murdered brother. The guys — Luke (Rafe Spall), Phil (Arsher Ali), Hutch (Robert James-Collier), and Dom (Sam Troughton) — are forced to take a different path from the one planned, a mistake that leads them to cults and sacrificial offerings and an ancient being who prefers to stake its prey. The scenery is gorgeous, the chemistry of the cast is spot on, and the premise, how these men confront their fears and failures thanks to a supernatural being, is promising.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n9. His House\n\nYear: 2020\n\nCast: Wunmi Mosaku, Sope Dirisu, Matt Smith\n\nGenre: Horror, Thriller\n\nRating: NR\n\nRuntime: 93 minutes\n\nDirector: Remi Weekes\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nLovecraft Country’s Wunmi Mosaku and House of the Dragon’s Matt Smith star in this British horror flick that paints a terrifying picture of life as an immigrant. Mosaku plays Rial while Sope Dirisu plays her husband, Bol. The couple flees their war-torn home in South Sudan, applying for refugee status in England and hoping for a better life. Instead, evil lurks, not only in their neighborhood but in their own home which houses ghosts that haunt the pair and force them to reckon with past injustice. Smith plays their case worker who ignores their concerns, forcing the couple to endure some nightmarish conditions before they can find peace in this bizarre and foreign setting.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n10. The Perfection\n\nYear: 2018\n\nCast: Allison Williams, Logan Browning\n\nGenre: Horror, Drama\n\nRating: TV-MA\n\nRuntime: 90 minutes\n\nDirector: Richard Shepard\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nAllison Williams has successfully parlayed her Girls notoriety into a series of horror films that have propelled her to Scream Queen status, and this mind-bending thriller continues that frighteningly good track record. Here, Williams plays Charlotte, a talented cellist who first befriends and then sabotages the talented student who replaced her. Initially, Charlotte seems to be the villain here, but there’s a twist upon twist ending that confirms even more sinister games are afoot.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n11. Crimson Peak\n\nYear: 2015\n\nCast: Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, Mia Wasikowska, Charlie Hunnam\n\nGenre: Horror, Mystery\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 119 minutes\n\nDirector: Guillermo del Toro\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nGuillermo del Toro recruits Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston for this gorgeous Gothic horror story that’s more unnerving than truly terrifying. That’s not a knock. Horror takes all kinds of forms, and this story, about a brother-sister duo (Lucille Sharpe and Sir Thomas Sharpe) with a deadly secret and a young woman trying to escape her tragic past, is certainly spine-chilling. Mia Wasikowska plays Edith Cushing while Sofia Wells plays her younger self, but Chastain has the most fun here, playing a deranged spinster with sinister plans for her brother’s new wife — including poisoned porridge and a bit of ghostly gaslighting — but the real star here is the setting: a Victorian-era mansion that breathes, bleeds, and holds the memories of its unlucky former inhabitants. It’s beautiful (as is everything del Toro does), and it deserves more hype than it’s been afforded.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n12. Apostle\n\nYear: 2018\n\nCast: Dan Stevens, Michael Sheen\n\nGenre: Horror, Fantasy\n\nRating: TV-MA\n\nRuntime: 130 minutes\n\nDirector: Gareth Evans\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nMichael Sheen and The Guest star Dan Stevens square off in this slow-burning beautifully-shot thriller that’s tense to the teeth-clenching degree in the style of The Wicker Man. Stevens plays a man who travels to a remote island to infiltrate a cult in order to save his kidnapped sister. While he tries to avoid detection he discovers dark secrets about the island and its inhabitants which test his faith when they come to light, throwing the cult into a chaos that quickly turns bloody.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n13. Gerald’s Game\n\nYear: 2017\n\nCast: Carla Gugino, Bruce Greenwood\n\nGenre: Thriller, Horror\n\nRating: TV-MA\n\nRuntime: 103 minutes\n\nDirector: Mike Flanagan\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nStephen King’s 1992 novel transpires mostly in one isolated lake house’s bedroom where its protagonist, Jessie, lies bound to a bed after her husband dies in the midst of a sex game. Mike Flanagan delivers a resourceful, disturbing adaptation of the Stephen King novel anchored by a great Carla Gugino performance with his take on the material. Forced to find a way out of her situation, while confronting her own past, Gugino’s Jessie is made to go to extremes, which leads to, among other things, one of the squirmiest scenes in recent memory.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n14. Fear Street Trilogy\n\nYear: 2021\n\nCast: Sadie Sink, Kiana Madeira, Emily Rudd\n\nGenre: Horror, Sci-Fi\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 330 minutes\n\nDirector: Leigh Janiak\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nBased on the book series from R.L. Stine, this Netflix trilogy ties three generations of townsfolk connected by a bloody curse. Each film makes use of a different horror genre: slasher, supernatural, and period-hauntings, beginning with a series of slayings carried out by an evil entity in 1994 and tracing their roots all the way back to the town’s founding colony. Your favorite installment will depend on which genre speaks to you but the comforting setting of summer camp in Part Two, along with a strong performance from Stranger Things star Sadie Fink feels like the standout.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n15. Under The Shadow\n\nYear: 2016\n\nCast: Narges Rashidi, Avin Manshadi\n\nGenre: Fantasy, Horror\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 84 minutes\n\nDirector: Babak Anvari\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThis Iranian horror flick manages to tie in relevant world events with a darker story of demonic possession. The film follows Shideh, a former medical student and mother trapped in her home during the bombings of Tehran with her daughter, Dorsa. The pair are soon haunted by a djinn, a malevolent spirit who can possess a human by taking what’s most important to them. For Dorsa, it’s her doll, for Shideh, it’s a medical textbook her dead mother gave her. The two fight to survive the bombs and this evil spirit, and you’ll be fighting to get to sleep after the nightmares from this one begin.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n16. #Alive\n\nYear: 2020\n\nCast: Yoo Ah-in, Park Shin-Hye\n\nGenre: Horror, Action\n\nRating: TV-MA\n\nRuntime: 98 minutes\n\nDirector: Il Cho\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThis South Korean zombie flick imagines a very specific Millennial nightmare — a zombie apocalypse interrupting your video game live stream. The film follows Joon-woo, a kid who’s forced to barricade himself in his parent’s apartment when a zombie outbreak happens after his family goes on a grocery run. He survives hordes of the undead and a self-imposed quarantine by bonding with a neighbor in the building across the street. But both the living and the dead have some pretty gruesome plans for them, so we wouldn’t count on a happy ending here.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n17. The Rental\n\nYear: 2020\n\nCast: Dan Stevens, Alison Brie, Jeremy Allen White, Sheila Vand\n\nGenre: Horror, Mystery\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 88 minutes\n\nDirector: Dave Franco\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nDave Franco writes and directs this psychological horror thriller about two couples whose weekend getaway takes a sinister turn. Dan Stevens plays Charlie who, along with his wife Michelle (Alison Brie), brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White), and his co-worker/Josh’s girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand), heads to a seaside cabin for the weekend. Charlie and Mina hook up after taking MDMA and try to conceal their affair from their partners. A suspicious groundskeeper ends up revealing their secret, and things take an even darker turn when a masked serial killer begins terrorizing everyone in the house.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n18. Blood Red Sky\n\nYear: 2021\n\nCast: Peri Baumeister, Dominic Purcell\n\nGenre: Horror, Action\n\nRating: TV-MA\n\nRuntime: 121 minutes\n\nDirector: Peter Thorwarth\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThis foreign language thriller gives horror fans not one, but two nightmare scenarios. A group of terrorists hijacking a place is scary enough, but when one of the passengers just so happens to be infected with some kind of illness that causes her to crave human blood, things get really terrifying.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n19. The Pope’s Exorcist\n\nYear: 2023\n\nCast: Russell Crowe\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 103 minutes\n\nDirector: Julius Avery\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThis horror flick about a holy man, Father Gabriele Amorth, who uncovers a larger conspiracy within his church has one thing no other movie on this list does, Russell Crowe riding a Vespa. Crowe plays Gabriele Amorth, the Vatican’s leading exorcist, who investigates the possession of a child and ends up falling deeper into a mystery surrounding his order. Almost as terrifying as the demonic rituals and old men in robes? Crowe’s accent in this thing.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n20. Bird Box\n\nYear: 2018\n\nCast: Sandra Bullock, Trevante Rhodes, John Malkovitch\n\nGenre: Sci-Fi, Horror\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 124 minutes\n\nDirector: Susanne Bier\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nSandra Bullock’s apocalyptic sci-fi saga spawned a ridiculous internet challenge and renewed our love for monster-driven thrillers. Sure, we never actually see the otherworldly beings that cause people to commit suicide if they open their eyes, but the danger they pose and the fear they instill is still viscerally real. Bullock plays a mother trying to protect her two young children and survive amidst a group of strangers with their own agendas and issues.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n21. The Invitation\n\nYear: 2022\n\nCast: Nathalie Emmanuel, Thomas Doherty, Hugh Skinner\n\nGenre: Horror, Thriller\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 105 minutes\n\nDirector: Jessica M. Thompson\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThis very YA-esque horror flick didn’t get enough love in theaters for its gothic romance vibes and its terrifically timed jump-scares. Sure, the plot is basic: a young woman (Nathalie Emmanuel) connects with her estranged family via a DNA-testing ancestry service only to find they have some dark ties to an immortal baddie and even more sinister plans for her. But the setting — an English mansion filled with secrets, ghosts, and darkened wine cellars — and the truly bizarre final act turn it into a horror watch that’s both scary and entertaining.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n22. Dawn of the Dead\n\nYear: 2004\n\nCast: Sarah Polley, Mekhi Phifer, Ving Rhames\n\nGenre: Horror, Action\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 101 minutes\n\nDirector: Zack Snyder\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nZach Snyder, George A. Romero, and James Gunn team up for this zombie cult hit that sees a group of strangers trying to survive an undead apocalypse. When a plague sweeps the globe, turning people into flesh-eating monsters, survivors seek sanctuary in a Midwestern mall where each must confront their own past traumas while fighting off the walking dead. This thing has it all — classic, oversaturated Snyder action sequences, an overabundance of gore courtesy of Romero, and plenty of quick-witted comebacks via Gunn.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n23.

Rebecca’s mom, Sophie (Bello) has been talking to a shrouded entity at night, one that calls herself Diana.

We Have A Ghost\n\nYear: 2023\n\nCast: Jennifer Coolidge, David Harbour, Anthony Mackie\n\nGenre: Comedy, Horror\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 126 minutes\n\nDirector: Christopher Landon\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nMost horror movies treated haunted houses as something to be feared and exorcised but not this comedy. No, this movie understands that when you’ve got a benevolent ghost named Ernest (David Harbour) living in your attic, you turn him into a social media influencer, rack up the likes, and rake in the cash. Harbour’s Ernest bonds with the Presley family when they move into his old haunt, but as his popularity grows online and the kids start looking into the mysterious circumstances of his death, the CIA comes knocking.\n\nWatch it on Netflix\n\n25. Cargo\n\nYear: 2017\n\nCast: Martin Freeman\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nRating: TV-MA\n\nRuntime: 105 minutes\n\nDirector: Ben Howling, Yolanda Ramke\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nMartin Freeman stars in this Aussie zombie drama about a father searching for a safe place for his family amidst a zombie outbreak. Freeman plays Andy, a fairly easy-going guy, who’s forced to make some tough calls when he gets stranded in the Outback with his newborn daughter during the apocalypse. He fights off a few of the walking dead, but the real danger comes from the living (what’s left of humanity after the contagion has spread). Freeman rarely plays the rugged hero type, but he does so convincingly here, and while there aren’t hordes of biters wandering the desert, the isolationist aspect of things makes this horror story feels eerily plausible.\n\nWatch it on Netflix"
