        "text": "Horror movies are a genre of movies that aims to make us feel uneasy and to evoke our fear. Ever since i was a little girl i would watch horror movies and even take naps to them. Today i want to talk about a specific horror movie that i loved as a kid. My favorite movie when i was little was “The Messengers (2007).” “The Messengers”, It was directed by the Pang brothers, Danny pang Phat and Oxide pang Chun. It is a supernatural horror film that focuses on a family (the Solomon family) that moves to a farm, and soon begins to experience unsettling, chilling, supernatural events, that threaten their safety and sanity. this movie was very frightful. The plot of the film was perfectly executed (in my opinion of course). the “Messengers” has a slow pace so that we the “audience” can become invested in the characters before the horror begins. the atmosphere plays a role is the emotions we feel watching. The lighting and the sound cause us to feel anxious and on edge. It causes us to feel uncertainty and makes us wonder when we will experience the next startling sound or disturbing event. So…. if you happen to be seeking a movie with a compelling story-line that will still linger in your thoughts even after the movie concludes, then this is the movie for you!"
