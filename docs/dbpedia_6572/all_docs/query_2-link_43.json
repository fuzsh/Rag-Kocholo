        "text": "I used to have this app maybe around 3 or 2 years ago and I used to be a complete addict because it used to be free and I was able to enjoy fictional stories for free but then, I decided to download this app again for the fun of it and maybe seeing if I could reread some stories but I go on the app and it seems now that you have to pay to actually read. 2 years ago I thought the paying to see videos and not having a wait time was pretty reasonable but not the actual stories itself. Plus the whole 4.99 per week seems a bit much just to read some fictional text message stories. Also reading the other reviews does not make your app look good when others read it so maybe take it into consideration that maybe you guys are overcharging?. Other than the whole paying situation, this app used to be amazing.\n\nHello. I had hook 2 years ago and It was fantastic made me a little addicted to it! Anyways I decided to download it a year ago again and I seen I had to pay in order to actually read the stories, I thought that was pretty much a rip off ... I understand that the payments and the money efforts but seriously? I thought you guys was going to remove that like it wouldâve been better to pay for the videos that the people send on the stories and texts, (I donât know if you do because I donât have the app right now). But then again I wanted to download it now because I havenât thought of anything of it ! I personally thought it was going to be good spooky, romantic, etc stories & then I forgot about the âpayment to readâ thing and I download it .. I get happy then I have to pay 5$ to pay and especially to finish at that? No thanks. I hope the people/person can develop and do something about that atleast? Thank you for reading I hope you have a wonderful day or night. Besides this report I feel hook was a good experience for me.\n\nI didnât even know what this app was until I got a five minute ad with a pretty good story in it. It wasnât exactly realistic but I thought it was pretty good and I wanted to finish it. So I downloaded the app.. and it tells me to pay money to actually get into the app at all. Okay now donât get me wrong, I donât mind paying to get into it but 20 dollars a month is kinda.. eh. But hereâs the thing that confused me. You see I wouldnât exactly have known about this but if you scroll down (and this is ridiculous because the only option we as the people reading see is the option to pay) youâll see that thereâs an option to sign in/sign up, and it doesnât even work. And if itâs there in the first place, then why have the option to pay? Also if it doesnât work then why just leave it there? Yeah so I may be deleting the app one way or another unless you fix this problem quick. I will compliment you on how good the ads are but at the same time thatâs no excuse to trick us into paying. That is all I got."
