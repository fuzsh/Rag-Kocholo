Have an account? .\n\nKristen Stewart is known for \"Twilight,\" but her filmography extends far past the franchise.\n\nHer lowest-rated films are \"Cold Creek Manor\" (2003) and \"The Messengers\" (2007).\n\nBut critics loved her movies \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" (2015) and \"Certain Women\" (2016).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStewart's lowest-rated film is \"Cold Creek Manor\" (2003).\n\nCritic score: 12%\n\nSummary: In \"Cold Creek Manor,\" Kristen (Stewart) and her parents (Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone) move into a new, rundown house that seems like the perfect place to renovate. But the house is actually holding a dark secret.\n\nThe movie is a mystery-thriller but critics found it dull and cliché, with some calling it \"too predictable and contrived to generate suspense.\"\n\nPeter Travers wrote for Rolling Stone, \"The only things haunting this movie are clichés.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe played Jess in \"The Messengers\" (2007).\n\nCritic score: 12%\n\nSummary: In \"The Messengers,\" Jess (Stewart), is the eldest sibling in a family that moves into a haunted house in the middle of nowhere. Jess experiences major poltergeist activity, but her parents think she's making it all up out of a need for attention. Things take a turn for the worst, and the only one who can see ghosts is her baby brother, Ben (Evan Turner).\n\nAccording to critics, this movie was a little too typical for the genre.\n\n\"Many of the images feel over-familiar, and the shocks a mite too forced,\" wrote Nigel Floyd for Time Out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStewart was Maddy in \"Catch That Kid\" (2004).\n\nCritic score: 13%\n\nSummary: In \"Catch That Kid,\" Maddy (Stewart) is the brains behind a high-stakes heist.

From their wedding to their honeymoon, the pair's lovefest is cut short when Bella gets pregnant with a vampire child and none of them know what to expect.\n\nCritics felt the fourth film in the saga was aimed too narrowly at fans of the franchise.\n\n\"By any normal standard, this is a terrible movie, with stilted dialogue and leaden pacing —every 15 minutes or so, the action stops for a musical montage involving slow-motion handsomeness. But the 'Twilight Saga' stopped being normal a long time ago,\" wrote Dana Stevens for Slate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe played a small role in \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" (2000).\n\nCritic score: 25%\n\nSummary: A prequel to the 1994 live-action film\"The Flintstones,\" \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" centers on Fred (Mark Addy) as he follows Wilma (Kristen Johnston), Betty (Jane Krakowski) and Barney (Stephen Baldwin) to Rock Vegas to try and win Wilma's heart.\n\nStewart had an uncredited role as \"Ring Toss Girl\" in the film.\n\nMany critics thought it was amusing enough as a children's movie, but that it played out more like an episode of television than an actual film.\n\nRoger Ebert wrote for the Chicago Sun-Times, \"It's not delightful or funny or exciting, and for long stretches, it looks exactly like hapless actors standing in front of big rocks and reciting sitcom dialogue.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe played Sophie in \"Anesthesia\" (2016).\n\nCritic score: 25%\n\nSummary: \"Anesthesia,\" centers on Columbia professor Walter Zarrow (Sam Waterston), who is violently attacked on his way home from school.

And the conversations are too stale to culminate in interesting romance,\" wrote Wesley Morris for The Boston Globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStewart starred in the movie adaptation of \"On the Road\" (2012).\n\nCritic score: 45%\n\nSummary: Based on Jack Kerouac's novel, \"On the Road\" follows Sal Paradise (Sam Riley) as he comes in contact with free-spirited Dean Moriarty (Garrett Hedlund) and his teen bride Marylou (Stewart).

For the first time in the series I felt I'd seen a real movie.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe starred as Bella for the last time in \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2\" (2012).\n\nCritic score: 49%\n\nSummary: In the finale of the mega-franchise, Bella (Stewart) must be turned into a vampire in order to survive the birth of her daughter with Edward (Pattinson). When the powerful Volturi coven finds out what they've done, Bella must learn how to quench her thirst and control her newfound powers so that she can help the Cullens defeat them.\n\nAlthough many critics thought this was the best of the franchise, others still saw it as a bizarre and overdramatic fantasy film.\n\n\"The final 'Twilight' movie, bizarrely actionless for much of its length, may be the longest whimper in Rom-Goth history. Even the title weakens the will to live,\" wrote Nigel Andrews for the Financial Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStewart originated the role of Bella in \"Twilight\" (2008).\n\nCritic score: 49%\n\nSummary: The first movie in the series follows Bella Swan (Stewart) as she moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, and falls in love with a vampire (Pattinson) who belongs to a well-intentioned coven.\n\nCritics were divided, with some praising it for staying true to what it was — a teen fantasy-romance — and others calling it a joke.\n\nAs Anthony Quinn wrote for the Independent, \"It gets a little silly, at times, particularly in the special-effects department, but Stewart and Pattinson are a quite mesmerising pair, and their twitchy, sidelong glances play out a duet of unspoken yearning that might just get under your skin.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was Snow White in \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" (2012).\n\nCritic score: 49%\n\nSummary: A dark and fantastical retelling of \"Snow White,\" the movie shows Snow White (Stewart) as a strong character who's able to save herself. She's forced to take on a huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) who is sent to kill her.\n\nCritics were confused by this dark retelling, and not even a strong cast and impressive special effects could save the film.\n\nScott Bowells wrote for USA Today, \"Stunningly shot and inconsistently acted and written, 'Snow White' has enough visual fireworks to keep the film afloat, even if star Kristen Stewart can't get out of 'Twilight' mode.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was Zoe in \"What Just Happened?\" (2008).\n\nCritic score: 50%\n\nSummary: Inspired by a true story, \"What Just Happened?\" centers on aging Hollywood producer Ben (Robert De Niro) who is trying to juggle his messy personal life and his struggling career.

Of all the Angels, she works the hardest, ensuring that the movie isn't forgettable,\" wrote Mark Lieberman for The Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was in \"Welcome to the Rileys\" (2010).\n\nCritic score: 54%\n\nSummary: \"Welcome to the Rileys\" tells the story of a couple (James Gandolfini and Melissa Leo) struggling to cope after the death of their daughter.\n\nStewart played Mallory, a runaway who helps to bring them back together.\n\nSome critics thought the film lacked depth, but others found it intriguing and praised the performances of its leading actors.\n\n\"Stewart's strung-out, frowzy performance is a timely reminder that the girl can act, but despite strong work from all three leads, the facile screenplay runs out of things to say fairly quickly,\" wrote Robbie Collin for The Telegraph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe played Lila in \"Undertow\" (2004).\n\nCritic score: 54%\n\nSummary: In \"Undertow,\" John (Dermot Mulroney) moves with his two sons (Jamie Bell and Devon Alan) to a pig farm in rural Georgia after the death of his wife.
