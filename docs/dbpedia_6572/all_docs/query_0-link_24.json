        "text": "Like Takashi \"The Grudge\" Shimizu, Hong Kong's cult horror directors Oxide and Danny Pang have been brought inside the Hollywood tent by producer Sam Raimi for their first English-language feature. It's pretty ordinary genre stuff, written by US screenwriters who cut their teeth on the Friday the 13th franchise. The result is a cross between videogame-style American horror and Asian-extreme exotica: gaunt midwest farmhouses infested with horrid imps with black hair and grey skin doing their creepy, creaky heavy breathing."
