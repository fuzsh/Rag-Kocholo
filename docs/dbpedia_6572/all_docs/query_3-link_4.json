        "text": "Recently, I sat down to watch “The Orphan” and while in many ways it is a movie that is all together forgettable; it did stick in my mind for the next day or two. Initially, I didn’t know why. I wasn’t giving it a close viewing and wanted to watch it, if only to have in hovering somewhere in my mental library should I ever need it. But by the next day, I found myself returning to think about the film and what it seemed to offer up.\n\nKeep in mind, there are lots of spoilers from here on in.\n\nThe basic plot of the film is that a family adopts a young sweet-appearing girl from an orphanage who eventually turns out to be evil adult in disguise and attempts to kill everyone that may not bend to her will. Basic horror fare, no doubt. But there were particulars that spoke to our cultural anxieties and battlegrounds. In particular, this film is loaded with meanings that suggest and reinforce the fear, anxiety, and disgust with the place of young girls in our culture.\n\nThe most evident is the orphan herself, Esther. Esther is an orphan, supposedly from an orphanage in Eastern Europe. However, when the mother searches for this orphanage; they have no record of Esther.\n\nLesson 1: By the fact that Esther has no actual origin, she becomes an “every-girl”; no origin, but just existing out of place and time.\n\nEventually, the mother discovers that Esther actually belonged to a mental institute because she had some strange and rare illness that caused her to not age.\n\nLesson 2: Girls are just deranged women trapped in young girls’ bodies.\n\nAs Esther’s truer nature reveals itself to the mother, she tries to do everything she can to stop the child but it becomes completely evident, she has no control over Esther.\n\nLesson 3: Parents let their children run wild and are essentially powerless to stop them.\n\nWhile her mother is powerless, Esther plays the innocent and sweet child to her adopted father.\n\nLesson 4: These girls wrap men around their fingers from the time they embody “Daddy’s little girl” up through “adulthood.”\n\nAnd eventually, Esther dawns her mother’s dress, puts on make-up, and attempts to seduce her adopted father.\n\nLesson 5: Girls have a “Daddy complex” and are hypersexualized beings who seduce of older men.\n\nWhen she can’t get what she wants, she targets the person and either kills them outright or threatens them into silence; through fear and intimidation.\n\nLesson 6: Girls have a mean streak about them that is sociopathic.\n\nBeyond Esther, we see other elements that also explain or hint at what’s wrong with our culture. Both the mother and father are presented as having significant faults. The mother had a stillborn baby and is a recovering alcoholic and the father had an extramarital affair (elements of both are blamed on each other).\n\nLesson 7: The reason girls are bad is bad parents. Reinforcing this point is that the parents are impotent; unable to produce a “healthy” baby.\n\nThey are not capable of producing a good child (this also taps into Lesson 3 since their impotence translates into lacking the power to control Esther). By contrast, the good daughter in this film is Max, the deaf child is friendly yet passive who tries to befriend and please everyone.\n\nLesson 8: Girls are meant to be pleasant and seen; not heard.\n\nEven the brother, Daniel plays his cultural role; interested in video games and fitting in with his friends, he resists accepting Esther into the family out of jealousy and publicly humiliates her at school. He starts to piece things together about Esther, but is too late and undone by Esther.\n\nLesson 9: The boys of today (men of tomorrow) are slackers and can’t even handle girls.\n\nWhen taken to the “professional,” a therapist, Esther is considered to be absolutely normal with nothing wrong with her.\n\nLesson 10: Therapeutic approaches to children is clearly part of the problem.\n\nIn the climax of the battle, Esther and the mother battle on the ice pond, the same site that we learn she previously failed at performing her maternal duties in protecting Max when she was drunk. The battle ends by the mother declaring to Esther that, “I am not your fucking mother!” and kicking her hard enough in the face that her neck snaps and she sinks into the hole in the ice.\n\nLesson 11: Some kids really do deserve to be beaten/killed.\n\nAnd that’s just a preliminary reading; there’s a lot more I could connect and develop if I looked at it further (but given the vitriolic content; I’d rather not). Granted the above is not a perfect or completely developed analysis, but the elements are there to piece together something that could be further developed. These ideas that lie under these particular moments are cultural cues that come up directly and indirectly, not only in other horror films but often in our cultural discourse on the news, and from our politicians.\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nWhat other themes or elements of The Orphan did you pick up on if you saw it?\n\nWhat other films attempt to demonize youth in such manners? How do they go about doing it?\n\nWhere else in culture do we see the coding of children as bad/evil/monstrous?\n\nDid you enjoy this read?
