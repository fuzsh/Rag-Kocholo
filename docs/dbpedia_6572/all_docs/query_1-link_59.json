        "text": "In his directorial debut, Jordan Peele steers away from his comedic reputation to make the suspenseful thriller that is Get Out. The film is very intriguing and keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat throughout from start to finish as you follow Chris Washington, a young african american man, who travels with his white girlfriend to her family’s house when he uncovers a dark secret. For the typical fan of horror/thriller, it's a must see.\n\nOn February 24,2017, director and writer, Jordan Peele, released the movie that would unknowingly liberate African Americans, while revealing the white, liberal, racist of America. Get Out is centered around Chris, an African American male, played by Daniel Kaluuya, who has reached the peak of his relationship with his white girlfriend, Rose, played by Allison Williams. When Chris is invited to meet Rose’s “liberal” family, he is consciously trapped into the “sunken place” by hypnosis so that his body can be enslaved and manipulated by his newly white owner. Specifically,it was planned that his brain be carefully disconnected, removed and discarded, and then replaced with the white person 's brain via nerve fibers African Americans are\n\nThe main character of Get Out is an African American male named Chris Washington. From Chris’s perspective, we see the narrative unfold and many uncanny events occurring that he experiences throughout the film. Chris is visiting and meeting his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage’s parents for the first time. Rose’s parents are a neurosurgeon and hypnotherapist. Everyone attempts to make Chris feel welcome, after acknowledging the fact that Rose never told them he was African American. Get Out connects a castration anxiety to racism when Rose’s family meets Chris, not knowing that he is black.\n\nThrough the use of images, films, and other media outlets harmful stereotypes are often times created. One of the many challenges that American cinema endures is the inability to correctly portray characters of color. Film directors have formed a habit of creating and defining characters in a way that the audiences can easily identify with, thus leading to the reproduction of racial stereotyping. Black characters have generally been stigmatized throughout the course of history as aggressive, inferior, and irrational beings. These common stereotypes are perpetuated through the use of redundant film clichés that have a significant impact on society’s popular image of blacks. Within the article In Living Color, Michael Omi claims that despite progressive changes in America pertaining to race, popular culture is still responsible for damaging racial stereotypes and racism. Whereas, within Matt Zoller Seitz article, The Offensive Movie Cliché That Won’t Die, he discusses film clichés such as “Magical Negro” that uses an African American character for the sole purpose of acting as a mentor for their oblivious white counterpart. However, Get Out, a horror satire on the micro-aggressive black experience, directed by Jordan Peele, debunks these racial stereotypes centered around black men. The film subverts the use of racial stereotypes, as it rejects America’s depiction of common black men behavior pertaining to their criminalized lifestyle, masculinity, and aggression in\n\nI decided to analyze the film “Get Out” because I feel like it’s one of the best films out there. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a film that uses both comedy and horror at the same time while also talking about issues such as race, class and more. Watching the film in the movies, I was constantly on the edge of my seat worried about what’s going to happen next to Chris who is explained later on. I remember even when the audience at the movies were cheering along with characters in the movie which made it even more funnier but entertaining to watch. It’s not often you will see movies that talk about racial issues that are happening today because of the most of the time it’s about stuff from the past such as slavery.In addition, I also liked this film because I could somewhat relate to the main character. He was always apologizing and being understanding in situations that was not his fault but instead the other person which reminds of myself. It’s important for me to analyze this film because I believe there’s many symbols and hidden meanings that I didn't realize while watching the first time around which made me want to dig deeper.\n\nFor every moment that seems to put someone on the edge of their seat, there is another that will make someone fall back in deep horror. If a person is looking for a movie that gives off the sensation of comedy, thriller, mystery, and makes someone wonder what will happen next, then they should watch Jordan Peele’s work, Get Out. Get Out is shown in a rather terrifying setting because of the different brutal acts toward African Americans. Get Out by Jordan Peele is an exceptional movie that shows the complicated relationship between the protagonist and antagonist, a horrendous and stimulated storyline, and the history of African Americans.\n\nThe movie Get Out expresses the objective racial tension amongst white and black individuals to a large, diverse audience. The writer and director, Jordan Peele, displays the concept of racism throughout the movie. Racism is shown in the white characters using the black character for their benefit, such as taking a black person’s body part to improve upon their own features. The movie is about a white female, Rose Armitage who brings her boyfriend, Chris Washington, to see her family. Little did Washington know that his girlfriend and family run a hidden sex slave business, where they lure black people to the white community and hypnotize them to take control of their minds and bodies. The scenes throughout the movie show white people using black people as resources and show how powerless black groups are. Peele’s purpose is to show society that racism still exists and many are unaware. He does that by emotionally connecting with the audience.\n\nInsidious easily fits the film conventions of the horror genre and themes. Insidious incorporates classic horror elements like haunted houses, ghosts, children being possessed, and outside experts of the spiritual world. A family with three children start to witness things out of the ordinary and are unable to understand what they are seeing. The mother, for instance, knew she was seeing strange deities, but her husband refused to believe it and thought she was just out of it. The classic element of denying there is anything out of the ordinary going on is a classic horror element. Typically the people who deny the reality that there might be something supernatural happening, are the first people to be killed or affected in some manner.\n\nGenre is a French word meaning ‘type or ‘kind’ (Genre, 2016). The film industry has been around for at least 100 years. The evolution of entertainment is growing rapidly through the use of media. And as these years go on, films have begun to fit into specific genres, and are important to appeal to the different types of audiences. Films can be described to genre in different types of ways, such as stars, director and narrative to help identify what genre the film is (Neale, 1990, pg. 49). Genre in films has become common because it helps give the audience a different expectation. One specific genre of film is a horror. Horror is a genre that tries to create, panic, dread and fear for the audience.\n\nJordan Peels’s Get Out (2017) is entertaining through its chilling aspects; however, it also focuses on an extremely important issue in today’s society. Peele uses the combination of sound and graphics to portray the ongoing issue of racism. In this film, a black man by the name of Chris (played by Daniel Kaluuya) is going to meet his Caucasian girlfriend of 4 months- Rose’s (Allison Williams) parents. Chris is very paranoid that his skin color may be a problem with Rose’s folks, but she assures him that her parents are loving of everyone no matter their skin tone. When Chris arrives to Rose’s parent’s upscale property, he is a little uneasy. The housekeeper and groundskeeper are African American and they have a very strange persona, which increases his discomfort. Through tone and dialogue, Get Out expresses how the factor of racism has continually added to the aspect of racial paranoia.\n\nIn America, racism as well as race relations are generally extremely sensitive subjects that are often brushed underneath the rug. Earlier this year, Jordan Peele’s Get Out graced the big screen, and left audiences with a great deal to digest. Peele’s first cinematic debut touched on the delicate topics of racism and the continuous devaluing of African American culture by “liberal” Caucasians in American suburbs. In this essay, one will explore the ways in which works written by modern political thinkers such as Nietzsche and Marx effortlessly add perspective through various theories on the difficulties brought to light in the motion picture, Get Out.\n\nGet Out is a horror comedy that is very refreshing and different from other horror comedies because it is not based on the impossible or paranormal activities like all other horror comedies but it is actually based on the fears of black people with a bit of exaggeration and extremity. It is both unsettling and hysterical because it is totally unafraid to call people on their racist tendencies. The film is centered essentially around that unsettling feeling when you know you don’t belong somewhere either because you feel you’re unwanted or perhaps even wanted too much. The movie is also centered around the age-old foundation of knowing something is wrong behind the closed doors with a racial, satirical edge. The scariest thing about Get Out\n\nA sixteen-year-old boy sits on the couch and watches a horror movie. Suddenly, a scene where a man stabs a woman emerges on the television screen. The boy is not distressed by this scene because he is used to witnessing a great deal of violence before. He just learned a new idea and increased his criminal expertise. As a result, horror movies inspire copycat crimes. Copycat crimes are defined as those that are “inspired, motivated or modeled after acts that have occurred before in the media” (“Understanding”). The crimes themselves either mirror the inspiring acts or are simply based upon them. Violence and criminal behavior shown in horror movies affect people psychologically and physically. Watching violence in the media desensitizes people to the world around them and enables them to become more familiar with violence and crime. One may conclude that horror movies do not affect them because they watch horror for fun, however, people are unconsciously affected by watching horror movies. Although most people believe horror movies do not impact them, horror movies inspire people to commit copycat crimes in real life because the violence portrayed in the media psychologically damages people and makes them more aware of violence."
