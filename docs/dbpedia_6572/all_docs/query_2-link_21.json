        "text": "The Horror Genre\n\nThe horror genre is a topic that can be written or filmed about. In\n\nthis essay, I will be concentrating on films, and how the horror genre\n\nis included in them. The main ingredients in a horror film are music,\n\nsound effects, lighting, camera trickery & special effects and most\n\nimportantly a clever, catchy, scary script. But to make horror what it\n\nis, a director will include many other things that create suspense and\n\nthe eerie atmosphere of the scene, or simply make us cringe. The prop\n\nare not just there to fill space, the costumes aren't chosen because\n\nthe character had to wear something or the film done at night because\n\nthe filming finished late. I will explain the reasons these factors\n\nare deeply thought about and invested in later, as well as the effects\n\nthey have on the viewers mind and the atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe actors and actresses in a film need to be suited for their roles.\n\nCould you imagine a film where Arnold Schwarznegger is the innocent\n\nmurder victim, and Dale Winton the serial killer? Don't you think it\n\nwould be a little bit more logical the opposite way round? Due to\n\nArnold's reputation as the killer or hero, people may not want to\n\nwatch him being brutally and mercilessly murdered; does Dale's voice\n\nsuit a typical gruff murderer's voice? But the actor is not the only\n\nimportant part - a characters costume can have a major effect on our\n\nemotions towards another. For instance, if the murder victim is smart,\n\nyoung business man, with a tidy suit, he would be considered a happy\n\nman, probably with family, the viewer may feel pity on him and his\n\nfamily if he is killed. This effect on the viewers mind is ...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...p a photo of a small girl or a painting of an old man?\n\nThis depends on the location - is it a business mans office or an old\n\ncorridor in a haunted castle? Also, the location and time of day is\n\nimportant. Does a murder happen in an isolated woodland cottage at\n\nmidnight or in the centre of New York at rush hour? And the sound is\n\nvery important, too. Sound effects need to be perfectly timed,\n\nincidental music needs to be of the right style at the right scene.\n\nThe action needs to be suited to character and personality, make-up\n\nnot obvious (unless intended) and have sensible and logical camera\n\nwork and lighting.\n\nIf a horror film has a well written script with no 'dead ends' or\n\n'gaps' in it, professional acting implied and an enjoyable, thrilling\n\nand scary plot, it will be popular and enjoyed by nearly all who watch\n\nit."
