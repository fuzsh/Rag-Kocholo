“The Messengers” is a pretty typical ghost story, with plenty of loud noises, creepy-looking ghosts, and other attempts at being spooky. The plot is not very original, and the movie is very slow-paced; I wasn’t able to get interested in any of the characters, either. Also, I found the truth behind the haunting, which is revealed at the end of the movie, to be predictable, as well as the ending. There is almost no blood or gore in the movie, and one positive thing was a teen girl’s confession that she had caused an accident due to drunk driving. She expresses great remorse and regret about her decision to drive under the influence, and talks about the strain that this incident put on her relationship with her parents. Only one person dies in the film so although the film comes to the brink of not being approved, it does make it with a two under our content rating.
