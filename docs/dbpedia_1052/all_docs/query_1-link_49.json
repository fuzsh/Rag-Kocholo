        "text": "Art Film Fest, Slovakia’s premier film event, is on the threshold of its 25th anniversary, only a year away. It will enter this new era with multiple new additions and improvements, including a new home, six varied screening venues, 13 programme sections and more than 150 films!\n\nThis year’s most significant change for the popular film festival is its relocation to Košice. The new setting offers ample space for what’s most important: first-rate films. Dozens of competition and non-competition films will be screened at five venues: Kunsthalle and Kulturpark, the former Kino Slovan, Kino Úsmev and the city’s open-air cinema.\n\nKarel Roden, Stephen Daldry to be joined by Laraz Ristovski, Sir Alan Parker\n\nIt’s no secret that this year’s first Actor’s Mission Award recipient will be Czech actor Karel Roden and a Golden Camera will go to British director and screenwriter Stephen Daldry. But now the festival’s traditional awards will also go to Serbian actor Lazar Ristovski (Actor’s Mission Award) and British director Sir Alan Parker (Golden Camera).\n\nGOLDEN CAMERA AND ACTOR’S MISSION AWARD LAUREATE PROFILES:\n\nLazar Ristovski\n\nThis famous Serbian actor, director, producer and screenwriter was born on 26 October 1953 in Yugoslavia and studied at Belgrade University’s Faculty of Dramatic Arts. Ristovski’s natural acting talent is demonstrated by his body of work to date: he has acted onstage approximately 4000 times and appeared in over 70 films, television series and productions, mostly in lead roles.\n\nHis big international breakthrough came in 1995 with his starring role as Blacky/Crni in Emir Kusturica’s Underground, which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes.\n\nIn 1996 he set up his own production company (Zillion Film) in order to produce his directorial debut The White Suit (Belo odelo). This auteur film (written, directed, produced by and starring Ristovski) premiered at Cannes Critics’ Week in 1999, achieving major international recognition. It was also the Yugoslav national entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Ristovski later created a literary adaptation of the screenplay.\n\nHe also played the circus artist Caruso in the drama King of Thieves (Kráľ zlodejov), which was the Slovak national entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Ristovski has produced 13 feature films, directed two – The White Suit and The White Lions (Beli lavovi), and is the author of three novels.\n\nArt Film Fest 2016 will be screening the following films with Ristovski in attendance: On the Other Side, The White Suit, The White Lions and Underground.\n\nStephen Daldry\n\nRespected British director Stephen Daldry started his career at the Sheffield Crucible Theatre and later directed extensively in Britain’s regional theatres. In London he was Artistic Director of the Gate Theatre and the Royal Court Theatre. He has also directed at the National Theatre and the Public Theatre in New York, taking many productions from Broadway to the West End and vice versa. His Billy Elliot the Musical recently commenced its first UK and Ireland tour, having just completed a hugely successful and highly acclaimed multi-award-winning 12-year run in London. It previously played on Broadway, in Holland, Seoul, Sydney, Melbourne, Chicago and Toronto, and across the US. In 2009, the production won 10 Tony awards, including Best Musical, more than any other British show in Broadway history. Stephen’s first four films (Billy Elliot, The Hours, The Reader and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close) together received 19 Academy Award nominations and two wins. His latest film, Trash, set in the favellas of Rio de Janeiro, was nominated for Best Film Not in the English Language at the 2015 BAFTAs. His award-winning London productions of The Audience and Skylight have recently finished Tony-winning runs on Broadway. Daldry has previously directed for BBC Radio and Television and is currently directing the new Netflix series The Crown, written by Peter Morgan. He is Director of the Pier 55 Performance Park in New York and was Creative Executive Producer of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the London Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nArt Film Fest 2016 will be screening the following Daldry titles: The Reader, Billy Elliot, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, The Hours and Trash.\n\nSir Alan Parker\n\nOne of Britain’s most distinguished directors, with a career spanning the Atlantic, Sir Alan Parker was born in London in 1944. After finishing secondary school, he began working in the mailroom at ad agency Collett Dickenson Pearce, where he gradually worked his way up to copywriter. Thanks to his talent, by the end of the 60s he was directing ad spots. He made his film debut by writing Waris Hussein’s film Melody (1971). The screenplay to his directorial debut, the musical gangster parody Bugsy Malone, earned him a BAFTA Award. Parker’s major breakthrough came with his prison drama Midnight Express, winning him a BAFTA Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Director (Oliver Stone wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay). For the drama Birdy, he won the Grand Prize of the Jury from Cannes, and Mississippi Burning brought him his second Oscar nomination. In this part of the world he is also well known for Pink Floyd: The Wall and The Commitments, the latter earning him a BAFTA Award for Best Direction. Another musical film of Parker’s was his adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s Evita, starring Madonna, created in conjunction with the music videos for the songs “Don’t Cry For Me Argentina” and “You Must Love Me”. Angela’s Ashes, his social drama on Irish poverty, won the Audience Award at the 2000 Karlovy Vary IFF. His latest film is the American crime drama The Life of David Gale, on an opponent of capital punishment who is himself sentenced to death. Parker has also authored children’s books and the memoir A Filmmaker’s Diary. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2002, and in 2013 BAFTA presented him with a lifetime achievement award.\n\nArt Film Fest 2016 will be screening the following Parker films: Angel Heart, Midnight Express and Mississippi Burning.\n\nKarel Roden\n\nKarel Roden is one of today’s most distinguished Czech actors, frequently cast in domestic and foreign productions. He was born in České Budějovice in 1962 to a family of actors, including his father, grandfather and younger brother Marian. After his studies at the Theatre Faculty at Prague’s Academy of Performing Arts (alongside actresses Ivana Chýlková, Vilma Cibulková, Eva Holubová and Veronika Žilková), he worked at various theatres (DISK, the Vinohrady Theatre, the Drama Studio in Ústí nad Labem, the National Theatre in Prague, the Theatre on the Balustrade, Labyrint). His portrayal of Bruno in a production of The Magnificent Cuckold earned him an Alfréd Radok Award in 1999.\n\nAt the start of the 1990s he travelled to the UK, where he attended acting courses and refined his English. Roden has appeared in dozens of Czech and foreign films. He made his cinematic debut in 1983 with Château Infinity (Zámek nekonečno), but audiences will more likely remember him as Honza in the romantic comedy How Poets Lose Their Illusions (1984). In her 1989 drama Time of the Servants (Čas sluhů, 1989), Irena Pavlásková cast him as the wimpy Milan. With 12 Czech Lion nominations to his name (for King Ubu, The Melancholic Chicken, Victims and Murderers, Parallel Worlds, Little Girl Blue, Habermann, Fall of the Innocent, Alois Nebel, Four Suns, Krásno and Photographer), he finally won one for his portrayal of the deaf Douša in Filip Renč’s Guard No. 47.\n\nIn 2001 Roden played criminal Emil Slovak alongside Robert De Niro in the US drama 15 Minutes, continuing to be cast as villains in foreign films like Blade II, Bulletproof Monk, Hellboy, RocknRolla and Frankenstein’s Army.\n\nAlso of note was his role of the father in the Czech/German/French/Slovenian/Slovak drama Family Film (2015, d. Olmo Omerzu), which brought him the Best Male Actor award at Cottbus.\n\nArt Film Fest 2016 will be screening the following Roden films: Photographer, We Are Never Alone and RocknRolla.\n\nART FILM FEST 2016: COMPETITION OVERVIEW\n\nThis year’s International Competition of Short Films will comprise a total of 36 pictures.
