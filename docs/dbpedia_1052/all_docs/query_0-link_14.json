        "text": "Goran Paskaljević, the director of 18 feature films including Cabaret Balkan, How Harry Became a Tree and Midwinter Night’s Dream, died Friday of lung cancer in Paris, his family announced. He was 73.\n\nIllness did not stop him from completing his final film, Despite the Fog (Nonostante la nebbia), which was shot in Italy last year. In the writer-director’s typical conjunction of personal drama and looming social disaster, the movie is about a couple who have suffered the loss of a son and give shelter to an orphaned migrant boy. It bowed at the Valladolid International Film Festival in Spain.\n\nBorn in Belgrade on April 22, 1947, Paskaljević studied filmmaking in Czechoslovakia at the illustrious FAMU school during the Prague spring. There he made his first short films; their themes of compassion for the poor and the despised immediately ran into censorship problems with the communist regime.\n\nIn the wake of the 1968 Soviet invasion of Prague, he returned to Serbia. His first feature, the gently comic drama Beach Guard in Winter (1976), competed at Berlin and won the best director award at the Pula Film Festival. It was co-written by Gordan Mihić, who became his longtime screenwriting partner.\n\nPaskaljević’s films, tracing the lives of ordinary people under dramatic circumstances, were festival hits. Special Treatment (1980) bowed in Cannes, as did Guardian Angel (1987), Time of Miracles (1989) and his only film set in New York, Someone Else’s America (1995). His Tango Argentina (1992) won the audience award in Venice.\n\nFull of tenderness, his films ranged from the gentle humor of his early work to dark irony and tragedy in ways that championed the downtrodden: outsiders, children, the disabled, Jews, Gypsies, immigrants. Though he always denied being a political filmmaker, he admitted that “you can’t avoid politics,” and time and time again his work and his outspoken interviews rankled the nationalists around him.\n\nWith the break-up of Yugoslavia and the rising wave of nationalism in Serbia, Paskaljević and his wife, Christine Gentet-Paskaljević, moved to Paris in 1992, and he became a dual citizen of France and Serbia. He returned home in 1998 to shoot the memorable Cabaret Balkan/The Powder Keg (1998); its electrifying snapshot of violence on the streets of Belgrade won Fipresci prizes for best film at Venice and at the European Film Awards.\n\nHis later films, many of which he wrote, directed and produced himself, maintained the high standards of his best work and included his Irish feature How Harry Became a Tree (2001) and the allegorical Midwinter Night’s Dream (2004), which bravely criticized Serbia’s role in the Balkan war.\n\nAmong his final films were The Optimists (2006), Honeymoons (2009), When Day Breaks (2012), in which a Jewish professor learns about his past, and Land of the Gods (2016), set in India.\n\nActors who have enlivened his stories included Miki Manojlović, Mirjana Karanović, Lazar Ristovski, Donatella Finocchiaro, Tom Conti, Colm Meaney and Adrian Dunbar.\n\nIn 2008, Paskaljević was honored with a retrospective at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, the same year he was named Officer of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\n\nHe is survived by his wife and children."
