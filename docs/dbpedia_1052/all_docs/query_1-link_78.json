        "text": "Who are you?\n\nWho am I? A man born in 1956. A father to a daughter. A painter from Serbia. I am an observer of the everyday, a dreamer of the past. My work is intimate, susceptible to the same changes as my thoughts and thus it speaks about me more than my own words.\n\nWhat are you inspired by?\n\nI feel inspired by life. When I was young, Belgrade, the city I live in, was a constant inspiration to me. As a part of an older generation, I find the world surrounding me constantly evolving. Finding how to communicate these changes through the language of art is demanding, but also very inspirational to me.\n\nWhat was the last movie you watched?\n\n\"Life of Pi” was the last movie I have seen. Needless to say that I loved the photography and the strong visual language it has.\n\nWhat was the last book you read?\n\nJednostavne price (Simple tales) by a Serbian actor Lazar Ristovski. His book deals with memories, recollections of the past, stories about the little people. Unfortunately, the book is not available in any other language but Serbian.\n\nI also enjoy reading Terry Pratchett and his fantastical view of our world.\n\nDo you have any role model?\n\nI don’t have any. All types of art have my outmost respect, and so do people who try to create them.\n\nWhat is your next creative project?\n\nI am hoping to finish enough paintings for a new exhibition inspired by Tumblr. The visual language of the blogs has been very interesting to me and I wondered how it would look if I would paint my impressions in a similar way. At the moment it feels like I am trying to connect the gap between the analog and digital expression.\n\nWhat do you like about Portfoliobox?\n\nI enjoy following the progress technology is making, but have no interest myself to learn how to use it. Since my daughter offered to help me with the website in her spare time, it was important that we can create high standard of presentation, and fast. I also needed a platform that would be easy to navigate later on, so that even I could upload pictures when she isn’t available. Portfoliobox meets all of these requirements and we are both more than happy about the service."
