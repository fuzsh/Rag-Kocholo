        "text": "The famous actor Lazar Ristovski recently announced a collection of \"Simple stories\" that represent great miniatures about everyday life and unusual people. Ristovski says that the stories \"are told in a simple way, as stories were once written and told, before there was television and the Internet, when the storyteller was trusted and when he was listened to with attention and full confidence that what he was telling was the living truth.\" .\n\nLaguna published these ancient, but also timeless stories in which the essence of human life is treated, and Montenegrin readers will have the opportunity to meet Lazar Ristovski at the first promotion in Montenegro, on Friday, October 9, at 19.30:XNUMX p.m. in the Cinema area. Boka\" in Kotor.\n\nLazar Ristovski (1952) graduated from the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade, played in more than 4.000 plays and had 73 roles in films and TV series. He also acted in several Hollywood films. As an actor, he received almost all the awards that can be won in this area. He received some of the awards at European festivals. He produced fifteen films and directed \"The White Suit\" and \"The White Lions\". He also wrote two short novels: \"The White Suit\" and \"How I Got the Oscar\". How were the stories from the \"Simple Stories\" collection created?\n\nThe stories in my book were a long time in the making. His whole life has accumulated in them. This book contains only some of the stories that I have been wanting to tell for a long time, or retell, and many of them are waiting for the next book. I wrote the stories in between, when I wasn't shooting movies and working in the theater, and that's why I'm publishing them so late. I've always had a lot to do, so the stories have only now come to their turn.\n\nDo you think these stories are cinematic?\n\nApparently they did. I didn't intend to write them that way, but apparently my long involvement in film caused the stories to have a solid dramatic structure. That they have what is necessary, a good story, interesting characters, as well as the obligatory twist at the end that gives the stories an unexpectedness, which both the reader and the audience in the cinema like to see. I have no intention of making films about anyone, but there are those who will. My older son Petar is a film director, so maybe he will make a film based on one of the stories.\n\nYou write about small people, about the everyday life of ordinary people, and in fact, these are all topics that bother each of us. Where did you get the inspiration for these characters?\n\nIt is always a combination of the lived and the imaginary. It is a combination of emotional memory combined with the writer's imagination and courage to dig into the darkest depths. A writer, or storyteller, like every artist, must be brave. He has to take a lot of risks and he has to be ready to lose and always rise stronger from the ashes of defeat. Art must hurt. Inspiration is therefore in us, as much as in the world we observe. For me, writing these stories was a new knowledge that the writer is someone who observes, but at the same time creates what he will see. That position is exciting by all accounts. You have not bypassed the present moment, which is particularly visible in the story \"Transition\". What kind of reality do you offer readers?\n\nThe reality in the books is always different from the actual reality. It's like when the cameras come on during filming. Everyone wants to live life in front of the cameras, but when the cameras turn on, everything becomes unnatural. And that is the magic of art. The reality that it is not.. Art is more than reality.\n\n\"Money is not for everyone,\" says one of your heroes. But yachts are not for everyone, not even for your hero Mech. From these examples we see that many people today lack measure. Why is that?\n\nThat's why I don't have a yacht, but a sailboat. Ha, ha. It is difficult to measure. The philosophy of living lies somewhere in that ability. Many have said before me: Don't fly too high, but don't fall too low either. If everyone could do that, then everyone would also be a sage. And that is not so. In my story, Meho wanted to show how successful he is in life, so he bought a yacht, but he knows nothing about the sea. But in the end, the sea was kind to him.\n\nMost of these stories are a reflection of today's times. What kind of moments are immortalized in your stories?\n\nThese are moments that we all experience every day, but they are not our focus. When someone puts them in the focus of interest, they become visible and therefore important. My heroes are, as it is often said, small people. But in my stories, they are not deprived of the right to think about big topics, such as life, death, love, jealousy, envy, evil, or good. That's how small people become big, when they start asking themselves the questions that philosophers ask themselves. We also ask ourselves these questions every day, but we don't try to find answers to them. In this laziness of ours lies the downfall and decline of civilization.\n\nI want to leave something else behind\n\nBehind you is a rich acting career both in theater and film. You were a producer and director, and Hamlet, you played in Hollywood films. Do you have unfulfilled acting ambitions?\n\nYou need to have a measure. I performed in the theater more than 4.000 plays and we shot over seventy films and TV dramas. I worked with the greatest directors of the world. I could be satisfied. However, fitting in is a hint of the end, and I still want to leave something behind. Will I really succeed, the near future will show.\n\nEurope has grown old and now needs a young lover\n\nIn the story \"The Fisherman and the Ballerina\" you call Europe an \"aged cousin\". Why? Are these refugees who arrive in Europe every day the young relatives of Europe?\n\nEurope is steeped in decadence. Europeans think they can rely forever on history and the past. What Europe once was, is no longer. She must more willingly receive young blood into her veins, even if it is in the form of refugees from the Middle East. Europe has grown old and needs a young lover."
