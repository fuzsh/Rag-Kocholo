        "text": "Miloš Bajić was brought to the infamous Mauthausen concentration camp in the autumn of 1944, right after he began art school in Belgrade. Registered as prisoner 106621, with a note that said RETURN UNDESIRABLE, he secretly drew the crimes committed in the camp and every movement of the prisoners. He hid his drawings, knowing that he would be shot if they were found. Every new line led him closer to death, but it was also what kept him alive. LINE OF LIFE is a film about the painter and professor Miloš Bajić. But it's also a film about life in the 20th century, which brought to the Balkan region a period of great destruction and great reconstruction. The cruelty of war valued human life only as much as much as a man was able to work in a monstrous concentration camp. Eleven million people did not get the chance to live, create or build families after that war. Main character Miloš Bajić defeats his own death with his imagination and art.\n\nDarko Bajić was born in Belgrade in 1955. Since 1986 he has been active professor at the Department of Film Direction, as well as Associate Dean and Head of Department for FTV Direction in several mandates at the Faculty of Drama. He is owner and Managing Director of production company the Magic Line. He won numerous international and local awards, and his films and TV series have had high viewership. He is also founder and President of Association of Film Directors of Serbia and Serbian Film Centre, and was twice elected Head of Managing Board. He has been working at the department of film directing of the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade, Serbia for 30 years. His students are now renowned authors."
