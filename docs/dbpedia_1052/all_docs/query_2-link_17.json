        "text": "Lazar Ristovsky’s short novel, The White Suit, based on the screenplay for the film of the same name, is the finale of a major authorial endeavor, unique in our culture. The producer, screenwriter, director and lead actor of the movie “White Suit”, Ristovski, is now emerging as a novelist, showing, in the right way, that where giftedness and high professionalism imply, versatility does not have to interfere with the creation of works possessing certain artistic values. There are almost no similar examples in our country, and on an international scale, actor and writer Sam Shepard could serve as an approximate and very charming rapper.\n\nLazar Ristovsky’s short novel, The White Suit, based on the screenplay for the film of the same name, is the finale of a major authorial endeavor, unique in our culture.

There are almost no similar examples in our country, and on an international scale, actor and writer Sam Shepard could serve as an approximate and very charming rapper.\n\n“How I Got an Oscar …” was originally a film script that, after a 10-year hiatus, turned Ristovski into a literary work. According to the author, the novel itself is about everything a reader would like to experience in life, and for which there is no courage. He says that he experienced everything in a dream, but that the reader would not believe it to be true he chose the form of a dream dream. What’s unusual is that all the heroes are real, Ristovski is at the forefront of the story, while the events are fictional.\n\n“How I Got an Oscar …” was originally a film script that, after a 10-year hiatus, turned Ristovski into a literary work.

What’s unusual is that all the heroes are real, Ristovski is at the forefront of the story, while the events are fictional.\n\nLazar Ristovski and Bozo Koprivica have prepared the ” Anthology of Serbian Poetry ”, which is a selection of over 200 poems and 100 poets, intended for students, students, workers, peasants and honest intelligence. Among others, the anthology includes songs by Ducic, Santic, Rakic, Njegos, Laza Kostic, Dis, Desanka Maksimovic, Crnjanski, Andric, Branko Miljkovic, Matija Beckovic, Danilo Kis, Miroslav Antic, Ljubomir Simovic, Novica Tadic, Miodrag, Miodrag , Jelena Lengold, Milena Markovic, but also contemporary troubadours like Brega, Bora, Bajaga and Neletâ¦\n\nThe simple stories of bird, love, evil, river, death, loneliness, duplicate, mirror, suicide, fear, ship, futility, bicycle, tear, joy, nobility, sea … go unchallenged into strange stories. In the haiku novels of Ristovski, all the stories in the set, fiction, humor. He does this often, masterfully, the way he plays in theater and on film.\n\nThe simple stories of bird, love, evil, river, death, loneliness, duplicate, mirror, suicide, fear, ship, futility, bicycle, tear, joy, nobility, sea … go unchallenged into strange stories. In the haiku novels of Ristovski, all the stories in the set, fiction, humor. He does this often, masterfully, the way he plays in theater and on film.\n\nThis second book, the story of Lazar Ristovsky, solidifies this versatile artist as a gifted writer who has enriched his literary process and expanded the thematic framework of his literary interests. The events of daily life and the destiny of the “little people” are accompanied in each story by a surprising twist, and the drama of the action and the conviction of the dialogue are achieved through personal humor and irony. Told in the third person, all the stories in this collection are united by the melancholy mood and understanding of the psychology of its characters, which classifies some of the stories into true pearls of short prose in contemporary Serbian literature."
