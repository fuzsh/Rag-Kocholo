        "text": "\"Shepherd rock\" years: rise to fame and \"Dugmemania\" (1974–79)\n\nIn January 1974, with Borota, the band completed the \"Top\" and \"Ove ću noći naći blues\" recordings. The band and Borota offered these recordings to the recently-established Sarajevo-based record label Diskoton, however, the label's top executive Slobodan Vujović rejected them, stating that the label already has a great number of signed acts and that Bijelo Dugme would have to wait for at least six months for the single to be released. The decision would soon come to be considered the biggest business blunder in the history of Yugoslav record publishing. On the same day the band were refused by Diskoton, they obtained a five-year contract with the Zagreb-based Jugoton label. On 29 March 1974 \"Top\" and \"Ove ću noći naći blues\" were released on a 7-inch single that would eventually sell 30,000 copies.\n\nThe band started promoting the single, performing mostly in smaller towns. Stanković, unsatisfied with the agreement that only Bregović would compose the band's songs and feeling he did not fit in with the rest of the members, continued to perform with Bijelo Dugme, but avoided any deeper relations with other members. Soon after, Bregović, Bebek, Ivandić and Pravdić decided to exclude him from the band. Redžić was invited to join the band, which he accepted, despite his previous conflict with Bregović. The following 7-inch single, featuring the songs \"Glavni junak jedne knjige\" (\"The Main Character of a Book\"), with lyrics written by poet Duško Trifunović, and \"Bila mama Kukunka, bio tata Taranta\" (\"There Was Mommy Kukunka, There Was Daddy Taranta\"), was almost at the same time released by both Jugoton and Diskoton, as Bregović signed contracts with both of the labels. This scandal brought huge press covering and increased the single sales.\n\nThe band had their first bigger performance at the 1974 BOOM Festival in Ljubljana, where they performed alongside Bumerang, Cvrčak i Mravi, Tomaž Domicelj, Hobo, Grupa 220, Jutro, Ivica Percl, S Vremena Na Vreme, YU Grupa, Drago Mlinarec, Nirvana, Grupa Marina Škrgatića and other acts and were announced as \"the new hopes\". The live version of \"Ove ću noći naći blues\" appeared on the double live album Pop Festival Ljubljana '74 – BOOM. This was also Bijelo Dugme's first performance on which the members of the group appeared in their glam rock outfits, which brought them new attention of the media. The band spent the summer performing in Cavtat and preparing songs for their first album. They soon released their third single, with the songs \"Da sam pekar\" (\"If I Was a Baker\") and \"Selma\". \"Da sam pekar\" was musically inspired by the traditional \"deaf kolo\", while \"Selma\", with lyrics written by poet Vlado Dijak, was a hard rock ballad. Over 100,000 copies of the single were sold, becoming Bijelo Dugme's first gold record.\n\nThis single was their last produced by Borota at the Jugoton recording studio in Zagreb.\n\nDuring September, the band performed as the opening band for Tihomir \"Pop\" Asanović's Jugoslovenska Pop Selekcija, and during October, in studio Akademik in Ljubljana, they recorded their debut album Kad bi' bio bijelo dugme. Several days before the album release, wanting to appear in the media as much as possible, Bijelo Dugme performed at the Skopje Festival, playing the song \"Edna nadež\" (\"One Hope\") by composer Grigor Koprov. Bregović later described this event as \"the greatest disgrace in Bijelo Dugme's career\". Bebek sung in bad Macedonian, and the band did not fit in well in the ambient of a pop festival. On the next evening, the band performed, alongside Pop Mašina, Smak and Crni Biseri, in Belgrade's Trade Union Hall, on the Radio Belgrade show Veče uz radio (Evening by the Radio) anniversary celebration, and managed to win the audience's attention. At the time, Bijelo Dugme cooperated with manager Vladimir Mihaljek, who managed to arrange the band to perform as an opening band on Korni Grupa's farewell concert in Sarajevo's Skenderija, which won them new fans, as about 15,000 people in the audience were thrilled with Bijelo Dugme's performance.\n\nKad bi' bio bijelo dugme, featuring a provocative cover designed by Dragan S. Stefanović (who would also design covers for the band's future releases), saw huge success. It brought a number of commercial hard rock songs with folk music elements, which were described as \"pastirski rok\" (shepherd rock) by journalist Dražen Vrdoljak. This term was (and still is) sometimes used by the Yugoslav critics to classify Bijelo Dugme's sound.[21][22] The album featured the new versions of \"Kad bi' bio bijelo dugme\" and \"Patim, evo, deset dana\", \"Sve ću da ti dam samo da zaigram\" (\"I'll Give You Everything Only to Dance\"), ballad \"Selma\", blues track \"Blues za moju bivšu dragu\" (\"Blues For My Ex-Darling\") and rock and roll-influenced hit \"Ne spavaj, mala moja, muzika dok svira\" (\"Don't You Sleep, Baby, while the Music Is Playing\"). Immediately after the release, the album broke the record for the best selling Yugoslav rock album, previously held by YU Grupa's debut album, which was sold in more than 30,000 copies. In February 1975, Bijelo Dugme was awarded a gold record at the Opatija Festival, as they, up to that moment, sold their debut album in more than 40,000 copies. The final number of copies sold was about 141,000.\n\nIn late February 1975, Mihaljek organized Kongres rock majstora (Congress of Rock Masters), an event conceptualized as a competition between the best Yugoslav guitarists at the time. Although Smak guitarist Radomir Mihajlović Točak left the best impression on the gathered crowd, he was not officially recognized due to his band not being under contract with Jugoton, a record label that financially supported the competition. Instead, Vedran Božić (of Time), Josip Boček (formerly of Korni Grupa), Bata Kostić (of YU Grupa), and Bregović were proclaimed the best. Each of them got to record one side on the Kongres rock majstora double album. While the other three guitarists recorded their songs with members of YU Grupa, Bregović decided to work with his own band and Zagreb String Quartet. After the album was released, the four guitarists went on a joint tour, on which they were supported by YU Grupa members. At the time, Bijelo Dugme released the single \"Da mi je znati koji joj je vrag\" (\"If I Could Just Know What the Hell Is Wrong with Her\"), after which they started their first big Yugoslav tour. In the spring of 1975, they were already considered the most popular Yugoslav band. Soon after, Bebek took part in an event similar to Kongres rock majstora – Rock Fest '75, the gathering of the most popular Yugoslav singers of the time; besides Bebek, the event featured Marin Škrgatić (of Grupa Marina Škrgatića), Mato Došen (of Hobo), Aki Rahimovski (of Parni Valjak), Seid Memić \"Vajta\" (of Teška Industrija), Boris Aranđelović (of Smak), Hrvoje Marjanović (of Grupa 220), Dado Topić (of Time) and Janez Bončina \"Benč\" (of September).\n\nBefore the recording of their second album, Bijelo Dugme went to the village Borike in Eastern Bosnia to work on the songs and prepare for the recording sessions. The album Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu (What Would You Give to Be in My Place) was recorded in London during November 1975. It was produced by Neil Harrison who previously worked with Cockney Rebel and Gonzalez.[24] The bass guitar on the album was played by Bebek, as Redžić injured his middle finger just before the recording sessions started. Nevertheless, Redžić was credited on the album, as he worked on the bass lines, and directed Bebek during the recording. The lyrics for the title track were written by Duško Trifunović, while the rest of the lyrics were written by Bregović. The band used the time spent in studio to record an English language song \"Playing the Part\", with lyrics written by lyricist Dave Townsend, released on a promo single which was distributed to journalists. The album was a huge commercial success, bringing hits \"Tako ti je, mala moja, kad ljubi Bosanac\" (\"That's How It Is, Baby, When You Kiss a Bosnian\"), \"Došao sam da ti kažem da odlazim\" (\"I've Come to Tell You that I'm Leaving\"), \"Ne gledaj me tako i ne ljubi me više\" (\"Don't Look at Me like That and Kiss Me No More\") and \"Požurite, konji moji\" (\"Hurry Up, My Horses\") and selling more than 200,000 copies. After the first 50,000 records were sold, Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu became the first Yugoslav album to be credited as diamond record. After it was sold in more than 100,000 copies, it became the first platinum record in the history of Yugoslav record publishing, and after it sold more than 200,000 copies it was branded simply as \"2× platinum record\".\n\nAfter Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu release, the band went on a warming-up tour across Kosovo and Metohija. During the tour, injured Redžić was replaced by former Kamen na Kamen member Mustafa \"Mute\" Kurtalić. The album's initial promotion was scheduled to take place on the band's New Year's 1976 concert at Belgrade Sports Hall in Belgrade, with Pop Mašina, Buldožer and Cod as the opening bands. However, five days before New Year's, the band canceled the concert due to getting invited to perform for Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, as part of the New Year's celebration being organized for him. Their performance was, however, stopped after only several minutes, reputedly because of the loudness.\n\nAs Redžić had to leave the band due to his army obligations, a bass guitarist for live performances had to be hired. Kurtalić asked for higher fees, so the new temporary bassist became Formula 4 leader Ljubiša Racić. This lineup of the band went on a large Yugoslav tour. In Sarajevo the band performed in front of 15,000 people and in Belgrade they held three sold-out concerts in Pionir Hall, with approximately 6,000 people per concert. On the concerts, the band for the first time introduced a set of several songs performed unplugged. The press coined the term \"Dugmemanija\" (Buttonmania) and the socialist public went into an argument over the phenomena.\n\nAt the beginning of 1976, the band planned to hold a United States tour, however they gave up the idea after the suspicion that the planned concerts were organized by pro-ustaše emigrants from Yugoslavia. The band did go to the United States, but only to record the songs \"Džambo\" (\"Jumbo\") and \"Vatra\" (\"Fire\"), which were released as Ivandić's solo single, and \"Milovan\" and \"Goodbye, Amerika\" (\"Goodbye, America\"), which were released as Bebek's solo single. The records represented the introduction of funk elements in Bijelo Dugme sound. During the band's staying in America, Bregović managed to persuade Bebek, Pravdić and Ivandić to sign a waiver, with which they relinquished the rights to the name Bijelo Dugme in favor of him. In June, the band members went to the youth work action Kozara 76, which was Bregović's response to the claims that the band's members were \"pro-Western oriented\". At the beginning of autumn, Ivandić and Pravdić left the band due to their stints in te Yugoslav army. They were replaced by Vukašinović (who, after Kodeksi disbanded, played with Indexi) and Laza Ristovski respectively. Ristovski's moving from Smak, at the time Bijelo Dugme's main competitors on the Yugoslav rock scene, saw huge covering in the media.\n\nThe band prepared for the recording of their third album in Borike. The album's working title was Sve se dijeli na dvoje, na tvoje i moje (Everything Is Split in Two, Yours and Mine) after a poem by Duško Trifunović. Bregović did not manage to write the music on the lyrics (they were later used for the song recorded by Jadranka Stojaković), so he intended to name the album Hoću bar jednom da budem blesav (For Once I Want to Be Crazy), but Jugoton editors did not like this title. The album was eventually titled Eto! Baš hoću! (There! I Will!). The album was once again recorded in London with Harrison as the producer and Bebek playing the bass guitar. It was released on 20 December 1976. The album hits included hard rock tunes \"Izgledala je malo čudno u kaputu žutom krojenom bez veze\" (\"She Looked a Little Bit Weird in a Yellow Sillymade Coat\") and \"Dede bona, sjeti se, de tako ti svega\" (\"Come on, Remember, for God's Sake\"), folk-oriented \"Slatko li je ljubit' tajno\" (\"It's So Sweet to Kiss Secretly\"), simple tune \"Ništa mudro\" (\"Nothing Smart\", featuring lyrics written by Duško Trifunović) and two ballads, symphonic-oriented \"Sanjao sam noćas da te nemam\" (\"I Dreamed Last Night that I Didn't Have You\") and less complex \"Loše vino\" (\"Bad Wine\", written by Bregović and singer-songwriter Arsen Dedić and originally recorded by singer Zdravko Čolić). In the meantime, Racić asked for higher payment, so he got fired. He was replaced by Sanin Karić, who was at the time a member of Teška Industrija. This lineup of the band went on the tour across Poland, on which they were announced as \"the leading band among young Yugoslav groups\" and held nine successful concerts. After the band's return from Poland, Redžić and Ivandić rejoined them. After leaving Bijelo Dugme, Vukašinović would form the hard rock/heavy metal band Vatreni Poljubac.\n\nIn 1977 the band went on a Yugoslav tour, but experienced problems during it. The clashes within the band were becoming more and more frequent, the concerts were followed by technical difficulties and bad reviews in the press, and the audience was not interested in the band's concerts as it was during previous tours. Three concerts in Belgrade's Pionir Hall, on 3, 4 and 5 March, were not well attended, and the second one had to be cut short after the shock wave from the Vrancea earthquake was felt. The Adriatic coast tour was canceled, as well as concerts in Zagreb and Ljubljana for which the recording of a live album was planned. After four years, Bijelo Dugme saw a decline in popularity and rumors about the band's disbandment appeared in the media.\n\nThe band wanted to organize some sort of spectacle to help their decreased popularity. On the idea of journalist Petar \"Peca\" Popović, the band decided to hold a free open-air concert at Belgrade's Hajdučka česma on 28 August 1977. Jutro had already performed on this location in 1973, on a concert organized by the band Pop Mašina. The concert would also be Bijelo Dugme's last concert before the hiatus due to Bregović's army duty. The whole event was organized in only five days. Between 70,000 and 100,000 spectators attended the concert, which was the biggest number of spectators on a rock concert in Yugoslavia up to that point. After the opening acts – Slađana Milošević, Tako, Zdravo, Džadžo, Suncokret, Ibn Tup and Leb i Sol – Bijelo Dugme played a very successful concert. Despite the fact that the concert was secured by only twelve police officers, there were no larger incidents. Video recordings from the concert appeared in Mića Milošević's film Tit for Tat. Eventually, it was discovered that the audio recordings could not be used for the live album, as the sound was bad due to technical limitations and the wide open space, so the band, on 25 October of the same year, played a concert in Đuro Janković Hall in Sarajevo, the recording of which was used for the live album Koncert kod Hajdučke česme (The Concert at Hajdučka česma). Eventually, the only part of the Hajdučka česma concert that ended up on the album were the recordings of the audience's reactions.\n\nAfter Koncert kod Hajdučke česme was mixed, Bregović went to serve the army in Niš and the band went on hiatus; Melody Maker wrote about Bijelo Dugme's hiatus as about an event \"on the verge of national tragedy\". Redžić continued to work on the Koncert kod hajdučke česme recordings, and a live version of \"Dede, bona, sjeti se, de tako ti svega\" was later used as a B-side for the single \"Bitanga i princeza\" (\"The Brute and the Princess\"), released in 1979. In June 1978, Bebek released his first solo album, the symphonic rock-oriented Skoro da smo isti (We're almost the Same), which saw mostly negative reactions by the critics. During the same year, Ristovski and Ivandić recorded the album Stižemo (Here We Come). The album, featuring lyrics by Ranko Boban, was recorded in London with Leb i Sol leader Vlatko Stefanovski on guitar, Zlatko Hold on bass guitar, and Goran Kovačević and Ivandić's sister Gordana on vocals. Ristovski and Ivandić met with Bregović during his leave and played him the recordings, believing they could persuade him to let them compose for Bijelo Dugme. After he refused, the two, encouraged by the positive reactions of the music critics which had the opportunity to listen to the material before the release, decided to leave Bijelo Dugme. However, on 10 September, the same day for which the beginning of the promotional tour was scheduled, Ivandić, alongside Goran Kovačević and Ranko Boban, was arrested for owning hashish. Ivandić was sentenced to spend three years in jail (Kovačević was sentenced to year and a half, and Boban to a year). Before he went to serve the sentence, Ivandić went to psychiatric sessions to prepare for the life in prison. The psychiatrist he went to see was Radovan Karadžić.\n\nIn June 1978, Bregović went to Sarajevo to receive a plaque from the League of Communist Youth of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the behalf of the band. In the autumn of 1978, Pravdić returned to the band and drummer Dragan \"Điđi\" Jankelić, who participated in the recording of Bebek's solo album, became Bijelo Dugme's new drummer. Jankelić was previously a member of Formula 4 (the lineup in which he played included both Ljubiša Racić and Jadranko Stanković), Rok, Čisti Zrak and Rezonansa. Bijelo Dugme started preparing their new album in Niška Banja‚ but, as Bregović was still serving the army, they definitely reunited in Sarajevo on 1 November. The new lineup of the band had their first performance in Skenderija on 4 December 1978.\n\nThe band's fourth studio album was recorded in Belgrade and produced by Neil Harrison. Several songs featured a symphonic orchestra. The making of the album was followed by censorship. The original cover, designed by Dragan S. Stefanović and featuring female leg kicking male's genital area, was refused by Jugoton as \"vulgar\"; instead, the album ended up featuring a cover designed by Jugoton's designer Ivan Ivezić. The verse \"Koji mi je moj\" (\"What the fuck is wrong with me\") was excluded from the song \"Ala je glupo zaboravit njen broj\" (\"It's so Stupid to Forget Her Number\"), and the verse \"A Hrist je bio kopile i jad\" (\"And Christ was bastard and misery\") from the song \"Sve će to, mila moja, prekriti ruzmarin, snjegovi i šaš\" (\"All of That, My Dear, Will Be Covered by Rosemary, Snow and Reed\") was replaced with \"A on je bio kopile i jad\" (\"And he was bastard and misery\"). The album Bitanga i princeza (The Brute and the Princess) was released in March 1979 and praised by the critics as Bijelo Dugme's finest work until then. The album did not feature folk music elements, and brought songs \"Bitanga i princeza\", \"Ala je glupo zaboravit njen broj\", \"Na zadnjem sjedištu mog auta\" (\"On the Back Seat of My Car\"), \"A koliko si ih imala do sad\" (\"How Many Have There Been?\"), and emotional ballads \"Ipak poželim neko pismo\" (\"Still, I Wish for a Letter\"), \"Kad zaboraviš juli\" (\"Once You Forget July\") and \"Sve će to, mila moja, prekriti ruzmarin, snjegovi i šaš\", all becoming hits. The album broke all the records held by their previous releases. Twelve days before the start of the promotional tour, Pravdić had a car accident in which he broke his clavicle, so he performed on the initial several concerts using only one hand. The tour, however, was highly successful. The band managed to sell out Pionir Hall five times, dedicating all the money earned from these concerts (about 100,000 American dollars) to the victims of the 1979 Montenegro earthquake. On some of the concerts they were accompanied by Branko Krsmanović Choir and a symphonic orchestra. On 22 September, the band organized a concert under the name Rock spektakl '79. (Rock Spectacle 79) on Bellgrade's JNA Stadium, with themselves as the headliners. The concert featured numerous opening acts: Crni Petak, Kilo i Po, Rok Apoteka, Galija, Kako, Mama Rock, Formula 4, Peta Rijeka, Čisti Zrak, Aerodrom, Opus, Senad od Bosne, Boomerang, Prva Ljubav, Revolver, Prljavo Kazalište, Tomaž Domicelj, Metak, Obećanje Proljeća, Suncokret, Parni Valjak, Generacija 5 and Siluete. More than 70,000 people attended the concert."
