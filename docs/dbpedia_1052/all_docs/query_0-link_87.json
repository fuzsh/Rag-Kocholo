        "text": "Music star and band member Dario G. Paul Spencer, died of cancer at the age of 53, reports \"Sky News\".\n\nSpencer was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer last year and has since been regularly updating followers on his health.\n\n\"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Paul Spencer today. He was positive until the very end, but this was a battle he could no longer fight. He leaves behind a wonderful musical legacy and many happy memories for many people. He will be missed by all who loved him. Shine on, our big star,\" his family wrote on social media.\n\nPaul was a member of the group \"Dario G\" with DJs Scott Rosser and Stephen Spencer, but recently used the stage name Dario G for his solo performances. The group became famous in 1997 with the hit \"Sunchyme\", and a year later they released a World Cup song called \"Carnaval De Paris\". Scott and Stephen then left the group, and Paul continued to perform under the same name.\n\nMany friends and fellow musicians said goodbye to Paul, including the famous DJ Sigala."
