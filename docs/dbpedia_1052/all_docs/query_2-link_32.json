        "text": "Aleksandar Vučić is uncompromising in the fight for a better Serbia, he is the only serious politician today, and this is shown by his diplomatic authority abroad, says actor, producer and director Lazar Ristovski.\n\nIn an interview for \"Kurir\", Ristovski assesses that \"everyone has the right to choose a policy and a person they believe in\" and adds that \"this is true democracy and tolerance\".\n\n\"But since they chose those so-called pro-democratic candidates, although I look at their choice with understanding, I hope that they will also look at my choice with understanding. And this time it is Aleksandar Vučić,\" said Ristovski.\n\nHe claims that he will \"unequivocally and with pleasure vote for him\".\n\n\"What distinguishes him is his uncompromisingness in the fight for a better Serbia. He proved that by not letting Tom run for president. Therefore, he has no emotions when it comes to the fate of the country,\" Ristovski assesses.\n\nWhen asked why he will vote for Vučić, he states that it is because \"first of all, he was disappointed in the so-called democrats a long time ago\".\n\n\"They had a historic chance, which they squandered. Along the way, they stole and privatized half of the country for their own benefit, and forgot their loyal voters. Now only the naive can vote for those options. I'm not that,\" says Ristovski.\n\nHe adds that \"this time he listens to his reason\".\n\n\"And he tells me the following: how can I believe that Mr. Janković, as he says, will bring a smile back to the face of Serbia, when I have never seen him smile, how can I trust Jeremic, who is only traveling through Serbia and, as soon as If he loses on April 2, he will disappear somewhere in white world institutions that are well paid,\" Ristovski believes.\n\nHe says that this is why his decision in this regard is \"clear and unambiguous\".\n\nVučić: On the verge of victory and defeat\n\nHe announced that he would support Vučić in his speech at the final rally on March 24 in the Arena.\n\n\"Aleksandar Vučić has the strength and willingness to sacrifice himself for a better Serbia. He shows it with his work. I appreciate it. I love the energy he emits. He is a fighter, unlike others, who are stubborn,\" said Ristovski.\n\nHe believes that \"today's politicians are on the stage too short to evaluate their historical role\".\n\n\"The only serious politician today is Aleksandar Vučić. He shows this with his diplomatic authority abroad. Time will tell what his role will be in the historical sense,\" said Ristovski.\n\nTo the journalist's statement that many people will \"take his support for Vučić as a message that he wants the position of Minister of Culture\", he responded with a laugh.\n\n\"Many actors were ministers of culture. I have no such ambitions,\" said Ristovski."
