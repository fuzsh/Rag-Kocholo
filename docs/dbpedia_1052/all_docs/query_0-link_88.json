        "text": "In ''Pretty Village, Pretty Flame,'' the Belgrade-trained filmmaker Srdjan Dragojevic unleashes a powerful assault on the insanity of the war that pitted Serb against Muslim in Bosnia.\n\nHis film, opening today at Anthology Film Archives, flashes back and forth, from the days of Yugoslav unity under Marshal Tito, to 1999, when a tunnel that symbolized national brotherhood and enlightenment at its dedication in 1971 is rededicated as a symbol of peace. On both occasions, the official wielding the shears at the ribbon-cutting bloodies his thumb. Mr. Dragojevic leaves no doubt about his vision of the future: poisoned by unrelenting hatred between Muslim and Serb, it is bleak and seethes with the potential for another war.\n\nBetween ceremonies, the abandoned tunnel becomes the wartime refuge of a detachment of Serbian troops, separated from their main force and under siege by Muslims. Cutting between the tunnel during the war and a hospital where the survivors of the detachment lay gravely wounded in 1994, ''Pretty Village, Pretty Flame'' uses the flashbacks to sketch the friendship of Milan (Dragan Bjelogrlic) and Halil (Nikola Pejakovic), a Serb and a Muslim who grow up in peacetime as best friends in a small village and become partners in an auto repair shop. Even in their childhood fights, the film makes clear, neither would surrender. War positions Milan inside and Halil outside the tunnel.\n\nIn the hospital, Milan, whose mother has died at the hands of Muslims and who has witnessed all manner of arson, looting and murder, becomes fixated with a thirst for vengeance against a Muslim prisoner of war visible through a glass wall.\n\nBut the bulk of ''Pretty Village, Pretty Flame'' unfolds inside the tunnel among the troops led by a Communist captain fond of recalling the good old days under Tito. Among the more vivid members of the beleaguered detachment facing intermittent Muslim assaults and psychological taunts are a thief, a drug addict and a professor. They are joined by a young American television journalist carrying a Muslim visa, a video camera and an air of disengagement that seems not so much a manifestation of journalistic integrity as a symbol of the unwillingness of the United States to intervene to halt the slaughter.\n\nAt more than two hours, Mr. Dragojevic's film repeatedly pounds home its condemnation of war and ethnic hatreds, and some of its characters could be more sharply delineated. But ''Pretty Village, Pretty Flame'' remains a clear, well-meaning, universal appeal to reason.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
