        "text": "Always under control\n\nTrying to remember how to feel\n\nJust to insist that you really exist\n\nBut it′s the nearness that kills\n\nWishing the world away\n\nOn those crash diet suburban incentives\n\nInnocence is no excuse\n\nFor all those self inflicted differences\n\nEverybody, everybody\n\nEverybody make yourself a target\n\nJust...\n\nStay out of it\n\nStay out of it\n\nStay out of it\n\nStay... out of it, out of it, out of it\n\nSo just like everyone\n\nYou found that brick wall building up inside\n\nThat we keep knocking down\n\nFrom degeneration to degeneration\n\nStuck inside your thoughts\n\nScared of dependence clinging to security\n\nJust go on from day to day\n\nIt takes a lot more than you got to give\n\nEverybody, everybody\n\nEverybody make yourself a target\n\nJust...\n\nStay out of it\n\nStay out of it\n\nStay out of it\n\nStay... out of it, out of it, out of it\n\nYour so happy and I'm not surprised\n\nCoz everyone′s living in disguise\n\nWe watch the time go by and dream\n\nWe never feel guilty for anything\n\nStay out of it\n\nStay out of it\n\nStay out of it\n\nStay... out of it, out of it, out of it\n\nWriter(s): Richard Warwick, Ricky Warwick<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
