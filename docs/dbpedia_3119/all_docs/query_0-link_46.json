Originally only available as a 2-CD set including a Radio 1 John Peel session, only a handful of copies made their way over to the UK on import. Bustin + Dronin has never been available on vinyl before now, and this release features the nine remixes (note: no Peel Session) by William Orbit (tracks 1, 6, 7 & 9), Adrian Sherwood (2 & 8), Moby (4), Thurston Moore (5) and John McEntire (7). Released on two x heavyweight coloured vinyl LPs - 1 x transparent blue, 1 x transparent green, the sleeve comes with an adapted version of the original Japanese OBI strip and replica insert.\n\nDave Brubeck Trio - Live from Vienna 1967 is an extremely rare, red-hot performance by Dave and his famous rhythm section -- Joe Morello, on drums, and Gene Wright on bass. Alto saxophonist, Paul Desmond, missed the plane to Vienna and the remaining trio took the stage with a mission; show the packed hall that the three of them could play up a storm despite being one man down. Each musician in the trio was at the top of their game and each player was forced to stretch out their solos which landed them in new creative territories. The communication of musical concepts between Dave and Joe is extraordinary as they improvise boldly and respond to each other's fresh ideas. Gene Wright solos far more than usual on this album and his playing is a fitting tribute to the longest living member of the Quartet. (Gene died on December 30th, 2020.) Dave Brubeck plays masterfully revealing a rhythmic complexity to his approach on the piano that is remarkable and reminds the listener of his extremely inventive approach to jazz improvisations. Harmonically, he also explores polytonality in the most unexpected places; for example, on the ballad \"La Paloma Azul.\" On \"Swanee River\" Dave is playfully polyrhythmic. Dave's light touch on \"One Moment Worth Years\" is charming and gives a nod to the great more traditional pianists who went before him. On this great-sounding recording, you can hear the full breadth of Dave's playing which pushes jazz forward while honoring his past influences. Opening with \"St. Louis Blues,\" the set includes the rhythmically challenging, high-spirited \"Someday My Prince Will Come,\" and ends with \"Take the A Train\" as an encore. This is a thrilling set! The sound is wonderful and listening to this album will make you feel as if you were sitting in the audience that historic night.\n\nSide A\n\n1. St. Louis Blues\n\n2. One Moment Worth Years\n\nSide B\n\n1. Swanee River\n\n2. La Paloma Azul\n\n3. Someday My Prince Will Come\n\n4.

After releasing their 1995 debut, Do You Feel at Home?, the Omaha indie rockers caught the attention of Wind-up Records, who backed the groups sophomore album, The Uneventful Vacation. While The Uneventful Vacation marked the musicians final record together, before they each embarked on their next ventures, this formative album has since become a cult favorite in the 90s emo canon. This 25th Anniversary Edition is pressed on Red & Black Smoke vinyl with all-analog mastering from the original tapes by Kevin Gray at Cohearent Audio. It also includes the bonus track, Congratulations! which appeared on the original vinyl release.\n\nSide A:\n\n1. Jean's T.V.\n\n2. Refused By Light\n\n3. We'll Always Have Paris\n\n4.

That accounts for a little under half of this 15-track collection. The rest is made up of selections from the 2000 live album Rock Bottom: Live at the Bottom Line (four tracks) and 2002's studio album Bug (two cuts), plus a couple of relative rarities -- \"When the Wind Blows (Emergency),\" which was written for the End Hunger Network in 1997, and a cover of George Harrison's \"Give Me Love, Give Me Peace on Earth,\" which was for a 2003 Harrison tribute album -- and a brand new tune, \"God in My Brain,\" which was written and recorded in 2006, after Davies recovered from a serious stroke.\n\n1.

Recorded just months before her untimely death in 1978, this special release attempts to present the record that Sandy might have released had she lived. The concert features a career-spanning set that includes songs taken from her band Fotheringay, Sandys solo albums (The North Star Grassman and the Ravens, Sandy, and Rendezvous), as well as her work with Fairport Convention on the albums Unhalfbricking and Rising for the Moon. This final performance perfectly captures the folk-rock sound with a stellar group of musicians including Trevor Lucas, Jerry Donahue, Pat Donaldson, Dave Mattacks, among others. It showcases the quality of Sandys songwriting throughout her career and includes her signature composition, Who Knows Where the Time Goes?  which was the first song she ever wrote  and No More Sad Refrains which closed her final album. Remastered from the restored tapes, this release features Sandys spoken introductions to each song, comprehensive sleeve notes, and brand-new artwork designed specifically for this release.\n\nSide A:\n\n1.

The band signed to Led Zeppelin's Swan Song label and released their self-titled debut album a year later. The album is being remastered from original analog tapes for its first vinyl pressing since 1977. Limited to 3,000 units worldwide and pressed on color vinyl, the record will be available exclusively for Record Store Day 2022.

This very rare and sought-after 1968 album from the legendary British singer/songwriter was only released in the U.S. and over the years its reputation among collectors has only grown. Although it never came out in England, Decca Records kept the masters to the intended U.K. pressing which is now being released on vinyl. It contains two previously unreleased, self-penned tracks  the blue-eyed soul bop Goin Round in Circles and the orchestral Come to My Arms which could almost have been a Bond theme.\n\nSide A:\n\n1. You Just Gotta Know My Mind\n\n2. Tears In My Eyes\n\n3. Life Is Short\n\n4. Souvenirs Of Stefan\n\n5. Can't You See I'm Dreaming\n\n6. Goin' Round In Circles\n\n7.

Born from a radio edit for a DJ set in 2015, the title was an immediate and dazzling success, with more than 60M streams. The music video was released a year later, showing a game of tennis on a sunny day and reached 10M views in 2021. This release follows their second album Tako Tsubo in March 2021 and arrives at a perfect time : the band's first appearance at Coachella Festival and their second full US tour.\n\nA.
