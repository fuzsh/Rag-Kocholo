        "text": "From the heart-wrenching strains of mellow indie and alt rock to the raw, soul-baring grit of grunge to the introspective melancholy of emo, both melodic and fierce, this week’s roundup is another rich kaleidoscope of guitar driven offerings that you should look into.\n\nLA DISPUTE surprises fans with their latest single, “Sixteen,” offering a poignant blend of spoken word, experimental, emo, post hardcore and indie elements.\n\nThe track reflects on life’s journey and the choices made along the way, weaving introspective lyrics with raw emotion. As anticipation builds for their upcoming full release, “Here, Hear IV,” scheduled for March 12, 2024, “Sixteen” provides a captivating glimpse into the band’s evolving sound and narrative depth. Yup, that’s LA DISPUTE.\n\nEVERYTHING EVERYTHING’s seventh studio album, “Mountainhead,” hits the shelves today, March 1st, 2024, delivering the quintessential blend of idiosyncratic northern art-rock expected from the band.\n\nHowever, clocking in a tad too long, the album boasts a clever and obtuse narrative, offering sonic diversity and thickness that cater to both casual listeners and diehard fans. The album’s opener, ‘Wild Guess,’ sets the tone with its pitch-shifted harmonies and scuzzy guitar lines, hinting at a world of manufactured disorder before diving into its allegorical narrative.\n\n“Mountainhead” solidifies Everything Everything’s reputation as masters of intellectual rock, inviting listeners to delve into its depths and uncover its hidden treasures.\n\nSTAY INSIDE’s latest album “Ferried Away” delves deep into the realm of relationships and emotional bonds, with each track serving as a heartfelt homage to significant individuals in the band members’ lives.\n\nBlending elements of alternative rock, post-hardcore, and emo, the album crafts a poignant soundscape that resonates with intensity and raw emotion, offering listeners a sonic journey through personal connections and memories.\n\nFerried Away by Stay Inside\n\nMontreal’s own GULFER share new album “Third Wind,” available everywhere as of February 28 via Topshelf Records.\n\nThis fourth album from the band marks a significant evolution in their sound, infusing their established mathy emo core with fresh shoegaze and indie rock elements.\n\nThe band, which has been a fixture in the music world for over a decade, showcases a renewed vigor and artistic depth in “Third Wind,” reflecting their diverse influences and collaborative spirit.

As they continue to push boundaries and explore new sonic territories, GULFER reaffirms their position as innovative and resilient artists, ready to take listeners on a memorable auditory journey with “Third Wind.”\n\nGHOST WORK, featuring members from Seaweed, Snapcase, Milemarker, and Minus The Bear, releases “Erase the Morning” off their upcoming album “Light a Candle for the Lonely.”\n\nThis single combines emotional lyrics with the essence of 90s alternative and post-hardcore influences.\n\nBassist Dustin Perry and vocalist Aaron Stauffer provide deep insights into personal and existential themes, highlighting the song’s exploration of life’s impermanence and individual struggles.\n\nWe premiered this song earlier this week, so be sure to go HERE and learn a wider context.\n\nBassist Dustin Perry says, “Erase the Morning” is one of the few things I’ve written that I can detach and enjoy as a song. I think it’s really beautiful, and I’m not one to love myself.”\n\nVocalist Aaron Stauffer adds, “The song lyrics are about how difficult it is to change the way people live; and as a result how many find themselves isolated and alone. To me, the positive part is that all life is completely impermanent, thus all of the light will fade. So the hard time that someone might be having in this moment is really just a blink of an eye.”\n\nSOFT KILL is back with a vengeance, streaming their latest track “Come Hang From The Roof Tops” from the upcoming album “Escape Forever.”\n\nDue to hit the airwaves on April 12, 2024, this album is a journey through time and space, weaving together elements of nostalgia and present-day chaos.\n\n“Escape Forever” serves as a poignant reminder of our teenage dreams while confronting the harsh realities of today’s world.
