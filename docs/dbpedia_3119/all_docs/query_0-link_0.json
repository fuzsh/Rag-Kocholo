US releases events should be filled under the US label instead.\n\nNote that there exists a number of specialized Sanctuary subsidiaries under which releases should be properly filled.\n\nThis label should (theorically) be used only for UK/European \"Sanctuary\" releases.\n\nCreated in 2000 with the ambition to reproduce the success of Sanctuary Records (Group) in Europe on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nFollowing severe loss for the holding, this US offshoot will stop releasing new records in 2007.\n\nUS releases by \"Sanctuary\" should be filled here.\n\nNote, though, that there exists a number of specialized Sanctuary sublabels as well (Sanctuary Classics, Sanctuary Midline comes to mind), and that they should be filled properly under these entries."
