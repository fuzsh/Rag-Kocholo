        "text": "I ran into a situation this weekend allowing me to make a few comparative sq comments, so I will. I have to say however that in the end, it seems impossibly hard at times to think you can pick one of these average compilation hoping that it will always be 100% heads above another compilation across the board; i.e., there is such a wide range of recording issues across the years that one mastering style will tend to have certain songs that are home runs while others that are misses— and that seems the same for the next compilation you try. I have zero plans to go pick the best version of every one of these cuts, as I don’t want to lose my mind, but I think that is how you would have to do it, and have some editing tools to adjust levels etc. There are some good threads around here where that was done if interested though. Also I can certainly see where one would respond to a different mastering style for these and be just as right as someone not liking that style.\n\nWith that said, here is what happened. Friday I went bin diving to see if I could find any of the comps that were summarized in the posts just above— seemingly the simplest way to get the core cuts, avoid lots of dubs and just move on. Well what did I find, a very cheap Complete BM&W Pt. II, so a small piece of the first JAD set. I always wanted to know how those stacked up to the later JAD/Universal sets of which I have Fy-Ah Fy-Ah. Those two don’t overlap cuts wise; but I also had the ’02 Sanctuary/Trojan Soul Rebels, a Purple Pyramid Upsetter set and Songs Of Freedom.\n\nSo I repeat my first paragraph here, don’t bother reading on unless you are chasing small sq differences; and I would also now add the early JAD sets don’t seem like anywhere close to the best way to collect this stuff given that everything is spread over so many discs and there are oodles of dub cuts; the compilations recommended just above seem tons easier to deal with, but here goes anyway.\n\nI found the early JAD set to be different than the JAD/U set in mastering. Not a huge difference, and I can see that at the time of JAD/U release, and say the deep analysis done on the pdf referenced earlier, the new set seemed like an improvement. The thing to me is, the early JAD comes across more as a flat transfer, the JAD/U used a little more eq and compression to make the songs pop and have an enjoyable brighter-ness, and that set really plays where you don’t hear as many dramatic recording differences song to song, they are airier up top and thicker on the bottom and just play very well at delivering the song first for the listener. The early JAD has a darker quality, much more variety of recording style song to song shows up and at times those differences are jarring. To me, the JAD gives you what the Diaments do vs. the remasters of those albums, a spookier quality, seemingly to me more how they were recorded; the recording style and built-in quirks are highlighted just as much as the songs themselves. On the early JAD there are some songs that are really tough on first take, screechy, thin; but like my experience with Songs Of Freedom, if you adjust yourself to a pure mono listen, get in your head that these things are going deliver what they are and not much else, it grows on you pretty fast where I think early JAD is the more faithful representation. Songs Of Freedom is the best middle ground, I feel those cuts are the best sounding. By comparison now the Trojan Soul Rebels feels well eq’d and especially far too boomy; Purple Pyramid also compressed more than the others.\n\nSo I am really liking these JAD cuts, I wish I had the same cuts for JAD/U to do more direct comparisons, I can easily see JAD/U making most anyone happy; the differences between these two are not huge—and again what style do you like, just present the songs where I don’t get distracted to much from the song (ok it takes a little compression and eq to do that I can live with it); or b) give it to me the flattest way possible, with all the quirks, hits, misses and recording spookiness and I will sort out all the variety in my head because the overall listening experience needs to be more all over the map to do this.\n\nSomeone on another thread seemed to imply that the early JAD set used noise reduction; they may be a bigger expert on these matters, but as much as I have heard NR used on other things, I don’t think it is the case with JAD. It is darker, and a more boxed in sound sure, so I can see someone saying NR is doing that; but I am instead going to go with my analysis of Songs Of Freedom and say that it is perhaps good source tapes, flatter mastering and a more solid mono image giving you less of a toppy hissy-ness a darker deader sound on first listen, easily confused for NR; where that sound then bubbles up and comes out and grabs you like a Diament does for me anyway rather than square on like the remasters. I am wildly speculating now, and I am really more just saying that I get a sense of the possibility of this happening based on my understanding of the concept, not in any way that this is what in fact happened; but at times if feels like, or I would not be surprised if someone said, the early JAD and Songs Of Freedom used mono tape heads in mastering, and stereo tape heads were used for JAD/U or say Trojan stuff; just a more solid image in one vs. a still good mono image in the other but more bits flying around left and right.\n\nSo in the end if you have either one of these I am not so sure this amount of consternation is worth reconsidering anything, but as I embarked on this latest journey into the back catalog trying to get as good a sounding compilation of the early cuts as the Diament masterings; and so those were my findings. Right now I absolutely love the Songs Of Freedom cuts, and these early JAD cuts are a very Diament-like experience on my Pono based office system. I still plan on trying the Trojan compilation for the Perry cuts, I am going to ask a question on a separate post to make sure I am not missing any JAD v. Trojan source tape issues, but this is where I am currently coming out: on Songs Of Freedom and this early JAD set I am feeling all of the spookiness and fun of these early recordings where for the many years with JAD/U and other compilations I was tending to get the songs period more than the recording experience… again not huge differences, so most any way seems about right if you just want the songs and can eliminate the notion that these things can ever be anywhere close to audiophile, short of breaking the bank and buying Steve’s compilation if you are unlucky like me and don’t already own it. Thanks for reading if for some reason you still are; it has been a lot of fun playing around with these this week, I love this music as much as the Island years and on that opinion I have no doubt.\n\nThank you! Your expertise not only led me to some great purchases but saved me heaps of money chasing down sets with decent sound quality. Much appreciated!"
