        "text": "POWERMAN 5000 vocalist/mainman Spider One has confirmed that the group's previously announced headlining tour (which was also set to include SALIVA, MACHINE HEAD, STEREOMUD and HALFCOCKED) has been cancelled and that the release date of their Anyone For Doomsday? CD has been pushed back to early 2002, but has rejected any implication that the cancellation was a result of the negative early reactions to the group's latest studio effort. According to the vocalist, the band's decision to return to the studio and lay down more material (which will be included on the final version of the aforementioned album) “has nothing to do with the reaction to the album (which was quite positive),nor did it involve anything to do with the tour. In short, it was 100% a band decision and purely artistic.” An official statement is expected to be issued shortly clarifying the reasons for the cancellation and the decision to record more material.\n\nFollowing their successful appearance at this past weekend's Thrash Of The Titans benefit concert for TESTAMENT vocalist Chuck Billy (where they were, by all accounts, one of the event's highlights),the reunited DEATH ANGEL are planning on putting on a headlining performance at either the Fillmore or the Warfield in early October as a way to give their hometown fans a chance to see the group perform a full show one last time. According to vocalist Mark Osegueda, a a full-blown reunion for the band is out of the question, with the singer intent on rejoining drummer Andy Galeon and guitarist Rob Cavestany in their most recent project SWARM once the above-mentioned gig has been completed. More information as it becomes available.\n\nAccording to BLIND GUARDIAN vocalist Hansi Kursch, the first single from the group's long-awaited new studio album will be issued through Virgin Records in November, and it will contain an as-yet-untitled 14-minute-long track (whose working title is “Misty Tales And Poems Lost”) and the non-album cut “Harvest of Sorrow” as a bonus. “The long song lyrically is based on the Trojan War and introduces Cassandra's various visions of death and defeat,” stated Kursch. “It not so much deals with the splatter aspects of the Iliad, but more with the tragic aspects pointed out in there and later on by more modern authors such as Schiller, Zimmer Bradley, or Christa Wolf. The music, as the lyrics, are mind tripping.” BLIND GUARDIAN are preparing to begin the mixing process for the single, which is expected to take up to three weeks, after which they will focus their attention on the upcoming full-length album, which is not due to be released before February 2002.\n\nCANNIBAL CORPSE drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz has completed his tracks for the group's upcoming, as-yet-untitled full-length CD, which is currently being recorded at El Paso's Sonic Ranch Studios (formerly Village Recorders) with producer Neil Kernon (i.e. QUEENSRYCHE, NEVERMORE) for an early 2002 release through Metal Blade Records.\n\nDue to the “amazing ticket sales” for ARCH ENEMY's upcoming Japanese Asian Sins 2001 headlining tour, an additional Tokyo show has been added to the band's itinerary on September 2nd. Guitarist Michael Amott commented 'It's a smaller venue (Astro Hall 400 capacity),which means we will not be able to have the big show that we are doing at the Akasaka Blitz (2,000 capacity). So we are going to make it a little bit special musically — there will be some surprises in the set... It's going to be a blast, I love the small places anyway...everybody gets hot and sweaty and looks like sh.t, hehe..'\n\n...\n\nHere is ARCH ENEMY's upcoming gig schedule, as it currently stands:\n\n...\n\nAug. 16 – London, UK @ Underworld\n\nAug. 23 – Seoul, Korea @ Metal Fest 2001\n\nAug. 25-26 – Yokohama, JAP @ Beast Feast Festival\n\nAug. – Tokyo, JAP @ Akasaka Blitz\n\nAug. 30 – Nagoya, JAP @ Bottom Line\n\nAug. 31 – Osaka, JAP @ On Air West Osaka\n\nSept. 02 – Tokyo, JAP @ Astro Hall\n\nICED EARTH mainman/guitarist Jon Schaffer has issued a statement to the group's European fans regarding ICED EARTH's decision to cancel the previously announced European tour in favor of a support slot on the upcoming JUDAS PRIEST North American trek, which is scheduled to be begin in mid-September. Here is Schaffer's statement in its entirety:\n\n...\n\n“Hello friends, as you may have heard, I was faced with a hard decision recently concerning our touring plans. As most of you know ICED EARTH has continued to fight for the advancement of metal music since the inception of the band some 17 years ago. I know my decision has disappointed a lot of our European fans.\n\n...\n\n“However, the future of ICED EARTH may very well depend on a tour such as the tour with PRIEST. What I mean by this is that we have struggled for the last 11 years since we've been signed to get a tour like this in the U.S. This could very well be a new day in the band's history and a long-overdue break that we have needed. If the doors finally start opening here in the States it will have a strong effect everywhere else in the world. This could be the beginning of something very special.\n\n...\n\n“So, for those of you in Europe who are upset, please try to understand that we have to take this opportunity for the future of the band. I promise we will reschedule the tour as soon as possible and bring to you the best ICED EARTH show you have ever seen, you have my word on it!!!!! Take care and best to all... Jon Schaffer”\n\nContrary to recent online rumors, FOO FIGHTERS frontman and former NIRVANA skinsman Dave Grohl WILL, in fact, be playing drums on three songs for the upcoming QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE album Songs For The Deaf, which is currently being recorded with producer Eric Valentine (SNAKE RIVER CONSPIRACY, SMASH MOUTH). The album, which is scheduled for a late 2001 / early 2002 release through Interscope Records, will be the group's first with longtime band collaborator and former SCREAMING TREES frontman Mark Lanegan in the role of the group's official vocalist.\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\n\n...\n\nQUEENSRŸCHE SIGNS WITH SANCTUARY RECORDS LIVE EVOLUTION, CD AND DVD, SCHEDULED FOR FALL 2001 RELEASE\n\n...\n\nSanctuary Records Group is proud to announce the signing of America's premiere progressive hard rock band QUEENSRŸCHE to a long-term worldwide deal.\n\n...\n\nThe Grammy-Nominated quintet have sold over 20,000,000 albums worldwide with a career spanning eight albums, including the bonafide classics Operation Mindcrime, Empire, and Promised Land.\n\n...\n\nSanctuary Group Chief Executive Officer Merck Mercuriadis commented, 'When we started the label a year ago, the top two artists on our wish list were MEGADETH and QUEENSRŸCHE. Following on from our Top 15 success with MEGADETH, we are very pleased that QUEENSRŸCHE are now part of the Sanctuary family. They are one of the world's premiere progressive hard rock bands and we look forward to creating a positive and fertile environment for them.”\n\n...\n\nQUEENSRŸCHE vocalist Geoff Tate commented, 'Signing with Sanctuary has been a wonderfully different experience for us. Sanctuary shares QUEENSRŸCHE's vision for the future of the band and they have worked with us much more closely than any other label. They are committed to the long run and the music and the new ideas they bring to the table give all in the band a feeling of excitement.'\n\n...\n\nOne of the great forgotten art forms of the rock era is the classic gatefold sleeve career-defining double/triple live album. From Yessongs to Frampton Comes Alive to AEROSMITH's Live Bootleg, the art form took those artists to another level. Following in that spirit QUEENSRŸCHE's first release on Sanctuary Records will be a career-spanning double live CD on September 25, 2001 that will include over 100 minutes of classic music and packaging.\n\n...\n\nA live DVD, QUEENSRŸCHE's first, will follow on October 9, 2001. Special features planned for the DVD include exclusive animation, bonus tracks and much more. The package will also be made available on VHS.\n\n...\n\nGeoff said of the recording, 'Doing a live album and DVD now was just the right experience for us. We have all recently been working on outside projects and we had this feeling of wanting to bring the band together to record live the material covering our 20 years of writing music together before we start our next studio album. We have been wanting to really devote all our energy to what we expect to be the most intense QUEENSRŸCHE studio album since ...Mindcrime and we needed to restart the creative connection between us. The shows and preparation for the live album were just what we needed to start our new relationship with Sanctuary as well as bring us all back to the 'RŸCHE state of mind.'\n\n...\n\nGeoff, guitarists Michael Wilton and Kelly Gray, bassist Eddie Jackson, and drummer Scott Rockenfield recorded two special shows on July 27th and 28th, 2001 at Seattle's Moore Theater. This was a huge treat for both the hometown fans in attendance and the many people who traveled from as far as Germany for this special event.\n\n...\n\nQUEENSRŸCHE has earned a rightful place alongside PINK FLOYD, IRON MAIDEN and RUSH in the pantheon of the world's greatest progressive hard rock bands and the forthcoming live CD and DVD will be significant additions to its legacy.\n\n...\n\nThese are the tracks that are tentatively set to appear on the Live Evolution double CD:\n\n...\n\n01. NM156\n\n02. Walk In The Shadows\n\n03. Roads To Madness\n\n04. The Lady Wore Black\n\n05. London\n\n06. Screaming In Digital\n\n07. Take Hold Of The Flame\n\n08. Queen Of The Ryche\n\n09.

Sacred Ground\n\n27. Breakdown\n\n28. Falling Down\n\n29. Right Side Of My Mind\n\n30. Hit The Black\n\n...\n\nThe album was recorded at the Moore Theater in Seattle on July 27-28 and is being produced by James “Jimbo” Barton, who is also said to be producing a live recording of Geoff Tate's solo project.\n\nLive recordings of new, previously unreleased VOIVOD tracks, entitled “Confrontation” and “Day By Day”, can be downloaded from here and here. Both cuts were recorded during one of the group's last-ever shows with bassist/vocalist Eric Forrest in Toronto, Canada in October 2000.\n\nTenatively scheduled to appear at Century Media Records' 10-Year-Anniversary bash at West Hollywood's Roxy Theatre on Friday, September 28th are STRAPPING YOUNG LAD, STUCK MOJO (including frontman Bonz, currently in 420 MONKS),SKINLAB, NEVERMORE and several others.

The group has already completed some recordings and are scheduled to make their live debut at the Hole in the Sky — Bergen Metal Fest in Norway on August 31st.\n\nThe reissue of ANGEL DUST much sought-after debut, Into The Dark Past, has been put into question following the discovery of a slew of bootleg copies that have been making the rounds during the recent weeks, including at this year's Wacken Festival, where they were being sold for “a lot of money”.\n\nAXEL RUDI PELL's “personal assistant” Monique van Maren has issued a statement regarding the numerous technical problems that the guitarist encountered during his band's recent appearance at the Rock Machina Festival in Spain, thereby forcing the group to cut their appearance short. Here is the statement in its entirety: 'We have to apologize for the technical problems during our show at the Rock Machina Festival in Spain. It was beyond our control that the rented guitar amplifiers quit their work during the first song, followed by several voltage problems, as a few times the complete power on Axel's side of the stage went off. Axel and the band are really feeling sorry for that weird circumstances, as they would have loved to play a 'complete' set for their Spanish fans, who are really enthusiastic. A big thank you to those people, who'd been at the festival, for their patience and understanding. We will be back! Monique van Maren (Personal Assistant To Axel Rudi Pell)”\n\nThe previously announced MSG (MICHAEL SCHENKER GROUP) Japanese live dates, which were set to take place in December, have been “temporarily retracted” from singer Chris Logan's official web site.

There will be quite a few new songs, and some MASTERS material done in a more intimate style. I've been anxious to do a show like this with my favorite musical friends for years.'\n\n...\n\nThe Knitting Factory notes, 'West coast fans should get their tickets as soon as possible. Response since the announcement has been tremendous and Chris' schedule is only allowing him to perform one night.'\n\nReunited NWOBHM legends HOLOCAUST are due to lay down the drum tracks for their forthcoming CD, entitled Primal, at Azure Studios between August 17th and August 25th.
