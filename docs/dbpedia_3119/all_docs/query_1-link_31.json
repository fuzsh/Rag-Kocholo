        "text": "10 years into the band, Pakistani prog-rock act The D/A Method are calling it quits in immense style. The band has just released their third and final album with an awesome music video streaming further below.\n\nFrom the band members themselves, this is what they had to say:\n\n“‘Sanctuary’, the third and final full-length album from The D/A Method is out now! It is an album we are all immensely proud of. This record completes the trilogy we started with ‘The Great Disillusion’ and continued with ‘The Desert Road’ and marks both the 10 year anniversary of the band and its logical conclusion.\n\nMaking these albums has truly been both the most daunting and spiritually rewarding experience for me personally – a decade ago I lost all that I knew; my wife, my job, and my cushy life in England. In the years since I’ve been forced to face my shadows and delve deep into places that few have the opportunity or will to explore; The D/A Method has been integral to that process.\n\nTo my former bandmates – I wish you all the very best and thank you for your immense contributions. I haven’t been the easiest person to work with at the best of times – I acknowledge and own that, but I am eternally grateful to you all for sticking around to complete this important work and being a mirror for my truth.\n\nTo our fans – you make my heart smile. What could be better than that?\n\nI can only hope listening to our work inspires you to delve deeper within and chase your dreams. You can do it. Above all, I am grateful to the Almighty Allah for orchestrating all of this and for increasing my faith through this entire process. Indeed, He is the Best of Planners. May He bless us all and allow us to follow our Hearts, for that is where the magic truly lies, and miracles can unfold.”\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheDAMethod"
