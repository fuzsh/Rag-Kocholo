        "text": "We talked to Germany’s threesome ZAHN. If their new album Adria proves anything, Berlin, it is how very versatile and rich instrumental music can be. It is a tour de force, with an hour and twenty minutes of widely varying tunes mixing up post rock with noise rock, punk, metal, psych and sludge. One thing is guaranteed: you won’t be bored. Let’s meet the band.\n\nCan you tell me how Zahn is doing, and who is in the band right now?\n\nZahn is doing extremely well, thank you! The band consists of Chris Breuer on electric bass, synthesizer and pedal steel guitar, Nic Stockmann on drums and electronic drums, and myself, Felix Gebhard, on electric guitar and occasional synth.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the formation of the band?\n\nWe met at a show we all were playing in Leipzig, Germany in late 2019. Since we immediately got along very well, we decided to try and make music together, which we did a few weeks later. Another few weeks later, with a global pandemic making its way across the globe, there wasn’t really anything else to do except play music, so we made our first album.\n\nWhere do you live and how does it affect your music?\n\nWe all live in Berlin. The big city makes certain things easy for bands, like renting a van or getting a gig. Other things, like dividing your time between being creative and having other, worldly, commitments, can get a little more complicated. That is why for recording our albums we usually withdraw to our friend Peter Voigtmann’s studio Die Mühle, in rural seclusion in Northern Germany.\n\nWhat is your musical background, and which other bands did you play in?\n\nI had some early musical training as a child, but didn’t pick up the guitar until I was about seventeen. I started playing in bands right away, faking my way around. I always played with excellent drummers, so that made up a little for my initial inabilities. My first band was called Shitlist, but you’ve certainly never heard of it. One band that traveled a little further was Home Of The Lame, which existed between 1993 and 2012.\n\nWhat is your earliest good music memory?\n\nI remember listening to cassettes in my parents’ Volkswagen T2. We used to drive across many European countries during the summer holidays every year and there was always music playing. It was then that I discovered that I liked a journey to have a specific soundtrack, which led to myself making mix tapes for my own travels later on.\n\nWhich artists were most influential for starting up Zahn and making the music you do?\n\nI wouldn’t say that there was one or more specific artists that were influential for starting this band. All three of us have many years of playing and listening to all kinds of music under the belt and I can’t say we ever talked about how we wanted this band to sound. We just dove in right away, working on a few ideas, found out that we had a cool chemistry going on and went from there and formed our first material.\n\nCheeky theory: I guess that makes ourselves the most influential artists for this group!\n\nBeing an instrumental band, how important is improvisation? How do you write songs, for that matter?\n\nAlthough I like playing improvised music, in Zahn we almost never do this. We usually have a specific riff or a beat that someone, oftentimes Chris, brings to the table and then we start working from there, trying out different ways of playing it or combining it with other parts until it makes sense to us.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your record label? What is the latest news?\n\nCrazysane Records is run by Chris. This makes for a very comfortable situation for us as a band, as we’re very quick in making decisions and managing our things. The latest news is that our second album Adria will come out on November 24. We’ve already released three tracks off the album – check them out!\n\nWhat does an ordinary day in your life look like?\n\nI play in three bands and have three kids, there are no ordinary days in my life. However, I like to sit around somewhere, read a book, sip an espresso and watch people go by, which is a one-hour pastime that I try to squeeze in regularly.\n\nWhat can we expect from the near future, and what would be a dream to come true for next year?\n\nLike I mentioned above, Adria will come out in November and we’re looking forward to taking this album on tour and playing a lot of Zahn shows in 2024.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine readers do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nTurn off the electronic device they’ve read this interview on and go out to take a walk.\n\nhttps://zahn3.bandcamp.com/track/zehn\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/zahn.band\n\nhttps://crazysanerecords.com\n\nhttps://crazysanerecords.bandcamp.com\n\nTRAVO is a band that has the ability to completely kick your ass and give you a much needed energy boost when you’re down. These Portuguese energetic psych prog wizards have taken the best parts of King Gizzard, Elder, Voivod, and DEVO and morphed it into a brilliant steaming psychedelic rock stew for your brain travelling purposes. I was invigorated by its sheer fierceness, and I think you will be too. So let’s not wait a minute longer and meet the band!\n\nHi guys, how are you? Can you introduce the band to the Weirdo Shrine audience?\n\nWhat’s up everyone, we are TRAVO, and we’re a psych rock band from Braga, Portugal. We\n\nare David Ferreira (bass), Gonçalo Carneiro (guitar and synths), Gonçalo Ferreira (vocals\n\nand guitar) and Nuno Gonçalves (drums). We’ve been playing together since 2017, released\n\nour first album “Ano Luz” in 2019, and “Sinking Creation” in 2022. Now we’re about to\n\nrelease our third studio album “Astromorph God”.\n\nWhere do you live, and how would you say it influences your music?\n\nAlthough we’re originally from Braga, three of us live in Porto. This city has some impact on\n\nour music, and it’s a story we like to share. There is an old shopping center, Centro Comercial STOP, where the local community transformed its aging shops into rehearsal rooms and music studios. It has become an iconic cultural center that has seen great bands emerge from there. For the past three years, we’ve spent countless hours in this unique space that has not only provided us with a sanctuary to practice but has also fueled our creativity in a very cool way, making us write our last two albums here. We think that this is the biggest influence we get on our music from the city where we live, although we obviously get inspired by a lot of artists from our hometown, Braga. Unfortunately, STOP is in the process of being shut down by the pricks who run this city, so we will have to find a new place to rehearse, but that’s another story.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the creation of Astromorph God?\n\nHalfway through 2022, a year in which we had concerts almost every weekend, we felt the\n\nneed to compose new material to continue our process of evolution as a band. We aimed for something heavier, faster, more psychedelic and with more jamming moments. We started with some basic ideas recorded at home, and then developed them further in the rehearsal room by jamming and experimenting different things throughout each track. We spent about two months working on it, fine-tuning each song until we were satisfied with it. Before going to the studio we had the opportunity to test it live which was a great warm up for the live recordings.\n\nWhat is the background story of the album title/the lyrics?\n\nWe had composed and recorded demos of all the songs with vocals, but the lyrics were just\n\ngibberish that matched the rhythm and melody of the vocal line. We had a vague idea of\n\nwhat we wanted the story to be, and decided to make each song a chapter in a fantasy saga\n\nabout five mystical stones that are hidden in five different castles, guarded by five different creatures. From then on we took the already recorded vocal lines and gibberish, and started\n\nwriting words that would fit well with the metric, the melodies and the theme. It was during\n\nthis process that the rest of the story and the elements in it acquired detail and we\n\nestablished that a main character would be present and had as his main objective the\n\nretrieving of these 5 sacred spheres. We tried to describe the appearance and abilities of\n\nthis character and the beasts, as well as the settings and events of each encounter.\n\nThe album title, Astromorph God, came much later, in a time where all the songs were\n\ncomposed and the artwork practically finished. It was heavily inspired (to say the least!) by\n\nthe name of a fictional alien species in the book All Tomorrows, by C. M. Kosemen. In this\n\nbook this alien species is called Asteromorph Gods and they’re the supreme entities of the\n\nwhole universe. We thought it fitted the vibe of the album/cover.\n\nWhich bands would you say were strongly influential in creating your own sound?\n\nThree fourths of the band met in middle school and started playing early on, before TRAVO\n\neven existed. It was around the time Tame Impala released Lonerism and we were hooked\n\non that sound and just wanted to emulate it every time we could, so I would say that was a\n\nbig influence, at least for getting started. The truth is that since then we’ve always wanted to make psychedelic music. Later on we all got into the stoner rock and metal scene, largely because SonicBlast festival is almost on our doorstep, and inevitably were influenced by some big names of this genre. If we had to choose the most influential it would definitely be Elder. As we matured as individuals and musicians our tastes changed, and so did our\n\nunderstanding of what psychedelic music can really encompass. We found stuff like\n\nMahavishnu Orchestra’s jazz fusion or Yes’ prog rock to be extremely mind altering listening experiences and we can say that it has influenced us in some way. These may be, from our perspective, the most obvious influences, but, as cliché as it sounds, we really are influenced by all the music we listen to and everything we experience in our daily lives.\n\nWhat would be the best thing to happen to Travo in the coming years?\n\nBeing able to have financial stability solely from the band’s activity would be “the dream”.\n\nAlthough half of us live from music, playing live and composing new songs for TRAVO is\n\nwhat fulfills all of us completely. We know that’s very difficult, specially in Portugal, but that’s definitely the best thing that could happen to us\n\nWhat was the best show you played so far and why?\n\nWe think that Sonic Blast was very special. It is the biggest pure rock and roll festival in\n\nPortugal and, as mentioned before, all of us are assiduous attendants. We saw many of our\n\nbiggest influences throughout the last decade and had the lucky slot of playing at 1 AM, real\n\nfestival prime time. It was a magical night, and we won’t forget it anytime soon.\n\nWhat are your immediate future plans?\n\nIn the immediate future we intend to tour intensively to show you all our new songs. We have a domestic tour scheduled, some gigs in Spain and hopefully a EU tour in 2024. And as\n\nsoon as we feel like it we’ll hit the studio again to record the next one.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine readers do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nThey should sit back, relax, put on some music (Astromorph God or anything else) and\n\ntravel as far as they can within themselves. It was a pleasure answering your questions.\n\nGodspeed,\n\nTRAVO\n\nhttps://travoband.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/travoband\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/travo_band\n\nhttps://spindarecords.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://spindarecords.com\n\nA heavyweight collaboration comes to us, mysteriously flying in a UFO from Mexico and picking up musicians in the USA as well to bless us with extra terrestrial space doom with an impact like a gigantic meteor ramming Earth at full space speed (which is, you know, still incredibly slow…).\n\nThe first encounter with this collaborative album by Mexico’s instrumental space doom band Vinnum Sabbathi and US psych doomers REZN was one of wonder and awe; in stead of sounding like fat drowning in fatness as expected Silent Future sounds big and movie-like but crystal clear, and spectacularly musical. It is set up like a sci-fi movie inspired prog rock concept album, and it is executed with a power and gravitas only these two great doom bands can summon.\n\nREZN vocalist Rob McWilliams’ vocals are crisp like a moonlit lake, and more upfront in the mix than we know from his own band which adds to the proggier atmosphere and gives the entire production a more accessible feel. The spoken word snippets pull the whole thing towards sci-fi X-Files imagery, and the lush use of synthesisers only add to the spacey vibe.\n\nAll considered it makes for one of the most interesting doom related albums of this year, especially because it is a collaboration and therefore a unique experience that might possibly never happen again. Like a gigantic meteor heading straight for the Earth’s core…\n\nI had to talk to Vinnum Sabbathi‘s Roman Tamayo about this brilliant collaborative album. Firstly because he is my highly esteemed colleague in the Doom Charts, but also because he is a brilliant musician and an active and loving member of the international doom scene. He only just returned from a trip to Europe with his band, so there was of course a lot to talk about. About this album they made with REZN, and all the people they met on tour…\n\nHi Roman, how are you doing these days?\n\nHello, everything is going very well, thank you very much. I hope you are doing well too. Life in Mexico is always chaotic, especially after a tour… there’s a lot of work to do and debts to pay, hahaha.\n\nYou just came back from a very nice tour of Europe, right? What were some of the highlights?\n\nSupposedly, before the pandemic, we were going to play several shows there, but everything got canceled for obvious reasons. Returning to Europe after 6 years was incredible; we had a great time and received a very positive response from everyone.\n\nThis time, we were on tour with our brothers from Terror Cósmico, and they helped us a lot by transporting our equipment since we traveled the whole tour using public transportation. That experience was crazy, and I think we were lucky.\n\nYou know, one of our biggest dreams was always to play at DesertFest, and this year, we were able to do it in London, becoming the first Mexicans to play there along with our brothers from Terror Cósmico. It was a very special moment.\n\nAstral Fest was also magical; we got to play alongside Slomatics and Gnod, and it was a great honor to meet them. Sonic Whip was something very impactful for us; the response from everyone was so positive that we couldn’t believe it. It left a profound mark on us as a band and gave us new energy to keep working and striving harder.\n\nOn a personal level, traveling with my friends, meeting old friends again, making new acquaintances, seeing incredible bands, and being able to talk with my heroes were the biggest highlights.\n\nYou know, the one thing nobody can take away from you are your memories and experiences.\n\nWhich artists/people did you meet that left the biggest impressions?\n\nThere were so many amazing people we met on the tour, including every promoter, fan, and band; they are all special.\n\nThe list is quite long, but I can mention a few: Steffan (Colour Haze), Milan (Rotor), Slomatics, Gnod, Causa Sui, Matte (My Sleeping Karma), Slift, Dozer, Matthew (Pigs x7), Haz (Electric Wizard), Jens (Freak Valley), Mother Engine, Ecstatic Vision, Church of Misery, Uli (Krach am Bach), Rolph (Stickman Records), Falk Hagen, Sula Basana, Kanaan.\n\nTell me about the upcoming collaboration with REZN? How did that happen?\n\nWell, REZN came to Mexico in 2019, and we were able to open for their show; it was a glitch in the matrix, but it happened. After that, we started talking about the possibility of doing a Split; it was a topic that kept coming up in our conversations.\n\nOne day, Rob reached out to us and said they had this deal with Blues Funeral for Post Wax, and he proposed the idea of a collaboration with us. Jadd agreed, and that was the beginning of the project.\n\nThanks to REZN, we are part of this great release.\n\nSo how did you write/record it? Was it a long-distance thing, or did you meet up?\n\nThe main credit for this collaboration goes to REZN; they structured the songs, and we worked on those ideas. They would send us demos and we’ll write on top of those foundations.\n\nOur part was recorded at Testa Estudio in León, Gto. It was a challenge because, for the first time, we played different instruments; for example, Gerardo played the guitar on some parts, and Juan played the synthesizer, even our engineer KB recorded some guitar layers.\n\nComposing something remotely is complicated, but I believe that thanks to the work of both bands, we were able to create something special.\n\nWhat is the album about lyrically?\n\nAs for our input to the concept, in short, we get a glance to a visit from the cosmonauts from the ODAT timeline to a new planet to explore, with a lot of biological activity and signs of previous expeditions being conducted.\n\nWhat are your future plans for the project? And for your other projects?\n\nWe are working on a new Split with a legendary band that we love very much; you will soon know the name. After the tour, we talked, and we’re going to stop playing live shows to start composing a new album.\n\nWe don’t know when it will be ready, but we believe it will be different. We have grown as individuals, and our sound has evolved too. We’ll see where this new adventure takes us.\n\nWhat is the thing you are proudest of in your life?\n\nFriends, Family, and Music.\n\nWhat was the best piece of new music you heard this year?\n\nBeyond Vision (Acid King) / Born Under a Mad Sign (Church of Misery)\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine readers do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nCall your family and friends and tell them you love them.\n\nSupport your local community: buy from local stores, attend local shows, volunteer in an NGO.\n\nPlay your favorite music and realize how good your life is.\n\nTreat yourself to something good, like tacos.\n\nhttps://www.rezn.band\n\nhttps://rezzzn.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://www.bluesfuneral.com\n\nhttps://vinnumsabbathi.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-channel-666\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/VinnumSabbathi\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/reznband\n\nWhether it is noisy freak jazz, saxophone crazed grindcore, froth mouthed black metal, or any other type of music that Dutch duo Dead Neanderthals lay their hands on; it instantly becomes cool. For their latest project they have taken on Skeletonwitch guitarist Scott Hedrick to participate in a full on drone-athon and you might think that it finally turned into a shoegazing snoozefest, but nope: once again it’s hella cool.\n\nSpecters is the second part of the Scott Hedrick collaboration in fact, where its predecessor Ghosts was a more ethereal and dynamic affair. This time Dead Neanderthals have gone for the more primal approach though. Specters is two major 18 minute grinding maelstrom jams, made to drive any forward thinking sane person to absolute madness. The combination of its repetition, its sheer gargantuan size, its heaviness, its maddening drum galloping, all make for an inescapable hypnotic experience. The listeners find themselves trapped in a pulsating spiderweb, only to be released when the mighty Dead Neanderthals allow it.\n\nIt is heavy music experimentalism in its most testing format, you know that thing Dead Neanderthals always strive to do. Only with this duo you might find they add a certain finesse and artful depth that always lifts whatever direction they turn upwards to a higher level. They make it cool. It is a dark, impenetrable heavy drone music, with stylish sunglasses.\n\nI got in touch with drummer René Aquarius of the band to ask him about his music life. Like his soulmate Otto Kokke, he is not just a Dead Neanderthal, he is a multiverse of different personas in a plethora of different disguises. We uncovered all of them, and a lot more…\n\nHow are you and Otto, and how is the band? How has the pandemic period been for you?Hi Jasper, we’re doing fine. Thanks for asking. The band is doing great, working on a lot of new stuff and it looks like we have a few releases lined up for 2023. The pandemic was as bad as it was for every band: limited rehearsals and shows. That just sucks. One of the biggest blows was the cancellation of 4 ten-year anniversary shows at Roadburn 2020, because the country was in lockdown. Luckily we were able to play Roadburn Redux with brand new material and here’s the proof of that:\n\nCan you introduce yourselves and the musical projects you are involved in?\n\nWe’re Dead Neanderthals, a pretty extreme duo from The Netherlands. We started in 2010 and have made over 40 releases and played hundreds of shows all over the world. We like to collaborate and have worked with Machinefabriek, Colin Webster, Dirk Serries, Nick Millevoi, Aaron Turner, Aafke Romeijn and -for Specters– with Scott Hedrick. We encourage everybody to check out our discography here: https://deadneanderthals.bandcamp.com\n\nOn our new album Specters, the band consists of: Scott Hedrick, who’s a founding member of Skeletonwitch and working as a composer and sound editor TV and film in Hollywood. Otto Kokke, who’s also involved in MNHM, Kultus and Glum Lord. Rene Aquarius, who’s a part of DungeönHammer , Plague Organ, Horrid Apparition, Cryptae, Heavy Natural, Celestial Bodies, Sneezing Pus and Coffin Lurker.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical backgrounds?\n\nIt’s not really that interesting. We played in some bands and eventually bumped into each other and thought: let’s make music together.\n\nWhat does a regular day in your lives look like?\n\nGet up early. Work all day at our day-time jobs and do all the musical stuff for Dead Neanderthals during the evening (rehearsals, studio sessions, etc).\n\nWhat is the best thing about Specters?\n\nThe collaboration between the three of us. From the minute we started talking about collaborating (which started years ago with our previous album Ghosts), we knew we were all aligned and would be able to make something cool together. Doing it a second time helps in feeling more comfortable in making questionable decisions and seeing where you end up.\n\nWhere do you live and what is the environment like for musicians like you?\n\nOtto and Rene live in Nijmegen, the Netherlands and Scott lives in LA in the USA.The environment for musicians was better in the past in The Netherlands. Lack of rehearsal spaces and especially small venues means there’s less and less opportunity for musicians to meet each other and to get the experience they need to play bigger shows. Of course there’s always a DIY scene which works hard to get things done in whatever way possible, but that’s way more hard core and less traditional than the methods described above.\n\nWhat do you think of the label “experimental” when it comes to your music?\n\nThough ‘experimental’ is a really broad label and slapped on to a lot of stuff, it’s probably justified. It’s pretty weird to write 2 twenty-minute tracks, slap them together and call it an album. On the other hand, we think there’s enough to like for more people than just ‘experimental’ music lovers. So we hope the label doesn’t scare off too many people.\n\nCan you recommend some of your favorite current music to us?\n\nRene: 2023 has been an exceptional year for music so far! I really love the following albums:\n\nPhrozen – Questioning Society’s Secrets || Amazing mix of metal and hardcore that fills the gap that Power Trip left behind.\n\nTongues of Mount Meru – Kalpa || An uncompromising, 100-minute, wall of sound brought to you by veterans Lasse Marhaug and Jon Wesseltoft. Will transform you once you make the trip.\n\nVomi Noir – L’Innommable Remugle et la Mélopée Cavernuleuse des Râles Agoniques || French, Carcass-inspired goregrind of the highest order. What an album!\n\nNightmarer – Deformity Adrift || Such an insanely heavy album. Hearing is believing.\n\nOtto: Not 2023 but always on rotation:\n\nYoshi Wada – Earth Horns with Electronic Drone || Experimental drone from the early seventies.\n\nJack DeJohnette – Music in the Key of Om || Legendary drummer makes a new age album without drums!\n\nVomir – Black Bag || There’s a lot of Vomir out there – and harsh noise wall in general – so kind of arbitrary maybe, but this one just resonates.\n\nScott: Currently in rotation (some 2023, some not)\n\nNatural Information Society – Since Time Is Gravity\n\nJames Brandon Lewis – Eye of I\n\nDe La Soul – 3 Feet High and Rising\n\nRyuichi Sakomoto – Curated playlist for his own funeral\n\nCan you tell me about how you go about composing and recording songs? And/or: what is the best situation to improvise in?\n\nFor the Ghosts and Specters albums it’s usually Otto and René who drafted a basic ‘first structure’. From there on we start discussing and sending over files to see if we can make it work. This process usually takes a while as we go through a lot of options before tying the knot. The most important aspect of it is that we all have to like it. After we feel comfortable about a certain step we make a proper recording and move to the next step. Eventually you end up with an album.\n\nWhat are your immediate and long term future plans?\n\nFirst: release Specters through Utech Records and make sure everybody gets the vinyl in time. Second: Otto and Rene are working on several other records, which will be released later in 2023. Scott is shifting focus to the final touches on an instrumental solo album (Kraut, Pysch, Soundtracky kinda vibe) after Specters. He’s also digging back into the next Skeletonwitch record. All of this is in addition to films/video games he’s currently working on as well.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nDrink some coffee, enjoy and do something unexpectedly nice for someone today!\n\nhttps://deadneanderthals.wordpress.com\n\nhttps://deadneanderthals.bandcamp.com/album/specters\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DEADNEANDERTHALS\n\nhttps://utechrecords.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://www.utechrecords.com\n\nA little while ago we announced this little live EP by Barcelona’s Maragda. Now the time has come to dive a little deeper into what the band has on offer. The EP will be out soon, and the band embarks on a European tour in support of it. If you look at the video below you will get an idea of what that will look like.\n\nThe music shows a labour of love by this band, in which they combine all of their favorite rock flavours into one smooth and tightly executed cluster bomb. There are clear traces of old school metal present, but without the gimmick or the make up. Standing out more perhaps is the lush way the band makes room for psychedelic guitar licks and solos, in a way that makes the whole thing quite unusual in a refreshing fashion.\n\nBut hey, better to watch that agenda and witness for yourself. This two song EP is just a glimpse of what Maragda can do so you better stay focussed and don’t miss out when they play you town in the near future…\n\nIntroduction time! Let’s see what these Barcelona natives are all about then, shall we? The threesome consisting of Marçal Itarte (bass, vocals), Guilem Tora (guitar, vocals) and Xavi Pasqual (drums) is ready to take over the scene and shows a pretty hungry attitude. Here is Maragda.\n\nHow are you? How was the pandemic period for Maragda?\n\nHey! We are all fine. Maragda was still a work in progress during the pandemic. The original tracks were already writen by our bassist, and the pandemic just made it a bit more difficult to meet up and rehearse/produce these songs. As the band wasn’t touring yet, and the first record was still to be released, we believe the pandemic did not hit us as hard as it did with other bands or other music projects we are involved in.\n\nCan you introduce the band, and how did you meet, etc, ?\n\nGuillem and Marçal (we) used to live in the same town as a kids, we were friends and played football in a highschool team. At some point we were flatmates too, and we also had a music project together as teenagers. Maragda came some years after, it was a project in Marçal’s head and asked Guillem about being the guitarrist. He was cool with it but we did not have a drummer, so Guillem asked a drummer he knew, and he suggested Xavi as someone who could fit. We reached him out and he jumped in! At that point we started working on the original tracks, and eventually the first record arrived. The the first shows, then a short EU tour, and now this live EP. Busy times at Maragda!\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical backgrounds?\n\nGuillem is really into 70’s rock. Of course he listens to other stuff, but he is a Led Zep fanboy and everybody knows it!. Marçal used to navigate different genres of metal and rock music, with a strong influence of desert, stoner and psychedelic rock. Xavi listens tomany different genres of music.\n\nWhat does a regular day in your lives look like?\n\nWe think our regular day is the average regular day of a working class 30-35 y/o dude. The tree of us have our jobs and family. Guillem is teaching guitar lessons, recording guitars and playing live with some bands. Xavi is a graphic designer and Marçal works as a social worker. Nothing special here, except the ability to combine obligations with music projection and many other activities we might do to feel alive. Xavi summarixes it like this “Work until 6pm, arrive at home, make the laundry, make the dinner, maybe hangout with friends, maybe read some pages of a book, go to sleep.”\n\nWhat can you tell me about the relationship with your labels Spinda and Nafra Records?Berto of Spinda Records has always helped out Maragda, since the first moment. We reached him out shortly after we recieved our mastered tracks and he decided to participate in the first vinyl edition of our first record. That comes with so many promotionan work and advise. We can’t thank him enough and we are aware the band is going places thanks to his work.\n\nAbout Nafra Records, this is a DIY non profit project that our bassist started a few years ago, together with two friends. They basically contribute funding vinyl edition of local bands, sell them, help promoting the band and occasionally booking some shows. That money is 100% destined to press other vinyl editions for other bands, and keeping thw wheel turning somehow.\n\nWhere do you live and what is the environment like for musicians like you?\n\nXavi lives in a town called Sant Celoni. It’s a big town or a very small city. There is some cultural activity there, and so many musicians. Even though they are not specificaly centered in psychedelic rock as us, the activity is quite notable for a town of that size. Marçal lives in Granollers, which is quite bigger, but paradoxically there is not so many activity as in Sant Celoni. Or at least we feel it’s like that. Guillem, on the other hand, lives in Barcelona, where so many things happen at the same time, and where you have to wisely choosw what show you will attend, as you will be missing others at the same time.\n\nWho are some contemporary musical heroes of yours?\n\nGuillem’s heroes are LedZep, no discussion about that. Marçal is a declarate fanboy of Motorpsycho, and recently he’s also digging into the producer’s side of artists like Omar Rodriguez of Mars Volta or Kurt Ballou of Converge. Xavi’s ones would be Red Hot Chili Peppers, King Gizzard, Berri Txarrak, he has a wide range actually.\n\nCan you tell me about how you go about composing and recording songs?\n\nThe first record was approached more like a production process of already written songs, or at least, original ideas that were demo-ed. We used to meet periodically to work on each part of these original ideas. We set some deadlines and booked a recording studio for a few months later. That way we ended up having our first record recorded in about seven months. The new songs are a bit of a combination of working styles. Some of them are ideas we play at our rehearsal room, jamming riffs and all that stuff. For example, in this new EP, “The Reckless” is a song that was originally jammed and almost 100% completed in the rehearsal room. “Evil Seed”‘s harmony was born in a rehearsal, and then Marçal took it home and developed a bit, developing a vocal melody and song structure to the next rehearsal, and then work it together a bit more.\n\nWhat are your immediate and long term future plans?\n\nWe believe there are a few processes going by at the same time. Probably the most immediate is to have a succesful release of this live EP. By succesful we mean to sell some copies and make people be curious about it, and spin it, share it, you know.\n\nOur not so immediate plan (but “getting close plan”) is our upcoming EU tour, which will happen in August. We are really excited to be part of the almighty Krach am Bach festival, together with sick bands we love; and we are also very happy to have the chance to tour Europe once again, including new countries like Switzerland and Germany. Last, but not least, we are into iour long term future plan, which is the crafting of what will be our next LP. We are writing new songs slow but steady, and we are expectant of what will be the result of this cool process.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?The best for us would be that you (the reader) listen to our music and support the band if you like what you hear!! But the best for you would be just listening to yourself and do whatever the F you want. That is one of the healthiest things in live!\n\nhttps://maragda.bandcamp.com/album/maragda-the-reckless-evil-seed-live-at-cal-gravat\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/maragda.band/\n\nhttps://spindarecords.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://spindarecords.com\n\nThere are instrumental bands that can take you to other worlds in psychedelic bliss, and there are instrumental bands that stay very much in the now, just being themselves and happy to be there. Kanaan out of Norway has heavy “now” vibes. They are “just” three dudes hitting it off instrumentally, but doing it so incredibly well and spontaneous that you find yourself locked in the groove in seconds, jaw to the floor, 100% captivation.\n\nDownpour is the band becoming a jam machine seven consecutive times, and we as lucky bystanders get to watch and learn. Whether their jam session is based on one or more brain splitting riffs or on a hip jiggling jungle groove, these Norsemen make it so that you instantly become their puppet, and all you can do is move to the music.\n\nThe whole thing is a top notch trip, but few personal highlights cannot be left unnoticed; the title track Downpour for instance because of its rhythmic acrobatics and smooth Motorpsycho vibes, Amazon because it features a collaboration with the magnificent Hedvig Mollestad and one of the most memorable riffs this side of 2023, and finally the two parts of Solaris, that make up a thrilling psychedelic space jam that would not be out of place scoring the actual movie.\n\nSure, Kanaan are “just” three dudes out of Oslo, Norway hitting it off musically, but they hit it off so extremely well they make us witness the power of sheer human musical synchronicity. This is what three people locking in and being in the now can accomplish. Better take notice!\n\nI found drummer Ingvald André Vassbø in Oslo booking their tour for Downpour and being generally satisfied with life as his band is hitting it off quite well and turning heads allover the world. Life is good when you have a team of musicians that understand each other so well on multiple levels. Let’s meet Kanaan.\n\nHow are you? How was the pandemic period for Kanaan?\n\nThe pandemic period was for Kanaan as for other bands all over the world a hard time. We had to cancel concerts, postpone studio sessions and in periods weren´t able to meet up at all. Even though it was a hard time for us we were actually able to finish up some work we had to do. We managed to record our album Earthbound in June 2020, our quartet-album Diversions Vol 1: Softly Through Sunshine in May 2021 as well as our addition to the Sampler “International Space Station” which were released on the great label Worst Bassist Records last year. Even though meeting up, planning things and organizing the band was a hassle during that period we were actually able to do some work that we´re all really happy with and proud of.\n\nCan you introduce the band, and how did you meet, etc, ?\n\nThe band consists of myself (Ingvald), Ask Vatn Strøm our guitarist and Eskild Myrvoll, our bass player We met at the Norwegian Academy of Music where we had some very fun jam sessions and found out that we had a lot of common interests, particularly when it came to electric jazz (we studied jazz there) and rock music. We also quickly found out that we liked to play and work together and that we “locked” socially in a very good way. We started to write songs together and booked our first gig which took place in one of the rehearsal-rooms in the basement of the academy. From there on it´s been a very natural thing to play music and do everything that has to do with organizing and playing in a band together.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical backgrounds?\n\nNone of my parents are musicians but i was musically brought up a variety of places. On of them was in my dads record-basement where he had and still has tons of experimental rock-vinyl and cds. Krautrock, Prog, “Rock in Oppostion”, Avant Garde stuff, jazzrock, psychedelic stuff… Since I was quite young we’ve been regularily having these really great listening sessions in the weekends where he still manages to blow my mind with super obscure, and completely amazing music. Listening to music together with him defininetly formed my musicality a lot. Since i was around 9 years until late in my teens we went to Burg Herzberg Festival in Hessen which is a legendary German hippie festival. There I heard a lot of great music from a young age which inspired me a whole deal. We got the chance to see so many of all the legendary 70s kraut rock bands as well as a broad range of what was and still is going on in the german underground scene. I´m really thankful for that!\n\nWhat does a regular day in your lives look like?\n\nFor me, one of the best things about being a freelance musician is that no day is the same. I have a quite busy musical life which consists of practicing alone and with different bands, writing music, going to rehearsals and off course doing administrative work and having meetings. Travelling is also an integral part of my life and is actually one of the things I like the most about being a touring musician. Travelling around and seeing different places, meeting new people and exploring new forms of art and music fits my personality really well and is one of the things about my own life i appreciate deeply.\n\nWhat is the best thing about Downpour?\n\nThere are many things that I’m happy with about Downpour. One of my favorite moments are the first minutes of Solaris pt I. I’m a person who has a lot of energy and often feel that I’m “on the edge of things” musically speaking and often “pushing the beat” and therefore it’s always fun when there are moments when I feel that I really manage to stay calm and “find peace” within in the groove and with the music. On that track I really feel that we managed to create a lush atmosphere with a high degree of energy and direction while at the same time having a sense of calm and control within the music. I hope that I can manage to do the same thing live! I love when one is trying to “nail” or “interpret” a specific vibe for the music and it ends up transfering so much emotion back to you. That I feel happened a lot during the recording of this album.\n\nWhere do you live and what is the environment like for musicians like you?\n\nAll three of us live in Oslo at the moment and there is a really fruitful music scene at the moment. There’s a lot of interesting music going in Oslo and in Norway in general so it is a great pleasure to be part of. One of the best parts about it is that we feel that people are quite open and one is able to try out different things and be parts of many different “scenes” at once. There´s no “poppers vs the rockers” or anything like that. People are into a lot of different stuff which i really like. There are also a lot of concerts every night, so I never become deprived of inspiration. That’s for sure!\n\nWho are some contemporary musical heroes of yours?\n\nIngvald: Some of my biggest contemporary-ish musical influences are Oneohtrix Point Never, Moor Mother, James Ferraro, Caroline Polachek, Poil with Junko Ueda, Lightning Bolt, Zach Hill and Hella, Daughters, Punkt vrt. Plastik, Ambrose Akinmusire, Viljay Iyer, Elder, Black Midi, Steve Lehman, Domi & JD Beck, Marcus Gilmore, Guro Moe, Horse Lords, Oneida, Njaaljos Ljom, Danny Brown, Slift, Björk +++\n\nCan you tell me about how you go about composing and recording songs?\n\nFor the most part we’ve been writing songs together in our rehearsal space. Normally one of us comes up with an idea for a groove, a riff, a chord progression, a vibe etc and then we work and expand on it together. We’re always discussing and trying out different ways of playing and experimenting with the ideas. This approach changed a bit during the pandemic when we weren’t able to meet up in the same way as before. The Downpour album was therefore more composed more individually with demos and so on. The demo-ideas was of course changed, re-arranged and experimented with collectively but less so than with the other albums.\n\nWhat are your immediate and long term future plans?\n\nOur first upcoming project is a concert together with Øvre Eiker Kulturskole (a music school where Ask teaches) which we’ve been planning for a long time. We’re going to perform two songs from our first record Windborne, one from Earthbound and one song from Downpour together with over 70 kids from 6 to 20 years who play a wide array of different instruments. (violins, trumpets, classical percussion, acoustic guitars, clarinets etc). Our music was arranged by a super talented jazz-singer, composer and arranger called Vilde Aakre Lie so we´re super excited about that. It will be really interesting and fun project.\n\nIn May we´ll play a handful of club shows in Norway to promote our upcoming album Downpour, and after that we´re going on a two week european tour between the 17th and 28th of May. We are also planning a few festival shows in Finland, Portugal and Germany this summer as well another European tour in august and September which we’re really looking forward to do!\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nOrder tickets to an upcoming Kanaan show and come and meet us. We´re really nice people 🙂\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kanaanband/\n\nhttps://kanaanband.bandcamp.com/album/downpour\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kanaanband/\n\nhttps://www.jansenrecords.com/\n\nFinding new record labels can be like discovering an unopened box of chocolates, waiting to be eaten just by you. Especially when they are little obscure treasure chests like Copenhagen’s Virkelighedsfjern, run by multi instrumentalist and musician in many bands Kristian “Krill” Andersen. I found out about his label through Pariah Child and Yoshiwara Collective occultist Danny Angus, and have been browsing its Bandcamp page ever since. It’s like this endless rabbit hole of every kind of underground style there is, from eerie black metal, to maddening doom, to creepoid soundscapes and kaleidoscopic space rock.\n\nNot to forget about Krillin’s own ventures, the latest addition being Naturale’s Meditation Over Mørket. It is a haunting crossbreed of folk, drone, and ambient psychedaelia that feels like an unearthed document of long ago. It is a record that demands your time and attention, and only when you are mindfully listening will reveal all its secrets and hidden beauty. But lo! This is only one of Krillin’s many incarnations. Let’s hear him out about his other bands and ventures, and dive deep into his personal treasure chest called Virkelighedsfjern…\n\nHow are you? Can you introduce yourself and you multiple endeavors?\n\nI’m good, thanks. My name is Kristian but everyone calls me Kriller. I am a musician from Copenhagen, Denmark and I deal mostly in psychedelic and drony stuff. Some of it quiet, some of it heavy. I like to try out different things.\n\nI’ve been running a solo project for some years now. It has been a way to explore different sounds than I get to do normally. In 2019 I recorded some ambient/folky songs and together with Sven of Svensk Psych Aften I decided to put it out on vinyl. Getting everything together and finishing the songs took a few years and it came out in January of this year through Svensk Psych Aften, Yoshiwara Collective, Vinyl Troll and Virkelighedsfjern (which is my own label). The project is called Naturale and the record is Meditation Over Mørket. Right now I am playing shows with a band that I put together from my old band Måneskjold and my friends in Drukner. We are playing our second show at the festival Vesterbro Beat Dage in a few weeks. I am really looking forward to that. This time around we will have eight people on stage.\n\nI also play in a band called GAIA. We describe ourselves as cosmic doom. It is kind of noisy and spacy. We put out a drone album last year called Tilblivelse and since then we have been focusing on a project with our friend Jakob which is called Solens Folk. Maybe it’s a bit more artsy. Definitely more theatrical.\n\nI am also part of a band called Lucid Grave. We put out the record, Cosmic Mountain, through Italian label Electric Valley last year. We have some shows around Denmark this spring and hope to get out of the country after summer. This band is a hotchpotch of different but related things like psychedelic rock, punk and doom. Our live shows are getting really good. I have a lot of fun with this band right now.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical background?\n\nI have played guitar since my early teens. I was always interested in the different sounds that an electric guitar could make more than really playing it and of course Rage Against The Machine was still active back then and I knew of stuff like Jimi Hendrix, but I think that bands like Monster Magnet and Baby Woodrose got me on a path of weirder music. Not that they themselves are particularly weird but they hold a lot of references in them. In terms of learning to play, it is mostly something I have done through playing with others. When I was starting out there was one other kid in the little suburb of Copenhagen where I grew up who had similar interests. His name is Rasmus. We have played in different bands over the years. We tried to start a stoner band back then but never got really far. Later on we had the band Måneskjold for ten years. We had our last show in November and now he is helping me with Naturale. He is also working on a solo record of his own that I am really looking forward to.\n\nWhat does a regular day in your life look like? What role does music play?\n\nWell, if I have time I put on a record after I have had a shower. Then I go to work. I work in a pre-school and spend most of the day there and when I get off work I might go to the rehearsal space or go home and work on something related to the Virkelighedsfjern label. Or go home and lie on the couch and listen to records and wait for my girlfriend to get off work. She lives in Greenland and there is a four hour time difference. Time differences are annoying. I also might hang out with a friend or go to a show. Music plays a quite large role. I spend a lot of time working on music related projects and I enjoy listening to music.\n\nWhat do people often forget when they think about running a record label?\n\nMost often it seems that people forget that everything costs money. Maybe also, that it takes a lot of your time. I find a lot of it fun and enjoyable, but some things related to it are just plain hard work, like taxes for instance. There are probably also some ideas about what labels are that are based on how it was in the past, specially a label doing physical releases but I almost always have nice interactions with people; artists, customers, shops and such, so I’m not sure.\n\nWhere do you live and how does it affect your musical doings?\n\nI live in Copenhagen. It is the largest city of Denmark and this of course gives me easy access to a lot of places, compared to people who live in more rural areas. I can easily go see shows, my bands have an easier time getting warm up shows or shows at festivals, the rehearsal space is close. A downside might be that we are on an island and have to cross a bridge or take a ferry to get anywhere…almost.\n\nCan you highlight some of your favorite releases on Virkrlighedsfjern, and tell us why?\n\nYeah, sure. The first one I would like to highlight is Qualities Of Naught by Prefix Suffix. It is a record that marked a change in Virkelighedsfjern because this was when the focus shifted to vinyl. We had put out some but with our own bands mostly but with this one we took a chance. I also really enjoy this record. I love Prefix Suffix and this is probably my favorite record along with Dungeon Loops, which is also great, but that one we only put out on tape. Prefix Suffix exists somewhere between noise and metal music and plays around with a lot of different styles and techniques. There is something very unique about it, like, the insistence on quite bad drum sounds (drums are programmed or performed on a sampler) which is something that might come from the Shitcore influences. Anyways, Qualities Of Naught starts out with the excellent Alle Mænd Er Bøsser (All Men Are Gay) which is an uptempo punk-song that goes a lot of places in under a minute. Snakeman’s Dance is at the top of my list of riffs I wish I had written. The song is technically a cover but I think he did the riff himself. The last song sounds like an ambient song from a doom record. Very versatile but probably not for everyone.\n\nPilots/Greeting by Late Night Venture is an EP that sort of bridges the gap from their earlier more indie sounding sound to their heavier later sounds. It has two songs and I love both of them. I really love the build on greetings and I love the motif that is carried through the song. Pilots start out nice and heavy but also have some nice atmospheric parts. They have a new record out now that is a lot heavier. I have not heard it yet though. It is on my list.\n\nI would also like to highlight Molok‘s Salt. Molok is criminally underrated in my book and Salt is probably my favorite of their releases even though Skær and Alting Skal Nok Gå are very close. The base of the band is black metal but they do not stick to the recipe. On Salt there are elements of post rock and punk also present. I really love the opener on this one. Other than that I think my favorite song is Et Dårligt Minde I Karresbækminde. The riff that opens that song is crazy.\n\nзелёный дядя u сёрферы чёрной дыры‘s In The Animal Kingdom. The name translates to Green Uncle and the Black Hole Surfers. When I heard this band I thought: “I have been missing this sound. This is exactly what I want to hear and I haven’t heard it before.” It is somehow evident to me that they have listened to a lot of kraut rock even though it doesn’t have that sound that is always being copied from those bands. Mostly it reminds me of a fresh take on space rock, which is one of my favorite genres of music. The way of using synth here is a lot different from what you hear in space rock and I love it!\n\nLastly I would also like to highlight the two GAIA-splits we put out because they mean a lot in the development of Virkelighedsfjern. GAIA is of course my own band and I wont say a lot more about that. The splits were with our friends in Drukner and Slowjoint. Both are great.\n\nWho are your favorite current other artists and record labels at the moment?\n\nWell I have to mention Vinyl Troll Records that also helped put out the Naturale record. He just put out the new Late Night Venture. He is very active these days. Also Svensk Psych Aften who put out my favorite record of the last few years, Centrum‘s För Meditation with Rocket Recordings. I would also like to recommend the new record from Kogekunst’s Oskar Krusell. I would call that weirdo pop and the new record from Stikkersvin. I would call that weirdo black metal. For someone who really doesn’t like black metal very much I sure am talking a lot about it. Well, there is a lot of it these days…..\n\nHow do you handle new submissions to your label? What are the criteria?\n\nI have been thinking about how to improve the system I have, because right now they come in through an email that I use for a lot of things and sometimes they do drown between all the other mails there. Anyways, I have a bit of a silent partner, Morten from GAIA, who helps me listen. He has a very good ear for this stuff and knows genres like black metal better than me. If we like it we try and see what we can do. So, that is the only criteria; do we like it? Then the next question is what media it fits. It is not everything that it makes sense to put out on vinyl. When we made the shift towards vinyl, we started Olmen Tapes to still have an output for the weirder bands and projects.\n\nFor Black Hole Surfers: how do you deal with possible outward pressure about the fact that they are Russian?\n\nI haven’t felt much pressure. But a lot of the time people don’t put criticism to your face, maybe some people are turned off by the label now. Who knows? There are two things that I want to mention in connection to this though. First, it is not possible for me to trade with people in Russia right now, which is too bad, but understandable. I don’t like war, but I guess this is how that stuff works. Another thing that I find more interesting is, the conversations I do have with people from Denmark about representing a russian band. People ask me if it isn’t difficult and I tell them that in some respects it is (aforementioned problems along with maybe them touring europe, which would also be good for me), but they are people like me who do not want war so for us to work together, to me, seems like a good idea. The opposite of the dehumanisation of other people that often come with war. When people hear that they are opponents of the government then they ask if they aren’t afraid of the police or if they are in jail. People here have no idea what’s going on in Russia and that leaves lots of room for the aforementioned dehumanisation. I think people who want an alternative to the accumulation of power that seems to be at the center of these problems should continue to work together.\n\nWhat is “the dream” for you as an artist, and as a label owner?\n\nA straightforward answer might be the fame and fortune one, or maybe to be able to live off it. But most of all the reason I do this is that I want to help people hear some music that I think they should hear. In that sense I am living the dream. I mean to have Virkelighedsfjern be bigger along with all these bands would be great. I think I can connect that to my dream about the rest of the world, which is that everything should be a lot different than what it is now.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nGo out to a live show. Live music is still not back in any way close to how it used to be. This causes cancellations and makes it hard for everyone involved venues, bands and so on… That is a way to support your local music scene. So, do that!\n\nhttps://virkelighedsfjern.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Virkelighedsfjern\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/virkelighedsfjern/\n\nhttps://gaiadoom.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/lucidgrave\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Naturalecph\n\nThe psychedelic can take on many forms. Sometimes what seems to be a heavy metal pummeling from the outside can be much more transformative and hypnotising than another one of those thousands of shoegazing tie die wearing hippie bands. Italian heavy noise rock outfit The Turin Horse are here today to prove exactly that point, and they drive it home with excessive force.\n\nOn Unsavory Impurities we find Riot Season Records alumnus Enrico Taurasco (Dead Elephant) combine forces with weirdo math rocker Alain Lapaglia from Morkobot in an unholy union also in a couple of songs joined by baritone saxophone madman Alessandro Cartolari. Together they sound like a throng of stampeding mammoths just got launched on a paint factory in the middle of a bustling metropolis.\n\nThe first part of the record is especially ferocious, recalling Remission-era Mastodon and early Today Is The Day‘s mouth foaming madness. Chicago’s jazz metal wizards Yakuza also come to mind, especially near the end when the sax demands more attention. The real psychedelic shitshow starts there, when The Turin Horse‘s noise rock mayhem takes a back burner and is overtaken by some serious saxophone supported trippery. The song Hybris is a perfect example of how chillingly caustic horns can sound in an ambient noise atmosphere, it is literally breathtaking. Album closer Tear Off The Stitches finally leaves no stones unturned, combining all of the aforementioned elements and slowly smashing your skull with it.\n\nThis is how psychedelic heavy music can be, a trip like hitting yourself in the face with a claw hammer. It hurts, but my God, you can see some beautiful colors too.\n\nSo let’s meet the band! This Italian duo are no hatchlings, no! They are weathered and feathered musicians who have long since proved their stripes. Without further ado, here is The Turin Horse:\n\nHow are you? How was the pandemic period for The Turin Horse?\n\nHello, thanks for the space you are giving us. When the first lockdown came we were finishing recording the vocals. I honestly believe that the restrictions have benefited the creative processing of the album because we have been able to devote more time and energy to it than we normally would have been able to. The record also represented a target to be pursued while everything else crumbled. So in this meaning we are grateful for it. In hindsight I think we were lucky to “photograph” the band in that moment in a studio. Anyway for me the pandemic is an open wound. We publicly have harshly criticized the measures that have been taken by the Italian government regarding the pandemic which expressed a virocentric vision of the problem, without dealing with all the other aspects of citizens’ lives in a society. The government kept the focus solely on the virus, on the risk of contagion and about the profits of the Italian industrial and financial bourgeoisie while it wasn’t possible to make any criticism of the political management of the pandemic which was irrational, hypocritical, discriminatory and even criminal. The propaganda made by the government and the media has made a great contribution in making the protest in which I personally participated appear as something very ambiguous, stupid, exploitable by various conspiracy theories and political forces, unleashing war between the poor and justifying the social butchery that the government was doing by trying to avoid all their responsibility by unloading them on the citizens.\n\nTo disagree with all of this there is no need to bother with conspiracy theories. I was very worried about the political decisions and how I saw people around me thinking, much more than about the virus.\n\nMoreover in addition to playing, I have dedicated the last 15 years to working in treatment facilities for drug addicts and people with mental health problems. I devoted a lot of my efforts in my life to try to broaden people’s perception of what we call life. After all, even art has this purpose for me. So what happened to Italy I perceived it as a failure for me, as a human being. Seeing most people around me legitimize all of this, be silent, incite hatred towards one’s fellow humans or discriminate made me fall into a constant and deep state of sadness that I’m still fighting now. I still have the impression today that Italians prefer to “remove” what happened from their minds, trying to forget it. It’s certainly easier not to think about it but as artists I think we have a duty to question ourselves about reality, otherwise what we do is just another useless product of capitalism. I definitely play to sell records too but at the top of my priority scale are other things. Anyway I am taking deeper care now about my life and slowly I’m getting better and better.\n\nCan you introduce the band, and how did you meet, etc, ?\n\nThe Turin Horse is a duo based on drums, guitar, vocals and samples. We try to play heavy music. In two songs on Unsavory Impurities there’s also a baritone sax. All three people who have played on this record have known each other for many years because they are veterans of the Italian independent scene with other bands such as Dead Elephant, Morkobot and Anatrofobia. The reason why we met was the need to try to feel again that thrill run down our spine while playing, trying to use our imagination and be constructive to create something we couldn’t find around us. As someone said: saying something while being kidnapped by the hurricane is the only fact that can compensate us for not being the hurricane.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical backgrounds?\n\nEnrico-the guitar player/voice: Until 2011 I played with Dead Elephant a noise/posthc band with which I recorded two albums.\n\nAlain – the drummer: Alain has recorded four albums with the band Morkobot. a math/experimental instrumental group with two basses and drums.\n\nAlessandro – the sax player: he has always moved in the punk/freejazz area making a few dozen records. His current bands are Masche and Extrema Ratio but in the Italian antagonist environment he is best known for another band called Anatrofobia.\n\nWhat does a regular day in your lives look like?\n\nMe and Alain are social workers. Alessandro is a programmer.\n\nWe are like your neighbors.\n\nWhat is the best thing about Unsavory Impurities?\n\nPersonally my favorite part is the second one, the B side. Which is, I think, the one where we piss the most out of the cup. For me the songs with Alessandro (the baritone sax player) are the best. In general I like how we managed to capture the intensity and viscerality of our shows in the recording. The main idea was to document what we are at the moment and the musical journey we have made. I think the album isn’t a compilation of singles but an organic work, a journey made up of 10 songs, which needs more active and participatory listening to be fully appreciated. I think it lends itself to different levels of listening that return different things to the listener. The recording is very raw and ungraceful and deliberately contains many execution inaccuracies compared to today’s record standard because we focus our work in the studio to try to bring out our sensibility as musicians without pretending to appear perfect with an abuse of editing tools. We tried to give an effective and realistic overall picture of us that highlights the unique human confirmation that this band represents. Trying to accomplish this task was much more interesting for us than doing the homework perfectly.\n\nWhere do you live and what is the environment like for musicians like you?\n\nI moved to Spain about a year ago and here I still don’t know the music reality very well.\n\nAlain and Alessandro are still in Italy. In Italy it’s complicated to carry on this type of musical path because it’s a small country and very conservative. So when you start doing something like this you already know that in many places you are barred from playing. The circuit of places where a band like the Turin Horse can play is much smaller than the American one also due to its proportions. There is a lot of xenophilia and the Italian bands that are more original find it very difficult to be considered because in my opinion there’s a lack of real musical critical awareness. Moreover over the past 10 years thanks to repressive government policies they have closed many squats which were the place where you could hear the less aligned music because these places in addition to the fact that they had a cultural interest in this music enjoyed the privilege of not having the expenses that must support a club. A big cultural hole has been created which is still empty. So in fact the musical situation has become impoverished because in a club most of the time it only counts how many beers the bar can sell with the result that if you don’t have a big audience consideration you can’t play in it. The end result is that more and more space is given to culturally harmless and mannered musical realities because they guarantee clubs the income they need to survive. A vicious circle that pushes everything downwards. In fact, Italy is slowly disappearing from the tour maps of foreign underground bands. It seems clear to me that in Italy we are in a phase of big cultural contraction. But today thanks to the effects of globalization a band like the Turin Horse fortunately can more easily choose not to rot in a rehearsal room and deal with different and more friendly realities in the rest of the world.\n\nWho are some contemporary musical heroes of yours?\n\nAll the people who played on this record are over 40 and have quite different tastes. I personally grew up with noise and punk/hc and then over time I widened my field of action. The first names that come to mind are: Bastro, Negazione, Tom Verlaine, Ash Ra Tempel, Dazzling Killmen, No Means No, Michael Mantler, Ornette Coleman, Coil, Henry Flynt, Throbbing Gristle and many more. I stop here because the list could be very long!\n\nCan you tell me about how you go about composing and recording songs?\n\nI think the hardest part of what we did was building my guitar backline. I experimented a lot to make the Turin Horse sound like this and built a lot of the instrumentation I use. We couldn’t find a bass player so we chose to see this lack as an opportunity to explore new solutions. I’ve even made custom pickups that only take the bottom 3 strings of the guitar to make my job easier. We didn’t want to use any tricks in the studio so we spent a lot of time crafting our sound before recording. We deliberately gave a lot of space to the rhythm because being two, it was the most natural thing to do for us. Everything else went pretty standard. As with all other bands, rehearsals and concerts have allowed us to focus more and more on what we wanted to say and how we wanted to say it. We have tried to give space to different approaches to the type of sound we wanted to handle because we like to put ourselves and our listeners to a sort of dare, tending to escape from clichés and go out of our comfort zone. The idea behind it all was to produce music that requires a high participation from the listener and that communicated to us that sense of amazement we had when we first heard music in our lives…It’s obviously a utopia…who knows if we really succeeded…We tried.\n\nWhat are your immediate and long term future plans?\n\nActually here in Spain I don’t have a band and I’m currently writing compositions for my solo project but it’s too early to reveal details. With the Turin Horse we are trying to figure out if we can do shows. It’s not easy because the rest of the band and I are far away but we’re trying to figure out how to do it.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nI hope I have aroused the curiosity necessary to press play on our album. That’s the real thing. Do it.\n\nhttps://invisibleorderrecords.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://www.reptilianrecords.com\n\nhttps://theturinhorse.bandcamp.com/album/unsavory-impurities\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TurinHorse999\n\nSomewhere in a field in Iowa, USA three aliens plug in their gigantic amps. They have heard of this thing called “jamming”and want to make an attempt themselves. Inspired by by human bands like Om and Earthless they have bought themselves a bunch of gear and are ready to rumble. Once their amplifiers switch on a million tiny little eyes start to glow. Countless tentacles start strumming strings and banging at drums. The result is this ginormous spacious, doomy, jazzy, psych sludge album called Big Bright Empty Nothing.\n\nInstrumental alien doom psych from Iowa? You better believe it. With a sound that’ll make you crawl into your comfortable chair and disappear, turning up a day later mumbling something about pink aliens, green lakes, and a million tiny little eyes. They have arrived, and they will turn your senses into mush.\n\nWho knew three spaced out aliens could turn a first jam into such a lush and trippy journey? No need for Mulder and Scully to jump into an investigation though, but you should. Check out their Bandcamp right now and jump on the UFO!\n\nAliens?! Lies! These three humans in disguise are the pundits responsible for the racket of T.A.N.G. Let’s lift the veil and quickly learn all about them…\n\nHow are you? How has the pandemic period been for T.A.N.G.?\n\nThe pandemic stopped a lot of momentum we had playing gigs. I live in Iowa and not much has changed when the pandemic happened, but it gave us some time to write a super solid album and record it at Lone Tree, Iowa. It was rough at first but we came out of writing done a new lease on playing shows and performing.\n\nCan you introduce the band, and how did you meet, etc?\n\nI (James) met Zach Ryserson at Luther College and bonded over our love of Lil Ugly Mane which eventually turned into punk/metal and then graduated to stoner metal and doom. We were jamming with our friend JJ on drums, but went on to do his own project. Our senior year we met Leo Naughton-Herbach who is a killer drummer and music aficionado and the rest is history.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical backgrounds?\n\nLeo and I come from a more hardcore punk/DIY background while Zach is from a more refined Jazz/Funk/Large Band background. Leo has played drums in jazz and big band settings but had his feet wet in the Minneapolis punk/metal scene since he was in High School. I played and went to a lot of house shows in high school but can remember being involved with music since I was like 5 or 6. Love the atmosphere or house shows a lot more. I’m pretty sure I took Ryerson to his first few DIY gigs and he was all about it. We just love performing and didn’t really care where the gig was, party in some guy’s house or in a more refined concert setting, a gig is a gig. We all love punk/metal/jazz and even though we got into music for differently, it’s the DIY community that made us go all in.\n\nWhat does a regular day in your lives look like?\n\nA Regular day for T.A.N.G is to contemplate the horrors that lie beyond our meaningless existence and smoke hella weed. Prolly play some music and kendama for fun.\n\nWhat is the best thing about Big Bright, Empty Nothing?\n\nI think what we love about BBEN is how dynamic it is and how each track flows with each other. We spent alot of time making sure this release sounded as fluid as possible.\n\nWhere do you live and what is the environment like for musicians like you?\n\nI live in Iowa, Zach lives in Minneapolis, and Leo lives in Chicago. Obviously, the doom/stoner scene is much bigger there and there are tons of shows for bands like that while in Iowa the reception can be a little mixed. There are punk and metal bands, but nothing that sounds like us really. Overall people are usually open minded and like it, but we are definitely an anti-normie kind of sound. weirdo’s only for the most part. We met at a lutheran private music school and kids there were students that are insanely stuck up about music. Choir kids mostly. Having shows there was alot of fun cause alot of those students haven’t really seen good live bands, but never understood the sound we were going for. We kind of have an alienating sound but that is what we signed up for with a group like this.\n\nWho are some contemporary musical heroes of yours?\n\nEarthless was a massive inspiration in starting this band. Love the dynamics and soloing style Isiah brings to the table. Even though it’s mostly instrumental, they have written some of the most epic songs of all time in my opinion. Om‘s writing style we definitely take a lot from also. We’re all fans of bands like Electric Wizard, Conan, EYEHATEGOD etc and love slower paced metal with crushing riffs. I’ve always been a fan of the work ethic guys like Ty Segall, Thee Oh Sees, and King Gizzard have. Reminds me of old school jazz musicians that were constantly in the studio putting out a few records a year trying to hone their craft. Honestly too many people to bring up honestly haha. We have certain genres of music we are all passionate about but we are able to bring other influences to make the T.A.N.G sound. Just saw the Delvon Lamarr Organ Trio in Omaha and they were killer.\n\nCan you tell me about how you go about composing and recording songs?\n\nZach and I write a bunch of riffs and come together and see what fits. Since it’s instrumental, I try to make riffs a little intricate, but still try to make sure they are very listenable and groovy. Still want people to headbang of course but want to write something you can listen to and not get bored of, cause chances we’ll be playing it for like 5-7 minutes. We all come together and work on transitions and discuss what feels right. It’s controlled chaos but we have developed a writing style that is effective for us. The last 2 albums we recorded at Flat Black Studios with Luke. His studio is amazing and has a ton of awesome gear we use to help make some of the sounds you hear in the latest album. With his resources and knowledge, we are able to get some gnarly sounds over overdubs. We have songs completely written,but usually have a whole day in the studio just trying to make the weirdest sounding shit ever. Really can’t recommend working with him enough. He’s a top 10 guy of all time.\n\nWhat are your immediate and long term future plans?\n\nWrite more songs, play more shows. Hopefully do a little tour or play some festivals. We already have some ideas for our next few songs. We all just want a massive discography and we’re just getting started in my opinion.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nTake an 1/8 of mushrooms and listen to Big Bright Empty Nothing on Spotify, Bandcamp, or Youtube. Come to one of our shows.\n\nhttps://tangiowa.bandcamp.com/album/big-bright-empty-nothing\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TANG666666\n\nSanto Rostro from Spain have created a monstrous psychedelic sludge sound on their new album Después No Habra Nada (after this there will be nothing). So what do you do when you are an image thinker like me? You start looking for actual psychedelic sludge monsters on AI drawing generators and see how they hold up to this.\n\nMy first attempt was this greenish psychedelic swamp monster. This was not quite what I had in my own mind though. While Santo Rostro’s music definitely has a swampy quality, it is much more soaring, and not as murky as some of their doomier sludgier peers. The image does bring forth some of their psychedelic qualities though, which is a striking feature of Después No Habra Nada. But the picture also has a certain evasive, mystical quality to it, whereas Santo Rostro are much more straightforward. Let’s give it another try then.\n\nFor the second attempt I tried adding “huge” and “dark” to my first directives. The result is this black gargantuan doom beast that looks pretty awesome, I must admit. It is still not quite the best image for Santo Rostro, as they are much more natural, human sounding band. For all their psychedelic sludge bestialities, they are still three dudes in a room riffing their asses off. Santo Rostro have a dark side for sure, but they aren’t this three eyed demonic nightmare thing. Next!\n\nSo I added two of Santo Rostro‘s important influences; Mastodon and High On fire, and ended up with…a giant mammoth on fire? This is actually the closes to the image I had in my head before. It is still a pretty heavy and awe inspiring picture, but it is also much more down to earth. It fits the music better, as it is doomy, smokey, and hazy, but also ferocious and violent. Yes. Santo Rostro has created a gigantic fiery mammoth of an album, you better have your images right before digging in!\n\nSanto Rostro‘s Miguel Ortega(guitars, synths) answered the questions, introducing the band and explaining their comings and goings. So let’s not waste any more time and get to meet this Spanish psychedelic sludge monster!\n\nHow are you? How has the pandemic period been for Santo Rostro?\n\nHi! We’re fine, the pandemic was the strangest period we’ve ever had, but luckily we came out fine. Our shrink may have a different opinion, though.\n\nCan you introduce yourself, how did you meet, etc,?\n\nSure! we’re three guys from a small lovely town in southern Spain and we met 10 years ago. We all wanted to play gigs all around the country and we have had a great time doing it. It’s been so much fun and we consider ourselves lucky for being able to do it. We have met great friends and wonderful people. It really has been one of the best things we’ve ever done, and we’d love to keep on doing it as long as is fun and entertaining!\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical backgrounds?\n\nWe all have a standard heavy rock backgound, nothing fancy here. These days I’m quite into new jazz and afro polyrythms, but when we began we were a Sabbath/High on Fire/Mastodon thing. Right now we’re aiming for psychedelic, crazy and heavy. Again, lots of fun!\n\nWhat does a regular day in your lives look like?\n\nWe have our daily regular jobs that allow us to play music in our free time. We’re always thinking about music, that’s who we are. We got ugly regular jobs, beautiful families and music. Not bad!\n\nWhat is the best thing about the new album?\n\nThe best thing is that It’s finally done!\n\nWe know there is some serious playing in there, we smashed ourselves in the rehearsal space for a month and a half with no days off. That work pays and can be heard on the f**** record, it’s a great feeling. It’s got heavy but non heavy-typical-riffy guitars. Lots of synths and the best drumming you can imagine. Kuki (our drummer) really shines in this record.\n\nWho are some contemporary musical heroes of yours?\n\nOranssi Pazuzu. Really amazing band doing wicked and dark stuff. Really cool and imaginative.\n\nCan you tell me about how you went about composing and recording songs differently after the last album?\n\nWe recorded 8 songs in 2019 but didn’t like the result, there was not a clear direction and we were under rehearsed, so we threw that away and started from scratch in the middle of the pandemic with the idea of making some dark psychedelic music with odd timings. We got heavily into it and came out really nice. Lots of parts were written in isolation, but it was really well put together and played live in the studio. Something like King Crimson‘s “Red” album. We really think is a great way to put down records, because you have the best of woth worlds: Live music is fresh and exciting, while overdubs and synths give you textures, colours and ear candy!\n\nWhat are your immediate and long term future plans?\n\nWe’ll be touring Spain on 2023 and 2024, but as soon as ideas start to flow we’ll record them. Who knows? Tomorrow I might be dead, so, better do it now!\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nGo to our IG or FB and comment the first publication that appears. Just say “Santo Rostro is not weird enough, try harder!” (No matter what the publication is about).\n\nhttps://santorostro.bandcamp.com/album/despu-s-no-habr-nada\n\nhttps://spindarecords.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/StoRostro\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SpindaRecords"
