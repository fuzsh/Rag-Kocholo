        "text": "Description\n\nLimited 2000 edition with a bonus live cd called Just Add Live.\n\nJust Add Life from 1996 was The Almightys fifth and last album to be released until 2000s self-titled album during which time the band split up. Two singles, All Sussed Out and Do You Understand were released from the album in multiple parts in the United Kingdom and both were made into music videos. The song Coalition Star was co-written with members of punk band The Ruts, of which Warwick was a fan. Just Add Life was the bands first album on their new label and much like being a new addition to a label, the music found here is new to the band, quite a contrast to their previous work… sort of. When the band began their career the band was a full-blown metallic machine with loud guitars, harsh vocals and some melody thrown in for good measure. Now… well… the band has been somewhat drained of their loudness and metallic overtones and gone for a more commercially friendly sound of both punk and metal influences i.e. Some Kind Of Anything, All Sussed Out and 8 Day Depression. Sounds similar to the plight of Metallica, eh? BUT in the end though Just Add Life is a good record with strong melody, with some powerful vocals provided by guitarist/vocalist Ricky Warwick. With a mixed bag of goodies and sounds ranging from Metallica to face to face to Therapy?, The Almighty’s album has something for everyone… that is if the music that fans crave is tight melodic guitars jam packed with catchy vocals.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n1. Ongoing And Total\n\n2. Do You Understand\n\n3. All Sussed Out\n\n4. How Real Is Real For You\n\n5. Dead Happy\n\n6. Some Kind Of Anything\n\n7. Coalition Star\n\n8. 8 Day Depression\n\n9.
