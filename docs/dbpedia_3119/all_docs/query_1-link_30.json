        "text": "Emancipation is the 19th full-length studio album by Prince (his third using the name ) and the first album to be released following the end of Prince’s contract with Warner Bros., which ended less than a week prior to this album’s release. It is also Prince’s first released triple album. It was released worldwide in November 1996 (just four months after Chaos And Disorder).\n\nSessions and compiling\n\nPrince (as ) began recording songs for the album in January 1995, and work continued on the album until October 1996. Somebody’s Somebody, Courtin’ Time, The Plan and New World are the only songs known to have been recorded earlier. An album titled New World was compiled sometimes in 1995 and most of the songs were also at some point, considered for Emancipation. It is not entirely clear whether he viewed these two albums as entirely separate projects or simply saw these as two names for the same project; for clarity’s sake, information pertaining to Emancipation (including its early configurations) is listed here, and information regarding New World is listed on that album’s page.\n\nThree early configurations, from early 1995, July 1995, and an unknown date in 1995, are known, but all were single-disc sets and should be viewed as works-in-progress (see below for details). According to Michael B., the idea of ​​releasing a triple album emerged when Prince saw how double-album sales were counted by SoundScan with Michael Jackson’s album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I released in June 1995 (the sale of one 2-CD set being counted as two copies sold). On 20 September 1995 (a.m.), during a concert at Paisley Park Studios, Chanhassen, MN, Prince announced that Dallas Austin would co-produce his next album: \"It’s called Emancipation: 52 songs, 80 dollars. Save your money!\". Austin is not known to have worked with Prince in the studio, and the advertised number of songs (52) was probably humorous, but it indicates that the idea of ​​going further than a single-disc set was in development.\n\nThe album was largely a solo work, although it also contains tracks showing Prince’s transition from the 1993-5 version of The New Power Generation (with Michael B., Sonny T., Tommy Barbarella and Mr. Hayes) to the new 1996, version of the band (containing Kirk Johnson, Rhonda Smith, Kat Dyson, Mr. Hayes and Eric Leeds).\n\nThe album is also Prince’s first to include cover versions of others’ songs (indeed the first commercial single release, Betcha By Golly Wow!, was a cover version). He has occasionally included cover versions on albums since Emancipation. Each of the album’s three CDs contains 12 tracks and lasts exactly 60:00 - Prince mentioned in interviews that this was planned based on his studies of Egypt, \"the building of the pyramids and how the pyramids were related to the constellations. They were a message from the Egyptians about how civilization really started.\"\n\nPromotion\n\nThe album produced two commercially-released singles, Betcha By Golly Wow! and The Holy River. Eleven months prior to the album’s release, Slave was given out as a cassette single to concert goers at a Paisley Park Studios show.\n\nAdditionally, following the album’s release, Somebody’s Somebody, Face Down and Can’t Make U Love Me were available as promotional releases. EMI Records went bankrupt during the album’s promotional run, however, stalling all promotion for the album. Prince (as ) also independently released a live single, NYC, containing live versions of Jam Of The Year and Face Down.\n\nPrince (as ) toured extensively to promote the album on the Love 4 One Another Charities Tour and the Jam Of The Year World Tour, although the tours focuses largely on past hits, with only a few songs from Emancipation played regularly. Prince (as ) also made multiple television appearances and media interviews to support the album, and labeled it \"the album I was born to make\".\n\nThe album reached number 11 on The Billboard 200, and number 6 on the Billboard Top R&B Albums Chart. On 7 February 1997, the album was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA in the USA based on the number of discs sold (666,666 3-discs sets)."
