        "text": "“Writing about music is like dancing about architecture – it’s a really stupid thing to want to do.” (attributed to Elvis Costello)\n\nThis musical aside to my usual blogging subjects comes in two parts. The first is “perfect songs”. The second is my album collection.\n\nI made the editorial decision to make this a static post rather than a blog post that might get lost in the churn of a blog. Well, it’s my blog and I’ll cry if I want to. I am well aware this post is very far from a law blog (or blawg) post, so I think the decision to separate it out sort of makes sense.\n\nPart 1 – Perfect Songs\n\nA friend (you know who you are) and I have been known to ponder many important things over a pint, but no subject is more important than this. Forget Scottish independence or fitba, our three (or more) rounds of drinks topic of conversation is perfect songs. At the mention of the topic, there is a knowing intake of breath as we take-up the conversation (again) and rake over old subject matter or uncover new gems. What follows is my attempt to capture that bar room jury in a blog.\n\nHere is list of perfect songs, in no particular order*. My self-imposed rules are: one song per band; and only ten songs.\n\nTherapy? Screamager\n\nThe Levellers 15 Years\n\nFrank Turner Long Live the Queen\n\nThe Wildhearts Mazel Tov Cocktail\n\nRunrig Rocket to the Moon\n\nThe Killers Mr Brightside\n\nTerris Fabricated Lunacy\n\nPearl Jam Corduroy\n\nIdlewild Live in a Hiding Place\n\nColdplay The Scientist\n\nI could have probably included a track by the Manics, Blondie, Fleetwood Mac, REM, Deacon Blue, Nirvana, Springsteen, The Proclaimers, Radiohead, Dylan, The Undertones, U2, Queen or The Clash, but I suppose they have enough airplay. As perhaps do The Killers, Coldplay and Pearl Jam, so that shoots my argument, but there we go: those three bands penned songs that are just too bloody perfect, and I don’t even count myself as a fan of The Killers.\n\nOf my ten, three songs perhaps merit special explanation as they are a little obscure or arty**. Runrig’s music is not everyone’s cup of tea, but it means something to me. Rocket to the Moon is up there as one of the best nostalgic and cianalas*** inducing songs, so for that reason Runrig get parachuted into my ten, providing a bit of a foil to the English punk/folk of The Levellers. The Idlewild album track I have mentioned I used to listen to on repeat far too often. It is beautiful. As for Terris, I have never seen them and I know very little about them****, but Fabricated Lunacy is amazing. I am not sure how or when I heard it, but it blindsided me when I did.\n\nI apologise to Soul Asylum, Live, many great great Highland bagpipe players (yes, the double “great” is deliberate) and many others, but in my self-imposed top ten I can only include ten. I should note that I am well aware I have not included any classical music, nor even the great catchy songs that become football chants like Cwm Rhondda, Guantanamera or The Beach Boys’ Sloop John B, so feel free to ostracise me as a Philistine for those further omissions. In fact, it is all rather English, in language that is – even the Runrig track I chose does not feature any Gaelic, either in whole (like the relentless An Toll Dubh) or in part (like the lovely Skye). Otherwise, by all means castigate me about songs I have forgotten about or misguidedly overlooked.\n\nA final point about music journalism, which apparently Frank Zappa reviewed thus: “People who can’t write, preparing stories based on interviews with people who can’t talk, in order to amuse people who can’t read”. Mind you, he was speaking specifically about rock journalism, so I trust none of those points are true of this blog, its subject matter or its readers. I found that quote in the inlay to Mogwai Young Team. Ah, maybe I should have included a track by them too… Meanwhile, here is a link to Mogwai’s George Square Thatcher Death Party.\n\nAnd Gary (yes, you know who you are now), sorry for not including any Blink 182 or The Hold Steady.\n\n* Okay, there was a bit of an order. It would have felt wrong to not put Northern Irish noiseniks Therapy? anywhere other than the top of my list, and even though they have many more technically clever tracks than Screamager that track quite simply had to be top. If you know me or Therapy? you will understand.\n\n** “I love your friends, they’re all so arty…” Yes, perhaps I should have included some Franz Ferdinand as well, but “Take Me Out” would have been my choice, rather than the song that pretentiously goes on about arty friends.\n\n*** Cianalas is a Scots Gaelic word that I cannot quite translate. It roughly means homesickness or longing.\n\n**** Via YouTube comments, I have gleaned Terris’s former singer is now a university lecturer. Fitting.\n\nUpdate on 20 December 2012. Today I was listening to the self-titled album of The Stone Roses, and the inlay of the 2010 re-issue described I am the Resurrection as “8:13 of perfection”, whereas it is not even my favourite track on that album (as amazing as it undoubtedly is). That just shows how subjective and ridiculous my exercise here is. Sorry. In other news, I have amended one of the tracks above, swapping my Wildhearts track from the better known Just in Lust to the ridiculously catchy Mazel Tov Cocktail. I also now realise I have completely omitted Deckard What Reason and Counting Crows Murder of One. If I could make it a top dozen I would add them in.\n\nPart 2- Albums of the Day\n\nThis is my album collection, in text form. I tweeted about it from 12 December 2011 until 4 June 2013.\n\nWhy?\n\nThat is a very good question. Well, in late 2011, I sent the following epistle to the world via Twitter.\n\nMy recent flit has allowed me to once again sort my CDs. Alphabetically. (Sad, perhaps, but it’s the one part of my life that’s organised.) I now intend to tweet about each album as I listen to them in order, whether the internet wishes to know or not. Given my eclectic taste and inability to throw out/trade/donate CDs this could be an interesting, or dull, insight.\n\nThus started my #albumoftheday tweeting. But the problem with Twitter, you see, is you tweet something and it flies away into the ether. Unless, of course, you were to catalogue it somehow. Who would do that sort of thing? Well, me. 8,000 odd words later, you (and I) can now have a shifty at my CD collection, then my (very small) LP collection and lastly my tape collection collated over an 18 month period. Any CD acquisitions I made after I moved to more traditional formats are not included, in case anyone is wondering where the new Frank Turner or Ginger albums are.\n\nWho is actually going to read this?\n\nI have no idea. It is as much for my benefit as anyone else’s. But you might be inspired to listen to something on the back of this, so do let me know.\n\nHow does this “blog” work?\n\nBefore you read on, here is a quick explanation that you can take on board to allow you to make the informed decision that you definitely don’t want to read on.\n\nEach album gets at least one tweet. Some albums just get that quick acknowledgement, others get a wee explanation in the form of extra tweets, which I have italicised. There may be some logic to why some albums got more tweets, but I am not really sure.\n\nIt seems my chat is a bit repetitious at times – I will blame that on the constraints of the Twitter medium.\n\nIf anyone gets so far to read them, you will find editorial comments in [square brackets], thus.\n\nEnjoy!"
