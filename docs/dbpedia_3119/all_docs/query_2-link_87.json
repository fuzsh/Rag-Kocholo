        "text": "Have you been struck by the reality of Jesus lately? Have you noticed that the Kingdom of God is always preaching itself: that there can be the revelation, an encounter, as a seam of gold, glimpsed at first then bursting forth with marvelous connections, all the way back and all the way forward. When one is in this reality, this disclosure, one is dancing in the heart of God.\n\nEach year we pray about what gift we can send to thank our friends who support us financially. Last year it was the picture of the oak tree at Summerfield Farms, taken by an intensive retreatant and accompanied with a note describing his connection to the tree and his experience of Isaiah 61. This year, we are sending Oscar Romero’s book, The Scandal of Redemption, along with this Highway letter which includes the story of my discovering the book. My hope is that the connected stories in this letter alert us to a larger awareness of the Kingdom in our midst, transforming moments in time and urging us to stay the course of seeking, knocking, asking, listening, and celebrating. A way of prayer.\n\nEarly in January, I started my annual three-day solitude retreat at St. Francis Springs Prayer Center. I go there to reflect upon and write up the prior year and to listen for direction in the year now beginning. As I have reread the journal entries from these silent spaces, I sense there is the possibility of encountering a juncture, a moment, a connection that preaches the presence of God.\n\nIn a journal entry from an eight-day retreat at Eastern Point in 2016, I revisited a Scripture that my spiritual director had recommended for contemplation. The first verse is this: \"The word of the Lord came to me.” - Jeremiah 1:4. Then the liturgy in the Eucharist emerged: \"Just say the word, Lord, and my soul shall be healed\". These verses coalesced in prayer and then a third: “Man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.\" - Luke 4:4. Listening, I began to focus on the word \"word.\" Through what means will this revelation come? I re-read the verses given to me from Jeremiah.\n\nThe word of the Lord came to me saying. Before I formed you\n\nin the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart...\n\nJeremiah 1:4,5.\n\nThe word of the Lord came to me: \"What do you see Jeremiah?\"\n\n\"I see the branch of an almond tree,\" I replied. \"You have seen correctly\n\nfor I am watching for my word to be fulfilled.\" Jeremiah 1: 11,12.\n\nThe faculty of seeing is a major avenue in the Spirit for the word of the Lord to come.\n\nPaul prays for the Ephesians that the eyes of their heart would be opened. Ephesians\n\n18a. And from the devotional Give Us This Day on January 3rd, I read:\n\nTo see clearly comes to those with a deep prayer life and openness\n\nto God's presence in our midst.\n\nI am reminded that the word of the Lord may come to me as I listen and read and\n\nit may also come to me through seeing something I need to receive: the adventure of solitude and prayer.\n\nI stay in the Oscar Romero cottage or Hermitage at St. Francis Springs. Romero was a Roman Catholic archbishop in El Salvador (1917 to 1980) during a time of great oppression and violence. Speaking boldly from the pulpit to the people but also to the government officials, soldiers, and to those in violent opposition. He was assassinated while preparing the Eucharist in the Carmelite Chapel of the Divine Providence hospital where he lived.\n\nI stay in that cottage in honor of my two grandchildren of Salvadoran blood and of their grandfather, Rosalie Rivera, a full-blooded Salvadoran who laid all the beautiful and extensive stonework at St. Francis Springs. Recently, he set in place a columbarium which I could see through the window from my chair. What did I see? The place where I want my ashes to be placed. It was quite extraordinary and unexpected to sit in that space.\n\nJanuary 4, afternoon, I walked over to a bookcase. My eyes immediately focused on a brightly covered paperback with a man's facial image, The Scandal of Redemption, by Oscar Romero. Whether it had been there on other visits I do not know. It is a collection of sermons by Romero delivered in the teeth of the violence. The word came to me, and I sat down to read a portion but ended up transfixed by it and read it right through. It stunned me that this priest poured out the reality of Christ, the life of following Christ, and the place of the Church in the midst of that time. He powerfully expressed to the government, the opposition, and the people caught in the trap, the third way of Jesus. Not under the banner of liberation theology but under the banner of Christ. I knew immediately that we needed to gift this book to our support team in the midst of our times. It was that fresh and powerful and cost him his life. It is all Christ. And the word came to me. What a gift.\n\nI had planned to go to the National Prayer Breakfast in early February but was derailed by complications from hip surgery. The morning of the breakfast I stayed in bed to watch it unfold before an attentive crowd of Senators and Representatives and the President. The intimacy of the statuary room at the Capitol was the venue. Over at the Washington Hilton, hundreds gathered in support and prayer. That is where I would have been. I later found out that they only saw a portion of the morning which did not include the main speaker.\n\nThe President and the Speaker of the House were seated next to each other on the front row. Andrea Bocelli brought the music. Tracey Mann, one of the friends over the years, now a Republican Congressman too, co-hosted the time with a Democrat colleague. Chaplain Black, the Chaplain of the Senate, gave the main address. An African American, a retired Admiral from the Navy, and Chaplain of the Senate for over twenty years, he brought his sonorous voice to the podium. Like with Romero, the word of the Lord came to me as Chaplain Black spoke and went out from there after cascading over the leadership of the United States. With power, humor, personal story, and marvelous grasp of the Scriptures, he laid out the third way of Jesus, calling for the discipline of fasting and prayer throughout the world. Calling the leaders, the people (me), to weekly fasting and prayer. I was so excited I started calling everyone. It is available on YouTube here. (Cue to minute 30.) It was the most timely and impactful address that I have heard at the NPB over many, many years. These two men of the cloth are bringing it in the here and now and I felt God had set me aside, in solitude, to receive it.\n\nGod was not finished stringing these pearls for me, all the way back and all the way forward. I will close with this story so clearly connected in the Spirit to the other two. Our friend, Peter Radtke came to Greensboro on a business matter and later joined Todd Lipe and me on my porch to fellowship and share a cigar. I knew Peter had been to the NPB. I asked what he thought of Chaplain Black's message which he had been able to watch. Peter replied: \"I was getting chill bumps.\" He proceeded to tell us that two years ago he was prompted to try to contact Ukrainian President Zelensky to call his people to prayer in response to the overwhelming force attacking and killing the people. Peter did not know a path for making contact, so he enlisted Tony Hall, a former Congressman and ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture. Tony is well known for engaging a fast in response to critical issues. Peter drafted a letter for Tony to sign. The letter referred to the same Scriptures Chaplain Black explicated and communicated the same message to a leader. By now, Peter was close to tears and the presence of the Lord thick upon the porch. We immediately got up and celebrated the Eucharist. We prayed that whether or not the letter got through, these messages would encourage Peter and Tony to continue the effort and that other strategic people would join in.\n\nFolks, I will never know how many people will read Romero's sermons, watch Chaplain Black's message, or even work their way through this lengthy letter. But I do know this: God is pouring out streams in the desert, manifesting and proclaiming the ways of the kingdom and letting us in on it. When we turn aside to the burning bush and take off our shoes in awe, we acknowledge his work is \"continuous in time\" and stand in the\n\nrushing river of sacramental reality, not deferred but now.\n\nBlessings,\n\nTrip and Laurie\n\nThe wind blows where it chooses, and you\n\nhear the sound of it, but you do not know\n\nwhere it comes from or where it is goes. So\n\nit is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\n\n-- John 3:8.\n\nNicodemus knew reality in one dimension only, the dimension of the mind, of experience, of the way things work, and the law. In that dimension, one plus one always equals two. The dimension of the Spirit is another Reality. I am hoping in this letter to communicate something very precious to me that is difficult to articulate and that is of the two realities intersecting in a moment of an ordinary day. I hope it will be meaningful in waking us up to moments that otherwise pass by, undetected.\n\nI am going to begin by sharing a recent personal experience, although honestly there have been many of these over the years whereby grace, I became more attentive and more aware. It has been one of the great delights of my journey in Christ on this Highway.\n\nMy son Julian and I recently completed a 33-day examination of Joseph, the earth dad of Jesus and husband of Mary, his mother. The study, also called a consecration, included a litany of prayers and consideration of the character and qualities of Joseph venerated by the Church. Every morning, Julian would come to our home, and we would sit side by side at the table in communal exploration and prayer. This discipline mightily encouraged us in our roles as husbands, father/son, Julian's future role as father, and my current one as father also to Julian's four sisters and grandfather to nine grandchildren so far. This time also powerfully emphasized how Julian has drawn fully into Christ during the last two years in answer to years of prayers by Laurie and me and God's love. It is a gift beyond measure.\n\nOne morning, as we sat side by side, we needed to refer directly to Scripture. Julian spotted one of those huge family bibles lying flat on the bookcase shelf in our new home. Laurie had evidently brought it over and placed it there. I had not noticed it or, if I did, I did not open it. Julian brought it over and we looked at the inscription. To my utter shock and amazement, it was inscribed by my dad and dedicated to Laurie and me just before our wedding in 1979. I had no memory of ever seeing it. It read: \"Laurie and Trip (Frank III), if you always live by this Book your problems will be as air bubbles.\" Signed Frank J. Sizemore, Jr. Julian and I sat there staring at the page and then at each other. Frank Julian Sizemore III and Frank Julian Sizemore IV being joined and blessed by Frank Julian Sizemore Jr. In the moment and in the midst of a focus on Joseph. Joined also by our Father in heaven by this unmistakable act of revelation. It was enchanting, mystical, and real. We felt the generations, committed to Christ and Scripture, being affirmed by God.\n\nIn his book, A SEVERE MERCY, a publication of an exchange of letters with C.S. Lewis concerning the grief over the loss of his wife, Sheldon Vanauken comments on the eternal significance and intervention of the moment Julian and I experienced:\n\nIf an event coming about in the ordinary course of nature\n\nbecomes to me the occasion of hope and faith and love\n\nor increased efforts after virtue, do we suppose that this\n\nresult was unforeseen by, or is indifferent to, God. Obviously\n\nnot. What we should have called its fortuitous effects must\n\nhave been present to Him for all eternity. (p. 377).\n\nThe Scriptures and poets speak of these encounters and how we might respond as we grow in the awareness of their happening. Thus, in Exodus 3 there is this presentation concerning Moses:\n\nThere the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of\n\nfire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush\n\nwas on fire it did not burn up. So Moses thought, \" I will\n\ngo over and see this strange sight-- why the bush does\n\nnot burn up.\"\n\nGod says to him, \"Do not come any closer. Take off your\n\nshoes, for the place where you are standing is holy ground...\n\nIn his Lenten devotional, THE WORD IN THE WILDERNESS, the poet and priest, Malcolm Guite publishes the poem on first Sunday, The Bright Field, by R.S. Thomas:\n\nI have seen the sun break through\n\nto illuminate a small field\n\nfor awhile, and gone my way\n\nand forgotten it. But that was the\n\npearl of great price, the one field that had\n\ntreasure in it. I realize now\n\nthat I must give all I have\n\nto possess it. Life is not hurrying\n\non to a receding future, not hankering after\n\nan imagined past. It is the turning\n\naside like Moses to the miracle\n\nof the lit bush. To a brightness\n\nthat seemed as transitory as your youth\n\nonce, but is the eternity that awaits you.\n\nIn his commentary, Guite turns to another poet who emphasizes the multiples that are possible in awareness. He writes and ends with three verses from the poem:\n\nElizabeth Barrett Browning in her long poem AURORA LEIGH\n\nalso brings us to such a moment; indeed she takes it further\n\nsuggesting that these glimpses of glory are not just a wistful\n\none-off in an otherwise empty desert but are richly available\n\nto us always and everywhere, if we have eyes to see and time\n\nto stop.\n\nEarth's crammed with heaven,\n\nAnd every common bush afire with God,\n\nBut only he who sees, takes off his shoes.\n\nThen, in the book AWE, the author refers to such moments and recognition as \"Everyday Epiphanies\". Marvelous. Everyday Epiphanies, Glimpses of Glory, Fire-Bushes richly available to us \"always and everywhere\". YES.\n\nBack to my dad and his re-entry. With this gentle giant of a man a memory pops up as I write, a picture in the present from the past. Remembrance bringing the image into the moment just as Jesus invites us to remember him in the Eucharist. My brother, Don, and I sitting on either side of my dad, in rockers, smoking cigars on the porch of our cabin in the midst of a retreat of several hundred men brought together in the Spirit of Jesus. We did this year after year and it continues, now with Don and I and our sons.\n\nLet's be awake, turn aside and take off our shoes, acknowledging the God who is the Eternal Now.\n\nBlessings, trip and laurie\n\nHe went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue as was his custom. - Luke 4:16\n\nI have been thinking about \"church\" quite often lately which surprisingly has connected me to my own church journey. I grew up in the South where church, famously, was part of the culture. Churches, by far most of them in the Protestant tradition, were on every corner it seemed with church steeples creating a forest if one were to look up.\n\nMy family attended Wesley Memorial Church in downtown High Point, North Carolina where I was baptized as an infant. The building was clothed in red brick, aged to a darker hue as I recall. I loved the stained-glass windows. After church we would sometimes go to the Chinese restaurant down the street where my grandfather introduced me to egg-rolls. I have been an addict ever since.\n\nEarly on I was also exposed to the Episcopal tradition, the church of my mother’s youth in Rochester, NY. She enrolled me in the choir of the local Episcopal church, St. Mary's, where a great aunt on my dad's side was the choir director. She was Moravian. I wore a black choir robe frock and a white blouse to sing. One Sunday, most of the choir headed to the communion rail for the weekly celebration of the Eucharist and I jumped in line to kneel at the rail. The priest, Dr. Price, noticed me and came over to ask if I had been confirmed in the church, knowing I was well below the age. I shook my head \"No\", not knowing what that meant. I do not know if I received a substitute blessing. That experience, I believe, was the beginning of a romance with the sacrament which remained hidden for years but became a singular passion in response to the actuality of Jesus' simple words and actions: This is my body broken for you. Eat this. This is my blood shed for you. Drink this. And I love the freedom and invitation in his \"as often as you will.\"\n\nI experienced Sunday school, Scouts, and youth group at Wesley Memorial. Eventually, a new church facility was erected farther out from downtown, not far from the country club. Huge, cathedral-like, and very beautiful if not somewhat imposing, we called it the Vatican. I learned the great hymns there and earned my God and Country award and Eagle rank in Scouts. My dad was an Eagle and now I was as well, all through the church. When my dad died, the enormous sanctuary was filled to overflowing.\n\nFor two summers in high school, I was a lifeguard at a mountain retreat property owned by the Methodist Church of North Carolina. Many pastors and church members summered there, enjoying the mountains and the lake in the center of the property, Lake Junaluska. Every Sunday I worshiped in the great assembly hall and then dashed off to rock hop the mountain streams with my friends. I celebrated my 16th birthday there, discovered youthful romance and great friendships. In addition, Duke University, my alma mater for both undergraduate and law, has had a long association with the Methodist Church. There is a famous and very beautiful Gothic cathedral in the center of the campus, the Duke Chapel. The divinity school is next door. Periodically I would attend service at the Chapel as an undergrad and hardly ever as a law student. Over the years since then, we have loved the presentation of the Messiah which we have attended many times in the Chapel.\n\nIn the summer before my third year of law school, I married a Duke coed whom I had dated through college. She was Catholic so we were married in a Catholic church in her hometown of Yardley, Pennsylvania. I asked a Methodist pastor, a family friend, to join in the ceremony. We did not go to church during eight years of marriage or pursue a relationship with Jesus. We were busy professionals in Washington DC. The marriage ended, childless, in divorce.\n\nI returned to North Carolina, joining a large law firm in Greensboro. It seemed everyone in Greensboro went to church. Several of my colleagues’ families attended First Presbyterian Church, so I went there. It was a good and spacious place for re-entry. Over the course of that first year, I kept bumping into folks who liked Jesus and they kept bumping into me. The brokenness in my life began to open my heart. One night, alone in my condo, I wept all night. Jesus met me there. When the sun came up, there was a different quality to the light. I knew it.\n\nAlmost a year later, I married Laurie in First Presbyterian Church, her family church. Our first three children were dedicated there, and we were part of a vibrant, adult Sunday school class. We bought a home across from the church. During this season, we were introduced to several streams of evangelical outreach and para-church organizations which connected us relationally to many friends and began our grounding in the Scriptures. We began hosting a gathering of friends in our home for worship, fellowship and prayer. This eventually evolved into the formation of Grace Community Church, our home church for 30 years.\n\nSix years ago, my journey took me to a Catholic parish. There were many encounters along the way that led me there. It is a place of rest for me, a place each Sunday to receive after giving out so much to others, and a place of community worship dynamic in sacramental reality. The blessing of the parish school to our three grandchildren who live with us, to us and to their mom, has been profound. The Boy Scout troop is dynamic and led by men and women who are as trustworthy and committed as they come. My grandson is hopefully on his way to Eagle. Coaches of the athletic teams are exemplary and encouraging. The church, pastor and staff have remarkable vision and leadership. I am grateful.\n\nAs I was finishing these reflections, I came across a commentary on Jesus' instructions to his followers as he is ascending. He instructs them to return to the city, Jerusalem, and wait. Fr. Rolheiser comments:\n\nThe Upper Room is not glamorous, not a Leonardo da Vinci painting. It always looks like the meeting in your local church. But it is there that Pentecost happened and will continue to happen. And so Jesus' advice to today's struggling believer is still the same as it was to a group of uncertain and shaky disciples at the time of his Ascension: return to the city and wait in the Upper Room. Or, as Peter Maurin put it: 'When you don't know what else to do, keep going to meetings because Pentecost happened at a meeting.' (Sacred Fire, p. 133)\n\nAnd we correspondingly add this exhortation from Scripture:\n\nAnd let us consider how we may spur one another on to love and good deeds, not giving up meeting\n\ntogether, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see\n\nthe Day approaching. - Hebrews 10:24, 25\n\nThroughout our year, there are many gatherings that we are part of apart from the Sabbath but connected in the Spirit… These are meetings that the Spirit visits in powerful ways year after year. Every Wednesday morning six of us men meet as a small group which has been together for fellowship, friendship, prayer, and Scripture for 30 years. Directed solitude retreats with other pilgrims seeking the discipline of silence are a staple in our spiritual journey. The Windy Gap Men's Retreat gathers over 300 men from throughout the Southeast in the spirit of Jesus. Marvelous and transformational encounters, amid vigorous worship, occur every year, now for over 40 years. Our Verbena gatherings bring the anointing each time as we meet annually with our intercessor team and annually also in a larger group called a Verbena Gathering in alternating cities each year.\n\nIn these Upper Rooms we experience community as a devotional body, in the unity and celebration of the kingdom, happening now. We celebrate the Eucharist. Something like this is at work we hope:\n\nAnd they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. - Acts 2:42\n\nThis past Sunday, I went to church. We sang a particular hymn which reminded me that it is the Lord who gathers us and so we pray in song:\n\nGather your people, O Lord; Gather your people,\n\nO Lord. One bread, one body, one spirit of love.\n\nGather your people, O Lord.\n\nDraw us forth to the table of life, brothers and sisters,\n\neach of us called to walk in your light.\n\nGather your people, O Lord; Gather your people, O\n\nLord. One bread, one body, one spirit of love. Gather\n\nyour people, O Lord.\n\nWe are parts of the body of Christ, needing each other,\n\neach of the gifts the Spirit provides. Gather your people,\n\nGather your people, O Lord. One bread, one body, one\n\nspirit of love. Gather your people, O Lord.\n\nBlessings, trip and laurie\n\nI have been re-collecting myself frequently these days: a lost phone, a credit card left at a restaurant, another ball in the lake on hole 13. Memories too are flooding back from childhood on up. Recollections.\n\nMy encounter with the Psalms this past summer seems somehow to fit right in, presenting the recollections of God’s people in a contemporaneous, poetic, and often raw account of their experiences chronicled in the preceding history books. The Psalms have been aptly referred to as the internal account of those external circumstances.\n\nThis Reflection is also somewhat embarrassing. I have written before about my delight in discovering Malcolm Guite, the English priest, and poet. By following him, I found out that he was teaching a five-day seminar on the Psalms through Regent College over zoom. Through this course, I became truly embarrassed, even stunned, by my lack of engagement with the Psalter as a body of songs, poems, and prayer. I also realized that so many of the giants in all Christian faith traditions singled out the Psalms as central to their prayer life. From the Benedictine monasteries to the halls of Oxford and Cambridge, to Bono and to Regent College, these songs have lit up spiritual life. I found that Augustine, Brueggeman, Aquinas, NT Wright, Eugene Petersen, and many others had penned impassioned commentaries on the Psalms.\n\nIt is not that I had no familiarity with them over the years. I once visited a monastery where the Psalms were chanted. I knew several from memory but the magnitude of their witness and path for prayer did not penetrate. The Guite course convicted me that if I would accept this intersection with the Psalms in their entirety as a leading from God, even this late in life, my prayer life, and my connection with God would be energized in a new way... I realized too the weakness and inconsistency of my own prayers and how separated they were from my own struggles and those across the world. And so, it came to me: Why not pray them as my prayers, chant them, join Christ in them: do something to engage this path now set before me.\n\nGuite introduced me to three additional resources outside the Scriptures: C.S. Lewis' REFLECTIONS on the PSALMS, David Taylor's OPEN and UNAFRAID (my favorite), and DAVID'S CROWN, Malcolm Guite's response in poetry to each one of the Psalms. Then, I recollected: Two years before on an 8-day retreat I had taken Eugene Petersen's book on the Psalms of Ascent, A LONG OBEDIENCE in the SAME DIRECTION, as a guide for the time. On my shelf, I had Reardon's CHRIST in the PSALMS which I had picked up at a Leanne Payne conference years before and never read. On my shelf also, I had a well-worn copy of Kathleen Norris' book, THE CLOISTER WALK, which I keep returning to without knowing exactly why. Maybe it is because she says things like this:\n\n“I regard monks and poets as the best degenerates in America.\n\nBoth have a finely developed sense of the sacred potential in\n\nall things; both value image and symbol over utilitarian purpose or\n\nthe bottom line; they recognize the transformative power hiding in\n\nthe simplest things, and it leads them to commit absurd acts: the\n\npoem! the prayer! what nonsense!” (p.146).\n\nIn the midst of all this reflection, my brother sent me Cynthia Berguault's more recent book, CHANTING the PSALMS, complete with a disc to help with learning to chant. The book is a marvelous testimony to the transformative power of the Psalms in the inner life and their lasting connection to the contemplative way in the Church over centuries.\n\nConfronted thus during the two and a half months after the course, I could either change my ways or consider it a passing interest. This question lingers: Can I devote myself to praying the Psalms? The word \"devotion\" has stuck with me ever since I read ACTS 2:42. “And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.” Pray for me.\n\nI would also invite you, my friends, into this singular focus with me because the Psalms are also communal, a peoples' authentic expression to their God. As an example, in the Psalms of Lament, there is a disconcerting and spacious ground for the expression of sadness, pain, anger, hostility, fear, and despair. Emotions and feelings we often suppress and ignore to the detriment of our own mental and physical health as well as community health. These Psalms also testify repeatedly to the goodness, lovingkindness, and steadfastness of God. Taylor comments:\n\n“These words [concerning God's goodness] need to find\n\nthemselves on our lips and said out loud, again and\n\nagain, in the company of others with whom we can\n\nshare our pain so they can work their healing power\n\non us. They heal us by offering us an opportunity to\n\nbecome whole, rather than leaving us fractured by our\n\nlosses and disoriented in our sadness. They heal us\n\nby offering us hope in the form of words that name\n\nrealities, helping us to make sense of often senseless things.\n\nAnd they heal us by bringing us face to face with a God\n\nwho is compassionate and gracious, abounding in love,\n\nfaithful to the end. (Ps. 86:15).”\n\nThe Psalms give expression to this and so much more and I hope in praying them they will touch in me, by the Spirit, those groans within me, my friends, the Church, and the world. Again, please pray for me. Your prayer could be Psalm 1:\n\nBlessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked.\n\nnor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;\n\nbut his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he\n\nmeditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water\n\nthat yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not whither. In all\n\nthat he does, he prospers.\n\nThe wicked are not so, but are like chaff which the wind drives away.\n\nTherefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the\n\ncongregation of the righteous; for the Lord knows the way of the\n\nrighteous but the way of the wicked will perish. (RSV).\n\nIn closing, I share with you the beautiful, imaginative response by Guite. Enjoy:\n\nPsalm 1: I Beatus vir qui non abit\n\nCome to the place where every breath is praise,\n\nAnd God is breathing through each passing breeze.\n\nBe planted by the waterside and raise\n\nYour arms with Christ beneath these rooted trees,\n\nWho lift their breathing leaves up to the skies.\n\nBe rooted too, as still and strong as these,\n\nOpen alike to sun and rain. Arise\n\nFrom meditation by these waters. Bear\n\nThe fruit of that deep rootedness. Be wise\n\nIn the trees’ long wisdom. Learn to share\n\nThe secret of their patience. Pass the day\n\nIn their green fastness and their quiet air.\n\nSlowly discern a life, a truth, a way,\n\nWhere simple being flowers in delight.\n\nThen let the chaff of life just blow away.\n\nBlessings to each of you.\n\nTrip and Laurie\n\nNow may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.\n\nHebrews 13:20-21\n\nTruly free people are operating in God-consciousness all the time. Hearing his voice and following him into the moments and connections of life. The deception and disobedience of the Fall plunged man and woman, the prize of God's creation, into self-consciousness where greed, individuality, self-protection, self-love (as well as self-hatred), and deception constructed an alternative reality to the divine Reality of God's presence and goodness. It supplanted God's love - that God is love - with all manner of substitutes, unleashing destructiveness in every sphere of life, including calling what is evil, good.\n\nIn following Jesus, ransomed by his blood alone and raised in his life, we are led into a great spaciousness of transformation to live out the incarnated life of Christ in us. Our minds, bodies, souls, and spirits are directed and empowered by the Holy Spirit to be instruments of God's love, working in his Vision, his Reality, which is the kingdom of heaven.\n\nIn his beautiful book, “Beyond Loneliness, the Gift of God's Friendship,” Trevor Hudson describes the God vision this way:\n\n“From the beginning of his public ministry, Jesus' life and message revolve totally around God's dream for the world. In language familiar to first-century Jews, Jesus calls this dream \"The Kingdom of God\". God's kingdom is where God rules and reigns, where God's will is done, and where what God wants to happen happens. (Emphasis mine). Wherever Jesus goes, he makes that dream a reality. He lives out God's dream and calls every man, woman and child to join him.” (p.64)\n\nI think that is a beautiful expression of the life of Jesus. Working in God's dream is no isolated task, in fact it is no task at all. To be real in the midst of hostility, oppression, brutality, control, and madness, Jesus built and is building a community, his body in Christ, of which he is the\n\nhead. To Hudson, the heart of this community is God's desire “to be friends with his people and for us to be friends with each other.” Hudson quotes William A. Barry, SJ, a powerful voice in the sphere of spiritual direction, enlarging that thought:\n\n“God wants a world where we human beings live in harmony and friendship with God, with one another, and with the rest of creation, co-operating with God wherever we are.”\n\nWe see in the opening benediction from Hebrews that the absolute substitutionary work of God miraculously transforms our lives into:\n\nWhat is pleasing to Him.\n\nAnd Paul is ever preaching, as the writer of Hebrews does in this passage, that there is no peace and no resurrection life apart from the blood of Jesus. The blood is the narrow way that reopens friendship with God and is the passage through which each must pass to know the reality of the incarnational life of Christ and to live according to the Spirit. Sadly, I meet so many who are separated from the sacramental reality of the blood and only know it conceptually. In the flow of that blood, all the destructiveness, falseness, and shame are washed away, and we are newly created in Christ. We have a new Father, a new family, and a new bloodline in the genetics of Jesus. A whole new inheritance. The cataclysmic act of friendship, laying down his life, is the gift of God's friendship and an ongoing invitation into that reality.\n\nThe subject of friendship has confronted me in several different contexts and sources lately, so I am paying attention. My small men's group of over thirty years worked through Trevor Hudson’s book in our weekly meetings with remarkable results in intimacy and vulnerability; in the practical ways we discovered to help each other; in the attentive ways, we learned to listen to each other without the immediate need to move on to something else. We also found ourselves stopping in the moment to pray and bless the visible work of God in each other. None of these things were entirely new or unpracticed but the focus on Jesus' desire for friendship, and the calling to enter more deeply into God's Dream truly brought special clarity, direction, and depth.\n\nGod also prompted me to consider his friendship during a weekly zoom call with Jim Houston of Regent College, a 98-year-old follower of Jesus. The call is hosted by friends in other states and started this month. The whole topic is friendship with delightful stories by Jim, and commentary, and then group interaction. Another beautiful way this is of others cooperating with God, inviting me to pause and saying, \"Ok, we are going deeper into this friendship thing now.\"\n\nAnd where does Jesus emphasize the call to friendship more fully and plainly than in John 17? Although the shed blood of Jesus is offered to the whole world, it is his followers, the ones God has given him that he prays for before suffering the Cross. It is to these he has the power to give eternal life and intimacy with God the Father and God the Son. It is for these and through them, we come to know by their message. He prays each one would come to know the union that he and his Father have, and it is out of that vertical oneness that we can be one with each other horizontally. A community complete in love and unity which preaches the gospel, Jesus, to the world.\n\nIn closing, I am leaving you with my favorite poem on friendship with Christ and others. All our human friends pass on, most surely through death but also through distance, sometimes even distancing themselves. Loss. But the poem reminds us that Jesus, the Christ, is their “first, fast and last friend.” Ours too in their presence and absence and in our death. Poets say it best, I think.\n\nThe Lantern Out of Doors\n\nSometimes the lantern moves along the night\n\nThat interests our eyes. And who goes there?\n\nI think, wherefrom and bound, I wonder, where,\n\nWith all down darkness wide, his wading light.\n\nMen go by me whom either beauty bright\n\nIn mold or mind or what not else makes rare:\n\nThey rain against our much-thick and marsh air\n\nRich beams, till death or distance buys them quite.\n\nDeath or distance soon consumes them: wind\n\nWhat most I may eye after, be in at the end\n\nI cannot, and out of sight is out of mind.\n\nChrist minds: Christ's interest, what to avow or amend\n\nThere eyes them, heart wants, care haunts, foot follows kind,\n\nTheir ransom, their rescue, and first, fast last friend.\n\nGerard Manly Hopkins\n\nI hope and pray that you have the rich beams of friends in your life, all found and kept in Christ.\n\nI call you friends. -- Jesus\n\nBlessings,\n\nTrip and Laurie\n\nI am writing this letter on January 6, the day of Epiphany, the epiphany being that the light came into the world and that the bread of life (Bethlehem meaning \"house of bread') is for all people. The three wise-men, representative of the Gentile nations, receive the inclusive message of salvation. Led by the star, they bring gifts honoring the baby as king, prophet, and priest, including the burial preparation gift of myrrh, foreshadowing that he came in birth to die. What a time to revisit, by the Spirit, this dramatic encounter.\n\nMEANING IN RETREAT AND DAILY\n\nI am on a three-day retreat at St. Francis Springs Prayer Center, which I try to schedule at the beginning of each year. The protected and intentional separation allows me space to inventory the challenges, blessings, and insights from the past year as well as space to assess my journey in Christ. Also, the time is fruitful for listening, praying, and discerning the year ahead. Thus, the retreat time is also a bridge between two years, a transition.\n\nEach year there also seems to be a special gift in the timing of the retreat. Last year the retreat fell on the final days of Father Louie's 15-year tenure as the Center’s director, visionary and spiritual energizer. His departure was news to me when I arrived. Louie and I became friends over the years, so it was a delight for me to be able to share meals and conversations as he closed his tenure. In fact, some years back, the Verbena intercessor team met here for a weekend, and the team, to a person, was struck by the realness, openness, and hospitality of Father Louie, one uniform expression being that, \"He is more comfortable in his own skin than anyone I have ever met.\" Father Louie, a Franciscan priest, has that effect on everyone.\n\nSo, what a delight and surprise, tinged with sadness and uncertainty. I felt God's favor in being a witness to the closing celebration of Mass with all the volunteer partners gathered to honor Christ and Father Louie. It was a joyful celebration in song, worship, and liturgy. Louie delivered a precious homily which I recorded. The Eucharist elements were handed to each one by Father Louie as tears flooded his face. Later, so characteristic of him, he referred to allergies that had caused his eyes to water. There was just no coincidence that I was there. The recognition of that gift flooded back to me at the beginning of this current retreat.\n\nMy experience then is that meaning and timing line up in retreat in special ways that are gifts to me to recognize. I am finding that even in daily, outside retreat, there are gifts to receive if I am present and stand in the flow of the supernaturally arranged and intimate connection of the dots. Today, this retreat lines up with Epiphany. I want to be one with it, present to it \"as the past returns to the present\".\n\nSACRAMENTAL VISION OF REALITY\n\n\"Expectant\" seems to be the word. From the beginning of Advent through today I have been flooded with resources bringing meaning each day. Our Christmas tree: I love Christmas trees. This Christmas ours was particularly tall, wide, and beautifully shaped. It was decorated lovingly by Laurie, Mary Grace, and our grandchildren. Each morning I turned it on, sat in my nearby chair, and gazed up and down the tree: this ornament, that one, the star and the angel at the top with the spectacular green branches extending in all directions.\n\nA dear friend gave me Michael Guite’s Advent devotional, Waiting on the Word. It just showed up and I could not have felt more seen, more understood in the creativity of this devotional format. Each commentary for the day is preceded by a poem. The commentary explicates the poem and the connection to the artist's story and to sacred reality. The discovery of Malcolm Guite, his scholarship, his literary mind, and his stewardship of sacred thought, was a gift I was unwrapping every day.\n\nIn addition, a week or so before Christmas, the Wall Street Journal published an essay entitled \"Finding the Sacred in the Delights of Christmas\" by James Matthew Wilson, again an author unknown to me till then. Like Guite, he brings forth the reality within the reality. It is an amazing article which I cannot do justice to here. I hope you will read it and also take in the most amazing color reproductions. Referring to the liturgical calendar marking Advent and Epiphany and ordering the year in meaning for believers, he notes:\n\nBy observing a fixed calendar, our private emotions become\n\nan occasion for genuine communion with others, with the\n\nwhole cosmos and with the divine. What grounds that communion\n\nis more than personal sentiment. For believers, Christmas makes\n\nclaim about how things are, asking us to think about reality in a\n\ndifferent way.\n\nThe main point, which I believe many begin to grasp through an intensive, even as I keep grasping it, is this:\n\nFor Christians, this is the mystery of the incarnation...\n\nThe particular no longer stands in opposition to the universal;\n\nrather the particular bears the universal within itself. Christians\n\ncall this paradox the sacramental vision of reality, and it means\n\nthat everything, even the smallest thing, is shot through with a\n\nsignificance that should awe us.\n\nTETHERED\n\nLet me attempt to illustrate this reality of sacramental vision through an experience in prayer with the Board of Verbena. In reporting her experience in prayer, Mary Katherine Peters said that she saw a giant, multi-colored hot air balloon, which was tethered to stakes in the ground, pulling free from the tethers and rising. A few days after returning home, she spotted an actual multi-colored hot air balloon rising over her home. She filmed it and sent it to us. Wow. Coincidence? Arrangement? What message and to whom? Mary Katherine, the Peters, Charlottesville, Verbena, the Church, the country? Maybe all of the above and more as we keep pondering it in our hearts, as Mary did with the mysteries unfolding to her.\n\nFrom these communications, the word \"tether\" stuck with me, and I began to encounter the word in paradox. \"Holding back\", \"holding down\", \"restraining\", these were the images or synonyms I identified with. But then, from Wilson:\n\n\"Faith isn't about personal sentiments that come and go. Rather feelings are tethered to a reality that stands outside ourselves.\"\n\nIn addition, the word appears in the Reflection by Kathy Hendricks from \"Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread\" this very day of Epiphany, January 6. The title in fact is \"Tethered to Love\". In examining the path out of fear, a restraining and debilitating \"tether\" if you will, she says this: \"When we remain in God, we tether ourselves to love that will carry us through any storm.\" Tethered to and in Christ, we are untethered from fear, anxiety, deception, and the false self. We are pulled up, tethered to Reality, soaring in the brilliant colors of our true self in communion with the whole body of Christ and that great cloud of witnesses. Community.\n\nEXPECTANT\n\nExpectant in this day. Yes. Expectant in this year. Yes. Expectant that God keeps all his promises in an arrangement and timing of his own making. Yes. Just as the star stood over Bethlehem; just as the body and blood, the bread of life, is ours today. Expectant because on this day of my departure, January 7, the gospel account is from Luke 4 as Jesus announces his ministry in the fulfillment of Isaiah 61, both texts central to the teaching and transformation in an intensive. My takeaway from this convergence is a strong, direct, and personal affirmation to continue on, in the ministry of healing and discipleship through prayer, one person at a time.\n\nFinally, I am expectant that He is returning, as promised and arranged, in the fullness of time.\n\nHappy New Year,\n\nTrip and Laurie\n\nSometimes, as at this time, things coalesce and become very clear. As disciples of Jesus, the kingdom of God in our midst should be our focus, as the body of Christ -The Church- concerned in every way and circumstance with the kingdom of Heaven. For years now I have been growing in my awareness of the depth and reality of the Eucharist and also the way it may have been trivialized over time along with the Cross. For me the Eucharist is an intense and kingdom response to the world, to violence, to the broken relationships of humanity and all other crises and causes which elevate the world's crises and turn our responses to the ways of the world, no matter how sincere these responses may be. This subverts the reality of the Cross as the redemptive path in every case: “[For he] has reconciled all things to himself ...by making peace through his blood shed on the Cross.” Col. 1:20. No blood, no peace. This may not satisfy those who howl for final solutions of all manner of things but to followers of Jesus, it must be the present and final word on all the unreconciled places in humanity, individual and collective and to all cruelty. Indeed, in the alternative, we are speaking of sacramental reality in the midst of a broken and fallen world. As Chambers intones concerning incarnational reality through us and, in this case, in and through the sacrament: “broken bread and poured out wine.”\n\nAs the deeper reality, meaning and celebration of the Eucharist came clear to me as a powerful response and resistance to the way of the world in crisis, God brought me affirmation, I am sure through the words and convictions of several giants in the faith, saying the same thing but better and giving articulate and depth of meaning to what I engaged so deeply in my heart as the Church's unified response to the ‘what are we going to do’ questions. In the remainder of this letter I will share what two of these saints have to say. You will have to read their referenced books to get the expansion on their thinking but the quotes provided from the prefaces are indeed powerful in this offer of an alternative resistance and redemptive path.\n\nAlexander Schmemann died in 1983 after a marvelous life of pastoring, teaching and writing in the Orthodox and liturgical tradition. His book, The Eucharist, is unmatched in depth on our subject. The leaflet promo says this: “Man was created for unity, for faith, for offering and sacrifice, for love, for thanksgiving and worship, and, above all, for the kingdom, for communion with his Creator. All this the eucharist tells us, and the purpose of this book is to help us hear it.”\n\nThen, Schmemann in his preface as if he is standing among in these times and describing them including the devaluing of the Eucharist.\n\n“Thoughts and questions on this subject (the eucharist), which go back to early adolescence, have filled my whole life with joy - but, alas not only with joy. For the more real became my experience of the eucharistic liturgy, the sacrament of Christ's victory and of his glory the stronger became my feeling that there is a eucharistic crisis in the Church. In the tradition of the Church, nothing has changed. What has changed is the perception of the eucharist, the perception of its very essence. Essentially, this crisis consists in a lack of connection and cohesion between what is accomplished in the eucharist and how it is perceived, understood and lived. ...\n\n“Meanwhile, it can be said without exaggeration that we live in a frightening and spiritually dangerous age. It is frightening not just because of its hatred, division and bloodshed. It is frightening above all because it is characterized by a mounting rebellion against God and his kingdom. (emphasis mine throughout). Not God but man has become the measure of all things. Not faith but ideology and utopian escapism are determining the spiritual state of the world. At a certain point, Western Christianity accepted this point of view: almost at once one or another 'theology of liberation' was born. Issues relating to economics, politics and psychology have replaced a Christian vision of the world at the service of God. Theologians, clergy and other professional 'religious' run busily around the world defending --from God? -- this or that right, however perverse, and all this in the name of peace, unity and brotherhood. Yet in fact, the peace, unity and brotherhood are not the peace, unity and brotherhood that has been brought to us by our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n“Perhaps, many people will be astonished that, in response to this crisis, I propose that we turn our attention not to its various aspects but rather to the sacrament of the eucharist and to the Church whose very life flows from that sacrament. Yes, I do believe, that precisely here, in this holy of holies of the Church, in this ascent to the table of the Lord in his kingdom, is the source of that renewal for which we hope...\"\n\nAlongside this introduction by Schmemann, I would offer some equally clarifying remarks by Walter Brueggamann, an ordained minister in the Church of Christ, a prolific author and a professor at Columbia Theological Seminary:\n\n\"I have come to think that the moment of giving the Bread of Eucharist as a gift is the quintessential center of the notion of Sabbatical rest in Christian tradition. It is a gift. We receive it in gratitude. Imagine having a sacrament named \"thanks”! We are on the receiving end, without accomplishment, achievement or qualification. It is a gift and we are grateful. That moment of gift is a peaceable alternative that many who are 'weary and heavy-laden, cumbered with a load of care' receive gladly. The offer of free gift, faithful to Judaism, might let us learn enough to halt the dramatic anti-neighborliness to which our society is madly and uncritically committed. Preface, Sabbath as Resistance, pp. xvi and xvii, Westminster John Knox Press 2017.\n\nThen, in his seminal work, The Prophetic Imagination, published over 40 years ago and republished in 2018 in a celebratory 40th anniversary edition, he quotes William T. Cavanagh from his book, Torture and Eucharist: Politics and Body of Christ. I won't try to recapitulate the discussion of the book which concerns the Church's response to the Pinochet reign of torture and terror in Chile. Cavanaugh described the Bishops and other church leadership as “asleep at the switch” and “passively conced[ing] everything to the regime.”\n\nCavanagh states, as summarized by Brueggamann: “After a certain point, however, the bishops of the church began to realize that the community - forming miracle of the Eucharist was a vehicle for the rule of God and a practical instrument for generating communities of resistance to the state.”\n\nThen, Brueggamann analyzes Cavanaugh's commentary on a novel by Laurence Thornton entitled Imagining Argentina. The set-up is between two imaginations, that of the torture state and that of “an imagination… defined as nothing less than 'the magnificent cause of being.'” Then, Cavanagh quotes from the novel concerning alternative realities, a thrilling passage to me concerning the Eucharist:\n\n\"To participate in the Eucharist is to live inside God's imagination. It is to be caught up into what is really real, the body of Christ. As human persons, body and soul are incorporated into the performance of Christ's corpus verum, they resist the state's ability to define what is real through the mechanism of torture.\"\n\nWhat I hope this discussion will spark is the question of whose imagination we are living in - in these times and in our responses. Could we consider together the path to live in God's imagination, the kingdom of heaven, and the Eucharist as reality and answer?\n\nFinally, I also refer you to two recent commentaries by our friend, Luther Alexander. They are linked below. Luther is a lifelong friend of Todd Lipe, the coordinator of our intercessor team. Luther is a Chaplain to the chaplains in military and civil service at the most sensitive levels. He has become a friend of mine for which I am grateful. He is an African American who lays out the teachings of Jesus which are central to every intensive we have, and which call us to that third way of Jesus. Laid out there is the central reality for making disciples after Jesus, following him ourselves in the power of the Holy Spirit. These teachings are not principles or practices but an active participation in the victory of Jesus. They are realities of obedience in the Spirit, yoked to Jesus. Please spend some time with it.\n\n“Lost in Translation” (Matthew 28:16-20) by the Rev. Luther C. Alexander, Jr.\n\n“Standing with Jesus” (Matthew 10:24-39) by the Rev. Luther C. Alexander, Jr.\n\nBlessings, trip\n\nDear Friends,\n\nI have been invited by several folks in the last week, including our Board and a couple of our intercessors, to communicate to our Verbena friends in the midst of the Coronavirus declared pandemic. I'll start off by saying this: Surely the people of God must have a Spirit-led response in the midst of any storm, crisis or challenge that brings light and hope into darkness, anxiety, panic and fear, while at the same time obeying the authorities and being prudent in all circumstances.\n\nWhen I began to draft this piece last Friday, following a Board call, I found that many other believing leaders were doing the same thing and in far greater depth and research informed than I am able to do here. Here is a link to one of the most exhaustive lay responses I have seen. Please read it all the way through. It is wise, thorough and a call to unique responses as citizens of the kingdom of heaven as well as one to the pragmatic based on good authority. It dovetails with my own thoughts in many ways, which I will summarize here…\n\nFirst of all, we must pray. This is a call to intercession on behalf of the whole world, and the heart of Verbena is intercession. We believe this changes everything, including us, as we seek the mercy and intervention of a loving and good God. Oswald Chambers once asserted that God changes things in response to prayer. That hit me with the force of transforming thunder 22 years ago, and we have believed it and practiced it for every person coming for an intensive in the most damaging of circumstances and memory. God is aware of this crisis, as He has been of every other the world has faced over time... So, let’s pray.\n\nHere is what my pastor invites us to pray for:\n\nWe pray not only for ourselves, but for all who have been impacted, indeed devastated, by this virus. Pray for those who have lost their lives and their livelihoods and those who are helping them; pray for the medical teams and first responders who are on the front lines of our health defense and those doing research and working behind the scene to end this. Pray for those who lead our nation and states as well as leaders the world over that a coordinated cooperative effort may bring about a swifter resolution to a health crisis.\n\nHe concludes with this statement which I wholeheartedly pass on to you. \"Prayer is a good antidote to panic.\" He then quotes Philippians 4:6-7 (NIV), \"Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\" Let’s do this together and with our children.\n\nContinue as often as you will to receive the Eucharist. If your church is closed, meet in a small group and with your family to receive. We believe in the Real Presence so let’s receive it, administering in the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, asking God through the descending power of the Holy Spirit to make these elements for us the sacramental reality of His body and blood as He declared it is. Appeal to your church leaders to make the sacrament available to smaller units of folks at various times throughout the week as opposed to shutting everything down.\n\nContinue to meet together for worship and prayer in small groups, as Hebrews 10 instructs, encouraging one another in the today of this crisis and while we still call it Today.\n\nHelp the poor and displaced. What an opportunity to stand in the gap, not hoarding but sharing with those losing jobs, losing meals and losing housing. Meeting the pressing needs of our neighbors right where we are. This can be accomplished with the appropriate and advised social distancing. And powerfully preach the love of God.\n\nObey the authorities. Be prudent and wise, informed and gentle. Read The Wall Street Journal article of March 14th entitled \"America's Long Fight Against Contagion.\" I am in the demographic most at risk by age and by underlying conditions. Elderly, really? Laurie asked me if I were concerned for myself. I said, \"No, not really,” but I will take all the precautions recommended.\n\nJesus is the same today as he has been through every contagion and catastrophe and He is the way, the truth, and the life. And so, I trust in God for my going out and coming in and for yours. I will stay at my post. Would I like your prayers for my protection? \"Yes.\" Do I wash my hands, and do I elbow pump when the putt rolls into the hole? \"Yes.\" Am I at risk? \"Yes.\" Am I at peace? \"Yes.\" Am I praying? \"Yes.\"\n\nForgive me if you think this next paragraph is out of place in addressing the subject, but I feel deeply convicted in my spirit to express it. The biggest threat to America and its people, and to the world and its people, is not this virus. It is a threat for sure and to the most vulnerable: this for the elderly as polio was to the children. But there is a virus growing more lethal and pervasive. It is the ever-present virus of deception and unbelief in the goodness of God and calling evil good and good evil. We pray for the elderly in this current crisis. All lives are precious, including the most vulnerable of all, the unborn, dying in massively greater proportion. With this in mind, I pray:\n\nFather, use all crises to bring many to Christ and open all eyes to the truth. And use them more clearly in us to conform us more nearly to the image of your Son according to your purpose. In that way, all things work together for good for those who love the Lord and who are called according to that purpose that He, Jesus, might be the first born among many bearing that family likeness.\n\nFinally, the Covid-19 crisis is causing us to pause and reorder. It also comes in intensity here during Lent, a recurring time to pause and reorder in the rhythm of time eternal. It is a concurrent time to pause to believe, maybe a nudge to silence and contemplation on that which is Eternal and an exposing of idols in how we spend our time. I am filling some of that Lenten space and reordering to the Sabbath. I am reading Sabbath as Resistance by Walter Brueggemann. He describes the Sabbath pause, and you could even say this dual pause we are in is transformational:\n\n\"In this (Hebrew) interpretive tradition, Sabbath is not simply a pause. It is an occasion for reimagining all social life away from coercion and competition to compassionate solidarity. Such solidarity is imaginable and capable of performance only when the drivenness of acquisitive is broken. Sabbath is not simply the pause that refreshes. It is the pause that transforms. Whereas Israelites are always tempted to acquisitiveness, Sabbath is an invitation to receptivity, an acknowledgement that what is needed is given and need not be seized.\" (p. 45)\n\nWill you join me in this Lenten Sabbath, all the more spacious in light of these recent developments? Let’s redeem the time in many ways with our eyes fixed on Jesus. And remember this redemptive promise and invitation contingent on repentance and prayer. So we are back where we started, with prayer:\n\nWhen I shut up the heavens so that there is no more rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among the people, if my people, who are called by my name (that is us), will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will turn from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land. (2 Chronicles 7:14)\n\nBless you all in every way.\n\nTrip and Laurie\n\nI came to the eight day retreat at Eastern Point on Cape Anne, MA this year expectant and energized. Lent was underway for 2019 and I had prepared more than usual for the 40 days which would include the 8 days of silence for Laurie and me. On the backend, we take an extra night in Boston that gives us time to share our encounters with our Lord and our surroundings from our solitude and to name some takeaways.\n\nSo even with several intensives and the week around the National Prayer Breakfast concluded, I had intentionally spent more time listening to the ways God may be communicating about the time. In Washington, our friend Richard Treacy mentioned that he was praying through Lent using Eugene Petersen\"s book on the Psalms of Ascent (Psalms 120-134), A Long Obedience in the Same Direction. It immediately resonated with my spirit as Richard and I laughed uproariously at our choice this year of ascent over descent for Lent. We decided to join the Hebrews as they make their Alyiah-- going up to Jerusalem and Jesus as he makes his way up from the Kidron Valley to the same Jerusalem and the Cross.\n\nThis also offered consideration of my own direction, past, present, and future. Is it obedient? Is it the same direction? Has it been and will it continue to be steadfast? All of this input seemingly important for a lengthy pause to listen to God about it. Helpfully, over the past couple of years, I have also become aware of God speaking into each day, presently as I listened, in big things and small. It is a growing awareness and practice and an increasing delight to grow in the reality of trusting what one hears and acting on it. Increasingly, it has opened up spaciousness, a more relaxed presence and actually extending the days. It has also made me far more intentional.\n\nIn that way, as I prepared for the retreat and the Lenten vigil, I believe the Lord brought seven words to my conscious mind and I wrote them down to bring to the retreat time. The words were radical, beauty, palm, transition, death, mercy, and gratitude or gratefulness. In this writing I share how the \"radical\" was fleshed out during solitude. I will also say that each word was encountered and filled with meaning and messages through the homilies, devotional texts, daily Scriptures, spiritual direction and encounter with the great outdoors. Each word has its own story of revelation, connection, and path and together form a grid of unity -- a fabric -- each one informing the other as I listened. I cannot overstate how thrilling, informative, and encouraging this was and is. It emphasizes to me, and I hope to you in your journey, that each day can be alive in the Spirit as we learn that \"man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.” God is speaking. Am I listening? God created as the Word is spoken and his ongoing creativity invites collaborative participation in the work of the Spirit. The unfolding of each of the words is a full story in itself.\n\nThe word \"radical\" posed this question to me: \"What does \"radical\" describe for me going forth into the fourth quarter of my life as a disciple of Jesus and an elder in the faith. I began with the dictionary which presents two distinct meanings. The first is \"arising from or going to the root or source; fundamental; basic. The radical sign in mathematics is a symbol placed before a quantity to indicate its root is to abstracted. Lots to work with there. Secondly, and more familiar to us as commonly articulated and descriptive of a position: \"carried to the farthest limit; extreme; sweeping.\" \"Radical social change\" is the usage example. Plenty of space to play in also.\n\nAt the retreat, a slim devotional volume was made available for Lent. I used it alongside Petersen’s book. One day the devotional entry was titled \"Radical Faithfulness.\" It jumped off the page. It had my attention. The Scripture was Jesus' calling of Levi, now called Matthew, the tax collector and his response: \"And leaving everything behind, he got up and followed him.\"\n\nLuke 5:27-28. The writer comments:\n\n“Unlike Matthew, we do not necessarily have to leave\n\nour families and our belongings behind, but if we do\n\nit right (in following Jesus) we do have to be radical\n\nabout it because, quite frankly, everything about Jesus\n\nis radical. I often say that if I could grasp with my\n\nhuman mind the reality of who Jesus is and what he\n\nhas given to me, my life would change in radical and\n\ntransformational ways.”\n\nThe fact that these verses and this commentary showed up concerning the word \"radical\" felt like a gift and affirmation at the same time, and the gifts kept coming. It drew me to simplicity and making a smaller footprint of stuff. Traveling lighter in the fourth quarter. Shedding along the way so to speak, and enjoying all the more what God has given me, materially and relationally. When these convergences so clearly occur, God's faithfulness, his actuality is preached to me. I sit in the silence marveling that He is saying to me: \"Hey, I am working with you. I am communicating. Receive it. Continue to listen, believe and obey. Believe what you see and hear in the smallest of things. Act on it.\" And these verses pile on: \"Ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find. Knock and the door will be opened to you.\" In all things, \"pray without ceasing\". \"My sheep know my voice and follow me. They will not follow a stranger.\" A simple, obedient and, yes, radical way to live.\n\nSo the foregoing is one impactful meaning for \"radical\" in my journey and maybe has some bearing on yours. Another dimension and meaning opened up for me as I read Psalm 126 with Petersen's commentary. I realized that over the last three years in particular a sense and practice of celebration and its expression as gratitude to God, honor to people and daily remarking on something delightful in that day had taken hold of me. \"Isn't that wonderful. Let's celebrate it now.\" Could this be a developing, radical way to live out my life. Psalm 126 and Petersen say \"Yes\". In his discourse, he emphasizes laughter and joy. He quotes his Message translation of Philippians 4: 4-5:\n\n\"Celebrate God all day, everyday. I mean revel in him.\n\nMake it as clear as you can to all you meet that you are\n\non their side, working with them, and not against them.\n\nHelp them see that the Master is about to arrive. He may\n\nshow up any minute.\"\n\nMaybe here, in living out the Christ life to the full, we get closer to a vitality, an overflow, a spirit radical in celebration of the goodness of God. Thus at this point \"radical\" seems more like energetic, anticipatory, visionary, and alive. Not competing but blessing; at home in the present and articulating in all circumstances the hope that is within. It seems to be all about being certain about God and living on the basis, and loving on the basis, of who He is. Joy.\n\nThis, of course, is not to deny suffering in oneself, in others and throughout the world. It does not mean separating from grief instead of grieving. Petersen says this about suffering, and we intercede with this confidence in every intensive before the Cross:\n\n\"All suffering, all pain, all emptiness, all disappointment is\n\nseed. Sow it in God and he will, finally, bring a crop of joy\n\nfrom it....The joy comes because God knows how to wipe\n\naway tears, and in his resurrection work, create the smile\n\nof new life. Joy is what God gives, not what we work up.\"\n\nRadical seeks and delights in and is stunned by beauty. Radical is patient in transition, not passing one by but seeing transitions as necessary to move from one place of growth to another, changed from one form of glory to the next. Radical opens the hands; it also raises the palms in praise and extends the hands in welcome. Radical does not fear death and treasures each moment of life, knowing death is transition itself. Radical is mercy. Gratefulness, gratitude is a radical response to a radical love.\n\nMay the succeeding days of my life and yours, dear friends, be filled radically with the life of Christ, an un-self-conscious witness that we are delighted to be chosen and called and that we are ready with the answer in radical obedience to His voice. Shall we encourage each other in this? Shall we shout it together from the rooftops? Let’s.\n\nBlessings,\n\nTrip and Laurie\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nLaurie and I, and the Verbena friends and partners, pay special tribute and honor to Jean Vanier, the founder and visionary of the L'Arche communities. Laurie and I were privileged to attend, with Ron Ivey and others, the last English speaking retreat Jean led. The retreat was at La Ferme in France, the original L'Arche community and Jean's home. We are saddened by his passing but so grateful for his life. His mentoring and sharing of the gospel through introducing his friends numbered among the disabled helped us see our own disabilities and laugh together. Verbena is committed to partnering with L'Arche any way we can.\n\nHappy New Year to you. I am writing this letter from a personal retreat I try to take each year at St. Francis Springs Prayer Center about 30 miles north of Greensboro. I take three days and three nights there beginning on January 2nd. The purpose is at least two-fold. First and foremost it is a time of reflection and writing concerning the year that has passed: a chronicle, an evaluation (or examen as Ignatius puts it) and a report on that year in all the spheres of life.\n\nAs I reflect and write, it is a time to celebrate the amazing things brought our way in family, ministry, relationship, spiritual growth and physical health. As I record these multiple times of blessing it is almost overwhelming. Gratitude just poured forth as I would re-experience them in reflection. Then, I just as carefully seek to re-visit and record the places of sorrow, hurt and conflict; also, times of frustration, fear and anger that move me to find peace and forgiveness often of myself and others. It is a cleansing time for moving into the New Year.\n\nThus, reflection looms large in this space. In my devotions I am struck by how often Mary's journey is mentioned by commentators encouraging reflection. Two writings follow which encourage a pause at the beginning of the year and may still encourage you to do so. One commenter says this:\n\nIn the midst of all this looking ahead, I take great comfort in the\n\nexample that Mary gives at the start of it all. After the birth of Jesus\n\nand the visit of the shepherds, Luke tells us Mary \"kept all these\n\nthings, reflecting on them in her heart (Luke 2:19). The New Year\n\nbegins not with Mary straining forward or \"leaning in\", but \"bending\n\nback\". It begins in reflection from (flectere, \"to bend\"). Instead of our\n\nsecular ritual of the New Year's resolution - those well-intentioned\n\npromises that we know we will never keep - Mary models a different\n\npractice: prayerful consideration of what has already taken place.\n\nHahnenberg, Give us this Day (January 2019, p.5).\n\nAnother author puts it this way in relation to a \"yes\" to what God’s call may be us to in the new year:\n\nThe dawning of a new year causes many of us to reflect in our heart.\n\nWe have turned the page on the old calendar with gratitude, with\n\nsome Auld Lang Syne wistfulness, or with regrets or even deep remorse\n\nover things we have done or failed to do. For some of us the old\n\nyear brought crushing sorrow- or incandescent joy. The new year\n\nmay bring either or both of these extremes, or it may simply bring\n\na normal ebb and flow of life's disappointments and delights....\n\nMary carried an equanimity and an unfolding wisdom born of saying\n\n\"yes\" to the new. May we follow her example and notice in this new\n\nyear where God is offering opportunities for us to offer a \"yes\" of our own.\n\nThis brings us to my second purpose for drawing aside at this time, namely in prayer for growth in discernment and listening and an attentive ear for this new year while I am alone and in solitude. It so helps to reconcile with the joys and sorrows of the prior year as we pray for wisdom and a growth in love, compassion and thanksgiving in this present one. So I want to share with you a prayer I came across in relation to the year opening up before us. I pray this for myself, my family, for you and for the many constituencies of the Verbena vision and invite you to join in on all those levels as we pray.\n\nPrayer for Guidance\n\nSteer the ship of my life Lord, to your quiet harbor,\n\nwhere I can be safe from the storms of sin and conflict.\n\nShow me the course I should take.\n\nRenew in me the gift of discernment\n\nSo that I can always see the right direction in which I should go.\n\nAnd give me the strength and the courage to choose the\n\nright course, even when the seas are rough and the waves high,\n\nKnowing that through enduring hardship and danger we\n\nshall find comfort and peace.\n\n-- St. Basil of Caesarea.\n\nNow, I am moved to pray for healing and wholeness for the folks who come for prayer this year and those God brings to you. And a deepening prayer of mine for is for healing and unity in the whole body of Christ - the Church. Just as intentionally, I pray for a renewal and increase in the gift of hospitality as Laurie and I welcome people into our home before an intensive and as I receive each one for prayer the days they are here, the warmth of hospitality being critical to a sense of safety and connection. I pray the same for your home and for every gathering we host, large or small. This is a prayer on those two fronts that it would be powerful to pray in unity together this year:\n\nPrayer for Wholeness and Healing\n\nWe come together,\n\nbroken, shaken, shattered, barely standing.\n\nAs a church and a people\n\nwe are holding tight to a reality that we are\n\nstruggling to understand.\n\nWe come together as the People of God,\n\nsimply together, without rank or hierarchy,\n\nseeking a glimpse of the\n\nDivine that is Love.\n\nWe come together to pray\n\nWords cannot utter our heart.\n\nImages constrain our mind.\n\nGod knows what is deepest in our hearts.\n\nWe sit open to this understanding.\n\nGod show each of us what is needed.\n\nWe gather as the people of God\n\nangry, distraught, called to action.\n\nWe gather\n\nseeking a unifying love that can only come from the\n\npresence of the Divine One.\n\nLove's greatest design\n\nis for wholeness and healing.\n\nWe gather as the people of God,\n\ncalled to incarnate this\n\ngreat design to whom all we encounter.\n\n-- Sr. Linda Buck, CSJ\n\nAnother source of my devotions here is a book that Henri Nouwen wrote, his last book before he died: Can You Drink The Cup?. It is meditative and slim and weaves in the stories and companions of those last years in the community of L'Arche Dayspring in Canada. The unfolding meditation tracks the gestures in engaging a cup, holding, lifting, drinking and the application to the follower of Jesus as only Nouwen in profound simplicity can express it. Consider this one thought on drinking the cup and the accompanying commentary from the introduction by Ron Hansen in pursuing authenticity in who we are and in our vocational obedience:\n\nDrinking the cup of life is fully appropriating and internalizing\n\nour own unique existence with all its sorrows and joys. (Nouwen p. 13)\n\nIt is the challenge to forthrightly acknowledge who we are, to\n\nforsake the entrapments of our addictions, compulsions and sins,\n\nand to be as fully trusting in God as Jesus was when he, in a\n\nspirit of unconditional love accepted his ministry with all its con-\n\nsequences. (Hansen, p. 13).\n\nNouwen explores this and so much more for a life in discipleship and contemplation. For those wanting and walking this way of love, he says this about lifting the cup, namely the absolute need for community which we heartily affirm in our ministry and through Verbena:\n\nLifting our cup means sharing our life so we can celebrate it. When\n\nwe truly believe we are called to lay down our lives for our friends,\n\nwe must dare to take the risk to let others know what we are living.\n\nThe important question is, \"Do we have a circle of trustworthy friends\n\nwhere we feel safe enough to be intimately known and called to an\n\nalways greater maturity?\"\n\nMay it be so among us with you and you with us. It is so affirming and encouraging and life giving to be able to answer that question \"Yes\" we have such a circle as we enter our 22nd year of praying with people.\n\nFinally, after quoting so much for you to pray and consider from my time away, it is fitting and necessary to conclude with a blessing to you which I receive in my life and vocation in solitude that is straight from Scripture. I pass on to you that which I receive:\n\nThe Lord said to Moses: \"Speak to Aaron and his sons and tell them:\n\nThis is how you shall bless the Israelites. Say to them:/ The Lord let\n\nhis face shine upon you, and be gracious to you!/ The Lord look upon\n\nyou kindly and give you peace./ So shall they invoke my name upon\n\nthe Israelites, and I will bless them.\n\nMuch love and blessing in this New Year.\n\nTrip and Laurie\n\nI realize that reading a Highway letter is somewhat of a commitment. Rather than being a one pager or a daily devotion, it is more an attempt to communicate how a vision is being unfolded in time, through a framework of prayer and discernment. Hopefully, it also can spark something in your own journey of faith as we believe together in the One He has sent. Thank you for taking the time. Any response or feedback is a welcome dialogue.\n\nI am focusing in this Reflection on the connection and importance of community and the ministry of presence in relation to the working out of the kingdom of heaven together. I have been ruminating on this topic for some time as we have been experiencing the value of that connection in multiple ways. One very clear expansion of the Verbena vision in the last several years has been the call to travel to communities across the country, and more recently internationally, where those who have been to Greensboro for an intensive prayer time reside and who indicate a desire to stay connected to us and our work.\n\nAs I was preparing to write on this theme, I was handed a copy of Pope Francis' March 19, 2018 Apostolic Exhortation entitled \"On the Call to Holiness in Today's World\". Todd Lipe, one of our intercessors and a close companion day-to-day, passed it along to me from a lifelong friend of his who ministers to folks in a strategic U.S Agency worldwide. Neither of these men are members of the Roman Catholic Church and both are Jesus people recognizing the call to unity across the whole body of Christ and the wisdom that can be shared. As the Creed expresses: One holy, catholic and apostolic church.\n\nThe Verbena conversation continues to unfold and our vision is to pray for the realized union with Christ in the individual believer, also in the marriages represented and then in the whole of the mystical body of Christ, the Church, past, present and future. In that prayer, we join Jesus in his prayer (the whole of John 17) that we may be one with the Father and the Son, even as they are one, in the unity of the Holy Spirit individually and collectively and thus witness his love to the whole world. (For more on this, see our November 3, 2015 Highway Reflection here.)\n\nAs I became quiet during the last several days of precious solitude for writing, prayer and reflection, I read the whole of Francis' exhortation, which I highly recommend to each of you as a reminder of the depth and immediacy of the Gospel reality. Particularly though, in light of the theme coming to me, and after coming off visits to Kansas City, Denver, Annapolis and Rome over several months and powerful connections in Durham, Tulsa, DC, Paris and Israel in the prior few years, I was riveted by the sections on community and prayer which are so passionately and beautifully articulated. Francis' themes are so in union with the vision for Verbena and are being practically worked out in our current experience, one by one and community by community. In recognition of that union, and wisdom beyond my own, I am going to share selections of Francis' thoughts and claim them also as an inspiration for a growing vision to be lived out among us. As Francis outlines, our commitment to be with others is a witness of Jesus' commitment to be with us always and in everything. Our willingness to listen and to go and be with; the invitation for people to come into space for healing and the commitment to community and family are all distinct calls to the disciples of Jesus throughout the Scriptures.\n\nThe opposite, the negative or shadow side, living in selfish isolation, as expressed by Francis, is dangerous in the extreme to ourselves and others: \"When we live apart from others, it is very difficult to fight against concupiscence (lust, greed, sensuality), the snares of temptations of the devil and the selfishness of the world. Bombarded by so many enticements, we can grow too isolated, lose our sense of reality and inner clarity, and easily succumb.\" (para. 140)\n\nThe path in light includes this: \"Growth in holiness is a journey in community, side by side with others.\" This living alongside is witnessed in holy matrimony as well as in the broader communal life. \"In many holy marriages too, each spouse becomes a means used by Christ for the sanctification of the other. Living and working alongside others is surely a path to spiritual growth. St. John Of the Cross told one of his followers: 'You are living with others to be fashioned and tried.' \" (para. 141).\n\nCreating space for others permits the sharing of realties invited by Jesus that reveal himself in our midst. \"Each community (whether with one other or many) is called to create a 'God-enlightened space in which to experience the hidden presence of the risen Lord'. Sharing the word and the Eucharist together fosters fraternity and makes us a holy and missionary community.\" (para. 142). \"The common life whether in family, the parish, the religious community or any other, is made up of small everyday things. This was true of the holy community formed by Jesus, Mary and Joseph, which reflected in a beautiful way the beauty of the Trinitarian Community. It was also true of the life Jesus shared with his disciples and with ordinary people.\" (para. 143).\n\nThe ministry of presence then is sharing the life Jesus shares and bringing that life to each encounter with another. There is also the ministry of presence to be received in the mutuality of encounter. We experience this mutuality in each community we enter and with each person who comes to Greensboro, no matter the depth of their pain. In the communities, we stand in the midst of families, the children all around, and in the midst of generations, in the gathering of friends sharing the Eucharist and song and in the neighborhoods. The warm and gracious hospitality of our hosts and the friends they invite, the children that play are all the expression of this mutuality.\n\nThe ministry of presence also opens up the ministry of absence. When one leaves to go, the absence is felt and real -- particularly in the care of children and other responsibilities. This where there is the opportunity for the Lord in his mercy to fill that space and for loving members of the family and community to step in. There is always a cost to going. And, of course, in coming and going, and in receiving others, we have to mindful and committed to stay connected to our families, local communities, friends, parishes and churches. It is always good and a more solid witness to come from a real place and back again, a place – home, which has an authenticity in intimacy at every level.\n\nFrancis then turns to the subject and practice of prayer in its many forms. Each one, and its atmosphere, we seek to practice and to grow in in our own journey of faith. I will only mention a couple in closing that we find vital. First and emphatically he emphasizes that the call to community is not a call away from solitude and silence. It is not selfish isolation but an entering in soul, alone to God in communion. It is to be with God in community, to listen, to stay connected vertically first. Apart from it can we really know when and where to go, when to stay and when to play and whom to receive? In silence, we listen to one voice. In contemplation, we fellowship with the one who occupies our inmost part and invites us there. In quiet discernment, we come to know the way rather than make our own haphazard plans, which may actually work against community, unity and love.\n\nFrancis says it this way: \"In that silence, we can discern in light of the spirit, the paths of holiness to which the Lord is calling us. Otherwise, any decisions we make may only be window-dressing that, rather than exalting the Gospel in our lives, will mask or submerge it. For each disciple, it essential to spend time with the Master, to listen to his words, and to learn from him always. Unless we listen all our words (and actions) will be nothing but chatter.\" (para. 150).\n\nSo vital in the journey of an intensive – and in our own – is where the gaze has been and where it becomes fixed through prayer. We find in every case as the eyes of the heart are opening, as Francis says that \"contemplation of the face of Jesus, died and risen, restores our humanity, even when it has been broken by the troubles of this life or marred by sin. We must not domesticate the power of the face of Christ.\" The \"abode of divine mercy,\" the place of healing and transformation is \"to enter into the Lord's heart, into his wounds.\" From the gaze into that reality, Francis promises, and we have seen it fulfilled, that your words and witness will catch fire. (para. 151).\n\nFinally, then, on the power and necessity of intercessory prayer, I leave with each of you and especially our team of intercessors in deep gratitude, this encouragement by Francis: \"Intercessory prayer is an expansion of our fraternal concern for others, since we are able to embrace their lives, their deepest troubles and their loftiest dreams. Of those who commit themselves generously to intercessory prayer we can apply these words of Scripture: 'This is a man (this is a woman) who loves the brethren and prays much for the people'. \" 2 Mac. 15:14. (para 154).\n\nThis is a powerful reminder to us all that every intensive is an intercession, undergirded by the prayers of the saints, including our team, and joining Jesus in his intercession for us.\n\nMuch love and blessings,\n\nTrip and Laurie\n\nP.S. - To read the full Apostolic Exhortation \"On the Call to Holiness in Today's World\" click here.\n\nWhere there is no vision, the people perish; but he that keepeth the law,\n\nHappy is he. - Proverbs 29:18 (KJV)\n\nWhere there is no revelation, people cast off restraint: but blessed is\n\nIs the one who heeds wisdom's instruction. - Proverbs 29:18 (NIV)\n\nIf people can't see what God is doing, they stumble all over themselves;\n\nBut when they attend to what he reveals, they are most blessed. - Proverbs 29:18 (The Message)\n\nWhere there is ignorance of God, crime runs wild; but what a wonderful\n\nThing it is for a nation to know and keep his laws. - Proverbs 29:18 (The Living Bible)\n\nI have written about the arresting nature of convergences before--intersections in our lives that call attention to a meaning far deeper than the ordinary flow of events. They can be both deeply personal and also have a larger, universal application. If I am attentive enough, I have found them to be opportunities to pause, reflect and be informed in mystery.\n\nThe prompting revealed in this reflection concerns music, musicians and concert goers. Our paths seemed to cross so intimately and tragically in this year 2017. What to make of it?\n\nSeveral months ago, I had some rare time alone in our home. I had finished an intensive three-day prayer session, full of its preciousness and the privilege to be with a person. I turned to the Netflix documentary section. Many of you know that I love and have devoured scores of biographies and many documentaries on the lives of artists from all genres. I believe there is a close connection in the Spirit between artistry and imagination involved in prayer intercession for another. The imaginative world of the arts, whether music, literature (including by all means poetry), painting, iconography, photography, and other art forms including film and architecture tap the mystical elements of a person. A strategic part of the Verbena vision is to keep a dialogue alive concerning these shared experiences in transcendence and creativity.\n\nMy Netflix search lighted upon a three-hour Tom Petty documentary. I only barely knew of him, having heard a song of his here and there but not always knowing his sound. I was transfixed by the story of this rock music man played out through concerts, collaborations and fights with the music industry. He had a grit and a vision that drove 40 years of music production into places where opposition, intimidation, scarce resources and limited vision of others would have stopped other gifted men and women in their tracks. But I also encountered a joyous humility in him as he would include others in his journey and join them in theirs. He often celebrated the gifts of folks like Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and George Harrison, as collaboration and friendship overtook being in the singular spotlight. His fight over the right to his own music was truly a David and Goliath triumph. His victory set a distinct and valuable marker in the music industry for other artists. That underlying fierceness, undoubtedly formed by some brutal childhood hurts, was always tempered, it seems, by his willingness to see and care for a person, whether fan or colleague.\n\nJust a couple months later: Las Vegas, a country concert drawing hundreds from all over the country. Open air, friendships, & celebrations: a community drawn together by music becomes a shooting gallery. Before the shooting, \"America, the Beautiful\" sung in unison to hundreds of lighters illuminating the scene. Then, the horror of carnage rained down on the trapped, unsuspecting and unprotected concert-goers. This violence linked in malevolence if not in cause, to the other tragedies experienced worldwide: innocent, unsuspecting folks trampled, blown-up, beheaded, shot and run over. This is a truly malignant and virulent unleashing of demonic force and overtaking that we are loathed to name. In our denial of supernatural evil, we deny the power and existence of supernatural good. We deny the sudden flash of Gabriel coming from another place to intersect a young women's destiny with a new narrative of both suffering and glory. We lose the reality of Saul being knocked off his high horse by a blinding light, this holy interruption intersecting his journey of destruction and changing his heart and his future.\n\nThree other convergences emerged, one shortly before I began to form these thoughts and the other two in the midst of writing. Last week, Laurie and I attended a Rhiannon Giddens concert at UNCG in Greensboro. Rhiannon is a youthful though now seasoned performer, a believer in Jesus, African-American in descent and historian of music particularly of music being lost from early black culture in America. Her original group in Greensboro was named the Chocolate Drops and now she is a Grammy winner living in Ireland. She is a wife, a mother and performer: singer and song-writer, violinist and fiddler as well as banjo player. Toward the end of the concert, she called out to us concert-goers: \" You know this has been a hard week. Las Vegas and Tom Petty dying.” There it was. This beautiful young woman, standing in the midst of her band (which included her sister) crying out: \" Shall we do a Tom Petty song?\" We erupted in acclaim and she and the band kicked into a rousing, defiant (but not angry) and convicted rendition of \" I won't back down\". She said we need this in the face of what is happening.\n\nLaurie and I left for the beach this week for a much-needed break and a chance to reflect and to write. I told her of the waves of thought breaking over my consciousness, intersecting my world of impression. As I read through the names, pictures and bios of the precious victims of the Las Vegas shooting, I felt a force of gravity, the deepest disturbance. I told her I wanted to understand the meaning of these events and experiences juxtaposed in such a short timeframe and then to write about it.\n\nThe next morning, she just started playing Greg Allman's last album, Southern Blood, released in September. Greg died earlier in 2017 than Petty. He died of lung cancer, untreated so that he could sing on, fearing that treatment would destroy his voice. Like Petty, he just completed his last concert tour before he died. The album, Laurie tells me, has only one original song. He had run out of energy to work on others so the rest of the album is covers of songs sung by Greg that he felt connected to by southern blood and that helped interpret his life. He chokes up in the course of \"Song for Adam\", a Jackson Browne cover, as his late brother Dwayne comes to mind. Jackson steps in to finish the harmony on his song about losing a friend to death. Her selection reminded me of a previous reading of Greg Allman's autobiography. It was a story of pain, music, recovery and redemption.\n\nObviously, these musicians, like us, are flawed. They struggle with addictions, broken relationships, losses and difficult childhoods. They also fought to play their music and to sing. The concert goers and fans there to hear them sing and join in. Their stories underscore the presence and activity of this malevolent force, more active and unleashed as our societies’ vision is lost and even repudiated. It is far from being just mental illness. This force tries to kill the singing in the universe and supplant it with fear and terror. It seizes from within and puts life into a mausoleum. Maybe this is not a startling revelation but it has converged on me and brought forth intense emotion and grieving. In my grief, I am discerning that this malevolence is the same force trying to destroy the song in each one we accompany in prayer.\n\nBut the Psalmist also says that God will give us a new song. Can we hear it? Can we learn to sing it together in the midst of horror, loss, and death. We have to listen for it and I admire those who fight to sing and write songs in various ways. They join in the creative celebration of the children of God. In fact, we have a musician, a music maker, in our midst. Our son, Julian, is a gifted artist, singer, song-writer and in my opinion virtuoso piano, keyboard and organ player and a beautiful guitarist. He has confronted his own fears and addictions and lives to make music as a solo act and with his band. He has been inspired more by his mother, a true keeper of the mystery and delight of music more than by my periodic belts of Elvis over the years. Keep singing, Julian.\n\nI am going to close this Reflection as we walk in this way of singing together, with the third interposition contemporaneous with this writing. It makes my point I hope in its unpretentiousness and sincerity. Yesterday, as I was finishing the draft of this piece, I received an email from Carol Patrick, one of our intercessors. Years ago, I prayed with this single woman for healing in great brokenness. She has sought and received healing relentlessly and courageously despite much opposition and misunderstanding. She has grown immensely in the Spirit and maintains a great sense of humor. She has also begun to write poetry and has been sharing it with me. She had no idea that I was writing or what I was writing but in her email she expressed her deepest angst over the events in Las Vegas. She then shared that she stepped outside into the darkest of night and was stunned by the brilliance and clarity of the fullest of moons. Transfixed by the light she created a poem. She threw it out to the darkness and stood her ground, solitary but aware. I believe this holy defiance makes a difference in the universe. Her artistic expression, fledgling as it is, gives voice to the hope within her and testifies to the light that has come into the world that the darkness cannot extinguish: Jesus. There is not another answer and Christ in you is the hope of glory right where you are and in the whole world. Don't back down. Shout out to me not to. Let’s sing our songs and let it rise.
