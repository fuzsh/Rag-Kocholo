        "text": "Their songwriting journey began in 2000 when Keith wrote the tune for “In Christ Alone” on the back of a Northern Ireland Electricity bill. Many songs, albums, and—most importantly—four daughters later, they still wake up each morning amazed that they get to spend their days crafting melodies and words to encourage and inspire the people of God.\n\nKeith and Kristyn love fostering creative collaborations. They established Getty Music with a view to the year 2050 in the hope that individuals, families, and churches would celebrate the beauty of Christ-centered hymnody. Their hymn writing team includes a growing array of contributors who are as committed to family and the local church as they are to the craft of songwriting. Their group’s songs include 38 of the top 500 titles sung in US/UK churches, such as “Christ Our Hope in Life and Death,” “His Mercy Is More,” “He Will Hold Me Fast,” “Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery,” “Power of the Cross,” “Speak O Lord,” and “My Worth Is Not in What I Own.” Their original publishers, Integrity Music, estimate that more than 100 million people around the globe sing this music every year in a diverse array of contexts. Their hymns uniquely cross genres, finding expression in styles from contemporary to classical as well as folk and global. The Getty Music team is currently developing the Sing! Hymnal, slated to be released in 2025 in partnership with Crossway.\n\nKeith and Kristyn enjoy filling their lives with songs of the Lord, whether at home with their daughters, in the sanctuary of their local church, or all of the places around the world they’ve had the privilege to visit—from Carnegie Hall to the Grand Ole Opry House, the Kennedy Center to Sydney Opera House, with performances for Presidents, Prime Ministers, and television specials on PBS, CBS, BBC, and TBN in between! They host the annual Sing! Conference in Nashville, TN (named after their 2017 book), and are now particularly excited to share Sing! events on each continent, as well as to help lead music at the Fourth Lausanne Congress in South Korea.\n\nAccording to Christianity Today, Keith and Kristyn have “changed the way evangelicals worship.” The hymn “In Christ Alone,” co-written by Stuart Townend, has received numerous accolades, from being named the second most beloved hymn in the UK by the BBC to being selected as one of the top five hymns of all time by the British Hymn Society. Keith was the first contemporary Christian musician to be awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 2018 for his contributions to music and hymnody. Their other acknowledgments include one GRAMMY® nomination, one mainstream Billboard #1, two GMA awards (with 16 nominations), three honorary doctorates, and they have been named Fellows of the Royal School of Church Music.\n\nThe Gettys’ hymns have been recorded by a vast array of artists from Alison Krauss, Ricky Skaggs, and Vince Gill to Broadway’s Heather Headley, South African vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, choirs of every conceivable flavor, and a range of gospel performers including Chris Tomlin, Michael W. Smith, hip-hop artist Trip Lee, and R&B singer Blessing Offor.\n\nKristyn’s creativity has also led to wider opportunities such as recording the entire ESV Bible as an audio version for Crossway and appearances in films including Pilgrim’s Progress, Sabina, and the international edition of Leroy and Stitch. She is delighted to be releasing several children’s books in the upcoming years.\n\nKeith and Kristyn are especially excited about the Getty Music Foundation, a new non-profit organization with a mission to educate hymn writers and spur biblical worship in under-resourced areas of the globe.\n\nTogether with their four daughters, Keith and Kristyn live between Northern Ireland and Nashville."
