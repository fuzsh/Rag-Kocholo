        "text": "Jim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nStop. You went beyond making a motion. You started to go into debate. You can make the motion, but you cannot talk about the motion will be non debatable. So you made your motion. You made a motion, correct? Thank you. That requires a second, seconded by Assembly Member Dixon.\n\nJuan Alanis\n\nLegislator\n\nWe must hold those negligence that possess this threat in the surrounding agriculture as well. For the California ecosystem, we need to hold them accountable. The author is pleased to share that a resolution has been reached with the opposition to this measure and he is committed to amending the Bill in the Senate to address those concerns.\n\nPilar Schiavo\n\nLegislator\n\nKnowledge of these fees are critical because many of the fees add up to 20% of the cost of a home, which is the tipping point for many people from having a home that's affordable. AB 1820 provides guardrails, especially for affordable housing developers, to have the predictability and the cost of building affordable housing that we need so desperately.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nFirst, it will require counties that fall below the statewide average to consult with the directors of the top three counties on best practices. And second, it would require those same counties to agendize the topic at a county Board of Supervisor hearing. This Bill has had bipartisan report support and I respectfully asked for aye vote.\n\nPhilip Ting\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mister Speaker. AB 1777 is my autonomous vehicles Bill. As many folks in the chamber know, autonomous vehicles first started in San Francisco with human drivers, and about over a year ago they started offering autonomous vehicle rides, rideshare rides that led to a variety of issues. So this Bill really closes a number or clarifies a number of issues. One, how first responders like fire departments, police departments can respond and interact with autonomous vehicles, because obviously you don't have a driver to interact with. Two, it allows officers to cite an autonomous vehicle.\n\nPhilip Ting\n\nLegislator\n\nRight now, the vehicle code cites drivers without a driver in the car. We needed to figure out how to cite a company, and that's what this does. And also, lastly, many local agencies as well as state agencies don't get the same amount of data that the national NHTSA does. And so this really adds a number of data requirements so that autonomous vehicle companies get that data to our state DMV as well as to our local agencies. With that respect for aye vote on AB 1777.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nYeah. Thank you Mister Speaker and Members. In thinking about this bill, I think many of you should ask yourselves, you know, the school that you grew up in, what was it like? For those of you in more urban districts? You probably didn't have a field or a ranch right next to your school.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nMany of you probably didn't have that. You're in an urban area you have, you know, other buildings, residences, communities right around you. By the way, many of those residences or are probably buying chemicals at the store, and they are spraying them completely unregulated onto their lawns or onto, you know, that go into gutters that go into sewer systems.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nNothing in this bill regulates that at all. It's completely focused on agriculture. And so for me, I went to an elementary school that had a rice field right next to it. You know, I went to a high school, you know, that had other crops and farms all around it.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd when they go and spray, they already go through a very regulated process. First of all, they can't spray anything that hasn't received a label from the Department of Pesticide Regulation in this state. Secondly, they already do have to go through the county AG Commissioner before they do any applications in this state.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nSo all these things are already done before any of these folks go spray a thing. But now what we're doing is we're adding additional requirements, additionally regulations on farmers. And, look, I grew up in this, and it has been safe. Pesticides and herbicides in agriculture have been safely applied for decades, for generations in these rural areas.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nIt is not an issue. And to me, a lot of this is really scare tactics to say, oh, in a quarter mile, you should have to have this and that. Why are the AG commissioners, by the way, why are the AG commissioners opposed to this Bill?\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nThe AG commissioners are the ones who actually do the work of ensuring that there's safely applied pesticides up and down this state. That's their job. They're the ones that regulate and enforce. If somebody does apply in the wrong way or if there is drift from a chemical application, they're the ones doing that work every day.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nWhy are they saying they're opposed to this bill? They don't think it's necessary, and they're the primary enforcers of agricultural pesticides and herbicides in this state. You might want to ask yourself that question. Why is all of agriculture opposed to this bill? Right.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nBecause you're adding all kinds of requirements on us, and it's already really difficult for us to continue to go in this state. So I'm just, please think about that. Do you have experience with this? Is this a problem in your schools? I venture to say it's not.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nYou might be want to be more worried about what people are applying, completely unregulated in your urban districts, next to schools. That might be something you should be more concerned about rather than worrying about a lot of the schools in my district and maybe rural communities throughout this district.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nI know there's other members in here that feel the same. Both parties like stop telling us what we need to do right when actually we do a whole lot and our communities are safe and our schools are safe and we don't need this additional regulation. It's unnecessary.\n\nDamon Connolly\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd finally, we're continuing to work with Ag on the scope of chemicals that would be subject to this. Namely currently restricted pesticides are within the Bill. This would include non restricted that are carcinogenic. I think it's a reasonable step, notwithstanding the overstatement that we just heard. And I would respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n\nSharon Quirk-Silva\n\nLegislator\n\nGood morning, Mister Speaker and Members. I rise to present AB 2433. AB 2433 addresses the lengthy delays in the building permit process by introducing flexibility and inspection timelines and the conditional utilization of private professional services. I'd like to thank all of the different stakeholders, including the fire chiefs and opposition, for working with my office to address concerns and develop amendments to this Bill. AB 2433 streamlines the inspection process, clarifies the use of private professional providers by local agencies, and updates the definition of high rise structures.\n\nChris Ward\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mister Speaker. I just wanted to rise as a proud joint author of Assembly Bill 2433 I want to thank our colleague from Fullerton for introducing this measure. Working on permitting, streamlining, and particularly some of the challenges that we have at local government to be able to process things in a timely fashion. I think it's going to be one of the most impactful things that we can do to be able to accelerate the approval of new housing and be able to get construction moving forward to provide more units for Californians in need. I would respectfully ask your aye vote.\n\nAkilah Weber\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Mister Speaker. Good morning Members. I rise today to address a crisis in this state, whether you are in a rural area or any inner city, and this is the closure of maternity wards or labor and delivery units up and down our state. AB 1895 will provide the state more advanced notification when a hospital has assessed that their maternity unit is at risk of closure. Current law requires a hospital to notify the California Department of Public Health and the public 90 days prior to the proposed closure of a maternity unit. Unfortunately, this is not enough time for the state to intervene.\n\nAkilah Weber\n\nLegislator\n\nFor these reasons, AB 1895 will require hospitals with maternity units that are at risk of of closure in the next six months to report several data points to the state. Additionally, the Bill will require the completion of a community impact that outlines the three closest hospitals offering maternity services in the geographic area and their distance from that at risk facility. Finally, once the hospital will provide public notice of potential closure, they will also need to have a comment period, which includes at least one public hearing. This Bill is sponsored by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Black Women for Wellness, Reproductive Freedom for All, and the California Nurse Midwives Association. I respectfully ask for an aye vote on AB 1895. Thank you.\n\nDavid Alvarez\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Mister Speaker. I want to stand and speak in support of our colleague, Doctor Weber, for doing this great work. This is, as she said, happening today, and it's happening in urban and rural settings. I know we've had conversations about rural settings, but in urban San Diego, in Chula Vista, a large city in San Diego, this is happening. And I want to just urge all of you to support this Bill because it could happen to you next.\n\nDavid Alvarez\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd the information that Doctor Weber has outlined that would be required as this Bill is outlined would be really extremely important for communities across the state that really depend on facilities, particularly maternity wards as we've seen unfortunately happen in San Diego. So I wanted to stand in support but also to thank Doctor Weber for her foresight in working on this before. Unfortunately this happened in San Diego and in Chula Vista but hopefully for other communities some of these impacts may be preventable. Thank you very much. I urge your aye vote on AB 1895.\n\nTom Lackey\n\nLegislator\n\nYeah, unfortunately, I know there's a lot of limitations here, and I know that this is a very controlled set of circumstances, but I will tell you, everybody, I'm too connected to this issue, and I've dealt with so many tragedies associated with impaired driving, and I'm haunted by the circumstances associated with this very serious problem.\n\nVince Fong\n\nLegislator\n\nTo help offset stress on our water infrastructure and aid groundwater recharge, many farmers intentionally flooded their fields. While this was done as a service for the good of the whole industry and the greater Central Valley community, these farmers received no credits toward their water use bills for this voluntary groundwater recharge and flood management. AB 2799 directs groundwater sustainability agencies to consider efforts by small farms to recharge their groundwater basins through voluntarily allowing percolation and flooding of their land during high water events. I respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n\nBlanca Rubio\n\nLegislator\n\nCurrently exceeding 160 million in non General Fund monies. Non General Fund monies. This Bill takes into account the interest of the respective parties as well as the future solvency of the fund, while allowing for over $80 million in surplus to be suspended and refunded back to those tribes that paid into the fund. There is no opposition to this Bill. I respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n\nChris Ward\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Madam Speaker and Members. This Bill allows our California State Universities to utilize the low income housing tax credit to create more affordable housing for our amazing CSU staff and faculty. The lack of access to affordable housing in California has increased the difficulty for CSUs to recruit and retain diverse and qualified staff. Prior legislation has provided access to the LIHTC for our California Community Colleges as well to our K-12 faculty, making AB 2005 an easy next step to provide housing. For these reasons, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nStephanie Nguyen\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing no others wishing to speak on this item, the Clerk will open the roll. All those votes who desire to vote. All those votes who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those votes who desire to vote. The Clerk will close the roll. Ayes 45. Noes 2. Measure passes. Moving on to item number 112. AB 2033. The Clerk will read.\n\nEloise Gómez Reyes\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Madam Speaker and Members. AB 2033 will do two things. First of all, allow our students to use their EBT cards on campus. Ensure there's at least one vendor on campus that will accept it, and second, to make it more accessible. So they'll have a list of all the EBT accepting vendors off campus. We know that one third of all post secondary students in California do experience food insecurity and this Bill will help us to allow our students to focus on their education while having their basic needs met. This Bill has received bipartisan support in Committee. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nStephanie Nguyen\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing no others wishing to speak on this item, the Clerk will open the roll. All those votes who desire to vote. All those votes who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. The Clerk will close the roll. Ayes 61. Noes 0. Measure passes. Members without objection we are going to move to the majority leader for her motions.\n\nDamon Connolly\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Madam Speaker and members. Today I'm proud to present AB 2149 which will be known as Alex's law. In 2019, we suffered a tragedy in Marin County. Seven-year-old Alex Quanbeck was at his school playing with his friends and went to close a 300-pound gate to stop their football from rolling into the nearby alley. As he started to roll, the gate closed. The gate came off its rails and fell and crushed Alex, killing him.\n\nDamon Connolly\n\nLegislator\n\nThis, unfortunately, is not an uncommon occurrence in California and throughout the country. Without any protections, when a gate is poorly designed, damaged, or just overused, it has a risk of disconnecting from its supports and falling. AB 2149 calls for these gates to be installed with a positive stop, literally a $50 piece of metal that stops a gate from toppling over if it becomes separated from its track.\n\nDamon Connolly\n\nLegislator\n\nIt will be the responsibility of the gate owner to make sure their gate is inspected every five years, and local building officials will only have to become involved in egregious cases. We have worked to apply this bill only to those gates that are likely to impact the public at large, and I am committed to continuing to work with the opposition to mitigate their concerns. With this measure, we can make sure that no other family will have to face this kind of tragedy. Thank you and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nBut as every single one of us knows, so many of those bags are ending up in our waterways, in our landfills, and it just continues to be an additional source of waste. And so we are going to move to high recycled content paper bags, and we are going to have a cleaner future for all of our children.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nThis bill is supported by an incredibly broad coalition of people that I'm not sure I've ever seen come together in this Legislature. From the grocers to the environmentalists to the paper bag folks, they are all standing on arm in arm to move to a future without plastic bag bags in our grocery stores.\n\nSharon Quirk-Silva\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Madam Speaker. I also rise in support of AB 2236 Members, If you stay around long enough, you start to see legislation twist and turn. And I had the opportunity back in 2012-2013 when this legislation first came, and I was very skeptical of what would this plastic bag ban actually do?\n\nJoaquin Arambula\n\nLegislator\n\nThis Bill will require and authorize us to allow these residents to live in their homes year round and not to have to move 50 miles outside of the radius of the center in the off season. Thank you and I respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nWhat they don't tell you is that their acquisitions often use large amounts of debt, 60% to 80%, to finance purchases. On May 7, just two weeks ago, Stewart Healthcare, the struggling healthcare provider that relied on backing from private equity investors to quickly acquire dozens of community hospitals, including facilities in Massachusetts, Texas, and Florida, announced that it is filing for bankruptcy. Now the hospitals in these communities are at risk for closure.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nPrivate equity has inserted itself into every phase of our lives, from cradle to grave, beginning with reproductive healthcare, labor and delivery services, childcare, every aspect of healthcare, including nursing homes to hospice, and even funeral homes. As with all my legislation, I listen to all stakeholders and solicit their concerns and request for amendments, and we'll continue to do that through the process. But today, I'm asking for your aye vote.\n\nVince Fong\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Madam Speaker. Members, I rise in opposition to AB 3129. I have great respect for the author and the work he does in the healthcare space, but my fear is that this bill would hinder access to much-needed capital for healthcare entities in California. The message of this bill has a chilling effect, discouraging investment in California's healthcare infrastructure. Almost half of California's hospitals are losing money every single day while treating patients in our state. This bill gives the Attorney General new power to unilaterally and arbitrarily reject private funding and investment that can serve as a lifeline for struggling healthcare providers.\n\nVince Fong\n\nLegislator\n\nIn many cases, these resources are needed to expand access to healthcare. In my district, I have hospitals that need a lifeline, and private funding would help reverse course to keep these hospitals open. Access to healthcare in rural California is approaching a daunting cliff. There is already a shortage of physicians, and this Bbll, I'm afraid, would create a shortage of funding that could help guarantee access to emergency labor and delivery and General services for vulnerable Californians. Members, I ask for your no vote.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nMy concern is we are seeing in other states right now, private equity gobbling up small entities to then get to a point where they actually can control 50 plus percent of the market. What that does is that allows them to leverage insurance companies and leverage payers for higher rates. Private equity is about profit.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nThey're there for the short term. My concern is what happens when they leave. What does that hospital look like? What does that doctor's clinic look like? Does it still provide the same services that it once did? In many cases, it does not. And that's what we're trying to protect. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nTasha Boerner Horvath\n\nLegislator\n\nGood morning Mister Speaker and Members. I may not be as funny as the Member from Long Beach, but today I'm presenting a Bill that you've all seen before. AB 1992 would authorize the California Coastal Commission to add blue carbon demonstration projects to the suite of factors it considers for potential mitigation when improving coastal development permits where feasible. This Bill was amended to apply to non residential projects, which moved all opposition to a neutral position and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nTasha Boerner Horvath\n\nLegislator\n\nYes, Mister Speaker and Members, AB 2259 would require the California State Transportation Agency to develop an electronic bike safety handbook on or before September 1, 2025 that incorporates evidence based practices and emerging trends for bicycle and e-bike safety. We do not currently have one repository for all bikes in the state and this would create it. The electronic handbook would be available on the DMV, CHP, and state library websites. I respectfully ask for an aye vote. It's another day, another bike Bill.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing and hearing no further debate, the Clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll and tally the votes. Ayes 57, no zero. Measure passes. Just a note for those of you who are hungry.\n\nMatt Haney\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Mister speaker and Members. AB 2408 will protect our firefighters from cancer by ensuring their gear will be free of cancer causing materials. Firefighter gear has been found to contain significant levels of PFAS. This is partly due to the fact that PFAS is the only chemical currently being used to make the gear water resistant.\n\nCecilia Aguiar-Curry\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you. Members, we have been in session for 2 hours and have dispensed with 50 bills. To avoid lengthy session on Friday, we have set a goal to take up 200 bills today. So when we return from our caucus lunches, we need to pick up the pace so we can get out of here at a decent time this evening. Thanks.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nMembers, we'd like you to make your way to the floor. We would like to resume session. It's now 117 pm. Members, please make your way to the floor. We have a lot of work ahead of us. Thank you to the back from recess on time caucus.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing and hearing no further debate, the Clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. So far the vote is unanimous. We need some more Members. Mister Wallis was next in file order. Members please return to the floor. All those vote who desire to vote.\n\nMike Fong\n\nLegislator\n\nStudents over 25 are often independent and face greater financial obstacles, and students with dependents experience significant disparities when it comes to degree completion. Without better information on these students and their specific housing needs, we cannot craft the best policies. Assembly Bill 2707 will provide the necessary data to ensure that we serve these students appropriately. I respect the ask for an aye vote.\n\nSharon Quirk-Silva\n\nLegislator\n\nThere we go. Thank you. Mister Speaker, I rise to speak in support of Assembly Bill 3150 and would like to thank my colleague from winters for all of her hard work on this Bill. As a teacher for over 30 years, I know firsthand the challenges educators face, especially when it comes to balancing their careers with family responsibilities.\n\nSharon Quirk-Silva\n\nLegislator\n\nCurrently, the lack of guaranteed paid leave forces many educators to deplete their sick leave or rely on differential pay, which is often insufficient to cover their expenses. Members, I have a personal story here. As I was a teacher for almost 30 years and had indeed four pregnancies during that time.\n\nSharon Quirk-Silva\n\nLegislator\n\nWhen I compare that to my colleagues who did not have to take sick days, I ended up with very few days left out of my sick leave. As I came up here to the state to then work, I wanted to look at buying back some of that pregnancy leave to add to my retirement.\n\nSharon Quirk-Silva\n\nLegislator\n\nIt was $20,000 for those four pregnancies that I had to use all of my sick leaves. At a time when we are having national conversations about women staying home and possibly not working, we know that the teaching profession, which again, is mostly women, that even in that field there are disparities.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nIf you are in foster care in California, there are a number of counties who are applying for those benefits on your behalf and then not giving it to you, just incorporating it into their General Fund. There are other states who do this different. They set that money aside in a trust for the young people.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nThey use it only and exclusively for their uses. California should do the same. Stealing money from foster children isn't something we should do in a good budget year, or a bad budget year, or ever. And we have been doing it for way too long.\n\nJoe Patterson\n\nLegislator\n\nGreat. Thank you Mister speaker. Members, I rise in support of my colleague from Los Angeles. This measure, actually one of my constituents, James, came to testify on this Bill. As you know, many of you know that foster care has been a very important issue that I've been working on for a long time.\n\nJoe Patterson\n\nLegislator\n\nI supported a similar measure last year and he's been working on it very hard in my own family. One of my brothers was a recipient of survivor benefits, he wasn't in foster care. And so that money was able to go directly to our family to help support my brother.\n\nJoe Patterson\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd in this case, just because of, you know, well intended people, but just government bureaucracy. You know, oftentimes the money isn't going directly to benefit the child as they grow and become a human being. As you know, the deck is stacked against these children.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Mister Patterson. Seen in hearing no further debate, the Clerk will open the roll. All those in favor. All those vote who desire to vote? All those vote who desire to vote. You didn't want to close, you want to close. Too late. Sorry, my apologies Mister Bryan. All those vote who desire to vote.\n\nJosh Lowenthal\n\nLegislator\n\nAccording to the Anti Defamation League, there has been a 2000% increase in antisemitic incidents on California college campuses following October 7 compared to a year ago. Yes, I said a 2000% increase. Our communities are asking us what is being done to assure that Jewish students can attend classes and exist in the academic setting free from discrimination.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nTo prevent an eligible individual from falling into homelessness, The program will allow will provide an amount necessary to cover the portion of the person's housing not to exceed $2,000 as a one time subsidy or 2000 per month for the duration of up to two years. Various housing subsidy programs exist at the local and state level, but they're isolated and underfunded to have a meaningful impact.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nDespite California being a housing first state, there are at least 170,000 people experiencing homelessness, a staggering and disproportionate figure that amounts to 30% of the nation's homeless population. The philosophy behind AB 2498 is that it is more compassionate and more cost effective to prevent homelessness than to intervene after an individual or a family becomes unhoused.\n\nSharon Quirk-Silva\n\nLegislator\n\nWe know that even after the pandemic, millions of Californians continue to live in a State of emergency, struggling to keep up with housing and rent payments and at the risk of losing their place to live. Over the last several years, we have worked tirelessly to bring housing units to California for permanent support of housing.\n\nSharon Quirk-Silva\n\nLegislator\n\nHowever, we have not focused on prevention. We have not focused on using some of those billions of dollars, a very, very small percentage of our housing dollars, to keep people housed, as has been noted with many audits and reports, we can do better.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nSo this is very personal to me, but I know that's the story of many people that experienced this during COVID and so what we want to do with this Bill is to make it very clear that going forward, people do have a right to have that in person visit with a family member when we're talking about family members.\n\nMia Bonta\n\nLegislator\n\nGood afternoon, Mr. Speaker and members. I authored this bill because Black, Indigenous, and people of color communities experience higher rates of medical misdiagnoses and patient adverse events when compared to White patients. This bill requires hospital safety plans to include a process for addressing racism and discrimination and its impacts on patient health and safety, including monitoring socio-demographic disparities and patient safety events, developing interventions to remedy known disparities, and encouraging staff to report suspected instances of racism and discrimination. We can't solve the problems of racial bias and disparities in patient safety events until we have real data about the scope of the problem in California. This bill will help provide that data. I respectfully request your aye vote.\n\nEsmeralda Soria\n\nLegislator\n\nHowever, some health plans are not meeting this legal obligation. Many of our hospitals in California are experiencing financial distress and delays in getting paid and getting paid is further undermining their fiscal stability. This Bill is a sensible measure and ensures that providers are paid promptly for services that they provide. I respectfully ask for your Aye vote.\n\nPhilip Ting\n\nLegislator\n\nThis is really based on a report that came out from opportunity insights a year ago, demonstrating that people at the highest income level, at the top 1%, were much more likely to get into institutions of higher education simply because of their income background and potentially because of their donor background.\n\nPhilip Ting\n\nLegislator\n\nSo you can see clearly that the legacy category is more than double than African Americans and almost as many Latinos. This would even the playing field for everyone. At a time when it's very stressful to get into these elite institutions, we want to make sure that everyone's getting in because of their own merit, because of their grades, their test scores, what they provide to that institution, not because of their pocketbooks of their parents or their family members. With that, I respectfully ask for your vote on AB 1780.\n\nSharon Quirk-Silva\n\nLegislator\n\nBasically, my friends, this simply means we need to reinvest in the affordable housing that we do have so that we can continue to keep this affordable housing for those most in need. This Bill has enjoyed bipartisan support and has no opposition on file. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nFreddie Rodriguez\n\nLegislator\n\nTo keep up with the changing EMS landscape this Bill requires EMSA to conduct formal rulemaking to set PPE standards and requires that those standards be updated every five years. Please join me in supporting this legislation to ensure our EMS workers are safe and able to go out again and again to help those in need suffering from emergency. I respect you ask for your aye vote. Thank you.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing and hearing no further debate, the Clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote yes, they don't want to hear from you. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote, we'll close the roll and tally the votes. Aye's 61, no 0, measure passes. Moving to file item 233.\n\nEduardo Garcia\n\nLegislator\n\nThe second would be to translate their communications and the third would be about limiting the communications three years after being appointed to the Commission. This is a follow up to a Bill that was introduced and enacted into law in 2022. Respectfully asked for your aye vote. Thank you.\n\nLaurie Davies\n\nLegislator\n\nThe goal of CalWORKS is to do exactly that, assist Californians to get back on track and a path to a career or stable income. When we remove barriers that would otherwise preoccupy their time or energy, we allow them to focus on the job at hand. Lack of childcare options and flexibility should never be a hindrance to employment.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nJailers who you may have had assaults against jailers who may have committed misconduct against you, jailers who you may have filed petitions against. We know that these requests are often denied, ignored to such an extreme degree that women have created menstrual care products out of bed sheets. There are stories of hysterectomies.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nWhat this Bill does is it changes upon request to readily available, aligning us with other states across the country that do not make access to menstrual care contingent upon you asking your jailer, but readily available for the women who need it. This Bill has had bipartisan support thus far. I respectfully ask for aye vote.\n\nJuan Alanis\n\nLegislator\n\nOne, it would decrease the number of homeless youth experiencing food insecurity and two, it would increase access to employment opportunities and economic stability. This Bill will create a more comprehensive list of goals to address the needs of our homeless population, and I respectfully request your aye vote on this measure and thank you for your time.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker and members, I rise to present AB 2930. This is a bill that is aimed at ensuring that our communities trust the artificial intelligence tools that they interact with every day. This bill protects individuals from algorithmic discrimination by requiring requiring developers and deployers to assess these automated decision tools for discriminatory bias and mitigate accordingly. The bill is incredibly simple. It requires that if you are making a tool that affects people's consequential decisions, healthcare, housing, lending, that you run it through an impact assessment.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nYou make sure it's non-discriminatory and you don't deploy discriminatory tools. A study published in Science in 2019 showed that a clinical algorithm used across hospitals for determining patient care was racially biased against Black patients. In this case, the algorithm used had been trained on data and falsely concluded that black patients were healthier than equally sick white patients, depriving black patients from needed high-risk care. This was only because Black people had been denied care historically.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nSo we cannot train these tools with historically biased data and trust that they will make fair decisions for our communities. This bill is a framework to really move our state forward as it relates to the AI tools that interact with us most. And with that, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker and members, I'm pleased to present AB 1846, which strengthens training for California judges in order to better protect sexual violence survivors from further trauma. Unfortunately, we have seen way too many cases where those that have experienced sexual violence are in our courtrooms and do not get treated the way I know every single one of us would want them treated. And the person in that courtroom that is intended to protect those on the witness stand is the judge.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd so this is an incredibly simple bill that gives trauma-informed training through the already existing judges' training program to ensure that when someone who's experienced such violence is on the stand, the judge knows how to put the laws that are already in place into practice to protect those folks as they testify in the courtroom. With that, I respectfully ask your aye vote.\n\nGregg Hart\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I'm pleased to present Assembly Bill 1866, which addresses the urgent climate and public health crisis of idle oil wells. AB 1866 requires oil operators to develop a comprehensive plan to plug the estimated 40,000 idle oil wells in California. This bill also removes the option to pay as little as $150 per well to avoid submitting a plan. Over half of the idle wells in California have not produced oil in decades, according to state data. The number of idle wells continue to grow year after year. It may take over a century to plug all idle oil wells under current law.\n\nGregg Hart\n\nLegislator\n\nPlugging idle oil wells represents a significant opportunity to strengthen California's economy and create jobs. A recent study revealed that plugging these wells could create over 24,000 jobs statewide. Idle oil wells in California act as a major source of methane gas emissions, groundwater contamination, and air pollution. By one estimate, about two thirds of unplugged oil wells are leaking methane, a climate super pollutant over 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide. The facts are clear. This serious problem is getting worse and can't be ignored. AB 1866 is necessary to solve the idle well crisis in California.\n\nCorey Jackson\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you very much, Mister Speaker. AB 1877 will require a county probation officer to petition a court to seal records on any person previously adjudicated a ward of the court who has reached the age of 18 and who will no longer, who is no longer under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n\nBuffy Wicks\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Mister Speaker. I'm here to present 1893, a Bill to modernize the Builder's Remedy so that it is an effective tool to compel cities and counties to adopt their housing element. The current Builder's Remedy law is not working. It includes enough ambiguities that the projects are difficult to process and easy to delay, which turns off most investors and developers. It also includes includes provisions that make housing financially infeasible in most instances.\n\nBuffy Wicks\n\nLegislator\n\nWorking with our sponsor, Attorney General Rob Bonta, we have crafted a Bill that removes the ambiguity from the law and makes projects economically feasible so that all parties, the cities, the developers and the courts can see that this is a viable tool. This Bill, if it becomes law, will not apply to cities that have a compliant housing element. Our goal is that this doesn't have to apply to anyone because every city has a compliant housing element. With that, I respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n\nChris Ward\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Mister Speaker. I rise in support of AB 1893. Friends were not solving the housing crisis unless cities do their part to plan for and improve housing. This requires that they adopt and implement their housing element. But if that happens, this Bill never applies. But currently there's no real consequence if cities don't comply, except the risk of time consuming lawsuits from the Attorney General. This Bill would create a real consequence, which is making it easier to build housing if the city won't do it themselves. No one is defending bad actor cities who don't comply with the law.\n\nChris Ward\n\nLegislator\n\nEven the league's OUA letter is not focused on the Bill itself, but on improving the process to make it easier to get cities approved in the next housing cycle. And we all support that, and we all look forward to working with the league and HCD on improvements. But that's about a different Bill. AB 1893 creates accountability for bad actor cities, and that accountability is a pathway to the housing that our state desperately needs. I respectfully ask for your aye vote on AB 1893.\n\nGail Pellerin\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mister Speaker and Members. While the Child Welfare Indicators Project collects holistic data on academic performance, caregiver resources, and supportive care environments, a critical gap is that the Child Welfare Indicators Project does not include behavioral health outcomes. By amending the California Child and Family Service Review system to incorporate existing child and adolescent needs and strengths, behavioral health data AB 1907 will ensure holistic tracking, promote targeted services for children and youth, navigating the child welfare system, enable a nuanced assessment of needs and strengths, and foster targeted improvements. This Bill has bipartisan support, no opposition, and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nTina Mckinnor\n\nLegislator\n\nIt is time we hold all parties involved responsible for these tragedies in the hope that we can come together to prevent them in the future. And I respectfully ask for your I vote. Thank you, Assemblymember McKinner. Seeing and hearing no further debate, the Clerk will read, will open the roll. He can read too if he wants. So all those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nAfter an exhaustive review done in partnership with leading experts from UC, the EPA released a report in 2021 which concluded that the consumption of synthetic food dyes can result in hyperactivity and other neurobehavioral problems in some children. These conclusions are consistent with those reached by other nations. Indeed, in many other nations, these additives are either restricted, banned from food entirely, or require specific warning labels noting their harm to children\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nTo be clear, this Bill will not ban any foods, nor it will result in any products coming off the shelf. It simply encourages food manufacturers to switch to safer, alternative ingredients, like they already do in Europe if they want their foods to be served in our public schools. Finally, it's important to note that the Bill would impact less than 5% of products served in schools. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of school foods are already free from these dangerous chemicals, and there are plenty of safer and cheaper alternatives already available.\n\nHeath Flora\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mister Speaker. I rise in support of this Bill, and I know the author is out right now, but we've spoken to him a couple times on this Bill and he is committed to continue to work on this Bill and try to address some of the concerns the opposition has. So I just look forward to continuing to work with him and see if we can address those concerns in the Senate.\n\nJuan Carrillo\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mister Speaker. This is a difficult Bill for me. As the father of four, my top priority husband will always be the safety of our children, and I have the utmost respect for the author and I know his heart is in the right place. However, I also know there has been a lot of uncertainty and doubt about the ingredients that are covered in this Bill and has drafted the implications for many of the food and beverage that we'll enjoy would be banned from school campuses, leaving our children with less choice and more expensive options. It is my understanding that amendments have been discussed to limit the scope of the Bill to chose what's on the food tray. While I have the utmost respect for the author, I would like to see some of these changes be made so that I can support the Bill. Thank you.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nYes. Thank you. I want to thank our colleague from Lodi for standing up in support of this Bill and reiterate what he said, which is I know Mister Gabriel has committed to continuing to work on the Bill. And just to address what our colleague from Palmdale said, I think it's critically important to understand the parents across the state are making choices about what foods we serve our children to make sure that they're healthy in the way we want, and then we send them to school. And now we provide school meals to every single California student, and we don't control what's in those foods.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd for parents whose kids are struggling in the classroom with things like ADHD and they're responding to a diet free of these additives, it feels like the right choice to not have those provided in our schools so the parents can make a holistic choice for their children. And again, it will not touch the things on our grocery store shelves. This is very narrow in scope to ensure parents can ensure that their kids who need these kind of changes are getting them in, in every setting. With that, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nWendy Carrillo\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker and Members. Today, I am proud to present AB 1950, the Chavez Ravine Accountability Act. This bill acknowledges the historical displacement of the Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop communities known today commonly as Chavez Ravine. Sponsored by the California Department of Insurance and our Insurance Commissioner, Ricardo Lara, AB 1950 is a critical step forward and aims to correct an injustice that displaced families and has lingered on the shadows of Los Angeles East Side history for far too long.\n\nMarie Waldron\n\nLegislator\n\nThe reentry officer will report annually on progress and challenges faced. In addition to policy development, the position will coordinate with local nonprofits to provide access to job training, housing, substance use, and mental health treatments. This initiative will reduce recidivism rates by raising awareness of services to those who otherwise might not have the means to successfully reintegrate into society. Thank you and I respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n\nStephanie Nguyen\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing no others wishing to speak on this item, the Clerk will open the roll. All those votes who desire to vote? All those votes who desire to vote. All those votes who desire to vote, the Clerk will close the roll Ayes. 57 no zero measure passes we are going to move back to item number 275, AB 2061.\n\nCommittee Secretary\n\nPerson\n\nSeeing no others wishing to speak on this item, the Clerk will open the roll.

Item number 281, AB 2085.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nAbout a year ago, I was sitting with one of my local Planned Parenthood affiliates, talking to them about what they went through and to hear the stories of clinic after clinic that was being denied by local planning commissions and the like just because they didn't believe in the healthcare that was being provided inside the doors of the clinic.\n\nStephanie Nguyen\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing no others wishing to speak, the Clerk will open the roll. All those votes who desire to vote. All those votes who desire to vote. All those votes who desire to vote. All those votes who desire to vote, the Clerk will close the roll. Ayes 59. Noes 0. On the urgency. No urgency. Measure passes and we are going to jump on to item number 438, AB 2902.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing and hearing no further debate, the clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll and tally the vote. Ayes: 66; no: zero. Measure passes. Moving back in the file to File Item 92: AB 1826 by Assembly Member Holden, presented by Assembly Member Bonta. The clerk will read.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Assemblymember Bonta. Seeing and hearing no further debate, the Clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll and tally the votes. Ayes 42. Noes 14. Measure passes. Moving back in file order to file item 286, AB 2108 by Assemblymember Ramos.\n\nJames Ramos\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. AB 2108, the Luke Madrigal Act, is a continuation of our efforts to combat an epidemic in Indian Country on missing and murdered indigenous people. The bill sets out to ensure we as a state are doing what is necessary to ensure missing children are found as quickly as possible by utilizing the notification of the supportive people in their lives.\n\nJames Ramos\n\nLegislator\n\nFor Native American children, they enter the system at the highest rate of any racial group, and going missing while in foster care is a critical pipeline to the high rates of missing and murdered indigenous persons, which California still resides as number five of all the states of not investigating those murders. This is a shameful reputation for the state to have. I ask for your aye vote on AB 2108.\n\nPilar Schiavo\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker and Members. This is a bill I'm very excited to present. This is actually a bill that the idea came from my daughter when I was running for office. She asked what we'd be able to do, and I said we can create laws. And she said, well, can you do a law to ban homework?\n\nPilar Schiavo\n\nLegislator\n\nWhich is probably every fourth grader's dream. No, we're not doing a bill to ban homework, but we are doing a bill to make sure that we have healthy homework practices. So AB 2999, the Healthy Homework Act, is brought forward with the intention of starting a new conversation about the real impacts of homework.\n\nPilar Schiavo\n\nLegislator\n\nA conversation that I, many of the teachers and parents that I've spoken to, believe is long overdue. Students are the only ones that we ask to work three shifts. They go to school all day, they go to after school activities, and then they come home, and they work all night on homework.\n\nPilar Schiavo\n\nLegislator\n\nHomework is a top three stressor overall in kids lives, and it's often number one. And so we know that by addressing homework loads, we can, overnight, address the stress in kids lives. And excessive homework worsens educational gaps when we know that those exist because of inequities like lack of technology, lack of support at home, lack of access to printers and supplies to make projects at home.\n\nJosh Lowenthal\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Very proud to be a joint author of AB 2999. And I just want to reinforce that this is ultimately a matter of local control. That this is not superseding any policy that local districts can make on homework. It's simply pointing out that they need to make a policy around it, and that policy can be what works best for that district as they determine it. Very proud to stand with families and stand with this bill. Thank you.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Lowenthal. Seeing and hearing no further debate, the Clerk will open the roll. All those votes desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll and tally the votes. Ayes 57, noes zero. Bill passes. About 50 years too late for me, but I appreciate the effort. It feels too late for me. Moving to file item 287, Assembly Bill 2109 by Assembly Member Juan Carrillo.\n\nJuan Carrillo\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Mister Speaker. I rise to present AB 2109, a measure that seeks to treat industrial process heat recovery as an energy efficient technology and would therefore remove the punitive departing load charge. The California cement industry must be carbon neutral by 2045 and one lever that can be utilized right now to achieve that goal is industrial process heat recovery. However, the departing law charges the biggest barrier as to why the industry is not already utilizing this technology.\n\nJuan Carrillo\n\nLegislator\n\nUnder their normal course of business, cement and steel manufacturers produce excess heat that is currently not being captured. This measure will allow these industries to capture this heat and create carbon free electricity without being penalized. My Bill specifically states that this electricity can only be consumed on site and cannot exceed 25% of the installing customers peak electrical load. This means that none of the electrical generated electricity will go back to the grid.\n\nJuan Carrillo\n\nLegislator\n\nToday, there are only seven cement keels and one steel manufacturer left in California. This Bill seeks to help ensure these industries and the jobs they produce for so many so that they can stay in a golden state. As we have seen, four cement and four steel facilities closed since 2006. Members have respectfully asked for your aye vote.\n\nEduardo Garcia\n\nLegislator\n\nThis bill was introduced to give the Legislature an opportunity through the Policy Committee process to hear from stakeholders and make further enhancements and refinements to the Governor's proposal to address issues that were raised by stakeholders and the Legislature. There were a set of amendments that have addressed a number of concerns raised by stakeholders across the spectrum.\n\nEduardo Garcia\n\nLegislator\n\nWhile we are not finished with this work, a few issues that remain are before us. However, I believe we have reached a milestone. Instead of groups working against a bill, stakeholders are working with us. With your help, we can move this bill to the next phase, which is further discussions with the Administration and the Senate. Respectfully ask for your aye vote. This is a 54-vote bill. Appreciate your attention on this matter.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nYes, thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to this bill, and just, I mean, I want to once again be the voice of agriculture in this Legislature. This will increase the mill tax on pesticides used in agriculture. I would say that the stakeholders from the agricultural community do not feel like they've been at the table, do not feel like this is moving in the right direction.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd, I mean, I've said this in Committee and I think--and I appreciate actually a lot of the Members, both sides of the aisle that have come up and talked to me about this as well. I think we've had some good conversations, but understand that every time we add more cost to farmers in this state, it's not like we get to pass that on and we can just charge a higher cost for our goods. We are totally dependent upon world markets.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nSo when you talk about, right now, walnuts in this state are at 30 cents a pound. That's the price that you get, period. You don't get to raise it. And at 30 cents a pound, you are losing money. Many other commodities across the state are down. The commodity price is down. All of your prices and your costs are up.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nYour insurance, all those things are at all-time highs. Inflation has affected us too on all those goods and all those inputs: fertilizer, all the things that go into farming. Fuel. You know, and we don't, you know, we have diesel and gas. Like that's--you're paying that.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nSo when you say, 'oh hey, it's no big deal. We can just add this mill tax assessment on no problem; you can handle it,' you can't. Like you're breaking the back of agriculture and making it very hard to produce food. Why is that a problem? Well, I mean, we grow some of the world's food here in California.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nThere's only so many places in the world that you can grow these foodstuff. So not only are we missing out on some of the highest quality food in the world, but so would people throughout the nation, so would people in nations where they can't depend upon these foodstuffs coming to them.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nSo I would really encourage people to think about that. And as we consider this, this takes a two-thirds vote. I don't think we need to rush this thing through and push this thing through today, and I would encourage this Legislature to really listen to some of those voices and not pass this bill today. Thank you.\n\nSteve Bennett\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Chair and Members. I'd just like to speak in support of the bill and point out one simple thing, and that is the mill tax. It's been decades since the mill tax has been changed, and we have this problem of we make no change, we get way behind. So it's just appropriate for us to do this update after decades of no change in the mill tax. Thank you.\n\nEduardo Garcia\n\nLegislator\n\nI want to, I want to address him directly because the fact of the matter is that there have been numerous stakeholder meetings, specifically with the agricultural industry, and of course no one likes any fee increase, but what has been agreed upon is that there is a need for greater oversight, accountability, people, operational activity at this Department in order to fulfill the objectives, the mission of this agency, and that's something that all stakeholders have come to an understanding.\n\nEduardo Garcia\n\nLegislator\n\nI feel like the work of the people around the table, again, industries, environmental groups, the ESTM consultants who have been putting a lot of work into this from day one, I don't know; somewhat a bit disrespected by the fact that, you know, people are not being regarded for that work.\n\nEduardo Garcia\n\nLegislator\n\nThe fact that none of you received the NASCAR letter from stakeholders across the state saying that they're opposed to this should tell you that the work that's being done has been constructive and productive, and the alternative to that is a budget trailer bill where policy is being proposed and a fee is also being integrated.\n\nEduardo Garcia\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd of course, we all like budget trailer bills when our policies are in there or our budget asks are in there, but when they're not, right, we don't like that, and so I put forward this bill so that we could have a deliberate policy debate and discussion. Appreciate having it here on this floor.\n\nJames Ramos\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Mister Speaker. I rise to present AB 2138 which would create a three year pilot project with the Department of Justice granting tribes peace officer status. We have had many roundtables on this issue, one where we heard stories from a young Yurok tribal member who struggled to recount her own family's history in the traumatic past experience due to Public Law 280. Public Law 280 was created by the Federal Government that stripped policing authority away from six states, and California is one of them.\n\nJames Ramos\n\nLegislator\n\nThat law was not created to protect tribal Indian people. It was created to protect the non Indian people from the Indians themselves. That's how far back we have to go to reverse this discrimination against Native American people. That's why we're here today. This Bill is a part of an ongoing area of addressing missing and murdered indigenous people. Tribal policing in California carries a dark history, a history that we must begin to shed light on with the support of this body. With the passage of Public Law 280, the state essentially washed their hands of policing tribal reservations.\n\nJames Ramos\n\nLegislator\n\nOne of the top recommendations of tribal governments and tribal leaders is to grant peace officer status, as other states have done. Granting peace officer status will not only help our tribal governments here in the State of California, it will also ensure that when we talk about public safety for all, that it truly addresses California's first people. This is a chance to move forward against some of the dark histories, not only in the state but this nation. I ask for your aye vote in AB 2138.\n\nTimothy Grayson\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker and Members. AB 2144 helps promote accountability for existing laws and improves accessibility in the housing development process. This bill will ensure that local jurisdictions are following existing laws by requiring that they show in an annual progress report that they are properly posting online information on impact fees and providing online permitting tools. It is my hope that AB 2144 will be a useful tool to improve accessibility in the housing development process. Thank you, and I ask for an aye vote. Thank you.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Grayson. Seeing and hearing no further debate, Clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll and tally the votes. Ayes 54, noes zero. Measure passes. Bouncing back in the order to file item 150.\n\nDawn Addis\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, it has been acknowledged and documented that eight of the 20 largest wildfires in California's recorded history have occurred in the past seven years. This body has deliberated, supported, and voted on measures that try to strike the right balance between public safety and environmental protection.\n\nDawn Addis\n\nLegislator\n\nAs voting Members, in many instances, we look to the expertise of our local governments, who are often on the front lines of wildfire preparedness. Unfortunately, many of our local entities have expressed concerns that long delays and a lack of guidance are preventing local jurisdictions from being able to conduct wildfire preparedness activities on lands located in fire hazard severity zones that are adjacent to urban areas.\n\nDawn Addis\n\nLegislator\n\nOnce a completed ITP application is submitted, CDFW must process them within 45 days. Two, having approved applications receive a five year permit for wildfire preparedness activities to occur within the fire hazard severity zones. And three, requiring CDFW to post a summary of these efforts on their webpage on an annual basis. This bill has no opposition, and with that, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nCecilia Aguiar-Curry\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Mister Speaker and Members. The issue of organic waste, including ag waste and forest biomass, is one I've been working on since I came to the Capitol in 2016. You know, as I drive around my district, I see fruit and nut trees being pulled up, piled and burned because there's nowhere for this waste to go. Communities like the rural areas in my district have been struggling to find ways to divert their organic waste from landfills. We need to put that waste to beneficial, climate friendly use. First, we codify Federal Government definitions of pyrolysis.\n\nCecilia Aguiar-Curry\n\nLegislator\n\nIt does not change how pyrolysis is permitted or regulated, but helps people know what projects count as pyrolysis projects here. Second, this Bill allows communities to get procurement credit for projects that use only organic waste to generate green energy. Finally, this Bill will ask CalRecycle to consider the lifecycle effects of projects when it makes decisions on incentive funding. This is a technology neutral way of making sure that our waste disposal processes are climate friendly.\n\nCecilia Aguiar-Curry\n\nLegislator\n\nI have already taken many amendments to narrow the Bill and address opposition concerns, and I commit to keep working with opposition if this Bill passes off the floor today. This Bill will help reduce future emissions by helping divert organic waste from landfills, and it will help increase energy reliability and resiliency in those communities that need it most. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing and hearing no further debate, Clerk will open the roll on the trifecta. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. This Bill requires 54 votes members and it got 60 plus. Quickly as I might add. Clerk will close the roll and tally the votes. Ayes 62, noes zero.\n\nJoaquin Arambula\n\nLegislator\n\nThis bill will direct the Department of Healthcare Services to partner with the UC to develop a plan to create the Center for Mental Health Wellness and Innovations, which will promote evidence based practices to improve behavioral health services and to transform and change our behavioral health service delivery. I thank you and respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Assemblymember Reyes. Seeing and hearing no further comments, we will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll and tally the votes. Aye 60, no 0. Measure passes.\n\nPhilip Ting\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. AB 2178 is a structured approach to address the state's empty prison bed issue by setting a maximum bed threshold per fiscal year. Currently, the LAO estimates that we have about 13,000 empty prison beds, and they're projecting by 2028 that we'll have up to 18,000 empty prison beds.\n\nPhilip Ting\n\nLegislator\n\nThat's the equivalent of this year, about four to five full prisons, and by 2028, about six to seven prisons. At a time when we're facing massive, massive deficits, we're making tough choices, whether we fund our developmentally disabled community centers, whether we fund health care, whether we fund food, whether we fund education, and meanwhile, this department is protecting empty prison beds.\n\nPhilip Ting\n\nLegislator\n\nSo at this point, we are asking for a plan to consolidate over time. This is a step-down period of the next couple years. LAO estimates that by closing five prisons, we can save up to a billion dollars annually. This is a common sense, fiscally responsible bill. Respectfully ask for an aye vote on AB 2178.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I stand in strong support of AB 2178. Right now, at this moment, there are 15,000 empty prison beds and growing. Without letting a single new person come home into our communities, just by closing the empty prison beds, we could save a billion dollars of a year for our struggling communities.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nInstead, we are debating issues like cutting money for our foster youth, cutting money for our special needs community, cutting money for our schools, cutting money for the communities that we have neglected and divested from every time we have a downturn economically. We can't continue this approach while we run this kind of an over-bloated prison system. This is a smart, thoughtful approach by our former Budget Chair, and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nBill Essayli\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Chair. I rise in opposition. I would note they're not saying we're closing prisons because crime is down. We're not closing prisons because there's less convicted criminals. We're closing prisons because we've stopped sending criminals to prison. Our crime is up. Violent crime is up. Property crime is up. You go talk to any normal person out in the community. They are outraged with the state of public safety. That's why the voters want to repeal Prop 47. But what is the cost of crime to our community?\n\nBill Essayli\n\nLegislator\n\nWhat is the cost to businesses in California? You want to talk about affording, you know, the cost of these prison spaces, there's a cost to crime, and that needs to be considered as well. So I pose this. I don't believe that we have too many prisoners. We have let out half the prisoners.\n\nBill Essayli\n\nLegislator\n\nWe let out almost 90,000 prisoners. We used to have 180,000 prisoners. We are down to 90,000 prisons because we changed the laws, we don't send felons to prison anymore, we're sending them to county jail, and it is really with exception that you get sent to prison. So we need to change our policies and we need to save these bed spaces because the tide is turning and we will start sending criminals back to prison soon. Mark my words. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\n\nPhilip Ting\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. Just to answer or talk to about my colleague from Riverside, let me just start with a few facts. Crime is significantly down from the seventies and eighties. We're going to talk about facts, not opinions. What we have seen is he's correct that from the population was at 160,000, it's down to 93,000 right now.\n\nPhilip Ting\n\nLegislator\n\nDuring that same ten-year period since I've been in the Legislature, prison spending has gone up from ten billion to 15 billion. So let me just repeat that. As the population was going down, the budget went up 50 percent. So there's definitely room for improvement, room to cut spending.\n\nPhilip Ting\n\nLegislator\n\nThere's no reason that we can't curb this empty prison beds. Again, 13,000 prison beds or 15,000 prison beds is roughly the equivalent of four to five empty prisons today. This is fiscally responsible. We're making tough choices, as my colleague from LA said. Are we going to fund foster kids? Are we going to help the homeless? Are we going to give people food? Or are we going to go protect these empty prison beds? With that, respectfully ask for your aye vote on AB 2178.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Ting. The clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote.\n\nAnthony Rendon\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mister Speaker. AB 2202 requires that California's short term vacation rentals must inform guests what cleaning chores they will be asked to complete before they book the rental. We'll also require that any penalties renters might incur if they fail to complete these cleaning tasks be outlined to guests in advance. This Bill has received bipartisan support. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nMarc Berman\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. California has always been a leader when it comes to protecting our elections and our democracy. Due to the alarming rise in threats and attacks against election and poll workers, there's been a nationwide exodus of workers from the job, including here in California.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing and hearing no further debate, the Clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. This is a 54 vote bill, Members. There we go.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing and hearing no further debate, the Clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll and tally the votes. Ayes 56, no's, 4. Measure passes. We're now jumping ahead a little bit to File Item 385.\n\nAlex Lee\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. AB 2584 will protect limited stock of homes for working families by banning large corporations that own a 1000, 1000 single family houses or more from purchasing additional single family houses. Prices reflect the shortage. In spite of mortgage interest rates reaching multi-decade highs, home prices continue to climb. A recent report from the California Association of Realtors states that only 15% of all Californians can afford to buy a house at current costs.\n\nAlex Lee\n\nLegislator\n\nSo at a time when for sale homes have never been more scarce, it has been more important to protect the supply of ownership properties. Large real estate investment firms have gone on a buying spree amidst the shortages, especially after the Great Recession. Firms that can be best described as housing shortage profiteers have taken advantage of the lack of new supply by buying single family homes in an effort to cash in on rising rents.\n\nAlex Lee\n\nLegislator\n\nIn their own investor reports, Invitation Homes, which owns nearly 15,000 homes in California, has told their shareholders that, \"we operate in markets with strong demand drivers, high barriers to entry, and high rent growth potential.\" These firms aren't driving down costs. They are hoping to cash in on the crisis. AB 2584 will give homebuyers a fairer playing field and a better opportunity for families to buy their first home, building the stability and generational wealth that ownership can provide. Respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nTasha Boerner Horvath\n\nLegislator\n\nYes, colleagues, I rise and support and soon to be added as a co-author of AB 2584. As you all know, I am a renter in a coastal city. This bill would stifle the increasing commercialization of housing where corporations are buying up single family homes, which may or may not be rented.\n\nTasha Boerner Horvath\n\nLegislator\n\nThat drives up my rental price in an already expensive area. And as a single mom, and as we all know what we earn here on this floor, I could never compete with the capital that a corporation has, thereby making my dream of home ownership ever more distant. So for me and every renter in the State of California and every hopeful future homeowner, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nLori Wilson\n\nLegislator\n\nMr. Speaker, Members, I rise in opposition to AB 2584. As I've said on the floor before with bill, a bill that was very similar to this. It doesn't do what you are expecting it to do. By the author's own admission in the analysis and the comments, he noted that only 1% of these types of corporate investors have homes in California. So if it's only 1%, there is not that level of control.\n\nLori Wilson\n\nLegislator\n\nNow, I do admit that there are issues where you see corporations coming in with cash offers that are more attractive than what your average buyer comes in with. That, we can deal with that issue. But this is not the tool to deal with this particular issue.\n\nLori Wilson\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd I regularly say when it comes to housing, we need to have every tool at our disposal to allow the flexibility, whether it be local agencies, homebuyers, affordable corporations, nonprofit corporations doing housing, to be able to increase housing production in this state, to increase the opportunity for people to have the most essential need, which is shelter.\n\nLori Wilson\n\nLegislator\n\nBut this is definitely not the way to do it. I think this constrains our housing production, and I think it does the exact opposite of what it's intended to do, which would be, which we all should support. We should all should support increasing the home supply in the State of California. Definitely creating wealth and creating home ownership opportunities. But this tool doesn't belong in the toolbox. So with that, I respectfully ask for opposition to AB 2584.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Members. I also rise in opposition. And I agree with my colleague from Fairfield. You know, this is a very small niche part of the housing market right now. It is a newer thing. And as was said, that we're talking about less than 1% of all the single family homes owned in this state. Overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly, they are owned by family members, by individuals, families who move into those homes. And that's a great thing. But some people, and especially right now, think about it.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nWith the high interest rates, with maybe not having that initial down payment, high cost of living right now, this is an easier option for people to get into a home is to is to rent the rent this home, maybe from a company that's renting out single family homes, maybe from just a mom and pop person.\n\nJames Gallagher\n\nLegislator\n\nBut the bottom line is this is an opportunity. And for those that maybe can't, aren't in that position to buy, they have this ability now to rent, you know, in a neighborhood, in a single family home. Why not have all those options on the table instead of thwarting that with this, with this government policy? So I think it's, I think it's misguided. I get where it's coming from, but I think ultimately misguided and will lead to less housing options, you know, for people in this state. So I urge your no vote. Thank you.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I rise in support of AB 2583. And I appreciate my colleague from up north for describing the conditions that only five of us in the entire Legislature live with. And that is the status of being renters who are seeking to buy their first time home. And part of the struggle with doing that is because we have corporate entities that are buying entire neighborhoods.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nA significantly large percentage and growing percentage of South LA in particular is owned by a single entity, a corporate entity that is exacerbating the displacement, exacerbating the push out, controlling and manipulating what should be a fair market, and making it more difficult for first time home buyers to buy in to that market.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nThat is part of the push out that my colleagues across the aisle have been talking about for the last several years. Part of the decline in California's population is because home ownership is a dream that's unattainable at this point. And part of the reason it's unattainable is because you're competing with multibillion dollar, multinational corporations that can buy the entire neighborhood. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nChris Ward\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Speaker. I also rise and support of this bill. A little groundhog day because it is similar to another way that we're trying to tackle the very same issue. And we've had this conversation in January on the floor here today.\n\nChris Ward\n\nLegislator\n\nYou heard a number here today, and I wanted to make sure you heard another number, because there's a lot of ways that you can spin a number out there about what the percentage of homes are. While some are asserting that might only be 1% of the stock, it's 1% of the total stock that you see out there today. And even that is still under review.\n\nChris Ward\n\nLegislator\n\nBut what we do know from industry's own data is that in the first quarter of this year, of 2024, 35% of the home purchases have been done by corporations as defined. So that number is increasing. And if you are ready to wait for the lifetime for your kids and your grandkids a generation from now, for that number of total homeownership to go from 1% to 35%, the trend is there. And so again, we have to recognize what's right in front of us and what we see accelerating.\n\nChris Ward\n\nLegislator\n\nWe have to make sure that, again, according to this bill, we're looking at the large corporate owners, those that have more than 1000 homes in their portfolio, and say we have got to use our power within our own law to help to level the playing field so that renters and would be California individual homeowners and families have a fighting chance to compete.\n\nChris Ward\n\nLegislator\n\nThat's what this bill is for. And just like my bill got off the Assembly floor, and I've had the opportunity to work with opposition and we are improving upon it in the Senate, I hope you do the same and vote yes on AB 2584 today.\n\nBill Essayli\n\nLegislator\n\nMr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. I do not think... With respect to my colleague from Yuba City, the American dream is to own a single family home and to raise a family. That dream is slipping away. People cannot afford homes. What's being offered to Americans right now is to live in a box, live in an apartment near, near a train track. I know that's the policy of this Legislature, but I don't like that. So I do not want us to be in a permanent state of rentership.\n\nBill Essayli\n\nLegislator\n\nMost people, the only wealth they ever accumulate in life is through owning property. So I believe we should be selling dozens of condos and homes and I do not... I am a capitalist but I don't believe in unlimited capitalism. And these big corporations, the BlackRocks, these investment firms, they see an opportunity to make a lot of money by making us permanent renters, and they're buying up the supply because they have the means to do it, and then they will make us into renters.\n\nBill Essayli\n\nLegislator\n\nI just saw an advertisement for a development where they built a bunch of new homes, and it said homes for rent. So they're building new homes now. They're not even selling them, they're going to rent them to you. And guess what? Every year they'll raise the rent. So I want Americans to own homes, and I actually support this policy and I want to make sure that it's tight, so these corporations don't start subdividing and own 999 homes and then open another one. So I'll support it. I think it's a good policy.\n\nSteve Bennett\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. speaker. I was going to rise and remind my colleagues from the other side that sometimes the free market just unfettered is not appropriate. But I'm going to defer my comments because one of the colleagues from the other side said so many of the things for me. Thank you very much.\n\nAlex Lee\n\nLegislator\n\nI thank our colleagues for such a robust discussion about this topic. And just a polite reminder as also, and I thank my fellow renter legislators for speaking up, is that this bill does not bar mom and pop landlords from renting out their spare houses. In fact, in Sacramento, I live in a house from just a guy who has a second house. And that's just how it is. This bill is narrowly targeted about corporations, entities have a thousand or more single family homes. And if they average about a million dollars each, that's a billion dollars worth of assets.\n\nAlex Lee\n\nLegislator\n\nA billion dollars worth of assets. And what we are saying is that let the market be fair. That hardware Californians can compete openly with each other and not with a Blackstone or BlackRock of the world. And really, this is about making sure this phenomena doesn't grow. This is a kind of what you're seeing in red states, blue states, and across the south, and the northeast as well, because it's a growing trend. While the housing scarcity is increasing, there are certain actors that are cashing in on this scarcity.\n\nAlex Lee\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd to some of my colleagues points, this bill I am going to be amending more to make sure that it's not about additive units. This is a practice about buying a home sale unit and converting into a rental unit. There is no net increase of units in the market. In fact, you're decreasing one at the expense of the other. But we want to make sure we're enabling good faith actors who want to increase supply. So with that, respectfully ask for your aye vote. Thank you.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Lee. Seeing and hearing no further debate, the Clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll and tally the votes. Ayes 46, noes 11. Bill passes. Catch our... Yes, Ms. Bauer-Kahan.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Mister Speaker and Members, you see what happens when you ask nicely. I am proud to present AB 2214. This is an incredibly important Bill that takes on the urgent and pervasive threat to both our environment and our health. Microplastics. These tiny particles are found in waterways across the state and in our bodies. A global study found that on average people are ingesting 5 grams of plastic through these microplastics every week.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nThat means you are eating the equivalent of a credit card every single week. And so this Bill is very simple. It actually ensures that this problem, which has been spread across California agencies, ensures that the agencies that have responsibility over microplastics in our water work together to solve the problem. So it is a good government solution that will hopefully start to target this pervasive problem. With that, I respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing and hearing no further debate, the Clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll and tally the vote. Ayes 59. Noes 7. Bill passes. Mister Garcia would like to lift the call.\n\nCecilia Aguiar-Curry\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mister Speaker and Members. This Bill aims to help California youth who receive specialty mental health services through counties. When youth move from county to county, their mental health care is halted while they reestablish eligibility for services. This results in a gap in mental health care that can burden families and risk minors entering the foster care system. AB 2237 requires that DHCS issues guidance to support counties to coordinate and expediate the transfer of specialty mental health services from one county to another. This Bill received unanimous support in Assembly Health and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing and hearing no further debate, the Clerk will open the roll.

Raise your microphone and I will recognize you. We are not leaving folks. We've still got work to do. But just to pause. Catch our breath a little bit.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nOkay, just to kind of level set here, we have disposed of 164 Bills so far. We are not done. We're pushing forward so that we can have a shorter Thursday and a very short Friday. So with your indulgence, let's move back into daily file. Moving to file item 310. Assembly Bill 2245 by Assemblymember Juan Carrillo. Clerk will read.\n\nJuan Carrillo\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you Mister Speaker. I rise to present Assembly Bill 2245. This is a straightforward ... Bill that would provide ... teachers employed by regional occupation centers or programs permanency. When employees are able to be granted a classification of permanent this means they are no longer employed at will and are no longer on their initial probation and able to receive due process. Permanency allows for basic labor rights such as notice of discipline or layoff and their procedures for appeal. It does not mean that teachers cannot be terminated for cost or if their program is cancelled or reduced. I urge your aye vote.

Measure passes.\n\nJames Ramos\n\nLegislator\n\nWell, thank you, Mister Speaker. I rise today to present AB 2279 on behalf of our colleague from Riverside. As you may know, California ranks fifth in the country with the most cases of missing and murder indigenous girls, women and people. Since 2015, there are an average 18 new missing and murder indigenous person cases documented every year in California. All of these cases. Of all these cases, only 21% have had a response by the criminal justice system. AB 2279 will establish a Bureau of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Person within the Department of Justice.\n\nJames Ramos\n\nLegislator\n\nThis Bill will allow the bureau to provide assistance in investigating missing and murdered indigenous persons cases in California when appropriate, including cases involving human trafficking. This bureau would be empowered to facilitate collaboration between victims families, tribal governments and different law enforcement agencies. Over the last several decades, the size and scale of the crisis of MMIP has become clearer and clearer across the nation. We must do better for our tribal communities in the State of California and across the nation, especially for our young women and girls. I ask for your aye vote on AB 2279.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing and hearing no further debate, Clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote.

File item 320, AB-2285 by Assemblymember Rendon.\n\nAnthony Rendon\n\nLegislator\n\nBy codifying the Governor's Outdoors for All Initiative, this bill asks us to balance funding and policy decisions as they relate to our actions to protect, conserve, and restore nature in all settings. By taking the type of comprehensive approach envisioned in this bill, we are making a stronger commitment to protecting vulnerable communities and providing greater access to nature across California. I ask for your aye vote on AB 2285.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you. Thank you, Mr. Rendon. Seeing and hearing no further debate, clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote.

AB 2286 will assure California has an intentional and safe transition to autonomous technology as it is integrated into vehicles over 10,000 pounds. This bill requires a human safety operator on board to respond to emergency situations and a more transparent process for the final decision--before the final decision is made to remove humans from large vehicles in our state.\n\nTom Lackey\n\nLegislator\n\nYeah, just real quickly. As you all know, traffic safety is very important to me and I feel somewhat qualified to speak to it, and we're not against the further evaluation of autonomous vehicles. All we're asking for is we learn from the past mistakes. Just in the sedans, we've seen loss of life.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Mr. Lackey.

This Bill simply extends the deadline to allow the growth model to be included in the dashboard and I thank you and respectfully ask for NY vote seeing.\n\nCommittee Secretary\n\nPerson\n\nSeen and hearing no further debate, Clerk will open the roll.

It is California's most populated census designated area with close to 120,000 residents, 95.5 of whom are Latino. Yet this vibrant community, most of you know East Los Angeles, East LA is without any local representation.\n\nWendy Carrillo\n\nLegislator\n\nThey want transparency, accountability regarding how their tax dollars are being spent and how they could be more engaged than involved in infrastructure project economic development, small business development, workforce development and overall better the county service is already being provided. AB-2986 is a district study Bill. It does not mandate cityhood.\n\nWendy Carrillo\n\nLegislator\n\nThis Bill has received unanimous bipartisan support and at the end of the day, what we want to encourage is members and residents having autonomy, having the opportunity to be able to be involved in their local government. The last time that this was made even a possibility for residents of East Los Angeles was 1975.\n\nWendy Carrillo\n\nLegislator\n\nYou cannot continue to tell a community that they are too poor, that they are not educated, that they don't have a tax base, and continue to use a study from 12 years ago and deny the residents of East Los Angeles an opportunity to have a voice in local government.\n\nWendy Carrillo\n\nLegislator\n\nIt is the opposite of empowerment of community and I am asking you today to stand and deliver for the residents of East Los Angeles to ensure that they have a voice in local government, that they have a voice in what happens in their quality of life, and help move this policy forward to continue the conversation in the Senate and ensure that the voices of the 120,000 residents of East Los Angeles don't have to come to Sacramento to be heard, that they could be heard locally, that have a voice in local government, and have representation that is by them and for them.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Assemblymember Carrillo.

Survivors of trafficking frequently first engage with government through interactions with law enforcement. In fact, the first time that survivors come into contact with law enforcement is often as an offender becomes because of sex trafficking, victims are commonly arrested for prostitution or other crimes.\n\nMia Bonta\n\nLegislator\n\nAccording to a 2023 national survivor study, 62% of survivors reported being cited, detained or arrested by law enforcement. Most of these survivors arrested were arrested, detained or sighted during their trafficking situation. These facts underscore that survivors encounter with law enforcement and their treatment in the overall justice system can can have big impacts on their lives.\n\nMia Bonta\n\nLegislator\n\nI look forward to improving these interactions with AB 2020 so we can connect survivors to the resources they need when they need it and continue to lower the prevalence of human trafficking in our state. This Bill has no opposition and has received no no voice. Thank you and I respectfully request your I vote.\n\nFreddie Rodriguez\n\nLegislator\n\nLemsas coordinate emergency response throughout California and is imperative that the public and lawmakers see how local agencies are planning to care and what is preventing providers from arriving in a timely manner so we can fix the system. I respect the ask for your aye vote. Thank you.\n\nJacqui Irwin\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you. AB 2352 seeks to create a legal framework for psychiatric advance directives. In simple terms, pads are documents completed by individuals who have behavioral health challenges that allow them to communicate preferences to first responders and healthcare providers about interacting with them during a future behavioral health crisis. We are still working with all the stakeholders on language and have since the beginning and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nJim Wood\n\nLegislator\n\nSeeing and hearing none the Clerk will read the second day consent calendar.
