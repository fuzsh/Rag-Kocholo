        "text": "Once Vinnie Moore picked up his first guitar (a Kay) at the age of 12, he became, as he describes it, a “guitar freak.” His earliest influences included - among others - Jeff Beck, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Queen.\n\nVinnie took lessons with a private instructor and at 14, he joined his first band, jamming on cover tunes with drums, bass, 2 guitars and vocals. After a few years of playing with different bands, Vinnie decided it was time to make the jump from covering songs to creating his own music. He quit the band, got a 4-track tape recorder, and began experimenting by recording his ideas and building them into songs. It was evident that he had found his calling; this was the start of his journey as a songwriter.\n\nAfter many hours of creating tunes with his 4 track, Vinnie sent a demo to Guitar Player magazine, and came to national attention via its \"Spotlight\" column, written by Shrapnel Records exec Mike Varney. This led to Vinnie’s first professional work in the music business which was writing and playing the music for a national Pepsi TV commercial. In 1987, Shrapnel released Vinnie's breakout album, Mind's Eye. Vinnie was quickly heralded \"best new talent\" in Guitar Player, Guitar, and Guitar World magazines, and Mind's Eye sold more than 100,000 copies.\n\nIn 1988, Squawk/Polygram released Vinnie’s second effort (and major label debut) Time Odyssey, which solidified his reputation as a musical innovator. His third release was Meltdown, in 1991 (on Relativity/Epic Records); the song Meltdown received national radio airplay on both album-oriented rock (AOR) and hard rock formats. In 1996, Mayhem Records released Out of Nowhere, with Brian Tichy (Billy Idol) on drums and Dorian Heartsong (Powerman 5000) on bass.\n\nOn The Maze (in 1999), Vinnie was joined by former MSG drummer Shane Gaalaas, bassist Dave LaRue (The Dregs and The Steve Morse Band) and renowned master musician Tony MacAlpine on keyboards. The Maze was stunning, rooted in the progressive neo-classical style that had already generated legions of loyal fans. Vinnie also displayed a new-found maturity in his songwriting; now, many of his diverse and exotic musical influences, including Latin, Jazz, and the Blues, began finding their way into his signature sound.\n\nOther albums followed: Live (in 2000), with Shane Gaalaas (drums), Barry Sparks on bass, and Wayne Findlay on keyboards, and Defying Gravity in 2001 with Dave LaRue (bass), Steve Smithon drums, and David Rosenthal on Keyboards.\n\nAs a performer, Vinnie Moore's resume is impressive. A member of Alice Cooper's band, he toured the U.S. on the Operation Rock'N'Roll tour, and also performed on Alice’s album Hey Stoopid. Vinnie’s own band has toured extensively as a headliner and also was chosen as opening act for legendary rockers Rush on the Northeast leg of their Roll The Bones Tour. Vinnie also toured Japan as a member of the T.M. Stevens’ band, which included Bernie Worrell (Parliament Funkadelic) on keyboards, Wil Calhoun (Living Color) on drums, and Al Pitrelli (Megadeth) on guitar.\n\nVinnie has done hundreds of guitar clinics all over the world including such places as, Japan, Scandanavia, Italy, Poland, Mexico, Canada, New Zealand, England, Germany and Australia.\n\nIn 2003, Vinnie joined the legendary group UFO (Phil Mogg, vocals; Pete Way, bass; Jason Bonham, drums; Paul Raymond, keyboards). Their first effort together as a band was the SPV Records release You Are Here (in 2004); Vinnie was a major songwriting contributor on this record. The band followed You Are Here with a worldwide tour which spanned from March 2004 to August 2005. A LIVE DVD from this tour was released in Nov 2005. Titled UFO Showtime, this two-DVD set also includes bonus footage of the band. The band's second studio effort called The Monkey Puzzle came out in 2006 and marked the return of original UFO drummer Andy Parker. The boys toured Europe and Russia and the USA in April and May 2008. The third UFO studio record with Vinnie in the band is called The Visitor and was released in June 2009 on SPV Records. The band has toured the UK, Europe, and USA, and will continue in Europe in the spring of 2010!\n\nVinnie's latest CD To The Core (2009 Mascot Records) was released in May 2009 and has received critical acclaim worldwide.\n\nOver many years, Vinnie's 4-track recorder has grown into a home studio, where he's recorded his last two solo CDs, and parts of the UFO CD. Vinnie's home studio is the place where he writes new music.\n\nAs well as songwriting and playing, Vinnie is dedicated to teaching. He's conducted guitar clinics around the world, and has released two instructional videos on the HotLicks® label (see the Music page for more information). Vinnie joins his fans at clinics worldwide for, Engl Amplification, and Dean Guitars.\n\nOn doing clinics: “I like talking to the fans firsthand and learning from them. It’s insightful to hear what they like about what I’m doing, and what they think about the guitar genre…and the whole music scene in general. I definitely feed off of their energy. It’s cool to be part of a global guitar community, and it’s an honor to know that I can sometimes inspire others to get excited by music and guitar. It always amazes me to me to hear that I have touched someone else by doing something that I love doing so much. I consider it a gift to be playing guitar and writing songs, and feel like one of the luckiest cats in the world to have fans.”\n\nOn songwriting and musical influences: “I hope to keep growing and learning as a songwriter and as a player, and to explore different musical directions, kind of following the inspiration wherever it leads. I don’t plan ahead musically, which keeps things interesting for me. I want to continue following my muse into areas that inspire and excite me. I am basically a rock guy…but love many different styles of music, and am often inspired by - and learn from - all of them. Music is so vast, and there are so many things to pick up from all the different styles. I’ve kind of always been like this, drawing on different musical influences, partly because I like lots of different things and partly… because I get bored easily! Exploring different directions is fun, and it keeps me excited as both a writer and a player.”\n\nOn having his own studio: “I love having a studio environment in the house so I can turn my ideas into songs. It’s really like my own little space in the universe and I love being there and being creative.”\n\nOn songwriting: “In other parts of the house, I mostly sit around and play, and I always keep a Walkman cassette player close by, because you never know when an idea for a song is going to pop out. Musical ideas usually happen when you least expect them. I don’t consciously try to write; my ideas just come from playing. I record stuff; I never write it down.\"\n\nOn playing: \"I have pretty much always considered myself a melody and feel guy. Regardless of which style of music I am playing, the essence of what it is all about for me is definitely the melody and expressing myself emotionally. I love creating melodies that are memorable and can be sung, and if I can make a listener feel emotion when they hear my stuff, it is the highest reward I could ever get.\"\n\nFourteen years into his two-decade tenure with acclaimed Greenville, South Carolina technical death metal band Nile, guitarist and vocalist Dallas Toler-Wade was itching to explore new musical and lyrical frontiers. So he hooked up with some old buddies from his hometown Fayetteville, North Carolina and started writing old-school death metal inspired by some of their favorite bands, including Gorguts, Immolation, Incantation and Suffocation.\n\n“There was something really powerful about those bands, especially Gorguts,” Toler-Wade says. “They had these twin guitar compositions that felt different than the kind of death metal other bands were doing. So, Narcotic Wasteland is partially my way of rediscovering what I first loved about death metal.”\n\nNarcotic Wasteland self-released their self-titled debut in 2014. Then in October 2016, Toler-Wade left Nile and Narcotic Wasteland became his main priority. “It was just time for me to do something different,” he says.\n\nAfter talking to several companies, Narcotic Wasteland signed with Megaforce, which historically has launched the careers of Metallica, Anthrax, Testament, Overkill and others. Narcotic Wasteland’s second album, Delirium Tremens is a dramatic musical evolution from the band’s first release. Not only is the production better, the chemistry between Rhone and Toler-Wade is impeccable, each feeling out and feeding off of the other’s playing. And bassist Chris Dupre and drummer Phil Cancilla form a whirlwind rhythm section that’s tighter than a locked door. Coupled with trenchant grooves and impacting vocals, Delirium Tremens is more than an homage to the band’s favorite musicians, it’s a new style wrought from some of the best pages of the past.\n\n“Maybe knowing that this was going to be my main band made me think about it a little more carefully about the songs,” Toler-Wade says. “I had a bit more direction and the stuff I was writing seemed more focused. The first record established a sound and this one definitely took it to the next level.”\n\nOn Delirium Tremens, Narcotic Wasteland exit the starting gate with guns blazing on “Introspective Nightmares,” a brutal feast of angular riffs, enticing licks, blast beats and scathing vocals. “Life Revolted” is slower, but impacts just as hard, juxtaposing staccato riffs and melodic guitar lines with double-bass drumming. Then there’s “Self Immolation,” one of two atmospheric instrumentals on the album; it consists of haunting organ, synth, piano and strings and would perfectly compliment the next Evil Dead sequel. Bassist LutaChrist Dupre wrote “Husk,” a death metal stormer that features acrobatic guitar lines and contrasts infectious chugging riffs with amphetamine-fueled blast beats; Dupre also collaborated with Toler-Wade on the lyrics to “Pharma Culture.”\n\nNarcotic Wasteland named their new album after the title track, which is about delirium tremens, the medical term for symptoms an alcoholic suffers after about three days without a drink. These include uncontrollable shaking, shivering, sweating, heart palpitations, confusion and hallucinations.\n\n“All these things are going through your brain and there are voices in your head,” says Toler-Wade, who admits having had problems with alcohol in the past. “It feels like you’re going crazy. It can happen with opioids, too, but most of the time it’s from severe alcoholism.”\n\nOver the years, many of Toler-Wade’s friends and family have fallen into the abyss of addiction. And some never returned. It’s a tragic byproduct of growing up in Fayetteville, North Carolina, a military town where male residents have a PTSD rate as high as 75% and there are the most reported incidents of shaken baby syndrome in the country. Lots of Fayetteville’s disenchanted population chooses to escape misery through street drugs, prescription medication and alcohol. Instead of remaining silent about the scourge that has surrounded him, Toler-Wade addresses it throughout Delirium Tremens.\n\n“You waste your life trying to forget reality with booze, pills and cocaine/ I will not remain silent while you piss your life away,” he screams in the meaty, riff-saturated “Bleed and Swell.” And in the torrential, hyper-speed guitar-fest “Faces of Meth,” he growls about amphetamines “slowly killing you while robbing your youth and beauty” and laments those who “never had a chance at a normal life” and are “raised from generations of total ignorance.”\n\n“I’m addressing all the bad stuff that goes on with addiction and making statements about what I see,” he says. “There have been a couple of people that have said we're an anti-party band, but that’s not true at all. I don't give a shit what people do with themselves. And, you know, if they can handle it, that’s fine. I’m really just interested in talking about addiction and some of the toxic human behavior that comes along with it.”\n\nUnlike Nile, which wrote album after album about Egyptian history, theology and the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Narcotic Wasteland isn’t purely a concept band. The unrelenting, blast-beat powered and rhythmically eclectic “We Agnostics” questions the existence of a higher power, the triumphant “Return to the Underground” is a statement of dedication to the pure strength of metal and “In Memoriam” is an acoustic instrumental that serves as a touching dedication to anyone who has passed away.\n\n“I couldn’t write every song about the same thing,” Toler-Wade says. “But I didn’t want to have a bunch of vague stories and songs that don’t mean anything as a whole, even if they might sound good together. I prefer to be very straightforward and blunt, almost in a punk rock fashion. And I've had people actually message me saying, ‘Man, this song you wrote really hits home with me. I've had similar issues myself or with a friend of mine.’ Having someone connect with what we’re doing like that is a really powerful thing.”\n\nThe most political song on Delirium Tremens is the closing cut “Pharma Culture” a slower thrash/death metal number that blends lethal chugs with sharp, melodic guitar lines and addresses how the medical industry is more intent on producing pills to ease symptoms than it is in curing diseases. “It’s talking about how we’re being enslaved because there’s such a high addiction rate,” he says. “Everyone’s hooked on their pharmaceutical drugs, and it would cut into their money if there weren’t so many people that were dependent on their product.”\n\nToler-Wade wrote four songs for Delirium Tremens before he left Nile, then, with new motivation and more time to work, he powered through the rest of the tracks in early 2017, finishing all 12 songs by March. Joining him in the writing process was lead guitarist Edwin Rhone, who engaged in a friendly competition with Toler-Wade to see who could come up with the coolest parts. Then the two had a blast creating the best songs out of what they had. The main reason for the strong chemistry between Toler-Wade and Rhone is they’ve known each other since 1991.\n\n“I was playing in another band at the time called Dukallian and some of my friends were like, ‘You gotta check this guy out,’” Toler-Wade says. “He was one of a group of guitarists I knew of. So we started jamming and trading licks. We became good friends and then our bands started playing shows together. When my band fizzled, I joined him in Teratosis. We did a couple of demos, but couldn’t really get anything going. I realized it was going to be really hard to have a career in North Carolina, so I moved to Greenville, South Carolina to join Nile. But at the end of the day, the chemistry I have with Ed is really special. It’s not something you can just have with any musician. We really connect on the same level.”\n\nIn 2011, Rhone introduced Toler-Wade to bassist Chris “LutaChrist” Dupre, who played on the band’s 2014 self-titled debut. The only lineup shift to take place between the two Narcotic Wasteland’s albums is drummer Erik Schultek, who quit in 2014 to focus on a studio career. The split with Schultek was amicable and the drum stool didn’t stay vacant for long. A Facebook friend of his, Phil Cancilla, earned an audition after Toler-Wade, a gaming junky, saw a clip of him frantically playing along to the music in the final stage of the video game Contra. Toler-Wade could immediately tell their personalities were compatible and Cancilla’s speed, skill and style fit perfectly with Narcotic Wasteland’s passion and energy. “He just nailed it, man,” Toler-Wade says. “He played his heart out and really got the vibe of what we were doing right away.”\n\nNarcotic Wasteland self-produced and mixed Delirium Tremens at Vegas View Recording and at Dallas’ home studio. Grammy award winning producer Neil Kernon mixed the album at Auslander and Alan Douches mastered at West Side Music.\n\nWith two albums of material to draw from, Narcotic Wasteland are looking forward to playing shows to support Delirium Tremens. The band will launch a 20-plus city North American tour, beginning October 21 in Greenville, South Carolina. The last show is December 9 in Orlando, Florida. While Toler-Wade accepts that in some ways he’s starting again from scratch -- since Narcotic Wasteland never toured before -- he’s excited about exposing audiences, no matter how large or small, to his new music and message.\n\n“We’ll play anywhere,” he says. “We don’t mind doing shows at small bars. We just want to get as many shows as we can and to take this around the world if we can. I’m just excited to get out there and see what happens.”\n\nFor more information about Narcotic Wasteland.\n\nContact Andrea Roberts at ati.andrear@gmail.com\n\nIMMORTAL SUFFERING formed in 1992 by Joe Provvisiero (Guitars/Vocals) & Woodstock R.R. (RIP) (Drums) with only one goal: To create brutal death metal! In 1993 Ray Lebron (Bass/Vocals) joined the band, and began working closely with Joe to create some of the earlier songs released on the first demo. In 1994 Dave Zatuchney (Guitar) joined and the four piece emerged from the depths of the studio to pummel the scene with their horrid visions. Shortly afterwards, they released their first self-titled demo.\n\nAfter a series of brutal shows, IMMORTAL SUFFERING hit hard luck when Woodstock R.R. was let go due to his addiction to the darker sides of life; but the band was able to find Rudy Lopez. Rudy had been searching for the right band for some time and was close to calling it quits when he heard the demo; ​he instantly knew this was the band he wanted to be in. With the band back in action they worked hard to tighten the music while preparing for the new demo. The demo released in 1995 was entitled Eternal Damnation.\n\nIn 1996 came the unexpected when Dave mutually decided to split with the band because IMMORTAL SUFFERING wanted to go in a different direction. Soon after, Ralph Spadafora, longtime friend and EX front man from God For Bid decided to join. With some intriguing changes to follow, Joe would no longer do vocals and Ray would move from bass to share the Front man duties with Ralph. The band soon realized that Ray’s brutal lows mixed with Ralph's array of gruesome pitches would be the perfect compliment to Joe’s new riffs and Rudy’s beats. The new IMMORTAL SUFFERING evolved to become the brutally insane opus fans have grown to love.\n\nAfter a short time in the studio the music was ready but IMMORTAL SUFFERING still lacked a Bass player and Guitarist to complete the band. So IMMORTAL SUFFERING started playing the scene. To no surprise, they started ripping through the scene looking for the missing pieces, and in late '96 after some abysmal try outs, Sasha Abayev happened to see the band play and was taken aback by how brutal and heavy the sound was with just one Guitarist. So without haste, Sasha joined the band. In search of the final piece, Leo Bakman was discovered and from then on the band was completed, with only one intention: To rip up the scene! And that they did quickly signing with Mortal Coil Records and releasing Images of Horror in 1997.\n\nWith some extremely brutal shows and crazy stage props headed by Ralph, IMMORTAL SUFFERING'S popularity began to grow. Being known as the band with crushing, brutal riffs and macabre vocals, their presence was large with fans, never knowing what the band would do next. From the baby on the stick, to goat heads, to flying chop meat, baby brains and a six foot dummy impaled on an inverted cross, the shows were an interactive experience.\n\nSadly, in Jan of 1998 Joe decided he wanted to leave the band and everyone agreed without Joe the band would not continue. Everyone parted ways and started to do their own thing.\n\nAfter 15 years of slumber, the sleeping giant has finally awoke, and the mighty IMMORTAL SUFFERING resurrected! In Feb 2013 Joe, Ray, Rudy, Ralph, Sasha and Leo headed back to the studio to begin a new chapter. In 2015 Immortal Suffering released a full length called Asylum (Ossuary Records) and in 2019 they put out another full length called Preyed Upon (Pathologically Explicit Records) and everything was going good, Playing shows and festivals…. Than covid hit... The band hard to make some really tough decisions. Due to members it has effected. Ralph was going through some personal difficult times with his family. Dotz had some of his own issues that he couldn't contribute to that band. So we replaced Ralph with Jordon (vocals). So covid was coming to an end. We played our first show with Jordon and Ray on vocals .Unfortunately that was Ray's last show. It was getting to much to travel and playing shows living in Milwaukee, so he decided to step down (not officially out) Than we found a bass player Taylor to fill the bass job. In 2022 we recorded a single Conceived In A Crackhouse. Was recorded in a couple of locations due to some Studios were closed to covid. So just when everything was going back on track, Leo had to step down do to money issues. So that brings up to the current lineup. Joe decided to keep it just one guitarist to write new music. A new release will be out in 2023.\n\nProfessional history:\n\n•WRITING, SCREENWRITING, EDITING, STORY-EDITING, LINE-EDITING,\n\nCOMMUNICATION: Both fiction and non-fiction, stage and screen\n\nNew York Times Bestselling novelist, author of 53 published books, including multiple\n\nNew York Times Bestsellers, and bestsellers on the Waldenbooks, BDalton and USAToday lists.
