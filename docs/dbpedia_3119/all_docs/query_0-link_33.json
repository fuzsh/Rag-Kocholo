        "text": "A record label headquartered on Northeast Portland’s Alberta Street has been declared a racist organization by the nation’s leading watchdog of white-supremacist and hate groups.\n\nOn Feb. 15, the Southern Poverty Law Center listed Soleilmoon Recordings among 25 new hate groups across the United States.\n\nOwned and operated by Charles Powne, Soleilmoon is a nearly 30-year-old “boutique” label that sells what Powne calls “dark industrial ambient” music, mostly via mail order. Its mailing address is a post-office box located between brunch spot Helser’s and Alberta Co-op Grocery.\n\nAnd its top-selling product is the music of an alleged neo-Nazi band from England.\n\nPowne says he’s “mystified” by the hate-group listing. “The solution to bad speech is not to shut it down, but to overcome it with more speech,” he says.\n\nThe designation revives concerns about the white-power movement in Oregon, which constitutes seven of state’s 11 hate groups, according to the SPLC.\n\nIt also raises questions about creative freedom, free speech and guilt by association.\n\nThe election of President Donald Trump has emboldened white-nationalist groups across the U.S., and sharpened their opposition. The SPLC, based in Montgomery, Ala., tracks racist groups and hate attacks. It recorded 42 hate incidents in Oregon in the month following the Nov. 8 election.\n\nBut conservative critics have accused the SPLC of political overreach, and of demonizing unpopular speech. The group’s release of new hate-group listings comes as college campuses and conservative organizations argue over how large a platform to afford racist provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nSoleilmoon Recordings sells MP3s, CDs, vinyl records and T-shirts of 123 artists, including Throbbing Gristle, the Legendary Pink Dots and Merzbow.\n\nBut it’s music that critics have identified for years as neo-Nazi that pays the bills. Powne says Soleilmoon brings in more than $100,000 a year, and Death in June — the controversial, far-right project of British neo-fascist Douglas Pearce — is its top-selling artist.\n\nDeath in June refers to the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, when Adolf Hitler ordered the murder of his political rivals within the Nazi Party. The band employs a wide range of fascist and Nazi imagery, such as wearing Waffen-SS uniforms onstage.\n\nOn Death in June’s official website, Soleilmoon is listed as the band’s official distributor. Death in June accounted for more than half the label’s digital sales, and moved “a couple thousand” units last year.\n\nThe SPLC says Death in June is the main reason for Soleilmoon’s hate-group listing.\n\n“The label’s owner makes such a concerted effort to promote and cast [Death in June] as, basically, the centerpiece of the label’s project that we couldn’t ignore it any longer,” SPLC spokeswoman Rebecca Sturtevant wrote via email. “The label also sells acts like NON, which is Boyd Rice’s experimental noise project.”\n\nPowne denies that Soleilmoon is racist, and says Pearce and Rice — whose icon is a half-swastika — are not racist either.\n\nPowne adds that he “endorses” the SPLC, and says if he’s guilty of anything, it’s capitalism.\n\n“I feel fortunate to be able to [run a music label], but I could be accused of compromising before the almighty dollar,” he says. “It’s just music and it’s just money. I just go where the customers need me.”"
