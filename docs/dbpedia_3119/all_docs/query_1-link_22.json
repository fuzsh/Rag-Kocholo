While the featured choices are of a high quality - Fleshcrawl, Hate Eternal, Immolation, etc. - not all is top notch within. Firstly, the white type on black background becomes quickly tiring. Secondly, the reviews should be a little more articulate and feature addresses. It's silly to have to refer to the last page to match the review and country of origin with an index. While at it, the 'zine should include its own address! Having said that, Amputation is actually worth your time and money, with its hefty content, and gives you a clear snapshot of the death metal year. I am looking forward to a shorter lead time for issue #7...The long delay is over and Sang Frais # 7 ( $1 to CP Saint-Andre, BP 32111, Montreal H2L 4Y5) has hitchhiked down the 401 to finally get here. Sang Frais is written in French to serve French Canada, and I suppose it remains within mandate. The layout is clear and the information plentiful, so Francophone metal fans shouldn't hesitate in ordering this nicely-priced 'zine for interviews with Satyricon, Impaled Nazarene, Malevolence and more. Cool cover by the way...The monthly Rock'n'Metal newsletter Beyond #19 ($1 to 22 rue Reniers, 1090 Jette Belgium) covers a wide range of music from electronic to progressive to metal. Within its clear pages features bands like Silent Exile; concise reviews of signed and unsigned bands as well as written material!.\n\nSelect Top 5 Releases\n\nAli \"The Metallian\" - Editor\n\n1- Centinex - Hellbrigade - Repulse\n\n2- Solar Dawn - Frost-Work - Mighty\n\n3- Beheaded - Resurgence of Oblivion - Mighty\n\n4- Onward - Evermoving - Century Media\n\n5- The Forsaken - Manifest of Hate - Century Media\n\nMicke Skala - Editor for Amputation fanzine\n\n1- Vomitory - Revelation Nausea - Metal Blade\n\n2- Immolation - Close To A World Below - Metal Blade\n\n3- Hypnosia - Extreme Hatred - Hammerheart\n\n4- Nile - Black Seeds Of Vengeance - Relapse\n\n5- Scurvy - Demo 2000 - Independent\n\nMetallian Demos\n\nBOILING REMAINS - Rehearsal Tape\n\nWhoa, a rehearsal tape served up straight from the underground. Nice photos of the members (front and back) aside, this is pure sludgy, grinding garage metal. Does anyone recall the Autopsy demos? What about early Cianide and The Dead Youth? Never mind, there are no two ways to imagine what a song like Splattering Trapezist sounds like. It's a rehearsal tape, buy throw them a couple of bucks and dance yourself silly. Thomas Verhelle, Moervijverweg 39, 8680 Koekelare Belgium.\n\nCARESS - PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL\n\nThere are so many bands in the Czech Republic and Slovakia that one begins to wonder how this has all come about. Here is a different take on tape. Caress are clearly into complex arrangements, 25 rhythm changes a run and jazz! While the growls of the singer might take one back to Obituary, albeit not as deep, the music is a mix between death metal, Coroner and progressive jazz. It's hard to imagine a metallers taking to this; it's simply too off beat for heavy metal, but i do remember the efforts of Canada's Elements a few years back and wonder. Whatever the comparisons here's the address. Personally I wish I knew whether track two's title, Last Pillgrimage, is a typo or not. Kosc Jan, Sputnikova 8, 040 12 kosice, Slovakia\n\nMASTECTOMIA/FUCK THE FACTS - Split Tape\n\nPolish newcomer band (at least to Metallian Towers) Mastectomia and Canada's premiere preachers of noisecore have banded together for this all out grindcore attack that clearly harbours a lot that death metallers can rejoice in as well. Not pulling any punches, the two bands go for the jugular with grinding guitars, looooow vocals and a couple of Suffocation riffs to boot. Very cool stuff that might not be the tightest, but is still guaranteed to kick the tail of your average Pantera/Emperor fan for years to come. The choice is yours. You can either discover the stars of tomorrow by sending $5 to 50 Rene Levesque St., Gatineau J8P 6Z5 in good old Canada or stay a poser forever.\n\nSERBERUS - IN ETERNITY\n\nRising from the depths of the metal underground, USA's Serberus' CD is a 4/5 track release mixing some HM with thrash and death with the vocals coming across as particularly snarly and menacing. The band do incorporate the rare moment of trendy spoken vocal interlude, but quickly go back to metal. On the musical front, apart from the suspect drumming on the live bonus track, the band plays with both heaviness and variety to an above average effect. The sound is not completely full, but this quartet clearly has understood the advantage of using two rhythms simultaneously. There are relatively few mundane riffs, and even a few above average demonstrations here signaling a hopeful future for this act. Pretty cool even if one has to wonder how a band comes across words like Serberus, besiege or affliction when a quick look at the liner notes reveals a lack of simple grammar abilities ' for there musical support', etc. Never mind the music is worth your attention. 3550 Everett Dr. Boulder Co. 80303 USA.\n\nFURY - STIGMATISED\n\nThe moniker and title might leave a little to be desired in the originality departments, but the MCD is chock full of anger and hate. Thrashing metal out of Australia, Fury is the type of band that fans of everything from Meshuggah to Propain might enjoy. Front man O' Neil certainly pours out his gut with fury, and the rest of the band aims to crush; it is only the weak drumming that is obviously a problem. The drums simply follow the rest of the band, keeping up and never quite doing anything independently interesting. Songs like Fallen Ones and the title track are certainly well done though, and listeners of the style can send $8 (US) to 749 Lower North East Road, Paradise SA 5075 Australia to obtain this demo."
