        "text": "All dates subject to change.\n\nSeptember\n\nJOHN ZORN -- As he did 10 years ago at the old Knitting Factory for his 40th birthday, the saxophonist and composer Mr. Zorn will celebrate himself with a month of continuous performances, amounting to an exhaustive, if not quite complete, retrospective. Tonight he plays his string quartets; tomorrow he duets with the drummer Milford Graves; Tuesday he plays his scores to films by Kenneth Anger, Maya Deren and Harry Smith; and so on through September. Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, (212) 358-7503. www.tonicnyc.com\n\nNICHOLAS PAYTON -- Well, now it's official: every major young trumpeter in jazz keeps a funk band on the side. Mr. Payton's Sonic Trance has come up with a first, self-titled album, and it alters the cluttered landscape of these backbeat side-projects. It is, in places, legitimately weird and thoughtful; its post-electric-Miles scuffs and skids transcend the jazz musician's common desire to make a soign√© mood album or a blunt attempt at hip-hop. Tuesday. Warner Brothers.\n\nANDREW W. K. -- This tall, bearded commando-nerd of partydom wants your business: if his first album never stopped hectoring you to exult with him, his second, ''The Wolf,'' suggests ways to counterbalance the exultation with some feeling, some sharing, some growing. Tuesday. Island.\n\nJUNE CARTER CASH -- Now that she's gone, having died in May at 73, June Carter Cash really seems pretty far ahead of her time in white, mainstream American show business: a God-fearing but entirely tolerant matriarch. On ''Wildwood Flower,'' her final effort, full of the contributions of other Cashes and streaked with snippets of early-career radio performances, she sounds like the least pretentious person ever, rattling off old and new songs in her shaky voice. And unlike her husband, Johnny, she didn't use her frailty to enhance her personal mythos. Tuesday. Dualtone.\n\nMICHAEL BRECKER -- This influential jazz saxophonist is also a veteran record maker, having worked in all kinds of straight-ahead and pop contexts. He returns with ''Wide Angles,'' an ambitious record credited to his Quindectet. That means a 15-piece group; it includes French horn, oboe, a string quartet and the standard jazz brass and rhythm-section set-up. Tuesday. Verve.\n\nBRANFORD MARSALIS -- The saxophonist's second quartet album on his own label draws inspiration from ''The Art of Romare Bearden,'' a major posthumous retrospective of the painter's work at the National Gallery of Art in Washington that opens next Sunday. Bearden let the sound and shape of jazz suggest his paintings; Mr. Marsalis does the reverse in return. Tuesday. Marsalis Music.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
