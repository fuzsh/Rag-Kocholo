        "text": "There are 31,354 Clergy in the Church of the Nazarene, Here’s What you Need to Know\n\nThere are 31,354 clergy in the Church of the Nazarene. 19,321 elders. 893 deacons. 11,140 district licensed ministers. Of the 19,321 elders, exactly 11,003 are from USA/Canada.\n\nAs one of the 31,354, I am proud of my co-laborers across the globe. Obviously I don’t know all 11,002 of my fellow elders in USA/Canada. I am sure there are a few stinkers in the bunch, but just a few.\n\nHere’s what I know about Nazarene clergy: they work hard. They don’t often get paid well. Until this year, their retirement stink, stank, stunk (thank you P&B for greatly improving the denominational investment in the retirement plan). Pastors are loving, kind, and generous. There’s not a lot of complaining from them, just a lot of praying and preaching and visiting the sick and the million other jobs of a pastor. Social media has made their job infinitely harder; the cultural circling of the drain has made it harder still; and pastoring in an election year makes it even harder than that. Still they faithfully serve.\n\nPastors aren’t perfect (neither are you, non-pastors, who might be reading). Pastors are usually strong, but sometimes are weak. Usually right, but sometimes are wrong. Usually preach good sermons, but sometimes preach a bad one. Usually use good discernment, but sometime mess up. Usually are thrilled to be serving in their location, but sometimes want out. Usually lead well, but sometimes get off track. Pastors are humans, in other words (again so are you).\n\nMost folks in the congregation would say they love their pastor and they know she/he loves them. You probably feel this way, so why tell you what you already know? Simple, don’t let the social media naysayers allow you to think that (your pastor excluded) the other 11,002 USA/Canada Nazarene pastors are goobers or worse. If you watch the internet too much, you’ll hear of moral failures and a bugaboo elder or two, but that’s the minority. The extreme minority. Again, most Nazarene pastors love Jesus, the Church of the Nazarene and their flock (well, most of the flock. There are a few goober laymen too… but not many). The vast majority of Nazarenes pastors and people (my antidotal guess is 99.8%) are trying hard to serve Jesus.\n\nWe’ve all heard the saying, “the squeaky wheel gets the grease.” In our social-media-gone-mad world, maybe the statement if relating to the clergy in the Church of the Nazarene should read “the squeaky two hundredths of one per percent of 11,003 get the notoriety.” Pay little attention to the hullabaloo. Social media stalking of the sinful or heretical borders on mindless chatter at best and gossip at worst. You’ve got better things to do—like telling your own pastor that you support her/him; praying for him/her; and appreciate his/her efforts to lead the charge against the Enemy in your hometown.\n\nLaypeople reading this might not be able to encourage all 31,354 Nazarene pastors, but I bet you could cheer on one or two! Pastors reading this know you have 31,353 other pastors in the Church of the Nazarene who just like you are doing their best to represent Jesus! Be encouraged. The overwhelming majority are faithfully serving (just like you). And to the teeny tiny minority of pastors who’ve had their struggles, sins, trips and falls, please remember the One who called you is still faithful, even if you haven’t been. Ministry might be out of the question, but you’re not too far gone, no matter what you or others might think. Confess. Move forward (in ministry or not). Finish the race.\n\nAll this to say, most (not all, but most by far) of 31,354 ministers in the Church of the Nazarene love Jesus and want to see His Kingdom built wherever they are serving.\n\nWant to change the Church of the Nazarene? Start in your own backyard\n\nAs far as I remember the General Church of the Nazarene baptizes no one. Maybe there has been a baptism at a General Assembly, but I’ve never seen it. No infant baptisms either. Or baby dedications. Nothing like that. Those are local church happenings.\n\nThere’s been a few baptisms on our district campgrounds, but it’s still a local church thing. The district didn’t do much in their discipleship. Yes, there are camps but the day to day discipleship happens in the local church. Again, no infant baptisms or baby dedications happen on the district level. There is no marriage counselling. No food programs. No ongoing mission efforts. That is all a local church thing too.\n\nMinistry happens at the local church. We all know this to be true. So if one is starting to get bent out of shape or ruffled feathers because of decisions made on the general (global) or district level take a breath, calm down, practice self-control (a fruit of the spirit, remember) look around and see all the good things (God things) that are happening at your local church.\n\nThere are a lot of good proceedings.\n\nAt my local church just in the next week or two these things are happening: a mission team of 35 people (mostly teens, but our District Superintendent too) was supposed to be in Panama this week (unfortunately, weekend storms and a day in the Buffalo airport ruined that and sent the team back to Michigan). Another team is going in September (no storms please). We partner with the closest elementary school to the church. Partnering means providing all the school supplies; sponsoring extracurricular activities and field trips; buying the entire school matching T-Shirts to inspire school spirit and unity; providing mentors and aids; and delivering bags of weekend groceries so the 60+ children identified as at risk kids won’t go hungry without the free school breakfast and lunch. Our Vacation Bible Camp children raised money to buy 65 backpacks for the kids around the Flint Eastside mission. The Boys and Girls Club of Flint that meets in our building is supplying a free lunch to anybody and everybody this summer. Folks from the community are playing pickleball (free of charge) two nights a week in the Community Center. Central Park, the play area we built for our neighbors, is constantly in use. Our neighborhood block party, Summerfest, happens in a couple of weeks. Besides trying to be the best neighbor, baptisms are happening this Sunday– infants in the morning service and new believers at night at a public beach area (I love public baptisms); and our worship services have been Spirit filled and God led!\n\nWhen I get worried about doctrinal brouhahas in the general church or bug-a-booed about thing-a-ma-bob at another Nazarene church or pastor 30 miles away, I start to lose my focus. God has called us to bloom where we are planted. So let’s bloom. Don’t get so (in our Nazarene world) “Lenexa focused” that we miss what’s happening under our noses.\n\nWould I change a few things if I were the Super Czar of the Nazarene-dom… probably, but no one voted me into that role (there isn’t a Super Czar of Nazarene-dom). Instead of filling the complaint box in Lenexa with wonderful ideas about how the GSs should do their jobs (I don’t think there is a complain box), why not take a neighbor a plate of cookies or babysit a single mom’s kids, mentor a child at your elementary school or visit a widow. Do something that truly matters.\n\nJesus calls us to love our neighbor. That’s a local thing. James says the religion that matters is that which takes care of widows and orphans. That’s a local thing too. When Jesus told the parable of the King separating folks at Judgement Day like a shepherd separates sheep and goats, the difference was in how people cared for the sick and needy. In each incidence, it’s a local matter. Not once does Jesus tell us to worry about what others are doing. In fact, he says let the sin-free folks have the first stone toss at the sinner. Nobody chucked a rock. Maybe we shouldn’t either.\n\nDon’t like what’s happening in Lenexa? Instead of spinning your wheels (or banging your fingers on a keyboard) trying to clean up the world around you. The ministry that matters is local ministry. Start tossing rocks at others once your own glass house is perfect. Want to change the Church of the Nazarene? Start in your own backyard!\n\nWhy Have a Manual in the Church of the Nazarene If No One Follows It?\n\nWhat is the purpose of the Manual? Here’s my succinct, oversimplified definition on the purpose of the Church of the Nazarene’s Manual: “The Manual is how Nazarene’s interpret the Bible theologically and socially. Additionally, it is how the Church of the Nazarene tries to best organized itself to make Christ-like disciples in the nations.” That’s pretty much it. The Manual is not the Bible. It’s changed every four years. It’s our attempt to interpret the Bible in theology and life for our particular ecclesiastical organization for such a time as this.\n\nFrom my vantage point, as the social media posters volleyed back and forth last week, it once again exposed the great divide within the Church of the Nazarene. There are some in our tribe that want a strict adherence to the Manual which (along with Jesus) is the same yesterday, today and forever. Others seemingly are of the opinion that a minister is free to think and act however one pleases regardless of the Manual’s directives.\n\nIf the latter have their way, why have a Manual? If its words mean nothing and the clergy can disregard whatever section he/she pleases, whenever they please, why have the Manual? Are the Manual’s directives simply suggestions? If so, who picks and who chooses what we believe or don’t believe? Don’t call it a “manual” if that is the case. Call it: Some Nice Nazarene Ideas (take it or leave it).\n\nIf the former have their way, the Manual turns into a dead document that leaves no room for discussion or conversation. Why have a General Assembly if there are no resolutions to debate; no discussions to be had; no changes to be made? Cancel your hotel reservations in Kansas City 2027, no need to go.\n\nPer my usual attempt, I advocate for neither extreme but a middle way. The Manual is more than a suggestion. It’s our agreed upon directive. Ordained ministers promise to abide within its pages. Should there be disagreement (and there may be times of disagreement), we need not be disagreeable. We need not air our dirty laundry on social media. We need not lambast leadership. We need not print or post disparaging comments against those with a differing opinion. Let’s have kind, godly discussions and think groups. Utilize the Global theological conference, PALCON, M-25, other conferences on all the regions, and provide “safe” events for charitable, theological conversations. We can pray together and seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance. We can suggest changes in a considerate manner desiring the Holy Spirit to move upon the collective body. Then as gather at a General Assembly, the delegates vote as the Holy Spirit directs.\n\nConversation is our friend, not the enemy. Let’s reason together and come to a place like in Acts 15 where following a theological debate James concluded, “it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us…” (Acts 15: 28). Isn’t that what we should be saying at the conclusion of every General Assembly? “It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us, that the Manual is our next four year agreed upon document.”\n\nWe need the Manual. We also need the Manual to be a living document filled with sanctified love. It should be our unified document not our dividing rod.\n\nDisagree with the Church of the Nazarene? Willingly Leave.\n\nThere is no gun to my head forcing me to stay in the Church of the Nazarene. I can leave at any time. Dr. Raymond Hurn said as much, at the time of my ordination.\n\n“If ever you do not agree with the Church of the Nazarene, will you willingly turn in your credentials?” he asked.\n\n“I will,” I said.\n\nSome have said that the relationship between the church and the ordained minister is like a marriage. “You don’t walk away from a marriage, because you disagree. You stay and fight for the marriage,” they say.\n\nOrdination is not like a marriage. No one asked me Ray Hurn’s question before my nuptials. No one said, “if you ever disagree with your wife, will you turn in your marriage license?” Ordination includes a “pre-nup” element in other words. Disagree? Then willingly leave. No hard feelings.\n\nThere are bits and pieces I might change in the Manual. The book is revised every four years. It isn’t the Bible. The Manual doesn’t end with the warning like in Revelation 22:18-19 about adding and subtracting words to the manuscript. Still there is not a lot I would edit– including the statement on human sexuality (Paragraph 31). I like the statement on human sexuality. As a General Assembly delegate, I voted for it. I was one of the 97 percenters that did.\n\nOn the flip side, there are those who disagree with other significant portions of the Manual (Article 4 and the Nazarene understanding of scripture, women in ministry, infant baptism, speaking in tongues, I suppose there are other matters too). The church’s position on these matters were in place when the minister walked down the church’s center aisle and knelt before a congregation too. The Manual hasn’t changed (for the most part) since the General Superintendent placed his/her hands on the minister’s head and ordained them. If disparity exists, it’s the clergyperson who has changed, not the church. Of course having divergent ideas regarding most issues rarely gets the attention that opposition to the Paragraph 31 attracts. Extremists have gone to their corners like a WWE wrestling match on that one.\n\nMy point is simply this: if one doesn’t agree with the CotN on weighty matters, no one is forced to stay. One may leave at any time. I don’t mean that to sound harsh or overly critical. I’m not suggesting forcing people out. But no one is married to the church. It’s not a divorce when one leaves (although I do acknowledge, it can feel like it). If the church and minister grow apart (for whatever reason), let the affiliation end with an amicable separation.\n\nIf one would rather be in a fundamentalist church, there are plenty of them out there. If one would rather be in a progressive church, there are plenty of those too. In fact those churches, with their declining attendances, would welcome the transfer with open arms. They would cheer a new member for his/her “courage” for leaving the CotN. But is it courage? It’s doing what was agreed upon at the time of ordination. It’s in the “pre-nup.”\n\n“If there is major disagreement, I’ll leave.” It’s what I told old Ray Hurn. No fuss. No mess. No drama. No burning bridges on the way out. No disparaging comments about the church. No social media blasts on how terrible the church has become. No name calling about those in leadership. No back and forth, tit for tat. None of that. I will go and wish my remaining friends well.\n\nBut like I said, I doubt that will be me. I like it here.\n\nThe Story of the Very Mean Shepherd by B.B. Wolf\n\nOnce upon a time there was a mean shepherd. Very mean. He wanted me to starve. Seriously, he refused to allow me get any tasty sheep from the flock he was tending. I tried. Believe me, I tried. When I thought he wasn’t looking, I hopped through the bushes, about to grab a yummy piece of mutton…then, “Whack!” He hit me right over the head with that long stick of his. He calls the stick a crook. He’s the crook. I should file assault charges against the guy.\n\nThere was another time when he was bringing the herd in from a pasture, and one of the sheep got away. He didn’t realize it. I did. I saw the whole thing. The dumb sheep wandered off from the rest of the group, not paying attention to its surroundings at all. The mindless sheep was totally lost. I waited and waited. Not wanting to be detected by that overly aggressive shepherd, I knew if I just bided my time, I’d have a tasty dinner. Lamb chops are a delight if seasoned properly, but I digress. There were 100 sheep. Surely that annoying sheepherder wouldn’t notice one missing ewe.\n\nI can hear him counting, “97, 98, 99… where’s 100? Number 100 is missing.”\n\nHe noticed. No joke. Then like a fool, he went out looking for that lousy directionally challenged sheep. Of course, I was in hiding ready to nab the lost wanderer. Never expecting that the bully with a crook would leave 99 protected sheep for the one unprotected sheep. Who would do that? He did. Wouldn’t you know it, he found that lamb too; tossed her over his shoulders and carried her back to the pen. Ugh. I hate that shepherd.\n\nAbout the pen, you’ll never guess where that narcoleptic shepherd “sleeps.” In the door way. How can you sleep in a door way? You can’t. But that’s where he plants himself. Every night. All night. He’s like the gate to the pen. You can’t get to the sheep unless you get by him and his crook. He must sleep with one eye open, because I can never get pass that guy. I’m pretty sure, he is wise to me and my schemes.\n\nBut I’ve got a new plan. It’s fool proof. I’m going to get a sheep costume. I saw them in the Halloween store in town. I’ll dress up like a sheep. Wear the sheep’s clothing, if you will. How hard can it be to pretend to be a dumb sheep? It can’t be that baaaaaaad. (Sorry for the dad joke. My pups hate my puns). But I’ll fool that shepherd in my costume; get in the pasture and then take any sheep I want. By the time, that dumb sheepman realizes I’m not a sheep, I’ll be long gone with my dinner. Talk about fast food, I’ll be hoofing it out of there quicker than you can say, “Mary had a little lamb.” My name ain’t Mary, but, with a little luck, I’ll have a lamb. This plan is pure genius. Slurp!\n\nHere’s the deal: My goal in life is to get as many sheep as possible. Trick ‘em. Steal ‘em. Trap ‘em. Fool ‘em. Grab ‘em. I don’t care how I get them, I just want to get them. I’m relentless. I will keep trying until I get one too. The ones close to the shepherd, the ones practically glued to the guy, are nearly impossible to nab. But some of those dumb sheep will get their eyes off the shepherd and start playing too close to the boundaries the shepherd has set up. Those ones will surely step over the line and when they do, I’ll be there waiting. Licking my chops.\n\nYou can be sure of this, I’ll keep trying or my name isn’t “Big Bad Wolf.”\n\nMoral of the story: The safest place is next to the Shepherd (capital “S”).\n\nThat ain’t holiness\n\n“You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.” -Inigo Montoya, The Princess Bride.\n\nThe theological circles I run in are known for their adherence to holiness. We take serious God’s call to “Be holy as I am holy” (Leviticus 19:2 and 1 Peter 1:16). Sadly, it seems some in my tribe are confused as to what “holiness” entails.\n\nAllow me to offer a few tips (just “a few,” my list is not exhaustive) on holiness. Hopefully this clears up some of the muddle…\n\nIf your version of holiness is….\n\nmore about you than Jesus, that ain’t holiness.\n\nunkind, unforgiving, unjoyful, unhumble that ain’t holiness.\n\nunloving toward neighbors and enemies that ain’t holiness.\n\nuncaring toward the poor and needy, that ain’t holiness.\n\nfocused on outward persona rather than inward purity, that ain’t holiness.\n\nchildish not child-like, that ain’t holiness.\n\nbullying others on-line or in person, that ain’t holiness.\n\ncomparable to the Pharisees, that ain’t holiness.\n\nhypocritical or hyper-critical, that ain’t holiness.\n\ncliquish more than a welcoming, that ain’t holiness.\n\nsnooty and gossipy, that ain’t holiness.\n\nattention seeking more than Jesus seeking, that ain’t holiness.\n\nenvious, greedy, lustful or prideful, that ain’t holiness.\n\nrude, harsh and self-seeking, that ain’t holiness.\n\nbombastic and belligerent, that ain’t holiness.\n\nrecord keeping of wrongs, that ain’t holiness.\n\ncondemning the sin in others while covering up one’s sinful habits, that ain’t holiness.\n\npushing people out of the kingdom rather than inviting folks in, that ain’t holiness.\n\nlacking in generosity, that ain’t holiness.\n\ncritical of social media mudslinging, then promptly slinging mud on social media, that ain’t holiness.\n\nfull of “gotcha questions” meant to trap and belittle, that ain’t holiness.\n\nchampioning “truth” while telling half-truths and outright lies, that ain’t holiness.\n\ndepicted by who you hate rather than who you love, that ain’t holiness.\n\nfueling heated arguments rather than godly conversations, that ain’t holiness.\n\nblind to the giant log in one’s own eye, yet judging the speck in someone else’s eye, that ain’t holiness.\n\nmore about legalism than charity, liberty and grace, that ain’t holiness.\n\ndismissing the above list and getting defensive about the areas that reflect your own poor attitudes and behaviors, that ain’t holiness either.\n\nAnything other than being like Jesus, quite simply… it ain’t holiness. Period.\n\nDear English majors, I know, “ain’t” isn’t a word. I also know the “holiness” that some folks proport to be “protecting” or “promoting” isn’t holiness.\n\nIt’s something, but it’s not holiness.\n\nThe Best Residence for the Aging Church of the Nazarene\n\nThe Church of the Nazarene (CotN) was founded on October 13, 1908. There are only three people currently living in the world who are older than the CotN: Maria Branyas born March 4, 1907; Tomiko Itooka born May 23, 1908; and Inah Lucas born June 8, 1908. That’s it. Just three people. Presumably none were at Pilot Point, Texas 116 years ago.\n\nObviously, denominations don’t age like people. Unlike people, many denominations are dead– they just don’t know it. Which got me thinking about the supercentenarian, Church of the Nazarene. If the CotN were an elderly person, what kind of care would be required for the old gal?\n\nThe options for the elderly are:\n\nHospice care is mostly for people with less than a year to live. While there are those who exaggerate the demise of the CotN, no one thinks she will be dead in a year. Hospice is not the option.\n\nPalliative care is a treatment plan where all know the patient is not getting better, but health care providers try to make the person comfortable. It’s holding the hand and saying kind words until they pass away. It might be sooner, but it’s probably later. Is the Board of General Superintendents (BGS) simply holding the hand of a sick and probably dying denomination; offering little hope, but whispering nice (overly rosy) things in her ear? At times, it might seem like it, but there is still strong life bubbling in various places.\n\nMemory care is provided to the patient who has forgotten who they are. Like in palliative care, the plan is to make the person comfortable– not letting them hurt themselves or others. Some might say that the CotN has forgotten who she is and the principles on which she once stood. They conclude that people are hurt because of her misremembering. But unlike the horrible corridors of a memory care unit, many still know, love and desire to live into the CotN’s history. Regaining those early principles is the challenge, but its history hasn’t been forgotten.\n\nDoes anyone think the CotN is ready for Independent living? Many argue she is more divided than ever (see Jesus’ comments of feeble houses in times of division in Matthew 12). She isn’t as strong as she used to be. She needs help. Independent living seems out of the question at this contentious point.\n\nThat leaves Assisted Living as the last and best option. The church is not dead, but she needs support. Factionist’s witch hunts on the right and tantrum throwers on the left have threatened to end the via media that has characterized the church from its inception. Each far side’s critics claim the church is drifting toward the other’s extreme. They vocalize its doom on social media and try to pull her to their side. A tug-of-war has ensued for the CotN’s heart and soul. She needs assistance not a mortician.\n\nMore than ever the CotN needs leadership. The original BGS member, Phineas F Bresee, famously said (not original to him): In essentials unity; in non-essentials liberty; in all things charity. Current BGS members, charged with giving vision and direction, must remind the church of Bresee’s words. Shout it, if necessary. Like a traffic cop on a busy intersection point us back to the via media. Silence is death. It’s time to be heard. The rest of us must then follow in assisting the church to the via media. It’s moving (or staying) in the center of the narrow road, away from the extremists on either side.\n\nA healthy denominational assisted living is located on the via media and it’s where the CotN best resides. I’m still hopeful that’s will be our address.\n\nEdited to read: This is NOT a new or a negative concept. The Church has always required ASSISTED LIVING. It’s the Lamb and His Bride; a marriage made in heaven, where God’s Holy people are empowered by the Holy Spirit to do Christ’s bidding for the Father’s glory.\n\nEdited to also add: I wrote on the Church of the Nazarene’s need for the middle road in 2021. You can read it here: https://wordpress.com/post/robprinceblog.com/1958\n\nWhat Can Be Learned from the Closure of Eastern Nazarene College?\n\nWhen the news broke that Eastern Nazarene College (ENC) was closing last week, it felt like a friend had died. Not a friend that you see every day, or even once in a while, but a friend nonetheless. Hearing that the doors were closing for good brought a deep sense of sadness over me. The news hit me hard for someone with no real connection to the school other than my “Nazarene-nerdy-ness.”\n\nI have friends who graduated from ENC and who have been on the faculty and staff there. I heard stories of God’s faithfulness and provision through the life of ENC. I had only been on the campus of Eastern Nazarene College one time. It was back a few years, before Covid, we went on the Sunday morning to the Wollaston Church of the Nazarene on the campus of ENC. We walked around and saw the buildings. I was surprised on how close the campus was to the ocean. I thought it had such potential. Now it’s closed.\n\nWhen a loved one that I haven’t seen in a while passes, I think, “I knew she was sick, just not that sick. I wish I had known…” Could anything have been done to help ENC if we comprehended her dire circumstances? Maybe. Maybe not. I wish we had known…\n\nSometimes when attending the funeral of older relatives, I peruse the room and see kinfolk that I’ve only seen at funerals, the holidays or a random reunion. When greeting the distant cousins at the wake, I think, “Who will be next? The matriarch has died. Who will be the next family member eulogized?” ENC’s closing made me think about the other Nazarene institutions in the same manner. Are others on life support? Is ENC’s passing a harbinger of more trouble in the Church of the Nazarene or is it an anomaly?\n\nI want to think ENC’s demise was caused by a dwindling student and Nazarene population in the Northeast. It wasn’t helped by an over saturated higher education system in Boston and the plethora of options from which prospective New England students might choose. I’m sure there are many more factors than the ones spouted off by some of my conspiracy-first-truth-later brothers and sisters on social media. Still, was ENC’s demise the first of many deaths or the unexpected and unfortunate passing in an otherwise healthy organization?\n\nI fear it’s the former, not the latter. If it is the former, what can we do to stop the bleeding? How can we better communicate the urgency of those in dire straights without causing my aforementioned Chicken-Little-like, brothers and sisters (these social-media-dilettantes are on all sides of the theological/political spectrums, by the way) from further miscommunicating ill-informed opinions (I’m not casting stones. I’ve been there. I’ve probably had my share of ill-informed opinions too).\n\nHow can we help the other institutions stay afloat and not hurt them, that’s the point?\n\nMaybe now is simply a time to mourn the passing of a dear friend, but sometime soon we must examine our reality and make the necessary adjustments so more funerals don’t follow.\n\nShould the Church of the Nazarene and the Global Methodist Church merge?\n\nThe United Methodist (UM) church is in the process of splitting. The largest number who have left the UM are those who have formed the Global Methodist (GM) Church. The main “dividing line” between the UM and GM is that the GM holds to a traditional view of marriage, like the Church of the Nazarene (CotN). In fact, many statements made about the new Global Methodist church could end with the phrase “like the Church of the Nazarene.” So the question becomes, if the Global Methodists and the Nazarenes are so much alike, should these two groups seek to merge into one bigger, stronger denomination?\n\nThe Global Methodists are still forming as not every church disaffiliating with the UM has done so. As such, the membership numbers are a little difficult to pin down. There are approximately, 4500+ GM churches and 4,417 CotN churches in the United States. When the dust has settled the CotN might not be able to claim to the be the “largest holiness church.” The GM may have those bragging rights (in a sanctified manner, of course) in the United States, at least.\n\nThe GM has some groups from outside the United States, the CotN is in 164 world areas. Globally, the CotN is positioned to welcome the GM churches and give structure, guidance to a truly a worldwide mission effort.\n\nThe educational institutions were a sticking point in the some of the merger discussions with the Wesleyan Church/Church of the Nazarene in years past. The close proximity between colleges raised questions of viability and sustainability. That would not be an issue with a GM/CotN merger. The GM has a few “recommended” colleges but none that are specifically “GM” universities. Again, the CotN has eight universities in the United States and Canada and over 50 educational institutions around the world. Instantly the GM would have colleges of its own and education points around the world.\n\nHistorically, the Church of the Nazarene is a church of mergers. Part of its DNA has been to find like-minded holiness people and come together for greater affectedness in reaching the world for Jesus. A GM/CotN merger would provide the greatest application of this mindset in its history. Instantly, the new church would have influence and a greater awareness across the United States and world.\n\nThe new church, a Nazarene/Methodist Church, would provide a freshness to the CotN that has been lacking in these challenging times. A Pilot-Point-like excitement could develop with new brothers and sisters coming together. With more voting delegates, it would eliminate the “good old boy” network of familiarity and nepotism that at times has plagued the CotN. Leaders from both groups, would rise to the top forging a fresh glory for a global outreach. It would provide more preaching points and greater opportunity for evangelism. A united holiness effort could infuse a Holy Spirit empowered energy and be exactly what is needed today.\n\nCertainly there are obstacles to a Global Methodist/Nazarene merger. But what better time to discuss such a move than before the Global Methodists church is fully established and when the Church of the Nazarene could use a renewed vision. This might be the best time to form a new, united holiness church called to make Christ-like disciples in the nations.\n\nIs it too late for Revival in the Church of the Nazarene (USA/Canada)?\n\nThere is no question on the necessity of the church to be revived. A quick look at the numbers reveal that in-person attendance is plummeting. Churches are closing. New churches are not being started. Young people are not being called to pastoral ministries. The clergy along with the people in the pews are aging. The writing is on the wall. It’s only a matter of time before the funeral processional begins. Something needs to happen (read: REVIVAL) or the Church of the Nazarene will die!* But is it too late for her to turn around?\n\nLuke writes of the revival following Pentecost. It can happen. The church was adding people every day (Acts 2:47). In a short period of time, the number of believing men grew to 5,000 (Acts 4:4). In spite of opposition from within (Ananias and Sapphira) and pressure on the outside, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number” (Acts 5:14). Revival was happening. It was the work of the Holy Spirit and the believers were in “one heart and one mind” (Acts 4:32).\n\nThe Holy Spirit is still at work, but would anyone declare the Church of the Nazarene to be in “one heart and mind”? The church seems to be more divided than ever. There’s too much “us vs. them.” There are too many labels. There are too many sub-groups and factions. Social media loudly clamors for attention on all sides. There are too many separate entities fighting for their corner of the table. The U.S.S. Nazarene is sinking, does it matter who is sitting at the captain’s table?\n\nIt’s never too late for the Holy Spirit to right the ship. But it sure seems like the window of revival is closing for the Church of the Nazarene. There are those who say, “Let her die.” I’m not one of them. She can be revived. There is resurrection hope.\n\nThe answer seems simple to write, but hard to obtain. Quit fighting. Quit dividing. Quit weaponizing social media. Quit demonizing those with a slightly different theological bent. Quit. Just quit. This is not a call that one side or the other needs to quit, every side must quit the chatter. Jesus highly priestly prayer calls all believers to be unified (see John 17:20-21). Can’t the church live into that prayer? Can the church be on one heart and mind?\n\nIs it too late for revival? It’s never too late. The church willing to humbly settle its differences in an age of division and angst? Are its members willing to pray along with Jesus to be one? That’s the question.\n\nIf it is too late for a revived Church of the Nazarene, don’t mourn too long. God will rise up new groups like in the late 1800’s when the Church of the Nazarene or the Holiness Church of Christ or the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America started. These new groups will do what the current version of the Church of the Nazarene is not always doing. A united people who will proclaim holiness of heart and life and offer good news to the least of these. God isn’t impressed with brand names. If the current version of Church of the Nazarene isn’t cutting it, God will raise up a church who will.\n\nIs it too late? No. But it is getting late…\n\n*Obviously, there are exceptions. There are good churches doing good things. I am super biased but I think Flint Central Church is such an exception.\n\nImagining if my dad had not been Born Again\n\nLike George Bailey, Jimmy Stewart’s character in It’s a Wonderful Life, so much would be different if my dad had not been BORN AGAIN.\n\nWhen my dad stumbled into a tiny Nazarene church 64 years ago and subsequently met Jesus, he was a high school dropout, auto-working, alcoholic and with three kids and a wife who wanted a divorce.\n\nHow would the world be different had my dad not met Jesus? Where do I begin?\n\nMy parents would have been divorced.\n\nI never would have been born.\n\nKarla would be married probably to some rich tycoon that she met when working in the airlines (she might have been richer, but not happier).\n\nNo Alex. No Ben. No Conrad.\n\nNone of the people that I have met and helped as a pastor would be at the same place. Jesus would have sent someone to those folks (He is faithful) but it would have been different.\n\nWould my sisters have been as successful as they were? Probably not. They certainly wouldn’t have met their spouses. Pam met Lloyd in church. Beth met Jon at Olivet.\n\nMy brother, most certainly, would not have become a preacher; not met his wife, Teri, they met at Olivet too; and not have helped all the people he was able to aid throughout his ministry and life.\n\nSame is true for all of my parents’ grandkids from my siblings (all went to Olivet).\n\nProbably my dad would have died young because of his alcoholism—like his parents and grandparents and great grandparents before him.\n\nMy mom, with just a high school diploma and three little kids, would have had a difficult life as a single mom. She too didn’t know Jesus at the time, who knows what kind of career or job she might have been able to get.\n\nWe all know the tragedies of the unhealthy mix of poverty, fatherless homes, and alcoholism. My family would probably have landed square in the middle of that whole statistical mess.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine all that would be different had my dad not made the best decision of his life to follow Jesus after visiting that little Nazarene church.\n\nAs we recognize dads this weekend, I can’t help but appreciate the Holy Spirit’s prevenient grace extended to my dad that led him to a church on a Sunday night 64 years ago. I’m thankful that he looked at his life and knew changes needed to be made. I’m so glad for the prayer he mumbled out by his bedside that night (Remember: the power of prayer is in the One who hears the prayer, not the one who prays the prayer). I’m so incredibly thankful that Jesus saved my dad! Without that happening so many lives would be different today.\n\nDads, your decisions make a difference. They affect more than you. Like my dad so long ago, make godly, faithful choices. You will not regret it! Neither will your kids!\n\nHappy Father’s Day!\n\nThe Toughest Job in the Church of the Nazarene is NOT General Superintendent\n\nThe toughest job in the Church of the Nazarene is NOT General Superintendent. It’s not regional director, district superintendent or pastoring a large church. By far the most difficult job is university (or college… I’m looking at you in Quincy, MA) president. The difficulty lies in the fact that so many groups think they have a right to tell the president how to do the job. The list is long: faculty, students, staff, board of trustees, parents, general superintendents, the accrediting associations, the government, athletic governing bodies, local church pastors, fringe Nazarene groups like The Holiness Partnership and Nazarene’s for Peace, and a multitude of groups from outside the Church of the Nazarene. Everybody believes they have a right to the university president’s ear.\n\nThese vested voices are coupled with the burden of educating a student body who endured the pandemic, deals with social media pressures and life in these turbulent times. Ask any college (not just Nazarene) and they will tell you that their mental health services are being used at an all time high. Students feel the weight and pressure of college life like never before. Along with such realities come the societal stress aftermath (drugs, alcohol, depression, suicide) that offer the opposite of help. The college presidents’ job is much more complicated than simply educating young adults.\n\nMoreover the colleges are becoming less and less “Nazarene.” One school’s Nazarene student body population is 7%. It’s hard to maintain Nazarene identity when less and less students know anything about the Church of the Nazarene. (Olivet’s attempt to address this issue by offering a free four year tuition to the NYC senior class participants was well received by students and their families, not so well received by the other colleges. The “Olivet Way” was seen as pushing the other colleges out of the way).\n\nOf course, the other main issue (maybe the biggest issue) pressing on college presidents is money. It’s expensive to maintain a Christian university these days. There are less traditional college-age people in the population. Less students are attending college Less tuition means less money, yet inflation doesn’t stop. The pressure of keeping everything afloat is enormous. A Christianity Today article from 2023 stated that 18 Christian colleges closed since the pandemic. You can read the article here. A few more are on the brink of closing (including a Nazarene school? Who knows). The economics of a Christian university is challenging.\n\nAdded to all of this the Church of the Nazarene is currently going through a shakeup in its university presidents. Olivet’s president began in 2021, Ambrose, Mount Vernon and Eastern installed new presidents in the past year; Point Loma is in the process of electing a new president; Northwest’s president has announced he will retire next year. MidAmerica and Trevecca both have presidents who are in their 70’s and will likely retire in the next few years. This change in leadership may not be bad. It will be different for each campus. Bringing in the right person is paramount for the school (obviously) but also for the denomination.\n\nAll this to say, we need to be in prayer for the universities and their presidents. Christian higher education leadership is the toughest job in the Church of the Nazarene. The second toughest job is youth pastor (that’s a blog for another day).\n\nCollege and Seminary President Prayer List:\n\nAmbrose University— Rev. Dr. Bryce Ashlin-Mayo\n\nEastern Nazarene College – Rev. Dr. Colleen Derr\n\nMidAmerica Nazarene University—Dr. David Spittal\n\nMount Vernon Nazarene University—Dr. Carson D.

Dr. Jeren Rowell\n\nWhat if Pastors (including DSs) were Compensated Equally?\n\nCould Acts 4:32-34 be applied to the way we operate our churches today? The plural use of “churches” is intentional because this passage and the one in 2 Corinthians is often applied to a “church” (singular). But what if the verse was applied to multiple churches on an entire Nazarene district or (or if I were really radical) across denominational lines.\n\nAll the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had. With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God’s grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them. (Acts 4:32-34)\n\nThe Macedonian churches were applying the activity of Acts 4 way beyond their local setting. Paul wrote how the Macedonians responded to the financial crisis of the Jerusalem church: In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity. For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord’s people (2 Corinthians 8:2-4).\n\nHave you seen any churches (not those in “extreme poverty” like the Macedonians, but any church, anywhere) welling up with rich generosity, not for their own wants and desires but, for a church down the road? Have you seen them giving “beyond their ability” to give to bless another church? Have you seen any church “pleading… for the privilege” to give to another church? Raising money not so that local church could build a nicer sanctuary, but raising monies so the church down the road could keep their sanctuary doors open or provide a living wage for its pastor.\n\nRadical Idea Alert: What if churches across a district or region pooled their monies and every pastor was compensated equally. What if we compensated faithfulness or years of service or academic achievement. What if size didn’t matter. While we are at it, what if District Superintendents were included in the same salary pool. They were likewise compensated on years of faithful service just like every other pastor on the district. No more. No less.\n\nBack-to-reality Alert: Who’s kidding who? In the first century preachers were not getting paid (don’t tell Karla) and there were no church mortgages or sound systems or denominations or… well… you get the idea. We all agree there are differences between the 1st and the 21st century. But what if we shared a little more than we do? Collaborated a little better. Prayed together more often. What if churches and pastors acted more like teammates rather than competitors. What if instead of becoming territorial if another church is planted in one’s area, we rejoiced. What if some churches had food pantries and other churches in the same area distributed baby supplies or helped out with utility bills.\n\nWhat if churches shared people resources too. What if musicians or singers or masons and carpenters would freely work at churches other than their own. What if pastors in stronger churches were willing to step in and help in creative ways with struggling churches. What if church folks stopped being/thinking like the rest of the world with a “me first,” “my family first,” “my church first,” or “my country first” selfish mindset and instead had a kingdom mindset of rich generosity to all.\n\nMaybe the New Testament church got some things right (minus the hot mess known as “Corinth First Church”). Maybe, just maybe, if churches today were blessing others, like the church in Acts 4 or the Macedonian churches, God’s grace would powerfully be at work in all our churches.\n\nMy Graduation Party PTSD\n\nAs the calendar turns to June, it can only mean one thing: High School Graduation Party Season. It’s a time of year that brings forth a bit of PTSD in me.\n\nWhen I graduated from Garden City West High School High School (Go Tigers! West is best, East is least!!), my folks threw me a party. We had a picture board (highlighting my senior year afro which should be the reason for my PTSD, but it’s not), a trophy display (second place in the cub scout pinewood derby, among other similarly prestigious achievements) and cake (Sam’s didn’t exist then. My mom and Dunkin Hines provide the cake). It was a grand affair. But my brother, Fred, was unable to attend because he was a poor seminary student in Kansas City at the time.\n\nFred, too poor to travel, but not too poor to help me celebrate, sent a singing telegram from a guy dressed in a gorilla costume. Nothing says, “Happy Graduation” like a singing gorilla, right? Instead of just some stranger dressed as a gorilla, I thought it was my brother, Fred, in the gorilla costume. I thought Fred had lied about not coming home in an effort to surprise me on my happy day.\n\nNow for the PTSD: At the sight of the singing gorilla, not thinking it was a stranger but Fred, I ran and jumped into the singing gorilla’s arms. Once in the gorilla’s clutches (PTSD alert), I quickly realized that the dude singing with the spicy burrito breathe was not Fred. It was a stranger. I was in his arms and like the song from that era, the one-hit-wonder Sérgio Mendes’, classic, Never Gonna Let you go; I thought the gorilla was, in fact, never gonna let me go. He kept singing and singing, all the while hugging me with a King-Kong-like grip.\n\nIf you know me, you know, I am not much of a “hugger.” I hug Karla, that’s about it. I wish I were a hugger, I’m not. Hugs aren’t bad. They are fine signs of affection. I just can’t bring myself to doing it very often. It’s odd. It’s weird. It’s a societal faux pax. For this I blame the gorilla and his never-gonna-let-me-go grip. I’m not sure if I’m afraid of never being let go or never wanting to smell that spicy burrito breathe again.\n\nHere’s the good news, even though I might not be a hugger, our Heavenly Father is. Like in the prodigal son story, when the boy returns the Bible says, “But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him” (Luke 15:20). Our Father is waiting to embrace us. He wants us in His family. No matter where we’ve been or how far gone we are. He longs for us to be home with Him. Best of all, Paul wrote: For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 8:38-39). In other words, our Father never lets us go (and He doesn’t have spicy burrito breathe). Praise the Lord!\n\nOnly 49 USA/Canada Nazarene Pastors Are Under 30— A Few Suggestions to Address the Problem\n\nOn January 1, 1990 Karla and I packed everything we owned into a U-Haul and drove from Alanson, Michigan (where I had been the youth pastor) to Bad Axe, Michigan. It would be my first church as a solo pastor. I was 26 years old. By today’s standards, I would have been a rarity.\n\nThere are 4,331 lead pastors in the Church of the Nazarene in USA/Canada, only 49 lead/solo pastors are under 30 years old. Moreover, just 10.1% of the pastors are under 40; where as 40.1% are over 60.* These statistics lead one to ask several questions:\n\nIs God not calling young people into ministry these days?\n\nAre young people not heeding the call?\n\nDo would-be, young Nazarene pastors disagree Nazarene theology and polity**\n\nWhat is happening and what will happen when these old pastors start retiring if there is no one to replace them?\n\nClearly, the dwindling of young pastors is a problem. What can be done to increase the total of ministers under 40? It begins in middle school, maybe earlier. Here are a few suggestions:\n\nPastors modeling Christlike behavior. Seeing more young people called into ministry begins with healthy pastors modeling before the congregation a life in the Spirit and a joy in the calling of God.\n\nPreacher’s talking about the joys of pastoring. Not every assignment is a joy, but faithful pastoring is rewarding. Being able to share the joys new babies in baptism or dedication; experiencing the new birth of a young teenager in Christ; having the best “seat” in the house for weddings; helping families through the rough patches of life; and saying the closing words at the funeral of a saint are the joys of pastoring that cannot be overstated. Good, godly pastors are the best antidote for more pastors.\n\nParents/grandparents speaking kindly and appreciative of those in the ministry. Much of a young person’s knowledge of the ministry comes from what is spoken about the clergy in their home. Gossip, backbiting and hateful words are heard and remembered by children. Likewise, kind, appreciative words go a long way in establishing a respect for the ministry.\n\nProfessors speaking favorably of pastoral ministry. In particular, speaking positively and expressing the need for small town pastor in the college classroom. Many ministry majors have been steered away from pastoral ministry from the horror stories heard in the university. “Small town or small churches are small for a reason,” they’ve been told; “people are stuck in their ways; they won’t listen to a young pastor;” and “a small church will eat you up and spit you out.” Such lessons, while may be true is some cases, but do not help encourage those 30 and under to become small town/small church pastors.\n\nThe denomination could offer the elimination student debt for ministers of small churches. Making pastoring a small church more affordable should be a priority for the denomination. Getting creative with funding of small churches is essential. Many churches have unloaded their parsonages in the last twenty years and now cannot afford to pay a young pastor (often saddled with debt) a living full time salary.\n\nDistricts setting up small town/small church grants could also assist with making small church pastoral assignments affordable. Districts could set up funds to assist pastors salaries or health insurance costs. This is not a totally new concept. When I was pastoring Bad Axe, the district paid half our health insurance, since the church could not afford it. Similar incentive plans to assist small churches which would help in the recruitment and retention of pastors in smaller settings. Most districts have enough excess funds to afford an incentive program.\n\nChurch members recognizing they have two choices: get younger or die. Choose the former, then do whatever it takes to convince a young pastor to come to the church and then do whatever it takes to support that pastor. Choose the latter, do nothing and watch the church die a slow agonizing death.\n\nSadly too often young people have been given a negative picture of small churches from bad pastors, gossip in their homes, negativity from some college professors, the lack of affordability and have decided, “Thanks but no thanks.” Churches must be willing to turn over the keys (and purse strings) to a new generation of pastors; district superintendents must be willing to endorse and support young pastors; and young men and women must heed the ministerial calling or there won’t be a church to turn over to the coming generations.\n\n*The numbers only reflect lead/solo pastors. There are plenty of pastors who serve as associate pastors in some capacity who are under the ager of 30. Some of them will become lead/solo pastors. Still 49 pastors under the age of 30 seems like an absurdly low number.\n\n**The argument that 30 and under people have disagreements with our theology and/or politics of many people in the churches seems more antidotal than factual. For example, many young people agree with the church’s traditional Biblical position regarding human sexuality. They don’t support with the all-too-often posture toward those who disagree. They don’t like the anger and hatred spewed. Many love Jesus and the church.\n\nConrad’s Celebrating His First Birthday and the Greatest Gift\n\nMy grandson, Conrad, will have completed his first trip around the sun on Saturday. Hooray! Conrad’s first year of life has seen the Michigan Wolverines win a national championship in football and the Detroit Lions play in the conference final. Based only on football, he’s already had a better first year, than my previous 60. This Saturday we will be celebrating year #1.\n\nMy son and wife, Alex and Blaire, are throwing a big bash for the occasion. I don’t remember if my parents threw me a “One Year” birthday party for me or not, I suspect they did not. Will Conrad remember the Saturday’s party? I doubt it. Even so, a big group will be there for the happy day!\n\nI’m not sure if there will be a candle for him to blow out or a cake to eat. He’s a Prince, so there had better be ice cream (we Princes love our ice cream). We will probably sing “Happy Birthday to you” at some point. There will be presents to open. If he’s like most kids, he will probably be more enthralled by the wrapping paper, bows and the packaging than the actual gift inside. None of those things really matter, as a grandparent, I will be happy if he is happy.\n\nI’m learning being a grandparent is different from being a parent. I recently read that a mom to her kid says: “You get what you get. Deal with it.” But that same mom as a grandma says: “Would you like your grilled cheese sandwich cut into stars or hearts?”\n\nIt’s true. As grandparents to a soon-to-be one-year-old infant, we want the best for Conrad. Of course, the best, the absolute best, gift is Jesus. More than any gift he will receive on Saturday, we can’t wait for him to receive the gift of Jesus into his heart and life. He’s too young to understand spiritual things. He won’t receive Jesus this Saturday. But one day, one great day, he will have the opportunity to accept Jesus into his life. When that day comes Jesus says that the angels in heaven will be throwing a party for the occasion (see Luke 15:7). I’m not sure that there will be streamers, balloons, ice cream and cake in heaven, but there will be a party!\n\nThe Bible reminds us that this life is short. Conrad is at the starting gate; I’m eyeing the finish line. James 4:14 says, “What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.” James’ point, in light of eternity, we aren’t occupying space on this spinning globe for very long. So, make sure you’ve received the great gift, Jesus. The parties on earth are fine (even if the kid won’t remember birthday #1). A much bigger imperative is to make sure that our names are written on the party banners in heaven.\n\nThat’s a party you’ll remember and rejoice in for all eternity!\n\nQuestions for the Six Nazarene Pastors who are 90+\n\nOf 4,331 lead pastors in the USA/Canada Church of the Nazarene, six men or women are nonagenarians. That is not a new sect or denomination. Nonagenarian is not the same as non-denominational. Nonagenarian is a person between the age of 90-99. There are currently six pastors, 90 years or older, who are still active lead pastors in the Church of the Nazarene in USA/Canada. Wow!\n\nThat’s impressive. I’d like to meet these nonagenarians. I have some questions for them.\n\nHave they been pastoring their whole adult life?\n\nIs this a second career? A third career?\n\nHow do they stay relevant?\n\nDo they consider those church members in their 60’s as the “youth group”?\n\nWere they ordained by Hardy Powers or GB Williamson?\n\nDo they ever catch themselves saying, “When I was a kid back in the Great depression…”?\n\nAt District Assembly do they ask to give their pastor’s report first, just in case they are in heaven before District Assembly adjourns. (There have been times I’ve prayed to be in heaven before District Assembly adjourns).\n\nDo they call Dr. Jim Diehl to preach a revival so their people can hear from someone younger (Dr. Diehl will be 87 on his next birthday and is still preaching).\n\nThe Bible is always fresh, but do they run out of new stories to tell when still preaching in their 90’s?\n\nDo they consider anything written by Fanny Crosby as “contemporary music”?\n\nWhen they read Caleb’s self-description in Joshua 14, “I am today, eighty-five years old! I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I’m just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then” (Joshua 14:10-11); do they think, “wait until he gets a little older then he will know…. Blah, blah, blah…”\n\nAre they still pastoring because they can’t afford to live on their social security or meager Nazarene pastor’s pension?\n\nHave they inquired about the special provision in the manual that states: “If a pastor has been pastoring since before the presiding General Superintendent was born, their church gets a free pass on paying it’s World Evangelism Fund (Note: that’s NOT in the Manual).\n\nMy real questions are: What lessons could they share about pastoring? What’s the secret of pastoring at 90+?\n\nWill I be pastoring when I am 90 years old? Both my parents died at 83. My odds on hitting the 10th decade of my life aren’t good. I’m not going to lie, now that I am in my 60’s I have an eye on retirement (with both boys and more importantly our only grandson living in Kansas City, Karla has her eye on that grandbaby). One day (probably long before 90), I will retire, but I hope to never stop serving Jesus. I want to serve him until he calls me home. Should God Almighty call out, “who will pastor this church?” and I’m still kicking in my 90’s, like those six Nazarene pastoring heroes and Isaiah, I hope I will say, “Here I am send me” (Isaiah 6:8).\n\nUnder Pressure? Read this\n\nOn Tuesday I had a lumbar puncture where the doctor inserted a hollow needle into the space surrounding the spinal column in the lower back to withdraw some cerebrospinal fluid. The hope for this procedure was to lower the fluid pressure surrounding my head to below normal levels (without giving me a crazy spinal headache) and relieve my migraines. If this sounds like fun, you need your head examined (ha). It wasn’t fun, and I don’t think it worked. Which is mostly a big bummer.\n\nRelieving pressure in other areas of life can be difficult to overcome as well. Maybe more so. Students talk about the pressures in school. Thanks to social media these anxieties have substantially increased over when I was in high school and college. Often in the workplace there is pressure to perform, sell or increase productivity. Even within our homes there can be pressure brought on by money issues, trauma, grief, poor communication and so many other factors. There isn’t a needle that a doctor can inject to bring relief in any of these situations.\n\nIn 2 Corinthians, Paul talks about all the pressures the has endured. It’s a lot. Shipwrecks, beatings, starvation, hardships, many dangers and then he writes, “Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches” (2 Corinthians 11:28). He had a lot on his plate in other words. Still he concludes, “I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong” (2 Corinthians 12:10). It’s the same attitude that James encourages us to have when he writes, “Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds” (James 1:2).\n\nI’ve yet to counsel a person (or counsel myself for that matter) who is going through pressures and trials who “delight” in them as Paul tells or “considers them pure joy” like James. It’s tough. It stinks. We want to scream or escape or scream while we are escaping. Delight? Pure joy? Fat chance. When in the throes of such circumstances and troubles, is it possible to get to delighting or considering them joy?\n\nPaul and James aren’t saying the situations are easy. Don’t hear that. Trials by definition are “trying.” They try or patience. Try our endurance. Try our attitudes. They can even try our Christianity. The only way to “delight” and experience “pure joy” is to step back and take a bird’s eye (heaven’s eye) approach. See things as God does. Are you still living and breathing? Praise the Lord! Have you managed to keep your attitudes Christ-like thus far? Praise the Lord! Do your friends see you as an example of faithfulness in trials? Praise the Lord! Will a health care provider, fellow student, co-worker, family member or someone else come to Jesus because of your model? Really praise the Lord! Is Jesus, who endured far more than you, getting the glory for your situation? Praise. The. Lord!\n\nTrials aren’t fun. In my case, chronic pain stinks. But if someone, somewhere, somehow, in some way finds Jesus through it—then bring it on! I consider it pure joy! I will be delighting all the way to Glory with my new-in-faith friend!\n\nIf you want to read more about my Chronic Pain journey read this: https://www.amazon.com/Chronic-Pain-Finding-Midst-Suffering/dp/0834132257/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3B926J59O2SDN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.jocs3EQ9dvvvhGr1Is3mgg.Koms5WFgzLoxXnWgnwFCwKzrt4LIYt7cSlSGesuD3YA&dib_tag=se&keywords=rob+prince+chronic+pain&qid=1715856520&sprefix=rob+Prince+chronic+pain%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-1\n\nIf you want to read more about our journey with our cancer friend, read this: https://www.amazon.com/Got-Cancer-Theres-Help-Victory/dp/B0B7HBZYXL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ZYGRTITO87H7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ioQtZRdY_5o2j6CYF1D4hh71Lp011q3OHYeTgoPXfqPGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.6TEFSqW9eWUwz5qwkmFxdCTviUwcEbyI4BxeZ1DhSPY&dib_tag=se&keywords=rob+prince+got+cancer&qid=1715856570&sprefix=rob+prince+got+cancer%2Caps%2C185&sr=8-1\n\nWhat do Mosques, Buddhist temples and your church have in common?\n\nWe are living in post-Christian America. This is not news. More people mark “none” when asked about their religious preference than ever before. Knowledge of the Bible and acknowledgement of the need for Biblical truth is at an all-time low. People are no more interested in entering a church, as they or even a long time Christian might be interested in entering a mosque or Buddhist temple.\n\nFor argument sake, let’s say a mosque or Buddhist temple was being built on a corner that a fine Christian passes every day. They watch the building getting built. Maybe they even think to themself, “that’s a nice building.” Would they go to jumah (prayer service) in the mosque on a Friday or a gathering at the Buddhist temple? Probably not. What if there was a big sign out front that said “All are welcome” would the fine Christian go in? Probably not. More than likely, it doesn’t even cross the fine Christian’s mind to attend a meeting. They just drive on by.\n\nFor argument sake, let’s continue to think the fine Christian had a neighbor who is super nice. They’ve had cookouts together. The neighbors are always willing to lend a hand, a cup of sugar and they grab their mail when gone. They are the best neighbors. What if that guy comes to the fine Christian and says, “Hey, we are having a special service at the mosque or temple, I’d love it if you would come. Don’t worry about not understanding things, I will help you and explain everything. If you get uncomfortable at any time, we can leave. No worries. It’s a special day and I’d love to share it with my special friends.” Would the fine Christian go? There is a far more likelihood that they would go to the mosque or temple with the friendly neighbor under those circumstances. Even with no intention of converting, they will go because it was important to their friendly neighbor.\n\nNonbelievers in Post Christian America think about your church, the way you might think about a mosque or temple. It’s foreign to them. No matter how well kept the building. They aren’t coming in. No matter what is put on the electronic sign in the front of the church. They aren’t coming in. They don’t know the customs. They have questions: Can anyone just show up? Does one need to get permission to attend? They wouldn’t want to offend anyone. It’s foreign to them. As they drive pass your church, it doesn’t even cross their mind to attend a service. But if a trusted friend invites them to attend a church service, they just might come. If for no other reason than curiosity. They know their friend would be with them, answer any questions and would help them. A friend’s invite is what it will take to get Post Christian America population to come to church.\n\nBe that friend.\n\nInvite that neighbor.\n\nAllow God to do the rest.\n\nAlways be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15\n\nWhy I Choose to Stay Nazarene\n\nI was saved in a Nazarene church. Called to preach on a Nazarene campground. Sanctified while attending a Nazarene college. I graduated from a Nazarene college and the Nazarene seminary. The Church of the Nazarene is the church who ordained me. My first job with a real paycheck was at a Nazarene campground. Except for a brief time when I was working at a Presbyterian church while in seminary, every paycheck I have received from the age of 19 forward has been from a Nazarene institution (summer intern in college; worked at the library and in admissions while attending college; worked for the Nazarene Publishing House for two years in seminary; and of course pastoring in six different Nazarene churches). If not for the summer intern position, I would not have met my wife (she was transferred to the local airport for the summer, while I summer interned in the church). Both my sons and their wives are graduates of Nazarene universities. All of my siblings and their spouses are Nazarene institution grads. All their kids went to a Nazarene college too. I owe a lot to the Church of the Nazarene in other words. A. Very. Lot.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that I have blind loyalty. Like everyone with even a passing interest, I see the divides within the church. There are various factions within the church—on the far left, the far right and nutty folks somewhere in the middle. I have friends who’ve left on their own accord and others who were pushed out. I know very capable individuals who have been overlooked for leadership positions, while much less qualified people were pushed to the front. Politics, bad theology, nepotism, greed and pettiness have all infected the church at various times. As a global denomination, I see the challenges in keeping unity across international borders. During last year’s General Assembly, I heard gossip from the floor of the assembly and in social media posts and I saw first-hand its malicious undergirding. I see her faults in other words. The Church of the Nazarene isn’t perfect.\n\nStill I am a Nazarene. I love this church. I will work, pray and do all I can to help her. For me that means working in the local church. Doing all I can to enable this local outpost of the Church of the Nazarene to being a bright shining light in its community. In my opinion, it is.\n\nIf you are reading this, you probably know I write a lot. Some golf, I write. But you won’t read me bashing the church I love. You won’t see me hypercritical of decisions made (even decisions I completely disagree with). Why? I have a debt to her. I want to help her, not tear her down. There are ways to see positive change. Condemning or attacking on social media is not one of them. I love the church. I want her better. I want her to remain true to P.F. Bresee’s vision in the footsteps of William Greathouse and Mildred Wynkoop and so many others. I will work toward that end. I hope you stay and will join me.\n\nI want to live holiness. Working locally. Praying globally. Staying focused. Being positive. Promoting unity. Encouraging others. Loving people. Making disciples. I will be with her to my ending days when a Nazarene preacher prays the benediction at my funeral service.\n\nThe Church of the Nazarene is stuck with me. I choose to stay.\n\nNational Day of Prayer: Shut Up and Listen\n\nHave you ever been in a conversation with an overly-wordy-talker (OWT)? You know how those conversations unfold:\n\nOWT: Hey you, blah, blah, blah, and then I said blah, blah, blah, blah and oh yeah… blah, blah, blah and you know blah, blah, blah…\n\nYou: Hi…\n\nOWT: well, I think blah, blah, blah because he said blah, blah, blah also blah, blah, blah, blah blah and I meant to tell you blah, blah, blah…\n\nYou: That’s interesting, but…\n\nOWT: No, no blah, blah, blah have you heard blah, blah, blah, and don’t forget blah, blah, blah, blah blah, blah, and who knows blah, blah, blah. What do you think?\n\nYou: You could try…\n\nOWT: Of course, blah, blah, blah is better than blah, blah, blah and If you don’t mind blah, blah, blah, when you blah, blah, blah and then blah, blah, blah…\n\nYou: Excuse me, but…\n\nOWT: Oh, blah blah, blah really irritates me and blah blah, blah and did you hear blah, blah, blah and I’m going to scream blah, blah, blah…\n\nYou: Wait…\n\nOWT: Ok. Good talking to you. Bye\n\nYou: Bye (under your breath) Grumble. Grumble. Grumble.\n\nThat’s not a conversation. It’s a monologue. I wonder if that’s how God feels about our time in prayer with Him? Have you heard ourselves pray? Too often it goes something like this:\n\nUs: Dear God, blah, blah blah, and oh my God… blah, blah blah, and don’t forget blah, blah blah, blah, blah, blah, and if you don’t mind, blah, blah, blah, and one more thing… blah, blah blah, and ok two more things… blah, blah blah, and blah, blah, blah, blah and then there’s… blah blah, blah, blah and Aunt Martha’s gout…blah, blah, blah and please, please, please… blah, blah, blah and pretty please… blah and, blah, blah, blah… ummm… Amen.\n\nGod:\n\nOf course, I can’t speak for God. I don’t know how the Almighty responds to the too wordy, one sided monologues that we too often call prayer. I just know how I feel when a too-many-words-talker starts bending my ear. Ugh!\n\nToday is the National Day of Prayer. How about trying this… instead of thinking of it as the National-Day-to-Place-As-Many-Requests-to-the-Almighty-As-One-Possibly-Can Day, think of it as the National Listening-for-the-Almighty-to-Speak Day.\n\nPsalm 46:10 doesn’t say, “Blab on and on and know that I am God.” It says, “Be still and know that I am God.” Maybe we should do that on this day of prayer. Be still. Quiet. Listen. It’s being like Samuel when he took Eli’s advice in 1 Samuel 3:9 and simply prayed: “Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.”\n\nGod might be trying to say something to us, but can’t get a word in edgewise. We might be surprised at what the Lord might say if only we’d stop talking and started listening. Slow down. Quiet. Still.\n\nIn other words, (I write this in the nicest way that I can): Shut up and listen!\n\nA few simple Questions Concerning Heaven, Hell and Judgment Day\n\n1) Do you believe in heaven, hell and a coming Judgment Day?\n\n2) If you answered “no,” then might I suggest reading the Gospels. Jesus seemed to talk a lot about such things.\n\n3) If you answered “yes,” then (here’s a tough, in your face question) how much do you have to HATE someone to NOT TELL them about the either/or eternal accommodations for everyone who has ever lived?\n\nThe Bible is clear on the cost of our salvation. Peter put it this way: For you know that God paid a ransom to save you from the empty life you inherited from your ancestors. And it was not paid with mere gold or silver, which lose their value. It was the precious blood of Christ, the sinless, spotless Lamb of God. (1 Peter 1:18-19. NLT).\n\n“Jesus paid it all,” we sing. What about us? What is our investment in others? In assessing our efforts to see people come to Christ, are we going “all out”? Do we give a maximum effort to see that the people we love have a relationship with Jesus too? If not, why not? If we believe people will face judgment and then spend eternity without Christ, shouldn’t we walk over broken glass if needed to see these folks spend eternity with Jesus?\n\nI’m not suggesting that we bully, guilt, scare, annoy or manipulate people to make a decision for Christ. No knocking people on the head with our big King James Bibles. I am suggesting that we take our call to make disciples much more serious than it seems that we do. Have you prayed for people who don’t know Jesus today? Have you fasted on their behalf? Have you thought through conversations you might have with them concerning their eternal accommodations? Have you asked the Lord to give you wisdom, the right words and to open the doors when the time is absolutely right? Are you prepared to walk through those open doors?\n\nIf one believes in a real heaven, a real hell and a coming Judgment Day in which all will stand before a holy God, then giving maximum evangelistic effort seems like the only appropriate response.\n\nWhat could possibly be more important?\n\nIf the Church had an NFL-Style Draft\n\nThe NFL Draft is happening in Detroit today. Thousands of football fans have descended upon the city waiting to see what college football player is picked by their favorite professional team. The Chicago Bears with the first pick are predicted to choose a quarterback from the University of Southern California. Following the Bear’s choice, the Washington Commanders will have 10 minutes to make their choice. They will be “on the clock.” The Detroit Lions fans have to wait until the 29th pick to be “on the clock” in the draft (unless they trade up to select a player earlier) to see who will be wearing Honolulu Blue and Silver in the fall.\n\nTeams have been examining their own shortcomings; evaluating talent; and trying to predict what type of player is needed to achieve their goal of winning the Super Bowl. They are all looking for the next superstar and those hidden gems in the later rounds. Some teams find them. Others don’t (for many, many years the Lions did not choose wisely, but those days are over! That noise you are hearing is all the Lions’ fans roaring their approval of the previous parenthetical sentence).\n\nAll this draft talk got me thinking of who the church might pick if it had opportunity to draft church members. What skills and qualities are needed to be considered a #1 draft pick in the church? If one evaluated a church’s weaknesses would it be determine a better preacher is needed? The fastest soul winner? A sound Bible student/teacher? A savvy tech team member with a good ear for sound? A pied-piper-like youth worker? The ultimate kitchen volunteer or the best multi-tasking nursery worker?\n\nThe church isn’t like a football team. It doesn’t need a superstar in one area. The church needs people willing to serve with little regard for recognition. People who discover their gifts, then use them for the glory of God (not their own glory). The church needs people who love like Jesus more than simply being able to run fast or throw a ball far.\n\nThe goal of any church is not being the sole team that wins at the season finale. Instead, the goal is to get as many souls into glory at eternity’s grand finale (Notice the word play: sole vs. souls). Unlike Detroit football fans, our celebration will not be for on-field accomplishment of the Lions, but rather we will glory at the on-earth accomplishment of the Lamb! (Notice the word play: Lions vs. The Lamb). All this to say, the church isn’t looking to draft a few players; it should welcome all people whether they can throw a football or not.\n\nThe draft strategy according to that old football coach, the Apostle Paul (Ok, Paul never played football. If he had played in the NFL he undoubtedly would have been on the New Orleans Saints) is this: God has given us the task of telling everyone what he is doing. We’re Christ’s representatives. God uses us to persuade men and women to drop their differences and enter into God’s work of making things right between them (2 Corinthians 5:19-20a The Message. Underlining mine). Let’s do that—tell everyone, men and women—what God is up to and be the best representatives of the King of Kings that we can possibly be!\n\nChurch, you are “on the clock.”\n\nBe a Carrier Pigeon, not just a Sponge\n\nDiscipleship in many churches means a classroom; a teacher; and a Bible in everyone’s hand. It’s learning the nuances of scripture. Some folks have been in a Sunday School class or a home group for years. Years and years. They have studied scripture inside and out. They know their Bibles.\n\nBut is that discipleship’s end goal? Make Bible scholars? Please note: This isn’t an anti-Bible slant. The Bible is the inspirited word of God. People need to read it, know it, preach it. Still the goal of the church isn’t to make Bible scholars but to make disciples who will, in turn, make more disciples.\n\nThe Great Commission does not read:\n\nTherefore go and study the Bible, soak it all in, understand all the theological nuances of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,and then TEACH. TEACH, TEACH, and continue to TEACH folks to learn everything I have commanded you.\n\nAs we have emphasized teaching and learning, we have created churches full of sponges. They soak up all the theological truths that they possibly can. They are ready to argue and debate any Biblical topic. They have read 1 Peter 3:15: Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. They are ready to give an answer.\n\nThe problem is that these Bible students are rarely asked “to give an answer.” All their friends are fellow believers sitting beside them in the same Bible study. They only hang around Christians. So who are they discipling? Do they know even how to make a disciple? (Reminder: That’s what the Great Commission call us to do).\n\nWe need carrier pigeons not just sponges. We need those who will take the message of Jesus far and wide. (Here’s where my metaphor falls apart). Then we need those carrier pigeons (disciple-ers) to make more carrier pigeons (disciple-ers). Those brand new carrier pigeons will likewise take the message out too. It’s creating a culture where the message receiver (discipled) then becomes a message distributer (disciple-er). It’s disciples making disciples making disciples making disciples.\n\nOf course, we need to know the Bible in order to be a disciple maker. But the goal, the end game, is to make disciples, not simply Bible scholars. Our prayer should be that of Paul’s in Colossians 4: Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should. (Colossians 4:4). We are to be proclaimers of the Good News of Jesus Christ.\n\nSponges just soak up information and stay put.\n\nCarrier pigeons deliver the news.\n\nBe a carrier pigeon.\n\nIs JB Chapman Rolling Over in His Grave?\n\nThe 2024 Eastern Michigan District Assembly Journal had been distributed. The reports aren’t great.\n\n30% of churches on the district reported no conversions this year. Zero.\n\n46% of the churches reported no baptisms. Zippo.\n\n50% reported no New Nazarenes. Nadda.\n\nIf a body had no pulse (no conversions); no blood pressure (no baptisms); and no brain activity (no new Nazarenes), we would conclude that the body is dead or at least dying.\n\nHey Lenexa, call hospice. The Church of the Nazarene is in trouble.\n\nCall the weed control company, the grassroots of the Church of the Nazarene are in the briar patch.\n\nCall the WWE scriptwriters, the Church is on its back, and the referee is about to slap the mat for a third time.\n\nPick any “We’re-in-trouble” metaphor and that is us.\n\nAt least our cemetery has company, the Southern Baptists just reported that 43% of their churches reported no baptisms. You can read it here. Whoopie, we are not alone.\n\nBlame the culture. Blame past church abuse. Blame politics. Blame Covid. Blame whatever you want, the truth of the matter is that churches (no matter the brand) in America are not fulfilling the Great Commission (see Matthew 28:19-20). We aren’t making disciples (30% no conversions); we aren’t baptizing (46% no baptisms); we aren’t teaching (50% no new Nazarenes).\n\nSo what are we doing? Why do we exist if we aren’t fulfilling what Jesus called us to do?\n\nIn 1946, JB Chapman was disheartened by the state of the Church of the Nazarene and published a little booklet titled, “All out for Souls.” You can read it here. In it he wrote:\n\n“Brethren, I was born in the fire, and I cannot endure the smoke. I am a child of the bright daylight, and mists and fogs and depressing gloom are not to my liking. I want to go all out for souls…\n\n“I want a revival that, like a summer shower, will purify the atmosphere of our churches everywhere, and which will awake the dormant forces of our people young and old. I want something so general and so divine that it will be uncontrollable. I want something that will reemphasize old-time moral and spiritual conditions…\n\n“Something that will make this namby-pamby, soft-handed, compromising, cringing sort of holiness as obsolete as Phariseeism was on the Day of Pentecost.”\n\nIf JB Chapman was saying that in 1946, what would he say if he were looking over the sorry state of many of today’s churches? Once again we must “go all out for souls!” Once more we need to be revived. If not now, then when? We can’t look at the reality and be unmoved. We must do something. Anything. It takes going all out for souls once more.\n\nAnd He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”\n\nSo I answered, “O Lord God, You know.”\n\nAgain He said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, ‘O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord! Thus says the Lord God to these bones: “Surely I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live. Ezekiel 37:3-5\n\nThe Solar Eclipse is God’s Handiwork– and That’s Not All\n\nMillions and millions of people will be looking up in the sky today (hopefully with protective lenses on). All in an effort to see a total eclipse of the sun. Depending on the location, some spots will see the moon fully cover the sun for up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds. The best watching time for Central Church is 3:14PM. The sun will be 95% covered. The next total solar eclipse from coast-to-coast across the continental U.S. in will occur in 2045. So it makes sense that folks would want to look up and see it. It will be 21 years before another eclipse occurs throughout the USA again.\n\nBut do we really need to wait 21 years before we see the handiwork* of God again? Not even close. We can see the handiwork of God in many areas and we don’t need protective lenses to see it. We are in Eastertide, and we celebrate the fact that Jesus is alive. As such, Jesus is enabling His people to do the work of God Almighty in the world through the power of the Holy Spirit. It’s more than talk. It’s happening. Look at all the good, Christ-followers are doing in the world. There are hospitals, orphanages and counselling centers. There are compassionate ministry centers, schools and, of course, churches. Every day ordinary Christians are doing extraordinary things in the name of Jesus Christ. God’s handiwork is all around!\n\nYes, today we see Creator’s handiwork in the skies, but every day we can see God’s handiwork if we just open our eyes and see it.\n\n*FYI… some social media posts notwithstanding, I do not believe that solar eclipses nor the recent earthquakes in New York are indicators of the second coming of Jesus. His return is not precipitated by events in the United States. These events have been taking place as long as there has been a planet earth. Jesus will return when the perfect time has come. We are one day closer to His coming than yesterday, that is all I know for sure.\n\nEaster is Over. Now what? (For pastors and other concerned church members)\n\nYesterday was the church’s Super Bowl. “He is risen” was proclaimed. The building was full. Everyone was excited. “He is risen, deed” was the shouted response. Today, the church is quiet. It sits empty. The Easter lilies are wilting. There are a few unfound plastic colored eggs in the courtyard. Some unread bulletins are in the pews and scattered about.\n\nNow what?\n\nRest today if need be, then get to work. Preparing Holy Week services was not the “hard part.” The hard part is getting visitors and the occasional attender to return. That’s the goal. Priority #1.\n\nContact any new guests that left their information. If they left a phone number, text them. If they left an email address, send a message. If they left a home address, send a personal note (not a form letter). If all they left was a name, Facebook stalk them and send them a private message. If they have children, have a children’s worker invite the child to an upcoming children’s event. Same goes, if there was a teenager present. If they left nothing at all, no name, no address, nothing– remember their face and pray for them. Let God do the rest.\n\nKeep the message short. Thank them for coming and invite them back. Simple. If you personally talked to them, refer back to that conversation. If they came with a family member or friend, mention how glad you were that person invited them to the service. Make any connection that you can. Pray they return.\n\nRemember their names. Write them down or put it in your notes section on your phone. Pray for them daily. Be on the lookout. If they return this week or next, greet them by name. Ask about their family. Thank them for returning. Again, let the Holy Spirit do the rest.\n\nYour church need not be modern, cool, exceptional or in away similar to a megachurch. The music doesn’t have to be loud. There need not be special lighting and smoke. The sermon doesn’t have to be better than Billy Graham’s. You church may have none of those things. Let it be warm, inviting, caring, welcoming, interested in others, hospitable, biblical, missional, loving, and kind– that is Christ-like—and people will return. People still are looking for a place where they can encounter Jesus, feel a sense of belonging and be loved. Let that be your church.\n\nEaster is over. Let the work of the Kingdom begin!\n\nIs the Church of the Nazarene the next Blockbuster?\n\nBlockbuster and mom and pop video stores, once in every town, are now gone. Seeming overnight our viewing habits changed and today the buildings have been repurposed or sitting empty. Blockbuster couldn’t compete with new technologies and quickly became obsolete.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the Church of the Nazarene? You can probably guess. Is your church like Blockbuster? Some are predicting that in the next twenty years, 100,000 churches in America will close their doors. How many of that 100,000 will be Nazarene churches? (You can read about the church emptying phenomenon here).\n\nUnlike Blockbuster, not all the churches will close. There will still be a lot of churches in twenty years. The questions for the Church of the Nazarene are:\n\nWhat will the USA Church of the Nazarene look like if 25% of the churches close?\n\nWhat will happen to the global church which relies on the USA churches’ investment in the World Evangelism Fund (95% of WEF comes from USA/Canada)?\n\nHow might the Church of the Nazarene repurpose buildings or utilize the funds from closed churches?\n\nMore personal, will your church be one of those that closes its doors forever?\n\nIt’s an easy math equation. Look at everyone in your congregation, add twenty years to the ages of the folks sitting in the pews and if nothing changes you can draw your conclusion.\n\n“If nothing changes… “ What needs to change? Clearly, the Church of the Nazarene needs young people coming through the doors. What will it take to get younger people? These ingredients:\n\n1) Young people like Jesus. Preach Jesus.\n\n2) Young people don’t need flashy. They need authentic. Young people can spot a phony a mile away. Be real.\n\n3) Young people need to know you love them. Love without exception.\n\n4) Young People need ownership. Don’t be afraid to give young people key roles and leadership. Listen to them. Help them. Teach them.\n\n5) Young People aren’t perfect (neither are you). Don’t expect perfection. Leave room for errors, mistakes and outright failure. Keep trying. Don’t stop trying.\n\n6) Young People want their communities to flourish. Be the best neighbor.\n\nI recently heard of a young alcoholic who had a Nazarene upbringing and went to a Nazarene college, then walked away from faith. Finally the prodigal made the good, hard decision to enter rehab. The Christian employers responded by telling this struggling addict not to worry about a job. It would be there after rehab. There were bigger matters at hand. “Get better” was the message from the owners (Way to go!). Blown away, the on-the-way-back-to-faith addict was grateful for their love and response. Their reaction spoke more volumes than a thousand sermons. The business owners were acting like Jesus. That’s our hope in a nut shell.\n\nHave a church full of people who love, sacrifice, and are committed to Jesus – and one need not worry about shuttering the doors. The life-changing message of Jesus is still compelling!\n\nMiracle Needed: The Resurrection of the Church of the Nazarene in USA/Canada\n\nThe Resurrection of Jesus is the single most remarkable event in human history. We celebrate this remarkable Day in a little more than a week. The beating and humiliation of Jesus following an unjust system of justice has been done to others in the dark annals of human history. The same can be said about the crucifixion. While inhumane and horrific, others have endured similar deaths. But no one returned to life three days later. No one. It is the rock on which our faith rests. The miracle of all miracles.\n\nThis is meant in no way to lower the importance or the power of the Resurrection of Jesus, but the church of Jesus Christ (or more specific to my situation, the Church of the Nazarene) in the United States needs a resurrection too. The church isn’t dead. So maybe it is too early to be calling for a resurrection. But the church is in trouble. In many corners it is on life support. We need another miracle of miracles.\n\nExperts are predicting the closing of 100,000 churches in the United States over the next 20 years. That number is approximately 25% of the churches in America. It is already is happening in the Church of the Nazarene. Less than 10 years ago there were 5247 Nazarene churches in USA/Canada. This past year the reported number of churches was 4417. What will there be in 10 years? 3,000? 2500?\n\nThe questions can be asked: Are North American Christians too soft? Are we too busy? Are we too political? Are we too rich? Are we too divided? Have we traded our first love? Have we forgotten the hurting, the broken, and the “least of these”? Are we no longer embodying the holiness we profess? Are we mere shadows of the saints of past generations who sacrificed for the advancement of the Gospel of Jesus Christ? Is our culture so strong and our faith so weak that we can’t overcome?\n\nI cannot fully answer those questions. I have my suspicions. I don’t like some of my conclusions. What I do know is this: We need a miracle. We need the Spirit of God to sweep in. It’s time to beg, plead, confess, and cry out like prophets of old. If not now, when? We need to be resurrected. The Psalmist question and plea should be ours: Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?Show us your unfailing love, Lord, and grant us your salvation. Psalm 85:6-7\n\nStart it in me, O Lord. Start it in me.\n\nIf your Religion (Preaching) is Dry as Dust, Don’t Be Surprised if People Blow You Off\n\n“Only a dry as dust religion prompts a minister to extol the glories of heaven while ignoring the social conditions that cause people an earthly hell” – Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. said nothing more profound and critical of the church/pastors than the above quote. In hindsight, one could have applied his words to the church leaders in Nazi Germany as Hitler was coming into power. They were applied to silent preachers in America during the Jim Crow era. They are applicable in today’s global crisis locations of Haiti, Ukraine and Gaza. They are even pertinent in our all-too-often posture toward those struggling with identity and mental health issues or gun violence or abortion on demand and the reasons women think this is their only option or poverty or the drug epidemic or the many other social ills in the United States today. The result of the deafening silence is a dry as dust religion.\n\nI love thinking about heaven. I am planning on being there one day. But it’s probably not going to be today. Conversely, what is happening today is a world where many are living in hellish conditions. When I think, “What would Jesus do about this?” I am not always sure what He would do. It’s complicated. But I’m pretty sure He would not be silent.\n\nLuke’s account of when the religious leaders complained to the disciples about Jesus in Luke 5, seems eerily similar to the religious side-stepping, wind-bagging and blind-eyeing of today’s problems:\n\nThe Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” Luke 5:31-32\n\nNotice the religions leaders question was directed to the disciples, but it was Jesus who answered them. He wasn’t silent. In effect He was saying, “I’m the doctor. I’m the cure. Where would you expect me to be?”\n\nWhere are the sick today? They are in Haiti, in Ukraine, in Gaza and in so many underreported areas that we never hear about. Where would we expect the Great Physician to be?\n\nSo go ahead dry as dust preachers, keep talking about heaven. You might get there one day, but in the meantime, start praying like Jesus taught us to pray for God’s kingdom to come and will to be done on earth as it is in heaven. I’m pretty sure that means praying and working for a place without violence (Isaiah writes, “They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.” Isaiah 2:4), without hunger (heaven is described as a banquet), and no poverty (the streets are made of gold, right?). “On earth as it is in Heaven.” Preach that. Work for that. (Full Disclosure Alert: It’s not “either/or” proposition– either talk about heaven or work for heaven on earth. You can and probably will do both).\n\nStill one reason (there are many reasons) why the “nones” are out pacing Christians in USA/Canada census numbers is the perception that the church has been “dry as dust” promising heaven yet offering little help to our dying world. If your religion is dry as dust, don’t be surprised when people blow you off.\n\nWe’ve got to change the narrative. Flip the story. Go back to being the hands and feet of Jesus. Less positioning for power. More Jesus. Less Politics. More Jesus. Less name calling. More Jesus. Less head-in-the-sand. More open-eyed-reality-check. Less side-stepping, wind-bagging and blind-eyeing of today’s problems. More, more, more Jesus. Less talk of going up to heaven. More praying for heaven to come down to earth.\n\nWhy Nazarenes should be in Prayer for Haiti\n\nAs you may have seen in the news, the nation of Haiti is in utter turmoil. The Prime Minister, Ariel Henry, has agreed to step down and gangs rule much of its capital of Port-au-Prince. These gangs have attacked the main prison to help thousands of inmates escape. The head of the UN’s World Food Program in Haiti, Jean-Martin Bauer, said on Monday that more than 360,000 people had now been displaced. The situation is dire. You can read a recent description here.\n\nYou may also recall, Haiti has endured numerous difficulties in the last 20 years. The country underwent a 2004 coup d’état, a catastrophic earthquake in 2010 killed over 250,000 people, and their last prime minister was assassinated 2021. The murders have not been apprehended. Haiti suffers from a shortage of skilled labor, widespread unemployment, and underemployment. Most Haitians in the labor force have informal jobs. Three-quarters of the population lives on US$2 or less per day. Haiti in the most populous Caribbean country, but also the poorest. There is widespread hunger.\n\nBesides the obvious humanitarian crisis and suffering, why should Nazarenes be extra concerned and more diligent in our prayers? Simple– Haiti has more Nazarene’s per capita than any other nation on earth. There are more Nazarene churches and higher church membership in Haiti than any one of the USA regions.* The nation is the size of Maryland and has 755 churches (Maryland has 64). In fact, Haiti has more Nazarene churches than the COMBINED total of one third of the 165 countries that the Church of the Nazarene is registered in including Canada, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand.**\n\nHaiti’s difficulties are vast and complex. There is not an easy remedy. A recent article in Ministry Watch outlines the evangelical response here. Good hearted, Christian short-term missions from the USA may have hurt more than helped and new strategies should be examined and employed.*** Still Haiti is half the distance from Key West (720 miles) as is New York City (1434 miles). It’s on the USA/Canada doorstep. Nazarenes in USA/Canada cannot imagine the suffering our Nazarene brothers and sisters are enduring.\n\nHelp begins with vision and prayer. Familiarize yourself with the issues in Haiti and pray informatively on how Nazarenes from around the globe might offer a creative and godly response to the suffering. Pray for the Field Strategy Coordinator, Rev. Pierre Antoine and Emmanise Jacques and the 12 districts in Haiti. Pray for the 755 churches and the Haiti Nazarene Theological Seminary. But especially pray for the 147,182 members and fellowship Nazarene members (and all the attendees who are not members)—our brothers and sisters who are in grave danger, fighting malnutrition with a very uncertain future.\n\nHaitian Nazarenes are in trouble. They need us. They need our prayer. Take time when you gather to lift up our brother and sisters and consider an offering through NCM as they strategize the best steps forward.\n\n*Haiti has 755 churches.
