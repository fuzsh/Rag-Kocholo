        "text": "Ricky Warwick, once and future frontman for THE ALMIGHTY, has issued the following update on his solo activities at his official website:\n\n\"So, it’s been a while. Life is crazy but isn’t that what makes it so damn interesting, or so they say. I have never really been one to bitch or moan about stuff personal or business, preferring just to get on with dealing with it in private with the help of my family and loved ones. I like to keep my private life fairly private and anyway what makes my problems any better or worse than the next guy’s ………right.\n\nI had been thinking about relocating to the USA for a while and at the end of last year my mind was speeded and made up for me when I fell in love. So at the start of this year I relocated to sunny Los Angeles (although it rained solidly for the first month). It was sad to leave Ireland but I am and always will be fiercely proud of my Northern Irish roots. But I had to go as there was a lot of shit going on and I wanted a clean break. So I put my house up for sale in Dublin and informed Uncle Sam I was coming to stay.\n\nAt the tail end of 2004 I entered the studio in Dublin with my good buddies Joe Elliott and Ronan McHugh (the guy’s behind my first solo album). I had believed I had written a very strong bunch of songs. I had been writing constantly since the release of Tattoos and Alibis, I had been to Nashville and worked with some of the great songwriters there. I had also worked with my good buddy Irish singer/songwriter Kieran Goss on a lot of songs, writing up at his home in County Sligo is a real trip, some of the most beautiful countryside Ireland has to offer. Talking of which, I had also travelled to my hometown of Newtownards in County Down on many occasions where I get my best ideas and get my head together. I love travelling and I have always tried to write from experience and to do that you got to get out there and live, good and bad.\n\nLove Many Trust Few is the most difficult album I have ever had to make. There was so much turmoil going on around me at the time I was pretty much stressed out constantly, most of this may I add was my own doing due to the necessary changes I was making in my life. I also learned that halfway through making the record my album advance was being cut (not of my own doing) hardly very inspiring, as albums are not cheap to make. But what else can you do but forge ahead and stop eating out at that expensive French restaurant (yeah…in my dreams).\n\nMy thanks go to Joe and Ronan for putting up with my craziness and helping me make what I believe is a damn fine record, one that I am very proud of. Sometimes a little turmoil and craziness can be a good thing when you are creating - but you guys can be the judge of that!!!\n\nLady Luck is a very strange thing, the first couple of months of this year it seemed like she was out to get me. Tours that I was trying to get on slipped away at the last moment, two key people at my publishing company left and Sanctuary seemed to want to give me very little support for my new album.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong, I have been involved in making music and making a living at it for nearly 20 years now. I know how bullshit the industry can be as I have dealt with a lot of labels over the years. I love playing, writing and touring and will continue to do so. It’s in my blood. I wouldn’t know what else to do. I tried quitting music about five years ago… I lasted a week.\n\nThere are some great people at Sanctuary who try they’re best to help and understand what I do and there are some people who don’t. You could say the same of any record label. I am grateful that they took a chance on my solo albums and I will continue to work as best I can Love Many Trust Few here on Sanctuary in North America. With that being said, Love Many Trust Few will not be released on Sanctuary Records in the rest of the world.\n\nLove Many Trust Few will be released in October in the UK and Ireland on Townsend Records (distributed by Universal), a very cool independent label who work their socks off for their artists. You will be able to pre-order it first exclusively on this website before it is available in stores. Love Many Trust Few is also being released on October 1st in the rest of Europe and South America on Sleaszy Rider Records (distributed by EMI). Again, a great independent label I am looking forward to working with. Additionally, I am very close to finalising a licensing deal for Japan and will have news of the release date very soon.\n\nI’m thrilled that at last Love Many Trust Few will be released in the rest of the world. It would have been great to have it come out worldwide on May 17th instead of just North America only, but as you can see certain issues had to be dealt with. I will be setting up shows, so keep checking the site for dates.\n\nI have settled into Southern California very well and I enjoy life here very much. The future as always, is as positive as you want to make it. I am also involved in a new project, one that musically I am finding very exciting indeed and I will make a full announcement about it very soon.\n\nAnyway that’s enough of me rattling on. For those of you who have bought Love Many Trust Few - thank you. I hope you are digging it. For those of you who have been patiently waiting for its release in the rest of the world, thank you for your patience and I hope when you hear it, the wait was worth it.\n\nI have been accused of many things over the years. The one thing that I am definitely guilty of - is always following my heart.\"\n\nPeace,\n\nRicky Warwick.\n\nAs previously reported, The Almighty will reunite in January for two shows to raise money for leukemia research. To read Warwick's statement on the brief reunion go here.\n\nThe dates are as follows:\n\nJanuary\n\n5 at Garage in Glasgow, Scotland\n\n6 at Mean Fiddler in London, England"
