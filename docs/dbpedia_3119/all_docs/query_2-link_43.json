        "text": "AIMS Marketing Program/ Featured Titles Promoted This Week:\n\nCable Ties – All Her Plans CD/LP+MP3 (Merge)\n\nAll Her Plans, the third album from Melbourne, Australia’s Cable Ties, finds the trio of Jenny McKechnie, Shauna Boyle, and Nick Brown at their punchiest and most assured. The ferocious, kraut-influenced blend of post-punk and garage rock of Merge debut Far Enough remains, but McKechnie’s lyrics invite the listener closer than ever before. The urgency and fury that have marked Cable Ties’ output thus far is more nuanced on All Her Plans. The unfettered rage of their calls to action endures-tackling subjects like broken mental healthcare systems and the burden of familial care that is largely placed on women-while holding space for gratitude, love, and acceptance. [An indie store exclusive blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nEric Clapton – The Definitive 24 Nights 6xCD+3xBlu-ray/8xLP+3xBlur-ray (Reprise)\n\nEric Clapton – 24 Nights: Blues 2xCD+DVD/2xLP (Reprise)\n\nEric Clapton – 24 Nights: Rock 2xCD+DVD/3xLP (Reprise)\n\nEric Clapton – 24 Nights: Orchestral 2xCD+DVD/3xLP (Reprise)\n\nIn 1990 and 1991, Eric Clapton performed 42 nights at the Royal Albert Hall in London; 18 shows in 1990 and 24 in 1991. During the run of these shows Clapton performed with three different line-ups: a rock band, a blues band, and an orchestra. The huge undertaking of rehearsing for performances of three distinctly different genres and set lists was made more challenging by the rock show line-ups varying from 4, 9 or 13 band members. Guest musicians included Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Robert Cray, and Phil Collins. The orchestra was conducted by the late Michael Kamen. Many of the performances were filmed and recorded and the huge amount of audio and film material has been painstakingly restored and the quality upgraded. The rock, blues and orchestral shows are now available as stand-alone concerts on LP and CD. The CD formats also come with the film of the show on DVD. Additionally, the limited-edition The Definitive 24 Nights deluxe box sets include 47 songs and almost 6 hours of music on 6 CDs or 8 LPs and 3 Blu-ray’s.\n\nKelly Clarkson – Chemistry CD/LP (Atlantic)\n\nGrammy-winning global superstar Kelly Clarkson ushers in her highly anticipated tenth studio album Chemistry with the double singles “Mine” and “Me”. The pair of songs perfectly compliment and contrast, showcasing the lyrical complexity featured on the project three years in the making. Soaring vocals and a mounting instrumental find Clarkson lyrically honest-as-ever on “Mine”, chanting “go ahead and break my heart, that’s fine” before craving karmic retribution. Meanwhile the focus shifts inward on “Me”, a triumphant anthem of self-empowerment co-written with Grammy-nominated rising star Gayle. Culminating with the lyric “don’t need to need somebody when I’ve got me,” the song’s message proves equally intimate and universal. “We decided to release ‘Mine’ and ‘Me’ at the same time because I didn’t want to release just one song to represent an entire album, or relationship,” Clarkson says. “There are many stages of grief and loss on this album. Each song is a different stage and emotional state.” [A limited-edition coke bottle green color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nGeese – 3D Country CD/LP (Partisan/PIAS)\n\nIn the summer of 2021, Geese emerged from out of nowhere, sparking a hype cycle unlike anything that had been seen for a young American rock band in recent memory. Suddenly a band that had previously planned to release some music, break up, and go away to college was touring the world. And during this entire process, that very same band everyone was getting to know ceased to exist. On a practical level, Geese are still the group we were introduced to in 2021. But spiritually, Geese have returned as an entirely different prospect. Their new album 3D Country is the sound of a restless, adventurous band redefining themselves. Anyone who has seen Geese live recently might’ve noticed the band adopted a different vibe onstage – more of a volcanic, unpredictable aesthetic. It turns out that wasn’t a flipside to the recordings of Projector but foreshadowing that there was more to the story. Knowing they were now beyond teenage basement experiments and were instead making something for an audience who would hear it, Geese felt emboldened. “Maybe the last record was our teenage angst and 3D Country is our newfound 20-something arrogance,” Geese’s Gus Greene quips. [A limited-edition clear vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nAlbert Hammond Jr. – Melodies On Hiatus CD/LP (Red Bull)\n\nStrokes guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. crafted his fifth solo album Melodies On Hiatus in a most experimental style. Albert teamed up with his writing partner, Canadian songwriter, and poet Simon Wilcox (whom he never met during the process) and had lengthy conversations via the telephone; Simon would jot down notes from Albert’s stream of consciousness, and draft the lyrics on her typewriter, and drop them into his letterbox. Albert then added the lyrics to the melodies he had already crafted. The songwriting process became a long distant “anonymous love affair of ideas & lyrics.” The 19-track collection covers themes of childhood, surviving adolescence, adulthood, vulnerability, fame, relationship with self and others, and is Albert’s “deconstructed broken down ego reaction” to 2018’s Francis Trouble. [Two limited-edition vinyl colorways are available: indie store exclusive orange w/ black splatter and limited-edition yellow w/ green and black.]\n\nMilitarie Gun – Life Under The Gun CD/LP (Loma Vista)\n\nLos Angeles-based rockers Militarie Gun is a truly uncategorizable band. Led by vocalist Ian Shelton, the band’s debut full-length, Life Under The Gun, is forged by a lifetime of experience and effort, offering 12 tracks that manage to blend the unbridled aggression of hardcore with massive hooks and personality to spare. The new collection is introduced by the promising singles “Do It Faster” and “Very High”. [A limited-edition translucent blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nJason Mraz – Mystical Magical Rhythmical Radical Ride CD/LP (BMG)\n\nJason Mraz is living in full spiral. It’s not full circle, exactly, because he’s changed and his experiences have changed, but on his eighth studio album, Mystical Magical Rhythmical Radical Ride, the musician has found himself returning to a familiar junction in space. Throughout the album, there are hints of Mraz’s formative releases, including his 2002 debut Waiting For My Rocket To Come and 2005’s Mr. A-Z, but it ultimately finds a kinship with 2008’s We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things. The new songs, which are unabashedly pop, see Mraz reuniting with numerous collaborators, including L.A. band Raining Jane and producer Martin Terefe, who helmed the 2008 breakout album. The songs grapple with the emotions and experiences that come with being in your midlife, a time that is often ignored by pop songwriters. Its optimistic, inspiring sensibility reflects the musician’s overall approach to being in the world. It is, in fact, a full spiral, reflecting the past but becoming something new. [An indie store exclusive blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nBobbie Nelson and Amanda Shires – Loving You CD/LP+MP3 (ATO)\n\nBobbie Nelson’s musical career dates to the 1940s. Naturally gifted on the piano, she played in churches, revival tents, concert halls and honky-tonks, eventually joining her brother Willie Nelson’s Family Band in the early ‘70s. “Loving You ‘is a reflection on the life and music of Bobbie Nelson,” says Grammy-winning singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Amanda Shires. Shires’ mission in making Loving You is to pay respect to the only woman she saw working in a band and pursuing a career as a sideman. “I first saw Bobbie playing when I was 16 at some festival in Texas where I grew up,” she explains. “Much of my path seemed possible because I saw a woman working and making a career of music at a young age, and that woman was Bobbie Nelson.” Loving You features songs Nelson and Shires played and treasured their entire lives – a few of Nelson’s favorites along with her own elegant solo piano title cut. The album would eventually trace Nelson’s musical story – and personal journey. [A limited-edition white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nPortugal. The Man – Chris Black Changed My Life CD/LP (Atlantic)\n\nPortuga.l The Man is back after a brief hiatus with the new record Chris Black Changed My Life, the follow up to their global hit Woodstock. PTM have set a personal standard to “change things up” each time they go into the studio to record a new album. This time they enlisted famed producer Jeff Bhasker (Harry Styles, Kanye West, Beyonce, Mark Ronson) to challenge their process. The result of the collaboration brought a new depth to the music and a record that is in lead singer/songwriter John Gourley’s own words “our most complete record that follows a story line from beginning to end”. The record delivers on PTM’s eclectic-ness, pulling influence from music across the globe. Chris Black Changed My Life is a personal story about the loss of a friend and the struggle that comes with it and ultimately ends with the power and endless influence those people will have on your life.\n\nTommy Prine – This Far South CD/LP (Thirty Tigers)\n\nTommy Prine’s 2023 debut album, This Far South, is not only a long-awaited introduction but a testimony to Prine’s 20’s and the loss, love, and growth that has defined them. Co-produced by close friend and kindred musical spirit, Ruston Kelly, and beloved Nashville engineer and producer, Gena Johnson, the album is rich and dynamic from cathartic jams to nostalgic storytelling.\n\nVintage Trouble – Heavy Hymnal CD/LP (Cooking Vinyl Limited)\n\nHistory has proven that when the world is in flames, it ignites empathetic artists to siren their words, music, and rhythm, to blanket our society’s fury and nurse scorched souls. The seemingly endless years of pandemic lockdown and social distancing, coupled with the turbulent plague of civil unrest and racial injustice, called on Vintage Trouble to step into their battle wear. Like so often before, they have spun records to drop onto the fighting grounds, with the intent to freeze the frame long enough to momentarily halt the warring world. And while at ease, we can freely choose to think before we strike or decide to retreat, rather than thoughtlessly charge into repeating history. A collection of heavy hymns, Heavy Hymnal is from the heart, and it provides a necessary rise to our ever reckoning. [A limited-edition indie store exclusive white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nWard – Supernatural Thing CD/LP+MP3 (ANTI-)\n\nSinger/songwriter M. Ward returns with the new studio album Supernatural Thing. His songs “luxuriate in a dream world conjured out of memories, shared stories, and flights of fancy,” Pitchfork says, and the album’s title track also lives in a liminal space in which Elvis comes to him with a message: You Can Go Anywhere You Please. “Well, all my songs depend on dream-imagery to some extent,” Ward explained, “and this was an actual dream I had about Elvis, when he came to me and said that. I don’t know if it’s pandemic-related or not.” Summing up the emotional tone of the record, Ward also sings on this track: “you feel the line is growing thin / between beautiful and strange.” The album’s guest stars – First Aid Kit, Shovels & Rope, Scott McMicken, Neko Case, Jim James, and others – enliven the album with surprises. [An indie store exclusive eco-mix color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nAdditional Social Media Program Titles:\n\nNat Myers – Yellow Peril CD/LP (Easy Eye Sound)\n\nA poet with a staggering and true voice, Korean American troubadour Nat Myers’ folksy blues and pickin’ are authentic, timeless, and enduring. The Kenton County, KY native’s delivery harkens to traditional blues giants, but it’s his unique blend of modern roots and Americana that continues to make crowds drop their jaws. Recorded live at the 100-year-old-plus home of producer Dan Auerbach, Yellow Peril is haunted with the ghosts of the blues’ rich history. [A limited-edition green with black marble color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nCDs + Vinyl:\n\nAmon Düül – Psychedelic Underground [Reissue/1969] CD/LP (Ohr)\n\nThe band Amon Düül formed in 1967, with music being only one part of their artistic work. In 1969, the albums Paradieswärts Düül and Psychedelic Underground were produced. Reviewers describe them as a “document from the birth of German rock.” It was the first krautrock album ever. Even before Can and XHOL Caravan.\n\nBlack Rainbows – Superskull CD/LP (Heavy Psych Sounds)\n\nSuperskull sounds huge, with a great deal of attention paid to the guitars in the recording, and it seems that the band has finally found the perfect balance and tone for their heavy super stoner sound. The album gives you not only incredible heavy rock-stoner gems, but also a space acoustic song, a super psychedelic suite, and a melodic trippy ballad. [Two limited-edition colorways are available: magenta and white w/ blue & pink.]\n\nCable Ties – All Her Plans CD/LP+MP3 (Merge)\n\nAll Her Plans, the third album from Melbourne, Australia’s Cable Ties, finds the trio of Jenny McKechnie, Shauna Boyle, and Nick Brown at their punchiest and most assured. The ferocious, kraut-influenced blend of post-punk and garage rock of Merge debut Far Enough remains, but McKechnie’s lyrics invite the listener closer than ever before. The urgency and fury that have marked Cable Ties’ output thus far is more nuanced on All Her Plans. The unfettered rage of their calls to action endures-tackling subjects like broken mental healthcare systems and the burden of familial care that is largely placed on women-while holding space for gratitude, love, and acceptance. [An indie store exclusive blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nCandlebox – Live At The Neptune CD/LP (Pavement Ent.)\n\nA live acoustic album from multi-platinum rock band Candlebox recorded on November 5, 2021, at the Neptune Theatre in Seattle, Washington.\n\nEric Clapton – The Definitive 24 Nights 6xCD+3xBlu-ray/8xLP+3xBlur-ray (Reprise)\n\nEric Clapton – 24 Nights: Blues 2xCD+DVD/2xLP (Reprise)\n\nEric Clapton – 24 Nights: Rock 2xCD+DVD/3xLP (Reprise)\n\nEric Clapton – 24 Nights: Orchestral 2xCD+DVD/3xLP (Reprise)\n\nIn 1990 and 1991, Eric Clapton performed 42 nights at the Royal Albert Hall in London; 18 shows in 1990 and 24 in 1991. During the run of these shows Clapton performed with three different line-ups: a rock band, a blues band, and an orchestra.

Each song is a different stage and emotional state.” [A limited-edition coke bottle green color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nLloyd Cole – On Pain CD/LP (earMUSIC)\n\nThrough both his work being the front man of Lloyd Cole and The Commotions and his solo career, Lloyd Cole established himself as one of the most articulate and acute songwriters of the post-punk era. Undergoing several artistic shifts, from minimalistic to folk-rock-inspired to electronic, Cole’s work never compromised the high creative value that he has proven to provide over his distinguished career. Following on from his last album, 2019’s critically acclaimed Guesswork, the musical style of On Pain consists mainly of electronic sounds. All songs were written by Lloyd Cole – half of them in collaboration with Neil Clark and Blair Cowan, the original members of The Commotions.\n\nStewart Copeland – Police Deranged For Orchestra CD/LP (BMG)\n\nHigh energy orchestral evening celebrating the work of legendary rock star and composer Stewart Copeland.

[An indie store exclusive blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nDeathcollector – Death’s Toll CD/2xLP (Prosthetic)\n\nDeathcollector started as a way of filling time during Covid lockdowns. Guitarist Mick Carey (Zealot Cult/Brigante) and drummer Andy Whale (Bolt Thrower/Darkened) kept busy working on classic and current metal covers with friends, which were shared across social media. After deciding to work on original material, vocalist Kieran Scott (Ashen Crown/Grimorte) and bassist Lee Cummings (Severe Lacerations/Bloodshed) came on board and Deathcollector was born. [A limited-edition red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nAni DiFranco – Little Plastic Castle [Reissue/1998] CD/2xLP (Righteous Babe)\n\n25th anniversary edition. To make Little Plastic Castle, Ani returned to one of her favorite places to record in that era-the live-in studio the Congress House in Austin, Texas. Though Ani described it as “the most light-hearted album I’ve made in a long time,” this record covers a wide range of topics – the impermanence of existence (“Fuel”), mutual respect (“Pixie”), forgiveness (“As Is”), drugs (“Two Little Girls”) – and emotions. Chosen as one of the “Greatest Albums Made By Women” by NPR in 2017, Little Plastic Castle has proven to have an enduring legacy. [A limited-edition orange color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nDream Evil – DragonSlayer [Reissue/2002] CD/LP (Inner Wound)\n\nDream Evil – The Book Of Heavy Metal [Reissue/2004] CD (Inner Wound)\n\nCD and vinyl reissue of the Swedish power metal band’s debut album.

Sophisticated and earthy, provocative, and multi-faceted, it comprises seventeen tracks which abound with surprises and invention.

Suddenly a band that had previously planned to release some music, break up, and go away to college was touring the world. And during this entire process, that very same band everyone was getting to know ceased to exist. On a practical level, Geese are still the group we were introduced to in 2021.

The Sanctuary Years box set contains four incredible albums from Moore’s time at the prestigious label: A Different Beat, Back To The Blues, Scars, and Power Of The Blues. Furthermore, the set includes a 5.1 (Edited) Mix of Back To The Blues and select interviews, assorted stickers, a poster, and memorabilia.\n\nJason Mraz – Mystical Magical Rhythmical Radical Ride CD/LP (BMG)\n\nJason Mraz is living in full spiral. It’s not full circle, exactly, because he’s changed and his experiences have changed, but on his eighth studio album, Mystical Magical Rhythmical Radical Ride, the musician has found himself returning to a familiar junction in space. Throughout the album, there are hints of Mraz’s formative releases, including his 2002 debut Waiting For My Rocket To Come and 2005’s Mr. A-Z, but it ultimately finds a kinship with 2008’s We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things. The new songs, which are unabashedly pop, see Mraz reuniting with numerous collaborators, including L.A. band Raining Jane and producer Martin Terefe, who helmed the 2008 breakout album. The songs grapple with the emotions and experiences that come with being in your midlife, a time that is often ignored by pop songwriters. Its optimistic, inspiring sensibility reflects the musician’s overall approach to being in the world. It is, in fact, a full spiral, reflecting the past but becoming something new. [An indie store exclusive blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThe Mr. T Experience – Road To Ruin [Reissue/1998] CD/LP (Sounds Rad!)\n\nThe Road To Ruin covers album is a highly sought-after item in the MTX catalog. Originally released in 1998 as part of the Ramones cover series by Clearview Records, it had a limited pressing, including an ultra-rare tour edition with a hand-screened cover. 25 years later, Sound Rad! has reissued the record, preserving its collectability. It has been remastered by Justin Perkins of Mystery Room Mastering.\n\nNat Myers – Yellow Peril CD/LP (Easy Eye Sound)\n\nA poet with a staggering and true voice, Korean American troubadour Nat Myers’ folksy blues and pickin’ are authentic, timeless and enduring. The Kenton County, KY native’s delivery harkens to traditional blues giants, but it’s his unique blend of modern roots and Americana that continues to make crowds drop their jaws. Recorded live at the 100-year-old-plus home of producer Dan Auerbach, Yellow Peril is haunted with the ghosts of the blues’ rich history. [A limited-edition green with black marble color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nBobbie Nelson and Amanda Shires – Loving You CD/LP+MP3 (ATO)\n\nBobbie Nelson’s musical career dates to the 1940s. Naturally gifted on the piano, she played in churches, revival tents, concert halls and honky-tonks, eventually joining her brother Willie Nelson’s Family Band in the early ‘70s. “Loving You ‘is a reflection on the life and music of Bobbie Nelson,” says Grammy-winning singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Amanda Shires. Shires’ mission in making Loving You is to pay respect to the only woman she saw working in a band and pursuing a career as a sideman. “I first saw Bobbie playing when I was 16 at some festival in Texas where I grew up,” she explains. “Much of my path seemed possible because I saw a woman working and making a career of music at a young age, and that woman was Bobbie Nelson.” Loving You features songs Nelson and Shires played and treasured their entire lives – a few of Nelson’s favorites along with her own elegant solo piano title cut. The album would eventually trace Nelson’s musical story – and personal journey. [A limited-edition white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nPardoner – Peace Loving People LP/Cassette (Bar/None)\n\nPardoner is back with Peace Loving People, their fourth and most ambitious full length to date. It explores decades of indie rock styles; hardcore, post-punk, twee, and shoegaze weave amidst band references and lyrics that can be critical, hilarious, or straight up psychedelic all while sounding distinctly Pardoner.\n\nKim Petras – Feed The Beast CD (Amigo)\n\nFeed The Beast is 15 tracks of pure pop perfection; an album about sacrificing every part of yourself to your biggest passion in life that sees her embody a modern-day pop Andromeda – a spin on the classic Greek tale. Her offering to her beast, its lead single “Alone” features diamond-selling hip-hop icon Nicki Minaj.\n\nPortugal. The Man – Chris Black Changed My Life CD/LP (Atlantic)\n\nPortugal. The Man is back after a brief hiatus with the new record Chris Black Changed My Life, the follow up to their global hit Woodstock. PTM have set a personal standard to “change things up” each time they go into the studio to record a new album. This time they enlisted famed producer Jeff Bhasker (Harry Styles, Kanye West, Beyonce, Mark Ronson) to challenge their process. The result of the collaboration brought a new depth to the music and a record that is in lead singer/songwriter John Gourley’s own words “our most complete record that follows a story line from beginning to end”. The record delivers on PTM’s eclectic-ness, pulling influence from music across the globe. Chris Black Changed My Life is a personal story about the loss of a friend and the struggle that comes with it and ultimately ends with the power and endless influence those people will have on your life.\n\nPower Trip – Live In Seattle CD/LP (Southern Lord)\n\nA razor-sharp recording that effectively proves how lethal Power Trip was in a live setting, Live In Seattle was recorded as the title states in Seattle at Neumos on May 28, 2018 and is comprised of a selection of classic tracks from their Nightmare Logic and Manifest Decimation albums. [An indie store exclusive clear vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nTommy Prine – This Far South CD/LP (Thirty Tigers)\n\nTommy Prine’s 2023 debut album, This Far South, is not only a long-awaited introduction but a testimony to Prine’s 20’s and the loss, love, and growth that has defined them. Co-produced by close friend and kindred musical spirit, Ruston Kelly, and beloved Nashville engineer and producer, Gena Johnson, the album is rich and dynamic from cathartic jams to nostalgic storytelling.\n\nPyramaze – Bloodlines CD/LP (AFM)\n\nNew album from the Danish power metal band. [A limited-edition orange w/ blue multicolor vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nRadien – Unissa Palaneet CD/LP (Svart)\n\nSophomore album by the Helsinki quintet. Having begun their existence on the earthly plane in 2014, Radien has forged their brand of idiosyncratic amplifier worship with passion that is in full bloom on Unissa Palaneet. The debut album SYVYYS (2018), given a warm welcome by the international doom/sludge crowd, swam in murkier and more monotone waters, whereas the follow-up presents breathtakingly heavy widescreen sludge that paints its oozing black hues in technicolor.\n\nSonny Rollins – Go West!: The Contemporary Records Albums 3xCD/3xLP (Craft Recordings)\n\nGo West!: The Contemporary Records Albums combines legendary jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins’ two studio albums for Lester Koenig’s Contemporary Records (Way Out West, Sonny Rollins and The Contemporary Leaders) with a third disc, Contemporary Alternate Takes.\n\nSonny Rollins with Heikki Sarmanto Trio – Live At Finlandia Hall, Helsinki 1972 CD/2xLP (Svart)\n\nAn extremely rare live performance at Finland Festival in the summer of 1972. Available for the first time, 50 years after it was initially recorded, this incredible show features Sarmanto on the Fender Rhodes electric piano, his brother Pekka Sarmanto on bass and Esko Rosnell on drums. Legend of American jazz, “Saxophone Colossus” Sonny Rollins hand-picked Heikki Sarmanto and his Finnish trio for this night of improvisation and mutual respect that culminated in years of collaboration after.\n\nRyuichi Sakamoto – 12 CD/2xLP (Milan)\n\n12 is an intimate collection of twelve compositions by Ryuichi Sakamoto written and recorded in Tokyo during his fight with cancer throughout 2021-2022. Each numbered title refers to its recording date. About the album, Sakamoto says: “… after I finally “came home” to my new temporary housing after a big operation, I found myself reaching for the synthesizer. I had no intention of composing something; I just wanted to be showered in sound. I’ll probably continue to keep this kind of “diary.” Sakamoto passed away on March 28, 2023. [A limited-edition clear vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nSecret Machines – The Moth, The Lizard, And The Secret Machines CD/2xLP (TSM)\n\nMuch like a frantic movie about “unfinished business” or “the one that got away,” Secret Machines spent the past few years putting the finishing touches on what should have been their fourth LP. Long regarded as a lost album, The Moth, The Lizard And The Secret Machines was put on pause in 2010 and massaged in the aftermath of 2020’s return-to-form record Awake In The Brain Chamber. Full of winding ear worms and hummable hooks, from its fearless, thunderstruck opener (“There’s No Starting Over”) and the Fripp & Eno-esque outro of “Crucifixion Time” and the somber instrumental sequence that is “Last One Out”. [A limited-edition color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nAnna St. Louis – In The Air CD/LP (Woodsist)\n\nBorn of a thousand nights lost in a surrender to stillness and contemplation, In The Air is Anna St. Louis’ second full length album and her most considered work yet. “St. Louis describes the writing period as one of a slow harvest; a fertile time but one that required a newfound patience. Instead of documenting her first thoughts, she spent more time with each song, going deeper with the themes and ideas she wanted to express. “This slower approach also guided the sonic textures of the album.”\n\nStraight No Chaser – Yacht On The Rocks CD (Arts Music)\n\nYacht on the Rocks is the new full-length album from RIAA certified Gold acapella group Straight No Chaser. The album is a trove of yacht rock classics like “Escape (The Piña Colada Song)”, “Sailing”, “After The Love Has Gone”, and unique mashups including “Waves Of Toto” featuring David Paich of Toto.\n\nSwans – The Beggar 2xCD/2xLP (Young God)\n\nThe Beggar was written and produced by Michael Gira and features contributions from recent and former Swans, members of Angels Of Light, as well as Guest Swan Ben Frost. “After numerous pandemic-induced cancellations of tours for the previous Swans album leaving meaning, and an apparent bottomless pit of waiting, waiting, waiting, and the strange disorientation that came with this sudden but interminable forced isolation I decided it was time to write songs for a new Swans album and forget about everything else. They came relatively easily, always informed by the suspicion that these could be my last. When I finally was able to travel, songs in hand, to Berlin to work with my friends recording this record, the feeling was akin to the moment in The Wizard Of Oz when the film changes from Black and White to Color. Now I’m feeling quite optimistic. My favorite color is pink. I hope you enjoy the album.” – Michael Gira\n\nMatt Tedder – I Can Dream You CD/LP (Matt Tedder)\n\nThough a Parker County native, Matt Tedder has long called Fort Worth home. Of course, home is rarely where any musician lays his head and Matt has been fortunate, at 27, to have experiences over the last thirteen years from street corners to main stages at international festivals. Country roots were ever present as those of a post oak, but blues called him out at a young age and the road home was long. Lauded as a guitar man since he was a boy, Tedder now feeds his true calling as a honky-tonk wordsmith. He’s capable of laying down embraceable turn of phrase inside everything from a hot Austin boogie to a post-war waltz. Then he’ll light up your lava lamp with a psychedelic romp suitable for a desert run with the windows down.\n\nTrophy Eyes – Suicide And Sunshine CD/LP (Hopeless)\n\nJust like the title Suicide And Sunshine, Trophy Eyes’ fourth album is about contrast. About light and dark. About beauty and tragedy. About the full spectrum of life, as told through the eyes of frontman John Floreani. “It’s the human experience,” says Floreani. “What we experience and how we navigate it. The millions of tiny flashes of light that are memories and thoughts and feelings and smells, all those little moments make up a lifetime. They’re beautifully tragic because they don’t mean anything to anyone, and on the scale of everything in the universe don’t mean a damn thing. But it’s so beautiful that they happen in the first place.” Floreani’s willingness to dive so deeply into the most personal parts of his life is matched by the band’s desire to explore the very boundaries of the hardcore genre.\n\nMcCoy Tyner – The Montreux Years CD/2xLP (BMG)\n\nRare and unreleased live material from Claude Nob’s private collection.\n\nVintage Trouble – Heavy Hymnal CD/LP (Cooking Vinyl Limited)\n\nHistory has proven that when the world is in flames, it ignites empathetic artists to siren their words, music, and rhythm, to blanket our society’s fury and nurse scorched souls. The seemingly endless years of pandemic lockdown and social distancing, coupled with the turbulent plague of civil unrest and racial injustice, called on Vintage Trouble to step into their battle wear. Like so often before, they have spun records to drop onto the fighting grounds, with the intent to freeze the frame long enough to momentarily halt the warring world. And while at ease, we can freely choose to think before we strike or decide to retreat, rather than thoughtlessly charge into repeating history. A collection of heavy hymns, Heavy Hymnal is from the heart, and it provides a necessary rise to our ever reckoning. [A limited-edition indie store exclusive white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nValley – Lost In Translation CD/LP (Capitol)\n\nAlternative pop outfit Valley’s sophomore album, Lost In Translation, captures the band’s evolution over the past four years both sonically and emotionally as a group of friends grow through the unpredictability of navigating creative careers. Lead vocalist Rob Laska explains, “It’s a very ‘caught in a thought and seeking’ album. It’s honest, it’s confusing, it’s pop, it’s nostalgic, it’s black and white, its colorful, it’s unpredictable, it’s simple.”\n\nVarious Artists – A State Of Trance 2023 (Mixed by Armin van Buuren) 3xCD (Armada Music)\n\nBrandishing tracks from artists such as Bryan Kearney, Maarten de Jong and Maddix across three CDs rather than the usual two, A State Of Trance 2023 (Mixed by Armin van Buuren) shows that the essence of trance music reaches far, wide and beyond the once-imposed borders.\n\nVarious Artists – Taang! Singles Collection Vol. 1 CD/LP (Taang!)\n\nIn 1983, a record label was formed in Boston, MA, with a focus upon the city’s hardcore punk scene, its name an acronym for Teenagers Are No Good. Since then, it’s founder Curtis Casella has released music of wildly varying levels of quality, but “Taang! Records: The First 10 Singles” provides a surprisingly consistent and highly enjoyable listen consisting of Taang! Records’ first ten singles originally released between 1984 and 1988. Features Gang Green, Last Rights, Stranglehold, Last Stand, Noonday Underground, Negative FX, Oysters, Lemonheads, Moving Targets, and Slapshot.\n\nVarious Artists – Written In Their Soul: The Stax Songwriter Demos 7xCD (Craft Recordings)\n\nWritten In Their Soul: The Stax Songwriter Demos brings together 146 demos from the legendary Stax Records. Including 140 previously unreleased recordings, this collection combines both songwriter demos of some of music’s biggest songs with full-blown arrangements of never released tracks. Compiled by multi-Grammy Award-winning producer Cheryl Pawelski, this 7xCD set is packaged in a 7″x7″ boxset and includes archival photos, and a new essay written by Deanie Parker and Robert Gordon.\n\nVexed – Negative Energy CD/LP (Napalm)\n\nChaotic, traumatic, and based on the band’s most grueling personal experiences, Negative Energy further explores themes of death, betrayal, pain, and grief.\n\nWard – Supernatural Thing CD/LP+MP3 (ANTI-)\n\nSinger/songwriter M. Ward returns with the new studio album Supernatural Thing. His songs “luxuriate in a dream world conjured out of memories, shared stories, and flights of fancy,” Pitchfork says, and the album’s title track also lives in a liminal space in which Elvis comes to him with a message: You Can Go Anywhere You Please. “Well, all my songs depend on dream-imagery to some extent,” Ward explained, “and this was an actual dream I had about Elvis, when he came to me and said that. I don’t know if it’s pandemic-related or not.” Summing up the emotional tone of the record, Ward also sings on this track: “you feel the line is growing thin / between beautiful and strange.” The album’s guest stars – First Aid Kit, Shovels & Rope, Scott McMicken, Neko Case, Jim James, and others – enliven the album with surprises. [An indie store exclusive eco-mix color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThe Watson Twins – Holler CD/LP (Bloodshot)\n\nProduced by Butch Walker, Holler is a collection of songs that finds the twins leaning deeper into their Americana and country roots. The album features the same energetic, foot stompin’ feel as their 2022 single “Two Timin'”. Accompanied by their Nashville based touring band, Holler is a true departure. From the blues inspired “Sissy Said”, to the country soul of “Never Be Another You”, the sisters showcase their celebrated sibling harmonies and strongest songwriting to date. [An indie store exclusive violet color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nWeekend Recovery – Esoteric CD/LP (Criminal Records UK)\n\nWeekend Recovery are back with a brand-new album Esoteric. Mixing equal measures of in-yer-face vox, overdriven guitars and straight-talking lyrics, it’s this mix that’s seeing the Sheffield indie-pop trio into editorial playlists on Apple, Deezer and YouTube alongside shows at Kendal Calling, Bingley Weekender and sell out dates including Corporation Sheffield. [A limited-edition orange color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nWye Oak – Every Day Like The Last: Collected Sings 2019 – 2023 CD/LP+MP3 (Merge)\n\nThe nine songs on Every Day Like The Last, which were recorded in Jenn Wasner and Andy Stack’s current home state of North Carolina and Virginia at venues that include Stack’s backyard studio, compiles the singles Wye Oak has released since 2019’s glowing “Fortune” and includes three new songs. While it wasn’t conceived the way an album traditionally is, these songs coalesce because of the way they examine and grapple with ambiguities, which is reflected by the dual meaning of the title and its attendant track, a pensive, suspended-in-midair track that contemplates the importance of human connection.\n\nXasthur – Inevitably Dark 2xCD/3xCD/2xLP (Prophecy)\n\nThere is hardly a more fitting title for the new Xasthur compositions than Inevitably Dark. Darkness is the element that holds all the tracks together even though they are expressed in a multitude of genres, which even includes black metal. This time. Be warned: this album is neither meant as a return to black metal of mastermind Scott Conner, even though he does this time, nor a guarantee that it will happen again next time – although, he might. Conner has used black metal, dark ambient, acid folk, doomgrass, and other genres to express what he has seen and felt, as well to find his own sound or style at a point in time – for example when he was without a steady home and often living in hotels or cars. His insights into the underbelly of the American dream are reflected in the lyrics of Inevitably Dark, which are there even though there is no singing on the album. [A limited-edition 3xCD book edition featuring a bonus disc and a limited-edition red w/ black marble color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nYakuza – Sutra CD/2xLP (Svart)\n\nOver 10 years after their last release, Yakuza has returned with Sutra losing none of their expansive and wildly artistic approach to pushing the boundaries of heavy music. Sutra leans in on redefining the limits of heavy and eclectic metal.\n\nDVD + Blu-ray:\n\nThe Day The Music Died – The Story Of Don McLean’s American Pie – DVD/Blu-ray (BFD)\n\nDespite a nearly nine-minute length, Don McLean’s 1971 paean to a nation’s loss of innocence in the decade following the death of Buddy Holly became a defining chart-topper of its era – and still, “American Pie” remains one of the most covered, debated, and celebrated songs of the culture. Here, McLean holds court on his career and his defining effort’s creation, as well as shedding light and popping myths about the significance of its lyrics. Fans like Brian Wilson, Garth Brooks, and more share perspectives.\n\nThis Week’s Vinyl Exclusives:\n\nAcid Mothers Temple & The Melting Paraiso UFO – Acid Motherly Love [Reissue/2007] 2xLP (Riot Season)\n\nAt the time firmly fixed to a solid four-piece (Tsuyama Atsushi, Higashi Hiroshi, Shimura Koji and Kawabata Makoto) with added guest vocalists, Acid Mothers Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. returned to their spiritual home of the UK Riot Season for yet another out-there ride through their weird and psychedelic world. Guitars howl, riffs grow bigger with each minute and brains get fried along the way.\n\nRalph Alessi – It’s Always Now LP (ECM)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. Ralph Alessi’s fourth appearance as a leader for the ECM label follows a singular album run that’s been met with nothing but praise from the New York Times to the Guardian. On his new album, Alessi’s unique tone is as limber, piercing, and present as ever, enveloped by a fresh quarter lineup including Florian Weber (piano), B”nz Oester (bass) and Gerry Hemingway (drums), that navigates through the trumpeter’s idiosyncratically swinging compositions with a sixth sense.\n\nAlici – Frutas b/w Can’t Keep My Plants Alive 7” (Eraserhood Sound)\n\nAlici is a singer and multi-instrumentalist currently living in New York City, but she wants you to know that her heart, and her ear, are firmly located in her home country of Brazil. She was born and raised in the sprawling metropolis of Bel Horizonte, and safe to say the city’s sights, sounds, and essence left a lasting impression on her. Alici has made it her mission to spread bossa nova, the iconic musical language created in Brazil in the 1950s, to a new generation of music fans in America and around the world. Having been raised on the vinyl of Gal Costa, Tim Maia, Evinha and more, she is now creating a sound both timeless and forward thinking. On her debut 7″ “Frutas” b/w “Can’t Keep My Plants Alive”, which features analog production from Philadelphia’s Eraserhood Sound, Alici showcases her unique, soulful, bossa-influenced guitar style. [A limited-edition bubblegum pink colorway is available.]\n\nAmerican Aquarium – Things Change [Reissue/2018] LP (New West)\n\nIn the lush tobacco fields of North Carolina where BJ Barham was raised, people work hard. Families stay nearby, toiling and growing together. BJ loves those farms and his tiny Reidsville hometown, but he had to run off and start American Aquarium, a band now beloved by thousands. BJ couldn’t stay. But he couldn’t really leave, either: he’s still singing about the lessons, stories, and lives that define rural America-and him. Recorded at 3CG Records in Tulsa, Oklahoma, American Aquarium’s seventh studio album, Things Change was produced by Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter John Fulbright and features cameos from Americana standouts including John Moreland and Jamie Lin Wilson. Stacked with BJ’s signature storytelling-always deeply personal but also instantly relatable.\n\nAnti Heros – American Pie [Reissue/1996] LP (Taang!)\n\nVinyl reissue of the 1996 album from the punk band.\n\nAtivin – Austere LP (Joyful Noise)\n\nOxblood color vinyl pressing. Eschewing the explosive and aggressive playing that characterizes their earlier work, Austere finds the post-rock guitar duo of Daniel Burton (Early Day Miners) and Chris Carothers (Hunting People, Grizzly Daughter) enlisting Chris Brokaw (Codeine, Come) on drums for a more stripped down and skeletal sound. The result is a work of beauty that will undoubtedly evoke a wide range of emotions in those who hear it.\n\nRoger Bekono – Roger Bekono LP/Cassette (Awesome Tapes From Africa)\n\nRoger Bekono made a deep mark in the contemporary history of Cameroonian music through the four-on-the-floor, ribald intensity of bikutsi. The Ewondo-language dance-pop style that forms an undulating tapestry of interlocking triplet rhythmic interplay came to international prominence in the European “world music” scene as the ‘90s began. But the relentless sound of bikutsi developed in Yaoundé at the hands of Bekono and many others, as it developed from a village-based singing style performed mostly by women into a cosmopolitan music force that rivaled the popularity of established musics like Congolese rhumba, merengue, and makossa. With his unique-some say suave-voice, Bekono contributed much over a period of more than 10 years as part of the evolution of this traditional rhythm-turned-urban dance movement.\n\nBlack To Comm – Alphabet 1968 [Reissue/2009] LP (Cellule 75)\n\nVinyl reissue of Black To Comm’s 2009 album originally on Type Recordings. Marc Richter aka Black To Comm released his debut record 20 years ago. In 2023 he is still busy releasing music under various disguises and is currently signed to the Thrill Jockey label. To celebrate this anniversary his own Cellule 75 label is re-releasing some classic out-of-print vinyl albums that originally came out on the defunct Type and de Stijl labels. The music itself played with the notion of nostalgia without being nostalgic itself. It’s the sound of half-remembered dreams, a surreal distorted vision of the past, an aural polaroid of long forgotten musics, a ghostly voice from a non-existent era.\n\nNorah Brown with Sarah Kate Morgan – Live From Bristol 7” (Jalopy)\n\n“Nora has a passion for the music of eastern Kentucky and Tennessee… with a thirst for storytelling.” – Bob Boilen, NPR All Songs Considered. Nora Brown and Sarah Kate Morgan play with beauty and depth in the performances captured on their new single, Live From Bristol, recorded live at Earnest Tube Studios in Bristol, VA. This single features Nora on banjo or guitar and Sarah Kate playing the mountain dulcimer on two traditional songs, and the single is limited edition on opaque purple vinyl.\n\nGary Burton – New Quartet [Reissue/1973] LP (ECM)\n\nAs well as being the great vibes innovator of the era, Gary Burton has been a most astute talent scout. In 1973, The New Quartet introduced Abraham Laboriel: this was the first recording of the bassist who would shortly become one of the most in-demand session players across all genres. Guitarist Mick Goodrick also emerged as a player to watch with this album, shining in a well-conceived program with compositions of Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Carla Bley, Mike Gibbs, and bandleader Burton.\n\nThe Cat & Bells Club. – The Cat & Bells Club. LP (Blank Forms Edition)\n\nArchival release. In 1992, under the guise of the Cat & Bells Club, eighteen-year-old Cheriton residents Graham Lambkin and Darren Harris self-released three tapes-two yellow cassettes and one pink-documenting their earliest musical efforts at S.H.P. studios (Lambkin’s bedroom in his parents’ house). The lowest of all lo-fi recordings, these tracks were laid down live, directly into a boombox with no overdubs. Relieved of their academic expectations and plunged into the workforce, the duo aspired to enter the annals of rock history, making their own primitive teenage overtures to Marc Bolan, the Incredible String Band, Whitehouse, and the Godz. Lyrically and spiritually the Cat & Bells Club. had much to do with Bolan’s early Tyrannosaurus Rex project, but with a hyperlocalized Folkestonian twist that nonetheless maintained his penchant for chevaline.\n\nChannel Zero – PIAS 40 12” (PIAS America)\n\nChannel Zero is a band from Brussels formed in 1990 by Franky “DSVD” de Smet Van Damme, Xavier Carion, Tino de Martino and Phil Baheux. Their name came from an American rap song by the group Public Enemy called “She Watch Channel Zero?”. Inspired in its beginnings by Metallica and more generally by the thrash movement of the ‘90s. Play It Again Sam signed the group in 1994 and produced its third album Unsafe. This album allowed them to make themselves known in the States, to perform in major European festivals and to be the headliner on a tour in Australia.\n\nCinderella – Night Songs [Reissue/1986] LP (Friday Music)\n\nTwo colorways: red and purple/violet. Night Songs is the debut studio album by glam metal band Cinderella, originally released in 1986. Includes the singles “Shake Me”, “Nobody’s Fool”, and “Somebody Save Me”.\n\nCock Sparrer – Here We Stand [Reissue/2007] LP (Pirate Press)\n\nCock Sparrer – Forever [Reissue/2017] LP (Pirate Press)\n\nFor many, this band requires no introduction, as they are indeed legends in a vibrant scene stretching across the world. At the same time, for anyone not part of that category, they are far and away the best band that you’ve not heard of yet. With 2007s Here We Stand, legendary punk rockers Cock Sparrer moved into the 21st Century, and staked their claim on an exciting new era for the band. Never content to simply rest on the considerable laurels of their back catalog, the first Sparrer studio album since the 1997 not only put a new release into the hands of the old faithful and new fans alike, but kicked off a renewed period of active international touring and headlining festival appearances that has continued to this very day. Forever, their sixth album, truly exemplifies how incredible and how special this band is.\n\nCro-Mags – The Age Of Quarrel [Reissue/1986] LP (Astor Place)\n\nCro-Mags – Best Wishes [Reissue/1989] LP (Astor Place)\n\nRegular black and color vinyl (smoke and clear w/ splatter, respectively) reissues of the New York hardcore band’s first two albums.\n\nCRTB – Life In Exile 12” (Steel City Dance)\n\nAs far as debut EP’s go, Life In Exile is a spellbinding introduction to the sounds of CRTB, a producer and DJ whose name is beginning to burn hot on the tongues of punters up and down the land, with good reason. Characterized by pulsating, bass-driven grooves and masterful percussion, Newcastle born, London based CRTB has unveiled a monster of sound with his latest venture, where the producer flexes an ungodly blend of four-to-the-floor basslines, contagious melodies, and synths to create a visceral soundscape, infectious enough to cause dancefloor destruction wherever these sounds land.\n\nDeath Cab For Cutie – The Photo Album [Reissue/2001] 2xLP+MP3 (Barsuk)\n\nDeluxe color vinyl reissue. Released in 2000, We Have The Facts And We’re Voting Yes delivered on the promise of You Can Play These Songs With Chords and Something About Airplanes. For once, a band’s popularity grew commensurate with its maturation. Despite the heightened attention, singer/songwriter/guitarist Ben Gibbard next let loose Death Cab for Cutie’s finest moment, “Photobooth,” the lead track on the sparkling Forbidden Love EP. New fans worldwide swooned under its beguiling romantic rise ‘n’ fall and its lingering, bittersweet, wallet-sized artifact. And though it wouldn’t have killed them to include “Photobooth” here — for its spotless greatness and thematic likeness — The Photo Album‘s ten tracks are of the EP’s heightened caliber.\n\nDeicide – Scars Of The Crucifix [Reissue/2004] LP (Earache)\n\nRecorded at the legendary Morrisound Studios in Florida, Scars Of The Crucifix heralded the return to form of one of the death metal originators who, after leaving their previous label, were full of venom, hate and aggression.\n\nThe Dickies – Locked ‘N’ Loaded LP (Taang!)\n\n1991 live album from the iconic punk rock band.\n\nDrudkh – Autumn Aurora [Reissue/2004] LP (Season Of Mist)\n\nDrudkh – Estrangement [Reissue/2007] LP (Season Of Mist)\n\nDrudkh – Blood In Our Wells [Reissue/2007] LP (Season Of Mist)\n\nAutumn Aurora is the second album by Ukrainian black metal band Drudkh, originally released in 2004.

Drudkh’s sixth album, Estrangement, was previously known under the title River Of Tears, but then had a name change. Its songs have a minimalistic influence and feature the band’s first prominent use of blast beats since The Swan Road. All the lyrics of the album are based on the 1931-1932 works of the Ukrainian poet Oleh Olzhych. 2010’s Blood In Our Wells continues on the patriotic Pagan black metal path while introducing progressive elements. Follow Drudkh once more on a journey to freedom, self-determination and enlightenment cast into a glorious musical shape.\n\nEiafuawn – Birds In The Ground [Reissue/2006] LP (Numero)\n\nCanary yellow color vinyl pressing. While Duster went into hibernation in the year 2000, Clay Parton’s four-track never stopped rolling. Recorded alone at home over several years, Birds In The Ground is an album of 30-something, post-9/11 malaise. Under his Eiafuawn (Everything Is All F***ed Up And What Not) acronym, Parton hides beneath layers of fuzzy and clean guitars, his hesitant, cottony vocal disappear into noise. This deluxe pressing is packaged in a gorgeous tip-on sleeve and includes the complete lyrics for this cryptic entry of the Dusterverse.\n\nEloy – Echoes From The Past LP+MP3 (Drakkar)\n\nNew album from the German prog rock band. [A limited-edition white colorway is available.]\n\nEnya – A Box Of Dreams [Reissue/1997] 6xLP (Reprise)\n\nA Box Of Dreams was originally released in 1997 as a three-disc box set and contains tracks from Enya’s 1987 debut album Enya to 1997’s best-of collection Paint The Sky With Stars, each thematically arranged.\n\nEye Am – Dreams Always Die With The Sun 7” (Corpse Paint)\n\nEye Am is an organic hard rock and heavy metal supergroup, featuring the powerhouse songwriting duo of Kenny Hickey (Type O Negative) and Kirk Windstein (Crowbar, Down), alongside Todd Strange (ex-Crowbar, ex-Down) on bass and the legendary Johnny Kelly (Type O Negative) on drums. Eye Am’s music draws influence from the melodic genius of The Beatles to the riff-heavy aggression of Black Sabbath, making them a dynamic force in the world of hard rock and heavy metal. [A limited-edition clear vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nMartin Frawley – The Wannabe LP (Trouble In Mind)\n\nA personal, cheeky and, at times, self-depreciating collection of songs unpacking the reality of finding his way as an adult without his dad around, and ultimately falling back in love with life, music, and someone new. [A limited-edition baby blue colorway is available.]\n\nFrenzal Rhomb – Cup Of Pestilence LP (Fat Wreck Chords)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. New album from the veteran Australian punk band. Drink long and deep of its zest. It’s lifegiving succor. It’s mad riffs. “Frenzal Rhomb’s tenth studio album, The Cup Of Pestilence, covers everything from drug dealers to drug cooks, to actually taking drugs. Really diverse stuff. But is it any good? The answer is a hard no – because it’s better than good – it’s absolutely fucking awesome.” – Dave Mullins, Wall Of Sound\n\nThe Gate – The Numbers LP (Birdman)\n\nArchival release. In the 1980s, Michael Morley helped to push the jangly New Zealand music scene towards rougher, more exploratory realms, as a member of Wreck Small Speakers on Expensive Stereos, The Weeds, and the almighty Dead C. His gnarled, distorted guitar tone and aggressively moan-based vocal style are both as distinctive as they are secretly beautiful. Morley has released dozens of solo recordings-starting in the late 1980s as Gate, then more recently under his own name, and as the Righteous Yeah. He’s also unafraid to tackle entirely new genres and sounds, and to move into interactive installation-based music as well.\n\nGirlhouse – The Girlhouse EP LP (Secret Road Music)\n\nFollowing the enormous radio and playlist success behind lead singles “Loaded Gun”, “The Fatalist”, and “Knuckle Tattoo”, fast-rising bedroom pop artist Girlhouse (aka Lauren Luiz) releases The Girlhouse EP. Taking cues from the likes of Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Snail Mail, her debut EP introduces the world to her fresh and euphoric sound, and tells the tales of her time living in L.A. and the relationships she nurtured along the way.\n\nCory Hanson – Western Cum LP/Cassette (Drag City)\n\nWestern Cum (say it three times fast! Nope, doesn’t help) departs radically from the acoustic existential of Cory’s first two solo releases, torching their haunted dreamscapes by upping its heat to molten levels, six strings at a time. A darkly comic evisceration of the end of the American road; great tunes to modern dance along with, too.\n\nWendell Harrison – The Carnivorous Lady [Reissue/1988] LP (Tidal Waves Music)\n\nThe Carnivorous Lady is a monster of an album featuring an all-star line-up that includes Marcus Belgrave (Ray Charles, Houston Person, Charlie Mingus) on guitar, Duke Billingslea (Martha Reeves) and Pamela Wise (Tribe) on keyboards, Larry Fratangelo (Fred Wesley, Dennis Coffey) on percussion and Shirley Hayden (Parliament/Funkadelic) on vocals. On this fantastic sounding album (produced by the maestro himself) the listener is invited to experience a synthesis of what has been and what is now. The record shows Wendell’s trademark proficiency on saxophone, flute, and clarinet. Although you can hear the ‘80s creeping in with a smoother fusion sound, infectious boogie synths, R&B vocals, and a lot of mind-blowing jazz-funk percussions… this album remains a very spiritual (and soulful) hard bop jazz record.\n\nHeavenly – Le Jardin De Heavenly [Reissue/1992] LP (Skepwax)\n\nVinyl reissue of Heavenly’s second album includes relevant single releases, a 7” booklet with lyrics, and new sleeve notes by the members of the band. By the time Le Jardin De Heavenly was ready to roll, Heavenly was an established part of the Sarah Records stable in the UK and honorary members of the International Pop Underground in the US, where Le Jardin De Heavenly was released by K Records. The songs on the album are rich with pop melodies and complex harmonies but the band didn’t hold anything back.\n\nTim Hecker – No Highs 2xLP (Kranky)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. The latest by Canadian composer Tim Hecker serves as a beacon of unease against the deluge of false positive corporate ambient currently in vogue. Whether taken as warning or promise, No Highs delivers-this is music of austerity and ambiguity, purgatorial and seasick. A jagged anti-relaxant for our medicated age, rough-hewn and undefined. Morse code pulse programming flickers like distress signals while a gathering storm of strings, noise, and low-end looms in the distance. Processed electronics shiver and shudder against pitch-shifting assemblages of crackling voltage, mantric horns (including exquisite modal sax by Colin Stetson), and cathedral keys. Throughout, the pieces both accrue and avoid drama, more attuned to undertow than crescendo.\n\nBillie Holiday – Songs For Distingue Lovers [Reissue/1958] LP (Verve)\n\nIt is undeniable that Billie Holiday’s singing changed in her later years. Her voice darkened and shifted to a lower range. Her economy of expression distilled her sound to its essence – a kind of heightened speech. The classic album Songs For Distingue Lovers, her best work of the 1950s, has also deepened and become burnished with time. Part of Verve’s Acoustic Sound Series featuring transfers from analog tapes, remastered, and pressed on 180gm vinyl housed in a gatefold jacket.\n\nJohn Lee Hooker – Alone: Live At Hunter College 1976 [Reissue/1976] 2xLP (BMG)\n\nJohn Lee Hooker’s entire legendary 1976 solo concert recorded live at New York’s Hunter College.

Since forming a decade ago in their native Toronto, Keys N Krates have carved their own path via a bass-centric, sample-driven sound, melding the realms of electronic, hip-hop, and beyond. The group – composed of drummer Adam Tune, keyboardist David Matisse and turntablist Jr. Flo – has built a venerable reputation as one of the leading live electronic acts today on the strength of their onstage instrumentation and energetic sets.\n\nFela Ransome Kuti & The Afrika 70 – Gentleman [Reissue/1973] LP (Knitting Factory Works)\n\nLimited edition smoke color vinyl pressing. The title track, “Gentleman”, has often been hailed as Fela’s masterpiece. The politically scathing song opposes Westernization and those who imitate Western ways. Fela had many Ghanaian friends (and Ghanaian wives and Ghanaian girlfriends) and “Fe Fe Ne Efe” is sung as a tribute to Ghana. “Igbe (Na Shit)” again shows Fela breaking cultural taboos by singing literally and figuratively about ‘shit’. He sings the word in a several Nigerian languages so there is no misunderstanding.\n\nThe Legendary Pink Dots – Faces In The Fire [Reissue/1984] LP (PIAS America)\n\nThe Legendary Pink Dots are an Anglo-Dutch rock band who formed in August 1980 in London and moved to Amsterdam in 1984. Their singular style is a mixture of soaring psychedelic rock and experimental industrial or ambient music. Faces In The Fire was their first production. Released on Play It Again Sam in 1984, it was a small concentration of sweet synthpop with experimental and sensual ramblings. As one of the most interesting and creative bands on the English iconoclastic music scene, The Legendary Pink Dots took us on an initiatory journey to discover new notions of musical genres.\n\nMJ Lenderman – Ghost Of Your Guitar Solo [Reissue/2021] LP (Dear Life)\n\nMj Lenderman is the project of Asheville native, Jake Lenderman, whose Boat Songs was released to wide acclaim on Dear Life Records in 2022.

Joe Lovano’s third album Trio Tapestry finds the group extending its spacious and lyrical approach with deep listening and intense focus. Marilyn Crispell is the optimal pianist for this music, orchestrating it as it unfolds with a sensibility attuned to both contemporary chamber music and post-Coltrane improvising. Drummer Carmen Castaldi, a Lovano associate since teenage years, embellishes the music with his own poetic touch on cymbals and, like Joe, draws blossoming resonances from gongs.\n\nLutalo – Once Now, Then Again LP/Cassette (Winspear)\n\nPurple color vinyl pressing. Growing up in Minnesota, life constantly took multi-instrumentalist and producer Lutalo Jones back and forth across the Mississippi River, through the beating heart of the Twin Cities, from their home in Minneapolis to school in St Paul. In 2021 Lutalo and their partner moved east, to settle among the green peaks of Vermont, having taken ownership of an area of land with the intention of building a small community for themselves. The aim is to accomplish a long-held dream: to live life differently, to invest in and create something tangible that can be passed on to future generations. The to-and-fro of that early life has been replaced by something altogether steadier, a burning desire to not get so caught up in the intensity of the world. It’s this overwhelming potency of modernity that ripples through Lutalo’s musical work.\n\nMad Sin – Burn And Rise [Reissue/2010] LP (Svart)\n\nOfficial reissue of the German psychobilly legend Mad Sin’s 2010 album Burn And Rise. Since their indestructible bandleader Kofte DeVille had gone through some major personal changes, which encouraged him to lose almost 40 kilograms, the album title is more than adequate.\n\nMatt Maeson – Bank On The Funeral [Reissue/2019] LP (Atlantic)\n\nBank On The Funeral features Maeson’s breakthrough hit, “Cringe”. Another alumb track, “Beggar’s Song”, was described by EARMILK as “a medley of emotions with a catchy, powerful chorus that manages to somehow be self-deprecating and motivating at the same time. With a simple folksy melody as the foundation, the song builds up through modern production to elevate listener and singer alike…” “Beggar’s Song” is “a force to behold,” wrote Ones To Watch. “It is in his latest and perhaps most optimistic work to date where Maeson ascends to newfound heights.”\n\nMammatus – Expanding Majesty 2xLP (Silver Current)\n\nEight years in the making, Santa Cruz, California’s reclusive sons of tectonic riffage Mammatus return with Expanding Majesty, a sixty-nine-minute magnum opus of kaleidoscopic guitars, soaring analog synths, wall-of-amps fuzz bass and one hundred feet drums.\n\nWalter Martin – The World At Night LP (Family Jukebox)\n\nWalter Martin, lyricist and co-writer from The Walkmen and 2019 winner at Cannes for original music and 2019 Clio award winner for original music, releases the album The World At Night. NPR has said “[Martin’s albums] celebrate the best of humanity; love, innocence, joy, empathy and the wonder of existence itself. It’s the kind of music that can bring tears to your eyes from marveling at all the beauty in the world.”\n\nThe Menace – Screwed Up (The Best Of Menace) LP (Taang!)\n\n2022 collection from the British street punk band.\n\nModel/Actriz – Dogsbody LP (True Panther Sounds)\n\nLimited transparent blue color vinyl pressing.

Coming from Leuven, a small town near Brussels, where Dirk and Frank shape their own sound from the start. They released a spellbinding series of albums that offered a bold variety of tracks. “Chinese Black”, “TV Treated” and “Miss Brown” were (and still are) pure underground hits at the height of new wave. It is therefore, no coincidence that they are rightly considered pioneers of the EBM genre.\n\nNew Fast Automatic Daffodils – PIAS 40 12” (PIAS America)\n\nNew Fast Automatic Daffodils (also known as New FADS) were an alternative rock band from Manchester, England, formed in 1988 by Andy Spearpoint, Dolan Hewison, Icarus Wilson-Wright, Justin Crawford, and Perry Saunders.

Signed in 1990 to Play It Again Sam Records, their debut album, Pigeonhole, reached the UK top 50 in November. The band released nine singles and three albums before breaking up in 1996.\n\nOdie – Analogue [Reissue/2018] LP+MP3 (Unite)\n\nBlue color vinyl pressing. Analogue is the genre-bending debut album from Odie, originally released in April 2018. Analogue takes us through a range of emotions and explores themes such as growing up, figuring oneself out and striving for creative dreams as an analogue artist in a digital world. Channeling some of his key musical influences, such as Kid Cudi & Fela Kuti, the album acts as a coming-of-age story and introduces fans to who Odie really is as a human and artist, “flaws and all.”\n\nOld And New Dreams (Don Cherry, Dewey Redman, Charlie Hayden) – Old And New Dreams [Reissue/1979] LP (ECM)\n\nDon Cherry, Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden and Ed Blackwell came together to celebrate the work of mentor Ornette Coleman, but the repertoire of their Old And New Dreams quartet soon blossomed into a project of much wider scope, addressing also the musical experiences the players had made individually in their travels around the world.

More than halfway through the recording process, they have decided to treat us to another two-sider of the new material.\n\nPearls Before Swine – Balaklava [Reissue/1968] 2xLP (Earth Recordings)\n\nDouble LP expanded reissue of Pearls Before Swine’s follow up to One Nation Underground, includes unreleased extras.

Where the warm, homespun piano of her 2018 debut, Homes, drew widespread praise and announced her arrival as a bold new voice, Living Circle sees the artist pushing forwards into deeper, more expansive sonic realms. With tracks stretching longer and slower, and her piano lines less ornate and dominant, Living Circle is a heavyweight album and a must-hear for fans of Stars Of The Lid, Sarah Davachi, Max Richter and Labradford.\n\nSkinny Puppy – PIAS 40 12” (PIAS America)\n\nSkinny Puppy is a Canadian band Influenced by pioneering industrial bands such as Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, or Suicide.

Intuitive and raw music, momentary and reflective, released on Ripatti’s own label Rajaton. “Stillness is a myth. Consider concepts such as ‘still water’, or ‘still air’ for that matter. Go to a restaurant, ask them for a glass of still water, hold it against the light and see where we’re at. Even though the water itself has been captured and imprisoned in the glass, it never stops breathing. It’s filled with tiny particles, dancing. Everything can be explained on a molecular level, but since we’re not scientists – and even if you happen to be – it’s the natural world of perception that moves me.”\n\nWillie Isz – Georgiavania [Reissue/2009] LP (Lex)\n\nAfrican violet color vinyl reissue. “Think of Willie Isz as Gnarls Barkley’s fucked-up little cousin. In fact, it’s the handiwork of Philly-based producer-vocalist Jneiro Jarel and Cee-Lo’s Goodie Mob mate Khujo. Their debut shares Gnarls’ yen for psychedelic weirdness and uncharacteristic (for hip-hop) emotional vulnerability, but with beats that are swampy, murky, and — when thumping below moaning guitars and spacey organ melodies — wholly disorienting.” – David Peisner, SPIN (2009)\n\nLyman Woodard Organization – Saturday Night Special [Reissue/1975] 2xLP (BBE)\n\nPossibly the best known of Strata’s releases, The Lyman Woodard Organization’s Saturday Night Special is rightly heralded as a jazz fusion classic. Recorded in 1975, ‘Saturday Night Special’ features organ, electric piano and Mellotron by bandleader Lyman Woodard alongside guitar and bass by Ron English, with drums and percussion by Leonard King, Bud Spangler & Lorenzo “Mr. Rhythm” Brown. respectively.\n\nXasthur – Rehearsals 1997 – 1999 LP (Prophecy)\n\nWith the first couple of rehearsals from ’97 lost or stolen, there were a few between ’97 and ’99 that were saved and compiled. By 2013, Scott created a CDR containing those rehearsal tracks – reported as 200 copies having been created, however less than 100 were ever made available. With Scott on guitar and/ or drums, and aided by nameless musicians directed by Scott, the rehearsals were recorded on a cassette Walkman at his home. The outcome of these recordings are very raw, dirty, lo-fi, live demo tracks, mostly instrumentals, with tracks 5 and 6 featuring vocals [by an anonymous helper]. All potential band members were soon dismissed. [A limited-edition red colorway is available.]\n\nCassettes:\n\nRoger Bekono – Roger Bekono (Awesome Tapes From Africa)\n\nRoger Bekono made a deep mark in the contemporary history of Cameroonian music through the four-on-the-floor, ribald intensity of bikutsi. The Ewondo-language dance-pop style that forms an undulating tapestry of interlocking triplet rhythmic interplay came to international prominence in the European “world music” scene as the ‘90s began. But the relentless sound of bikutsi developed in Yaoundé at the hands of Bekono and many others, as it developed from a village-based singing style performed mostly by women into a cosmopolitan music force that rivaled the popularity of established musics like Congolese rhumba, merengue, and makossa. With his unique-some say suave-voice, Bekono contributed much over a period of more than 10 years as part of the evolution of this traditional rhythm-turned-urban dance movement.\n\nCory Hanson – Western Cum (Drag City)\n\nWestern Cum (say it three times fast! Nope, doesn’t help) departs radically from the acoustic existential of Cory’s first two solo releases, torching their haunted dreamscapes by upping its heat to molten levels, six strings at a time. A darkly comic evisceration of the end of the American road; great tunes to modern dance along with, too.\n\nLutalo – Once Now, Then Again (Winspear)\n\nGrowing up in Minnesota, life constantly took multi-instrumentalist and producer Lutalo Jones back and forth across the Mississippi River, through the beating heart of the Twin Cities, from their home in Minneapolis to school in St Paul. In 2021 Lutalo and their partner moved east, to settle among the green peaks of Vermont, having taken ownership of an area of land with the intention of building a small community for themselves. The aim is to accomplish a long-held dream: to live life differently, to invest in and create something tangible that can be passed on to future generations. The to-and-fro of that early life has been replaced by something altogether steadier, a burning desire to not get so caught up in the intensity of the world. It’s this overwhelming potency of modernity that ripples through Lutalo’s musical work.\n\nPardoner – Peace Loving People (Bar/None)\n\nPardoner is back with Peace Loving People, their fourth and most ambitious full length to date. It explores decades of indie rock styles; hardcore, post-punk, twee, and shoegaze weave amidst band references and lyrics that can be critical, hilarious, or straight up psychedelic all while sounding distinctly Pardoner."
