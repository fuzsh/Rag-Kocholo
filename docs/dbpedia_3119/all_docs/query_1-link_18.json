I wouldn't have a prayer of survival. With every man I loved, I wrote myself so neatly safe in self denial. I am never sorry, never wrong. I kept emotions in my songs. I'm never weak, I'm always strong. When I'm in love, I don't stay long. I find protection my defense against a world of helplessness. I've learned to straddle every fence. I hold the hands of time securely to my breast massaging memories in quest of happiness. I won't take bribes. I will not die to keep you satisfied. I scream and pant through every line, releasing poison with every autograph I sign. I wouldn't have a chance without a poet's heart. Just Don't Compare Me To The Blues. Sarah smile, no Sarah frown cause Sarah loves a juvenile not in numbers but in mind She needs to leave him, just bereave him, he's robbing her emotions blind her fragile is left behind It's the plight of every woman once a mother said Light a candle everyone for every tear we've shed If a mother says a daughter just ignore the signs It's the plight of every woman til the end of time Traumatized and dramatized, but never rightly equalized Turn each page of borrowed time to see that History's no mystery, hear what it's saying his story Well what should we expect to find It's the plight of every woman once a mother said Light a candle everyone for every tear we've shed If a mother says a daughter just ignore the signs It's the plight of every woman til the end of time and ooh how it hurts when a girl becomes aware, what will she be a secret world unfolds, the innocence dies but nothing earthly or unearthly can compare, such a beauty to the understanding eyes of a woman growing wise So many of us are feeling at the end of our hope But I'm here to tell you, we got a whole lot more than hope Lisa, Carol, Karen, Helen, Faybiene Miranda, Chantal, Chaka Listen when the little sisters speak, Maanami, Chiriqui, Camae, Candice, Imani Vicky, Nona, Deborah, Dierdre, Lee, Lace, Cindy, Biti, Cecilia As the winds of change blow in our direction, we the breath of life pray for peace, love and protection It's the plight of every woman once a mother said Light a candle everyone for every tear we've shed If a mother says a daughter just ignore the signs It's the plight of every woman til the end of time Sarah smile, smile for me Sarah smile, smile for you\n\n7.\n\ndeluded #2 00:34\n\n8.\n\nSpringtime In Hell 05:16\n\nSpringtime In Hell Let’s say we give this fool a heart He knows not

promised land Heed the signs, when the sky falls down no shelter can be found hear me now I say, will you go Will you be there for us all, or break the chain Don't break the chain They were building

the only one I watched you walk your life, when all I knew was how to run You put me on a pedestal then left me all alone You watched me turn to stone Long ago a sweet sweet song was what we used to sing A song from the book of love, we laughed at everything We gave from May to May, we gave through night and day, and now we cannot say why we're cold Is there nothing left oh To be loved to be loving is what you make it when there's two people giving more than they're taking Til there's nothing left give, nothing left to take or give Comes a time when a woman deserves a saviour Comes a time when a man needs a hand to save her when there's nothing to give Nothing left for us to give No we didn't ask for it, autumns in the air Like a tree chokes a thirsty leaf, what's left of love is dangling somewhere Let's bury it with flowers and treat it with respect, for hanging around us so long when there's nothing left Long ago a sweet sweet song washed away the dirt A song from the book of love the best I'd ever heard We gave from May to May, we gave through night and day, and now we cannot say why we're cold, we're so cold, I'm so cold To be loved to be loving is what you make it when there's two people giving more than they're taking Til there's nothing left give, nothing left to take or give Comes a time when a woman deserves a saviour Come a time when a man needs a hand to save her when there's nothing to give, nothing left to take or give Used to feel the colours of the rainbow, now we're faded down to gray and woh I Nothing left to give, nothing left to take or give Satisfied my hunger every part of me then, chased the blues straight to my heart then, when Nothing left to give, nothing left for us to To be loved to be loving is what you make it when there's two people giving more than they're taking Til there's nothing left give, nothing left to take or give Comes a time when a woman deserves a saviour Comes a time when a man needs a hand to save her when there's nothing to give, nothing left for us to give Come on let's bury it with flowers Kiss and love me til the final hour nothing to give, nothing left for us to give Long ago I heard your sweet sweet song and oh I nothing to give, nothing left to give Inside your heart, beside your soul is where I know I need I wanna belong, but I know I nothing to give, when there's nothing left to give Long ago I heard your sweet sweet song and oh I\n\n12.\n\nlude #3 00:31\n\n13.\n\nFollow Your Heart 04:27\n\nFollow Your Heart Is it any wonder a river finds the sea Is it any wonder you dream a world and it comes to be Is it any wonder the sea of love hiding in me has come alive Is it any wonder your river flows and becomes a life Follow your heart into the dreams that guide you and you will find your way Follow your heart and if it seems to blind you then close your eyes and say I have no fear Follow your heart This feeling that I'm under is all I want and more So is it any wonder you dream of showers and rain will pour Is it any wonder where once a heart felt so insecure is now complete Is it any wonder that loves as strong as your lips are sweet Follow your heart into the dreams that guide you and you will find your way Follow your heart and if it seems to blind you then close your eyes and say I have no fear no no no Follow your heart\n\n14.\n\nSanctuary 05:11\n\nSanctuary In an ageless dream where love is pure and true I escape to you, my sanctuary Loving you in silence, mmm Knowing that it's right Under your gaze should a storm arise Unbothered by the chaos swirling 'round outside In a place where just your face is all I see Where the love we make intoxicates intensively In a mirror where your sweet reflection used to be there is hope, there is joy, there is sanctuary We've found our sanctuary in a never-ending kiss You give me sanctuary and my soul has found a place to peacefully exist Sanctuary yeah and nothing compares to this I'll be your sanctuary Sanctuary We perform a sacred ritual right there in the dark A sacrificial offering of my fidelity A solemn oath of faithfulness I give to thee down at your feet The reassurance in your rhythm, hesitation disappears As you scream my name over and over like a prayer Out of shadows in the dark I open up and you are there touching me deep, so deep in my sanctuary We've found our sanctuary in a never-ending kiss You give me sanctuary and my soul has found a place to peacefully exist Sanctuary yeah and nothing compares to this I'll be your sanctuary Passion fascination sweet serenity grow unmolested in my garden Mango and nectarine sweet honeydew and all you give to me, ooh I love the taste of you We've found our sanctuary in a never-ending kiss You give me sanctuary and my soul has found a place to peacefully exist Sanctuary yeah and nothing compares to this I'll be your sanctuary In a place where just your face is all I see Where the love we make intoxicates intensively In a mirror where your sweet reflection used to be there is only sanctuary\n\n15.\n\nBuilding Bridges outro 01:01\n\n16."
