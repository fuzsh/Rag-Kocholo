        "text": "Have a listen\n\nA few thoughts\n\nWow, what a difference a Substack Notes post can make. It seems that my comments on the further enshittification of Spotify certainly hit a nerve. For the 300+ new subscribers that joined in the last 3 days, a warm welcome, and a big thanks to all those that liked and restacked the post. This has been my most viral social media post by quite some distance.\n\nAlthough it focussed on Spotify I'm guessing it blew up because sadly they're not alone - Amazon, Google, Meta, Tik Tok, subscription based everything, inbuilt obsolescence, the gig economy, the list goes on. Luckily, despite the internet being slowly strangled by a few too big to jail or care monopolies, it’s still a borderless, free space where ideas and idealism have space to grow and flourish, albeit in the shadows of the giants.\n\nBandcamp, newsletter platforms, Duck Duck Go, Signal, Discord servers, Firefox, Soundcloud’s genuinely artist-centric model, Protonmail, Mastodon and Bluesky, have all sprung up to give us options away from the algorithms and surveillance capitalism. It’s time for some digital detoxification and disenshittification, and luckily we still have a choice.\n\nI know reading the news just once in the morning like you used to and ignoring the comments section, disconnecting from your friends and favourite show offs on social media and changing email addresses is a hassle and seems as daunting as changing your bank account or moving house, but after a bit of initial unease life goes on, and if it does without you willingly feeding the machine and in a more ethical, private way then the sense of wellbeing will soon outway the sense of loss or missing out.\n\nNow let’s get back to the music.\n\nRather like house and techno, most of dubstep’s early producers were young lads without much production experience, but they knew their reggae, had a vision and raw energy. Shackleton was always deeper, having played in live bands before immersing himself in machine music, his productions were more refined, better produced and prone to fusion; his tunes compared to your average dubstep banger were what deep house was to rave - they catered for your hips and your head.\n\nThen after a few years he seemingly got fed up with the scene, the fusions became wilder, the experimentation started daring you to follow, vocals became more prominent and some LPs eschewed the dancefloor entirely. Everytime he drops and LP I listen start to finish, but I have to admit I was hitting repeat less and less - a lot of it just wasn't quite my cup of tea, although he never lost my respect for a moment.\n\nThis last year has seen him collaborating more and with some highly unexpected names, I'm still in shock he released an LP with Six Organs of Admittance a few weeks back, I mean how did that even happen?! Well here he is again with a new collaboration and it’s something of a TSMM dream team as dub deviants Holy Tongueare his new partners in crime.\n\nHoly Tongue are percussionist Valentina Magaletti and producer Al Wootton and I was smitten from their first EP - live, bass heavy jams with all the right effects plus some twists, a bit of post punk attitude and some late night moodiness without being oppressive.\n\nFrom a personal perspective they’ve also been a good influence on Shackleton, as I guess they laid down a more recognisable dub framework before sending it to Shackleton to augment in his studio rather than letting his imagination run wild from the offset. This is an album you can skank to, though it’s more Adrian Sherwood than King Tubby.\n\nThe riddims are a mixture of the righteous, ritualistic & downtempo waywardness, and apart from Magaletti’s percussion who know’s who did what? The soundscapes are dense with plenty for the hi-fi/headphone crew to explore. Free jazz gets a look in, unindentified spectral vocals haunt the soundscapes, the Fourth World’s most forgotten corners are explored and aired - their dwellers encouraged to unite and fight, as familiar instruments jockey with abstract electronics and sound sources unknown. It’s dense, intense and right up my twisted, forward looking dub street.\n\nNeed more dub?\n\nThere’s a TSMM playlist for that. Check out some classic JA vibes, low frequency evolution & bass mutations from the dub continuum in the Slow Dub Playlist. Available on Tidal, Apple Music, Youtube, Youtube Music, Deezer, Soundcloud and Spotify (if you must).\n\nHave a listen\n\nA few brief thoughts...\n\nAfter starting to explore the world of jazz a bit more seriously around '95, I quickly started to catch up on what had been happening in the last fourty years, and at the same time immersed myself in London's, Nu-Jazz heyday. It was a heady time for the forward looking black music lover. Monday nights at Bar Rumba for Gilles Peterson's weekly, The Jazz Cafe in Camden, Plastic People in Shoreditch and Sunday nights at Brixton's Bug Bar; all regular haunts where classic jazz dance and rare groove rubbed shoulders with beat science, the sounds of Brazil were never far away and Fela said hello to underground hip hop. It was a fine time to be alive.\n\nRoll on 30 years and if I'm in the mood for a jazz moment I'll generally, with a few notable new millenial exceptions, dig out my old Flying Dutchman or Impulse albums rather than listen to artists trying to replicate the sounds of the greats and a long gone golden era. In 2024 I want new generation twists, oddball blends in this golden age of fusion and electronic experimentation.\n\nI stumbled across Lyberachelulo a couple of years ago when he released his Train Chimes Climb the Attic Charter album, which somehow managed to join the dots between field recording rich ambient jazz and the snappily entitled monster groove - \"Collapsed Castle in the Woods with Flying Saucers\", which I had on repeat for weeks. Well last week he dropped WyndSpring his sophomore LP and I'm happy to report it's similarly adventurous and just as well crafted.\n\nA rudimentary bamboo marimba made by director of operations Andrew Gibbens is the thread that ties the tracks together. Gibbens then kicked things off by recording a plethora of percussion, alongside Rhodes and bass, in response to the sustained winds blowing through East Tennessee - now there's a conductor. He then enlisted some familiar names from the debut alongside some new recruits to flesh out his framework. The ensuing meteorlogical jazz joys stretch from gusting spaced out jazz rock all the way to becalmed, folkier, new age cloud gazers, largely eschewing grooviness for a more whimsical low gravity approach to better catch the air currents. Start at the start and get off at the last stop.\n\nNext up is ØKSE who I only stumbled across last week but am already eagerly anticipating their sophomore. It's an international crew: NYC based drummer Savannah Harris, Danish saxophonist Mette Rasmussen, Haitian electronic musician Val Jeanty, and Swede Petter Eldh on bass, synths and sampler - rear view mirror gazing this isn't; hard grooving it certainly is. This is take no prisoners, railing against the machine, hard out jazz with sweat coming through the speakers, if they rock up at a venue near you get your ticket early.\n\nIf that wasn't enough they've invited four rappers - ELUCID, billy woods, Maassai and Cavalier along for the ride, and whoever handed out the invites knows their shit or lives in Brooklyn. All of them have the swagger and personality to ride the bumping beats, clattering drums & nu-jazz punk attitude. Despite Maassai having a more, albeit saying something soulful moment, the band don't give her an easy ride for a moment.\n\nTSMM is usually more chilling than illing, but if you've let you're digital detox slip, doom scrolled one depressing headline too many and find yourself sick to the teeth of the handful of rich and powerful men swinging their tiny dicks about and making life unpleasant for everyone else, then switch off your phone, hit play on this LP and let it all out. The ambient escapism and Balearic balminess will be here waiting for you tomorrow.\n\nHead over to the Slow Jazz Playlist for more, forward looking, independent jazz eclecticism\n\nYou can listen to the playlist on various streaming services - just click here.\n\nPlease note that if you listen on Spotify, with their new (de)monetization policy many of the artists recommended by TSMM will receive just a fraction, and in some cases no remuneration from your plays, with the money being redirected to more popular/commercial artists. If you want to be 100% sure you are supporting the artists you are listening to then Tidal & Apple Music pay much better rates & don't divert money away from the artists you are a fan of.\n\nHave a listen\n\nA few brief thoughts...\n\nLike a lot of vinyl DJs starting out I loved a compilation. I could stand behind the decks on the shoulders of some serious selectors and pretend to musical sophistication beyond my years and budget, not to mention four or five good compilations in the bag meant I didn't have to take a second heavy bag across London that night.\n\nI guess these handy collections started to lose their allure for me about twenty years ago. After finally paying my dues in bars, clubs, shops and at car boot sales, most of the selections just weren't as enlightening and the rookie collection gaps had long been filled. There was also a growing desire to present my own hard dug obscure gems, up front white labels and overlooked B-sides to an audience, and differentiate myself from the compilation reliant newbies.\n\nObviously there are always exceptions to the rule. There are some seriously sick diggers with sagging floorboards & stories to tell; labels that have prised open the doors to previously locked vaults, storage units or buried master tapes, and obsessives from odd places with an ear for a tune and serious local knowledge that can only be gleaned with feet on the ground rather than via the internet.\n\nThis collection of wonderfully coined \"sigh-chedelic\" music unearthed by Charles Bals for the ever interesting Smiling C label, falls into category one and possibly three. I imagine a few of the tracks were from private press vinyl and tapes which rarely appear in your average record shop, so private dealers must be solicited, flea markets, garage sales and bric a brac stores must be scoured and America, due to its size, always has more of everything.\n\nThe world of private press primarily existed for reasons of artistic vanity and the fact that most of the music was so bad a label wouldn't go anywhere near it, and although these tracks are unfailingly great, I’m guessing the albums weren’t start to finish listens. So extra kudos and respect must also go to Bals, not only for his tireless searching, but the extra listening effort required to unearth the gems on this LP - of which there are many, and which focusses on the dying embers of folk rock's golden age.\n\nOne of the joys of this era for me is the regular use of vintage drum machines by these often one man (where were the women?) bands. Despite demanding today's programmed drums have variation, breakdowns and swing, I find real joy in those old school, unrelenting, metronomic sounds. Obviously a bit of melodic layering is also welcome and these lone bedroom troubadours are full of earnest AOR and stoned singer songwriter vocals, vintage synthesizer flourishes, soulful undertones and cosmic country vibes. The feel is real.\n\nSo if you don't mind a bit of borderline cheese, vibe on vintage lo-fi, like a bit of raw artistic endeavour, are aware of Numero Group or appreciate that even Toto had their deeper moments then you'll enjoy this fine compilation.\n\nHave a listen\n\nA Few Brief Thoughts\n\nElkhorn are Jesse Sheppard and Drew Gardner, a couple of freakwheelin' guitarists who've been floating around the TSMM blog, playlists & auditory cortex for a while now. Hailing from New York, they've been developing an impressive line in psychedelic folk rock that explores those cosmic backwaters that are increasingly obscured by today's VC controlled corporate blandness, constantly tickles your serotonin receptors to help lift the social media fog and has a hippy trail honouring spiritual dimension that offers hope for the future, if only enough people tune in and turn on.\n\nThe LP comes on a bit stronger at the start to sort out the heads from the chino wearers, before gradually mellowing and becoming more mystical as it unhurriedly evolves; overdubbed layer by layer with perfectly judged, familiar and further flung instrumental patterns that you're average San Francisco septuagenarian would surely approve of. If their multi-instrumental ability wasn't enough they've even dragged in fellow tripper Jesse Sparhawk to add some pedal steel and lever harp depth to the already rich tapestry.\n\nDig out the vape or dust off the bong depending on your age and let your freak folk flag fly.\n\nWhat The Release Notes Say\n\nDebut standalone VHF LP by the Elkhorn duo of Drew Gardner and Jesse Sheppard, a tight set of six studio recordings in a variety of moods and featuring a lot of new sound textures. Elkhorn’s prolific stream of releases since 2016 has highlighted their mastery of sprawling long-form, acoustic-driven hypno-jams, with an emphasis on live performance (including on their collaboration with Pelt’s Mike Gangloff on the Shackamaxon Concert LP). The Red Valley is a more layered and composed-sounding set, with the duo overdubbing extensively on top of their own dual guitars. Leading off the LP, “Crystal Hummingbird” features one of their signature minor-modal vamps, with layers of fuzz bass, zither, and frame drum providing weight and psychedelic density. “Gray Salt Trail” continues the vibe, with thick fuzz vibraphone supplementing the cinematic palate, leading into the spare side-closer “Black Wind of Kayenta, where Sheppard plays electric 12-string and Gardner solos on acoustic guitar.\n\nSide two starts with “Road to Chaco Canyon,” a brooding duet that builds momentum with Gardner’s insistent frame drum cadence, dropping down into the quiet string pool of “Inside Spider Rock” (featuring Fern Knight’s Jesse Sparhawk on gloriously swirling lever harp) and the graceful finale “Jackrabbit Hops.” Pressed in Chicago by Smashed Plastic, first edition on pink vinyl.

Fear not though, I'm up for the challenge as the project has come so far and to be honest I'd feel a bit lost without it. I just hope if you're a Substack follower that you switch your phone off when sleeping as there are going to be a few late night deliveries.\n\nMoving forward I think one solution is to revert back more often to the pithy paragraphs of old when recommending a release rather than my recent long form efforts which admittedly I struggle with, although I'm finding it an interesting exercise in analysing my attachment to music for a change rather than just vibin' off it. It's also a useful further exercise in trying to develop my writing skills and help justify my existence on Substack, although just a few paragraphs take me far too long to cobble together.\n\nSaying all that, I'm four paragraphs in and the clock has already struck midnight, the alarm is set for 3AM and I haven't even mentioned Old Amica's new exploration of the ambient condition yet. This shy Swede has been making ambient music for over a decade now and decided to stretch out a bit on this new LP for the ever reliable Dronarivm. Radio waves charge the air; drones abound as voices, field recordings & instruments come and go as they please; organs and the spirits of classical composers haunt the soundscapes making it a generally stately affair, but a couple of tracks have an almost (rather welcome) lullaby feel to them and there's even some zero gravity dream pop floating around. Sink in, I think you'll enjoy it.\n\nWhat The Release Notes Say\n\n\"För alltid\" is an album about time. The fuzzy & shapeless memories floating without coherence. Shortwave radio recordings picking up unbroken codes from the past. Hopeful voices whispering about a possible future from a hopeless now.\n\nCREDITS\n\nWritten, recorded and mixed by Old Amica.\n\nLena Malmborg and Daniel Johansson sang with us on “Mot natten” and Lina Högström played violin on ”Neckar”.\n\nHilma & My told us about the future.\n\nMastered by James Edward Armstrong.\n\nCover by J.M Almqvist.\n\nYou can also find Old Amica in the\n\nAmbient Pop Playlist\n\nYou can listen to the playlist on various streaming services - just click here.\n\nPlease note that if you listen on Spotify, with their new (de)monetization policy many of the artists recommended by TSMM will receive just a fraction, and in some cases no remuneration from your plays, with the money being redirected to more popular/commercial artists. If you want to be 100% sure you are supporting the artists you are listening to then Tidal & Apple Music pay much better rates & don't divert money away from the artists you are a fan of.\n\nHave a listen...\n\nA Few Brief Thoughts\n\ncurious jazz drummer and an experimental guitarist with a fondness for routing his instrument though reality tunnel expanding effects is not always going to end well for the average listener. Certainly Krononaut's 2020 debut LP with a larger ensemble was often a more agitated & provocative affair.\n\nRoll on four years and the storied Martin France and Leo Abrahams are back in the studio with instruments set to cruise and eschewing outside help so there is no external static interfering with their fluid telepathic communication. Even the ghosts of the 20th century jazz greats have been left in the control room to look, learn and wonder how cosmic exploration has advanced in the last fifty years.\n\nFrance opts for a textural percussive approach, encouraging rather than driving Abrahams on whilst placing the odd piton for him to swing round and sustain their gentle momentum - there are still spacetime ripples to surf after all and unobservable space is surely close? Abrahams for his part gets busy seeding ambient electronic clouds, lighting the duo's universal paths with gently probing guitar lines, whilst not forgetting to litter their meandering paths with twinkling notes in case they need to find their way back to this troubled planet.\n\nAmbient space rock, ethereal improv', zero gravity cosmic jazz - call this album what you will, it's a start to finish universally attuned joy and has been on repeat all afternoon and evening, but what makes this album even more remarkable is that there were no overdubs or post processing involved, it’s a session and a half. Perhaps improvisation and experimental music aren't so bad after all?\n\nWhat The Release Notes Say\n\nLeo Abrahams: guitar, production, mix\n\nMartin France: drums\n\nMastering: Michal Kupicz\n\nArtwork: Anna Hepler\n\nLayout: Anisa Sabiri\n\nPlaylist Action\n\nDon’t forget to check the playlists which are now also available on Amazon Music as well as Tidal, Apple Music, Spotify (if you must), Deezer, Soundcloud, Youtube & Youtube Music.\n\nAmbient House, Ambient Pop, End of Week Freak, Ambient, Balearic, Dub, Folk, Grooves, Instrumental Hip Hop Beats, Indie Folk & Folky Singer Songwriters, Jazz, Neoclassical, Alt-Pop, Psyche, Soul, Slowtronica, World Music, New Age of New Age or a celebration of Women in Ambient Music.
