        "text": "April Program Titles Released This Week:\n\nSteve Earle And The Dukes – GUY CD/LP (New West)\n\nSteve Earle was 19 and had just hitchhiked from San Antonio to Nashville in 1974. Back then if you wanted to be where the best songwriters were, you had to be in there. Guy Clark had moved to Nashville and if you were from Texas, Guy Clark was king. A few years later, Steve would be playing bass guitar in Guy’s band and flying high on what would become an indelible friendship of like-minded musicians who bonded in a kinship of stories told through song. In the fall of 2018, Steve and The Dukes went into House Of Blues studio in Nashville and recorded his tribue to Guy Clark, GUY, in six days. “I wanted it to sound live…When you’ve got a catalog like Guy’s and you’re only doing sixteen tracks, you know each one is going to be strong.” Earle and his current, perhaps best-ever Dukes lineup take on Clark’s songs with a spirit of reverent glee and invention. The tunes are all over the place and so is the band, offering max energy on such disparate entries as the bluegrass rave-up “Sis Draper” and the talking blues memoir of “Texas 1947”. Earle’s raw vocal on the sweet, sad “That Old Time Feeling” is heartbreaking, sounding close enough to the grave as to be doing a duet with his late friend and mentor.\n\nFree Throw – What’s Past Is Prologue CD/LP (Triple Crown)\n\nAfter two studio albums and nearly seven years as a band, Free Throw is making a significant change to their identity. The group – who has sung openly of personal struggles related to substance abuse and body image – holds nothing back on What’s Past Is Prologue, their third full length record. Past releases may have provided small glimpses into Free Throw’s history as a band and personal lives outside of music, but What’s Past Is Prologue is the group at their most forthcoming. The album’s 12 tracks detail the continuing mental health struggles of lead singer Cory Castro and serve as a complete story of what happens when you decide that everything in your life needs to change. As Castro explains, the record is split into two parts. The first half of explores the weight of personal blame, with singles – including the gunning and practically unstoppable “Tail Whip, Struggle” and the limitless, swaying tenderness of “Stay Out Of The Basement” – setting the stage for an impactful finale. As the album nears its conclusion, “Today Is Especially Delicious” provides a tumultuous turning point, with the band tearing through Castro’s shouted confession: “Is this what I had planned for my life/I need a hand of some type to pull me up and break this cycle of drinking for breakfast.”\n\nGarcia Peoples – Natural Facts CD/LP+MP3 (Beyond Beyond Is Beyond)\n\nConsider Natural Facts by Garcia Peoples to be your heady, friendly reminder that it’s alright to let the sunshine in. The second album in less than a year from those lovable New Jersey moptops with the sweet twin guitars, Natural Facts provides a portal to the carefree place that both indie rock and jam bands forgot, and a handy alternative to whatever you may need an alternative from. Danny Arakaki and Tom Malach’s guitars remain at centerstage on machine gun shreds like the album-opening “Feel So Great” and the rolling grooves of “High Noon Violence” (which would fit right in with one of David Crosby’s early ‘70s studio supergroups). Natural Facts isn’t a throwback, as much as Garcia Peoples sometimes accidentally sound like a band one might stumble into at New York’s late Wetlands Preserve in the mid-‘90s. Rather, it’s a newly emerging conversation, songs and structures and solos and duos drawing from the latest and most right-on musicians to cross Garcia Peeps’ collective transom. The classic rock guitarists of yore might be obvious subsequent touchstones, but bend your ear and newer colors emerge, generated from hours and years of talk and music.\n\nBeth Gibbons – Henryk Górecki: Symphony No. 3 CD/CD+DVD/LP+MP3/LP+DVD+MP3 (Domino)\n\nPerformed by Beth Gibbons and the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra, Henryk Górecki: Symphony No. 3 (Symphony Of Sorrowful Songs) was conducted by Krzysztof Penderecki at The National Opera Grand Theater in Warsaw on November 29th 2014, and was part of an evening of programming that also featured Jonny Greenwood’s (Radiohead) 48 Responses To Polymorphia and the world premiere of Bryce Dessner’s (The National) Réponse Lutosławski. Following an invitation to collaborate at the concert, Gibbons undertook an intense preparation process, including tackling the challenge of learning the original text (and the emotional weight it carries) without speaking the mother language. Typical to Beth though –the elusive yet iconic frontwoman of one of the most important British bands of the last two decades – the challenge was met and exceeded. Her performance alongside the maestro Krysztof Penderecki has been hailed as triumphant, as you can hear on this release. [Deluxe CD and vinyl editions add a copy of the performance on DVD.]\n\nI Prevail – Trauma CD/LP (Concord)\n\n“Gold-certified Michigan quartet I Prevail not only redefine themselves on their sophomore offering, Trauma but they also redefine the genre for tomorrow’s generation. Brian Burkheiser [clean vocals], Eric Vanlerberghe [harsh vocals], Steve Menoian [lead guitar], and Dylan Bowman [rhythm guitar] are flipping the script and recharging the genre in order to usher it forward. Trauma is uplifting and rocks to a plateau where soundscapes can unpredictably toss and turn between heavy metal, alternative, hip-hop, and electronic moods without any rules and take it to a new level. Vulnerable, vital, and visceral, the 15-track opus illuminates the future—and it’s as bright and bold as each anthem is.” – Ignite Music\n\nJourney – Escape & Frontiers – Live In Japan 2xCD+DVD/2xDVD+Blu-ray (Eagle Rock Entertainment)\n\nIn February 2017, Journey went to Japan for a special show at Tokyo’s Budokan that featured a complete performance of 1981’s Escape and 1983’s Frontiers at the request of legendary Japanese concert promoter Mr. Udo in honor of his 50th anniversary in the business. “There’s a few songs I don’t even recall playing, like [the Frontiers track] ‘Troubled Child’,” Journey guitarist Neal Schon told Rolling Stone at the time. “Digging back into that stuff has been a lot of fun.” Live In Japan 2017: Escape + Frontiers features many of Journey’s most enduring songs, including “Don’t Stop Believin’”, “Faithfully”, “Separate Ways”, and “Open Arms” as well as deep cuts such as “Lay It Down” and “Back Talk” that the band hadn’t attempted to perform in decades. [Stand-alone DVD and Blu-ray editions are also available.]\n\nYngwie Malmsteen – Blue Lightning CD/2xLP+MP3 (Mascot Label Group)\n\nOnly a few guitarists are known by only their first name. Yngwie is one of them. With Blue Lightning, Yngwie Malmsteen highlights not only his enduring dexterity and diversity, but also pays homage to those from the blues and rock worlds who have fueled his artistic spirit for so long. Anyone who is expecting Malmsteen to copy exactly the way the original versions sound is in for a shock. Because that is not what he has done here. He has masterfully transformed classics like “Smoke On The Water”, “Purple Haze” and “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” into his own inimitable style, and wrote and recorded four new tracks for the album to boot. [Deluxe CD ddition adds two bonus tracks (not available on the regular CD), and Yngwie-themed coasters, a sticker, a postcard and a guitar pick. Limited blue colored vinyl pressing featuring two bonus tracks also available].\n\nMekons – Deserted CD/LP (Bloodshot)\n\nEmboldened by a sold-out tour and a surge of interest in the States after the release of the documentary Revenge Of The Mekons, Mekons retreated to the fringes of Joshua Tree National Park and popular culture to record their new album Deserted. The long-running, genre-hopping, impossible-to-kill British folk-punk collective summoned the forces of magic, fear and superstition for an album of shifting sand Sturm und Drang. It is at once a distorted howl into the emptiness of space as well as a quiet submission to the shimmering allure of a mirage. The heat and endless horizon can lead to madness or clarity, and while there is relief when the sun goes down you know the deep chill is not far off.\n\nChris Quelle – Guns CD/2xLP (Mello Music Group)\n\n“Over the years, the Detroit-raised, Brooklyn-based rapper and producer Quelle Chris has become one of the most thoughtful, inventive, bugged-out forces on the rap underground” (Stereogum). Quelle’s new album, Guns, features contributions from Jean Grae, Mach-Hommy, Denmark Vessey, and Bilal Salaam, among others. “Guns is an arsenal of both sounds, styles and subjects. At its core it’s about things that can be weaponized for good or evil, including ourselves. The words we say, what we fear, how we love, how we live, what we ingest, what we believe in, who we idolize, sh*t like that. Somewhat a sonic study of the question “do ‘guns kill people or do people kill people?” I never start an album the same way, but one constant is I try to forget about everything I made before and do something different. Because I’m a fan too and I like hearing new things. I’d say we accomplished that with Guns. My goal with this and all albums is to create pieces people can enjoy, start to finish, for decades to come.” – Quelle Chris\n\nShow Me The Body – Dog Whistle CD/LP (Loma Vista)\n\n“New York hardcore trio Show Me The Body released their impressive debut album Body War back in 2016, followed by their Corpus I mixtape in 2017. The lead single from their sophomore album Dog Whistle ‘Camp Orchestra’ opens with a gloomy, creeping bassline and delicate riffing. It strays from the sludgy noise SMTB are known for, but the melody builds toward a fiery explosion before you have time to question it, complete with frontman Julian Cashwan Pratt’s signature muffled bark. The song was inspired by a visit to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland. Its title references the Jewish orchestra groups that were formed in concentration camps during World War II” (Stereogum). “This album and our music does not belong to a political party,” Show Me The Body said in a statement. “No authority, political movement, or side may claim the function of our music in this society. This album is personal. It is about and for the disenfranchised youth of this city, of this country, and of this earth. It is for our community and anyone who may find shelter within it.”\n\nSon Volt – Union CD/LP (Transmit Sound)\n\nJay Farrar channels folk music’s enduring legacy of the troubadour on Son Volt’s ninth studio album, Union. “There are so many forces driving our country apart,” observes Farrar. “What can we do to bring our society back together?” Initially intended to be an entirely political statement, Union morphed into a combination of politically inspired material balanced by a cluster of new songs reflecting the power of love, time and music that sustains us. “While Rome Burns” emphasizes finding unity during times of turmoil while an album highlight, “Devil May Care”, offers the distraction we need, an effusive tribute to the fun of playing and creating music. A unique aspect of Union is that eight of the thirteen songs were recorded at places associated with two figures in American history whom Farrar considers important – labor and community organizer Mary Harris “Mother Jones” and iconic folk hero Woody Guthrie. The album features long time band members Mark Spencer (piano, organ, acoustic slide, lap steel, backing vocals) Andrew DuPlantis (bass, backing vocals), returning member Chris Frame (guitar), as well as newest member Mark Patterson on drums and percussion. [Indie-store exclusive vinyl edition is available.]\n\nThe Strumbellas – Rattlesnake CD/LP (Glassnote)\n\nRattlesnake is the fourth studio album from The Strumbellas, a six-piece collective who rocketed to success with the breakthrough hit “Spirits”. For the group, which consists of Simon Ward (lead vocals/guitar), David Ritter (keys), Jeremy Drury (percussion), Isabel Ritchie (strings), Jon Hembrey (guitar) and Darryl James (bass), Rattlesnake marks a stylistic turn from their melancholy, introspective releases. While staying true to their roots, the band has delivered an album that elicits the feelings of joy and the promise of hope. “A lot of our music is known for being dark,” says Ritter. “I like that people can turn to our music in dark times, but we were interested in seeing whether we could make something a little more hopeful and positive. I think the song has a more positive feel than our previous stuff.” Lead single “Salvation” is a decidedly notable pivot towards pop for The Strumbellas, which describes itself as a primarily “country, folky band.” But they also explain that they’re “pop music junkies,” and that their catalog has been edging towards an increasingly accessible sound from the start.\n\nUncle Walt’s Band – Uncle Walt’s Band CD/LP (Omnivore)\n\nUncle Walt’s Band, originally from Spartanburg, S.C., was an eclectic music trio that moved to Nashville in 1972 and, shortly thereafter, to Austin at the urging of singer/songwriter Willis Alan Ramsey. An attempt at an album with Ramsey at the helm was unsuccessful, so the band headed back to Spartanburg in 1974 to produce their own debut LP, Blame It On The Bossa Nova. The original self-released vinyl edition – 1,000 copies sold through performances and self-promotion – disappeared quickly. Heat was gaining for the band, so they headed back down to Austin with a reissue of the album, simply titled Uncle Walt’s Band. While the album gained many fans and followers, it wasn’t enough to sustain the band’s larger ambitions. “Walter Hyatt, David Ball and Champ Hood have been an inspiration to me ever since the first time I heard Uncle Walt’s Band,” says Lyle Lovett, a journalism student at Texas A&M University at the time of its original release. “Musically, their finely crafted original compositions reflect diverse influences, while lyrically they demonstrate a sensitive, sophisticated understanding of the dignified South.\n\nVitimas – Something Wicked Marches In CD (Season Of Mist)\n\nVltimas (pronounced Ultimas), the new band featuring Rune “Blasphemer” Eriksen (Mayhem, Aura Noir), David Vincent (Morbid Angel) and Flo Mounier (Cryptopsy) –who are responsible for some of the most legendary and groundbreaking death and black metal albums of all time – unleash their powerhouse debut album Something Wicked Marches In. A behemoth of death metal extremity, the nine-track slab sees these titans bring their prodigious talents to bear on a commanding synthesis of their storied histories. Vltimas is nothing short of extreme metal royalty, and Something Wicked Marches In is a forceful statement of intent.\n\nWhitechapel – The Valley CD/LP (Metal Blade)\n\nSince their 2007 debut, The Somatic Defilement, Whitechapel’s output has been mired in darkness, but they have never inhabited blacker territory than on their seventh full-length, The Valley. “Lyrically, emotionally, melody wise, there are not many ‘happy’ sounding parts on this record,” states guitarist Alex Wade. “Our last album, Mark Of The Blade (2016) did not sound exactly ‘happy’ either, but the majority of those songs did not have much emotion or vibe behind them, they were just straightforward metal songs. These songs have a darker, more melancholic presentation to them.” The valley of the title relates to the part of Hardin Valley, west of Knoxville, TN, where vocalist Phil Bozeman grew up. Set against this backdrop, he approaches the hardships of his childhood unflinchingly, building upon everything that came before, making it clear that he has survived that which he was forced to endure and is not afraid to confront it. “It’s all about me as a child, and some of it is me looking back on that time from the perspective of now,” he explains. [Indie-store exclusive colored vinyl edition also available.]\n\nCDs + Vinyl:\n\n2Chainz – Rap Or Go To The League CD (Def Jam)\n\n2Chainz’ fifth album features guest appearances from Ariana Grande, Chance the Rapper, E-40, Kendrick Lamar, Kodak Black, Lil Wayne, Marsha Ambrosius, Travis Scott, Ty Dolla Sign, and Young Thug. Production is handled by a variety of producers, including 9th Wonder, Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E., Mike Dean, Mustard, Pharrell Williams, Terrace Martin, and WondaGurl, among others, and it is executive produced by LeBron James.\n\nA New Revenge – Enemies & Lovers CD/LP (Golden Robot)\n\nNew album from the supergroup comprised of Tim ‘Ripper’ Owens (Judas Priest, Iced Earth and Yngwie Malmsteen), guitarist Keri Kelli (Slash’s Snake Pit, Alice Cooper, Vince Neil Band), bass player Rudy Sarzo (Ozzy Osbourne, Dio, Whitesnake) and longtime Scorpions drummer James Kottak (also from Montrose, Warrant, Kingdom Come & more).\n\nArrival Of Autumn – Harbinger CD (Nuclear Blast America)\n\nSecond album from the Canadian metal upstarts.\n\nBackyard Babies – Sliver & Gold CD (M-Theory Audio)\n\nFor 30 years, Backyard Babies has delivered top of the line rock ‘n’ roll. [Vinyl edition due April 12.]\n\nBananarama – Deep Sea Skiving [Reissue/1983] CD/LP+CD (London)\n\nBananarama – Bananarama [Reissue/1984] CD/LP+CD (London)\n\nBananarama – True Confessions [Reissue/1986] CD/LP+CD (London)\n\nBananarama – Wow! [Reissue/1987] CD/LP+CD (London)\n\nBananarama – Pop Life [Reissue/1991] CD/LP+CD (London)\n\nBananarama – Please Yourself [Reissue/1993] CD/LP+CD (London)\n\nCD and colored vinyl reissues of UK pop band’s first six albums. Bananarama helped define the ’80s with their run of pop hits and are often cited as the UK’s most successful ever girl group with five UK singles and ten Top 10s.\n\nThe Beta Machine – Intruder CD/LP (T-Boy/UMe)\n\nBased in Los Angeles, The Beta Machine’s McJunkins and Friedl are well known for their roles in the rhythm section of A Perfect Circle. The two first rubbed shoulders when they auditioned for Ashes Divide, led by A Perfect Circle’s Billy Howerdel. Recognizing a powerful creative bond that went beyond that band’s ranks, the duo was soon asked to join Puscifer, led by Tool frontman and APC co-founder Maynard James Keenan. Their associations still extend far beyond that cluster of bands: to Filter, Devo, Thirty Seconds to Mars, and Eagles of Death Metal. Friedl and McJunkins would take material incompatible with their other collaborations and stow it away for then-mysterious future use. [Limited colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nBhi Bhiman – Peace Of Mind CD/LP (Boocoo Music)\n\nBhi Bhiman is an American singer/songwriter and producer. He’s garnered critical acclaim and collaborated with creative powerhouses like Boots Riley, Rhiannon Giddens, and the late Chris Cornell. His latest album, Peace Of Mind, features a mix of psychedelic rock, pop and folk topped with a modern/electronic production style.\n\nTim Bluhm – Sorta Surviving CD/LP (Blue Rose Music)\n\nA gentle departure from his usual California-soul sound of The Mother Hips, Sorta Surviving finds vocalis/guitarist Tim Bluhm living out his classic country musical dreams. Produced by Widespread Panic’s Dave Schools and anchored by all-star band members Jesse Aycock (guitar, vocals) and Jason Crosby (piano, violin, organ), and Nashville session legends Gene Chrisman (drums) and David Roe (bass), Bluhm’s new album was recorded at Cash Cabin Studios in Hendersonville, TN.\n\nGraham Bonney – Thank You Baby The Complete UK Pop Singles & More 1965-1970 CD Teensville)\n\nThe first-ever compilation of English-sung recordings by Graham Bonney. Thank You Baby compiles the A and B sides of his fourteen UK singles from 1965-1970 and includes tracks from his rare debut LP, Supergirl (1966). Bonney surrounded himself with top notch producers, arrangers and sessions players.\n\nBrutus – Nest CD/LP+MP3 (Sargent House)\n\n11 tracks that cast a net over post-rock, hardcore, metal and pop.\n\nBetty Carter – The Music Never Stops CD (Blue Engine)\n\nThis live performance at New York’s Aaron Davis Hall was recorded in 1992, six years before Carter’s untimely passing and during the early days of Jazz At Lincoln Center. The Music Never Stops marks Carter’s first posthumous album as well as the artist’s first release composed entirely of previously unheard material in 22 years. [Vinyl edition due May 17.]\n\nChai – Punk CD (Burger/Otemoyan)\n\nChai is an adventure where all-things are pink, a sound that fuses the likings of Basement Jaxx, CSS, and Tom Tom Club, lyrics catered to self-empowerment and re-defining the definition of kawaii or cute, and indescribably fun visuals that’ll absorb you whole. [Vinyl and cassette editions due April 12.]\n\nChat Noir – Hyperuranion CD/LP (RareNoise)\n\nIn Plato’s vision of the universe, the Hyperuranion is a realm of ideal forms where the soul waits before entering the body, inspiring humanity’s search for truth and beauty on Earth. On their seventh release, the exploratory trio Chat Noir conjures their own Hyperuranion, a transcendent space beyond genre where electronica, rock, jazz, and ambient music meld into a rapturous hybrid.\n\nChoosey & Exile – Black Beans CD/2xLP (Dirty Science)\n\nBetween gospel music in church and his grandfather’s role in the Latin Jazz scene of Los Angeles, music has always been a factor in Choosey’s lineage. With four years passing since his debut Left Field, Choosey makes his long-awaited return with Black Beans, an album conveying the less represented perspective of growing up Afro-Chicano.\n\nChris Cohen – Chris Cohen CD/LP (Captured Tracks)\n\nChris Cohen’s songs initially sound easy. They’re each tiny jewels that unfurl at a leisurely pace, but dig a little deeper and you’ll reach a melancholy core. His previous two albums – 2012’s Overgrown Path and 2016’s As If Apart – were built from lush, blurry tracks that embedded themselves in your subconscious, like they’d always been there. Chris Cohen, his eponymous third solo album, is a thoughtful, accomplished meditation on life and family, backed by dusky instrumentation influenced by the late evening beauty of Pat Metheny’s Falcon And The Snowman soundtrack, and Thomas Dolby’s Golden Age Of Wireless. [Indie-store exclusive Coke bottle clear vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nJohn Coltrane – Coltrane ’58: Prestige Recordings 5xCD/8xLP (Craft Recordings)\n\nThis collection celebrates the 60th anniversary of jazz pioneer John Coltrane’s 1958 recordings for New York based indie jazz label Prestige Records, presented in a complete chronological sequence. The duration of time covered on this box set may be one calendar year, but the rate at which Coltrane’s musical abilities grew-as well as his fanbase-is remarkable. These 37 tracks serve an inspiring listening session revealing all aspects of Coltrane’s approach that year.\n\nEric Copeland – Trogg Modal Vol. 2 CD/LP (DFA)\n\nThe former Black Dice member’s ‘Freakbeat 4/4’ agenda gets further refined here – Vol. 2 is more laid-back than the first, but still highly danceable. Self-described as late Night Flight proto tekno, the tracks pulse with thick layers of percussion, melodic fever dreams, and riffs wrung through a taffy puller.\n\nMark de Clive-Lowe – Heritage CD/LP (Ropeadope)\n\nThe first edition of a two-part series, Heritage finds Mark de Clive-Lowe in the process of grand introspection about his Japanese heritage, with specific tracks as memories from the past illustrating the right history of Japan. The albums have a sweeping, almost majestic feel with signature electronic soundscapes throughout.\n\nDMX – Greatest Hits CD/LP (Cleopatra)\n\nA career retrospective from one of the most dominating rappers in the game. [Limited edition splatter vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nVan Duren – Waiting: The Van Duren Story (Original Documentary Soundtrack) CD/LP (Omnivore)\n\nRecently released on vinyl – now available on CD. Memphis musician Van Duren had it all going for himself. He was managed and produced by Andrew Loog Oldham (The Rolling Stones) in the 1970s, he was a contemporary of Big Star and was in a post-Big Star band (Baker Street Regulars) with Chris Bell and Jody Stephens, and had made a debut album, Are You Serious?, that had some people comparing him to Paul McCartney. But instead of being the next big thing, he faded into obscurity.\n\nBillie Eilish – When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? CD/LP (Darkroom/Interscope)\n\nDebut album from the seventeen-year-old Los Angeles pop songsmith. [Deluxe clamshell CD box edition includes CD, tattoos, sticker sheet poster, and lithos. Super deluxe fan box adds a beanie, shoelaces, and Blohsh glow in dark stars.]\n\nFACS – Lifelike CD/LP (Trouble In Mind)\n\nChicago trio FACS was founded in 2017 by former Disappears members Brian Case & Noah Leger, along with their bandmate Jonathan van Herik. After van Herik amicably parted ways with the group just before their debut album Negative Houses‘s release, Case & Leger recruited longtime friend Alianna Kalaba (Cat Power, We Ragazzi) to play bass. Lifelike is their sophomore release and resides somewhere near the realms of post-punk, art-rock, shoegaze, industrial music and post-rock. [Light blue colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nFennesz – Agora CD (Touch)\n\nAgora is Christian Fennesz’s first solo album since Mahler Remix and Bécs (both released in 2014). He uses guitar and computer to create shimmering, swirling electronic sound of enormous range and complex musicality. His lush and luminous compositions are anything but sterile computer experiments. They resemble sensitive, telescopic recordings of rainforest insect life or natural atmospheric occurrences, an inherent naturalism permeating each piece.\n\nBen Folds – Live At MySpace CD/LP (Real Gone Music)\n\nRecorded in 2007, Live At MySpace features Ben Folds in front of a small audience housed in a custom set built in his home studio in Tennessee. He performed songs from his third and latest solo album, Supersunnyspeedgraphic, as well as a couple of tunes from his previous group, Ben Folds Five. [Limited white colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nGiuda – E.V.A. CD/LP (Burger)\n\nGiuda is a five-piece band from Rome, Italy, that play an air-punching mix of anthemic ‘70s rock hooks delivered with the brutal force of early UK punk.\n\nGob Iron – Death Songs For The Living CD (Transmit Sound)\n\nGob Iron (British slang for a harmonica) is a brand-new side project for Son Volt and Uncle Tupelo founder Jay Farrar. Teaming up with his friend (and Varnaline front man) Anders Parker, Farrar has recorded an album of new takes on American folk standards. Also known as the folk process, these are old songs by the likes of Stephen Foster and The Reverend JM Gates which have been given new lyrics or new arrangements in an effort to re-interpret the songs in a fresh way. [Vinyl edition due May 10.]\n\nGraduating Life – Grad Life CD/LP (Pure Noise)\n\nGraduating Life, fronted by Bart Thompson aka Bart Starr and featuring members of Mom Jeans and Just Friends, hails proudly from Fresno, CA. “It is an understatement to say that the band took the dial and turned it up to eleven. A more accurate representation is that they took the dial, ripped it off, and punted it across the stage. Graduating Life sets to outdo themselves in every way possible as compared their first LP.” – The Alternative\n\nDavy Graham – Midnight Man [Reissue/1966] CD/LP (Bread & Wine)\n\nDavy Graham – Large As Life And Twice As Natural [Reissue/1968] CD/LP (Bread & Wine)\n\nDavy Graham is recognized as an early influential figure on the 1960s British folk scene, where he inspired many famous practitioners of the fingerstyle acoustic guitar such as Bert Jansch, Paul Simon, John Martyn and indeed Jimmy Page. Not one to be categorized Graham could be seen as a true world music artist covering the genres of folk, blues and jazz.\n\nIll Bill & Stu Bangas – Cannibal Hulk CD/LP (Uncle Howie)\n\nPrior to ever working together both Bill and Stu traveled in similar circles. Both heavily worked with Vinnie Paz (Jedi Mind Tricks/AOTP) which led to Stu being on Bill’s The Grimy Awards and Bill being featured on Stu’s albums with Esoteric and Blacastan. Having worked together on those tracks is what led to the manifestation of this project. Add to the scenario their love of comic books and the concept Cannibal Hulk was born. With both feeling most at home with aggressive music, this album sonically sounds exactly as its title indicates. Can Hulk features Vinnie Paz, Goretex, Slaine, Snak The Ripper and DJ Eclipse. [Limited green colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nIron Maiden ‎– Powerslave [Reissue/1984] CD (Sanctuary)\n\nIron Maiden ‎– Somewhere In Time [Reissue/1986] CD (Sanctuary)\n\nIron Maiden ‎– Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son [Reissue/1988] CD (Sanctuary)\n\nIron Maiden ‎– No Prayer For The Dying [Reissue/1990] CD (Sanctuary)\n\nFour albums from the English heavy metal band, remastered from the original analogue source.\n\nJethro Tull – This Was [Reissue/1968] CD/LP (Rhino/Parlophone)\n\nDigitally remastered edition of the Steven Wilson remix of this classic album. Recorded at a cost of £1200, This Was is the only Jethro Tull album with guitarist Mick Abrahams, who was a major influence for the sound and music style of the band’s first songs.\n\nJim Jones and The Righteous Mind – CollectiV CD/LP (Masonic)\n\n“Jim Jones and The Righteous Mind dish out fistfuls of dirty rock ‘n’ roll with a side order of voodoo and psych.” – Uncut\n\nKÁRYYN – The Quanta Series CD/LP (Mute)\n\nBorn in Alabama. Baptized in Aleppo. Raised in Indiana. KÁRYYN’s early life was divided between the USA and Syria, her identity split between middle-eastern and western culture. The first tracks that KÁRYYN has released are installments that make up the Quanta Series and are released in four parts (1, 11, 1:11 and 11:11). Her Syrian-Armenian-American heritage has heavily inspired her songwriting and musical style, particularly evident with her single “Aleppo”.\n\nKiwi Jr. – Football Money CD/LP (Mint)\n\nThe four members of Kiwi Jr. all live in Toronto, though they originally hail from Charlottetown, PEI, separately finding their ways to the big city over various points in the past decade. Now, having found a common language in jangling power-pop and hyperliterate college rock, they release their debut album, Football Money. “It’s very much a Toronto record,” says singer/guitarist Jeremy Gaudet. “Even though we’re East Coasters, there’s no nostalgia or romanticizing small towns. This album is about the neighborhoods we live in and our lives here.”\n\nL.A. Guns – The Devil You Know CD/LP (Frontiers)\n\nSince their self-titled debut in 1988 through to their 2017 comeback album, The Missing Peace, L.A. Guns, led by Tracii Guns and Phil Lewis, has always delivered solid rock ‘n’ roll. Hot on the heels of that recent release, the band returns with new slab, The Devil You Know which incorporates influences from Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin to Kyuss and The Hellacaopters.\n\nLoCash – Brothers CD (Wheelhouse)\n\nNew release from country music duo.\n\nLost Dog Street Band – Weight Of A Trigger CD/LP (Anti-Corp)\n\nLost Dog Street Band’s latest album, and fifth overall, Weight Of A Trigger, is a portal into when Americana was peopled by sensitive outlaws who pleaded for salvation in song. The ten-song collection spans old-time music, Appalachian folk, redemptive country blues, and winsome balladry. Each song is elegantly essential, using teardrop pedal steel guitar, delicate fingerpicked passages, emotive harmony vocals, and stately violin touches as delicate dynamic touches. The members’ influences of Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Doc Watson, Devil Makes Three, Tyler Childers, Hooray For The Riff Raff, Sarah Shook & The Disarmers, Arlo McKinley, and more shine through the band’s emotional lyrics and infectious hooks.\n\nLow Jack – Breizh CD (Hospital Productions)\n\nAfter his critically acclaimed roto-dub 12″ Riddims du Lieu-dit (2018), Low Jack produces Breizh, a highly articulate hybrid mix CD edited from an Editions Gravats showcase, showing his strange meeting of industrial cut-up dancehall and organic artificial intelligence.\n\nMadalitso Band – Wasalala CD/LP (Bongo Joe)\n\nIntuitive, authentic, and full of ruthless rhythms, the Malawian Madalitso Band will make you clap, dance, smile, and rethink everything you thought you knew about African sound and instrumentation.\n\nMagic Circle – Departed Souls CD/LP (20 Buck Spin)\n\nOn Departed Souls, Magic Circle stretch out and expose different shades that recall the moody peaks and valleys of the classic hard rock albums of the ‘70s Black Sabbath era. Acoustic 12-string, tablas and Fender Rhodes appear in lush moments of kaleidoscopic decadence woven into the fabric of the pounding elemental thunder.\n\nMathematik – Real/is-him CD/LP (Urbnet)\n\nRecently released on cassette – now available on CD and vinyl. Hip-hop pioneer Mathematik is meticulous with his craft. His work knows no shortcuts and the proof is in his finely managed sound. His roster of collaborators and cohorts reads like a Canadian hip-hop ‘who’s who’ commemorative. Highlights include producer K-Cut, Sic Sense, Citizen Kane, Saukrates, and Dream Warriors.\n\nMED Featuring Guilty Simpson – Child Of The Jungle CD/LP (Bang Yahead Ent.)\n\nJ Dilla’s protege Guilty Simpson first collaborated with Madlib’s protege MED on the hard hitting “Jungle Love” track off J Dilla’s The Shining. They continued to reunite on several tracks after, and now offer Child Of The Jungle. Features an all-star production lineup including Madlib, Nottz, Black Milk, MNDSGN, Karriem Riggins, 14KT, Exile and Apollo Brown.\n\nDannii Minogue – Neon Nights [Reissue/2003] CD/2xLP (London)\n\nA veritable pick and mix of the European dance scene at the time, Neon Nights spawned four Top 10 hit singles in the UK: “Who Do You Love Now?”, “Put The Needle On It”, “I Begin To Wonder”, and “Don’t Wanna Lose This Feeling”. Includes bonus tracks and remixes by Tiga, Jason Nevins, and Almighty.\n\nMotörhead – Sacrifice [Reissue/1995] CD/LP (BMG Rights Management)\n\nMotörhead – Overnight Sensation [Reissue/1996] CD/LP (BMG Rights Management)\n\nMotörhead – Snakebite Love [Reissue/1998] CD/LP (BMG Rights Management)\n\nMotörhead – Everything Louder Than Everyone Else: Live 1998 [Reissue/1999] 2xCD/3xLP\n\n(BMG Rights Management)\n\nMotörhead – We Are Motörhead [Reissue/2000] CD/LP (BMG Rights Management)\n\nCD and vinyl reissues of Motörhead’s 12th, 13th, 15th, and 15th albums, along with their 6th live album, Everything Louder Than Everyone Else: Live 1998.\n\nJake Najor and The Moment Of Truth – In The Cut CD/LP (The Redwood Music)\n\nOver the past 20 years, when musicians and producers in Southern California have needed fresh R&B, funk, or hip-hop beats, they’ve called on drummer Jake Najor. A former bandmember of Breakestra, Incredible Moses Leroy, and The Styletones, Najor has performed or recorded with scores of noteworthy artists, including TV on the Radio, Raphael Saadiq, Kelis, Joss Stone, Big Daddy Kane, de la Soul, Karl Denson, Rodriguez, and Empire of the Sun. While most of Najor’s career has been spent contributing percussion in service to the visions of his collaborators, with his debut record, In The Cut, Najor has been the one enlisting players from his musical cohort as well as some cherry-picked, heavy hitters on the L.A. funk/soul scene to flesh out ten tracks of original grooves, ranging from soulful cinematic instrumentals to hard hitting funk jams.\n\nStevie Nicks – Stand Back: 1981-2017 CD (Atlantic)\n\nMusic from all eight of Nicks’ studio albums are included in the set, from Top 10 hits like “Stand Back” and “Talk To Me” to “The Dealer” from 2014’s 24 Karat Gold: Songs From The Vault. Those solo tracks are joined by Nicks’ memorable collaborations with other artists, including “Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around” with Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, and “Leather And Lace” with Don Henley. [Vinyl edition due June 28.]\n\nSean Noonan Pavees Dance – Tan Man’s Hat CD/LP (RareNoise)\n\nA drummer and composer whose music enthusiastically defies category, Sean Noonan prefers the title Rhythmic Storyteller – an apt description for a modern-day sonic griot who spins imaginative yarns in the ancient tradition of wandering minstrels while weaving captivating narrative tapestries via his unique polyrhythmic language. On Tan Man’s Hat, the second release by his harmolodic jazz-rock ensemble Pavees Dance, Noonan draws inspiration from the soul to the stars with his stunningly adventurous collaborators: original Can vocalist Malcolm Mooney, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma (Ornette Coleman’s Prime Time), guitarist Ava Mendoza (Unnatural Ways) and keyboardist Alex Marcelo (Yusef Lateef).\n\nO.A.R. – Mighty CD (Red Music)\n\nPop rock band O.A.R. release their new album, The Mighty. The set was produced by friend Gregg Wattenberg and up-and-comer Pom-Pom (Helen Pomerantz) and is the first time O.A.R. has had a female producer. Pomerantz has brought new ideas to the table and blends O.A.R.’s organic sound with modern digital technology. [Vinyl edition due April 19.]\n\nOffset – Father Of 4 CD (Quality Control)\n\nThe debut studio album by rapper Offset features guest appearances by J. Cole, Cardi B, Travis Scott, 21 Savage, Big Rube, Gunna, CeeLo Green, Quavo and Gucci Mane.\n\nOhsees ‎– The Cool Death Of Island Raiders [Reissue/2006] CD/LP (Castle Face)\n\nChirping birds, gently lapping tempos and the nascent harmonization of Bridgid Dawson and John Dwyer detail a definitive highlight of their early quiet period of the band. The tree hangs heavy with Patrick Mullins’ handiwork, manning the musical saw, drums, and an assortment of homemade electronics. It seemed a bit radical to be so quiet about it, but the tunes are total ear-worms among the assorted drones, cut-up bits of tape noise, and mellow front porch-vibes, and the whole thing hangs together in a lovely hand-made way, helped in no small part by Dave Sitek’s production (he would later work on Master’s Bedroom as well).\n\nBen Platt – Sing To Me Instead CD (Atlantic)\n\nBen Platt originated the title role in Dear Evan Hansen to critical acclaim (Obie Award, Outer Critics Circle and Drama League nominations) and won the 2017 Tony Award for his Broadway performance. Platt was the original Elder Cunningham in the Chicago production of The Book of Mormon and reprised the role on Broadway.\n\nSuzi Quatro – No Control CD/2xLP (SPV/Steamhammer)\n\nThe Queen of rock ‘n’ roll is back with a wonderfully diverse collection of tracks. “At 68 years old, she sounds absolutely phenomenal. That her new album, No Control, has been released on SPV/Steamhammer — imprints usually associated with the heaviest of metal — is a massive statement. Because from the opening, ‘No Soul/No Control’, it’s clear that Quatro means business here. It’s a hard-edged, uncompromising rocker that showcases Quatro’s still killer voice.” – LA Weekly [Limited colored vinyl pressing includes two bonus tracks.]\n\nRage Of Light – Imploder CD (Napalm)\n\nThe Swiss newcomers embrace extreme metal, growls and hyperblasts as much as they cherish electronica and soaring melodies.\n\nJoshua Redman Quartet – Come What May CD/LP (Nonesuch)\n\nJoshua Redman Quartet’s Come What May is the first album in almost two decades from this group of musicians – the saxophonist and his longtime friends and colleagues pianist Aaron Goldberg, bassist Reuben Rogers, and drummer Gregory Hutchinson – and features seven Redman tunes. Mr. Redman’s place is secure as one of the most effusive and engaging tenor saxophonists in straight-ahead jazz, says the New York Times, and the Quartet is well attuned to his language of elastic tenacity.\n\nKeith Richards – Talk Is Cheap [Reissue/1988] CD/LP/2xCD+2xLP+2×7” (BMG Rights Management)\n\nDigitally remastered 30th Anniversary Edition of the rock legend’s debut solo album. [A limited red colored vinyl pressing is also available. The Super Deluxe edition is packaged in an exquisite deluxe folio pack and includes a CD and LP of bonus material, two 7” singles, an extensive 80-page hardback book, a tour laminate, lyric sheets, a guitar pick, and posters.]\n\nLuther Russel – Medium Cool CD/LP (Fluff & Gravy)\n\nMedium Cool is described by Luther as “a rough rock & roll album roughly about rock & roll,” recorded and mixed to tape with Derek Brown of the Eels on drums as well as a guest appearance by the elusive Liam Hayes of legendary Chicago band Plush.\n\nTy Segall – Deforming Lobes CD/LP/Cassette (Drag City)\n\nDeforming Lobes captures The Freedom Band in fiery flight, igniting a handful of songs from Ty Segall’s catalog live at L.A.’s Teragram Ballroom. The band explores everything with unrestrained curiosity and zeal, never losing their collective bond with the audience.\n\nSimple Creatures – Strange Love CD (BMG Rights Management)\n\nSimple Creatures is a new side project from Mark Hoppus (Blink-182) and Alex Gaskarth (All Time Low). [Vinyl edition due May 3.]\n\nSleaford Mods – Eaton Alive CD/LP (Extreme Eating)\n\nSleaford Mods are one of the most important, politically charged and thought-provoking duos currently making their mark on the UK music scene and beyond. Eaton Alive is their fifth album and first since parting ways with Rough Trade.\n\nGeorge Strait – Honkey Tonk Time Machine CD/LP (MCA Nashville)\n\nStrait returns to the country music spotlight with his first album of all new material in four years.\n\nLaura Stevenson – The Big Freeze CD (Don Giovanni)\n\nThe Big Freeze is New York-based songwriter Laura Stevenson’s fourth solo album and first full-length in four years. Recorded in her childhood home during the dead of winter, the record-named for the universe-chilling opposite the big bang-is a departure for Stevenson. Though her pedigree is in punk, Freeze has little in the way of distortion. [Vinyl edition due May 24.]\n\nTotaled – Lament CD/LP (Profound Lore)\n\nExhaling the ashes from acrimony, Totaled materialized in 2017 and recorded its ferociously blackened-hardcore debut album Lament. Pummeling blasts and d-beats pound into orbiting shadows of pixelated black, beneath a pulverizing dense nihilistic bass distorted into a mournful funeral offering. Here lies a digested celestial nothingness, a symphony frozen in a cyclical noose, gnawed by the bacterial ether.\n\nDevin Townsend – Empath CD (Inside Out U.S.)\n\nNew release from the guitar great featuring Mike Keneally as music director, Morgan Agren [Mats And Morgan, Frank Zappa, Fredrik Thordendal], Anup Sastry [Monuments, Periphery], Samus Paulicelli [Decripit Birth, Abigail Williams], Chad Kroeger [Nickelback], Anneke van Giersbergen and many more. [Vinyl edition due May 3.]\n\nTriumvir Foul – Urine Of Abomination CD/LP (Vrasubatlat)\n\nTriumvir Foul returns after a short lull following Spiritual Bloodshed (2017) with a four-song exhibition showcasing their more caustic elements. Sonically, Urine Of Abomination carries on the sound of the band’s more traditional death metal tendencies found on their demo An Oath Of Blood And Fire (2014) and fuses it with more bestial black/death destruction.\n\nVarious Artists – An Anthology Of Greek Experimental Music 2xCD/2xLP (Sub Rosa)\n\nAn Anthology of Greek Experimental Electronic Music 1966-2016 aspires to map the heterogeneous landscape of Greek experimental electronic music in all its contextual, sociopolitical, geographical and aesthetic disparity. With a single exception: it zeroes in on post-80s music. It comprises works of very different kinds by composers of all sorts of backgrounds that, still, can be thought of, as both “Greeks” and “experimentalists”. Features Anestis Logothetis, Dimitra Lazaridou-Chatzigoga, Panayiotis Kokoras, Christos Michalakos, Free Piece Of Tape, Ilan Manouach, Anastasis Grivas, Theodoros Zioutos, Nicolas Malevitsis, Ilios, Michalis Adamis, Fani Konstantinidou, Scizhic InzC, Georgia Spyropoulos, Panayiotis Velianitis, Iannis Xenakis, and Marinos Koutsomichalis.\n\nVarious Artists – Cumbia Beat Volume 3: 21 Peruvian Tropical Gems CD/2xLP (Vampisol)\n\n50 years after the release of one of the founding records of the genre known as Peruvian cumbia (by guitar players Enrique Delgado Montes and Berardo Hernández ‘Manzanita’), Vampisoul presents this third volume in the series Cumbia Beat, which brings together 45rpm rarities from acclaimed groups, short-lived bands and outstanding huaycumbias.\n\nVarious Artists – Jamaica Jazz From Federal Records: Carib Roots, Jazz, Mento, Latin, Merengue & Rhumba 1960-1968 CD/LP (Dubstore)\n\nReaching out to the real roots of the Jamaican ‘60s musical explosion, this compilation features some of the originators of the genre, including Ernest Ranglin, Lennie Hibbert and Cecil Lloyd.\n\nVarious Artists – Nigeria 70: No Wahala: Highlife, Afro-Funk, & Juju 1973-1987 CD/2xLP (Strut)\n\nAs part of their 20th Anniversary celebrations, Strut present the first new volume in their pioneering Nigeria 70 series in over eight years, bringing together rare highlife, Afro-funk and juju from the ‘70s and early ‘80s.

CD/3xLP+MP3 (Soul Jazz)\n\nSoul Jazz Records presents this new collection featuring the heavy ‘70s roots reggae of Bunny Lee a living legend, one of the last of the great Jamaican record producers who helped shape and define reggae music in the 1970s. Featuring some of the heaviest Jamaican artists including Johnny Clarke, King Tubby, Dillinger, Prince Jazzbo, Tommy McCook, the legendary Aggrovators, The Mighty Diamonds and more, the album is a rollercoaster ride of rare, deep and classic ‘70s roots, dub and DJ sounds.\n\nVarious Artists – Velvet Desert Music 1 CD/LP (Kompakt)\n\nA new compilation series on Kompakt, curated by one of Cologne’s leading figures in electronic music, Jörg Burger. Velvet Desert Music combines elements of rock, folk, country, surf, krautrock, and psychedelic in contemporary electronic music.\n\nJoni Void – Mise en Abyme CD/LP (Constellation)\n\nMise en Abyme is the second full-length by Joni Void, the avant-electronica project of France/Canada producer Jean Cousin, following his acutely accomplished and acclaimed 2017 debut album Selfless. Consistent with Selfless, the primary materials for the sample-based cut-up songcraft on Mise en Abyme are Cousin’s recordings of the voices of various friends. His self-professed body/voice dysmorphia, social dysphoria, and search for the disembodied-yet-emotional transcendent subject, continues to compel the use of other (predominantly non-verbal) voices in the construction of these sublimely affecting electronic-minimalist compositions.\n\nJack Waterson – Adrian Younge Presents Jack Waterson CD/LP (Linear Labs)\n\nJack Waterson is the acid that Adrian Younge never took as a kid. The result, as you’d expect, is both colorful and dark; full of sonic and musical surprises. Laced with hip hop breaks and acid rock, their intention is to subvert the designation of what is black vs. white music.\n\nThe Wedding Present – Live 2017 Part 2 CD+DVD (Scopitones)\n\nIn 2017, The Wedding Present played a series of concert dates to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the release of their classic debut album, George Best. The final concert in the series took place at the O2 Academy in Leeds on December 9, 2017, which is presented here.\n\nWhite Denim – Side Effects CD/LP (City Slang)\n\nLess than a year after their critically acclaimed last album Performance, the ever-prolific White Denim are back with their eighth record, Side Effects. More in line with the experimental, freewheeling spirit of their fan-favorite record Last Day Of Summer than anything else they’ve done since, Side Effects is a record that captures the essence of the band’s full-throttle live shows. [Limited clear colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nRita Wilson – Halfway To Home CD/LP (Sing It Loud, LLC)\n\nWith her new album, Halfway To Home – the second in a series of three new records – Rita Wilson continues to establish herself as a significant, rising singer-songwriter. Most of the album was recorded in Nashville and co-produced by Wilson and Nathan Chapman (Taylor Swift, Keith Urban, Shania Twain). Ron Aniello (Bruce Springsteen, Patti Scialfa) and John Shanks (Bon Jovi, Stevie Nicks, Sheryl Crow) also contributed as producers.\n\nXenoblight – Procreation CD (Out Of Line)\n\nXenoblight combine weird harmonics with thundershot riffs and hard-hitting riffs, led by the rabid screams of frontwoman Marika Hyldmar. RIYL Behemoth, Morbid Angel, Melechesh, Black Daliah Murder, Nevermore, Gojira, Death, Mayhem or Deströyer666\n\nEli Young Band – This Is Eli Young Band: Greatest Hits CD/2xLP (Valory)\n\nBest-of collection from the country band comprised of Mike Eli (lead vocals, guitar), James Young (guitar), Jon Jones (bass guitar), and Chris Thompson (drums). The band has charted eight times on the Billboard country charts, with three of their singles having reached #1.\n\nNick Zammuto – We The Animals: A Soundtrack By Nick Zammuto CD/2xLP (Temporary Residence)\n\nWe The Animals is the award-winning new film from Jeremiah Zagar (In A Dream). Based on the best-selling novel by Justin Torres, We The Animals is Zagar’s first narrative feature. It reunites Zagar with Nick Zammuto, the renowned composer and co-founder of beloved collage-pop pioneers, the Books. Inspired by the film’s setting in rural upstate New York – and influenced by the early ambient electronic music that galvanized the Books two decades ago – Zammuto pairs that earthen, wooded isolation with dynamic pulses of customized electronics and sparse, crystalline layers of melodic soft synths. [Limited colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nFrank Zappa – Zappa In New York [Reissue/1977] 5xCD/3xLP (Zappa Records)\n\nFrank Zappa played four historic sold-out concerts at The Palladium in New York City the week between Christmas and New Year’s. In celebration of its eventual release in 1978, this 40th Anniversary Edition features all-analog mastering of the original album mix, unavailable since first issued. [Five-disc CD edition features over three hours of unreleased live performances representing every composition played during the post-Christmas four-show engagement of 1976 and newly mixed in 2018.]\n\nDVDs + Blu-ray:\n\nJourney – Escape & Frontiers – Live In Japan DVD/Blu-ray (Eagle Rock Entertainment)\n\nIn February 2017, Journey went to Japan for a special show at Tokyo’s Budokan that featured a complete performance of 1981’s Escape and 1983’s Frontiers at the request of legendary Japanese concert promoter Mr. Udo in honor of his 50th anniversary in the business. “There’s a few songs I don’t even recall playing, like [the Frontiers track] ‘Troubled Child’,” Journey guitarist Neal Schon told Rolling Stone at the time. “Digging back into that stuff has been a lot of fun.” Live In Japan 2017: Escape + Frontiers features many of Journey’s most enduring songs, including “Don’t Stop Believin’”, “Faithfully”, “Separate Ways”, and “Open Arms” as well as deep cuts such as “Lay It Down” and “Back Talk” that the band hadn’t attempted to perform in decades.\n\nVarious Artists – Joni 75: A Birthday Celebration DVD (Decca)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on DVD. This all-star tribute to Joni Mitchel features Brandi Carlile, Glen Hansard, Emmylou Harris, Norah Jones, Chaka Khan, Diana Krall, Kris Kristofferson, Los Lobos with La Marisoul, Cesar Castro & Xochi Flores, Graham Nash, Seal, James Taylor, and Rufus Wainwright.\n\nThis Week’s Vinyl Exclusives:\n\nLuke Abbott – Music From The Edge Of An Island LP (Float)\n\nUK electronic artist and Szun Waves band member Luke Abbott presents a special ten-track album to celebrate Piano Day 2019 (March 29th) – an international event series initiated by Nils Frahm which acts as a platform for piano-related projects. Music From The Edge Of An Island sees Abbott divert from his typically experimental electronic style to explore a more compositional approach centered around VST instruments. Rather than the usual themes of synthesis and improvisation, the album is led by piano motifs, structured around emotive melodies and sparkling arrangements.\n\nAlla Xul Elu – The Almighty 2xLP (Majik Ninja)\n\nSophomore album from the Ohio underground horrorcore hip-hop group comprised of three masked men: Alla Xul Elu’s Billy Obey, Joe Black and Lee Carver.\n\nAutoclave – Autoclave LP (Dischord)\n\nThis LP combines the band’s 7-inch and 10-inch singles as well as two extra demo tracks.

Following Autoclave’s dissolution, Billotte would go on to perform in Slant 6, Quix-O-Tic, and The Casual Dots. Timony formed the bands Helium and Ex Hex in addition to releasing four records under her own name.\n\nBeach Slang – MPLS 7” (Quiet Panic/Bridge Nine)\n\nSince 2014 Beach Slang’s brand of punk tinged rock & roll has catapulted them into being one of the most recognizable and exciting names in underground music. Dubbed as a ‘thank you’ to Minneapolis, MLPS was produced by Goo Goo Dolls bassist Robby Takac and features Beach Slang’s take on Bob Mould and Paul Westerberg songs, respectively.\n\nBob Bell – Necropolis [Reissue/1978] LP (Telephone Explosion)\n\nCanadian private press mega-rarity/ obscurity from the artistically schizophrenic Bob Bell. Recorded in 1978, Bell splits the difference between his love of basement psych splatter/pummel and squalling free jazz ramble, the former occupying Side A with a stunning four-part suite of wasted guitar scuzz and churning Krautrock-like drama with an akin to German Oak, Roland Kirk, Albert Ayler, DNA, Melt Banana (minus the vocals) and Guru Guru. The latter represents Bell as a saxophonist on Side B, and the music itself translates into a 15-minute free-jazz exploration.\n\nBlame One – The 34th Scroll 2xLP (HHV.DE)\n\nThe 34th Scroll is entirely produced by Veks (of Last Jazz Club fame) and mastered by almighty Thes One from People Under The Stairs. Guests include Blu, One. Be. Lo., Exile and Flashius.\n\nBronski Beat – The Age Of Consent [Reissue/1984] LP+2xCD (London)\n\nLimited pink colored vinyl LP pressing. This era-defining, pop classic includes debut single “Small Town Boy”, a huge global hit, which continues to resonate with today’s LGBT+ generation and remains a dancefloor staple. To celebrate the 35-year anniversary of Bronski Beat’s forming, The Age Of Consent has been remastered and expanded.\n\nCellar Darling – The Spell LP (Nuclear Blast America)\n\nReleased last week on CD – now available on vinyl. Celar Darling confidently fuse heavy alternative and progressive rock with strong folk influences and poetic lyrical tales, creating what you may very well call a New Wave Of Folk Rock.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival ‎– Creedence Clearwater Revival [Reissue/1968] LP (Craft Recordings)\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival ‎– Bayou Country [Reissue/1969] LP (Craft Recordings)\n\nLimited 50th Anniversary 180gm vinyl LP pressings housed in a tip-on jacket replicating the packaging of the original pressing. Half-speed at Abbey Road Studios.\n\nCube – Decoy Street LP (W.25th)\n\nCube is the prolific and chimeric nom de plume of one Adam Keith, formidable tape experimentalist and artist/abraser currently operating in Oakland, California’s vibrant subterranea.\n\nCyne – Time Being [Reissue/2003] LP (Project Mooncircle)\n\nTime Being, originally released in 2003, was the first full-length Cyne LP, following a series of 12” singles for Beta Bodega’s imprint Botanica Del Jibaro.

I have many fond memories of the work and inspiration that went into these compositions. I hope you as a listener will create your own memorable and dear experiences when playing this record. Thank you.” – Damu The Fudgemunk\n\nDeaf Center – Low Distance LP (Sonic Pieces)\n\nDeaf Center – Owl Splinters/Twin [Reissue/2011] 2xLP+MP3 (Miasmah)\n\nLow Distance is Deaf Center’s third full-length studio album and perhaps the most focused effort by the Norwegian duo to date. After their last record Owl Splinters (2011), which was quite an eclectic endeavor, Erik K Skodvin and Otto A Totland draw their sound back into something quieter and more minimal. [Owl Splinters gets a lavish re-packaging as a gatefold, double-LP. It includes the Svarte Greiner re-interpretation album, Twin, as well as new cover art with photos by cinematographer Joshua Zucker-Pluda.]\n\nDemon Hunter – War LP (Solid State)\n\nDemon Hunter – Peace LP (Solid State)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. A pair of new albums from the Christian metal band.\n\nAl Jr. Dobson – Sounds From The Village Vol. 2 LP (HHV.DE)\n\nThe second volume of drum tracks and abstract musical curation from the Dobson Jr. Archives.\n\nDome – Dome [Reissue/1980] LP (Editions Mego)\n\nWith the demise of the group Wire in 1980, founder members Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis joined forces to create Dome. With the assistance of engineer Eric Radcliffe and his Blackwing Studio Dome took the ethic of using the studio as a compositional tool and recorded and released three Dome albums on their own label in the space of 12 months: Dome (July 1980), Dome 2 (October 1980), and Dome 3 (October 1981). A final fourth album, Will You Speak This Word: Dome IV was released in May 1983. These albums represent some of the most beautifully stark and above all timeless exercises in studio experimentation from the early 1980s alternative music scene.\n\nDoppelgangaz – Beats For Brothels Vol. 4 2xLP (HHV.DE)\n\nThe fourth installment in the Beats For Brothels series. For the last decade, the Doppelgangaz—the New York-based duo of childhood friends Matter Ov Fact and EP—have operated according to weird, graphic specifics: a distinctive mix of demented nonsense and highly-specific culinary boasts. In their early years, the Doppelgangaz stuck primarily to dark and dusty boom bap tracks, built around beats that felt boxy, nostalgic, and simple. Since then, they’ve incorporated more fluid atmospheres and contemporary stylistics into their sound.\n\nC Duncan – Health LP (Fat Cat)\n\nC Duncan’s highly-anticipated third album, following his Mercury Prize-nominated debut and the critically acclaimed The Midnight Sun sees the Scottish multi-instrumentalist ditch his bedroom studio and work with other producers, engineers and musicians for the first time. Navigating themes of love, anxiety and sexuality, Health is a deeply personal record that delves into a world Duncan had previously felt uneasy exploring. Warm and harmonically rich, Duncan delightfully juxtaposes the vibrant and wholesome aesthetic of the album with an often darker lyrical undertone, pushing himself to refine and explore new ways of writing.\n\nEast Of The Wall – NP-Complete LP (Translation Loss)\n\nNew Jersey progressive metal outfit East Of The Wall return with their first new album in six years.

Letha’s music, as her visual art, was a great collaged pile of extreme strangeness, with seemingly irreconcilable objects butting heads in ways that end up making great sense. Letha managed to create very very warped music without making it off-putting. Although her sonics were whacked as hell, they were created with such a warm and gooey center that even people who’d usually shy away from such things, would ask what was playing when we floated the album through the store’s stereo system.\n\nDominic Miller – Absinthe LP (ECM)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl.

It unfolds as a series of instrumental ambient pieces inspired by Southern California’s Interstate 10 highway and the varying landscapes it passes through. Beginning with the soft, soothing drones of the desert sunrise, Sound Field traverses the westward path of I-10 through the outer suburban sprawl of Southern California and the dense urban congestion of Downtown Los Angeles, concluding on the shores of Santa Monica Beach as shimmering arpeggios imitate the light reflecting off the waves of a Pacific Ocean sunset.\n\nRob – Hell Fire [Reissue/1981] LP (Tambourine Party)\n\nRob’s prophetic pre-apocalypse disco message, Hellfire, was originally released as a promotional LP by Nigerian label Taretone.

Operating system updates, app compatibility, bugs, password resets, two-factor authentication, A.I., blockchains, The Singularity…computers, I tell you! It’s easy (and fun!) to gripe about. But can you formulate those grumblings into a foot-tapping synthpop ditty? Bet you can’t! Well Wharp & Rom can – and has. Their aptly-titled single ‘Computers’ begins bubbly enough, then works its way into a chant denouncing technology…but in the nicest way possible.\n\nThe track comes from their debut, Radical American Hippy Kraut.” – Tiny Mixtapes\n\nWilma Vrita – Burd LP (Bad Taste)\n\nWilma Vritra have landed with Burd, a trans-Atlantic collaboration between London based artist Wilma Archer and L.A. based rapper Pyramid Vritra.
