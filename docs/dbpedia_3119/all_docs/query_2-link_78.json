        "text": "For all first responders: police officers, fire fighters, EMTs and paramedics who we lean on in times of crisis and when we need help and protection. For all those who run toward danger for the sake of others and for those who strengthen them, their families and loved ones during this stressful time in our nation and the world. We offer this scripture and prayer for all first responders who have been working tirelessly and selflessly and who meet each day with courage and heart.\n\nIsaiah 41:13\n\n“For I, the LORD your God, hold your right hand; it is I who say to you, Fear not, I am the one who helps you.”\n\nLet us pray:\n\nAlmighty God, you lend your strength to all those who are there for us in times of crisis, fear, and hurt. You give courage to the first responders who continue to do this important work they are called to do, looking beyond the risk for the sake of those who need your help and protection. We give you thanks for the many ways they give of themselves, their skills, knowledge and help in troubling times. Protect them, o Lord. Extend your shielding hand over them and comfort their hearts when they are tired and heartbroken.\n\nGod, we also lift up prayers of thanksgiving and comfort for the families of first responders and all who support them. Give them hope and courage. Surround them with your loving presence and give them peace when their loved ones run toward uncertainty. All this we pray in your name. Amen.\n\nPastoral Intern Sarah Swindall\n\nWednesday, March 25\n\nWelcome to “A Prayer For…,” a prayer ministry of the Campus Ministry Office of Augsburg University. We believe prayer is efficacious, a holy conversation with God that enables us to share our struggles and joys, lamentations and celebrations, blessings and hopes for ourselves, our neighbors, the world, and the whole of God’s creation. We plead, we prod, we protest, we praise – with lift all our prayers onto God trusting that they are received in divine mercy and love. It is in prayer we are freed to speak the truth of our hearts onto God so that we may abound in hope together through the power of the Holy Spirit—the very breath of God, the breath that makes all things new.\n\nIn these days of the COVID-19 pandemic fraught with anxiety, isolation, suffering, and discombobulation, the Campus Ministry team is offering daily prayers for our Augsburg community and beyond. We recognize that there is so much to pray for in this unprecedented time. “A Prayer For…” is one way we can collectively share in the holy conversation with our God as each day we lift up one specific concern or people or need or situation or hope in prayer. The prayers will run the gamut in tone and topic varying each day as together as a community we hold before God “A Prayer for…” Over the course of the days and weeks ahead, we will contribute to an on-going catalog of prayers we can use at any time throughout this challenging journey we share together.\n\nThe authors of these prayers – Rev. Babette Chatman, Pastoral Intern Sarah Swindall, and Rev. Justin Lind-Ayres – welcome you to share your prayer topics with us. You can send them onto us by emailing Campus Ministry team member, Janice Dames (dames@augsburg.edu). We will seek to incorporate your ideas into our communal prayers. As we enter into prayer together from afar through this simple yet profound ministry, may God in Christ Jesus strengthen us and keep us united together in peace and love.\n\n“A PRAYER FOR…COLLEGE STUDENTS”\n\nSo much has radically changed in such a short time. College students at Augsburg University, at our sibling Evangelical Lutheran Church in America colleges and universities, and at all other institutions of higher learning in the US are bearing the stressors of COVID-19 while also striving to move on-line in course work and continue the educational process. We offer this scripture text and prayer for all COLLEGE STUDENTS navigating new realities.\n\nProverbs 8:1: “Does not Wisdom call, and does not understanding raise her voice?”\n\nLet us pray:\n\nGod of all wisdom and understanding, we thank you for Augsburg University and other centers of learning seeking to educate leaders for work and witness in your world. In these days of upheaval, uphold college students adapting to the real consequences of the coronavirus. Living arrangements have shifted, coursework is taking on new forms, jobs and internships have retracted, study abroad programs cancelled or postponed, and the scramble to adapt to the ever-changing situation is maddening. And all the while, health risks loom. Into this chaos, holy One, reveal your steady presence and empower all students engaged in higher education: calm anxious hearts and minds; ease the burdens of isolation; bolster community through social media; give focus to the coursework that needs tending; and give your peace, the peace that passes all understanding made known through your Spirit of Wisdom and her ways. Amen.\n\nRev. Justin Lind-Ayres\n\nPrayer for March 23, 2020\n\nRecorded Service: 3.17.20\n\nA Message from Campus Ministry Office\n\nAs for this moment, together we offer our prayers for you and for the world, to share in community in this season of social distancing, and find time to be united in the love of God for us and for the world.\n\nScripture Reading\n\nFrom Romans 8:\n\nIt is God who justifies.

We were going to offer special prayers for travel groups, sports teams, and classes all striking out on various adventure. Then, Covid-19. And plans changed. Travel cancelled. Hopes delayed.\n\nYet, here we are gathering around a word of promise that no matter our journeys ahead – changed or unchanged, near or far – It is God who goes with us, it is God who leads us in right paths for God’s name sake…it is God who is our rod, our staff, our comfort. It is God walks alongside us as we disperse from Augsburg amid uncertainty in the world; yet, we are certain that the goodness and mercy of God will follow us each and every day of the journey.\n\nSo we gather now to sing, to hear the promise of God’s presence, to pray for those who are traveling as some trips headed out, and bless us all as we prepare to leave, that we may go out with good courage knowing that God in Christ Jesus goes with us.\n\nPRAYER\n\nLet us pray.\n\nGod of the journey, you kept Abraham and Sarah in safety throughout the days of their pilgrimage; you led the children of Israel through the midst of the sea; and by a star you led the Magi to the infant Jesus.
