        "text": "Pastoral Care Ministries\n\nWe are all called to Christ's ministry of offering God's love to each other - both by asking for love and support during times of adversity, and by offering our gifts to nurture those in their time of need, we together heal and become whole in Christ.\n\nThe 'Trinity Cares' team is a group of volunteers that coordinates and facilitates congregational needs in collaboration with Trinity's clergy.\n\nClick here for more information.\n\nPrayer Ministries\n\nAs a people of God, Trinity offers prayers for those of the church, the community, and the world who are in need.\n\nThere are many ways that Trinity offers prayerful support. One way is through a prayer list that is shared with a small number of parishioners that intentionally pray for those in need.\n\nClick here for more information, or to make a prayer list request.\n\nPeacemeal\n\nPeacemeals were instituted at Trinity in the early 90's especially for those in our community with HIV. Back then, HIV was a very scary thing, and those with HIV were often ostracized. Many of our guests were in need of comfort, support and a good time. Flash forward 30 years and the needs have changed.\n\nPeacemeal now focuses on those who might be experiencing a sense of isolation: the elderly, homeless adults and youths, or anyone who would benefit from sharing a meal with others in a safe and non-judgmental space. And you don't have to be experiencing problems to to join in the festivities. All are welcome!\n\nTrinity and our sister church St. Phillips New Hope on the first Sunday of the month. We provide not only a meal but also loving, non-judgmental fellowship.\n\nMission Philadelphia\n\n2024 Dates: June 29th - July 3rd\n\nEach year Trinity Solebury youth and young adults have worked in Philadelphia’s high need areas to help improve the quality of life for local residents. For the past 27 years, Trinity Solebury has worked side by side with residents to revitalize their neighborhoods by transforming abandoned lots into green spaces and community gardens that inspire and promote positive human interaction. Mission Philadelphia forges relationships with these neighborhoods, working together to break down racial and demographic barriers.\n\nThis year, Trinity Solebury is pleased to be joined by youth and adults from St. David’s Radnor.\n\nFor more information on Mission Philadelphia, click here.\n\nClick here to view Facebook updates.\n\nRejoice in the Lord, O you righteous;\n\nit is good for the just to sing praises.\n\nSing to him a new song. Psalm 33\n\nThe musical world has been greatly affected by COVID-19, especially the act of singing. Recent guidelines have recommended singers be distanced by at least 27 feet. Therefore this makes congregational singing and choirs virtually impossible. Singing has been such a vital part of our worship lives as we lift our voices singing praises. For the time being, we have assembled small groups in the church to record anthems and hymns for use in our services. With new technology, we produced our first Virtual Choir recording for the 20th anniversary celebration of the re-dedication of Trinity Church in October. We will continue to use music in our worship in a safe and responsible way. The day will come when all can lift their voices in song to worship the Almighty and it will be a glorious day.\n\nFriends Of Music\n\nConcert Series: The world’s great music speaks to us through dedicated musicians who, through their tireless performances, reach the depth of our souls. We invite you to experience world class musicians at Trinity: the “happening place” in Bucks County for classical musical performance.\n\nTo download the Friends of Music Concert Series 2023-2024 brochure, pleaseclick here.\n\nSupport Trinity Church Friends of Music\n\nThe mission of Trinity Church’s Friends of Music is to help provide worthy musical events to Trinity Church and the community. Ticket sales cover only a part of the cost of our concert series. If you are interested in becoming a Trinity Friend of Music, please contact Timothy Harrell, organist/choirmaster at 215-297-5135.\n\nAdult Choirs\n\nSenior Choir is open to all parish members and interested community singers without audition. The choir of 30 singers is made up totally of volunteers, though quite a number of its members have had extensive training as choral singers and participate in multiple choral groups in the area. The choir sings a variety of musical styles ranging from medieval chant to 21st century anthems and spirituals. They also perform portions of G. F. Handel’s Messiah yearly with professional soloists and orchestra.\n\nChamber Choir is an auditioned group that specializes in a cappella anthems and motets.\n\nYouth & Family Ministries\n\nThe sacred trust of providing for the religious education and spiritual nurture of children is a cornerstone of Trinity. Our message shares the story of faith and the presence of God's love in our lives. Through special events, opportunities are provided for our children to live out a service of love. The story of our faith, the presence of the Holy Spirit, and our love of neighbors are all connected in powerful ways and experienced by Trinity's young people.\n\nSafe play is offered in the nursery for our youngest children and Church School for grades PreK-8th at 9:30 AM until the Passing of the Peace at which time children join their families in the sanctuary.\n\nClick here for church school and nursery registration."
