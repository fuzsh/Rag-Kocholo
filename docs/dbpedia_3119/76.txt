Former THE ALMIGHTY frontman Ricky Warwick has changed the projected title of his new solo album to "Love Many Trust Few" from the previously announced "Even Now".

"The album had been going under the title 'Even Now' but on reflection and living with it for a while, I felt it wasn't quite the title I or this album was looking for," Ricky writes on his web site. "So the album will be called 'Love Many Trust Few', a statement that means a lot to me and was instilled in me many years ago, I feel this sums up the attitude lyrically and musically on the album.

"The artwork and design has been done by the great Steve Averill, famous for his work with U2 and being the guitar player with the seminal Irish punk band THE RADIATORS FROM SPACE. Sanctuary Records have scheduled mid-May for release and I will be hitting the road as soon as possible.
