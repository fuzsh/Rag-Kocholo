Started as a small label, Sanctuary eventually grown out to a full blown music group (see the Sanctuary Records Group).

Nowadays, it's still active under the group's umbrella.

Note that there also exist a US branch, though 2005-2007 severe loss for the group reoriented its activities toward IPR and it stopped releasing records. US releases events should be filled under the US label instead.

Note that there exists a number of specialized Sanctuary subsidiaries under which releases should be properly filled.

This label should (theorically) be used only for UK/European "Sanctuary" releases.

Created in 2000 with the ambition to reproduce the success of Sanctuary Records (Group) in Europe on the other side of the Atlantic.

Following severe loss for the holding, this US offshoot will stop releasing new records in 2007.

US releases by "Sanctuary" should be filled here.

Note, though, that there exists a number of specialized Sanctuary sublabels as well (Sanctuary Classics, Sanctuary Midline comes to mind), and that they should be filled properly under these entries.
