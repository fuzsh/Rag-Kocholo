Slovenia was officially invited to become a NATO member at a NATO summit in Prague at the end of November and only few days later EU leaders named at their summit the ten candidates, including Slovenia, due to become full EU members on 1 May 2004. Slovenia concluded accession negotiations with the EU in the mid-December.

Janez DrnovÅ¡ek was elected president of the republic in the beginning of December succeeding Milan KuÄan who stepped down after two terms in office. Mr. DrnovÅ¡ek resigned as prime minister after being elected president and the parliament elected Anton Rop the new prime minister right before the year-end. The newly appointed government retained virtually all ministers from the previous team.
