        "text": "FENA – SDA Vice President Mirsad Kebo stated Tuesday evening for FENA news agency that the meeting between SDA and HDZ on the current crisis between the two parties was not held as announced. However, FENA and FTV claim they learned that parties’ pleaders Sulejman Tihic and Barisa Colak held meetings.\n\nOslobodjenje pg 8 ‘Unsolved problems Hadzipasic will share with Lozancic?’ – Tihic stated for Oslobodjenje that at the meeting it was agreed that most of the FBiH Govt problems would be solved between PM Ahmet Hadzipasic and his deputies Dragan Vrankic and Gavrilo Grahovac. In case these talks would faily, Hadzipasic is instructed to seek the assistance by FBiH President Niko Lozancic and FBiH Vice Presidents. “In order to avoid outvoting, prime minister and deputies will agree on the session agenda. The decision that Govt doesn’t reach consensus on will be sent back to three [of them.] If the problem was not to be solved even in that case, that FBiH President would solve it with his deputies-,” explained Tihic.\n\nDnevni Avaz pg 3 ‘Without ethnic outvoting, larger powers for PM and deputies’ – DA brings same statement as Oslobodjenje.\n\nFTV by Sanja Beciragic– Reporter says that the current crisis between SDA and HDZ was the most difficult one in executive authorities in BiH to date. According tot he journalist, outvoting of HDZ ministers, their boycott of government’s work and public attention given to resignation demands directed against FBiH Prime Minister Ahmed Hadzipasic, is just a story for the public to draw attention from the issue who negotiates on behalf of the parties. The real problem is reported to be control over finances and authorities on lower levels, especially in Central Bosnia and Herzegovina-Neretva Cantons, but also control over the Pension and Invalid Fund and Roads Directorate. “I still haven’t meet negotiation team, it was planned for today to hold a meeting but it still hasn’t been held”, said Mirsad Kebo. And while negotiation team waited for HDZ to schedule a meeting, leader of the parties, Tihic and Colak met in the building of BiH Presidency. FBiH President Niko Lozancic claims HDZ will not change its demands and Mirsad Kebo that SDA has reasons for dissatisfaction as well. “I said there are two issues we will not give up on: personnel parallelisms and personnel solutions”, said Kebo. “Colak, from the beginning, has been asking to sign the contract regarding our agreement”, said Lozancic. HDZ sources say it has been that outvoting voting will not be a practice anymore and HDZ promised not to go back to the issues of decisions made in the absence of HDZ Ministers. HDZ and SDA will have to find a compromise regarding positions with the Pension and Invalid Fund and Roads Directorate.\n\nRHB, BHTV 1 – Media reported that parties’ negotiation teams were supposed to meet in the evening.\n\nVecernji List pg 2 ‘HDZ still awaiting for reply from SDA’ – Following Tuesday evening meeting between Colak and Tihic, VL carries Colak as announcing “readiness of his party to overcome the latest crisis”. “I think an agreement is possible, but it takes to reach the agreement”, said Colak, alluding to the situation in which the SDA does not want to fully accept his proposals. Questioned as to what would satisfy the Croat negotiators, Colak says he expects introduction of mechanisms that would offer protection from outvoting. In that context, VL notes that Tihic is trying to persuade his party colleagues to give in to the HDZ, whilst the SDA Vice President, Suada Palavric, believes that in that case, there need to be constitutional changes.\n\nDnevni List pg 2 ‘Federation Government in full composition next week!?’ – Daily learns from Colak that the negotiations would continue. DL also reports that Tihic stated that his party would not agree to changes to the Book of Rules of the FBiH Government, promising that he would do everything that decisions within the FBiH Government are not taken through outvoting. Daily claims that the two sides will most likely be trying to reach a compromise regarding the functioning of authority in the Herzegovina-Neretva and Central Bosnia Cantons.\n\nBHTV 1, RTRS, FTV, Oslobodjenje cover, pg 6 ‘Expert team for old savings debt’, Dnevni Avaz pg 3 ‘Experts to investigate the Ljubljanska bank case soon’,\n\nNezavisne Novine pg 3 ‘Experts to resolve issue of old foreign currency’ – The Chairman of the BiH Council of Ministers, Adnan Terzic, and Slovene Prime Minister Anton Rop said that the relations between two countries were satisfactory, however burdened with the issue of old foreign currency savings of BiH citizens in Ljubljanska bank. Prime Ministers reached an agreement to establish the expert group that would investigate the issue an offer possible solution. Terzic also said that BiH expects from Slovenia to start intensive negotiations on all outstanding questions and commerce deficit after 1 May. Rop said he agreed that the issue of deposits must be solved. Terzic described as unacceptable the report presented by Erik Jurgens to the Council of Europe Board for Human Rights at a session in Paris on Monday. On the other hand Prime Minister Rop described the report as positive for Slovenia, but that an effort needs to be made to compromise on all issues. As positive, Terzic pointed to the fact that Council of Europe acknowledged that this issue was not political but legal question. “This is legal question and not a political one and that is position BiH always took“, said Adnan Terzic.\n\nRHB, FENA – Terzic said in that the visit to Slovenia posed a risk because the public in BiH has a negative view of up to date relations between Slovenia and BiH, FENA’s correspondent reported. “We decided to make the visit because we think that only through open dialogue can we resolve problems. We think that the accession of Slovenia to the EU represents a major advantage for BiH”, Terzic said. BiH needs to find a way to motivate the Slovenian Government to resolve the BiH deficit towards Slovenia, which has been growing for years and has reached 10 billion USD. He thinks that businessmen from Slovenia could move the production capacities to BiH, as was done in Croatia, and that this would allow BiH to cover other West Balkan markets. He said that his Government inherited numerous unresolved issues, such as the issue of Ljubljanska Bank Sarajevo old foreign currency savings.\n\nDnevni Avaz cover Rop: We will find solutions for three big problems’ by Faruk Cardzic – In an interview to DA, Slovene PM Anton Rop praised Jurgens’ report on Ljubljanska bank issue, stressing that BiH and Slovenia must work on it together.\n\nOslobodjenje cover, pg 3 ‘Vrankic would continue with ethnic cleansing in BiH’, Vecernji List front pg splash ‘Grahovac requests removal of Vrankic’, pg 3 ‘Grahovac: Remove Vrankic!’, Dnevni List, front and page 9 “Vrankic would gladly continue with ethnic cleansing in BiH’ – Deputy FBiH Prime Minister and Minister of Culture and Sport Gavrilo Grahovac on Tuesday recommended the High Representative, Paddy Ashdown, to remove from duty the officials who express national bigotry, hatred, and call on continuation of ethnic cleansing. Grahovac reacts to the public statements given by FBiH Finance Minister Dragan Vrankic in regard to the reaction of Minister Grahovac on issuing decisions at the last session of the FBiH Government: “Vrankic’s claim that I do not work for the interests of the Serb, but the Bosniak people, shows that Vrankic understands nothing or intentionally excludes facts. My job in the Government is not and never will be to protect the interests of the Serb people, but exclusively the interests of BiH citizens, and within this the interests of all three peoples, all national minorities and all others who live in BiH, love and want to live in their fatherland. But, this exactly is the misunderstanding between me and Vrankic. He does not want what I support. He would like to live in an ethnically clean Croat environment, without Bosniaks, and Serbs especially.” The essence of Vrankic’s position is viewed in the fact that he would very much like to proceed with ethnic cleansing in BiH, stressed Grahovac.\n\nDnevni Avaz cover splash ‘Grahovac accused Vrankic of chauvinism’, pg 2 ‘Vrankic’s statements are the most dangerous chauvinism’ – Grahovac also accused that HDZ’s refusal to return to the FBiH Govt was “continuation of the dangerous concept of most probably establishing the third entity in FBiH.”\n\nDnevni List pg 7 ‘Unqualified staff to be made redundant soon’ by Zvonimir Jukic – DL claims that the High Representative for BiH, Paddy Ashdown, after a ceremonial abolishment of Mostar municipalities on March 15, issued new instructions to the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Mostar, Hamdija Jahic and Ljubo Beslic, respectively, requesting them to adopt a new city budget and prepare a systematization of jobs in the Mostar City administration. According to DL, the real problem will be to devise a systematization of jobs because a lot of current employees in former municipal administrations were hired through connections, since many of them are not qualified for the jobs. In that context, DL claims the redundancies of such employees could cause conflicts between Jahic and Beslic on one, and their party colleagues, who hired those employees, on the other side. According to DL, Deputy Mayor Beslic has managed to push his initiative according to which the aim of the restructuring of the city should not mean redundancies at all costs, since many employees deserve to stay in their positions. Apparently, HR Ashdown supported Beslic’s initiative saying that he would see, if Jahic and Beslic successfully implement the decision of Mostar, that five FBiH Ministries move to Mostar, adding that a part of the current administration could find jobs in the Ministries.\n\nVecernji List pg 9 ‘Administration if forming union’ -According to IC research, Mostar needs a 250-strong administration. VL also learns that several Croat and Bosniak employees of the current administration are planning to found a union to monitor the downsizing process.\n\nSlobodna Dalmacija pg 9 ‘No queues at counters’ – SD notes that estimates says that out of current 692 employees, some 350 will be made redundant.\n\nOslobodjenje pg 2 ‘The time has come to action’ op-ed by Antonio Prlenda – Referring to the visits by NATO senior officials and often warnings from OHR on BiH’s slow implementation reforms, author writes that “obviously, foreigners understood that any further delays in the implementation of the defence reforms in BiH could be fatal for BiH’s accession to PfP… ‘If this thing is let up to the domestic officials, it would easily fail’ is certainly what they though in Brussels and [again] interfered… And, now finally, after many problems and only after the interference of the international community, BiH finally got the first post-war defence minister… The first step towards PfP, in this way, has been finally made, but there are many more to follow, for what many countries would need years.” Author further says that he was sure that majority of BiH citizens do not understand what accession to PfP means, stressing that more than anything it would signify a security. “Claustrophobics from SDS would not really benefit from this. This would crack their financial channels in their closed, narrow circles. They would lose power and authority. Their entire idea would fail. But, their problem is that this is the only possibility for their people in RS too… Brussels wants to see BiH ready in Istanbul, and will do everything to make sure this happens,” concludes the editorial.\n\nFTV – RS and FBiH Prime Ministers, Dragan Mikerevic and Ahmet Hadzipasic respectively, met on Tuesday with the representatives of the International Monetary Fund in BiH, headed by Peter Doyle, the Principle Deputy High Rep Donald Hays and the World Bank officials, in order to discuss the proposal for more comprehensive approach towards restructuring cooperation and privatization of the strategy companies, as well as the issue of outstanding debts. Following the meeting, Mikerevic stated that concluded that legislation must be changes in order to achieve faster restructuring of the companies. Prime Minister Hadzupascis said that they also discussed the issue of internal debt, to which he said that the part of the debt should be written off, and other parts directed to long-term solutions or buy out.\n\nBHTV 1 – Two Prime Ministers promised to remove all obstacles towards entities trade and to stimulate export oriented companies. Entities’ Ministers of Finance and Trade were given a 7 days deadline to reach an agreement of the new way for oil and oil derivates trade. Solutions have to decrease grey economy and increase budgetary means. The first July is a deadline until which issue of pension’s pay outs must be solved and Prime Ministers announce also joined declaration in from of MMF. Prime Ministers claim higher loans from World Bank will be used for infrastructure improvement.\n\nDnevni Avaz pg 2 ‘Import of oil through railways as of 1 July’, Nezavisne Novine pg 6 ‘Disposal of oil from Refinery will be resolved in seven days’ – Dragan Mikerevic and Ahmet Hadzipasic, have reached a framework agreement regarding settlement of the problem related to disposal of oil from Serb Brod Oil Refinery at the FBiH market.\n\nRTRS – Mikerevic and Hadzipasic agreed to solve mutual problems in finances, trade, energy and ecology. They have also agreed to hold similar meetings every two months. Ministers have agreed to abolish double taxation on excise goods, which should contribute to establishment of a single economic space in BiH. In the next few days they will develop the contract on this matter. Both PMs agreed that companies with capacities for export should be stimulated. “We want to stimulate and ensure subventions to those strategic branches, among which the most important is agricultural production,” said Ahmet Hadzipasic.\n\nDnevni Avaz pg 4 ‘RS will submit objections on the draft Public Acquisitions Law’, Nezavisne Novine pg 4 ‘Mikerevic to send his remarks today’, Glas Srpske pg 3 ‘Letter writes suspension’ – At yesterday’s meeting in Banjaluka, officials of the Republika Srpska Government and European Commission agreed that RS Government will today officially send remarks it has on the proposed draft BiH Law on public procurement. Accordingly, EC would consider the possibility of incorporating them into the draft law. Renzo Daviddi, Head of Economic and Political Department of European Commission, said that: “If we fail to reach agreement, we will terminate the project.”\n\nBHTV 1 – Renzo David stated that EU was ready to reconsider the objections posed by the RS Government to the Law on Public Acquisitions and bring decision if EC’s reforms oriented project in this field should be resumed. The Project on reform of public acquisitions in BiH and technical assistance of an additional 2 million Euro, planned in the Cards program, for that project has been halted previously halted due to rejection of the RS Government to adopt the Law on Public Procurement, which would put an end to corruption within this field and which is one of the priorities stated in the Feasibility Study. Daviddi announced that he hoped the RS Government was assured that the Law is not attack on Constitution and that misunderstanding appeared after Government’s claims. On the other side, Government claims it is trying to find solution that will be in accordance with the BiH Constitution and entity, adding that they have proper arguments to refuse draft Law.\n\nRTRS – Renzo Daviddi stated he was surprised with the objections of the RS Government, as they representatives worked on the draft Law and added that main principles can’t be changed. RS Prime Minister, Dragan Mikerevic said that RS remarks do not refer to procedure but to the institutionalism and said that current solutions for are unacceptable. “We ask that appeal board is at the RS level and eventually if the bidder is not satisfied that he can launch to administrative procedure, meaning to go before Supreme Court,” said Dragan Mikerevic.\n\nRTRS, Oslobodjenje pg 7 ‘Without youth there is no progress’, Vecernji List pg 4 ‘Young people should be more activated’, Nezavisne Novine pg 21 ‘The youth will lead BiH to Europe’ – Principal Deputy High Representative Donald Hays in Banja Luka on Tuesday met with the youth representatives active in economic and political sectors of society. On the occasion, PDHR said youth was not adequately represented in everyday life, warned they are increasingly passive and that the situation has to improve: “Somehow we have to break through if we’re going to make some significant change.” Hays added that if young people do not join social life than the potential BiH has will not be fully put to use, Hays said after the meeting. This is the first out of a series of similar meetings to take place in order to give young people a chance for their voice to be heard. Sasa Cudic, a delegate in the Council of Peoples and one of the youth that took part in the talks, said that they concluded that greater participation of young people in politics and authorities is needed in the upcoming period in order to ensure a quality and expert way for improving the future of BiH. SNSD Youth representative Ozren Trisic said that young people wished to learn more about opportunities for employment, participation in politics and other structures of life as a way for encouraging young people not to leave BiH. He described as devastating the fact that 70 percent of young peoples are not voting, that 77 percent wish to leave BiH and stressed that it is high time to deal with this situation."
