        "text": "Briefing No 9\n\nSlovenia and the Enlargement of the European Union\n\nThe views expressed in this document are not necessarily those held by the European Parliament as an institution.\n\nIV. RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ENLARGEMENT\n\na) Relations with the EU\n\nCooperation Agreement\n\nOn 1 September 1993 Slovenia assumed the rights and obligations deriving from the Cooperation Agreement concluded with the FSRY in 1980. It had to update the political part of the agreement shortly afterwards, leading to production of a Europe Agreement.\n\nEurope Agreement\n\nOn 10 June 1996, Slovenia signed a Europe Agreement with the EU which replaced the existing Cooperation Agreement with immediate effect. On 15 July 1997, the Europe Agreement was ratified by the Slovenian National Assembly, after an amendment to Article 68 of the Constitution had been adopted, making it possible, after a four-year transitional period, for foreigners to own real estate in Slovenia. The agreement took effect on 1 February 1999.\n\nThe Europe Agreement consists of eleven titles, and can be divided into three main sections. The first section contains the political provisions; the second covers trade between the EU and Slovenia; and the third relates to technical and financial assistance.\n\nThe section on trade gives priority to the harmonisation of legislation in relation to the internal market. The Parties agree to establish a free-trade area between the EU and Slovenia in the next few years.\n\nTrade\n\nThe EU is Slovenia's main trading partner. In 1998, 65.5 % of Slovenia's exports were to the EU, and 69.4 % of its imports were from the EU. Although Slovenia's exports to the EU rose by 12 % on 1997 its trade balance with the EU shows a deficit of EUR 1.5 bn.\n\nSlovenia's main trading partners in the EU are, in descending order, Germany, Italy and France.\n\nSlovenia's exports to the EU break down as follows: machinery and electrical equipment, 22 %; equipment for various modes of transport, 16 %; textile products, 13 %. Its imports from the EU are: machinery and electrical equipment, 25 %; equipment for various modes of transport, 15 %; and base metals, 11 %.\n\nInstitutions\n\nThe Association Council (at Foreign Minister level) is the forum in which the Parties raise certain issues and agree on solutions. Its first meeting took place in Luxembourg on 22 February 1999.\n\nThe Association Committee (composed of senior civil servants) met for the first time on 25 March 1999, in Ljubljana.\n\nThe Joint Parliamentary Committee is composed of Members of the Slovenian Parliament and MEPs. The constituent meeting was held in Strasbourg on 15 and 16 December 1998; the second one took place from 17 to 19 March 1999 in Ljubljana.\n\nPhare\n\nSlovenia receives technical and financial assistance under the PHARE Programme. Between 1992 and 1999 it received a total of EUR 192 million in grants. The programmes are of three types:\n\nThe National PHARE Programme, which in the programme for Slovenia (EUR 31 million) covers the following sectors:\n\nadministration and public institutions, particularly in the fields of agriculture, public finance and financial control; the adoption of legislation on the internal market; support for investment in the environment and transport sectors; education, research and science; the private sector, reconstruction and privatisation; support for social programmes and job creation; and cooperation in the fields of judicial and home affairs (on frontier controls, fighting organised crime, and immigration and visa policy).\n\nThe Cross-Border Cooperation Programme. These programmes aim to increase cross-border cooperation with Austria (EUR 2 million) and Italy (EUR 5 million). A trilateral cooperation project has also been operating with Hungary and Austria since 1995.\n\nThe Multi-Country Programme. Slovenia participates in multi-country programmes to encourage the development of small businesses and infrastructure in the applicant countries.\n\nb) Membership application\n\nOn 10 June 1996, the date on which the Europe Agreement was signed, Slovenia submitted its application for membership of the EU.\n\nPosition of the Commission\n\nIn Agenda 2000, which it presented on 15 July 1997, the Commission recommended that accession negotiations be opened with Slovenia. In the Commission's opinion, Slovenia provides the necessary guarantees for democratic development and respect for human rights. In March 1999 European Commissioner van den Broek announced that he was satisfied with the progress of the enlargement process and the negotiations on accession. The Commission's annual reports confirm that Slovenia is making progress on fulfilling the economic criteria and incorporating the Union's acquis communautaire. These reports also provide an opportunity for the Commission to advise the Slovenian authorities of its criticisms, indicating the priority areas where additional efforts are required.\n\nPosition of the European Parliament\n\nParliament's opinion was the subject of a resolution of 4 December 1997 on Agenda 2000, in which it noted that enlargement of the EU to include the applicant countries represented a further stage in the creation of a united and free Europe.\n\nIts resolution of 15 April 1999 pointed out that Slovenia now had the democratic structures to safeguard the rule of law, and had reached a satisfactory level concerning the economic conditions for accession laid down in Copenhagen. However, it deplored the lack of progress on incorporating the acquis communautaire, particularly in sensitive areas such as justice, home affairs and the internal market. Parliament also drew attention to the need for a serious and through-going reform of the administration and justice system. It expressed its conviction that the Slovenian authorities would be able to recover the accumulated delay.\n\nPosition of the Council and European Council\n\nOn 12-13 December 1997 the Luxembourg European Council decided to launch the accession process on 30 March 1998 with a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the 15 EU Member States, the ten applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Cyprus, by creating a single framework for the applicant countries.\n\nA European Conference was set up, bringing together the EU Member States and the countries eligible to join the EU which shared its values and internal and external objectives. The first meeting took place in London on 12 March 1998, the second in Luxembourg on 5 December that year.\n\nThe Luxembourg European Council instructed the Commission to report annually to the Council, and to submit its recommendations for the bilateral governmental conferences with the applicant countries.\n\nSlovenia's position\n\nPresident Milan Ku√ßan, in the speech he gave on taking office on 22 December 1997, said:\n\n'The invitation to Slovenia to take part in the accession negotiations on EU membership as one of the first group of applicant countries is at present probably the best proof of the success of our policies and of the high degree of credibility of the Slovenian State, its democracy, its economic success and its respect for human rights.'\n\nPrime Minister Janez Drnovsek, speaking at the governmental conference on Slovenia's accession to the EU in Luxembourg on 22 June 1999, said:\n\n'Slovenia hopes to have completed its negotiations and become a full member of the EU by 2002. It also hopes at the same time to fulfil the criteria for monetary union.'\n\nc) Pre-accession strategy\n\nThe pre-accession strategy drawn up by the Commission in consultation with the Council and the European Parliament pursuant to Article 308 of the TEU\n\nThe European Council decided to establish bilateral partnerships in order to bring the applicant countries up to the standards prevailing in the EU as quickly as possible. On 31 March 1998, official accession negotiations began with six bilateral governmental conferences. As part of a new approach introduced by the Helsinki European Council, the other applicant countries have also started their accession negotiations. Conclusion thereof will depend on full compliance with the three Copenhagen criteria: democracy and the rule of law and human rights and the protection of minorities; a functioning market economy; compliance with the obligations of membership.\n\nThe accession partnership\n\nThe Commission has drawn up a partnership for each of the applicant countries, comprising:\n\npriority action areas, as defined in the Commission opinion,\n\nfinancial resources to enable each applicant to implement the priorities,\n\nconditions for implementing the assistance.\n\nIn return it has asked each applicant country to put forward a national programme for adoption of the acquis communautaire, NPAA, with a timetable for priority measures and details of the resources required.\n\nThese documents are reviewed and adapted each year for each of the applicant countries.\n\nOn 15 March 1998 the Commission put to the Council the short- and medium-term priorities which Slovenia should fulfil. After concluding its regular report on 13 October 1999, the Commission also published its proposal for a Council decision on the new principles, priorities, interim objectives and partnership conditions for the accession of the Republic of Slovenia. The Council adopted the decision and updated the two categories of priorities.\n\nShort-term priorities (by the end of 2000)\n\nEconomic reform: restructuring of businesses; first implementation of the privatisation programme in the banking and insurance sectors); implementation of a restructuring programme in the steel industry; further progress with the restructuring of public finance, especially pensions; improving procedures for bankruptcy\n\nInternal market: stronger protection for intellectual and industrial property rights; implementation of framework legislation for the free movement of goods; implementation of anti-trust laws; adoption of a new law on telecommunications; full alignment of the law on the audio-visual sector; closure of duty-free shops at land frontiers\n\nEmployment and industrial relations: preparation of a national strategy for employment; strengthening the bipartite social dialogue\n\nReform of administrative and judicial capacities, particularly concerning the management and scrutiny of EU funds: acceleration of the reform of public administration; further work on the national and rural development programme; adoption of measures to complete the legislative framework for financial control\n\nFurther alignment of legislation on the environment: adoption of a new law on water, completion of detailed programmes for 'directive-by-directive' approximation; and on agriculture: veterinary and plant health sectors\n\nMedium-term priorities\n\nPolitical criteria: further efforts to speed up the restitution of property\n\nEconomic policy: full restructuring, commercialisation and liberalisation of public companies providing local authority services; further reform of the capital market; establishment of an annual budgetary supervision procedure\n\nInternal market: abolition of the 10 % price preference granted to national tenderers; financial market liberalisation and improvement of the law on foreign investment; strengthening the authorities and procedures for the scrutiny of mergers and state subsidies; abolition of persistent divergences between VAT schemes; further progress in alignment of the law on consumer protection\n\nJustice and home affairs: further strengthening of the bodies for curbing and combating organised crime, trafficking in women and children, drugs and corruption and corruption; further gradual alignment of the law and practice on visas with EU law and practice\n\nNuclear safety: maintaining high nuclear safety standards at the Krsko nuclear power plant; implementation standards for oil stocks; preparation for the internal market in energy, particularly directives on gas and electricity\n\nAgriculture: strengthening CAP management measures and associated administrative structures\n\nTransport: alignment in the air, road and sea transport sectors\n\nEmployment and industrial relations: establishing a national economic and social cohesion policy to bring per capita GDP into line with the Community average\n\nEnvironment: implementation of the law on waste management, combating industrial pollution and risk management\n\nStrengthening administrative and judicial capacity and the management of EU funds: improving the operation of the judicial system; adoption of a law on public organisations; strengthening control of public finance\n\nEconomic and social cohesion: establishing a national policy for reducing disparities between regions\n\nSlovenia presented the first version of its national programme for adoption of the acquis communautaire (NPAA) on 30 March 1998. The document identifies priorities in line with those of the accession partnership, although Slovenia only lists short-term priorities. The Slovenian Government adopted the new version of the national programme, in response to comments by the Commission and incorporating the objectives for the period 1999 to 2002, on 27 May 1999; it went to the Slovenian Parliament in April and was presented to the Commission on 31 May 1999.\n\nThe Commission appreciated the fact that objectives are properly identified in the amended NPAA. However, it criticised the Slovenian authorities for not clearly defining the arrangements and timetable for their implementation.\n\nThe NPAA, says the Commission, is the central and essential document for the accession process, and it will be reviewed at the end of each year and presented to Parliament at the same time as the budget proposal, to ensure consistency between the two documents and incorporate the recommendations in the Commission's regular report.\n\nA further review of the programme incorporating the recommendations set out in the latest Commission report was put to the Slovenian Parliament for approval in late 1999.\n\nScreening\n\nA 'selective' review began with the official opening of accession negotiations in March 1998. The process involves a chapter-by-chapter scrutiny of progress in adopting the acquis communautaire, to ascertain any problems that might make a transitional period necessary and to open final negotiations as soon as a common position is adopted by the applicant country and the European Union Member States. A total of 31 chapters have to be scrutinised.\n\nIt also involves ascertaining whether a compatible legislative process already exists or will need to be set up and investigating the administrative capacity of each applicant country to adopt the acquis.\n\nIn the case of Slovenia (and the other 'first wave' countries), ten out of 15 chapters have been completed and do not require further negotiation. They include: research and science; teaching and education; culture; small businesses; company law; consumer and health protection; the customs union; external trade relations and telecommunications.\n\nAt the Intergovernmental Conference in Brussels from 30 September to 4 November 1999 a further eight chapters were due for negotiation, including: economic and monetary union, the free movement of capital, social and employment policy, energy, free movement of services, transport, the environment and taxation policy.\n\nThe EU foreign ministers and those of some of the applicant countries met in Brussels on 7 December 1999 for a further round of negotiations.\n\nOne of the Portuguese Presidency's stated objectives is to open as many as negotiating chapters as possible so as to speed up the pace of talks under the French Presidency in the second half of 2000. According to the Slovenian authorities, the negotiations should be concluded in late 2001 so that accession could take place on 1 January 2002.\n\nPre-accession aid\n\nIn addition to the PHARE Programme, which is itself geared to the accession priorities there will be extra pre-accession aid, the amount of which will double in the period 2000-2006. It will include aid for agriculture and rural development (the Sapard instrument) and a structural instrument (ISPA) to benefit similar measure for the cohesion funds in the environment and transport sectors. The financial aid for the period 2000-2002 will be allocated as follows: PHARE, EUR 25 million a year; aid for agriculture and rural development, EUR 6.6 million a year; structural instrument, between EUR 10 and 20 million a year.\n\nThe programme must observe the principle of equal treatment between applicant countries. The PHARE Programme is based on two priority objectives: strengthening of administrative and judicial capacity (about 30 % of the total); and investment for adopting the acquis communautaire (70 %). Slovenia, like the other applicant countries, also participates in some Community programmes, on education, training and research, and in some Community agencies.\n\nd) Slovenia's progress towards accession\n\nIn December 1998 the Commission submitted a report on the applicant countries' progress towards accession. It followed this up with a second report published on 13 October 1999. For the purpose of its assessment the Commission collected a large amount of information, including reports produced by Parliament.\n\nEach country is assessed on the same criteria; each country's application will proceed at its own pace.\n\nThe assessment takes account of political and economic criteria and other accession requirements, such as the EMU and CFSP objectives. It examines the situation with adoption of the acquis sector by sector and considers the country's administrative and judicial capacity for implementing the acquis.\n\nThe Commission's first assessment prompted discussion at the first meeting of the MPC on 15-16 December 1998. This said that a wider political consensus was needed in Slovenia to speed up the legislative reform, and that it should improve its administrative capacity.\n\nThe report in 1999 confirmed that Slovenia met the Copenhagen political criteria and the two main economic criteria, the existence of a market economy and an ability to face the competitive pressure and market forces in the EU.\n\nThe Commission's second assessment reviewed Slovenia's efforts to make good the deficiencies pinpointed in the first. Thus the Commission says that:\n\nthe process of transferring additional powers to local authorities had been concluded following the elections of 22 November 1998;\n\nSlovenia had shown further goodwill by adopting the laws on the banking system, exchange transactions and fiscal reform;\n\nthe government and representatives of the employers and trade-union organisations had reached agreement on reform of the pensions system.\n\nOn adoption of the acquis, Slovenia had appreciably speeded up its efforts, by adopting laws:\n\non the internal market (in the field of standards and certification);\n\non data protection;\n\non the liberalisation of capital, the banking sector and shares (a good many restrictions that previously limited activity by foreign companies in Slovenia have been lifted);\n\nin the field of justice and home affairs (laws on foreigners and the right of asylum; measures to fight organised crime and corruption);\n\nin the field of employment and industrial relations;\n\non the environment (water, air, waste management);\n\non customs (amending the law in line with current EU standards).\n\nHowever, as the previous year, the Commission drew attention to the slowness in harmonising Slovenian law with the acquis communautaire, and the slowness of the judicial process. The legislative reform is still not up to cruising speed, although some measures were taken in March 1999 to ease the adoption of the laws laid down in the national programme for adoption of the acquis.\n\nThe Commission says Slovenia has made little progress on\n\ngeneral reform of public administration and the judiciary;\n\nthe restitution of property;\n\nthe situation of the Romanian minority, which remains a problem, in spite of the government's efforts to improve living standards for this section of the population.\n\nSlovenia must:\n\ncontinue the structural reform of its economy, placing the emphasis on privatising public assets, particularly with the two state banks,\n\nimprove the legal environment of companies,\n\nput in place the legal framework for state aids.\n\nSlovenia has completed most of the short-term priorities in the partnership for accession, but there are still some gaps to fill:\n\nin the fields of banking and insurance,\n\nconcerning its administrative and judicial capacity (adoption of a law on public service, land registry and financial control).\n\nThe Slovenians agree with the Commission about their lack of efficiency in public administration. They are expecting a great deal from twinning programmes with the Member States' administrations, as proposed by the Commission in its pre-accession strategy.\n\nThe Commission is due to submit the next Regular Report in November 2000.\n\nSources: Documents cited by the Commission and the European Parliament\n\nAgence Europe\n\nLe Monde\n\nhttp://www.sigov.si/\n\nhttp://www.gov.si\n\nhttp://www.evropa.gov.si/\n\nAnnexes\n\nANNEX 1\n\nMembers of the Slovenian government formed in 1997\n\n(The composition of the government changed in May 2000 and elections were due to take place in October 2000)\n\nPrime Minister Dr Janez Drnovsek First Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for inter-ministry coordination Marjan Podobnik Minister for Financial Affairs Mitja Gaspari, MA Minister for Internal Affairs Borut Suklje Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Dimitrij Rupel Minister for Justice Tomaz Marusic Minister for Defence Dr Franci Demsar Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Anton Rop, MA Minister for Economic Relations and Development Dr Marjan Senjur Minister for Economic Affairs Dr Tea Petrin Minister for Agriculture Ciril Smrkolj Minister for SMEs and Tourism Janko Razgorsek Minister for Culture Jozef Skolc Minister for the Environment Dr Pavel Gantar Minister for Transport Anton Bergauer, MSc Minister for Education Dr Pavel Zgaga Minister for Health Dr Marjan Jereb Minister for Science and Technology Dr Lojze Marincek Minister responsible for coordination on social affairs Bozo Grafenauer, MA Minister responsible for European Affairs Igor Bavcar\n\nANNEX 2\n\nMain economic indicators 1995-2000\n\nReal growth rate (%)199519961997199819992000 Estimate GNP4.13.54.63.93.5-4.0 (*)4.0 Structure in terms of value added - %: Agriculture and fisheries (A+B)4.64.54.34.04.03.9 Industry (C+D+E+F)38.538.538.238.638.538.4 Industry excl. construction (C+D+E)33.432.832.532.832.331.9 Construction (F)5.15.75.75.86.26.4 Services (G...O)59.259.559.859.759.960.0 FISIM-2.3-2.5-2.3-2.4-2.3-2.3 GNP per capita (USD)9,4319,4809,1639,84710,00410,958 GNP by purchasing power per capita (USD)12,50013,20014,10014,800 Unemployment rate (ILO)7.47.37.47.97.5 (2)7.5 Productivity3.34.45.13.93.33.2 Retail prices, annual average12.69.79.17.96.26.2 International trade - balance of payments Exports of goods and services6.93.510.06.83.64.5 Exports of goods8.13.311.48.44.65.3 Exports of services1.74.44.30.0-0.80.6 Imports of goods and services (4)15.11.69.99.77.25.1 Imports of goods15.61.59.910.47.45.6 Imports of services11.62.510.05.15.72.0 Current account balance (USD millions)-22.839.036.6-3.8 Average exchange rate, SIT/USD118.5135.4159.7166.1180.5182.0 Foreign currency reserves (USD millions)3,4264,1244,3774,7674,178 (5) External debt (USD millions)2,9704,0104,1764,9595,584 (6)\n\nSources of data: SORS, BS, MF, IMAD estimates.\n\nNotes:\n\n(*) national accounts assessments made on the assumption of 3.75% real GDP growth\n\n( 1) letters in brackets denote the statistical classification of activities NACE Rev. 1.,\n\n(2) third quarter 1999,\n\n( 3) retail prices as a measure of inflation until 1998, after 1998 consumer price index,\n\n(4) balance of payments statistics (exports F.O.B., imports F.O.B.), inter-currency changes and price changes on foreign markets eliminated by calculating real rates,\n\n(5) November 1999,\n\n(6) September 1999."
