        "text": "PETROL, COCKTAILS, AND WAKEFIELD:\n\nTHE PASSIONS OF SLOVENE\n\nWhat do the Slovenians think about English words in business names? This:\n\nIn Slovene, the role of the prefix \"inter-\" is occupied by \"med-\", e.g. mednarodni (international).\n\nZJRS 17 does not affect Slovenia's supermarket chain Interspar. They did not want to be Medspar. It might be successfully argued in a non-Anglophone legislature that Interspar means nothing, equally in all languages. Spar is the international trademark of a Dutch company.\n\nSo far so good. The name Interspar belongs to a special class, a superlanguage. Companies don't complain when they become generic, like a hoover. Losing the capital letter means they've won.\n\nFor reasons less clear, the company Petrol (spoken with a dramatic stress on the second syllable) shows no sign of offering equal billing to Bencin. Petrol was already a thing, before the company. But not in Slovenia or Slovene.\n\nPetrol, like skiing and casinos, is absent from the 1962 Slovenski Pravopis, my reference guide to the inauthenticity of words trying to bluff their way into the Slovene lexicon.\n\nTraditional stalwart Slovene terms, such as \"cocktail\" and \"cross-country\", have always been with us.\n\nBut there has been a progressive dilution of Slovenian culture by words, words with no right to be hanging around causing progress.\n\nIt all began innocently enough.\n\nIt is quickly apparent Petrol's debut in the 2001 Pravopis is the firm, not the product itself. [55]\n\nAnd so it has remained up to the present [56]\n\nWith the Pravopis's propensity for esoteric random walks with proper nouns - 1962's Wagner and Wall Street are joined by Wakefield and a decapitalised wehrmacht - Petrol's promotion to iconic brand in 2001 might be philologically tolerable. But no edition to the present day claims petrol-with-a-small-p is bencin.\n\nWas Petrol-with-a-big-P simply prescient in registering its unusually generic but alien moniker?\n\nIn a testament to Slovenian obstinacy, Petrol d.o.o.'s long slog since its 1953 brand grab has been unsuccessful in persuading either drivers or lexicographers to equate the proper noun brand with its common noun product.\n\nFrom 1947-53 it was called Jugopetrol, so they dodged a couple of bullets there.\n\nFor the locals, small-p-petrol remains a foreign word, inappropriate to the gassing up process, which takes place using the bencinska 훾rpalka, at a bencinska postaja.\n\nBig Petrol has somehow failed to convince the autochthons, while for Slovene learners its brand is a false friend, a cultural anomaly.\n\nNo question, the firm's inclusion since the 2001 Pravopis confers a status Esso or Shell have yet to equal. Has Big P been trying to become the hoover of car juice pumping?\n\nTheir livery doesn't say BENCIN, but this unpatriotic behaviour is excused by ZJRS 34(2). The ZJRS, passed into force under the government of Anton Rop, did not appear until 2004, with no retrospective effect.\n\nYou cannot now start a company called, say, The Petrol People, without giving \"Bencinski Ljudje\" equal or greater prominence.\n\nAnd good luck to PETROL, really. For trying to commandeer a word it turned out Slovenians were quite resilient to anyway, in the same way UK people resist calling petrol gas.\n\nAs Petrol, along with the Empire State Building and polaroid-with-a-small-p made their 2001 debut, Wakefield slipped quietly away, a crazy crush about whose Slovenian origins we can only speculate. But Coventry has remained steadfast in the Pravopis for sixty years or more.\n\nBut a Pandora's karton of plo훾evinke 훾rvov has been opened, exposing a Slovenian business community that should cower in shame (according to fans of the language), and pray for forgiveness.\n\nBy 2022 nearly a third of mednarodni companies had been mesmerised by an almost irresistible foreign force into calling themselves \"International\", often instead, instead of as well.\n\nAnd there was worse to come, as a diligent citizen spotted 50% of the capital's 5-star hotels hadn't even bothered to do a website in Slovene, and went ballistic.\n\nAs demonstrators fought riot police with tear gas and water cannons on the streets of Ljubljana, a market inspector finally delivered a warning to the errant hotelier.\n\nBut there appeared no equally huge sign saying \"MEDCELINSKO\" - there's no lawyering your way out of this one, surely? Determined journalists kept banging away about the website, demanding fines, order in the land etc., but it seems the question of Article 17 never came up.\n\nHow could the Market Inspector ignore a violation visible across town? Because although the hotel is only a few years old, the Intercontinental Hotel Group trademarked INTERCONTINENTAL, under No. 890,271, first used in 1948, and dating from April 29, 1970, and INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS AND RESORTS, under No. 2,005,852, first used in February 1995 and dating from October 8, 1996.\n\nWoe betide the small entrepreneur who dares trying to call his firm \"Intercontinental Hrana\" or \"Intercontinental Potovanja\". Not because of IHG's trademark, but because of the ZJRS. This has not been tested in Slovenia, not even by Intercontinental Hotels Group (a franchise operator).\n\nThe media are in on the game too!\n\nReporter, a word of Latin (reportare: carry back) then French origin, is not in the Slovenski Pravopis 1962.\n\nMy blood boiled when I realised the publisher was not Novinarski Mediji, as it seemed I should have the legal right to expect, but that the sinister-sounding Reporter Media d.o.o., had managed to slip through the cracks by Slovenia altering its language again, only this time with a common noun.\n\nBut why did he do this?\n\nAlthough the 1962 Slovenski Pravopis was quick to spot the value of the lastest modern foreign influences, \"reporter\" didn't make it in until 2001. [52]\n\nBut the language academy did not change the rules enough, as \"media\", like \"intercontinental\" remains foreign and out of bounds in Slovenian business nomenclature, even in 2022. [53]\n\nMORE NEW WORDS: BETTER OR WORSE?\n\nAnother interesting example is \"wellness\", which in the youth of some yet alive was a word which \"sounded strange and unnecessary\" [60].\n\nAlthough an old word, once thought a nonce-word, it had fallen out of favour. In everyday use, all we had or needed back in the 20th century were \"health\" and \"well-being\".\n\nWellness was recast in the 1970s to sell things. After \"health foods\" and \"health clubs\", merchants of more peripheral contributions, such as health plans and health candles, could gain little traction selling something people had come to take for granted as a basic human right.\n\nThe resurrected wellness was more flexible, and no longer meant merely \"state of being well or in good health\" as it had since the 1650s.\n\nThis more schmoozy, woolly, wellness has galumphed ahead, beating some other foreign concepts into the lexicon, such as signwriting and level crossings - which, like egg on toast, aren't a thing in Slovenia.\n\nWellness suits the capitalist medical model because it suggests something EXTRA. And anyone - not just doctors - can sell it.\n\nFor reasons like these, an allegedly illegal tsunami (rare in the Med, this became a Slovene word in 2001) is washing a tide of foreign filth over the shifting sands of lawful language, carrying Slovenia's alternately apoplectic and apoptotic language fans away.\n\nThese linguistic vandals came from all strata of society. Thus, ZJRS Article 20 demands that \"Public warning signs, written or spoken instructions, information and announcements in the Republic of Slovenia are in Slovenian\" and \"it must be possible to choose the Slovenian language and the Slovenian alphabet must be taken into account.\"\n\nA search of the business register reveals four companies are \"sporting\". Only one is \"혳porting\", and one is both. But only your eyes, not the AJPES database, can tell you this.\n\nWhich is a shame for detectives hunting for Article 17 violators among the 8535 identical results for \"sport\" and \"혳port\". There is no sport in the Pravopis.\n\nIt's the same story for all 181463 business names containing 혳 or s, the 49360 containing 혷 or z, and the 21231 containing 훾 or c. They cannot be separated by the user. It's as if AJPES is trying to destroy Slovenia's alphabet.\n\nThus the facility responsible for upholding the law on the Slovene language in the business sphere is immune to Slovene language enquiries and, I'm guessing, a fine under ZJRS 20.\n\nConsequently it is impossible to expose Slovenia's betrayal by a web of illegal 혳port language users without a tedious export and analysis of the AJPES data. This is what Slovenians pay their taxes for.\n\nHow 혳port (Latin portare: \"get carried away\", mentally, in a fun sense; Old French: desporter) acquired its 혳 (sh) upon its return from the West is unclear.\n\nWhy does sport need a sh? Did Slovenia think look, we've got this letter here, let's make sport more Slovenian? The only connection seems to be drinking. Deutsch might be involved - and drinking.\n\n\"혡tudent\" is a similar example, but unlike sport, \"student\" with an alveolar hissing sibilant crept into the lexicon sometime after the 2001 Pravopis. This drier student has no great following on AJPES.\n\nA visual inspection of 100 sporting records yielded a 12% \"sport\"-only rate. 7025 of the 8535 with 혳port/sport contain a Slovene adjectival \"혳portn-\" giving a second estimate suggesting a theoretical limit of 17.69% non-compliance. But no data-wrangling methodology is reliable, due to the AJPES computer's ZJRS-20-proof alphabet.\n\nA third estimate based on a Slovene media corpus revealed exactly 6000 results for \"sport\" and 46924 for \"혳port\" [68], giving an 11.34% to 88.66% split. These queries expire so you'll need to re-enter them yourself.\n\nBy contrast only 87 Trendi results were obtained from three years' worth of Slovenian journalism concerning \"te훾aj sloven혳훾ine\" [68] - presumably not for foreigners. Slovenians had 608 times as many chances to read about sport/혳port than this.\n\nIn the same period there were 41 hits for \"Slovene\".\n\nBut for \"Slovene language\", \"Slovene lessons\", \"teaching [of] Slovene\", and \"Slovene course\" there were zero each.\n\nAnd for \"learn Slovene\" there was 1. The Slovenian media or medija's sole point of contact with the promotion of Slovene for Anglophones turns out to be \"Dave from Ireland\" [71].\n\nDave's Irishness is corny, and with its own voicing characteristics Irish English is an odd choice for a base language to superimpose, as though the chief goal in any course for Anglophones is to produce what Slovene sounds like spoken by an Irishman. Neither of the couple's accents are a positive help.\n\nDave is super-determined, which is just as well considering the three minutes available. But there was no Dave from 2005-2020 on the internet, only people taking the mick. See extra notes on Dave.\n\nAside from its problem with the alphabet it has been smoother sailing at AJPES, as for the first time, the extent of the catastrophic English Plague swarming uncontrollably in Slovenian offices, across industrial estates, through our fields is revealed.\n\nOffending firms include many who misrepresent the phonemes used in Slovene, including: hard C or CK instead of K; CH, SH/SI/TI and DG/G/J instead of 훻 and 혡 and 혦; PH instead of F; wide A instead of EJ; long I instead of AJ; consonant-type Y instead of J; X instead of KS; they also include letters or compounds which may be silent in English or unpronounceable in Slovene: TH, EE, OE, OI, OO, OU, OW, OY, G, H, WHATMOUGH, and so on.\n\nArticle 18 of the ZJRS assures us that \"words in a foreign language may be used on behalf of an establishment, shop, catering and other premises or other business premises if they mean an internationally used term for an individual type of business premises, if they contain a foreign trademark or service mark or in the case of shorter phrases which, due to their normal use, are comprehensible to the majority of consumers, provided that they form an integral part of the corporate image.\"\n\nWhat English word isn't an internationally used term? The business names which are cases of \"storitveno znamko ali 훾e gre za kraj혳e besedne zveze, ki so zaradi obi훾ajne rabe razumljive ve훾ini potro혳nikov, 훾e predstavljajo sestavni del celostne podobe\" were examined in search of a pattern - but without any data on name applications rejected by AJPES as too foreign.\n\nThe colour-coded list of de facto non-offending words shows in descending colour priority (and as far as possible without naming names) companies without mirror names whose names contain words:\n\n- that are not in the latest Slovenski Pravopis [54] and so potentially illegal\n\n- in the latest, but not the 2001 Pravopis [57] so may have been illegal in the past\n\n- that are not in the 1962 Pravopis\n\n- in the 2001 Pravopis but not before or since\n\n- that are potentially not-well-enough-known, associated with the lead word in registered names; priority is given to singletons not otherwise listed\n\nNames remaining in white are innocent, on the grounds of being in the official lexicon for at least six decades.\n\nOther colour highlighting:\n\n- English/Slovene prevalence AJPES search: counts stringA-(stringA and stringB) compared to stringB-(stringA and stringB)\n\n- Legal tips and notes to help you navigate Slovenia's business-naming minefield.\n\n...But remember, you'll still be illegal for not speaking Slovene, whatever name you pick.\n\nAs of mid-2022 the AJPES Register contained as many as:\n\n1884 firms with \"Marketing\", compared to 872 with \"tr혷enje\" and 45 with both\n\n1746 firms with \"Invest(ment/ing/or/s)\", including 1 \"Accord\", 1 \"Bay\", 1 \"Correct\" and compounds *\n\n1024 firms with \"Sport(ing/s)\" and compounds- low 12% estimate, true S:혡 ratio disguised by illegal system!\n\n766 firms with \"Trad(es/er/ers/ing)\", including 1 \"Aliens\", 1 \"Compare\"\n\n685 firms with \"Group\", compared to 511 with \"skupin-\" and 6 with both\n\n481 firms with \"Media\" and compounds, compared to 22 \"Medija-\" and 0 with both\n\n467 firms with \"Design\", compared to 2563 with \"Oblikovanje\", 126 with \"Dizajn\" and 0 with all three\n\n441 firms with \"Team\", compared to 393 \"Tim\", the 2 with both are people called Tim\n\n423 firms with \"Art(ist/istic/s)\", including \"CorkArt\"\n\n318 firms with \"International\", compared to 691 with \"Mednarod-\" and 29 with both\n\n262 firms with \"Management\",compared to 1387 with \"Upravljanj-\" and 17 with both\n\n257 firms with \"Solution(s)\", including 1 \"Structured\", 1 \"Measuring\", 1 \"Allied\" and more\n\n246 firms with \"Pizz(a/e/eria)\" and compounds\n\n234 firms with \"Top\"\n\n217 firms with \"Consult(ing/ant/s)\", compared to 24172 \"Svetova-\" and 382 with both\n\n216 firms with \"Car(s)\" -

No firm calls itself a \"language school\". Three call themselves a \"tutor\". Five entities mention \"Education\" but none of these are language teaching.\n\nThey are apparently quite sure their potential clients - perhaps still contemplating their invasion of Slovenia from afar - are really looking for the 121 firms offering \"instrukcij-\" or \"pou훾evanj-\".\n\nOr somewhat more probably, firms offering \"instruction\", or \"lessons\"? Of which there were zero. Alone among the teachers, \"TEaching Autogenic Training\" - which with its weird capital may be trying to avoid looking English, perhaps hopes to deal with aching, or spell TEAT.\n\nAnd why are the only four entities offering \"class(es)\" of any kind TV repairmen, an \"A-Class\" sports society, and a \"Class Car Rentals\" and not, given the opportunity of enthusiastically reaching out to the foreigner in his own tongue, actual Slovene classes?\n\nDoes it seem like the Slovene teachers want their potential customers to notice them at all, or that they are trying to avoid them?\n\nIs there some trauma, putting them off telling us about all this interesting secret language stuff? Is this why foreign visitors to sites such as [89] have to rely on browser translations?\n\nIs it something they will only attempt if nothing else is available workwise? Or is Slovenia just chronically introverted?\n\nThe Complainant asked two translators about the firm's Slovene-teaching experiences. They don't do it any more. Why not? It was too hard. Translation and interpreting is a much easier dollar.\n\nAll the pupils started out bright-eyed and enthusiastic, but gave up after a few hours.\n\nIt was soul-destroying confronting this failure over and over. Both agreed teaching Slovene was the worst job in the world.\n\nNSMTs might assume anyone clever enough to teach Slovene must be clever enough to know the applicant for a course to Level A1 isn't going to understand a leaflet about language courses in Slovene. [96]\n\nIn fact the Slovene classes in Slovene leaflet is not a joke. The teachers would object to the quick conclusion that they are incredibly dumb.\n\nThe Complainant therefore asserts that the non-translation is not a momentary oversight, nor a systemic accident, nor incredibly dumb, but rather the manufacture of The Sixty Euro Problem on an industrial scale.\n\nThe outcome of this clumsy interface suits the Slovenians and what they want, because:\n\n- when it comes to foreigners, a thousand translations are better than one - for Slovenians improving the foreign language, e.g. English\n\n- some money transactions might be created by translation during the attempt to apply\n\n- volunteers of varying degrees of helpfulness help each foreigner translate each leaflet, damping down any group perception of entitlement or standardisation.\n\n- hours of time are created where foreigners have to sit in bars, and where the transfer of free educative value will align around the Sixty Euro Problem.\n\n- local lowlife can find out when you're out, by listening in, or from drunk gossip\n\n- the obstacles and dependency created for foreigners are maximized, harming their interests\n\n- keeps an eye on those foreign types known for their troublemaking ways\n\n- after your big meeting and night out to discuss the leafet, your actual speaking of Slovene can be postponed until next time\n\n- the volunteer helper is not responsible for any misunderstandings, such as \"the course doesn't really exist\"\n\n- to prove that a professional translator messed it up, and that you were materially damaged, you would need another translator.\n\nThe relative pro- and anti- indicators for each of four scenarios are presented.\n\nDespite some entitlement being a fact of The Law, all such conveyances in Slovenia have to be conducted as if you are on your knees receiving the Eucharist. It's not their fault if you didn't know to tell them what they are meant to do. At the bureaucratic interface, poor Slovene and shrugging embrace in a symbiotic uselessness.\n\nThe multiplication of the Complainant's problems began and remains located between the attempt to acquire the language itself, and Slovenia's determination to prevent everything with windy jobs-in-the-middle for everyone...but a non-existent result, and no survival mechanism for him.\n\nFor sure the foreigner and his Slovene helper will feel let down when, for example, a Slovene class turns out not to exist for a particular type of foreigner, although the law says nothing about why this should be so.\n\nLet down like [79] and the Complainant. But the contentment of apparatchiks is apparently expendable in the battle to protect the language from being found out about.\n\nOn the plus side, and without prejudging any legal outcomes, Slovenia's freedom government will be able to collect millions in fines from these often repeat offenders. Just 25 big hits and Slovenia will have earned a cool million euros from its anti-foreignness law.\n\nThe only fly in the ointment is the part of the law that says a business shall be registered with AJPES if it complies with the dual language conditions, making all of Slovenia's illegal business names the fault of no one but the registering officials - which is impossible.\n\nBut whose fault it was doesn't make the names any more or less legal. Businesses angry at the not-Slovenian-enough names they have been allowed to register and use, with all the expense of websites, signage, stationery, trademarks and goodwill lost, might be able to sue AJPES or its agents for placing them in this illegal position - by ignoring its own applicable legislation on an industrial scale.\n\nIf the government wins the legal argument and collects the fines, the Complainant hopes this will compensate Slovenia for all the tax he has been prohibited from paying by the ZJRS, and its administrative practices.\n\nThese foreign words threaten what Slovenia is, the rock upon which the nation is founded, namely a language foreigners don't get to learn from the only people who speak it.\n\nThe Complainant believes the business space is richer for the freedom to use any language in a fun or thought-provoking way, alongside the usual corporate cliches. The duration of his claim will conclude with the repeal of ZJRS 14, 17 and 32.\n\nThe Complainant has not been, nor would be, fazed by a Slovenian-run firm in England with a Slovenian name. What would you call your steakhouse? steOK? It's next to the German laundrette: Ein, Zwei, Dry, her French husband's plumbing shop M'Sewer Loo-La-La, and Ali the Barber.\n\nThat Slovenians enjoy English and can have fun with it too is of course part of their freedom of expression. If other Slovenians are offended by it they can go and shop at Rit instead.\n\nSlovenia having actually legislated against such merriment as independent business allows is simultaneously the funniest and saddest European story.\n\nParticularly egregious, if you believe anyone could be so utterly paranoid and fun-hating to actually have laws controlling foreign words, are the examples which take the empirically indefensible leap of using letters absent from the Slovenian Alphabet entirely: Q, W, X, and Y.\n\nHanging around with these bad characters, whose each occurrence is marked with a * in the list, arguably guarantees that anti-Slovenian treachery is afoot.\n\nDo not worry. Nothing drastic is going to happen to these firms just because a foreigner says so.\n\nEspecially a foreigner. As Marko Snoj explains:\n\n\"훻e je dejavnost opisana kot interior design, 훾e na trgovini pi혳e npr. Come In WE ARE OPEN, 훾e izlo혷bo krasi modra misel A healthy outside starts from the inside, ali 훾e ROCCO Night Club ogla혳a LESBO SHOW, to morda res zlahka razume ve훾ina slovenskih potro혳nikov, a ker ni tega nih훾e empiri훾no preveril, je trditev arbitrarna, posledi훾no vpra혳ljiva, zato je vpra혳ljiva tudi skladnost z zakonom teh in takih predstavitev dejavnosti.\" [61]\n\nSnoj - who I suspect instantly abandons all hope of communicating in Slovene when he meets an Anglophone - \"inspected the visual linguistic landscape of Nazorjeva ulica, a street in the centre of Ljubljana. The result of the sample inspection shows that among 107 linguistic signs of that particular public space, at least 31% are not written in Slovene.\"\n\nHe refers to another wordy plan for the upholding of the language landscape, which was examined in a questionnaire, leading to the discovery that 96% of the respondents thought there was too much non-Slovenian-ness going on. Inclusion of the language landscape in the survey was\n\n\"due to frequent complaints regarding the non-Slovenianness of public inscriptions by language users.\" [58]\n\nIndeed it seems improbable that Aha훾i훾 et al will be satisfied with anything less than 100% racial purity in the linguistic landscape, one in which the Law has proved a reckless groundskeeper, and a blunt instrument more Turneresque than Capability Brown, apart from the ha-ha. [62]\n\nBut neither their lengthy charter of aims nor their elaborately legislated committee activities reveal where the Complainant's language lessons went.\n\nArticle 17 is a paper tiger, with let-outs in Article 18 and 34(2). If all the above Anglophone constructions are common enough international parlance to escape restriction (and I had to look up a couple of them) Slovenia's English is pretty damned impressive.\n\nBut for whom then, if not these firms, is ZJRS 17 intended?\n\nThe answer is: anyone someone doesn't like.\n\nJust as Slovenia's statistics are for counting things that Slovenia can use to make itself look good, which less than life-and-death laws apply depend upon dislike or hatred for the victim.\n\nIn the resulting snoopfest, everything the enemy of the people owns or does becomes an outrage overnight, and you will be hounded by \"citizen jealonists\" making shrill appeals to the parking rule of law. In Slovenia the line between chaff-deploying political journalism and upholding civilisation is represented in the form of a snitching match.\n\nTheological in origin but thoroughbred in Yugotopia, Slovenia's national bird is the tell-tale-tit [98]. To make it \"fair\", everyone gets caught for something, somehow devaluing the whole idea - so it's back to the original sin, atonement-unto-God-alone, and indulgences for sale, in these superstitious, anti-difference, and anti-Lutheran parts [80]. A large part of \"justice\" is led by revenue, plunder, and spite - not by morality, equal accountability, or equality of arms. Slovenia's interpreters are relentlessly pro-Slovenian, leading to an interesting effect.\n\nSuppose Mr Novak wants to sell more trainers. There are are simply no more savings, no more customers, nothing more in the valley to be had. By analysing his rivals' language crimes he can simply snitch on their bad language and let the system do the rest.\n\nMr Novak's defenceless competitor Miss Goody-Two-Shoes will at the very least be diverted from profitable activities, and according to this Slovenian economic model, any negative consequences to her benefit Mr Novak.\n\nPublicity will ensure her clientele are alerted to her shameful anti-Slovenian beliefs, and express their outrage by buying Mr Novak's inferior trainers, which have been touched by black people.\n\nRule of Law? Even if it wasn't sport - which is Teflon-like to criminality - none of these firms will meet with a crippling financial intervention unless some faction or other wants it to.\n\nAnd why should anything happen to anyone for this? Despite providing the legal framework the Ministry of Culture and the public agree is the best compromise, the ZJRS has gotten Slovenia two things: confused and nowhere.\n\nBecause what someone calls their firm is literally nobody else's business. It is political jobsworth gone mad, encouraging a societal snitch-fest.\n\nBesides political enemies, are foreigners a priority when it comes to whose illegality Slovenia gets excited about?\n\nWhen \"횜sterreichische Post entered the Slovenian market at the beginning of July [2022] and established the subsidiary company Express One Slovenia for this purpose\" [95] the Market Inspector was off like a rocket by the start of August. The registered name is Express Post SI, but \"Slovenija/Slovenia\" are special words requiring permission.\n\nSlovenia cannot allow its citizens to believe that letters are being successfully delivered by Slovenia, even if the employees and vehicles are all Slovenian registered. Importantly for the selection of this economic target, our friends in the north 횜sterreichische Post can afford the fine.\n\nFor sure, the other 476 registered entities trying to live off Slovenia or Slovenija's good reputation - from the European Commission Representation in the Republic of Slovenia, to the Motoristi훾ni klub Blue Knights Slovenia I - all asked for and received the go-ahead from AJPES, and will remain undisturbed even if they didn't.\n\nWhile being offended by foreigners speaking other languages is different to being offended by foreign signs and foreign business names, the purpose of the foregoing is not to challenge the already failed attempt of Article 17 to put some kind of fence around language, but to put ZJRS 14 into context.\n\nIf Slovenia understands all these words, why then does it need an Article 14, except to discriminate on a superficially rational, but actually very divisive and prejudicial basis? With, due to teacher/pupil ratios, the Sixty Euro Problem, and a general apathy or non-performance of the avowed aims of Article 13 or the language institute, no hope of a solution.\n\nIn the wider legal context this excursion into reality shows that people pay no attention to laws which are plainly stupid, or unfairly disadvantageous to them.\n\nBut where there is jealousy, rivalry, racism or other prejudice present, a dangerous situation is created by too many extra laws, on Slovenian-ness among other topics.\n\nIn which, using the overreach and pedanticism of the authority, the worst temperaments of the mob can be leveraged against individuals who are simply being themselves, using the bad law and a victimless \"crime\" as an excuse.\n\nIntrinsically divisive laws find their target in those who want their neighbour's cow to die. Just because."
