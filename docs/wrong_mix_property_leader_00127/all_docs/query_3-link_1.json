        "text": "This book is intended to provide a quick guide to the field of pediatric retina. It has been long accepted that retinal disorders in children differ from those in adults. Although there are plenty of published books on retinal diseases, most of them only cover adult retinal disorders. Therefore, information on pediatric retinal diseases is urgently needed.\n\nThe book combines comprehensive information with rich illustrations to offer readers an in-depth understanding of the two main themes: retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and other pediatric vitreoretinal disorders. World-renowned pediatric retina experts share their insights and research findings in areas such as ROP, familiar exudative vitreoretinopathy, Coats disease, retinoblastoma, congenital x-linked retinoschisis and hereditary retinal diseases. Topics concerning modern and future medicine such as tele-screening for ROP, E-learning for ROP, and deep learning for ROP are also included.\n\nDesigned to help readers understand the contents as quickly as possible, the book includes many useful tips and pearls, as well as easy-to-follow figures. It covers the majority of pediatric retinal diseases and offers essential information on their diagnosis and management. In addition, relevant and up-to-date references are provided for those who want to explore the topics in more depth. As such, the book offers an excellent reference guide to caring for these young patients."
