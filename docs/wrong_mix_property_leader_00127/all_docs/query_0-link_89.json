        "text": "🌟 EAGxUtrecht 2024: What a Weekend! 🌟 Wow! We're still buzzing from the energy of EAGxUtrecht 2024 at Royal Jaarbeurs. It's been an incredible journey, and we have so many people to thank for its success. Brace yourselves for some statistics – after all, what's an effective altruism event without a flurry of numbers? 🎤 Our heartfelt appreciation goes out to our 61 speakers who delivered 107 diverse and engaging sessions. From insightful talks to interactive workshops, they captivated over 400 participants from dozens of countries, fostering a truly international dialogue on effective altruism. 🤝 The event facilitated approximately 1,500 meetings between attendees, with each participant averaging 10 new connections. These interactions lay the groundwork for future collaborations and initiatives that could significantly impact our shared goals. 📊 We're absolutely ecstatic about the feedback! 74% of attendees reported the event as being notably better (3-10x more valuable) or much better (>10x more valuable) than their counterfactual plans. Plus, we achieved an average likelihood to recommend score of 8.8/10! 👏 A special acknowledgment goes to our core organising team. Their tireless efforts were instrumental in ensuring the smooth execution of the event: Anna Toso, Chiona Nanlohy, Kars ten Berge, and Martijn Klop. We'd also like to recognize our exceptional volunteer leads: Rebecca H., Roy Hagemann 🔹, Sophia Ikpia, and Stian Standnes Grønlund. Their dedication and hard work behind the scenes made this event possible. Finally, a huge thank you to the dozens of volunteers who poured their hearts into making this event a success. From setting up rooms to guiding attendees, your energy and commitment were the backbone of EAGxUtrecht 2024. Thank you to everyone who contributed to making EAGxUtrecht 2024 an outstanding success. We look forward to seeing the ideas and connections forged here flourish in the coming months and years. We hope to see you at future EAGx events as we continue to work towards a better world. 🌍✨ 📸 by Kevin Kwee"
