Review of 1D metrics, such as PC1, directionality index (DI), insulation score (IS), separation score (SS), contrast index (CI), distal-to-local ratio (DLR) and inter-chromosomal fraction of interactions (Figure 1, Methods). Newly developed intra-TAD score (IAS) and inter-TAD score (IES) (detection of stripes, asymmetric 5'/3' stripe TADs, loope, others), adjusted interaction frequency (IF) (detection of hubs, among others), directional relative frequency (DRF) for two-sample comparison, detects directional TADs (5'/3' dTADs) depicting an asymmetric event of inter-TAD interactions. New metrics can be compared between matrices, used for clustering, examples on experimental data. Novel observations, e.g., the upstream and downstream proximal TAD regions tend to exhibit opposite trends in gene expression. Inclusion of IS, PC1, and IF in ChromHMM identifies additional \"active promoters on boundaries\" state. Hi-C data preprocessing - Juicer, KR normalization. Documentation.
