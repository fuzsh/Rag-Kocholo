        "text": "Slovenia became a full member of the European Union on May 1, 2004. Twenty years later, on May 9, 2024 – Europe Day – we will celebrate in Nova Gorica the anniversary of its accession. It was here that the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, welcomed the then Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia, Anton Rop, and Slovenia into the European Union.\n\nThe twentieth anniversary presents a special occasion for the the Government of the Republic of Slovenia to invite the two figures back to Nova Gorica – the future European Capital of Culture – adding another layer of symbolic significance to the celebration.\n\n\"It's extremely important that the celebration of the anniversary takes place here, where twenty years ago, in Piazza Transalpina between Slovenia and Italy, Romano Prodi and Anton Rop counted the seconds until Slovenia's accession to the European Union. This entry changed the lives of citizens on both sides of the border, so it's meaningful that next year we will share the title of European Capital of Culture with our neighbors. At the celebration, we will welcome distinguished guests from across Europe, to whom we will introduce some of the artists working in the cross-border area and co-creating the 2025 programme. From the renowned dance group MN Dance Company to the world-famous pianist Alexander Gadjiev. This is an important milestone, which will be followed next year by an even bigger celebration: the opening of the European Capital of Culture 2025 Nova Gorica-Gorizia.\" These are the words of Neda Rusjan Bric, artistic advisor of GO! 2025 and director of the national celebration and the opening of ECoC, scheduled for February 8, 2025.\n\nThe celebration will begin at 8.30 p.m. in front of the Municipal Palace. It will also be possible to follow it live (on the 1st channel of TV Slovenija, the 1st channel of Radio Slovenija, and the RTV Slovenija website). Guests and visitors can attend the full programme, which will last throughout the day:"
