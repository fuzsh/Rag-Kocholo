Once upon a time, there was a member of the United States Air Force. He spent his days as a member of the Strategic Air Command, specifically a navigator-bombardier. He was rather good at it.

Then he retired and started writing books. These books involve super-planes, such as the EB-52 Megafortress, a stealth escort bomber. They also sometimes involve nukes being let off. The main plotline through most of his stories involves USAF bomber navigator Patrick McLanahan and his involvement with the supersecret High Technology Aerospace Weapons Center "Dreamland".

He made the plot for a Real Time Strategy game, Act of War, which features some of the tropes found in his books.
