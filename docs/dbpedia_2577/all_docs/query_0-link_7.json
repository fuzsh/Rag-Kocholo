        "text": "I started reading Celia Dale’s A Dark Corner in January, but put it aside after a few pages because I couldn’t handle the tension then, at least I wasn’t in the right mood for it, but I had every intention of returning to it soon…\n\nBased on the one Celia Dale novel I’ve read so far (the superb A Helping Hand), I knew that Errol Winston is headed for doom from the opening pages when he lands up one evening on the doorstep of the Didcots, a white, elderly couple. It’s raining cats and dogs, and Errol seems soaked to the skin while also coughing badly. Mrs Didcot, shuffling to the door peers at the paper he thrusts at her, which contains an advertisement for a room on rent. It appears that Errol has made a mistake, and has arrived at the wrong address, there’s certainly no room to let at the Didcots. Errol prepares to leave, but Mrs Didcot takes pity on him, particularly concerned with his hacking cough, and invites him inside to warm himself by the fire, while Mrs Didcot prepares a pot of tea. Deeply exhausted, Errol settles on a chair and falls asleep, and it is during this time that her husband, Arthur Didcot walks in.\n\nArthur Didcot is not very sure about Errol at first, but his wife convinces him it’s just for the night; after all, she can’t bring herself to throw out a ‘nice young chap’ onto the street in the heavy rain especially when he’s ailing, can she? Mr Didcot relents and in the morning tries to elicit some information from the young man. Errol Winston is black, a fact that Mrs Didcot brings to her husband’s notice and his first reaction immediately highlights his racist leanings, Didcot recoils at the idea of sheltering persons of colour.\n\nWe learn that Errol has no family – his mother is dead, and his father has abandoned him. His childhood was a happy one, though, growing up with his aunt’s family after his mother’s death. Subsequently, Errol moves out with his father, and loses touch with his aunt. The father, then, disappears too, and Errol is now alone in England with no family or friends on whom he can lean for support. His aunt and her family have relocated to Kingston, Jamaica, and Errol seems to have had no contact with them for a long time. We are also told that the Didcots have no children, or rather they had a son Terry who perished in a freak accident, and Errol accepts that at face value, although whether that is a true story or a concocted one is hard to tell.\n\nIt soon turns out that the room Errol was hoping to get on rent is denied to him, his rejection has much to do with the colour of his skin. Thus, he comes back knocking a second time on the Didcots’ door. Mrs Didcot once again convinces her husband to let him stay till his cough dissipates, and thus Errol finds himself with a roof over his head, for the time being at least, although there’s something murky about the whole affair.\n\nMrs Didcot’s legs are bad, severely impacting her mobility, as a result of which her movements are confined only to the ground floor of their house. Only, sometimes in the summer does she partly venture out, which means nothing more than sitting out facing the garden when the temperature permits it. On the first floor are two rooms – Mr Didcot’s bedroom and his mysterious Den, a sanctuary of sorts for him as he immerses in some strange research on the royal lineage based on a premise that greatly bewilders Errol when he is slowly taken into Didcot’s confidence later on. Right at the top is the attic, and this becomes Errol’s makeshift room.\n\nIn the beginning, things appear to be coasting smoothly. Errol is a sincere, hardworking man, employed at a grocery store, he is out for most of the day, comes back dead tired, eats, and retires to the attic. Sometimes, after the evening meal, he takes to strolling through the city streets soaking up the rundown, decaying character of his neighbourhood. At other times, he sits in the parlour chatting with Mrs Didcot and soon an easy, confiding friendship develops between them.\n\nThat there’s something sinister and creepy about Arthur Didcot is apparent fairly early on, by his rampant hypocrisy particularly when he takes pains to stress the relevance of ‘decency’ and ‘values.’ And yet Mr Didcot is a deeply disconcerting man, judging by his actions – he surreptitiously sneaks into the attic at night staring at Errol fast asleep, and sneakily goes through his belongings when Errol is away at work.\n\nPossibly jealous of the camaraderie that has developed between Errol and his wife, Didcot wishes to establish a deeper relationship with the young man too. He takes Errol out for bizarre evening walks along seedy alleys filled with shady characters and brazen posters lamenting at the failings of youth and loose morals of women, warning Errol to stay away from all sorts of vices as if Didcot is some high priest preaching on the dangers of sinning.\n\nDeluded and convinced of his greatness, he also tries to involve Errol in his so-called “project”, the one pertaining to royal heredity and the superiority of the letter “A”, and his explanations on this subject increasingly perplex Winston, who for the life of him can’t grasp what Didcot is trying to get at.\n\nHe looked down at his linked hands with an inward-turning smile. ‘I’m not scared. There’s a power in the name my whole Project’s based on that. But it’s only royalty that brings the doom to it. I’ve just got the power.’\n\nThings take on a darker tone, when one night, Didcot bursts into the attic and frantically wakes Errol up, imploring him to accompany him to the den. Errol is deeply disturbed and reluctant, but too overwhelmed to refuse, and follows Didcot. What he sees there shocks him, eventually setting the stage for a shocking finale.\n\nIn A Dark Corner then, we find ourselves in classic Celia Dale territory, where we are given a glimpse of pure evil that lurks beneath an outward façade of respectability. The overarching premise is pretty similar to A Helping Hand – a couple taking in a lodger in an act of altruism which they believe sets them on high moral ground in the perception of society; how can their kindness be questioned? And yet, it instinctively feels darker than A Helping Hand, especially in the characterization of Arthur Didcot, a seemingly unremarkable man boasting about his superior moral standards when he is largely a monster in disguise. The book’s title also seems apt given that it’s a likely indicator of not only Errol’s skin colour but also of how his circumstances unfold – a young black man pushed into a corner.\n\nThis is a book about how the vulnerable can chillingly find themselves at the mercy of the world’s wickedness reflected in people across ages and genders – if in A Helping Hand, it was an elderly woman who was preyed upon, in A Dark Corner, it’s a young man who finds himself at the receiving end. A Dark Corner also dwells on the vileness of racism and victims caught in its snare, epitomized in the character of Errol, who may very well be a sincere, decent chap, but whose chances of survival in alien surroundings look grim given his solitary nature, lack of friends or family to vouch for him, while all the time viewed suspiciously by the people because of his skin colour.\n\nAs ever, Celia Dale is superb at creating mood and atmosphere; A Dark Corner is drenched in chilling vibes instilling in the reader a creeping sense of dread. The claustrophobic setting of the Didcot house and its immediate desolate, characterless environment is superbly conveyed mirroring the joyless personalities of its inhabitants.\n\nOther terraces are of gabled red brick, with ornamental scrollwork and leaded stained glass in their front door panels, red and cream tiled paths. They have an air of great respectability but behind the privet hedges dustbins sag and sometimes a motor-cycle swathed in a plastic sheet. The grass of their front gardens has been concreted over, although sometimes there still remains an overgrown hydrangea, some greyish michaelmas daisies or some golden rod. They have survived the Blitz with nothing worse than some ceilings down and some windows out and some of them still have Anderson shelters in the small back gar- dens, humped with haphazard rockeries where nasturtiums and London Pride and weeds straggle. Behind the prim brick and coloured glass façades a slow erosion has cracked the walls, sagged hinges, blistered paint; where once one family lived there are now four or five, clusters of Indians who keep their curtains drawn all day, old age pensioners heating soup on gas rings, Irish labourers and shop girls far from home.\n\nRight from the beginning, we do know that something terrible will unfold, what we don’t know is its exact nature, and this element of uncertainty and fear adds to the tension of this short but brilliant book as it hurtles toward its conclusion. In a nutshell, A Dark Corner is a terrifying but impressive offering from Celia Dale as it highlights the insidious nature of evil whose impact is brutal not because of its dramatic quality but because of its banality. Very much recommended!"
