Spearheading this are the men and women of America's armed forces, the \"troops on the wall\" who will go anywhere, anytime, and do whatever it takes to protect our nation and the rest of the free world.\n\nNow, for the first time, Combat brings the best authors in military fiction together to reveal how war will be fought in the 21st century, from the down-and-dirty \"groundpounders\" of the U.S. Cavalry to the new frontiers of warfare--outer space and the internet. Ten authors whose novels define the military fiction genre have written all new short novels about the men and women willing to put their lives on the line for freedom:\n\nStephen Coonts tells of the unlikely partnership between an ex-Marine sniper and a female pilot who team up to kill the terrorists who murdered their parents.\n\nDale Brown takes us into the seldom-seen world of the military review board, and shows how the future career of an EB-52 Megafortress pilot can depend on a man he's never met.\n\nLarry Bond explores the wild frontier of space warfare, where American forces fight a tenacious enemy that threatens every free nation on Earth.\n\nRalph Peters takes us to the Balkan States, where a US observer is captured by the very people he is there to help, and learns how far people will go for their idea of freedom.\n\nHarold Coyle reports from the front lines of the information war, where cyberpunks are recruited to combat the growing swarm of hackers who orchestrate online terrorism around the world.\n\nDean Ing unites a private investigator, a bounty hunter, and an FBI agent who together uncover a shadow of terrorism that looms over America and threatens thousands of lives.\n\nDavid Hagberg presents another riveting Kirk McGarvey adventure, in which rising tensions between China and Taiwan threaten to bring the US and the world to the brink of war.\n\nR.J. Pineiro goes to the far reaches of space where a terrorist holds the world captive from a nuclear equipped space platform. To stop him, a pilot agrees to fly her space shuttle on a deadly mission from which she may never return.\n\nJames Cobb pits a lone US Armored Cavalry unit against an aggressive Algerian recon division in an attempt to protect a defenseless African nation.\n\nBarrett Tillman takes a group of retired fighter jocks in for one last mission, battling enemy jets over the skies of California.\n\nGenre: Thriller\n\nVisitors also looked at these books\n\nUsed availability for Dale Brown's Combat\n\nSearch for\n\nAbout Fantastic Fiction Information for Authors"
