        "text": "This class will both investigate journalism as a social, cultural, and historical phenomenon and employ journalism as a practice by which to encounter the world. We will immerse ourselves in journalismâs intricacies and complexities, its strengths and faults, and come to understand it not only as a working trade and historyâs first draft but also as a literary art in its own rightâone with as many deep imperatives and as rich a tradition as poetry or fiction. We will survey the best (and a little bit of the worst) of short- and long-form journalism and, over the course of the year, craft everything from brief profiles to ambitious investigative pieces. How does a writer know which details to highlight and which to subordinate? What is the nature of good interviewing technique? How does one interview a willing source as opposed to a resistant one? When should one write concisely, and when is it appropriate to expatiate? What are the ways in which a journalist interacts withâand runs the danger of contaminatingâhis or her subject? We will ask and answer these and many other questions and spend significant time puzzling out the ways in which fundamental journalistic practice leaps from print to television to new media. Prominent journalists will be invited to talk to us and tell us what they do. Readings will range from H. L. Mencken, George Orwell, Janet Malcolm, Joseph Mitchell, and Truman Capote to Joseph Roth. Weekly individual conferences, first semester; biweekly individual conferences, second semester.\n\nThis FYS version of Forms and Fictions begins with the reading and writing of folk and fairy tales; moves on to incidents, episodes, stories, poetic translations, frame stories, personal essays, graphic novels, and lyrics; and, finally, plans for a novel, its opening, end, and first chapter. The emphasis here is on trying on forms, learning which form works best for which kind of content, which works best for each student, what your aesthetic is, what you have to say, as well as how you might say it. There will be weekly readings and exercises in each form, in dialogue, pacing, editing, portraiture, plot and its philosophical underpinnings.Â Also, students will send each other 100-word pieces every week. Conference work will be planned, written, and revised over the course of the semester.Â The emphasis in conference work is on vision, revision, editing, finishing, and presentation, a process useful for any course or endeavor.Â In addition to classes, we will meet every other week for individual conferences and every week for a group session to talk about whatever comes up: campus activities, procrastination, New York City, dropping or adding classes, laundry, food, internships, sports, roommates, whatever students and their don need or want to explore.\n\nOne of the exciting literary developments in recent years is the plethora of work that disrupts the notion of genreâby writers such as Eula Biss, Jenny Offill, and Ben Lerner. In this workshop, we will read a book each week and consider architecture, diction, association, metaphor, and other issues of craft. Students will be required to bring in a new piece of writing each week and to write critical responses to the reading. This class will be a good fit for students who are comfortable reading 100-200 pages a week, in addition to generating their own creative writing. For workshop, students may submit poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, or anything in between. We will aim to locate a pieceâs heatâits linguistic, figurative, and musical energyâand consider how that energy might be developed, or maximized, in subsequent drafts. Half of each class will be devoted to discussing the weekly reading; the other half will be spent discussing student work. Occasionally, we will also do in-class writing exercises. There will be weekly writing prompts, and students will work on their own hybrid projects. At the end of each semester, students will turn in a revised, final portfolio with at least two earlier drafts for each piece, as well as their hybrid project.Â There will be biweekly conferences.Â\n\nA novelist once began a lecture by asking how many people in the audience wanted to be writers. When almost everyone raised a hand, he said, âSo, why the hell arenât you home writing?â The novelist was asking the right question. The only way to improve as a writer is to write a lot. You might have all the talent in the world, and you might have had a thousand fascinating experiences; but talent and experience wonât get you very far unless you have the ability to sit down, day after day, and write. Accordingly, my main goal is to encourage you to develop or sustain the habit of steady writing. Youâll be sharing a very short piece with the class every week in response to prompts that Iâll provide, and youâll also be writing longer stories and essays that weâll discuss in one-on-one conference meetings. In the fall semester, students will read and write short fiction; in the spring, students will read and write personal essays. Writers whose work weâll study include James Baldwin, Anton Chekhov, Joan Didion, Jennifer Egan, Percival Everett, Carmen Maria Machado, Katherine Mansfield, Haruki Murakami, George Orwell, Philip Roth, George Saunders, and Zadie Smith. Given the range of writers that weâll be reading, itâs safe to say that everyone in the class will be encountering stories they find disturbing and ideas they find objectionable at some point during the year. If you believe you can be harmed by exposure to points of view that differ starkly from your own, it would be best not to register for this class. We will meet in individual conferences every week until the October Study Days break, after which our conferences will meet every other week.\n\nAfter reading a story by an older writer, the young James Joyce wrote, âIs this as near as [he] can get to life, I wonder?â You could say that Joyce was pointing toward a goal for which many great fiction writers strive: the goal of bringing to the page oneâs unique way of apprehending life rather than relying on formula and convention. Something like this striving lay behind Chekhovâs revolt against traditional plot, Woolfâs search for new ways to render the subtleties of consciousness, Steinâs experiments with language, and Garcia Marquezâs adventures in magical realism. In this lecture class, weâll read short stories old and new, with the aim of learning both from those whoâve come before us and those who are working now. Writers weâre likely to encounter include Isaac Babel, Anton Chekhov, Percival Everett, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Mary Gaitskill, Ernest Hemingway, Franz Kafka, D. H. Lawrence, Carmen Maria Machado, Katherine Mansfield, Lorrie Moore, ZZ Packer, Grace Paley, George Saunders, and Virginia Woolf. Though formally a lecture, this will heavily be a discussion-based class; so please consider registering for it only if youâre interested in sharing your thoughts about the readings every week.\n\nAll great stories are built with good sentences. In this workshop, students will create short stories or continue works-in-progress that will be read and discussed by their peers. Class sessions will focus on constructive criticism of the writerâs work, and students will be encouraged to ask the questions with which all writers grapple: What makes a good story? Have I fully developed my characters? And does my language convey the ideas that I want? We will talk about the writerâs craft in this classâhow people tell stories to each other, how to find a plot, and how to make a sentence come to life. This workshop should be seen as a place where students can share their thoughts and ideas in order to then return to their pages and create a completed imaginary work. There will also be some short stories and essays on the art of writing that will set the tone and provide literary fodder for the class.\n\nToni Morrison once wrote, âIf writing is thinking and discovery and selection and order and meaning, it is also awe and reverence and mystery and magic.â She referred to the interior life of her ancestors as being a large (perhaps the largest?) charge that she, as an author, faced; the characters she createdâin part from pictures, in part from the act of imaginationâyielded âa kind of truth.â We are experiencing a new age of Black artists and activists, charging the world to heed their truths; as writers, weâll delve into the fullness of their experiences. Nana Ama Adjei-Brenyah brings magical realism to the doorstep of our daily lives; Edward P. Jones establishes setting as character, garnering comparisons to James Joyce. Ta-Nehisi Coates posits large questions about writing and Black identity, while Jocelyn Nicole Johnson uses satire to address themes of class and culture; and both Danielle Evans and Jamel Brinkley write in a charged realist tradition that is RIEBY (my new acronym: right in everybodyâs back yard!). Class readings will include essays on craft and technique, as well as short stories and memoir. This workshop will also have at its heart the discussion of student manuscripts and the development of constructive criticism. Talking about race, talking about craft, and talking about our own fiction should occur in an environment where everyone feels valued and supported. The road may be bumpy at timesâbut how else to get to that truth that Toni Morrison so prized?\n\nThis large seminar looks at the ineffable nature of voice and its intertwining relationships with narrators, authors, and interpretations. We will build stories and their inhabitants using source material that is meaningful to each of us: literature, of course, but also music, film and video, visual art, semiotics, fashion, architecture, games, urban myths, podcasts and voiceovers, family lore and history, and more. Through this process, weâll identify and deepen voice as the vernacular of our imaginations. Studentsâ writing will be workshopped in small-group conferences. We will read work by writers such as Samuel Beckett, James Hannaham, Garielle Lutz, Carmen Maria Machado, Bhanu Kapil, Edouard Leve, Philip K. Dick, Robert Lopez, William Saroyan, Denis Johnson, and Shelly Oria. We will also listen to music, watch videos and excerpted films, look at art, and examine popular culture and our own families as if we were anthropologists. We will work to shed ideas of what we should be writing and discover whatâs already inside us ready to be written.\n\nThe story begins, âOnce upon a time,â or the story begins, âCall me Ishmael,â and with this initiating sentence a fictional world unspools. The word and the sentence are our first tools as writers; and, in this class, we will study how sentences shape story. We will also consider how the story requires more than great sentences. This is a class heavy on writing and reading. We will develop our craft through weekly exercises and experiments in form, character, narrative, stance, authority, point of view, dialogue, scene, situation, style, tropes, and syntax. Additionally, memory as a tool will be consideredâboth the writerâs memory as it is reimagined, reinvented in a work of fiction (family memory, historical memory), as well as the use of memory inside a work of fiction (character memory, place memory, historical memory). Students will develop stories from first draft through at least one extensive revision.\n\nWho doesnât love Frog and Toad? Have you ever wanted to write something like itâor like Charlotteâs Web or A Snowy Day? Why do our favorites work so well and so (almost) universally? We will begin by reading books we know and books we missed and discuss what makes them so good. We will be looking at read-to books, early readers, instructional books for children, rude books, chapter books, books about friendship, and (possibly) young adult books. We may consider what good childrenâs history and biography might be like. We will talk about the place of the visual, the careful and conscious use of language, notions of appropriateness, and what works at various age levels. Invariably, we will talk about childhood, our own and as part of an ever-changing set of social theories. We will try our hand at writing picture books, early readers, friendship stories, collections of poems like Mother Goose. Conference work will involve making a childrenâs book of any kind, on any level. Classes will be in both lecture and conversational mode, and group conferences will involve looking at our writing.\n\nThe goal of this class is to start an audio fiction revolution. In this class, students will learn to write and produce groundbreaking contemporary audio dramas, while also experimenting with the form, and ask what it means to create the audio fiction of their dreams. We will listen to works from venerable podcasts like Welcome to Night Vale, Magnus Archives, The Truth, Radiotopia, and other podcasts from around the world. We will listen to audio fiction from collectives like Mermaid Palace that explicitly address identity and sexuality to challenge the status quo. We will also create our own critical discourse for contemporary audio dramaâanalyzing writings and essays from the fields of screenwriting, sound art, contemporary music, and literatureâto help understand and analyze the works that we are creating. Creators from Welcome to Night Vale, Audible, and others will join our discussions to talk about their stories and production processes. Throughout the semester, students will make works and create their own podcasts. At the end of the semester, students will pitch their fiction ideas to audio executives at Audible.\n\nWhat is a novel? Different writers have defined the form differently. D. H. Lawrence said that the novel is âthe one bright book of life.â Stendhal said that a novel is âa mirror carried along a high road. At one moment it reflects the azure skies, at another the mire of the puddles at your feet.â Randall Jarrell, admitting that even the greatest novels are flawed in some way, said that a novel is âa prose narrative of some length that has something wrong with it.â In this class, weâll be reading a wide variety of novels published after 1970 in order to gain an appreciation of the richness and flexibility of the form. Writers whose work weâll consider include Nicholson Baker, Octavia Butler, Italo Calvino, Teju Cole, Jennifer Egan, Milan Kundera, Ben Lerner, Sigrid Nunez, Jenny Offill, Padgett Powell, Mary Robison, Fran Ross, and George Saunders. I donât have a treasure chest of craft lessons to offer; my hope is that if we spend the semester reading ambitious novels and talking about them as fellow writers, weâll all learn something by the end. In conference, weâll be looking at your writing. Youâll be asked to give me a finished short story or novel excerpt every two weeks.\n\nStories are immensely complex mechanisms. When we talk about how they work, we often confine our discussion to their most straightforward elements: the relationship between conflict and suspense, for example, or between verisimilitude and believability. But stories also derive a substantial proportion of their meaning and force from elements not so easily pinned down: from the potency of their images, from their surprising and suggestive juxtapositions, or from other qualities more easily apprehended by the unconscious than the conscious mind. The villagers in Kafkaâs A Country Doctor strip the doctor naked and place him in bed with his grotesquely wounded patientâan action with little clear connection to the conflicts established in the story and little to recommend it in regard to verisimilitude. And yet it is precisely weird, suggestive, and not entirely interpretable images such as this that make Kafkaâs writing so feverishly compelling and grant it its measure of beauty and truth. During the first half of the semester, students will read, discuss, and write two- to three-page imitations of folk tales and myths, as well as short stories, by some of the great fabulists of the modern era, including Donald Barthelme, Teju Cole, Percival Everett, Nikolai Gogol, Allegra Hyde, Franz Kafka, Haruki Murakami, Karen Russell, Bruno Schulz, and Barry Yourgrau. The second half of the semester will be devoted to workshopping studentsâ own stories. All readings will be from a PDF packet.\n\nâOur house is our corner of the worldâ¦it is our first universe,â writes the French philosopher GustavÂ BachelardÂ in his influential text,Â The Poetics of Space. What is the connection between physical spaces, literature, and the imagination? How can our experiences of spaces inform the way that we read and write?Â This course will use Bachelardâs text as a guide to a larger discussion of architectural structures within fiction, which will begin with works by Shirley Jackson, William Maxwell, and Kathryn Davis and end with the contemporary short story. Students will be expected to complete an observation journal, in which they will record and analyze past and present spaces from their own lives, complete two working drafts of short stories that will be discussed within a workshop setting, and turn in as a final portfolio at the end of term.\n\nWriting begins with our bodies in present time and space: Our minds are nestled in our bodies, and our imaginations are nestled in our nervous systems. In this class, we will consider present bodies as mediums, sources, oracles, and anchors. From autofiction to high fantasy, all our stories are born this way; speculation itself is imaginative projection. Every aspect of writingâfrom the sounds of our words to the objects of our charactersâ desires to the use of punctuationâcan be found in our own present embodiment. We will generate new writing through experiments during and outside of class. These include experiential exercises such as immediate sensory awareness work, dream logs, and studies of inexplicably vivid memories. We will explore ways to release our writing from cerebral control while mindfully steering it: breaking fallback linguistic patterns, collaborating with other writers, and working outside our usual forms. In individual and small-group conferences, we will discuss your fiction, along with your writing processes and practices. Authors we will read may include Franz Kafka, Yasunari Kawabata, Eugene Ionesco, Karin Tidbeck, Philip K. Dick, Octavia Butler, Uchida Hyakken, Carmen Maria Machado, Paul La Farge, and Rivka Galchen. Texts by Pema Chodron, Peter Levine, Richard Schwartz, Natalie Goldberg, and others will support our projects.\n\nWhy do certain stories produce a physical ache as we read themâfeeling as if we've âexperiencedâ them rather than simply read them? In this workshop, weâll discuss each otherâs stories as we would in a traditional roundtable settingâbut Iâd like to do more than that. If writing a lot and getting feedback from peers is important, I believe we develop our unique voiceâand our writing becomes far more interestingâby better understanding the spirit of human engagement. That means drawing ideas from psychology, philosophy, linguistics, cultural anthropology, and beyond. So, this class will take a hybrid approach to the workshop. We'll do that. But weâll set also aside time to discuss work from published writers and ideas from narratology, critical theory, film studies, psychology, dream theory, reader-response theory, memory theory, the uncanny, and conceptual metaphor. The combination will foster a gestalt of skills and understanding of expressiveness that move well beyond the semester. Youâll have new ways of entering the broader world with your words, writing work that readers wonât ever forget because youâve created a mirror in which they find themselves alongside the spirit of your intentions.\n\nÂ\n\nDo you have an idea for a sci-fi, fantasy, horror, dystopian, or just plain weird novel...but find yourself struggling to find a way into the story? Do you want to transport your readers to a glittering future, a mythic kingdom, a haunted house, or an apocalyptic wasteland...but don't know the best narrator and/or protagonist to guide them? Fear not! In this writing workshop, we'll examine a handful of contemporary speculative novels to unlock the secrets of how they bring their charactersâand therefore their narrativesâto such uncanny life. Then you'll apply those lessons to writing your own fiction that your peers will read, discuss, and then provide feedback. By the end of the semester, when you turn in a revision of the excerpt that you workshopped, you'll have your main characterâs voice, motivation, backstory, internal conflict, and deepest fears coming across vividly on the page.\n\nWhat might it mean for a writer to be useful to a state? How have states used writers, witting and unwitting, in projects aimed at influence and hegemony? How might a state make use of language as a weapon? What might it mean for a writer to attempt to avoid being useful to a state? How might a state inflect and influence the intimacy between a writer and what we may write? In this class, weâll discuss an array of choices that writers have made in relation to state power, focusing particularly on the United States from just after World War II until the present. You'll be asking to read excerpts from five books: Joel WhitneyâsÂ Finks: How the CIA Tricked the Worldâs Best Writers; Frances Stonor SaundersâsÂ The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters; Eric Bennettâs Â Workshops of Empire: Stegner, Engle, and American Creative Writing During the Cold War; Vivian GornickâsÂ The Romance of American Communism; and Peter Dale Scottâs long poem,Â Coming to Jakarta. Group conferences will function as writing workshops and to offer feedback on your letters in progress, in addition to various writing exercises. This is not a history or a literature class; our lens will be that of a writer, using deep study and playful practice to figure out the dilemmas and best practices of the present.\n\nThere is such an alive quality to reading a notebookâa laboratory of interrupted and ongoing consciousness, whose very irregularities or imperfections give it a wildness unmatched by more plotted or studied works. In this yearlong writing seminar, we will begin in the fall by reading writersâ and other artistsâ notebooks: some that were meant to be published and considered as formal works; others, not. We will consider journals that are circling around an activity or process (gardening, trance, the bus, drawing) and others that are more open. Besides the notebook, we will also read and think through first-person or documentary texts that use their own diary as a significant archive. In the fall, notebooks we will read include Sei Shonagan, May Sarton, Eva Hesse, HervÃ© Guibert, Annie Ernaux, Lauren Elkin, Franz Kafka, Susan Sontag, Sylvia Plath, Derek Jarman, David Wojnarowicz, Renee Gladman, and Bhanu Kapil. Every week, writers will keep a notebook. Conference will involve writers shaping and editing their notebooks, thinking of the notebook practice as its own serious and lively endeavor. In the spring, we will focus on long-form prose projects that are inspired by and taken from the notebook, works enthralled to the rhythms of the daily, the problem of the person in time and space, and the process of creation. We will read texts that borrow from the notebook but exist as essay, meditation, poem, address book, travelogueâincluding works by Sophie Calle, T. Fleischmann, Aisha Sabatini Sloan, Jazmina Barrera, Heike Geissler, and Moyra Davey. This class is a yearlong prose class open to all genres but especially to those interested in the nonfiction impulse.\n\nFor 10 years, narrative podcasting has dominated the media space. Shows like This American Life, Serial, Radiolab, and numerous other story-driven shows have become the paradigm for podcasts such as 99% Invisible, Love + Radio, and many others. Weâve also entered the age of the serialized podcast, with limited-run series and others put out by podcast companies such as Audible, iHeart, Wondery, and so many others. This class will teach students the practicalities of how narrative audio podcasting works, while we explore what this narrative movement means. Students will learn practicalities; e.g., pitching both multipart and narrative stories, using the actual âcall for storiesâ from studios and shows; the fundamentals of how to record and mix stories, using the latest digital-editing technology; what narrative editors expect in a series; and the skills necessary for a podcast internship. We will also reflect on the theoretical and ethical considerations of narrative podcasting. We will ask questions such as: How do imposing narrative structures affect nonfiction storytelling? How do narrative shows deal with ethical missteps? What does it mean to have âa voiceâ? Does it matter who gets to tell the story? (Answer on the last question is âyes.â Weâll discuss why.) Producers, editors, and freelancers for This American Life, Audible, Radiolab, and others will visit the class to provide insight into their shows and answer student questionsâand students will pitch audio executives their ideas at the end of the course.\n\nIn addition to being the title of Michael Cluneâs memoir or a theory in the hands of McKenzie Wark, video games have now invaded social spaceâand, therefore, our literary imaginationsâin a way that would have been unthinkable 30 years ago. And yet, how do we write about games? About the experience both of playing these aesthetic objects and living in an arguably gamified world with the same intensity, curiosity, and rigor that we might otherwise bring to any centuries-old ekphrastic attempt? In this course, we will query the limits, techniques, and new forms of nonfiction writing made possible through video games, taking the anthology Critical Hits: Writers Playing Video Games as a springboard for our own experiments through short exercises and workshop. We will focus on the interplay between social position and form where, rather than an escape, video games pose new questions of difficulty in prose and in life. No experience playing video games will be required, though this will certainly not hurt; smaller indie games may be used as examples.\n\nThis course will be divided into three units, each of which will involve reading published essays and writing our own. In the first unit, People You Know, students will write personal narratives involving people in their lives and read, as models, published examples of such works; for example, Phillip Lopateâs portrait of his family in the essay âWilly.â In the second unit, Place, we will read and write essays about authorsâ relationships to particular placesâless travelogues than investigations of the dynamic between the person and the place; examples of published essays we will read for this unit are âStranger in the Village,â by James Baldwin, and Annie Dillardâs essay, âAces and Eights.â For the third unit, The Personal in the Critical/Journalistic (or PCJ), a work in that genre combines personal reflection with consideration of an outside subject, such as a favorite movie or an event like 9/11âthe interaction of the personal and the outside subject yields a third element, an insight that would not be possible without the first two elementsâfor example, Jonathan Lethemâs personal essay about the movie The Searchers.\n\nAny writer who tries to capture the likeness of anotherâwhether in biography, history, journalism, or art criticismâmust face certain questions. What makes a good profile? What is the power dynamic between subject and writer? How does a subjectâs place in the world determine the parameters of what may be written about him/her/them? To what extent is any portrait also a self-portrait? And how can the complexities of a personality be captured in several thousandâor even several hundredâwords? In this course, we will tackle the various challenges of profile writing, such as choosing a good subject, interviewing, plotting, obtaining and telescoping biographical information, and defining the role of place in the portrait. Students will be expected to share their own work, identify what they admire or despise in other writersâ characterizations, and learn to read closely many recognized practitioners of the genre. We will also turn to shorter forms of writingâpersonal sketches, brief reported pieces, physical descriptionsâto further illuminate what we mean when we talk about âidentityâ and âcharacter.â The goal of this course is less to teach the art of profile writing than to become better readers and writers generally.\n\nFrom Milton (Satan) to Dryden to Dr. Johnson to Coleridge to De Quincey to Melville (Ahab) to Woolf to Auden to Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, and Stephen Sondheim to Kurosawa (Throne of Blood and Ran) to Peter Brook (The Mahabharata) to Julie Taymor to Taylor Swift...writers, artists, performers, and thinkers in the West, the East, and the South have gained enormous mileage by appropriating, purloining, replying to, adapting, being enraged by, and escaping Shakespeareâor merely by living under his shade. We will plunge into the enormous and still billowing artistic energy generated by this person. We will look at eight major plays, one a week, from every phase of his careerâwith a sampling of their critical and scholarly paraphernaliaâand examine the writerly problems he faced and how he solved them and examine closely his incomparable rhetorical skills. We will try to pluck the heart out of the mystery of this most mysterious artist in order to help ourselves as artists. Conference projects, designed to be presented to the class, can comprehend poetic responses, fictive or dramatic responses, films and multimedia concoctions, or critical or essayistic responses to the entire body of work or to one of its many elements. It has been said that Shakespeare invented the idea of the human. We will think about this. Sonnet sequences are welcome.\n\nThe Iowa Writers Workshop was founded by Wilbur Schramm in 1936. Schramm went on to a many-faceted career, which included writing a postwar manual for the Army, called The Nature of Psychological Warfare. He saw the writing workshop as a way to train âthe kind of young persons who can become the kind of writers we needâ in a future framed by the dominance of the United States. In much American poetry, the consequences of this project of domination are unseen. As is often not true elsewhere, the prison is seen (or unseen) from the point of view of the free. This course looks for the traces of this project of domination and asks what might happen for writers when the domination is seen from the point of view of the dominated and the free from the point of view of the prison. Why are censorship and incarceration such central facts of what itâs meant to be a poet elsewhere? Why hasnât that been true in the United States? How does Archibald MacLeishâs âa poem should not mean but beâ or T. S. Eliotâs âlike a patient etherized upon a tableâ sound beside Adam Wazykâs âhow many times must one wake you up before you recognize your epoch?â or Suzanne CÃ©saireâs surrealism as a tool to recover stolen power, âpurified of colonial stupiditiesâ? What is real freedom? What are its ways? What might the poetry be that comes from it? Our text will be an anthology and workbook, The Most Beautiful Sea: Poems & Pathways Toward Poems, including the work of Nas, Elizabeth Bishop, Refaat Alareer, Nazim Hikmet, Marie Howe, Joshua Bennett, Lucille Clifton, Nipsey Hussle, Mahmoud Darwish, Dionne Brand, and the greatest of all poets: Anonymous. Youâll be asked to do in-class writing exercises, write letters with a partner, and bring drafts to conference. Each term, youâll be required to make an anthology and a chapbook. In the words of Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet, weâll look together for âThe most beautiful seaâ that âhasnât been crossed yetââaka âthe most beautiful words I wanted to tell you/I havenât said yet.â\n\nâLacks one, lacks both,â Whitman says. âJust throw in the kitchen sink, why donât ya,â my mother used to say. This is a poetry-writing wonder romp through a series of polar tensions that pervade modern and contemporary poetry. Through exercises, readings, and your own work, we will explore a variety of dichotomies/tensions that might enable us to engage our poems with a greater sense of presence and emotional possession. Occasion and directionality, intensity and intimacy, figure and ground, speech and writing, line and syntax, structure and body, eye and I...there are plenty of concepts and mechanics, concerns of craft and art, to throw into this course. Are they false dichotomies? Sure, but falsity has its own use; and the central use of falsity is to move us toward truth, to inhabit, to nest there. Primarily, we will be investigating and claiming the best ways that serve our poemsâour sense of belonging with poetryâthat either narrow our concern or expand our vision, or both.\n\nPoetry is as old as humans. We sang to our babies. We sang to cast spells, to bless, to seduce, to celebrate, to mourn, to survive, to instruct, to imagine. This class is open to anyone who wants to read and write poetry. Beginners and experienced writers are welcome. (We are all beginners.) We will read contemporary poems and poems written many years ago. We will practice observing the outer and inner worlds. We will practice the poetic arts: creating images, making metaphors, and employing off rhyme and assonance. We will practice organic forms. We will experiment with ecopoetry, ekphrastic poetry, and persona poetry. You will meet with me in an individual conference every other week and with each other in weekly poetry dates. Each of you will revise your weekly poems so that, at the end of our semester, you should have a deeper sense of the art and a revised collection of your work. I ask for your curiosity, care, and commitment. We will have a wonderful time.\n\nIn this poetry class, we will engage actively with the PRESENT MOMENT in our writing and reading by shifting ourselves out of the familiar and into a position where time can better reveal to us its nonlinear nature. Going from rote to wrote, as they say, haha. We will read, write, and share poems with one another, as well as engage with a variety of funky practices and materialsâsuch as creating and exchanging our own rituals and prompts; practicing some of CAConradâs (soma)tic rituals; and using pencils, sticks, rocks, dirt, water, light, darkness, music, books, juice, and so onâto better understand what poems can do when we get out of their way. You will meet with me in an individual conference every other week and, by the end of the semester, assemble a chapbook of poems/experiences.\n\nThis course will focus primarilyÂ and humanistically on participantsâ own work. Roughly a third of discussion time will be devoted to seminal contemporary poems, with attention to poets of color and marginalized voices. WeâllÂ examine poetics, prosody, and issues of form, pace, voicing,Â and tone in contemporary poetry and inÂ radically experimental texts. Weâll focus on the revision processâhow do artists push themselves toward new worlds? How do poets achieve spontaneity without sacrificing rigor? How do texts reconcile clarity and unpredictability? How do poets develop their own exploration toolsâand howÂ do we go beyond intent? Our emphasis is on craft and individual style, not judgment.Â Expect to read widely, to approach texts in new ways,Â and to create many wild drafts and a finished portfolio of six-to-infinityÂ poems.Â There is no formal prerequisite, but Iâm not conceiving of this as an introductory course. There will be a paper, as well as creative writing.\n\nIn this poetry-writing workshop. we will focus on feminist poetry: what it is, where itâs been, and whatâs next. Using each weekâs reading assignments as inspiration, students will write poem drafts in the style of, or inspired by, poets across eras. We will begin with protofeminist poets like Phillis Wheatley, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Christina Rossetti and then move on to works by poets writing in the decades before second-wave feminism, such as Gertrude Stein, Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson, Edna St. Vincent Millay, H.D., Sylvia Plath, and Gwendolyn Brooks. Weâll look at second-wave poets like Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, June Jordan, and Ai and then continue with the third-wave poets such as Lorna Dee Cervantes, Marilyn Chin, Joy Harjo, Danielle Pafunda, and Carmen GimÃ©nez Smith. Finally, weâll read an array of emerging feminist voices, including Tarfia Faizullah, Chase Berggrun, and Vanessa AngÃ©lica Villarreal. As we dive into the poetry, we will also look at the political and cultural movements surrounding women and feminism that influenced the poets writing in their era, including our own. Each week, students will be expected to read 50-100 pages and be prepared to discuss what theyâve read. Students will write poems based on a prompt inspired by the weekâs reading, which we will workshop in class; a poetry portfolio of these revised assignments will be due at the end of the semester. Students may also write poems outside each weekâs prompt and share these with me during our conferences.\n\nIn this class, weâll look together for, in the words of Nazim Hikmet, âThe most beautiful seaâ that âhasnât been crossed yetâ and âthe most beautiful words I wanted to tell you/I havenât said yet.â Weâll search as readers, via our class workbook text, The Most Beautiful Sea: Poems & Pathways Toward Poems,Â and as writers, using in-class exercises, weekly letters with a partner, and weekly drafts. Youâll be required to work as partners and to make a chapbook of at least 10 pages by the end of the course. The only prerequisites are: a desire to be challenged, a thirst for reading that equals your thirst for writing, the courage to give up spectatorhood for active participation, and a willingness to undertake whatever labors might be necessary to read and write better on our last day of class than on our first.\n\nCollecting expresses a free-floating desire that attaches and reattaches itselfâit is a succession of desires. The true collector is in the grip not of what is collected but of collecting. âSusan Sontag, The Volcano Lover\n\nIâm always looking for new lenses to use with the writing and reading of poetry. As poets, we are natural collectorsâcollecting images, bits of dialogue, phrases, titles. In this poetry workshop, we will discuss and write about our collections (collections of facts, objects, memories) while looking at how collections of poems and prose are constructed/corralled/arranged. Books discussed will include, among others: The Book of DelightsÂ by Ross Gay, ObitÂ by Victoria Chang, Frank SonnetsÂ by Diane Seuss, HoardersÂ by Kate Durbin, The Octopus MuseumÂ by Brenda Shaughnessy, and various essays and handouts on collecting and artists who use collection as part of their practice. This semester, you might collect dreams or facts or an object that you regularly encounter on the street. How this informs your writing can be organic. You might become obsessed with a collectorâs collection and write about it. You might use your collected delights to add a new color to your emotional palette. You might start looking at the objects in your poems in a different way, writing about them with greater specificity. Most weeks, there will be a collecting or poem prompt. Each student will give a 10- to 15-minute presentation on one of their collections.\n\nIn this course, we will investigate the concept of language ideologiesâbeliefs and attitudes about languageâand their impact on the lived experiences of racial and ethnic groups and other minoritized communities within the United States. Through a series of lectures, discussions, and hands-on projects, students will gain an understanding of how language practices reflect and reinforce social hierarchies, cultural norms, and power dynamics. Special attention will be paid to the meaning accomplished through language use and the informative role of ideologies of language and people in understanding these dynamics. We will delve into diverse language contexts, with a primary focus on the United States, examining case studies to understand how language serves as a site of struggle and resistance. Key linguistic topics will include language attitudes and linguistic discrimination, the politics of race and language, standard language ideologies, the role of language in shaping social and racial identities, language use and its social meaning, and multilingualism and multiculturalism in the United States. Specific examples will include ethnographic case studies of race and language, such as H. Samy Alimâs examination of his own experiences as a Black man or person of color under white gaze (âthe white listening subjectâ); political persona and discourse of US presidential candidates; racialization of Asian-American, Black, and Latinx students in US classroom contexts; language revitalization efforts and identification of the Chickasaw Nation; race, gender, and sexuality performances in RuPaulâs Drag Race; identification practices and language use in indigenous communities such as the âTainoâ identity in Puerto Rico. Assessments for this class will involve regular written reflections, a midterm paper, a research proposal, and a final research paper on a topic of the studentâs interest related to language use, race, and identity. Core readings for our class will be drawn primarily from US-based, peer-reviewed linguistic journals and foundational texts. All readings will be provided beforehand.\n\nHow does a chronic illness affect a personâs orientation to the everyday? What are the social and political forces that underpin life in a homeless shelter? What is the experiential world of a blind person, a musician, a refugee, or a child at play? In an effort to answer these and like-minded questions, anthropologists have become increasingly interested in developing phenomenological accounts of particular lived realities in order to understandâand convey to othersâthe nuances and underpinnings of such realities in terms that more general social or symbolic analyses cannot achieve. In this context, phenomenology offers an analytic method that works to understand and describe in words phenomena as they appear to the consciousnesses of certain peoples. The phenomena most often in question for anthropologists include the workings of time, perception, selfhood, language, bodies, suffering, and morality as they take form in particular lives within the context of any number of social, linguistic, and political forces. In this course, we will explore phenomenological approaches in anthropology by reading and discussing some of the most significant efforts along these lines. Each student will also try their hand at developing a phenomenological account of a specific social or subjective reality through a combination of ethnographic research, participant observation, and ethnographic writing.\n\nIn this class, graduate and upperclass undergraduate students with a special interest and experience in the creation of time-based artworks that include live performance will design and direct individual projects. Students and faculty will meet weekly to view works-in-progress and discuss relevant artistic and practical problems, both in class on Tuesday evenings and in conferences taking place on Thursday afternoons. Attributes of the work across multiple disciplines of artistic endeavor will be discussed as integral and interdependent elements in the work. Participation in mentored, critical-response feedback sessions with your peers is a key aspect of the course. The engagement with the medium of time in live performance, the constraints of presentation of the works both in works-in-progress and in a shared program of events, and the need to respect the classroom and presentation space of the dance studio will be the constraints imposed on the studentsâ artistic proposals. Students working within any number of live-performance traditions are as welcome in this course as those seeking to transgress orthodox conventions. While all of the works will engage in some way with embodied action, student proposals need not fall neatly into a traditional notion of what constitutes dance. The cultivation of open discourse across traditional disciplinary artistic boundaries, both in the process of developing the works and in the context of presentation to the public, is a central goal of the course. The faculty members leading this course have roots in dance practice but also have practiced expansive definitions of dance within their own creative work. The course will culminate in performances of the works toward the end of the semester in a shared program with all enrolled students and within the context of winter and spring time-based art events. Performances of the works will take place in the Bessie SchÃ¶nberg Dance Theatre or elsewhere on campus in the case of site-specific work.\n\nAs we want to engage in individual and collective efforts toward sustainable and climate-change mitigating solutions, this workshop offers an opportunity for students to explore the multiple ways in which âsustainabilityâ can be fostered and developed at an institution like Sarah Lawrence College. Students will work in small groups on a variety of projects and produce research and educational material that can lead to concrete and actionable proposals for the College and our community to consider. Students will determine their own areas of interest and research, from energy and water-usage monitoring to composting solutions, recycling/reusing and consumer sobriety, landscaping choices, pollinators and natural diversity, food growing, natural and human history of the land, and community collaborations, to name a few. As part of their project effort, students will engage with College administrators who are actively working toward sustainable solutions, as well as student, staff, and faculty groups such as the Warren Green vegetable garden, the Sarah Lawrence Interdisciplinary Collective on the Environment (SLICE), and the Sustainability Committee. We will also explore the possibility of writing grants in coordination with other actors at the College. This workshop will meet once a week for one hour. It is offered as pass/fail based on attendance and a group project that will mostly be developed during our meeting time. It is open to all students, including first-year students. All skills and areas of expertise are welcome, from environmental science to writing and visual and studio artsâbut any interest in issues of sustainability and a strong sense of dedication will suffice!\n\nThis course will take the form of a screening and discussion seminar designed to provide an overview of alternative and experimental animations derived from the creative practice of transforming stories of trauma and struggle into films of artistic merit. We will examine various forms of animated work produced between 1960 and the present, asking ourselves: Can animations about serious subjects lighten sad, macabre, depressing, and even horrific moments with a sense of playfulness and controlled distance? The class will survey a wide range of work from a diverse selection of artists operating in cinematic film forms alternative to commercial animation. These will include, but not be limited to, hand-drawn, cell-painted, cutout, stop-motion, pixilated, puppet, digital, and, more recently, CGI independents. In most cases, auteur artists working with stories of trauma, memory, language, and struggleâwhether personal, social, or politicalâare attempting to put their subjects in perspective. Using the core of these sources to pose difficult and personal questions, artist-animators tackle tough issues that ultimately serve as a reflection and reframing of experience. In response to the films we watch, the class group will discuss how personal and cultural struggles have been used as resonating topics large enough to act as a central conflict for animated films. Through screenings, readings, panels of visitors, and discussions, we will investigate both the reasoning for and success of animation's ability to confront the problems that challenge us. Students in this class will be expected to participate in discussions during conference meetings. Animation production will not be taught; however, a creative conference project in studio arts, writing, media, or performing arts will be required. In addition, students will be expected to complete weekly readings and entries in a research/creative practice notebook.\n\nThis is a course in which you will conceive a short film from its very basis to the final completion. In the first half of the year, we will explore a creative and deep examination of the foundations and processes of writing with images and sounds. The course provides a path to a certain type of sensitivity that helps writers create not just the screenplay for the course but also all of their screenplays to follow. What are the fundamental skills you need for writing a film? What is the time of observation that we need to do in order to be able to translate it into words? The script is a descriptive representation of the images and sounds that the writer has created in his or her imaginationâbeginning with the construction of an image that nests a story and exploring its possible forms and shapes, imagining characters from the inside outward, and then situating them in the image to let them grow. In the second part of the year, we will be exploring all of the areas of staging and styles in order to digest all of the information that we can make out of the scriptâfrom the very first impression of our story, through the actual image, until the editing. Working with each other on projects in a constructive and meaningful way and exploring an audiovisual style, the course will provide interaction and exposure to a wide range of types of film stylesâ from small to large productions. Some of our guiding questions will be: How do we understand the core of our image? How do we see scripts from a directing point of view? How is the image able to transmit emotions and thoughts? How can we develop critical and well-formulated thoughts of a film idea and expand our personal visual research? This class will have weekly conferences at least for the first semester.\n\nThis course focuses on the concepts of character-design development as a preproduction stage to animation. Students will gain knowledge in drawing by learning formal spatial concepts in order to create fully realized characters both visually and conceptually. Through the development of character boards, model sheets, beat boards, and character animatic projects, students will draw and conceptualize human, animal, mechanical, and hybrid figures. Students will research characters in their visual, environmental, psychological, and social aspects to establish a full understanding of characterization. Both hand-drawn materials and digital drawing will be used throughout the semester. Students may use their choice of drawing software, based on their own experience and skill level. Students new to digital drawing will work in Storyboard Pro software or Procreate software if they own an iPad. All students will have access to the animation roomsâwhich include a variety of software options, including Storyboard Pro, Harmony, Photoshop, Illustrator, and editing software Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premier. Assignments and projects will include character boards, model sheets, and animatics. There will be daily character drawing exercises, structural anatomy demonstrations, basic digital drawing concepts, and empirical perspective drawing discussions throughout the semester. This is a drawing course that requires a commitment to developing drawing skills and is labor intensive. Good drawing demands time, commitment, and intelligence. The final conference project for this course is a concept-based. fully-developed character animatic. Knowledge from this course can be used to create and enhance animations, to establish a character outline for an interactive media project, or to help in developing a cast of characters for game design, graphic novels, or narrative film.\n\nIn this course, students will develop animation and micro storytelling skills by focusing on the process of creating frame-by -frame digital drawings and keyframe movement for animation. This course is essentially an introduction to both the professional digital software, Harmony by Toon Boom, and the process of digital drawing and rotoscoping. Instruction will be based in the software, Toon Boom Harmony Premium, and will include line style, visualization, character development, continuity, timing, and compositing. All of the production steps required to develop simple 2D digital animations will be demonstrated and applied through exercises aimed at the production of a single animated scene. Participants will develop and refine their personal style through exercises in digital animation and assignments directed at increasing visual understanding. Digitally-drawn images (with the option to include live action and photographs) will be assembled in sync to sound. Compositing exercises will cover a wide range of motion graphics, including green screen, keyframing, timeline effects, 2D and 3D space, layering, and pose-by-pose movement. This one-semester class will provide students with a working knowledge of the emerging and highly efficient software Harmony, recently adopted by the film and TV animation industry. Conference projects involve each studentâs production of a single, refined animated scene. Students interested in then continuing in 2D digital animation in the spring semester will be encouraged to take the subsequent Intermediate/Advanced 2D Animation course.\n\nThis course will take the form of a screening and discussion seminar designed to provide an overview of alternative and experimental animations derived from the creative practice of transforming stories of trauma and struggle into films of artistic merit. We will examine various forms of animated work produced between 1960 and the present, asking ourselves: Can animations about serious subjects lighten sad, macabre, depressing, and even horrific moments with a sense of playfulness and controlled distance?

Animation production will not be taught; however a creative conference project in studio arts, writing, media, or performing arts will be required. In addition, students will be expected to complete weekly readings and entries in a research/creative practice notebook.\n\nThis course delves into the foundational aspects of preproduction and developmental concepts for media projects. Students will engage in âWorld Buildingâ exercises, wherein they research and design thematic approaches for specific projects. Emphasis will be placed on character development, compositional illustration, object and prop design, and scene building. Through the exploration of prompt themes, students will craft fully-realized projects that embody visual style, consistent form and function, and unified meaning, leading to the creation of unique media concepts. Both hand-drawn techniques and digital drawing tools will be utilized throughout the semester, with various software employed for character design, background paintings, and concept presentations. This course demands a commitment to the further development of drawing skills and is labor intensive. While having basic drawing skills is advantageous, students will be challenged to expand their abilities throughout the course. Multiple preproduction projects will be created to deepen understanding of thematic concepts. The final project will involve the production of a fully-developed, multicharacter/environment concept presentation. The knowledge gained in this course can be applied to creating and enhancing a preproduction or art portfolio, establishing a concept outline for an interactive media project, or developing characters and environments for graphic novels or films.\n\nThis course is designed to enlighten our creative consciousness, using music and nonfiction filmmaking as tools for liberation. Music and other sonic experiences are intrinsically connected to how we witness, experience, and tell nonfiction stories. In this course, we will examine work where the score itself plays a character while creating films of our own inspired by the soundtrack as a living piece of our form. Broken into groups, students collectively create a five-minute film that invites the viewer into subjects that are engaging and new while challenging the binary and often Western notion of what storytelling can be. The role that music and sound can play as a form of protest, meditation, and transformation is at the heart of our visual experience. In the spirit of global movements toward a more just and sustainable world, this course infuses a cinematic quest for truth in storytelling with the undeniable power that music brings to our understanding of a moment in time a scene, a relationship, and ourselves. From American UtopiaÂ to Amazing GraceÂ and Gimme Shelter, students will screen, discuss, and be inspired to create work that challenges all of the senses.\n\nFilm has become one of the most dominant forms of visual media and creative expression. In this seminar/workshop for the budding director, we will first focus on the filmmaking fundamentals that every filmmaker needs to know in order to tell an effective story on screen: basic filmmaking terms, crew positions, camera operation, shot angles and composition, camera movement, basic lighting, sound recording, and editing. Students will also learn to how to create shot lists, floor plans, and other important tools necessary for a successful shoot. Initially, solo shooting assignments will be given, allowing students to begin to develop their own cinematic voice. Because collaboration is key in filmmaking, students will also be divided into small groups for several weekly assignments, giving them the opportunity to serve in various roles on the crew. The idea is for students to acquire the skills needed for creating compelling cinematic work on their own and with others.\n\nFilm has become one of the most dominant forms of visual media and creative expression.

The idea is for students to acquire the skills needed for creating compelling cinematic work both on their own and with others.\n\nIn this yearlong seminar, we will begin by examining competing paradigms and approaches to understanding âdevelopmentâ and the âThird World.â We will set the stage by answering the question: What did the world look like 500 years ago? The purpose of this part of the course is to acquaint us with and to analyze the historical origins and evolution of a world political economy of which the \"Third World\" is an intrinsic component. We will thus study the transition from feudalism to capitalism, the rise of merchant and finance capital, and the colonization of the world by European powers. We will analyze case studies of colonial \"development\" to understand the evolving meaning of this term. These case studies will help us assess the varied legacies of colonialism apparent in the emergence of new nations through the fitful and uneven process of decolonization that followed. The next part of the course will look at the United Nations and the role that some of its associated institutions have played in the post-World War II global political economy, one marked by persistent and intensifying socioeconomic inequalities as well as frequent outbreaks of political violence across the globe. By examining the development institutions that have emerged and evolved since 1945, we will attempt to unravel the paradoxes of development in different eras. We will deconstruct the measures of development through a thematic exploration of population, resource use, poverty, access to food, the environment, agricultural productivity, and different development strategies adopted by Third World nation-states. We will then examine globalization and its relation to emergent international institutions and their policies; for example, the IMF, World Bank, AIIB, and WTO. We will then turn to contemporary development debates and controversies that increasingly find space in the headlinesâwidespread land grabbing by sovereign wealth funds, China, and hedge funds; the âglobal food crisisâ; epidemics and public-health challenges; and the perils of climate change. Throughout the course, our investigations of international institutions, transnational corporations, the role of the state, and civil society will provide the backdrop for the final focus of the class: the emergence of regional coalitions for self-reliance, environmental and social justice, and sustainable development. Our analysis of development in practice will draw upon case studies primarily from Africa but also from Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the United States. Conference work will be closely integrated with the themes of the course, with a two-stage substantive research project beginning in the fall semester and completed in the spring. Project presentations will incorporate a range of formats, from traditional papers to multimedia visual productions. Smaller creative projects are also a component of the course, including podcasts, videos, art, music, and other forms. Where possible and feasible, students will be encouraged to do primary research during fall study days and winter and spring breaks. Some experience in the social sciences is desired but not required.\n\nSouth Asia, a region at the geographic center of the worldâs most important cultural, religious, and commercial encounters for millennia, has a rich history of cultural exchanges. Its central location on the Indian Ocean provided it with transnational maritime connections to Africa and Southeast Asia, while its land routes facilitated constant contact with the Eurasian continent. The region has witnessed numerous foreign rules, from the early Central Asian Turkic dynasties to the Mughals and, finally, the British. After gaining independence from British colonial rule, the region was eventually partitioned into three different nationsâIndia, Pakistan, and Bangladeshâeach with its distinctive form of government. South Asia has produced a significant diaspora worldwide, preserving its cultural heritage and creating further cultural exchanges with the adopted nations, thereby influencing global culture. Despite facing development challenges and political instability, South Asia is rapidly developing within the capitalistic world economy and becoming an important player on the global scene, both politically and culturally. This course will provide students with a survey of South Asia from the era of the early Indus Civilization to the present. Lectures and sources will trace major political events and the regionâs cultural, ecological, and economic developments that have significantly shaped South Asian history. Students will analyze both primary and secondary sources, enhancing their understanding of this diverse society. They are expected to engage in lectures, reading, class discussions, group work, and writing to examine the major themes and debates in South Asian history and develop sound arguments.\n\nThe Indian Ocean is the third-largest ocean in the world and contributes almost 30 percent to the total oceanic realm of our planet. Current scholars have defined the Indian Ocean to include the oceanic and littoral spaces in the southwest from the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, to the Red Sea in the north, then horizontally through to the South China Sea in the east, and down to Australia in the southeast. Commerce around the Indian Ocean continued as a web of production and trade that spanned across the ports of India, the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Indian Ocean ports were the fulcrum of maritime trade that precipitated spontaneous transcultural interactions between traders and inhabitants of different geographic regions who mingled there to exchange commodities. Ships followed monsoons or seasonal wind patterns, and sailors were obliged to wait at length for return departures from ports, which was a significant cause of cultural transfer. Various religions, including Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism, were mobile across the Indian Ocean networks; and extant beliefs, practices, and material cultures are evidence. The study of the Indian Ocean World (IOW), as some historians have termed it, is a newly emerging field in world history. New evidence from historical research of the last 30 years has recovered the lost significance of this region, which was the center of a robust and complex trade and cultural network for a millennium and that continues today. This course is designed to provide students with a survey of Indian Ocean world history from the medieval to the colonial era. Lectures and sources will help students deepen their knowledge of peoples and cultures around the Indian Ocean and gain a wider appreciation for the transnational trade and cultural and religious networks that existed there. Students will learn to examine that globalization is not a modern phenomenon but, rather, an ongoing aspect of the Indian Ocean. Each week, students will evaluate sources that explore the discrete regions of the Indian Ocean, their people, and the religious networks, commercial exchanges, migrations, and political events that they engender to make a complex and dynamic connected history. Students are expected to engage in lectures, reading, class discussions, group work, and writing to examine the major themes and debates in Indian Ocean history and develop sound arguments.\n\nThis course, for students with no previous knowledge of Italian, aims at providing a complete foundation in the Italian language, with particular attention to oral and written communication and all aspects of Italian culture. The course will be conducted in Italian after the first month and will involve the study of all basic structures of the languageâphonological, grammatical, and syntacticalâwith practice in conversation, reading, composition, and translation. In addition to material covering basic Italian grammar, students will be exposed to fiction, poetry, songs, articles, recipe books, and films. Group conferences (held once a week) aim at enriching the studentsâ knowledge of Italian culture and developing their ability to communicate. This will be achieved by readings that deal with current events and topics relative to todayâs Italian culture. Activities in pairs or groups, along with short written assignments, will be part of the group conference. In addition to class and the group conferences, the course has a conversation component in regular workshops with the language assistant. Conversation classes are held twice a week (in small groups) and will center on the concept of Viaggio in Italia: a journey through the regions of Italy through cuisine, cinema, art, opera, and dialects. The Italian program organizes trips to the Metropolitan Opera and relevant exhibits in New York City, as well as the possibility of experiencing Italian cuisine firsthand as a group. The course is for a full year, by the end of which students will attain a basic competence in all aspects of the language.\n\nThis course aims at improving and perfecting the studentsâ speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills, as well as their knowledge of Italyâs contemporary culture and literature. In order to acquire the necessary knowledge of Italian grammar, idiomatic expressions, and vocabulary, a review of all grammar will be carried out throughout the year. As an introduction to modern Italian culture and literature, students will be introduced to a selection of short stories, poems, and passages from novels, as well as specific newspaper articles, music, and films in the original language. Some of the literary works will include selections from Umberto Eco, Italo Calvino, Natalia Ginzburg, Gianni Rodari, Marcello DâOrta, Clara Sereni, Dino Buzzati, Stefano Benni, Antonio Tabucchi, Alberto Moravia, Achille Campanile, and Elena Ferrante. In order to address the studentsâ writing skills, written compositions will be required as an integral part of the course. All material is accessible on MySLC. Conferences are held on a biweekly basis; topics might include the study of a particular author, literary text, film, or any other aspect of Italian society and culture that might be of interest to the student. Conversation classes (in small groups) will be held twice a week with the language assistant, during which students will have the opportunity to reinforce what they have learned in class and hone their ability to communicate in Italian. When appropriate, students will be directed to specific internship opportunities in the New York City area, centered on Italian language and culture.\n\nOne of the goals of this course is to demonstrate the ways in which modern poetry originated in the Romantic period. In the wake of the French Revolution, Blake, Wordsworth, and Coleridge invented a new kind of autobiographical poetry that internalized the myths they had inherited from literary and religious traditions. The poetâs inner life became the inescapable subject of the poem. In the second semester, we will trace the impact of Romanticism on subsequent generations of poets writing in English, from Walt Whitman to T. S. Eliot. Our preeminent goal will be to appreciate each poetâsâindeed, each poemâsâunique contribution to the language. Our understanding of literary and historical trends will emerge from the close, imaginative reading of texts. Authors will include, among others: Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Whitman, Dickinson, Tennyson, Robert Browning, Christina Rossetti, Hardy, Frost, Yeats, and T. S. Eliot. Individual conferences will meet every week until October Study Days and every other week thereafter.\n\nAutobiographies, biographies, diaries, and memoirs are all ways of capturing a life between the covers of a book. This FYS course in literature will examine various genres of life writing from the 19th through 21st centuries, from works that attempt to tell a full âcradle-to-graveâ story of a life to experiments with shifting points of view or exploring nonhuman consciousness. We will read examples of life writing from the Victorian and Modernist periods, as well as more recent graphic memoirs and works of autofiction. Texts on the syllabus by Elizabeth Gaskell, George Orwell, Audre Lorde, Maggie Nelson, and others reveal the expansiveness of life-writing genres. These texts will raise questions about how to distinguish truth from fabulation, whether it is possible to fully know ourselves or others, the degree to which an individual is shaped by his/her social environment, and the reliability of memory. We will look at how memoirists connect the introspective and personal to wider political and historical concerns and how biographers address both the triumphs and the failings of their famous subjects. Visiting speakers will discuss their experiences writing biographies and memoirs and what they have learned in the process about writing, researching, and publishing. Throughout the semester, students will engage in analytic and reflective writing that connects the course content to their own experiences and observations. For conference work, students will have a choice between three group conferences that will meet biweekly. Each conference group will focus on a distinct life-writing skill: reviews, interviews, and archival research. Conference projects will include the following options: 1) creating a review of books of recent biographies and memoirs; 2) contributing to an interview-based podcast series; and 3) making a digital project based on archival research. The goal of the course is to learn a range of writing and research skills while also tackling big questions about what it means to live a good life. Examining how to write a life, we will also explore how to make a life as a writer in college and beyond.\n\nThis course will examine literature written by late 19th- and 20th-century Italian women writers. In the newly unified Italy, middle-class women began in great numbers to access and contribute to literature as both readers and writers. The increasing presence of women writers caused great upheaval, as the male literary establishment viewed the potential for a disruption to the canon. The anxiety caused by their presence is visible in the manner in which they were dismissed as imitating male literary models, accused of excessive sentimentality and self-disclosure, or dubbed by critics il pericolo roseo, âthe pink dangerâ (L. Zuccoli, Corriere della sera, March 24, 1911). Yet, many of these women writers reveal sophistication in their ability to experiment with genres and styles and engage with some of Italyâs literary movements (e.g., verismo, futurism, magic realism, neorealism) and intellectuals, as well as crucial historical events such as fascism and World War II. As we will see, they often question or reverse traditional depictions of femininity. They show an awareness of the social roles and expectations demanded of them and often interrogate such roles and some of the tropes present in the works of the time (e.g., the femme fatale, the self-sacrificing wife and mother). Many of them assert their own defiant voice and their own perspective as women writers, (re)claiming a place in the canon of Italian literature. In this course, we will explore how their works address social issues related to family, marriage, and womenâs changing roles, as well as the place of womenâs writing in the Italian literary canon. Our readings will include works by Marchesa Colombi (M. A. Torriani), Sibilla Aleramo, Grazia Deledda, Ada Negri, Rosa RosÃ , Paola Masino, Renata ViganÃ², Joyce Lussu, Anna Banti, Anna Maria Ortese, Alba de CÃ©spedes, Elsa Morante, Natalia Ginzburg, and Dacia Maraini. These works will be examined in dialogue with the literary production and ideas of male or canonical authors. Primary sources will range from fiction (novels, short stories, and fictional diaries) to autobiographical texts, poems, plays, and newspaper articles; these sources will be supplemented by secondary readings on womenâs literature and history and on occasion by films. No previous knowledge of Italian is required. Students proficient in Italian may opt to read sources in the original. Conference topics may include the study of a particular author, literary text, or topic relevant to the course and that is of interest to the student. As an FYS course, students will meet individually in conference with the instructor/don every week until October Study Days and every two weeks after that.\n\nAre human beings capable of self-government? What does that require? As modern authoritarian movements imperil democratic institutions, norms, and the rule of law, ancient Greek tragedies illuminate values and aspirations underpinning democracy and modern liberal ideals of justice, equality, and universal human rights. Tragedy and democracy emerged simultaneously in ancient Athens in the late 6th century BCE and flourished throughout the 5th century BCE. Ancient Greece never achieved egalitarian politics or anything close to universal human rights, but Athenian tragedies emphasize the essential equality of all human beings in our vulnerability to suffering and death. Surviving plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides dramatize the costs of tyranny, anger, vengeance, and crueltyâto perpetrators, as well as to victims. Commending honesty, generosity, and compassion, tragedies locate nobility not in genetic inheritance, group affiliation, socioeconomic status, numerical superiority, or even moral or ideological convictions but, rather, in our conduct as individuals. Tragedies expose the consequences of human words and actions, as characters make choices conducive to success or failure for themselves and their communities. State-sponsored and publicly performed, tragedies made self-reflection and self-criticism a fundamental feature of Athenian democratic politics and society. âWhat should I do?â encapsulates the central question of every ancient Greek tragedy and every moment of our own lives. This course is designed for anyone interested in understanding the false promise of authoritarianism and appreciating the origins, goals, and possibilities for a free, humane, equitable democratic society.\n\nThe creative process is paradoxical. It involves freedom and spontaneity yet requires expertise and hard work. The creative process is self-expressive yet tends to unfold most easily when the creator forgets about self. The creative process brings joy yet is fraught with fear, frustration, and even terror. The creative process is its own reward yet depends on social support and encouragement. In this class, we look at how various thinkers conceptualize the creative processâchiefly in the arts but in other domains, as well. We see how various psychological theorists describe the process, its source, its motivation, its roots in a particular domain or skill, its cultural context, and its developmental history in the life of the individual. Among the thinkers that we will consider are Freud, Amabile, Arnheim, Franklin, and Gardner. Different theorists emphasize different aspects of the process. In particular, we see how some thinkers emphasize persistent work and expert knowledge as essential features, while others emphasize the need for the psychic freedom to âlet it happenâ and speculate on what emerges when the creative person âlets go.â Still others identify cultural context and motivational or biological factors as critical. To concretize theoretical approaches, we look at how various ideas can contribute to understanding specific creative people and their work. In particular, we will consider works written by or about Picasso, Woolf, Welty, Darwin, and some contemporary artists and writers. Though creativity is most frequently explored in individuals, we also consider group improvisation in music and theatre. Some past conference projects have involved interviewing people engaged in creative work. Others consisted of library studies centering on the life and work of a particular creative person. And some students chose to do fieldwork at the Early Childhood Center and focus on an aspect of creative activity in young children.\n\nChildrenâs books are an important bridge between adults and the world of children. What makes a childrenâs book attractive and developmentally appropriate for a child of a particular age? What is important to children as they read or listen? How do children become readers? How do picture-book illustrations complement the words? How can childrenâs books portray the uniqueness of a particular culture or subculture, allowing those within to see their experience reflected in books and those outside to gain insight into the lives of others? To what extent can books transcend the particularities of a given period and place? Course readings include writings about child development; works about childrenâs literature; and, most centrally, childrenâs books themselvesâpicture books, fairy tales, and novels for children. Class emphasis will be on books for children up to the age of about 12. Among our childrenâs book authors will be Margaret Wise Brown, C. S. Lewis, Katherine Paterson, Maurice Sendak, Matt de la Pena, Christopher Paul Curtis, E. B. White, and Vera B. Williams. Many different kinds of conference projects are appropriate for this course. In past years, for example, students have written original work for children (sometimes illustrating it, as well), traced a theme in childrenâs books, worked with children (and their books) in fieldwork and service-learning settings, explored childrenâs books that illuminate particular racial or ethnic experiences, or examined books that capture the challenge of various disabilities. At the end of each class session, we will have story time, during which two students will share childhood favorites.\n\nIn public discourse, we are bombarded with assertions of the newly âglobalâ nature of the contemporary world. This assertion assumes that former stable categories of personhood, ideational systems, nation, identity, and space are now fragmented and transcended by intensified travel, digital technology, and cross-cultural contact. This seminar is based on the premise that people have traveled throughout history; current global moves are but the most recent manifestation of a phenomenon that has historically occurred in many forms and places. This long(er) view of mobility will allow us to rethink and reexamine not only our notions of travel but their shifting connotations and significance across time and space. We will explore how supposed stable categoriesâsuch as citizen, refugee, nation, and commodityâare constructed and consider several theoretical approaches that help us make sense of these categorizations, the processes accompanying their normalization and dissemination, and their underlying assumptions. Our questions will include: What are the political, navigational, and epistemological foundations that go into mapmaking and schemas of classification? How do nomads change into settled city dwellers or wageworkers? How does time become disciplined? How does travel change into tourism? How do commodities travel and acquire meaning? What is the relationship between legal and illicit moves? How do technologies of violence, such as weapons and drugs, circulate? What is the meaning of their circulation in different contexts? How do modern technologies enable time/space compression? What are the shifting logics of globalization? What is their relationship to our notions and constructions of authenticity, subjectivity, and identity? During the fall semester, we will begin by developing an analytical approach toward our topic (which we will continue to develop throughout the year). We will then consider the implications of classification, categorization, and mapping. For the remainder of the semester, we will follow the travel(s) of ideas, commodities, and people. In the process, we will begin to think about questions of time/space compression. In the spring, we will return to some of the themes of the fall semester but examine them in a different context and through a different lens. Among our concerns in the spring semester will be issues of fusion and hybridization in cultural practices regarding people and things (e.g., food, music, romance, families); shifting places (e.g., borders, travel, and tourism); time/space compression through new technologies of travel and communication; and drugs, terror, violence, and poverty. As our sources, we will rely primarily on interdisciplinary analytical writings but will also include travel narratives, literature, and films."
