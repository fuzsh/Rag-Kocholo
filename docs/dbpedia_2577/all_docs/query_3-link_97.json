Its a fun read\n\nthe perfect voice for the Dale Brown series\n\nI have been a big fan of Dale Brown's Series Dreamland. Keep them coming! I have been a big fan of Dale Brown's books ever since I discovered the Tin Man, and was a big fan of how he brought a lot of modern day technology into his writing, years before it was news.\n\nBest of the \"Cold War\" era books\n\nWhere does Flight of the Old Dog rank among all the audiobooks you’ve listened to so far?\n\ntop 20\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of Flight of the Old Dog?\n\nThe flight back\n\nHave you listened to any of Richard Allen’s other performances before? How does this one compare?\n\nhe does justice to what was in my head when i read the book\n\nIf you could give Flight of the Old Dog a new subtitle, what would it be?\n\nnone\n\nCold War Gets Hot\n\nThe detail with which the author describes operations might make some eyes glaze over, but it helps put you in the action in a more realistic manner. You don't flip a switch and the Buff flies itself, even today. Interesting to read about the \"advanced\" technology that we take for granted today, such as GPS."
