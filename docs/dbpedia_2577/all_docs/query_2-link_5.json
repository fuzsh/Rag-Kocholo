        "text": "published on 2024-07-01T22:16:46Z\n\n#authorsontheair #OntheairwithFlorenza #DaleBrown #TheDevilsFortress #authorinterview #Florenza_Lee #Florenza_denise_lee #Dale_Brown Author Dale Brown co-hosts On the Air with Florenza to discuss his newest book, The Devil's Fortress. He and Florenza discuss his process and little-known facts about the book, and he reveals hints regarding a possible new series. Dale experienced poor connectivity during the recording, resulting in slightly chopping audio. The information was so goooood, Florenza didn't want to lose any of the nuggets with a re-record. Thank you for listening to this very insightful exchange. The Devil's Fortress: The fourth book in the Nick Flynn series from Dale Brown and Patrick Larkin, this page-turning military thriller is perfect for fans of Tom Clancy, Robert Ludlum, and James Bond. Nick Flynn and his Quartet Directorate special action team launched a daring, high-risk mission deep into Russia itself--a mission aimed at destroying the threat posed by Russian oligarch Pavel Voronin once and for all. Backed by Russia's autocratic president, Piotr Zhdanov, mercenary oligarch Pavel Voronin readies another deadly covert assault on the United States and its allies. Previously in the series, Nick Flynn and his team thwarted Voroninâthough only at the last minute and at a high cost. However, Flynn, the daring pilot, agent Laura Van Horn, and others no longer play defense. They're coming for Voroninâdetermined to take the fight directly to their dangerous foe in a high-stakes, all-or-nothing strike deep into enemy territory.\n\nGenre\n\n#author_interviews"
