        "text": "Introduction\n\nCommunities of color in the United States (US) have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are at increased risk of being hospitalized or dying from the virus [1]. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in March 2022 showed that COVID-19 hospitalization rates were 2.4 times higher for Black non-Hispanic and for Hispanic or Latinx people than White non-Hispanic people [2]. Factors that have contributed to the increased risk of infection, hospitalization, and death from the virus in racial and ethnic minorities include discrimination, lower healthcare access, and occupation types such as healthcare workers or individuals unable to work from home [3–5].\n\nIn addition to COVID-19 disproportionately affecting communities of color, racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy persist [6]. Thus, it is important to discuss COVID-19 vaccine attitudes among racial groups in the US. For this paper, vaccine hesitancy was defined as “when there is a low perception of need for a vaccination (termed complacency) and concerns over the efficacy and safety (termed low confidence)” [7]. Prior to the release of COVID-19 vaccines, a US adult population survey found that Black Americans were less likely than White Americans to accept a potential COVID-19 vaccine [6]. Furthermore, in 2020, a nationally conducted Pew Research Center survey found that 54% of Black adults said they would “definitely/probably get a COVID-19 vaccine if it were available today” compared to 74% of White adults and 74% of Hispanic adults of any race [8]. Although the reason for such disparities may be multifaceted, two factors that may drive the differences in vaccination intentions are medical mistrust and racially based discriminatory experiences [9, 10].\n\nMedical mistrust has been identified as an important barrier to healthcare for communities of color. A survey found that 35% of Black adults expressed a great deal of confidence that medical scientists act in the best interest of the public, compared to 43% of White adults [8]. Black individuals are more likely to demonstrate vaccine hesitancy due to their lack of confidence in the safety of vaccines and the healthcare system compared to their White counterparts [11]. Medical mistrust influences behavioral patterns and responses, which can negatively affect satisfaction with care, provider trust, and treatment adherence [12]. A systematic review of the association between medical mistrust and health outcomes found that many participants who belong to marginalized communities report mistrust due to historical experiences of discrimination and injustice [12].\n\nThere is additional evidence that racially discriminatory experiences influence healthcare utilization, including the use of vaccines [13, 14]. A healthcare quality study found that people of color were significantly more likely to report experiences of perceived discrimination in healthcare settings [13]. Those who reported racially discriminatory experiences in provider settings were more likely to put off care and not follow medical advice [13]. A study assessing the association between factors such as discrimination and flu vaccine behavior found that for Black individuals, higher perception of discrimination is associated with lower probability of getting the flu vaccine [14]. Furthermore, any past experiences with racial discrimination were a predictor of vaccine hesitancy [10].\n\nRacial discrimination, injustice, and exploitation of Black bodies pervade the history of medicine and research. In the South, during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, physicians used enslaved Black people as subjects for experimental surgical procedures. James Marion Sims, known as the “Father of Modern Gynecology,” performed experimental reproductive surgeries on enslaved Black women without anesthesia [15]. The exploitation of Black bodies persisted well into the twentieth century. The Tuskegee Syphilis Study, conducted from 1932 until 1972 in which 600 Black men were enlisted without proper consent to explore the natural history of syphilis without access to penicillin treatment, is an egregious example [16]. Another form of medical exploitation present throughout American history is the forced sterilization of Black women. For example, in 1961, Fannie Lou Hamer, a Black woman from rural Mississippi, was sent to surgery to remove a benign tumor and ultimately had her uterus removed without her consent [17]. Racist events such as these, in the context of medical research, have led to efforts such as the establishment of the Belmont Report for the protection of human participants in research. While efforts to protect human subjects were essential steps to promote ethics in research, the lasting influence of historical medical mistreatment may help to explain the higher proportion of vaccine hesitancy and medical mistrust in Black communities.\n\nEcosocial theory and critical race theory can be employed to further understand how medical mistrust and perceived discrimination can mediate the relationship between race and vaccine hesitancy. Ecosocial theory is centered on the analysis of health predictors on each level of biological, ecological, and social organization [18]. Ecosocial theory predicts that individuals biologically incorporate social experiences which are ultimately expressed through health, disease, and well-being [19]. Ecological and social factors such as the neighborhood environment, access and availability to healthcare services, and quality of care may influence vaccine hesitancy in communities of color. Critical race theory also provides a framework for analyzing varying experiences of perceived discrimination and medical mistrust, by presenting race as an indicator of racism-related exposures [20]. For example, a prospective cohort study found that Black women reporting racial discrimination in three or more situations had an increased chance of giving birth to infants with low birthweight [21]. Race can serve as a signifier of potential risks because of racism. As a result, risk of exposures to experiences such as perceived discrimination can vary by racial category [20].\n\nAs both medical mistrust and racially based discriminatory experiences have been associated with decreases in seeking medical treatment, including vaccination, and adhering to medical advice, these two factors may also be associated with the lack of willingness to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine specifically in communities of color [13, 14].This study aimed to assess the association of discrimination and medical mistrust with COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy and behavior among different racial and ethnic groups. We hypothesized that individuals of color had increased COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy as compared to White individuals and perceived discrimination and medical mistrust mediated this relationship.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study tested whether race and ethnicity were associated with COVID-19 vaccine behavior, and if perceived discrimination and medical mistrust mediated this relationship. Our hypothesis was partially supported in that medical mistrust was significantly related to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. When accounting for medical mistrust, Black non-Hispanic/Black Hispanic/White Hispanic individuals had lower odds of having the COVID-19 vaccine compared to White non-Hispanic individuals. Similarly, when accounting for perceived discrimination, Black non-Hispanic/Black Hispanic/White Hispanic individuals were less likely than White non-Hispanic individuals to have any dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, medical mistrust, but not perceived discrimination, was related to receiving any dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. While these constructs did not independently mediate the relationship between race/ethnicity and vaccination behavior, their combined effect was significant, suggesting that a complex and multifactorial process may drive the observed disparities due to race/ethnicity. Similar to our results, previous studies have found that racially discriminatory experiences influence vaccine usage [13, 14].\n\nFrom an ecosocial theory perspective, we observed that when accounting for medical mistrust and perceived discrimination those who at least attended high school were more likely to have the COVID-19 vaccine as compared to those who did not. Additionally, those who were more worried about COVID-19 infection were more likely to have the COVID-19 vaccine as compared to those who were not worried. Those who at least attended high school may have higher health literacy and be more likely to accept messages surrounding vaccination [32]. This may help explain why those individuals were more likely to have the COVID-19 vaccine as compared to those who did not complete high school. Additionally, those who were more worried about COVID-19 infection may be of older age, have conditions that put them at greater risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19, or have family members who had COVID-19 [27]. Factors such as these may explain why those individuals were more likely to have the vaccine compared to those who were not worried or had COVID-19 previously. In the future, potential interventions to promote vaccination may consider utilizing educational materials to ensure all individuals understand the risks of COVID-19 infection and the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. More studies are needed to assess how social and environmental factors such as these may shape vaccine behavior especially in communities of color.\n\nWithin communities of color, experiences of medical mistrust have been demonstrated to impact vaccine hesitancy as well as perceived discrimination [10, 11]. Critical race theory presents race as a marker for racism-related exposures such as perceived discrimination and medical mistrust [20]. We hypothesized that due to their race and ethnicity, individuals of color would have more experiences of perceived discrimination and higher levels of medical mistrust. The demographic characteristics of our sample showed that on average Black non-Hispanic/Black Hispanic/White Hispanic had significantly higher perceived discrimination scores as compared to White non-Hispanic individuals. Additionally, on average Black non-Hispanic/Black Hispanic/White Hispanic individuals had higher medical mistrust scores as compared to White non-Hispanic individuals. Our findings indicate that as a result of systemic racism, individuals of color are subject to more experiences of discrimination in their day-to-day lives. Additionally, our finding of higher levels of medical mistrust in communities of color may illustrate that Black and Latinx individuals internalize historical impacts of medical exploitation as well as discriminatory experiences with providers and medical systems. A lack of trust in medical systems and interventions may explain why individuals of color had decreased odds of having the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nA major implication of our findings is that increased levels of perceived discrimination and medical mistrust in communities of color may be one mediator of decreased COVID-19 vaccine usage. This interpretation may be speculative as we were unable to look at the outcomes of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and vaccine behavior between each individual racial and ethnic group. Given our initial findings regarding the mediators between race/ethnicity and COVID-19 vaccine behavior, further work on this topic is needed. Our findings indicate that initiatives to combat COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, especially within communities of color, need to explicitly consider experiences of racial discrimination and the enduring effect of historical medical exploitation that targeted communities of color. More research is needed to better understand the major drivers of vaccine hesitancy within different racial and ethnic groups and how to effectively combat these factors when promoting vaccination.\n\nLimitations\n\nAs noted in Monnig et al. [22], the limitations of this study include a non-representative convenience sample and self-reported data. Additionally, our findings are not generalizable to the US population as a whole, but our estimates and associations should be used to inform future research. Another major limitation was that race and ethnicity were collapsed due to the small sample size of our race and ethnicities of interest that reported vaccine hesitancy. For this study, we wanted to look at race and ethnicity independently, but those comparisons were difficult due to the number of participants in the respective subcategories, which would have made estimation of robust standard errors challenging. The combination of racial and ethnic groups limits our ability to fully understand how medical mistrust and perceived discrimination drive vaccine hesitancy in different communities. Future studies may seek to maintain distinct racial/ethnic categories to provide more insight on this relationship. Additionally, another limitation was the absence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy data for all of the longitudinal survey respondents. Since only those who did not already have the COVID-19 vaccine were asked the vaccine hesitancy questions, our sample size was smaller than expected. We did not observe statistical associations between race and ethnicity and vaccine hesitancy when accounting for medical mistrust and perceived discrimination along with our other covariates. For our racial and ethnic categories of interest, the study may not have had sufficient power to detect differences in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Future studies may seek to address this limitation by presenting vaccine hesitancy questions to all survey participants regardless of vaccine status.\n\nRecode Information\n\nRace: We created a combined race/ethnicity variable recoded to White, non-Hispanic if race = white and ethnicity = not Hispanic and no other racial categories were endorsed, Black non-Hispanic if race = black and ethnicity = not Hispanic and no other racial categories were endorsed, Black Hispanic if race = black and ethnicity = Hispanic and no other racial categories were endorsed, and White Hispanic if race = white and ethnicity = Hispanic and no other racial categories were endorsed.\n\nGender: We created a combined sex and gender variable recoded to cisgender male if sex = male and gender = man and no other gender identities were endorsed, cisgender female if sex = female and gender = woman and no other gender identities were endorsed, other for all other combinations.\n\nLiving alone: We created a binary variable for people living in the household and recoded to living alone if people living in the house besides myself = 0 and living with other people if people living in the house besides myself ≥ 1.\n\nEducation: We created a binary variable for education recoded to high school/equivalent if last grade or year in school = high school/equivalent, and anything else if last grade or year in school = some college, college, or graduate degree.\n\nEmployment status: We recoded full-time employee if current job status = employment full-time, part-time if current job status = employment part-time, and not employed or student if current job status = student, retired, homemaker, or currently not employed.\n\nEssential worker status: We recoded not essential worker status if essential worker status = no or essential worker status = not sure.\n\nPerceived discrimination due to race or ancestry/origin: We created a combined perceived discrimination and reasons for discrimination variable recoded to perceived discrimination due to race or ancestry/origin if the individual had a perceived discrimination sum score and indicated that they were discriminated against because of their race or their ancestry/origin."
