        "text": "Copyright 2000 by the author. Please do not reproduce. Some of this material is adapted from The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home, which contains more detailed information on the topic.\n\nReading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.\n\n-Richard Steele, The Tatler\n\nI. Why use the Great Books as the center of a literature and history curriculum?\n\nA. Using the Great Books breaks down the artificial division between history and literature.\n\nB. Instead of memorizing facts about the past, the student is encouraged to interact with the ideas of the past.\n\nC. Using the Great Books as the center of a history/literature course also encourages the student to think about how we know what we know about the past.\n\nD. The goal of the study of Great Books is a greater understanding of our own civilization, country, and place in time, stemming from an understanding of what has come before us.\n\nII. Caveats\n\nA. The goal of classical education is not an exhaustive exploration of great literature, but an introduction to the ideas of the past.\n\nB. If a student tackles a book on the list and, after a good try, finds it incomprehensible, move on.\n\nC. List making is a dangerous occupation. We’ve left important books off this list. We’ve put titles on it that you may find trivial. All lists reflect ideology; add or drop titles to adjust lists to your own purposes.\n\nIII. The pattern of study\n\nAncients 6000 BC-AD 400\n\nMedieval/Early Renaissance AD 400-1600\n\nLate Renaissance/Early Modern 1600-1850\n\nModern 1850-Present\n\n(This gives you more or less an equal number of important texts to cover during each period.)\n\nIV. INTERMEDIATE GREAT BOOKS STUDY (5th-8th grade)\n\nA. Establish the framework of historical facts, using a decent book of world history (the Kingfisher History Encyclopedia).\n\n1. Set a goal for the year (6000 BC through 400 AD) and read through these pages over the course of your year’s study.\n\n2. Steer away from history texts, which provide a predigested interpretation of history.\n\n3. Look for something that progresses chronologically rather than by country. (Explain why.)\n\nB. Keep a time line of important events — birth and death of important people, battles, scientific discoveries, etc.\n\nC. Read through the Booklist chronologically.\n\n1. Mark the birth and death dates of the authors on the time line. Highlight the life span in a particular color.\n\n2. Read the book.\n\n3. Talk about the book with the child.\n\na. For a novel/story:\n\nWho is this book about? (central character[s])\n\nWhat do the central characters want?\n\nWhat keeps them/him/her from getting it?\n\nHow do they/him/her get what they want?\n\nDo they have an enemy or enemies? Is there a villain?\n\nWhat does the villain want?\n\nWhat do you think is the most important event in the story?\n\nWhat leads up to this event?\n\nHow are the characters different after this event?\n\nPick out the most important event in each chapter.\n\nHow many different stories does the writer tell?\n\nb. For evaluation:\n\nWhat was the most exciting part of the book?\n\nWhat was the most boring part of the book?\n\nDid you like the character[s]? Why or why not?\n\nDid you hope that he/she would get what he/she wanted?\n\nDid any part of the book seem particularly real?\n\nDid any part of the book seem unlikely to you?\n\nDid you hope it would end in another way? How?\n\nWould you read this book again?\n\nWhich one of your friends would enjoy this book?\n\n4. Write about the book.\n\na. Begin with simple narratives — having the student retell the story of the book in his or her own words. Aim for 1 page. Help him to evaluate each detail by asking questions: “Is that important later on? Would the story still makes sense if you left that part out? Does that character show up again at the end of the book? What does he do? If you leave him out of your report, will the story end the same way?” At the end of the narration, ask the child to write a one- or two-sentence evaluation of the book that includes specific reasons why he did or didn’t like the book.\n\nb. Move towards doing an evaluative paper: that is, a short essay (start with 1 page!) answering one of the above questions. This is beginning socratic dialogue. Use Reading Strands (National Writing Institute), a step by step guide to beginning Socratic dialogue.\n\n5) Put the compositions in a notebook.\n\nD.

Preparation:\n\nMortimer Adler, How to Read a Book\n\nOs Guiness and Louise Cowan, Introduction to the Classics\n\nNational Writing Institute, Reading Strands\n\nB. Set the framework of historical facts and then read.\n\n1. Resources:\n\nA Short History of Western Civilization (Harrison)\n\nThe Timetables of History (Simon & Schuster)\n\nDorling Kindersley History of the World.\n\n2. Divide study into four years:\n\nAncients (BC 5000-400 AD), ninth grade\n\nMedieval/Early Renaissance (400-1600), tenth grade\n\nLate Renaissance/Early Modern (1600-1850), eleventh grade\n\nModern (1850-present), twelfth grade.\n\n3. Keep a three-ringed notebook labelled Great Books:\n\na) Context\n\nb) Book Notes\n\nc) Compositions.\n\n4) For each book on the list, the student should follow this pattern:\n\na) Create a context page. Glance at the appropriate pages in the Timetables of History and the History of the World. Read the corresponding section in the Short History of Western Civilization. Then, write a one-page summary setting the book in historical perspective. Give basic information about the author, his times, his country, and his purposes in writing; summarize great events going on in the rest of the world. File this page under Context.\n\nb) Read through the text, pencil in hand, using the techniques suggested in Mortimer Adler’s How to Read a Book. File all the notes you take on the book in the Book Notes section of the Great Books notebook.\n\nc) Discuss the text. Talk about its purposes, its strengths and weaknesses. Have a conversation about the ideas.\n\nd) Write about the text: an evaluation, an argumentative essay proving some point about the book, or an analysis of the book’s ideas. Put the finished composition (at least two pages) in the Compositions section of the notebook.\n\nC.
