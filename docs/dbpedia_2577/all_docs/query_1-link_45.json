        "text": "Dale Brown, the bestselling author of the Brad McLanahan technothrillers, is taking readers back to space with Eagle Station, his latest action-packed novel, scheduled for publication on May 26, 2020.\n\nBrown, a pioneer of the technothriller, refreshed his longrunning series in 2019 with The Kremlin Strike, which pivoted away from the ground-based Iron Wolf Squadron—a fleet of Cybernetic Infantry Devices—and introduced the newly formed Space Force.\n\nWhile the twelve-foot piloted combat robots are still front and center, Brown’s transition to space warfare has energized the franchise, and though McLanahan and America dealt the Russians a mighty blow last time around, Eagle Station will feature the anticipated rematch . . . which promises to be even bigger and more explosive than before.\n\nSee the official cover art and plot details below.\n\nIn this thrilling geopolitical technological adventure from New York Times bestselling legend Dale Brown, Brad McLanahan and the Space Force must fight to preserve America’s freedom when a pair of ruthless enemies forge an unlikely alliance to control not only the earth, but the moon and beyond.\n\nBecause its enemies never stop trying to undermine the United States’ security, the men and women who serve to protect America must always be vigilant. Few know this better than warriors Brad McLanahan and Nadia Rozek. Newly married, the two are just beginning to settle into their new life together when they are called back into action.\n\nThough the Russians were badly defeated by Brad and the Iron Wolf Squadron in their previous bid for world dominance, they are back and doubling down on their quest for control of outer space. In addition to their cutting-edge weaponry, they have a formidable new ally: China’s energetic and ruthless leader, President Li Jun.\n\nTo protect America and the rest of the free world from the Russians and the Chinese, the Americans plan to mine the moon’s helium-3 resources, which will allow them to fully exploit the revolutionary fusion power technology Brad and his team captured from the Russians aboard the Mars One weapons platform.\n\nBut Leonov and Li have devised a daring plan of their own. They are building a joint secret base on the moon’s far side fortified with a powerful Russian plasma rail gun that can destroy any spacecraft entering lunar orbit. If the heavily armed base becomes operational, it will give America’s enemies control over the world’s economic and military future.\n\nAs this latest skirmish in the war for space accelerates, Brad, Nadia, and their compatriots in the Space Force must use their cunning and skill—and America’s own high-tech weaponry—to derail the Sino-Russian alliance and destroy their lunar site before it’s too late for the U.S. . . . and the entire world.\n\nORDER NOW\n\nFormer U.S. Air Force captain Dale Brown is the author of 26 best-selling action-adventure “techno-thriller” novels. He is also the co-author of the best-selling DREAMLAND techno-thriller series and writer and the PUPPET MASTER series, and is a technical consultant of the Act of War PC real-time strategy game published by Atari Interactive, and the Megafortress PC flight simulator by Three-Sixty Pacific. Dale’s novels are published in 11 languages and distributed to over 70 countries. Worldwide sales of his novels, audiobooks, e-books, and computer games exceed 15 million copies.\n\nEagle Station, the next can’t-miss Brad McLanahan thriller, is now available for pre-order wherever books are sold.\n\nPraised as “One of the hardest working, most thoughtful, and fairest reviewers out there” by #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Scottoline, Ryan Steck has “quickly established himself as the authority on mysteries and thrillers” (Author A.J. Tata). Steck also works full-time as a freelance developmental editor and pens a monthly thriller column for CrimeReads. For more information, be sure to follow him on Twitter and Facebook. He currently lives in Southwest Michigan with his wife and their six children.\n\nRelated\n\nFacebook Comments\n\ncomments"
