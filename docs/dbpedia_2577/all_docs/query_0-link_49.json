Google the term – coined by former GE CEO Jack Welch – and you’ll learn that it’s most often applied in business to explain an organization that throws caution to the wind, scrapping boundaries, and bureaucracies in order to tap the internal power of its people to directly enact change.\n\nFor more than 50 years, the School of Social Sciences at UCI has been putting this approach into practice, breaking down traditional barriers to create change in society, economies, and for human well-being. But never has this boundaryless-mindset been more important than today.\n\nThe 21st century has brought on profound and previously unthinkable social change. We live longer and face new social, economic, and health challenges brought on by an aging population. Political, ethical, and environmental challenges are marked by ever-increasing uncertainty and, paradoxically, the easy availability of more and more data about us.\n\nThese challenges know no boundaries – they stop at no border and they aren’t limited to one discipline.\n\nThat’s why social scientists at UCI are facing them head on, together.\n\nOur students, who comprise nearly 20 percent of the entire UCI student body, can be found in our groundbreaking behavioral economics labs, testing new methods to reduce traffic congestion, create better online marketplaces, and prevent the spread of disease. They are in our brain, behavior, and cognitive robotics labs – mapping the structure of the human brain to understand how speech works in order to help restore it in victims of stroke, and building interactive robots aimed at improving social engagement in children with ADHD and autism. Our students are doing fieldwork in India, Africa, China – indeed, everywhere on the planet, exploring fundamental issues of peace, politics, population, migration, and cross-cultural communication.\n\nOur faculty are breaking with convention to forge connections with computer science, engineering, the arts and the humanities. Interdisciplinary work with law, medicine, and environmental science helps our researchers educate policy makers on the social, cultural, and psychological factors impacting regulation and policy adoption, health and human behavior.\n\nOur maverick spirit and openness to new approaches and unexpected collaborations has kept us nimble and at the cutting-edge in a number of fields as different as transportation economics, cultural anthropology, the philosophy of physics and biology, and the sociology of mass movements.\n\nOur world-class professors in our nine top-ranking departments are experts in their fields, consistently sought by national media to provide perspective on innovative discoveries and pressing social problems. Our faculty are teaching courses within the most popular majors on campus and leading more students to successful graduation than any other academic unit at UCI.\n\nOur alumni – numbering more than 60,000 strong – are taking their world-class education from our Irvine classrooms to the halls of justice in D.C. and international relations work in capitals around the world, to entrepreneurial endeavors from Northgate to Northern Africa, to courtrooms across the nation, boardrooms in some of the world’s top companies, and classrooms around the globe where they’re training our next generation of leaders.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started.\n\nLearn more within these pages about our degree programs, research centers, student programs, and opportunities. Involvement in any one of our endeavors helps us in our continuing effort to push the limits in traditional social sciences work because we believe that solutions to some of society’s greatest challenges lie in our ability to break the mold, to be boundaryless.\n\nJoin us in our pursuit. –Dean Maurer\n\nSpecial Facilities\n\nThe school maintains several special facilities for research and education.\n\nThe Social Sciences Research Laboratory, used for both faculty and student research, occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sciences Laboratory Building. The facility contains 40 experiment and control rooms and several specialized facilities including a virtual reality facility and cognition laboratory.\n\nThree Computer Laboratories provide access to networked systems, where students can work on assignments using full-featured word-processing, database, graphics, and statistical packages. In addition, these computers provide students with access to e-mail and Internet services. The Social Science Plaza facility contains state-of-the-art, high-tech lecture halls and is fully Internet accessible.\n\nThe Social Sciences Academic Resource Center (SSARC) was created over a decade ago to help School of Social Sciences students obtain the appropriate information to select a career and/or graduate school program, generate professional contacts, and learn how to gain a competitive edge during their undergraduate years. Centered around the five educational pillars (academics, research, practical experience, leadership, and community service), the SSARC offers valuable services, programming, and resources ranging from resume consultation, internship opportunities, and graduate school guidance, to research and leadership training. Through one-on-one consultations and various co-curricular programs, staff assist students with developing an educational blueprint that will ensure a quality educational experience while developing a strong educational portfolio and transforming each student into successful leaders within their chosen careers. Visit the Social Sciences Academic Resource Center website for more information.\n\nSocial Sciences Undergraduate Student Affairs (SSUSA) provides general and detailed information about UCI, the School of Social Sciences, and specific requirements exclusive to the majors and minors in the school to students, faculty, administrators, and the general public. SSUSA is fully staffed with academic advisors who speak one-on-one with students regarding their UCI academic career as well as opportunities beyond the classroom. There are also eight peer academic advisors available to undergraduates for walk-in advising regarding requirements and classes. Visit the Social Sciences Undergraduate Student Affairs website for more information.\n\nThe Experimental Social Science Laboratory, launched in fall 2011, is dedicated to experimental studies on individual and interactive decision making in the social sciences. The facility is available to researchers in all social science disciplines and can accommodate up to 40 research subjects at a time for computer-based studies of human behavior. Researchers interested in using the facility, and students interested in participating in paid studies, should visit Experimental Social Science Laboratory website or email essl@ss.uci.edu.\n\nThe School of Social Sciences Anechoic Research Facility opened in fall 2011 as a shared school resource for use by all faculty who have an interest in auditory research. The facility includes a large (12.5’ x 12.5’ x 7’ interior) acoustically isolated RF-shielded chamber for free-field research and a second smaller RF-shielded steel booth for research using headphones. The facility has access to state-of-the-art equipment including a harmonizer, function generators, oscilloscopes, mixers/equalizers, amplifiers, ABR setup (auditory brainstem recording), and research-quality vocal microphones and headphones. To learn more about the facility, or to request time for use, visit the School of Social Sciences Anechoic Research Facility website.\n\nPart of the campuswide strategic initiative to assume leadership in brain imaging and analysis, the Facility for Imaging & Brain Research (FIBRE) joins the Neuroscience Imaging Center and Preclinical and Translational Imaging Facility under the auspices of the Campus Center for Neuroimaging to make UCI the place where tomorrow’s technologies for studying the human brain take flight. Housed in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Gateway, FIBRE is the newest imaging facility on campus and provides researchers access to the latest technology in structural MRI, fMRI, MRS and diffusion imaging. The facility is a collaborative endeavor of the School of Biological Sciences, School of Social Sciences, School of Medicine, School of Education, School of Engineering, School of Social Ecology, Health Affairs, and Office of Research.\n\nCenters for Research\n\nThe UC Irvine branch of the California Census Research Data Center is a partnership between the School of Social Sciences and the U.S. Census Bureau. The on-campus site allows UCI researchers access to confidential Census data that is central to high quality research in economics, sociology, health services, public health, transportation, law, and business. With these data, researchers can link information about the policy environment at a detailed geographic level with micro level data on public health, transportation, labor, crime, education and other highly relevant public policy-oriented outcomes. The result? Studies that address pressing policy needs – like how crime impacts local businesses, or how educational attainment effects labor earnings at local and national levels. Data accessible through the center includes U.S. Census records as well as datasets from the National Center for Health Statistics and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and others. Learn more at Census Research Data Center website.\n\nThe Center for Administrative Data Analysis (CADA) partners with organizations to help better utilize data to answer core questions and advance scientific understanding. The center believes that substantial progress on important issues can be made by making better-informed decisions. Center data infrastructure and faculty expertise enable analyses that address questions that are vital to society. Research affiliates believe that important societal questions deserve answers, and they seek to help schools, clinics, and others serving the public good get the evidence they need to do so more effectively. Learn more at the CADA website.\n\nThe Center for the Advancement of Logic, its Philosophy, History and Applications (C-ALPHA) provides a formal structure that strengthens extant cross‐disciplinary connections while fostering new ones. Modern logic is the science of valid inference. Not being restricted to any particular subject matter, it applies to all human endeavors that aspire to an understanding of rationality, the discovery of proofs, the assessment of evidence, or the establishing of truths - including the physical sciences, the formal sciences like mathematics and legal theory, as well as the social sciences, whether they follow quantitative or qualitative research paradigms. Learn more at the Center for the Advancement of Logic, its Philosophy, History and Applications website.\n\nThe Center for Citizen Peacebuilding at UCI is a distinctive international clearinghouse for research, education, and action on public peace processes. The program focuses on how citizens participate in these activities to prevent violent conflict and, if violence occurs, to promote reconciliation, and sustainable peace. The purpose is to significantly contribute to the theory and practice of conflict resolution. Learn more at the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding website.\n\nThe Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and Engineering (CENCE) is a multidisciplinary research center aimed at understanding the relation between cognitive abilities and neural systems through brain imaging, brain mapping, computational modeling, informatics, and engineering techniques. The center’s research focus in cognitive neuroscience and engineering spans a wide range of methods involving human and animal work, and engineering techniques, such as BCI, BMI, biorobotics, computational neuroscience, neuroinformatics, neuromorphic engineering, neurorobotics, signal processing, image analysis, and mathematical models of brain data. Learn more at Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and Engineering website.\n\nThe Center for Decision Analysis, located in the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences (IMBS) in the School of Social Sciences, is a specialized research center where the objective is to facilitate interaction and common research goals among scientists whose purpose is to formulate precisely and test theories of human behavior. This is to be interpreted in a wide sense as manifested by the membership which spans the following areas: anthropology, cognitive science, economics, engineering, logic and philosophy of science, mathematics, political science, and sociology. Additional faculty come from management science and psychobiology. To describe the focus, consider the fruitful symbiotic relationship that has existed for millennia between mathematics and the physical sciences. A goal of IMBS is to generate a similar relationship between mathematics and the behavioral and social sciences. With high-power social scientists (several are members of the National Academy) providing insights about the field and working with the mathematicians who are involved, new mathematical approaches to analyze these issues are being developed and new kinds of mathematical questions are being raised. For more information, visit the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences website.\n\nEstablished in 2006, the Center for Ethnography works to develop a series of sustained theoretical and methodological conversations about ethnographic research practices across the disciplines. It supports innovative collaborative ethnographic research as well as research on the theoretical and methodological refunctioning of ethnography for contemporary cultural, social, and technological transformations. Learn more at the Center for Ethnography website.\n\nThe Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies (CGPACS) is a multidisciplinary research unit housed in the School of Social Sciences. The mission of CGPACS is to promote research on international problems and processes. Current research emphases include weapons of mass destruction, especially biological weapons; international governance, focusing on the evolution of international norms and institutions; citizen peace building; international environmental cooperation; and religion in international affairs. CGPACS also sponsors research conferences and public colloquia on topics of current significance. The Center’s Margolis Lecture brings to UCI high-profile speakers who have played active roles in international affairs. Recent Margolis Lectures have featured Justice Louise Arbour, former chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunals; Chinese democracy activist Wei Jinsheng; Congressman Christopher Cox; former Secretary of State Warren Christopher; and former Secretary of Defense William Perry. Visit the Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies website for more information.\n\nGaps in the economic and educational opportunities of children and adults in the top and bottom quintiles of the family income distribution have widened dramatically in past decades in both the U.S. and many other countries. Inequality across countries is a major driver of global issues such as migration, while poverty persists both within and across countries. The Center for Population, Inequality, and Policy at UCI is focused on advancing research on socioeconomic factors that directly impact inequality. Faculty in the center investigate the causes and consequences of this inequality as well as policies and other strategies designed to improve well-being of the less advantaged – including employment, education, health, housing, and income. UCI researchers across the social sciences, public health, education, social ecology, and natural sciences have a track record of high-quality population research on inequality – research that spans disciplinary boundaries and important areas of public policy. Learn more at the Center for Population, Inequality, and Policy website.\n\nThe Jack W. Peltason Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD) continues the work of the UCI Focused Research Program on Democratization that was founded in 1991 and sponsors research and training on the process of democratic transition and the expansion of the democratic process in already established democracies. CSD includes a multidisciplinary faculty from four UC campuses. CSD’s activities are focused on three areas. First, faculty administer a graduate training program on empirical democratic theory. The National Science Foundation selected UCI in 1995 as a national center for the training of doctoral students in democratization issues; the five-year NSF grant provides funding for graduate fellowships and other training activities. Second, the democracy research program aims at improving the democratic process in the United States and other established democracies as we enter the next century. The program focuses on reforms to increase the ability of citizens to express their preferences and have these preferences represented within the democratic process. Third, CSD supports research on the development of sustainable democracies in Eastern Europe, East Asia, and other new democracies. The New Democracies Initiative contributes to the promotion of democracy in these formerly authoritarian systems. For more information visit the Center for the Study of Democracy website.\n\nThe Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion (IMTFI) was formed in 2008. Its mission is to support research on money and technology among the world’s poorest people: those who live on less than $1 per day. IMTFI seeks to create a community of practice and inquiry into the everyday uses and meanings of money, as well as the technological infrastructures being developed as carriers of mainstream and alternative currencies worldwide. Learn more at the Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion website.\n\nThe Long U.S.-China Institute is dedicated to studying contemporary Chinese society, politics, and culture in all of its complexity. The institute fosters bilateral engagement between China and the U.S. and supports scholarship and events that facilitate mutual understanding and that highlight a diversity of voices and disciplinary approaches. Core faculty come from the Social Sciences, Humanities, Law, Business, and Social Ecology and are engaged in cutting edge research on contemporary China. The Long U.S.–China Institute focuses on six key areas: social movements and social justice; domestic and comparative politics, business, and law; health, science, and technology; gender, race, and ethnicity; China in the world and the Chinese diaspora; and China as method: researching and writing about China today. In addition, the institute seeks to bridge the divide between academia, journalism, the public sector, and general interest. For more information, visit the Long U.S.-China Institute.\n\nThe UCI Interdisciplinary Center for the Scientific Study of Ethics and Morality was established in 2003 by a group of scholars interested in recent scientific research that yields insight on the origins and causes of morality. In creating the center, UCI faculty both address a topic that is becoming one of the new frontiers in science and reflect critically on the moral implications of this new frontier. The center focuses on the etiology of ethical behavior and differs in several important ways from existing centers dedicated to the discussion of ethics. Traditional academic approaches tend to originate in philosophical, foundational, or religious discussions of ethics. They tend to be humanistic in orientation and emphasize abstract, theoretical considerations of what constitutes ethics and morality. The center complements this traditional approach and explores the scientific and/or the empirically verifiable factors that influence morality, using a variety of methodologies that examine factors contributing to and driving moral action in a variety of social, psychological, and biological contexts. The center encourages ties between scholars interested in ethics in humanities and the sciences—including social science, social ecology, biological sciences, and medicine—building on the interdisciplinary tradition at UCI, complementing, rather than duplicating, existing efforts. Visit UCI Interdisciplinary Center for the Scientific Study of Ethics and Morality website for more information.\n\nHonors\n\nGraduation with Honors. No more than 16 percent of the graduating seniors, who have completed at least 72 units in the University of California will receive honors: approximately 2 percent summa cum laude, 4 percent magna cum laude, and 10 percent cum laude. The student’s cumulative record at the end of the final quarter is the basis for consideration for awarding Latin Honors. To be eligible for consideration for honors at graduation, the student must, before the end of winter quarter of the senior year, have submitted an Application for Graduation; be officially declared as a major within the School of Social Sciences; have all corrections to the academic record processed by the Registrar’s Office; if completing the Language Other Than English general education requirement with a language exemption test, pass the test by the end of winter quarter; and be able to verify completion of all course work by the end of the spring quarter of the senior year.

It collectively acts as an official student in discussing program development with administrators and department chairs and other faculty.\n\nIn response to the race-based violence of the 2017 Charlottesville protest, the Samueli Foundation and UCI sought to build a program for high school students that would unearth and jettison the deeply held, and often unconscious, beliefs created by racism - primarily a belief in the hierarchy of human value. Launched in 2018, the Diversity, Inclusion and Racial Healing Ambassador (DIRHA) program sends UCI student leaders to participating local high schools for weekly discussions on such tough topics as race, gender and religion. Four times a year, the teens come to campus for faculty- and staff-led seminars in which they learn how to make the material digestible, thought-provoking and age-appropriate for diversity-focused projects they implement within their schools.\n\nThe Deconstructing Diversity Initiative (DDI) was founded in 2015 with seed money from the UC Irvine Chancellor’s Advisory Council on Campus Climate, Culture & Inclusion to address concerns about the campus racial climate. A cohort of UCI students are chosen each year to take part in an intensive DDI seminar series and then travel to sites of historical and contemporary importance to the experience of race in America. By pairing classroom learning with travel experience across the States, DDI provides college students as well as community and campus participants the education, training and experiences that enable them to better understand, negotiate and resolve racial and ethnic tension.\n\nUndergraduate Programs\n\nPlanning a Program of Study\n\nSince there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major requirements, students should consult with the School of Social Sciences Undergraduate Student Affairs to design an appropriate program of study.\n\nStudents who select one of the School majors in their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics sequences listed under Part A of the School requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they include fundamental concepts that will be widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the general education requirement (category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sophomore year, the student might complete the course on computing, three courses toward the general education requirement, four courses in the social sciences, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathematics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation.\n\nChange of Major. Students who wish to change their major to one offered by the school should contact the Social Sciences Undergraduate Student Affairs Office for information about change-of-major requirements, procedures, and policies. Information is also available at the UCI Change of Major Criteria website.\n\nDouble Majors within Social Sciences\n\nIn fulfilling degree requirements for multiple majors, a maximum of two lower-division courses may overlap between any two majors.\n\nOther Double Majors\n\nIn fulfilling degree requirements for multiple majors, a maximum of two courses may overlap between any two majors. For students pursuing a major in Psychology and Social Behavior, a total of three courses (PSYCH 9A- PSYCH 9B-PSYCH 9C, same as PSCI 11A-PSCI 11B-PSCI 11C) may be overlapped.\n\nMathematics and Social Sciences\n\nThe mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modern social science. The concepts and terms of mathematics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist’s vocabulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an understanding of current literature in the social sciences, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of social science models. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and computing. In addition, for students who are preparing for graduate school in an area of social science, it will be important to supplement the minimal mathematics requirements with additional courses related to mathematics and social science methodology. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, however, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Students who are preparing for graduate study should consult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills necessary for successful graduate work.\n\nTransfer Study Recommendations\n\nThe School recommends that students wishing to transfer to UCI do the following:\n\nComplete the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) prior to transfer to UCI.\n\nRefer to the ASSIST website for information about community college courses that will fulfill UCI lower-division major requirements.\n\nSpecific course recommendations:\n\nProspective Quantitative Economics majors: complete the equivalent of UCI's MATH 2D at a community college (in addition to the courses required for transfer student admission; see the Department of Economics section).\n\nProspective International Studies majors: complete two semesters of foreign language at the intermediate level.\n\nProspective Psychology majors: complete a three-course sequence in introductory, physiological, and either social or abnormal psychology.\n\nTransfer Students\n\nFreshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sophomores will fulfill the regular requirements of the four-year program either through work at UCI or through transfer credit for comparable work elsewhere.\n\nJuniors: Following review by the School of Social Sciences, it may be determined that junior transfer students electing to major in one of the School’s degree programs, who have good records at other accredited colleges and universities, have satisfied School requirement 2 and the University requirements. However, all transfer students must fulfill the upper-division writing general education requirement (category I) while at UCI. Students anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year should plan their curriculum so as to anticipate the special mathematics requirement (School requirement 1). Every effort will be made to accommodate individual variation in background, provided students are prepared to commit themselves to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two-year program for junior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four-year program, except that students who have not satisfied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation.\n\nSeniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult.\n\nService Learning, Community Service, and Internships\n\nService learning is a meaningful educational activity that integrates community service within the curriculum. It is an opportunity for students to make positive contributions to underserved and marginalized communities through academic courses, field studies, and internships.\n\nService learning provides out-of-class experiences to reinforce understanding of academic theory while addressing serious community concerns. When combined with a structured curriculum that includes research components, students can explore the role of the social scientist while seeking solutions to problems affecting society.
