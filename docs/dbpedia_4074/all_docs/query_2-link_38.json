        "text": "Lee-Jackson Day is a celebration of the lives of two great heroes and most noteworthy citizens of Lexington, Virginia. Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. 'Stonewall' Jackson were both born near this date which became a longstanding state holiday across the South. While neither man was born here, both spent the final years of their lives as residents of Lexington. Stonewall Jackson arrived here prior to the War Between the States and became an integral part of the community as a church leader and professor at the Virginia Military Institute. Robert E. Lee arrived in Lexington following the war and rescued a destitute college that was later renamed Washington and Lee in his honor. Both men are buried here which makes the town a fitting venue to commemorate their lives. We welcome you to join us as we honor not only their military genius, but their personal lives, faith, and character. We also encourage you to walk the streets and explore the town upon which both men left their permanent mark and legacy.\n\nThe holiday was originally created in 1889 to celebrate the birthday of General Robert E. Lee who was born on January 19, 1807. The holiday was put into effect by Governor Fitzhugh Lee who was a nephew of the general and had been a Confederate general himself. In 1904 the holiday was changed to include a tribute to Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson who was born on January 21, 1824. The change was made under the administration of Governor Andrew Jackson Montague.\n\nThe Stonewall Brigade - Camp #1296 Lexington, Virginia will present Lee-Jackson Day 2025 on January 17-18. This will be the 26th year of this annual event in Lexington.\n\nThe event includes a private tours of the Stonewall Jackson House and Stonewall Jackson Cemetery and our annual Symposium on Friday at the Virginia Horse Center. On Saturday, we start with a service at Stonewall Jackson's graveside. We then have a parade leaving Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery, through downtown Lexington. At the conclusion of the parade, we have a service for Lee and key note speaker, & luncheon at the Virginia Horse Center. This year we our evening Gala will return featuring music and dancing. Thank you for a great 2024 event and we will see you in 2025!"
