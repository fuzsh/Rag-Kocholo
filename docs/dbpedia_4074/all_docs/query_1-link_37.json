        "text": "Archived Queries\n\nJune 30, 2010\n\nTEXAN KID SHOW\n\nI was wondering if anyone knows anything about a Texan Kid Show that possibly performed in the Grandview area. My great grandmother was originally from Grandview and I have possession of her photos. There are about 3 or 4 photos of this so called Texan Kid Show. The photos contain men dressed as cowboys. The names are written on the back, but it is difficult to know for sure the right spelling. In one picture, the cowboys are standing with my great great grandmother Ida Laird McDaniel. Any help would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\nCasey Cluiss Flinn\n\ncjfrdh@aol.com\n\nJune 30, 2010\n\nLAIRD - McDANIEL - NORTON\n\nLooking for any information on the Laird and McDaniel families of Grandview, Texas.

Her name was Jewell Carver. Her parents were George W & Bettie Carver. The reason I am trying to locate a birth record for her is to try and figure out what George was doing there in 1905. I thought it might list his occupation. I think he had something to do with the railroad because he was a Texas Ranger in 1922 listed as a Railroad Ranger and may have worked the strike in Cleburne in 1922. After Jewell’s birth in 1905 the family moved back to Bell county where he was a farmer until 1922.\n\nAny help would be appreciated,\n\nRonnie Tubbs\n\nronnie5115@gmail.com\n\nFebruary 24, 2010\n\nKIMBROW\n\nDoes anyone have information on Willie D.

Researchers don't have it because the Mo records were destroyed 1870, but surely his father put it on his death record if Texas had records that far back.

Ladona was the daughter of Ferdinand Jackson Brown and Minerva Elizabeth Clements. She first married Thadeus Constantine Penry and they had three children. I believe she and Joe Collins also had three more children. Information found at FamilySearch.org gives brief information on her Parents, Date of Birth, Marriage and Date of Death and Place - some of which is not correct and gives no sources for the information.\n\nThis is the only lead I have on where she might be buried. No Death Certificate or grave is known. Would appreciate any further information on Ladona and her marriage to Joseph. This new information about a second marriage seems to conflict with stories passed down through my family as to the timing of her death and the cause.\n\nI Would love to hear any comments from anyone about Ladona any of these other people mentioned.\n\nThanks!\n\nTimTempleton@Juno.com\n\nJanuary 2, 2009\n\nGRIFFIN/NUNNELEE\n\nMrs Hadie [GRIFFIN] Nunnelee\n\nSeeking parents and siblings of Mrs Hadie [GRIFFIN] Nunnelee who was the 1st wife of my Great-Grandpa, Eugine Lavarsha Nunnelee. Hadie is buried in the Old Alvarado (Balch) Cemetery in Alavarado, Johnson County, Texas. Her gravestone reads: \"NUNNELEE, Hadie N. wife of E. L. Nunnelee 21 March 1856 - 08 November 1884 aged 28 yr 7 mo 17 dy \" There are probably kinfolk in this cemetery but I don't know who to look for..... Hadie [GRIFFIN] Nunnelee's father was W. T. GRIFFIN and he died in Johnson Co, Tx abt/before 1893 leaving land to his 3 grandchildren by his deceased daughter Hadie. I have searched for years but never found any information about Hadie's parents or her siblings - not even a census record. She and my G-Grandpa married abt 1873 and they had 3 children: Walter Eugene, Hadie Alice, and Robert Griffin. In 1893 my G-grandpa Nunnelee filed guardianship papers on behalf of his 3 minor children in Freestone County, Texas regarding some property inherited from his children's \"grandfather, W.T. GRIFFIN of Johnson County, Texas.\" That's all I have to work with.\n\nFrom the last 7 generations, the only living direct line male descendants bearing our surname Nunnelee are descendants of G-grandpa and Hadie's son, Robert Griffin Nunnelee.\n\nI just can't stand it that Hadie is no more than a name and dates in our family's history !!! I will be forever indebted for any information you might share with me.\n\nKathye [Payne] Upham Houston, Texas\n\nn540kin@comcast.net - kupham@yahoo.com\n\nJanuary 2, 2009\n\nMcNUTT/DAZVIS\n\nLooking for L.J.

Truro was the daughter of D. J. THORNTON and Izora Brown. D. J. THORNTON also had a son, Leonard THORNTON.\n\nD. J. THORNTON was apparently my g-grandmother's brother or at least a half-brother. They had the same father, Silas R. THORNTON, b. 1828, and probably the same mother, Rhoda SMITH, 1832-1901. I would like to correspond with anyone who could tell me more about this family, for example, when and where did Silas R. THORNTON and Rhoda Smith marry? Who were Rhoda's parents? Did Silas and Rhoda have other children? Rhoda died in 1901 and is buried in Caddo Cemetery with son, D. J. THORNTON (1861-1934), Izora (1865-1942, and their family. Where did her husband, Silas THORNTON, die and where was he buried? D. J. was born in Hood County in 1861 according to his obituary and had lived about 50 years in Johnson County when he died in 1934. Yet, before his marriage, I cannot locate him or his parents in any census. Knowing that Rhoda died in 1901 and was buried in Johnson County, I still can't find her in the 1900 census.... Was she a widow of Silas who had remarried by 1900?\n\nSilas R. THORNTON had two sisters who lived in Johnson County. Calpernie THORNTON GANT (1829-1885)and husband, James GANT, are buried in Caddo Cemetery. (GANT daughters married S. P. Henderson and William Daniel Doggett.) Silas THORNTON's other sister was Lodaska THORNTON KEMP (1833-1911), wife of Silas M. KEMP. Lodaska and her family are buried on the old KEMP homeplace in Johnson County, except for 2 stepsons, William KEMP, who is buried in Caddo Cemetery and Gilbert KEMP, buried in Jack County, TX.\n\nI would appreciate any information on any of these families. I'd like to correspond with descendants of HUGHES, THORNTON, GANT, DOGGETT, or KEMP.\n\nThank you,\n\nLoretta Insco\n\nlinsco@frontiernet.net\n\nJuly 11, 2006\n\n1870 Johnson County Census Look-Up\n\nI'm looking for a family that migrated to Johnson County around 1870.

Would appreciate any clues to his real name and family members would be a great plus.\n\nDana Montague Alexander\n\nMay 18, 2003\n\nJohn (Jack) Shea\n\nFrom: stardust725@cox.net\n\nI am searching for any type of death record for my great grandfather, John (Jack) Shea, a railroad worker who reportedly (family story) died in June 1891 in or near Cleburne while working on the railroad. Story says he drowned while bathing/swimming in a water tank and was buried somewhere near the railroad tracks there. Search of the main Cleburne Cemetery revealed no record tho the caretaker said there are numerous unmarked graves in an old section near the tracks. My guess is that it would have been a pauper's burial, or possibly railroad managed, since he had no local family in the Cleburne area. He was divorced from my ggrandmother who was living in Austin County at that time. It occurred to me that since it would be considered an accidental death, there might be a coroner's report if such records were required as early as 1891. Does the Johnson Co. Genealogical Society have such information, and would there be anyone there willing to search such a record as well as local newspaper microfilm to see if it might have been reported in the paper? I would be willing to pay a flat fee of 50.00 for both searches.\n\nBarbara Cogburn-San Diego, CA.

All the children listed with them in Pct. 5 are Amanda's by two former marriages, to Tennyson/Tennison in MS and John G. Stewart of Burnet Co., TX. She did have one son Addison Tidwell by William born in 1881. Amanda's maiden name is Martin. The last child listed in the census is actually Robert Lee Stewart, not Tennyson as given on the 1880 census from Familysearch.org. Is anyone familiar with any members of this family? Amanda died in Erath Co., TX in 1909 but William Tidwell and Robert L. Stewart remain mysteries. Rose Parks RParks102@msn.com\n\nMarch 11, 2003\n\nElizabeth Johnson and William S. McAfee\n\nFrom: E.Reno@mail.tisd.net\n\nSearching for relatives and/or more information on Elizabeth Johnson b. ca. 1852 Lawrence County, Alabama and her husband William S. McAfee b. ca. 1850 Mississippi. They were married in Johnson County January 27, 1878. They had one son that I am aware of Lawrence b. ca. 1879/1880. I understand that more of Elizabeth's family members came to Ellis and Johnson Counties. Her parents were Thomas Johnson b. ca. 1822 Lawrence County Alabama (s/o Isaac Johnson and Eleanor Mullins) and Martha Sheffield b. ca. 1825 Alabama. Thomas and Martha are listed in 1850 & 1860 census in Lawrence county, but only their children were listed living with Patsy Johnson in 1870. Three of the sibs are listed in the 1880 Coryell County Census. Hope things rings a bell with someone!

My gr-gr grandfather William Washington FRANKS was married to Mary Virginia (Jennie) PUGH in Johnson County in 1872. I have little to no information on Jennie PUGH. I have been told by my great aunt that her mother was Paralee (sp?) Mills Oxford PUGH. No proof of that yet though. William Washington FRANKS was born in Laurens County South Carolina. Have no information on his parents at all. His date of birth was 1850 if you can put any faith in an 1880 census :-)... William and Jennie had 10 children that I know of ......... Summerfield, Lee Roy, Ida , Vera, Lula, My gr-grandfather Albert Milton, Lester, Effie, Myrtle, and Claude. Any help with this line or any connected would be greatly appreciated.
