        "text": "In Montagu’s absence, ships and docks had dilapidated in his absence— an untimely predicament since the British needed to attend to the Revolutionary War. Montagu reignited his efforts to improve the conditions during his second tenure in his 1771 tenure, in which he ensured that the dockyards were looked after and worked together with the Navy Board and the Admiralty in regard to “daily administration” and ensure smoother bureaucratic processes. In December 1773, Montagu happened to be in Boston, Massachusetts during the Boston Tea Party but made no effort to stop the destruction; he watched the proceedings from a window in a house overlooking Griffin's Wharf, and the called to the returning Sons of Liberty that they would have to \"pay the fiddler yet\" for their actions. Throughout 1775 and 1776, Montagu wanted to enhance the navy by increasing its size, but Lord North continued to roll back the British navy because he believed that it was unnecessary to dominate the colonial uprising. After French formally joined the Revolutionary War in 1778, Montagu was able to secure “the permission he had sought in 1776 to fully mobilize the navy.” Montagu worked efficiently and effectively, but this was relatively unsuccessful and this he was criticized for “negligence and corruption.” Montagu advocated for his difficult position in 1779, stating that by the time he was finally able to augment the navy again, it was “in a most deplorable state, the ships decaying and unfit for service, the storehouses empty, and a general despondency running through the whole naval department.” Because of the workforce weakness and inability to repair ships, Montagu was heavily criticized.\n\nMontagu’s beliefs about the British navy did not coincide with other British governmental figures. Montagu believed in the power of maritime affairs and colonialism as assets to British power. Montagu also followed the proven framework of centralizing the navy in Europe and not in the colonies; with this belief, Montagu’s position conflict with that of King George III, who argued for “sending out larger fleets to the Americas and leaving a smaller force in the Channel.” Montagu was more concerned with Spain and France than he was with the American Revolution."
