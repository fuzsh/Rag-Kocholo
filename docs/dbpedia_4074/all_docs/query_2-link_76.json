That order’s copy of the Constitution and By-laws may be lost to history, but the Queen of Sheba Council’s 1921 version is fortunately accessible. This document highlights the significance of mutual aid within the framework of the function of the Order of St Luke.\n\nIndependent Order of St. Luke. Queen of Sheba Council No. , Randall K.

[White Plains, N.Y.]: [The Council], 1921.\n\nMadame Maggie J. Walker’s Vision for the Independent Order of St Luke Reflected in the Constitution and By-laws\n\nDuring the Jim Crow era, white-owned firms refused to grant disability and life insurance to the black community. In response, IOSL provided weekly sickness and disability benefits as well as funeral assistance for its members starting in 1895. Similar to contemporary insurance companies, it offered various premium options. Mrs. Walker’s effective leadership in membership drives bolstered the organization’s finances, enabling prompt payment of death claims and reduced premium costs.\n\nSick Benefit\n\nMembers who wished to receive financial support in the event of being sick or disabled, paid monthly dues into the Sick Benefit fund. The Sick Committee manages the implementation of this benefit. The member could receive no more than $35/year. That equates to about $t00 in current value.\n\nDeath Taxes and Benefit\n\nResources:\n\nDegree Ritual of the Independent Order of St Luke\n\nFinding Aid – Right Worthy Grand Council, Independent Order\n\nof St. Luke Records, CATALOG NO.

Charles died 1853 and his will was proved in Montgomery County, by Rice D. Montague, Clerk.\n\nQuote: “I give her [my beloved wife Rhoda Black] my negro woman Eliza to dispose of all as suits her, and my two boys Daniel and Andrew I desire that she will dispose of Daniel and Andrew to my sons John & Edward, on condition that they pay to Kezia Francisco $750.00. dollars and to Ann T. Black $550.00 dollars.”\n\nRhoda McDonald Black (1805-1859), wife and mother of Keziah Black Francisco (1830-1903), Ann Taylor “Nannie” Black (1837-1903), John Black A. (1831-1899), and Edward Black (1835-1912).\n\nMuch of Charles and Rhoda Black’s land becomes part of Virginia Tech campus after the death of Charles and Rhoda.\n\nGeorge Mills, Servant\n\nGeorge Mills is noted as “After the war an old servant George Mills by name….” in Nannie Francisco Porter’s , daughter of Keziah Black Francisco.\n\nThe 1850 Slave Schedule for Montgomery County does not name the people held against their will and provide a documentation of the slave owners. Charles Black’s will notes three people, a woman and two men, not four as noted below. No proof yet, but perhaps Eliza is the one listed female. Daniel and Andrew are likely one of these three people.\n\nAlexander Black is the brother of Charles Black.\n\nIn 1853, one of Charles Black’s enslaved men reportedly died from apoplexy. This explains why his will only mentioned two men and one woman.\n\nAndrew Jackson Long – Millstone Cutter – Brush Mountain\n\nAndrew Jackson “Jack” Long was born in 1870 in Montgomery County as noted in the 1880 & 1900 US Census, and Jackson’s marriage record in 1892.

These documents list Jackson as either “mulatto, black or colored” and Sara/Sarah as “white.” No father was listed.\n\nIn the marriage record Jackson’s mother is noted as Sara Long and in the 1880 US Census as Sarah.

Bill Groseclose. Polly Jackson is noted as Mary’s mother.\n\nEight years later the family of 6 appears in the 1900 US Census. Jackson is 26 and a laborer in the stone quarry; Mary, his wife, is 26 and had given birth to 4 children, all still alive: Theodosia,- daughter, born December 1893, 6 yr; Thomas – son, born September 1895, 4 yr; Donald- son, born May 1896, 4 yr; Hary C – son, June 1897, 3 ys\n\n1930 US Census finds the family in Montgomery County, and appears to be living in the same neighborhood. Jackson and Mary own their home, worth $600. He is working in Mill Rock Quarry as a Stone Cutter. The couple are now living with 7 children.\n\nDonald and Thomas are working in the millstone quarry. Thomas is 34 In. 1906) and Donald is 31 yrs old (b. 1909).
