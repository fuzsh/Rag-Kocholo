They will be live-streamed at https://www.volstate.edu/live\n\nAfter the forums, Tennessee Board of Regents Chancellor Flora W. Tydings will review input submitted from the campus community and public and conduct more interviews to select one candidate for nomination to the Board of Regents. Comments on the candidates may be submitted through an online survey link that will be posted on the search webpage above.\n\nThe Board of Regents will consider the chancellor’s recommendation for the presidential appointment in a special called meeting at 11 a.m. CT May 6. More meeting details will be announced when complete. The meeting, which will occur virtually, will be livestreamed and archived on the TBR website at https://www.tbr.edu/board/may-6-2024-special-called-board-meeting, where board materials will also be posted when complete.\n\nThe next president will succeed Dr. Orinthia T.

The president is the college’s chief executive officer.\n\nThe Board of Regents approved criteria for the next president during a special called meeting Oct. 20. A search advisory committee was appointed in January, composed of four Board members, representatives of the College’s students, faculty, staff and alumni, and civic and business leaders from the community. An initial public forum on the search process was held Jan. 26. After the position was posted, the committee reviewed applications and interviewed selected candidates before recommending the finalists."
