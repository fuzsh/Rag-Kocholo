In Aug. 1860 he was 27 (b. 1832-1833). In June 1880 he was 46 (b. 1833-1834). And in June 1900 he said he was born Dec. 1836. His father probably knew best when he said his son James was 18 in 1850 and James surely knew he was born in December. Some date in Dec. 1832 seems to fit best with all this info. I had a date of Dec. 3 from some source. I'll go with Dec. 3, 1832. (2) Date on tombstone may be Dec. 28, 18??. (3) His place of birth was Illinois in 1850 and Missouri from then on in the other censuses. His father probably knew where his son was born as was stated in 1850. (4) 1880 Census, Wise Co. (Precinct 3), TX - son John says both parents born MO. (5) Date is from tombstone. Mary Watson info says date is February 15. (6) Mrs. Gwen Kirby, granddaughter of James Bodine - date. (7) . (8) Missouri death certificate, no. 1950-23794 - place. (9) Bodine Registrants for the World War I Draft (Arkansas) - date of birth. (10) California Death Records - date and state. (11) California Death Records - date and place. (12) Social Security Death Index - March 14, 1895. (13) . (14) Obituary found on the Internet. See William's Notes page - date & place. (15) Kerby, Mona Gwendolyn (daughter) - date. Dave's Bodine Genealogy Website Email me with Revisions. Pictures welcome if under 1 MB. Click here to return to the Home Page. Click here to email me.
