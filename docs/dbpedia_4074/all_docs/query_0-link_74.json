        "text": "Final concert in Albion summer series canceled\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 27 August 2024 at 9:48 pm\n\nALBION – The final event in an 11-concert summer series won’t happen on Wednesday because the band Soul Street has Covid. The concert won’t be rescheduled.\n\nThe series began on June 5 with the band, Carlton Station. All of the concerts have been at Bullard, with food vendors and alcoholic beverages available.\n\nJohn Grillo, the village’s recreation director, said the series has been a big success, and he is open to suggestions to make the series better next year. Comments can directed to the Facebook page for the Village of Albion Summer Concert Series.\n\nLast year, some of the concerts were held on a closed-off section of Main Street due to the lift bridge being under construction. Concerts also were held by the canal park near the fire hall last year, as well as some of the events at Bullard Park.\n\nGrillo and the village recreation committee this year decided to have all of the concerts at the Bullard, with the musicians playing from the amphitheater stage.\n\nFunding administered by GO Art! helped pay for the concerts this summer, as well as sponsorship from Bidleman Ford.\n\nReturn to top\n\nSponsored Post Return to top\n\nMedina accepting engineering proposals for one-bay fire hall addition\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 27 August 2024 at 11:04 am\n\nMEDINA – The Village of Medina is accepting proposals from engineering firms to design a one-bay addition to the fire hall.\n\nThose proposals are due by Sept. 12. The village will hire an engineering firm to prepare the bid specifications for the addition, which is needed to accommodate a larger ladder truck due to arrive in December 2025.\n\nVillage officials were looking at a two-bay addition and upgrades to the existing fire hall, but scaled that project back when estimates topped $6 million.\n\nMedina Mayor Marguerite Sherman said an engineering report, detailing the one-bay addition, is needed to help the village pursue grant funding to help pay for the new space. She is hopeful for state and federal assistance with the building addition.\n\nThe board needs to find an affordable solution because the new truck will be delivered in about 16 months.\n\n“We’re going for a bare-bones building for something to put this truck in,” she said during Monday’s board meeting.\n\nThe new ladder truck will have a clearance of 13 feet. The current fire hall only has room for up to 10 feet, 6 inches in height.\n\nThe village will be replacing a ladder truck that is 29 years old with a height of 10 feet, 4 inches. The new bay in the addition is expected to be 14 feet high.\n\nThe village received some good news with the fire truck. Medina was looking at a 6.5 percent financing rate for the $1.7 million truck from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But Village Clerk-Treasurer Jada Burgess said that rate has come down to 4 percent, which would save the village significantly in interest. The final rate won’t be known until it’s time for the village to take out the financing.\n\nReturn to top\n\nSponsored Post Return to top\n\nAlbion students seek headstone for soldier’s unmarked grave at Alms House Cemetery\n\nPosted 27 August 2024 at 10:10 am\n\nPress Release, Albion Central School\n\nALBION – Two students from Albion Middle School used part of their summer vacation to research a former Civil War soldier believed to be buried in Orleans County.\n\nEighth-graders Kendall Peruzzini and Mary McCormick spent time with both Albion Town Clerk Sarah Basinait and County Historian Catherine Cooper, scouring century-old records in hopes of proving the soldier’s burial site – an unmarked grave at the former Alms House Cemetery on West County House Road.\n\nEventually, they and their classmates will apply for a headstone from the National Cemetery Administration and hope to hear back soon. In 2011, Service Learning students joined the county in cleaning up the long-forgotten cemetery out of respect for those buried under the simple, sandstone markers etched only with a number. About 75 stones exist and the vast majority of the approximate 200 burials there have no headstone.\n\nOnce school begins, their fellow social studies classmates will join in the service learning effort.\n\nReturn to top\n\nLyndonville welcomed crowd to Street Dance in downtown\n\nPosted 27 August 2024 at 9:57 am\n\nPress Release, Lyndonville Lions Club\n\nLYNDONVILLE – The Town of Yates, the Village of Lyndonville, and the Lyndonville Lions Club joined forces to host the third annual Summer Street Dance on Friday, August 23. The community responded by showing up in large numbers to celebrate the waning days of the summer and to welcome the coming fall season.\n\nSeveral food trucks and vendors were on hand to mark this event and the Lyndonville Lions held a recruitment drive along with a hot dog and hamburger stand supplying food and beverages to the festival goers. The American Legion gave out flower arrangements with all of the free-will donations going to support local veterans.\n\nThe Town of Yates had many activities planned for children who attended the evening event. Rock painting and chalk street art drawing kept kids busy all evening. Various inflatable bounce houses were available to children of all ages during the event for those who wanted to expend a little more energy.\n\nThe grass roots effort by the Town of Yates is seen as a successful “End-to-Summer Event” over the last few years. Town of Yates board member Sue Hrovat has led this event for the town.\n\n“The Town Board has been happy with the results of the last few years, and would like to offer more fun things for people to do at the street dance,” she said.\n\nLooking ahead, the Town Board is in preliminary discussions with the Lyndonville Lions Club to be co-sponsors and to expand on this event. The Lions have discussed the possible addition of several venues with Hrovat, including adding local winery tasting booths, a summer chicken barbeque sale and expanding the musical performances. There has also been some groundswell support for the possibility of an end-of-summer fireworks display to cap off the evening events.\n\nThe Lyndonville Lions Club sees this as a great collaborative effort to support the community.\n\nThe Town of Yates would like to thank all those who made the street dance possible, and they hope that all have a safe and happy end to the summer season as we all look forward to fall and mother nature’s artistic splendor with her fall foliage.\n\nReturn to top\n\nMedina approves ‘Red Horse’ in disc golf course name\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 27 August 2024 at 8:18 am\n\nMEDINA – The disc golf course in Medina has an official name: Medina Red Horse Disc Golf Course at Gulf Street Park.\n\nThe nine-hole course was developed by the village and Orleans County YMCA last year. The course opened in October and most of the course is in a wooded area at Gulf Street Park.\n\nSome of the more devoted players suggested the name, Red Horse Disc Golf Course. Their design for promoting the site includes a cutout of a red horse, the school district’s Medina Mustang. Gulf Street Park also has red clay in some areas and the course players wanted to highlight that red.\n\nJust last month, 175 rounds by 42 players were registered through a QR code. Other players also are likely using the site without registering, Mayor Marguerite Sherman said.\n\nSome community members wanted Gulf Street Park to be added to the official name, and the Village Board agreed to that suggestion on Monday.\n\nSigns will soon be added at the tee boxes to note the distance to the basket, and the par level.\n\nMedina worked with the Orleans County YMCA to develop the course in a project funded by a grant from the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Foundation. Albion did a similar project at Bullard Park.\n\nThe Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Foundation gave the YMCA $20,000 to $24,000 to develop the projects with tee boxes, signs and baskets that are mounted in small concrete foundations – 8 inches wide by 20 inches deep.\n\nMedina’s DPW used a skid steer with a forestry head to carve a path in the woods, mulching brush and small trees.\n\nVolunteers are expected to install the signs on the course, and add small arrows on some trees to help direct people to the next hole.\n\nReturn to top\n\nMedina moves Village Board meetings to Ridgeway Town Hall\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 27 August 2024 at 7:30 am\n\nPhoto by Tom Rivers\n\nMEDINA – The Medina Village Board meets on Monday in the Ridgeway Town Hall.

Ridgeway is making the town hall available at no charge to the Village Board.\n\nMayor Marguerite Sherman said the town hall has a better sound system for the public to hear the board members and the meeting space doesn’t have to be set up with tables and chairs, and then torn down the following morning.\n\nAt the Senior Center, DPW staff had to set up the tables and chairs before the meeting and then be there the following morning to put things back.\n\nThe senior center is a bigger space, and Sherman said many people who attended the meetings said it was difficult to hear the board members and other speakers.\n\nThe Village Board also recently changed the start times from 7 p.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nReturn to top\n\nFirefighters from 5 companies will do boot drive for Make-A-Wish on Saturday\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 26 August 2024 at 9:35 pm\n\nMEDINA – Firefighters from five companies and departments in western Orleans County will team on Saturday in an annual boot drive to raise money for the Make-a-Wish Foundation.\n\nFrom 9 a.m. to noon firefighters from Shelby, East Shelby, Medina, Ridgeway and Lyndonville will be out collecting money for Make-A-Wish.\n\nThey will be near the intersections at Route 63 and Maple Ridge Road, Route 104 and South Lyndonville Road, and Main Street and Center Street.\n\nThe firefighters have raised about $8,000 in the recent boot drives for Make-A-Wish.\n\nReturn to top\n\n2 from Albion earn degrees from out-of-state colleges\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 26 August 2024 at 8:53 pm\n\nTwo people from Albion have recently earned bachelor’s degrees from colleges out of state.\n\nMalory Adams graduated in May with a bachelor’s degree in English at West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV.\n\nAD Christ on Aug. 15 received his bachelor of arts degree from Berea College in Berea, Kentucky.\n\nReturn to top\n\nCounty mourns death of planning director, who guided growth in community\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 26 August 2024 at 3:04 pm\n\nJim Bensley took on all kinds of tasks for the county, including marina manager and coordinator of household hazardous waste\n\nMEDINA – Many of the local officials in Orleans County, including village and town governments, are mourning the loss of Jim Bensley, who served as the county’s senior planner.\n\nBensley passed away at age 65 on Aug. 14, only a few days after coordinating another household hazardous waste collection day in the county. Bensley was at the Highway Department in Albion on West Academy Street for many hours on Aug. 10, helping people at the check-in while about 500 residents disposed of old car batteries, propane tanks, oils, solvents and other chemicals, as well as more than 1,000 tires.\n\nBensley took on that job, as well as the county marina manager for a few years, in addition to his primary job as the director of the Department of Planning and Development for the county.\n\nIn that role provided guidance for other county employees as well as the towns and villages as they updated zoning, developed comprehensive plans for the future, and reviewed site plans, requests for zoning variances and many other issues.\n\n“This is a tremendous loss for the county,” said Dawn Borchert, the county’s tourism director. “He had such an institutional knowledge of the community. He knew every little town and corner in the county.”\n\nBensley started with the county in 1989 as a planner and was promoted to senior planner in 1996. He has served as the director of Planning & Development since January 2015.\n\nFormer County legislator Ken DeRoller has worked with Bensley since the 1980s, back when DeRoller was chairman of the Town of Kendall Planning Board. Bensley was a valuable resource for DeRoller later when he was a board member for the Orleans Economic Development Agency and a county legislator.\n\n“Jim always had the best interest of land use policies and promoting proper use, plus programs to enhance the quality of life in Orleans County,” DeRoller said.\n\nBensley worked with the municipalities to develop land use policies along the Lake Ontario waterfront and the Erie Canal corridor.\n\n“These programs enhanced the enjoyment and protection of over 75 miles of Shoreline,” DeRoller said.\n\nDeRoller pushed the Planning and Development Department to take on more work, with the waterfront development plans, a study of the Lake Ontario State Parkway, managing the household hazardous waste collection and other projects.\n\nBensley didn’t shy away from the work, even as he juggled a part-time job for nearly 30 years as a professor in the urban and regional planning program at Buffalo State College. In 2018 he was honored with the SUNY Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Adjunct Teaching.\n\n“He had this passion to keep moving forward and he had a love for Orleans County,” DeRoller said. “He had a strong internal drive, and wanted to move the county forward on land use.”\n\nBensley could bring consensus in meetings that were often contentious, with strong opinions from stakeholders, DeRoller said.\n\nHe was Orleans County representative for Genesee/Finger Lakes Regional Planning Council and also the county’s commissioner on the board for the Rochester Genesee Regional Transportation Authority.\n\nMany of the planning professionals in the region have been taught by him at Buffalo State, and he was the boss to others at the Orleans County Department of Planning and Development.\n\nSarah Gatti was his student at Buff State and then worked as a planner in Orleans County from 2015 to 2019. She now is a principal planner in Erie County for the Department of Environment and Planning.\n\nShe recently nominated Bensley for Michael J. Krasner Professional Planner Award, given by the Upstate Chapter of the American Planning Association. Gatti found out last week Bensley will receive the honor which goes to “an individual for sustained contribution to the profession through distinguished practice, teaching, or writing.” It will be presented to Bensley’s family in October during a ceremony in Ithaca.\n\n“I wanted to nominate Jim because he deserved it,” Gatti said. “He was supremely knowledgeable, and he was very passionate. He treated people with kindness as a boss. He was very supportive. There is a web of planners in the region who have been benefitted from his knowledge and mentorship.”\n\nCalling hours will for Bensley will be Wednesday from 4 to 7 p.m. at Cooper Funeral Home, 215 W. Center St., Medina. His Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Thursday, Aug. 29 at 10 a.m. at Holy Trinity Parish, St. Mary’s Church, 211 Eagle St., Medina.\n\nReturn to top\n\nCounties urge governor to sign bill, requiring sales tax on short-term rentals\n\nPosted 26 August 2024 at 1:43 pm\n\nPress Release, New York State Association of Counties\n\nALBANY – As hundreds of county leaders prepare to attend the annual meeting next month hosted by the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC), county officials held a press conference today to encourage Governor Kathy Hochul to sign a key piece of legislation that will level the playing field between hotels and short-term rental companies.\n\nThe bill that passed both houses of the State Legislature, S.885-C (Hinchey) / A.4130-C (Fahy), requires short-term home rental agencies, such as VRBO and AirBnB to collect sales tax and hotel/motel occupancy taxes. (The measure excludes New York City.)\n\n“While online platforms for short-term rentals have opened new opportunities for homeowners and travelers alike, they also present a variety of unique challenges. It is essential that we strike a balance between innovation and the well-being of our communities. These platforms must contribute their fair share to our economy and adhere to the same regulations as local hotels. This bipartisan legislation will help level the playing field and ensure accountability in the short-term rental industry. I urge Governor Hochul to sign this bill into law,” said Albany County Executive McCoy.\n\nVRBO already collects state and/or local sales taxes or local occupancy taxes in all 49 states other than New York, along with the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico; and has done so for years. Airbnb also collects state and/or local sales or occupancy taxes in 48 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe bill also requires short-term rental companies in the state to provide the State Department of Taxation and Finance with information on each rental unit, including how much each host is renting units for throughout the year.\n\nThis measure was among NYSAC’s top priorities for this year’s Legislative Session, and county delegates are expected to adopt a resolution at their upcoming meeting to urge the Governor to sign this legislation.\n\n“To be clear: we are not opposed to the short-term rental industry. In fact, we appreciate the role they play in supporting tourism in New York State. We just want to bring a little sunshine to this part of the industry so that communities have a better understanding of homes and units that are for rent and how often. And we need to generate some tax revenue to offset additional costs to public safety, health and infrastructure services,” added NYSAC Executive Director Stephen J. Acquario.\n\nReturn to top\n\nOCH expanding MRI services at Medina Memorial\n\nBy Ginny Kropf, correspondent Posted 26 August 2024 at 12:45 pm\n\nMEDINA – Orleans Community Health has announced expansion of its MRI services at Medina Memorial Hospital, beginning Sept. 3.\n\nScheduling an MRI locally has been challenging in the past, according to Scott Robinson, director of Marketing, Communication and Outreach.\n\n“The expansion of MRI services cannot be overstated,” said Erica Chutko, director of radiology and cardiac services at Orleans Community Health. “We can perform an MRI on the brain, spine, chest, abdomen, pelvis and extremities. These tests can help detect potential health concerns, such as strokes, tumors, Multiple Sclerosis and much more.\n\nMRI services returned to Medina Memorial Hospital in the fall of 2022, with testing available one day a week. The increased demand for the service is a driver in the expansion to a second day, according to Robinson. Beginning Sept. 3, MRIs can now be scheduled from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.\n\n“This expansion is all about our desire and goal to bring services to the community,” Robinson said. “Getting an MRI in a timely manner is difficult in many places right now. We’re hoping to help alleviate that with this move.”\n\nAn MRI is a non-invasive imaging exam that does not include any radiation. To schedule an appointment, patients will need a referral from their doctor. In addition, some insurances require prior authorization. Appointments can then be scheduled with the radiology department by calling (585) 798-8054.\n\nReturn to top\n\nHolley, Clarendon and Murray seek to recognize seniors 90 and older\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 26 August 2024 at 9:22 am\n\nHOLLEY – The Holley community is expanding a celebration of residents who are 90 and older to include people outside the village of Holley in the towns of Murray and Clarendon.\n\nThose 90 and older will be celebrated at 1 p.m. on Sept. 13 in the Village Square with a reception in the Community Free Library.\n\nThose residents of Murray and Clarendon who are 90 and older as of Sept. 13, and residents of the village of Holley who have turned 90 since September 2022 are welcome to the gathering.\n\nTo attend, call Holley’s Village Clerk, Rainey Losee, at (585) 638-6367 with name, age and contact information as soon as possible.\n\nReturn to top\n\nMental health counselors share tips for coping with back-to-school anxiety\n\nPosted 26 August 2024 at 9:12 am\n\nPress Release, Catholic Charities of Buffalo\n\nBUFFALO – The start of a new school year is upon us and along with that comes new adventures and opportunities.\n\nHowever, it can also be a time of high stress and anxiety for some kids. The mental health counselors at Catholic Charities of Buffalo are sharing several simple tips for parents and caregivers to help their child cope with anxiety, while also setting them up for a successful school year.\n\n“Supporting our children’s mental health is one of our top priorities as mental health professionals, educators and parents,” said Allie Medina, M.Ed., LMHC, behavioral health program supervisor, Catholic Charities. “A child isn’t born knowing how to navigate the world; it’s our job as adults to teach them while offering unconditional love and support through their day-to-day changes.”\n\nHere are some ideas Catholic Charities mental health counselors recommend trying to help your child or adolescent navigate the new, (but also exciting!) back-to-school changes:\n\nPractice deep breathing together. The day can be overwhelming with a changing schedule and routine. Sit together and take deep breaths to regulate your mind and body.\n\nClose technology at least an hour before bedtime. Technology can keep our minds racing. Trade the phones and tablets for a book or coloring together before bed to calm the mind.\n\nOpen the conversation. Go around the dinner table or at bedtime discuss the peak and the pit of your day.\n\nSqueeze the lemons. The act of squeezing and releasing your muscles can help reduce stress and anxiety. Put your hands in fists like holding two lemons and squeeze all your muscles for 5 seconds. Release for 5 seconds. Repeat as many times as needed.\n\nImplement evening movement. If time allows, take a family walk or bike ride together to get fresh air and prepare the body for a restful evening of sleep.\n\nIn the beginning of the school year, keep your routine and expectations simple. It’s hard enough as an adult to keep track of things. Keep in mind your child’s routine is changing daily. Try coming up with a morning and evening schedule together so they feel involved with what their expectations will be and posting it somewhere in the house like the refrigerator.\n\nLet the morning be easy. Try and prepare for the following day the night before to ensure mornings can be stress-free. Pack backpacks and lunches, check homework, and lay out clothes for the following day.\n\nOne of the most important relationships during the school year is with your child’s teacher. Meet with them and ensure you have their preferred form of communication saved on your phone with login information handy.\n\nWatch changes in your child’s behavior. No one knows your child better than you, the parent. An increase in stress and anxiety can cause noticeable changes in behavior such as a change in appetite, change in sleep habits, change in hygiene, etc. Keep a close eye on those changes and have a calm conversation with your child if you notice something different.\n\nCatholic Charities offers individual, children, and family counseling services throughout the eight counties of Western New York.
