My paternal grandfather, Henry Herbert Brown, was born 07/19/1903 in Montague. I have no knowlege of James Henry Brown's parents - apparently his father died before he was 11 because he told family that after his father died his mother remarried and he left home at the age of 11 and met up with a covered wagon train headed to Texas. He joined the wagon train and ended up in Montague County. He told the story that at the age of 16 he went back to check on his mother and she had already died. James Henry Brown told family he was born around Springfield, MO. One census record indicates that he was born in Georgia? My father seems to remember that James Henry Brown worked at what is now the Nocona Boot Factory. If anyone has any information about either James Henry Brown or Nancy Elizabeth Rodgers, I would certainly appreciate correspondence.\n\nDATE: Wed Sep 1 12:28:22 1999\n\nNAME: Ray Wainner\n\nEMAIL: [email protected]\n\nNOTE: 26830 Virgo Lane, San Antonio, Texas 78260-1833\n\nSURNAMES: COWART\n\nQRYTEXT: Looking for any information on Andrew Jackson Cowart and family members.

John ORR's parents were Sample ORR and Susan PIRATE. At the time of the 1870 U.S. Census, John ORR was head of household, a carpenter, living in Miller Grove, Hopkins County, Texas. His wife was listed as Eliza, age 35. Children in the household were: John, age 14, born in Texas [about 1856] Isaac, age 12, born in Texas [about 1858] Susan, age 10, born in Texas [about 1860] Elijah, age 7, born in Texas [Dec 1862] Andrew, age 2, born in Texas [about 1868] At least two other children are known to have been born after 1870: Lula Arminda, born at Spanish Fort, Montague County, Texas, 5 Feb 1871 (The family, or at least some members of the family, apparently moved to Montague County in late 1870 or early 1871.) Eb, born probably between 1875 and 1880 I have no record of what happened to John ORR and spouse after 1870. I have fairly complete information on the descendants of Elijah and of Lula Arminda. I know nothing about the son, John. However, I did find that there is a John T. ORR buried at Rosehill Cemetery, Ardmore, Oklahoma (1856 — 1922). Based on date of birth, could this be the same person? (I also found a John T. ORR in Montague County, Texas; he was a Justice of the Peace and performed several marriages there at least during October and November 1879.) I know nothing about Isaac, except that he was married and that Lula Arminda and Eb, as children, lived with Isaac and his wife for a period of time. According to family stories from Lula Arminda, Isaac's middle name was Sample. I have no clue as to what happened to Susan and Andrew. I know that Eb was married and that he had at least one daughter, whose name was Gaylon. Gaylon had two marriages; the first husband died and the second husband murdered Gaylon in San Antonio, Texas, in 1948 and then killed himself. (I found a reference to an E. L. ORR who was age 19 in Durwood (present day Marshall County, Oklahoma) in 1902. Might this be Eb?) A note about the elder John ORR's spouse: Her name is listed as \"Eliza\" on the 1870 census. Other information indicates that her name was Arminda PRICE. Perhaps John had two marriages, or perhaps both Eliza and Arminda were given names of the same person. It is notable that John's older brother, William P. ORR, may have been married to a Talitha PRICE. I know that there are a number of individuals who are researching various children of Sample ORR. Any information that might help me trace the descendants of these children of Sample ORR's son, John, would be most appreciated. (I will be happy to provide information on the descendants of Elijah and Lula Arminda to any interested party.) Charles D.
