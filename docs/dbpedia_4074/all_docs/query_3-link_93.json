Here the first courts were held, and here was the place of meeting of the County Commissioners for several years. April 12, 1841, we find the following entry upon the County Commissioners' book:\n\nJesse Yount, Thomas S. Denson and Eli Goddard (Commissioners appointed to relocate the seat of justice of this county) appeared and took the oath prescribed by law. preparatory to entering upon their duties.\n\nApril 15, 1841, these Commissioners made the following report:\n\nThe undersigned Commissioners, appointed to re-locate the county seat of Jackson County, Territory of Iowa, in accordance with an act to amend an act entitled an act to re-locate said county seat, have selected the southeast quarter of Section 22, Township 85 north, of Range 3 east of the Fifth Principal Meridian, and have named said county seat Andrew.\n\nThomas S. Denson,\n\nEli Goddard,\n\nJesse Yount,\n\nCommissioners.\n\nIt seems that it was necessary to have this choice ratified by a vote of the citizens of Jackson County, and, in an election held on the last Monday of May, 1841, Andrew had 208 votes, Bellevue 111 votes, and Center 1 vote, there being a majority of 96 votes in favor of Andrew.\n\nAndrew is the point chosen by three Commissioners, appointed under the Territorial government, and by them designated as the county seat. This commission located the prospective town on the southeast quarter of Section 22, Township 85, Range 3 east, and gave it the name Andrew, being the given or Christian name of the General and statesman from which the county derived its title.\n\n- - - - -\n\nNEWS ITEMS\n\n1848 - ANDREW\n\nThis village is situated in the geographical centre of Jackson county, and contains two stores doing a fine business, two family groceries, one hotel, a good brick school house, a neat Methodist church, a stone building formerly designed for a jail, three attorneys, four physicians, four boot and shoe makers, one tannery, two masons, two blacksmith shops, two wagon makers, one tailor, two carpenters, (and room for more,) and one printing office.

Submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.]\n\n. . . about Bellevue, Iowa\n\nThe town of Bellevue is located on the Mississippi River in Bellevue Township, nearby towns include St. Donatus and La Motte to the northwest, Springbrook and Andrew to the southwest and the Mississippi River on the east edge of town.\n\nData Included:\n\n1878 Jackson County, Iowa Gazetteer\n\nNewspaper Items\n\nFor 1879 History, see History - Towns and Townships\n\nFrom 1878 Jackson County, Iowa Gazetteer\n\nCITY OF BELLEVUE.\n\nHISTORY, STATISTICS, POPULATION, REVIEW, ETC.\n\nBellevue is situated on the Mississippi river, twenty-two miles below the city of Dubuque, and twelve miles from Galena, Illinois. The town site is upon a beautiful plateau of land whose general height is about fifteen feet above high water mark, and is surrounded by an amphitheater of hills which break off the severe cold of winter. Few places on the river present more picturesque or beautiful scenery than that witnessed from the top of the high bluffs, either on the north or south of the town, including the river with its islands, the shores of Illinois beyond, the farms and farm houses up the valley, which runs to a point westward at the distance of about six miles, and the village nestling in the ample area at the foot of the bluffs with its business streets, its levee and its tasty dwellings. A steam ferry boat makes constant trips between Bellevue and the opposite shore, whence a considerable portion of the country trade is received, and steamboats are almost constantly in sight, either at the landing, in the regular up or down river trips, or going to, or coming from Galena. The railroad trains of the Chicago, Dubuque & Minnesota road pass directly through the village to the station, which is just north of the corporate limits.\n\nHISTORICAL.\n\nBellevue has in some respects quite a romantic history. It belongs to a section of country which, prior to 1840, or during the time of the early settlement, was infested by an organized gang of horse thieves and outlaws. These thieves stole horses and committed depredations and sometimes murder in the frontier settlements, extending from Missouri to Rock River, Illinois. Jackson and the adjoining counties on the west, were the theater of the operations of a portion of this gang, as the settlements were scattering and the extensive timber on the Maquoketa, afforded them facilities for concealment and escape from justice. They would steal horses in Missouri and bring them across the country to Bellevue, transferring them across the Mississippi at night, and exchanging them for horses stolen on the east side of the river. This made Bellevue a sort of headquarters or rendezvous for the desperadoes, many of whom were known and identified by the citizens as belonging to the gang; but it was dangerous to point them out publicly, or attempt to have them arrested for they out-numbered the honest settlers, and were in secret alliance with members of their gang who lived in many of the neighborhoods under the guise of respectable citizens. For a long time it was difficult to determine who were honest men and who were thieves and outlaws. When a few of the honest settlers suspected their neighbors, they discussed the matter privately, but were afraid to take any public action, for they did not know who to trust, and in case of being betrayed into the hands of the thieves, they would either be murdered or compelled to leave the country. Many murders were actually committed of citizens who informed of them; others were missing from their cabins and it was never known what became of them. The courts, in the country, could do nothing to suppress them, .as they could bring more witnesses than could be brought against them, to prove an alibi, and by false swearing escape the clutches of the law.\n\nTHE CITIZENS' ASSOCIATION.\n\nThings went on in this way till it became necessary for the settlers to organize for their own self-protection. An association was formed at Linn Grove, in Linn County, in 1839, of which Captain W. A. Warren, then Sheriff of Jackson County, and an active participant in the stirring- events of those pioneer times, gives the following account:\n\nColonel Cox, Mr. Moss and I took our departure, promising Bear we would return the next day. Passing up the Wapsie we came to Russell's, where the town of Fairview is now located. Russell and Mr. Crow accompanied us to Linn Grove to the house of Mr.-- which had been selected as our place of meeting. Arriving there about twelve o'clock we found the house crowded. Cedar County was represented by Messrs. Whitlesy, Culbertson, Roberts and others. Mr. Roberts will be remembered by members of the Territorial Legislature as the gentleman from Cedar, who, upon the introduction of any bill, would invariably address the chair with: ''Mr. Speaker, ar Cedar in that ar bill, if not, I can't vote for it.\" Notwithstanding his little eccentricities of speech, he was a faithful representative, and true to his constituents. Jones County was represented at the meeting by Messrs. Bowen, Beardsley, and perhaps others. The object for which we met was to devise concerted action for the more effectual protection of the settlers from thieves and desperadoes, who were daily preying upon the honest portion of the community. Colonel Cox explained the steps that had already been taken in Jackson County, and said he was glad to see the leading men of his sister counties present. He was an early settler in Illinois, and knew that all new counties were invested with banditti, who fled from justice in the older States, and held full sway for a time on the frontiers. But the hardy and honest pioneers are just the men to finally weed out such a class. He was of the opinion that moral suasion was wasted upon thieves and murderers. You cannot even reach them with the law, for when one of the band is arrested, no matter how strong may be the evidence of his guilt, his confederates will prove an alibi for him. In Illinois we rid the country of them, and found the most effectual means to be hemp, and my idea now is to thoroughly organize and protect every citizen, not only in his property, but in free speech. Let the officers be vigilant, and arrest all trespassers of the law, and see that it is vigorously enforced. Whenever the law cannot be enforced, treat the desperadoes as we did in Illinois. After the Colonel's address the associations was formed, and picked men selected in every county to give information and carry out the plans of the society. Many incidents of horse stealing and passing counterfeit money were related by those present.\n\nTHE BELLEVUE WAR.\n\nAmong the apparently respectable citizens connected with the banditti, and discovered to be a leading man of the gang, was one Brown, proprietor of the Bellevue House, the only hotel then kept in the place. This house was the rendezvous of the thieves in transferring their stolen property across the Mississippi, and at it occurred the fight with the desperadoes known as the Bellevue War, in the spring of 1840. The fight was brought on in the following manner:\n\nOne James C. Mitchell, a prominent citizen, had become obnoxious to Brown's gang, on account of his exposure of their attempts to induce him to join them, and they determined to assassinate him. Accordingly a party entered his house in the evening for that purpose; but Mitchell being absent at a party in the village, they robbed the house and attempted an outrage upon the person of his hired girl. The girl made her escape, and information was conveyed to Mitchell. The leader of the murderous gang was one James Thompson, who appears to have had respectable relations in the State of New York. When Mitchell heard of what had been done, he armed himself and started for his house. On a corner of the street he met Thompson and Montgomery-the latter afterwards noted for the murder of Brown, of Maquoketa. Thompson attempted to shoot Mitchell, but his pistol missed fire, and the shooting was on the other side. Thompson fell, mortally wounded, and expired in a few moments. The Brown thieves made an attempt to lynch Mitchell, but he escaped and fortified himself up stairs in his house till he could send for the Sheriff, into whose custody he surrendered himself.\n\nThis act of daring outrage created a great excitement in the village and throughout the frontier settlements. The honest citizens, fully aroused, demanded lynch law. Captain Warren consulted Judge T. S. Wilson, who advised that the whole party should be arrested and brought before the District Court for trial. Warrants were accordingly issued by Justices Watkins and Harris, and Sheriff Warren was charged with the duty of arresting the parties. Meanwhile Brown and his confederates, some twenty-three in number, had fortified themselves in the Bellevue House, occupying principally the upper story, and, armed with guns and pitchforks, were prepared for a desperate resistance. Captain Warren visited Brown in person, who agreed to surrender if the Captain would guarantee that he would not be at once seized and lynched by the excited people. To this the Captain, after consulting with his friends, agreed; but as he was approaching the house in company with three men, to make the arrests, Brown appeared on the outside and ordered him to halt, saying that he had changed his mind; that he had determined to resist to the last extremity; that Warren might come alone and consult; but if the others advanced another step they would be shot down. Warren finding all efforts to induce a peaceable surrender fruitless, returned and informed the settlers, who, together with the citizens of the village, had assembled to the number of eighty men of the association. Out of these, forty were selected and made ready for the scene of action. Captain Warren ordered them to march so as not to expose themselves to the fire of the enemy stationed up stairs, and when near the house gave orders for them to charge into the building. In this action one of the citizens was shot. Brown met the charging force at the door, and when ordered to surrender dropped his gun, which was discharged in falling. This was the signal for firing from the outside. One of the citizens taking good aim through a window, shot Brown in the neck, killing him instantly. The thieves in the upper story were well armed, so that it was impossible for the besieging party to get up stairs. Warren then called for a brand to set the house on fire, in order to burn them out, and while stooping to kindle the fire at the end of the building on the outside, two shots were fired at him from an adjoining shanty, in which several of the thieves had secreted themselves, which lodged in the clap-boards a few inches above his head. The thieves seeing the house about to be consumed, began to jump out of the back windows and run for the brush in the rear of the building. Some of them were followed and shot. Twelve were captured, mostly in running from the house; among the number were the notorious Young and Fox, the murderers of Colonel Davenport at Rock Island.\n\nBALLOTING WITH BEANS.\n\nThe method of deciding the fate of these desperadoes was rather novel. It was no less than balloting with beans-white beans for hanging, red beans for some other punishment. Carried against hanging by two beans. The punishment inflicted was from ten to fifty lashes on the bare back, and after this salutary scourging the victims were \"rivered \"-that is, put aboard of canoes and sent adrift down the river, with the solemn injunction never to show their heads again in these parts on pain of having their necks stretched. This vigorous treatment of the horse thieves of Jackson and Linn Counties, was the beginning of the effectual breaking up of their operations throughout the county.\n\nEARLY SETTLEMENT.\n\nThe first settler in Bellevue was John D. Bell, who erected the first cabin in the Fall of 1835. The first hotel was built by Peter Dutell, in 1836, and was called the Bellevue House. The town of Bellevue was first laid out by John D. Bell, in 1835, the survey being done by Phillip McLean. It was again laid out by commissioners appointed by the United States, among whom were General George Cubbage and Wm. W. Cahill. At that time lots were valued at $7.50 for front lots and $5.00 for back lots, the proceeds, after paying the commissioners and the cost of surveying, being appropriated to the town. The surveyor on the part of the United Statesâ¢ was George W. Harrison.\n\nCOMMERCIAL STATISTICS FOR 1877.\n\nBellevue has a population of about 2,000, and is a large shipping point both by river and rail. The exports from Bellevue by river are: Wheat, 100,000 bushels; oats, 200,000 bushels; rye, 30,000 bushels. The exports from Bellevue over C., C. & D. Railroad are: North, oats, 50,000 bushels; corn, 30,000; South, wheat, 50,000 bushels; oats, 100,000 bushels; live and dressed hogs, 30,000 head. Freight received during 1877, 3,636,400 pounds; freight forwarded during 1877, 4,417,700 pounds.\n\n[Owen's Gazetteer and Directory of Jackson County, Iowa, Owen Publishing Company, Davenport, Iowa, 1878] tr. by mkk\n\nNEWS ITEMS\n\n- - 1877 - - BELLEVUE SALOONS\n\nITEMS FROM IOWA.\n\nThe beautiful town of Belleview, Jackson County, Iowa, located twenty-five miles south of Dubuque, on the Mississippi River, contains a population of 2,500, and has thirty-two liquor saloons.

There was a postoffice, stores and blacksmith shop and saloon there away back before the war. But the village did not grow much until after the railroad came in 1879. The town was platted in 1873, and was incorporated March 18, 1879, and soon became a substantial growth.\n\nA fine public school building was erected in 1903, and the parochial school in 1908. The Catholic church was built in 1893 and the parochial residence in 1904. The first resident priest was Rev. Luchorman, who died there. The present priest is Rev. Friedman.\n\nThe first postmaster was Z. Montague, who was succeeded by Hon. John Wilson. N. A.

MONTAGUE WAS THE FIRST LA MOTTE MAYOR\n\nNarrow Gauge Road, Churches, Fires, Make Town's History\n\nLaMotte, a town of 325 citizens, is located 20 miles north of Maquoketa on the gravel road which was known as the old Davenport-Dubuque post road. The land was purchased from the government in 1847 at $1.25 an acre by Owen Montague, who before his death, willed the park site located in the center of the town for recreational purposes and the grounds for a public school building.\n\nAbout the same time that the land was purchased, David Montague and John E. Goodenow established a mail route from Davenport, through Maquoketa, Andrew, LaMotte, to Dubuque, one of the earliest mail routes in the state. Mr. Montague named the town after Alexander LaMotte, who was born in Paris in 1818 and died in 1871. Mr. LaMotte was buried in a cemetery ten miles southwest of Maquoketa, and his only living son, LaFayette, now resides in Brighton, Iowa.\n\nZ. Montague was named first Postmaster.\n\nWith the coming of this road LaMotte became a community and business center. However, the town site was not surveyed until 1873, incorporation following six years later, in March, 1879. Z. Montague was the first mayor.\n\nAlso in 1879 came an event which made LaMotte a business center-the narrow gauge railroad, a branch of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul system, was built through the town to Zwingle and then later on to Cascade. This gave the town connection with the main line running through Bellevue, and also with the Mississippi river traffic. The narrow gauge operated until 1933 when it was replaced by a gas rail locomotive. Two years later the track and equipment were sold and since that time the town has depended upon trucking service.\n\nCHURCHES BUILT\n\nChurch history in LaMotte dates back to 1853 when a Methodist church was built, the pastor always residing at Andrew and traveling up to La Motte each week. By 1914 the members had all moved to other cities in the state so the church was sold to the German Lutherans. They dedicated it May 3, 1914, as St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran church.\n\nThe first Catholic church was built by the Rev. Peter O'Malley, of St. Theresa's, in 1893. In 1904 the parsonage was built at LaMotte and a resident pastor, Rev. G. L. Luehrsman was installed. He was followed, after his death, by the Rev. John H. Friedman who, in 1908, built the convent for the Sisters of St. Francis. The parochial grade school and ninth and tenth grades were conducted in the same building- until 1921 when the high school building was erected. Grades 11 and 12 were offered and LaMotte is now proud of an accredited high School, in 1926 the Rev. H. J. Loosbrock, the present pastor, succeeded Father Friedman.\n\nIn 1903 a brick structure was built for the public school, the old building erected in 1868, being torn down. The new building was used until a few years ago.\n\nOutstanding dates in the progress of LaMotte are 1900 when the municipal well was drilled and the waterworks system installed; 1917 when the local farmers purchased the switchboard and telephone equipment from the Interstate Telephone Co., and 1930 when the LaMotte Creamery Co. built one of the finest farmers creameries in the county, now known for LaPride butter. The telephone company now serves 265 subscribers.\n\nOther business houses today include three general stores, three implement firms, drug store, two shoe stores, barber shop, garage, service station, two carpenters, undertaker, dentist, two taverns.\n\nFIRES BRING TRAGEDY\n\nDisastrous fires have caused considerable damage in La Motte. In July 1900, the loss of the Sprank fire was estimated at $18,000. The stock yards, cattle and grain elevator were destroyed July 25, 1910, the loss being $22,000. Columbia Hall, which had been built in 1874, used for a cheese factory, and then converted into a hall in 1893, was destroyed on December 17, 1914, but was rebuilt the following year.\n\nOther fires in 1915 were the conflagration in January when the Electric hall and Ford garage burned to the ground, and in June when fire destroyed the store of Hingtgen Co.\n\nTwo deaths caused by fire, have occurred in LaMotte, one on November 4, 1929, when James Mcinnis of Dubuque met a tragic death in a fire which broke out as he was cooking for a railroad crew on the C. M. & St. P. railroad. A year later, on October 17, 1930, Alfred Teslow, 22 of Decorah, burned to death in the fire which completely destroyed the town hall. An hour before the fire was discovered, Dtslow had been placed in the town jail, a part of the hall, on an intoxication charge. The fire company was unable to fight the blaze as all fire equipment was in the burning building. In addition to the loss of the two-story town hall, a barn and several sheds nearby were also destroyed.\n\nThe oldest resident of LaMotte is Mrs. N. B. Nemmers, who purchased her home in 1882. Mrs. N. A. Hoffmann ranks second, having purchased her property in 1883. One of the oldest buildings in town is owned by Mrs. N. B. Nemmers. It is the birthplace of Major Noble, George Washington Winner, a 36-inch midget who traveled many years on the show circuits and who died in Seattle a few years ago.\n\nTown officials this year are John M. Hoffmann, mayor; J. C. Nemmers, treasurer; W. P. Herrig, assessor; George C. Nemmers, clerk. The councilmen are William Manderscheid, Matthias Konrardy, Leroy Koos, Jacob Hoffmann, and Dr. F. R. Ahlers. N. J. Nemmers is postmaster and the rural carriers are J. C. Noel and A. M. Beringer.\n\n[Source: The Jackson Sentinel, Maquoketa Iowa, Centennial Edition, June 1938] tr. by mkk\n\n1954 - LA MOTTE WAS NAMED FOR FRENCHMAN WHO OPENED LEAD MINES.\n\nLaMotte, with population of 330, is located 20 miles north of Maquoketa on what was originally the Dubuque-Davenport post road.\n\nFirst settler was Owen Montague, who came to Jackson county in 1837. After returning to his home in New York state he moved here in 1843, purchasing his land from a homesteader.\n\nBefore his death, he willed the park site, located in the center of the town for recreation purposes, and also ground for a public school. He was the first postmaster.\n\nThe town was named for Alexander LaMotte, a Frenchman who, after working in Wisconsin lead mines, prospected in the present LaMotte vicinity. He struck a vein of lead ore and opened mines; a tent city sprang up, and the settlement received his name. He remained only a short time, however, spending the remainder of his life in Clinton county.\n\nNarrow Gauge\n\nLaMotte was surveyed in 1873, and incorporated in 1879. residents voting unanimously for the incorporation. That same year, 1879 marked the arrival of the narrow gauge railroad, a branch of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul system, extending from Bellevue to Cascade. The narrow gauge, so known because of its narrow track, operated until 1935, when the equipment was sold, leaving the town dependent upon trucking for its marketing.\n\nA methodist church was built in 1853, but the congregation dissolved shortly after 1900, and since 1912 the building has been used by the Lutheran denomination. It was remodeled and dedicated as St. Paul's Lutheran church on May 3, 1914. The Rev. Gerhardt Bunge, pastor of the St. Donatus Lutheran Church, serves St. Paul's also.\n\nFirst steps toward forming Holy Rosary Catholic parish wee taken in 1892, and it was at first a mission of St. Theresa's, which is in Dubuque county. The church was built in 1893, with the cornerstone laying and dedication ceremony on July 4. The first mass in the uncompleted church was held before there were windows or pews, elderly persons bringing chairs from home. The first resident pastor came in 1903, the year the rectory was built. The Rev. A. J. Schmitz has been pastor since February, 1944.\n\nHoly Rosary grade school was opened in 1908 and in 1921 a complete high school course was established in 1954. The enrollment was 156.\n\nMemorable Dates\n\nFirst public school was a frame building, which was replaced in 1863 by a stone structure, and this in turn by a four-room brick building in 1903. However the school has not been used for a quarter of a century, and public school students now go by bus to the Andrew school. The brick structure was sold in 1954 to Holy Rosary parish for its school expansion program.\n\nOutstanding dates in LaMotte history have been: 1900. municipal well drilled and waterworks installed; 1917. establishment of LaMotte Mutual Telephone association; 1930. establishment of LaMotte Creamery Co., a cooperative. In 1947 Andrew Savings bank opened a branch at LaMotte.\n\nLaMotte Telephone Co., Inc., was formed in 1953, and in 1954 is preparing to provide completely automatic dial service to 225 subscribers.

Goodenow emigrated from Warren County, New York, crossed the Mississippi at Sabula, then called Charleston, and found a family located there of the name of Wood, with a son-in-law named Steen. In the spring of the same year Mr. Goodenow moved west until he came to the Forks of the Maquoketa, where the unusual fertility of the soil, as well as its many other natural advantages, induced him to choose this spot for his future residence.\n\nBetween here and Davenport there was only one family, named Wheeler, located at De Witt, and Mr. Goodenow, in company with an acquaintance named Bates, who was living with him, desiring to go to Davenport, had to drag a load of brush to break down the grass, and thus leave a trail by which to return. At this time there was only one family between Maquoketa and Dubuque-a widow Mullin and her boys, and an old hermit-like fellow named Dixon, and only one tavern in Dubuque, and that built of logs, and two or three stores at which trading was done.\n\nIn 1842 the land excitement came to fever heat, and many towns sprang into existence (on paper), among others Bridge port, laid out by Col. Cox, about two miles and half from where Maquoketa now stands. Another named Lowell, but it was not until 1844, when Mr. Goodenow induced a man named Marr to open a general store, that this became the center around which congregated several families, who formed the nucleus of the future city of Maquoketa. In 1842, the first school house was erected of brick, manufactured for the purpose by Mr. Goodenow. In 1846 he also erected another large building, which became known as Goodenow's Hotel, or half-way house between Davenport and Dubuque.\n\nThe first attempt at a school was in an old building, formerly used as a blacksmith shop, which by patching up with sods and mud, was rendered habitable. This was used until 1846, when Mr. Goodenow, having dedicated one of the most beautiful squares of ground in the city, a large and commodious brick building was erected and called \"The Academy.\" Dr. Lake, at present an honored resident of the city, was the first teacher.\n\nOne of the early settlers was John Shaw, who purchased a claim of eighty acres in 1837, cornering where the Stephens stone block now stands, and who settled on it in 1841. He was one of the most active and energetic men of the place, and died in 1853. His family still reside in Maquoketa, and his son is editor of the Excelsior, one of the leading newspapers.\n\nThe first white child born within the corporate limits of the town was Wesley Nims, his birth occurring in 1840.\n\nThe Rev. M. Salter was the first minister who preached, and his first discourse was delivered in 1839.\n\nWe herewith present a sketch written by Russell Perham, a worthy and esteemed citizen of Maquoketa, who has long been a resident of the place:\n\n\"In March 1838, or forty years ago the coming March, Mr. John E. Goodenow and Lyman Bates, of Warren county, New York, made the first permanent settlement in Maquoketa. They found a Mr. Phillips on a claim one mile north of town, on land now owned by the Sears Brothers, and S. Burleson, William Vosburgh, and Calvin Teeple on claims six miles west of town, they having come in the year before, or in 1837. Of the latter, Mr. Burleson and Mr. Teeple still live on the lands then selected. Mr. Goodenow made a claim on the south-east corner of Main and Platt streets, and Mr. Bates of the land on which he now lives one and one-half miles south. Mr. Goodenow built a log cabin on the north-west corner of his claim, upon the ground on which Cohn's store now stands. This he resolved was to be the future home of himself and prospective family. Here he remained, making that home as comfortable as possible under the circumstances, until the latter part of the summer of 1839, when he returned to New York, and in September following married Miss Eliza Wright, and with her and Thomas Wright and wife, and Amasa Nims and wife, returned to this, the wild western home of his choice. About this time John Clark and Jonas, his brother, together with Z. Livermore, John Shaw, Charles, William and Achilus Gordon, and A. Spaulding came into the neighborhood. Mr. Livermore made a claim on what is now the north-east corner of Main and Platte streets, Mr. Spaulding on the north-west corner, Mr. Shaw on the south-west corner, Mr. Goodenow already having the south-east corner. Each built their temporary home on their claims. John Clarke built a log house in the timber in the south-east portion, known as the Arnold place. Charles Gordon built a blacksmith shop on Mr. Livermore's claim, where the post office now stands, and a man by the name of Ab. Montgomery had made a claim and was living on the place now owned by J. Trout in the extreme southwestern part of town. Thomas Wright took a claim three miles west of the town, and A. Nims located about four miles south. J. Pangborn had also located on the land where he now lives, on the corner of .Main and West Summit streets. There were now eight or nine houses within a radius of two miles and a few more, further out. A post office was established here in 1840, which was called after the name of the place, Springfield; but after Harrison's election to the Presidency, it was removed to Bridgeport, and there remained for about two years.\n\n\"At the time of which we write, Iowa was a Territory of the Government of the United States. Its lands were not in market and were not put on sale until1845, the year prior to its admission as a State. This district, subject to entry at Dubuque, had been surveyed, and the settlers made their claims from this original survey under the auspices of a claim society composed of the first permanent settlers of Dubuque, Jackson and Clinton counties. The object of this society was to protect its members in a peaceable possession and enjoyment of their respective claims, against those who might come at a later date, covet and seek to deprive them by unfair means of their chosen homes. Each member, by the rules of the society, was allowed to claim and hold until the lands came into market, three hundred and twenty acres in a homestead.\n\n\"This society in its day was of great benefit to its members, inasmuch as its rules and regulations were the only law known, except the Territorial, which at that time was of but little benefit, for the reason that its executors were so remote and inaccessible. Many an industrious and enterprising pioneer was compelled to appeal to it for protection against the encroachments of a worthless class of squatters, whose sole business was the securing and sale of the choice claims of the county. This society when appealed to through its officers would gather enmasse, organize a court from its own members, hear the evidence in the case, notify the intruder of its findings, and unless its decision was voluntarily complied with, it was carried into effect by brave hearts and stout hands. This was the only security of the people at this time, and many of this worthless class of vagabonds were compelled to seek new tramping grounds or suffer the righteous indignation of the injured settlers.\n\n\"Under such circumstances was the first permanent settlement made here, and year after year new accessions were made to their numbers. About this time, 1840, it becoming apparent that a little business place must spring up in this vicinity, quite a rivalry was manifested as to its location. Some were in favor of Springfield, some of Bridgeport, and others of the place on which the Rockville mills now stand. The post office having been removed to Bridgeport that seemed to be the favored locality, and Jonas Clark got timber on the ground preparatory to the erection of a small store building at that point. At the same time Thomas Wright and Z. Livermore built a saw mill on the present site of the Rockville mills, where afterwards Mr. Wright built a wool-carding and cloth-dressing mill. Mr. Clark, changing his views as to location, removed his material, built the house now occupied by Mrs. S. D. Tubbs, and opened a store at that point, in which he did business for about two years. In the mean time Mr. Goodenow finding his little corn-cracker under his shed adjoining his cabin, and run by horse-power, was inadequate to the wants of the people, secured the claim on which McCloy's mill now stands, of Ab. Montgomery, at an expense of $25, threw a dam across the stream, a portion of which is still standing, and built a mill, putting in his own corn-crackers. There being no bolts the people were obliged to use their flour, bran and all, unless they sifted it out by a mill seive. At this time there was no mill where bolted flour could be obtained, nearer than Sage's mill, on the little Maquoketa, six miles north of Dubuque.\n\n\" As an illustration of the rustic manner in which many of the first settlers were obliged to live, we will mention the name of John Riggs, who located three miles south of town. He put up the body of a log house, covered it with poles laid crosswise, and piled prairie grass on top of these for a roof. He moved into this rude tenement and set up his stove, but where was his chimney to carry away the smoke. It would not do to build one through the grass covered roof for fear of fire. But a happy thought struck him-he would cut a hole through each of the four sides of his cabin and run the pipe out through these, changing it from one to the other as the wind changed. This is not an isolated case, for very many of the early settlers occupied homes of no greater pretensions, and their diet was as simple as their homes were cheerless.\n\n\"In 1842 the post office at Bridgeport was re-located at Springfield, J. E. Goodenow, postmaster, and the name of the office and place changed to Maquoketa, an Indian name signifying 'Bear River.' Mr. John Shaw had finished off a room in his block house, located on the present site of Mrs. Shaw's brick dwelling house, and put in a small stock of goods. Maquoketa was now triumphant. She had a mill, a store, a post office and a blacksmith shop. Rockville and Bridgeport surrendered, and Jonas Clark, after a severe skirmish with his partner, over the question of removing their stock of goods to Maquoketa, in which revolvers were drawn, finally became master of the situation and established himself on the corner of Main and Platt streets. Mr. Platt Smith about this time, bought the mill erected by Mr. Goodenow, put in bolts, made bolted flour, and the wants of the people seemed almost satisfied. Thus matters moved on, new settlers came in, older ones broke their prairie, fenced their improvements and replaced their old cabins by new and more commodious ones built of hard wood.\n\n\"In 1847 David Sears and Pierce Mitchell came in with a stock of goods and opened their store in the building until recently occupied by Chas. E. Northrop as a cabinet wareroom. Mr. Sears had been here a year or so prior to this and had bought for the firm of Sears & Munson quite a large tract of land just north of town. He now built a dam across the South Fork of the Maquoketa River about one mile north of the crossing of Main and Platt streets, and built a saw mill. He had platted and laid out a town at this point which he called Lowell, and brought on from Cincinnati fine lithograph maps of the projected town. Several of these lots were sold and afterwards built upon. He built for himself quite a fine brick dwelling and commenced the erection of a brick flouring mill, which was completed in the fall of 1849, and called the Lowell Merchant Mills. Thomas Wright removed his cloth-dressing establishment to this place, and between this and the two mills this became quite a place of business. But in a few years this treacherous stream cut across lots above his mill, leaving it high and dry and in a dilapidated condition, when all the machinery was finally removed and the whole went to decay. Mr. Sears now had additional cause for damning the stream more essentially than ever before, for it had floated away his visions of wealth in his mills and projected town. A wag having passed the place a short time after the mill was demolished, remarked to a friend he met in regard to the general appearance of the place, said 'he saw a dam by a mill site, but saw no mill by a damn' d sight.'\n\n\"From 1849 to 1854 nothing of special interest occurred. The remaining Government lands in the vicinity were mostly entered and undergoing improvements by permanent settlers of some means, and the town, keeping pace with the country tributary, increased in business importance. At this time the products of the farm, which was chiefly wheat, found no ready market here, and farmers were compelled to go to Davenport, Camanche, Bellevue or Dubuque with it, and as a general thing, realized only about fifty cents per bushel for it, after spending two days in getting thirty to market.\n\n\"In the summer of 1854 the Iowa Central Air Line R. R. Co., was organized and received its charter, with S. S. Jones, of St. Charles, Ill., as its President, and John E. Goodenow as our resident director. Its eastern connections were located at Sabula, Lyons and Clinton, on the Mississippi River, to run thence westerly to Hauntown, forming a junction, and from there to Maquoketa. This project gave a new impetus and importance to us as a business point, and its improvement became more rapid and of a more substantial character. In 1856 the company received from Congress a grant of $12,000,000 worth of Government lands, on condition that the company complete the road to Maquoketa by January 1st, 1858. In September, 1857, the road bed was in such a state of forwardness as to commence laying the iron, and the parties who were to furnish it, were telegraphed to forward it. But at this inopportune moment the Ohio Trust Company, through whose credit it was to be furnished, failed, and the result was, the iron manufacturers refused to fill their contract and the whole scheme was defeated.\n\n\"In 1860 a project for navigating the Maquoketa river was started, and a steamboat was built expressly for that purpose; but this, too, failed, and we were again disappointed.\n\n\"On September 3d, 1870, the Davenport & St. Paul R. R. was completed from Davenport to this place, and the Iowa Midland from Clinton to Delmar, and on that day trains on each of these roads ran into Maquoketa for the first time that on the Midland running in from Delmar on the Davenport track. This was a proud day for our citizens. What they had been so long striving for was at last accomplished, and Maquoketa from that day became the leading market place for a large section of country.\n\n\"The Davenport & North-Western Railway is now doing a vast and increasing business, under the efficient management of John E. Henry, Esq., and the thoroughly popular and gentlemanly General Ticket Agent, Mr. J. L. Kellogg. The passenger train is conducted under the supervision of that genial king of punchers, Mr. Charles Mitchell, whose attention to patrons and fidelity to the interests of the Company has popularized him with all.\n\n\"In 1873 the county seat of .Jackson County was located here by the popular vote of the county, and this gave increased importance to the place, and from that day it has been the leading business point in the county. Situated as it is, on the Maquoketa river, midway between five excellent water powers; having to the north, and extending many miles east and west, as heavy a body of as fine timber as grows in any country, consisting principally of white, red, yellow and black oak, maple, hickory, black walnut, butternut, basswood and cottonwood, with several other varieties; while on the south, east and west, and extending for twenty miles or more, lies a prairie country as beautiful to look upon, and of as fine a quality of soil as the sun ever shone upon, and all under a good state of cultivation. With no competing business place within twenty miles, there is no reason why under a just and liberal business policy by our business men, it should not maintain its supremacy in the future as it has in the past, and continue to be the center of trade for this rich and flourishing section of Iowa.\"\n\nINCORPORATION.\n\nOn January 27th, 1857, Maquoketa was incorporated as a city, by a special act of the Legislature. The charter was published March 31st, 1857 and adopted on the 26th of April following. On the 4th day of May the first city officials were elected, and the city government was inaugurated three days afterwards, with John E. Goodenow, as Mayor; John Pope, Recorder; Z. Livermore, Daniel Rhodes, A. Hall, J. N. Viall and P. Mitchell, Aldermen.\n\nPOPULATION, ETC.\n\nThe population of Maquoketa has been variously stated. The State Census compiled in 1873-4, gives it a population of 2,112, but the great increase in the progress and prosperity of the place since that time, as well as a very careful estimate from the resources at our command, warrant us in claiming for the city of Maquoketa a population of 3, 000.\n\nMUNICIPAL DEBT.\n\nThe city at present has an indebtedness of $5,000, incurred by the erection of the Court House, which was presented by the city of Maquoketa to the county of Jackson.\n\nEDUCATIONAL FACILITIES.\n\nMaquoketa has a graded school system, which embraces every public school in the city. Well may Maquoketa be proud of her high school, one of the handsomest and stately edifices in the State. It stands on a rising eminence in a beautiful square, commanding a magnificent view of the city and surrounding country. It was erected in 1876, at a cost of $23,000. This school is divided into six grades or rooms, each with a competent teacher; the whole being under the immediate supervision of the efficient superintendent, Prof. C. C. Dudley. There are four other primary schools, one in each ward.\n\nEXPORTS FROM MAQUOKETA.\n\nOver the Iowa Midland Railway, from Nov. 30, 1875, to Nov. 30, 1876:\n\nNumber of bushels of Wheat 30,000\n\nNumber of bushels of Oats 28,000\n\nNumber of bushels of Corn 8,000\n\nNumber of Cattle 550\n\nNumber of Hogs 8,500\n\nNumber of pounds of Merchandise 1,500,000\n\nNumber of pounds of Butter 400,000\n\nOver the Iowa Midland R. R., from Oct. 31st, 1876, to Oct. 31st, 1877:\n\nHogs 8,540\n\nCattle 1,450\n\nHorses 82\n\nOats, bush 27,800\n\nWheat, bush 12,900\n\nRye, bush 2,500\n\nCorn, bush 2,600\n\nBANKING FACILITIES.\n\nThere are two well conducted banking institutions: the Exchange Bank of Maquoketa, and the First National; both doing a safe and extensive business.\n\nBUILDING IMPROVEMENTS.\n\nThe business houses and residences are all of a substantial and generally handsome order, several being especially noticeable for their beauty of design and architecture, such as the Harris Opera House; Centennial Hall and Block, erected in 1876 by Messrs. Field & Sutherland; Exchange Block, corner of Main and Pleasant streets; Union Block occupied by S. Williams; T. E. Cannell's Building erected in 1872, at a cost of $3,500; Excelsior Block and Merchants Block. During the year 1877 it is estimated that over $75,000 was expended in building.\n\nThe new Decker House, now about completed, built by James Decker, formerly of Watertown, N. Y., is one of the finest hotel buildings in this part of the State. Its dimensions are 45x140 feet, three stories high, besides basement and attic; well and substantially built of brick, and on a heavy and permanent stone foundation, and will cost when finished, about $30,000. The basement is 10 feet in the clear, the first story 14, the second 13, the third 10, and the attic 7. The house contains 100 rooms and all finished after the modern style. Few if any cities of its size in the State can boast of as good school buildings, churches, taken all together, court house, stores, hotels, when the new Decker House is completed and opened, and none can compare in the amount of good sidewalks. In a few years more, when the fruits of the spirit of enterprise which now animates our citizens shall have time to be realized, we believe a place containing more pleasant and attractive residences cannot be found. That the spirit to accomplish this is already at work in our midst, can be seen by all who will take a walk around our streets. In the list given below we have only attempted to give the amount of the new buildings and additions of some importance, erected. Aside from this there has been a large amount expended in repairing dwellings, other buildings and for other purposes of which we have taken no account that would make the total run still larger.\n\nThe figures given are the actual amount expended as given by parties owning buildings, and are not fancy figures made for the occasion to swell the total. In our visits we have found that already many are making preparations for building next year, which shows that the work has not yet been so much overdone this year as to cause a standstill next year.\n\nJames Decker, finishing and completing Decker House, commenced last year $15,000\n\nBarnes Bro's extension to machine shop on East Platt street 4,000\n\nA.

C. Swigart, who continued to conduct it consecutively till the fall of 1862. At that time, Mr. Henderson, who was the printer in the office, went into the army, leaving an edition partly set up, which remained in that condition for about two years. Several attempts were made about that time to revive the Sentinel, but they were unsuccessful, and it was finally sold to G. W. Hunt, who removed it to Le Claire, Scott County, in 1866.\n\nThrough the encouragement and patronage of the Democratic party, Mr. Swigart re-established the Jackson Sentinel in the Spring of 1868, under the designation of a \"new series,\" and has since conducted it successfully as a Democratic organ of the county.\n\nThe Sentinel is a well-conducted and ably-edited weekly in quarto form, and has a good circulation.\n\nThe Maquoketa Excelsior, Republican in politics, was established in March, 1856, by Peter Moriarty. In the Spring of 1869, Colonel Woods, the then proprietor, sold to W. S. Beldon who retained possession until the 1st of March, 1876, when his interest was bought by Messrs.

As the country has developed the city has grown in wealth, business, population and commercial standing, and the merchants, as a class, are noted for their liberality and wide range of thought in everything pertaining to the future prosperity of their city. The surrounding country is peopled by an intelligent community of farmers and stock raisers who have in a few years attained comparative wealth and affluence. Right here, within a radius of a few blocks, is transacted more business than is generally done in many cities of double the size and of older settlement.\n\nWe can offer to the newcomer a location in a live and wealthy western city, with a light debt and low taxes. We can offer him real estate at low figures, and pledge him a cordial welcome from a liberal people, and all the social, educational and religious advantages to be desired.\n\n[Owen's Gazetteer and Directory of Jackson County, Iowa, Owen Publishing Company, Davenport, Iowa, 1878] tr. by mkk\n\n* * * NEWS * * * NEWS * * * NEWS * * * - - 1854 - - THE GERMAN BARBER TAKES FRENCH LEAVE\n\nIn the first issue of the Sentinel, in 1854, the editor announced that there was one lack in the county, and that was the fact there was no barber.

It is somewhat remarkable for its rapid growth, the first dwelling house having been erected in the fall of 1872 by Mr. Allen, the present efficient and esteemed postmaster. At that time a small store and a saloon comprised the commercial advantages of the place.\n\nThe town was laid out by Mr. F. M. Miles in 1871, to whose exertions the town mainly owes its prosperity and prominence and after whom it has been named. The town has varied attractions-a beautiful park, a fine school building, with an elegant church edifice erected at a cost of $4,500. It is a very handsome structure, the frescoing in the interior having alone cost over $225. Its bell weighs 800 pounds, and cost $325. The congregation is of the Methodist Episcopal persuasion, with the Rev. W. N. Chaffee as pastor.\n\nThere are two societies-the Centennial Lodge No. 349, I. O. O. F., and the Miles Lodge No. 45, A. O. U. W.\n\nThe Miles Public Library, incorporated Feb. 1st, 1877, has 320 volumes, and is conducted under the management of a president and board of directors.\n\nMiles has a population of about 400, is in a prosperous condition, with ample facilities for building, having timber in abundance adjacent, as well as endless quarries of valuable stone.\n\nIn addition to a general store and drug store:\n\nThe banking interests are well represented by the Exchange Bank of Miles, with J. W. Miles, Esq., a leading grain and stock merchant, as President. There is one good hotel conducted by Mr. Laing, several blacksmith shops, a meat market, an agricultural warehouse, etc.\n\n[Owen's Gazetteer and Directory of Jackson County, Iowa, Owen Publishing Company, Davenport, Iowa, 1878] tr. by mkk\n\n. . . about Monmouth, Iowa\n\nData Included:\n\n1878 Jackson County, Iowa Gazetteer\n\nNewspaper Items\n\nFor 1879 History, see History - Towns and Townships\n\nFrom 1878 Jackson County, Iowa Gazetteer\n\nMONMOUTH.\n\nMonmouth, laid out in 1856 by Dr. L.

It was laid out by Z. DeGroat, in company with several other gentlemen, in the fall of 1870, and it was on the 3d day of December of that year that the first railroad train arrived in Preston. Such was the impetus given to the place by the inroad of the iron horse, that over seventy-five buildings were erected the following year.\n\nPreston is peopled by a class of men at once vigorous and enterprising, who do not propose to take a back seat in the race for future prosperity and aggrandizement. It stands in the midst of good agricultural land, and has excellent railroad facilities. The dwelling houses of some of the residents are costly and handsome, with great scenic advantages, one of the most noticeable being that of Mr. DeGroat, which was erected in 1870 at a cost of $7,000.\n\nThe public school building is very handsome and commodious, occupying a prominent position, and constituting the chief adornment of the town in which it has been built. It was erected in 1873, and cost $10,000.\n\nThere are two fine church edifices, one built by a union of two congregations-Methodist and Congregational, and the other by the Christian or Carmelite denomination. These, coupled with the fact that they have a literary association of more than ordinary merit, insures to the new comer these social, religious and intellectual advantages which should ever be an object of the highest interest. The town is remarkably healthy. Lots in choice locations can be bought for from $50 to $200.\n\nBusiness of all kinds is very active, and there is more shipping done here than at any point between Sabula and Marion.\n\nThe town has a well conducted weekly paper, the Preston Advertiser, with Mr. H. V. Hicks, the worthy postmaster, as editor. Improvements mark the yearly growth of the town, and many valuable buildings have been erected for business purposes.\n\n[Owen's Gazetteer and Directory of Jackson County, Iowa, Owen Publishing Company, Davenport, Iowa, 1878] tr. by mkk\n\nNEWS PRESTON IN ITS EARLY DAYS - OFFICIAL AND OTHERWISE.\n\nWe glean from an early history of Jackson county that Preston came into existence simultaneously with the survey of the old Sabula, Ackley & Dakota railroad in 1869, and that the first train on said road entered the town in December, 1870. For one season Preston was the western terminus of the road, but the next year it pushed on to Marion. The first plat of the town of Preston was made in the fall of 1879, the land, 136 acres, being purchased from the late Christ Farley, Dr. Amos and Mr. Gillett. The land was purchased by the railroad construction company and Z DeGroat, for a consideration of $7,000, an old deserted dwelling being the only building on the land when it was purchased. About 75 lots were sold the first year and in 1877 Mr. DeGroat brought out the interests of the construction company in the unsold lots. The town was named in honor of Col. I. M. Preston of Cedar Rapids, who was prominently identified with the building of the new road.\n\n[Source: Annals of Jackson County Iowa, Reprinted from the Maquoketa Record, published by the Jackson County Historical Society 1907] mkk\n\n1921 - PRESTON VOTES SEWER SYSTEM\n\nPreston has at last secured the sewerage system which has been considered for some time in that city. Preston is among the first towns in Iowa where this question was put to the vote of the people and carried the first time. The cost of the sewer was determined some time ago at $48,248.12, and was later submitted to the vote of the Preston people with returns as follows: 186 yeas and 176 nays.\n\n[Source: Jackson Sentinel (Maquoketa, IA) Friday, April 22, 1921] tr. by mkk\n\nPreston Grew Rapidly in 1870-71; Now Boasts Municipal Light Plant\n\nUnlike the older towns in Jackson county, which started with one or two pioneer cabins and Topsy like, just grew, the town of Preston was named and platted before a single building was, erected.\n\nFoundation of the first structure was begun Dec. 27, 1870; before the next Christmas the town boasted a dozen business firms, including bank and hotel, a depot, numerous fine homes, and two fraternal orders.\n\nThe story of Preston's founding might be diagnosed as a case of railroad fever that turned out well â numerous cases in that era resulted disastrously.\n\nMoved from Buckeye\n\nDuring the winter of 1869-70 there was much interest in southeastern Jackson county concerning the proposed construction of the Sabula, Ackley and Dakota railroad. Enthusiasm ran high. Sabulans pledged $25,000, and Van Buren township voted a five percent tax to raise $15,000.\n\nAlthough the new railroad would leave them almost four miles to the north, residents of the village of Buckeye, too, were interested. Finally convinced that the railroad would not come to them, a few decided to move south to it. This group included Z. DeGroat and A. L. Bartholomew.\n\nSite for a new town was chosen on land owned by William J. Gillett, Dr. Coleman Amos and Christopher Farley. Survey and plat were made, the streets and park named, and the three land-owners recorded the plat. The town was named for Col. I. M. Preston, an officer of the Sabula, Ackley and Dakota.\n\nMeantime, tracks were being laid, and on Sunday, Dec. 26, 1870, the engine stood on the track at what was to be Preston's Main street; The next day work began on Bartholomew's home.\n\nWanted Township School\n\nThe far-sighted founders of the town soon inaugurated a movement for a township high school, then an innovation in the state. Thwarted when, the rural objectors succeeded in changing the township district to rural independent districts, Preston started construction of its own high school in 1873.\n\nIt is interesting to note that,75 years later, in 1946, those independent districts voted to consolidate with Preston.\n\nThe spirit of cooperation among the townspeople resulted in an interesting method of fund-raising for the first church structure. Although it seems unusual to moderns, it was not unique in those days.\n\nUnion Church\n\nBoth Methodists and Congregationalists had been holding preaching services in various buildings, but desired a church structure. Therefore at a community meeting a fund campaign was launched, with the denomination which raised the most money to have the privilege of naming the church.\n\nBut when the reports were in, it was discovered that the majority of the money had come from those who were neither Congregationalists nor Methodists. Thus a Union church evolved with members of both denominations having equal representation, on the executive board.\n\nLater, the inevitable occurred. Dissention arose, and separate congregations were formed.\n\nPreston Today\n\nListed in the 1950 census with population of 684, Preston is a busy, civic minded town. It boasts one of the ten largest creameries in Iowa, and is the home of the Farmers Mutual Aid Insurance association, which claims over forty million dollars insurance in force.\n\nThe school, built in 1929, was enlarged following the 1946 consolidation and has 310 pupils. The four churches are Lutheran, Catholic, Methodist and Presbyterian. The home-owned telephone company has 650 patrons.\n\nActive organizations include the American Legion and auxiliary, Woman's club, and newly-formed Lions club with 49 members.\n\n[Jackson Sentinel, Maquoketa, Iowa, May 18, 1954] tr. by mkk\n\n. . . about Sabula, Iowa\n\nSabula Main Street Circa late 19th Century.\n\nThe Children in the photo could be Henry Foster's children.\n\nPhoto created from a photographic glass plate and contributed by Dwight Furleigh.\n\nSabula, was not an island city when it was first settled, flooding around the town was the result of building Lock and Dam Number 13 on the Mississippi River south of town.

A steam ferry runs from this point to Savanna, which brings it into intimate relations with Illinois. This town has the facilities of two roads to carry the immense aggregate of produce which comes in from the surrounding country.\n\nThe Chicago, Clinton & Dubuque Railroad have a station here, as well as the S., A. & D. R. R., mentioned before, who maintain one of their largest depots here. Besides these outlets and inlets for prosperous life, the citizens have improved their roads within the corporate limits by means of a wise outlay in macadamized roads, which give excellent approaches from the railroad stations and from the agricultural districts.\n\nThe name of the town Sabula, signifies sand, in the Indian tongue, and this word best describes the shifting nature of the deposit upon which the place has been built, hence the necessity for good road making.\n\nSABULA THIRTY-FIVE YEARS AGO.\n\nIn 1843, Sabula, then called Charlestown, contained twenty dwellings, mostly frame buildings, there being only one of brick, and that one not quite finished. There was one tavern; one store, (which was occasionally closed while the proprietor made a trip to Galena to replenish his stock,) one blacksmith, one wagon maker, two shoemakers, three or four carpenters, and a cooper or two. There was neither church nor school house in the town. There was no building west of Broad street and only three in that. The half of a small beef could not be sold in a long, summer's day, and half of what was sold was never paid for. Wood was delivered and corded on the river bank in town at two dollars and a half a cord. Beef sold at two or three cents a pound, and pork a dollar and a half per hundred. Wild hay, delivered on the ground in cock, brought one dollar per ton. Chopping was paid for at from fifty to seventy-five cents per cord. Rails, one dollar per hundred. Whiskey \"by the small,\" at fifty cents per gallon could be had almost anywhere. But few horse teams were to be seen, oxen being chiefly used. Galena was the market, and the only place to obtain cash for produce, but that town being the end of the market, the seller had to take whatever price was there offered him.\n\nAt Sabula, and in the vicinity, a young cow and calf would bring nine dollars in work or trade; while a dozen of chickens would stall the market at any time. Sunday was chiefly devoted to hunting or fishing, playing cards for money in some secure place, or openly pitching horse shoes in front of the \"Iowa Exchange.\" There was no sidewalk, nor any thought of such an expensive luxury. There was a time, though somewhat later, when the nearest magistrate lived five miles off, and the only available constable lived near him. Men could come to town, and get uproariously drunk, without any fear of the law, or being interfered with, and of course many availed themselves of the glorious opportunity.\n\nIn 1844, the water was over the bottom nearly the entire season; and one settler who lived about three miles from town, made a practice of wading once or twice a week to sell a few pounds of butter, at from five to ten cents a pound; he died that fall. Families living from ten to fifteen miles distant were looked upon as neighbors, and depended upon Sabula to trade in, and there obtain their necessary supplies. The country was but thinly settled. There were no improvements from the farm of the late Israel Day, west to the valley of Cooper Creek; nor from George F. Green's south to where Bodie now lives; nor west to Deep Creek.\n\nEDUCATIONAL FACILITIES.\n\nThe public schools of Sabula are well conducted. There is a Central School Building and two ward school houses, and the combined institution is graded in three departments. There are other persons engaged in the work of tuition here, outside of the public schools and the spirit of emulation operates wholesomely to the benefit of the community.\n\nTHE PRESS.\n\nThe Sabula Gazette is a weekly quarto paper, with Dr. J. F. Fairbank as editor and proprietor. It was started by a joint stock company in 1865, and has seen many changes, but now is thoroughly identified with the business interests of Sabula, independent in politics, and has a liberal patronage.\n\n[Owen's Gazetteer and Directory of Jackson County, Iowa, Owen Publishing Company, Davenport, Iowa, 1878] tr. by mkk\n\nFrom a 1908 Publication\n\nSabula and its Environs as They were in 1843.\n\n(From Sabula Gazette.)\n\nThe following article first appeared in the columns of the Gazette of July 31, 1880, and was written by the late Dr. J. G. Sugg, one of the pioneers of this locality, founder of our Pioneers' and Old Settlers' Association, and one of the most reliable local historians, being possessed of a remarkable memory and a fine education. At the time of publication Dr. Sugg wrote of the days \"Thirty-seven Years Ago,\" and the only change is to make it conform with the changes that have been made since the article was originally written, and to omit unimportant matter.\n\nIn 1843 Sabula; then called Charleston, had few inhabitants and fewer dwellings. On the river street, from Long's sawmill to the railroad bridge, there were only eleven buildings, namely: A large, rudely built frame warehouse, first owned by a man named Carey, standing on the bank of the river, about opposite the present residence of Henry Cohrt. Next was the old frame dwelling house, then owned and occupied by James Leonard (father of the late Jas. E. Leonard), and standing on the ground now occupied by Thompson's store. A short distance below this, and in the street, stood an abandoned log house. A frame building, occupied then and until his death in 1845, by R. H. Hudson as a dry goods store, was located on the lot south or the present city hall. Then came the \"Iowa Exchange\" a large two-story frame building, the only hotel in the village. This building was torn down years ago and the handsome brick residence of the late A. H. Berner occupies its site. On the ground now occupied by the old stone store building, north of J. L. Kimbell's residence, stood a rough log house built tor the purpose of supplying the much needed \"hash\" tor the few boarders of those early days. Next came the ancient frame building occupied by the late Dr. E. A. Wood as a general store, on the corner where Geo. Laing's elegant home is now located. This was emphatically THE store, it being, with the exception of the Hudson store before noted, the stock in which was very small and limited, the only store in the place, and had no competitor nearer than Bellevue on the north and Lyons on the south. And even this solitary store was closed at times while its owner was away at Galena or elsewhere, procuring new goods.\n\nA short distance south or the last building named stood a respectable frame dwelling, since destroyed by fire, but then owned and occupied by Ulysses Steen as a dwelling and hotel; on the river bank opposite were two frame buildings, one being the old store house at the public landing, across the street southeast of Geo. Laing's residence built by Wm. Hubbel, and a short distance south was a two story frame residence. And lastly, on the southeast corner of Quarry street, stood a large rambling frame building, frequently called \"Wood's Castle\", then owned and occupied by James Wood and family, ancestors of the late E. A. and Jerry Wood. Not one of the above named remains today (1906) to mark the passing of pioneer days.\n\nReturning to the north end of the then village, there were on Pearl street, first, the brick dwelling house built by William Cameron (who was afterward drowned in the river by the sinking of a flat boat loaded with wood) standing on the corner now occupied by Henry Cohrts' dwelling. South of this was all open ground until we came to Dominy's blacksmith shop, a rough board shanty standing on the ground now covered by Busch's meat market, Goos's barber shop and Dallagher's cigar factory. At the rear of his shop this worthy son of Vulcan made his charcoal for the forge fire, burning cords of wood at a time for that purpose, the escaping gases floating through town and filling the houses and the nostrils of their inmates with odors very different from those of 'Araby the blest'. Adjoining this shop, was a wagon shop presided over by our pioneer townsman, Fred Schramling, and who took in payment for his work what he could get, \"just to accommodate\", sometimes cash, sometimes produce, and at least once, stocking yarn. He used for his work native timber, seasoned as well as circumstances would permit. A little further south in the same block was a goodly appearing dwelling, not altogether finished, the enterprising individual who started it leaving for parts unknown and forgetting to pay his debts. One of his victims levied upon the house and sold it to our pioneer preacher Rev. Oliver Emerson, the purchase money being raised by subscription. The building was moved south onto the lot now occupied by M. Gohlmann's handsome home, and fitted up for a residence on the first floor, the second story, used for church services, being reached by an outside stairway. On the lot next to where the building first stood, was a small one story house, owned and occupied by one Miller. South of this and on the east side of the street stood a one-story frame building owned and occupied by J. S. Dominy, who some )ears later moved it to the rear and erected a stone residence in front of it, being the building now occupied by Miss Eliza Moss, a daughter of Mrs. Dominy by a former husband. Across the street stood a small one and a half-story frame residence, which later was greatly enlarged and became the \"Western Hotel\" and is now the residence of the late Geo. Bryant and Mr. Freede. The next south was a frame residence owned by James Hudson on the 16t [?] now occupied by Mrs. Thos. Scarborough's home. Then came the frame residence on lot 3 in the same block, which has just recently been overhauled and rebuilt by E. S. Day for a tenement house. The residence on the corner of Pearl and Washington street, now occupied by Walter Willett came next, while in the middle of the same block was another small frame residence. Just north of Busch's meat market was a large frame residence, then owned and occupied by E. A. Wood, while on the opposite corner south was the same building that occupies the site at the present time, then owned by Wm. Hubbel, but for many years past the property of Mrs. M. E. Tucker, of Milwaukee. This house, although not very pretentious at the present time, was in 1843 the ultima thule, the ne plus ultra of Pearl street. From that point south all was vacant. West on Broad street, on the lot south of S. E. Day's residence, was a frame building occupied by old Mr. Hudson. The next residence was three blocks north; Thos. Marshall had just erected a large frame residence, which was, many years later, transformed into a modern home by A. J . Copp, and is now occupied by O. A. Manning. One house three blocks further north completed and ended Broad street. There was also a small shanty looking building just northwest of the present location of the Milwaukee depot, but all the rest of the town site was a \"waste howling wilderness\", with not a vestige or street, highway or improvement being visible. There was no church nor school house, nor even a graveyard. There was no butcher shop, no barber shop nor bakery nor grocery store, but whiskey was abundant. The only available grist mill was Hubbel's, later owned by the Dickinsons, and that of Luther Bowen, two miles east of Savanna.\n\n[In the list of \"living actors in the busy scenes of those days\" in Charleston, as written by Dr. Sugg, L. H. Steen is the only one living today and he was a small boy at that time.]\n\nAt the period of which this paper speaks, a growth of tall, luxuriant grasses covered every spot of un-timbered low lying lands adjacent to the village. Immediately west of town the grass grew so tall that a man on horseback passing from Sabula westward on the traveled road, couldn't see men making hay, though only a few rods distant, the grass being from five to eight feet high and Indeed It has been known, by actual measurement, to reach 10 feet high in some places.\n\nA tri-weekly mail between Dubuque and Davenport was our best mail service in those days, and it took a full week to correspond with Andrew, the then place of county business. The post office was kept at the private house of William Hubbel, and the arrangements of the office consisted of 20 small pigeon holes.\n\nWhen death visited the little community and had chosen its victim, the cost of funerals (including a black walnut coffin with a raised lid) seldom exceeded six dollars - five dollars being the price of the coffin - a wagon was used for a hearse and, with all the attending vehicles, was furnished gratis by the owner.\n\nIn 1843-4 and 5, a quarter of beef would glut the market, and a single hog of moderate size could not find a purchaser. Two cents a pound for fore quarter of beef and three cents for hind ones, was the ruling price, and pork, when it could be sold or traded at all, brought two or three cents a pound. Town lots were freely traded (there was no disposition to pay cash) at from $5 to $10 each, and merchantable produce had to find a. cash purchaser at Galena, there being no other market. In 1844 the writer (Dr. J. G. Sugg) sold in Galena a five-year old steer, a five-year-old Durham cow and a good four-year-old scrub cow for $30 for the lot, .and spent four days in going and returning. At this time a fairly good cow with a young calf sold at from $9 to $10. Money was at that time and for some years later, loaned at from 20 to 25 percent, and yet the law was quite as severe against usury then as it is now.\n\nLeaving town and going northward; there were but nine farms between this place and Clark's Ferry, namely: Carroll's, McCabe's, Cavanaugh's, Thos. Scarborough's, Plunket's, McMahon's, Newberry's, Campbell Caldwell's, Parks, on the Maquoketa bottom. Returning to the road going west there was the farm for many years owned by J. G. Sugg, now owned by the estate of the late Geo. W. Bryant. On this farm Dr. Sugg had a story and a half hewn log house, a log barn covered with hay, and about six acres under cultivation. To the west on what is now the N. C. White farm, was a rough log cabin and a few acres or cultivated land that was held as a claim by Arthur Mullen. Next on the road was Andrew Smiths, now occupied by Peter Schroeder. The next, the claim of W. B. Beebe, now owned by John Kunau. The next was James Westbrook's farm, now owned and occupied by Martin Harmsen. Adjoining this on the west was a place then claimed by one Shay, now the Jerry Bruce farm. The next one was the farm now owned by Theo. Rodden of which but a few acres was under cultivation. From this farm to the little patch claimed by Bart Gorwin on the waters of Copper Creek-a distance of more than three miles, was as far as they could reach, an unbroken wilderness, no trace of improvement visible on either side, and wolves fearlessly traveled on the road at noonday. When Thomas Pope halted near the township line, since called Mt. Algor, and began to prepare for a residence, people wondered at his temerity in settling at such a place and essaying to make a farm so far from timber, springs or running stream. From Corwin's to Deep Creek there were six small farms, one of them a mere \"bachelor's nest.\" What is now known as Van Buren, then called 'Backeye' contained but nine farms from the Maquoketa road north to the valley of the river of that name, while the country lying to the south of the road and east of Copper Creek was destitute of settlement, and what is now Miles and the adjacent country was known as \"the prairie near the big spring west of Green's.\"\n\nReturning to the west road and taking the one leading south through Canada Hollow, the first improvement encountered was a little shanty with a few acres broken, owned by B. Hudson on Sec. 24, 84-6. The next was a small frame house where Joseph Doty, then a single man, lived and farmed the adjoining land. This place is now owned by J. J. Summerville. Next was a hewn log house belonging to Jas. Canfield. A little further south and east lived Peter Schramling and family, and a short distance to the west, on the same creek, known as the Schramling Creek, lived or stayed that jovial and hearty pioneer, Joseph McElroy. Here in his chosen locality at the foot of a bold bluff, lived our friend in single blessedness and where, like Alexander Selkirk, he was monarch of all he surveyed. His abode was well known to the settlers south of him, and although a temperate man himself he has \"many times and oft\" saved from almost certain death by freezing, his inebriated acquaintances of Clinton county, who, unconscious of their condition and consequent danger, perhaps gave him a call or a shout as they wended their way home. [Joseph McElroy passed away at the home of his daughter, Mrs. J. F. Schramling in this city, on February 19, 1906, and was the last of those sturdy pioneers are mentioned in this article, and he still owned the farm referred to above at the time or his death.] From this pioneer dwelling to Haun Town (except a few acres lower down the creek, on what was called the Hudson claim, and an unfinished building on land now owned by Louis Hundevard) the all-conquering axe or civilized plow had left no trace. Haun Town was unborn. The place had two small houses and there was an unfinished structure intended by a man named Barber for a hemp mill.\n\nAgain returning to the west, or Maquoketa road, and leaving it at the crossing of Elk Creek and following that stream southward, the first building encountered was a frame on what Is now the farm of Nelson Kimball, but where at that time lived George F. Green and family, including the Kimballs, then men, but unmarried. The next along the creek was H. G. Crary's farm, and still further south but adjoining, was that of George Hollis, both farms in later years being owned by Bodie.\n\nWith the exception of a small field on the land now owned by Hans Jess and a small one in Clinton county then claimed by a man named Wilson, later owned by Robt. Walker and now the property or John Thompson, all land right and left, was open and unclaimed.\n\nIn closing his article Dr. Sugg says: \"Although the foregoing description of the condition of Sabula and the surrounding country in 1843, may not be minutely and in every particular strictly accurate, yet it is believed to be substantially true, and that pioneers who survive and peruse it, will recognize the faithfulness of the picture, and fully endorse the statements therein made.\"\n\n[Source: Annals of Jackson County Iowa, Reprinted from the Maquoketa Record, published by the Jackson County Historical Society 1907,] tr. by mkk\n\nNEWS ITEMS.\n\nSABULA, ON RIVER, IS EASTERNMOST TOWN IN STATE; IS NOTED FOR COMMERCIAL FISHING\n\nBy Wade Guenther\n\nSabula, Iowa's easternmost town, has a population of close to 900 and is entirely surrounded by water. Lying on the west bank, of the Mississippi river, it is bounded on the west by Sabula Lake, 640 acres of water well stocked with fish; to the north and south are sloughs and lakes and the town is steadily gaining popularity as a recreation center. Hundreds of people visit Sabula each weekend to enjoy fishing and boating.\n\nSixty years ago Sabula was Jackson county's leading industrial center, having a packing house employing about 200 men from November 1st to May 1st each year; a flour mill, an oatmeal mill, sawmill, planing mill, sash and door factory and a factory producing barrels, hogsheds and firkins for the packing house.\n\nPrior to 1880 the Sabula, Ackley & Dakota railroad operated a machine shop in Sabula, but when the S. A..& D. was absorbed by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul railway, the shop was moved to Savanna, Ill. At the present time the town's only industry is, a poultry processing plant operated by George Vallet.\n\nCommercial Fishing\n\nCommercial fishing is engaged in to a considerable extent with about 120,000 pounds of rough fish - carp, buffalo and perch - and about 25,000 pounds of dressed catfish being shipped annually. Most of the commercial fishermen engage in trapping during the winter months.\n\nThe Sabula Consolidated school district has a total, enrollment of 285, with 75 in high school. Myron Thomas is superintendent of schools. Chas. B. Cotton is president and James L. Petersen secretary of the school board. Other members of the board are Harry Johnson, Fred Norskow, Carl Papke and Victor Robinson.\n\nGeorge Ulmer is mayor of the town and has been for a quarter of a century. S, F. Haynes is town clerk, James L. Petersen, treasurer, and the council is made up of Wm. Huebner, Frank Doyle, Victor Robinson, W. E. Allen and Carl Papke.\n\nEarly History\n\nThere are three churches - Methodist, Calvary Lutheran and St. Peter's Catholic church. Lodges represented include Masonic, Eastern Star, Odd Fellows, Daughters of Rebekah, Knights of Pythias, Pythian Sisters, American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n\nSabula's history dates back to 1835 when two men, Dorman and Hinkley crossed the Mississippi river from Illinois on a log and took up residence here. In 1836 Dr. E. A. and Jeremiah Woods arrived on the site, bought out Hinkley's interest and the following year had a survey made and laid out a townsite.\n\nThe plat of the new town, named Carrolport, was recorded at the federal land office in Dubuque and settlers began arriving. The name of the town was soon changed to Charlestown, but it developed that there was a town by the same name in Lee county, so in 1846 the Sabula was adopted and it has remained as such.\n\n[Jackson Sentinel, Maquoketa, Iowa, May 18, 1954] tr. by mkk\n\n1875 - SABULA, JACKSON CO., IOWA.\n\nA Flourishing Little City by the River\n\nA Brief Summary of its Business and Manufacturing Interests\n\nSpecial Correspondence of The News.\n\nSABULA, Jackson Co., Iowa, June 15 - This enterprising little city is situated on the Iowa shore, in Jackson county, opposite Savanna, 160 miles from Milwaukee. It is approached from the Illinois shore by a steam transportation ferry owned by the W. U. R. R., this being the point where all the freight over this important line is transferred in bulk for all points along the line of the Iowa Division.\n\nThis place, like Savanna, has\n\nAN INTERESTING HISTORY\n\nin connection with the building of the W. U. R. R. and other competing lines and from many of the old settlers of this place I gathered many little scraps of inside history into the workings of the railroad companies, with reference to the aid extended by the towns along this line, and the commercial advantages derived since their completion. Space will not permit me to enter into details but will reserve this matter until a more favorable opportunity when the Western Union road and its intersecting lines will be made the subject of a special correspondence for the DAILY NEWS.\n\nPOPULATION.\n\nSabula contains a population of about 1,500, and is situated on an island, a water channel, commencing above the town, and following the line of the bluffs about two miles from the river empties into the Mississippi again below the town, affording a ridge of land along the bank of the riv"
