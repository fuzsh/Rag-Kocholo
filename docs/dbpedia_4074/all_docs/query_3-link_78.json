        "text": "SOME OF SUMMER’S MOST INTERESTING museum exhibitions are historic, presenting the first institutional solo shows of artists spanning generations.\n\nThe selections include the first U.S. solo museum exhibitions of Frank Walter (1926–2009) at The Drawing Center in New York, Leilah Babirye at the de Young Museum in San Francisco, and Calida Rawles at Pérez Art Museum Miami. In addition, the UK’s The Hepworth Wakefield in West Yorkshire is offering a rare opportunity to see three notable solo shows focused on Igshaan Adams, Sylvia Snowden (first public exhibition in Europe), and Ronald Moody (first major exhibition) at one venue. Meanwhile, a survey of Tyler Mitchell is featured at Atlanta’s High Museum of Art, the artist’s hometown museum. Notable traveling shows have opened at new locations and great group exhibitions are on view too, exploring collage works, African American quilts, diasporic photography, and more. A selection of 18 summer shows follows:\n\nARTHUR JAFA, Love is the Message, The Message is Death (still), 2016 (video: color, sound, 7 minutes, 25 seconds). | Collection Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Gift of R.H. Defares to the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, 2017.34. © Arthur Jafa, Courtesy of the artist and Gladstone Gallery\n\nArthur Jafa: Works from the MCA Collection @ Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Chicago, Ill. | June 1, 2024-March 2, 2025\n\nThe thought-provoking practice of artist and filmmaker Arthur Jafa (b. 1960) is an elegy on Black life, interrogating all of its complexity through the powerful language of visual imagery. The Los Angeles artist works across film, video, photography, and sculpture. Presenting major video works by Jafa from MCA Chicago’s collection, the exhibition spans the past decade. The videos “APEX” (2013), “Love is the Message, The Message is Death” (2016), “The White Album” (2018), and “Akingdoncomethas” (2018) are on view with additional photographic and sculptural works.

Courtesy the Artist and Yancey Richardson, New York\n\nZanele Muholi @ Tate Modern, London | June 6, 2024-Jan. 26, 2025\n\nSouth African artist and activist Zanele Muholi (b. 1972) is celebrated the world over for their artful, powerful, and political images. Initially recognized for photographic portraits that illuminated Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer and intersex lives in South Africa, Muholi gained even wider attention for striking black-and-white self-portraits brilliantly styled, often with ordinary objects rife with meaning related to the domestic work of the artist’s mother. This is the first major UK survey of Muholi. More than 300 photographs are featured, from their first body of work in the early 2000s to the present ongoing self-portrait series Somnyama Ngonyama (Hail the Dark Lioness). The exhibition first opened briefly in 2020, but was shuttered by the lockdown during to the COVID-19 pandemic. This encore presentation follows its European tour and includes new works produced since the initial showing.\n\nHanging in the background of this work, Michael C. Thorpe has installed an homage to the Studio Museum in Harlem poster for the 1985 group exhibition “Tradition and Conflict: Images of a Turbulent Decade, 1963-1973,” which featured, “Pray for American” (1969), a body print by David Hammons. | MICHAEL C. THORPE, “Living Room,” 2021 (fabric, thread, and quilting cotton, 45.25 h x 65.5 w inches, unframed). | © Michael Thorpe, Collection of Amy Rauner. Photo by the artist\n\nMichael Thorpe: Homeowners’ Insurance @ Fuller Craft Museum, Brockton, Mass. | June 8-Dec. 1, 2024\n\nMichael C. Thorpe (b. 1993) “paints” in a quilt format, picturing interior scenes, portraits, and landscapes that reflect his daily experiences, friends and family, and historic figures. Within the color-rich compositions, Thorpe explores abstraction, references sports and music, and artistic beacons such as Gee’s Bend quilters, David Hammons, and the Studio Museum in Harlem. The Brooklyn, N.Y.-based artist is presenting 16 works made between 2020 and 2024 in the exhibition.\n\nTYLER MITCHELL, “Albany, Georgia,” 2021 (pigmented inkjet print). | © Tyler Mitchell, Courtesy of the artist\n\nTyler Mitchell: Idyllic Space @ High Museum, Atlanta, Ga. | June 21-Dec. 1, 2024\n\nThe photographs of Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Tyler Mitchell (b. 1995) are tender and alluring. His images are possessed with a keen sense of freedom and self-determination, joy, style, and leisure. In 2018, Mitchell received global attention when he photographed Beyoncé for Vogue’s September issue, becoming the first Black artist in history to shoot the fashion magazine’s cover. The exhibition is a homecoming of sorts for Mitchell who was raised in the suburbs of Atlanta. More than 30 images made between 2017 to 2024 are on view, including “The Hewitt Family” (2021), which was recently acquired by the High Museum of Art, and a photo-based sculptural work featuring more 20 families from the Atlanta area who—like Mitchell when he was growing up—are members of Jack and Jill of America.\n\nFRANK WALTER, “Self Portrait Series: Yellow Shirt (Man in Tree),” n.d. (oil on photographic paper, 10 x 8 inches / 25.2 x 20.2 cm). | © Frank Walter\n\nFrank Walter: To Capture a Soul @ The Drawing Center, New York, N.Y. | June 21-Sept. 15, 2024\n\n“To Capture a Soul” is the first U.S. solo museum exhibition of Frank Walter (1926–2009), a prolific Antiguan artist who consummately captured his surroundings and experiences. Under-recognized in his lifetime, Walter was a brilliant thinker who left behind thousands of paintings, drawings, sculptures, and photographs, hundreds of hours of audio recordings, and a 50,000 page archive, including poems, narrative prose, and musical scores. He made portraits, landscapes, and abstract compositions, small works in an array of styles that provided a window into his artistic practice and worldview on “issues of race and identity, the legacy of slavery, the colonial and postcolonial experience, and the history and politics of Antigua, Barbuda, and beyond.”\n\nInstallation view of “Leilah Babirye: We Have a History,” de Young Museum, San Francisco, Calif., 2024. | Photo by Gary Sexton, Courtesy de Young Museum\n\nLeilah Babirye: We Have a History @ de Young Museum, San Francisco, Calif. | June 22, 2024-June 22, 2025\n\nWorking with ceramic, wood, and discarded objects, Leilah Babirye (b. 1985) makes sculptural portraits representing her LGBTQ+ community. For her first solo museum exhibition in the United States, Babirye is presenting 12 sculptures, including three created specifically for the de Young show. Born in Kampala, Uganda, Babirye lives and works in Brooklyn, N.Y. Her busts, masks, talismans, and towering totemic forms are presented in dialogue with the de Young’s historical African art collection.

Photo by Andy Keate\n\nSylvia Snowden: Painting Humanity @ The Hepworth Wakefield, West Yorkshire, UK | March 16-Nov. 3, 2024\n\nThe Hepworth Wakefield is presenting the first solo institutional exhibition in Europe of Sylvia Snowden (b. 1942). An abstract artist who lives and works in Washington, D.C., Snowden paints with a sense of abandon. She is not afraid of engaging with the canvas. Thick with paint and rich with color, the result is incredibly powerful and moving. The exhibition is a tight survey of 10 paintings dating from the 1970s to 2001. The earliest works were produced in the years following her foundational education. Snowden earned both a BFA and MFA from Howard University, where she studied with David C. Driskell.

Photo © Tate\n\nRonald Moody: Sculpting Life @ The Hepworth Wakefield in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, UK | June 22-Nov. 3, 2024\n\n“Sculpting Life” is the first major exhibition of Ronald Moody (1900-1984), one of Britain’s most highly regarded Modernist sculptors and a founding member of the Caribbean Artists Movement. Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Moody arrived in the UK in 1923 to study and practice dentistry and then visits to the British Museum moved him to become a sculptor. More than 50 figurative sculptures and paintings are on view. His work is displayed in conversation with ancient works on loan from the British Museum that inspired the artist to turn to sculpture and works by his peers and contemporaries.

For his latest exhibition, Adams is presenting two new tapestries and a new immersive cloud installation with recent sculptures and textiles. The works explore “the impact of lived experiences and traumas on the human psyche, with a particular emphasis on the healing potential of movement.”\n\nTHOMAS J.

A Democrat from Brooklyn, N.Y., she was the first Black woman elected to Congress (1968) and first woman to campaign for president on a major party ticket (1972). Celebrating the centennial of the political legend, this is the first major museum exhibition to document Chisholm’s life and work. Presented by the Museum of the City of New York with the Shirley Chisholm Project at Brooklyn College, the show features art, photographs, video, and a wide variety of historical artifacts.

Courtesy the artist and Lehmann Maupin, New York, Seoul, and London\n\nCalida Rawles: Away with the Tides @ Pérez Art Museum Miami (PAMM), Miami, Fla. | June 27, 2024-Feb. 23, 2025\n\nBridging hyperrealism and poetic abstraction, Calida Rawles (b. 1976) explores the symbolism of water as a space of healing and history. Working from photographs, the Los Angeles artist paints her subjects immersed in water, usually pools.

Duffy, Courtesy Stephanie Seber\n\nLouisville’s Black Avant-Garde: William M. Duffy @ Speed Art Museum, Louisville, Ky. | June 28-Sept. 29, 2024\n\nA collective of Black artists, the Louisville Art Workshop (LAW) was founded as a source of community and support for artists seeking to sustain their practices in a climate where galleries and museums were not receptive to showing work by Black artists. Artist and educator William M. Duffy (b. 1953) joined LAW in the 1970s, about a decade after it was established (becoming one of its youngest members). Exploring four decades of work, the exhibition features the sculptures for which Duffy is best known, along with drawings, paintings, and digital art. Duffy’s role as a leader in the local art community, who has inspired new generations of artists, is also considered. The show is the second installment of Speed Art Museum’s four-part series shedding light on important Black artists practicing in Louisville between 1950 and 1980. It follows “Louisville’s Black Avant-Garde: Robert L. Douglas,” which was on view last summer.\n\nLUCY T.
