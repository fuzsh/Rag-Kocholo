        "text": "URBANNA, Va., May 21—Brig. Gen. Robert Latane Montague, U.S.M.C., retired, much‐decorated veteran of both World Wars, died Friday at his home here. He was 75 years old.\n\nGeneral Montague, the son of a Governor of Virginia, enlisted in the Marines in 1917 and won a battlefield commission in France. In the MeuseArgonne campaign, he led a small band of soldiers in a raid on the town of St. Georges, captured several machine‐gun posts and enabled Allied forces to advance through the German defense. For “exceptional, heroism in combat,” he received both the Navy Cross and the Distinguished Service Cross.\n\nIn World War II, General Montague took part in the Marianas and Okinawa campaigns and won the Legion of Merit for his service. He was wounded in Okinawa and retired for disability in 1946, after having served in China.\n\nRan Gunston Hall\n\nIn 1949 General Montague became first superintendent of Gunston Hall, the ancestral estate of George Mason, American Revolutionary leader, after it was given to Virginia. While he was superintendent, the mansion and garden were restored. He retired from that position in 1954.\n\nHe was the son of Andrew Jackson Montague, Governor of Virginia from 1902 to 1906 and a United States Representative from 1913 to 1937. While the father was in Congress, the son served as a White House aide to Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.\n\nGeneral Montague attended the University of Virginia, L'Ecole Superieur de Guerre in Paris and the Naval War College in Newport, R. I. From 1940 until he was sent to the Pacific in 1942, he served on the faculty of the war college.\n\nSurviving are his widow, the former Frances Breckenridge Wilson; two sons, Robert L. 3d and Lieut. (jg.) Francis B., U.S.N.; two sisters, Mrs. Charles Beatty Moore and Mrs. William J. Nunnally, and two grandchildren.\n\nA funeral service will be held tomorrow at 11:30 A.M. in Christ Episcopal Church in Urbanna."
