        "text": "Hi everyone\n\nI’ve been using a Liquid Foot Midi Controller but it keeps on malfunctioning, so I’m trying to find a replacement that can do how I use it. So before buying I thought I’d ask here if it can do that - not necessarily how, but of course if someone has the time to tell me how, I already know if it’s quickly set up or not.\n\nI try to keep it short: For rehearsal I need presets to select effects on my Eventide & Rocktron rack devices, around 20, so I use a “page” with presets for direct access and bank up/down switches for going to less often used presets.\n\nThen for gigs I use “Setlist Mode” where I can make a list of songs (the setlist we play); these songs contain 1-4 presets. So a setlist, contains songs, a song contains presets.\n\nWhile playing I have set one button to switch from one song to the next, during a song I have another button to switch to the next preset within that song. So I always press the same button for the next song and the other button for the next preset. This way I never have to remember or search for a preset while playing.\n\nPlus I can see the song being played and the next song and the active preset and the next preset displayed, so I always know where I am.\n\nCan anyone tell me, if all these functions are possible on the MC6 (programmed with the App)?\n\nAny ideas, feedback etc. is appreciated, many thanks!\n\nThanks a lot guitarwolf!\n\nI played around with the demo of the software and found your suggestion with programming banks as songs combined with “bank up” (for each and every bank) one that should work. And I found a function where I can sort and move banks around, so I can quickly set the succession of songs I need for the setlist played.\n\nI found a video about the “message scroll” function, which is precisely what I need for switching presets withing songs, I think. Thanks a lot for that input.\n\nOne last question I’m uncertain about yet: On the “bank up” button display, can it preview how this bank is called? So I could see what the next song in the set will be? That must be possible, right?\n\nLike this on the left display, for example:\n\nUpper Row: Last Song Played\n\nMiddle Row: Current Song\n\nLower Row: Next Song\n\nThen the middle display the same with the presets in the current song.\n\nThen an idea just coming up: Are there like global presets which I can set to appear on every bank throughout the whole profile? So I could have the same two presets available wherever I am on the third display (buttons C & F)?\n\nThanks again for your help, highly appreciated!"
