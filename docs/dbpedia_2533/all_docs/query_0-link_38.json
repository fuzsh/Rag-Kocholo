        "text": "Thus far, not much is known about Kult Kyss. The Melbourne duo made up of producer Haxx and vocalist Rromarin only just released their first single ‘Get Up Boy’, and they’ve already been getting a huge amount of radio play and online attention as a result. Today we’ve got the pleasure of premiering their next track – a remix of The Presets’ ‘\">This Boy’s In Love’ – and cementing their place as one of Australia’s most exciting new acts.\n\nOriginally released in 2008, ‘This Boy’s In Love’ did a similar thing for the Presets, and solidified them as one of Australia’s biggest and most loved bands. For Kult Kyss to take on the task of covering it is bold, and could have been a terrible decision had they not executed it perfectly – but luckily they have.\n\nWhile the original is driven by a constantly blaring synth lead, Kult Kyss have gone about it in a much more slow and spacious manner. Rromarin’s breathy vocals alongside an oriental sounding set of strings create a much more calm beginning to say the least. Before you know it though, we’re into the chorus, and a similar sounding arpeggiated synth is driving us to move. It’s here that Haxx’s production shines, with the layering of a similar sound alongside some grinding bass lines and heavy claps sounding like the perfect reimagining of The Presets’ classic.\n\nIf this was on triple j’s Like A Version, there’s no doubt it’d be one of the best of the year with plenty of people talking about it. With two incredible releases behind them and an EP due out early next year, Kult Kyss are on their way to something big, very soon."
