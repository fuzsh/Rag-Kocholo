[I got the idea] when I saw my fan's reaction to \"Fantasize\" because they love it so much. [...] I kind of was like 'this is a very bad idea, I think', but there is a large group of my fans that really do love a bad girl anthem and this is kind of an elevated version of that. ”\n\n–Grande on the song and \"Fantasize\" to Zach Sang\n\n\"The Boy Is Mine\" (stylized in all lowercase) is the third single and eighth track on Ariana Grande's seventh studio album, Eternal Sunshine. It was released on March 8, 2024, through Republic Records. It was later released as a single on June 7, 2024, alongside a music video, and then again on June 21, 2024, with a remix version with Brandy and Monica.\n\nBackground[]\n\nOn February 17, 2024, the title and track number of the song had been made out from a blurry track-list photo that was corrected by fans, but quickly becoming widespread. On February 27, 2024, it was announced that this song would be a part of Eternal Sunshine.\n\nWhen talking about the song in her interview with Zach Sang, Grande stated, \"I think it's just like, naughty, It's the version of \"Fantasize\" on the album that they wanted to have that, you know, it's just like a sexier, naughtier one and I think it's more provocative than the rest but it's not about what you think it was about and it's also a song that I've always wanted to interpolate, is that what the kids are calling now? Yeah, I have like, many different versions of it from like, years ago but this is like not that obviously.\"\n\nThe song was teased to be the third single on Eternal Sunshine on May 7, 2024,[1] when Grande put up the \"brighter days longsleeve t-shirt\" on her web store, which features six files on the back, with the first three being named \"Yes, And?\", \"We Can't Be Friends\", and \"The Boy Is Mine\", respectively.[2]\n\nOn May 17, 2024, the @sweetener Instagram account posted a collage with lyrics from the song along with images presumably from the music video, all captioned with \"...trailer & official announcement coming soon\"[3] or \"...loading single 3\".[4]\n\nOn May 27, 2024, a teaser for the song's music video was released to Grande's social media.[5]\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the single cover was revealed through the @sweetener Instagram account[6] and the \"link to\" share link.\n\nOn July 17, 2024, a digital bundle for the song including an acapella, instrumental, remix, and acapella remix was announced, to be released two days later on July 19.[7]\n\nMusic Video[]\n\nThe song's music video, directed by Christian Breslauer,[8] was released on June 7th, 2024.\n\nThe music video opens with a garbage man being attacked by a rat (voiced by Elizabeth Gillies). Peaches (played by Grande) returns in this video, making a love potion for the mayor, Max Starling (played by Penn Badgley). TV reporters (played by Brandy and Monica) then announce that the mayor will be addressing an ongoing issue with the media, which then begins to play after. Starling discusses the city's issue with rats and how he will deal with it while Peaches admires from TV. She then begins to sing the song as she walks up to her shrine she has made for the Starling and begins to sew an outfit that resembles Catwoman. Peaches then climbs onto rooftops until she reaches Starling's apartment, sneaking inside. Dragging Starling over by her whip, Peaches attempts to feed him her love potion, but he eventually takes it away from her and throws it on the wall as he already has fallen in love with Peaches, the pink liquid forming a heart smoke with a T letter on the inside. The video ends as the ending credits roll, showing Peaches and Starling playing with their cats.\n\nLive Performances[]\n\nOn May 6, 2024 song was performed for the first time at 2024 Met Gala after party.[9]\n\nOn June 6, 2024, Grande performed the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[10]\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nThe \"The Boy Is Mine\" merchandise was unveiled on Ariana's webstore on July 27, 2024.[11] More styles were released on July 30, 2024.\n\nPhysical Releases[]\n\nRemix[]\n\n\"The Boy Is Mine (Remix)\" (stylized in all-lowercase) was released on June 21, 2024. On June 17, 2024, Grande took to Instagram to announce \"The Boy Is Mine\" remix would be released on June 21, 2024 and feature Brandy and Monica.[12]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThis song is the \"Fantasize\" remake Grande mentioned in her interview with Zach Sang, as confirmed by Zane Lowe.[13]\n\nThis was the second song recorded for the album.[13]\n\nThis song interpolates \"The Boy Is Mine\" by Brandy and Monica.[13]\n\nWhile performing the song live, she used their melodies.\n\nThe song's title is similar to the unreleased Positions song titled \"Girl Is Mine\"/\"The Girl Is Mine (Playboy)\".\n\nThis song used the same synths as in the unreleased song \"Gloss\", \"True Story\", and \"Eternal Sunshine\".\n\nThe song's background vocals are louder on Apple Music when Dolby Atmos is turned off.\n\nThis is most obvious in the line \"there's gotta be a reason why\".\n\nGrande did her own makeup for the song's music video.\n\nShe used her Essential Drip Glossy Balm, Sweetener Foundation in light 8n, Sweetener Concealer in light 4g, Hypernova satin matte bronzer in \"cocoa-nut\", Interstellar Highlighter Topper in \"miss mercury\", Midnight Shadows Eyeshadow (\"midnight snack\" and \"babydoll\" palettes), Flourishing Lengthening Mascara, Eternally Meowing Dream Lashes, \"At The Borderline\" Eyeliner Marker, \"Practically Permanent\" lip stain marker, On Your Collar Lip Gloss, and Mist Thing.\n\nNASA posted a photo to their Instagram account captioned \"The stars, they aligned 🎶\".\n\nThis is Ariana's first single to have a physical release of multiple versions.\n\nA CD release of 34+35 (Remix) was issued in 2021, but the solo version of the song never saw a solo release, making \"The Boy Is Mine\" the second remix to have a physical version. (Although Ariana's remix of \"Good As Hell\" was released as a 12\" vinyl, it was the B-side to Lizzo's solo version of the song.)\n\nLyrics[]\n\nGallery[]\n\n“deep breaths, tight chest, life, death”\n\nTo view the The Boy Is Mine gallery, click here.\n\nVideos[]\n\nTrack Listing[]\n\nThe Boy Is Mine (Remix)No.TitleLength1.\"The Boy Is Mine\" (with Brandy & Monica) (Remix)3:332.\"The Boy Is Mine\"2:53Total length:6:27\n\nThe Boy Is Mine (Bundle)No.TitleLength1.\"The Boy Is Mine\"2:532.\"The Boy Is Mine\" (a cappella)2:433.\"The Boy Is Mine\" (Instrumental)2:534.\"The Boy Is Mine\" (with Brandy & Monica) (Remix)3:335.\"The Boy Is Mine\" (with Brandy & Monica) (Remix A Capella)3:32Total length:15:36\n\nReferences[]\n\nNavigation[]"
