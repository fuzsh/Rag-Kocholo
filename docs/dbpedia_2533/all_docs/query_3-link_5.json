        "text": "In This Boy’s Life, Tobias Wolff tells the story of a youth marked by violence, transience, rejection, and abuse. As the older Wolff looks back on his formative years, he recalls how storytelling functioned for him as a means of escapism—a way to stave off the pain of his actual life by imagining other lives for himself. Throughout the text, Wolff uses the theme of storytelling and escapism to suggest that in truly abusive situations, even the most determined, fantastical methods of escapism often fall short, and sometimes even further entrap victims in dangerous relationships and circumstances.\n\nThe memoir opens with a literal escape; Toby, who has recently renamed himself Jack after Jack London (itself a way of telling a new “story” about his life), and his mother Rosemary are driving across the country in an attempt to escape her abusive ex-boyfriend, Roy, who is stalking her. Roy eventually catches up with them and worms his way back into Rosemary’s life. Wolff shows through this early anecdote how escape from truly harrowing situations is often logistically impossible. As Jack and his mother—along with Roy—start a new life in Utah, Jack begins attending catechism classes at the local Catholic church. In confession, Jack struggles with honesty; when Sister James, hoping to make Jack feel more comfortable with admitting his “sins,” shares her own childhood transgressions, Jack simply repeats these stories to the priest. They are easier than telling the truth: that he and his mother are being abused, that Roy is attempting to draw Jack into his constant surveillance of Rosemary, and that Jack, against all odds, longs for Roy’s approval. Jack tells Sister James’s stories as his own in a desperate bid to escape the truth of his own fractured youth.\n\nAfter fleeing Utah for Seattle, Jack and Rosemary find themselves on their own at last, in a new place where they are strangers to everyone. Jack makes two friends, both named Terry—he calls them by their last names, Silver and Taylor—and the boys spend their afternoons making prank calls, fantasizing about buying guns, and watching The Mickey Mouse Club. They all have raging crushes on one of the cast members, Annette, and Jack begins writing Annette fan letters in which he describes himself as a wealthy young man whose father, a sea captain, owns a fleet of fishing boats. Back in Utah, Jack had exchanged letters with a pen pal named Alice as part of a class project, and had written lengthy letters describing his life on his rich father’s ranch—Alice wrote back “terse” responses and eventually stopped responding. Now, as Jack’s letters to Annette grow bolder and more fantastical, it becomes clear that his desire to spin stories about himself is directly tied to his feelings of isolation and to the abuse and neglect he has suffered. Jack’s letters to Annette, like his letters to Alice, receive lukewarm replies, and soon whoever has been writing him back stops responding altogether. Wolff uses this anecdote to show how his early attempts at spinning fantastical stories had no impact on his ability to change his situation or even truly engage in escapism; in fact, he was left feeling more alone than ever, and as his ongoing letters to Annette turned macabre, with Jack imagining “a terrible accident in front of her house that would almost but not quite kill [him,] leaving [him] dependent on her care and sympathy,” Wolff makes it clear that the abuse and pain Jack has suffered has actually become an inextricable part of his storytelling.\n\nAfter Jack and his mother move to Concrete, Washington, with Rosemary’s new husband, Dwight—who turns out to be just as controlling and abusive as Roy—Jack’s dependency on telling stories about himself in order to survive intensifies. In Concrete, Jack’s storytelling expands outwards. By the midpoint of the text, he’s no longer telling stories about himself to himself, playing pretend with the rifle Roy gave him, or writing missives to members of The Mickey Mouse Club. Now the stories he tells become a way to connect with others, cement friendships, and paint himself as someone worthy of the love, attention, and validation he’s been denied. At this point in the narrative, it becomes clear that storytelling as a method of escapism is not something unique to Jack. The boys he meets through the Scouts and his classmates at high school in Concrete also use storytelling as a way to make themselves seem more interesting, and even as a way to deny the truth of who they are. Jack’s closest friend at school is a boy named Arthur, a “sissy” who may or may not be gay. Arthur is picked on by everyone, even Jack, who feels embarrassed about having made friends with Arthur. A large part of Jack and Arthur’s friendship centers around telling each other wildly outlandish stories about themselves, their families, and their heritages. They are each other’s “perfect witness,” enthusiastically believing every word the other says, and what the boys have most profoundly in common is the belief that the true lie is “told by [their] present unworthy circumstances,” not the stories they spin to one another.\n\nTowards the end of the story, it seems as if all of Jack’s practice at storytelling as a way of escaping his present circumstances will actually pay off; with Arthur’s help, he writes his own letters of recommendation in support of his application to the prestigious Hill School in Pennsylvania, and is admitted. He goes off to school, leaving Washington and all his painful memories behind him. However, after three years, Jack—who now goes by Tobias—is expelled. After briefly detailing his expulsion and subsequent enrollment in the armed forces, Wolff, in the final paragraphs of his memoir, travels back in time to the end of a road trip with his friend Chuck, to and from Seattle. Tobias—still Jack, then—had just been admitted to Hill and had just escaped, with his mother, from Dwight’s house, and everything seemed full of hope for the first time of his life. Wolff’s willful retreat into a memory is a metatextual comment on the ways storytelling and escapism function. To end the memoir on a note of failure would be too painful; to arrive at his ending, Wolff engages in one final feat of escapism, retreating into a story that’s easier to tell."
