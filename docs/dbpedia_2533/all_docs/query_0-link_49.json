        "text": "Chapter 1\n\nAre You The One?\n\nThe Presets' story begins a long way from the sweaty dancefloors that may come to mind when thinking about the country's preeminent electro house duo.\n\n“We both were studying classical music at the Sydney Conservatorium around 1995,” Kim Moyes begins. “We became friends in the common room, because we didn't really have that many classes together.\n\nWe bonded over a love of weird and wild music.\n\nJulian Hamilton - Double J, 2018\n\n“Both of us would rock up to school with big old headphones on and little Walkmans with cassettes in them, listening to all sorts of albums or radio shows we had taped onto cassette.”\n\nBut it wasn't necessarily the classical music that brought them together. It was their shared passion for anything that skirted the boundaries of normality.\n\n“We bonded over a love of weird and wild music,” Julian Hamilton recalls.\n\n“We'd go out to nightclubs on Wednesday nights and party on. One day I found an old synthesizer under my Dad's bed. Kim asked me to join his band, which was called Prop. That's where it all started.”\n\n“Cut to 20 years later and here we are,” Moyes adds. “Still really obsessed with that sound that your Dad's synth makes.”\n\nThe Sydney scene at the time was reflective of the great change that was happening in the realms of alternative music. For the first time, electronic music and guitar music intermingled on the precipice of the mainstream.\n\nBut Moyes and Hamilton were drawn to some of the weirder sounds and characters at first.\n\n“We'd go to clubs like Warm Up on Wednesday nights, it's now called The Good Bar, it used to be called Mr Good Bar; it was a really wonderful club,” Moyes remembers.\n\n“Before it was Warm Up it was called Clan Analogue. It was a wonderful night, run by this collective of techno hippies. You'd be able to go down there and see these producers and duos setting up 15 synths and drum machines all linked up via MIDI and jamming.\n\n“There used to be this really colourful character called Dr Rod who was sitting there serving chai tea and space cakes. Also at this time was the beginning of a renowned Sydney institution called Club Kooky.”\n\n“A couple of friends of ours, Johnny and Gemma, ran this really wild, crazy night,” Hamilton recalls of the Kooky days.\n\nFor us, there was no difference between liking Björk as much as we liked John Williams\n\nKim Moyes - Double J, 2018\n\n“It was at some of these nights back in 95 or 96 that we'd be discovering new bands like the Chemical Brothers and Daft Punk, all these new electronic, beaty, breaky, rocky dance tracks.\n\n\"We'd hear them during the day time on local independent radio and then at night time we'd hear them in these clubs.”\n\n“There was a DJ called Abel el'toro, he would play Beastie Boys mixed into Rage Against the Machine mixed into Chemical Brothers,” Moyes recalls.\n\n“I think, up until that point, you either liked indie music, rock music or dance music. For the first time ever, we were exposed to that idea where it was more about the energies combining and less about the styles.”\n\nFor The Presets, this broad appreciation went further than what was on the radio. They were able to reconcile their love for the art music they were studying with\n\n“I think, when we were at university, we weren't really into classical music as such, even though that was what we were studying every day.” Hamilton considers. “We were just into radical music, interesting music.\n\n“J.S. Bach was making music hundreds of years ago, but the music he made at the time was wild. The same with the more contemporary classical composers that we really got into like Xenakis and Stockhausen and Steve Reich and all those kinds of different guys - their music was really radical and different.\n\n“The same thing with pop music; when we heard Goldie and drum'n'bass or jungle music, or a hip hop track, or Chemical Brothers - it was just new and interesting and fresh. We were just fans of music; the classical training and the discipline was just a means to get there.”\n\n“For us, there was no difference between liking Björk as much as we liked John Williams and the Star Wars soundtrack,” Moyes adds. “Or Phillip Glass, or Gilbert &amp; Sullivan.”\n\nChapter 2\n\nTools Down\n\n‘My People' (Apocalypso, 2008)\n\n“‘My People' went through many different incarnations as we worked on it,” Hamilton says. “There were some faster versions and some slower versions. It had some really bad chorus ideas.\n\n“The very early sketches of it start with this bassline and me singing, 'I'm here with all of my people' and then that never came back for the rest of the song. It went to this other stupid chorus later on. I only realise this because I found this old version the other day and I was listening to it.\n\n“Somewhere along the line we decided the ‘My People' bit was actually kinda cool and we should probably just make that the chorus. It worked out well.”\n\nIn the end, sure. But as the band were putting the finishing touches on Apocalypso, there were a few naysayers who weren't so sure about the merits of what would become the band's biggest ever single.\n\n“A lot of people we were working with didn't think that much of ‘My People', they thought it was a bit hard,” Hamilton says. “Everyone sort of had their money banked on ‘This Boy's in Love'. They were putting all their money into getting ‘This Boy's in Love' mixed and that was going to be the one they were really gonna push.\n\n“But we had a few believers in our camp thinking 'No, 'My People' could be really big, It's like The Prodigy. It could be this really successful song.'\n\n“We were mixing ‘My People' with a friend of ours and it wasn't quite working the way we had hoped. So, at the last minute, I said, 'Hey, do you think we could send 'My People' to this gun LA mix engineer who's gonna mix the other couple of singles?' Thankfully we sent it off that night and this guy sent the mix off and I remember the next day listening to it on the headphones thinking, 'Holy shit. This song is going to be amazing'.\n\n“It's funny when you're making these songs, it's like you're flying this crippled plane and you're hoping you're going to be able to land it. It's veering from side to side and sometimes you actually land the plane at the end, you get off safe and you've got a good song.\n\n“Sometimes you've got to throw a few passengers out the window as well,” Moyes adds. “A bit of cargo... Lose half the plane.”\n\n“Sometimes you have to crash the plane,” Hamilton says.\n\n‘This Boy's In Love' (Apocalypso, 2008)\n\n“I kind of spooked myself the other day,” Hamilton says. “I stumbled across an old folder of 'This Boy's in Love' and there's old versions of the song that didn't make it.\n\n“There's about three or four in a row where the chorus had this big melody and this big vocal and it was awful. It was like I was trying to sound like Interpol or something. It was just horrendous.\n\n“In the background there's this falsetto line, and at some point, I must have thought 'Hang on, all these melodies are shit. That line in the background, that's the chorus.'\n\n“All the crap versions of that song ended up being a not so crap version.”\n\n‘Worms' (Beams, 2005)\n\n“Worms was something that we made in my kitchen in Annandale when we first started The Presets,” Moyes says. “We just threw a bunch of ideas around and most of that stuff was the material that came to be [2003 debut EP] Blow Up and the material that got us a record deal.\n\n“There was this one little oddball called 'Worms' that was kind of like a hip hop track. I can sorta see why it didn't make it onto Blow Up.\n\n“This was before Julian was even singing, we were still completely trying to figure out what we were doing. Early on I think we were gonna go down the typical dance music route of just being producers who get other vocalists to sing on our songs.\n\n“We had this hip hop beat and Jules dialled up some crazy sound on one of his synths and played the melody with this sound that's almost like a robot choking on a Mintie. I always thought it was a really great track, because it perfectly encapsulated what we were all about. It was really digestible. It was sort of a pop song format. But it was totally bent and abstract.”\n\n‘If I Know You' (Apocalypso, 2008)\n\n“When we first started writing Apocalypso, we decided to take a couple of weeks away and went up to Bangalow,” Moyes says.\n\n“We rented out a friend's house and set up all our gear up there and got away from all the distractions of Sydney and started jamming and working on ideas.\n\n“I think that the core idea of the first incarnation of ‘If I Know You' came from those sessions. When we started to finish the first batch of songs, I think it was one of the first songs we finished.\n\n“We went for this big, epic, French house kind of thing. Somewhere like Alan Braxe meets the Pet Shop Boys. Perfectly on trend for us. But, once we exorcised that demon and lived with it for a while, and started to make a few more rocking tracks, we realised this guy was a bit of an oddball.\n\n“Towards the very end of the session we ended up ripping the guts out of it and went for something a lot more traditionally electro-pop, which is what it ended up being on the album version.\n\n“The vocal that Julian sings on the album version was sung to this really storming French house number. It doesn't not work, but I know Julian has found it hard to listen to.”\n\n‘Feel Alone' (HI VIZ, 2018)\n\n“‘Feel Alone' started off as this really aggressive tech house thing, which was a really great aggressive beat,” Moyes says.\n\n“We'd really focused on what we wanted the energy of this album to be. We wanted it to be really up for it, we wanted it to be party. So, we were just making beats that were really hyperactive and noisy.\n\n“They kind of wear a little bit thin after a while. They're not meant to be laboured on, they come out real quick. This one transformed into a really almost generic house song, like from the mid-90s. We both knew it wasn't gonna cut it, even though it always retained something really loveable about it.\n\n“We'd finished the bulk of the album but felt like there was something missing. Something quintessentially Presets missing. We didn't want to do a sad song, but we wanted something that had a little bit of the 'Girl and the Sea' kind of melancholy to it.\n\n“So, we ended up stripping apart this initial idea. The working title for it was ‘Tinder Cave', which is probably one of the best working titles we've ever had.\n\n“Julian had another song called 'Feel Alone', which was also suffering from the same kind of thing. It was a really great vocal and a really good idea, but it just sounded like generic house music that was destined to be on an underwear commercial.”\n\n“Like most of my ideas,” Hamilton quips.\n\n“Just way too Bondi for us,” Moyes adds. “So, we ended up going, 'Alright, these songs have sort of got something in common' ripped them apart, put them together, took out the worst bits, put in some really good bits and it was the final track we finished for HI VIZ.”"
