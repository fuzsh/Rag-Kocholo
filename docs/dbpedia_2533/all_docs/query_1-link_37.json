        "text": "I don’t really use snapshots per se so I can’t really help you on that. I know there are some plugins where using the plugins preset mapping is necessary, but I’ve yet to run into that. Is there a reason why you really want to use the plugins snapshots? As mentioned before most of us use rack states not presets, because it’s faster, it’s a much more efficient workflow, and it’s very easy to organize it however you like.\n\nYou want to check the right check box for selected program on song state behavior. That means that you can create different songs states each using different rack states, so by checking the box you are saying you want each song state to call up whichever rack state you have selected. I guess selected program would be better called selected rack state.\n\nTry reading up in the guide on rack states and song states. And then read up on exported State, which is completely different than using rack states, and allows you to override the rack state settings just for the song you’re working on.\n\nRack and song states are different but operate pretty much the same. Once you wrap your head around that it gets a lot easier. I’ll try to explain how I and many others use it, but cantabile is so flexible there are always other ways to accomplish the same thing.\n\nI’ve found it’s easiest for me to put each plugin instrument into its own linked rack. For example, I have a sample player rack with two instances of the free sforzando plugin (I used two because quite often it’s a faster switch to have one loaded with my first sound, another with my second sound, and then just muting or unmuting the active routes I want. Routes typically change faster than a new sample sound, particularly with sample players, but that’s a whole other topic). But I also have another rack with two Synth one plugins, another rack for guitar amp sim, another rack with all my effects like reverb, compression, EQ, etc. So think of a rack like a module and inside that module you have a bunch of presets you created.\n\nSo as we add new songs and need new sounds or parameters we just add more rack States. So the rack states are the presets for that particular rack. Here’s how to get started.\n\nCreate a linked rack And then add your VST plug-in… For example let’s say it’s a sample player with strings. Double click on the rack to open it and at the top select routing, not bindings. On the left panel select States. So now you’re in rack States. Add a new state and name it… For this example let’s call it state 1. Set the pluginto what you want for your \" preset\"… Set to strings, and get it the way you want it. Lock it and save all. Add another state and call it state 2. Under state behaviors check every box on the right column until you get down to undefined parameters. Those check boxes are defining what will be saved with ALL the rack states, for that entire rack, regardless of what song you use that rack on. If there’s a parameter you don’t want saved with that state for some reason, which would be rare I think, just un check it. Of course you could change the saved behaviors at any time. On the far right lock each of them. Save all.\n\nNow go into state two, unlock it, and change the sample to something else… For example piano. Lock it and save all. Now, when you change from rack state one to rack state two, it should change from strings to piano. Then start playing around with other parameters…Try changing a parameter in state two that’s different from state one, lock it and switch the states while watching what happens to the plugin. If the parameter doesn’t change then check your state behaviors.\n\nKeep adding more rack states if you want. So essentially, in this rack/module, it’s kind of like you’re building patches on a synth, each rack state is one sound/patch. Here’s where the beauty of this approach pays off:\n\nNow I’m going to build a song. The verse has a strings sound and the chorus is piano. I create a SONG state one, to the right of my sampler rack I click and now I see all my rack states/presets. I choose the strings rack state I had created earlier. Great that’s done, now create another song state, click on the rack and choose piano. Now I go to song state one, right click and create a clone. I call that verse 2. Now I go to song state 2, and create another clone of that. I drag and drop verse two and chorus 2 to the correct places. I’m done, I just created a song in about 30 seconds. The other advantage to this approach is that when I created my rack states, I made sure that all my volumes and EQ for each state were pretty much the same. Now, regardless of whatever song I put those in, my volume for my strings rack State will be the same. You can always modify that in the song state mode on the rack itself, on a per song basis.\n\nIt’s kind of hard to explain, but I hope this helps!"
