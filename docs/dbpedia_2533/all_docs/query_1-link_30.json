Wouldn’t it be great to have a series of presets, for example’ 78 Brown, High Voltage, Gibbons Eliminator… etc\n\nCould be reviewed by users, and discussions on how to improve each preset.\n\nThis would open up the QC and help to demystify its advanced features.\n\nCould be integrated with the Cloud!\n\nEspecially for geezers who bought the unit to replace an amp and are not au fait with tech!\n\nMake this a feature request. I’ll vote"
