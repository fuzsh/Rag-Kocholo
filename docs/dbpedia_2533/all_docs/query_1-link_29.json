        "text": "Just watched Cooper's video on the setlist feature....not sure I understand why I would want to use it. Realistically, (as he points out) I can just arrange my songs in the editor as normal, and continue to use the OFMG9 layout and just advance the songs up using the Preset function.\n\nCooper was excited by the feature and explained why but I’ll take a whack at it…\n\nA typical preset contains multiple scenes, but to get from one scene in one preset to another scene in another preset typically takes multiple switch presses. The Setlist feature lets us grab scenes from inside the presets and use them as sections of a song, and switch to them with a single switch press. It’s an extension of the preset/scene paradigm only it becomes “song/song-sections”.\n\nRearranging your songs/presets in the editor is certainly one way to do it. Still, it lacks the granularity and flexibility, because, what if you want the crunch sound of scene 3 from one preset to follow the clean in scene 8 from another preset? You either redefine the default scenes and switch between the presets, change presets then scenes manually, or copy one preset and manually add the needed scene … or build a song in the Setlist and grab the scenes in the order needed, and then step forward and backward with a single switch press.\n\nRearranging songs is similar to rearranging presets, you can drag and drop them, but doesn’t require moving presets in slots. If the preset order changes, simply move the song and let the modeler handle the heavy lifting. We can export/import setlists to disk and reuse them easily. It’s possible to even import the saved files into a spreadsheet or database, query or manipulate them, then reexport them and pull them back into the editor because they’re XML files.\n\nNot everyone has a use for it, but it’s powerful and flexible, and SO many people requested that Fractal reintroduce it, that they did, only they made it more flexible.\n\nI am not sure I would want to go through all this work and then, change the custom layout, etc. For example, what layout slot would I add the NEW custom setlist one in, if I were to do so? I don't want to mess with anything that is already there. That means I would need to export all layouts before committing, etc....\n\nNo, there’s already a Setlist layout that makes it easy to move between songs and sections.\n\nAlso, what would the workflow be after a gig? I don't want to use this anymore, so on the unit I would then need to factory restore the OFMG9 layout?\n\nThe workflow? Use your layouts like normal.\n\nIt’s available as a single layout if you want to add it, or you can add two switches to a layout to scroll forwards and backward through songs and scenes, or an additional one if you need setlists too. The beauty of Fractal’s layout manager is you can easily adjust things to fit your needs.\n\nYou really need to read the mini-manual for Setlists and work with them for an hour or two with the associated layout as it sounds like you are trying to pick apart something without having worked with it. When they introduced it I wasn’t sure what to think of it, because I tend to use a preset like a single-channel amp with a small pedalboard, but, I like it after digging in and experimenting with it. As I said, I don’t use it and not everyone needs the feature, but it’s really slick, and it has been well-received by people who need it.\n\nCooper was excited by the feature and explained why but I’ll take a whack at it…\n\nA typical preset contains multiple scenes, but to get from one scene in one preset to another scene in another preset typically takes multiple switch presses.

Count me into the group who would never build a 'song patch' around potentially 5-6 different presets altogether - that seems wild to me! But I can see how it may make sense to some. Generally, I build a preset to be a specific song–I have to think that is likely the norm for many players as well.\n\nCount me into the group who would never build a 'song patch' around potentially 5-6 different presets altogether - that seems wild to me! But I can see how it may make sense to some.\n\nConsider the people who are working a casino in Las Vegas, doing set after set, with few repetitions, then the next night having a different setlist at a wedding, the next at a corporate gig with a different setlist. They needed a way to easily create the lists and manipulate them because they might have hundreds of songs/presets in their repertoire.\n\nInstead of treating a preset as a song, it could become a library of scenes of a particular pedal board and the associated amp's sounds. Where in the past a preset with scenes was the only way to build up a song, they can grab scenes/sounds and combine them into songs from their library and build up an entire hour's setlist, then another, and another, then easily move the songs to a different order, or to different sets, or rearrange sets. Whereas we tend to focus on presets and scenes, the Setlists/Songs is another layer above that, adding even more flexibility.\n\nAs Admin M@ said, they're in a different world than most of us, but Fractal is building gear for the professionals, so they try to help solve the problems that affect those players in addition to adding the stuff the \"average Joe\" wants.\n\nIs the song/setlist layout global, including the added per-preset switches? I always have a different number of song sections and would like to use the remaining free switches to turn effects on and off.\n\ni.e. I have per preset switches in different places each time. Somehow I'm always in a mess, although I actually programmed everything correctly in the song/setlist editor. Does that work out for you?\n\nWhenever we define Per-Preset Overrides, the very first step is assigning a particular block to a particular ID, such as PP#1. If they are not appearing in the order you expect, it’s because you didn’t define them in a consistent order across your presets.\n\nIt’s probably useful to experiment with the Per-Preset layout that is defined as a default-factory layout. Change to it, note the defined blocks displayed in the mini-scribble strips, then switch to a different preset, and if the order changes then you know that is the problem. The Per-Preset layout didn’t change because it’s a global template where the PP# assignments are displayed, but their assignment order changed.\n\nI don’t use the “Effects” layout, instead I assign Per-Preset switches and use their associated layout, and consistently assign from left to right across the grid, so PP#1 is always the compressor block, PP#2 is always the drive, etc. I don’t assign every block, only the ones that would be optional for the sound of that particular preset, the ones that are required, like a chorus, or reverb, and that I wouldn’t turn off, remain undefined.\n\nIt’s all about thinking how you want to interact with your presets, playing through the rig for a while, and, as you do it, observing the things that you do to adjust the sound, then programming the layout and assigning the Per-Presets accordingly. There’ll be some trial and error but the results are worth it."
