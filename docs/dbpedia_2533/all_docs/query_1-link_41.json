You can send MIDI messages upon entering a bank. We demonstrate and explain how in this video:\n\nThe messages you need to send for controlling BPM are explained in this video:\n\nTo bank up/down using switches F and C, just select the Bank Up/Down message types. To copy and paste to all banks, just copy the preset and triple click Paste on the editor.\n\nThis intro to MIDI video will also be useful to you:\n\nThank you for replying.\n\nI decided to just dig in and start learning on the fly.\n\nSo far I have things going pretty well.\n\nI don’t know exactly what this means from the wampler terraform:\n\nMIDI BYPASS: To assign “bypass” to a MIDI program change, press\n\nand hold the preset switch (as if you were saving a preset). Press\n\nthe preset switch until all four preset LEDs blink simultaneously.\n\nSend a MIDI program change to the TERRAFORM. Press and hold\n\nthe preset switch to assign “bypass” to that MIDI program change\n\nnumber. This does not affect any of the saved presets; it only links\n\nthe program change and bypassing the TERRAFORM. Sending that\n\nprogram change number will now bypass the Terraform.\n\nShould i just assign like PC127 to a switch just to set an “off” button\n\nThen would I use toggle? send PCX for on and PC127 for off?\n\nNo, a PC (Program Change) always goes with a single number. PC’s are commonly used to select a patch or bank on a device. PC# 0 = Patch1; PC# 1 = Patch2…\n\nThis is why my first guess would be, that you just have to set up your device to recieve a PC# of your choice and it will toggle bypass every time you send that exact PC#.\n\nNote that this isn’t a common way to do this, in my experience on most other devices you would have to work with CC#"
