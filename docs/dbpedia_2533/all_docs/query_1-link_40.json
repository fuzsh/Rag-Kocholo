        "text": "I'm trying to make a practical setup for live stuff, one-man band sorta deal.\n\nDrums, bass, pads, synths, keys etc all through Loopy Pro.. same with my acoustic guitar + mic.\n\nI'm setting it up so everything works how I want, but it just entered my mind, what happens when I change songs?\n\nNobody will want to wait around while I fumble through a variety of synth apps or whatever and presets etc..\n\nHow are you guys going about quick song changes?\n\nDo I create a whole new Loopy Pro template for each different song? Will it remember the presets for the apps that are in it?\n\nI understand these threads are annoying but I do have to ask them and think these things out before I can really take a venues money for the gigs. I'm already an actively gigging musician (solo acoustic - no loops, no pedals.. just voice and a guitar), and I will be taking the iPad and LP to gigs.\n\nNot every song warrants the same exact sounds though.\n\nFor some reason, it feels weird to approach it the same way as an acoustic guitar.. with that, I've got no problem playing the same guitar for 4hrs straight and singing.\n\nBut with drums, bass, synths, keys etc.. I don't want to always be using the same sounds, and I also don't want to be wasting time looking through them either.\n\nPerhaps an option is to just have some buttons set up in LP for quick switches to different types of pads or leads.. so I could maybe have 2-3 choices per instrument, that I switch between at will at gigs.."
