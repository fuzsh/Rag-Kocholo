        "text": "ScHoolboy Q comes through with his first album in five years.\n\nOn Friday, March 1, the California native delivered his sixth studio LP Blue Lips via Top Dawg Entertainment. His album comes with 18 fresh tracks including previously released singles like \"Yeern 101\" and \"Blueslides.\" It also features several brand-new collaborations with Ab-Soul, Freddie Gibbs, Rico Nasty, Jozzy, Childish Major, AzChike, Devin Malik and Lance Skiiwalker. Q recruited esteemed beatmakers like The Alchemist, Kal Banx, Cardo and others to throw down on the project. ScHoolboy Q celebrated the release of his new album performing one of his stand-out tracks \"oHio\" on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.\"\n\n\"I LOVE YALL MAN. THANK YOU üôè BLUE LIPS EVERYWHERE,\" Q posted to X/Twitter after the album dropped.\n\nScHoolboy Q sets the tone for his most soulful album yet with his guitar-laced intro \"Funny Guy\" followed by his punk-rock collaboration with Rico Nasty \"Pop.\" After he pays homage to himself on \"THank god 4 me,\" Q continues with other unique tracks like \"Love Birds\" and \"Movie.\" The second half of the album hits the hardest with incredible tracks like \"oHio\" featuring Freddie Gibbs, \"Foux\" with Ab-Soul and The Alchemist-produced \"Lost Times.\"\n\nBlue Lips arrives five years after his previous album CrasH Talk. He announced the album at the top of February and revealed the tracklist without the features. Afterward, he released \"Yeern 101\" and previewed other tracks like \"Blueslides\" and \"Back n Love\" with Devin Malik.\n\nListen to ScHoolboy Q's new album below.\n\nWARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE"
