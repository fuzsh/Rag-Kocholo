        "text": "Diddy’s first solo album in 17 years, “The Love Album: Off the Grid,” is here and is loaded with features from across the R&B spectrum: from fresh faces like Jazmine Sullivan and Coco Jones to superstars like Justin Bieber and the Weeknd, along with R&B veterans like Mary J. Blige, K-Ci and Babyface.\n\nThe 23-song record arrives under Diddy’s Love Records imprint and is his first solo studio LP since 2006’s “Press Play” (not counting Diddy Dirty Money, which was more of a group effort). Still, no Diddy album has ever truly been a “solo” mission. This one boasts a long list of stars, also including features from H.E.R, Summer Walker, John Legend, Teyana Taylor, French Montana, Fabolous The-Dream, Busta Rhymes, Dawn Richard, Kalenna, Ty Dolla $ign, Jacquees, Kehlani, 21 Savage, Swae Lee, Jeremih, Jozzy, Nova Wav, Kalan Fr.Fr and Nija.\n\nDiddy’s duality as both artist and producer shines on “The Love Album,” which comes just as he won the 2023 Global Icon award at the MTV VMAs earlier this week. It also follows his decision to return the publishing rights that he owns on songs from his 1990s powerhouse label Bad Boy, which celebrates 30 years this year.\n\n“Music is my first love and music has given me a second chance at life, so stepping back into the studio to make this album has been a soulful experience that brought me closer to myself and my purpose,” said Diddy in a press release. ”This album wasn’t created to feed an algorithm or be relevant with the trends of the times, it was created to touch souls and freely express my story with the best artists, writers and producers shaping the future of R&B.”\n\nBelow, Variety breaks down all of the performing artists on the tracklist that makes up Diddy’s return: “The Love Album.”"
