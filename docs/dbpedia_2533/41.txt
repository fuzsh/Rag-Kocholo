Australia’s premiere synth-prog outfit VOYAGER have played to their strengths and have covered the Australian Modern Classic ‘This Boy’s in Love’, originally by Electronic duo The Presets. Fusing together VOYAGER’s signature Epic Electro Progressive Power Prog Metal with a huge pop song, the VSets version is sure to be a hit. The video can be viewed HERE.

The band comments on the cover: “The Presets song is one of those songs that I heard and thought “I wish I’d written this”. At the time it came out it was so fresh in Australia, and so bizarre that it became so popular because it’s really very much Euro Style Dark Synthie EBM. Given that a lot of Voyager songs start out as electronic ideas, this semi-obscure modern Australian classic was a no brainer to cover. We hope you enjoy!”
