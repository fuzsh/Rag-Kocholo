        "text": "3. PROCESS AND PROCEEDINGS: OVERVIEW\n\n3.1. Criminal Procedure\n\nPreparatory proceedings can be conducted in two forms: an investigation or an inquiry. Investigation is carried out in all cases of indictable offences, i.e. prohibited acts punishable by imprisonment for at least three years or more. Also some summary offences (prohibited acts punishable by a fine higher than 30 times the daily rate, the restriction of liberty or imprisonment exceeding one month) are to be examined in the investigation. Remaining offences are examined in an inquiry, but a public prosecutor may decide that a particular case must take the form of the investigation instead of the inquiry due to the particular importance or complexity of the case.\n\nThe investigation is conducted by a public prosecutor. S/he may yet entrust to the police or other similar agency authorized by law (Border Guard, Internal Security Agency, National Tax administration, Central Anti-Corruption Bureau or Military Gendarmerie) the entire investigation or its parts. Even if the proceedings are designated to the police, they are not allowed to carry out activities related to the presentation of charges, modification and supplementation of the decision on the presentation of charges and closing of the investigation.\n\nIn principle, the investigation should be closed within three months, and the inquiry – within two months. The investigation may be prolonged “in justified cases” by the public prosecutor supervising the investigation or his/her direct superior, for no longer than a year. In “particularly justified cases”, a public prosecutor superior to the public prosecutor supervising or conducting the investigation may extend the investigation for a further definite term. The inquiry may be extended for up to three months by the public prosecutor, and “in particularly justified cases” for further specified term. Despite the wording, in practice such prolongation is granted in most cases.\n\nA suspected person may be arrested within preparatory proceedings – or even before their initiation – in principle by the police. This competence should only be used if there are justified grounds to suspect that a given person committed an offence and it is feared that s/he might escape, go into hiding, conceal traces, if his/her identity cannot be established and if the conditions are fulfilled to order accelerated procedure. In 2010 an additional ground was added, enabling the police to arrest a person suspected of using violence against a household member, when it is feared that such an offence may be repeated. In such cases it is obligatory for the police to arrest a suspected person when a dangerous item, such as a gun or a knife, has been used.\n\nThe arrest may be questioned by an interlocutory appeal. The arrestee may demand that the grounds, legality and propriety of the arrest be examined.\n\nThe Code of Criminal Procedure determines that the arrestee has to be surrendered to the jurisdiction of the court with a motion to order detention on remand within 48 hours or be released. Then, the court has 24 hours to deliver to the arrestee a decision upon a detention on remand. A person must not be arrested for a second time after his or her release on the basis of the same facts and evidence.\n\nFor the detention on remand to be ordered, the so called general and special conditions must be met. General grounds concern the probability that a particular person has committed an offence – the detention on remand may only be ordered if, according to the evidence already collected, it is highly probable that that the suspect committed an offence. Moreover, such a decision has to be substantiated by the necessity to ensure the correct course of proceedings and, exceptionally, to prevent the accused from committing a new serious offence.\n\nSpecific conditions require that there is a justified concern that the accused might escape or go into hiding, might try to unlawfully obstruct the proceedings, might commit an offence against life, health or public security. A suspicion of the possibility to obstruct the correct course of proceedings may be substantiated by the severity of the punishment provided for a given offence, i.e. minimum eight years of the imprisonment. As too automatic a tool, the latter has been contested by entities established for protection of human rights, such as the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights[1].\n\nEven if these conditions are met, in principle detention on remand may not be ordered if it would entail a serious danger to the life or health of the suspect or exceptional hardship for the accused or his closest family.\n\nThe detention on remand in preparatory proceedings may be decided only by the court, for the maximum of three months. It may be prolonged for a period not exceeding twelve months by a court of first instance. Appellate court may extend the detention if it finds that such a need arises in connection with the suspension of criminal proceedings, actions aimed at establishing or confirming the identity of the accused, the performance of evidentiary procedures in a particularly complicated case or abroad, or if the accused intentionally protracts the proceedings.\n\nAccording to the statistical data published by the Prison Guard, from 2009 till 2015 the number of detained persons was falling. Since 2015, however, this trend has been reversed and the number of detainees is gradually increasing beyond the increases in the number of new criminal cases. As of 2019, 8356 persons were in detention (on the average)[2]. In 2018, the prosecutor requested detention in 19655 cases, and 90,46% of requests were granted. In 12189 cases (94,9% of requests) the detention was extended over statutory limits. 3,73% of decisions were successfully impaired in interlocutory proceedings before regional courts[3].\n\nAs a rule, an indictment is submitted to the court by the public prosecutor. S/he either prepares it on his/her own in the investigation, or approves the one drawn up by the Police. The public prosecutor may allow that particular entities, enlisted in an act of the Minister of Justice, to submit an indictment on their own, without public prosecutor’s interference.\n\nAn aggrieved party may initiate judicial proceedings only if certain conditions are met. It is possible when the public prosecutor refuses to instigate preparatory proceedings or discontinues the proceedings, the victim’s appeal to that decision is approved by the court – and then the public prosecutor again refuses to instigate preparatory proceedings or discontinues the proceedings. From 2019, an aggrieved party is then obliged to appeal to the superior public prosecutor. If his/her decision is to the negative, an aggrieved party may submit his/her own indictment to the court.\n\nIn some criminal offences, like slander or insult, judicial proceedings are in principle initiated only by a victim. Still the public prosecutor may submit an indictment when s/he finds that it is necessary due to a public interest.\n\nChart 04. Preparatory proceedings\n\nIn judicial proceedings, an accused may continue to be detained on remand, the grounds for which remain the same as in the preparatory proceedings. When the time limits are considered, the total period of detention on remand until the first judgment is issued by the court of first instance may not exceed two years. It may, nevertheless, be extended by the appellate court.\n\nA special judicial procedure concerns situations in which a penal order may be issued in a hearing without the participation of the parties. When a case was conducted in the form of the inquiry, the court may decide that the trial is unnecessary if in view of gathered evidence, circumstances of the criminal act and the guilt of the accused do not justify doubt. The court may then sentence the accused only to a penalty of restriction of liberty or to a fine. Both the accused and the public prosecutor may file an objection. In the consequence of which the penal order becomes invalid and the case is examined on general principles.\n\nDe iure, several principles are established which ought to guarantee the fair trial and equality of arms. However, the later amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure strengthen the position of the public prosecutor, not only in relation to the suspect or the accused, but also to the court. As a result, in particular cases a possibility arises that the rights of the suspect or the accused may not be duly respected.\n\nNo time limits for the judicial proceedings have been established. The ECHR has found the prolongation of the criminal proceedings a systematic problem of the Polish justice system[4]. The broad scope of utilisation of detention on remand has also been criticized. In some publicized cases the delays in criminal proceedings have been used as a part of the prosecutor’s office tactic to obtain evidence from the detainee in exchange for release before trial.\n\nChart 05. Judicial proceedings\n\n3.2. Civil Procedure\n\nBasic civil procedure of first instance is common for civil, business, labour and family cases. It consists of filing the statement of claims with the court, presenting evidence, conducting hearings and passing the verdict. Theoretically, it is possible that the verdict is passed at first hearing. Once the verdict is passed, the plaintiff must obtain an enforcement clause from the court to be able to refer the case to a bailiff. Additional elements in the procedure may include preparatory meetings, settlement attempts, opt-in mediation and court-ordered mediation.\n\nIn October 2019 preparatory meetings became semi-obligatory. In their course a plan of proceedings should be drafted and the main hearing may be avoided if parties decide to settle. Unsystematic evidence indicates however, that courts prefer to avoid preparatory meetings in an attempt to save time based on their typically negative evaluation of settlement chances and other potential advantages of a preparatory meeting.\n\nIn urgent matters an injunction is possible at any stage of proceedings, including before the first hearing and after the verdict is passed. In order to obtain an injunction order, the party must substantiate its claims and demonstrate a legal interest that needs to be defended.\n\nTwo types of simplified writ of payment procedures may be used for non-contested pecuniary obligations. In such cases the court may pass a payment order without a public hearing which allows the creditor to quickly collect the amounts due (with the use of a bailiff). The option is widely used in business-to-business disputes and those involving mass service providers and consumers.\n\nTo increase efficiency of the simplified procedure an online court has been created, which accepts statements of claims in the electronic mode only and may issue the payment order bypassing the evidence collection phase. In case of an objection from the defendant, the case is forwarded to a regular court (objections are exempt from court fees). Whilst the number of cases resolved in the electronic mode well exceeds 2 million per year, some objections are raised about the ability of pro se defendants to effectively submit objections, particularly given short time limits. Anecdotal evidence exists of cases where the procedure has been abused to obtain orders of payments for non-existent obligations.\n\nChart 06. Basic civil procedure of first instance\n\nThe position of a judge in the civil procedure in Poland has traditionally been strong. Not only does s/he organize the proceedings and preside during hearings, but also proactively gathers evidence, disciplines attorneys and provides some guidance to pro se litigants. Except for the latter role, judges in Poland typically act in a fairly authoritative fashion, sanctioning excessive and untimely motions of the parties and limiting oral argument in an attempt to be as time-effective as possible. As a result, important communication during trial occurs mostly in writing.\n\nAs far as guiding pro se litigants is concerned, the scope of judges’ duties is explicitly stipulated in the code of civil procedure, indicating the situations when the party should be instructed. Judges rarely go beyond such obligations due to the fears that so doing might be seen as not impartial. Empirical evidence suggests that even when attempts of making the procedure more adversarial are undertaken, imposing more information duties on judges and prohibiting them taking a proactive role in other aspects of the hearings, the courts continue to maintain the strong position. This is mostly due to conservative expectations of the participants and because of pressing time constraints[5].\n\nTwo mechanisms of encouraging settlement in civil procedure exist: court-ordered mediation and settlement attempts. The former is discussed in the next section. The latter may be undertaken privately by the parties or take the form of a settlement conference. Private settlement attempts may take place before the statement of claims is filed, but a settlement agreement may be considered inadmissible by a court if it contravenes or circumvents the law or the principles of social conduct. Court settlements may be reached at any time of proceedings.\n\nSettlement conferences are semi-compulsory. They are organized on demand of a party before the first hearing. Failure to participate in a conference has no impact on the final verdict. However, the party who fails to participate may be obliged by the court to pay the costs incurred. Moreover, in some cases of plaintiff’s failure to participate, statute of limitations may still apply to his/her claim even if normally the settlement conference suspends it.\n\nSettlements are fairly uncommon. In the years 2016-2017, approximately 75000 settlements in civil, family, labour and business cases were reached in the courts of first instance per year. In 2018, the number dropped to 67475 (1,4% of all new cases). Some critical positions on the rationality and the use of this institution may yet be observed in the legal discourse. It is observed that settlement conferences have been used as a method of protracting the case by some parties. On these grounds, following the amendment of the code of civil procedure in 2019, the hitherto small fees for settlement attempt have been significantly increased. Currently, the party willing to settle must pay up to 20% of the court fee, which in turn is calculated based on the case value.\n\nTechnically and formally, Polish civil legal system adheres to rule of law standards and respects due process. Most due process guarantees are implemented in the civil procedure, such as the mechanisms of disqualification of judges and expert witnesses, party’s rights to be heard, requirements of judges’ impartiality (with the reservations concerning the method of appointing judges that have emerged in recent years) etc. Practical outcomes of the system’s operation yet justify raising some objections as to observance of due process standards, because systematic, even if isolated, issues persist related to the possibility of effectively making some cases before a court.\n\nIn the last years, the most serious systematic violations of due process in civil procedure were related to the situation of persons with disabilities. According to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, procedural accommodations (such as the use of sign language and interpreters), access to buildings, and legal assistance need to be improved in Poland in the civil law context. Also the use of the incapacitation mechanism which prevents some persons with disabilities from accessing the justice system is heavily criticized by human rights activists and the CRPD[6]. Anecdotal evidence indicates that procedural issues of insufficient representation and overly mechanistic application of law emerge also in cases pertaining to forced treatment, including forced psychiatric treatment and forced placement in care institutions, and this despite the reform introducing mandatory representation in 2018.\n\nAnother important example of due process issues relate to the fraudulent exploitation of a number of civil law institutions in reprivatization cases relating to property nationalized in 1940s and 1950s[7]. For example, in a number of publicized cases the possibility of appointing guardians for the missing owners of pre-World War II real property was used to obtain control over that property despite no actual grounds to do so existed. In some cases courts accepted the motions to appoint guardians for persons who, if alive, must have been well over 100 years old when the decision was passed.\n\nVocal activism in the field of family law may also be observed concerning distribution of parenting rights between men and women in the case of divorce and post-divorce, with alleged discrimination of men. Little systematic evidence in the last years supports such claims, even if some evidence has been presented in the past.\n\nMultiple reservations related to due process in civil procedure stem from the unsatisfactory course of proceedings due to practical issues and resource restraints, including delays, ineffective collection of debt (i.e. very ineffective alimony collection system) and high costs, preventing minor cases from making it to the court.\n\n3.3. Alternative Dispute Resolution\n\nIn no type of court procedures is any form of ADR compulsory before the case is heard. A possibility of opt-in mediation prior to the first court hearing exists in criminal, civil, labour, business, administrative, family and juvenile cases. In civil, labour and business cases the plaintiff is obliged to include in his/her summons the information on his/her prior attempts to mediate or to state the reasons for which s/he has not done so. The court is then obliged to inform the parties of the possibility to mediate and may oblige them to take part in a preliminary mediation meeting, designed to provide information on the aims and course of mediation. Depending on results of this, and based on the court’s own evaluation of the chances of mediation’s success, the court may also oblige the parties to take part in an actual mediation attempt, but the parties may opt-out once it begins.\n\nThe parties are encouraged to mediate by considerable discounts in court fees – 100% if the mediation succeeds before the court’s first hearing and 75% if it succeeds after the first court hearing takes place. Mediators’ fees are covered by parties, but are regulated by law at a low level. Persons of limited means may be exempted from paying them.\n\nA party may also be obliged by the court to repay the costs incurred by his/her “obviously unwarranted” refusal to take part in mediation. Another incentive to undertaking mediation is the fact that the statute of limitations does not apply while cases are being mediated, and that even if mediation itself is interrupted by the other party.\n\nDespite these incentives, and despite growths in mediation that have occurred in the last years, the scope of mediation compared to the number of cases heard is still very limited. Chart 07 indicates the scope of such diversions in all types of procedures where they are possible by year and case type[8].\n\nChart 07. Mediation in Poland, 2013-2019\n\nYear 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 1st half 2019 Number of cases where mediation was ordered by court 13370 13239 17811 24105 27493 26810 14933 As percent of all cases where mediation may be ordered 0,50% 0,50% 0,70% 0,90% 1,09% 1,07% 1,18% Number of actual mediations 3836 3798 4328 5246 8897 7090 4006 As percent of all mediation cases 28,69% 28,69% 24,30% 21,76% 32,36% 26,45% 26,83% Number of cases settled as a result of mediation 663 922 1155 1649 2269 2476 1535 As percent of actual mediation 26,80% 32,88% 33,39% 32,47% 34,21% 32,25% 36,70% Number cases with of information meetings n/a 1399 2308 1503\n\nIt appears that the most significant policy driver behind development of mediation has been the need to improve the pace of court proceedings. It was hoped that introduction of mediation would relieve the courts from the necessity of hearing certain types of cases thus reducing delays and caseloads[9]. Given the limited effect the reform has brought, these hopes appear so far to have been ill-founded.\n\nAnecdotal evidence and limited official data support the perception that voluntary or consensual diversion of disputes to non-judicial forums is marginal in Poland.\n\nBoth types of dispute resolution are yet formally possible. The parties may mediate any civil case at will, and then the mediation settlement is subject to court approval in a non-disputed procedure. Once approved, the settlement cannot be challenged. A dispute may also be resolved by means of arbitration if a contractual clause provides for this possibility or if parties so agree once the dispute emerges. In such a case arbitration becomes the standard route of dispute resolution for the parties unless they both opt-out. The decision of an arbitration tribunal may be challenged before a common court only if it contravenes a substantive law.\n\nSome out-of-court opt-in ADR mechanisms have been established as a result of implementation of the EU’s ADR Directive[10]. Under this scheme, the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection maintains a register of public and private institutions authorized to amicably resolve disputes between consumers and businesses. Currently, 11 such institutions are listed, providing free (in some cases at minimal cost) resolution of consumer disputes, both general and emerging in specific sectors (telecommunication, finance, transportation etc). The procedure may be mandatory for businesses in some sectors if the consumer opts in. The resolution may be binding if the parties opted in before initiating the procedure. One example of a publicly available arbitration institution which predates implementation of the directive are Consumer Courts established by Trade Inspection – a public organization tasked with “horizontally” resolving general consumer disputes. In 2018, 18.5 thousand cases were brought before authorized institutions, including 9 thousand resolved by Consumer Courts[11].\n\nA peculiar institution of Polish labour law dispute resolution system are conciliatory committees which may be established under the Labour Code by employers to amicably resolve disputes emerging in the workplace. In practice such committees are extremely rare despite the long existence of legal provisions enabling them.\n\nSome promising forms of amicable dispute resolution that existed in the past are not existent any more[12].\n\n3.4. Simplification of law and by-passing legal processes\n\nSimplified procedures and bypasses are uncommon in Polish law. As it were, in civil law, the simplified procedure is used to obtain orders of payments, but this mostly serves the needs of the multiple player plaintiffs, such as e.g. telecom corporations.\n\nApart from that, a simplified procedure is default in cases where case value does not exceed 20000 PLN as well as those relating to warranties, guarantees and rents. The simplification comprises a number of procedural changes compared to the standard procedure, aiming at making evidence gathering shorter and eliminating some procedural avenues. Until late 2019, statements of complaints and other motions had to be filed using standardized forms. This obligation was criticized as cumbersome and overly formalistic, and was eventually abolished. No systematic empirical data exists that would indicate if this had any impact on the outcomes of court proceedings.\n\nIn contrast, in criminal law plea bargaining procedures, no contest pleas and summary procedures are widely used. In 2019 they constituted, respectively, 5%, 23% and 23% of all convictions before Polish courts[13]. The ease and scope of obtaining verdicts in these procedures may substantiate objections as to the unfavourable position of the suspects.\n\nConsistently with the reluctance towards establishing simplified legal processes, no equitable resolutions are permitted in Poland. Courts are obliged to strictly abide by and apply the law.\n\nNo fault compensation is possible in medical negligence cases. An optional procedure exists where claims are heard by out-of-court medical negligence commissions. They work in an administrative and semi-mediatory mode, awarding compensation for harms caused by medical errors. Amounts that can be obtained are capped by statutory regulation at a fairly low level.\n\nEffectiveness of medical negligence commissions is disputed. Unsystematic evidence and an evaluation executed by the Supreme Audit Office in 2018 suggest that only a small fraction of all cases of harms caused by medical negligence is heard before them, compensations awarded are small and procedures are slow and cumbersome. In the years 2012-2017, 2203 cases were initiated and 1456 resolved[14].\n\n5. LEGAL AID SYSTEM\n\n5.1. History of legal aid\n\nThe right of legal aid in Poland goes back as far as 1016 when it was allegedly proclaimed by the first king of the country, Bolesław Chrobry. More systematic evidence of the right dates to 1362, when the Statute of Casimir the Great was bestowed in Wiślica, explicitly mentioning the right to free assistance at court[1]. Actual availability of legal aid in the late medieval and early modern times is yet dubious. From the late XVIII century until 1918 Poland was partitioned between Austria, Russia and Prussia, with procedural laws and legal counsel guarantees being determined in the invaders’ legal systems.\n\nAfter independence was regained, establishing a legal aid system wasn’t a priority and was limited to establishing a basic system of “poor privilege” in both criminal and civil proceedings. This system continued largely unchanged under the communist rule. In its post-Stalinist phase it focused on institutional mechanisms of social welfare rather than due process, promotion of human rights and empowerment of citizens. Some institutions, like the National Labour Inspectorate and the Prosecutor’s Office combined authoritative control of legality with provision of legal assistance. This dual approach was consistent with largely inquisitorial nature of court proceedings.\n\nSome fundamental institutions of access to justice – such as the Ombudsman established in 1987 – have emerged in the late years of the communist regime. In the transition period of the 1990s little attention was yet paid to the development of a coherent public-funded legal aid system, particularly concerning out-of-court legal advice. The poor privilege system persisted without much change since the early 1930s and was only supplemented by a growing number of narrowly-tailored and incoherent public out-of-court advice institutions. These mostly evolved naturally out of the communist era control-and-assistance approach.\n\nSince the Constitution of 1997 was enacted, the right to legal aid could be derived from its several provisions (see Section 5.2) but is not directly proclaimed. In the late 1990s and the 2000s, the justice gap was being partially remedied by the dispersed and uncoordinated grassroot initiatives undertaken by an amalgam of NGOs (funded mainly from public resources), public social services agencies, academic institutions, and bar associations.\n\nThe EU accession in 2004 contributed to recognition of international standards and catalysed implementation of legislation concerning some forms of legal aid – e.g. the Council Directive 2002/8/EC of 27 January 2003 to improve access to justice in cross-border cases.\n\nDespite these developments, it was only in 2016, more than 25 years after the political transition had started and 12 years after the EU accession, that legislation establishing a public out-of-court advice system was implemented. In 2018 the system was reformed, with new, remarkably loosened eligibility criteria and a more holistic approach supplementing traditional legal service.\n\nSecondary legal aid continues to be regulated in a traditional way, with an uncoordinated judicare system rooted in the 1930s regulation. Codes of procedures applicable to court proceedings lay down some forms of legal aid, most notably the right to public legal representation and exemption from court costs. The form and scope of secondary legal aid remains restricted.\n\nThe out-of-court legal aid system introduced in 2015 underwent said reform already in 2018 because it turned out to be largely inefficient. Apart from that, the introduction of the system pushed the issue of legal aid to the political agenda. Providing further social groups with access to legal aid could have been seen by political decision makers as an opportunity to mobilize support.\n\nSecondary legal aid has not undergone systematic reforms in recent years. An attempt to reform legal aid in criminal cases was undertaken in 2013 so that an attorney is provided to all suspects and accused in criminal proceedings. Whilst the amendment technically entered into force, it didn’t last long enough to actually produce any effect. Soon after the currently ruling coalition came into power in 2015, the amendment was overturned. The reasons for this may be related to the coalition’s political agenda having clear penal-populist elements. It should also not escape notice that the regulation was unlikely to increase the revenue stream for attorneys, because it relied on the hitherto system of attorney costs in ex officio cases (discussed in Section 2). Only in 2015, shortly before the new government took over the power, were minimal attorney fees significantly increased. Interestingly, whilst the new government reversed also the reform of attorney fees, minimal fees in criminal matters remained higher, as if in an attempt to increase price levels.\n\nIn 2018 mandatory representation in forced psychiatric treatment was introduced (free for persons not having an attorney). Already this limited reform led to a marked increase in the number of ex-officio cases in family courts.\n\nGiven the ebb and flow of these developments, one would be in error to consider the recent governmental moves regarding the strengthening of the legal aid system a sign of the development of democratic mechanisms in Poland. To the contrary, the current coalition has been known for undermining democratic institutions, weakening the separation of powers and undertaking anti-constitutional measures. This is best demonstrated by the reforms of the judiciary or a conflict around the Constitutional Tribunal – actions widely criticized by the vast majority of lawyers in Poland as well as on the European[2] and international levels. The last few years of legal aid reform may be an indication of an instrumental use of legal aid institutions. One may thus take Poland as an example of correlation between democratization processes and institutionalization of legal aid only if one also recognizes the bumps and bruises on the way.\n\nThe current role of legal aid as a mechanism to promote access to justice is difficult to evaluate given the issues related to its institutionalization. On the other hand, the scale and success of grassroots initiatives and clear deficits in access to justice make it apparent that omissions in providing legal aid do lead to unfavourable consequences.\n\n5.2. Legislative framework for legal aid\n\nDespite being very verbal about human rights, the Constitution of the Republic of Poland does not directly constitute the right to legal aid. Its following articles may yet be highlighted as the normative context of such a right:\n\nArt. 2: “The Republic of Poland shall be a democratic state ruled by law and implementing the principles of social justice.”\n\nArt. 42(2): “Anyone against whom criminal proceedings have been brought shall have the right to defence at all stages of such proceedings. He may, in particular, choose counsel or avail himself – in accordance with principles specified by statute – of counsel appointed by the court.”\n\nArt. 45(1): “Everyone shall have the right to a fair and public hearing of his case, without undue delay, before a competent, impartial and independent court.”\n\nArt. 67(1): “A citizen shall have the right to social security whenever incapacitated for work by reason of sickness or invalidism as well as having attained retirement age. The scope and forms of social security shall be specified by statute”\n\nArt. 67(2): “A citizen who is involuntarily without work and has no other means of support, shall have the right to social security, the scope of which shall be specified by statute”.\n\nThere also isn’t an all-encompassing regulation of legal aid, generally regulating the field. Instead, the right to obtain legal aid stems from a number of dispersed context-specific statutory provisions. The Act of 5 August 2015 on Free Legal Assistance, Free Civic Guidance and Legal Education with subsequent amendments introduces the nationwide system of state-funded out-of-court legal advice. Article 46(1) of the Act of 12 March 2004 on Social Assistance provides the right to special counselling for persons in difficult life conditions: “Specialist counselling, in particular legal, psychological and family counselling, is provided to persons and families who have difficulties or display the need to support them in solving their life problems, regardless of their income” and specifies in para 2 that “Legal advice is provided by providing information on applicable provisions in the field of family and guardianship law, social security law, and protection of the rights of tenants”.\n\nMultiple provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure, the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Law on Proceedings before Administrative Courts, and the Act of 28 July 2005 on Court Costs in Civil Cases regulate secondary legal aid.\n\nOn top of that, art. 10 of the Act of 13 April 2007 on the National Labour Inspectorate stipulates that NLI shall provide advice and information in the field of labour law to workers and employers. Similarly, art. 42(1) of the Act of 16 February 2007 on Competition and Consumer Protection, provides that the tasks of consumer ombudsmen include free-of-charge consumer advice and legal information in matters relating to the protection of consumers’ interests.\n\n5.3. Institutional framework for legal aid\n\nLegal aid is delivered in two separate areas which are not mutually coordinated: primary legal aid, consisting of an out-of-court system established under the Act of 2015 and other providers, and secondary (judicial) legal aid. As for the latter, the right to legal representation is secured by ex-officio defender appointments. The court before which a process is held grants a request. An advocate/legal adviser is chosen from a list prepared by a local Bar association. Since 2020 free opt-in out-of-court mediation is provided within out-of-court legal aid services.\n\nAs for the out-of-court system, more than 1500 small offices (“points”) were organized throughout the country (in 2019 – 1529) in which individuals may seek legal assistance and citizens’ advice. The territorial access may be considered good as aid is provided in at least one office in every powiat (second-lowest-level administrative units). Legal aid providers on duty in a specific office may yet not be specialized in a specific field of law, which may limit the access. There is no integration or exchange of information among the points in different powiats. Mediators provide their service with NGOs based on competitive tenders.\n\nSome primary legal aid is also delivered by public institutions in specific fields of law, such as consumer protection and labour and social security cases. Furthermore, with the official public system absent until 2015, numerous grassroots initiatives have emerged over time and continue to offer their services. They include such entities as NGOs, bar associations which come up with pro bono schemes, or academic law clinics. These initiatives remain uncoordinated with the out-of-court system.\n\nThe out-of-court legal aid system introduced by the Act of 2015 remains under general supervision of the Ministry of Justice. However, the direct organization of the system is mostly vested with local self-government units, specifically powiats, which to this end receive a governmental subsidy. Some competences, mainly supervisory with regard to the powiats’ activity, are assigned to wojewodas (representatives of the government on the voivodeship (regional) level).\n\nThe Ministry of Justice conducts yearly evaluations of tasks within the scope of the Act of 2015. In this, the Minister is advised by The Board of Free Legal Assistance, Free Civic Guidance and Legal Education. Its members are appointed by the Minister of Justice and include representatives of bar associations, NGOs involved in legal aid delivery, lower level local-self government (powiats), as well as representatives of the President of Poland, Ministry of Justice and a number of other ministries. System users are not represented, and the majority in the Board belongs to civil servants working for the central government.\n\nAs a result of this design, administrative staff in the primary legal aid system does not enjoy any autonomy but is directly subordinate to political and administrative superiors both at the local (powiats) and central level. It is different with first line workers in the out-of-court system under Act of 2015. They are not employed by the system on labour contracts, but hired on the basis of competitive tenders (NGOs) and random assignment among lawyers who opt-in (bar associations). Their level of autonomy is therefore relatively high.\n\nAs far as secondary legal aid is concerned, the Ministry of Justice holds some competences with regard to oversight and budgeting. Nonetheless the system is decentralized as aid in particular proceedings is granted by courts according to the criteria laid down in applicable legislation. Consequently, there isn’t a single body to manage and evaluate functioning of the system.\n\nClearly, the organizational design of legal aid in Poland is complex. Not only is there little coordination between the out-of-court system and secondary legal aid, but also no central institution is able to coordinate the scores of front line workers and organizations involved with the system. For this reason, the hopes placed in the new out-of-court legal aid system by grassroots activists that more coordination and stable financing channels are introduced, turned out to be hollow.\n\nThis is because the design process of the new law was faulty and failed to appreciate the complexity of the issue. Apart from insufficient attention to organizational matters, the eligibility criteria were not adjusted to the demand, which turned out to be much smaller than expected. Due to the fact that providers are paid for availability, the initial design resulted in approximately 75% of money spent going to waste.\n\nFor this reason already in 2019 a thorough amendment was introduced. Whilst it increased the aid availability, it left unchanged the essential organizational design of the system. In face of the chaotic nature of hitherto provision, this puts a question mark over decision makers’ actual intentions. Needless to say, in 2015, the system was introduced shortly before the parliamentary elections, as if in a bid to reinvigorate the weakening support for the then-ruling competition. Similarly, in 2018 the presidential initiative to amend the 2015 Act was pompously hailed as “the help to the ordinary men for the taking”. The early outcomes of the reform are partially positive, but still the supply of aid by far exceeds demand, with approx. 15% growth in system utilization in the first half of 2019 only (see data in Section 5.8 below).\n\nIn the case of judicial legal aid, there has not been much development in the legal representation and exemption from judicial costs areas. The criminal procedure amendment of 2013 prescribed a significant modification in this regard. However, soon after the current ruling coalition came into power in 2015, the amendment was overturned. The period of its functioning was too short in order to correctly evaluate its actual effects.\n\nEvaluation research in the legal aid system which inquired into users’ experiences has been conducted to very limited extent. An independent study conducted by INPRIS – an independent legal think tank – in 2018 found that the existence of an office of the out-of-court legal aid system in the proximity of their place of residence was known to a small percentage of the population (27% of nationwide survey compared to 53% who knew about a commercial practitioner in the area)[3].\n\nEvaluations of the process of obtaining legal aid provided by beneficiaries in the self-reporting mode upon receiving legal aid are in principle very positive in every aspect studied[4]. However, the methodology of this evaluation is rather crude and may be questioned, because the evaluation questionnaire is distributed among beneficiaries during the meeting with aid provider, which may produce some bias[5].\n\n5.4. Legal aid budget\n\nThe system introduced in the Act of 2015 is funded from the State budget in the form of subsidies allocated to every powiat. Maximum total amount of these subsidies is provided in the law along with the formula to calculate the amount awarded to every powiat each year, based on its population. The limits have been established for a ten-years period (2016-2025). For 2020, it is 103 352 971 PLN (approx 24,4 million USD), with increases each year up to 116 024 519 PLN (approx. 27,4 million USD) in 2025. Once a year the Ministry of Justice, in coordination with the Ministry of Finance, issues a regulation establishing a base sum upon which the total amount of subsidies is to be calculated.\n\nThe actual spendings on the out-of-court legal aid system are close to the maximum limit due to the fact that providers are remunerated for availability, not actual service. For instance, in 2016 99% of the funds allocated in the budget were spent, even though the demand for service was at about 25% of capacity. Due to this, and because of scarcity of data collected by the Ministry about the out-of-court system it is impossible to specify the amounts spent on specific types of service and fields of law.\n\nDue to the specificity of the financing method and relatively short time passed since its introduction, the legal aid system has not gone through funding cuts. Yet, it should not escape notice that the 2018 amendment increasing availability of aid was introduced without any increase in the budget.\n\nOther services available (such as advice delivered by Labour Inspectorate and Consumers’ Ombudsmen, see Section 5.11 below) are financed from these institutions’ budgets and the total amount spent is not known. In 2014, it was estimated based on an econometric analysis, that no less than 500 million PLN is likely to be spent on such services[6].\n\nThe secondary legal aid system is incorporated into the judiciary budget which is managed at the individual courts’ level. This obfuscates the spending mechanisms and according to official information from the Ministry of Justice, it makes it impossible to determine the exact amounts spent. Total amount allocated to the courts to finance the task “Activity for facilitating access to justice system” in 2019 comes to 227 million PLN, however this sum is also supposed to cover expert witnesses’ and interpreters’ remuneration and other similar costs. This category is also highly variable year to year. Data delivered by the Ministry of Justice to CEPEJ is more accurate, but is likely to be a result of some more extensive estimation based on unknown methodology.\n\nRough approximation of amounts spent in both systems is presented in the Chart 08 below.\n\nChart 08. Estimates of spending on legal aid in Poland, 2014-2019\n\nYear CEPEJ Data –\n\nimplemented budget\n\nState budget – activity based budgeting Statute on Legal Aid – allocated spending on primary legal aid system Total budget allocated to\n\nlegal aid and system organization\n\nCost of secondary legal aid in criminal and civil matters as percentage of expense on civic and criminal procedures 1000s EUR EUR per capita 1000s PLN 1000s EUR EUR per capita Percent 1000s PLN 1000s EUR EUR per capita 2014 23328 0,61 nd nd nd nd na na na 2015 na na 221284 51461 1,34 13,7 na na na 2016 27427 0,71 362034 82093 2,13 17,35 94183 21954 0,57 2017 na na 368938 83659 2,17 18 96161 21805 0,56 2018 na na 216426 50332 1,31 17 98565 23637 0,62 2019 na na 227446 52894 1,37 14,3 100931 23472 0,61\n\nThe fact that the same budget category is supposed to cover both legal aid and other expenses incurred by the courts may incentivize the courts to take budgetary considerations into account when deciding about granting the ex-officio counsel. It should also not escape notice that the amounts spent on out-of-court legal aid is roughly similar to the amount spent on secondary legal aid. Given the proportions between secondary and primary legal aid spending in developed systems, where secondary aid is much more resource-consuming, this is highly unusual.\n\nIn 2019, the entire budget of courts (including salaries and social insurance payments) came to 8,05 billion PLN (1,87 billion EUR).\n\nEven with scarcity of data, a clear peculiarity of the Polish system is the imbalance between budgets of the out-of court system and the system of court advice. It may be observed that elsewhere representation and other services delivered in the course of court trials are on the whole by far more expensive than advice delivered in the out of court system. In Poland, distribution of public funding is currently skewed towards the out-of court system. While state budget expense towards costs of representation is presumably still higher, the proportion is unusual.\n\nThis is due to the fact that eligibility criteria in both parts of the system are not coordinated, and severely restricted in the representation segment. As a result, persons who are perfectly eligible to obtain out-of-court service are unlikely to also benefit from free advice and representation in court. The root cause of this is the lack of reform of the free representation system so that it matches the now-extended out-of-court service.\n\n5.5. Legal aid providers\n\nTwo types of aid providers are active in the out-of-court system. Under the Act of 2015, half of legal aid offices shall be handled by advocates and legal advisers[7] and half by NGOs specializing in legal advice and citizens advice. Within the NGOs’ limit, aid may be provided by advocates and legal advisers, as well as tax advisers, mediators, lawyers who are not members of the bar associations and specialists in citizens’ advice. Lawyers not associated with bar associations, are required to have at least 3 years of professional legal experience. In the case of advice not being provided by a licensed lawyer, a/the client is required to sign a declaration confirming that s/he is aware that a legal aid provider is not an advocate, legal adviser or tax adviser.\n\nIn reality, in 2018, 47% of aid offices were handled by NGOs because of insufficient interest in running them. In 2019, 51% offices were run by NGOs because apart from free legal aid also citizens advice was provided for the first time.\n\nAs a result of this design, front line legal aid providers are not in-house staff of a state legal aid institution, but independent professionals and employees or contractors of NGOs. Recruitment of staff is solely vested with external bodies – bar associations and NGOs and its method is not determined by law.\n\nAdvocates and legal advisers obtain one-year contracts with powiats. In order to do so, each year a powiat signs an agreement with a local bar association that serves as a basis for determination of a number of attorneys designated to offer legal aid in the powiat as well as remuneration provisions. Bar associations are free to use any method of selection of their members from those who have volunteered to work in the system. In practice, random assignment is often used. Once the agreement is signed the attorney signs a contract directly with a powiat.\n\nNGOs willing to deliver legal aid must participate in tenders organized yearly by each powiat. Only NGOs included in a list of authorized NGOs, administered by a regional wojewoda may participate. A number of criteria must be fulfilled to be listed, including 2 years of experience in the legal aid-related area as well as having signed a contract with an advocate, legal adviser, tax adviser, mediator, or a lawyer not associated with a bar. NGOs which succeed in the tender sign contracts with powiats, specifying the scope and conditions of services.\n\nThere is no nationwide data concerning the level interest among lawyers to become legal aid providers within the public system. However, unofficial information from bar associations and anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of candidates exceeds available positions, particularly in smaller towns.\n\nUneven interest in participation in the system may be due to discrepancy of salaries between lawyers in big cities, especially in Warsaw, and in the provinces. Whilst approx. 60 PLN per hour is not tempting for lawyers in Warsaw, elsewhere it may still be a good offer even for experienced lawyers. To provide an example, the number of advocates and legal advisers interested in becoming a legal aid provider in Jarosław (a town of less than 40,000 inhabitants) has been regularly bigger than the number of available positions. On the other hand, in more remote offices there may be some problems with a supply of legal professionals, in particular trained mediators.\n\nIn the out-of-court system, lawyers are paid a fixed fee for availability during office hours (by default 20 hours a week which may be prolonged without additional pay). The sum on the basis of which salaries of legal aid providers are calculated is currently set at 5500 PLN monthly per office. This translates into hourly remuneration of approximately 60 PLN.\n\nSecond line legal aid is provided by active advocates or legal advisers, and in the case of administrative proceedings, also tax advisers and patent attorneys. Attorneys are selected by bar associations on the request from a court. Clients may request that a particular lawyer is tasked with representation and that the hitherto ex-officio attorney is changed. Requests of this type are reviewed by the bar association which is not obliged to accept them.\n\nLawyers are paid a fixed fee that varies on the type of case. The fees are established by the Regulation of the Ministry of Justice of 22 October 2015 on attorney fees and the Regulation of the Ministry of Justice of 3 October 2016 on the costs incurred by the Treasury for unpaid legal assistance provided by an ex officio lawyer. The fees for ex-officio lawyers are regulated at a level approximately 30% lower than the minimum fee for regular attorneys. The remuneration is provided by the State. Also second line legal aid remuneration may be attractive in small-market areas but is insufficient in competitive markets of big cities.\n\nThus far we have not noted publicly resonating cases of restraints of independence and autonomy of legal aid providers. Neither in the out-of-court system nor in the secondary legal aid providers enjoy special prerogatives or privileges – their status is the same as the market lawyers’.\n\n5.6. Quality assurance\n\nQuality assurance in both primary and secondary legal aid is mostly formal and utilizes internal quality control mechanisms in bar associations and NGOs providing out-of-court service. This includes proactive mechanisms, like requirements for professional training and continued education, as well as reactive ones in the form of disciplinary procedures in negligence cases. Quality control in the form of external evaluation and peer review is used only to a minimum extent.\n\nTo become an advocate or a legal adviser in Poland, a law graduate must undergo 3-year-long bar training and pass the Bar exam. Under some circumstances however, bar trainees can also provide legal aid – on prior authorization of their patron advocates or legal advisers. These requirements are presented as a sufficient guarantee that quality advice and representation is provided. The client-attorney privilege is cited as the obstacle for subjecting aid providers to peer review or external evaluation.\n\nAs far as NGOs are concerned, two formal quality control mechanisms stand out. First, in order to participate in tenders, NGO must sign contracts with legally trained professionals, i.e. advocates, legal advisers, tax advisers, mediators, or lawyers not associated with a bar having min. 3 years of professional legal experience. In the case of citizens advice, only persons who have undergone specialized training offered by licensed organizations may provide advice. Second, NGOs are required to have at least 2 years of experience in carrying out legal information and legal advice assignments. Lists of NGOs that may apply for being a legal aid provider are administered and regularly updated by wojewoda governors.\n\nNeither in NGOs nor in bar associations legal aid providers are legally required to take part in continuing education merely on the grounds of providing legal aid. In the case of advocates, legal advisers, and tax advisers it might be explained by the fact that they are already obliged to take part in forms of continuing education in their respective professional associations. Such training usually does not address challenges related to free legal aid.\n\nNGOs may provide additional training to its workers if the management so decides. No additional public funding is offered to this end. Citizen advice providers are required to undergo a 70-hour-long introductory training and subsequently a no less than 8-hour-long training every following year. Costs of training is to be borne by trainees or their employers.\n\nNo institution exists to control actual quality of advice. Neither Ministry of Justice nor the Board of Free Legal Assistance, Free Civic Guidance and Legal Education have the powers and organizational resources to do so.\n\nPartial quality monitoring is achieved by using a two-stage system of reporting. Every three months a starosta (district governor) of a powiat is obliged to prepare a report on the fulfilment of tasks stemming from the Act of 2015. The Ministry of Justice compiles a report based on aggregated data coming from all the powiats until July of the following calendar year. Since the 2018 amendment “advice cards” (case folders) contain a field for clients to fill in their opinions. A starosta governor is responsible for their analysis – nonetheless the Act does not empower a starosta governor to take specified measures related to this competence.\n\nA starosta governor is also responsible for controlling an NGO that provides legal aid services in the area of a relevant powiat. The control is performed according to the Act of 24 April 2003 on Public Benefit Activities and Volunteering. In addition, a wojewoda governor has competence to review selected advice files. Negative evaluation may lead to termination of cooperation with a given legal aid provider.\n\nBoth in the out-of-court system and in the secondary aid in cases of insufficient quality of advice and representation clients may demand compensation as in any other tort case. On top of that, they may demand that disciplinary proceedings be instigated against their attorney. Lawyers must be insured against the consequences of professional errors. Of course, issues of proof and evidence may be high barriers to obtaining compensation.\n\n5.7. Criminal legal aid\n\n5.7.1. Scope of criminal legal aid\n\nHypothetically, the right to be appointed an ex officio defence counsel exists at all stages of the criminal procedure including the criminal investigation phase. In this regard Poland is obliged to harmonize its legislation with Directive 2016/1919 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2016 on legal aid for suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings and for requested persons in European arrest warrant proceedings[8] as well as with the Directive 2013/48/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2013 on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and in European arrest warrant proceedings, and on the right to have a third party informed upon deprivation of liberty and to communicate with third persons and with consular authorities while deprived of liberty[9].\n\nHowever, despite the deadline for national transposition of the former passed on 25 May 2019, appropriate actions have not been taken. In theory, the failure to act by the Polish authorities results in the Directive having direct effect in the territory of Poland. In practice, law enforcement authorities do not observe the European legislation as they are organisationally and procedurally unprepared to follow its provisions.\n\nAs a result, under Polish law persons who have not been accused of committing a crime (i.e. are only suspects) are not entitled to an/the ex officio defence counsel. This pertains also to persons who have been detained as suspects.\n\nLegal aid is available for defendants during trial. There is also a possibility of appointment of the ex-officio defence counsel for the purpose of accomplishing an individual, determined legal action. The right to be appointed an ex officio defence counsel includes the appellate stage. Furthermore, the right to legal aid is guaranteed during the criminal enforcement phase. Eligibility criteria are analogous to the ones applicable in the investigation and court phases.\n\nAlso victims may demand legal aid both in the criminal investigation and the trial phase. Eligibility criteria concern mainly financial circumstances and are analogous to the ones applicable to the accused.\n\nAwarding legal aid is also possible for witnesses, but such an option is used very rarely. Two criteria must be met: Firstly, the witness can use the professional help if protection of her/his interest in the proceedings so requires. Secondly, financial requirements must be met of analogous scope to the conditions for appointment of a public defence counsel.\n\n5.7.2. Eligibility criteria for criminal legal aid\n\nIn the out-of-court legal aid system the general rules (see Section 5.8.2) apply to all types of cases, including criminal cases.\n\nTo be appointed an ex officio defence counsel an accused person not having an attorney must file a request to the court, proving that s/he is unable to bear the costs of defence without it affecting his/her ability to support oneself and his/her family. It follows that the request must be filed, and documents prepared, without assistance of an attorney but an out-of-court advisor may be used for this purpose. Persons having an attorney may not be granted an ex officio counsel, but the basis for the refusal to appoint an ex-officio defence counsel cannot be the fact that the applicant used free legal assistance or citizens‘ advice.\n\nUnder some circumstances appointing ex officio defence is mandatory. This applies when a person is juvenile, deaf, mute, or blind; if there is a justified doubt whether their ability to recognize the meaning of a given act or direct their behaviour was excluded or significantly limited when committing the act; if there is a justified doubt whether their mental health allows for their participation in proceedings or for running a defence in an independent and reasonable manner; and in proceedings before a regional court if they are accused of a felony. Additionally, the accused must have a defence counsel also when the court deems that necessary because of other circumstances impeding the defence.\n\nExcept for mandatory defence, the suspect eligible to be appointed an ex officio defence counsel may opt not to file a petition and thus run a pro se defence.\n\nAdvice provided by ex-officio defence counsel is free, without any contributions from the beneficiary. In principle there are no repayment mechanisms. However in a rare case when a legal aid beneficiary improves her/his financial status between the appointment of an ex officio counsel and the end of the proceedings, s/he is obliged to repay the Treasury for the received legal aid at the end of the criminal process.\n\n5.7.3. Process for obtaining criminal legal aid\n\nAccording to the Code of Criminal Procedure, prior to the first questioning a suspect shall be advised of the right to receive assistance from a defence counsel, including the right to apply for a public defence counsel if s/he is accused. If the presence of a defence counsel is mandatory, the public prosecutor files a petition to appoint an ex officio defence counsel for the accused.\n\nThe Directive (EU) 2016/1919 imposes the duty to decide on the suspect’s demand for legal aid before the first interrogation. Therefore, the criminal proceedings ought to halt at least until the decision is made and, if applicable, until a legal aid provider arrives. As already mentioned, the duties having its source in the Directive are not observed in the practice of law in Poland. Also, prior to charges being presented to the suspect, absence of an attorney, even if s/he is appointed, does not withhold the interrogations.\n\nThe president or a clerk of the court competent to examine the case is responsible for appointing an ex officio defence counsel for the accused. In deciding if an ex officio counsel should be awarded, the court enjoys wide discretion, because no detailed guidelines exist as to what economic situation may prevent a person from hiring a counsel.\n\nIf the accused does not have a defence counsel of choice and is entitled to be appointed one ex-officio, s/he must file a petition to the court. The order on granting or refusing the appointment of an ex-officio counsel is then issued by the president of the court, the president of a division, the president of the adjudicative panel, a duly authorised judge, or a court clerk. A petition for appointing an ex officio defence counsel shall be examined “without delay”.\n\nIf presence of a defence counsel is mandatory, the case is already at the court proceedings stage, and the accused does not have a defence counsel of her/his choice, the court or a court clerk undertakes the action to appoint a defence counsel ex officio.\n\nThe order of the president of the court refusing to appoint a defence counsel may be contested before the court competent for hearing the case, and the decision of the court refusing to appoint a defence counsel – before another equivalent panel of that court. Further appeal is not possible.\n\nAn ex officio defence counsel is appointed from among persons listed as defence counsels. The lists are compiled by local bar associations. Advocates and legal advisers may declare whether they want to serve as an ex officio defence counsels or not. However, if the number of volunteers in a given district is insufficient, the list may be extended to incorporate the remaining advocates and legal advisers.\n\nRegulation on Procedure of Guaranteeing the Help of an Ex-officio Defence Counsel provides that the petitioner can indicate her/his preference regarding an ex officio defender while filing the petition to be appointed an ex officio defence counsel. However, the court is not bound by this request.\n\nThe role of the out-of-court legal aid system in criminal cases is mostly secondary. In the first half of 2019, criminal matters were subject to advice in 7,32% of cases[10]. In principle there are no restraints concerning a choice of provider. Most importantly, seekers are not bound by geographical limitations – they can look for legal advice in any location. In practice, this freedom is curbed by a requirement to schedule an appointment in advance. Information about legal aid providers is public, therefore a client can seek advice from a provider of her/his choice, although cannot have a guarantee to obtain a meeting with the selected provider as there are several points of legal aid in the area of powiat and only one phone number with the help of which all the appointments are scheduled.\n\nOnly minimal statistics of cases where legal aid is granted in criminal cases is available. In 2018, 47939 requests for appointing free representation were filed, but no data exists as to the number of cases where representation actually was granted. Chart 09 summarizes the data for the last 10 years. The diminishing numbers of applications reflects diminishing crime rate and number of criminal court proceedings.\n\nChart 09.

Civil legal aid\n\n5.8.1. Scope of civil legal aid\n\nIn the area of out-of-court legal aid the principal legislation is the Act of 2015. A number of provisions guaranteeing access to various forms of primary legal aid exists in other acts. The Act of 16 February 2007 on Competition and Consumer Protection and the Act of 13 April 2007 on National Labour Inspectorate have the most significant impact on everyday practice. Other available options are discussed in Section 5.11 below. In litigation, the principal legislation are relevant codes of procedures (regulating both civil and administrative courts proceedings).\n\nOut-of-court legal aid encompasses information on legal status, rights and duties of natural persons, including regarding ongoing court and administrative proceedings. Legal aid providers also suggest solutions adapted to particular legal situations and prepare drafts of legal documents and opinions, except for pleadings pertinent to ongoing proceedings. As far as such proceedings are concerned, they may only draft petitions regarding exemption from court costs or appointment of an attorney. They are not allowed to take actions on behalf of the beneficiary.\n\nChart 10 provides information on types of service provided in the out-of-court system in the first half of 2019[11].\n\nChart 10. Legal aid in out-of-court system by type, 1st half 2019\n\nType of service delivered Legal information Legal advice Legal drafting Petition for exemption from court fees or granting ex-officio attorney Citizens advice Mediation attempt Number of aid episodes 189320 127995 27684 6783 23246 341 As % of all aid episodes[12] 82% 55% 12% 2,9% 10% 0,1%\n\nSince 2020 every office of the legal aid system operating on the basis of the Act of 2015 offers out-of-court mediation. Also other out-of-court public ADR institutions exist, such as the Banking Ombudsman, the Insurance Ombudsman, the Court of Arbitration by the Office of Electronic Communication, the Ombudsman by the Energy Regulatory Office and a network of consumer arbitration courts run by the Trade Inspection.\n\nAll types of civil and administrative cases are eligible in the out-of-court system. The only exceptions are matters related to economic activity (but advice on commencing it is allowed) and cases in which judicial proceedings have already begun. Mediation must not be provided if a court or another public authority has already issued an order to assign a case to a mediation procedure as well in cases where violence between parties could have occurred.\n\nIn practice, most cases relate to marital affairs, consumer protection, disputes arising from an employment relationship, succession, or contracts of lease and loan. This composition is generally stable over the years. Chart 11 informs about general composition of advice by field of law in the first half of 2019[13].\n\nChart 11. Legal advice in the out-of-court system by field of law, 1st half of 2019.\n\nCivil Family Labour Social insurance Administrative Tax Criminal Business start up Other 53% 16.56% 5.6% 8.12% 4.37% 1.6% 6.73% 0.51% 3.43%\n\nAs far as primary aid provision outside of the scope of Act of 2015 is concerned, multiple channels of delivery exist, discussed in Section 5.11 below. The most developed field is consumer protection. 370 municipal and district consumer ombudsmen provide free consumer advice, mediation and legal assistance in court proceedings. The consumer ombudsman may also bring an action on consumers’ behalf and, with their consent, join lawsuits in cases concerning protection of consumer interests. Similarly, the National Labour Inspectorate, whose network covers the entire country, may lodge complaints and, following the concerned person’s consent, participate in legal proceedings for the establishment of an employment relationship before labour courts.\n\nAs it were, the Polish system provides for legal representation before any court or tribunal. It may be granted in all cases and at all stages of the procedure (including appeal and proceedings before high courts). Strict eligibility criteria limit access to representation in comparison to out-of-court legal aid. A merits test is also conducted.\n\nAs regards the administrative courts, the right to legal aid encompasses the right to be appointed an advocate, legal adviser, tax adviser, or patent attorney. The appointment of a public defence counsel may be coupled with an exemption from judicial costs. Each form of assistance may also be provided separately.\n\nInformation on case characteristics in secondary legal aid is not available due to the decentralized nature of this part of the aid system.\n\n5.8.2. Eligibility criteria for civil legal aid\n\nAs regards the out-of-court legal aid, since 2019 there exists only one eligibility criterion to meet: “not being able to bear costs of paid legal aid” (Art. 4.1 of the Act of 2015). An applicant is not obliged in any way to lend credence to this fact – a written declaration is sufficient. As a result, no one is formally excluded from seeking out public legal aid and no merits tests are conducted.\n\nThe Act of 2015 does not exclude foreigners from applying for public legal aid. Immigrants and asylum seekers are yet more likely to utilize mechanisms dedicated to their specific needs. The Act of 13 June 2003 on granting protection to foreigners in the territory of the Republic of Poland entitles a foreigner towards whom a decision depriving her/him of refugee status or subsidiary protection was issued to free legal information and assistance. The Office for Foreigners is a public institution responsible for providing help in migration issues. A number of NGOs are active in this particular area, which may be an indication that the official system in this field is dysfunctional.\n\nAs regards legal aid in the courts, a person who is exempted by the court from court costs in part or in the whole may additionally request to be appointed an ex-officio defence counsel. If a natural person is not exempted by the court from court costs, s/he may request to be appointed an attorney if s/he states that s/he is unable to bear such costs without detriment to her/his or her/his family’s necessary subsistence or that bearing the costs would put her/him at such risk. Similar provision applies to legal persons and organisational units. They must demonstrate that they do not have sufficient means to bear the costs of defence counsel’s fee. To eliminate emergent bad practice, the code specifically indicates that the grounds for rejecting the motion cannot reside in the petitioner having benefited from legal aid received on the basis of the Act of 2015.\n\nThe motion shall be granted if the court considers the participation of an advocate or legal adviser necessary (merits test). Even if the economic vulnerability criteria are met, the appointment of an ex officio defence counsel is under no circumstances certain as the court may consider this unnecessary. The presence of a legal professional is deemed needed if the party is incapable of taking procedural actions unaided or if the state of facts or normative background of the case is complicated.\n\nThere are no fixed financial caps as regards estimation of economic vulnerability. The court is obliged to appraise the economic situation of the demander based on information included in the statement containing details of her/his family status, assets (e.g. concerning real estate or securities) income and livelihood. The statement’s binding template is fixed by the Ministry of Justice. The reasons for not being able to bear judicial costs ought to have an “objective character”[14]. Still, courts enjoy wide discretion in evaluating the matter.\n\nAs regards the administrative court proceedings, eligibility criteria and procedure are similar to those in civil cases. A natural person can obtain legal aid upon proving that s/he cannot bear either any costs of proceedings or full costs of proceedings without detriment to her/his or her/his family’s necessary subsistence. A legal person can obtain legal aid provided if it demonstrates that it cannot bear either any costs of proceedings or full costs of proceedings (the scope of legal aid varies in these two respective cases).\n\nAs in the case of criminal proceedings, the recipient does not have to contribute towards the cost of legal aid services. Furthermore, no repayment mechanisms of any sort exist in relation to the legal aid recipient. Public defence counsels may only recover the amount due to them in fees and expenses from the costs awarded to the defended party from the adverse party. The unpaid amounts are covered by the state budget, but according to the tariff the amounts are regulated at a level approx. 30% lower than the regular minimum.\n\nA special procedure applies to EU citizens and third-country nationals residing lawfully in a Member State, except Denmark. They have the right to legal aid in civil and commercial matters thanks to the transposition of the Council Directive 2002/8/EC of 27 January 2003 to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes by establishing minimum common rules relating to legal aid for such disputes. Granting of legal aid is dependent on evaluation of economic situation of the petitioner and it encompasses pre-litigation advice with a view to reaching a settlement prior to bringing legal proceedings as well as legal assistance and representation in court, and exemption from, or assistance with, the cost of proceedings of the recipient of legal aid. The scope of secondary aid provided to EU citizens is thus wider than what Polish citizens are eligible to.\n\n5.8.3. Process for obtaining civil legal aid\n\nAs regards the out-of-court legal aid under Act of 2015, a client has to make an appointment by calling the phone number provided by a legal aid office of his/her choice. Chart 12 indicates the number of persons served since the system was initiated.[15]\n\nChart 12. Number of beneficiaries in the out-of-court system, 2016-2019\n\n2016 2017 2018 2019 (1st half) 377506 398628 452584 230001\n\nAs it could be seen, despite aid availability being greatly increased in 2019, the total number of recipients in 2019 is unlikely to significantly exceed the number of beneficiaries in 2018.\n\nAs regards the civil court proceedings, a party shall submit a petition to be appointed an attorney together with a petition to be exempted from court costs or separately. The petition must be delivered in writing or verbally for the record in the court where the case is to be tried or is already pending. A natural person who does not have a place of residence at the location of the court concerned may submit a petition to be appointed an attorney to a district court of his/her residence, whereupon that latter court shall immediately forward such a petition to the court concerned.\n\nThe petitioner shall also file a statement containing the details of his/her family status, property, income and sources of support. Such a statement must be made on a specific form. If a petition to be appointed an attorney is filed together with a petition to be exempted from court costs, a natural person shall submit one statement only.\n\nAs for the administrative court proceedings, a party can file a petition before or pending the proceedings. The application should contain a statement on property and income, and if the application is submitted by a natural person, also accurate data on family status and a statement of the party about not working or not remaining in another legal relationship with an advocate, legal adviser, tax adviser or patent attorney. The petition should be made by filling in a specific form, which differs from the one in criminal procedure.\n\nUnless assistance is obtained in the out-of-court legal aid office, the petitioner must manage petition procedures on his/her own.\n\nAs far as decisions on granting aid are concerned, in the out-of-court legal aid system technically the decision is made by the aid provider. Yet, since 2019 the access is effectively open to anyone the term “granting legal aid” does not adequately describe the process, which is largely automatic[16]. Thus far, we have yet to hear cases of applicants rejected due to being able to bear legal market costs of legal advice despite the declaration to the contrary.\n\nAs regards the civil court proceedings, the court where the case is to be tried or is already pending is responsible for the appointment of an ex-officio defence counsel. This decision may also be issued by a court clerk. In addition, there exists a special regulation when a petition to be appointed an attorney is filed for the first time in cassation proceedings or proceedings related to an appeal to declare a final ruling unlawful – in this case the court for examination refers it to the court of first instance, unless it deems the petition to be duly substantiated.\n\nAs regards the administrative court proceedings, decisions to appoint or refuse to appoint a public defence counsel are issued by default by a court clerk and in some circumstances by the judge-rapporteur.\n\nTheoretical denials in the out-of-court system could be disputed before an administrative court in a general procedure.\n\nAs regards the right to legal representation in civil court proceedings, the decision to refuse to appoint or to dismiss an attorney is subject to a complaint lodged to the court of first instance sitting in a different formation. In addition, where a petition to be appointed an attorney is dismissed, the party shall not be entitled to repeat its request to be appointed an attorney on the basis of the same circumstances as claimed in the dismissed petition. A contrario, a new petition is possible provided that it is made on different grounds.\n\nAs regards the right to legal representation in administrative court proceedings, the party may file a grievance against the refusal of granting legal aid. A new petition is possible.\n\nAs far as choosing the provider is concerned, the out-of-court legal aid system theoretically offers much more possibility to the beneficiary. Aid seekers are bound neither by geographical limitations – they can look for legal advice in any location they may be – nor by type of provider – they may freely choose between attorneys, NGOs providing legal aid, and the ones offering citizens advice. In practice, this freedom is curbed by a requirement to schedule an appointment in advance. Information about legal aid providers is public, therefore a client can look for legal advice from a provider of her/his choice, although cannot have a guarantee to obtain a meeting with the selected provider as there are several offices of legal aid in the area of powiat. Scheduling of appointments is typically on the phone operated by the powiat, so the appointment procedure effectively serves as an unofficial triage mechanism.\n\nAs regards legal representation before the civil court, the court requests a competent regional Bar association which is required to promptly – but in no event later than within two weeks – appoint an ex officio defence counsel. A petitioner may suggest a specific advocate or legal adviser, but even though the Bar associations need to consult said advocate or legal adviser about the possibility to be designated, they are under no obligation to appoint that person.\n\nAs regards the administrative court legal representation, the procedure is similar, although in this case tax advisers and patent attorneys may be legal aid providers. Therefore, the court’s request may be forwarded to the National Chamber of Tax Advisers or the National Chamber of Patent Attorneys as well.\n\nIn the civil court proceedings pending proceedings are not automatically suspended due to a request to grant free representation, unless the petition to appoint an attorney for a plaintiff was filed in the summons or before bringing the action. However, the court may postpone hearing a case until a final resolution concerning said petition is reached. Consequently it withholds setting a date for a trial or cancels or postpones an already scheduled trial.\n\nIn the administrative court proceedings the court is required to forthwith consider the petition to appoint an attorney. Delay could cause inability of the party to take an active part in the proceedings which in turn could lead to the declaration of nullity of legal proceedings.\n\nChart 13 presents the number of applications granted in the last seven years[17].\n\nChart 13. Number of petitions granted for ex-officio representation by case type, 2012-2019\n\nCase type Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Civil 10753 11025 10420 10906 11708 11600 11492 nd Family nd 8703 9928 21313 nd Labour and social insurance 1547 2510 2448 nd Business 321 348 338 nd Administrative, first instance courts 4165 6678 7098 4172 3544 3632 1780 1610\n\nThe growth in the number of family cases in 2018 is related to non-litigious proceedings pertaining to authorization of forced psychiatric treatment. Since 1st January 2018, representation is mandatory for persons whose cases are being decided in courts, so free representation is awarded ex-officio. Until 2018, the court could award an attorney if it found that necessary. As the number of cases with free legal aid awards more than doubled, this change makes the scale of need for representation in civil cases in Poland very apparent.\n\n5.9. Holistic legal services\n\nOnly limited holistic services are available in the out-of-court segment of the free legal advice system. Since 2019, citizens’ legal advice has been offered in the out-of-court system, including the assistance to navigate in the administrative system also in not strictly legal issues, like social benefits.\n\nOther linkages between legal services and non-lawyer professionals are limited to the referrals to other public services from the legal aid system, including family, psychological and violence counselling, victim support, substance abuse treatment, crisis intervention, the homelessness crisis support, public employment services etc. It is mandatory for legal personnel to offer guidance on locally available service in cases where they find such service indispensable to resolve the case. Scope of utilization of such referral service against the scale of need yet remains unknown.\n\nIt must yet be indicated that in the case of other types of primary legal aid (see Section 5.11 below), it is legal aid that is an element of holistic service. This is the case of family and social work counselling, as well as victims’ support. In these types of service, legal aid is provided in-house.\n\n5.10. Legal aid before regional human rights mechanisms\n\nPoland is a member state of the Council of Europe. The European Court of Human Rights, established in 1959, fulfils the judicial role within this regional system of human rights protection. Its task is to supervise the enforcement of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nAccording to the statistics published by the European Court of Human Rights[18], in 2019 there were 1834 applications allocated against Poland. For comparison, the highest number of applications was lodged in 2010 – 5768. A downwards trend in complaints against Poland to the Court has been observed for several years.\n\nThe number of new complaints from Poland compared to the number of inhabitants in 2019 is below the European average. The indicator of the number of complaints in relation to the population fell to 0.48, with the European average of 0.53. The general number of pending cases from Poland constitutes 2,1 % of all cases pending before the Court.\n\nPoland does not have a national system of providing legal aid for applicants. The decisions upon legal aid are made by the Court on the basis of Rules of Court of 1 January 2020. The President of the Chamber may grant free legal aid to the applicant in connection with the presentation of the case, either at the request of an applicant or ex officio. Legal aid may be granted when it is necessary for the proper conduct of the case before the Chamber and when an applicant has insufficient means to meet all or part of the costs entailed.\n\nThe legal aid may nevertheless be granted only from the moment when observations in writing on the admissibility of that application are received from the respondent Contracting Party, or when the time limit for their submission has expired. It means that in this procedure no legal aid can be received by a party in order to prepare and lodge an application itself. Arguably, such aid could be obtained from the Polish out-of-court system, but no such cases are known.\n\nOther than that, free legal advice needed in the process of preparation of an application can only be obtained on the basis of a pro bono representation of a legal professional. Several NGOs, in particular the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, provide legal assistance in the preparation of applications in selected cases.\n\n5.11. Alternative sources of legal assistance\n\nNumerous alternative providers of legal assistance are active in Poland, particularly in the out-of-court sector. These include university law clinics, NGOs specializing in generalist advice and provision of holistic service for underprivileged and minority groups. Pro bono initiatives are animated by both bar associations. Assistance offered by commercial entities, such as insurance claims firms, has grown in popularity over the last decades. This activity is yet subject to some controversies regarding supposedly excessive fees and insufficient quality.\n\nAlso financial market tools, such as the legal expenses insurance, are limited. Conditional fee arrangements are somewhat popular, but services for individuals are subject to partial tarification anyway, which renders CFA uncompetitive. On top of that, licensed practitioners are barred from offering 100% CFA agreements (which is not the case for non-licensed service, e.g. insurance claim firms). Legal expense insurance is offered in the market, but not popular as a method of resolving legal problems. In 2019, LEI market for individual persons came to 27 million PLN in premiums sold[19]. Exact loss ratio for individual buyers is not known, but merely 6429 claims were settled resulting from 3450 events, indicating that few persons insured against legal expense actually make the claims. Circumstantial evidence suggests that LEI is usually sold along with other types of insurance (including mandatory mortgage insurance) as a result of which its scope and nature may be unclear for buyers.\n\nOther collective mechanisms of financing legal assistance to individuals, such as pre-paid plans, or specialized legal service commissioned by professional associations and trade unions for its members, do not appear to be popular in the market. No data sources are yet known to substantiate this observation. The most visible development in this area in recent years are well publicized cases where successful collective actions of consumer groups against corporations, most characteristically, banks, are undertaken. No systematic data yet exists on the scale of this phenomenon.\n\nApart from private and non-governmental initiatives, numerous public bodies and agencies offer legal assistance, either as their core service or as an element of other activities. This partially is due to the legacy of the socialist system, where advice in some matters was vested in entities otherwise responsible for authoritatively handling the cases of diffuse rights. This holds for the Labour Inspection, a public agency responsible for oversight over workers’ rights, which provides legal advice to both employers and employees, the public prosecutor office which is tasked in providing some legal assistance to certain types of clients, and the Office for Competition and Consumer Protection which provides out-of-court consumer assistance (including assistance in dispute resolution) directly and through its subsidiaries.\n\nOn top of that, since the 1980s, multiple entities have been established to provide legal assistance in the ombudsman mode. These includes The Ombudsman (a constitutional organ of the state, established in 1988), which provides advice, guidance and assistance to the complaining persons and may intervene in some cases, The Children’s Ombudsman (a constitutional organ protecting children’s rights), The Patients’ Ombudsman (a state entity advising on patients rights and intervening when they are infringed) and The Psychiatric Hospital Patients’ Ombudsmen active in psychiatric facilities. At the intermediate level of local self-government a network of 370 Consumer Ombudsmen is established, advising and intervening in consumer disputes. The Financial Ombudsman is a state entity supplying assistance and intervention in disputes between consumers and businesses in the financial sector.\n\nChart 14 informs about the scale of service provision in alternative providers of legal assistance.\n\nChart 14.

This is the outcome of the difficult history of the system, with very limited state provision of out-of-court advice until 2016 and the continuing traditional and limited system of court advice. As a result, multiple grassroots initiatives were undertaken by the representatives of the legal profession, NGOs and civil society activists to fill the gap in public services. Over time, these efforts have led to development of non-governmental infrastructure, yet largely financed from multiple public sources, with considerable volumes of service provided at no cost to beneficiaries, particularly in the out-of-court sector and the citizens’ advice sector.\n\nAfter the establishment of the public system in 2016, the grassroots initiatives became partially redundant, lost a significant portion of their funding and the volume of provision somewhat diminished. Yet, they did not entirely disappear. Reasons for their persistence include multiple dysfunctionalities on part of the public system, including restricted eligibility in the out-of-court system until 2018, its continued very limited promotion, and far better integration and intake mechanisms in the grassroots initiatives.\n\nAn interesting observation which stems from these particularities is that demand for legal services may not be easily transferred to another mode of service delivery if the established service providers are already in place, even if the latter’s competitive situation becomes adverse. Based on the analysis of statistical data already cited, a demand “transfer rate” of 35% may be calculated[30]."
