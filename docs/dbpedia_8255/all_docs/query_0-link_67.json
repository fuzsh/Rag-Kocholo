One of the aspects of teaching that I love is seeing the lightbulb moment — that moment when a concept or idea clicks with a student, because that moment can be the beginning of a new passion, a new career trajectory, a new way of looking at the world. I constantly feel privileged to be a part of those moments in my studentsâ academic lives, and love trying to come up with creative and engaging ways to facilitate those moments.â\n\n— Rochelle Stevenson, Associate Professor, Sociology\n\nâI love the interaction with students, particularly when students discuss and debate an idea raised in class. I also love sharing knowledge with students, introducing them to ideas for the first time, and watching their eyes light up with curiosity or surprise or puzzlement. Awakening the mind of the student is the first task of the philosophy instructor, and I've always striven to do so. I have always been passionate in my teaching, and have endeavoured to communicate my passion for philosophy to my students. When a student becomes passionate about philosophy, then I feel that I have succeededâ\n\n— Laurie Baugh, Philosophy, History and Politics faculty\n\nâWhat I most enjoy about teaching is building strong relationships with students, and seeing students return to my classrooms year after year. I also appreciate watching students arrive at new revelations through experiential learning activities and discussions in the classroom — I love diving into my facilitator toolkit to explore different modes of learning and debriefing.â\n\n— Jennifer Shaw, Assistant Teaching Professor, Sociology"
