        "text": "Entry requirements\n\nFor entry into most USC undergraduate degree programs, you need to have completed a minimum level of education similar to successful completion of Australian Year 12 with good grades.\n\nFurther studies, for example, a semester or more at college or university, can also be considered for entry and may give you credit transfer towards a degree.\n\nSome examples of upper secondary qualifications and a guide to the minimum grades that USC will consider are listed here. These are minimum requirements and do not guarantee entry. Some programs may require higher grades. Alternative qualifications may also be considered on a case by case basis.\n\nIf your qualification (grouped by country) is not listed, send the qualification transcripts with your application form to the International Office for assessment.\n\nEnglish language requirements\n\nYou will also need to meet the English language requirements for this program. If you do not meet the minimum requirements, you may be able to enrol in our English Language Programs to reach the required level for most of UniSCâ€™s programs (exceptions apply to non-standard English requirement programs).\n\nCommonwealth supported places\n\nCommonwealth supported places are substantially subsidised by the Australian Government so that students only pay 'student contribution\" amounts. The student contribution amount will vary depending on the course you are studying and how much funding the Government provides.\n\nIf you accept a Commonwealth supported place you are a Commonwealth supported student. As a Commonwealth supported student you must make a contribution towards the cost of your education (unless you are enrolled in Enabling or Tertiary Preparation Pathway courses) with the majority of the cost met by the Commonwealth Government.\n\nCommonwealth supported places are only available to domestic students. As a domestic student you are entitled to a Commonwealth supported place in an eligible program if you:\n\nmeet the citizenship and residency requirements\n\ncomplete an electronic Commonwealth Assistance Form (eCAF)\n\nmeet the University's entry requirements for your chosen program."
