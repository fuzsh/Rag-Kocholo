The country still provides plenty of employment opportunities in agriculture and manufacturing. Industrial activities include shipbuilding and the production of fertilisers and petrochemicals, machine tools, electrical machinery, electronics, and cars.\n\nIt is the service sector which is expected to continue growing in the future, though – especially in accommodation & food, health & social care and administrative services. Among the occupations with most new job openings there will be legal & social associate professionals, health professionals, but also business managers or researchers & engineers. Poland, as well as other EU countries, faces an ageing challenge that will impact the total demand for jobs. An overwhelming majority of total job openings (including replacements for vacated jobs) till 2030 will require high qualifications."
