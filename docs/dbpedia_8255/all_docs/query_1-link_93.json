        "text": "Overview\n\nFinal energy consumption in Poland was increasing by 1.5%/year from 2000 reaching 73.3 Mtoe in 2021 (at normal climate). The biggest consumer was transport sector, which share amounted to 32% in 2021, followed by households with 29.5% share. Energy use of third biggest consumer - industry - decreased by around 0.1%/year during given period and accounted for 22% of final energy consumption in 2021. Service sector, due to a rapid growth of consumption (2.4%/year) increased its share to 11.5% of total final consumption. Consumption in agriculture decreased by 0.1%/year and the share of this sector amounted to 5%.\n\nEnergy efficiency in Poland was improving by 1.6%/year over the period 2000-2021. Most progress was registered during the first half of the period (2.4%/year during 2000-2009 in comparison with 0.9%/year over 2009-2021). The most significant improvement was achieved in industry, where energy efficiency improved by 3.7%/year. In the residential sector, we can observe a small progress since 2004 (0.7%/year). The energy efficiency of transport improved by 0.7% per year until 2011, by 2.8%/year between 2011 and 2014, but there was no improvement in the following years.\n\nSource: MURE\n\nBuildings\n\nEnergy consumption of space heating per m² in households with climatic correction was decreasing on average by 0.7% per year in years 2000-2021. The highest consumption was observed in 2018 and amounted to 16.3 koe/m². After that, the energy consumption per m² tended to decrease at the rate of 5.2%/year. Energy consumption by end-use per dwelling grew substantially between 2000 and 2021: in case of electrical appliances and lighting by 20.5% to 0.15 toe/dwelling and in case of water heating by 1.5% to 0.28 toe/dwelling. In case of cooking there was a decrease of 9.7% to 0.14 toe/dwelling.\n\nIn 2021, energy consumption in households amounted to 22.2 Mtoe, an increase of 29.1% compared to 2000. In the period 2000-2021, energy savings reduced household energy consumption by 4.4 Mtoe, whereas climate increased energy consumption in households by 1.4 Mtoe, more dwellings by 3.8 Mtoe, larger homes by 2.4 Mtoe, and other factors by 1.8 Mtoe.\n\nIn 2021, total energy consumption per employee increased by 17.1% compared to 2000. The highest consumption was recorded in 2011, reaching 38.7% higher consumption than in 2000.\n\nIn 2021, electricity consumption per employee increased by 35.7% compared to 2000, the highest consumption between 2000 and 2021.\n\nSource: MURE\n\nTransport\n\nIn 2021, the share of passenger cars in energy consumption in transport amounted to 52.3%, an increase of 2.3 percentage points compared to 2000, and the share of trucks reached 43.4% (a significant increase of 9.8 percentage points compared to 2000). The share of other modes was small and decreased.\n\nIn 2021, the share of passenger cars in inland passenger traffic amounted to 85.3%, a significant increase of 25.7 percentage points compared to 2000. The share of buses and trains made up 7.8% and 6.9% respectively – significant decreases in share compared to 2000 by 19.4 and 6.3 percentage points respectively.\n\nIn 2021, the share of road transport in inland freight traffic reached 77.7%, a significant increase of 28.1 percentage points compared to 2000. The share of rail transport was 22.3%, a significant decrease of 27.0 percentage points compared to 2000. Water transport of goods remained marginal.\n\nEnergy consumption in transport has increased 2.4 times since 2000, the most important factor being the increase in passenger and freight transport, which contributed to an increase in consumption of 7.2 Mtoe. The modal shift from public transport to private cars for passengers and from trains to road for goods increased consumption by 4.2 Mtoe and other factors by a further 4.6 Mtoe. Energy savings (2.2 Mtoe) partially offset the impact of these effects.\n\nSource: MURE\n\nIndustry\n\nThe share of the three most energy-consuming industries (paper and pulp, chemicals and non-metallic) increased from 46% in 2000 to 49% in 2021. The final energy consumption of non-metallic industry increased by 24% compared to 2000, and paper and pulp industry by 38%, whereas the chemical industry decreased by 17%.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2021, there was a significant decrease in energy consumption per tonne of steel, paper and cement production, i.e. there was a significant improvement in energy efficiency. In 2021, the unit energy consumption of steel decreased by 35% compared to 2000, the unit consumption of paper decreased by 40%, and the unit consumption cement decreased by 20%.\n\nGrowth of activity in industrial branches contributed to increase in energy consumption by 13.3 Mtoe since 2000. On the opposite energy savings (11.8 Mtoe) and structural changes towards less energy intensive production (1.7 Mtoe) led to decrease the consumption. As a result, energy consumption of industry has decreased by 0.1%/year since 2000.\n\nSource: MURE"
