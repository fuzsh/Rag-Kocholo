        "text": "Earlier this month, Żabka Polska’s EVP and managing director, Dr Adam Manikowski, joined Shop Talk LIVE hosts, Carolyn Schnare and Dan Munford, along with NACS Relationship Partner CEE, Leszek Jurczak, and NACS Global Director, Mark Wohltmann, to share Żabka’s transformation journey.\n\nTo set the scene, Jurczak and Wohltmann shared insights on the Polish market and convenience retail landscape.\n\nOccupying an area of 312,696 km2 and with a population of 38 million, Poland is the sixth largest country in the EU by GDP value. Prior to the pandemic, the country was growing at a rate of 4.7% a year.\n\nDespite the growth, the average salary in Poland – €1,300.00 per month – is three times lower than Germany, for example.\n\nThe convenience retail market is also distinct. The Polish market is dominated by two players – Orlen in forecourt convenience retail and Żabka in non-fuel convenience retail – who outnumber their nearest rivals several times over.\n\nOrlen operates 1,800 sites, three times the number of its nearest rival BP (600 stores); while Żabka operates 8,400 stores, 12 times as many as its nearest competitor, Carrefour (700 stores).\n\nThe market also features top international players including Shell and Circle K and is in flux with Hungary’s MOL Group acquiring 417 Lotos retail sites in Poland and Orlen acquiring 185 stations from MOL Group in Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nLike other world markets, Poland’s retailers are facing some common risk factors including high inflation (13.9% in May 2022), increasing energy prices, war in Ukraine, limited availability of labour plus rising interest rates which are impacting people’s purchasing power.\n\nDespite the challenges, Poland is an exciting market and an epicentre of innovation when it comes to technology in Europe, according to Wohltmann.\n\nServing time-sensitive consumers across physical and digital channels\n\nŻabka, which claims to be the ultimate convenience ecosystem in Poland, provides the perfect retailer case study.\n\nDr Manikowski, a former Walmart executive and previous managing director of Tesco Poland and a Stamford graduate, shared Żabka’s journey and market positioning.\n\nAccording to Dr Manikowski, time is the new currency and is more important than low pricing. Żabka aims to save customers’ time by enabling them to shop quickly in stores as well as access other services.\n\nWith a market-leading footprint of 8,400 stores, Żabka is continuing to expand – it is opening more than 1,000 stores a year (1,100 in 2021) – equivalent to three stores a day.\n\nThat means Żabka’s penetration and access to customers is increasing every day, said Dr Manikowski. In fact, Żabka has 15m customers in Poland and 3 million people visit a Żabka store every day.\n\nConvenience is also about proximity, added Dr Manikowski. 15m Poles live within 500m of Żabka’s stores, which are open daily from 6am to 11pm. This further underscores the level of access and penetration of its network.\n\nŻabka’s ecosystem features additional business tools including the Zappka app, the leading app in Poland with 8 million users.\n\nIt has developed an e-commerce model too with Jush deliveries provided in under 15 minutes, while its Delio service is used for top-up shopping with delivery under one hour.\n\nThe customer remains at the centre of the model, however.\n\nAccording to Dr Manikowski, Żabka tracks its customers’ NPS (Net Promoter Scores) and Scores are constantly growing. The business is also creating value through its assortment. Dr Manikowski revealed the retailer has introduced 1,000 new products in the last 12 months, of which 300 were unique products to Żabka. “It’s creating top of mind awareness with customers that if you want to find something new or some excitement, you go to Żabka,” he said.\n\nFurther differentiation is provided through promotional schemes including multi packs, happy hours and ice cream offers. The retailer is also growing its food on-the-go offer with Żabka Cafe, which provides coffee, hot dogs, paninis, burgers, meat pies, French fries etc. Żabka is the leading hot dog and sandwich seller in Poland, says Dr Manikowski; who reveals the retailer seeks to offer value through differentiation and a key KPI for the business is the extent to which its assortment is different to other players and provides competitive edge.\n\nThree stages of transformation\n\nŻabka’s transformational journey has been based on three key pillars:\n\nFormat evolution\n\nFormat evolution has been key, said Dr Manikowski. Żabka has rebranded and refurbished all its stores to its latest format, transforming sites from traditional corner stores to modern, ultra convenience stores with new lighting, layouts and fixtures providing space to grow the assortment.\n\n“It was the biggest remodelling program in Europe ever but it has given us format flexibility and allows us to unlock growth potential,” Dr Manikowski says.\n\nŻabka’s multi store format approach spans stores in rural areas, in large cities, high traffic sites, mobile stores, petrol station locations plus seasonal stores at seaside and lakeside resorts in Poland. According to Dr Manikowski, the strategy has enabled the business to grow quickly but maintain a strong economic performance at each of its stores.\n\nDigital transformation\n\nŻabka’s digital transformation was launched in 2016 and was designed to drive business efficiencies and enable the retailer to better tailor its proposition to customers. It’s been a far from ‘light touch’ approach. Indeed, Dr Manikowski reveals that 20% of Żabka’s employees now work in IT and digital innovation at the business.\n\nDigital transformation has spanned the entire organisation – 8,000+ stores, 7,000+ franchisees and extended supply chain network – and transformed all departments.\n\nIt has introduced new digital tools without which, Dr Manikowski maintains the business would have been unable to move.\n\nTransformation has included using AI to assess locations for new stores. Dr Manikowski reports Żabka has assessed almost 10 million addresses in Poland so it knows exactly where it has the biggest potential to grow and open new stores. Plus, the insight means it has 99% confidence in determining the overall store size, margin mix and future profitability of the individual franchisee, he adds.\n\nŻabka is also using AI to manage the assortment. This gives it control over 2,500 planograms and means it can tailor assortments for local customers, which can be different in Warsaw compared with a rural area, for example.\n\nThe retailer is also using digitalisation in the supply chain to predict and forecast demand; while automated replenishment processes in stores means franchisees are not impacted by the time spent on reordering.\n\nAI is also being deployed to manage pricing and promotional activity. “It creates competitive advantage because our value proposition is better tailored for franchisees and final customers,” says Dr Manikowski.\n\nCrucially digital transformation has created tools for both customers and franchisees, which are the two hearts of the Żabka business, Dr Manikowski says.\n\nNano unmanned stores\n\nŻabka Nano, an automated store solution, is one very visible outcome of the retailer’s digital transformation.\n\nToday there are 47 Nano stores, making it the biggest autonomous store chain in Europe.\n\nThe store experience is totally seamless, Dr Manikowski says. Customers enter either via an app or credit card, take products from the shelves, exit the store and then receive a receipt on their phone.\n\nThere are three unmanned store formats: Nano Indoor, a shop-in-shop solution for hypermarkets, larger stores and big office buildings; plus Nano Outdoor and Nano Brick-and-Mortar, which are both standalone concepts.\n\nAccording to Dr Manikowski, this format flexibility and an average store area of just 20sq m allows Żabka to unlock other locations, where it normally could not be present.\n\nThe format is also targeted at the younger population and designed to promote a fun shopping experience, Dr Manikowski says.\n\n“The assortment we are selling is slightly different but the technology is also technology that could not be easily replicated by competitors,” he adds.\n\nŻabka has partnered with AiFi, a startup from Silicon Valley, on the launch of Nano, which is a tailor-made solution that has been developed over a few years.\n\n“Other retailers are opening unmanned stores but only one or two because it’s difficult to replicate. The beauty of our concept is we have a solution, which we can replicate and guarantees high economic success of the stores,” Dr Manikowski says.\n\n“We will continue to open them because they are working and we are satisfied with first results but especially with NPS and customer satisfaction. The Nano stores also work much faster as a loyalty builder because customers can’t find this experience elsewhere.”\n\nFurther endorsement for the Nano concept came earlier this year at the NACS Convenience Summit Europe event in Berlin when Żabka was awarded the NACS European Convenience Retail Technology Award.\n\nSupply chain\n\nSupply chain innovation has been critical to Żabka’s growth, as Dr Manikowski states: “To sustain growth you need to have an extensive supply chain but logistics is one of the most difficult parts to nail.”\n\nFactor in the need to deliver goods to 8,400 stores, then it’s even more of a challenge.\n\nThe solutions? Eight distribution centres in Poland plus 19 cross docks. Half of Żabka’s deliveries are made directly from the DCs to stores, while the second half is made from the DCs to the cross docks and then on to stores.\n\nDr Manikowski also reveals that Żabka controls 98% of its deliveries – only 2% do not go through DCs, more local products selected by franchisees for their individual stores.\n\nOf course, digital transformation has transcended the supply chain too. Żabka operates a completely paperless system, which speeds the time taken for franchisees to accept deliveries. In addition, it has sophisticated forecasting tools, which are used by its own supply chain teams but also by external suppliers to help them prepare for peak sales etc.\n\n“We have sophisticated warehouse management systems and we are working on the transportation systems to make sure we are optimising the routes between the stores,” Dr Manikowski adds. “We are working on dedicated delivery for the stores too. These initiatives create efficiencies, which we can reinvest in value for our customers and franchisees; while also growing our top line as well.”\n\nŻabka has recently opened a new fully automated DC. Occupying 60,000sq m, it is currently serving 3,500 stores but has the capacity to serve 5,000 and, inline with the company’s ESG strategy, the site operates 100% on green energy.\n\nTransformation of responsibility\n\nŻabka puts a firm focus on its franchisee network, as well as embedding ESG within all of its operations.\n\nThe company views franchisees as its brand ambassadors and introduced a ‘franchisee centric’ approach a few years ago plus a raft of franchisee centric initiatives. These included automating store management and segmenting the assortment of stock. The retailer has also launched a state-of-the art cyberstore application, which enables its franchisees to manage all of the store activity from a smart phone. This provides visibility on ordering and live sales results from different product categories, for instance.\n\nDr Manikowski reports the business is also implementing ‘opti-plan’, a set of business tools which understand all the processes within a store and guide franchisees on the tasks they need to complete and at what time.\n\n“It means the store is run better and it makes franchisees more efficient,” he says.\n\nWith 7,000 franchisees, creating more than 45,000 retail jobs, Żabka acknowledges the important and crucial role it plays in the Polish economy and the need to support those crucial brand ambassadors.\n\n“The franchisee centric perspective helps us to maintain a high level of franchisee satisfaction,” Dr Manikowski says.\n\n“Żabka’s business model combines the traditional approach to retail, where the franchisee is a member of local community, with the most sophisticated tools, which help franchisees to run the store,” he says.\n\nŻabka’s third transformation pillar has focused on green and sustainable living.\n\n“Customers are more responsible in terms of choices and we want to encourage them to make proper and healthy consumption choices but also play a role as business and true member of society which cares about the environment and helps to grow local communities,” Dr Manikowski says.\n\nŻabka has a strong ESG agenda, which is embedded across the entire organisation and it’s important for both its customers and stakeholders.\n\nIt comprises four main pillars:\n\nSustainable lifestyles\n\nMindful business impact\n\nResponsible organisation and\n\nGreen planet\n\nEach pillar has its own flagship initiatives and selected commitments and targets.\n\nWithin sustainable lifestyles, for example, the retailer promotes healthy choices and has targets to double sales of healthy and sustainable own brand products by 2025.\n\nUnder Mindful business impact, Żabka was voted retailer of the Year by suppliers in 2020 and 2021 and is growing the company and suppliers’ businesses.\n\nAs a responsible organisation, the business boasts five times higher employee engagement than Poland’s average and is committed to improving transparency with regular ESG reviews and climate reporting.\n\nFor green planet, Żabka achieved plastic neutrality in 2020 and 2021 and aims to be climate neutral by 2025\n\nIts achievements across these diverse ESG fields have won the company numerous achievements. As in the technology space, actions at Żabka speak far louder than words.\n\nAs Dr Manikowski concludes: “We are not only talking but also doing.”"
