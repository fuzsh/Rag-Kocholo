        "text": "Champlain’s Criminology & Criminal Justice program’s dynamic curriculum combines foundational and skills-based courses such as criminal law, criminology, and police operations with a focus on social justice that addresses the changing nature of law enforcement and the larger criminal justice system and prepares you to become an ethical, service-minded leader.\n\nWhat is Criminology & Criminal Justice?\n\nThe study of criminology and criminal justice focuses on crime, criminal behavior, and the criminal justice system. It is concerned with the sociological and psychological reasons behind crime and the best ways society should respond to it.\n\nWhy Study Criminology & Criminal Justice at Champlain College?\n\nYou’ll learn by doing, right away. Thanks to our Upside-Down Curriculum, you’ll take criminal justice courses in your first year that set you up for later internships or field work. As you continue, you’ll gain practical professional experience within the local Burlington community—a national leader in forward-thinking criminal justice reform. You can work with current prison inmates through our Prison Law Initiative, helping them to learn to navigate some of the legal issues they face. You can also intern with local police departments, prosecutors, defense attorneys, or other social service agencies, gaining a wide perspective on the whole criminal justice field. And your training will be up-to-date: select classes are cross-listed with our Computer and Digital Forensics program, making sure you have a modern take on crime and safety.\n\nIn this interdisciplinary program that brings together both theory and practice, graduates will come away with a greater understanding of the role the criminal justice system plays throughout all facets of society, and they’ll be ready to get to work to make communities safer and effect lasting change to the system."
