        "text": "The recent reforms of the Polish Judiciary have sparked a lively debate in Europe on the importance of judicial independence. This Article deals with the new Polish system of selecting and appointing judges and critically assesses it in the light of European standards for judicial appointments. It then compares the new Polish system to the German system of selecting judges, which has been advanced as a point of reference for the reform by the Polish government. Finally, the Article reconsiders and challenges some of the established concepts of German constitutional law as to the selection of judges and judicial legitimacy.\n\nThe Article was closed on September 2, 2017 and accepted for publication. Subsequent developments could be included until March 15, 2018. The authors would like to thank Judge Thomas Guddat and the Deutsch-Polnische Richtervereinigung (Association of German and Polish Judges) for providing valuable details on the reforms in Poland.\n\n3 For illustrative purposes: It must first be emphasized in this regard that the European Economic Community is a Community based on the rule of law, inasmuch as neither its Member States nor its institutions can avoid a review of the question whether the measures adopted by them are in conformity with the basic constitutional charter, the Treaty.Google Scholar\n\nCase 294/83, Les Verts v. Eur. Par., 1986 E.C.R. 1339, para. 23.Google Scholar\n\n22 For example, an attendance quorum of eleven out of fifteen judges for certain decisions, the possibility for four judges to postpone any decision they are not satisfied with after an initial internal vote, and the required presence of the prosecutor general—who also happens to be the Minister of Justice—in order to hear certain types of cases.Google Scholar\n\n88 In the case at hand, the measures of salary cuts to the Portuguese Court of Auditors where part of a national scheme to meet the European requirements for reducing the Portuguese budget deficit, but they were in no way imposed or required by EU law and could therefore at best be considered to be European in their motivation only.Google Scholar"
