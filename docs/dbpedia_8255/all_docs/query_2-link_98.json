There are several reporting and withholding requirements employers need to fulfill with regard to social security contributions and income tax. Filing deadlines vary between authorities.\n\nTax considerations\n\nThe Polish tax system is relatively simple as it only consists of two tax rates, a 17% base rate and a high rate of 32%. In January 2022, the threshold dividing the two tax bands increased to PLN 120,000 (from PLN 85,528 in 2021). An additional solidarity surcharge of 4% is levied on annual income exceeding PLN 1,000,000.\n\nThere is a tax-free allowance which has recently (as of 2022) increased to PLN 30,000 per year as well as several tax credits and reliefs which need to be considered when determining the calculation base for income tax. The latter include a child relief, a standard employee tax deduction and more. There also is a new middle-class tax relief which will affect monthly income from PLN 5,701 to PLN 11,141 and which was introduced as part of the Polish Deal.\n\nEmployment income earned by employees under 26 is exempt from income tax - up to annual income of PLN 85,528 (valid for 2022 tax year) - unless they earn more than PLN 120,000 (in 2022) in which case the 32% rate applies. Benefits in kind are taxable while social security contributions are deductible - except for healthcare contributions.\n\nResident taxpayers pay tax on their worldwide income. Non-residents are only taxed for income earned in Poland. Residency in terms of income tax is determined via the 183-day rule. A person whose center of interests (work, life etc.) is in Poland is also considered a tax resident. There is no additional local income tax.\n\nTax withholding and reporting\n\nEmployers are responsible for calculating and withholding income tax from their employees’ salaries at source on a monthly basis. The local tax authority administering and collecting tax is the Urzad Skarbowy. Payments must be made to the employee’s individual tax account (so-called micro account linked to the employee’s PESEL number) no later than the 20th of the month following the pay period.\n\nThere is no monthly tax filing obligation. Instead, employers file a cumulative electronic annual income tax return (PIT-4R) by 31 January of the following year, plus an annual account for each employee (PIT-11). This one must be sent to the authority as well as to the employee.\n\nThe monthly income tax withholdings only count as advance tax payments. Therefore, employees are obligated to file their personal tax return by 30 April of the following year and settle the difference between the amount paid and the total amount due. Married couples can either file a joint or separate tax return. The tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.\n\nSocial security contributions\n\nSocial security contributions are levied on both employee and employer while the latter pays the bigger share. The competent authority is the ZUS. Contributions go towards several social security funds which mainly cover retirement, disability, sickness and work accidents. In total, employers currently contribute between 14.93% and 17.86% while the employee share of the social security contributions is 13.71% - excluding health insurance (see below).\n\nPension and disability contributions are only levied on the part of the employee’s annual income which does not exceed 30 times the national average salary. For 2022, the annual salary threshold is set at PLN 177,660.\n\nThe contribution rate to the work accidents insurance depends on the business activity as well as on the number of employees. Foreign employers as well as local employers with less than 9 employees pay a 1.67% flat rate while locally incorporated businesses with over 9 employees pay between 0.67% and 3.6%.\n\nThere also is a 9% healthcare contribution which is payable by the employee and which must be taken out of the employee’s wages before calculating the other social contributions. Additional minor contributions are made by the employer to the National Labor Fund and the Wage Guarantee Fund. From January 2021, it is mandatory for most employers to set up an additional retirement savings plan (Pracowniczy Plan Kapitałowy, short: PKK) to which they contribute 1.5% of the employee’s monthly salary. Employees pay a 2% contribution unless they decide to opt out.\n\nIt is the employer’s responsibility to calculate and withhold the employee’s share of the social security contributions and remit the withheld amount to the ZUS along with their own contributions. Payments must be made monthly. The due date is the 15th of the following month.\n\nEmployers further have to prepare and file a monthly (ZUS DRA) as well as an annual social security declaration (ZUS IWA) which lists the total amount of contributions paid in that particular month or year - annual returns are only mandatory for businesses with more than 10 employees. The due date for the monthly return is the same as for the payments. There are several forms that need to be filled out, including a separate declaration for sickness-related absences. The annual return is due by 31 January of the following year. All declarations must be made via the Platnik platform.\n\nCompanies employing more than 25 employees are required to make monthly contributions to the Rehabilitation of Disabled People Fund (PFRON). The rate varies depending on a number of factors and is updated on a quarterly basis. A separate monthly declaration must be filed via a dedicated online system. Payments are due on the 20th of the following month. The due date for the annual PFRON declaration is 20 January of the next year.\n\n* The exact rate depends on the business activity and the number of insured employees.\n\n** Does not apply to foreign employers."
