        "text": "The Faculty has always had a commitment to teaching law in its social context and to engaging the contemporary challenges of our time. That means that we aim to deliver a well-rounded education beyond lectures, seminars and tutorials. As students of law and criminology, conversations about politics and society are crucial to everyday education and to building community on campus.\n\nHow can the Faculty of Law & Justice create space for these conversations? By launching the inaugural +Justice Festival!\n\nStarting in 2023, we will select an annual theme for the Festival and then invite suggestions from staff and students about art and literature – all kinds of books and films, poems and artworks, live performances and exhibitions – that speak to the theme.\n\nThe idea behind the +Justice Festival is to get us all thinking broadly about how cultural texts – novels, comedy, music, poems, artworks, TV shows, podcasts, dance – connect to both the +Justice theme and to studying law and criminology. We want to generate intellectual connections amongst students and between students and staff.\n\nThe Festival is not an extra assignment! There are definitely no final exams or class participation marks up for grabs! The Festival is an invitation to each and every student to hold next-level conversations, to listen, to think, to talk, and to reflect.\n\nIn 2023 we are organising events that will bring us all together, face to face and on campus, to discuss two major contemporary issues: the referendum on a First Nations Voice to parliament; and the politics of climate change."
