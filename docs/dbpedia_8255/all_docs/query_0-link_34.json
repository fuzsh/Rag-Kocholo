        "text": "Northeastern Illinois University’s Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Justice Studies program gives students the opportunity to examine the social and historical roots of justice, crime, and the law. Students seek to discover how these roots have shaped public policies, including those of the criminal justice system, and study systematic explanations for the failure—or triumph—of justice in society and explore the potential for transformative justice.\n\nThrough critical inquiry, social science investigation, and experiential learning, Justice Studies students develop an understanding of social and economic justice issues and critical criminology. For instance, criminology examines the structural roots of crime and takes up the legal and social concerns of diverse, urban, low-income, and disenfranchised communities, whose members are often heavily targeted by the criminal justice system.\n\nJustice Studies Courses\n\nAll Justice Studies majors take six required courses plus eighteen credit hours of electives. Required classes include:\n\nIntroduction To Social Justice\n\nWriting Intensive Program: Justice And Inequality\n\nTheories Of Justice And Social Change\n\nResearch Methods In Justice Studies\n\nPracticum In Justice Studies\n\nField Work Seminar\n\nSome of the fascinating elective courses available in the Justice Studies Program include:\n\nTheories Of Criminal Behavior\n\nThis class covers theories of crime from the classical school to currently popular viewpoints, including Marxist and radical theories, with emphasis on the relationship between theory and criminal justice policy formulation.\n\nWhite Collar Crime & Elite Deviance\n\nThis course examines the problems of defining crimes of the elite, theories related to white collar crime and elite deviance, and the impact of white-collar crime on society and justice.\n\nSee the full Justice Studies major requirements and all Justice Studies course descriptions.\n\nThe NEIU Student Experience\n\nStudents in the Justice Studies program have a wide array of activities, clubs, and resources available to them.\n\nYou’re Not Just a Number\n\nEvery Justice Studies major is assigned an advisor to help with understanding the curriculum's requirements so as to make responsible choices about selecting courses.

The program is a logical stepping stone for students who plan to go on to law school.\n\nThe following Justice Studies elective courses are just some of the classes that prove beneficial in preparing for the LSAT examination:\n\nCommunity Law\n\nLegal Research and Bibliography in Criminal Law\n\nLaw and Racism in America\n\nCriminal Law and Procedure\n\nLegal Process I\n\nSociology of Law\n\nFind out more about Pre-Law at NEIU.\n\nImmerse Yourself in Justice Studies at NEIU\n\nThe Justice Studies major is unique in that its foundational basis is social justice, and starts from the perspective of the poor, socially disenfranchised, minority populations, women, refugees, and communities victimized socially, politically, and economically. The department makes a special effort to involve and serve community groups, specifically disadvantaged minorities and women."
