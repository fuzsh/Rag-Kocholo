        "text": "Time flies, and the pages of our calendar are turning swiftly. It feels like just yesterday we released our April summary, and yet here we are, under the bright sun, ready to dive into the data for May. Let’s take a look at how Poland’s mobile operators stacked up in terms of speed and quality of mobile Internet during this period.\n\nLast month, users of the RFBENCHMARK mobile app carried out a total of 413,585 measurements*.\n\nREAD ALSO: Mobile Internet in Poland – A big summary of 2023\n\nIn our latest report, we noted 82,729 measurements conducted using 5G technology, making up 20% of all mobile network quality and speed tests in Poland. By comparison, 322,784 measurements were carried out on the 4G LTE network.\n\nAs for operator popularity in April, the Orange network led with 33.4% of total measurements. Play was just slightly behind with 32.4%, while Plus and T-Mobile were evenly matched, each claiming 17.1% of the measurements.\n\nWant to help create more rankings? Download our mobile app for free and join the community!\n\n* The data covers the period 5-31.05.2024\n\nMobile Internet in Poland – What was the situation like in April 2024?\n\nIn April 2024, T-Mobile continued to dominate the 5G services market, leading with an average download speed of 274.3 Mbps. This marked the third consecutive month at the top for T-Mobile in this category. Orange held onto second place with a noteworthy performance, achieving 250.7 Mbps, just over the 250 Mbps threshold. Following them were Play and Plus, with speeds of 156.7 Mbps and 145.4 Mbps, respectively.\n\nIn the category of average 5G upload speeds, Orange maintained its top spot with 52.8 Mbps, narrowly edging out T-Mobile, which posted 52.4 Mbps. Play came in at 48.5 Mbps, while Plus rounded out the group with 29.7 Mbps. Play also recorded the lowest ping value at 23 ms, showing an improvement from March.\n\nIn the 4G LTE segment, T-Mobile continued to lead the pack, posting the highest average download speed of 46.2 Mbps, significantly outpacing its competitors. Play secured second place with 41.3 Mbps, followed by Orange at 38.8 Mbps. Plus came in last with a speed of 37.4 Mbps.\n\nWhen it comes to average 4G LTE upload speeds, Play claimed the top spot with 23.6 Mbps, surpassing T-Mobile’s 20.7 Mbps and Orange’s 20.0 Mbps. Plus trailed at the end again, with an upload speed of 18.7 Mbps. The lowest ping value in the 4G LTE category was recorded by Play at 29 ms, outperforming Orange’s 33.1 ms, T-Mobile’s 35.2 ms, and Plus’s 38.2 ms.\n\nSee what mobile Internet looked like in April 2024\n\n5G performance\n\nEditor’s note: When deploying C-Band technology, which significantly boosts maximum Internet speeds, it’s important to remember that operators might impose speed limits on their users. This could impact the rankings.\n\nAverage data download speed: Orange (245.6 Mbps)\n\nIn May, Orange led the pack in the average 5G download speed category with a remarkable 245.6 Mbps. T-Mobile, previously at the forefront, followed in second place with 160 Mbps. The remaining positions were claimed by Play with 150.5 Mbps and Plus with 144.6 Mbps.\n\nAverage data upload speed: Orange (47.9 Mbps)\n\nThis month, Orange also topped the average 5G upload speeds, achieving 47.9 Mbps. Play was close behind with 46.1 Mbps, surpassing T-Mobile’s 39.5 Mbps. Plus rounded out the group with 28.8 Mbps.\n\nCompared to last month, Orange continues to lead, while Play advanced to second place, with T-Mobile and Plus experiencing a drop in their upload speeds.\n\nLowest ping value: Play (23.0 ms)\n\nMay’s competition for the lowest ping in 5G networks was tight. Play secured the best performance with a ping of 23.0 ms, just edging out Orange’s 23.1 ms. T-Mobile came in third with 26.8 ms, followed by Plus at 28.4 ms.\n\nLower ping values, indicating quicker network response times, are essential for activities requiring low latency, such as online gaming and video conferencing.\n\n4G LTE performance\n\nAverage data download speed: T-Mobile (41 Mbps)\n\nIn May, T-Mobile showcased its strength in the 4G LTE segment by recording an average download speed of 41 Mbps, securing the top spot in the rankings. Close behind was Play, with a speed of 40.7 Mbps. Orange followed with 39.4 Mbps, positioning it in third place, while Plus came in last with 37 Mbps.\n\nAverage data upload speed: Play (22.7 Mbps)\n\nFor upload speeds, Play took the lead in May with 22.7 Mbps. T-Mobile followed closely with 19.8 Mbps, just edging out Orange, which registered a speed of 19.6 Mbps. Plus rounded out the rankings with 18 Mbps.\n\nLowest ping value: Play (29.1 ms)\n\nFocusing on the lowest LTE ping values, May’s results highlighted Play as the top performer with a ping of 29.1 ms. Orange was slightly slower at 29.8 ms, followed by T-Mobile at 34.5 ms, and Plus, which had the highest ping at 37.3 ms.\n\nThis category saw no significant changes from previous months, reinforcing Play’s position as the most responsive operator in terms of network latency.\n\n5G/4G LTE Leaderboard\n\nHow did we collect data for the ranking?\n\nThe measurements are collected from the users of our mobile app. It allows us to measure basic mobile network parameters – including signal level and quality depending on the technology used by the mobile device, information about the mobile network operator, or the country where the smartphone is located. In addition, on-demand measurements of data download and upload speeds, as well as a latency test, are performed.\n\nWhen the app notices a low-quality voice call, lack of mobile Internet service, or other services, it has the ability to report the user’s current position where the problem occurred.\n\nHelp us create the report on the quality and speed of mobile Internet in Poland!"
