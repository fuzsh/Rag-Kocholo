        "text": "Propaganda and promotion of favored narratives\n\nKey narratives\n\nIn early 2020, Chinese state media increasingly worked to proactively shape public discourse surrounding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Chinese government’s public health response. A media analysis conducted in the first half of 2020 found that Polish audiences were generally receptive to Beijing’s early pandemic “charm offensive,” with government officials and public health experts praising the efficacy of lockdowns in China and responding positively to Chinese donations and sales of medical supplies. CCP messaging first focused on shifting blame for mismanagement of the initial outbreak of COVID-19 from the Chinese government to the United States. Beijing later sought to use the pandemic as an opportunity to discredit the United States and highlight its perceived decline as a global power, while simultaneously portraying China as a responsible international partner.\n\nA content analysis of CRI Poland’s commentaries related to COVID-19 and China by the research group MapInfluenCE found that a majority of the texts surveyed mentioned the United States’ decline and its “Cold War mentality,” while roughly a third argued that China was being unfairly stigmatized or was a victim of fake news. Ten percent of the analyzed commentaries referenced a debunked conspiracy theory linking the origins of COVID-19 to the US military’s biological laboratory facility at Fort Detrick. In terms of more positive messaging themes, a significant proportion of commentaries mentioned China’s good practices in responding to the pandemic (35 percent), its contributions to international cooperation (41 percent), and its aid to developing countries (23 percent).\n\nThe Chinese state media narratives on COVID-19 represented a refining of the CCP’s long-term propaganda strategy to “tell China’s story well” and actively shape global discourses, but the 2019 prodemocracy protests in Hong Kong had triggered an earlier, catalyzing shift toward this more aggressive global media strategy. Local media analysts noticed a significant evolution in Chinese state media tactics across Central and Eastern Europe in response to the Hong Kong protests and Beijing’s related crackdown. In Poland, then ambassador Liu Guangyuan published more frequent op-eds in the left-wing daily Trybuna and the conservative-leaning mainstream daily Rzeczpospolita on the topic of Hong Kong. Signed articles by the Chinese ambassador—first on Hong Kong, but then on other topics as well—also began to appear in the widely read online news portal Onet.\n\nAs in other countries, Chinese state media strongly promoted the benefits of bilateral and multilateral economic cooperation as a path toward “win-win” development, particularly through the 16+1 China-CEEC framework and the BRI. Chinese diplomats and state media sought to tailor this messaging for local audiences by repeatedly highlighting alleged synergies between China’s 2021–25 14th Five-Year Plan (FYP) and Poland’s post-pandemic recovery plan, dubbed the Polish Order (Polski Ład), although this messaging was skeptically received. After assuming his position in September 2021, the new Chinese ambassador to Poland, Sun Linjiang, emphasized the same point in his first published opinion piece.\n\nThere was a notable gap in Chinese state media coverage in Poland. Huawei and its potential security risks to telecommunications infrastructure, including 5G networks, were a major headline topic in 2019, especially following the high-profile arrests of a Huawei Poland sales executive and a senior Polish cybersecurity expert on accusations of espionage. However, while Chinese diplomats and state media published a variety of content opposing the exclusion of Chinese companies from 5G development, they were silent on the topic of the arrests. Local and international journalists drew comparisons between the Polish Huawei arrests and the high-profile case of Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei chief financial officer whose 2018 detention in Canada caused serious diplomatic friction between Ottawa and Beijing. But a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson downplayed any link between the two cases when asked about the outstanding espionage case three years later. Although there was some critical commentary in the CCP-owned English-language tabloid Global Times, more localized media outlets such as CRI Poland did not discuss the scandal.\n\nKey avenues of content dissemination\n\nCRI Poland: CRI opened a Warsaw office in 2006 and officially maintains two journalists there. CRI Poland is the only Chinese state media entity that produces content in Polish, though content from the official Xinhua news agency is also translated and reprinted by public and private Polish media groups. CRI began broadcasting in Polish in 1968 and continues to do so for an hour each day via shortwave radio (6020 kHz and 7305 kHz). However, its radio news programming is minimal. A more significant vector for content delivery is CRI’s Polish website, which was started in 2003 and hosts print, video, and audio content. CRI Poland also set up a Facebook page in 2012, and the platform has since labeled it as “China state-controlled media.”\n\nCRI Poland’s social media activity is robust. It is a regular source of content that downplays Chinese human rights abuses, or that is aimed at promoting anti-West and anti-US sentiment. Such recurring narratives are interspersed with softer, positive stories focused on China and other countries. CRI Poland posts multiple times a day on Facebook and had more than 320,000 followers as of February 2022. That count represented an expansion of more than 25 percent from September 2021, when the @redakcjapolska account had just under a quarter of a million followers. This rapid growth, combined with low engagement rates on individual posts, raises some suspicions about the authenticity of its followers.\n\nSimilarly, CRI’s Polish website promotes positive state propaganda talking points on topics such as Xinjiang, the Beijing Olympics, and COVID-19. While some articles can be described as more objective news reporting, others, particularly the mostly unattributed pieces posted to the Commentaries section, replicate more blatantly misleading narratives, including the false claim that COVID-19 originated in Fort Detrick, or a February 2022 assertion that the United States was the main instigator of the crisis in Ukraine. The website also features short video content in Polish that attempts to present a benign and friendly perspective on China, including some videos that feature a young, female presenter who speaks fluent Polish. A media analysis of CRI Poland’s messaging on COVID-19 and China found that CRI commentaries often selectively cited Russian or other foreign media sources to bolster their claims. The same analysis noted that the average number of total monthly visits to the Polish CRI website was less than 50,000, and that more than 45 percent of the website traffic had been referrals from the CRI Esperanto webpage, suggesting inauthentic activity.\n\nDiplomatic communications in print, online, and social media: Liu Guangyuan, then the Chinese ambassador to Poland, joined Twitter in March 2020 and almost immediately engaged in a highly public debate with US counterpart Georgette Mosbacher. Both sides accused the other of politicizing the pandemic and spreading disinformation. In an interview with the Global Times, Liu said that in information battles with US diplomats, “we do not shoot first, but we must shoot the last gunshot. We will not hold back until we gain complete victory.” Liu and Mosbacher’s exchange was noted by media analysts but did not gain wider traction among the Polish public.\n\nThe Chinese embassy played a significant role in disseminating Chinese state propaganda narratives regarding the pandemic. For example, in February 2020, the embassy held a press briefing on COVID-19, and later sent a 30-page document to Polish journalists titled “Facts Refuting American Myths about the Coronavirus and China.”\n\nDuring the coverage period, the Chinese embassy increased its engagement with print and online media outlets. The 70th anniversary of Sino-Polish diplomatic relations was the occasion for a media blitz in 2019 that included a special insert published in the niche English-language magazine Polish Market. However, an advertorial insert published in the print version popular daily Rzeczpospolita in December 2018 sparked some pushback from readers who saw it as an overt example of authoritarian propaganda. Since then, Freedom House was not able to find evidence of any mainstream media outlets publishing inserts from Chinese state media. Ambassador Liu wrote on a variety of topics during his 2018–21 tenure, ranging from the Chinese state’s actions in Hong Kong to 5G and the BRI. Liu published at least 27 signed articles in Polish news outlets and was interviewed at least eight times from 2019 to 2021. His replacement, Sun Linjiang, has had a smaller media presence to date. Ambassador Sun did not have a personal Twitter account at the time of writing and published a handful of signed articles in Trybuna and Onet after taking office in September 2021.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Warsaw appears to have close ties with the fringe left-wing outlet Trybuna, which has published diplomatic op-eds as well as dozens of translated—and frequently unattributed—articles from CRI and Xinhua. A social media influencer who runs the blog Chiny to Lubię (“China, I like it”), which had more than 17,500 followers on Facebook as of September 2021, has also frequently published interviews with embassy staff or covered embassy events. Alongside CRI Poland’s content featuring the Polish-speaking presenter “Oliwia,” the embassy’s cooperation with freelance journalists represents a creative use of online and social media (or “new media,” in the terminology of Chinese state media strategists) to spread Beijing-friendly content.\n\nPartnerships with Polish public media: Chinese state media entities have signed cooperation agreements with public print and broadcast media in Poland. A content-sharing agreement between the PAP and Xinhua was signed in 2017, and the PAP sometimes posts content branded as “Xinhua Silk Road” that is noticeably replete with terminology found in CCP propaganda. Other articles cite reporting from Xinhua in their text but are less clear about directly labeling the pieces’ origins. Also in 2017, designated as the year of China-CEE media cooperation, the state-owned Polish broadcaster TVP signed a cooperation agreement with Chengdu Radio and Television that included coproduction of a documentary on the New Silk Road (also known as the BRI) focusing on enhanced linkages between the sister cities of Łódź and Chengdu. A TVP board member said the project was chiefly directed at Chinese audiences and emphasized Poland as a successful example of the developing transit links between China and Western Europe—a strategic priority of the BRI.\n\nAdoption of Chinese state media narratives by Polish opinion makers: Some Polish journalists, politicians, and academics known to be relatively friendly toward Beijing have echoed CCP talking points, and they have at times been quoted in Chinese state media, creating an appearance of Polish support for Chinese government positions. The editor in chief of Rzeczpospolita, for instance, has been open about his positive opinion of CCP leaders, calling Xi Jinping a “great reformer,” and the outlet has published friendly interviews with Chinese officials. While Rzeczpospolita was criticized for platforming Chinese state propaganda when it published a one-off advertorial insert in 2018, the newspaper has also published pieces that would be viewed unfavorably by Beijing, including an interview with Taiwanese foreign minister Joseph Wu.\n\nPrior to 2020, journalists from Poland regularly participated in subsidized press trips to China—including those organized via the 16+1 China-CEEC framework—that were sponsored by either the Chinese state or Huawei. By and large, these trips and others for members of Polish civil society did not yield significant media coverage back home. However, following one visit to Xinjiang that took place in the first half of 2019, a member of the nonprofit group Dom Polski (Polish House) was cited in a Xinhua English-language article under the headline “Foreign Scholars Impressed by Stability, Prosperity in Xinjiang.”\n\nAmong politicians, left-wing lawmaker and head of the Sino-Polish Parliamentary Group Andrzej Szejna has often praised the CCP’s governance. Szejna was also a vocal opponent of excluding Huawei from the Polish market and “starting a trade war with China,” and has said in interviews with CRI Poland that Chinese politics are “human-centered” and “a good proposal for Poland and Europe.” He has been criticized by Polish media for spreading Chinese propaganda.\n\nChinese state links to Polish publishing house: Since 2012 the Marszałek Publishing Group (MPG), which is the largest publisher of China-related books in Poland, has been owned by the Chinese state-owned Anhui Publishing Group, and its catalogue only covers topics that are approved by Chinese state censors—including translations of books by Xi Jinping. Because other sources of Polish-language translations of Chinese texts are limited, the nature of MPG’s ownership and editorial line serves as an important vector for spreading pro-CCP narratives in Poland, although critical texts on Chinese politics, economics, and history, translated from other languages exist as well.\n\nSeveral other avenues for Chinese state media influence in Poland also exist, but their reach and impact are likely more limited. China Central Television (CCTV) is available in Chinese via free-to-air broadcasts, while the English-language China Global Television Network (CGTN) can be accessed via satellite services. In addition to the two journalists working for CRI Poland, the Polish Foreign Ministry has documented five other Chinese state media journalists working in the country. Apart from the embassy’s outreach to friendly media and thought leaders, some Polish journalists also reported being solicited by Huawei to write favorable pieces in both public and private outlets. A think tank expert on Sino-Polish relations said she was asked leading questions when contacted by China Daily to comment on the CCP’s centenary celebrations in June 2021.\n\nDisinformation campaigns\n\nNo significant disinformation campaigns were found to have targeted or reached news consumers in Poland during the coverage period. For the purposes of this report, disinformation is defined as the purposeful dissemination of false or misleading content, especially through inauthentic activity—via fake accounts, for example—on global social media platforms. Although researchers have reported some anecdotal evidence of inauthentic follower growth and behavior on Chinese state media accounts, there have been no forensic social media analyses or in-depth studies measuring such activity in Poland. CRI Poland has repeatedly been the focus of suspicious activity. For example, a recent Polish-language video promoted on CRI Poland’s Facebook page attracted a relatively high amount of engagement (126 likes within three days of posting), but many of the accounts that interacted with the post appeared to be fake.\n\nCensorship and intimidation\n\nThere were no reported instances of the Chinese embassy in Warsaw or other Chinese state-linked agents attempting to censor journalists in Poland during the coverage period. However, the chief Beijing correspondent for Polish public radio (Polskie Radio), Tomasz Sajewicz, has described multiple instances in which he was physically blocked by security forces or officials from reporting on news stories in China.\n\nIn September 2019, when the controversial right-wing YouTube channel Idź pod Prąd (Against the Tide) organized a peaceful protest against a Chinese embassy event to raise awareness about CCP censorship of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, it was disrupted by counterprotesters who may have been embassy employees. A freelance journalist affiliated with the same group has claimed that she was banned from attending an embassy press event during Xi Jinping’s 2016 visit to Poland after previously writing articles critical of the CCP. Apart from this, no journalists reported any efforts by Chinese state-linked actors to block such reporting, and in practice Polish journalists covered a variety of topics in ways that were contrary to Chinese state media narratives, including environmental degradation in China, forced labor and human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and national security concerns related to Huawei’s presence in Poland. In fact, as noted above, the Chinese embassy offered only very limited responses to local controversies such as the arrest of the Huawei employee on espionage charges in 2019.\n\nControl over content distribution infrastructure\n\nHuawei has been present in the Polish telecommunications infrastructure market since 2006, and most Polish telecom operators use Huawei equipment. Polish legislators have drafted an amendment to the country’s existing cybersecurity law that would include new mechanisms to assess and exclude “high-risk” vendors from the Polish market, and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has promoted the idea of “European 5G realism.” Although Huawei’s share of the Polish mobile market fell after US export controls affected its global sales in 2019, Chinese companies still made up almost 30 percent of smartphone sales in Poland in the fourth quarter of 2020. TikTok, a global subsidiary of the Beijing-based social media company ByteDance, was one of the 10 most downloaded mobile applications in Poland in 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\nThere have been some documented cases around the world in recent years of TikTok removing or downplaying politically sensitive content, including content that violates domestic Chinese censorship guidelines, although the company has subsequently reported correcting errors. A media report from June 2022 based on leaked TikTok meetings raised concern that statements made by ByteDance regarding data privacy of US users was false, and more broadly called into question other statements the company has made regarding its policies. Nevertheless, there was no evidence in Poland during the coverage period of control over content-distribution infrastructure being used to marginalize critical content or amplify pro-Beijing content.\n\nDissemination of CCP media norms, tactics, or governance models\n\nThere was no evidence during the coverage period that Polish media professionals received trainings aimed at disseminating Beijing’s information-control tactics and norms or were otherwise convinced to adopt CCP-style media governance models.\n\nChinese diaspora media\n\nThe Chinese expatriate and diaspora community in Poland is small, probably numbering fewer than 8,000 people, and until the pandemic a significant proportion of the community was made up of students. There do not seem to be any significant independent Chinese-language media in Poland. A sizable Chinese community can be found in the village of Wólka Kosowska near Warsaw, and the most influential Chinese-language print media outlet is the Polish edition of European Times (欧洲时报), which was established in 2016 with a stated mandate to “tell China’s story well.”\n\nA number of other Chinese-language media in Poland—including “new media” (新媒体) outlets—were highlighted at the 2019 World Chinese Media Forum, jointly organized by the State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, the Hebei Provincial People’s Government, and China News Service, a state news agency. They included European Youth News (欧洲青年报), a weekly paper funded by the United Front–linked Polish Chinese Youth Federation (波兰华人青年联合会), and the digital outlet Chiny w Polsce (波兰壮阔, Bolan Zhuangkuo), which is active on the Chinese social media platforms WeChat and Weibo but did not have a working website at the time of writing. Both European Youth News and a newspaper called Polish Global Weekly (波兰环球周报) are members of the Global Chinese Media Cooperation Union (世界华文媒体合作联盟), an organization overseen by China News Service. Polish Global Weekly has a free print circulation of around 3,000 and an online version. It cooperates with the Polish Overseas Chinese Federation and the Polish Fujian Association, and in 2011 it signed a content-sharing agreement with Zhejiang News Network (浙报集团).\n\nFinally, an online forum called “Portal internetowy dla Chińczyków w Polsce” hosts information on tourism, visa procedures, government regulations, job recruitment, and other topics relevant to Chinese diaspora members in Poland, including some commentary on current affairs. Based on a brief review by Freedom House, none of the news sources listed above published content that contradicted or was critical of official Chinese state media narratives."
