        "text": "Corporate Governance (BUSN-340) 3 credits\n\nPut simply, corporate governance refers to the myriad ways in which companies are directed and controlled. This course will study corporate governance systems in the United States (primarily), but will also survey corporate governance structures abroad by way of comparison. We will study the legal and practical systems for the exercise of power and control in the conduct of the business of a corporation, including in particular the relationships among the shareholders, the board of directors and its committees, the executive officers, and other constituencies (including employees, communities, major customers and suppliers, and \"society\"). As one author has noted: \"If the companies in which wealth is accumulated are poorly governed, if their resources are inefficiently used, if their managements are inept or if the power of their management becomes channeled in a way which conflicts with the company's interests, all stakeholders and society suffer, not just the 'owners' of the enterprise. It is therefore important that within every company there are means of ensuring that resources are used efficiently and in a manner that ensures the achievement of the company's objectives and its ability to contribute to the common good.\" The International Task Force on Corporate Governance of the International Capital Markets Group, International Corporate Governance: Who Holds the Reigns? 1 (1995). These questions are timeless ones, but they are also timely given the current rash of disclosures of corporate malfeasance at companies such as Enron, World-Com, and others. This course is recommended for those students pursuing an interest in business and/or commercial law, as well as those students interested in issues of corporate accountability more generally.\n\nPrerequisite: Business Entities (BUSN-300).\n\nCorporate Law Appellate Litigation (BUSN-370) 3 credits\n\nThe course uses Delaware corporate law and the Delaware Supreme Court as its laboratory. Each student experiences the roles of appellate attorney, both in the preparation for and the carrying out of, mock oral arguments before the Delaware Supreme Court. Each student also experiences the role of Supreme Court justice in preparing for and writing final opinions in the same case. These simulations occur in connection with one or two recent or pending Delaware Supreme Court cases. Students study the actual briefs and appellate record, and are instructed to carry out their work as both advocates and justices with the same skill, diligence and ethics as is observed in the best practices of actual appellate litigators and jurists.\n\nThe course focuses on Delaware because it is the “home” for two-thirds of this nation’s publicly-traded companies. As a result, Delaware’s Supreme Court receives a steady stream of significant cases which are briefed and argued by America’s most skilled appellate advocates. The Delaware Supreme Court jurists, and the judges on the Court of Chancery from which its appeals are taken, are universally recognized as the nation’s most knowledgeable and skilled business law jurists. Consequently, the Delaware Supreme Court is to corporate law practitioners as the U.S. Supreme Court is to constitutional law specialists - not only the most prestigious practice venue, but also the best place to learn the “ins and outs” of both substantive corporate law and appellate litigation. This course should be of particular interest to any student interested in a commercial litigation, appellate litigation, or corporate law practice (whether transactional or litigation--oriented).\n\nMeetings and Arguments\n\nThe class is structured to simulate actual law practice and the actual work of Supreme Court jurists (and appellate jurists more generally). In order to adequately prepare for their role as mock oral advocate and mock jurist, each student must develop effective strategies for independently and collaboratively organizing and managing legal work. To assess and facilitate this learning, class generally meet individually or in small groups with the instructor during regular class time and at other times mutually convenient to the instructor and students, rather than in a large class setting. Accordingly, if the assigned class time is not your best time for meeting, arrangement can usually be made for a different time or day. These weekly meetings focus on developing each student’s understanding of the nature of the litigation process from trial court decision to completed Supreme Court opinion, the role of the various actors in that process, and the requirements that ethics and best practices demand of these actors. Finally, these meetings are utilized for ongoing student self-assessment.\n\nEvaluation and Grading\n\nThe final grade is based the instructor’s assessment and evaluation of the student’s professional skills in connection with: (1) work in preparation for mock oral arguments as advocate and as justice; (2) work in preparation for writing a final opinion in the role of Supreme Court justice; (3) conduct of oral argument as advocate; and (4) written work produced, including mock opinions.\n\nPre or co-requisite: Business Entities (BUSN-300).\n\nThis course counts toward the professional skills requirement.\n\nCritical Race Theory (JURS-359) 3 credits\n\nThroughout American history, race has profoundly affected the lives of individuals, the growth of social institutions, the substance of culture, and the workings of political economy. This impact is substantially mediated through the law and legal institutions. Understanding the interconnections between race and law, and particularly the ways in which race and law are mutually constitutive, is an extraordinary intellectual challenge. This course takes up this challenge by exploring the emergence and growth of Critical Race Theory (CRT). CRT refers to a surge of legal scholarship, starting in the late 1980s and blossoming in the 1990s, that focused on the role of race and racism in law and society. CRT recasts the role of law as historically central to and complicit in upholding racial hierarchy as well as hierarchies of gender, class, and sexual orientation, among other others. This course will trace the intellectual history of CRT through essential writings that mark its emergence and development. The course will explore key concepts associated with CRT and examine the specific analytic frameworks critical race theorists deploy to discuss the uses and meanings of race in legal institutions, politics and ideology. The course will also examine some of the questions and criticisms raised about CRT, from both inside and outside the genre, as well as the impact of the work on legal and political discourses. The central agenda of the course is an exploration of race itself — what exactly is race? — and the role law plays in constructing race and alternatingly ameliorating and perpetuating racism.\n\nThe course will be run like a seminar. Each class will be a round-table discussion of the assigned reading for the day. Each student will write a 20-page research paper on a topic of the student’s choice. Final grade will be based on participation in class discussions and the research paper.\n\nNo prerequisites.\n\nHomeless Rights Advocacy Clinic: Spring Semester (ADVC-445) 2 - 3 credits (new students = 3 credits; continuing students = 2 credits)\n\nDo you want to make a difference on one of the most pressing challenges our region faces? Do you want to polish your research, analysis, and communication skills? The Homeless Rights Advocacy Project’s clinic is an introduction to social justice advocacy in the context of legal and policy issues relating to homelessness. Through this clinic, 2L and 3L students receive an assignment from a community client on a pressing issue, perform research and analysis, and deliver a well-researched policy brief on the topic. Some of these policy briefs become eligible to be published and publicly released as part of the Homeless Rights Advocacy Project's prestigious library.\n\nThe HRAP Clinic’s learning objectives are grounded in lawyering practice and social justice.\n\nHRAP students learn how policy issues arise, how to perform legal and factual research and analysis, and how to effectively advocate for policy changes in written and oral form. Students are graded on professionalism, class participation (including research and other out-of-class assignments), oral presentations, and a written policy brief.\n\nSpecific learning objectives covered in this clinic include understanding, practicing, and applying the following:\n\nLegal research and analyses relating to homeless rights, including constitutional, civil, and human rights issues.\n\nThe planning, development, and management of a complex research project related to a specific policy advocacy position.\n\nThe hallmarks of effective policy advocacy documents.\n\nSubstantive, strategic, and structural similarities and differences between policy advocacy documents and the other types of legal writing (and understanding some of the reasons for these similarities and differences).\n\nThe creation of effective visual aids such as PowerPoints, graphs, and tables.\n\nThe art of persuasive oral presentations to advance policy advocacy positions.\n\nTechniques to plan and progress through successive drafts of their research and analysis into a final draft with descriptive and persuasive elements.\n\nThe HRAP clinic’s unique structure ensures the development of credible, highly regarded policy briefs.\n\nUnlike other 6-credit clinics that occur over a single semester, HRAP students may elect to take the HRAP clinic:\n\nfor the fall semester only;\n\nfor the full academic year by continuing in the spring semester; or\n\nfor the spring semester only.\n\nThe client research projects begin in the Fall semester, and the Fall cohort does the bulk of the work on the client project during that time. However, in order for a draft policy brief to meet HRAP’s high standards for publicly release, HRAP projects must be developed for two semesters total — both the fall and spring semester — to eligible to become policy briefs that are published and publicly released as part of the Homeless Rights Advocacy Project's prestigious library. In other words, while the Fall semester represents the bulk of the work on the client project, HRAP standards require that some additional and careful work be done (either by continuing students from the Fall cohort or by new students in the Spring cohort) on the client projects during the Spring semester.\n\nThe Fall cohort students focus on:\n\nCompleting the vast majority of research on their specific client issue\n\nAttempting or completing a certain number of client and fact/expert interviews\n\nDelivering a practice oral presentation and a final oral presentation on their analysis\n\nDeveloping some rudimentary visual supplements for student oral presentations and final draft policy briefs\n\nSubmitting a final draft of their written policy brief\n\nThe Spring cohort students focus on:\n\nVetting the drafts submitted in the fall with the client and other experts across the country. The vetting occurs in three ways: with Professor Rankin’s help, the Spring students (1) identify and coordinate with outside experts to review/critique the written draft; (2) schedule and complete any outstanding interviews the fall cohort could not complete within the first semester; and (3) identify additional new interviewees and conduct a new batch of interviews\n\nConducting any new research generated through the vetting process\n\nIncorporating the results of any new research and all the expert feedback into a revised policy brief\n\nRefining the visual supplements\n\nPolishing final revisions to the policy brief to enhance its credibility and persuasiveness\n\nAs a result of these high standards, HRAP's award-winning work has been downloaded thousands of times and praised by legal aid organizations, services providers, non-profits, city officials, and street activist organizations for its impact.\n\nThe HRAP clinic’s unique structure resembles a common lawyering practice where team staffing on a specific issue may shift over time.\n\nStudents who register in the Fall semester and continue in the Spring remain focused on the same project throughout the academic year (4 credits in the Fall; 2 credits in the Spring) and are the sole authors of any resulting published policy briefs.\n\nBy contrast, new students who join in the Spring inherit a pre-existing client file and research project that they then spend the spring semester refining and finalizing. Accordingly, new Spring students spend the first few weeks working with Professor Rankin to get oriented to the project they inherit, earning an additional credit, before proceeding with similar work to continuing Fall cohort students (thus, new Spring students receive 3 credits total). Spring cohort students will share joint authorship with the Fall students whose research project they inherited.\n\nThe HRAP spring schedule works with your schedule.\n\nContinuing students from the Fall semester have only one structured session for the course in the spring: one weekly meeting with Professor Rankin on Zoom for a 30-minute individualized session. These sessions can occur individually or in groups. Prior to each weekly meeting, students submit weekly progress reports to the professor to ensure steady progress of assignments. The day and time of this meeting is determined by Professor Rankin and each continuing student team. Continuing students do not have regular weekly seminar sessions.\n\nNew students (just joining in the Spring) have two structured parts to the course:\n\nWeekly seminar sessions with new students only. Once a week, all new students in the Spring cohort meet as a group for an hour-long session with the professor for the seminar portion of the course to discuss readings, research, and individual and collective assignments. The day and time of this meeting is determined by Professor Rankin and the Spring student cohort.\n\nIndividualized sessions. Like the continuing Fall cohort students, the new Spring cohort students will meet with Professor Rankin for 30-minute individualized sessions on a weekly basis, individually or in groups. Prior to these meetings, students will submit weekly progress reports to ensure steady progress of assignments. The day and time of this meeting is determined by Professor Rankin and each new Spring student team.\n\nPrerequisite: Legal Writing I (WRIT-100 & WRIT-105) and a grade of B or higher in the most recent Legal Writing course (WRIT-105 or WRIT-200).\n\nExperiential Learning: This course counts towards the experiential learning requirement.\n\nInnovating the Built Environment (BUSN-565) 2 credits\n\nThe built environment is a rich landscape for innovation to improve law and society, and in the case of confronting climate change, seeking to preserve a viable future for us. This course threads together two societal goals that intersect with the built environment-minimizing the impact of climate change and increasing the communication networks that connect us all as Americans.\n\nOur course will therefore focus on: i)climate-driven impacts on the built real estate environment, and ii) a review of the progress and evolution of wireless communications over the past 30 years (with an emphasis on the required infrastructure and real property matters required to operate the wireless networks).\n\nWith regard to the climate change component, the course will examine climate change and analyze the growing collision with those realities and the developed real estate environment in the United\n\nStates (where we analyze and consider governmental and private sector solutions to mitigate those impacts). Climate change related issues that will be examined include: growing Western wildfire\n\nseasons and the consequences of ever expanding development, rising sea levels and the immediate impacts on coastal communities and forecasted impacts in the coming decades, and transition from\n\nfossil fuels that impacts on our transportation infrastructure. With this component of the program, we will evaluate the legal implications (primarily real estate focused) of this interaction and consider what steps can (or should) be taken now to minimize the climate change impacts on our communities. The actions reviewed and considered will include governmental solutions (from local to national policies and directives) and solutions offered by the private sector.\n\nWith regard to the evolution of wireless communications component, the course will use the timeline of the growth of wireless communications over the last 30 years to review and consider the interplay of real estate and the accompanying physical infrastructure required to operate wireless networks. For radio-based communications, there is an extensive amount of physical infrastructure required for the initial network builds that began in earnest in the late 1980s and the evolution of that growth with the projected needs for new antenna sites required for the national rollout of 5G communications in the\n\nUnited States. Given that real property, buildings and infrastructure (e.g. light poles) are an essential component for the communications networks, each of our classes during this portion of the program will include review of select types of ground and roof top leases and related wireless network agreements commonly used in by the communications industry.\n\nStudents participating in the course will be exposed to a variety of legal and extralegal challenges and solutions to daunting social problems, along with practicing the skills of sophisticated contract selection and drafting, navigating the various governmental and regulatory layers for those components.\n\nNo prerequisites.\n\nIntroduction to Financial Technology (INTP-367) 2 credits\n\nFinancial technology, or \"FinTech,\" is what we mean when we are talking about the emerging and rapidly accelerating use of technology in the financial services sector of the 21st century. Originally, FinTech described the leveraging of information technology to provide back-end services to traditional financial institutions. Recently, however, through a phenomenon often referred to as the \"unbundling of banking,\" FinTech refers to efforts to innovate - even disrupt - the provision of financial services as we have traditionally known them, with major legal implications. We will begin with a discussion of the legal implications of FinTech in the \"sharing economy,\" including the use of blockchain (or distributed ledger) technologies, algorithmic \"smart contracts,\" peer-to-peer systems, and alternatives to traditional notions of money, as well as discussing the difference between both actual FinTech providers and latent ones (i.e., those who don't appear to be financial service providers but actually are). Then we will explore in depth the evolution of the business of banking and other financial services in the new world of FinTech, including FinTech solutions in the areas of trust and custodial services, direct or latent deposit-taking, lending, payments systems, and investment offerings and advising. This will involve an analysis of many applications, or \"apps,\" that are in common use and are well known, plus others which are hidden from the view of the consumer. Finally, the course will survey the various regulatory and policy challenges in the area of FinTech: What laws and regulations affect the FinTech sector? How do we protect the consumer in this new space? How much regulation is enough? Are there challenges presented by FinTech that require new approaches to regulation and new laws to address them? During the course, attention will also be paid to what specific legal skills are required or desirable to practice, directly or indirectly, in this field\n\nCourse Materials: Handouts; provided online or in class.\n\nCourse Requirements: One research paper (on a topic approved by the professors). Length and grading standards are different for JD, LLM and MLS students.\n\nNo prerequisites.\n\nLawyering for Social Change (JURS-382) 3 credits\n\nLawyers have long played key roles in ushering in social change. From the early abolitionists to civil rights lawyers who lent their skills to the NAACP’s campaign against segregation, to those litigating today on behalf of prisoners, immigration detainees, children caught in a school-to-prison pipeline, victims of police shootings, and the disabled, lawyers have served as vital agents of social change.\n\nThis class is for students who wish to develop their skills as instigators of social change and desire to create a specific, individualized program to perform that role. You should have a pre-existing interest, if only an inchoate one, of a law-reform nature, that you would like to expand and clarify while in school so as to land running after you graduate.\n\nThis course is for students who can see themselves working as movement lawyers, whether in solo fashion, as members of a litigation team at a specialized agency or think tank, or part-time as pro bono attorneys while working at a conventional legal job at a firm or agency.\n\nExperience shows that many students are attracted to the study of law because they want to make the world a better place. If you are such a person, this course may be for you. It will help you learn how to perform that role and push you to think specifically and clearly about how to carry it out once you graduate.\n\nPossible areas include: global warming; civil Gideon (state-paid legal services in civil cases); immigrant rights; school finance reform; reducing government waste; debt relief for student loan holders; abolishing the death penalty; eliminating clerical immunity for pedophile priests; improving police-community interaction; stopping police shootings; civil rights for transgendered people; ending bullying in schools; improving fairness in social media; reducing the role of money in political campaigns; universal health care; reforming state constitutions; animal rights; reforming the drug laws; ending homelessness; and many others.\n\nObjectives: Students will develop skills--oral, written, and practical--to instigate social change and create a ten page individualized Plan to bring it about in a well-defined area.\n\nPhase One of Course (Weeks 1-8): Students will read and discuss materials on the theory and practice of social reform, including works on how the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund planned and carried out a national attack on segregation; on how gay activists secured a wave of breakthroughs; and how lawyers on behalf of other causes have marshaled litigation, grassroots organizing, social media, public education, and lobbying to bring about social change. Short readings and TWEN postings accompany each class.\n\nPhase Two (Weeks 9-11) You will engage in intensive reading and research in the specific area you expect to target, and meet weekly with the instructors to discuss your readings and draft Plan. During this phase, you will create and read an individualized list of research tools--books, websites, articles, and government archives — that will equip you with the basic knowledge you will need to get started working as an agent for social change in your specific area. You will also integrate these materials into your emerging Plan, which will lay out what you plan to do in narrative form.\n\nYour research should include sources for grants, scholarships, and nonprofit agencies, government offices, and litigation centers that can help support you in the early years of your practice. It may also include interviews with activists and others in a position to provide you with ideas, inspiration, solidarity, or other forms of aid.\n\nPhase Three (Weeks 12-14): Students will complete and circulate an action program (“Plan”) that will guide them in their early years as an attorney, and explain and defend their Plan to the rest of the class during a presentation, as well as give and receive constructive criticism and feedback. This Plan can serve as a basis for a detailed application for a post-graduate fellowship or grant. It can also be a “memo to myself” that you will consult from time to time as you go through life.\n\nGrades: Your final grade will be determined based on your Plan, class participation, assignments, formal presentations, and group work.\n\nAttendance Policy. The American Bar Association (ABA) requires that the Law School enforce an attendance policy, and we are required to follow it. Excuses for absences will be given only under the most extenuating circumstances. 100 percent attendance is a laudable and reasonable goal that is vital to establishing a community based on trust and a sense of mutual endeavor.\n\nRecordings and Visitors. Because of the sensitive nature of the class, no visitors or recordings will be allowed.\n\nADA Accommodations: The Law School aims to meet the needs of students with physical, learning, and other disabilities and provides appropriate accommodations and services tailored to each person’s requirements. The administration and University Office of Disability Services work together to help such individuals achieve and maintain individual autonomy. Students with disabilities should contact the University Office so that staff can evaluate and accommodate their needs for support services.\n\nConduct: All students are expected to be honorable and to observe standards of conduct appropriate to a community of scholars. University policies, the Law School Honor Code, and other appropriate policies will be followed in the event of misconduct.\n\nDiversity: The University is committed to providing an atmosphere of learning that is representative of a variety of perspectives. In this class, you will have the opportunity to express and experience cultural diversity. Individuality and creative expression are welcome. Take advantage of these opportunities in your own work, but also learn from the information, ideas, and experiences of others.\n\nPREVIOUS STUDENTS HAVE DESCRIBED THE CLASS IN THIS WAY:\n\nI want to mention how appreciative I am of you designing such a spectacular course. It is because of this class that I have become so much more passionate about criminal justice reform. . . The foundation was there before the class but the course really helped me see the entire vision and the end goal.\n\nI like to look at my Plan once in a while, when things get hard, to remind myself why I chose to take this journey in the first place. Thank you for that opportunity and for teaching that class.\n\nI feel like I gained some incredible analytical tools and new insights. You’ve both inspired me to try to make some real changes in the legal field.\n\nI’m beyond excited to focus . . . on the pragmatic ways to sustain and snowball real outcomes of firm change.\n\nIt is so inspiring and heartening to know that we have your support as we try to make change throughout our careers. I gained so much practical knowledge. I know that having a course like this keeps students on the track of becoming public interest lawyers when they might otherwise be discouraged by law school.\n\nI wasn’t expecting to be going into animal advocacy as I entered law school, even though the topic had been a passion of mine for a long time. It’s almost as if I was waiting for someone to say that I had permission to pursue that goal, and your class provided that permission.\n\nRace and Law (JURS-360) 2 credits\n\nThis course addresses law and its relationship to racial justice. Race is one of the fundamental axes of social injustice in the U.S. The legal system operates to create, reinforce and mask racial injustice. Yet law simultaneously provides practical tools to further social justice values. This course should help you develop a deeper grasp of the role law plays in constructing and sustaining \"race\" and \"racism.\" By understanding this, you can hold our legal system more accountable to its stated constitutional values of due process of law and equal protection of the laws.\n\nOf course, race is not the only category through which unjust power relations are formed. We cannot grasp the full extent of racism without analyzing how it intersects with other \"isms\" to create larger structures of social oppression; thus we will address other forms of social injustice, such as discrimination based on gender, class, sexual orientation, disability, etc. However, we will always return our focus to unlearning racism, which is so complex that it is a lifelong learning process.\n\nBy the end of the semester, you should have some basic information and tools that will allow you to communicate more effectively with colleagues, clients and other justice system stakeholders who have different racial experiences than yours; recognize issues of race that underlie our legal, political and social institutions; analyze the racial content of seemingly race-neutral laws and actions; and be better equipped to work towards achieving racial justice, in your capacities as lawyers as well as a citizens who want to make a difference.\n\nCourse evaluation will be based upon presentations and final papers.\n\nNo prerequisites.\n\nSocial Impact Advocacy (ADVC-330) 3 credits\n\nDespite a century or more of seemingly monumental legal reforms (such as Brown v. Board of Education outlawing school segregation along color lines) and social changes, everyday headlines make plain that the U.S. constitutional commitment to \"Equal Justice Under Law\" remains illusory for many persons, and for some entire groups. When examined from a systems analysis, current events reveal the \"systemic\" and interconnected nature of a variety of daunting and seemingly intractable legal and social issues and injustices, ranging from mass incarceration and the War on Drugs to homelessness, voter suppression, protest suppression, student debt, wealth and income disparities, climate change, worker precarity, inadequate school funding, immigrant justice, the preservation of U.S. colonies such as Puerto Rico, the continuance of neighborhood and school segregation, and many more modern topical controversies that reveal identity-based oppressions and underlying systems that serve elite interests. The pressing practical question for those seeking legal reform is: How can lawyers become more effective advocates of systemic reform to achieve equal justice in everyday life for all? Relatedly, how can law be used to remedy systemic injustice, when law is oftentimes constructed and operated as a complementary system to maintain systemic societal and material inequalities based on social identities?\n\nTo tackle these and similar questions, this three-credit course examines key systemic (or structural) reasons for persistent access to justice and equal justice gaps while building a set of critical knowledges, values, skills, and attitudes (CKVSAs) for effective social impact (or systemic) advocacy. Using contemporary topics of special relevance to students, the course will survey and discuss key issues, concepts, terms, and arguments relating to law and (unequal) justice as we work on individual and group projects linked to current community issues. Assigned readings provide a critical understanding of the complex yet crucial cross-connection among law practice, legal reform, systemic change, and social impact while the hands-on community research projects emphasize the individual and collaborative development of fact-finding and analytical practices.\n\nUpon completion of this course, all students should possess a substantive, sophisticated, and self-critical understanding of the cross-disciplinary, multi-cultural, and inter-active skillsets needed for meaningful and resilient social change.\n\nMethod of Evaluation: Final course grades are based on the following areas of individual performance and summative assessment designed for ongoing feedback, group discussion, and progressive learning: (1) consistent professionalism and participation in classroom discussions and course activities, and (2) contributions to group projects, including presentations at the end of the semester. This comprehensive method of evaluation values and balances the learning process and the covered CKSVAs in all relevant respects-including basics like advance preparation and attention to detail, punctuality and timeliness, consistent attendance and thoughtful participation, personal initiative and self-direction, and overall professional conduct that sustains successful collaboration and teamwork-because each of these technical capacities is a valued competency, and an important metric, of successful professionalism in any modern law practice or social justice role.\n\nNo prerequisites.\n\nThe Modern Corporation (BUSN-302) 3 credits\n\nFor the past century, the modern business corporation has been the dominant economic institution in American society and has been a central element in American global hegemony. Moreover, the American version of the modern corporation, and the legal rules which have evolved to support and control it, have become the dominant corporate model throughout much of the world. However, the modern corporation has roots that go back to and before the establishment of the first British colonies, and the evolution of the modern corporation is inextricably linked with the birth and evolution of the United States as constitutional republic.\n\nNearly a century ago, Adolf Berle and Gardiner Mean’s famously warned that the modern corporation, then in its infancy, was a new form of private property which would soon rival if not surpass the nation state in its power and influence. In contrast, Thorstein Veblen also saw the threat of corporate tyranny, but from the corporate nation state itself. These competing insights are central to an understanding of the modern corporation.\n\nIn this course, we will explore the nature of the modern business corporation and its relationship to the nation state, and to federal and state governments, through the lenses of history, legal jurisprudence, and current events. Students will develop and sharpen their understanding of the role state and federal law play in the creation, evolution, and governance of the modern corporation, and how those roles have evolved and changed throughout our nation’s history. Emphasis will be placed on understanding and critiquing the modern corporation as not only a legal construct, but also as a social and economic institution, with particular emphasis on competing views concerning the purpose of the modern corporation and its relation to its owners, stakeholders, and the broader community.\n\nClass preparation and participation is the essence of this course, and will be the basis for 100% of each student’s final grade. Central to the satisfaction of this requirement, each student will prepare a short written “ticket” prior to each class demonstrating their preparation for and engagement with class materials, including consistent engagement with the Wall Street Journal and with the constantly changing spectacle of American business leadership (think, for example of Elon Musk as a central figure in American foreign policy and owner of Twitter, and Boeing and Starbucks as major actors in American life). Admission to class each day is predicated on advance submission of a satisfactory ticket, using Canvas. Students are allowed 3 unexcused absences. Attending class without prior submission of a satisfactory ticket will be treated as an unexcused absence.\n\nNo prerequisites.\n\nUCC Sales (COMM-350) 3 credits\n\nThe course covers the law governing the sales of tangible personal property. The course deals with contracts for the sale of goods, involving issues that generally are not dealt with in first year contracts. The course covers shipment of the goods when the parties are at a distance and the risk of loss should the goods be damaged or destroyed prior to acceptance by the buyer. Of central importance is the seller's obligations with respect to the quality of and title to the goods. Discussed under this topic are the creation and content of express and implied warranties; the manner in which they may be modified or disclaimed; and the contractual alterations the parties can make to the remedies provided by the law. The course also treats the buyer's right to reject or revoke acceptance of non-conforming goods; the buyer's and seller's remedies in the event of breach; and the right of the buyer or seller to reclaim goods from an insolvent seller or buyer. Although the central source of law for this portion of the course is Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the course also will consider the interface between the Code and products liability law.\n\nNo prerequisites.\n\nThis is a bar-tested course.\n\nPart of the Bar Success Prescribed Curriculum Bar-Tested Course List: Students subject to the Bar Success Prescribed Curriculum are required to take two courses off the Bar-Tested Course List."
