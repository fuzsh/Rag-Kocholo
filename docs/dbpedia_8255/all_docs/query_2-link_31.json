        "text": "In this paper, senior members of Clifford Chanceâ€™s Global Private Credit Group look at the impact on private credit of the return of the Broadly Syndicated Loan (BSL) market, the options for private credit in the short term and what developments we expect to see happening in the future.\n\nIn this extract from a recent Clifford Chance webinar, we explore data transfers and localisation, cybersecurity and the latest regulatory developments and enforcement trends in APAC.\n\nIn this briefing, we detail some of the current approaches to privately placed high-yield bonds and their practical and legal basis.\n\nCybersecurity is not just a problem for the IT department. It is an enterprise-wide issue. In this extract from a recent Clifford Chance webinar, we explore global trends in cybersecurity and resilience and examine increasing levels of regulation which will impact a much broader range of businesses.\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are having a significant impact on businesses globally. We look ahead and assess the challenges and opportunities on a range of strategic issues, from regulations on corporate sustainability reporting and transition planning, the evolution of sustainable finance and the role of carbon markets in funding net zero, to the increase in ESG-related litigation."
