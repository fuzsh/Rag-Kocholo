In some of the biggest protests since the fall of Communism in 1989, Polish women and men have blocked roadways, disrupted religious services and organized a nationwide strike. Then, earlier this week, Poland delayed the implementation of the ban after two weeks of growing protests.\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn about the events that led up to the protests. Then you can choose to reflect on what has been happening in Poland or share your own opinion about abortion laws in your state or country.\n\nWarm Up\n\nHow much do you already know about Poland? Complete our five-question Country of the Week quiz to test your knowledge on its geography, history and religion.\n\nThen, watch this video from the top of the article and respond to the following questions."
