        "text": "Summer is in full swing, and the holiday days are quickly passing by. July, the peak of the holiday season in Poland, has come to an end. Did the summer season affect how satisfied people were with their mobile networks? We explore this in our latest report, where we take a usual look at the quality and speed of mobile internet in Poland.\n\nRead also: Quality of mobile Internet in Warsaw – latest Drive Test measurements (June 2023)\n\nIn July 2023, there were 438,932 measurements taken. 5G technology was used in 64,419 tests, making up 14.67% of the total. There were 343,921 mobile Internet tests done using 4G LTE, which was 78.35% of all the tests. The rest of the measurements, 6.98%, were made using the older WCDMA technology.\n\nWhen looking at the popularity of operators among the measurements taken, Orange network coverage was surveyed the most often (33.5%), followed by Play (32.1%), Plus (18%), and T-Mobile (16.4%).\n\nWant to help create more rankings? Download our mobile app for free and join the community!\n\nMobile Internet in Poland – What was the situation like in June 2023?\n\nIn June 2023, Plus continued to lead in download speeds on the 5G network, achieving an impressive score of 148.2 Mbps. Play distinguished itself from the competition by reaching 39.3 Mbps, therefore taking the top spot in the upload speed category on the 5G network. Play’s success didn’t end there; it also secured the best ping score on the 5G network, with a time of 27.2 ms.\n\nRegarding 4G LTE technology, T-Mobile not only maintained its first place in the download speed category but even strengthened its position, reaching a speed of 42.7 Mbps. Play confirmed its leadership in the upload speed category with a score of 23.3 Mbps. Demonstrating its all-around capabilities, Play also achieved a score of 30.5 ms in the area of low average ping on the 4G network.\n\nCheck out the state of mobile Internet in Poland in June 2023\n\nThe state of mobile Internet in Poland in July 2023\n\n5G performance\n\nAverage data download speed: Plus (146.2 Mbps)\n\nIn a review of average download speeds on Poland’s 5G network, Plus secured the leading position with an impressive 146.2 Mbps. The competition was tight, with T-Mobile following at 59.2 Mbps, just edging out Play’s score of 56.6 Mbps. Orange trailed in this category, finishing last with a score of 55.4 Mbps.\n\nThe narrow differences in results between operators (excluding Plus) signal intense competition and a high standard of service. These findings highlight the importance of investment in 5G infrastructure, reflecting the determination of Polish operators to provide top-tier connection quality to their customers.\n\nAverage data upload speed: T-Mobile (35.9 Mbps)\n\nFor average upload speeds on the 5G network, T-Mobile claimed the top spot with 35.9 Mbps, showcasing the operator’s dedication to quality service. Play was a close second at 35.5 Mbps, highlighting the strong competition in this area. Orange also performed well, reaching 33.6 Mbps, while Plus finished last at 25.0 Mbps, possibly indicating a focus on other service aspects.\n\nLowest ping value: Play (27.3 ms)\n\nIn the category of lowest ping value, essential for seamless real-time connections, Play emerged as the leader with 27.3 ms. This excellent result could appeal to gamers and those needing low latency.\n\nT-Mobile was not far behind at 28.3 ms, reflecting its high-quality service. Orange’s 30.8 ms also ensures acceptable latency. Plus, although last with 34.9 ms, still offers competitive latency.\n\nOverall, these results demonstrate that Poland’s major operators are all capable of delivering services with acceptable latency levels, a critical factor for today’s modern applications and services.\n\n4G LTE performance\n\nAverage data download speed: T-Mobile (46.8 Mbps)\n\nIn the evaluation of 4G LTE download speeds in Poland, T-Mobile led the pack with a speed of 46.8 Mbps, highlighting its dedication to delivering high-quality service to customers.\n\nOrange and Play also posted strong results, with speeds of 43.1 Mbps and 42.1 Mbps respectively, showing a healthy level of competition in this category. Plus, although registering a lower speed of 36.4 Mbps, still offers a stable connection that meets the needs of most users.\n\nThe differences between operators are not extreme, indicating that Poland’s 4G LTE market is both well-structured and competitive. These findings also reinforce the continued relevance and reliability of 4G technology, even as 5G technology continues to advance.\n\nAverage data upload speed: Play (22.6 Mbps)\n\nIn the 4G LTE network upload category, Play took the lead in Poland with a speed of 22.6 Mbps. T-Mobile secured second place with 19.6 Mbps, just ahead of Orange at 19.5 Mbps. Plus, despite a respectable speed of 17.6 Mbps, came in last in this category.\n\nLowest ping value: Play (29.3 ms)\n\nFor the lowest ping on the 4G LTE network, Play once again came out on top with a score of 29.3 ms. T-Mobile and Orange were evenly matched, both achieving a score of 32.2 ms. Plus, however, was at the bottom with a value of 38.4 ms, possibly reflecting higher latency on its network. These results reveal noticeable but not significant differences in ping between the operators, suggesting that each is capable of delivering a satisfactory level of service.\n\n5G/4G LTE Leaderboard\n\nHow did we collect data for the ranking?\n\nThe measurements are collected from the users of our mobile app. It allows us to measure basic mobile network parameters – including signal level and quality depending on the technology used by the mobile device, information about the mobile network operator, or the country where the smartphone is located. In addition, on-demand measurements of data download and upload speeds, as well as a latency test, are performed.\n\nWhen the app notices a low-quality voice call, lack of mobile Internet service, or other services, it has the ability to report the user’s current position where the problem occurred.\n\nHelp us create the report on the quality and speed of mobile Internet in Poland!"
