        "text": "Raising the 500 plus benefit to PLN 800 from January 2024 ($1 = 4.1422 zlotys), free medicines for children and youth up to 18 years of age and people over 65, as well as the abolition of tolls for passenger cars on state highways – announced PiS president Jarosław Kaczyński during the weekend conference program of the ruling party.\n\nChild benefit payments currently cost the state budget over 40 billion zlotys a year. The PiS leader did not say how much the benefit increase would cost, but expressed confidence it would not fuel inflation.\n\n“We hope that inflation will be low in the new year, so this new financial injection will no longer threaten a return to inflationary tendencies – we have taken this into account,” Kaczyński said.\n\nMaląg: The family is at the center\n\nThe Minister of Family and Social Policy, Marlena Maląg, asked whether the budget could afford such an increase of 500 plus to 800 plus , replied that of course the budget could afford it:\n\nFirst of all, we must look at the fact that the philosophy of the rule of Law and Justice – unlike the liberals – is that the family is at the center. All expenses that are provided for families in our programs are an investment in the future of families and in the future of Poland, she said.\n\nWe closed the state budget. The funds do not flow to VAT mafias, but go to support families, which must be comprehensive and systemic. We started them with the 500 plus program, which will now change to the 800 plus program. We must remember that further programs were introduced along the way – Good Start, Family Care Capital, maternity benefit, as well as the Toddler Plus program – she reminded."
