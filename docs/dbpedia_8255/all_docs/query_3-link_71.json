        "text": "An Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) is a small, independent residential dwelling unit located on the same lot as your home. The unit could be located within the existing home or could be a fully independent and detached structure. ADUs come in a variety of types, including basement apartments, attic conversions or in-law suites.\n\nADUs can serve a number of different purposes providing housing to family members or serving as an added source of income for household expenses by renting an additional unit.\n\nHow Does the Program Work\n\nThe Plus One ADU Program will combine low or no-interest capital loans and construction financing grants provided by the New York State Homes and Community Renewal for up to 15 eligible homeowners to build or convert ADU’s on their property.\n\nIn partnership with Restored Homes HDFC, the program will provide homeowners with financial and technical support, including predevelopment and construction resources on a single-family property where the existing zoning allows for one additional unit. ADUs financed through the program will become safe, habitable, and potentially rent-restricted units that will help homeowners generate additional income and support long-term homeowner and neighborhood stability.\n\nEligible Homeowners\n\nMay earn up to 165% AMI or $186,450 for a two-person household. Preference will be given to homeowners who are at or below 100% AMI or $113,000 for a two-person household.\n\nSee AMI chart: Area Median Income - HPD (nyc.gov)\n\nMust be owner-occupant\n\nMust be current on any existing mortgages and not have outstanding municipal arrears or be in an active payment plan\n\nEligible Buildings\n\nOne-unit, single-family detached residential homes\n\nHomes that allow for two-family construction under the existing building and zoning code\n\nHomes must pass a housing quality inspection and need no major repairs other than repairs that are essential to the ADU construction scope\n\nEligible homes must either be free of housing or building code violations prior to receiving program financing, unless the violations are directly related to ADU, or the owner must agree to address all existing violations prior to ADU construction completion.\n\nFor basement conversions, the applicable ADU space must meet ceiling height requirements prior to conversion and must be located outside of the 2050 Stormwater Flood area as well as the 2100’s 100-year coastal flood zone.\n\nThe following ADU typologies may be eligible to participate in the program:\n\nAttached or detached existing structures or newly constructed structures\n\nBasement or attic unit conversions\n\nHow To Apply\n\nThe program launched on November 21, 2023 and interested homeowners had until February 13, 2024 to complete the Plus One ADU participant survey to be considered for participation in the pilot program. While the current application period has closed, please sign up below to receive updates related to ADU initiatives throughout the City, including City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, NYC’s plan to modernize and update our city’s zoning regulations.\n\nPlus One ADU Interest Form\n\nResources\n\nTerm sheet\n\nPlus One ADU Flyer is also available in additional languages:\n\nBangla / বাংলা\n\nChinese (Simplified) / 简化字\n\nSpanish / Español\n\nContact"
