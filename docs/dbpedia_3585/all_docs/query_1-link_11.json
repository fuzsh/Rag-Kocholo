        "text": "Pontiac West median real estate price is $147,953, which is less expensive than 79.4% of Michigan neighborhoods and 87.9% of all U.S. neighborhoods.\n\nThe average rental price in Pontiac West is currently $1,118, based on NeighborhoodScout's exclusive analysis. Rents here are currently lower in price than 90.9% of Michigan neighborhoods.\n\nPontiac West is an urban neighborhood (based on population density) located in Pontiac, Michigan.\n\nPontiac West real estate is primarily made up of small (studio to two bedroom) to medium sized (three or four bedroom) single-family homes and apartment complexes/high-rise apartments. Most of the residential real estate is occupied by a mixture of owners and renters. Many of the residences in the Pontiac West neighborhood are relatively historic, built no later than 1939, and in some cases, quite a bit earlier. A number of residences were also built between 1940 and 1969.\n\nPontiac West has a 13.4% vacancy rate, which is well above average compared to other U.S. neighborhoods (higher than 73.9% of American neighborhoods). Most vacant housing here is vacant year round. This could either signal that there is a weak demand for real estate in the neighborhood or that large amount of new housing has been built and not yet occupied. Either way, if you live here, you may find many of the homes or apartments are empty."
