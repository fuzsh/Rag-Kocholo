Named for Chief Pontiac of the Ottawa tribe, it was located on the Saginaw Trail and became an important wagon and carriage production centre in the 1880s. It later turned to the manufacture of automobiles, auto parts, buses, and trucks. The Oakland County Pioneer and Historical Society is headquartered in the Governor Moses Wisner Mansion (1845). Oakland University (1957) in nearby Rochester is the site of the summer Meadow Brook Music Festival. Pontiac was the site of the Silverdome (1975), a large indoor sports arena that was home to several sports teams, including the Detroit Lions (1975–2001) of the National Football League and the Detroit Pistons (1978–88) of the National Basketball Association; the stadium was demolished in 2017. Inc. village, 1837; city, 1861. Pop. (2000) 66,337; (2010) 59,515."
