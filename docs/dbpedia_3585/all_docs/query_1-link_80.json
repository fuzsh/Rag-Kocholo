        "text": "Stabenow, Peters Announce Over $16 Million for Pontiac’s Pike Street Clinton River Trail\n\nDETROIT, MI - U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (MI) and Gary Peters (MI) today announced the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) will be awarding the City of Pontiac, Michigan $16,328,000 in federal funding through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) Grant program, which was funded through the bipartisan infrastructure law the senators helped enact. The funding will help reconstruct the deteriorated four-mile corridor along Pike Street and key connecting roads Front Street, Eastway Drive, and Bagley Street. The grant will also help incorporate improved safety measures and traffic operations for greater pedestrian accessibility and will create a pedestrian and bicyclist trail along the former Grand Trunk-Belt Line Railroad that will improve access to public spaces and help support downtown Pontiac’s economy.\n\n“The Clinton River Trail is a wonderful recreational resource for families in Oakland County and across the states to walk and ride bikes. This investment makes important connections in Pontiac to expand access for residents and users across the state,” said Senator Stabenow.\n\n“Investments in infrastructure are investments in our communities, our economy, and our safety,” said Senator Peters. “I’m proud to have helped enact the bipartisan infrastructure law that made this funding available for these much-needed improvements in Pontiac that will also boost the local economy.”\n\n“We are grateful to Senator Peters and Senator Stabenow for their support and advocacy for this project and for a full award from the Department of Transportation’s Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) in the amount of $16,328,000,” said Pontiac Mayor Tim Greimel. “The Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Foundation has welcomed a grant proposal for up to a $4 million match to support the project. The Ralph C. Wilson Jr. foundation is a wonderful partner to the City and we are grateful for their commitment to supporting transformation in Pontiac. The Pike Street Clinton River Trail Project, which is now fully funded at $20,328,000, is critical to a vibrant downtown and to enhanced transportation in Pontiac. The active transportation infrastructure improvements, such as the cycle path and the construction of the Clinton River Trail Connector, will provide meaningful, safe, and accessible transportation options, while eliminating barriers for Pontiac Residents. Improvements will also include reconstruction of the roadway along Pike Street.”\n\nMore information on RAISE grants can be found at https://www.transportation.gov/RAISEgrants/about.\n\n###"
