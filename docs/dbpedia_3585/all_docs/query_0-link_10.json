        "text": "FAQs\n\nListed below are some frequently asked questions involving the departments of the City of Auburn Hills. Click on the department link below to navigate to the question you may be searching for.\n\nAssessing\n\nCity Clerk\n\nCommunity Center\n\nCommunity Development\n\nDepartment of Public Works\n\nFinance\n\nFire\n\nHuman Resources\n\nParks and Recreation\n\nPolice\n\nSenior Services\n\nTreasurer's\n\nUtility Billing\n\nAssessing\n\nGlossary of Terms\n\nCapped Value (CAP): Last year's taxable value, less losses, increased by the amount of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or 5 percent, whichever is lower, plus the value of new construction.\n\nConsumer Price Index (CPI): Determined by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAssessed Value (AV): Half of the True Cash Value\n\nState Equalized Value (SEV): County and State Equalization studies are performed after the local municipalities have finalized their assessment rolls which results in a factor applied to the assessed values. Historically, for Auburn Hills, this factor has been 1.000 which means that the SEV and the Assessed Values have been the same.\n\nTaxable Value (TV): The lesser of the SEV and the CAPPED Value. Property taxes are determined by multiplying the taxable value by the millage rate.\n\nGeneral Assessment Questions\n\nWhen will my property be evaluated?\n\nThe taxable status of real and personal property for a tax year shall be determined as of each December 31 of the immediately preceding year, which is considered tax day. An assessing officer is not restricted to any particular period in the preparation of the assessment roll but may survey, examine, or review properties at any time prior to or after the tax day.\n\nWhy do assessed values change from year to year?\n\nWhen market value changes, naturally so does assessed value. For instance, if you were to increase the total market value of a parcel of property by building a garage, the assessed value would increase proportionately. Similarly, should a property value be decreased because of a fire or other catastrophe, the assessed value would decrease to show the downward effect of the damage on the market value of the property. The economy of the entire community affects assessed value. For example, over the years more property owners have rehabilitated or invested in new construction in and around the City of Auburn Hills; and all property values within the City have increased. This can easily be seen by looking at the asking prices of properties that are currently for sale on the open market and by finding out what properties have actually sold for within the City of Auburn Hills. The Assessor has not created this value, he simply has the legal responsibility to discover it as it exists and appraise property accordingly. People make value by their transactions in the market place.\n\nHow can my Taxable Value go up when my Assessed Value stays the same or even goes down? The City of Auburn Hills knows this is an area of great concern to our taxpayers. Assessments are a function of property value and property taxes are calculated on your taxable value. In 1994 Proposal A required property taxes be calculated based on the Taxable Value not the Assessed Value. By law, Taxable Values are annually increased or decreased each year by the CPI (Consumer Price Index) or 5% whichever is lower; unless there are physical changes to the property or a transfer of ownership occurred. The 2012 Inflation Rate Multiplier (IRM) is 1.027%\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, property values greatly exceeded the annual CPI. This has created a gap between the Assessed and Taxable Values. Property taxes will continue to rise until the taxable value is equal to the Assessed Value. Therefore, it is possible for your assessment to go down, yet a Taxable Value will increase until the assessment and taxable value are equal. Proposal A does not permit the taxable value to ever be higher than the assessed value.\n\nCLICK HERE to obtain a copy of Oakland County's Proposal A pamphlet for more information and examples.\n\nIf I repair my home will my assessment go up?\n\nMost homes are assumed to be maintained and normal repairs usually will not increase the assessment. If you are fixing up a home that has not been maintained or needs many repairs, you may want to file a \"Request for Non consideration of the True Cash Value of Normal Repair, Replacement and Maintenance Expenditures\" form. Form number 865, formerly L-4293. Normal repairs and maintenance such as siding, windows, porches, roof, heating systems, painting and interior remodeling will not be added to your assessed value until you sell the property to someone else. Expenses which are part of a structural addition do no qualify. Forms are available by calling or stopping by the assessor's office.\n\nPrincipal Residence (Homestead) Exemptions\n\nWhat is the deadline for filing a Principal Residence Exemption Affidavit?\n\nThe filing deadline is June 1 of the year the exemption is being claimed. Click HERE to access the proper form.\n\nI moved to a different home before the June1 filing deadline. May I claim my new home?\n\nYes. If you buy a new home and move into it before the May 1 filing deadline, you may claim an exemption on the new home. New residences may be claimed by filing a PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE EXEMPTION AFFIDAVIT (FORM 2368) that is typically available at closing. If your agent does not provide you with this form, you can either pick one up at the Assessor's office at city hall or download it from the link above.\n\nI moved into my Auburn HIlls home after June 1st, but by November 1st. Do I qualify for a Principal Residence Exemption?\n\nPA 114 of 2012 allows those who initially own and occupy their home from June 2 through November 1 to claim a principal residence exemption for the winter taxes only for that year, as long as their Principal Residence Exemption Affidavit form is timely filed. Note: If the school operating taxes for your school district are levied on the summer tax bill only, this exemption will not benefit you until the following year.\n\nCan I, as closing agent, be held liable to a buyer or seller if the buyer is not granted a homestead exemption because I did not provide either an update or an affidavit form, or I did not submit their form on time?\n\nClosing agents are required to provide either an affidavit or update form at closing. However, PA 415 of 1994 does not provide a legal course of action against the closing agent, by the buyer or seller, if the agent fails to provide a homestead exemption form or fails to file the form with the local tax collecting unit.\n\nWhen I claim an exemption on my new residence, what happens to the exemption on the residence I sold?\n\nThe exemption on your old home remains in effect until December 31 of the year your home is sold. If you move to your new residence before your first home is sold, the exemption expires on December 31 of the year you move out. You must rescind the homestead exemption within 90 days of the date you no longer own or occupy the property as your principal residence. You may rescind your exemption on the REQUEST TO RESCIND/WITHDRAW HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION FORM (Form 2602) at closing. If your agent did not provide you with Form 2602, stop by the Assessor's office at city hall or download it from the link above.\n\nI am moving into a new home and converting my current home to a rental property in November. Do I have to rescind the exemption on my current home?\n\nYes, within 90 days of moving. The exemption will remain in place until December 31 of the year the use is changed from your principal residence to a rental property. Click HERE to access the proper form.\n\nI just moved into a new home and have my prior home up for sale. Can I keep the PRE on my prior home?\n\nMaybe. Click HERE for more information.\n\nWhat happens when a lender has foreclosed on a mortgage and the home is now vacant?\n\nThe lender must rescind the homestead exemption using the REQUEST TO RESCIND/WITHDRAW HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION FORM (Form 2602). If you need a Form 2602 you can pick on up at the Assessor’s office at city hall or download it from the link above.\n\nWhat determines principal residence?\n\nThe test the Michigan Department of Treasury uses to determine principal residence includes such things as where you are registered to vote, the address on your driver's license, where your children attend school, and the address from which you file your income tax returns.\n\nI own two homes in Michigan. For which home do I claim the exemption?\n\nClaim the exemption for the home you occupy as your principal residence.\n\nI have a home in Michigan and in another state. May I claim an exemption on my Michigan home?\n\nYou must be a Michigan resident to claim this exemption. You may claim your Michigan home only if you own it and occupy it as your principal residence. You may not have more than one principal residence.\n\nMay renters file for this exemption?\n\nNo. You must own your principal residence to claim an exemption for it.\n\nMy children own my home, but I hold a life estate. May I claim the exemption?\n\nYes. Complete the affidavit using your name, address, social security number, and signature. Your children should not sign the affidavit.\n\nI am leasing my home with an option to buy. May I claim my home?\n\nNo. Leasing with an option to buy is considered a rental arrangement, so the home is ineligible. When you exercise the option to buy, you may claim an exemption.\n\nI live in a nursing home but still maintain a home that I eventually plan on returning to. May I claim an exemption on the home I own?\n\nYes, unless the home is rented to another person.\n\nI own the lot adjoining and contiguous to my home, and it has a different property identification number than the parcel on which my homestead is located. May I also claim an exemption on this property?\n\nYou may claim an exemption on this property as long as the property claimed is adjoining or contiguous to your home. A road does not break contiguity. File an affidavit for each parcel.\n\nI live in part of my home and operate a business in another part. May I claim an exemption?\n\nYes, but only on the portion of the property that is your home. You may claim the partial exemption even if the property is classified as commercial.\n\nI rent a room in my home to a boarder. May I still claim an exemption?\n\nYes. If more than 50 percent of your home is used as your principal residence, you may claim an exemption for your entire home. If you use 50 percent or less of your home as a principal residence, a percentage of your home that you occupy will be used.\n\nI own a duplex and I live in one of the units. My father lives in the other unit but does not pay rent. May I claim an exemption on both units?\n\nYou may claim an exemption only on the unit you occupy as your principal residence even if there is an adjoining entrance between the units.\n\nConditional Rescission of Principal Residence Exemption\n\nWhere can I find information on a Conditional Rescission of Principal Residence Exemption?\n\nBy clicking HERE.\n\nTransfer of Ownership\n\nHow do I file for a transfer of ownership for a property?\n\nP.A. 415 defines transfers and requires that whenever a property transfers ownership, a Property Transfer Affidavit must be filed by the new owner with the assessing officer (even if you are not recording a deed) within 45 days of the transfer. This affidavit must disclose the following:\n\n- The parties to the transfer\n\n- The date of the transfer\n\n- The actual consideration for the transfer (ie: dollar amount), and\n\n- The property identification number or legal description. The property Transfer Affidavit must be filed within 45 days of transfer.\n\nIf a Property Transfer Affidavit is not filed timely, a penalty of $5/day (maximum $200) applies\n\nPersonal Property\n\nI closed my business this year (or moved it out of Auburn Hills), and still received a tax bill for my personal property. Do I have to pay it? Why?\n\nYes, you are still responsible for the payment. The status of personal property on December 31st will determine what is assessed and where it is assessed in the following year. According to MCL 211.17, any changes in location or ownership of the personal property after tax day will not affect the assessment.

If you have a bill which seems higher than usual, you should check your home for water leaks. There is an indicator on the face of your meter which can be used to identify water consumption. The water meter cannot register excess water usage, therefore cannot overstate your water consumption, unless the water actually passed through the meter and into your home.\n\nI haven't received a water/sewer bill in several months.

To avoid late penalties, please allow sufficient time (7-10 days) for mailing, as postmarks are not accepted.\n\nHow is the amount of my tax determined?\n\nTax amounts are calculated by multiplying the Taxable Value of a parcel by the millage rate divided by 1,000.

Utility Bills are always due on the 15th of each month. If the 15th falls on a holiday or weekend, then the due date is extended to the next business day.\n\nHow can I make a payment on my Utility Billing Account:\n\nThe Treasurer’s Department accepts cash, checks, and credit / debit card payments. Payments must either be mailed or dropped off at City Hall. After hours payments may be put in the drop-box located outside of the Treasurer’s office. You can also make a payment with a Credit Card or E-Check at www.auburnhills.org\n\nWhen is my Utility Bill payment due?\n\nWater and sewer bills are always due on the 15th of each month. If the 15th falls on a holiday or weekend, then the due date is extended to the next business day. A 6% compounding penalty is applied if bills are not paid by the due date. Failure to receive a bill does not waive any past due penalty.\n\nWhy is there a Penalty charge on my bill?\n\nBy City Ordinance No. 634, Section 74-143, “If any bill is not paid when due, then a compounding penalty of six\n\npercent shall be added thereto.\"\n\nI sent my payment electronically, through my checking service, why is it late?\n\nIf you ask your checking service to send a payment, they have to write a check and mail it to the City in the traditional manner. This seems to take longer than it would for you to write and mail a check yourself. Please make sure to allow ample time for this process if you choose to make a payment this way.\n\nWhere is my water meter?\n\nYour water meter is usually located in the basement, crawl space or in a utility room.\n\nWhat is that plastic box on the outside of my house?\n\nThe plastic box on the outside of the house is a remote reading device. This remote reader is wired to the meter inside. Monthly, DPW gets meter readings via the remote, which is how we can accurately bill and is the reason why meter readers don’t knock on your door every three months asking to come inside to read your water meter.\n\nHow can I tell if the meter read on my bill is an “Actual Read”?\n\nThe letter printed after the Previous Read number and the Current Read number should be an “A” if an “Actual Read” was taken from your meter. You can also verify the read by looking at your meter’s odometer. See How to Read Your Water Meter for more information.\n\nHow can I get a printout of my meter read history or Water Consumption History?\n\nContact the Utility Billing department by calling 248-370-9340 or via email at utilitybilling@auburnhills.org.\n\nWhy is my water bill so high?\n\nThere are several reasons for a high water bill. During the summer months, watering new or existing grass or landscaping can cause the water bill to escalate. Seemingly small problems such as toilet or faucet leaks, a water powered sump pump, or a leaking humidifier can make a great impact on your water bill. You can check for leaks by looking for the small triangular leak indicator on the face of your water meter. If it is spinning when no water should be running, a leak is present. Another method of checking for leaks is to take a meter reading at night and another in the morning. If no water was used over night, the reading should remain the same. See Tips for Saving Water & Money for more information.\n\nI am selling my house can I give you the final read off my meter?\n\nOnly Water Department personnel take final readings. To assure you get your final bill in time for your closing date you will need to call and schedule a final reading appointment 48 hours before your closing. We will need access to your premise to read the water meter inside. You will then be able to pick up your final bill at the Treasurer’s office at City Hall the next business day and receive a receipt, or have it mailed, faxed or emailed to you. See Moving In/Out for more information."
