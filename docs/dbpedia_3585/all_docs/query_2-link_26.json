Congresswoman Stevens takes very seriously the opportunity to provide critical federal funding for our communities and has engaged with stakeholders across the district to determine how to maximize the potential of this funding for Michigan’s 11th District. Rep. Stevens used the following criteria to determine her requests to the Appropriations Committee.\n\nDoes the project meet the Committee’s guidance for determining project eligibility?\n\nHow many constituents will benefit from this project?\n\nDoes the project have broad support demonstrated by stakeholders across the community?\n\nCan the project’s sponsors meet the requirements for non-federal matching funding when appropriate?\n\nHow promptly and efficiently can this funding be spent?\n\nBelow are the 10 project requests that Rep. Stevens made to the Appropriations Committee based on this criteria:\n\nBirmingham, Auburn Hills, and Bloomfield Police Departments Mental Health Co-Response Program\n\nRequest Amount: $252,390\n\nIntended Recipient: Oakland Community Health Network\n\nFull Street Address of the Intended Recipient: 5505 Corporate Dr. Troy MI 48098\n\nProject Overview: According to reported studies, it is estimated that 10% of all police calls for service in the United States involve a person living with a serious mental illness. These calls involve an individual in a mental health crisis in need of immediate professional help aimed at preventing harm or injury to the individual in crisis or others. Overwhelmingly, the police are the sole first responders sent to assist those in a mental health crisis in the community. This program seeks to build a partnership between Auburn Hills Police, Birmingham Police, Bloomfield Township Police, and the Oakland Community Health Network (OCHN, the community mental health authority in Oakland County). This federal funding would facilitate the hiring of two mental health clinicians who will be contracted by the three participating agencies from OCHN. It will also provide a vehicle and communication equipment for the clinician so that they can have flexibility to move about freely among the three communities, to respond to crisis situations and follow-up with families, the hospitals, and courts. Funding will also provide much needed Crisis Intervention Team training and Mental Health First Aid training to 100% of all sworn police officers in all three agencies (150 police officers).\n\nCertification Letter\n\nCommerce Township Wastewater Treatment Plant Lystek System Project\n\nRequest Amount: $2,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Commerce Township\n\nFull Street Address of the Intended Recipient: 2009 Township Drive, Commerce Township, MI 48390\n\nExplanation of the request\n\nThe Commerce Township Wastewater Treatment Plant’s current biosolids (sludge) management system requires hauling and disposing of their dewatered sludge at a landfill costing Commerce Township over $350,000 a year. The Plant also provides service for White Lake Township, parts of Novi and Walled Lake, as well as other surrounding communities. The cost of landfill disposal has dramatically increased at each of the three hauling agreements since 2013. The current 2-year agreement expires in May of 2021. In the 2019 contract renewal, there was only one bidder and the rate increased 85% from the previous one-year agreement. The average annualized cost, between 2013 and 2019, is equivalent to 35% a year.\n\nThe Lystek Program provides a resource-recovery alternative to landfill disposal by producing a Class A biofertilizer from the dewatered sludge. The market-ready fertilizer product called LysteGro is a high solids liquid that will be stored in the existing tanks available at the Plant, to be sold and transported to customers utilizing the Lystek Product Management services. The program would eliminate hauling and landfill disposal costs starting in the first year of operation. By teaming up with Lystek System, this will allow more than 3,500 tons of Class B biosolids per year to be diverted from landfills and instead will be converted into a Class A fertilizer that can be used by local farmers.\n\nCertification Letter\n\nLivonia Senior Center Project\n\nRequest Amount: $4,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Livonia\n\nFull Street Address of the Intended Recipient: 33000 Civic Center Drive, Livonia MI 48154\n\nExplanation of the request\n\nWith nearly 19,000 residents age 65 or older, Livonia’s Senior Center is a hub of services and programs for one of southeast Michigan’s largest populations of seniors. The Livonia Senior Center Project is a renovation of the Jack E. Kirksey Recreation Center to accommodate a safer, more accessible, state-of-the-art Senior Center along with an expanded fitness center. The current Livonia Senior Center is a 60-year-old, retro-fitted church that the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed is inadequate for the safety and health of Livonia’s seniors. Small spaces, inadequate HVAC and a lack of accessibility critically restrict the existing Senior Center. Building a new senior center, attached to the Kirksey Recreation Center, will expand Livonia seniors health and fitness opportunities while providing a safe and accessible new space for senior programming. This federal funding would provide for upgrades that allow increased access, larger class spaces, and for social distancing measures to continue after capacity limits are removed.\n\nCertification Letter\n\nMichigan International Technology Center Improvement Project\n\nRequest Amount: $2,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Michigan International Technology Center\n\nFull Street Address of the Intended Recipient: 44065 Six Mile Rd., Northville MI 48168\n\nExplanation of the request\n\nThe Michigan International Technology Center Improvement Project seeks funding for the engineering costs associated with the rebuilding of Five Mile Road, between Beck Rd. and and Ridge Road. The Michigan International Technology Center (MITC) Redevelopment District is a Brownfield Authority created by Plymouth and Northville Townships and the State of Michigan Land Bank.

It will also clean up contaminated sites owned by the State of Michigan. This federal funding for the MITC Improvement Project would help to increase accessibility to the project area, facilitating economic growth for the whole community.\n\nCertification Letter\n\nMilford Village Water System Improvements Project\n\nRequest Amount: $2,000,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Village of Milford\n\nFull Street Address of the Intended Recipient: 1100 Atlantic St. Milford MI 48381\n\nExplanation of the request\n\nThe Village is seeking to bring new water sources online, including transforming their contingency well into their main production well. This project would entail approximately 3,400 feet of 12- or 16-inch transmission main from the new water well to the existing water treatment plant. This recommendation was made in their 2014 Water Reliability Study. The connection of the contingency well to the existing water treatment plant is needed to keep pace with Village demand.\n\nCertification Letter\n\nPlymouth Cultural Center ADA Compliance Project\n\nRequest Amount: $400,000\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Plymouth\n\nFull Street Address of the Intended Recipient: 201 S. Main St. Plymouth, MI 48170\n\nExplanation of the request\n\nThe Plymouth Cultural Center ADA Compliance Project will update the four main public restrooms in the City's recreation facility to achieve full ADA compliance. The Plymouth Cultural Center is the only voting location in the city, and it accommodates four precincts. The building hosts multiple senior citizen classes, events and health clinics. Increasingly, City of Plymouth boards and commissions and local civic organizations use the building's large room for their meetings to accommodate socially distant participants. In addition, the PCC, which is home to an ice arena, hosts hundreds of athletic events every year with thousands of players and spectators. Bringing the PCC restrooms up to full ADA compliance will require structural changes to the building and major plumbing work, since the current system is encased in a concrete slab. Interior walls, ceilings, fixtures, partitions and tile will need to be replaced as well. Bringing the restrooms to ADA compliance will allow our elderly visitors and persons with disabilities to use the facility without hindrance.\n\nCertification Letter\n\nTroy Community Pavilion in Civic Center Campus Project\n\nRequest Amount: $1,500,000\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Troy\n\nFull Street Address of the Intended Recipient: 500 W. Big Beaver Rd., Troy MI 48084\n\nExplanation of the request\n\nThe City of Troy, Michigan, has listened to community members regarding the need for a public gathering space for its residents and business people. The city it lacks a traditional downtown, and has few large public gathering spaces – particularly outdoors. The need for a large outdoor space has been highlighted through the COVID-19 pandemic, as residents and organizations seek spaces to safely host events and meetings. The proposed large pavilion will satisfy this desire by creating a space in the Civic Center Campus, which will be a place to host community events through all of Michigan’s seasons. Events will include a Farmers Market, art showcase events, concerts, ice skating, and general community gathering opportunities.\n\nCertification Letter\n\n911 Dispatch-Emergency Operations Center Project\n\nRequest Amount: $250,000\n\nIntended Recipient: Waterford Township Police Department\n\nFull Street Address of the Intended Recipient: 5150 Civic Center Drive, Waterford MI 48329\n\nExplanation of the request\n\nThe Waterford Dispatch Center has become a regional dispatch center, providing not only 911 police service for Waterford Township but also 911 fire and emergency medical services for surrounding jurisdictions. The dispatch center is also responsible for LEIN services of the 51st District Court and monitoring live video feeds throughout the Waterford Township civic center campus and some Waterford School District facilities. With increased demand on the employees and resources of the department, the current technological capability of the department falls short. The realities of the pandemic have highlighted the shortcomings of the Emergency Operations Center. This federal funding would allow the Waterford Police Department to update their technology, access live video feed, and monitor threats on social media. When dispatchers are better informed, they are better equipped to direct first responders into high risk situations and provide accurate information before arrival, which increases the safety of everyone.\n\nCertification Letter\n\nWhite Lake Civic Center Road and Sidewalk Construction Project\n\nRequest Amount: $1,600,000\n\nIntended Recipient: White Lake Township\n\nFull Street Address of the Intended Recipient: 7525 Highland Road, White Lake MI 48383\n\nExplanation of the request\n\nThe Township of White Lake is in the planning and engineering phase of developing a downtown/main street area, which is intended to serve as the heart of the Township. To that end, the Township’s plan includes construction of a new Township Civic Center, public safety buildings and related roadways, sidewalks and recreational pathways for the benefits of its residents and visitors. This project would include construction of the roads and sidewalks for the downtown area, including a new recreational trail for walking and cycling, which leads to a waterfront public park. Moreover, the project will improve traffic and pedestrian safety, as well as accessibility throughout the downtown area. Long-term, it will provide the opportunity for the Township to construct new municipal and public safety buildings which are desperately needed. Recent events left the Township’s 911 services inoperable due to a power failure as the current generator is undersized due to growth over the years at the Township offices.\n\nCertification Letter\n\nWixom and Novi Beck Road Business Corridor Improvement Project\n\nRequest Amount $4,797,600\n\nIntended Recipient: City of Novi\n\nFull Street Address of the Intended Recipient: City of Novi, 45175 Ten Mile Rd, Novi MI 48375\n\nExplanation of the request\n\nThe request for the Grand River Boulevard to 11 Mile Road Segment of the Beck Road Business Corridor Improvement Project will widen .7 mile of the key arterial Beck Road connecting to Interstate 96 from its current 3-lane configuration to 5 lanes from 11 Mile Road to Grand River Boulevard in the fast-growing City of Novi, Michigan. The project will also create 8-foot pedestrian/bicycle paths on either side of the roadway, providing alternative travel options. The project will improve safety and reduce congestion for the over 28,000 vehicles using the corridor daily to commute to work and for access to nearby hospitals, retail centers, offices, and schools and will also promote alternative transportation modes by creating 8-foot non-motorized paths on both sides of the road with ADA-compliant ramps.\n\nThe 2018 \"Beck Road Three-Year Crash Analysis: 2015-17\" has found that the crash frequency for Beck Road is 10 times the regional average and the overwhelming number of crashes are rear-end collisions. Widening Beck Road to 5 lanes will create a uniform traffic flow that will promote economic competitiveness by significantly increasing access and reducing commute times for the 340 employers along the Beck Road Business Corridor Improvement Project area dependent on Beck Road for access for their employees, customers, and freight traffic. There are over 20,000 manufacturing, healthcare, retail and service-industry jobs on and adjacent to the project area.\n\nCeritifcation Letter\n\nDesignated Project Requests (Transportation and Infrastructure Committee)\n\nOn April 23, 2021 Rep. Stevens requested funding through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s process for Member Designated Projects. Rep. Stevens made the request because of the critical safety benefits from this project and the deep community and bipartisan support for the Beck Road Business Corridor, along with the economic development opportunities the project has the capability of spurring.\n\nProject Name: Beck Road Business Corridor Railroad Grade Crossing Safety Project\n\nLocation: 48393. The project is located at the 3-track, at-grade railroad crossing on Beck Road between West Road and Cartier Drive in the City of Wixom, Michigan.\n\nProject Sponsor: City of Wixom, MI\n\nRequested Amount: $18,612,000\n\nProject overview: The Beck Road Business Corridor Railroad Grade Crossing Safety Project will construct a 5-lane overpass over a current at-grade, 3-track railroad crossing on a busy business corridor with over 28,000 cars daily in the fastest growing section of the Metro Detroit area. There are many industrial and retail concerns lining the Beck Road Business Corridor that must use the congested 2-lane Beck Road Corridor and this dangerous railroad crossing that serves at least 3 daily freight trains. Over 340 Wixom employers near the Beck Road Business Corridor Railroad Grade Crossing Safety Project area depend on Beck Road for access for their employees, customers, and freight traffic. There are approximately 7,000 jobs within one mile on either side of the railroad crossing that travel the corridor. The project will significantly improve traffic safety for a road segment that has a crash frequency 10 times higher than the regional average, with the overwhelming number of crashes being read-end collisions. Based on the “Beck Road Three-Year Crash Analysis” commissioned by the City of Wixom, there were a total of 237 crashes for an annual frequency of 79 crashes in 2015-2017."
