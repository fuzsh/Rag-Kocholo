        "text": "Welcome! Our several years of preparation have blossomed – thanks to many of you contributing time, money and artifacts!\n\nPhase 1 opened May 16th of 2024!. We celebrated a ribbon-cutting Grand Opening July 27th – now all we need is YOU to come visit! Especially Dream Cruisers!\n\n————————————————–\n\nThis striking 35 ft wide mural graces the west wall of the PTM building! It is ready for “selfies” of you and your car (or truck)! There is a great story on how it came about – now running on our YouTube channel – here!\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nWheeled Vehicles: A Legacy of the Pontiac Community!\n\nStarting in the 19th century, the transportation industry became the pulse of Pontiac, MI. This community saw decades of phenomenal “boom” growth, some economic “down” cycles, huge industrialization, and recently a newly re-emerging downtown “avant-garde” culture. The non-profit Pontiac Transportation Museum details this remarkable story, and also is deeply involved in energizing community development and re-vitalization.\n\nSituated in a historic neighborhood location, the museum is well-equipped to reach out to the Pontiac schools and community. Intended museum activities include science, technology, engineering, art, and math outreach to engage youth with perspective of how those technical capabilities historically grew their own community. As a drawing card for city visitors, the Museum supports local economic development – hotels and restaurants are typical beneficiaries of a healthy museum culture!\n\nExplore our website for images relate to Pontiac Transportation heritage! It is an intriguing story!\n\nThe entirety of the Southeast Michigan community takes great pride in their automotive history. Even beyond the local interest, car and truck enthusiasts tend to travel in “cruises” that make a museum their destination. This became obvious in the 2023 Fiero 40th and GMC Motorhome 50th anniversaries that PTM hosted, Beyond car enthusiasts, the Pontiac Transportation Museum scope appeals broadly to truck, RV, bus, and wartime conversion enthusiasts; and people just fascinated by how this community of diverse ethnicities profoundly affected American culture and lifestyles.\n\nPTM is pleased to recognize some of our important partners and supporters in the community:"
