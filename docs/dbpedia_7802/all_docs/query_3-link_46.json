        "text": "The housewife in Engelwood, N.J., who shops the local supermarket with her mother is also the official “Queen of Latin Song,” with partisan audiences that stretch from New York's “barrio” to Venezuela and beyond. She also has no agent and answers her own phone.\n\nShe is Lupe Garcia, known as La Lupe to her fans, and she was one of the headliners Friday night at the second Festival of Latin Music at Madison Square Garden.\n\nLa Lupe has always included several songs in English during her performances and has recorded an album in English. But the bulk of her work comes from the loyal and strong Latin market across the country.\n\nTrouble With Castro\n\nLa Lupe was born in the poor Oriente Province in Cuba, arriving in America in 1962. Her father, sister and brother still live on the island, but they never get to hear La Lupe's records. “I send them but they just never arrive,” she said. La Lupe maintains she has always had trouble with Premier Fidel Castro. “He say I am taking popularity away from him when I am in Cuba, and they do not like me singing in English. He had me fired twice from nightclubs, and when I buy my own club he take that away from me. He also take my money and my car. So I invent a little concert in Mexico—just to get out. was in Mexico for two weeks and never went back to Cuba.”\n\nBasically unknown in Mexico, La Lupe decided that America held more promise for her. “So I go to Miami. There are a lot of Cubans in Miami, and I get a contract to sing in clubs there. Then I think New York is better so I buy a little car for $100 and drive up to New York. I live on 97 and Central Park West.”\n\nNew York was not better at first, and part of La Lupe's metropolitan experience included living on welfare. But eventually she was offered a job singing and recording with the Latin bandleader Tito Puente. It was the start of lucrative partnership for both. They had a string of Latin hit recordings (La Lupe's own sales are now nearing three million.).\n\nSays La Lupe: “I get 10 hits out of 12 songs singing with Tito. He gets the money because they are under his name, but don't care because now I am famous.” Around this time she was also singing with Mongo Santamaria, and a lot of their appearances were at the old Birdland Club. It was here that the Latin‐jazz disc jockey Symphony Sid (also on the Friday Festival program) named La Lupe the Queen of Latin Song—she says that she wore white satin and mink for a year in honor of the title.\n\n‘I Get Involved’\n\nOnstage, La Lupe is nothing if not energetic. She will pull her hair, stamp her feet until they are swollen and even scratch her face in the emotion of the moment. La Lupe calls it espiritu santo. She admits: “I get involved. I'm Capricorn —once in your life you get it, and you have to take it. When I'm singing, I get pimples, goose pimples. Goose bumps. When first started singing in Cuba, they called me crazy. They didn't understand at first that was part of the trouble.\n\n“But now, with this Latin Festival, with all these new clubs opening . . . this is chance we've never had before in America. It makes me very proud.”"
