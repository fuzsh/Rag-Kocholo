        "text": "In a testimonial at church, La Lupe spoke in rapid staccato, her words coming out in short bursts of energy as raspy as her singing voice. ''They call me La Lupe, La Yiyiyi, the queen of Latin song,'' she said.\n\nShe told church members that she had once been rich and famous, that she had had mink coats, expensive cars and a big house. Then her life unraveled in a string of misfortune. Her husband fell mentally ill, she said; she had to go on welfare; she fell down while hanging a curtain and injured her back; her apartment burned; she and her daughter ended up in a homeless shelter.\n\n''Sometimes,'' La Lupe told the congregation, her words preserved on tape, ''I asked my Lord Jesus Christ why did I have to go through so much to meet him.''\n\nHer indomitable character, and the free spirit of a performer whose showmanship stunned and thrilled audiences, is the subject of a play, ''La Lupe: My Life, My Destiny,'' by Carmen Rivera, which begins performances on June 27 at the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater.\n\nLa Lupe, who died in 1992 poor and largely forgotten at 53 (Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx listed the cause as cardiac arrest), is also the subject of a movie project, with the film and television actress Lauren Velez in the lead role, and a documentary by Ela Troyano.\n\nThe new interest in La Lupe can be partly explained by the commercial appeal of Latin music today, but fascination with the singer has endured in many quarters. Her soulful voice has been featured in ballet productions and in the films of the Spanish director Pedro Almod√≥var, and much of her music has been reissued in CD's.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
