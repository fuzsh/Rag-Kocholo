        "text": "“When I was back there in seminary school….”\n\nOh, wait, wrong opening.\n\nWhen I was a young dad, we rented a house in Bearsville, NY every summer. It was a cute little house on Pond Road, just off Wittenberg Road in Ulster County.\n\nThere, me, my wife and little son would frolic all summer. We’d fish in the Ashokan Reservoir. We’d swim in Wilson State Park. We’d eat huge pancakes at Sweet Sue’s in Phoenicia, and cook out in the backyard, and play with the neighbor, Doug, and his wife and kids and their doggie, Tio. Doug was a contractor and the kids were allowed to climb all over the heavy equipment, even the skidder.\n\nWe would take our son to Wonder Works on 375, where an amazing playground/fortress of wood decking material offered safe ways for him to climb, jump, play with other kids, and generally exhaust himself in the fresh air.\n\nOn crappy days, we’d have breakfast, play some rummy, and then agree: “MALL DAY!!!” We’d drive east on 28, and then head north, up to the Hudson Valley Mall. For a Brooklyn family, everything about the area was a novelty, from playing outdoors without a care, to shopping in big box stores, to walking around a real mall.\n\nThere was a multiplex with big seats and no gum on the floor, unlike the Plaza Twin on Flatbush, which was totally shkeevatz, albeit nearby. There was Sears. There was a food court. There was an arcade. SKEEBALL!!!! My son would roll doody-brown balls into little target-holes and, for his efforts, win hundreds of little paper tickets that he eagerly traded for wonderful prizes, like a big fat pencil with a cartoony large eraser. Such treasures!\n\nLast week, my wife and I rented a lovely place near Cooper Lake, about three miles from our old summertime property. We celebrated our anniversary, had wonderful dinners out, swam in North/South Lake, barbecued and, when the weather got crappy, we looked at each other and said: “MALL DAY!!!”\n\nWe drove to the Hudson Valley Mall, expecting to relive those halcyon days of our child-rearing past.\n\nWell, it wasn’t like it was “when I was back there in seminary school…” We’d never been to a dead mail before. Wow! There was a HUGE empty parking lot populated only by a fat young guy in trucker hat and sloppy shorts pulling a mule-train of shopping carts back to Target (pronounced Tar-JHAY by us sophisticated downstate New Yorkers), where one could buy everything from ice cream to hand towels ($2.50! All-cotton! Huzzah!)\n\nBut there was a behemoth — Sears — stripped of its signage, crabgrass growing on its front sidewalk, like a Mad Max or Escape From New York backlot set.\n\nWe expected to find a natty Rod Serling with Brylcreemed hair in front of those doors, holding a lit Lucky and intoning, “You are about to enter another dimension…a journey not only of sight and sound, but of mind…submitted for your approval, the end game of post-Covid, rogue capitalism gone awry…a hard lesson to be learned…in The Twilight Zone.”\n\nTarget was still doing business. There was a Dick’s Sporting Goods. And there was the multiplex.\n\nIt was raining, so we went to the movies. Whoa. It was recently redecorated. Fancy, even. But so so empty. We asked the quartet of thumb-twiddling theater workers if the place was open. They nodded yes and we selected non-reclining seats for Deadpool and Wolverine. I noticed no other seats selected by other patrons when we chose our location on the check-in screen.\n\nWe ordered the medium popcorn. Medium! Ha! It was as big as a five-bottle wine bucket. A series of ads for local businesses — carpenters, dentists, realtors — ran, too loudly, and portrayed men and women in very uncool haircuts and apparel.\n\nSome other patrons filed in to the enormous theater number two. The coming attractions offered a parade of action-adventure pictures. Lots of explosions and VFX.\n\nI’m not an action adventure movie type, and I am not a Marvel aficionado. BUT: “Deadpool and Wolverine” was AMAZEBALLS. It was witty as a mofo, and the casting, cameos, dialogue, and SFX all served the entertainment. The ten or so patrons in #2 all laughed at the throwaway lines and myriad inside-baseball cultural references.\n\nI loved it.\n\nMaybe there is hope for us in our post-Covid, post-brick and mortar retail world. Maybe we’ll survive without H&Ms, and Sears, and crappy mall Asian and Italian food.\n\nMaybe it’s really all about finding joy where you can get it, like finding salamanders on ferns after the summer rain, or helping grandma catch a big bass in the Ashokan, or playing soccer with your little son in the beautiful Boiceville high school field. Laughing your head off at a big-budget, funny as hell, blockbuster summer movie.\n\nOr…sharing a smile, a tiny moment of joy, with the woman at an Interstate rest stop Starbucks who wore a sweatshirt that read: “My vice president is a black woman”.\n\nShe caught my gaze. “You may have to update that shirt in November,” I whispered.\n\n“Thank you,” she said, with a wink.\n\nSo: “Submitted for your approval…a couple in (very) late middle age wander into the now-deserted mall of their memory, only to discover that there is still hope, and joy to be found, nurtured, and, yes, savored…even in the farthest reaches of The Twilight Zone…”\n\nI played stickball on 190th Street, pitched pennies in back of my apartment house, bought folding knives at Cousins on Fordham Road, and went to NYC public schools at a time when subjects such as music, art, and literature were summarily dismissed as topics for “pussies”. (Full disclosure: to this very day, I really don’t know my flowers, trees, or birds.)\n\nSo how did I come to build a career based upon communications, with two published books on workplace innovation, three collections of short stories, and three ghost-written books under my belt? How did I come to learn guitar in middle age, and piano in (very) late middle-age?\n\nI attribute my admittedly meager accomplishments to (a) sheer force of will, (b) some good friends and educators, and (c) free-form FM radio.\n\nFirst, force of will. Maybe it was the challenge (“I’ll show YOU!”). Maybe it was my Eastern European genes, which triumphed over my humble Bronx tenement beginnings (my grandma came from Vilna, a center of learning and education, and there were rabbis in my family, back in the Ould Sod, which in my case was the Pale of Settlement). But the more my family and neighborhood buds said “no way”, the more determined I became.\n\nSecond, I lucked out with some chance meetings of new friends in high school, and some supportive teachers and professors. My friends Richie (of blessed memory) and Eric introduced me to the world’s of photography, music and electronics (and how I pored over those Lafayette catalogs back in the day), and literature. In junior high, Mr. Goldberg opened the classroom window and let the snow fly in, as he read to us from Dr. Zhivago. In high school, Mr. Halvey and Ms. Simon took Shakespeare’s prose (which had been impenetrable for me) and broke it down so I could see and feel the timeless emotions and behavioral patterns. In college, Mr. Charyn (just named to read at the upcoming Olympics), coaxed quality sentences out of me. Later, two writers from the Village Voice, Paul Cowan (of blessed memory) and Richard Goldstein, encouraged me, at NYU Continuing Education, to keep pushing with my writing, I was exhausted from long days of full-time work at a thankless, low-paying insurance job back then, and their words fueled my “when pig’s fly” flights of fancy.\n\nFinally, free-form FM radio and, in particular, WOR-FM — which morphed into WNEW-FM. On my Lafayette component stereo ($147 for amp, tuner, Garrard turntable and KLH speakers, if memory serves), I listened to Rosko, Alison Steele, Scot Muni, Jonathan Schwartz, Dave Herman, and many others — the red tuner needle never moved from 102.7.\n\nThere, I dreamed of a wider world, for they’d mix Hendrix with Satie with James Brown (“good GOD!”) with Lady Day with Miles. When I heard cuts from Sketches of Spain segue to Judy Collins to Sgt. Pepper’s Day in the Life, my little Bronx pea-brain exploded and I knew, I just KNEW, there were bigger things for me out there, and that somehow there was a tunnel out of my early punch ball prison.\n\nAh, yes, tomorrow is Father’s Day. Dear old dad. I hope to hell I was a better dad to my son than my dad was to me.\n\nI remember friends and acquaintances remarking on the relationship between me and Dee (my grown son). They’d smile as we played together when he was a small boy and we exploded in goofy laughter. “How’d you do it?” they’d ask.\n\n“Easy,” I’d reply. “I just think of how my dad would respond or act in any given situation, and do 180-degrees the opposite.” It was a facile response, but not really that far off. I wrote about him, dear old dad, in my new collection, “When Paris Beckons” — here’s a reading of it:\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-305683472/39-bye-byes-in-order-61224?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1X0r9jd2iysOFj0V5sFU0sRjyzwoifAuT5Vr3QqciBvwTFItyMtTV07gA_aem_ZmFrZWR1bW15MTZieXRlcw\n\nHe was a piece of work, as was his brother, based on info from my cousin. To be honest, I can think of things I did with and to Dee that I wish I hadn’t done and I’m sure those stupid, hurtful actions are costing him big-time in shrink bills to this very day.\n\nAnd I know I’m not alone. What is it about the toxic father/son dynamic, and that King Lear/Lion in Winter bullshit? I am reminded of two scenes in biopics that caused me to snot-cry right in the movie theater. One was “Walk the Line”, about Johnny Cash, and the other was Rocketman, about Elton John,\n\nThis scene shows the up-and-coming Johnny Cash getting the skin peeled off his nads by his jealous, small-man-of-a-dad. Check this out (and cue it up to about 1:30, because the sound is not great):\n\nNow check this one out. where Elton goes to give his dad a gem-encrusted Chopard watch for a present, only to get grandly rebuffed.\n\nIn both cases, I wanted to reach into the movie screen and punch those dads’ lights out. It was as if a Weber chimney starter ignited in my guts. That’s how bad it was.\n\nAnd then I remembered my own classic scene: the Brooks Brothers Picnic Set Incident.\n\nIt was a time when my career was on the ascent and I was making good money. My mom (another story for another day) said she was trying to get my dad to take her out more, maybe have a picnic in the park. You know, do something fun for a change. I had a flash.\n\nI was working in 60 West 42nd Street, near all the big men’s retailers, and picked out a Brooks Brothers wicker picnic set for my dad’s birthday. I thought it would be perfect. It was quality, and complete, and first-rate. It was classy and I thought he’d appreciate that. And maybe that was the problem, for upon inspection of said gift, his face looked like he just opened a specimen box from Cologuard.\n\nI found it all damp and moldy in their basement years later. It was never used once.\n\nSo, yeah, happy Father’s Day. We’ll see Dee and Mo and the whole mishpocha tomorrow. Hope it goes well.\n\nThere are those who say that listening to a certain song puts them right back into a particular place, like an aural time machine.\n\nI believe that is true, but arguably more powerful is the sensation of certain scents — olifactory stimuli — that reel back the years. What are yours? Here are just a few of mine:\n\nThe Smell of Gasoline: I love the scent of gasoline. I immediately recall visits to the Texaco station with my dad in our ’53 Pontiac Super Chief. I can see him wearing navy blue canvas “camp shoes”. Dad is streaking up the windshield with the oily sponge-squeegee at the Bailey Avenue gas station, while Mike, the owner, checked the oil, tires, and filled ‘er up with high-test. “This is what a man does,” the four-year old me surmised. To this day, the smell of gasoline triggers a sense of excitement and “adventure”.\n\nAcoustic Guitars: Open a hard shell guitar case and inhale that heady scent of nitrocellulose, glue, and tone woods. Intoxicating. Wild. In the sense of an upscale cigar store. You immediately are perfumed with the magic of music yet to be made. The promise of fun, and of the exhilaration of creativity. You remember the famous Einstein quote, right? “Creativity is intelligence having fun.”\n\nAlexander’s Department Store (Fordham Road location): I can’t speak for the other stores, but this one? It had a particular scent, for sure. Was it the off-gassing from the 190th Street vestibule carpeting? Cleaning solvents? Rat poison? Scented O2 blasted through HVAC ducts to energize the patrons, like a Vegas casino? Whatever it was, it was unforgettable, a confluence of chemical scents that signaled the start of a deep dive into the world of consumer consumption, Bronx bargain-edition. Going to Alexander’s was like going to the beach, in the sense that the purchasing tides rolled in, and rolled out. You bought something, took it home, realized it was crap, brought it back, got a store credit, bought something else, rinse-repeat. Shopping there? It wasn’t a necessity. It was an activity.\n\n“The Woods” (Pine Forest Edition): Nothing beats the smell of “the woods”, especially a pine forest. Understand this: I was never a deeply religious kid. Nevertheless my one time at a sleepaway summer camp, at age eleven or so, was the Boy Scout Ten-Mile River’s location for Jewish kids. It was on the border of NYS and Pennsylvania, not far from Port Jervis. Anyhoo: The days are hot and the nights are cool, for we are in the Catskill Mountains, 100 miles from the oppression of summer-in-the-city. It is my first Friday night at camp. I am told we will walk through the forest to the temple for Shabbat services. I am disappointed, for I am not observant and would rather be playing. The sun dips. The air cools. We ford streams and climb over mossy rocks, under a canopy of conifers. The air is perfumed with pine, enhanced by top notes of sunbaked wildflowers. Finally, my group, Troop 228, arrives at a hand-hewed outdoor temple. There are rows of benches in front of the ark. We file in, suddenly solemn, fallen pine cones and browned needles at our feet. The sun sits low. Fireflies flit. I breathe in, deeply. A woodpecker blasts into birch. I am tired from a day of fresh air exertion. I am calm, and at peace. And then, I look heavenward and think: “Oh, I ‘get it’ now!” For in my own roundabout way, I found religion.\n\nHappy Mother’s Day. OK, that’s out of the way. Here’s more important stuff.\n\nI’m not a big poetry person. Maybe I’m not intelligent enough to read the writers’ tea leaves. Maybe I ask: why did they chop up the lines like that? It all could’ve been just one paragraph and c’est ca, you know?\n\nBut. I read Modern Poetry by Diane Seuss, a writer from nowhere’sville Michigan. Just like I’m from nowhere’sville, NYC. And I have to say: whoa!\n\nRead this interview with her by my friend and uber-talented poet, William Lessard.\n\nShe reminds me: just keep writing. Full speed ahead. Damn the torpedoes. It’s work. Hard work, and hard work is honorable.\n\nA remembrance: one day I was old enough to earn my adult library card. I was a punk kid, but no longer confined to the tiny children’s book section of the shoebox that was the Jerome Park branch of the New York Public Library.\n\nIt was one flight up from a dry cleaning store on University Avenue and the place smelled like Perchloroethylene (PERC). This is the most common solvent used for dry cleaning in the United States. PERC is a reproductive toxicant, neurotoxicant, potential human carcinogen, and a persistent environmental pollutant. In other words, it’s poison.\n\nI LOVED the scent of PERC. It was sweet and soft and I equated that sensation with the safety, warmth, and value the library afforded me, during my chaotic (ha! understatement of the year) early childhood.\n\nAnd that first day, with my new adult library card, I — a pitzl — picked out the biggest, thickest, heaviest book — WITH NO PICTURES — and checked it out. When I got it home, I started reading it, and quickly realized I had no idea what it was about.\n\nBut I knew it must have been important, for it to warrant all that weight.\n\nIn time, I checked out more books, six at a clip — the maximum allowed by NYPL rules at the time — and began to digest the words. My brain was a python eating a goat. The process was slow, but it did happen.\n\nI cherished the after-school time in that poisoned, PERC-scented, library. That space kept me safe. And provided a soft place to hear myself.\n\nKristi Noem, Governor of South Dakota, simultaneously shot her pup in a gravel pit and her political future in the butt. After she shot poor Cricket, she turned her shotgun on a male goat that won Kristi’s disfavor, somehow only wounded it and, as it lay in agony, strolled back to her truck to fetch another shell and put the screaming animal down.\n\nSad as that was, it was nothing compared to the impact on my seven-year old brain of the time Margie’s brother, Shirl, killed Tinkerbell. Tink was Margie’s fourteen-year old, rheumy-eyed toy poodle. Shirl slammed the poor thing’s head in the door of Margie’s fridge.\n\nAlcohol may have been involved.\n\nMy mom told me the story over dinner one night back when I was a kid. We were having boiled “new” potatoes, Del Monte canned peas and carrots, and beef tongue, which I watched my mom prepare. First, she trimmed the thick, disgusting bottom part of the tongue, peeled off the outer membrane (“and the nicotine stains,” my dad “joked”), boiled the crap out of the grotesque, meaty mass with garlic and onions in a white enameled spaghetti pot and, finally, sliced it up (way too thickly, unlike the nearly transparent, silky smooth slices the counter guy proffered at Tower Deli on Kingsbridge Road). As a result, the lengua was repulsively chewy, saved only by smearing mounds of Gulden’s Spicy Brown mustard over each rubbery slice. “Don’t complain,” my mother said. “If you’re hungry, you’ll eat.” (I’m teeing up a Mother’s Day post, as you can see.)\n\nBut I digress.\n\nYes, Margie’s brother was named Shirl. See, Margie came from Kentucky. My dad explained that Down South they still were fighting the Civil War and searching for newcomers’ “Jew Horns”. He said that parents Down South sometimes used girl’s names for their boys (see also: Johnny Cash’s song “A Boy Named Sue” — and Lindsay “Ladybug” Graham, the latter being another story for another day).\n\nShirl came up to The Bronx after a frantic phone call from his sister. He immediately landed a job in a diner as a $90/week dishwasher, which even the seven-year old me knew was chump change for a grown man. But our building’s men-folk thought Shirl was cool. He drove a beat-up white Ford Galaxie 500 with the 427 engine mated to a four-on-the-floor manual transmission. In the glovebox, he had a scuffed .38 revolver, a pint of Rebel Yell, and a small stack of two-ounce Dixie cups.\n\nSo the guys would hang out across the street from our apartment building, listen to the ballgame over the Galaxie’s AM radio, and knock back bourbon shots. One time, Shirl let me load and unload his pistol. My dad took it from me when I sighted it at a white and red No Parking sign.\n\nMargie, being from, yes, Down South, had a heavy twang. She chain-smoked Newports, and didn’t so much “walk” as “sashay”, in a way that clearly grabbed the attention of the dads in our building. “She’s got that southern sway,” my pop would say, as his pal, Charlie Cohen, who toiled in a corrugated box factory, smiled, ever- appreciative of a well-turned ankle.\n\nMargie was married to a connected guy. That kind of connected. He was a very quiet, dark haired sort who barely made eye contact as he slithered down the street, scanning ahead for trouble. He would disappear for long stretches and, in time, I learned that his absences meant he was “away”. “Upstate”.\n\n“Guys are following me,” Margie, highball in hand, confided to my mom as she put up pot roast for dinner. “I’m afraid.”\n\nMy parents were a lot of things, but savvy to the world of wise guys they were not. “Don’t be paranoid, Marge,” my mom said, dispensing all the worldly wisdom a forty-something outer-borough woman still dominated by her Vilna-born mother could muster. “Don’t go into orbit. No one’s out to get you.”\n\nThey were, though. Out to get her, that is. It had to do with her hubby’s line of work. My dad laughed and said Margie’s husband was in “import-export”.\n\nSo Shirl’s role was to act as a two-legged pit bull while her husband — oh, let’s call him “Silent Sam” — was doing his latest bit “upstate”.\n\nNow Margie had a flock of drop-kick toy poodles, who yipped all day and apparently screwed all night, for there were always puppies aplenty roaming her ground floor flat, enough to support her booming puppy mill business. Red-rimmed eyes watering, they’d cluster around the fridge whenever Shirl went to get another Schlitz. They surrounded him, barked, and begged for grub. The pack leader was a fourteen-year old bitch named Tinkerbell who yipped her bloody heart out.\n\nShirl’s presence kept the bad guys at bay, at least for awhile, for his pheromones served the same purpose as a house cat brought in to walk around a rodent infested apartment. That is, solely for its scent, which kept mice away.\n\nThe downside was that Shirl was, shall we say, erratic. Today, he’d be called neuro-diverse. Back then, he was considered a good natured, nutty, drunk. He wandered about the neighborhood in his white tee-shirts and rumpled chinos, cadging drinks and smokes off day drinkers in the myriad Fordham Road bars.\n\nHe was able to do this because within days of starting his new job, he missed shifts and was unceremoniously canned after just two weeks, Not a fan of alternate side parking, he amassed a thicket of tickets and crammed each one into the Galaxie’s glovebox, just under his pistol.\n\nOne sleepy dusty summer day, Shirl weaved into Margie’s kitchen for a breakfast brew. There, behind a bowl of egg salad-gone-iridescent, was a solitary can of Schlitz.\n\nOne Schlitz wouldn’t do, for Shirl was nursing a hangover bigger than Mandingo. What to do? Shirl leaned hard on the open fridge door, unshaven and unwashed, an insult to unmade beds. His head throbbed as a herd of yip dogs yelped in a key that made Bernard Herrmann’s shower scene score in Psycho sound as soothing as Swan Lake.\n\nAs always, the leader of the pack was Tinkerbell.\n\n“Tinkerbell,” Shirl screamed, “Knock it the hell off, girl!” Tinkerbell’s response was to yip faster, louder, and in a higher key. Shirl reached for the last can of beer.\n\nAs he did, Tinkerbell’s tiny jaws locked up on Shirl’s shin with the ferocity of a seven-pound pit bull. “Dang!” Shirl cried, simultaneously slugging Schlitz and wagging his foot in a futile attempt at dislodging Tink’s tiny teeth.\n\nFinally, Tink’s jaws released. But the forward force of Shirl’s leg swing propelled the geriatric doggie head-first, into the fridge. Out of pain, rage, and sheer animal instinct, Shirl slammed the fridge door shut.\n\nAll Shirl heard was a high-pitched “ERP!” All the other doggies stopped yelping and slunk away, heads turned back for one last look at their fallen den mother, dead as a doornail on the linoleum floored kitchen of Margie’s flat.\n\nFrom a highly reputable source, the super’s son (my bestie), I learned that Shirl wrapped Tink in doubled-up plastic bags from Merit Farms on Fordham Road, and dumped the critter in the garbage, where it was incinerated along with Mrs. Waloshin’s frayed old brassieres and Mrs. Gibney’s Sunday dinner chicken carcasses.\n\nI further learned, as we ate our dinner of beef tongue and new potatoes, that Margie saw a white Eldorado tailing her that very day and was in such a state that she never said a word about poor Tinkerbell.\n\nDinner finished, we did the dishes and went back outside to catch fireflies and light punks with our dads’ Zippo lighters. The very thought of Shirl’s deed chilled my soul and I hugged my doggie, Topper, tightly. He snarled at me, so I let him go play with his soup bone. I remember the seven-year old me thinking this: Topper knows I would never slam his head with a refrigerator door. He is a cool dog and bit only one person that I know of, but it was Norman’s fault anyhow. At least that what dad said.\n\nAnd all this was largely forgotten, locked in my memory’s hard drive, until news of Kristi Noem’s heartless execution of Cricket and the goat broke just a few days ago. Amazing how the mind works.\n\n(Oh, and by the way, at least 90 percent of the stuff in this story is true.)\n\nOne month ago, we rescued two four-month old kittens. The rescue lady gave them funky names and we immediately renamed them. “We dub thee: Felix and Oscar.”\n\nThey are indeed an odd couple. The local rescue lady found them in back of a Target store on 225th Street in the Bronx. They were dumpster divers. Who knows what dangers they had to flee to stay alive just four months. “What kind of food do they eat?” we asked the rescue lady, wondering wet vs. dry, chicken vs. seafood, “pate” vs. chunky.\n\n“They’ll eat anything,” she said. “Give them good stuff, but as for flavors and textures, they are not picky.”\n\nShe was right. When it’s mealtime, I bang on the food dishes with a spoon and they gallop behind me to their feeding spot, bury their noggins in their grub, and chow down.\n\nThey play-fight all night, like two ten-year old boys on a sleepover. They run through the house with reckless abandon. They play with toys. They kiss each other and fall asleep. An hour later, they’re at it again, swiping and swatting and being healthy kittens.\n\nThey take care of each other. We have a big apartment and they don’t have the run of the entire place. Not yet. So we keep the doors to some rooms closed. Off-limits to Felix and Oscar.\n\nThe other day, Oscar came over to me and snuggled. I petted him and he walked five yards away, and returned for petting. Rinse, repeat. Four times. It occurred to me: I haven’s seen Felix in awhile. Uh-oh…\n\nI got up. Oscar led the way, tail straight up. I heard desperate kitten meowing, high pitched and pathetic. Hmmm. Where was Felix? He wasn’t in the hall closet. Maybe the powder room? Nope. Maybe the master bedroom? Nope. My office? Nope. Meowwwwwww. I opened the door to my wife’s office.\n\nMEOWWWWW. There he was. Felix was lost and scared. How he got in there, I’ll never know. And they ain’t talking. This is the Bronx. Snitches get stitches.\n\nOscar knew, though. He looked out for his red-headed brother, and enlisted my aid.\n\nAnd I became sad. So I had to do a deep dive to figure out what was bothering me. Didn’t take long. My sister and I are estranged. We once were besties, but that was a long, long time ago. We were dumpster divers in the central Bronx. We ate anything. I was found, but not my sister. Her life’s been tough and her struggles turned her bitter and dangerous to me. I tried. I really tried, to make the relationship work. No bueno. Time and time again she kneecapped me. Dirty deeds. Inappropriate behavior. I just couldn’t anymore.\n\nSo now, I see how our rescue kittens, Felix and Oscar, two tabbies, interact. They have a great chemistry. Two completely different personalities, but buds nevertheless. They have each other’s backs. One lies, and the other swears to it.\n\nSometimes the Kryptonite leaches out. I think about what might have been. Ah well. Woulda, coulda, shoulda.\n\n“Through thick and through thin,\n\nAll out or all in.\n\nAnd whether it’s win, place or show.\n\nWith you for me and me for you,\n\nWe’ll muddle through whatever we do.\n\nTogether, wherever we go.”\n\nYesterday my wife and I got into our blue time machine — ok, it’s a Subaru, but whatever — and hurtled back 40 years.\n\nWe drove 15 miles to Jackson Heights, a lovely bedroom community in Queens, NY.\n\nAh, the old sod. We lived there from 1977 to 1985. We were kids.\n\nWe bit the bullet and moved to a lovely Jackson Heights “junior four” from our one bedroom on West 21st Street, because our Manhattan landlord jacked our rent to a lofty $275 a month.\n\nWe hated it there back in the bad old days of rampant NYC crime. It was affordable, but dull, and not particularly safe. Plus, all our friends lived in “the city”. In the late seventies, Brooklyn was still a dicey backwater. We figured we’d save money for a few years, and move back to where most of our friends lived. We figured wrong.\n\nWe lived in Jackson Heights at the time of Son of Sam, and so we called our apartment building (“The Berkeley”) The Berkowitz. My wife would wrap her red hoodie around her head when we walked back to our apartment at night. Why? “It’s my Son of Sam helmet,” she’d explain to perplexed guests.\n\nThere were shell casings on the glass-strewn courts where I played pick-up b-ball. There were cocaine gang shoot-’em-ups. There was gay-bashing.\n\nOur apartment was gorgeous (sunken living room, roomy eat-in kitchen, so many closets that many were just empty). Our block was leafy. But it wasn’t “the city”.\n\nOne day the super plopped a document at our doorstep. It was a red-herring. I was a kid and had no idea what that meant. But I soon understood it was our ticket out of Jackson Heights. A few years later we flipped the apartment and moved to Park Slope, which was, as they say, “on the come.” It was 1985. The crack epidemic was just around the corner. But we survived and the neighborhood thrived, to the point where it became the butt of jokes, a place where tykes were allowed to run amok in restaurants, boutiques, and even bars.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nOnly one thing tied us to Jackson Heights over the ensuing years: our safety deposit box at Queens Community Bank on Northern Boulevard. They kept “our family jewels” (actually just “important papers”) because no Brooklyn bank near us had a vault.\n\nFrom time to time, we pulled important family papers out of the vault. There was hardly anything left in our runty Box 141. Fast forward forty years. I received a letter from the bank. It was sold. The bank was scheduled for renovation. I was asked to remove the remaining contents of my box.\n\nHence the time machine back to our youth.\n\nWe drove around the old sod. There stood The Berkowitz. It was beautifully maintained, as ever. But New York City is all about change, and this neighborhood had changes aplenty. All for the better.\n\nI thought about the old sod in recent years, whenever I read of the morgue trucks that backed up Elmhurst General, just blocks from our door. Jackson Heights was ravaged by Covid. The Grim Reaper had a field day. But our sense was the neighborhood turned the corner.\n\nThe Arepa Lady (who started her business with a cart under the Roosevelt Avenue EL trestles) had a real retail space right around the corner from The Berkowitz! A cool espresso shop replaced the crummy one-chair barber just down the street. The old basketball courts with Mobius strips for rims were transformed into a kiddie-park green-space that was a wonderland for tykes. A French bakery rivalling anything on Rue Saint-Honore sold masterful macarons.\n\nThere was a Greenstreets, bikes-and-pedestrians-only initiative on 34th Avenue! And restaurants galore!\n\nBack in the day, my wife and I would repair to the Mark Twain Diner on Northern Boulevard for standard chee-burgee fare. It was a bit down-at-the-heels, but affordable and nearby. Now? It’s the Jax Inn Diner, and we’re here to report that it was hopping and VERY good.\n\nWe ate our breakfast and, for a brief moment, we were in our late twenties again. It was a time of crazy parties and lots of laughter, for the lion’s share of our lives lie ahead. We worked hard, and played hard.\n\nWe left Jackson Heights in 1985 and began our quarter-century Brooklyn residency. We had long, rewarding careers, got out of the NYC-native’s provincial mindset, and thrived in a much wider world. Our co-workers and clients were, indeed, some of the best and brightest. We raised our son in a glorious neighborhood.\n\nBut yesterday, forty years on, we were back to a time when we had to take a step down in order to get ahead. We thought about those days, equal parts struggle and hope, as we paid the check at the Jax Inn, got back in our time machine-slash-Subaru, drove down Northern Boulevard to 69th Street, turned right onto on the BQE, and headed home. But it won’t be long before we’re back, because I have a hankering for the roast chicken at Pio Pio on Northern Boulevard and 85th Street. And maybe some dumplings at Phayul on 74th Street, and….and…\n\nOnce, I loved so many of them. Retailers! I’m talking stores, here!\n\n“To all the stores I’ve loved before\n\nI traveled in and out your doors\n\nI’m glad they came along\n\nI dedicate this song (I dedicate this song)\n\nTo all the stores I’ve loved before.”\n\nAh, Rabsons. On the north side of 57th Street, across from Scandinavian Ski, and the upstairs hair salon where I sat patiently waiting for an apprentice stylist to cut my hair for free (for I was un hombre pobre once upon a time). Rabsons had the finest stereo equipment, and knowledgeable staff. There, I bought BIC cassette players, Thorens turntables, KLH speakers. It was a major step up from Lafayette’s, where I got my start in stereo component equipment.\n\nJoe’s Army Navy...le sigh!!! My Fordham Road favorite! Once I started working at the NYPL on Marion Avenue as a 15-year old, I was rolling in dough, for I made $1/hour as a page. I bought my own shirts, jeans, Li’l Abner work boots, and sweatshirts at Joe’s. I spent hours in front of their windows near Jerome Avenue, planning my next purchases before buying new screens for my pipe at the cigar store on the corner. It was never the same for me, though, after the big fire. Although my dad bought fire-sale sneakers there for $1/pair, and wore them even though they smelled like ashes.\n\nEagle Provisions…be still, my foolish heart. This palace of Polish provisions gave me so much. Kielbasa. Kabonosy. Zywiec beer!!! Chrusciki! How many shirts did I ruin with your powdered sugar goodness? Where the grandpa would rub the buzz cut of my three year old son as I wheeled the kid around the narrow aisles of this Brooklyn mainstay on Fifth Avenue @18th Street. The family sold the building and I hear it’s now a condo. With an acai bar on the ground floor. WTAF!!!! Jaka szkoda, indeed. What a shame!\n\nUptown, it’s Alexander’s! I saved the best for last. Alexander’s was where I bought my recorded music, as a teen. Albums stamped “C” were $2.99. D’s were $3.49. E’s (usually double albums) were $3.99. The record department was in the basement. I entered through the 190th Street doors, heavy glass barriers to the world o’retail within. There was a certain solemnity to entering this sacred space. The vestibule had a scent of carpet off-gas. Or, maybe they piped in oxygen to energize the customer experience, as they do in Vegas casinos. For music, though, this was the place, along with Spinning Disc, Music Makers, and Cousin’s (where I got my German-made K55; another story for another day). George Farkas, Brooklyn native, opened this particular store in 1933. All the stores were closed by ’92.\n\nI’ve loved many stores. These are but a few. Now, stores are quaint. Streets are blocked with UPS, FedX, Amazon, Fresh Direct, and Pea Pod trucks — and so many more. The goods come to you. Get them, return them, get new ones, return those…it’s as regular as the tides.\n\nFeh!\n\n“The winds of change are always blowing (blowing)\n\nAnd ev’ry time I tried to stay (try to stay)\n\nThe winds of change continued blowing\n\nAnd they just carried me a way (carried me away)”"
