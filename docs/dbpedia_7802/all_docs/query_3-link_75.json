        "text": "Written by Sharon Mashihi\n\nDirected by Katie Brook\n\nAn artist has spent her entire career telling and retelling audiences stories about herself. All the while, in her personal life, she has lost relationship after relationship. On this night, in this theater, the artist shows up in front of her audience with a new fear: What if the next relationship to go is the one she has with them, her audience? Can she save this relationship before it's too late? Can her audience help her? What ensues is a performance about love, work, codependency, how to live a life without regret, what to do with all the regrets you've already amassed, and the central question of how much control we actually have over our own life story.\n\nThis show was previously named Ritual for the End of Owing. The show will be presented in excerpt form. In between scenes, the artists will talk about their creative process and how the show is developing from draft to draft.\n\nThis performance contains mature content and is most suitable for audiences 16+.\n\nGenerously supported by the Howard Gilman 1944 Directorship at the Hopkins Center for the Arts Fund"
