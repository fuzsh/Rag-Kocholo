        "text": "Since 2001, Dirty Heads have mixed hip-hop, reggae, and rock to create a unique sound that both fully embodies their Southern California roots and resonates with audiences around the globe.\n\nDirty Heads are currently out streaming some of the biggest alternative acts in the U.S., with over 1.31 MILLION digital track sales and 2.7 BILLION on-demand streams since 2018. Dirty Heads also have over 2.4 million unique monthly listeners on Spotify.\n\nThe band’s global appeal reached new heights in 2021, when their hit “Vacation” (originally released in 2017) garnered over six billion views and streams across social media via the ubiquitous #VacationTransition challenge that originated organically with users on TikTok.\n\nThe group formed when punk rocker Dustin Bushnell (aka Duddy B) asked his friend, rapper Jared Watson (aka Dirty J), to collaborate on a project that would focus on positive vibes and infectious grooves. Watson added singing to his vocal skills, and later with percussionist Jon Olazabal, drummer Matt Ochoa, and bassist Dave Foral, Dirty Heads began building an immense audience.\n\nIn 2008, Dirty Heads released their acclaimed album Any Port in a Storm, with a deluxe edition following in 2010. The deluxe version featured the track \"Lay Me Down\" with special guest Rome Ramirez of Sublime with Rome. The song reached number one on Billboard's Alternative Songs in May 2010, and nine weeks later it established a record as the song with the longest stint atop the chart for an independently released title.\n\nThey followed up two years later with Cabin by the Sea and later recorded an acoustic version of the title track. This, in turn, led to an entire acoustic album in 2013 called Home: Phantoms of Summer. Dirty Heads' next album, Sound of Change, would prove to be a breakthrough for the now-veteran band, debuting at number eight on the Billboard Top 200 while topping the Independent and Alternative Albums charts upon its May 2014 release.\n\nBuilding on their renewed success, Dirty Heads enlisted a bevy of industry hitmakers to work on their self-titled 2016 follow-up, which -- thanks to its mainstream appeal -- again charted high on the Billboard Top 200. The following year saw the band drop its sixth studio album, Swim Team, featuring the singles \"Vacation,\" in its original form, and \"Staloney.\"\n\nInspired by current events and the fan interpretations of their music in the #VacationTransition challenge, the band went into the studio to work on new music. In 2021 Dirty Heads released The Best Of Dirty Heads compilation, which included a new collaboration with Travis Barker and Aimee Interrupter of The Interrupters. The band also released their highly anticipated 8th studio album Midnight Control in August 2022 which featured 10 all-new songs including their take on Joe Walsh’s 1978 hit “Life’s Been Good.”\n\nIn 2023 Dirty Heads released the digital deluxe version of their album Midnight Control, featuring 23 tracks including acoustic versions of hit songs “Rescue Me,” “Life’s Been Good,” and “Island Glow,” Lo-Fi versions of 3 album tracks, 3 unreleased songs and more in addition to all 10 tracks from the original album. Featured artists include Monsieur Periné, Ivy Miller (Ivuss) and Alex Vince.\n\nThis summer, Dirty Heads performed their Top 5 hits “Life’s Been Good” and “Rescue Me” on the Today Show. Before the performance, Hosts Hoda & Jenna presented the band with a RIAA platinum plaque for their hit “Vacation,” acknowledging sales of more than 1 million digital downloads since its release BY BETTER NOISE MUSIC. The band’s take on Eagles founding member Joe Walsh’s classic “Life’s Been Good” has been streamed over 17 million times since its release and climbed to the Top 5 on the Mediabase Alternative chart. Dirty Heads also completed 37 dates on their Island Glow Summer Tour with Lupe Fiasco, Yelawolf, G. Love & Special Sauce, Tropidelic and Bikini Trill."
