        "text": "Guadalupe Victoria Yoli Raymond, known as La Lupe, has been given the rightful title, “Queen of Latin Soul”. La Lupe was a pioneer in latin soul music, not just for her dynamic vocals but for her unique stage presence. She was exiled from Cuba in 1963. She eventually made her way to NYC where she influenced the Afro-Caribbean music movement. She recorded 32 albums both as a soloist and in partnership with music legends such as Tito Puente and Mongo Santamaria. She had performed for such icons as Ernest Hemingway and Pablo Picasso. La Lupe had a wide vocal range and had grit in the same vane as musical greats like Janis Joplin and Tina Turner. She was special because when she took the stage and didn’t just sing and perform, she lived the music. She was known to twitch about, tear at her clothes, throw off her earrings, scarf, and shoes if the spirit led her to do so. It is captivating to watch clips of her online, we can only imagine how amazing it was to see her live.\n\nLa Lupe aka La Yiyiyi was a proud Afro-Latina who refused to be “whitewashed” as many record execs wanted to do to her. She could have easily complied and lightened her skin and her sound, but she remained steadfast to her persona. La Lupe did not receive enough accolades while she was alive, but recently her contributions to music have been discovered by many and celebrated. She spent her final years as an ordained evangelical minister in the Bronx on 140th Street. After she died the city renamed the street “La Lupe Way” in her honor.\n\nLa Lupe lives on through her music and she is a friend of color, not just simply for her dynamic sense of fashion, but more for the unabashed, unfiltered, and unbothered way she represented herself and Afro-Latinas. To be a “friend of color” is to access the power within and own it. La Lupe is an amazing example of this and she lives on and continues to inspire through her music."
