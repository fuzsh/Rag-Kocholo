        "text": "Founded by labor rights activist César Chávez, LUPE builds stronger, healthier communities where Colonia residents use the power of civic engagement for social change. From fighting deportations to providing social services and English classes, to organizing for streetlights and drainage, LUPE responds to the needs of the community and takes action that creates a chance for a better life. LUPE’s strength derives from our 7,000+ members throughout the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nCésar Chávez founded LUPE, a community union rooted in the belief that members of the low-income community have the responsibility and the obligation to organize themselves. Through their association, they begin to advocate and articulate for the issues and factors that impact their lives. Further, César Chávez believed that for people to have ownership of this endeavor, they have to invest of themselves, their efforts, and resources, to sustain it. The membership, and the responsibility that comes with it, form the base that is the power of the organization.\n\nhttp://lupenet.org/about-us/\n\nhttp://lupenet.org/2015/12/10-moments-at-lupe-that-defined-2015/"
