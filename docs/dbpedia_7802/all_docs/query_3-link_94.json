        "text": "After selling out shows earlier this summer at the Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre, then transferring several blocks uptown to Manhattan's Theatre Four, the musical La Lupe: My Life, My Destiny has now return to its home a little changed. The open-ended run — which began Dec. 19 — officially opens Jan. 15. The musical by Carmen Rivera centers around Latina music legend Guadalupe Victoria Yoli — known as La Lupe. The Cuban-born singer who once sold millions of records, performed with the likes of Tito Puente, and appeared on television shows like \"The Merv Griffin Show\"and \"The Dick Cavett Show,\" fell into obscurity in the 1980s.\n\nThe revamped production of La Lupe stars Doreen Montalvo as the music icon under the direction of Alba Oms. Filling out the cast are Ralina Cardona, Geisha Otero, Monica Read, Fred Valle and (the only returning player from the original production) Gilberto Arribas. William Rodriguez directs an orchestra including Jimmy Delgado (piano), Hector Rodriguez (bass) and Johnny Ribero (conguero).\n\nThe production features 14 of La Lupe's best known songs with musical arrangements by Oscar Hernandez. Performances are in English on Tuesdays at 8 PM. All other performances will be in Spanish.\n\nFor tickets to La Lupe call TeleCharge at (212) 239-6200 or visit the PRTT, 304 West 47th Street, (between 8th & 9th Avenues).
