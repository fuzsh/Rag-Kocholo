        "text": "Grasa, the second album by 29-year-old Argentine singer and rapper Nathy Peluso, kicks off with “Corleone,” a sumptuous, old-fashioned bolero. A snippet of John Barry’s dreamy 007 theme “From Russia With Love” morphs into the kind of feverish groove that would have made La Lupe proud. “This ambition is killing me,” sings Peluso, her booming voice in full bloom.\n\n“Corleone” is a somewhat disorienting opening track. Like most of Peluso’s music, it’s both edgy and comfortingly familiar; honest to the core, but with a thin layer of irony underneath.\n\nThe vision for the ninth annual Platino Awards is coming into focus with the announcement of the night’s musical performers.\n\nAna Guerra, Ana Mena, Ángela Aguilar, David Bisbal, Diana Hoyos, Gerónimo Rauch, Májida Issa, Mariaca Semprún and Monsieur Periné are set to take the stage at the Gran Tlacho theater at Xcaret Park in Riviera Maya on April 20.\n\nPer intel from event organizers, the ceremony will feature original compositions for the occasion like one performed by Hoyos and Rauch to a score by composer Lucas Vidal. The roster of talent is meant to spotlight the richness of Ibero-American stars and music. Guerra, Mena and Bisbal hail from Spain, Aguilar from Mexico, Hoyos, Issa and Monsieur Periné from Colombia, Rauch from Argentina, and Mariaca Semprún from Venezuela. Traditional Mexican music will have a prominent place in the ceremony thanks to Guerra, Issa and Semprún. Mena is on deck to pay tribute to Rocío Dúrcal,...\n\nFew artists can set a scene like Kali Uchis. Each of her albums has proven that she’s a master of mood boards and a queen of aesthetics: Her 2018 debut album, Isolation, was a lush world of retro R&b best enjoyed on a heart-shaped couch; 2023’s Red Moon in Venus included cosmic, shape-shifting pop songs to be drunk up during a lunar eclipse. Across each project, she’s stitched disparate sonic textures together like fabric swatches and placed her voice front and center — allowing it to gently guide her...\n\nRa ta ta, tá tá. The sound of the clave plays across Brooklyn on a windy Friday night in September. Under the Brooklyn Bridge in the Dumbo Archway, Lulada Club ​​— a 10-member, all-woman band — starts playing their instruments along to Hector Lavoe’s “Mi Gente,” which a DJ had been playing as the band set up. The crowd moves closer to the stage, singing the salsa anthem in unison: “Oigan mi gente / Los más grande de este mundo / Siempre me hacen sentir / Un orgullo profundo / Los llamé.” Everyone cheers at the end of the song,...\n\nLa Lupe was electric onstage. The Cuban singer, known for her belting power and undeniable charisma, began showing off her skills at a young age, winning local radio competitions and dazzling audiences at clubs on the island. When she moved to New York City after the Cuban Revolution, she kept winning people over with her masterful presence — even catching the eye of salsa legend Tito Puente, who was a collaborator and lifelong fan until her death in 1992.\n\nNow, the two artists will be reunited in a first-of-its-kind exhibition presented by...\n\nIn our Q&a feature series Tell Me Más, we ask some of our favorite Latine artists to answer the questions only their BFFs know about them, revealing everything from their most recent read to the songs that get them hyped. This month, we sit down with Puerto Rican alternative indie artist Melissa Ocasio.\n\nSince the pandemic, Puerto Rico's indie music scene has exploded. It's as if the island births new talent by the hour - and it can seem almost impossible to keep up. One of the artists who emerged during this renaissance is Melissa Ocasio. The Boricua artist has been making a name for herself as an alternative indie meets electro-Caribbean artist, ever since she released her first official single \"Agárrate,\" a call-to-action song about the femicides happening in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn March 6, 2020, Ocasio released \"Agárrate\" to the world. But the song was actually two years in the making.\n\nTeatro Grattacielo presents a free performance of Mozart’s Don Giovanni at the Riverside Theater at 91 Claremont Avenue, NYC on June 17, 2023 at 7:30pm. Made possible thanks to generous support by the Virginia B. Toulmin Foundation, the performance is open to schools and underprivileged & underserved communities in NYC.\n\nOne of Teatro Grattacielo’s most integral missions is to educate and introduce youth and young artists to opera and the arts through active participation, and to expand the audience for all opera through education and community outreach programs. This performance is part of Teatro Grattacielo’s educational intergenerational program called “Creative Tableux” and is part of Teatro Grattacielo’s production of Don Giovanni that will premiere on June 16.\n\n“We are most grateful to the Virginia B. Toulmin Foundation for their generous support and for the opportunity to pursue one of our core missions- to introduce new audiences to the life-transforming experience of opera and live performance,...\n\nIn 2023, only 34 percent of creative roles in animation are held by women, according to the nonprofit organization Women In Animation. Within that 34 percent is Indigenous Boricua filmmaker Alba Enid García-Rivas.\n\nRelated: Meet the Woman Behind the New \"Leguizamo Does America\" Series\n\nThanks to her father, a well-known director of photography on the island of Puerto Rico, García-Rivas became immersed in the world of film at a very young age. \"My father was one of the cameraman pioneers. He was the director of photography for many telenovelas and stuff like that. Iris Chacón and La Lupe and all these greatest artists from Puerto Rico knew him because he was the go-to cameraman and the director of photography,\" she tells Popsugar. \"Since I was 2 years old, I was involved with him. He brought me to the TV station. He taught me, 'This is how you do special effects. This is how you do a green screen.\n\nBad Bunny made history on Friday as the first Latino to headline Coachella — and he met the milestone with a nearly two-hour performance that was full of special interludes, surprise guests, and even some sound mishaps. His set took place on one of the largest stages Coachella has ever built, which allowed the Puerto Rican superstar to interact with the crowd from entirely different sides of the festival grounds. In between, he brought out artists and urbano luminaries, among them.\n\nPost Malone, who tried to play guitar but unfortunately experienced...\n\nTeatro Grattacielo announces its 2022-23 Season, featuring Mozart’s Don Giovanni on June 16 & 17, 2023 at Riverside Theater and Spontini’s La Vestale starring Indra Thomas as Giulia and Tahanee Aluwihare as La Gran Vestale on October 28, 2023 at the Gerald Lynch Theater at John Jay College. For more information and to purchase tickets, visit grattacielo.org/season.\n\n“On behalf of the Board of Directors and myself, we are excited to be bringing back to the US the historic Italian version of La Vestale, adding to yearlong celebrations of the 100th birth anniversary of Greek-American soprano Maria Callas,” said Stefanos Koroneos, General and Artistic Director, Teatro Grattacielo. “Maria was born in New York. She took her first steps around our great city. With our season, we are honoring her memory, her artistry, and her love for our great city and community. We are also happy to be presenting our production of Don Giovanni,...\n\nLa Lupe never seemed to second-guess herself onstage. The Afro-Cuban singer — who died 30 years ago this week, on Feb. 29, 1992 — was infinitely watchable, unafraid to kick and howl and twitch, as if the music were sending electric jolts throughout her body. In Cuba, where she headlined nightclubs in the early 1960s, she enthralled novelists like Ernest Hemingway and Guillermo Cabrera, both of whom wrote about the rhapsodic fury that seemed to overtake her when she sang. Her first husband Eulogio Reyes once said that the first time he saw her perform,...\n\nExclusive: Concord’s Film & TV unit has teamed with Pose and Vikings executive producer Sherry Marsh of Marsh Entertainment as well as Jane the Virgin executive producer Jorge Granier of Aquarius Pictures and Sergio Pizzolante (Nicky Jam: El Ganador) to develop a scripted film and/or television project about the history of Fania Records, the label that popularized salsa music. Concord’s Sophia Dilley and Fania’s Bruce McIntosh will co-developing the project and serving as executive producers.\n\nFounded by Johnny Pacheco and Jerry Masucci, New York-based Fania Records is considered by many to be “the Motown of Latin Music.” It flourished from the late 1960s to the mid-’80s, becoming highly influential both musically and culturally. The label spread the sound of salsa music from the clubs of New York City to the rest of the world and became a revered global brand in the process.\n\nFania created..."
