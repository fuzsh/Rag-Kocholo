An eclectic musician and a gifted arranger, this Spanish Harlem idol experienced all the possible nuances of Latin music, from salsa to boogaloo, to mambo to rhumba, to acid jazz and Afro-Cuban rhythms. During his long career he was a steady reference point for musicians of the calibre of Willie Bobo, Johnny Pacheco, Mongo Santamaria and conga wizard Ray Barretto - all of them joining his orchestra at various times. On this 1967 album, recorded with famed singer La Lupe, \"El Rey y La Reina\" join together for a terrific dance hall performance.\n\nSelections:\n\n1.Cumba, Cumba\n\n2. Ruega Por Nosotros\n\n3. La Salve Plena\n\n4. Yesterday\n\n5. Oriente\n\n6. Jala-Jala Panameno\n\n7. Y Que\n\n8. Esas Lagrimas Son Pocas\n\n9. Mi Gente\n\n10. El Amo\n\n11. Steak-O-Lean\n\n12. Rezo-A-Yemaya"
