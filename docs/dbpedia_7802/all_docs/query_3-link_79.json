        "text": "Este especial del NY1 Noticias le da un vistazo a lo que es el fenómeno musical: La Salsa. Nacida en Nueva York, como yo, fue parte del fruto que nació desde la Colonia Boricua y Nuyorquino aquí ya más de 100 años. Aquí puse unos pedacitos. Abajo puse el link para que vean la hora entera con mis viejos amigos como @eddiepalmieri, @ruben.blades, Mike Amadeo, @gilbertosr_oficial Gilbertito, Pepe Flores y los mas importantes: La Gente, mi gente, los más grandes desde mundo. Felicitaciones a @philipklint y su sabroso equipo de @ny1noticias. ¡Sigan guarachando! To the rip roaring syncopated news crew at Ny1Noticias: ¡GRACIAS! This special on NY’s salsa music phenomenon not only includes old school friends such as Eddie Palmieri, Ruben Blades, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Jose Clausell, Pepe Flores and so many more but it goes directly to the heart of what Salsa music is by going straight to the people, mi gente! I put a few clips from my segment below and added the link for viewing the entire one hour segment! Bravo! https://lnkd.in/epmNbR6z\n\n¡Yo soy Boricua—just so ya’ know! “The biggest one”, I answer whenever someone asks, “¿de qué pueblo eres?” Strolling through the centuries-old Andalusian streets of Puerto Rico, my smile gently suggests “no”, savoring the humid coco and mango-scented air. They guess “Ponce”. I shake my head. “New York”, I counter. “Soy Manhateriana”. I was asked to write about the recent trip to Borinquen and the addition of Ma’s last name. In Spanish & English. Enjoy. https://lnkd.in/e49BzePw #borinquen #puertorico #tourism #patriarchy #family #arts\n\nChequéalo: In a recent interview over WNYC on the status of Boricuas & the P.R. day Parade, I recalled a time when former “poverty pimp” and parade prez Ramon Velez requested $5k from an artist to play on a float! The corporatizing of the Parade and why Boricuas are leaving NY. #prdayparade #nuyorican #puertorican #newyork https://t.ly/z0i6u\n\nCelebrating Tito Puente’s 101st birthday with this mambo he arranged for Rafael Cortijo. Puente was in Borinquen and collaborated with Rafa who didn’t have a band at the time when Ismael Rivera was returning to his Island home. Puente offered his band and arranging skills to Cortijo sitting with him at the piano transcribing as the Plena / Bomba master dictated the sound he wanted. They were boys that way! For this fast placed “mambo,” Cortijo wanted a dynamic presence for Maelo and this little number was a folkloric tune given to him by Celia Cruz with Guliver as metaphor for the U.S. giant. Enjoy! #titopuente #mambo #boricua #afrocaribbean #afrocuban #Nuyorican #masters #latinmusic #drummer #timbales https://lnkd.in/e7amDucV\n\nThey’re back! Fania is putting out a box set of 45s and I’m so excited and honored to have been commissioned to write the bilingual liner notes. “A Fania singles box set, Fania 45s: the Latin Sound of New York, is planned for the fall, with songs by Johnny Pacheco, Celia Cruz, Joe Bataan, Willie Colón, Héctor Lavoe, Ray Barretto, Ismael Rivera, Pete Rodriguez and Eddie Palmieri. The box will include archival images, ephemera and in-depth liner notes in English and Spanish by New York–based music historian, author and producer Aurora Flores.” https://lnkd.in/eMbSm-zf #fania #Latinmusic #culture #arts #musichistory #newyork #nuyorican #boogaloo #salsa\n\nI’ve had Andy Gonzalez on my mind and just found this photo w/him and Manny Oquendo from a mid-nineties Battery Park Authority Bobby Capo Lifetime Achievement tribute. What good memories. Manny would always sing the Aurora song every time we met. Loved the way he tinkled that cowbell like only Manny did! Deep conversations w/ Andy on bass playing, Fred Zimmerman & Music & Art high school. Good times. Remarkable how much Andy looks like CBS reporter @davidbegnaud . Check out my “Conversations with the Masters” interview with Manny Oquendo over YouTube: https://lnkd.in/gp3jug8S . . . . #conjuntolibre #andygonzalez #afrocaribbean #afroboricua #nuyorican #latinmusic #bobbycapo #eddiepalmieri #newyorksalsa #newyork #arts #culture"
