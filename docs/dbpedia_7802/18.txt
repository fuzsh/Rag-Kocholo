The Queen

The Queen of Latin Soul, La Lupe, died on this day 20 years ago, although the intercalary anniversary is only swinging around for the fifth time.

¡La Lupe!

With her on-stage histrionics and off-stage drama, La Lupe was a suffering, Garland-esque prima donna, name-checked in Susan Sontag’s Notes on Camp. While touring with Tito Puente, La Lupe proved so erratic that she was replaced with two drag queens.
