The lied duo can be heard on the stages of major international recital centres, for instance in the concert halls of New York, the Concertgebouw Amsterdam, the Cologne and Berlin Philharmonie and the Cité de la musique in Paris.

Opera productions which had been planned for a long time, such as Wozzeck in Aix-en-Provence (July 2020 with Sir Simon Rattle/Simon McBurney) as well as concerts and lied recital tours could not take place, other engagements arise at short notice, often only as streamed concerts, for instance the Monday concerts of the Bavarian State Opera, or for audiences with a limited number of persons, such as the MDR Music Summer or the Festival d’Aix. A performance of Othmar Schoeck’s Elegie with the Basel Chamber Orchestra conducted by Heinz Holliger is intended to re-open the Basel Casino in August 2020.\n\nSong recitals in Elmau, in the Wigmore Hall in London and at the Bavarian State Opera, with lieder by Franz Schubert and Alban Berg on the programme, mark the start of the season in September.

Under Riccardo Muti he sang Papageno in a production of »The Magic Flute« in 2006 at the Salzburg Festival (issued by Decca as a DVD. Other roles include Eisenstein (»Die Fledermaus«), Posa in Don Carlo, Olivier (»Capriccio«) as well as the title roles in Monteverdi’s L’Orfeo, in »Don Giovanni«, in Debussy’s »Pelléas et Mélisande« (CD with LSO Live, Simon Rattle), and in Henze’s »Prinz von Homburg«. Wolfram in Richard Wagner’s »Tannhäuser« was and remains a constant role in his calendar in the opera houses in Berlin, Vienna, London and Munich where he last sang the role in June 2017 in the new production by Romeo Castelluci. A milestone in Christian Gerhaher’s opera career was his debut in the title role of Alban Berg’s »Wozzeck« in September 2015 at Zurich Opera House in the exceptional staging by Andreas Homoki (available as a DVD on the Accentus label; Gramophone Award in 2017).\n\nChristian Gerhaher’s CDs are issued by Sony Music, with which he has an exclusive partnership. Accompanied by Gerold Huber, the Schubert, Schumann and Mahler cycles have been released on this label.
