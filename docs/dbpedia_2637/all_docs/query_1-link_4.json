        "text": "The recognition for the first post-pandemic concert with an audience, directed by Stefano Montanari in June 2020\n\nMilan, 17 April 2021 - It was awarded to the \"Pomeriggi Musicali\", for the performance at the Teatro Dal Verme of \"The Four Seasons of Vivaldi\" which took place at the stroke of midnight on 15 June 2020, one of the four special prizes of the 40th edition of the \"Franco Abbiati\" Prize of Italian music criticism\". The announcement was made today on Rai Radio 3 during the \"Momus\" broadcast.\n\nOn 14 June last year, the Dal Verme Theater reopened its doors to the public after the spring lockdown with the \"I Pomeriggi Musicali di Milano\" series, thus giving the first post-pandemic concert which took on a high symbolic value. On the program there was one of the most famous pieces of the Western repertoire, also linked to the sense of rebirth and natural progression of life, \"The Four Seasons of Antonio Vivaldi\" entrusted to Stefano Montanari in the double role of director and violin soloist, among the most known for the baroque repertoire and guest of theaters all over the world.\n\n\"We welcome the news of the Abbiati Prize with joy and gratitude\", states the general and artistic director of Pomeriggi Musicali, Maurizio Salerno, who adds: \"The occasion of the reopening last June was touching for everyone, for us and for the public A very strong emotion to listen to live music again, after a difficult moment, as it will be in a few weeks, when we can reopen the doors again hoping to never close them again. With the Vivaldi Seasons we wanted to reiterate, without pharaonic initiatives. the centrality of music in everyone's life and the ethical and civil value of our institutional vocation. Since that concert, repeated ten more times in Milan and in the most symbolic places of the pandemic, we have never stopped, offering live concerts until. it was possible and then online, fully confirming the announced season and safeguarding the commitments made with soloists and conductors, to Stefano Montanari, to the entire I Pomeriggi Musicali Foundation and to all those who collaborated on the now \"legendary\" one. night of music goes my most sincere thanks; warmest congratulations to the other winners.\"\n\nThis is the motivation for the award: \"The challenge of not disappointing the expectations of fans of symphonic-instrumental music, the duty to affirm the desire not to give up, the pride of being witnesses through music of the presence of the institutions in the places- symbol of the pandemic tragedy, were embodied in Vivaldi's \"Seasons\" that the strings of the Pomeriggi Musicali played at the Teatro dal Verme in Milan on 15 June 2020. Without wasting a minute, at the stroke of midnight on the day in which theaters were granted to reopen, the performance entrusted to the soloist and concert talent of Stefano Montanari took over the natural and spiritual place of live music, returning it to the contingent but real public, reconquering spectators and non-virtual spaces repetitions of the program, in dedicated events aimed at specific audiences (without however excluding the remote streaming audience) and with a corollary of even civilly symbolic reruns in the most affected Lombard cities. Not held back or in awe of the objective operational difficulties imposed by the decrees in a state of emergency. Optimistic and obstinate testimony of the desire to continue to hold concerts - and, as far as possible, live - by having musicians play, to interpret without compromise the role of public cultural service in favor of the community that other equally publicly supported musical entities have practiced with less timing, continuity and tenacity\".\n\nThe jury, composed of Danilo Boaretto, Alessandro Cammarano, Sandro Cappelletto, Paola De Simone, Andrea Estero, Carlo Fiore, Angelo Foletto, Susanna Franchi, Gregorio Moppi, Giancarlo Landini, Gianluigi Mattietti, Carla Moreni, Alessandro Mormile, Paolo Petazzi, chose not to award the now usual individual evaluations, except for some recognitions which in themselves require it, but has decided to tell and summarize the entire Italian musical world with four \"Special Awards\" motivated in breadth and critical substance. Signaling the value, originality and resourcefulness of collective and project initiatives, or of individuality, which have combined pride and innovation, artistic dignity and social sensitivity, adaptability and reorganization of spaces and operating methods."
