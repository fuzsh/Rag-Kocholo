        "text": "Born in 1975 in Venice, where he studied composition and piano performance. On completing his studies, he attended a one-year course in composition and computer music at IRCAM (1998- 99). He obtained scholarships from the Civitella Ranieri Foundation (2006), the French Academy in Rome (2007-8), as well as Akademie Schloss Solitude (2009-10). He taught composition at McGill University in Montreal (2004-5), Conservatorio Ghedini in Cuneo (2004-10), Escola Superior de Música de Catalunya in Barcelona (2013-14), High School of Music in Detmold (2014-15), and University of the Arts in Berlin (2015-17). As a composer he did research at IRCAM, where in 2010-13 he was also a consultant at courses for composers.\n\nHis highly ironic compositions reflect his intense the effort to achieve the fullest possible fusion of classical instruments and less conventional sources of sound: sound synthesis, toy instruments, various sources of noise as well as found objects and devices constructed by the artist himself, such as the rain machine used in Le nubi non scoppiano per il peso (2011) or the \"augmented\" household goods, appliances and devices that appear in the cycle Systema naturae (2013-17, in collaboration with Andrea Valle). Apart from purely musical activity, Mauro Lanza has a natural predilection for interdisciplinary work. In 2004, he was commissioned by Opéra National de Paris and IRCAM to compose music for the ballet Le songe de Médée choreographed by Angelin Preljocaj. In collaboration with video artist Paolo Pachini he also wrote music for Descrizione del Diluvio (2008), a video-opera for twelve musicians, electronics and video projection. In 2009 he created the vast electronic score for Benjamin Christensen's silent movie Häxan of 1922 (commissioned by the Louvre). In 2011 Mauro Lanza and Jean-Michel Othoniel prepared an audiovisual installation for Centre Pompidou.\n\nMauro Lanza delights in the clarity and inhuman character of formalised processes and frequently applies computer algorithms in his music. His works have been published since 2004 by Ricordi in Milan. In 2014 he received the Premio Franco Abbiati for the best composition, granted by the Italian National Association of Music Critics (Critica Musicale Italiana)."
