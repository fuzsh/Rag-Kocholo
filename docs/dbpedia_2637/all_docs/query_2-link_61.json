        "text": "News\n\nMaestro Daniele Gatti is the new Music…\n\nThe Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna has the pleasure to announce that Maestro Daniele Gatti has been designated as the new Music Director of the Orchestra Mozart. The Maestro will be the music director in a vast project that will see him engaged with the Orchestra Mozart from now and for the following three years. The first date is due on Easter 2020.\n\nThe President of the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna, Loris Azzaroni, the Orchestra Mozart Artistic Consultant, Gastón Fournier-Facio, and the Orchestra Mozart Board, composed by the musicians Raphael Christ, Manuel Kastl, Lucas Macías Navarro, Mattia Petrilli and Francesco Senese, haveunanimously seen in Maestro Daniele Gatti the ideal figure to assure a great and stable future to the activities of the Orchestra Mozart, guaranteeing at the same time the utmost quality level reached by the orchestra during the ten-year collaboration with Maestro Claudio Abbado and the most enriching relationship developed during these last years with Maestro Bernard Haitink.\n\n“We believe the collaboration with Maestro Gatti represents a fundamental and decisive opportunity for our future – explains Mattia Petrilli – in order to play more frequently, aiming at intensifying the annul activities with projects, residences and tournées. The Board is very happy and convinced of this choice, which is both important and rich in perspectives, a choice strengthened by the fact that Maestro Gatti was in the list of names Claudio himself indicated as his possible successors.”\n\nFor President Azzaroni, who on behalf of the Accademia Filarmonica thanks Maestro Daniele Gatti for accepting the position, “the collaboration with an artist of such distinction will bring a crucial contribution to the future of the Orchestra Mozart. On one hand, the Music Director will constitute a stable point of reference and will assure working continuity, two factors that both guarantee the orchestra a high artistic quality and a precise musical identity; on the other hand, the very presence of a conductor such as Maestro Gatti and the certainty of a three-year collaboration with him offer a perspective open towards international concerts halls and a programmatic strategy, both fundamental elements for an orchestra with an important history such as the Orchestra Mozart.”\n\n“I have worked for a long time side by side with Maestro Daniele Gatti, both at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia and at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan – states the Artistic Consultant Gastón Fournier-Facio. Moreover, I had the opportunity to closely follow many of his rehearsals, from the Orchestre National de France to the Bayreuth Festival, from Covent Garden to the Wiener Philharmoniker. Maestro Gatti is one of the few Italian conductors who have worked as Music Directors in world-renowned countries, leading musical institutions of indisputable international level. I have always been struck by the variety of his repertoire, by his deep cultural and musical knowledge of the music scores, by the efficacy of his conducting technique through which he manages to convey the originality of his interpretations, by the absolute lack of artistic compromises and the tireless pursue of the maximum level of quality.”\n\n“It is both a pleasure and an honour for me to be called by the Accademia Filarmonica and the musicians of the Orchestra Mozart to conduct them on a continuous basis – says Daniele Gatti. As it is renowned, this orchestra creates a privileged, I would say unique, relationship with its conductor. It is a great stimulus to know that a group of musicians of such level, coming from all Europe, has as common denominator the desire to commit to this special project with me. I’m happy to be part of it.”\n\nDANIELE GATTI\n\nDaniele Gatti graduated as a composer and orchestra conductor at the Conservatorio Giuseppe Verdi in Milan. He is Music Director of Teatro dell'Opera di Roma and Artistic Advisor of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra (MCO).\n\nHe was Chief Conductor of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (RCO) in Amsterdam and previously he has held prestigious roles at important musical institutions like the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Orchestre national de France, the Royal Opera House of London, the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, and Zurich’s Opernhaus.\n\nThe Berliner Philharmoniker, the Wiener Philharmoniker, the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, and the Orchestra Filarmonica della Scala are just a few of the renowned symphonic institutions he works with.\n\nSome of the numerous and important new productions he has conducted include the Falstaff staged by Robert Carsen (in London, Milan, and Amsterdam); the Parsifal staged by Stefan Herheim opening the 2008 Bayreuther Festspiele (one of the very few Italian conductors to have been invited to the Wagnerian festival); the Parsifal staged by François Girard at the Metropolitan Opera in New York; four operas at the Salzburger Festspiele (Elektra, La bohème, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Il trovatore).\n\nTo celebrate Verdi’s anniversary, in 2013 he conducted La traviata at the season opening of the Teatro alla Scala, where he also opened the 2008 season with Don Carlo, and performed other titles including Lohengrin, Lulu, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Falstaff, and Wozzeck.\n\nSome of his most recent engagements include Pelléas et Mélisande at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Tristan und Isolde at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, and the 2016/2017 opening of the Teatro dell’Opera di Roma where he conducted the same Wagnerian opera.\n\nThe year 2016 saw the beginning of a three-year concert cycle named “RCO meets Europe”, that involved 28 member states of the European Union and it included the project “Side by Side”, a project allowing musicians from local youth orchestras to perform the first musical number of the program next to the members of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Maestro Gatti, thus fostering an incredibly fruitful human and musical exchange. The Italian appointment took place in Turin at the Auditorium of the Lingotto building. In June 2017 he conducted the RCO in an opera production: Salome at the Nationale Opera of Amsterdam.\n\nThe 2017/2018 Season saw him conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker at the Philharmonie Berlin, the Orchestra and Chorus of the Teatro alla Scala in Milan interpreting Mahler’s Second Symphony, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Europe, South Korea, Japan, and at the Carnegie Hall in New York, all events added to Amsterdam’s traditional season. Other engagements have included the opening of the new season of the Teatro dell’Opera di Roma with La damnation de Faust, a tour with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, and more performances with the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks in Munich, and the Philharmonia Orchestra in London. At the end of 2018 he conducted Rigoletto for the season opening of the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma.\n\nIn 2019 he will be on the podium of the Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Filarmonica della Scala, Orchestra del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Staatskapelle Dresden, Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks and Gewandhausorchester Leipzig. In 2020 he will be leading the Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale della Rai and the Orchestre national de France.\n\nDaniele Gatti was awarded the Premio “Franco Abbiati” from Italian music critics as best conductor in 2015, and in 2016 he was awarded the Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur from the French Republic for his work as Musical Director of the Orchestre national de France.\n\nUnder Sony Classical he has recorded works by Debussy and Stravinsky with the Orchestre national de France and a DVD of the Parsifal staged at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Under the label RCO Live he has recorded Berlioz’s Symphonie fantastique, Mahler’s Second Symphony and a DVD of Stravinsky's Le sacre du printemps together with Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune and La mer."
