        "text": "He studied piano in Venice and computer music at Ircam in Paris. Tinged with irony, his compositions have been, since the very beginning, the result of an ever increasing effort towards an intimate fusion of classical instruments with other less conventional sound sources (physical modelling synthesis, toy instruments, noisemakers and various specimens of objets trouvés).\n\nHe enjoys the clarity and the inhuman character of formalized processes, working extensively with computer algorithms.\n\nIn residence at the Villa Medici from 2007 to 2008, he has been on several other residences (Fresnoy; Civitella Ranieri; Akademie Schloss Solitude) and has undertaken various activities in the pedagogical domain (Ircam, McGill University, ESMUC, UdK).\n\nHis music is published by Ricordi Milano. In 2014 he was awarded by Italy’s National Association of Music Critics with the Franco Abbiati Prize."
