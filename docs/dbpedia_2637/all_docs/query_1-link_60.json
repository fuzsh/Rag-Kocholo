        "text": "Trained under the guidance of Maria Tipo, Andrea Lucchesini garnered international recognition at a very young age when he won the Dino Ciani International Competition at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan. Since then he has performed throughout the world with leading orchestras, working with conductors such as Claudio Abbado, Semyon Bychkov, Roberto Abbado, Riccardo Chailly, Dennis Russell Davies, Charles Dutoit, Daniele Gatti, Gabriele Ferro, Gianluigi Gelmetti, Daniel Harding, Vladimir Jurowski, Gianandrea Noseda and Giuseppe Sinopoli.\n\nIn 1994 he earned the recognition of European musicologists from whom he received the Accademia Chigiana International Prize (the only Italian to be honoured to date). The following year he won the Franco Abbiati Prize, which confirmed the appreciation of the Italian critics.\n\nFor BMG the pianist recorded Luciano Berio’s Concerto II (Echoing Curves), conducted by the composer himself. This marked one of the milestones of a close collaboration with Berio. In 2001, Pucchesini premiered Berio’s final work for the piano, Sonata, which he performed in France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherland and the UK. Lucchesini recorded this piece together with all of Berio’s other piano works, which formed part of a CD for AVIE Records that met with unanimous international critical acclaim. It was also nominated as one of the three contemporary music recordings for the Cannes Music Award 2008.\n\nEqually appreciated is Lucchesini’s live recording of Beethoven’s complete cycle of thirty-two sonatas on the Stradivarius label. The collective work was acclaimed as “CD of the Month” by prestigious German magazine Fono Forum in August 2004.\n\nHis most recent recording, the Schubert Impromptus, was made for AVIE Records in 2010."
