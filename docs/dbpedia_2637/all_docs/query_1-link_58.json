The film points to how misconceptions about mental disorders may have led to which burning.\n\nHäxan was made as a documentary, but contains dramatic elements known from horror films. It shows examples of superstitions and practices of witchcraft, magic and torture. Christensen compares the women who were accused of witchcraft in the Middle Ages with women who had mental disorders in the early 1900s, and draws parallels between the Inquisition and the psychiatric treatment of the \"hysterical women\".\n\nLanza and Pasquet’s soundtrack is algorithmically controlled, with music composed by a large collection of sounds. The music is sometimes concrete and sometimes in sync with the image, while other times it slides into the abstract. The basis of the composition is an algorithm that selects and processes a huge audio material of several thousand sounds. This sound material is composed of electronic sounds, samples of instruments and gothic metal, and more.\n\nThe work was originally a commission for Ircam and the Louvre Museum.\n\nHäxan was the most expensive Scandinavian silent film ever made in its time, costing almost 2 million Swedish kroner. The film became illegal in the United States and much of it was censored in other countries because of what was considered graphic depictions of torture, nudity and sexual perversion. Director Christensen himself plays the devil in the film.\n\nItalian composer Mauro Lanza (1975) studied piano in Venice and computer music at Ircam. Tingedwith irony, his compositions attempt to intimately merge classical instruments with other less conventional sound sources. He enjoys the clarity and the inhuman character of formalized processes, working extensively with computer algorithms. His music is published by Ricordi Milano. In 2014 he was awarded by Italy’s National Association of Music Critics with the Franco Abbiati Prize.\n\nOlivier Pasquet (b. 1974) is a composer, visual artist and music producer. He has been working with a variety of artists at Ircam and other places, such as Florian Hecker, Georges Aperghis and Pierre Boulez. His work is based on the writing of audio visual compositions and synesthesia. His generative pieces, both minimalistic and maximalistic, are contextualized within a rationalist theory-fiction universe. This world can be explored both by singular pieces and an overall artistic path. The formal and plastic value gives it strong links with architecture, geometry and algorithmic design."
