        "text": "We Spoke\n\nWe Spoke is a contemporary music company based in Switzerland and London. We Spoke : merges ‘we speak’ with ‘bespoke’ and explores the huge stylistic range of contemporary art music. Each production features a major artistic collaboration – with a composer, dancer, visual artist, choreographer, or other creative practictioner - and focuses on one theme , coupling original musical interpretation with virtuosic live performance.\n\nWe Spoke has performed extensively in Switzerland, the UK and South America in cities including Geneva, Lausanne, Basel, Zurich, London, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Lima. Following over twenty performances in 2012, 2013 concerts include fondation suisse in Paris, Unerhörte Musik in Berlin, KammerKlang in London, Florence international contemporary music festival and a new residency at the Lima Contemporary Music festival as well as the new production 'Song' to be toured in Switzerland and the UK.\n\nHackaurium\n\nHackuarium is an open laboratory for DIY biology (and beyond). The laboratory is located in Renens (Switzerland), and is open to anyone sharing the values of the association and who is dedicated to follow the DIYbio Europe ethical guidelines. Our projects are initiated and carried out by scientists as well as non-scientists from a variety of background. They are passionate about tinkering with biology in particular, and technology in general. Some are engineers, architects, designers, IT and computer scientists or retired professionals, but others have no scientific education. They are mostly citizens interested in open and participatory research and innovation, outside the contraints of traditional institutions. Hackuarium members want to investigate new ways of carrying out interdisciplinary research and innovation, by making their results accessible (low-cost), simple and easily reproducible (low-tech) and by promoting an open source philosophy. Hackuarium is proudly using infrastructures provided by UniverCité, an unconventional innovation hub opened in May 2014. Our equipment is mostly upcycled material from institutions and industries from western Switzerland.\n\nExplore Ensemble\n\nExplore Ensemble is a group of soloists based in London that brings the music of the 20th and 21st centuries to life.

Dérives, Périodes, and Partiels were among the first pieces of spectral music. In 1974-75, he studied acoustics with Emile Leipp at the Paris VI University, and in 1980 became a trainee at the IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique). In the same year he went to Berlin as a guest of the D.A.A.D., and afterwards left for the University of California, Berkeley, where he was appointed professor of theory and composition (1982-1986).
