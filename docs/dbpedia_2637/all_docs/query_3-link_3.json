After attending the Conservatorio Giuseppe Verdi in Milan, Stefano Gervasoni studied with&nbsp; Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti in Hungary in 1990, and then, in 1992, he attended the IRCAM&nbsp;Course in Composition and in Computer Music&nbsp;in Paris. The first three years in France launched Gervasoni&rsquo;s international career that eventually led him to be artist-in-residence at Villa Medici in Rome for the biennium1995-1996. With commissions from prestigious institutions such the WDR, the SWR, the Orchestra Nazionale della RAI, the M&uuml;nchner Kammerorchester, the Festival d&rsquo;Automne in Paris, Radio France, IRCAM, the Casa da Musica in Porto, the Festival Archipel in Geneva, the Divertimento Ensemble in Milan, the Ensemble Intercontemporain, the Ensemble Modern, the Ensemble Contrechamps in Geneva, the Maerzmusik festival in Berlin, the Ars Musica Bruxelles, the Festival Musica in Strasbourg, the French Ministry of Culture, Milan Teatro alla Scala and Suntory Hall in Tokyo, Stefano Gervasoni has established himself as one of the most important Italian composers of his generation. His catalogue &ndash; which includes chamber and vocal music, concertos, works for orchestra, for ensemble and an opera (Limbus-Limbo) &ndash; is published by Ricordi and by Suvini Zerboni. Winner of numerous prizes, including the recent &ldquo;Serge Koussevitzky Music Foundation Award&rdquo; (2018) and Premio della Critica Musicale &ldquo;Franco Abbiati&rdquo; (2010), his work has allowed him to be a grant-holder at the&nbsp;Fondation&nbsp;des Treilles&nbsp;in Paris (1994) and at the DAAD in Berlin (2006) and composer-in-residence at Villa M&eacute;dicis in Rome as fellow at the&nbsp;Acad&eacute;mie de France&nbsp;for the years 1995-96 and at the&nbsp;Domaine de Kergu&eacute;hennec&nbsp;during the period 2008-2010. He has also been invited to teach at the Darmstadt Ferienkurse, on the courses organised by the Fondation Royaumont (Paris), at Toho University in Tokyo, at the Festival International de Campos do Jord&atilde;o in Brazil, at the Conservatory in Shanghai, at Columbia University (New York), at Harvard University (Boston) and at Takefu International Music Festival. He has been composer-in-residence at Lausanne Conservatoire (2005) and at Yellow Barn Summer Academy (Vermont, 2016). Moreover, he has been visiting professor at ESMUC in Barcelona for the 2012-13 academic year. Since 2006 Stefano Gervasoni has held a regular teaching post as professor of composition at the prestigious Conservatoire National Sup&eacute;rieur de Musique et de Danse in Paris. The musicologist Philippe Alb&egrave;ra wrote a substantial book on&nbsp;Stefano Gervasoni&rsquo;s work,&nbsp;Stefano Gervasoni.&nbsp;Le parti pris des sons, published in 2015 by Editions Contrechamps (Geneva). His last CD, entitled&nbsp;pas perdu&nbsp;has been released in 2018 by Winter &amp; Winter.",
