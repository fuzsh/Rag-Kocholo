        "text": "In September 2017 Pietari Inkinen became Chief Conductor of the Deutsche Radio Philharmonie Saarbruecken. Inkinen is also Chief Conductor of the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra, a post he has held since the beginning of the 16-17 season. He has also been Chief Conductor of the Prague Symphony Orchestra since 2015.\n\nIn January 2019 Inkinen led the Prague Symphony on a three-week tour across Japan and in April 2019 the Japan Philharmonic toured Finland, Germany, Austria and the UK, with stops in Helsinki and his hometown of Kouvola celebrating the centenary of the relationship between Japan and Finland. In November 2019 he will tour the UK with the Prague Symphony, performing Mahler’s Third Symphony in some of the country’s most significant venues.\n\nThe music of Wagner has been a distinct focus of Inkinen’s career and in the summer of 2020 he will conduct a new production of the Ring Cycle in Bayreuth, directed by Valentin Schwarz. In autumn 2018 Inkinen returned to Melbourne to conduct Die Meistersinger, following his acclaimed performances in 2013 and 2016 of Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen, directed by Neil Armfield. This is the production which in August 2014 inspired Australia’s Helpmann Awards, recognising artistic excellence throughout Australia’s vibrant performing arts scene, to vote Inkinen as the award winner for Best Music Direction for Opera Australia’s Ring Cycle. The 2016 revival garnered Inkinen a further Green Room award for Best Conductor (Opera). Inkinen previously conducted Wagner’s Die Walküre and Das Rheingold in Palermo’s Teatro Massimo directed by Graham Vick for which he was awarded Italy’s National Association of Music Critics’ Franco Abbiati Prize for “Best Show” for Das Rheingold. He has frequently conducted Wagner’s operatic works in concert as well, and will conduct his first Tristan und Isolde in 2020 for Opera Queensland. The title role will be taken by Simon O’Neill, a long-time collaborator of Inkinen, with whom he recorded a highly acclaimed Wagner disc for EMI with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra in 2010."
