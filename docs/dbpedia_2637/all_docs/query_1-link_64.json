        "text": "A Parma-born pianist and writer, in 2017 Cristina Bersarelli was awarded the Franco Abbiati prize by the Italian Association of Music Critics and the International Illica Prize for her work in introducing opera to children. In Milan, together with the Curci Publishing House, she published the successful Su il Sipario series. She is the artistic director of the legendary Circolo Parma lirica and founded the \"E Lucevan le Stelle\" award for young musicians. Today, she divides her time between Parma and Milan, where she teaches piano at the British School of Milan. Born in Fucecchio, Giulia Quagli works in Studio Fuffa with three other illustrators. She attended science college to then enroll first at the Accademia di Belle Arti and then at the Scuola Internazionale di Comics in Florence. In 2014, she turned digital and has collaborated with Giunti, Piemme edizioni, Mondadori, Zanichelli, Pearson, and Gribaudo to mention just a few. She is a member of Fuffa, an illustration studio based in Tuscany that was created by a team of four friends passionate about illustration and books. Together they make picture, activity, and interactive books, as well as puzzles and toys. Between them, they have years of experience in the editorial field, and they share the same goal: to create something beautiful."
