The Quartet was founded in 2002, after a brilliant course of studies at the Scuola di Musica di Fiesole and the String Quartet Academy. During these years, they have engaged with the traditional repertoire for string quartet under the guidance of the best teachers of chamber music on the international scene (Hatto Beyerle, Christophe Giovaninetti, Piero Farulli, Andras Keller and Andrea Nannoni among others). The Maurice Quartet has then continued to delve in today’s music, together with the most important musicians active in the contemporary sector: Helmut Lachenmann, Philippe Manoury, Irvine Arditti, Lucas Fels, Graeme Jennings, Francesco Dillon, Gyorgy Kurtag and Marta, Roham de Saram, Franck Chevalier. Maurice Quartet has developed a deeper understanding of the twentieth century’s musical language through the study of XX century and contemporary repertoire, performing works by Ligeti, Xenakis, Bartok, Shostakovich, Schnittke, Lachenmann, Scelsi and Fedele among others. The Quartet believes in promoting new music through commissioning works to young composers, and therefore encouraging a fresh, rich and multifarious musical production, projected into the future. Many emerging composers on the international scene have chosen to dedicate their work to the Maurice Quartet: Marco Momi, Silvia Borzelli, Luiz Casteloes, Andrea Portera, Ryan Carter. A special project, “4 + 1”, in collaboration with the italian composer Andrea Agostini, is meant to deepen the relationship with electronic music and the exploration of the new possibilities it offers to the string quartet. At the Festival ManiFeste 2015 (IRCAM Centre Pompidou, Paris), the ensemble, with the help of the French association Pro Quartet, has performed \"Tensio\" by Philippe Manoury, one of the most avant-garde compositions in the field of new music technologies, and at the Festival ManiFeste 2017 the String Quartet n.4 with electronics by Jonathan Harvey. The Quartet has performed through Italy and abroad, in a number of prestigious venues including the Venice Biennale 2013, the season music@villaromana and the festival Playit! in Florence, November Music Festival in 's-Hertogenbosch (Holland), the Biennale Zagreb, the Festival Mixtur in Barcelona (Spain), the Bludenzer Tage zeitgemäßer Musik 2017, the festival Minifest De Musique de Demain in Strasbourg (France), the Italian Academy of Columbia University in New York (USA ), the Italian Istitut of Culture and for ProQuartet in Paris,the Festival Tzlil Meudcan in Tel Aviv (Israel), the Distat Terra festival in Argentina, the New Music Festival in Macerata (italy), the festival New Music of Treviso (Italy), the festival Encontres Compositores de Mallorca (Spain), All frontiers of Gradisca d'Isonzo (Italy) in featuring with Mika Vainio (Pan Sonic), the International Fajr Music Festival in Tehran (Iran), La Ferme de Villefavard (France). They have performed also in Vienna and Graz (Austria) for Jeunesse exhibitions and Open Music, at the Maramotti of Reggio Emilia, at the Teatro Dal Verme in Milan, at the Piccolo Regio in Turin, at Teatro Bibiena of Mantua, at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, at the Press Club of Turin and at Teatro Vittoria in Turin. The Maurice Quartet has been selected by the Association Piero Farulli for the project \"Le dimore del Quartetto\" and by \"Ulysses Network\" for the Project \"Journeys 2017\". It is supported by CIDIM, Italian National Music Committee, and by the De Sono Association for music. The Maurice Quartet as Metamorforsi Notturne Association is also artistic director of several cultural events and collaborates with the association \"Terra Galleggiante\" in the artistic direction of the festival of theater, music and dance “In Prossimità” in Pinerolo (Italy).  quartettomaurice@gmail.com",
