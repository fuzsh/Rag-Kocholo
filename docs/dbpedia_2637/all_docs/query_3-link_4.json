I had my first piece for the Ensemble Intercontemporain premiered in 2014 at this festival, and 10 years later, Joséphine asked me to be the portrait composer for her last edition in 2024.\n\nJoséphine and this festival have been a constant presence in my musical life and helped me to shape the composer and curator I am today. Being able to do for many more artists what she and the Festival d’Automne have done for me is one of the biggest joys of my life. I know these are big shoes to fill, and I will try to do my very best."
