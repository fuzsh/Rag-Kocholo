        "text": "Biography\n\nFrançois-Xavier Roth is one of today’s most imaginative conductors and programmers, whether in his\n\nroles as General Music Director of the City of Cologne and founder of Les Siècles, or with leading\n\norchestras such as the London Symphony Orchestra, of which he is Principal Guest Conductor. A born\n\ncommunicator, he is a charismatic and persuasive advocate for classical music of every description.\n\nIn Cologne, where he has directed both the Gürzenich Orchestra and the Opera since 2015, his\n\nprogramming is notable for its breadth and depth, including new commissions alongside Baroque and\n\nRomantic music. Roth upholds the orchestra’s pioneering heritage, which includes having given the\n\nworld premieres of Mahler’s Third and Fifth Symphonies, the Brahms Double Concerto, Strauss’s Don\n\nQuixote and Till Eulenspiegel, and Zimmermann’s Die Soldaten. For Cologne Opera he has led new\n\nproductions of Benvenuto Cellini, Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, Tannhäuser, Tristan und Isolde, Salome,\n\nBéatrice et Bénédict and The Flying Dutchman.\n\nHis sense of musical exploration led him in 2003 to found Les Siècles, which performs contrasting\n\nprogrammes on modern and period instruments, often within the same concert. Together, they have\n\ntoured Europe, China and Japan, appearing at the Berlin Musikfest, BBC Proms, Edinburgh and Enescu\n\nfestivals. In 2019, Les Siècles became resident orchestra of Atelier Lyrique de Tourcoing, where Roth is\n\nalso Artistic Director, and in 2022 they took up their new residency at Théâtre des Champs-Élysées.\n\nProjects have included recreating the original sound of Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring, Ravel’s Daphnis et\n\nChloé and Debussy’s Pelléas et Mélisande. Currently, Les Siècles are celebrating their 20th anniversary\n\nwith a series of European tours.\n\nRoth is a champion of new music and has premiered works by Georg-Friedrich Haas and Hèctor Parra,\n\nand collaborated with composers such as Pierre Boulez, Wolfgang Rihm, Jörg Widmann, Helmut\n\nLachenmann and Philippe Manoury. He has a leading role in the LSO’s Panufnik Composers Scheme,\n\nmentoring young emerging composers.\n\nEngagement with new audiences is an essential part of Roth’s work, whether speaking from the\n\npodium or working with young people and amateurs. With the Festival Berlioz and Les Siècles, he\n\nfounded the Jeune Orchestre Européen Hector Berlioz, which has its own collection of period\n\ninstruments and last year performed Les Troyens à Carthage in Berlioz’s birthplace. In Cologne he has\n\ninitiated a community orchestra and his Ohrenauf! youth programme was recipient of a Junge Ohren\n\nProduktion Award. His television series Presto! attracted weekly audiences of over three million in\n\nFrance.\n\nRoth’s prolific award-winning discography includes the complete tone poems of Richard Strauss,\n\nStravinsky ballets, Ravel and Berlioz cycles, Bruckner, Mahler and Schumann symphonies, and albums\n\ncommemorating Debussy’s centenary. He was awarded the German Record Critics’ Honorary Prize\n\n2020, the youngest conductor ever to receive it. For his achievements as musician, conductor, music\n\ndirector and teacher, François-Xavier Roth was made a Chevalier of the Légion d’honneur.\n\nAppointments\n\nGeneral Music Director, City of Cologne (2015–present); Principal Guest Conductor of London\n\nSymphony Orchestra (2017–present); Founder and Artistic Director of Les Siècles; Artistic Director of\n\nAtelier Lyrique de Tourcoing (2019–present); Chief Conductor and Artistic Director, SWR\n\nSinfonieorchester (from 2025)\n\nGuest conducting appearances (2023–24)\n\nBerlin Philharmonic, Sinfonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, Orchestre National de France, SWR\n\nSinfonieorchester, Boulez ensemble\n\nOpera productions (2023–24)\n\nMozart: Die zauberflöte, Humperdinck: Hänsel und Gretel, Gounod: Faust, Ondrej Adamek: Ines (world\n\npremiere)\n\nAwards\n\nChevalier of the Légion d’honneur (2017); German Record Critics’ Honorary Prize (2020).\n\nWith Les Siècles: Franco Abbiati Record Critics’ Award – IV edition 2022, Edison Klassiek Prize 2022;\n\nPresto Music Recording of the Year 2020; German Record Critics’ Prize 2016, Gramophone Awards\n\nOrchestral Album of the Year 2018; Victoires de la Musique Classique Recording of the Year 2018\n\nRecent recording releases\n\nRavel: Bolero and L’heure espagnole with Les Siècles (Harmonia Mundi)\n\nLigeti: Kammerkonzert with Les Siècles (Harmonia Mundi)\n\nMahler: Symphony no.4 with Les Siècles (Harmonia Mundi)\n\nRavel: Piano Concertos and Melodies with Les Siècles (Harmonia Mundi)\n\nDebussy: Pelléas et Mélisande with Les Siècles (Harmonia Mundi)\n\nBruckner: Symphony no.7 with Gürzenich Orchestra (Myrios Classics)\n\nSaint-Saëns: Symphony no.3 and Piano Concerto no. 4 with Les Siècles (Harmonia Mundi)\n\nStrauss: Don Quixote and Til Eulenspiegel with Gürzenich Orchestra (Harmonia Mundi)\n\nSchumann: Symphonies nos.1 and 4 with Gürzenich Orchestra (Myrios Classics)\n\nBeethoven: Symphony no.3 and Méhul: Overture, Les Amazones (Harmonia Mundi)"
