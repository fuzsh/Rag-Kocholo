        "text": "Guest of honor: Helmut Lachenmann\n\nComposition faculty: Amy Beth Kirsten, Dmitri Tymoczko, Nick DiBerardino\n\nPerformers: mdi ensemble; Musicologist in residence: Giovanni Cestino\n\nhighSCORE Advisory Board: Amy Beth Kirsten, David Serkin Ludwig, Dmitri Tymoczko\n\nExecutive producer: Paolo Fosso; Artistic director: Giovanni Albini\n\nAssistant artistic director: Alberto Barberis; Production assistant: Fabrizio Nastari\n\nHelmut Lachenmann\n\nA legend of contemporary music, Helmut Lachenmann was born 1935 and raised in Stuttgart, where he studied piano with Jürgen Uhde, as well as theory and composition with Johann Nepomuk David, from 1955 to 1958. He continued his studies in Venice with Luigi Nono, in whose home he stayed and who would have a decisive influence on his work. Lachenmann returned to Germany in 1961, and from 1963 to 1965, he took Karlheinz Stockhausen‘s new music course in Cologne. After a stint at the electronic music studio of the University of Ghent, he was awarded the Kulturpreis für Musik from the city of Munich in 1965. He taught at the Musikhochschule of Stuttgart (1966-1970) and then of Ludwigsburg (1970-1976) before being appointed professor of composition in Hanover (1976-1981) and then again in Stuttgart (1981-1999). In 2010, he was a guest professor at the Musikhochschule in Basel.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, Lachenmann had developed the notion of instrumental musique concrète, in reference to the ‘bruitist’ sounds produced by instruments, and elaborated taxonomies based on the mode of production associated with a particular gesture and based too on the resulting sound. He inventively broadened the palette of the performers, differentiated the modes of play, the manipulations, and concerned himself with the whole structure of the instrument. Inviting the listener to active perception, Lachenmann also integrates into his compositions traditional musical objects, notably dance rhythms and evocations of traditional songs or works from the classical repertory. His music is characterised by both æsthetic purification and a rejection of all forms of pre-codified ordering.\n\nLachenmann has taught composition workshops and seminars around the world, including in Darmstadt (several times since 1972), Basel (1972-1973), Brazil (1978 et 1982), Toronto (1982), Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile and Tokyo (1984), Blonay, (1988), Akyoshida (Japan, 1993), Viitasaari (Finland, 1998), Acanthes (France, 1999), New York (Juilliard School, 2001), and the Fromm Foundation (Harvard, 2008).\n\nHe holds honorary doctorates from the Universities of Hanover, Dresden, and Cologne, and is a member of the Arts Academies of Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig, Mannheim, Munich, and Brussels.\n\nAmy Beth Kirsten\n\nAmy Beth Kirsten, “…one of America’s most innovative and visionary composers,” (BBC Music Magazine, March 2019) is known primarily for her for multi-year, multimedia theatrical collaborations. She has cast herself in roles as varied as composer, poet, filmmaker, vocalist, and director. Ms. Kirsten has been recognizedwith awards and fellowships from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (2020), John S. Guggenheim Foundation (2010) and the Rockefeller Foundation (2009) and has created works for her own ensemble HOWL (2012-2018), musicians of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the New World Symphony, Peak Performances, the multi-Grammy-winning eighth blackbird, among many others. An original story written by Ms. Kirsten and Timothy Leopold (trumpet) is the catalyst for her current project, Jacob in Chains, an evening-length Christmas ghost story and immersive event for Alarm Will Sound. Jacob is a present-day character inspired by Jacob Marley, from Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol.” She was recently appointed to the composition faculty at the Juilliard School where she will maintain a private studio and teach a two-semester course called “Theatre Etudes.” She also teaches at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, PA and is Director of The Artist Residency at Longy School of Music of Bard College.\n\nDmitri Tymoczko\n\nDmitri Tymoczko was born in 1969 in Northampton, Massachusetts.

His book A Geometry of Music (Oxford) has been described as “a tour de force” (The Times Literary Supplement), a “monumental achievement” (Music Theory Online), and, potentially, a modern analogue to Schoenberg’s Harmonielehre (The Musical Times). His first three CDs, Beat Therapy (“far reaching yet utterly entertaining,” Newmusicbox), Crackpot Hymnal (“ebullient … polystylistic … kinetic … vividly orchestrated and vibrantly paced,” Sequenza21), and Rube Goldberg Variations (“foot tapping,” “sassy,” the product of “an intriguing musical voice that should interest anyone in search of a new auditory experience,” Limelight), are available from Bridge Records.
