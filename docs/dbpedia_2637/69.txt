The committee of the 42nd edition of the “Franco Abbiati” Music Critics’ award has selected “La Favorite”, which inaugurated the 2022 Donizetti Opera festival, as “Best show of the year”. I’m delighted by this accolade, which is a reward for the work done by all those who make this festival possible and for the decisions made with Francesco Micheli over these last few years. It is our firm commitment to present Donizetti and his operas with the skilled performance and theatrical dignity they deserve. For “La Favorite”, everyone involved gave of their best, from Valentina Carrasco and all her team to the cast led by Annalisa Stroppa and Javier Camarena, and from the technical staff to the Orchestra and Chorus and the wonderful “favorite” of all ages. We’ve been through some difficult times over the past few years but the festival has never stopped and this award, bestowed in the year of Bergamo Brescia Italian Capital of Culture 2023, makes me even feel even prouder of being a citizen of Brescia in Donizetti’s birthplace.
