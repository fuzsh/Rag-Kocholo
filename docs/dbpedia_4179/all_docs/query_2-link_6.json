He looked round him at the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred bench of chemicals, the violin-case leaning in the corner, the coal-scuttle, which contained of old the pipes and tobacco. Finally, his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of Billy, the young but very wise and tactful page, who had helped a little to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great detective.\n\n\"It all seems very unchanged, Billy. You don't change, either. I hope the same can be said of him?\"\n\nBilly glanced with some solicitude at the closed door of the bedroom.\n\n\"I think he's in bed and asleep,\" he said.\n\nIt was seven in the evening of a lovely summer's day, but Dr. Watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend's hours to feel no surprise at the idea.\n\n\"That means a case, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, he is very hard at it just now. I'm frightened for his health. He gets paler and thinner, and he eats nothing. 'When will you be pleased to dine, Mr. Holmes?' Mrs. Hudson asked. 'Seven-thirty, the day after to-morrow,' said he. You know his way when he is keen on a case.\"\n\n\"Yes, Billy, I know.\"\n\n\"He's following someone. Yesterday he was out as a workman looking for a job. To-day he was an old woman. Fairly took me in, he did, and I ought to know his ways by now.\" Billy pointed with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned against the sofa. \"That's part of the old woman's outfit,\" he said.\n\n\"But what is it all about, Billy?\"\n\nBilly sank his voice, as one who discusses great secrets of State. \"I don't mind telling you, sir, but it should go no farther. It's this case of the Crown diamond.\"\n\n\"What—the hundred-thousand-pound burglary?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. They must get it back, sir. Why, we had the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary both sitting on that very sofa. Mr. Holmes was very nice to them. He soon put them at their ease and promised he would do all he could. Then there is Lord Cantlemere—\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, you know what that means. He's a stiff'un, sir, if I may say so. I can get along with the Prime Minister, and I've nothing against the Home Secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort of man, but I can't stand his Lordship. Neither can Mr. Holmes, sir. You see, he don't believe in Mr. Holmes and he was against employing him. He'd rather he failed.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Holmes knows it?\"\n\n\"Mr. Holmes always knows whatever there is to know.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll hope he won't fail and that Lord Cantlemere will be confounded. But I say, Billy, what is that curtain for across the window?\"\n\n\"Mr. Holmes had it put up there three days ago. We've got something funny behind it.\"\n\nBilly advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of the bow window.\n\nDr. Watson could not restrain a cry of amazement. There was a facsimile of his old friend, dressing-gown and all, the face turned three-quarters towards the window and downward, as though reading an invisible book, while the body was sunk deep in an armchair. Billy detached the head and held it in the air.\n\n\"We put it at different angles, so that it may seem more lifelike. I wouldn't dare touch it if the blind were not down. But when it's up you can see this from across the way.\"\n\n\"We used something of the sort once before.\"\n\n\"Before my time,\" said Billy. He drew the window curtains apart and looked out into the street. \"There are folk who watch us from over yonder. I can see a fellow now at the window. Have a look for yourself.\"\n\nWatson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened, and the long, thin form of Holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his step and bearing as active as ever. With a single spring he was at the window, and had drawn the blind once more.\n\n\"That will do, Billy,\" said he. \"You were in danger of your life then, my boy, and I can't do without you just yet. Well, Watson, it is good to see you in your old quarters once again. You come at a critical moment.\"\n\n\"So I gather.\"\n\n\"You can go, Billy. That boy is a problem, Watson. How far am I justified in allowing him to be in danger?\"\n\n\"Danger of what, Holmes?\"\n\n\"Of sudden death. I'm expecting something this evening.\"\n\n\"Expecting what?\"\n\n\"To be murdered, Watson.\"\n\n\"No, no, you are joking, Holmes!\"\n\n\"Even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that. But we may be comfortable in the meantime, may we not? Is alcohol permitted? The gasogene and cigars are in the old place. Let me see you once more in the customary armchair. You have not, I hope, learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco? It has to take the place of food these days.\"\n\n\"But why not eat?\"\n\n\"Because the faculties become refined when you starve them. Why, surely, as a doctor, my dear Watson, you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain. I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is a mere appendix. Therefore, it is the brain I must consider.\"\n\n\"But this danger, Holmes?\"\n\n\"Ah. yes, in case it should come off, it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer. You can give it to Scotland Yard, with my love and a parting blessing. Sylvius is the name—Count Negretto Sylvius. Write it down, man, write it down! 136 Moorside Gardens, N.W. Got it?\"\n\nWatson's honest face was twitching with anxiety. He knew only too well the immense risks taken by Holmes and was well aware that what he said was more likely to be under-statement than exaggeration. Watson was always the man of action, and he rose to the occasion.\n\n\"Count me in, Holmes. I have nothing to do for a day or two.\"\n\n\"Your morals don't improve, Watson. You have added fibbing to your other vices. You bear every sign of the busy medical man, with calls on him every hour.\"\n\n\"Not such important ones. But can't you have this fellow arrested?\"\n\n\"Yes, Watson, I could. That's what worries him so.\"\n\n\"But why don't you?\"\n\n\"Because I don't know where the diamond is.\"\n\n\"Ah! Billy told me—the missing Crown jewel!\"\n\n\"Yes, the great yellow Mazarin stone. I've cast my net and I have my fish. But I have not got the stone. What is the use of taking them? We can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels. But that is not what I am out for. It's the stone I want.\"\n\n\"And is this Count Sylvius one of your fish?\"\n\n\"Yes, and he's a shark. He bites. The other is Sam Merton the boxer. Not a bad fellow, Sam, but the Count has used him. Sam's not a shark. He is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon. But he is flopping about in my net all the same.\"\n\n\"Where is this Count Sylvius?\"\n\n\"I've been at his very elbow all the morning. You've seen me as an old lady, Watson. I was never more convincing. He actually picked up my parasol for me once. 'By your leave, Madame,' said he—half-Italian, you know, and with the Southern graces of manner when in the mood, but a devil incarnate in the other mood. Life is full of whimsical happenings, Watson.\"\n\n\"It might have been tragedy.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps it might. I followed him to old Straubenzee's workshop in the Minories. Straubenzee made the air-gun—a very pretty bit of work, as I understand, and I rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment. Have you seen the dummy? Of course, Billy showed it to you. Well, it may get a bullet through its beautiful head at any moment. Ah, Billy, what is it?\"\n\nThe boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile.\n\n\"The man himself. I had hardly expected this. Grasp the nettle, Watson! A man of nerve. Possibly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter of big game. It would indeed be a triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag. This is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel.\"\n\n\"Send for the police.\"\n\n\"I probably shall. But not just yet. Would you glance carefully out of the window, Watson, and see if anyone is hanging about in the street?\"\n\nWatson looked warily round the edge of the curtain.\n\n\"Yes, there is one rough fellow near the door.\"\n\n\"That will be Sam Merton—the faithful but rather fatuous Sam. Where is this gentleman, Billy?\"\n\n\"In the waiting-room, sir.\"\n\n\"Show him up when I ring.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"If I am not in the room, show him in all the same.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nWatson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned earnestly to his companion.\n\n\"Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible. This is a desperate man, who sticks at nothing. He may have come to murder you.\"\n\n\"I should not be surprised.\"\n\n\"I insist upon staying with you.\"\n\n\"You would be horribly in the way.\"\n\n\"In his way?\"\n\n\"No, my dear fellow—in my way.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't possibly leave you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you can, Watson. And you will, for you have never failed to play the game. I am sure you will play it to the end. This man has come for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine.\"\n\nHolmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines. \"Take a cab to Scotland Yard and give this to Youghal of the C.I.D. Come back with the police. The fellow's arrest will follow.\"\n\n\"I'll do that with joy.\n\n\"Before you return I may have just time enough to find out where the stone is.\" He touched the bell. \"I think we will go out through the bedroom. This second exit is exceedingly useful. I rather want to see my shark without his seeing me, and I have, as you will remember, my own way of doing it.\"\n\nIt was, therefore, an empty room into which Billy, a minute later, ushered Count Sylvius. The famous game-shot, sportsman, and man-about-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a formidable dark moustache shading a cruel, thin-lipped mouth, and surmounted by a long, curved nose like the beak of an eagle. He was well dressed, but his brilliant necktie, shining pin, and glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect. As the door closed behind him he looked round him with fierce, startled eyes, like one who suspects a trap at every turn. Then he gave a violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the dressing-gown which projected above the armchair in the window. At first his expression was one of pure amazement. Then the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes. He took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses, and then, on tiptoe, his thick stick half raised, he approached the silent figure. He was crouching for his final spring and blow when a cool, sardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door:\n\n\"Don't break it, Count! Don't break it!\"\n\nThe assassin staggered back, amazement in his convulsed face. For an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more, as if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original; but there was something in that steady grey eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink to his side.\n\n\"It's a pretty little thing,\" said Holmes, advancing towards the image. \"Tavernier, the French modeller, made it. He is as good at waxworks as your friend Straubenzee is at air-guns.\"\n\n\"Air-guns, sir! What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Put your hat and stick on the side-table. Thank you! Pray take a seat. Would you care to put your revolver out also? Oh, very good, if you prefer to sit upon it. Your visit is really most opportune, for I wanted badly to have a few minutes' chat with you.\"\n\nThe Count scowled, with heavy, threatening eyebrows.\n\n\"I, too, wished to have some words with you, Holmes. That is why I am here. I won't deny that I intended to assault you just now.\"\n\nHolmes swung his leg on the edge of the table.\n\n\"I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head,\" said he. \"But why these personal attentions?\"\n\n\"Because you have gone out of your way to annoy me. Because you have put your creatures upon my track.\"\n\n\"My creatures! I assure you no!\"\n\n\"Nonsense! I have had them followed. Two can play at that game, Holmes.\"\n\n\"It is a small point, Count Sylvius, but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me. You can understand that, with my routine of work, I should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues' gallery, and you will agree that exceptions are invidious.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, then.\"\n\n\"Excellent! But I assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents.\"\n\nCount Sylvius laughed contemptuously.\n\n\"Other people can observe as well as you. Yesterday there was an old sporting man. To-day it was an elderly woman. They held me in view all day.\"\n\n\"Really, sir, you compliment me. Old Baron Dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost. And now you give my little impersonations your kindly praise?\"\n\n\"It was you—you yourself?\"\n\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders. \"You can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the Minories before you began to suspect.\"\n\n\"If I had known, you might never—\"\n\n\"Have seen this humble home again. I was well aware of it. We all have neglected opportunities to deplore. As it happens, you did not know, so here we are!\"\n\nThe Count's knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes. \"What you say only makes the matter worse. It was not your agents but your play-acting, busybody self! You admit that you have dogged me. Why?\"\n\n\"Come now, Count. You used to shoot lions in Algeria.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Why? The sport—the excitement—the danger!\"\n\n\"And, no doubt, to free the country from a pest?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\"\n\n\"My reasons in a nutshell!\"\n\nThe Count sprang to his feet, and his hand involuntarily moved back to his hip-pocket.\n\n\"Sit down, sir, sit down! There was another, more practical, reason. I want that yellow diamond!\"\n\nCount Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile.\n\n\"Upon my word!\" said he.\n\n\"You knew that I was after you for that. The real reason why you are here to-night is to find out how much I know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential. Well, I should say that, from your point of view, it is absolutely essential, for I know all about it, save only one thing, which you are about to tell me.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! And pray, what is this missing fact?\"\n\n\"Where the Crown diamond now is.\"\n\nThe Count looked sharply at his companion. \"Oh, you want to know that, do you? How the devil should I be able to tell you where it is?\"\n\n\"You can, and you will.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"You can't bluff me, Count Sylvius.\" Holmes's eyes, as he gazed at him, contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points of steel. \"You are absolute plate-glass. I see to the very back of your mind.\"\n\n\"Then, of course, you see where the diamond is!\"\n\nHolmes clapped his hands with amusement, and then pointed a derisive finger. \"Then you do know. You have admitted it!\"\n\n\"I admit nothing.\"\n\n\"Now, Count, if you will be reasonable we can do business. If not, you will get hurt.\"\n\nCount Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling. \"And you talk about bluff!\" said he.\n\nHolmes looked at him thoughtfully like a master chess-player who meditates his crowning move. Then he threw open the table drawer and drew out a squat notebook.\n\n\"Do you know what I keep in this book?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I do not!\"\n\n\"You!\"\n\n\"Me!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, you! You are all here—every action of your vile and dangerous life.\"\n\n\"Damn you, Holmes!\" cried the Count with blazing eyes. \"There are limits to my patience!\"\n\n\"It's all here, Count. The real facts as to the death of old Mrs. Harold, who left you the Blymer estate, which you so rapidly gambled away.\"\n\n\"You are dreaming!\"\n\n\"And the complete life history of Miss Minnie Warrender.\"\n\n\"Tut! You will make nothing of that!\"\n\n\"Plenty more here, Count. Here is the robbery in the train de-luxe to the Riviera on February 13, 1892. Here is the forged cheque in the same year on the Credit Lyonnais.\"\n\n\"No, you're wrong there.\"\n\n\"Then I am right on the others! Now, Count, you are a card-player. When the other fellow has all the trumps, it saves time to throw down your hand.\"\n\n\"What has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke?\"\n\n\"Gently, Count. Restrain that eager mind! Let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion. I have all this against you; but, above all, I have a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the Crown diamond.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"I have the cabman who took you to Whitehall and the cabman who brought you away. I have the commissionaire who saw you near the case. I have Ikey Sanders, who refused to cut it up for you. Ikey has peached, and the game is up.\"\n\nThe veins stood out on the Count's forehead. His dark, hairy hands were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion. He tried to speak, but the words would not shape themselves.\n\n\"That's the hand I play from,\" said Holmes. \"I put it all upon the table. But one card is missing. It's the king of diamonds. I don't know where the stone is.\"\n\n\"You never shall know.\"\n\n\"No? Now, be reasonable, Count. Consider the situation. You are going to be locked up for twenty years. So is Sam Merton. What good are you going to get out of your diamond? None in the world. But if you hand it over—well, I'll compound a felony. We don't want you or Sam. We want the stone. Give that up, and so far as I am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future. If you make another slip well, it will be the last. But this time my commission is to get the stone, not you.\"\n\n\"But if I refuse?\"\n\n\"Why, then—alas!—it must be you and not the stone.\"\n\nBilly had appeared in answer to a ring.\n\n\"I think, Count, that it would be as well to have your friend Sam at this conference. After all, his interests should be represented. Billy, you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door. Ask him to come up.\"\n\n\"If he won't come, sir?\"\n\n\"No violence, Billy. Don't be rough with him. If you tell him that Count Sylvius wants him he will certainly come.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do now?\" asked the Count as Billy disappeared.\n\n\"My friend Watson was with me just now. I told him that I had a shark and a gudgeon in my net; now I am drawing the net and up they come together.\"\n\nThe Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his back. Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his dressing-gown.\n\n\"You won't die in your bed, Holmes.\"\n\n\"I have often had the same idea. Does it matter very much? After all, Count, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal. But these anticipations of the future are morbid. Why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present?\"\n\nA sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing eyes of the master criminal. Holmes's figure seemed to grow taller as he grew tense and ready.\n\n\"It is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend,\" he said in a quiet voice. \"You know perfectly well that you dare not use it, even if I gave you time to draw it. Nasty, noisy things, revolvers, Count. Better stick to air-guns. Ah! I think I hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner. Good day, Mr. Merton. Rather dull in the street, is it not?\"\n\nThe prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid, obstinate, slab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking about him with a puzzled expression. Holmes's debonair manner was a new experience, and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile, he did not know how to counter it. He turned to his more astute comrade for help.\n\n\"What's the game now, Count? What's this fellow want? What's up?\" His voice was deep and raucous.\n\nThe Count shrugged his shoulders, and it was Holmes who answered.\n\n\"If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr. Merton, I should say it was all up.\"\n\nThe boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate.\n\n\"Is this cove trying to be funny, or what? I'm not in the funny mood myself.\"\n\n\"No, I expect not,\" said Holmes. \"I think I can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances. Now, look here, Count Sylvius. I'm a busy man and I can't waste time. I'm going into that bedroom. Pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence. You can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence. I shall try over the Hoffman 'Barcarole' upon my violin. In five minutes I shall return for your final answer. You quite grasp the alternative, do you not? Shall we take you, or shall we have the stone?\"\n\nHolmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he passed. A few moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom.\n\n\"What is it, then?\" asked Merton anxiously as his companion turned to him. \"Does he know about the stone?\"\n\n\"He knows a damned sight too much about it. I'm not sure that he doesn't know all about it.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" The boxer's sallow face turned a shade whiter.\n\n\"Ikey Sanders has split on us.\"\n\n\"He has, has he? I'll do him down a thick 'un for that if I swing for it.\"\n\n\"That won't help us much. We've got to make up our minds what to do.\"\n\n\"Half a mo',\" said the boxer, looking suspiciously at the bedroom door. \"He's a leary cove that wants watching. I suppose he's not listening?\"\n\n\"How can he be listening with that music going?\"\n\n\"That's right. Maybe somebody's behind a curtain. Too many curtains in this room.\" As he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time the effigy in the window, and stood staring and pointing, too amazed for words.\n\n\"Tut! it's only a dummy,\" said the Count.\n\n\"A fake, is it? Well, strike me! Madame Tussaud ain't in it. It's the living spit of him, gown and all. But them curtains Count!\"\n\n\"Oh, confound the curtains! We are wasting our time, and there is none too much. He can lag us over this stone.\"\n\n\"The deuce he can!\"\n\n\"But he'll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is.\"\n\n\"What! Give it up? Give up a hundred thousand quid?\"\n\n\"It's one or the other.\"\n\nMerton scratched his short-cropped pate.\n\n\"He's alone in there. Let's do him in. If his light were out we should have nothing to fear.\"\n\nThe Count shook his head.\n\n\"He is armed and ready. If we shot him we could hardly get away in a place like this. Besides, it's likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got. Hallo! What was that?\"\n\nThere was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window. Both men sprang round, but all was quiet. Save for the one strange figure seated in the chair, the room was certainly empty.\n\n\"Something in the street,\" said Merton. \"Now look here, guv'nor, you've got the brains. Surely you can think a way out of it. If slugging is no use then it's up to you.\"\n\n\"I've fooled better men than he,\" the Count answered. \"The stone is here in my secret pocket. I take no chances leaving it about. It can be out of England to-night and cut into four pieces in Amsterdam before Sunday. He knows nothing of Van Seddar.\"\n\n\"I thought Van Seddar was going next week.\"\n\n\"He was. But now he must get off by the next boat. One or other of us must slip round with the stone to Lime Street and tell him.\"\n\n\"But the false bottom ain't ready.\"\n\n\"Well, he must take it as it is and chance it. There's not a moment to lose.\" Again, with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct with the sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the window. Yes, it was surely from the street that the faint sound had come.\n\n\"As to Holmes,\" he continued, \"we can fool him easily enough. You see, the damned fool won't arrest us if he can get the stone. Well, we'll promise him the stone. We'll put him on the wrong track about it, and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in Holland and we out of the country.\"\n\n\"That sounds good to me!\" cried Sam Merton with a grin.\n\n\"You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a move on him. I'll see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession. I'll tell him that the stone is in Liverpool. Confound that whining music; it gets on my nerves! By the time he finds it isn't in Liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the blue water. Come back here, out of a line with that keyhole. Here is the stone.\"\n\n\"I wonder you dare carry it.\"\n\n\"Where could I have it safer? If we could take it out of Whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings.\"\n\n\"Let's have a look at it.\"\n\nCount Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate and disregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him.\n\n\"What—d'ye think I'm going to snatch it off you? See here, mister, I'm getting a bit tired of your ways.\"\n\n\"Well, well, no offence, Sam. We can't afford to quarrel. Come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly. Now hold it to the light! Here!\"\n\n\"Thank you!\"\n\nWith a single spring Holmes had leaped from the dummy's chair and had grasped the precious jewel. He held it now in one hand, while his other pointed a revolver at the Count's head. The two villains staggered back in utter amazement. Before they had recovered Holmes had pressed the electric bell.\n\n\"No violence, gentlemen—no violence, I beg of you! Consider the furniture! It must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one. The police are waiting below.\"\n\nThe Count's bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear.\n\n\"But how the deuce—?\" he gasped.\n\n\"Your surprise is very natural. You are not aware that a second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain. I fancied that you must have heard me when I displaced the figure, but luck was on my side. It gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence.\"\n\nThe Count gave a gesture of resignation.\n\n\"We give you best, Holmes. I believe you are the devil himself.\"\n\n\"Not far from him, at any rate,\" Holmes answered with a polite smile.\n\nSam Merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the situation. Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs outside, he broke silence at last.\n\n\"A fair cop!\" said he. \"But, I say, what about that bloomin' fiddle! I hear it yet.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" Holmes answered. \"You are perfectly right. Let it play! These modern gramophones are a remarkable invention.\"\n\nThere was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the criminals were led to the waiting cab. Watson lingered with Holmes, congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels. Once more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable Billy with his card-tray.\n\n\"Lord Cantlemere sir.\"\n\n\"Show him up, Billy. This is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests,\" said Holmes. \"He is an excellent and loyal person, but rather of the old regime. Shall we make him unbend? Dare we venture upon a slight liberty? He knows, we may conjecture, nothing of what has occurred.\"\n\nThe door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet face and drooping mid-Victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait. Holmes advanced affably, and shook an unresponsive hand.\n\n\"How do you do, Lord Cantlemere? It is chilly for the time of year, but rather warm indoors. May I take your overcoat?\"\n\n\"No, I thank you; I will not take it off.\"\n\nHolmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve.\n\n\"Pray allow me! My friend Dr. Watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious.\"\n\nHis Lordship shook himself free with some impatience.\n\n\"I am quite comfortable, sir. I have no need to stay. I have simply looked in to know how your self-appointed task was progressing.\"\n\n\"It is difficult—very difficult.\"\n\n\"I feared that you would find it so.\"\n\nThere was a distinct sneer in the old courtier's words and manner.\n\n\"Every man finds his limitations, Mr. Holmes, but at least it cures us of the weakness of self-satisfaction.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I have been much perplexed.\"\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\n\"Especially upon one point. Possibly you could help me upon\n\n\"You apply for my advice rather late in the day. I thought that you had your own all-sufficient methods. Still, I am ready to help you.\"\n\n\"You see, Lord Cantlemere, we can no doubt frame a case against the actual thieves.\"\n\n\"When you have caught them.\"\n\n\"Exactly. But the question is—how shall we proceed against the receiver?\"\n\n\"Is this not rather premature?\"\n\n\"It is as well to have our plans ready. Now, what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver?\"\n\n\"The actual possession of the stone.\"\n\n\"You would arrest him upon that?\"\n\n\"Most undoubtedly.\"\n\nHolmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend Watson could remember.\n\n\"In that case, my dear sir, I shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest.\"\n\nLord Cantlemere was very angry. Some of the ancient fires flickered up into his sallow cheeks.\n\n\"You take a great liberty, Mr. Holmes. In fifty years of official life I cannot recall such a case. I am a busy man, sir engaged upon important affairs, and I have no time or taste for foolish jokes. I may tell you frankly, sir, that I have never been a believer in your powers, and that I have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force. Your conduct confirms all my conclusions. I have the honour, sir, to wish you good-evening.\"\n\nHolmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and the door.\n\n\"One moment, sir,\" said he. \"To actually go off with the Mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it.\"\n\n\"Sir, this is intolerable! Let me pass.\"\n\n\"Put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, sir?\"\n\n\"Come—come, do what I ask.\"\n\nAn instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and stammering, with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm.\n\n\"What! What! How is this, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"Too bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad!\" cried Holmes. \"My old friend here will tell you that I have an impish habit of practical joking. Also that I can never resist a dramatic situation. I took the liberty—the very great liberty, I admit—of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview.\"\n\nThe old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him.\n\n\"Sir, I am bewildered. But—yes—it is indeed the Mazarin stone. We are greatly your debtors, Mr. Holmes. Your sense of humour may, as you admit, be somewhat perverted, and its exhibition remarkably untimely, but at least I withdraw any reflection I have made upon your amazing professional powers. But how—\"\n\n\"The case is but half finished; the details can wait. No doubt, Lord Cantlemere, your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke. Billy, you will show his Lordship out, and tell Mrs. Hudson that I should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible.\"\n\nII. — THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE\n\nFirst published in:\n\nThe Strand Magazine, February-March 1922\n\nHearst's International Magazine, February—March 1922\n\nFirst book appearance in The Case-Book Of Sherlock Holmes, 1927\n\nSomewhere in the vaults of the bank of Cox and Co., at Charing Cross, there is a travel-worn and battered tin dispatch-box with my name, John H. Watson, M.D., Late Indian Army, painted upon the lid. It is crammed with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the curious problems which Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at various times to examine. Some, and not the least interesting, were complete failures, and as such will hardly bear narrating, since no final explanation is forthcoming. A problem without a solution may interest the student, but can hardly fail to annoy the casual reader. Among these unfinished tales is that of Mr. James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world. No less remarkable is that of the cutter Alicia, which sailed one spring morning into a small patch of mist from where she never again emerged, nor was anything further ever heard of herself and her crew. A third case worthy of note is that of Isadora Persano, the well-known journalist and duellist, who was found stark staring mad with a match box in front of him which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science. Apart from these unfathomed cases, there are some which involve the secrets of private families to an extent which would mean consternation in many exalted quarters if it were thought possible that they might find their way into print. I need not say that such a breach of confidence is unthinkable, and that these records will be separated and destroyed now that my friend has time to turn his energies to the matter. There remain a considerable residue of cases of greater or less interest which I might have edited before had I not feared to give the public a surfeit which might react upon the reputation of the man whom above all others I revere. In some I was myself concerned and can speak as an eye-witness, while in others I was either not present or played so small a part that they could only be told as by a third person. The following narrative is drawn from my own experience.\n\nIt was a wild morning in October, and I observed as I was dressing how the last remaining leaves were being whirled from the solitary plane tree which graces the yard behind our house. I descended to breakfast prepared to find my companion in depressed spirits, for, like all great artists, he was easily impressed by his surroundings. On the contrary, I found that he had nearly finished his meal, and that his mood was particularly bright and joyous, with that somewhat sinister cheerfulness which was characteristic of his lighter moments.\n\n\"You have a case, Holmes?\" I remarked.\n\n\"The faculty of deduction is certainly contagious, Watson,\" he answered. \"It has enabled you to probe my secret. Yes, I have a case. After a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels move once more.\"\n\n\"Might I share it?\"\n\n\"There is little to share, but we may discuss it when you have consumed the two hard-boiled eggs with which our new cook has favoured us. Their condition may not be unconnected with the copy of the Family Herald which I observed yesterday upon the hall-table. Even so trivial a matter as cooking an egg demands an attention which is conscious of the passage of time and incompatible with the love romance in that excellent periodical.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later the table had been cleared and we were face to face. He had drawn a letter from his pocket.\n\n\"You have heard of Neil Gibson, the Gold King?\" he said.\n\n\"You mean the American Senator?\"\n\n\"Well, he was once Senator for some Western state, but is better known as the greatest gold-mining magnate in the world.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know of him. He has surely lived in England for some time. His name is very familiar.\"\n\n\"Yes, he bought a considerable estate in Hampshire some five years ago. Possibly you have already heard of the tragic end of his wife?\"\n\n\"Of course. I remember it now. That is why the name is familiar. But I really know nothing of the details.\"\n\nHolmes waved his hand towards some papers on a chair. \"I had no idea that the case was coming my way or I should have had my extracts ready,\" said he. \"The fact is that the problem, though exceedingly sensational, appeared to present no difficulty. The interesting personality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the evidence. That was the view taken by the coroner's jury and also in the police-court proceedings. It is now referred to the Assizes at Winchester. I fear it is a thankless business. I can discover facts, Watson, but I cannot change them. Unless some entirely new and unexpected ones come to light I do not see what my client can hope for.\"\n\n\"Your client?\"\n\n\"Ah, I forgot I had not told you. I am getting into your involved habit, Watson, of telling a story backward. You had best read this first.\"\n\nThe letter which he handed to me, written in a bold, masterful hand, ran as follows:\n\nCLARIDGE'S HOTEL,\n\nOctober 3rd.\n\nDEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:\n\nI can't see the best woman God ever made go to her death without doing all that is possible to save her. I can't explain things—I can't even try to explain them, but I know beyond all doubt that Miss Dunbar is innocent. You know the facts—who doesn't? It has been the gossip of the country. And never a voice raised for her! It's the damned injustice of it all that makes me crazy. That woman has a heart that wouldn't let her kill a fly. Well, I'll come at eleven to-morrow and see if you can get some ray of light in the dark. Maybe I have a clue and don't know it. Anyhow, all I know and all I have and all I am are for your use if only you can save her. If ever in your life you showed your powers, put them now into this case.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. NEIL GIBSON.\n\n\"There you have it,\" said Sherlock Holmes, knocking out the ashes of his after-breakfast pipe and slowly refilling it. \"That is the gentleman I await. As to the story, you have hardly time to master all these papers, so I must give it to you in a nutshell if you are to take an intelligent interest in the proceedings. This man is the greatest financial power in the world, and a man, as I understand, of most violent and formidable character. He married a wife, the victim of this tragedy, of whom I know nothing save that she was past her prime, which was the more unfortunate as a very attractive governess superintended the education of two young children. These are the three people concerned, and the scene is a grand old manor house, the centre of a historical English state. Then as to the tragedy. The wife was found in the grounds nearly half a mile from the house, late at night, clad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her shoulders and a revolver bullet through her brain.\n\n\"No weapon was found near her and there was no local clue as to the murder. No weapon near her, Watson—mark that! The crime seems to have been committed late in the evening, and the body was found by a gamekeeper about eleven o'clock, when it was examined by the police and by a doctor before being carried up to the house. Is this too condensed, or can you follow it clearly?\"\n\n\"It is all very clear. But why suspect the governess?\"\n\n\"Well, in the first place there is some very direct evidence. A revolver with one discharged chamber and a calibre which corresponded with the bullet was found on the floor of her wardrobe.\" His eyes fixed and he repeated in broken words, \"On—the—floor—of—her—wardrobe.\" Then he sank into silence, and I saw that some train of thought had been set moving which I should be foolish to interrupt. Suddenly with a start he emerged into brisk life once more. \"Yes, Watson, it was found. Pretty damning, eh? So the two juries thought. Then the dead woman had a note upon her making an appointment at that very place and signed by the governess. How's that? Finally there is the motive. Senator Gibson is an attractive person. If his wife dies, who more likely to succeed her than the young lady who had already by all accounts received pressing attentions from her employer? Love, fortune, power, all depending upon one middle-aged life. Ugly, Watson—very ugly!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, Holmes.\"\n\n\"Nor could she prove an alibi. On the contrary, she had to admit that she was down near Thor Bridge—that was the scene of the tragedy—about that hour. She couldn't deny it, for some passing villager had seen her there.\"\n\n\"That really seems final.\"\n\n\"And yet, Watson—and yet! This bridge—a single broad span of stone with balustraded sides—carries the drive over the narrowest part of a long, deep, reed-girt sheet of water. Thor Mere it is called. In the mouth of the bridge lay the dead woman. Such are the main facts. But here, if I mistake not, is our client, considerably before his time.\"\n\nBilly had opened the door, but the name which he announced was an unexpected one. Mr. Marlow Bates was a stranger to both of us. He was a thin, nervous wisp of a man with frightened eyes and a twitching, hesitating manner —a man whom my own professional eye would judge to be on the brink of an absolute nervous breakdown.\n\n\"You seem agitated, Mr. Bates,\" said Holmes. \"Pray sit down. I fear I can only give you a short time, for I have an appointment at eleven.\"\n\n\"I know you have,\" our visitor gasped, shooting out short sentences like a man who is out of breath. \"Mr. Gibson is coming. Mr. Gibson is my employer. I am manager of his estate. Mr. Holmes, he is a villain—an infernal villain.\"\n\n\"Strong language, Mr. Bates.\"\n\n\"I have to be emphatic, Mr. Holmes, for the time is so limited. I would not have him find me here for the world. He is almost due now. But I was so situated that I could not come earlier. His secretary, Mr. Ferguson, only told me this morning of his appointment with you.\"\n\n\"And you are his manager?\"\n\n\"I have given him notice. In a couple of weeks I shall have shaken off his accursed slavery. A hard man, Mr. Holmes, hard to all about him. Those public charities are a screen to cover his private iniquities. But his wife was his chief victim. He was brutal to her—yes, sir, brutal! How she came by her death I do not know, but I am sure that he had made her life a misery to her. She was a creature of the tropics, a Brazilian by birth, as no doubt you know.\"\n\n\"No, it had escaped me.\"\n\n\"Tropical by birth and tropical by nature. A child of the sun and of passion. She had loved him as such women can love, but when her own physical charms had faded—I am told that they once were great—there was nothing to hold him. We all liked her and felt for her and hated him for the way that he treated her. But he is plausible and cunning. That is all I have to say to you. Don't take him at his face value. There is more behind. Now I'll go. No, no, don't detain me! He is almost due.\"\n\nWith a frightened look at the clock our strange visitor literally ran to the door and disappeared.\n\n\"Well! Well!\" said Holmes after an interval of silence. \"Mr. Gibson seems to have a nice loyal household. But the warning is a useful one, and now we can only wait till the man himself appears.\"\n\nSharp at the hour we heard a heavy step upon the stairs, and the famous millionaire was shown into the room. As I looked upon him I understood not only the fears and dislike of his manager but also the execrations which so many business rivals have heaped upon his head. If I were a sculptor and desired to idealise the successful man of affairs, iron of nerve and leathery of conscience, I should choose Mr. Neil Gibson as my model. His tall, gaunt, craggy figure had a suggestion of hunger and rapacity. An Abraham Lincoln keyed to base uses instead of high ones would give some idea of the man. His face might have been chiselled in granite, hard-set, craggy, remorseless, with deep lines upon it, the scars of many a crisis. Cold grey eyes, looking shrewdly out from under bristling brows, surveyed us each in turn. He bowed in perfunctory fashion as Holmes mentioned my name, and then with a masterful air of possession he drew a chair up to my companion and seated himself with his bony knees almost touching him.\n\n\"Let me say right here, Mr. Holmes,\" he began, \"that money is nothing to me in this case. You can burn it if it's any use in lighting you to the truth. This woman is innocent and this woman has to be cleared, and it's up to you to do it. Name your figure!\"\n\n\"My professional charges are upon a fixed scale,\" said Holmes coldly. \"I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.\"\n\n\"Well, if dollars make no difference to you, think of the reputation. If you pull this off every paper in England and America will be booming you. You'll be the talk of two continents.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Gibson, I do not think that I am in need of booming. It may surprise you to know that I prefer to work anonymously, and that it is the problem itself which attracts me. But we are wasting time. Let us get down to the facts.\"\n\n\"I think that you will find all the main ones in the press reports. I don't know that I can add anything which will help you. But if there is anything you would wish more light upon—well, I am here to give it.\"\n\n\"Well, there is just one point.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"What were the exact relations between you and Miss Dunbar?\"\n\nThe Gold King gave a violent start and half rose from his chair. Then his massive calm came back to him.\n\n\"I suppose you are within your rights—and maybe doing your duty —in asking such a question, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"We will agree to suppose so,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"Then I can assure you that our relations were entirely and always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never conversed with, or ever saw, save when she was in the company of his children.\"\n\nHolmes rose from his chair.\n\n\"I am a rather busy man, Mr. Gibson,\" said he, \"and I have no time or taste for aimless conversations. I wish you good-morning.\"\n\nOur visitor had risen also, and his great loose figure towered above Holmes. There was an angry gleam from under those bristling brows and a tinge of colour in the sallow cheeks.\n\n\"What the devil do you mean by this, Mr. Holmes? Do you dismiss my case?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Gibson, at least I dismiss you. I should have thought my words were plain.\"\n\n\"Plain enough, but what's at the back of it? Raising the price on me, or afraid to tackle it, or what? I've a right to a plain answer.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you have,\" said Holmes. \"I'll give you one. This case is quite sufficiently complicated to start with without the further difficulty of false information.\"\n\n\"Meaning that I lie.\"\n\n\"Well, I was trying to express it as delicately as I could, but if you insist upon the word I will not contradict you.\"\n\nI sprang to my feet, for the expression upon the millionaire's face was fiendish in its intensity, and he had raised his great knotted fist. Holmes smiled languidly and reached his hand out for his pipe.\n\n\"Don't be noisy, Mr. Gibson. I find that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling. I suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage.\"\n\nWith an effort the Gold King mastered his fury. I could not but admire him, for by a supreme self-command he had turned in a minute from a hot flame of anger to a frigid and contemptuous indifference.\n\n\"Well, it's your choice. I guess you know how to run your own business. I can't make you touch the case against your will. You've done yourself no good this morning, Mr. Holmes, for I have broken stronger men than you. No man ever crossed me and was the better for it.\"\n\n\"So many have said so, and yet here I am,\" said Holmes, smiling. \"Well, good-morning, Mr. Gibson. You have a good deal yet to learn.\"\n\nOur visitor made a noisy exit, but Holmes smoked in imperturbable silence with dreamy eyes fixed upon the ceiling.\n\n\"Any views, Watson?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"Well, Holmes, I must confess that when I consider that this is a man who would certainly brush any obstacle from his path, and when I remember that his wife may have been an obstacle and an object of dislike, as that man Bates plainly told us, it seems to me—\"\n\n\"Exactly. And to me also.\"\n\n\"But what were his relations with the governess, and how did you discover them?\"\n\n\"Bluff, Watson, bluff! When I considered the passionate, unconventional, unbusinesslike tone of his letter and contrasted it with his self-contained manner and appearance, it was pretty clear that there was some deep emotion which centred upon the accused woman rather than upon the victim. We've got to understand the exact relations of those three people if we are to reach the truth. You saw the frontal attack which I made upon him, and how imperturbably he received it. Then I bluffed him by giving him the impression that I was absolutely certain, when in reality I was only extremely suspicious.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he will come back?\"\n\n\"He is sure to come back. He must come back. He can't leave it where it is. Ha! isn't that a ring? Yes, there is his footstep. Well, Mr. Gibson, I was just saying to Dr. Watson that you were somewhat overdue.\"\n\nThe Gold King had re-entered the room in a more chastened mood than he had left it. His wounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes, but his common sense had shown him that he must yield if he would attain his end.\n\n\"I've been thinking it over, Mr. Holmes, and I feel that I have been hasty in taking your remarks amiss. You are justified in getting down to the facts, whatever they may be, and I think the more of you for it. I can assure you, however, that the relations between Miss Dunbar and me don't really touch this case.\"\n\n\"That is for me to decide, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess that is so. You're like a surgeon who wants every symptom before he can give his diagnosis.\"\n\n\"Exactly. That expresses it. And it is only a patient who has an object in deceiving his surgeon who would conceal the facts of his case.\"\n\n\"That may be so, but you will admit, Mr. Holmes, that most men would shy off a bit when they are asked point-blank what their relations with a woman may be—if there is really some serious feeling in the case. I guess most men have a little private reserve of their own in some corner of their souls where they don't welcome intruders. And you burst suddenly into it. But the object excuses you, since it was to try and save her. Well, the stakes are down and the reserve open, and you can explore where you will. What is it you want?\"\n\n\"The truth.\"\n\nThe Gold King paused for a moment as one who marshals his thoughts. His grim, deep-lined face had become even sadder and more grave.\n\n\"I can give it to you in a very few words, Mr. Holmes,\" said he at last. \"There are some things that are painful as well as difficult to say, so I won't go deeper than is needful. I met my wife when I was gold-hunting in Brazil. Maria Pinto was the daughter of a government official at Manaos, and she was very beautiful. I was young and ardent in those days, but even now, as I look back with colder blood and a more critical eye, I can see that she was rare and wonderful in her beauty. It was a deep rich nature, too, passionate, whole-hearted, tropical, ill-balanced, very different from the American women whom I had known. Well, to make a long story short, I loved her and I married her. It was only when the romance had passed—and it lingered for years—that I realised that we had nothing—absolutely nothing—in common. My love faded. If hers had faded also it might have been easier. But you know the wonderful way of women! Do what I might, nothing could turn her from me. If I have been harsh to her, even brutal as some have said, it has been because I knew that if I could kill her love, or if it turned to hate, it would be easier for both of us. But nothing changed her. She adored me in those English woods as she had adored me twenty years ago on the banks of the Amazon. Do what I might, she was as devoted as ever.\n\n\"Then came Miss Grace Dunbar. She answered our advertisement and became governess to our two children. Perhaps you have seen her portrait in the papers. The whole world has proclaimed that she also is a very beautiful woman. Now, I make no pretence to be more moral than my neighbours, and I will admit to you that I could not live under the same roof with such a woman and in daily contact with her without feeling a passionate regard for her. Do you blame me, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"I do not blame you for feeling it. I should blame you if you expressed it, since this young lady was in a sense under your protection.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe so,\" said the millionaire, though for a moment the reproof had brought the old angry gleam into his eyes. \"I'm not pretending to be any better than I am. I guess all my life I've been a man that reached out his hand for what he wanted, and I never wanted anything more than the love and possession of that woman. I told her so.\"\n\n\"Oh, you did, did you?\"\n\nHolmes could look very formidable when he was moved.\n\n\"I said to her that if I could marry her I would, but that it was out of my power. I said that money was no object and that all I could do to make her happy and comfortable would be done.\"\n\n\"Very generous, I am sure,\" said Holmes with a sneer.\n\n\"See here, Mr. Holmes. I came to you on a question of evidence, not on a question of morals. I'm not asking for your criticism.\"\n\n\"It is only for the young lady's sake that I touch your case at all,\" said Holmes sternly. \"I don't know that anything she is accused of is really worse than what you have yourself admitted, that you have tried to ruin a defenceless girl who was under your roof. Some of you rich men have to be taught that all the world cannot be bribed into condoning your offences.\"\n\nTo my surprise the Gold King took the reproof with equanimity.\n\n\"That's how I feel myself about it now. I thank God that my plans did not work out as I intended. She would have none of it, and she wanted to leave the house instantly.\"\n\n\"Why did she not?\"\n\n\"Well, in the first place, others were dependent upon her, and it was no light matter for her to let them all down by sacrificing her living. When I had sworn—as I did—that she should never be molested again, she consented to remain. But there was another reason. She knew the influence she had over me, and that it was stronger than any other influence in the world. She wanted to use it for good.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Well, she knew something of my affairs. They are large, Mr. Holmes —large beyond the belief of an ordinary man. I can make or break —and it is usually break. It wasn't individuals only. It was communities, cities, even nations. Business is a hard game, and the weak go to the wall. I played the game for all it was worth. I never squealed myself, and I never cared if the other fellow squealed. But she saw it different. I guess she was right. She believed and said that a fortune for one man that was more than he needed should not be built on ten thousand ruined men who were left without the means of life. That was how she saw it, and I guess she could see past the dollars to something that was more lasting. She found that I listened to what she said, and she believed she was serving the world by influencing my actions. So she stayed—and then this came along.\"\n\n\"Can you throw any light upon that?\"\n\nThe Gold King paused for a minute or more, his head sunk in his hands, lost in deep thought.\n\n\"It's very black against her. I can't deny that. And women lead an inward life and may do things beyond the judgement of a man. At first I was so rattled and taken aback that I was ready to think she had been led away in some extraordinary fashion that was clean against her usual nature. One explanation came into my head. I give it to you, Mr. Holmes, for what it is worth. There is no doubt that my wife was bitterly jealous. There is a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as any body-jealousy, and though my wife had no cause—and I think she understood this—for the latter, she was aware that this English girl exerted an influence upon my mind and my acts that she herself never had. It was an influence for good, but that did not mend the matter. She was crazy with hatred and the heat of the Amazon was always in her blood. She might have planned to murder Miss Dunbar—or we will say to threaten her with a gun and so frighten her into leaving us. Then there might have been a scuffle and the gun gone off and shot the woman who held it.\"\n\n\"That possibility had already occurred to me,\" said Holmes. \"Indeed, it is the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder.\"\n\n\"But she utterly denies it.\"\n\n\"Well, that is not final—is it? One can understand that a woman placed in so awful a position might hurry home still in her bewilderment holding the revolver. She might even throw it down among her clothes, hardly knowing what she was doing, and when it was found she might try to lie her way out by a total denial, since all explanation was impossible. What is against such a supposition?\"\n\n\"Miss Dunbar herself.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps.\"\n\nHolmes looked at his watch. \"I have no doubt we can get the necessary permits this morning and reach Winchester by the evening train. When I have seen this young lady it is very possible that I may be of more use to you in the matter, though I cannot promise that my conclusions will necessarily be such as you desire.\"\n\nThere was some delay in the official pass, and instead of reaching Winchester that day we went down to Thor Place, the Hampshire estate of Mr. Neil Gibson. He did not accompany us himself, but we had the address of Sergeant Coventry, of the local police, who had first examined into the affair. He was a tall, thin, cadaverous man, with a secretive and mysterious manner which conveyed the idea that he knew or suspected a very great deal more than he dared say. He had a trick, too, of suddenly sinking his voice to a whisper as if he had come upon something of vital importance, though the information was usually commonplace enough. Behind these tricks of manner he soon showed himself to be a decent, honest fellow who was not too proud to admit that he was out of his depth and would welcome any help.\n\n\"Anyhow, I'd rather have you than Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes,\" said he. \"If the Yard gets called into a case, then the local loses all credit for success and may be blamed for failure. Now, you play straight, so I've heard.\"\n\n\"I need not appear in the matter at all,\" said Holmes to the evident relief of our melancholy acquaintance. \"If I can clear it up I don't ask to have my name mentioned.\"\n\n\"Well, it's very handsome of you, I am sure. And your friend, Dr. Watson, can be trusted, I know. Now, Mr. Holmes, as we walk down to the place there is one question I should like to ask you. I'd breathe it to no soul but you.\" He looked round as though he hardly dare utter the words. \"Don't you think there might be a case against Mr. Neil Gibson himself?\"\n\n\"I have been considering that.\"\n\n\"You've not seen Miss Dunbar. She is a wonderful fine woman in every way. He may well have wished his wife out of the road. And these Americans are readier with pistols than our folk are. It was his pistol, you know.\"\n\n\"Was that clearly made out?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. It was one of a pair that he had.\"\n\n\"One of a pair? Where is the other?\"\n\n\"Well, the gentleman has a lot of firearms of one sort and another. We never quite matched that particular pistol—but the box was made for two.\"\n\n\"If it was one of a pair you should surely be able to match it.\"\n\n\"Well, we have them all laid out at the house if you would care to look them over.\"\n\n\"Later, perhaps. I think we will walk down together and have a look at the scene of the tragedy.\"\n\nThis conversation had taken place in the little front room of Sergeant Coventry's humble cottage which served as the local police-station. A walk of half a mile or so across a wind-swept heath, all gold and bronze with the fading ferns, brought us to a side-gate opening into the grounds of the Thor Place estate. A path led us through the pheasant preserves, and then from a clearing we saw the widespread, half-timbered house, half Tudor and half Georgian, upon the crest of the hill. Beside us there was a long, reedy pool, constricted in the centre where the main carriage drive passed over a stone bridge, but swelling into small lakes on either side. Our guide paused at the mouth of this bridge, and he pointed to the ground.\n\n\"That was where Mrs. Gibson's body lay. I marked it by that stone.\"\n\n\"I understand that you were there before it was moved?\"\n\n\"Yes, they sent for me at once.\"\n\n\"Who did?\"\n\n\"Mr. Gibson himself. The moment the alarm was given and he had rushed down with others from the house, he insisted that nothing should be moved until the police should arrive.\"\n\n\"That was sensible. I gathered from the newspaper report that the shot was fired from close quarters.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, very close.\"\n\n\"Near the right temple?\"\n\n\"Just behind it, sir.\"\n\n\"How did the body lie?\"\n\n\"On the back, sir. No trace of a struggle. No marks. No weapon. The short note from Miss Dunbar was clutched in her left hand.\"\n\n\"Clutched, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, we could hardly open the fingers.\"\n\n\"That is of great importance. It excludes the idea that anyone could have placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false clue. Dear me! The note, as I remember, was quite short:\n\n\"I will be at Thor Bridge at nine o'clock. G. DUNBAR.\n\n\"Was that not so?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Did Miss Dunbar admit writing it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What was her explanation?\"\n\n\"Her defence was reserved for the Assizes. She would say nothing.\"\n\n\"The problem is certainly a very interesting one. The point of the letter is very obscure, is it not?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said the guide, \"it seemed, if I may be so bold as to say so, the only really clear point in the whole case.\"\n\nHolmes shook his head.\n\n\"Granting that the letter is genuine and was really written, it was certainly received some time before—say one hour or two. Why, then, was this lady still clasping it in her left hand? Why should she carry it so carefully? She did not need to refer to it in the interview. Does it not seem remarkable?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, as you put it, perhaps it does.\"\n\n\"I think I should like to sit quietly for a few minutes and think it out.\" He seated himself upon the stone ledge of the bridge, and I could see his quick grey eyes darting their questioning glances in every direction. Suddenly he sprang up again and ran across to the opposite parapet, whipped his lens from his pocket, and began to examine the stonework.\n\n\"This is curious,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, sir, we saw the chip on the ledge. I expect it's been done by some passer-by.\"\n\nThe stonework was grey, but at this one point it showed white for a space not larger than a sixpence. When examined closely one could see that the surface was chipped as by a sharp blow.\n\n\"It took some violence to do that,\" said Holmes thoughtfully. With his cane he struck the ledge several times without leaving a mark. \"Yes, it was a hard knock. In a curious place, too. It was not from above but from below, for you see that it is on the lower edge of the parapet.\"\n\n\"But it is at least fifteen feet from the body.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is fifteen feet from the body. It may have nothing to do with the matter, but it is a point worth noting. I do not think that we have anything more to learn here. There were no footsteps, you say?\"\n\n\"The ground was iron hard, sir. There were no traces at all.\"\n\n\"Then we can go. We will go up to the house first and look over these weapons of which you speak. Then we shall get on to Winchester, for I should desire to see Miss Dunbar before we go farther.\"\n\nMr. Neil Gibson had not returned from town, but we saw in the house the neurotic Mr. Bates who had called upon us in the morning. He showed us with a sinister relish the formidable array of firearms of various shapes and sizes which his employer had accumulated in the course of an adventurous life.\n\n\"Mr. Gibson has his enemies, as anyone would expect who knew him and his methods,\" said he. \"He sleeps with a loaded revolver in the drawer beside his bed. He is a man of violence, sir, and there are times when all of us are afraid of him. I am sure that the poor lady who has passed was often terrified.\"\n\n\"Did you ever witness physical violence towards her?\"\n\n\"No, I cannot say that. But I have heard words which were nearly as bad —words of cold, cutting contempt, even before the servants.\"\n\n\"Our millionaire does not seem to shine in private life,\" remarked Holmes as we made our way to the station. \"Well, Watson, we have come on a good many facts, some of them new ones, and yet I seem some way from my conclusion. In spite of the very evident dislike which Mr. Bates has to his employer, I gather from him that when the alarm came he was undoubtedly in his library. Dinner was over at 8:30 and all was normal up to then. It is true that the alarm was somewhat late in the evening, but the tragedy certainly occurred about the hour named in the note. There is no evidence at all that Mr. Gibson had been out of doors since his return from town at five o'clock. On the other hand, Miss Dunbar, as I understand it, admits that she had made an appointment to meet Mrs. Gibson at the bridge. Beyond this she would say nothing, as her lawyer had advised her to reserve her defence. We have several very vital questions to ask that young lady, and my mind will not be easy until we have seen her. I must confess that the case would seem to me to be very black against her if it were not for one thing.\"\n\n\"And what is that, Holmes?\"\n\n\"The finding of the pistol in her wardrobe.\"\n\n\"Dear me, Holmes!\" I cried, \"that seemed to me to be the most damning incident of all.\"\n\n\"Not so, Watson. It had struck me even at my first perfunctory reading as very strange, and now that I am in closer touch with the case it is my only firm ground for hope. We must look for consistency. Where there is a want of it we must suspect deception.\"\n\n\"I hardly follow you.\"\n\n\"Well now, Watson, suppose for a moment that we visualise you in the character of a woman who, in a cold, premeditated fashion, is about to get rid of a rival. You have planned it. A note has been written. The victim has come. You have your weapon. The crime is done. It has been workmanlike and complete. Do you tell me that after carrying out so crafty a crime you would now ruin your reputation as a criminal by forgetting to fling your weapon into those adjacent reed-beds which would forever cover it, but you must needs carry it carefully home and put it in your own wardrobe, the very first place that would be searched? Your best friends would hardly call you a schemer, Watson, and yet I could not picture you doing anything so crude as that.\"\n\n\"In the excitement of the moment.\"\n\n\"No, no, Watson, I will not admit that it is possible. Where a crime is coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated also. I hope, therefore, that we are in the presence of a serious misconception.\"\n\n\"But there is so much to explain.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall set about explaining it. When once your point of view is changed, the very thing which was so damning becomes a clue to the truth. For example, there is this revolver. Miss Dunbar disclaims all knowledge of it. On our new theory she is speaking truth when she says so. Therefore, it was placed in her wardrobe. Who placed it there? Someone who wished to incriminate her. Was not that person the actual criminal? You see how we come at once upon a most fruitful line of inquiry.\"\n\nWe were compelled to spend the night at Winchester, as the formalities had not yet been completed, but next morning, in the company of Mr. Joyce Cummings, the rising barrister who was entrusted with the defence, we were allowed to see the young lady in her cell. I had expected from all that we had heard to see a beautiful woman, but I can never forget the effect which Miss Dunbar produced upon me. It was no wonder that even the masterful millionaire had found in her something more powerful than himself—something which could control and guide him. One felt, too, as one looked at the strong, clear-cut, and yet sensitive face, that even should she be capable of some impetuous deed, none the less there was an innate nobility of character which would make her influence always for the good. She was a brunette, tall, with a noble figure and commanding presence, but her dark eyes had in them the appealing, helpless expression of the hunted creature who feels the nets around it, but can see no way out from the toils. Now, as she realised the presence and the help of my famous friend, there came a touch of colour in her wan cheeks and a light of hope began to glimmer in the glance which she turned upon us.\n\n\"Perhaps Mr. Neil Gibson has told you something of what occurred between us?\" she asked in a low, agitated voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" Holmes answered, \"you need not pain yourself by entering into that part of the story. After seeing you, I am prepared to accept Mr. Gibson's statement both as to the influence which you had over him and as to the innocence of your relations with him. But why was the whole situation not brought out in court?\"\n\n\"It seemed to me incredible that such a charge could be sustained. I thought that if we waited the whole thing must clear itself up without our being compelled to enter into painful details of the inner life of the family. But I understand that far from clearing it has become even more serious.\"\n\n\"My dear young lady,\" cried Holmes earnestly, \"I beg you to have no illusions upon the point. Mr. Cummings here would assure you that all the cards are at present against us, and that we must do everything that is possible if we are to win clear. It would be a cruel deception to pretend that you are not in very great danger. Give me all the help you can, then, to get at the truth.\"\n\n\"I will conceal nothing.\"\n\n\"Tell us, then, of your true relations with Mr. Gibson's wife.\"\n\n\"She hated me, Mr. Holmes. She hated me with all the fervour of her tropical nature. She was a woman who would do nothing by halves, and the measure of her love for her husband was the measure also of her hatred for me. It is probable that she misunderstood our relations. I would not wish to wrong her, but she loved so vividly in a physical sense that she could hardly understand the mental, and even spiritual, tie which held her husband to me, or imagine that it was only my desire to influence his power to good ends which kept me under his roof. I can see now that I was wrong. Nothing could justify me in remaining where I was a cause of unhappiness, and yet it is certain that the unhappiness would have remained even if I had left the house.\"\n\n\"Now, Miss Dunbar,\" said Holmes, \"I beg you to tell us exactly what occurred that evening.\"\n\n\"I can tell you the truth so far as I know it, Mr. Holmes, but I am in a position to prove nothing, and there are points—the most vital points —which I can neither explain nor can I imagine any explanation.\"\n\n\"If you will find the facts, perhaps others may find the explanation.\"\n\n\"With regard, then, to my presence at Thor Bridge that night, I received a note from Mrs. Gibson in the morning. It lay on the table of the schoolroom, and it may have been left there by her own hand. It implored me to see her there after dinner, said she had something important to say to me, and asked me to leave an answer on the sundial in the garden, as she desired no one to be in our confidence. I saw no reason for such secrecy, but I did as she asked, accepting the appointment. She asked me to destroy her note and I burned it in the schoolroom grate. She was very much afraid of her husband, who treated her with a harshness for which I frequently reproached him, and I could only imagine that she acted in this way because she did not wish him to know of our interview.\"\n\n\"Yet she kept your reply very carefully?\"\n\n\"Yes. I was surprised to hear that she had it in her hand when she died.\"\n\n\"Well, what happened then?\"\n\n\"I went down as I had promised. When I reached the bridge she was waiting for me. Never did I realise till that moment how this poor creature hated me. She was like a mad woman—indeed, I think she was a mad woman, subtly mad with the deep power of deception which insane people may have. How else could she have met me with unconcern every day and yet had so raging a hatred of me in her heart? I will not say what she said. She poured her whole wild fury out in burning and horrible words. I did not even answer—I could not. It was dreadful to see her. I put my hands to my ears and rushed away. When I left her she was standing, still shrieking out her curses at me, in the mouth of the bridge.\"\n\n\"Where she was afterwards found?\"\n\n\"Within a few yards from the spot.\"\n\n\"And yet, presuming that she met her death shortly after you left her, you heard no shot?\"\n\n\"No, I heard nothing. But, indeed, Mr. Holmes, I was so agitated and horrified by this terrible outbreak that I rushed to get back to the peace of my own room, and I was incapable of noticing anything which happened.\"\n\n\"You say that you returned to your room. Did you leave it again before next morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, when the alarm came that the poor creature had met her death I ran out with the others.\"\n\n\"Did you see Mr. Gibson?\"\n\n\"Yes, he had just returned from the bridge when I saw him. He had sent for the doctor and the police.\"\n\n\"Did he seem to you much perturbed?\"\n\n\"Mr. Gibson is a very strong, self-contained man. I do not think that he would ever show his emotions on the surface. But I, who knew him so well, could see that he was deeply concerned.\"\n\n\"Then we come to the all-important point. This pistol that was found in your room. Had you ever seen it before?\"\n\n\"Never, I swear it.\"\n\n\"When was it found?\"\n\n\"Next morning, when the police made their search.\"\n\n\"Among your clothes?\"\n\n\"Yes, on the floor of my wardrobe under my dresses.\"\n\n\"You could not guess how long it had been there?\"\n\n\"It had not been there the morning before.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Because I tidied out the wardrobe.\"\n\n\"That is final. Then someone came into your room and placed the pistol there in order to inculpate you.\"\n\n\"It must have been so.\"\n\n\"And when?\"\n\n\"It could only have been at meal-time, or else at the hours when I would be in the schoolroom with the children.\"\n\n\"As you were when you got the note?\"\n\n\"Yes, from that time onward for the whole morning.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Dunbar. Is there any other point which could help me in the investigation?\"\n\n\"I can think of none.\"\n\n\"There was some sign of violence on the stonework of the bridge—a perfectly fresh chip just opposite the body. Could you suggest any possible explanation of that?\"\n\n\"Surely it must be a mere coincidence.\"\n\n\"Curious, Miss Dunbar, very curious. Why should it appear at the very time of the tragedy, and why at the very place?\"\n\n\"But what could have caused it? Only great violence could have such an effect.\"\n\nHolmes did not answer. His pale, eager face had suddenly assumed that tense, far-away expression which I had learned to associate with the supreme manifestations of his genius. So evident was the crisis in his mind that none of us dared to speak, and we sat, barrister, prisoner, and myself, watching him in a concentrated and absorbed silence. Suddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrating with nervous energy and the pressing need for action.\n\n\"Come, Watson, come!\" he cried.\n\n\"What is it, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"Never mind, my dear lady. You will hear from me, Mr. Cummings. With the help of the god of justice I will give you a case which will make England ring. You will get news by to-morrow, Miss Dunbar, and meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that I have every hope that the light of truth is breaking through.\"\n\nIt was not a long journey from Winchester to Thor Place, but it was long to me in my impatience, while for Holmes it was evident that it seemed endless; for, in his nervous restlessness he could not sit still, but paced the carriage or drummed with his long, sensitive fingers upon the cushions beside him. Suddenly, however, as we neared our destination he seated himself opposite to me—we had a first-class carriage to ourselves—and laying a hand upon each of my knees he looked into my eyes with the peculiarly mischievous gaze which was characteristic of his more imp-like moods.\n\n\"Watson,\" said he, \"I have some recollection that you go armed upon these excursions of ours.\"\n\nIt was as well for him that I did so, for he took little care for his own safety when his mind was once absorbed by a problem so that more than once my revolver had been a good friend in need. I reminded him of the fact.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I am a little absent-minded in such matters. But have you your revolver on you?\"\n\nI produced it from my hip-pocket, a short, handy, but very serviceable little weapon. He undid the catch, shook out the cartridges, and examined it with care.\n\n\"It's heavy—remarkably heavy,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, it is a solid bit of work.\"\n\nHe mused over it for a minute.\n\n\"Do you know, Watson,\" said he, \"I believe your revolver is going to have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are investigating.\"\n\n\"My dear Holmes, you are joking.\"\n\n\"No, Watson, I am very serious. There is a test before us. If the test comes off, all will be clear. And the test will depend upon the conduct of this little weapon. One cartridge out. Now we will replace the other five and put on the safety-catch. So! That increases the weight and makes it a better reproduction.\"\n\nI had no glimmer of what was in his mind, nor did he enlighten me, but sat lost in thought until we pulled up in the little Hampshire station. We secured a ramshackle trap, and in a quarter of an hour were at the house of our confidential friend, the sergeant.\n\n\"A clue, Mr. Holmes? What is it?\"\n\n\"It all depends upon the behaviour of Dr. Watson's revolver,\" said my friend. \"Here it is. Now, officer, can you give me ten yards of string?\"\n\nThe village shop provided a ball of stout twine.\n\n\"I think that this is all we will need,\" said Holmes. \"Now, if you please, we will get off on what I hope is the last stage of our journey.\"\n\nThe sun was setting and turning the rolling Hampshire moor into a wonderful autumnal panorama. The sergeant, with many critical and incredulous glances, which showed his deep doubts of the sanity of my companion, lurched along beside us. As we approached the scene of the crime I could see that my friend under all his habitual coolness was in truth deeply agitated.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said in answer to my remark, \"you have seen me miss my mark before, Watson. I have an instinct for such things, and yet it has sometimes played me false. It seemed a certainty when first it flashed across my mind in the cell at Winchester, but one drawback of an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a false one. And yet—and yet—Well, Watson, we can but try.\"\n\nAs he walked he had firmly tied one end of the string to the handle of the revolver. We had now reached the scene of the tragedy. With great care he marked out under the guidance of the policeman the exact spot where the body had been stretched. He then hunted among the heather and the ferns until he found a considerable stone. This he secured to the other end of his line of string, and he hung it over the parapet of the bridge so that it swung clear above the water. He then stood on the fatal spot, some distance from the edge of the bridge, with my revolver in his hand, the string being taut between the weapon and the heavy stone on the farther side.\n\n\"Now for it!\" he cried.\n\nAt the words he raised the pistol to his head, and then let go his grip. In an instant it had been whisked away by the weight of the stone, had struck with a sharp crack against the parapet, and had vanished over the side into the water. It had hardly gone before Holmes was kneeling beside the stonework, and a joyous cry showed that he had found what he expected.\n\n\"Was there ever a more exact demonstration?\" he cried. \"See, Watson, your revolver has solved the problem!\" As he spoke he pointed to a second chip of the exact size and shape of the first which had appeared on the under edge of the stone balustrade.\n\n\"We'll stay at the inn to-night,\" he continued as he rose and faced the astonished sergeant. \"You will, of course, get a grappling-hook and you will easily restore my friend's revolver. You will also find beside it the revolver, string and weight with which this vindictive woman attempted to disguise her own crime and to fasten a charge of murder upon an innocent victim. You can let Mr. Gibson know that I will see him in the morning, when steps can be taken for Miss Dunbar's vindication.\"\n\nLate that evening, as we sat together smoking our pipes in the village inn, Holmes gave me a brief review of what had passed.\n\n\"I fear, Watson,\" said he, \"that you will not improve any reputation which I may have acquired by adding the case of the Thor Bridge mystery to your annals. I have been sluggish in mind and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the basis of my art. I confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true solution, and that I blame myself for not having attained it sooner.\n\n\"It must be admitted that the workings of this unhappy woman's mind were deep and subtle, so that it was no very simple matter to unravel her plot. I do not think that in our adventures we have ever come across a stranger example of what perverted love can bring about. Whether Miss Dunbar was her rival in a physical or in a merely mental sense seems to have been equally unforgivable in her eyes. No doubt she blamed this innocent lady for all those harsh dealings and unkind words with which her husband tried to repel her too demonstrative affection. Her first resolution was to end her own life. Her second was to do it in such a way as to involve her victim in a fate which was worse far than any sudden death could be.\n\n\"We can follow the various steps quite clearly, and they show a remarkable subtlety of mind. A note was extracted very cleverly from Miss Dunbar which would make it appear that she had chosen the scene of the crime. In her anxiety that it should be discovered she somewhat overdid it by holding it in her hand to the last. This alone should have excited my suspicions earlier than it did.\n\n\"Then she took one of her husband's revolvers—there was, as you saw, an arsenal in the house—and kept it for her own use. A similar one she concealed that morning in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe after discharging one barrel, which she could easily do in the woods without attracting attention. She then went down to the bridge where she had contrived this exceedingly ingenious method for getting rid of her weapon. When Miss Dunbar appeared she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred, and then, when she was out of hearing, carried out her terrible purpose. Every link is now in its place and the chain is complete. The papers may ask why the mere was not dragged in the first instance, but it is easy to be wise after the event, and in any case the expanse of a reed-filled lake is no easy matter to drag unless you have a clear perception of what you are looking for and where. Well, Watson, we have helped a remarkable woman, and also a formidable man. Should they in the future join their forces, as seems not unlikely, the financial world may find that Mr. Neil Gibson has learned something in that schoolroom of sorrow where our earthly lessons are taught.\"\n\nIII. — THE ADVENTURE OF THE CREEPING MAN\n\nFirst published in:\n\nThe Strand Magazine, March 1923\n\nHearst's International Magazine, March 1923\n\nFirst book appearance in The Case-Book Of Sherlock Holmes, 1927\n\nMR. SHERLOCK HOLMES was always of opinion that I should publish the singular facts connected with Professor Presbury, if only to dispel once for all the ugly rumours which some twenty years ago agitated the university and were echoed in the learned societies of London. There were, however, certain obstacles in the way, and the true history of this curious case remained entombed in the tin box which contains so many records of my friend's adventures. Now we have at last obtained permission to ventilate the facts which formed one of the very last cases handled by Holmes before his retirement from practice. Even now a certain reticence and discretion have to be observed in laying the matter before the public.\n\nIt was one Sunday evening early in September of the year 1903 that I received one of Holmes's laconic messages:\n\nCome at once if convenient—if inconvenient come all the same. S.H.\n\nThe relations between us in those latter days were peculiar. He was a man of habits, narrow and concentrated habits, and I had become one of them. As an institution I was like the violin, the shag tobacco, the old black pipe, the index books, and others perhaps less excusable. When it was a case of active work and a comrade was needed upon whose nerve he could place some reliance, my role was obvious. But apart from this I had uses. I was a whetstone for his mind. I stimulated him. He liked to think aloud in my presence. His remarks could hardly be said to be made to me—many of them would have been as appropriately addressed to his bedstead—but none the less, having formed the habit, it had become in some way helpful that I should register and interject. If I irritated him by a certain methodical slowness in my mentality, that irritation served only to make his own flame-like intuitions and impressions flash up the more vividly and swiftly. Such was my humble role in our alliance.\n\nWhen I arrived at Baker Street I found him huddled up in his armchair with updrawn knees, his pipe in his mouth and his brow furrowed with thought. It was clear that he was in the throes of some vexatious problem. With a wave of his hand he indicated my old armchair, but otherwise for half an hour he gave no sign that he was aware of my presence. Then with a start he seemed to come from his reverie, and with his usual whimsical smile he greeted me back to what had once been my home.\n\n\"You will excuse a certain abstraction of mind, my dear Watson,\" said he. \"Some curious facts have been submitted to me within the last twenty-four hours, and they in turn have given rise to some speculations of a more general character. I have serious thoughts of writing a small monograph upon the uses of dogs in the work of the detective.\"\n\n\"But surely, Holmes, this has been explored,\" said I. \"Bloodhounds—sleuth-hounds—\"\n\n\"No, no, Watson, that side of the matter is, of course, obvious. But there is another which is far more subtle. You may recollect that in the case which you, in your sensational way, coupled with the Copper Beeches, I was able, by watching the mind of the child, to form a deduction as to the criminal habits of the very smug and respectable father.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember it well.\"\n\n\"My line of thoughts about dogs is analogous. A dog reflects the family life. Whoever saw a frisky dog in a gloomy family, or a sad dog in a happy one? Snarling people have snarling dogs, dangerous people have dangerous ones. And their passing moods may reflect the passing moods of others.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Surely, Holmes, this is a little far-fetched,\" said I.\n\nHe had refilled his pipe and resumed his seat, taking no notice of my comment.\n\n\"The practical application of what I have said is very close to the problem which I am investigating. It is a tangled skein, you understand. and I am looking for a loose end. One possible loose end lies in the question: Why does Professor Presbury's wolfhound, Roy, endeavour to bite him?\"\n\nI sank back in my chair in some disappointment. Was it for so trivial a question as this that I had been summoned from my work? Holmes glanced across at me.\n\n\"The same old Watson!\" said he. \"You never learn that the gravest issues may depend upon the smallest things. But is it not on the face of it strange that a staid, elderly philosopher—you've heard of Presbury, of course, the famous Camford physiologist?—that such a man, whose friend has been his devoted wolfhound, should now have been twice attacked by his own dog? What do you make of it?\"\n\n\"The dog is ill.\"\n\n\"Well, that has to be considered. But he attacks no one else, nor does he apparently molest his master, save on very special occasions. Curious, Watson —very curious. But young Mr. Bennett is before his time if that is his ring. I had hoped to have a longer chat with you before he came.\"\n\nThere was a quick step on the stairs, a sharp tap at the door and a moment later the new client presented himself. He was a tall, handsome youth about thirty, well dressed and elegant, but with something in his bearing which suggested the shyness of the student rather than the self-possession of the man of the world. He shook hands with Holmes, and then looked with some surprise at me.\n\n\"This matter is very delicate, Mr. Holmes,\" he said. \"Consider the relation in which I stand to Professor Presbury both privately and publicly. I really can hardly justify myself if I speak before any third person.\"\n\n\"Have no fear, Mr. Bennett. Dr. Watson is the very soul of discretion, and I can assure you that this is a matter in which I am very likely to need an assistant.\"\n\n\"As you like, Mr. Holmes. You will, I am sure, understand my having some reserves in the matter.\"\n\n\"You will appreciate it, Watson, when I tell you that this gentleman, Mr. Trevor Bennett, is professional assistant to the great scientist, lives under his roof, and is engaged to his only daughter. Certainly we must agree that the professor has every claim upon his loyalty and devotion. But it may best be shown by taking the necessary steps to clear up this strange mystery.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Mr. Holmes. That is my one object. Does Dr. Watson know the situation?\"\n\n\"I have not had time to explain it.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps I had better go over the ground again before explaining some fresh developments.\"\n\n\"I will do so myself,\" said Holmes, \"in order to show that I have the events in their due order. The professor, Watson, is a man of European reputation. His life has been academic. There has never been a breath of scandal. He is a widower with one daughter, Edith. He is, I gather, a man of very virile and positive, one might almost say combative, character. So the matter stood until a very few months ago.\n\n\"Then the current of his life was broken. He is sixty-one years of age, but he became engaged to the daughter of Professor Morphy, his colleague in the chair of comparative anatomy. It was not, as I understand, the reasoned courting of an elderly man but rather the passionate frenzy of youth, for no one could have shown himself a more devoted lover. The lady, Alice Morphy, was a very perfect girl both in mind and body, so that there was every excuse for the professor's infatuation. None the less, it did not meet with full approval in his own family.\"\n\n\"We thought it rather excessive,\" said our visitor.\n\n\"Exactly. Excessive and a little violent and unnatural. Professor Presbury was rich, however, and there was no objection upon the part of the father. The daughter, however, had other views, and there were already several candidates for her hand, who, if they were less eligible from a worldly point of view, were at least more of an age. The girl seemed to like the professor in spite of his eccentricities. It was only age which stood in the way.\n\n\"About this time a little mystery suddenly clouded the normal routine of the professor's life. He did what he had never done before. He left home and gave no indication where he was going. He was away a fortnight and returned looking rather travel-worn. He made no allusion to where he had been, although he was usually the frankest of men. It chanced, however, that our client here, Mr. Bennett, received a letter from a fellowstudent in Prague, who said that he was glad to have seen Professor Presbury there, although he had not been able to talk to him. Only in this way did his own household learn where he had been.\n\n\"Now comes the point. From that time onward a curious change came over the professor. He became furtive and sly. Those around him had always the feeling that he was not the man that they had known, but that he was under some shadow which had darkened his higher qualities. His intellect was not affected. His lectures were as brilliant as ever. But always there was something new, something sinister and unexpected. His daughter, who was devoted to him, tried again and again to resume the old relations and to penetrate this mask which her father seemed to have put on. You, sir, as I understand, did the same—but all was in vain. And now, Mr. Bennett, tell in your own words the incident of the letters.\"\n\n\"You must understand, Dr. Watson, that the professor had no secrets from me. If I were his son or his younger brother I could not have more completely enjoyed his confidence. As his secretary I handled every paper which came to him, and I opened and subdivided his letters. Shortly after his return all this was changed. He told me that certain letters might come to him from London which would be marked by a cross under the stamp. These were to be set aside for his own eyes only. I may say that several of these did pass through my hands, that they had the E. C. mark, and were in an illiterate handwriting. If he answered them at all the answers did not pass through my hands nor into the letter-basket in which our correspondence was collected.\"\n\n\"And the box,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"Ah, yes, the box. The professor brought back a little wooden box from his travels. It was the one thing which suggested a Continental tour, for it was one of those quaint carved things which one associates with Germany. This he placed in his instrument cupboard. One day, in looking for a canula, I took up the box. To my surprise he was very angry, and reproved me in words which were quite savage for my curiosity. It was the first time such a thing had happened, and I was deeply hurt. I endeavoured to explain that it was a mere accident that I had touched the box, but all the evening I was conscious that he looked at me harshly and that the incident was rankling in his mind.\" Mr. Bennett drew a little diary book from his pocket. \"That was on July 2d,\" said he.\n\n\"You are certainly an admirable witness,\" said Holmes. \"I may need some of these dates which you have noted.\"\n\n\"I learned method among other things from my great teacher. From the time that I observed abnormality in his behaviour I felt that it was my duty to study his case. Thus I have it here that it was on that very day, July 2d, that Roy attacked the professor as he came from his study into the hall. Again, on July 11th, there was a scene of the same sort, and then I have a note of yet another upon July 20th. After that we had to banish Roy to the stables. He was a dear, affectionate animal—but I fear I weary you.\"\n\nMr. Bennett spoke in a tone of reproach, for it was very clear that Holmes was not listening. His face was rigid and his eyes gazed abstractedly at the ceiling. With an effort he recovered himself.\n\n\"Singular! Most singular!\" he murmured. \"These details were new to me, Mr. Bennett. I think we have now fairly gone over the old ground, have we not? But you spoke of some fresh developments.\"\n\nThe pleasant, open face of our visitor clouded over, shadowed by some grim remembrance. \"What I speak of occurred the night before last,\" said he. \"I was lying awake about two in the morning, when I was aware of a dull muffled sound coming from the passage. I opened my door and peeped out. I should explain that the professor sleeps at the end of the passage—\"\n\n\"The date being?\" asked Holmes.\n\nOur visitor was clearly annoyed at so irrelevant an interruption.\n\n\"I have said, sir, that it was the night before last—that is, September 4th.\"\n\nHolmes nodded and smiled.\n\n\"Pray continue,\" said he.\n\n\"He sleeps at the end of the passage and would have to pass my door in order to reach the staircase. It was a really terrifying experience, Mr. Holmes. I think that I am as strong-nerved as my neighbours, but I was shaken by what I saw. The passage was dark save that one window halfway along it threw a patch of light. I could see that something was coming along the passage, something dark and crouching. Then suddenly it emerged into the light, and I saw that it was he. He was crawling, Mr. Holmes—crawling! He was not quite on his hands and knees. I should rather say on his hands and feet, with his face sunk between his hands. Yet he seemed to move with ease. I was so paralyzed by the sight that it was not until he had reached my door that I was able to step forward and ask if I could assist him. His answer was extraordinary. He sprang up, spat out some atrocious word at me, and hurried on past me, and down the staircase. I waited about for an hour, but he did not come back. It must have been daylight before he regained his room.\"\n\n\"Well, Watson, what make you of that?\" asked Holmes with the air of the pathologist who presents a rare specimen.\n\n\"Lumbago, possibly. I have known a severe attack make a man walk in just such a way, and nothing would be more trying to the temper.\"\n\n\"Good, Watson! You always keep us flat-footed on the ground. But we can hardly accept lumbago, since he was able to stand erect in a moment.\"\n\n\"He was never better in health,\" said Bennett. \"In fact, he is stronger than I have known him for years. But there are the facts, Mr. Holmes. It is not a case in which we can consult the police, and yet we are utterly at our wit's end as to what to do, and we feel in some strange way that we are drifting towards disaster. Edith—Miss Presbury—feels as I do, that we cannot wait passively any longer.\"\n\n\"It is certainly a very curious and suggestive case. What do you think, Watson?\"\n\n\"Speaking as a medical man,\" said I, \"it appears to be a case for an alienist. The old gentleman's cerebral processes were disturbed by the love affair. He made a journey abroad in the hope of breaking himself of the passion. His letters and the box may be connected with some other private transaction—a loan, perhaps, or share certificates, which are in the box.\"\n\n\"And the wolfhound no doubt disapproved of the financial bargain. No, no, Watson, there is more in "
