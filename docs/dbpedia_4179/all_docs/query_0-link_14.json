        "text": "Square One TV was a live-action series produced by Children's Television Workshop that ran on PBS from 1987 until 1994. The program was an attempt to counteract the \"math crisis\" affecting the nation's 8- to 12-year olds utilizing a sketch comedy/variety format spoofing and simulating TV programming, including cartoons, MTV-style music videos, game shows, and the serialized Dragnet parody Mathnet.\n\nProduction was spearheaded by the original Sesame Street executive producer Dave Connell, and his longtime Sesame associate, the series head writer Jim Thurman, who shared the title of senior producer. During its production run of five seasons, the series won five Daytime Emmy Awards. Reruns were seen from 1999-2002 on Noggin.\n\nMuppet Mentions[]\n\nIn the music video \"Less Than Zero\" (first shown in episode #103), composer Christopher Cerf briefly appears as a spectator, wearing a crew t-shirt for Big Bird in China.\n\nIn the first season episode #172, originally broadcast May 5, 1987, series cast members Arthur Howard and Larry Cedar portray Bert and Ernie in \"Caraway Street,\" parodying fellow CTW show Sesame Street. Ernie asks Bert for five dollars to buy a puppy, but Bert uses rounding and a calculator to show that maintaining a puppy will cost over four hundred dollars in one year. Ernie then asks him if he can borrow four hundred dollars.\n\nIn the Mathnet serial \"The Problem of the Missing Monkey\" (1987), the gorilla activist Jane Rice-Burroughs (played by Yeardley Smith) carries a Sesame Street tote bag bearing an illustration of Cookie Monster.\n\nIn episode #163, the aliens Grempod and Blotmo offer cast member Beverly Mickins a \"priceless treasure,\" which is just a chocolate chip cookie. They say a \"big blue furry thing that looked like a bathmat with eyes\" had told them it was \"the most precious material on this planet.\"\n\nIn episode #225, Harry Blackstone performs part of a magic trick by changing a set of quarters into a dollar bill. Beverly Mickins looks at it and says, \"How come Kermit's on this?\"\n\nThe camera pans by Kermit the Frog's caricature at Sardi's in the Mathnet serial \"The Case of the Unkidnapping\" (1991).\n\nConnections[]\n\nMarv Albert voiced himself in a \"Grown-Ups\" segment\n\nDebbie Allen appeared in a segment\n\nBob Arbogast voiced Mr. Beasley and others and played Byle Dupe in Mathnet's \"The Case of the Missing Air.\"\n\nBen and Jerry made a cameo appearance\n\nJohn Bentley played a stagehand in Mathnet’s \"The Case of the Unkidnapping\"\n\nFrank Biondo was the camera operator (season 2)\n\nTempestt Bledsoe performed the music video \"Time Keeper\"\n\nDowntown Julie Brown appeared in inserts and hosted the special Square One Video Jukebox\n\nBetty Buckley played Sally Storm in Mathnet’s \"The Case of the Mystery Weekend\"\n\nBuzzco Associates, Inc. produced the animated segments The Further Adventures of Zook & Alison\n\nAdam Carl played Noel Sphinx Jr. in Mathnet’s \"The Mystery of the Maltese Pigeon\"\n\nReg E.
