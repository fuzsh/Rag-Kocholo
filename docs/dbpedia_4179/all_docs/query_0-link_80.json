Such boundary conditions can be achieved by a magnetic flux through the ring. We find that a nonzero twist can improve communication through finite odd-numbered rings and enable high-fidelity multiparty quantum communication through spin rings (working near perfectly for rings of five and seven spins). We show that in certain cases, the twist results in the complete blockage of quantum-information flow to a certain site of the ring. This effect can be exploited to interface and entangle a flux qubit and a spin qubit without embedding the latter in a magnetic field\n\nBound states on the lattice with partially twisted boundary conditions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAgadjanov, D.; Guo, F.-K.; RÃ­os, G.; Rusetsky, A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe propose a method to study the nature of exotic hadrons by determining the wave function renormalization constant Z from lattice simulations. It is shown that, instead of studying the volume-dependence of the spectrum, one may investigate the dependence of the spectrum on the twisting angle, imposing twisted boundary conditions on the fermion fields on the lattice. In certain cases, e.g., the case of the DK bound state which is addressed in detail, it is demonstrated that the partial twisting is equivalent to the full twisting up to exponentially small corrections.\n\n'Duality twisted'boundary conditions in n-state Potts Models\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSchuetz, G.\n\n1992-11-01\n\nWe discuss a new class of toroidal boundary conditions for one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian with S n symmetry which are related to two-dimensional n-state Potts models in the extreme anisotropic Hamiltonian limit. At their self-dual point (a point were a second-order phase transition occurs for n=2,3,4) the duality transformation is shown to be an additional symmetry giving rise to a new class of 'duality twisted' toroidal boundary conditions. This corresponding Hamiltonians are given in terms of generators of the periodic Temprely-Lieb algebra with an odd number of generators. We discuss as an example the critical Ising model. Here the complete spectrum for the new boundary conditions can be obtained from a projection mechanism in the spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain.

We calculate the overlap of the twisted boundary states of G/H with the untwisted ones, and show that the twisted boundary states are consistently defined in the charge-conjugation modular invariant. The overlap of the twisted boundary states is expressed by the branching functions of a twisted affine Lie algebra. As a check of our argument, we study the diagonal coset theory so(2n) 1 +so(2n) 1 /so(2n) 2 , which is equivalent to the orbifold S 1 /Z 2 at a particular radius. We construct the boundary states twisted by the automorphisms of the unextended Dynkin diagram of so(2n), and show their mutual consistency by identifying their counterpart in the orbifold. For the triality of so(8), the twisted states of the coset theory correspond to neither the Neumann nor the Dirichlet boundary states of the orbifold and yield conformal boundary states that preserve only the Virasoro algebra.

The perturbative behavior of the energy density left angle E(t) right angle is used to define a running coupling at a scale given by the linear size of the finite volume box. We compute the non-perturbative running of the pure gauge SU(2) coupling constant and conclude that the technique is well suited for further applications due to the relatively mild cutoff effects of the step scaling function and the high numerical precision that can be achieved in lattice simulations. We also comment on the inclusion of matter fields.\n\nGeneralized nematohydrodynamic boundary conditions with application to bistable twisted nematic liquid-crystal displays\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nFang, Angbo\n\n2008-12-08\n\nParallel to the highly successful Ericksen-Leslie hydrodynamic theory for the bulk behavior of nematic liquid crystals (NLCs), we derive a set of coupled hydrodynamic boundary conditions to describe the NLC dynamics near NLC-solid interfaces. In our boundary conditions, translational flux (flow slippage) and rotational flux (surface director relaxation) are coupled according to the Onsager variational principle of least energy dissipation. The application of our boundary conditions to the truly bistable Ï -twist NLC cell reveals a complete picture of the dynamic switching processes. It is found that the thus far overlooked translation-rotation dissipative coupling at solid surfaces can accelerate surface director relaxation and enhance the flow rate. This can be utilized to improve the performance of electro-optical nematic devices by lowering the required switching voltages and reducing the switching times.

To test the flux tube picture he has studied the large distance limit of this theory, leading to a large coupling constant. To tackle this problem, he describes two approaches, in both of which twisted boundary conditions play an important role.

In this simulation, to access spatial components of momenta that are different from the integer multiples of 2Ï/L, we apply twisted boundary conditions to compute corresponding correlation functions. Electromagnetic form factors with more small four-momentum transfer are determined, and further we fit the electromagnetic charge radius for D and D{sub s} mesons, respectively.

All local conserved operators follow from the standard (Hermitian transfer operator in fundamental representation (with auxiliary spin s=1/2, and are all even with respect to a spin flip operation. However, the quasilocal family is generated by differentiation of a non-Hermitian highest weight transfer operator with respect to a complex auxiliary spin representation parameter s and includes also operators of odd parity. For a finite chain with open boundaries the time derivatives of quasilocal operators are not strictly vanishing but result in operators localized near the boundaries of the chain. We show that a simple modification of the non-Hermitian transfer operator results in exactly conserved, but still quasilocal operators for periodic or generally twisted boundary conditions. As an application, we demonstrate that implementing the new exactly conserved operator family for estimating the high-temperature spin Drude weight results, in the thermodynamic limit, in exactly the same lower bound as for almost conserved family and open boundaries. Under the assumption that the bound is saturating (suggested by agreement with previous thermodynamic Bethe ansatz calculations we propose a simple explicit construction of infinite time averages of local operators such as the spin current.\n\nTwisted boundary states and representation of generalized fusion algebra\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIshikawa, Hiroshi; Tani, Taro\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe mutual consistency of boundary conditions twisted by an automorphism group G of the chiral algebra is studied for general modular invariants of rational conformal field theories. We show that a consistent set of twisted boundary states associated with any modular invariant realizes a non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep) of the generalized fusion algebra, an extension of the fusion algebra by representations of the twisted chiral algebra associated with the automorphism group G. We check this result for several concrete cases. In particular, we find that two NIM-reps of the fusion algebra for su(3) k (k=3,5) are organized into a NIM-rep of the generalized fusion algebra for the charge-conjugation automorphism of su(3) k . We point out that the generalized fusion algebra is non-commutative if G is non-Abelian and provide some examples for G-bar S 3 . Finally, we give an argument that the graph fusion algebra associated with simple current extensions coincides with the generalized fusion algebra for the extended chiral algebra, and thereby explain that the graph fusion algebra contains the fusion algebra of the extended theory as a subalgebra\n\nStudy of twist boundaries in aluminium. Structure and intergranular diffusion\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLemuet, Daniel\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThis research thesis addresses the study of grain boundaries in oriented crystals, and more particularly the systematic calculation of intergranular structures and energies of twist boundaries of <001> axis in aluminium, the determination of intergranular diffusion coefficients of zinc in a set of twist bi-crystals of same axis encompassing a whole range of disorientations, and the search for a correlation between these experimental results and calculated structures\n\nTwisted quantum double model of topological order with boundaries\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBullivant, Alex; Hu, Yuting; Wan, Yidun\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe generalize the twisted quantum double model of topological orders in two dimensions to the case with boundaries by systematically constructing the boundary Hamiltonians. Given the bulk Hamiltonian defined by a gauge group G and a 3-cocycle in the third cohomology group of G over U (1 ) , a boundary Hamiltonian can be defined by a subgroup K of G and a 2-cochain in the second cochain group of K over U (1 ) . The consistency between the bulk and boundary Hamiltonians is dictated by what we call the Frobenius condition that constrains the 2-cochain given the 3-cocyle. We offer a closed-form formula computing the ground-state degeneracy of the model on a cylinder in terms of the input data only, which can be naturally generalized to surfaces with more boundaries. We also explicitly write down the ground-state wave function of the model on a disk also in terms of the input data only.\n\nNew Boundary-Driven Twist States in Systems with Broken Spatial Inversion Symmetry\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHals, Kjetil M. D.; Everschor-Sitte, Karin\n\n2017-09-01\n\nA full description of a magnetic sample includes a correct treatment of the boundary conditions (BCs). This is in particular important in thin film systems, where even bulk properties might be modified by the properties of the boundary of the sample. We study generic ferromagnets with broken spatial inversion symmetry and derive the general micromagnetic BCs of a system with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We demonstrate that the BCs require the full tensorial structure of the third-rank DMI tensor and not just the antisymmetric part, which is usually taken into account. Specifically, we study systems with Câ v symmetry and explore the consequences of the DMI. Interestingly, we find that the DMI already in the simplest case of a ferromagnetic thin film leads to a purely boundary-driven magnetic twist state at the edges of the sample. The twist state represents a new type of DMI-induced spin structure, which is completely independent of the internal DMI field. We estimate the size of the texture-induced magnetoresistance effect being in the range of that of domain walls.\n\nTEK twisted gradient flow running coupling\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nPÃ©rez, Margarita GarcÃ­a; Keegan, Liam; Okawa, Masanori\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe measure the running of the twisted gradient flow coupling in the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai (TEK) model, the SU(N) gauge theory on a single site lattice with twisted boundary conditions in the large N limit.\n\nGeneralised twisted partition functions\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nPetkova, V B\n\n2001-01-01\n\nWe consider the set of partition functions that result from the insertion of twist operators compatible with conformal invariance in a given 2D Conformal Field Theory (CFT). A consistency equation, which gives a classification of twists, is written and solved in particular cases. This generalises old results on twisted torus boundary conditions, gives a physical interpretation of Ocneanu's algebraic construction, and might offer a new route to the study of properties of CFT.\n\nOn reflection algebras and twisted Yangians\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDoikou, Anastasia\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIt is well known that integrable models associated to rational R matrices give rise to certain non-Abelian symmetries known as Yangians. Analogously boundary symmetries arise when general but still integrable boundary conditions are implemented, as originally argued by Delius, Mackay, and Short from the field theory point of view, in the context of the principal chiral model on the half-line. In the present study we deal with a discrete quantum mechanical system with boundaries, that is the N site gl(n) open quantum spin chain. In particular, the open spin chain with two distinct types of boundary condition known as soliton preserving and soliton nonpreserving is considered. For both types of boundaries we present a unified framework for deriving the corresponding boundary nonlocal charges directly at the quantum level. The nonlocal charges are simply coproduct realizations of particular boundary quantum algebras called boundary or twisted Yangians, depending on the choice of boundary conditions. Finally, with the help of linear intertwining relations between the solutions of the reflection equation and the generators of the boundary or twisted Yangians we are able to exhibit the exact symmetry of the open spin chain, namely we show that a number of the boundary nonlocal charges are in fact conserved quantities\n\nPeriodic solutions of asymptotically linear Hamiltonian systems without twist conditions\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nCheng Rong [Coll. of Mathematics and Physics, Nanjing Univ. of Information Science and Tech., Nanjing (China); Dept. of Mathematics, Southeast Univ., Nanjing (China); Zhang Dongfeng [Dept. of Mathematics, Southeast Univ., Nanjing (China)\n\n2010-05-15\n\nIn dynamical system theory, especially in many fields of applications from mechanics, Hamiltonian systems play an important role, since many related equations in mechanics can be written in an Hamiltonian form. In this paper, we study the existence of periodic solutions for a class of Hamiltonian systems. By applying the Galerkin approximation method together with a result of critical point theory, we establish the existence of periodic solutions of asymptotically linear Hamiltonian systems without twist conditions. Twist conditions play crucial roles in the study of periodic solutions for asymptotically linear Hamiltonian systems. The lack of twist conditions brings some difficulty to the study. To the authors' knowledge, very little is known about the case, where twist conditions do not hold. (orig.)\n\nPartial twisting for scalar mesons\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAgadjanov, Dimitri; MeiÃner, Ulf-G.; Rusetsky, Akaki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe possibility of imposing partially twisted boundary conditions is investigated for the scalar sector of lattice QCD. According to the commonly shared belief, the presence of quark-antiquark annihilation diagrams in the intermediate state generally hinders the use of the partial twisting. Using effective field theory techniques in a finite volume, and studying the scalar sector of QCD with total isospin I=1, we however demonstrate that partial twisting can still be performed, despite the fact that annihilation diagrams are present. The reason for this are delicate cancellations, which emerge due to the graded symmetry in partially quenched QCD with valence, sea and ghost quarks. The modified LÃ¼scher equation in case of partial twisting is given\n\nAn(1) affine Toda field theories with integrable boundary conditions revisited\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDoikou, Anastasia\n\n2008-01-01\n\nGeneric classically integrable boundary conditions for the A n (1) affine Toda field theories (ATFT) are investigated. The present analysis rests primarily on the underlying algebra, defined by the classical version of the reflection equation. We use as a prototype example the first non-trivial model of the hierarchy i.e. the A 2 (1) ATFT, however our results may be generalized for any A n (1) (n > 1). We assume here two distinct types of boundary conditions called some times soliton preserving (SP), and soliton non-preserving (SNP) associated to two distinct algebras, i.e. the reflection algebra and the (q) twisted Yangian respectively. The boundary local integrals of motion are then systematically extracted from the asymptotic expansion of the associated transfer matrix. In the case of SNP boundary conditions we recover previously known results. The other type of boundary conditions (SP), associated to the reflection algebra, are novel in this context and lead to a different set of conserved quantities that depend on free boundary parameters. It also turns out that the number of local integrals of motion for SP boundary conditions is 'double' compared to those of the SNP case.\n\nTwisting the Mirror TBA\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nArutyunov, G.E.; de Leeuw, M.; van Tongeren, S.J.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe study finite-size corrections to the magnon dispersion relation in three models which differ from string theory on AdS5 x S5 in their boundary conditions. Asymptotically, this is accomplished by twisting the transfer matrix in a way which manifestly preserves integrability. In model I all\n\nOn the extraction of spectral quantities with open boundary conditions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBruno, Mattia; Korcyl, Piotr; Lottini, Stefano; Schaefer, Stefan; Korzec, Tomasz\n\n2014-11-01\n\nWe discuss methods to extract decay constants, meson masses and gluonic observables in the presence of open boundary conditions. The ensembles have been generated by the CLS effort and have 2+1 flavors of O(a)-improved Wilson fermions with a small twisted-mass term as proposed by Luescher and Palombi. We analyse the effect of the associated reweighting factors on the computation of different observables.\n\nOn boundary superalgebras\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDoikou, Anastasia\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe examine the symmetry breaking of superalgebras due to the presence of appropriate integrable boundary conditions. We investigate the boundary breaking symmetry associated with both reflection algebras and twisted super-Yangians. We extract the generators of the resulting boundary symmetry as well as we provide explicit expressions of the associated Casimir operators.\n\nDeterminant of twisted chiral Dirac operator on the lattice\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFosco, C.D.; Randjbar Daemi, S.\n\n1995-04-01\n\nUsing the overlap formulation, we calculate the fermionic determinant on the lattice for chiral fermions with twisted boundary conditions in two dimensions. When the lattice spacing tends to zero we recover the results on the usual string-theory continuum calculations.

A. Baqir\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper deals with the study of flux density through a newly proposed twisted clad guide containing DB medium. The inner core and the outer clad sections are usual dielectrics, and the introduced twisted windings at the core-clad interface are treated under DB boundary conditions. The pitch angle of twist is supposed to greatly contribute towards the control over the dispersion characteristics of the guide. The eigenvalue equation for the guiding structure is deduced, and the analytical investigations are made to explore the propagation patterns of flux densities corresponding to the sustained low-order hybrid modes under the situation of varying pitch angles. The emphasis has been put on the effects due to the DB twisted pitch on the propagation of energy flux density through the guide.\n\nTwist operator correlation functions in O(n) loop models\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSimmons, Jacob J H; Cardy, John\n\n2009-01-01\n\nUsing conformal field theoretic methods we calculate correlation functions of geometric observables in the loop representation of the O(n) model at the critical point. We focus on correlation functions containing twist operators, combining these with anchored loops, boundaries with SLE processes and with double SLE processes. We focus further upon n = 0, representing self-avoiding loops, which corresponds to a logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT) with c = 0. In this limit the twist operator plays the role of a 0-weight indicator operator, which we verify by comparison with known examples. Using the additional conditions imposed by the twist operator null states, we derive a new explicit result for the probabilities that an SLE 8/3 winds in various ways about two points in the upper half-plane, e.g. that the SLE passes to the left of both points. The collection of c = 0 logarithmic CFT operators that we use deriving the winding probabilities is novel, highlighting a potential incompatibility caused by the presence of two distinct logarithmic partners to the stress tensor within the theory. We argue that both partners do appear in the theory, one in the bulk and one on the boundary and that the incompatibility is resolved by restrictive bulk-boundary fusion rules\n\nNew look at the dynamics of twisted accretion disks\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHatchett, S.P.; Begelman, M.C.; Sarazin, C.L.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nWe reexamine the dynamic response of a thin, accretion disk to twisting torques, guided by the earlier analyses by Bardeen and Petterson. We make several corrections to this earlier work, and present a new version of the twist equations consistent with their physical assumptions. By describing the distortion of the disk in terms Cartesian direction cosines rather than the Euler angles used by the earlier authors, we are able to transform the twist equations from a pair of coupled, nonlinear, partial differential equations to a single, linear, complex one. We write down formulae for the external twisting torques likley to be encountered in astrophysic, and we show that even with these driving torques our twist equation remains linear. We find exact, analytic solutions for steady state structure of a disk subject to Lense-Thirring torques by a nonaligned central Kerr black hole and also for the time-dependent problem of the structure of a slaved disk with its oscillating boundary conditions. Finally, we discuss the stability of disks against twisting modes and show that undriven disks and disks subject to time-independent driving torques are stable\n\nMonte Carlo simulations of segregation at [001] twist boundaries in a Pt(Au) alloy-II\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSeki, A.; Seidman, D.N.; Oh, Y.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThis paper reports on a three dimensional plot of the density of Au atoms versus the position which coordinates for the (002) planes, immediately adjacent to the interface, for a Î¸ = 5 degrees [001] twist boundary, suggests the presence of a hill-and-valley structure in the Au segregation behavior at 850 K. The valleys correspond to the regions of good atomic fit between the regions of misfit; the hills correspond to the cores of the pairs of orthogonal primary grain boundary dislocations. A model for the Monte Carlo simulations is developed that leads to a linear expression for S aver containing a core segregation factor (S core ). For this model S core a single Arrhenius plot and the Gibbs free binding energy of a Au atom to the cores of the primary grain boundary dislocations extracted; the binding enthalpy and entropy of segregation are 0.095 Â±0.01 eV and K B (0.49 Â± 0.19) respectively\n\nThe asymptotic behaviour of the heat equation in a twisted Dirichlet-Neumann waveguide\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nKrejÄiÅÃ­k, David; Zuazua, E.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 250, Ä. 5 (2011), s. 2334-2346 ISSN 0022-0396 R&D Projects: GA MÅ k LC06002 Institutional research plan: CEZ:AV0Z10480505 Keywords : Laplacian * Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions * Twist Subject RIV: BE - Theoretical Physics Impact factor: 1.277, year: 2011\n\nThe $SU(\\\\infty)$ twisted gradient flow running coupling\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nPÃ©rez, Margarita GarcÃ­a; Keegan, Liam; Okawa, Masanori\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe measure the running of the $SU(\\\\infty)$ 't Hooft coupling by performing a step scaling analysis of the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai (TEK) model, the SU($N$) gauge theory on a single site lattice with twisted boundary conditions. The computation relies on the conjecture that finite volume effects for SU(N) gauge theories defined on a 4-dimensional twisted torus are controlled by an effective size parameter $\\\\tilde l = l \\\\sqrt{N}$, with $l$ the torus period. We set the scale for the running coupling in terms of $\\\\tilde l$ and use the gradient flow to define a renormalized 't Hooft coupling $\\\\lambda(\\\\tilde l)$. In the TEK model, this idea allows the determination of the running of the coupling through a step scaling procedure that uses the rank of the group as a size parameter. The continuum renormalized coupling constant is extracted in the zero lattice spacing limit, which in the TEK model corresponds to the large $N$ limit taken at fixed value of $\\\\lambda(\\\\tilde l)$. The coupling constant is thus expected to coinc...\n\nThreshold corrections and gauge symmetry in twisted superstring models\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPierce, D.M.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThreshold corrections to the running of gauge couplings are calculated for superstring models with free complex world sheet fermions. For two N=1 SU(2)xU(1) 5 models, the threshold corrections lead to a small increase in the unification scale. Examples are given to illustrate how a given particle spectrum can be described by models with different boundary conditions on the internal fermions. We also discuss how complex twisted fermions can enhance the symmetry group of an N=4, SU(3)xU(1)xU(1) model to the gauge group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1). It is then shown how a mixing angle analogous to the Weinberg angle depends on the boundary conditions of the internal fermions\n\nElectronic and atomic structures of KFe2Se2 grain boundaries\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFan, Wei; Liu, Da-Yong; Zeng, Zhi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢Twist grain boundary has lower grain-boundary energy. â¢Twist grain-boundary has similar electronic structure to that in crystal. â¢Charge and magnetic-moment fluctuations are large within tilt grain boundary. â¢Bi-collinear AFM is most stable even with existence of grain boundary. â¢Insulating Fe-vacancy phase is stable with existence of twist grain boundary. -- Abstract: The electronic and atomic structures of the twist and tilt grain boundaries (GB) of the iron-based superconductor KFe 2 Se 2 are studied based on the simulations of the first principles density functional theory. Our results have clarified that the Î£5[0 0 1] twist grain boundary of KFe 2 Se 2 with layered structure has the lower grain-boundary energy. The local structure and the main features of the basic electronic structure within the [0 0 1] twist grain-boundary region have small differences compared with those in KFe 2 Se 2 crystal. The large fluctuations of the charges and magnetic moments are found in the [0 0 1] tilt grain-boundary regions, especially the former are more prominent. The bi-collinear anti-ferromagnetic order is the most stable magnetic order even with grain boundaries in the bulk.

We consider boundary conditions that arise from (1) extremizing the action, (2) BRST, rigid or local supersymmetry, or Îº(Siegel)-symmetry of the action, (3) closure of the set of boundary conditions under the symmetry transformations, and (4) the boundary limits of bulk Euler-Lagrange equations that are 'conjugate' to other boundary conditions. We find corrections to Neumann boundary conditions in the presence of a bulk tachyon field. We discuss a boundary superspace formalism. We also find that path integral quantization of the open string requires an infinite tower of boundary conditions that can be interpreted as a smoothness condition on the doubled interval; we interpret this to mean that for a path-integral formulation of open strings with only Neuman boundary conditions, the description in terms of orientifolds is not just natural, but is actually fundamental\n\nStability of twisted rods, helices and buckling solutions in three dimensions\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nMajumdar, Apala; Raisch, Alexander\n\n2014-01-01\n\nÂ© 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd & London Mathematical Society. We study stability problems for equilibria of a naturally straight, inextensible, unshearable Kirchhoff rod allowed to deform in three dimensions (3D), subject to terminal loads. We investigate the stability of the twisted, straight state in 3D for three different boundary-value problems, cast in terms of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for the Euler angles, with and without isoperimetric constraints. In all cases, we obtain explicit stability estimates in terms of the twist, external load and elastic constants and in the Dirichlet case, we compute bifurcation diagrams for the Euler angles as a function of the external load. In the same vein, we obtain explicit stability estimates for a family of prototypical helical equilibria in 3D and demonstrate that they are stable for a range of tensile and compressive forces. We propose a numerical L2-gradient flow model to study the stability and dynamical evolution (in viscous model situations) of Kirchhoff rod equilibria. In Nizette and Goriely 1999 J. Math.

We show that such complex Toda fields can either be restricted to take real values in the standard way or else they can be subjected to a 'twisted' reality condition associated to any Z 2 symmetry of the Cartan matrix or Dynkin diagram of the underlying algebra. Different reality conditions give rise to different lagrangian field theories. In the conformal case, however, these theories have the same central charge, while in the affine case they have the same mass spectrum. The construction of N=2 superconformal theories based on the superalgebras A(n, n-1) is clarified, and a new class of conformal field theories with positive kinetic energy based on the superalgebras C(n) is presented. The ideas developed are also relevant to understanding solition solutions in affine Toda theories with imaginary coupling constant.

At first the elliptic genus is calculated for the line bundle twisted chiral de Rham complex on a compact smooth toric manifold and K3 hypersurface in P 3 . Then we twist chiral de Rham complex by sheaves localized on positive codimension submanifolds in P 2 and calculate in each case the elliptic genus. In the last example the elliptic genus of chiral de Rham complex on P 2 twisted by SL(N) vector bundle with instanton number k is calculated. In all the cases considered we find the infinite tower of open string oscillator contributions and identify directly the open string boundary conditions of the corresponding bound state of D-branes\n\nProperties of the twisted Polyakov loop coupling and the infrared fixed point in the SU(3) gauge theories\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nItou, Etsuko\n\n2013-08-01\n\nWe report the nonperturbative behavior of the twisted Polyakov loop (TPL) coupling constant for the SU(3) gauge theories defined by the ratio of Polyakov loop correlators in finite volume with twisted boundary condition. We reveal the vacuum structures and the phase structure for the lattice gauge theory with the twisted boundary condition. Carrying out the numerical simulations, we determine the nonperturbative running coupling constant in this renormalization scheme for the quenched QCD and N_f=12 SU(3) gauge theories. First, we study the quenched QCD theory using the plaquette gauge action. The TPL coupling constant has a fake fixed point in the confinement phase. We discuss this fake fixed point of the TPL scheme and obtain the nonperturbative running coupling constant in the deconfinement phase, where the magnitude of the Polyakov loop shows the nonzero values. We also investigate the system coupled to fundamental fermions. Since we use the naive staggered fermion with the twisted boundary condition in our simulation, only multiples of 12 are allowed for the number of flavors. According to the perturbative two-loop analysis, the N_f=12 SU(3) gauge theory might have a conformal fixed point in the infrared region. However, recent lattice studies show controversial results for the existence of the fixed point. We point out possible problems in previous work, and present our careful study. Finally, we find the infrared fixed point (IRFP) and discuss the robustness of the nontrivial IRFP of a many-flavor system under the change of the analysis method. Some preliminary results were reported in the proceedings [E. Bilgici et al., PoS(Lattice 2009), 063 (2009); Itou et al., PoS(Lattice 2010), 054 (2010)] and the letter paper [T.

The twisted rudders have been designed computationally with the hydrodynamic characteristics in a self-propulsion condition in mind. The governing equation is the Navier-Stokes equations in an unsteady turbulent flow. The turbulence model applied is the Reynolds stress. The calculation was carried out in towing and self-propulsion conditions. The sliding mesh technique was employed to simulate the flow around the propeller. The speed performances of the ship with the twisted rudders were verified through model tests in a towing tank. The twisted versions showed greater performance driven by increased hull efficiency from less thrust deduction fraction and more effective wake fraction and decreased propeller rotating speed.\n\nGrain boundaries in Ni3Al. 2\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKung, H.; Sass, S.L.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis paper discusses the dislocation structure of small angle tilt and twist boundaries in ordered Ni 3 Al, with and without boron, investigated using transmission electron microscopy. Dislocation with Burgers vectors that correspond to anti-phase boundary (APB)-coupled superpartials were found in small angle twist boundaries in both boron-free and boron-doped Ni 3 Al, and a small angle tilt boundary in boron-doped Ni 3 Al. The boundary structures are in agreement with theoretical models proposed by Marcinkowski and co-workers. The APB energy determined from the dissociation of the grain boundary dislocations was lower than values reported for isolated APBs in Ni 3 Al. For small angle twist boundaries the presence of boron reduced the APB energy at the interface until it approached zero. This is consistent with the structure of these boundaries containing small regions of increased compositional disorder in the first atomic plane next to the interface\n\nNonsnaking doubly diffusive convectons and the twist instability\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBeaume, CÃ©dric, E-mail: ced.beaume@gmail.com; Knobloch, Edgar, E-mail: knobloch@berkeley.edu [Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720 (United States); Bergeon, Alain, E-mail: alain.bergeon@imft.fr [UniversitÃ© de Toulouse, INPT, UPS, IMFT (Institut de MÃ©canique des Fluides de Toulouse), AllÃ©e Camille Soula, F-31400 Toulouse, France and CNRS, IMFT, F-31400 Toulouse (France)\n\n2013-11-15\n\nDoubly diffusive convection in a three-dimensional horizontally extended domain with a square cross section in the vertical is considered. The fluid motion is driven by horizontal temperature and concentration differences in the transverse direction. When the buoyancy ratio N = â1 and the Rayleigh number is increased the conduction state loses stability to a subcritical, almost two-dimensional roll structure localized in the longitudinal direction. This structure exhibits abrupt growth in length near a particular value of the Rayleigh number but does not snake. Prior to this filling transition the structure becomes unstable to a secondary twist instability generating a pair of stationary, spatially localized zigzag states. In contrast to the primary branch these states snake as they grow in extent and eventually fill the whole domain. The origin of the twist instability and the properties of the resulting localized structures are investigated for both periodic and no-slip boundary conditions in the extended direction.\n\nThe role of the central element in the quantum algebra underlying the twisted XXZ chain\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMonteiro, M.R.; Roditi, I.; Rodrigues, L.M.C.S.; Sciuto, S.\n\n1995-03-01\n\nThe relationship among the XXZ Heisenberg model and three models obtained from it by various transformations is studied.

However, there are situations where the equipment should not be anchored. An unanchored piece of equipment is held to the floor only by the gravitational effect and, in the absence of friction, it could move freely. In the analytical investigation of an unanchored item during a seismic event, there is uncertainty on the proper simulation of the boundary conditions so that the analysis model will have no rigid-body motion. Seismic responses of a simple analytical model that is representative of a group of unanchored equipment have been investigated with different sets of simulated boundary conditions. The results show that, when the main interest of investigation is to assess the potential for tipping during an earthquake, the case with one of the four supporting pads simply supported, its two neighboring pads constrained against twisting motion, and all pads without vertical displacements yields the most conservative prediction. The analysis is applied to the fuel processing cell of the Integral Fast Reactor project. In order not to breach the liner of the existing facility and to keep operational flexibility of the fixtures, all new equipment to be installed within the fuel processing cell are required to be unanchored\n\nBoundary conditions in random sequential adsorption\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCieÅla, MichaÅ; Ziff, Robert M.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe influence of different boundary conditions on the density of random packings of disks is studied. Packings are generated using the random sequential adsorption algorithm with three different types of boundary conditions: periodic, open, and wall. It is found that the finite size effects are smallest for periodic boundary conditions, as expected. On the other hand, in the case of open and wall boundaries it is possible to introduce an effective packing size and a constant correction term to significantly improve the packing densities.\n\nQuantum âviolationâ of Dirichlet boundary condition\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nI.Y.

Subsequently, bursts occur intermittently and reconnection advances deeper into the untwisted region. Then, a companion pair of the linked twist-untwist flux tubes reconnect with each other to return to the original axisymmetric tube. The process is thus repeatable.

The computation relies on the conjecture that finite volume effects for SU(N) gauge theories defined on a 4-dimensional twisted torus are controlled by an effective size parameter l-tilde=lâN, with l the torus period. We set the scale for the running coupling in terms of l-tilde and use the gradient flow to define a renormalized ât Hooft coupling Î»(l-tilde). In the TEK model, this idea allows the determination of the running of the coupling through a step scaling procedure that uses the rank of the group as a size parameter. The continuum renormalized coupling constant is extracted in the zero lattice spacing limit, which in the TEK model corresponds to the large N limit taken at fixed value of Î»(l-tilde). The coupling constant is thus expected to coincide with that of the ordinary pure gauge theory at N=â. The idea is shown to work and permits us to follow the evolution of the coupling over a wide range of scales. At weak coupling we find a remarkable agreement with the perturbative two-loop formula for the running coupling.\n\nEffect of Magnetic Twist on Nonlinear Transverse Kink Oscillations of Line-tied Magnetic Flux Tubes\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTerradas, J.; Magyar, N.; Van Doorsselaere, T.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMagnetic twist is thought to play an important role in many structures of the solar atmosphere. One of the effects of twist is to modify the properties of the eigenmodes of magnetic tubes. In the linear regime standing kink solutions are characterized by a change in polarization of the transverse displacement along the twisted tube. In the nonlinear regime, magnetic twist affects the development of shear instabilities that appear at the tube boundary when it is oscillating laterally. These KelvinâHelmholtz instabilities (KHI) are produced either by the jump in the azimuthal component of the velocity at the edge of the sharp boundary between the internal and external part of the tube or by the continuous small length scales produced by phase mixing when there is a smooth inhomogeneous layer. In this work the effect of twist is consistently investigated by solving the time-dependent problem including the process of energy transfer to the inhomogeneous layer. It is found that twist always delays the appearance of the shear instability, but for tubes with thin inhomogeneous layers the effect is relatively small for moderate values of twist. On the contrary, for tubes with thick layers, the effect of twist is much stronger. This can have some important implications regarding observations of transverse kink modes and the KHI itself.\n\nTwisted supersymmetry: Twisted symmetry versus renormalizability\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDimitrijevic, Marija; Nikolic, Biljana; Radovanovic, Voja\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe discuss a deformation of superspace based on a Hermitian twist. The twist implies a *-product that is noncommutative, Hermitian and finite when expanded in a power series of the deformation parameter. The Leibniz rule for the twisted supersymmetry transformations is deformed. A minimal deformation of the Wess-Zumino action is proposed and its renormalizability properties are discussed. There is no tadpole contribution, but the two-point function diverges. We speculate that the deformed Leibniz rule, or more generally the twisted symmetry, interferes with renormalizability properties of the model. We discuss different possibilities to render a renormalizable model.\n\nOn Hydroelastic Body-Boundary Condition of Floating Structures\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nXia, Jinzhu\n\n1996-01-01\n\nA general linear body boundary condition of hydroelastic analysis of arbitrary shaped floating structures generalizes the classic kinematic rigid-body (Timman-Newman) boundary condition for seakeeping problems.

To this end, we apply a simple twisting ansatz to the D=10 ungauged maximal and half-maximal supersymmetric double field theories constructed previously within the so-called semi-covariant formalism. The twisting ansatz may not satisfy the section condition. Nonetheless, all the features of the semi-covariant formalism, including its complete covariantizability, are still valid after the twist under alternative consistency conditions. The twist allows gaugings as supersymmetry preserving deformations of the D=10 untwisted theories after Scherk-Schwarz-type dimensional reductions. The maximal supersymmetric twist requires an extra condition to ensure both the Ramond-Ramond gauge symmetry and the 32 supersymmetries unbroken.\n\nA non-local computational boundary condition for duct acoustics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZorumski, William E.; Watson, Willie R.; Hodge, Steve L.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nA non-local boundary condition is formulated for acoustic waves in ducts without flow. The ducts are two dimensional with constant area, but with variable impedance wall lining. Extension of the formulation to three dimensional and variable area ducts is straightforward in principle, but requires significantly more computation. The boundary condition simulates a nonreflecting wave field in an infinite duct. It is implemented by a constant matrix operator which is applied at the boundary of the computational domain. An efficient computational solution scheme is developed which allows calculations for high frequencies and long duct lengths. This computational solution utilizes the boundary condition to limit the computational space while preserving the radiation boundary condition. The boundary condition is tested for several sources. It is demonstrated that the boundary condition can be applied close to the sound sources, rendering the computational domain small. Computational solutions with the new non-local boundary condition are shown to be consistent with the known solutions for nonreflecting wavefields in an infinite uniform duct.\n\nStructural and electronic transformation in low-angle twisted bilayer graphene\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGargiulo, Fernando; Yazyev, Oleg V.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nExperiments on bilayer graphene unveiled a fascinating realization of stacking disorder where triangular domains with well-defined Bernal stacking are delimited by a hexagonal network of strain solitons. Here we show by means of numerical simulations that this is a consequence of a structural transformation of the moirÃ© pattern inherent to twisted bilayer graphene taking place at twist angles Î¸ below a crossover angle Î¸\\\\star=1.2\\\\circ . The transformation is governed by the interplay between the interlayer van der Waals interaction and the in-plane strain field, and is revealed by a change in the functional form of the twist energy density. This transformation unveils an electronic regime characteristic of vanishing twist angles in which the charge density converges, though not uniformly, to that of ideal bilayer graphene with Bernal stacking. On the other hand, the stacking domain boundaries form a distinct charge density pattern that provides the STM signature of the hexagonal solitonic network.\n\nAntireflective Boundary Conditions for Deblurring Problems\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarco Donatelli\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This survey paper deals with the use of antireflective boundary conditions for deblurring problems where the issues that we consider are the precision of the reconstruction when the noise is not present, the linear algebra related to these boundary conditions, the iterative and noniterative regularization solvers when the noise is considered, both from the viewpoint of the computational cost and from the viewpoint of the quality of the reconstruction. In the latter case, we consider a reblurring approach that replaces the transposition operation with correlation. For many of the considered items, the anti-reflective algebra coming from the given boundary conditions is the optimal choice. Numerical experiments corroborating the previous statement and a conclusion section end the paper.\n\nIntegral Method of Boundary Characteristics: Neumann Condition\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKot, V.

Results of a numerical analysis of the accuracy of solving heat-conduction problems with variable boundary conditions with the use of this algorithm are presented.

Landau's transformation is used, in order to work with a fixed number of nodes at each instant. Then, it is necessary to deal with a parabolic partial differential equation, whose diffusive and convective terms have variable coefficients. The partial differential equation is implicitly discretized, using Laasonen's scheme, always stable, instead of employing Crank-Nicholson sheme, as it has been done by Ferris and Hill. Fixed time and space steps (Ît, ÎÎ¾) are used, and the iteration is made with variable positions of the interface, i.e. varying Î´s until a boundary condition is satisfied. The model has the same features of the oxygen diffusion in absorbing tissue. It would be capable of estimating time variant radiation treatments of cancerous tumors.

Using the multiparticle collision dynamics method, we examine several proposals for stick boundary conditions, studying their properties in both plane Poiseuille flow (where fluid interacts with the boundary of a stationary macroscopic solid) and particle-based colloid simulations (where the boundaries are thermally affected and in motion). In addition, our simulations compare various collision rules designed to remove spurious slip near solid surfaces, and the effects of these rules on the thermal motion of colloidal particles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that stochastic reflection of the fluid at solid boundaries fails to faithfully represent stick boundary conditions, and conclude that bounce-back conditions should be applied at both mobile and stationary surfaces. Finally, we generalize these ideas to create partial slip boundary conditions at both stationary and mobile surfaces.\n\nSurface free energy for systems with integrable boundary conditions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGoehmann, Frank; Bortz, Michael; Frahm, Holger\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe surface free energy is the difference between the free energies for a system with open boundary conditions and the same system with periodic boundary conditions.

In the first part of the article, we give necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the given functions f, g and the nonlinearities Î±1, Î±2, for the solvability of the above nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems with the nonlinear boundary conditions. In other words, we establish a sort of ânonlinear Fredholm alternativeâ for our problem which extends the corresponding Landesman and Lazer result for elliptic problems with linear homogeneous boundary conditions. In the second part, we give some additional results on existence and uniqueness and we study the regularity of the weak solutions for these classes of nonlinear problems. More precisely, we show some global a priori estimates for these weak solutions in an Lâ-setting.\n\nProcessing mechanics of alternate twist ply (ATP) yarn technology\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nElkhamy, Donia Said\n\nPly yarns are important in many textile manufacturing processes and various applications. The primary process used for producing ply yarns is cabling. The speed of cabling is limited to about 35m/min. With the world's increasing demands of ply yarn supply, cabling is incompatible with today's demand activated manufacturing strategies. The Alternate Twist Ply (ATP) yarn technology is a relatively new process for producing ply yarns with improved productivity and flexibility. This technology involves self plying of twisted singles yarn to produce ply yarn. The ATP process can run more than ten times faster than cabling. To implement the ATP process to produce ply yarns there are major quality issues; uniform Twist Profile and yarn Twist Efficiency. The goal of this thesis is to improve these issues through process modeling based on understanding the physics and processing mechanics of the ATP yarn system. In our study we determine the main parameters that control the yarn twist profile. Process modeling of the yarn twist across different process zones was done. A computational model was designed to predict the process parameters required to achieve a square wave twist profile. Twist efficiency, a measure of yarn torsional stability and bulk, is determined by the ratio of ply yarn twist to singles yarn twist. Response Surface Methodology was used to develop the processing window that can reproduce ATP yarns with high twist efficiency. Equilibrium conditions of tensions and torques acting on the yarns at the self ply point were analyzed and determined the pathway for achieving higher twist efficiency. Mechanistic modeling relating equilibrium conditions to the twist efficiency was developed. A static tester was designed to zoom into the self ply zone of the ATP yarn. A computer controlled, prototypic ATP machine was constructed and confirmed the mechanistic model results. Optimum parameters achieving maximum twist efficiency were determined in this study. The\n\nTwist limits for late twisting double somersaults on trampoline.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYeadon, M R; Hiley, M J\n\n2017-06-14\n\nAn angle-driven computer simulation model of aerial movement was used to determine the maximum amount of twist that could be produced in the second somersault of a double somersault on trampoline using asymmetrical movements of the arms and hips. Lower bounds were placed on the durations of arm and hip angle changes based on performances of a world trampoline champion whose inertia parameters were used in the simulations. The limiting movements were identified as the largest possible odd number of half twists for forward somersaulting takeoffs and even number of half twists for backward takeoffs. Simulations of these two limiting movements were found using simulated annealing optimisation to produce the required amounts of somersault, tilt and twist at landing after a flight time of 2.0s. Additional optimisations were then run to seek solutions with the arms less adducted during the twisting phase. It was found that 3Â½ twists could be produced in the second somersault of a forward piked double somersault with arms abducted 8Â° from full adduction during the twisting phase and that three twists could be produced in the second somersault of a backward straight double somersault with arms fully adducted to the body. These two movements are at the limits of performance for elite trampolinists. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our method supplies boundary conditions for the Î¸-family of implicit one-step discretizations of Schroedinger's equation in time. The use of Mikusinski's operator approach in time avoids direct and inverse transforms between time and frequency domains and thus implements the boundary conditions in a direct manner. 14 refs., 9 figs\n\nRenormalization constants for 2-twist operators in twisted mass QCD\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAlexandrou, C.; Constantinou, M.; Panagopoulos, H.; Stylianou, F.; Korzec, T.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nPerturbative and nonperturbative results on the renormalization constants of the fermion field and the twist-2 fermion bilinears are presented with emphasis on the nonperturbative evaluation of the one-derivative twist-2 vector and axial-vector operators. Nonperturbative results are obtained using the twisted mass Wilson fermion formulation employing two degenerate dynamical quarks and the tree-level Symanzik improved gluon action. The simulations have been performed for pion masses in the range of about 450-260 MeV and at three values of the lattice spacing a corresponding to Î²=3.9, 4.05, 4.20. Subtraction of O(a 2 ) terms is carried out by performing the perturbative evaluation of these operators at 1-loop and up to O(a 2 ). The renormalization conditions are defined in the RI ' -MOM scheme, for both perturbative and nonperturbative results. The renormalization factors, obtained for different values of the renormalization scale, are evolved perturbatively to a reference scale set by the inverse of the lattice spacing. In addition, they are translated to MS at 2 GeV using 3-loop perturbative results for the conversion factors.\n\nTemperature jump boundary conditions in radiation diffusion\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAlonso, C.T.\n\n1976-12-01\n\nThe radiation diffusion approximation greatly simplifies radiation transport problems. Yet the application of this method has often been unnecessarily restricted to optically thick regions, or has been extended through the use of such ad hoc devices as flux limiters. The purpose of this paper is to review and draw attention to the use of the more physically appropriate temperature jump boundary conditions for extending the range of validity of the diffusion approximation. Pioneering work has shown that temperature jump boundary conditions remove the singularity in flux that occurs in ordinary diffusion at small optical thicknesses. In this review paper Deissler's equations for frequency-dependent jump boundary conditions are presented and specific geometric examples are calculated analytically for steady state radiation transfer. When jump boundary conditions are applied to radiation diffusion, they yield exact solutions which are naturally flux- limited and geometry-corrected. We believe that the presence of temperature jumps on source boundaries is probably responsible in some cases for the past need for imposing ad hoc flux-limiting constraints on pure diffusion solutions. The solution for transfer between plane slabs, which is exact to all orders of optical thickness, also provides a useful tool for studying the accuracy of computer codes\n\nBoundary condition histograms for modulated phases\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBenakli, M.; Gabay, M.; Saslow, W.M.\n\n1997-11-01\n\nBoundary conditions strongly affect the results of numerical computations for finite size inhomogeneous or incommensurate structures. We present a method which allows to deal with this problem, both for ground state and for critical properties: it combines fluctuating boundary conditions and specific histogram techniques. Our approach concerns classical as well as quantum systems. In particular, current-current correlation functions, which probe large scale coherence of the states, can be accurately evaluated. We illustrate our method on a frustrated two dimensional XY model.

The piston is constructed as a direct product IÃN, with I=[0,L]âR and N a smooth, compact Riemannian manifold with or without boundary. The study of the Casimir energy and force for this configuration is performed by employing the spectral zeta function regularization technique. The obtained analytic results depend explicitly on the spectral zeta function associated with the manifold N and the parameters describing the general boundary conditions imposed. These results are then specialized to the case in which the manifold N is a d-dimensional sphere.\n\nTwist deformations leading to Îº-PoincarÃ© Hopf algebra and their application to physics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJuriÄ, Tajron; Meljanac, Stjepan; Samsarov, Andjelo\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe consider two twist operators that lead to kappa-PoincarÃ© Hopf algebra, the first being an Abelian one and the second corresponding to a light-like kappa-deformation of PoincarÃ© algebra. The adventage of the second one is that it is expressed solely in terms of PoincarÃ© generators. In contrast to this, the Abelian twist goes out of the boundaries of PoincarÃ© algebra and runs into envelope of the general linear algebra. Some of the physical applications of these two different twist operators are considered. In particular, we use the Abelian twist to construct the statistics flip operator compatible with the action of deformed symmetry group. Furthermore, we use the light-like twist operator to define a star product and subsequently to formulate a free scalar field theory compatible with kappa-PoincarÃ© Hopf algebra and appropriate for considering the interacting Ï 4 scalar field model on kappa-deformed space.

Such a system has been recently studied within a twisted conformal field theory (CFT) approach [G. Cristofano, G. Maiella, V. Marotta, Mod. Phys. Lett. A 15 (2000) 1679; G. Cristofano, G. Maiella, V. Marotta, G. Niccoli, Nucl. Phys. B 641 (2002) 547] and shown to develop the phenomenon of flux fractionalization [G. Cristofano, V. Marotta, A. Naddeo, G. Niccoli, Eur. Phys. J. B 49 (2006) 83]. The relevance of a 'closed' geometry has been fully exploited in relating the topological properties of the ground state of the system to the presence of half flux quanta and the emergence of a topological order has been predicted [G. Cristofano, V. Marotta, A. Naddeo, J. Stat. Mech.: Theory Exp. (2005) P03006]. In this Letter the stability and transformation properties of the ground states under adiabatic magnetic flux change are analyzed and the deep consequences on the realization of a solid state qubit, protected from decoherence, are presented.\n\nModelling classroom conditions with different boundary conditions\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMarbjerg, Gerd HÃ¸y; Jeong, Cheol-Ho; Brunskog, Jonas\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA model that combines image source modelling and acoustical radiosity with complex boundary condition, thus including phase shifts on reflection has been developed.

Universitaria. C. P. 58040 Morelia, Michoacan (Mexico)\n\n2007-11-15\n\nA common approach for the numerical simulation of wave propagation on a spatially unbounded domain is to truncate the domain via an artificial boundary, thus forming a finite computational domain with an outer boundary. Absorbing boundary conditions must then be specified at the boundary such that the resulting initial-boundary value problem is well posed and such that the amount of spurious reflection is minimized. In this article, we review recent results on the construction of absorbing boundary conditions in General Relativity and their application to numerical relativity.\n\nTrickle-down boundary conditions in aeolian dune-field pattern formation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEwing, R. C.; Kocurek, G.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nOne the one hand, wind-blown dune-field patterns emerge within the overarching boundary conditions of climate, tectonics and eustasy implying the presence of these signals in the aeolian geomorphic and stratigraphic record. On the other hand, dune-field patterns are a poster-child of self-organization, in which autogenic processes give rise to patterned landscapes despite remarkable differences in the geologic setting (i.e., Earth, Mars and Titan). How important are climate, tectonics and eustasy in aeolian dune field pattern formation? Here we develop the hypothesis that, in terms of pattern development, dune fields evolve largely independent of the direct influence of 'system-scale' boundary conditions, such as climate, tectonics and eustasy. Rather, these boundary conditions set the stage for smaller-scale, faster-evolving 'event-scale' boundary conditions. This 'trickle-down' effect, in which system-scale boundary conditions indirectly influence the event scale boundary conditions provides the uniqueness and richness of dune-field patterned landscapes. The trickle-down effect means that the architecture of the stratigraphic record of dune-field pattern formation archives boundary conditions, which are spatially and temporally removed from the overarching geologic setting. In contrast, the presence of an aeolian stratigraphic record itself, reflects changes in system-scale boundary conditions that drive accumulation and preservation of aeolian strata.\n\nTwisting dependent properties of twisted carbon nanotube fibers: microstructure and strain transfer factors\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZhou, Jinyuan; Xie, Erqing; Sun, Gengzhi; Zhan, Zhaoyao; Zheng, Lianxi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe dependences of twisting parameters on the electric and mechanical properties of twisted CNT fibers were systematically studied. Results from electric and mechanical measurements showed that twisting intensity is very effective to improve the electric and mechanical properties of CNT fibers. Further calculations combined with Raman results indicate that the twisting treatments, to a certain extent, can greatly enhance the strain transfer factors of the samples, which dominates the mechanical properties of CNT fibers. In addition, studies on the effect of twisting speeds suggested that lower twisting speed can lead to higher uniformity but lower performances in the electric and mechanical properties, higher twisting speed to higher Youngâs modulus and higher conductance but lower uniformities. Ultra-strong uniform CNT fibers need to be prepared with a suitable twisting speed.

Local integrals of motion generated by the corresponding 'transfer' matrices give rise to time evolution equations for the initial Lax operator. We systematically identify the modified Lax pairs for both discrete and continuum boundary integrable models, depending on the classical r-matrix and the boundary matrix\n\nEnergy principle with included boundary conditions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLehnert, B.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nEarlier comments by the author on the limitations of the classical form of the extended energy principle are supported by a complementary analysis on the potential energy change arising from free-boundary displacements of a magnetically confined plasma. In the final formulation of the extended principle, restricted displacements, satisfying pressure continuity by means of plasma volume currents in a thin boundary layer, are replaced by unrestricted (arbitrary) displacements which can give rise to induced surface currents. It is found that these currents contribute to the change in potential energy, and that their contribution is not taken into account by such a formulation. A general expression is further given for surface currents induced by arbitrary displacements. The expression is used to reformulate the energy principle for the class of displacements which satisfy all necessary boundary conditions, including that of the pressure balance. This makes a minimization procedure of the potential energy possible, for the class of all physically relevant test functions which include the constraints imposed by the boundary conditions. Such a procedure is also consistent with a corresponding variational calculus.

We show that solving Cardy's equation, expressing consistency of a RCFT on a cylinder, is equivalent to finding integer valued matrix representations of the Verlinde algebra. These matrices allow us to naturally associate a graph G to each RCFT such that the conformal boundary conditions are labelled by the nodes of G. This approach is carried to completion for sl(2) theories leading to complete sets of conformal boundary conditions, their associated cylinder partition functions and the A-D-E classification. We also review the current status for WZW sl(3) theories. Finally, a systematic generalisation of the formalism of Cardy-Lewellen is developed to allow for multiplicities arising from more general representations of the Verlinde algebra. We obtain information on the bulk-boundary coefficients and reproduce the relevant algebraic structures from the sewing constraints\n\nEinstein boundary conditions for the 3+1 Einstein equations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFrittelli, Simonetta; Gomez, Roberto\n\n2003-01-01\n\nIn the 3+1 framework of the Einstein equations for the case of a vanishing shift vector and arbitrary lapse, we calculate explicitly the four boundary equations arising from the vanishing of the projection of the Einstein tensor along the normal to the boundary surface of the initial-boundary value problem. Such conditions take the form of evolution equations along (as opposed to across) the boundary for certain components of the extrinsic curvature and for certain space derivatives of the three-metric. We argue that, in general, such boundary conditions do not follow necessarily from the evolution equations and the initial data, but need to be imposed on the boundary values of the fundamental variables. Using the Einstein-Christoffel formulation, which is strongly hyperbolic, we show how three of the boundary equations up to linear combinations should be used to prescribe the values of some incoming characteristic fields. Additionally, we show that the fourth one imposes conditions on some outgoing fields\n\nOn the Boussinesq-Burgers equations driven by dynamic boundary conditions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhu, Neng; Liu, Zhengrong; Zhao, Kun\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe study the qualitative behavior of the Boussinesq-Burgers equations on a finite interval subject to the Dirichlet type dynamic boundary conditions. Assuming H1 ÃH2 initial data which are compatible with boundary conditions and utilizing energy methods, we show that under appropriate conditions on the dynamic boundary data, there exist unique global-in-time solutions to the initial-boundary value problem, and the solutions converge to the boundary data as time goes to infinity, regardless of the magnitude of the initial data.\n\nQuadratic Functionals with General Boundary Conditions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDosla, Z.; Dosly, O.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to give the Reid 'Roundabout Theorem' for quadratic functionals with general boundary conditions.

At present, it is known how to treat boundaries in the harmonic formulation of Einstein's equations and a tetrad formulation of the Einstein-Bianchi system. However, a universal approach valid for other formulations is not in hand. In particular, there is no satisfactory boundary theory for the 3+1 formulations which have been highly successful in binary black hole simulation. I discuss the underlying problems that make the initial-boundary-value problem much more complicated than the Cauchy problem. I review the progress that has been made and the important open questions that remain. Science is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition.

M.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe in-plane dc conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene is calculated using an expansion of the real-space Kubo-Bastin conductivity in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. We investigate within a tight-binding approach the transport properties as a function of rotation angle, applied perpendicular electric field, and vacancy disorder. We find that for high-angle twists, the two layers are effectively decoupled, and the minimum conductivity at the Dirac point corresponds to double the value observed in monolayer graphene. This remains valid even in the presence of vacancies, hinting that chiral symmetry is still preserved. On the contrary, for low twist angles, the conductivity at the Dirac point depends on the twist angle and is not protected in the presence of disorder. Furthermore, for low angles and in the presence of an applied electric field, we find that the chiral boundary states emerging between AB and BA regions contribute to the dc conductivity, despite the appearance of localized states in the AA regions. The results agree qualitatively with recent transport experiments in low-angle twisted bilayer graphene.\n\nTwisting the N=2 string\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKetov, S.V.; Lechtenfeld, O.; Parkes, A.J.\n\n1993-12-01\n\nThe most general homogeneous monodromy conditions in N= 2 string theory are classified in terms of the conjugacy classes of the global symmetry group U(1, 1) x Z 2 . For classes which generate a discrete subgroup Î, the corresponding target space backgrounds C 1,1 /Î include half spaces, complex orbifolds and tori. We propose a generalization of the intercept formula to matrix-valued twists, and find massless physical states in a number of twisted cases. In particular, the sixteen Z 2 -twisted sectors of the N = 2 string are investigated, and the corresponding ground states are identified via bosonization and BRST cohomology. We find enough room for an extended multiplet of 'spacetime' supersymmetry, with the number of supersymmetries being dependent on global 'spacetime' topology. Unfortunately, world-sheet locality for the chiral vertex operators does not permit interactions for the massless 'spacetime' fermions; however possibly, an asymmetric GSO projection could evade this problem.

Accurate conditions are developed which are based on the asymptotic analysis of wave propagation over long ranges. Employing the method of steepest descents, dominant wave groups are identified and simple approximations to the dispersion relation are considered in order to derive local boundary operators. The existence of a small number of dominant wave groups may be expected for systems with dissipation. Estimates of the error as a function of domain size are derived under general hypotheses, leading to convergence results.

The protypical example of this is the two-dimensional triangular lattice Ising model. The ferromagnetic model has two simple degenerate ground states of all spins up or down, but the antiferromagnetic model is a frustrated system. Its geometry does not allow satisfaction of the antiferro condition everywhere, which produces complex ordered structures with dimerization of the spins [1]. Without frustration, the complex structures and phase behavior are lost. All of the topics discussed in this thesis concern smectic liquid crystals. Liquid crystals are perhaps uniquely adept at manifesting frustrated phases. Their combination of periodicity in one or more dimensions allows ordered structures, yet their fluid nature in remaining dimensions allows creation of defects and extraordinarily complex structures in ways that a normal crystal could not tolerate. Liquid crystals contain a huge menagerie of frustrated phases and effects including the polarization modulated [2], vortex lattice [3], twist grain boundary [4], and blue [5] phases, as well as frustrated structures such as cholesteric or SmC* helix unwinding [6], defect lattices in thin films [7], and bend melted grain boundary defects [8], arising from boundary conditions and field effects. In this thesis, we study four liquid crystal systems that show unusual phase behavior or complex structures, deriving from the effects of frustration. Frustration, despite some human prejudices against the word, leaves nature all the more interesting and beautiful.\n\nBoundary conditions and subelliptic estimates for geometric Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators on manifolds with boundaries\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nNier, Francis\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis article is concerned with the maximal accretive realizations of geometric Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators on manifolds with boundaries. A general class of boundary conditions is introduced which ensures the maximal accretivity and some global subelliptic estimates. Those estimates imply nice spectral properties as well as exponential decay properties for the associated semigroup. Admissible boundary conditions cover a wide range of applications for the usual scalar Kramer-Fokker-Planck equation or Bismut's hypoelliptic laplacian.\n\nThe effect of boundaries on the asymptotic wavenumber of spiral wave solutions of the complex GinzburgâLandau equation\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nAguareles, M.\n\n2014-06-01\n\nIn this paper we consider an oscillatory medium whose dynamics are modeled by the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. In particular, we focus on n-armed spiral wave solutions of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in a disk of radius d with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. It is well-known that such solutions exist for small enough values of the twist parameter q and large enough values of d. We investigate the effect of boundaries on the rotational frequency of the spirals, which is an unknown of the problem uniquely determined by the parameters d and q. We show that there is a threshold in the parameter space where the effect of the boundary on the rotational frequency switches from being algebraic to exponentially weak. We use the method of matched asymptotic expansions to obtain explicit expressions for the asymptotic wavenumber as a function of the twist parameter and the domain size for small values of q.

This corresponds to studying the stationary fluid flow past a body. The necessity to truncate for numerical purposes the infinite exterior domain to a finite domain leads to the problem of finding appropriate boundary conditions on the surface of the truncated domain. We solve this problem by providing a vector field describing the leading asymptotic behavior of the solution. This vector field is given in the form of an explicit expression depending on a real parameter. We show that this parameter can be determined from the total drag exerted on the body. Using this fact we set up a self-consistent numerical scheme that determines the parameter, and hence the boundary conditions and the drag, as part of the solution process. We compare the values of the drag obtained with our adaptive scheme with the results from using traditional constant boundary conditions.
