Pat attended Mathnet University at some point before joining Mathnet. Not much is known about any of the Mathnetters' education, but it would seem attending the school was a prerequisite to becoming a mathematician in law enforcement.

Hobbies[]

Pat enjoys costume jewelry design, which nearly lands her in big trouble during the Season 4 episode "The Case of the Galling Stones." She was accused by Hestor Phestor of stealing her dodecahedron bracelet and later, the Bile Emerald from O'Dean Middlemun's jewelry salon. Pat was later cleared of these charges with the help of the Mathnet team and strong evidence proving her innocence.

Relationships[]

Not much is known about Pat's background, but she makes mentions of a couple relatives during the series. In the Season 4 episode "The Case of the Galling Stones," when George asks about a picture he spots in Pat's apartment, she says it's Martin, her brother.

Later, in Season 5's "Case of the Mystery Weekend," while being chased by Peeved the Butler, Pat jokes she has a brother-in-law living in "Carcerated," a little town in New Mexico. Having said this, it would be assumed she also has a sister.
