        "text": "USAToday.com Chat\n\n'Kill Bill, Volume 2': Michael Madsen\n\nFriday, April 9, 12:30 p.m. ET\n\nHe is the ear-slicing Mr. Blonde in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs; the deviant killer in The Getaway with Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin; the Mafia family captain Sonny Black in Donnie Brasco with Al Pacino and Johnny Depp; the over-the-top cop in Mulholland Falls. Yet, Madsen is also the lovable father in Free Willy; Susan Sarandon's supportive, understanding boyfriend in Thelma and Louise; the gentle Virgil Earp opposite Kevin Costner in Wyatt Earp and Halle Berry's CIA boss in Die Another Day.\n\nMadsen reunited with Quentin Tarantino for the first time in over ten years with a small role in Kill Bill, Volume 1 and will star as \"Budd\" (aka Sidewinder) in Tarantino's new film Kill Bill, Volume 2 with Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Darryl Hannah, and Lucy Liu among others, slated for release this spring. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShiprock, NM: Hey Michael, I enjoy your work. My favorite has to be from the Reservoir Dogs. Have you done any films on an independent level? -El Navajo\n\nMichael Madsen: Well, Reservoir Dogs was an independent. And I've done more independent films than I should have. The independent film market seems to have dropped off quite a bit. I'm always looking for good material. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFairway, Kansas: Wow, loved the first volume, any word from you on the second one? Obviously it will be better (It has an ending, not to mention you) but how much better? Are they dramatically different?\n\nMichael Madsen: I went to the premiere of Volume 2 last night in Hollywood and I can't imagine any better reception of any film of any film I've ever been invovled with. Volume 2 is a character driven drama very different from Volume 1, but I'm sure all of your expectations will be met. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpringfield, Va: Hi Michael, just wanted to know: of all the movies that you have starred in, which one is your personal favorite?\n\nMichael Madsen: I've made alot of pictures. I don't know if I can call anyone of them my favorite. There's been a few good ones along the way, however, I think Kill Bill Volume 2 is right at the top of the list. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBentonville, AR: Dear Mr. Madsen, You were there for Quentin Tarantino's standout debut as a director with Resevoir Dogs, and now you are with him on his latest project Kill Bill 1 and 2. Can you tell us how far you think he has come since then?\n\nMichael Madsen: Well, he's come a long way, but he's still the same guy that he always was, he hasn't changed at all, and believe me, that's a good thing. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMadison, WI: How did it feel for you to learn that Quentin was going to cut the movie into two parts and that you were virtually non-existant in the first volume?\n\nMichael Madsen: Well, it started off as a joke. It was suggestion from Miramax. I don't think he wanted to do it in the beginning, but realized it would be a way that would be sure to save all the footage and not have to sacrifice any scenes by putting it all into one picture. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNorthborough, MA: Hey Michael, I enjoy all your films, you are a great actor! I just have a quick question, if you weren't an actor what would you be doing?\n\nMichael Madsen: Well, when I was a kid I used to imagine that I was going to grow up to be like Richard Petty. I guess I'd rather be building and racing cars. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\naugusta, GA: How did you end up with the coolest name in Reservoir Dogs? And was there any joking on set with Steve Buscemi?\n\nMichael Madsen: I got the name from the screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino. It's a big odd because blonde is not really a color, or is it? There was a lot of joking around with all of the guys. It was a fun shoot and everybody got along very well. Or did they? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\npacific, mo: You have historically presented characters that are on the level of ultra-cool. What characters (or, real-life personalities) would you consider as your role models for this the ultra-cool type?\n\nMichael Madsen: Well, I'd have to turn back the pages of time and consider Humphrey Bogart, Robert Mitchum and Steve McQueen. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComment from Michael Madsen: Those sorts of actors aren't really around anymore. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEvanston, Illinois: Hey Michael, Evanston's proud of you and your success. Where does your inspiration for a character come from - research, past experiences or your imagination?\n\nMichael Madsen: Well, I suppose half of it comes from my nefarious childhood and the other half is the material itself. And I can only be as good as the other actors that I'm surrounded by. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChicago IL: You seem to be an actor that can play a wide range of ethnicities. What is your actual ethnic background and where did you grow up?\n\nMichael Madsen: My ethnic background is Irish, Danish and American Indian and I grew up in Chicago. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAustin, Texas: Have Tarrantino, Travolta and you visited at all about the possibility of ever getting The Vega Brothers film off the ground?\n\nMichael Madsen: I think there's a very good chance of that. I know that Quentin is very keen on writing the screenplay. We're all looking forward to that day. I've wanted to make that picture for a long time and I think it might be closer to becoming a reality. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMIami Fl: What is harder for you to play? THe tough guy or the nice guy.\n\nMichael Madsen: I'd much prefer to be the guy who rides over the hill into the sunset after saving the townspeople, but unfortunately, at this point and time, I don't think I'm looked at that way by Hollywood. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew York, NY: I love your acting and it's soo good to see you back on the big screen. What do you have lined up next?\n\nMichael Madsen: Nothing at the moment. I might be doing Sin City with Robert Rodriguez and I have a western coming out that I did in Mexico called Blueberry. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSilver Spring, MD: First of all, I wan to say that you are one of the best actors. Besides your movies, I enjoy listening to your voice on Animal Precinct. I want to know if you continue to narrate on the show and if you love animal. Thank you. Mutsy\n\nMichael Madsen: I've just been signed for a fourth year of Animal Precinct. I do like doing the show very much and I am an animal lover. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNorthborough, MA: What do you consider to be your greatest achievment?\n\nMichael Madsen: Oh my God. Successfully raising my five sons. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComment from USATODAY.com Host: That's all the time Michael has today. Thanks for joining us."
