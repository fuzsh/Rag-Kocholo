        "text": "The Hollywood star was staying at the Dorchester when there was a commotion in his room. Screaming and shouting was heard and another guest complained.\n\nHotel staff called police but the 49-year-old actor was not arrested. He was suffering from cuts and bruises and an ambulance was called.\n\nThe American actor had checked into the hotel at the weekend along with people believed to be his family.\n\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said no arrests were made following an incident at the Dorchester and no further action would be taken.\n\nMadsen, 49, is famous for his tough guy roles and made his name as Mr Blonde, a psychopath who tortures a policeman in Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs.\n\nHe has also starred in hit films including Thelma and Louise and Die Another Day.\n\nHe was in London making The Big I Am and finished filming last week.\n\nThe father of five has been been married to Deanna Morgan since 1996."
