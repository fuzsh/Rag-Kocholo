        "text": "Most movie fans remember Michael Madsen with a gasoline can in one hand and a Zippo lighter in the other, dancing around a kidnapped cop who is helplessly bound to a chair while a portable radio plays \"Stuck in the Middle With You.\"\n\nThis is right after Madsen's character has lopped off the lawman's ear with a straight razor.\n\nThat old Stealers Wheel hit is now an instant reminder of that grueling scene from \"Reservoir Dogs\" and the casually sadistic \"Mr. Blonde,\" who was voted the second-greatest screen villain of all time in a Maxim Magazine readers poll.\n\nMadsen has writer-director Quentin Tarantino to thank for being typecast as a tough guy often a really bad tough guy ever since.\n\nNow the actor and director have reteamed for \"Kill Bill Vol. 2,\" and Madsen is Budd code name \"Sidewinder\" one of the more cold-blooded members of a killer elite called the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.\n\n\"You know, I'm hopin' to get rid of that (Mr. Blonde) tag,\" Madsen said in his familiar raspy baritone during a telephone interview with The Oklahoman. \"I'm hoping people call me Budd from now on. I've had 'Mr. Blonde' around for quite a few years, and I think I finally surpassed it, thanks to Quentin.\"\n\nMadsen was seen only briefly in \"Kill Bill Vol. 1,\" when the Deadly Vipers massacred an entire wedding party just to get to one of their own colleagues, \"The Bride,\" aka \"Black Mamba\" (Uma Thurman), who had gone absent without leave to marry into the law-abiding world. By the end of the first installment, the vengeful Bride, recovered from her wounds and awakened from a four-year coma, had tracked down and dispatched two of her former co-workers, with three to go in \"Vol. 2\" the eye-patch-wearing \"California Mountain Snake\" (Daryl Hannah), cold-hearted former lover and boss Bill (David Carradine), and perhaps the meanest and most formidable of all, Budd the Sidewinder.\n\nMeaner than Mr. Blonde?\n\n\"Well, I think Budd may be able to take on Mr. Blonde, but it would certainly be an interesting battle,\" Madsen said. \"Good Lord, you imagine those two?\"\n\nThe Chicago-born actor, 45, has played plenty of gentler roles, such as Susan Sarandon's supportive boyfriend in \"Thelma and Louise\" (1991) and the lovable dad in \"Free Willy\" (1993), which probably was closer than any to the real Madsen, father of five boys ranging in age from 6 to 16.\n\nBut out of all his films, it's the hard-edged hoods such as his Mafia capo in \"Donnie Brasco\" (1997), the murderous thief in \"Kill Me Again\" (1989), and, of course, the ear-slicing sadist in \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1991) for which he'll be remembered. And Madsen has just about had it with bad.\n\n\"I'd much rather be the guy who rides off into the sunset,\" he said. \"I would much rather be the guy who saves the town from the bad guys, and I'd much rather be the guy who gets the girl in the end and, believe me, I really, honestly think that I've been overlooked for a lot of stuff that I would have liked to have done. So I'm thinking I'm not going to pursue any tough-guy roles in the future. I'm going to focus on convincing somebody to let me play something a little different.\"\n\nAfter all, Madsen has his soft, cerebral side, which has produced four volumes of poetry and short stories, including \"Beer, Blood and Ashes,\" \"Eat the Worm,\" \"Blessing of the Hounds\" and \"Burning in Paradise,\" which won the Independent Book Publishers' Firecracker Poetry Book of the Year in 2001.\n\nThe latter book is described on www.Michael Madsen.com as \"a book of poetry that explores the intense and gritty experiences of a man living on the edge.\"\n\nMadsen, who grew up in a close-knit family environment with two siblings, including actress Virginia Madsen, admits to having been a trouble-prone, rebellious teen and fun-loving young adult who liked to walk on the wild side much like the rougher characters he's played on screen.\n\n\"For some reason, I always happened to be in with the wrong crowd, and I always seemed to be in some sort of mischief one way or another, but, you know, I was properly punished for the things I did wrong, and I realized that I had to change my attitude a little bit, so I worked a lot of different odd jobs in many, many places,\" Madsen said.\n\nSome of those vocations included house painter, auto mechanic, hospital orderly and gas pump jockey, before he finally caught the acting flu at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater and made his way to Hollywood to try his luck in films.\n\nNow on his third marriage, to De Anna Morgan, Madsen says fatherhood finally forced him to grow up.\n\n\"I landed on Earth, and I'm living out in Malibu with my boys, and I'm just trying to stay employed and keep a roof over everybody's head,\" Madsen said. \"It was probably around the time my third son was born. I got remarried and right around the time I was doing 'Donnie Brasco,' things kinda started to make a lot more sense to me.\"\n\nThe actor's parental philosophy is anything but tough.\n\n\"I would prefer my sons listen to me because they love and respect me, not because they fear me. ... You know, in my generation, my dad's generation, kids grew up with fear, and I just don't think that's the way to do it. So I'm just trying to keep them all on the straight and narrow, keep their lives together and encourage them in every way I can. I think boys, especially, need acceptance from their fathers to get anywhere in life.\"\n\nBut while his sons have no fear of him, they're still proud that he was named the second-greatest movie bad guy of all time. In fact, Madsen learned the news when his excited 13-year-old son brought him a copy of the magazine that had bestowed that honor on him.\n\n\"The funny thing about that was, I hadn't seen the magazine, so I said, 'Well, who's No. 1?' And he goes, 'Wow, it's this movie, \"Deliverance.\"'\n\n\"And I suddenly knew who he was talking about.\"\n\nThe No. 1 villain was Bill McKinney, as the hillbilly who sexually assaults Ned Beatty's character in the thriller about city slickers finding more than they bargained for on a wilderness canoe trip.\n\n\"The next question was obvious,\" Madsen said. \"My son says, 'Well, Dad, what did that guy do in that movie that he could be voted above you?' And I said, 'We-e-e-ll ... How old are you again?' He said, 'Dad, I'm 13.' I said, 'Well, son, uh, he did some really bad things. He was a really bad guy.' And he said, 'What did he do? Can we rent the movie?' And I said, 'Well, son, I don't know how to describe it to you in any kind of way that I could ... Son, I'll talk to you about it later. I'll tell you about it later. He was a really bad guy. He deserved No. 1.\"\n\nThe conclusion of that conversation, Madsen said, is still pending.\n\nArchive ID: 1811537"
