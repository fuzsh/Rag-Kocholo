        "text": "“Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with Samurai swords.”\n\nThere is no better way to appreciate the Hattori Honzo level of precision greatness in Quentin Tarantino‘s KILL BILL 1 & 2 than seeing them back-to-back, and on our big screen. The films reunite Tarantino with actress, muse, and co-writer Uma Thurman, whose soaring performance as a back-from-the-dead Bride hell-bent on revenge marks an all-time career high. In addition to a predctably killer soundtrack, fantastic one-liners and some of the most ornately stylized martial arts sequences in recent memory, Tarantino assembled an all-star roster of supporting actors including Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, David Carradine, Michael Madsen, and Vivica A. Fox.\n\nKILL BILL: Volume 1\n\nDoors 7:45 pm | Movie 8:15 pm *Start time subject to change. Please arrive on time.\n\nSingle film tickets HERE\n\n(Break)\n\nKILL BILL: Volume 2\n\nMovie 10:20 pm *As this is a double bill, this is an approximate start time.\n\nSingle film tickets HERE\n\nWhy not make it a KILL BILL DOUBLE BILL one sweet price HERE\n\nKILL BILL: Volume 1 (Quentin Tarantino, 2003 / 111 minutes / 18A) | An entire wedding party is slaughtered during a dress rehearsal in a rural chapel: the pregnant woman in the blood-splattered wedding dress is Black Mamba, better known as The Bride. The assassin, Bill, and his circle known as The Vipers left The Bride for dead, but unluckily for them she was merely comatose. Four years later, The Bride suddenly awakens from her coma and realizes what has been done to her. She sets off on a ferociously focused mission, setting out to seek revenge on her former master and his deadly squad of assassins. One by one, she kills the various members of the assassin group. She saves Bill for last.\n\nKILL BILL: Volume 2 (Quentin Tarantino, 2004 / 137 minutes / 18A) | The Bride picks up where she left off in volume one with her quest to finish the hit list she has composed of all of the people who have wronged her, including ex-boyfriend Bill, who tried to have her killed four years ago during her wedding to another man. Leaving several dead in her wake, she eventually tracks down Bill in Mexico. Using skills she has learned during her assassin career, she attempts to finish what she set out to do in the first place.\n\n*Minors OK.
