        "text": "Kill Bill: Volume 2\n\nBeware Budd, Elle and Bill… she’s coming to kill you! You’ve seen her betrayed, you’ve seen her seek revenge, but you’ve only see half the picture. Prepare for VOLUME 2 of Tarantino’s Kill Bill epic.\n\n“4 Stars. Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is an exuberant celebration of moviemaking, coasting with heedless joy from one audacious chapter to another, working as irony, working as satire, working as drama, working as pure action. I liked it even more than Vol. 1.” – Roger Ebert"
