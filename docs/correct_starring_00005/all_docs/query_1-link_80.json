        "text": "Volume 1\n\nVolume 1 (2003): is an American martial arts film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. It stars Uma Thurman as the Bride, who swears revenge on a team of assassins (Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and Vivica A. Fox) and their leader, Bill (David Carradine), after they try to kill her. Her journey takes her to Tokyo, where she battles the yakuza.\n\nVolume 2\n\nVolume 2(2004): is the second of two Kill Bill films produced simultaneously; the first, Volume 1, was released six months earlier. They were originally set for a single release, but the film, with a runtime of over four hours, was divided in two. Tarantino conceived Kill Bill as an homage to grindhouse cinema including martial arts films, samurai cinema, blaxploitation, and spaghetti westerns. Like its predecessor, Volume 2 received positive reviews. It grossed $152.2 million worldwide on a production budget of $30 million.\n\nVolume 3 ???\n\nVolume 3 (TBC) : Kill Bill: Vol 3 is on Quentin Tarantino's to-do list, but it has yet to happen.Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino has been toying with the idea of filming a third edition of the renowned Kill Bill series for years.\n\nYou must be 18 or older to sign up for Kill Bill content"
