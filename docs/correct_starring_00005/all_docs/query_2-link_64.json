        "text": "It's hard to ignore the box-office popularity of Quentin Tarantino's latest movies, “Kill Bill: Vol. I” and the newly released sequel. Their success is a major coup for Miramax CEO Harvey Weinstein, who backed them financially, and could pave the way for Weinstein to have an expanded role in the troubled moviemaking operations of Miramax parent Walt Disney. Given how many young American viewers and film buffs worldwide have flipped for the “Bills”, it's pretty unhip not to like these movies.\n\nAnd yet, I hate them — both of them — even after seeing them several times. I'm bothered by something Tarantino's admirers try to minimize: the sadistic violence. The director likes to say his technique is to leave out all the dull moments and focus his plots on the intense stuff people really want to see.\n\nThat worked with “Pulp Fiction,” Tarantino's first big hit, which I loved. But with his latest movies, the director makes virtually every scene a pretext for humiliating, brutalizing, or murdering his characters. He's like a creepy kid torturing insects with a magnifying glass. And coming at a time when Americans are being bombarded by real images of U.S. servicemen and women humiliating and torturing Iraqis, that leaves me feeling very uneasy.\n\nSampling carnage\n\nBlood and guts, obviously, are longtime Hollywood staples. In “Reservoir Dogs,” his 1992 directorial debut, Tarantino set out to make a slick Hollywood movie with torture as one of its core themes. Torture also figured in the hugely successful 1994 “Pulp Fiction” — the rape scene involving the druglord Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), for example. And certainly, torture is featured in other recent Hollywood blockbusters, notably Mel Gibson's controversial “The Passion of the Christ.”\n\nIn “Kill Bill,” however, Tarantino ups the ante to new heights. The gore and humiliation are taken out of any emotional context. The movies pretend to borrow their moral code mainly from Asian martial-arts movies, but those movies make reference to real history, and real rituals of honor and discipline. Here, the action is all synthetic. It's almost as if Tarantino is sampling violent scenes from other movies in the way a hip-hop artist samples snippets of recorded music — except that these snippets involve things like a woman having the top of her scull sheared off by a sword.\n\nPredictably, all the mayhem hasn't hurt sales. “Kill Bill: Vol. I” has grossed more than $180 million in ticket sales worldwide, and Miramax predicts that DVD sales will total $90 million to $100 million. “Kill Bill: Vol. II” grossed $60 million worldwide in its first two weeks, and it seems likely to at least rival the first installment's numbers. That means the two combined will probably take in 10 times the $55 million Tarantino spent making them.\n\nMayhem with a purpose\n\nThe movies especially appeal to one of the most lucrative demographics in marketing — young men. Miramax says 60 percent of the viewers are 18 to 34 and male (the movies are rated R, so those under 18 can't get in without their parents). And stylized violence (like sex) sells well everywhere: A phenomenal 60 percent, or $110 million, of “Kill Bill I's” box office was generated outside North America.\n\nSo why can't I stand these movies? At least in “Pulp Fiction,” the mayhem had a purpose, creating a fictional portrait of the underbelly of Southern California society. The basic message of the movie was that lurking beneath social norms lies a violent and exploitative mirror image.\n\nA man can wander into a pawn shop, for instance, and wind up being beaten and raped by a pair of sadists who keep a groveling hooded man in a trunk in the basement. A suburban dad can be lounging around in his bath robe one morning waiting for his wife to get home from her nightshift job when a pair of men show up in a blood-spattered car looking for help disposing of the freshly murdered man in the back seat.\n\nBible-spouting killer\n\nSure, it's not very realistic, but it's disturbing because of the many ways it takes the norms of everyday life and turns them upside down. In “Pulp Fiction,” the gangsters, sadists, and pimps listen to the same music, dance the same dances, and eat the same junk food we all do. They tell the same jokes, make similar small talk in idle moments, and even have moments of sensitivity and understanding."
