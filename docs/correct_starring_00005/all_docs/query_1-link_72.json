        "text": "AN ARREST warrant issued for an actor, known for sadistic roles in Quentin Tarantino's revered films Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill.\n\nMichael Madsen, regarded fondly as one of Hollywood's greatest heavies, allegedly owes around $570,000 in child and spousal support debts, web site TMZ reports.\n\nAccording to court documents, 53-year-old Madsen failed to show up for a hearing in his child/spousal support case last week and the judge found him in contempt and issued a warrant for his arrest.\n\nIf police catch up with Madsen it will cost him. His bail has already been set at $26,000.\n\nMadsen, also known for his role as Sonny Black in Mike Newell's Oscar-nominated film Donnie Brasco, also starring Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, has just signed on, along with former model Rachel Hunter, to star in the Roger Corman-produced, Jim Wynorski-directed sci-fi film Piranhaconda.\n\nHe has been married three times - to actress Georganne LaPiere, the half-sister of Cher; Jeannine Bisignano (with whom he has two sons), and since 1996 to Deanna Morgan, who was previously married to musician Brian Setzer of Stray Cats fame."
