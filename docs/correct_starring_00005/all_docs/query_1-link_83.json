        "text": "[quote]what do you think of the rest of the cast? we dont need to open a topic for every actor in it…\n\ni think QT should’ve cast another superstar actor like Robin Williams for a cameo, a cool think like casting John Woo for a Barkeeper role or casting Denise Richards as a street-whore or something.\n\nIt would be awesome to see all roles filled with stars… dont you think?[/quote]\n\nRobin Williams? Denise Richards? We’re getting wayyyyyyy off track here. QTs never gonna pick the most popular current stars to be in his films. At least not for awhile. The cool thing about QT is that he picks underused actors, forgotten actors and puts them into a part that shows their best qualities and how damn cool they can be.\n\nUma Thurman … The Bride (a.k.a. Black Mamba)\n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â I can see her doing this. She’s got this tall lanky body with big feet(like Kareem in Game of Death) and a real cool sarcastic nature. She’s not too pretty, but that perfect for a “princess of blood” role like this.\n\nDavid Carradine … Bill\n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Why not? I always hated the fact that he got Bruce Lee’s role in The Kung-Fu Master, but this is one classy man. Deathrace 2000 has been one of my favorite movies ever, and now I’m wondering if Carradine played “the Gimp” in Pulp Fiction.\n\nMichael Madsen … Budd (a.k.a. Sidewinder)\n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â He is perfect for this role. Going from leather clad leader of the D.iV.A.s to loser drunk who died stupidly is his thing in my eyes. Ã‚Â Too bad tho, cause I wanted to see him do some kinda swordfighting.\n\nSonny Chiba … Hattori Hanzo\n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â QT knows what the fuck is up. I was just watching the Storm Riders again, man this guy is the shit, as long as he’s got some hair on his face. I don’y really like his Streetfighter movies much cause I think he looks weird all clean-shaven , but he definately knows how to fight. Ã‚Â\n\nJulie Dreyfus … Sofie Fatale\n\nÃ‚Â I know kothing about this chick, except that she is one hella sexy brunette. She makes me horny.\n\nVivica A. Fox … Vernita Green (a.k.a. Cobra)\n\nÃ‚Â Viv was in this movie called Idle Hands playing a demon killer, and I love her man! I know she can do the mommy thing(ID4) but it’s the fighting thing that will have me in it for this movie. Did I mention that I truly, deeply, love her?\n\nDaryl Hannah … Elle Driver (a.k.a. California Mountain Snake)\n\nÃ‚Â Pris from Bladerunner, the best Cyberpunk movie of all time. Seeing her & Uma fight to the death will be sweet, I just hope that she doesn’t play the whiny, unsure of herself blond type of roles like she’s been doing lately, she better get back in her BR character for this role.\n\nChiaki Kuriyama … Go Go Yubari\n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â I know nothing about her either, japanese schoolgirl outfit is dead sexy.\n\nChia Hui Liu … Pai Mei (as Gordon Liu)\n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â The Master Killer, reissued by Wu-Tang fims. Sweet! Still, what’s this rumor that Quentin will play this role instead. Will he be convincing doing the ten point palm exploding heart technique or punching holes in wood from 3 inches away while wearing a white wig & beard?\n\nLucy Liu … O-Ren Ishi (a.k.a. Cottonmouth)\n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Sexy & sassy, between this role & Kelly Hu playing Lady Deathstryke in X-Men2, it’s going to be hard deciding which one I like better. QT is a fuckin’ genius for choosing her. She rocked in Charlie’s Angels.\n\nLaTanya Richardson … L.F. O’Boyle\n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â I’ve never seen Samuel L. Jackson’s wife before. Her role must be small in this movie, and she is not, not pretty. Her being in this justs boosts the rumor that her husband will play a dead pianist.\n\nBo Svenson … Reverend Harmony\n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Looks like a redneck preacher.\n\nMichael Jai White … Alburt\n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â This guy is not getting picked enough for good roles, y’know. I’ve seen practically everything he’s been in, Ã‚Â but he could be the new Wesley Snipes if he didn’t smile so much. Very, very cool cat is he.\n\nI likes this cast!"
