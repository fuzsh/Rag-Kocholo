        "text": "American actor\n\nFor other people named Michael Madsen, see Michael Madsen (disambiguation).\n\nMichael Madsen (born September 25, 1958)[1] is an American actor. Alongside his frequent collaborations with Quentin Tarantino—Reservoir Dogs (1992), Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004), The Hateful Eight (2015), and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019)—he is known for his appearances in films such as The Natural (1984), The Doors (1991), Thelma & Louise (1991), Free Willy (1993), Species (1995), Donnie Brasco (1997), Die Another Day (2002), Sin City (2005), and Scary Movie 4 (2006). He has played voice roles in various video games, including Grand Theft Auto III (2001), Narc (2005), the Dishonored series (2012–2017), and Crime Boss: Rockay City (2023). Madsen has five children, including actor Christian Madsen.\n\nMadsen was born on September 25, 1958, in Chicago, Illinois. His mother, Elaine (née Melson), was a filmmaker and author. His father, Calvin Christian Madsen, was a World War II Navy veteran and a firefighter with the Chicago Fire Department.[2] His parents divorced in the 1960s, and his mother left the financial world to pursue a career in the arts, encouraged by film critic Roger Ebert. His siblings are Cheryl Madsen, an entrepreneur, and Academy Award nominee Virginia Madsen.[3] Madsen's paternal grandparents were Danish, while his mother is Irish and Native American.[4]\n\nMadsen began working at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, where he served as an apprentice under John Malkovich and appeared in a production of Of Mice and Men.[5]\n\nHis first notable film role was a small part for the science fiction film, WarGames. He appeared in John Dahl’s thriller Kill Me Again as criminal Vince Miller opposite Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley.[6] In Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut film Reservoir Dogs, Madsen played \"Mr. Blonde\", a cruel criminal. Steve Buscemi received the role of \"Mr. Pink\", which Madsen wanted because it had more scenes with Harvey Keitel.[5] For Pulp Fiction, Madsen declined the role of Vincent Vega, which went to John Travolta. Madsen starred in the crime film Donnie Brasco. He once said of these films: \"Some of them I'm only in for 10 minutes, but they bought my name, and they bought my face to put on the DVD box with a gun. What people don't always understand is that I established a certain lifestyle for my family back in the days of Species and Mulholland Falls and The Getaway. I wasn't about to move my six kids into a trailer park. So when people offered me work, it wasn't always the best, but I had to buy groceries and I had to put gas in the car.\"[5]\n\nMadsen played assassin Budd, the brother of Bill (David Carradine), in Kill Bill: Volume 2.[7] In 2004, Tarantino discussed an idea for the film to unite Madsen and Travolta, as The Vega Brothers.[8] In 2007, Tarantino said the film (which he intended to call Double V Vega) was \"kind of unlikely now\", because of the age of the actors and the onscreen deaths of both characters.[9]\n\nMadsen appeared in Uwe Boll's BloodRayne, a film he described as \"an abomination... It's a horrifying and preposterous movie.\"[10] He won Best Actor awards at the Boston Film Festival and New York International Independent Film and Video Festival for his performance in Strength and Honour. He played himself in the mockumentary Being Michael Madsen. Madsen co-starred in Coma, a Web series on Crackle.[11]\n\nHe played Jim Ricker, the old friend of Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), in the eighth season of 24.[12] Madsen starred in the comedy film Let the Game Begin. On January 5, 2012, he entered the Celebrity Big Brother house, where he finished in 4th place in the final.\n\nIn February 2014, he played Las Vegas casino mogul Ted Binion in Josh Evans' film Death in the Desert.[13] The screenplay was written by John Steppling, based on the book Death in the Desert by crime writer Cathy Scott.[14]\n\nIn August 2014, he starred in the Kill Bill-themed music video for the song \"Black Widow\" by Iggy Azalea featuring Rita Ora.\n\nMadsen starred in the ensemble western film The Hateful Eight. He was among a number of people rumored to have leaked the film's script before it was released, causing Tarantino to almost not make the film and eventually rewrite it. It was later revealed Madsen was not responsible for leaking the script.[15] In 2016, he played a dramatized role of former Texas Ranger Phil Ryan in Real Detective on the Investigation Discovery network.[16]\n\nHe executive produced in Vilan Trub's crime drama film The Dirty Kind, which is loosely inspired by Anthony Weiner.[17]\n\nMadsen's first wife was Georganne LaPiere, half-sister of singer and actress Cher. They met in 1983, married in 1984, and divorced in 1988.[18]\n\nHe has a daughter named Jessica with Dana Mechling. Jessica was born March 24, 1979.\n\nHe was married to Jeannine Bisignano from 1991 to 1995. They have two sons, Christian and Max, who are both actors.[19]\n\nIn 1996, he married DeAnna Morgan. The couple married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica while Madsen was on a break from shooting Donnie Brasco.[20] Together they had three sons, Luke, Kalvin and Hudson. Hudson died by suicide in January 2022.[19]\n\nMadsen has a line of hot sauces called American Badass.[21]\n\nMadsen received the award for his work with the Shriners Hospital for Children in 2002.[22]\n\nIn September 2009, Madsen announced his participation in the 26th annual Love Ride to help raise money for local charities.[23] The charity included celebrities Malcolm Forbes, Peter Fonda, Larry Hagman, Billy Idol and Bruce Springsteen, among others. The event was scheduled for October 25, 2009, but was ultimately canceled due to poor ticket sales and a decline in sponsorship.\n\nMadsen hosted the event An Intimate Evening with Michael Madsen to benefit Children's Pediatric Cancer in 2016.\n\nLifetime Achievement Award at Red Hen Press in 2006.\n\n9th Annual Malibu International Film Festival honored Madsen in April 2008 for his Achievements in the Art of Acting[24]\n\n1999 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for his book of poetry Burning In Paradise.[25]\n\n2007 Best Actor Boston Film Festival for Strength and Honour\n\n2008 Best Actor New York International Independent Film & Video Festival for Strength and Honour.\n\nMadsen won Ensemble of the Year for The Hateful Eight at the Hollywood Film Awards.\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1982 Against All Hope Cecil Moe 1983 Special Bulletin Jimmy Lenox TV movie WarGames Lieutenant Steve Phelps 1984 Racing with the Moon Frank The Natural Bartholomew \"Bump\" Bailey 1987 The Killing Time Stu 1988 Iguana Sebastián Shadows in the Storm Earl 1989 Blood Red Enzio Kill Me Again Vince Miller 1990 Montana Pierce TV movie The End of Innocence Earl 1991 The Doors Tom Baker Thelma & Louise Jimmy Lennox 1992 Reservoir Dogs Vic Vega/Mr. Blonde Straight Talk Steve Baby Snatcher Cal Hudson TV movie Fatal Instinct Cliff Burden Inside Edge Richard Montana 1993 Trouble Bound Harry Talbot Beyond the Law \"Blood\" TV movie Free Willy Glen Greenwood Money for Nothing Detective Pat Laurenzi A House in the Hills Mickey 1994 The Getaway Rudy Travis Blue Tiger Gun Salesman Season of Change Randy Parker Final Combination Detective Matt Dickson Wyatt Earp Virgil Earp Felidae Bluebeard (voice) 1995 Species Preston \"Press\" Lennox Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home Glen Greenwood Man with a Gun John Wilbur Hardin 1996 Almost Blue Morris Poole Mulholland Falls Detective Eddie Hall The Winner Wolf The Last Days of Frankie the Fly Sal Red Line Mr. Lawrence Video 1997 Donnie Brasco Dominick \"Sonny Black\" Napolitano The Maker Skarney The Girl Gets Moe Donnelly Executive Target Nick James Catherine's Grove Joe Mason 1998 Rough Draft Haynes Papertrail Brad Abraham The Sender Dallas Grayson Surface to Air Gunnery Sergeant Zach Massin Species II Preston \"Press\" Lennox Detour Burl Rogers Video Fait Accompli Frank Barlow 1999 Supreme Sanction Dalton TV movie The Florentine \"Whitey\" Ballad of the Nightingale Giovanni Flat Out Gene 2000 The Stray Ben The Inspectors 2: A Shred of Evidence Joe TV movie Luck of the Draw Zippo The Alternate Agent Jack Briggs Sacrifice Tyler Pierce TV movie High Noon Frank Miller TV movie The Price of Air Mr. Ball The Thief & the Stripper Jimmie D.
