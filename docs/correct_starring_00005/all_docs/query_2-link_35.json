I didn’t want to get shot by Tim Roth. I didn’t want to be killed by Tim Roth.”\n\nHe continues, “I was like, ‘Hey man, who is Tim Roth?’ I would let Harvey Keitel kill me, but I’m not getting killed by Tim Roth.”\n\n30 greatest Tarantino characters\n\nShow all 30\n\nAt the time of production, Roth was a newcomer to the American film industry with few acting credits outside his native UK. Madsen, meanwhile, had appeared in films including Thelma & Louise, The Natural and WarGames.\n\nBoth actors have gone on to reappear in a number of Tarantino projects. Madsen starred in Kill Bill and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, while Roth appeared in Pulp Fiction and Four Rooms. The pair also reunited in Tarantino’s 2015 film The Hateful Eight.\n\nQT8: The First Eight explores the making of Tarantino’s first eight films, with appearances from collaborators including Roth, Samuel L Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Lucy Liu, Christoph Waltz and the late Robert Forster. It will be released in the UK on 13 December.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
