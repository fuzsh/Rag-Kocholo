        "text": "Die Another Day\n\nImagine, if you will, the dispiriting experience of listening to an awful cover of one of your favorite songs. That's how I felt sitting through Die Another Day, the 20th official outing for Ian Fleming's super-spy. This is a train wreck of an ac...\n\nDonnie Brasco\n\nAl Pacino in a Mafia movie feels as natural as peanut butter with jelly. Mike Newell, the director of such popular British comedies as Enchanted April and Four Weddings and a Funeral, is another matter altogether. When you think of a director...\n\nFree Willy\n\nTraditionally, Man's best friend is supposed to be his dog. Sometimes, even a cat. But rarely is the love and affection of a boy won over by a killer whale. Such is the case in Free Willy, however, where young Jesse's unusual relationship with...\n\nHateful Eight, The\n\nThe credits for The Hateful Eight proudly proclaim this to be the “Eighth Film” from writer/director Quentin Tarantino. Since catching the movie world unawares with his powerhouse debut, Reservoir Dogs, some 23 years ago, he has worked on...\n\nHell Ride\n\nHell Ride is pretty much what a viewer would expect from a movie of that name.

So what do they get for their patience? An incomplete movie, artlessly cleft in the middle. Cinema interruptus. A film whose ed...\n\nKill Bill (Volume 2)\n\nTwo things are readily apparent about Kill Bill Volume 2. First, unlike its predecessor, this is a complete movie. It stands on its own. It is possible to see and enjoy Volume 2 in a way that was not true of Volume 1. Viewed in retrospect, the ...\n\nMulholland Falls\n\nFollowing several release delays, Mulholland Falls has finally reached theaters. Usually, when a distributor keeps putting off a film's opening, it's a sign that there's something wrong with the production, and, about halfway through Mulholland Fa...\n\nReservoir Dogs\n\nReservoir Dogs grabs you by the throat and digs its claws in deep. From the moment that the unwitting viewer tumbles into the realm of Lawrence Tierney's gang of eight, they are hopelessly trapped there until the final credits roll. As the first ..."
