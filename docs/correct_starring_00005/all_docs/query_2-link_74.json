        "text": "“Kill Bill Vol. 2” is Quentin Tarantino’s love letter to kung-fu, Westerns, and all things stylish and violent. The film follows the mysterious Bride as she sets out to take revenge on the assassination squad she used to be part of for attempting to kill her on her wedding day.\n\nCelebrating its 15th anniversary this year, there’s no better time for a rewatch. The movie is classic Tarantino, and as such, is loaded with trivia and easter eggs for the more keen-eyed viewers in the audience. Here are 10 pieces of mind-blowing trivia you might have missed the first time around.\n\n10. Samuel L. Jackson has a cameo\n\nSamuel L. Jackson and Quentin Tarantino are known for their frequent collaborations. The pair first worked together in “Pulp Fiction,” and since then, Jackson has appeared in six of Tarantino’s movies. Jackson also has a role in “Kill Bill Vol. 2,” but it’s easy to miss. Jackson only appears in silhouette as the church organ player Rufus, and has a few lines of dialogue near the start of the film. Though we never actually see his face, the voice is unmistakably Jackson’s.\n\n9. Ricardo Montalban was originally tapped for a role\n\nThe character of Esteban Vihaio plays an important role later in the film. As a brothel owner and gang leader, Esteban acted as a father figure for Bill as he was growing up. Calm, cool, and sophisticated, Vihaio was originally slated to be played by iconic Hispanic actor Ricardo Montalban. Montalban wasn’t able to make the film’s table read due to a conflict, so actor Michael Parks filled in to read for the role. Unfortunately for Montalban, Tarantino was so impressed by Parks that he gave the role to him instead.\n\n8. Michael Jai White featured in a deleted fight sequence\n\nActor and martial artist Michael Jai White was another actor due to play a part that didn’t make the final cut. White played a well-trained fighter who ambushed Bill and Beatrix in China, intending to exact vengeance on Bill for killing his master. The entire fight sequence was shot and edited, but was cut from the final film due to pacing concerns. The deleted sequence was instead included as part of the movie’s DVD release.\n\n7. Budd’s trailer contains a hidden ‘Reservoir Dogs’ reference\n\nLike Samuel L.Jackson, actor Michael Madsen is another frequent Tarantino collaborator. In “Kill Bill,” Madsen takes on the role of Budd, Bill’s brother and fellow hitman. “Kill Bill Vol. 2” includes a hidden reference to one of Madsen’s most famous Tarantino roles: that of the sadistic Mr. Blonde in “Reservoir Dogs.” In the film, Madsen’s character tortures a captured police officer before dousing him in gasoline. When the Bride arrives at Budd’s trailer in “Kill Bill,” the same gas can from “Reservoir Dogs” can be glimpsed in the background.\n\n6. Daryl Hannah and Uma Thurman had a real-life rivalry\n\nElle Driver and Beatrix Kiddo share a bitter rivalry as members of The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and the two nearly kill each other on several occasions throughout the films. Unfortunately, that feud apparently extended off-camera as well. Daryl Hannah and Uma Thurman were reportedly so at odds with each other that they had to be separated between takes, and requested to be kept apart on set as well.\n\n5. The movie was scored for $1\n\nDirector Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are personal friends as well as colleagues, and the two frequently work together. Tarantino has made cameo appearances in several Rodriguez movies, and Rodriguez has also contributed to Tarantino’s films, as well. When Tarantino wanted to use some of Rodriguez’s songs on the film’s soundtrack, Rodriguez agreed to sell Tarantino the rights to use the songs for the low price of $1. In exchange, Tarantino agreed to direct a scene for Rodriguez’s movie “Sin City.” Tarantino’s asking price for his directing skill? A mere $1.\n\n4. Daryl Hannah owns her car from the movie\n\nElle Driver rides in style. In several scenes, she’s seen behind the wheel of a stunning 1980 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. After filming was complete, actress Daryl Hannah kept the car, but made one major modification after bringing it home. A lifelong environmental advocate, Hannah converted the classic muscle car to an all-electric vehicle.\n\n3. There’s a hidden reference to a ‘Django Unchained’ character\n\nWay before the Marvel Cinematic Universe hit the scene, Quentin Tarantino was including sneaky references in his movies that hinted that they were all set in the same universe. “Kill Bill” is no exception to that rule.\n\nMidway through the film, The Bride is ambushed by Budd, who attempts to get her out of the way by nailing her into a coffin and burying her alive. The grave he chooses as her final resting place is that of one Paula Schultz. Though the movie didn’t come out until several years later, a popular fan theory holds that this is actually a reference to “Django Unchained.” In the movie, Christoph Waltz plays Dr. King Schultz, an eccentric bounty hunter. Though it’s never stated explicitly, it’s hinted that Schultz became a bounty hunter after leaving his wife. The dates and the name all seem to hint that the mysterious Paula Schultz is King’s former spouse.\n\n2. A deleted scene would have featured Gogo Yubari’s sister\n\nThe sadistic schoolgirl Gogo Yubari was an iconic part of “Kill Bill Vol. 1.” The flail-wielding gang member met a violent end at the hands of The Bride; but Tarantino didn’t intend for that to be the end of Gogo’s story. Originally, Vol. 2 would have included a chapter where Gogo’s sister tracked down and fought The Bride to take her revenge, nearly killing her in the process. Like several other scenes cut from the final film, this chapter was removed due to concerns about the film’s length.\n\n1. Quentin Tarantino was originally going to voice Pai Mei\n\nWise master Pai Mei is an expert in martial arts of all kinds, and features heavily in a training sequence with The Bride. As an homage to the kung-fu B movies that the movie takes inspiration from, Tarantino originally intended to voice an intentionally awful English dub of the character, complete with mistranslations and cheesy, unsynced lip movements. The idea was eventually scrapped in favor of simple English subtitles.\n\n“That woman deserves her revenge, and we deserve to die.” 15 years after the iconic revenge quest came to a close, Kill Bill Vol. 2 remains one of Tarantino’s best films. The series might not be over yet: rumors have been swirling for years of a third and perhaps fourth installment to the series. Though unconfirmed, it probably couldn’t hurt to brush up on the story of The Bride."
