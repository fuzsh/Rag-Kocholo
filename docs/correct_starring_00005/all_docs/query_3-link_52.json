        "text": "Kill Bill: Volume 1 Trailer\n\nSYNOPSIS: Four years after taking a bullet in the head at her own wedding, The Bride emerges from a coma and decides it's time for payback... with a vengeance. Having been gunned down by her former boss Bill and his deadly squad of international assassins, it's a kill-or-be-killed fight she didn't start, but is determined to finish.\n\nTarantino talks Kill Bill on Charlie Rose\n\nIn this 54 minute interview, Quentin Tarantino talks about Kill Bill on Charlie Rose. Quentin is very frenetic and flailing (even more than unusual). But mostly he seems very happy and proud at having completed \"his best writing\". A must-see for any QT or Kill Bill fan.\n\nKill Bill Vol. 1 Original Soundtrack (PA Version)\n\nKill Bill Vol. 1 Original Soundtrack is the soundtrack to the first volume of the two-part film.\n\nThis soundtrack was actually organized, and mostly produced and orchestrated by RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan. But Tarantino influences aren't hard to notice."
