        "text": "Hudson Madsen, the son of actor Michael Madsen, has died at the age of 26 years old.\n\nHis father Michael is one of film and TV's biggest stars, rising to global fame in critically acclaimed Hollywood films such as Reservoir Dogs, created by close friend Quentin Tarantino, who was also godfather to Hudson.\n\nSince starring in Reservoir Dogs, Michael has become one of cinema's best known actors, appearing in Bond classic Die Another Day, Thelma and Louise and Donnie Brasco.\n\nHe has also led an interesting life, including running a hot sauce business, being defended by Judi Dench on the set of Die Another Day and having a very famous sister-in-law.\n\nQuentin Tarantino bond\n\nOne of Michael Madsen's most famous roles was in the nineties film Reservoir Dogs as Vic Vega, directed by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nSince then, the two have had a close bond both on set and off, with Tarantino even becoming godfather to Michael's children.\n\nSpeaking about their friendship, Michael told Red Carpet News TV: \"It’s such a pleasure to be around him.\n\n\"He has such great enthusiasm and such a great presence. He inspires me.\"\n\nThe actor also credited Tarantino with supporting him in his career, adding: \"If it weren’t for me working with him early on, I don’t know if I would have found my way through the maze of Hollywood and the festering wound of L.A.\"\n\nTheir close bond continued after Reservoir Dogs, with Michael Madsen going on to star in further films including Kill Bill and The Hateful Eight.\n\nHe even revealed that his audition for Tarantino's The Hateful Eight film only lasted five minutes, with the actor getting the part immediately afterwards.\n\nHe told The Independent: \"I hadn’t heard from Quentin in over a year. But he called and asked me to go to his house, so I went over and he got out a script and asked me to read a few pages.\n\n\"I’d only read about five lines when he clapped his hands and said, ‘Okay, Mike. That’s great. I’ll see you on set in December.'\"\n\nSince then, the duo have also worked on further films including the award winning Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, starring Leonard DiCaprio.\n\nVega Brothers return rumours\n\nMichael Madsen has noted on many occasions that there is talk of a rumoured Vega Brothers film, based around the characters that he and John Travolta played in two separate Tarantino films.\n\nMichael played Vic Vega in Reservoir Dogs, while John Travolta played Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction.\n\nThey are two of the actors' most famous roles and, undoubtedly, fans would be delighted to see the characters back on screen once more.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the actor explained that Tarantino had planned to make the film straight after Pulp Fiction, despite the two characters being killed in their respective films, saying: \"Quentin was going to make a film called The Vega Brothers.\n\n\"And I said: 'Quentin, we’re both dead. We both get killed in those movies.' He said: 'Well, it’s a prequel.'\n\n\"And I said: 'You know, John and I don’t really look that young anymore, I don’t think it’s going to work.'\n\n\"So he said: 'OK, I’ve got a better idea.' So now he told me the scenario of The Vega Brothers, but it was so complicated I can’t explain it.\"\n\nMr Blonde, net worth and being defended by Judi Dench\n\nThroughout his career, Michael has got the reputation of playing some of the meanest characters on the silver screen.\n\nThese have included his famous role as Mr Blonde/Vic Vega in Reservoir Dogs and Damian Falco in Bond classic Die Another Day.\n\nThe actor even revealed that Judi Dench had defended him on the set of Die Another Day, after he took out a cigarette to smoke as his character.\n\nWhile his action shocked people on set, Judi said that it fit with his character, and said it should be kept in, with Michael telling AV Club: \"I pulled it out to light it, and everyone’s, like, ‘Whoa, hey, hey, hey, oh, no, no, no…’\n\n\"And then Judi Dench, she said, ‘Well, I don’t see anything wrong with Michael’s character smoking a cigarette. It’s quite apropos for him.'\n\n\"And then (director) Lee (Tamahori) was like 'Yeah, I think that’s right. Yeah, that’s a good thing. All right, Michael, we’ll let you have that cigarette!\"\n\nHowever, despite being known for playing 'the bad guy' in many films and TV programmes, he is also known to generations of fans as Glenn Greenwood, the father in 1991's family film Free Willy.\n\nHe also starred in films such as Donnie Brasco, cult classic Thelma and Louise and hit TV series such as 24, as well as being listed in a number of films currently in pre-production.\n\nDespite being in some of Hollywood's biggest films though, it has also been reported that the actor missed out on some other huge roles including Officer Wendall White in L.A Confidential, which eventually went to Russell Crowe.\n\nAside from films, the actor also has his own hot sauce and mustard brand, with pictures of the bottles showing the actor on the front, riding a motorbike.\n\nIt is no wonder then that between his business and his Hollywood career, the actor has a healthy estimated net worth of $6million (£4.4million).\n\nFamous sister in law\n\nMichael Madsen married his first wife Georganne LaPiere in 1984.\n\nHe wasn't the only Hollywood star in the family though, as his sister-in-law at the time was none other than music icon herself, Cher.\n\nIn an interview with AV Club, he explained that Cher was also dating his future The Doors co-star Val Kilmer at the time, saying: \"I had been married to Georganne [LaPiere], who is the sister of Cher, who at that time was dating Val Kilmer.\n\n\"And Georganne and I lived out on Val’s father’s ranch, which he got from Roy Rogers, and our house was on Trigger Street.\"\n\nHowever, Michael and Georganne's romance did not last and the couple divorced four years later in 1988.\n\nFamily life and award nominated sister\n\nFollowing Michael's marriage to Georganne LaPiere, he was married to Jeannine Bisignano from 1991 to 1995 and the couple had two children together.\n\nHe later married wife DeAnna Madsen in 1996, with whom he had three more children - Hudson, Calvin and Luke.\n\nDespite being known for playing some of the meanest characters in Hollywood, Michael is worlds away from his onscreen counterparts in real life.\n\nHe told The Hollywood Reporter: \"I think people really fear me. They see me and go: 'Holy s**t, there’s that guy!' But I’m not that guy. I’m just an actor.\n\n\"I’m a father, I’m married, I’ve been married 20 years. When I’m not making a movie, I’m home, in pyjamas.\"\n\nMichael is not the only Hollywood star in his family though, as his sister Virginia is also an award nominated actress.\n\nVirginia Madsen is well known for her roles in Candyman, The Haunting in Connecticut and as Maya in the film Sideways, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nThe two siblings have even starred alongside each other in films such as Blue Tiger and The Florentine.\n\nTragic loss\n\nIt was recently reported that Michael Madsen's son, Hudson Madsen, was found dead in Hawaii over the weekend.\n\nHudson Madsen, 26, lived in Wahiawa, Hawaii, with his wife Carlie, and was the godson of his father's close friend Quentin Tarentino.\n\nFollowing his death, a spokeswoman for the Department of the Medical Examiner in Honolulu said: \"I can confirm Hudson Lee Madsen, 26, died by a gunshot wound to the head in a suspected suicide on the island of Oahu.\"\n\nA representative for Michael Hudson later released a statement, saying that the family were 'heartbroken' by his death.\n\nIt said: \"We are heartbroken and overwhelmed with grief and pain at the loss of Hudson.\n\n\"His memory and light will be remembered by all who knew and loved him.\n\n\"We ask for privacy and respect during this difficult time. Thank you.\""
