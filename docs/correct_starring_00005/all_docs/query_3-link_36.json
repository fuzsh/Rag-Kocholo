        "text": "It’s been 30 years since Reservoir Dogs hit theaters on Oct. 23, 1992.\n\nQuentin Tarantino wrote and directed the film, while he also played the minor character of Mr. Brown.\n\nReservoir Dogs follows eight gangsters that use aliases based on different colors. Following a diamond heist led by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) that goes wrong, the criminals begin to suspect that one of the surviving men is secretly a police informant.\n\nHarvey Keitel leads the ensemble cast as Larry Dimmick, a gangster who is also known as Mr. White. Other members of the gang are portrayed by Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Tierney, Steve Buscemi, Edward Bunker and Tarantino.\n\nAfter premiering at the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 21, 1992, the film had its theatrical release in October of that year. Reservoir Dogs was met with critical acclaim and helped launch Tarantino’s film career.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter’s original review praised the film and Tarantino’s efforts behind the scenes. “Writer-director Quentin Tarantino is one lethal storyteller. Reservoir Dogs, even for those of us with weak stomachs, is a masterful story setup, aided and abetted by all those colorful guys in on the thing,” the review read.\n\nTarantino and the cast were nominated for several awards, with Buscemi winning the Independent Spirit Award for best supporting actor.\n\nThe film has left a lasting impact on Tarantino, who admitted he considered revisiting the story as his last film. “I’ve actually considered making a remake of Reservoir Dogs as my last movie,” the director said while appearing on Real Time with Bill Maher in June 2021. He added, “I won’t do it, internet! But I considered it.”\n\nIn honor of the milestone anniversary, take a look at what the cast of Reservoir Dogs has been up to since the film’s debut."
