Why not share that journey with you guys? Until this COVID-19 crisis has (relatively) passed, I'll be writing these smaller, random blurbs to keep you updated on what I'm watching. My viewing choices are very random; I have people determine what I'm going to watch using a very intricate system, broken down into various categories. I reviewed the first part of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill epic late last week. Let's wrap things up with a quick look at part 2!\n\nMovie Bio: Kill Bill: Volume 2\n\nRelease Date: 4/16/04\n\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\n\nStars: Uma Thurman, Michael Madsen, David Carradine, Daryl Hannah, Chia-Hui Liu, Helen Kim\n\nPlot: The murderous Bride is back and she is still continuing her vengeance quest against her ex-boss, Bill. In volume 2, she takes aim at Bill's younger brother Budd and Elle Driver, the only survivors from the squad of assassins who betrayed her four years earlier.\n\nPedigree: Part 2 of 2-part revenge epic. Fourth (technically fifth) film by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nI've underestimated the impact of Kill Bill: Volume 2 until this viewing, the third or fourth time I've watched it. The first film is the flashier, more extravagant entry of the epic, a bloody and riotously entertaining revenge movie that's not interested in much more than slicing people to shreds. This second installment adds much needed emotion to the story, a dialogue-heavy finale that examines the complicated relationship between the Bride and her titular target, the former lover and father of her child that ruined the life she was trying to have.\n\nWe finally see David Carradine's Bill in all his glory after only hearing him in Volume 1, introduced in a striking black-and-white sequence set before the inciting massacre at the Bride's wedding rehearsal. The greatest trick that Tarantino pulls on the audience in Volume 2 is ingratiating us to Bill's charms. We spend the first film hating him because of what he's done to Beatrix Kiddo, but Carradine almost makes us fall for him with his silly flute and poetic waxing about life and love. He's a snake charmer in every sense of the word, almost loveable until you remember he can ruin your life without hesitation. This builds a lot of tension in the film's climax, when the Bride finally has her chance at revenge. She could kill him easily, but you actually start to wonder if she'll actually go through with it.\n\nVolume 2 is longer, slightly quieter (which isn't saying much, given the fireworks of Volume 1), and adds dimension and more mythology to this fascinating universe. Thurman's character has been built-up as the ultimate badass, as we've just recently watched her slay 88 highly skilled assassins and their skilled Yakuza mafiosa. This half of the story humbles her, forcing her to use brains over brawn, as Michael Madsen's Bud has to use cunning misdirection to get the upper hand on her. We see the source of her skill through comprehensive training sequences with a grumpy and abusive martial arts master (lifted straight out of a 1970's martial arts film). These flashback scenes are well-timed in the scripting, adding context to her current-day dilemma as she tries to escape her most perilous situation.\n\nThis is bit messier than the first part, but it's a crucial turn towards seriousness that makes the entire experience more satisfying. Watching this as one long movie would probably be fascinating, mostly because the two films feel autonomous and separate, yet seamlessly fit together like a big puzzle. Tarantino's writing again takes center stage in Volume 2, doing a great job expanding upon this crazy universe. Will we get a part 3? Time will only tell, but the building blocks are there to make it an easy return for another story featuring the Bride."
