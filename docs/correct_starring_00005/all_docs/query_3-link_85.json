        "text": "Can we trust Quentin Tarantino again? I mean, last year, at the Cannes Film Festival, he announced on a French talk show that he would be back the next year (as in this year) with Inglourious Basterds, a film which he had been talking about making for 10 years. And, as we all know, that actually happened (believe it or not), and he did show up at Cannes with Inglourious Basterds. Tarantino most recently appeared on an Italian TV show (via BadTaste.it) and made a promise just like that, but this time for Kill Bill Vol. 3. \"The Bride will fight again,\" he revealed. When first asked if he'd do Kill Bill 3, his answer was an ecstatic \"Yes!\"\n\nTarantino also gave a \"maybe\" to a Basterds prequel, even though it's doing incredibly well at the box office, and a \"no, it'll never happen\" to a Pulp Fiction sequel. This isn't the first time we've heard of Kill Bill Vol. 3. The last I remember, Tarantino wanted to tell the story of Vernita Green's (Vivica A. Fox's character) daughter and how she grows up and gets revenge on Beatrix. I even remember hearing that it could become an entire anime instead of live-action, but I doubt that. It sounds Tarantino may actually be considering making Kill Bill 3 as his next movie following Basterds. Is that what you'd like to see him do next?\n\nI'm sure with this news now out there, we'll be hearing updates from people like Uma Thurman and Michael Madsen and maybe Tarantino himself, if anyone can catch up with him on the record. It's sad to know that Bill himself, David Carradine, will no longer be around to star in the sequel. I hope Tarantino has some plans that don't necessarily involve Bill returning in a big way, because Carradine really was perfectly cast."
