Michael Madsen, known for starring in 'Kill Bill', has been charged with drunk driving, said US authorities. The 61-year-old actor was charged with two misdemeanours in connection with a DUI arrest last month in Malibu, wherein he crashed his Land Rover into a pole. The incident marked the second time in 10 years that Madsen was arrested for drunk driving.
