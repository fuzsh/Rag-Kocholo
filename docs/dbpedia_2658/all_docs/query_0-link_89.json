At The Huntington, she will be focusing on her current book project, A Most Useful and Peculiar Science: Phrenology in Practice in the Nineteenth Century, which re-examines phrenology by concentrating on its users, who applied, adapted and contested it as a source of knowledge on the mind. Bittel is the author of Mary Putnam Jacobi and the Politics of Medicine in Nineteenth-Century America and is co-editor (with Elaine Leong and Christine von Oertzen) of the volume, Working with Paper: Gendered Practices in the History of Knowledge.\n\nDIBNER RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY\n\nLayne Karafantis, Fellow, University of Southern California\n\nTopic: Human-Machine Engineering in a Safety-Critical World\n\nLayne Karafantis is a Visiting Fellow at the University of Southern California, where she conducts research for the Aerospace History Project and performs outreach in the Los Angeles Basin, educating the public about the longstanding influence of the aerospace industry on southern California.

His specialism is the history of Britain and its maritime world, focusing particularly on the Royal Navy in eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. His research looks beyond the traditional remit of maritime history to analyze the political, social and cultural forces which created the navy, and which were in turn shaped by its activities. His recent publications include: In Nelson’s Wake: The Navy and the Napoleonic Wars (Yale University Press, 2015); Tudor and Stuart Seafarers: The Emergence of a Maritime Nation (Bloomsbury, 2018); and a co-edited volume, A New Naval History (Manchester University Press, 2019).

She is currently at work on a book entitled New World Calculation: The Making of Numbers in Colonial America, which explores the possibilities that arise by embracing mathematics as a form of humanist inquiry. By investigating the multiple histories of colonial numeracy, or the teaching and learning of numerical knowledge, the book argues that colonialism shaped broader understandings of the numbers themselves. Her first book, Counting Bodies: Population in Colonial American Writing, was published by Oxford University Press in 2016 and released in paperback in 2019; and her articles are published or forthcoming in American Quarterly, American Literature, Early American Literature, ELH, and The Cambridge Companion to Early American Literature.

Her first book, Sentimental Figures of Empire in Eighteenth-Century Britain and France (Johns Hopkins, 2006), examined how the culture of sensibility welded the affective response to other people to broader structures of classification in order to both include and exclude individuals from the class of humanity. Her second book, Fiction Without Humanity: Person, Animal, Thing in Early Enlightenment Literature and Culture (Penn, 2019), drew on riddles, fables, novels, scientific instruments, and trompe l’oeil painting to analyze the shifting terms in which human difference from animals, things, and machines was expressed. With Daniel Carey, she edited The Postcolonial Enlightenment: Eighteenth-Century Colonialism and Postcolonial Theory (Oxford, 2009) and she has published articles on a wide array of topics, including slavery, human rights, it-narratives, wigs, cosmetics, and a 1796 tax on dogs. Her work has been supported by fellowships from the National Humanities Center, the ACLS, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. At The Huntington, she will study the way Enlightenment definitions of humanity were derived from mechanical, scientific and artistic practices that designated the capacities humans possessed and the instrumental uses to which they might be rightfully put.\n\nNATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES FELLOW\n\nNatalia Molina, Professor, University of Southern California\n\nTopic: The Silent Hands that Shaped The Huntington: A History of its Mexican Workers\n\nNatalia Molina is a Professor of American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. Her work sits at the intersections of race, culture, immigration, and citizenship with the goal of helping us understand everyday issues in the world today. She is the author of two award-winning books, How Race Is Made in America and Fit to Be Citizens?: Public Health and Race in Los Angeles, 1879-1940. She is also the lead editor of the recently published, Relational Formations of Race: Theory, Method and Practice. She is currently at work finishing Place-makers: The Story of an Ethnic Mexican Community in 20th Century Los Angeles, which views local restaurants as urban institutions and their owners and employees as “place-makers.” During her tenure at The Huntington, she will work on her new book, The Silent Hands that Shaped The Huntington: A History of Its Mexican Workers.\n\nBARBARA THOM POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW\n\nAaron Cayer, Assistant Professor, University of New Mexico\n\nTopic: Extraordinary Practices: Architecture at the Dawn of Neoliberalism\n\nAaron Cayer is an Assistant Professor of Architecture History at the University of New Mexico.

She received her Ph.D. in history in the spring of 2017 from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (CUNY). Nora’s research focuses on the intersection of intellectual property, commerce, and politics in colonial, revolutionary, and early national America. She is currently working on her first book, The Engine of Free Expression: Copyrighting The State in Early America, which is forthcoming with the University of Pennsylvania Press and won the Society for the History of the Early American Republic (SHEAR) prize for best manuscript. This project, as well as other research in the Digital Humanities, has been supported by the McNeil Center for Early American Studies, the Library Company of Philadelphia, the New-York Historical Society, and the America Antiquarian Society, among others. Nora also serves as the Social Media Editor for the Journal of the Early Republic, the Book Reviews editor for SHARP News, and teaches courses ranging from the Age of Revolutions to copyright and innovation in US history that have digital and public history components.

During her time as a Fung Fellow, she worked on a book project, Europe and China: Face-off in the Horn of Africa, that examines how China’s rise, its vision for the Belt and Road Initiative, shifting power relations, and the land and maritime “unification” of Eurasia and Africa have begun to reshape global institutions, norms, and governance structures. Her new project, Discursive Dimensions of China’s “Ecological Civilization,” will explore the language, norms, and cultural values that are shaping notions of China’s “ecological civilization.” In addition, during her time at Caltech and The Huntington, she will be organizing an Institute in the summer of 2021 on critical minerals.\n\nOCCIDENTAL/BILLINGTON VISITING PROFESSOR IN U.S. HISTORY\n\nLeslie Butler, Professor, Dartmouth College\n\nTopic: Democracy and The Woman Question in Nineteenth-Century America\n\nLeslie Butler is an associate professor of history at Dartmouth College.
