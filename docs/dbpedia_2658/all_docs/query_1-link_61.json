        "text": "Profile\n\nMy research concerns the literature and culture of nineteenth-century Britain, France, and the United States, with an emphasis on the novel. My background is in new historicism and post/colonial studies. I also have research and teaching interests relating to print culture, media studies, critical theory, fairy tales, Caribbean literature, ecocriticism, and contemporary fiction. My first book, Creole Crossings: Domestic Fiction and the Reform of Colonial Slavery (Cornell Univ. Press, 2006), offered a critical cultural history of the figure of the Creole woman in nineteenth-century British, French, and American fiction, as well as in anti-slavery discourse of the period. My second book, Dickens and Democracy in the Age of Paper: Representing the People (Oxford Univ. Press, 2022), shows how Charles Dickens and the British Parliament engaged in competitive efforts to represent the People in print at a crucial moment in the history of representative democracy. A new book in progress, tentatively entitled Sensational Fictions, will sound the depths of the Black Atlantic in British fiction from Frances Trollope to Wilkie Collins.\n\nDegrees Held\n\nPh.D., Comparative Literature, Brown University, 2000\n\nM.A., Comparative Literature, University of Minnesota, 1993\n\nB.A., College of Letters, Wesleyan University, 1990\n\nProfessional Affiliation\n\nAdvisory Board, North American Victorian Studies Association\n\nTrustee, Dickens Society\n\nEditorial Board, Dickens Studies Annual and Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature\n\nSpecialist Reader, MELUS: Multi-Ethnic Literatures of the United States\n\nInterdisciplinary Nineteenth-Century Studies\n\nBritish Association for Victorian Studies\n\nNortheast Victorian Studies Association\n\nSociety for Novel Studies\n\nRecent Publications\n\nBooks\n\nDickens and Democracy in the Age of Paper: Representing the People, Oxford University Press, 2022.\n\nCreole Crossings: Domestic Fiction and the Reform of Colonial Slavery, Cornell University Press, 2006.\n\nSelected Articles, Book Chapters, and Review Essays\n\n“Caribbean/West Indies.” Oxford Bibliographies in Victorian Literature.
