        "text": "Rev Edward Garnier, who went in first for Oxford in 1873 when Cambridge were beaten by three wickets, died on August 8, aged 88. He was in the Marlborough eleven in 1867 and 1868. Three years before getting his blue he scored 146 for the University against Moreton-in-the-Marsh. A good athlete, he won the hurdle race in the inter-university sports in 1871 and 1872; was second in this event next year and also threw the hammer for Oxford in 1872. He was an Honorary Canon of Norwich Cathedral.\n\nWisden Cricketers' Almanack"
