        "text": "The IBM Shared University Research (SUR) Awards have been a world-wide monetary, hardware, software, and services program that promoted research and innovation in areas of strategic mutual interest between IBM and Universities.\n\nThe IBM SUR Awards program connected universities with IBM in organizations such as IBM Research, IBM Cloud, IBM Systems, and IBM Global Services â including IBMâs development and product labs. The program aimed at supporting an area of significant interest to the university and IBM. These programs promoted collaborative research projects bringing value to IBM, the technology community, and the world.\n\nIn 2020, the IBM Faculty Award (FA) and the IBM Shared University Research (SUR) Award have been blended into an IBM Faculty Award allowing nominators to express and develop more responsive Award applications that concentrate on methods, collaboration, and sharing of outcomes.\n\nThirty IBM Shared University Awards were given throughout the world 2018-2019. These awards consisted of high performance computing configurations; AI optimization projects; longitudinal environmental studies; the creation of a Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Center; and major contributions to the OpenPowerCenter around Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Centric Visualization, and Accelerated Cognitive Cybersecurity.\n\nThe IBM Faculty Awards have fostered collaboration between researchers at leading universities with those in IBM that share their expertise. The program âs impact ranged from the funding of emerging areas of science and technology to supporting curriculum development that stimulated growth in disciplines and technologies that were strategic to IBM. This work continues today in the IBM Global University Program Academic Award.\n\nIn 2020, the IBM Faculty Award (FA) and the IBM Shared University Research (SUR) Award have been blended into an IBM Faculty Award allowing nominators to express and develop more responsive Award applications that concentrate on methods, collaboration, and sharing of outcomes."
