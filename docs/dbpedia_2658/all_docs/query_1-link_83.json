        "text": "Bio\n\nAlexandre Bonafos teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in French language, literature and culture, with a particular focus on post-1800 France and nineteenth-century literature. His research interests lie at the intersection of literature, history and art history in nineteenth-century France, especially the Romantic period. A specialist of travel discourses and practices, he studies the relationship between archaeology, travel writing, and the shaping of heritage politics in modern France. His current book project analyses the contributions of Prosper Mérimée to the archaeological discipline and the conservation movement under the July Monarchy and Second Empire.\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D. (2014) New York University\n\nB.A. (2002), M.A. (2005) Université de Paris-IV – Sorbonne\n\nCurrent Responsibilities\n\nFrench Graduate Advisor\n\nFrench House & Club Faculty Supervisor\n\nPi Delta Phi (French Honor Society) Faculty Liaison\n\nMaxcy College (International House) Faculty Fellow\n\nCourses Taught\n\nFREN 209 Reading & Written Expression\n\nFREN 210 Oral Communication\n\nFREN 309 Introduction to Reading French Texts\n\nFREN 310 Advanced Oral Communication\n\nFREN 452 French Literature & Culture after 1800\n\nFREN 501 La France contemporaine\n\nFREN 595 Paris.
