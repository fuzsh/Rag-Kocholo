        "text": "As you might imagine, choosing the 50 best restaurants in Paris is no easy feat. The food scene in Paris is up there with some of the best in the world, and it‚Äôs likely that eating good is up there with climbing the Eiffel Tower and getting a selfie outside the Louvr√© on your Paris itinerary. Luckily for you, the team at Time Out Paris know what they‚Äôre doing. That‚Äôs for sure.\n\nAnd we believe in tasting a bit of everything while you‚Äôre here. There‚Äôs plenty of high-end restaurants in Paris (the best of which you‚Äôll find on our list), but we‚Äôre always sure to include casual and cheap eats too; on our list you‚Äôll find everything from romantic Michelin-starred dining to set lunchtime menus and the best d√∂ner kebab in the city. Whatever your tastes (and budget), here are the best restaurants in Paris right now.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\nüé® The best things to do in Paris\n\nüè∫ The best museums in Paris\n\nüè® Where to stay in Parisüè° The best Airbnbs in Paris\n\nThis article was written by the editorial team at Time Out Paris. At Time Out, all of our travel guides are written by local writers who know their cities inside out. For more about how we curate, see our editorial guidelines.\n\nLe Clarence is more than just a meal; it's an extraordinary journey to a parallel world, full of crystal chandeliers and neoclassical paintings. It's the kind of place you imagine important figures from history might have dined once, taking place in a luxurious private mansion, overflowing with wood panelling, mouldings and velvet. Chef Christophe Pel√© serves up an incredible seasonal menu ‚Äì we loved the tempura shrimp, the baby eels and grilled red mullet with bone marrow. This is an unforgettable sensory experience in twenty-or-so dishes, paired with several bottles of natural wine. Once you‚Äôve finished eating, end your evening cosying up by the fireplace in the restaurant‚Äôs private hideaway bar with a glass of wine (or three).\n\n2. Vaisseau\n\nAfter years of popping up, Adrien Cachot has once again found a place to showcase his genius. Now, he is the captain of the very-special Vaisseau, a grey-hued gem for plates infused with the chef‚Äôs bubbling creativity. The abundant menu features veal offal and fish bones, Japanese variations and French terroir, coffee as a starter and kriek as a dessert. Unstoppable technique serves as the vehicle for an explosion of creativity.\n\nAdvertising\n\n3. Hakuba\n\nOn the ground floor of the Cheval Blanc palace, in a serene, wood-lined cocoon reminiscent of a Shaolin temple, Arnaud Donckele and Maxime Fr√©d√©ric engage with the Japanese culinary arts of Takuya Watanabe. The result? Hakuba: an incredible 17-stage seafood epic where dishes are assembled before your eyes in a precise choreography. Top-tier sushi in Paris is accompanied by broths, wine pairings and desserts crafted by the two French chefs. Hakuba soars to great heights.\n\nSeptime hasn't aged a bit since it opened in 2011. This is fine dining in a London pub-type setting; think weathered wood tables, blackened steel and dim lighting. Another thing that hasn‚Äôt changed? Bertrand Gr√©baut‚Äôs Michelin-starred cuisine, which remains fresh, innovative and delicious (and features a seven-course menu that knows how to build up to a crescendo). It changes every three weeks, but previous highlights include little gem with a micro-thin slice of bacon, pearly scallops paired with bone marrow, and an incredible grilled sweetbread and harissa dish served with a couscous broth. To fully appreciate these dishes, the expertly curated wine pairings are practically a must. Trust us.\n\nAdvertising\n\n5. Datil\n\nManon Fleury and chef Laur√®ne Barjhoux bring their sustainability and feminist values to this conceptual and welcoming haven in the heart of the Marais. A taupe-coloured room, bright, warm lighting and attentive service set the stage for Datil‚Äôs completely unique cuisine with the delicacy of lacework. Vegetables take centre stage, producers are known by their first names, and seasonality is non-negotiable.\n\n6. Le Doyenn√©\n\nJames Edward Henry and Shaun Kelly escaped to the countryside in the renovated outbuildings of a chateau in Essonne to create an exquisite restaurant in a beautiful setting. The delicate dishes at Le Doyenn√© include veal steak ‚Äì perfectly grilled on the wood fire ‚Äì with sides to share around the table, like purslane and grilled green beans and cabbage salad. The kitchen garden provides most of the vegetables and herbs, and small local farms supply the meat. The setting will make sure your soul feels just as nourished.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe Levha sisters, Katia and Tatiana, have been lighting up their corner spot on Rue Saint-Maur since 2014. The setting is drop-dead gorgeous: ceiling mouldings, a vintage fresco, and a bouquet of flowers on the massive brass bar. The cuisine, which hops freely between France and Asia, is boldly innovative and very now: check out the grilled sweetbreads boosted by phrik phao (spicy Thai sauce). Oh, and the carefully selected wines are grea too, heavy on Burgundy reds and whites.\n\n8. Restaurant Passerini\n\nGiovanni Passerini has got to be the best Italian chefs in Paris. Hell, we reckon he's one of the top chefs in the city full stop. His modern trattoria is a beaut with a terrazzo floor, white walls, and sleek light fixtures. Passerini's menu is a perfect balance of classic Italian comfort food (think duck ragu tagliatelle and ricotta-spinach ravioli with sage butter) and insanely good gourmet dishes, like the two-course pigeon, which might just have you dreaming about it for weeks after you've paid the (admittedly steep) bill.\n\nAdvertising\n\nLooking for a starched-tablecloth meal with genteel service and some friendly vegetarian options? Yeah, this isn‚Äôt the place. At this Parisian market counter, you eat standing up in the open air (it does get chilly in winter), with jovial Michael Grosman as your endearing host and sommelier. He was named the ‚ÄòBest Host in Paris‚Äô at the Time Out Food and Drink Awards (we like him). The bold and meaty plates from Japanese chef Shunta Suzuki are just as satisfying as they are pricey, from the charcuterie offerings to the iconic Groix mussels in a gorgonzola sauce.\n\n10. Faubourg Daimant\n\nHere at Faubourg Daimant, Alice Tuyet offers nothing less than the finest vegan dining experience in Paris. Vegetable-based food is born out of true ambition here, with one objective: to guide traditional French cuisine with all of its comforting richness, legendary recipes, and robust sauces, towards a meat-free world. The menu features a carousel of successes: tender carrots glazed with bbq sauce; tofu croquettes in the style of pig‚Äôs feet; Proven√ßal stuffed vegetables, roasted and served with ‚Äòvegetable carcass‚Äô jus. Fresh, innovative and very exciting.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAt the helm of this cool bar mixing wood, glass, concrete, and steel, Bertrand Gr√©baut (of Septime) is your captain on a voyage of seafood. The menu changes based on the day's catch (which is always sustainably sourced). The delicious dishes include spicy Ol√©ron cuttlefish and mullet ceviche with butternut squash. Just watch out: the bill can rise as quickly as the tide. And that‚Äôs quick.\n\n12. Nhome\n\nIn this cave-like spot facing the Palais-Royal garden, chef Matan Zaken and his team offer a six-course menu that showcases seasonal cuisine with incredible precision (and no pretension). Dishes include eel and foie gras, veal with an amba sauce, and a quince and butternut dessert. This inventive feast is best enjoyed with natural wines or cold infusions selected by MOF Manuel Peyrondet. Trust us, your stomach will thank you for eating at Nhome.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAt first glance, Mokonuts appears to be a modest coffee shop, where you can unexpectedly enjoy a top-notch cookie baked by the brilliant Japanese firefly Moko Hirayama. And you certainly will, but you‚Äôll also probably have the best lunch of your life if you‚Äôre lucky enough to grab a spot. Mokonuts‚Äô Franco-Lebanese head chef Omar Koreitem creates dishes that will blow your mind, from scallops crudo to cavatelli and cuttlefish puttanesca. Mokonuts is one of our most beloved restaurants at Time Out, year after year.\n\nThis bistro may have officially opened in 2016 and not cost much, but it has an old soul. It sort of feels like the kind of place where figures from history have sat, and where your favourite author may have enjoyed some snails back in the 80s. Of course, Les Alorts serves its iconic sausage and mash, unbeatable at the top of the bistro pantheon, but everything else on the menu is finely crafted and perfectly executed. Take our word for it: this is the best bistro in Paris.\n\nAdvertising\n\n15. Chakaiseki Akiyoshi\n\nChef Akiyoshi Yuichiro, hailing from Fukuoka, brings us chakaiseki: a highly codified succession of dishes that culminates in the tasting of matcha tea, prepared in the traditional Japanese way. The chef works in front of his audience with the precision of a watchmaker, varying the cooking methods, ingredients, and tableware at each stage. Chakaiseki Akiyoshi is a moment of grace, an incredible and serene journey unlike any other in France, though be warned: it comes at a price.\n\n16. Gare au Gorille\n\nAfter top-notch culinary science? Few places do it better than Batignolles. A few steps from Saint-Lazare station, Marc Cordonnier (formerly of art-food hub Ze Kitchen Galerie) and super sommelier Louis Langevin have taken up residence in a discreet, stylish white address. The market-inspired menu leans heavily towards Asia (like the hake with Paimpol beans and Thai broth) and changes almost daily, but balance and creativity are always on point. Oh, and Gare au Gorille have got the best natural wine list in the neighbourhood.\n\nAdvertising\n\n17. Le Maquis\n\nBehind a deep red storefront lies La Maquis: a sleek, minimalist, deeply fashionable food spot, its chairs, tables and benches slotting perfectly into a snug space. From this unassuming base, two chefs formerly of brasserie institution Le Ch√¢teaubriand have launched a culinary offensive that has conquered the surrounding neighbourhood. The affordable lunch menu features only bombshell plates that combine disarming simplicity and watchmaker precision.\n\nThe chefs at Le Dauphin experiment with creative tapas in a modern and clean-looking space, full of glass and Carrara marble. The restaurant was designed by legendary architect Rem Koolhaas, and its now the kind of place where fashionable people snack on small plates and snap Instagram pics, but in a good way. The dishes are focused on high-quality ingredients in their purest form, like mussels marini√®res and the trademark sea snails, served with a little jar of mayo. Heads up: at lunchtime, Le Dauphin has a special set menu for ‚Ç¨20, and it's great.\n\nAdvertising\n\n19. Recoin\n\nIf you‚Äôre in Saint-Ambroise, Recoin is an essential stop. This attractive joint ‚Äì designed by Florent Ciccoli with light wood, white walls and a blue-tiled floor like a swimming pool ‚Äì will welcome you whether it‚Äôs your first coffee of the morning or last calvados of the night. Finnish chef Marlo Snellman cooks up a fresh and straightforward bistro menu ‚Äì think pork loin and grilled eggplant, followed by absinthe baba ‚Äì best enjoyed with Recoin‚Äôs highly drinkable wines.\n\nChef Adrien Ferrand cuts through the noise of the Parisian restaurant scene by doing things a little differently. Eels is a cosy little bistro in Poissonni√®re, where every single dish is crafted with impeccable technique. Plates here are presented beautifully with precise little touches, like the raw scallops with turnip ravioli, or the guinea fowl with grilled cuttlefish, green beans and padr√≥n peppers. There‚Äôs no trickery here; Eels is just a great restaurant.\n\nAdvertising\n\n21. Dandelion\n\nChef Antoine Villard and sommelier Morgane Souris have opened Dandelion, a stylish bistro that‚Äôs more sophisticated than quaint. Here, you can enjoy clever cuisine featuring seasonal ingredients with Asian influences (the chef trained at Double Dragon). This results in already iconic dishes like soy-glazed sweetbreads paired with an anchovy sauce, creating a Franco-Asian surf-and-turf that makes you want to lick the plate clean. Proof that bistronomy still has plenty of bite (if you needed any).\n\nLe Tagine gets its character from openwork lanterns, zelliges and pleated fabrics on the ceiling. The radiant owner Marie-Jos√©e Mimoun sources the cr√®me de la cr√®me of products to cook some seriously good food, including literally the best couscous in the world ‚Äì yes, we went there ‚Äì with spices from Thiercelin, suckling lamb from the Pyrenees and olive oil from a local store. Plus Mimoun was one of the first to switch to an all-natural wine list (a win in our books).\n\nAdvertising\n\n23. Brutos\n\nOkay, so the name sounds a little scary, but trust us, this place is actually chill AF. Opened by the French-Brazilian couple Ninon Lecomte and Lucas Baur de Campos, the service here is friendly AF, and the setting insanely cosy. The dishes are definitely meaty but still delicate, like the cloud-like mashed potato crowned with bone marrow, served with perhaps the softest and most tender flame-grilled rib you‚Äôve ever tasted. And if you‚Äôre lucky enough to visit on a Sunday, it would be a crime not to order Bruto‚Äôs roast chicken.\n\n24. Sur Mer\n\nIn charge of this tiny tiled galley is Olive Davoux, a Belgian-Ugandan who used to work at L'Ecailler du Bistrot, and who delights diners with a menu of small plates inspired by the day's (artisanal) catch. Dive in to Sur Mer head-first to taste the likes of black mullet ceviche and Basque country lean carpaccio, and don't forget the well-shucked oyster baskets (Monsieur Jean-Paul's Utah Beach and Cadoret family's specials). Unreal.\n\nAdvertising\n\n25. 19 Saint Roch\n\nPierre Touitou, much missed by foodies since his departure from Vivant 2, has finally opened his own place, a neo-bistro as stylish as an Italian suit from the 80s. 19 Saint Roch‚Äôs menu showcases the chef‚Äôs signature style: clean, minimalist, and elegant. Each dish is straightforward, with never more than three elements on the plate, such as the impeccable monkfish with artichokes and tamarind, accompanied by a small plate of black rice with sea urchins and monkfish liver. Touitou‚Äôs take on bistronomy is a triumph.\n\n26. Grande Brasserie\n\nGrande Brasserie was brought back to life in 2022 by director Adrien Spanu ‚Äì and elected the same year as Paris‚Äôs best restaurant at the Time Out Paris Food and Drink Awards. Spanu was on a mission to restore the heritage of this Parisian landmark, which shows in the decor: '20s mosaics, post-war frescoes, and starched tablecloths. This all makes for a cosy space to enjoy the timeless cuisine from chef Gr√©goire Simon. Make sure to try his world-class deviled eggs (at a high price).\n\nAdvertising\n\n27. Caf√© du Coin\n\nCaf√© du Coin is a charming, old-fashioned bistro, complete with brass-rimmed counter, formica tables, and belle √©poque cement tiles. And while it might have a name as common as they come for a French dive bar, you‚Äôd be foolish to dismiss it. Created by chef Florent Ciccoli (previously of Jones, Cheval d'Or, and Recoin), this neighborhood watering hole in the 11th arrondissement is buzzing from morning coffee to dinner time. Our recommendation? Their affordable lunch menu, featuring irresistible bistro plates like the Mont d'Or cheese cordon bleu. And for drinks, Caf√© du Coin has got you covered with plenty of natural wines to choose from and small pizzettes to munch on. It‚Äôs our go-to spot.\n\n28. Le Saint Sebastien\n\nThis place is more Parisian than the Eiffel Tower ‚Äì old zinc bar, Formica tables and globe lights ‚Äì providing the perfect backdrop for some refined bistronomy. Le Saint Sebastien chef Christopher Edwards delivers a bold, daring and flavorful cuisine. And to complement these impressive dishes, the brilliant propri√©taire Daniela Lavadenz has curated one of the city's finest wine lists.\n\nAdvertising\n\n29. Dilia\n\nSince 2015, the Tuscan chef Michele Farnesi ‚Äì who worked at legendary Paris restaurants Rino and Heimat ‚Äì has been making his mark in the quirky dining room of this small address in M√©nilmontant, which is more like an osteria than a palace. Dilia‚Äôs five-course meal takes diners on a lively journey through the Italian terroirs with precise and spirited cooking. Highlights include the Venetian-style pasta and the opaline mullet with hollandaise sauce and sea urchin (and of course the all-Italian wine list).\n\n30. Frenchie\n\nGet stuck into small plates and big glasses (the wine list is as thick as a summer novel) at number 6 on the well-polished Rue du Nil, Frenchie our favourite address from French chef Gr√©gory Marchand. The venue is small ‚Äì you'll be elbow to elbow with the mostly English-speaking clientele ‚Äì but worth it for the scotch eggs and kimchi aioli, veal sweetbread nuggets and salsify tagliatelle with yellow wine slalom. Plus, it's the perfect spot to come alone, as you'll no doubt end up chatting with everyone at the bar.\n\nAdvertising\n\n31. Narro\n\nJust a few strides away from the crowds of the Place de la Contrescarpe, Japanese chef Kazuma Chikuda serves up his delicate cuisine in a haven of tasteful kilim armchairs. Mind-blowing leek tartlet, Granny Smith gel and cabbage-stuffed veg with yellow wine emulsion. The menu changes all the time, but the delight stays the same. Whether it‚Äôs for lunch or dinner, on weekdays or on Sundays, it‚Äôs always time for Narro.\n\n32. Racines\n\nDark wood bistro furniture, 19th-century bourgeois paintings and Belle Epoque tiling make this dream of a Parisian tavern what it is, nestled away in the Passage des Panoramas. Sardinian chef Simone Tondo cooks from an open kitchen so you can watch the action unfold, and the food is proper Italian grub. Think old, reassuring Italian classics, passed down from Tondo‚Äôs nonna. Simple, delicious. Just watch that bill ‚Äì Racines is pricey.\n\nAdvertising\n\n33. AVE Pizza Romana\n\nThe premier outpost of Roman-style pizza (which boasts a thinner crust than its Neapolitan cousin) in Paris also has plenty of style. With AVE‚Äôs bar made of white bricks, bare walls, mirrored ceiling and trendy servers, the finest dishes are the delightfully simple margherita (made with buffalo mozzarella, tomato, and basil) and parma rossa (22-month aged Parma ham, buffalo mozzarella, tomato and basil). And from noon to 1pm, Tuesday to Friday, they‚Äôre sold at affordable prices (from ‚Ç¨6 to ‚Ç¨10).\n\n34. Michelle\n\nAn extension of the beloved rotisserie Candide, this charming blue, wood, and Belleville-style counter stands out as a midday gem. Camille Guillaud and Alessandro Candido offer decadent sandwiches on Thierry Breton‚Äôs bread, hearty soups made from local veg and plenty of savoury tarts. Everything at Michelle Mabelle is fresh, homemade and delicious.\n\nAdvertising\n\n35. Le Cadoret\n\nAn exceptionally cool, icy blue retro joint, Le Cadoret rules its corner of Belleville from the first morning croissant all the way to the last post-dinner digestif. Chef L√©a Fleuriot serves up old-school dishes, sometimes with a twist of herbs, condiments or spices, like the pot-au-feu made with tender beef paleron and fermented soy paste sauce. As for Louis-Marie, the man behind the bottles, he uncorks carefully selected natural wines and sakes.\n\nAntonin Bonnet, the talented and reserved chef from C√©vennes, is impervious to trends. He focuses instead on high-quality ingredients, and serves up his outstanding dishes in the rather minimal dining room here at Quinsou. It's expensive, but worth every cent. Try the lobster with pickled beets, Vend√©e monkfish with sake, or veal sweetbreads from Anne-Laure Jolivet's farm with black truffle cream. It's pure talent on a plate.\n\nAdvertising\n\n37. Vantre\n\nThis timeless Parisian bistro setting is hiding something special. You might think it‚Äôs all just steak and fries, but you‚Äôll be blown away by the beautifully crafted plates of the Japanese chef Masaki Nagao (formerly of Clarence) with his crispy sardine tempura and pearly hake drizzled in chorizo sauce. The experience wouldn't be complete without sommelier Marco Pelletier (formerly of Bristol), who manages the small room and one of the most beautiful wine cellars in Paris with some extremely rare bottles. To top it off? Even with its Michelin star, the prices are pretty reasonable. Vantre is immune to inflation.\n\n38. Mam from Hano√Ø\n\nIn this neat little canteen, the Tran Luu family offers popular Vietnamese cuisine enhanced by carefully sourced ingredients, from rice and premium sauces to French meat. At Mam from Hano√Ø you can enjoy some of the best ph·ªü in Paris: an intensely aromatic broth, not too fatty (just enough to be comforting), with tender slices of flank steak and short ribs floating in it. It might look big, but you‚Äôll finish the bowl. We promise.\n\nAdvertising\n\nUnder a ceiling of century-old Circassian ceramics, this venerable bistro ‚Äì once the favourite haunt of the performers from the nearby Cirque d‚ÄôHiver ‚Äì serves up an exciting, contemporary cuisine without any unnecessary frills or gimmicks. Korean chef Jung Yonghoon delights his patrons with a dazzling array of small, perfectly balanced dishes. And as the star attraction, the bistro boasts one of the finest selections of natural wines in Paris.\n\n40. Mehmet\n\nYes, Mehmet is trendy but, above all, truly delicious. The homemade flatbread, spread with pepper puree, wraps around incredibly tender free-range chicken, white cabbage pickles, red onions, and a cascade of yogurt sauce. The fries, more golden and shiny than a Nice retiree, complete this substantial sandwich. Don‚Äôt leave without trying the Turkish mezze, which are as original as they are tasty!\n\nAdvertising\n\n41. Bistrot des Tournelles\n\nA big advocate of retro gastronomy, restauranteur √âdouard Vermynck has transformed the site of the old Gaspard de la Nuit into something from a hundred years ago. Adorned with vintage framed photos, antique mirrors and a hand-painted sign on the storefront, Bistrot des Tournelles‚Äô menu keeps the theme with timeless, household French dishes. Artisanal andouillette with a bushel of excellent matchstick fries, roast chicken with fluffy mashed potatoes, cordon-bleu with fries... nostalgia has never tasted so good.\n\n42. Takuto\n\nIn just a few months, this stainless steel and marble little enclave founded by Takuya Watanabe has already won the title for the best hand rolls in Paris, hands down. On the counter, you‚Äôll find XXL makis: crispy nori sheets, warm pearly rice grains, homemade soy sauce, and most importantly top-quality fish like bluefin tuna or line-caught meagre. Takuto‚Äôs food is always high-end, but the vibe is unpretentious and relaxed.\n\nAdvertising\n\n43. Paloma\n\nSchoolfriends Marie-Anna Delgado (in the kitchen) and Olivia Brunet (on decor and service) have set up this lovely canteen where seemingly all of Belleville is a regular. They've got a magic lunch deal with plates that'll transport you to a road trip through the Landes on your way back from Catalonia. Add in wild tapas nights and Sunday bingo, and you‚Äôll leave singing Paloma's praises.\n\n44. Menkicchi\n\nIn this tiny, well-decked-out ramen spot (with a counter made of cinder blocks and manga shelves embedded in the wall), get ready to slurp some wonderful homemade noodles. Menkicchi amongst the very best Japanese eateries in Sainte-Anne, where‚Äôs there‚Äôs quite the competition. Those noodles frolic in a bowl of succulent chicken and pork broth, pimped up with dried seaweed, a runny nitamago egg and thin, tender chƒÅsh≈´ pork slices. Itadakimasu!\n\nAdvertising\n\n45. Double Dragon\n\nIn a high-ceilinged room with a domino counter and neon dragon, the Levha sisters ‚Äì Tatiana and Katia ‚Äì blend their Filipino roots with global influences in sharp, precise and unexpected ways. Try the fried bao filled with Comt√© cheese and dipped in XO mayo or the South American-infused clams in fiery chipotle and chilli broth. This unique, quirky and endearing spot is also staffed by an ultra-friendly team and boasts a soundtrack with a penchant for turn-of-the-century hip-hop. Long live Double Dragon.\n\n46. Ozlem\n\nThe d√∂ner kebab's honour is restored! At Ozlem, you won‚Äôt find frozen fries or sketchy meat. The team at this Turkish canteen work tirelessly to prepare the ultimate kebab, using a mix of veal and turkey that marinates for hours before being skewered and grilled. It's served in a homemade d√ºr√ºm (wheat wrap) filled with sliced red onions, a touch of sumac, and parsley. Crispy, tender and perfectly seasoned, this kebab‚Äôs an absolute killer.\n\nAdvertising\n\n47. Miam Miam Cool\n\nThis postage stamp-sized Chinese joint sets taste buds on fire with its spicy Sichuan broths. Miam Miam Cool's menu is concise: wheat or rice vermicelli noodle soups loaded with meat, or homemade dumplings with silky fillings. You can adjust the spiciness level from zero to three, and there's no need for false pride ‚Äì even level one is a scorcher.\n\nJust a stone‚Äôs throw away from the Rue des Rosiers, this spot is the brainchild of Tel Aviv superstar chef Eyal Shani. It's got a charmingly chaotic vibe, with an open kitchen, blaring music and vegetables hanging from the counter. Even the massive blackboard on the wall lists the menu in a disorderly fashion. Here you'll find top-notch pitas (with chicken that's crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, ultra-tender lamb-beef meatballs, and comforting ratatouille) accompanied by the legendary grilled cauliflower. It's simple, funky and definitely worth a visit.\n\nAdvertising\n\n49. Haikara\n\nChef Sho Miyashita and his partner J√©r√©my M√©galy have transformed this small room with moleskin banquettes and exposed walls into a lively and eclectic Japanese tapas bar. At Haikara you can enjoy well-crafted Japanese bites and comforting junk food, like skate wing with umeboshi sauce or a fluffy omelette with bacon, white cabbage and bulldog sauce. Wash it all down with Highballs, just like in the alleys of Kabukicho.\n\n50. Caf√© Content\n\nWolfgang Staudinger only took over Caf√© Content a few years ago, but it feels like it‚Äôs been around forever. This bright little bistro, with art deco lettering, a mirrored ceiling, tulip chandeliers and vintage furniture, sees Staudinger team up with chef Etienne Herv√© (who also worked at the now-closed Caf√© Constant ‚Äì hence the name). Together they serve up an impeccable set-menu lunch for ‚Ç¨22, where classic bistro dishes are given a twist with natural wines. No pretence here, just pure satisfaction."
