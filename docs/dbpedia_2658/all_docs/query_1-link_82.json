A member of the consultant cohort piloting an integration of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, Harvard Business School, and the Kennedy School of Government for educational leaders, her practice is strongly influenced by frameworks and perspective from each institution and embodies cutting edge research around student learning, organizational effectiveness, and the socio-political aspects of executive leadership. She also served as a faculty member for the Coach Learning Program of Harvard’s Change Leadership Group and participated in the research and development of their systemic change framework.\n\nDr. Rasmussen joined the Drexel faculty in 2021 where she teaches doctoral courses in leadership and qualitative research. Previously she taught and chaired doctoral committees for Northeastern University and developed a new competency-based Masters in Digital Teaching and Learning for Fielding Graduate University. Her interest and experience in virtual learning environments date back to the 1990’s when she served as the co-coordinator of the International Education and Resource Network’s (I*EARN) Pacific Northwest Center. One of the first digitally based networks enabling cross-cultural collaborative project-based learning opportunities for students and teachers, today I*EARN is found in 140 countries where more than 2 million youth engage in projects daily. She was a founding director and secretary of Educurious Partners, a nonprofit organization that combines project-based learning with an expert network\n\nand technology and she has developed synchronous and asynchronous learning modules for Harvard University’s Programs in Professional Education. Dr. Rasmussen has consulted internationally around leadership, learning networks, organizational effectiveness, and community engagement. Her clients have included The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Washington State Board of Education, American Institutes for Research, and school districts ranging in size from 800 to 50,000.\n\nDr. Rasmussen received her Ed.D. in Educational Leadership and Change from Fielding Graduate University. She is active in the Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate, currently co-lead of its Program of the Year Committee and its special interest group around online/hybrid doctoral learning. A resident of Seattle, when not interacting with students and colleagues, she can be found walking her dog, Tallac, rain or shine."
