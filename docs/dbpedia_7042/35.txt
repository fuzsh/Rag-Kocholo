Over 32 million people have perished in natural disasters since 1900. In an era of climate change, the frequency and intensity of natural disasters will inevitably increase. The effects of war, political instability, mass migration, pandemics, and rapid urbanization exacerbate these incidents. The U.S. military is often the only entity capable of responding in a timely and meaningful way to these disasters. In this volume, John Sherwood examines the response of the U.S. Navy and its partners to three of the most destructive disasters in recent history: the 2004 earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Japan's triple disaster in 2011. Based on original sources and numerous interviews, Sherwood not only explores a topic rarely examined by historians but crafts a vivid and compelling narrative.
