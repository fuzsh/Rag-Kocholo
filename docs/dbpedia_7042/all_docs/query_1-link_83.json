        "text": "In the autumn of 1915, while living in a bohemian boardinghouse on Chicago’s Near North Side, Sherwood Anderson began work on a collection of tales describing the tortured lives of the inhabitants of Winesburg, a fictional Ohio town, in the 1890s. Drawing on his own experience growing up in the agricultural hamlet of Clyde, Ohio, he breathed life into a band of neurotic castaways adrift on the flatlands of the Midwest, each of them in their own way struggling — and failing — to locate meaning, personal connection and love amid the town’s elm-shaded streets.\n\nThese “grotesques,” as Anderson called them, had allowed doubt and fear to overwhelm their better instincts. They were, the writer believed, casualties of a close-minded culture, condemned to live out a lonely, alienated existence. “Winesburg” quickly became a cultural byword, a metaphor for the yawning emptiness of rural life.\n\nToday that book, “Winesburg, Ohio,” is a staple of high school English classes and an acknowledged classic — No. 24 on the Modern Library’s list of 100 best American novels. But the path that the book, published a century ago on May 8, 1919, took to literary renown was anything but direct.\n\nBy the time the boutique publisher B.W. Huebsch read Anderson’s manuscript in August 1918, it had already been rejected on both sides of the Atlantic. Even London’s John Lane Company, which had put out Anderson’s previous works — two novels and a book of verse — when no New York publisher would touch them, dismissed it as “too gloomy.” But Huebsch, who had introduced American readers to James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence, agreed to publish it.\n\nOver its first two years the book, as skeptics had foreseen, sold a modest 5,000 copies. By contrast, Sinclair Lewis’s take on small-town life, “Main Street,” published a year later, surpassed 390,000 in sales during the same interval.\n\nAnderson’s book fared little better with critics. Although some, including the literary kingmaker H.L. Mencken, lavished “Winesburg” with praise — “Here, indeed, is a piece of work that stands out from the common run of fiction like the Alps from the Piedmont plain,” he wrote — many reviewers were savage. The journalist Heywood Broun thought the book “monotonous,” while others complained that Anderson’s descriptions lacked depth and that his characters were one-dimensional “puppets with names.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
