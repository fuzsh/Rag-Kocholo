        "text": "The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts\n\nannounces\n\n2022 – 2023 Social Impact Programs\n\nincluding\n\nCommunity Partnerships, Conflux Programming, Culture Caucus, Impactful Connections, Social Practice Residents, and Millennium Stage\n\n(WASHINGTON)- The Kennedy Center’s Social Impact program announces partnerships and programming for the 2022–2023 season, including Community Partnerships, Culture Caucus, the Conflux, Social Practice Residents, and Millennium Stage. Social Impact is the Center’s systemic commitment to the belief that the arts hold unique power in our society to build communities, center joy, inspire action, and drive meaningful change. Social Impact aims to leverage the arts for non-arts outcomes to advance justice and equity in all that we do.\n\n“Our work in Social Impact is most visible through our partnerships and programs, but most animated by our underlying commitment to the legacy of John F. Kennedy. Kennedy himself was a change agent with a magnetic social vision of equity across the American landscape”, says Marc Bamuthi Joseph, VP and Artistic Director of Social Impact. “Our investment in cultural leaders and brilliant creatives is an extension of Kennedy’s vision of a vibrant and diverse public imagination. We’re working hard to present an exciting impact season that leverages justice today with an eye on a transformative cultural future.”\n\nReturning this season are Community Partnerships, a one-year commitment intersecting with the Social Impact’s five pillars of community empowerment, artist empowerment, impact performance, cultural leadership, and REACH activation. Partnerships with The Armed Services Art Partnership, The Ferry Tales Project, Paula Brown Performing Arts Center, Washington Improv Theater, Washington Jazz Arts Institute, and The Recording Academy Washington D.C. Chapter will facilitate discussions and collaborate with Social Impact and other Programming departments at the Kennedy Center, including Dance, Theater, Jazz, Comedy, International Programs, and Hip Hop Culture and Contemporary Music. These partnerships will include artist workshops, panel discussions, performances, film screenings at the REACH, and collaborations with Social Impact’s standing programs, Millennium Stage, Office Hours, Local Theater Residencies, and Dance Sanctuaries.\n\nThe Culture Caucus is a cohort of 10 individuals and organizations, based in the D.C. area, who represent an ecology of cultural practice whose foothold is in the performing arts. The caucus for the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 seasons includes SMYAL, The 1882 Foundation, Miss Chief Rocka, Corazón Folklórico DC, Inc., District Running Collective, The Green Zone, Congress Heights Arts and Culture Center, Latinx History Project, Visionaries of the Creative Arts, and Shanthi Chandrasekar. Through the residency program, these culture makers will create and produce a variety of events that will take place at the REACH.\n\nThe Conflux aims to intertwine programming at the Center with a national organization also engaging in social impact-facing work. This past year’s programming, We the People’s Before, included a three day event and production in the Eisenhower Theater surrounding the First People’s Funds commitment to the past and future of Indigenous communities. This year’s programming will be presented by The Arab America Foundation (AAF), a nonprofit cultural and educational organization that promotes Arab heritage and educates Americans about Arab identity and Arab Americans across the US with other diverse organizations to counter social inequality. The initiative was established to dispel negative imagery directed against Arab Americans in the US and produce an accurate narrative that is non-biased in combating heightened hate crimes and bigotry. Programming this year includes three events in February featuring The National Arab Orchestra, Emad Batayeh, and an Arab Film & Media Institute Film Screening.\n\nImpactful Connections, a new partnership with the District of Columbia Public Libraries, focuses on creating access through transportation for D.C. residents to experience free local, national, and international arts and culture programming at the Kennedy Center. This program aims to lessen the barrier of getting to and from the Center by providing pick up and drop off locations at five participating District of Columbia Public Libraries across all four quadrants of the District. The partnership will launch on January 21, 2023.\n\nThis season also includes the Social Practice Residency, featuring individuals who engage in critical conversations about social change and artistic interactions. This year’s residents are Cristal Truscott, PhD—culture worker, scholar, educator, playwright, director, founder of the touring ensemble Progress Theatre, and creator of SoulWork; Elizabeth Rule, PhD—writer, public scholar, and advocate for Indigenous communities; and Kristina Wong—performance artist, comedian, writer elected representative, and Pulitzer Prize finalist in Drama.\n\nMillennium Stage will continue its commitment to accessible shows celebrating cultural heritage and the arts with live programming from Wednesday-Saturday. Live shows and events will take place on the Center’s North and South Millennium Stages as well as being live streamed on our Digital Stage. This season will also feature a new film series with screenings on Sundays at the REACH’s Justice Forum.\n\nOur Community Partners\n\nThe Armed Services Arts Partnership\n\nThe Armed Services Arts Partnership (ASAP) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and the largest community arts organization serving the military community in the U.S. ASAP fosters creative communities where veterans, service members, military family members, and caregivers thrive through the arts. Their free classes include stand-up comedy, storytelling, improv, creative writing, acting, and visual arts. Research demonstrates ASAP participants experience significant, lasting improvements in resilience, social connection, self-esteem, and integration of self.\n\nASAP Chapters are currently located in Washington, DC; Hampton Roads, VA; San Diego, CA; and Indianapolis, IN—and we are expanding nationally. In eight years, 2,000 individual veterans have participated in our classes and our alumni have performed for an estimated 150,000+ audience members, including shows at Carolines on Broadway, Warner Theater, and at The White House.\n\nThe Ferry Tales Project\n\nThe Ferry Tales Project is a collaboration with the International Programming department at the Kennedy Center, Caitlin Cassidy (Lead Artist), The Earth Commons—Georgetown University’s Institute for the Environment and Sustainability, and The Lab for Global Performance and Politics at Georgetown University.\n\nGeorgetown’s Earth Commons Institute is a hub for environmental and sustainability innovation, research and education to accelerate action on the most pressing issues of our earth. Assembling a team of interdisciplinary experts, researchers, leaders and students, the Earth Commons is transforming the university into a living laboratory to develop scalable solutions for a greener, more sustainable world.\n\nCaitlin Nasema Cassidy (Lead Artist, Ferry Tales Project) is an actor, director, and producer. Her practice is rooted in joy, embodied research, and (com)post-activism. She is committed to telling stories by/about/with women, the peoples and places from which she originates, and the more-than-human. She is the recipient of a 2022 National Performance Network Creation Fund Award. Caitlin serves as Co-Artistic Director of LubDub Theatre Co. and is the 2022-23 Artist-in-Residence at The Earth Commons—Georgetown University’s Institute for the Environment and Sustainability.\n\nA joint initiative of the Theater and Performance Studies Program and the School of Foreign Service, the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics at Georgetown University (The Lab) is led by Professors Derek Goldman and Cynthia P. Schneider. Building upon Georgetown’s strengths in the areas of theatrical performance and international politics, the Lab is a resource center that brings together in public dialogue an expansive global network of artists, policymakers, scholars, cultural organizations, embassies, faculty, students, and audiences.\n\nPaula Brown Performing Arts Center\n\nAn accomplished dancer, singer, actress, choreographer, professor, author and certified Vaganova Instructor. Brown appeared on Broadway, television and film and is a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), American Federation of Television and Radio Association (AFTRA), and Actors Equity Association (AEA). In 2013, Brown established the Paula Brown Performing Arts Center (PBPAC) and Brown Ballerinas company. The mission is to uplift girls of color by addressing inadequate access to classical ballet training in minority communities. Promoting the study of classical ballet as the footing for PBPAC and her Brown Ballerinas company, she spread her wings into the Prince George’s County community as a facilitator of after school performing arts enrichment and community outreach programing in several public charter and private schools. She is compelled by her love for her community to help youth of the dance and performing arts in Prince George’s County Maryland.\n\nWashington Improv Theater\n\nCurrently celebrating its 25th anniversary season, Washington Improv Theater (WIT) is dedicated to sharing the creative, collaborative power of longform improvisation in Washington, D.C. As the District’s premier nonprofit improv theater, WIT is guided by the belief that improv is for everyone.\n\nRe-founded in 1998, they serve thousands annually through affordable or free performances. For the 2022-23 season, WIT is a resident company at Studio Theatre. This residency will include two debut shows: Not a Pyramid Scheme, which satires the scam-ridden multi-level marketing industry, and Tumbleweed!, a light-hearted Western.\n\nWIT shares their craft in the community via multiple community partnerships, offering after-school programming in partnership with DC Public Schools, Project Create, and Sitar Arts Center, as well as classes for veterans and women experiencing homelessness. WIT's workplace training program WIT@Work teaches clients how the skills used in successful improv can help people in the workplace as well. Clients include nonprofits, corporations, and government agencies. In addition to their multi-level eight-week classes, WIT runs regular Improv for All workshops; these free two-hour workshops are opportunities for newcomers to try improv in a safe environment.\n\nWashington Jazz Arts Institute\n\nThe Washington Jazz Arts Institute (WJAI) was founded in 1998 by Davey Yarborough and his wife Esther Williams to further his dream of teaching music in a nurturing, mentoring atmosphere. A natural outgrowth of Davey’s success at The Duke Ellington School of the Arts in DC, this dream was born of a desire to inspire young people into careers in music.\n\nTheir mission and commitment is to the education, presentation and documentation of Jazz Music in and for the Washington, DC community. The Institute is devoted to the preservation of the past, the promotion of the present and preparation for the future of Jazz in DC. The Institute will work to firmly fix through oral and written history the contribution of Jazz music to the cultural and social development of Washington, DC, and the contribution of Washington musicians to the creation of this uniquely American music form. The Institute has developed a city-wide musical outreach and education program in support of a Jazz orchestra which will expand opportunities for the appreciation of live Jazz in the area and enhance the training and performance opportunities for young musicians.\n\nRecording Academy Washington D.C. Chapter\n\nThe Washington, D.C. Chapter of the Recording Academy® engages the wide-ranging communities in Maryland, Virginia and the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Working with varied genres including rock, Latin, hip-hop, R&B, go-go, gospel, folk, classical, and jazz, the D.C.

Since 1984, SMYAL has worked to meet the needs of LGBTQ youth through affirming programs, housing support, accessible mental health services, leadership training, and community outreach.\n\nSMYAL’s innovative programs are unique both locally and nationally.

Open to all levels of runners, we have built a community of people around a common goal: pushing past perceived limits and becoming better every day through running and supporting one another.\n\nThe Green Zone\n\nThe Green Zone is DC’s first and only standalone Middle Eastern Cocktail Bar. The winner of several local awards and recipient of national acclaim, what began as a pop-up in 2014 has now been a permanent DC establishment for over 4 years, representing the flavors and cultures of the Middle East through its drinks, food, decor, music, and entertainment.\n\nTaking inspiration from owner Chris Hassaan Francke’s heritage and travel experiences in the region, The Green Zone shines a spotlight on the rich and varied flavors, scents, and sounds of the Middle East through its cocktails. Even the design of the bar was heavily influenced by the region. The walls downstairs feature vintage Arabic and Turkish coffee pots and travel posters, the bartop showcases Moroccan zellij tile. Upstairs, the walls are covered in framed Arabic, Turkish, and Persian records.\n\nTrue to the bar’s roots as a pop-up, not only does it host others, but The Green Zone’s main form of promotion is to travel and hold events across the country and around the world, with pop-ups and takeovers from New York to New Orleans, San Juan to London.\n\nCongress Heights Arts and Cultural Center\n\nCongress Heights Arts and Culture Center is a 501 (c)(3) organization with a mission to expose, inspire + educate both youth + adults to the rich arts + cultural opportunities, specifically in Wards 7 + 8, from a historical and modern day prospective.\n\nCHACC was established to the explore arts + culture of people of the African Diaspora, specifically, communities of African Americans, residing East of the Anacostia River. CHACC’s purpose is to develop and expand cultural and artistic opportunities for their residents and one of the highest priorities is to weave children and youth into the fabric of the economic revitalization occurring in the communities within Wards 7 and 8. CHACC is not just a home to East of the River creatives but home full of legacy. Formerly the residence and business space of the Executive Director's father, the arts and culture center serves as a tangible example of black ownership, generational success and cultural legacy\n\nLatinx History Project\n\nIn 2000, the Latinx History Project, formerly known as the Latino GLBT History Project, was founded to collect, preserve, and share Latinx LQBTQ history. The Latinx History Project now celebrates over twenty years of meaningful service to the Latinx LGBTQ community, and a major milestone as it launches new Latinx Education Workshops with a Digital Resource-hub. We continue to be a pillar for their community in D.C. as the organization that hosts all DC Latinx Pride events and festivities during pride month as well as various other gatherings and events throughout the year. Since the Covid-19 Pandemic disproportionately affected their community, the organization also stepped up in the last three years to raise funding for and build unity amongst grassroots Latinx LGBTQ organizations spanning the continental United States and various Latin American countries as their third program area.\n\nVisionaries of the Creative Arts\n\nVisionaries of the Creative Arts (VOCA), a nonprofit organization based in Washington, DC, was established in July 2019 by Michelle Banks, the visionary leader and Artistic Director and Nayte Paxton, co-founder and Associate Artistic Director, in response to the critical need to support the works of the D/deaf and hard-of-hearing BlPOC artists locally and nationwide. After Banks directed Gallaudet University’s spring 2018 production, she realized what was missing--a permanent home for local artists. When Banks shared her vision to present a platform for D/deaf and hard-of-hearing Black, Indigenous, and People of Color artists to create, collaborate, and showcase their culturally distinct work through theater, dance, poetry, music, film, and storytelling in American Sign Language (ASL) and Black American Sign Language with Nayte Paxton, both of them eagerly agreed to make the vision come true by embarking on the establishment of VOCA. As a result, Visionaries of the Creative Arts –VOCA was born! The Deaf/HHBIPOC community and its artists have been overlooked and underrepresented in mainstream Deaf culture, a form of social injustice that VOCA stands to redress.\n\nShanthi Chandrasekar\n\nShanthi Chandrasekar is an Indian-American multimedia, multidisciplinary artist based in Maryland. She has an academic background in Physics and Psychology, and has been trained in the traditional art forms of Kolam and Tanjore-style painting. While many of her works are influenced by her Indian heritage, her true inspiration comes from the mystery and majesty of the world around her; her muse lives where the scientific overlaps with the spiritual.\n\nShanthi has won numerous awards for her work including Individual Artist Awards and grants from the Maryland State Arts Council and the Arts and Humanities Council of Montgomery County, as well as the Maryland Traditions Folklife Apprenticeship Grants to teach Kolam. She designed the Kolam concept for the 2021 Kolam Project that involved community participation from around the USA, to install a 1,950-tile Kolam in front of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.\n\nHer artwork is in the DC Art Bank, Montgomery Public Art, and other collections. Shanthi has exhibited, participated and presented her work at several galleries and institutions including Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Gandhi Memorial Center, the Smithsonian and most recently at American University's Katzen Center and the Art on Paper 2022 NYC. Apart from exhibiting her artwork, Shanthi also illustrates books and teaches art. Juxtaposing various fields like science and math, with abstract and traditional arts, and experimenting with media to communicate her thoughts and ideas to audiences from all walks of life is the essence of Shanthi's work.\n\nThe 1882 Foundation\n\nEstablished in 2012, the 1882 Foundation’s founding mission is to educate the public about the Chinese Exclusion Laws, their history, and their continued significance to all Americans. The Foundation fulfills this mission through four program areas: collecting oral histories of Chinese and Asian Americans and preserving their story sites; developing curriculum and resources for public educators; promoting collaboration and best practices among Asian American museums and historical societies; and providing a platform for literary and artistic exploration among Asian American youth.\n\nThe Foundation emerged from a successful national grassroots effort by a coalition of five national Asian American organizations calling for a Congressional apology for the Chinese Exclusion Laws and related racist provisions. Though the Senate and House unanimously passed resolutions of regret in 2011 and 2012, respectively, anti-Asian sentiment and discrimination continue today, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs Chinese and Asian Americans face new challenges, the 1882 Foundation is committed to increasing the visibility of Asian American communities and celebrating their achievements as integral constituents of the United States. Locally, the Foundation addresses the changing needs of Chinese and Asian Americans around Washington, D.C., by working to build and support D.C.’s Chinatown as a vibrant cultural and educational hub for thinkers, creators and activists. Nationally, the 1882 Foundation is a leading voice of efforts in AAPI curriculum inclusion, the recognition of landmarks and monuments of Asian American history, and the mobilization of museum and other archival organizations to form a dynamic network that brings Asian American stories and experiences to the American public.\n\nConflux Programing\n\nJoin the Arab America Foundation (AAF) and the Kennedy Center as we celebrate Arab heritage and highlight the contributions of Arab Americans to America with three days of performances, art, and film screenings.\n\nTaking Back Our Narrative\n\nPresented in collaboration with the Arab America Foundation, Taking Back Our Narrative speaks to the fullness and diversity of the Arab American experience, values, and cultural landscape throughout the United States. “The root causes of racism directed against Arab Americans are linked heavily to orientalism, colonialism, popular literature, stereotyping in films, misrepresentation in textbooks, negative coverage in the mass media, and political rhetoric.” says Warren David, co-founder of the Arab America Foundation, “There is a fundamental need for this marginalized community to take back their narrative and to increase awareness of their accomplishments and the contributions of Arab Americans to America.\"\n\nProgram Details\n\nConflux Presents: The National Arab Orchestra\n\nThe Kennedy Center Eisenhower Theater\n\nFriday February 17 at 8:00pm\n\nFounded in 2009, the National Arab Orchestra, (NAO), a nonprofit, is dedicated to elevating and preserving Arab culture and musical traditions in the United States and beyond through performance, education, outreach, and collaboration.

These concerts bring the beauty of Arab music to entirely new and diverse audiences.\n\nConflux Presents: Emad Batayeh\n\nMillennium Stage Grand Foyer\n\nSaturday, February 18 at 6:00pm\n\nEmad Batayeh is one of the leading Arab vocalists in the United States.
