        "text": "To find books on American literature in our collection, you can search by Subject in our Primo VE catalog using the “Advanced Search” function to the right of the search bar. Select “Subject” in the drop-down menu of search features in place of “Any field,” then copy-and-paste one of the following subject headings:\n\nAmerican literature\n\nAmerican poetry\n\nAuthors, American\n\nFolklore United States [or state or region name]\n\nPoets, American\n\nYou may also search by title or author, if either of these is known.\n\nResults can be filtered by Material Type, Language, Date, Author, Title, etc. prior to searching by using the drop-down menus in the search panel. If your search produces too many options, you can also narrow results using the faceted options on the left-hand side, under the heading “Refine your results.” Clicking on one of these filter terms or the box to their left will limit results to only those that fit this criterion, while clicking on the red box to the right of the term will exclude those results.\n\nFor those items listed as on the 3rd floor Reference shelves, you might also consider looking at the call numbers around those books, since there should be materials dealing with similar topics nearby. For more information about searching in our online catalog, please see our Guide to Primo VE.\n\nWilla Cather Collections\n\nThe Newberry has a rich collection of manuscripts, photographs, printed materials, periodicals, and ephemera related to Chicago and Midwestern writers. The library has collected material related to Willa Cather since the 1950s. For more items by, about, and relevant to Cather, see the Newberry’s Willa Cather Collections page.\n\nChildren's Books\n\nThe Newberry has an extraordinary and wide-ranging children’s book collection. The collection includes fiction, folklore, classical literature, poetry, children’s textbooks, and primers, as well as secondary literature such as literary criticism, bibliographies, and biographical resources.\n\nThe Newberry’s Online Catalog is the best place to check for works related to children’s literature. If you are looking for a particular author or title, search under these headings first. Checklists, bibliographies, and other reference works (see below) may help you identify likely authors, titles, publishers, and series.\n\nPlease note: The Newberry does not present the John Newbery Medal. This award is given by the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC), a division of the American Library Association.\n\nThe following are a sampling of reference/secondary sources related specifically to American children’s literature:\n\nAvery, Gillian. Behold the Child: American Children and Their Books, 1621-1922. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994. Location: General Collection 2nd floor. Call Number: Wing PS 490 .A99 1994.\n\nCrain, Patricia. The Story of A: The Alphabetization of America from The New England Primer to The Scarlet Letter. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2000.

Call Number: Ref BJ 1547 .N48 1994.\n\nFictionalized Slave Narratives\n\nThe antislavery movement in the nineteenth century generated a number of narratives about slavery, some widely read, which were subsequently revealed to be fictitious or heavily fictionalized though sometimes based on an actual case or person.\n\nIf you know the author or title (check the North American Slave Narratives online bibliography), search using those commands from the main catalog search page. You may also search using the following subject headings:\n\nSlavery—Fiction\n\nWomen Slaves—Fiction\n\nFugitive Slaves—Fiction\n\nSlavery—United States—Fiction\n\nSlaves—United States—Fiction\n\nHarriet Beecher Stowe and Uncle Tom's Cabin\n\nThe Newberry owns several interesting items related to Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin, including sheet music, plays, ballets, and translations. To find these items in the online catalog, you can search in the Author field for “Stowe, Harriet Beecher, 1811-1896,” or in the Title field for “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”\n\nHerman Melville Collection\n\nPerhaps the largest collection of Melville material in existence, the Newberry’s Herman Melville Collection was originally assembled to support the work of the editorial staff of The Writings of Herman Melville, a project established by Professor Harrison Hayford of Northwestern University. Professor Hayford's personal library formed the core of the collection, and it has been greatly augmented by purchases and gifts. Among the large gifts are translations donated by Leland Phelps; the Melville collection of Dr. James A. FitzSimmons, a Chicago dentist and bibliophile; and the Moby Dick collection of Professor H. Howard Hughes.\n\nThe Melville Collection is nearly complete in its holdings of editions issued during Melville's lifetime and extensive in editions and printings from his death to the present; collected works and selections; periodicals to which he contributed; anthologies published during his lifetime that include Melville's writings; translations; books entirely or partially about Melville; dissertations; a representative collection of anthologies and textbooks containing Melville; anthologies that one would expect to include Melville but do not; books on whaling; books Melville used as source material; books drawing on Melville for their titles or epigrams; books of which Melville owned a copy; and Melville titles in other formats, e.g. comic books, Braille, audio tapes, etc.\n\nThe Newberry’s Online Catalog is the best place to check for items by and about Herman Melville. However, some items remain uncatalogued; contact a librarian if you are interested in using this collection."
