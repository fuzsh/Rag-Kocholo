        "text": "Raúl Grijalva (2022)\n\nGrijalva has served as a U.S. Representative from Arizona since 2003. He chaired the House Natural Resources Committee from 2019 to 2023 and is currently the committee’s ranking member. In addition, he has been the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands since 2007. He was a principal architect of the bipartisan John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of 2019, which permanently protected more than two million acres of lands and waters, including nearly 1.3 million acres of wilderness, and permanently reauthorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In addition, he helped pass the Great American Outdoors Act of 2020, which made funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund permanent. Grijalva has been a stalwart champion of Native American and Indigenous rights, introducing legislation that strengthens tribal engagement and involvement in public lands decision-making, and he as fought to update outdated mining and drilling laws to ensure justice for the communities impacted by harmful and destructive resource extraction on federal lands.\n\nJerry Brown (2019)\n\nBrown served as the 34th and 39th Governor of California, from 1975 to 1983 and from 2011 to 2019. Prior to that, he served as California’s Secretary of State, mayor of Oakland, and Attorney General of California. While in the governor’s office, Brown passed some of the most ambitious climate policies in the country. In 1976, he signed the nation’s first tax incentive for rooftop solar and established the South Coast Air Quality Management District to address air pollution in the Los Angeles region. During his most recent stint as governor, he set a goal to put 5 million electric cars on the road by 2030, implemented a gas tax to fund $50 billion in repairs to roads and bridges over 10 years, established a new regional groundwater sustainability agency, and extended California’s cap-and-trade program, which has raised $4 billion for clean energy, electric cars, and high-speed rail.\n\nDianne Feinstein (2016)\n\nA former mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988, Feinstein has served as a U.S. Senator from California since 1992.

Among them, she authored and passed the California Desert Protection and Recreation Act as part of the 2019 Public Lands package (the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act). This bill built upon the legacy of her landmark legislation, the California Desert Protection Act of 1994, which created 7.6 million acres of desert wilderness, the 1.6 million-acres Mojave National Preserve, and Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Parks. In 2016, she helped further expand protections for the desert by championing President Obama’s designation of the Sand to Snow, Mojave Trails, and Castle Mountains National Monuments. She also led efforts to restore Lake Tahoe, secured funding to fight drought and flooding in California, and helped pass six other laws that projected almost 400,000 acres.\n\nJohn Podesta (2015)\n\nPodesta had a hand in the environmental achievements of two presidential administrations. As White House Chief of Staff to President Clinton from 1998 to 2001, he advocated for 19 national monuments and conservation areas, and helped maneuver the 2001 Roadless Rule into law, protecting 58 million acres administered by the U.S. Forest Service. He returned to the White House under the Obama administration, serving informally as an advisor and formally as Counselor to the president (2014-2015), where he helped champion the creation or expansion of 29 national monuments. Podesta currently serves as Senior Advisor to President Biden for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation, a role which he has held since September 2022.\n\nMax Baucus (2014)\n\nAs a U.S. Senator from Montana from 1978 to 2014, Baucus served on the Committee on Environment and Public Works and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.

He also prioritized the responsible development of renewable energy, greenlighting the development of over 11,000 megawatts of renewable energy on public lands.\n\nBruce Babbitt (2011)\n\nAfter serving as Governor of Arizona from 1978 to 1987 and leading the League of Conservation Voters for eight years, Babbitt became the 47th U.S. Secretary of the Interior in 1993 under President Clinton, fulfilling that role until 2001. As Secretary, he participated in the creation of 22 new national monuments, from Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah to Giant Sequoia in California. In 2000, he created the National Landscape Conservation System (now known as the National Conservation Lands), giving the Bureau of Land Management a way to manage its most significant landscapes, which today include 29 national monuments and 17 national conservation areas. Babbitt also led the creation of the Pacific Northwest Forest Management Plan, the restoration of the Florida Everglades, the passage of the California Desert Protection Act, the implementation of a new federal wild land fire policy, renewed support for the Endangered Species Act, as well as the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone National Park.\n\nMichael Dombeck (2010)\n\nDombeck dedicated a quarter-century to managing federal lands and natural resources with an impact on nearly 500 million acres of public lands. The only person to date to lead America’s two largest land management agencies—the Bureau of Land Management (Acting Director from 1994 to1997) and the U.S. Forest Service (Chief from 1997 to 2001)—he is most recognized for forging partnerships and crafting policies that integrated economics, science, and watershed protection to manage federal lands in the long-term public interest. At the BLM, he worked to increase accessibility to public lands for users and to promote ecosystem-based management and watershed restoration. At the USFS, he led the development of The Natural Resource Agenda for the agency.
