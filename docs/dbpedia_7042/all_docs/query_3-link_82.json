        "text": "Earl Armstrong began his 52-year affiliation with the YMCA in 1940 as the Boys’ Work secretary in Louisville (Ky.). He established and ran Camp Piomingo for seven years and later became the association-wide program–and then associate– general secretary. In 1953, he moved to the Central Atlantic staff as associate secretary and camp director, eventually assuming regional portfolios for personnel and camping.\n\nIn 1960, Armstrong was awarded the first John R. Mott Fellowship, allowing him to pursue a year of full-time graduate studies at Columbia University. He served as the associate secretary for the Personnel Services Division of the National Council of YMCAs, and then moved to Charlotte as the executive director of the Interstate YMCA of the Carolinas.\n\nHe remained in a consulting role in the southeast until his retirement in 1982. Upon his retirement, the Armstrong Scholarship was established to enable YMCA senior directors to pursue graduate study. In retirement, Armstrong served as a volunteer personnel specialist for the YMCAs. He was the architect of the YMCA Salary Administration Plan, and was responsible for the implementation of the salary program through most of the YMCAs in the United States.\n\nLloyd Arnold was a youth member of the York (Pa.) YMCA. He served in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946, where he worked with amputees in the Medical Corps. After his military service, he received his undergraduate degree from Springfield College. He later earned his doctorate from Pennsylvania State University.\n\nArnold’s first full time YMCA position was as physical education director at the Canton (Ohio) YMCA. He served in the Rochester (N.Y.) association, prior to joining the Central Atlantic Area staff as the associate executive for health and physical education. In 1968, he was named on the national staff as the national director for health, physical education, and sports.\n\nUnder his leadership, there was significant growth in the complexity and breadth in the health and wellness field. Arnold emphasized the individual’s responsibility for their own health as a central philosophy in YMCA programs. He redeveloped the YMCA Aquatic Program and introduced a comprehensive structure for YMCA youth basketball. When he retired in 1981, he was recognized as one of the 10 people in the country chosen for the Healthy American Fitness Leader Award.\n\nWilliam M. Barnhardt is one of two volunteers being inducted into the class of 2013, the first official recognition of volunteers within the history of the YMCA Hall of Fame since John D. Rockefeller, Jr. whose $1,000,000 contribution helped capitalize the YMCA Retirement Fund. A champion of the Y movement, William Barnhardt’s legacy of volunteer service spans more than 50 years and stands as a shining example of servant leadership.\n\nBarnhardt’s service on the board of directors and board of trustees for the YMCA of Greater Charlotte dates back to the 1960s. Understanding that the Y’s mission is best served through passionate people, Barnhardt committed himself to the recruitment and development of staff and volunteer leadership. As chairman of the Executive Search Committee, Barnhardt recruited Harry H. Brace, posthumously inducted into the YMCA Hall of Fame, to serve as president of the association in 1983. As a result of that appointment and his collaboration with executive leadership throughout the years, the Y movement surged in Charlotte, and remains one of the nation’s most successful YMCAs today. Barnhardt is admired by volunteers and staff who have patterned their own service after his example.\n\nBarnhardt’s vision to revolutionize the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly is one of his most enduring contributions to advancing the Y movement. Built in 1906 as a Christian conference center, the facility was beleaguered by a 30-year financial crisis and operated only during the summer. Barnhardt immediately recognized the assembly’s historical significance and its potential to serve new Y members, families, and guests across the southeast region. In 1968, Barnhardt spearheaded a $5,000,000 capital campaign to fund the facility’s expansion. By 1970, as a result of his pioneering efforts, the assembly was transformed into a robust, debt-free, year-round enterprise. The 1,200-acre facility now serves more than 30,000 guests annually and is an important resource to YMCAs and organizations throughout the southeastern United States and beyond.\n\nBarnhardt has built a heritage of giving, volunteerism and advocacy for the Y within his family, heralding new generations of servant leaders. Simply put, he defines the Y movement. In the great tradition of George Williams, Barnhardt has the ability to recognize a societal need and fully commit himself, then inspire others, to meet it. He welcomes those not affiliated with the YMCA to join the movement, and encourages current supporters and members to deepen their commitment. His service merits historic record and his induction underscores the sacred partnership between volunteer and staff members to serve the mission.\n\nErnest Best joined the Ontario YMCA as a youth member in the early 1900s. He received his bachelor’s degree from the International YMCA College (now Springfield College) in 1911, and then took on roles at both the West Side Branch YMCA in New York City and as a faculty member at Springfield College.\n\nHe served as a senior officer in the Canadian YMCA War Services in France during WWI. After the war, he returned to the West Side YMCA and enrolled in the doctoral program at New York University. He received an appointment to teach theology at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and helped found the Sir George Williams University in Montreal in 1928. Best set up courses to train YMCA staff and served as the director for the Far East International Survey of YMCAs and YWCAs.\n\nReturning from overseas, he was appointed general secretary of the National Council of the YMCAs of Canada. In 1937, Best was inaugurated as the president of Springfield College. He emphasized the traditions of Springfield College including liberal interpretation of Christianity; the education of the whole person; a continued connection with the YMCA; professional training for youth services staff; international student exchange; racial and religious tolerance; and a continuing emphasis on health, physical education, and recreation.\n\nFrom her service as office manager for the YMCA of San Diego starting in 1972 to finishing her Y career there 30 years later as vice president of Human Resources, Bea Betterton-Halk pioneered modern-day human resources in the Y movement. Betterton-Halk was a vocal advocate for creating strong networks of human resource leaders across the country. Specifically, she paved the way for all Ys from operating with essentially a clerical human resources position to a more strategic approach that featured best practices to meet organizational objectives. She was the driving force behind the formation of the largest human resource nationwide network: the North American Urban Group Human Resource Officers. She was known for many selfless acts, including using her vacation and personal time and investing her own resources to introduce others to training opportunities and scholarships. Betterton-Halk immigrated from Tijuana, Mexico when she was eight and endured some personal hardships, including the passing of her father when she was a teen, all of which strengthened her resolve to be a leader and advocate for multicultural awareness in the Y Movement. Additionally, she attained an M.S. in Human Service Administration and Organizational Development from Springfield College while working two jobs and raising five kids and was a presenter at graduation. Upon her retirement in 2002, the North American Urban Group Human Resource Officers instituted a perpetual award entitled the Bea Betterton-Halk Human Resources Career Excellence award, which honors retiring H.R. officers who meet criteria.\n\nAnthony Bowen (1805-1872), was a former slave who organized the first African-American YMCA in 1853. That was the Twelfth Street YMCA in Washington, D.C., later named YMCA Anthony Bowen and designated a National Historic Landmark. Inspired by his friend William Chauncey Langdon, founder of the YMCA of the City of Washington, Bowen was committed to the advancement of African-Americans in social, educational, and religious respects. Bowen’s YMCA grew out of his efforts to organize the African-American community of Washington D.C. In 1839, he sponsored “The Colored Peoples Meeting House,” a meeting space for the free African-Americans of the city. In 1847 he opened a Sunday evening school for free men where they studied reading, writing, and the bible. For nearly the first 40 years after its founding in 1853, the “Colored” YMCA existed independent of the white YMCA in Washington, and their activities were restricted to meetings in rented space, donated rooms, and members’ living rooms. With determination and dedication, YMCA Anthony Bowen was reorganized as a branch of the YMCA of the City of Washington in 1905. Bowen, the first African-American employee of the U.S. Patent Office, was also instrumental in founding St. Paul AME Church.\n\nThe first step toward creating a centralized agency to coordinate the work of YMCAs was called the Executive Committee, established in 1864. The second chairman of that committee was a lawyer named Cephas Brainerd, who served from 1867-1892. In this unpaid position, Brainerd exerted enormous influence over the direction of the YMCA movement, advocating for an evangelical emphasis and an inclusive stance on race. Initially hesitant to commit to developing overseas YMCAs, Brainerd eventually became a forceful advocate for foreign work. Under his leadership, a system of traveling national secretaries was instituted to work with local associations, an early version of later field systems in the YMCA of the USA.\n\nAlthough he was a man with conservative views, Brainerd advised against setting up racially separate divisions in the YMCA and foresaw an arrangement where whites and blacks would participate together in YMCA state conventions during a period when the YMCA was divided over how to serve African-Americans. As an attorney, he successfully represented a group of African-Americans whose property had been damaged in rioting. He is regarded as a major force in the first generation of truly national YMCA leaders.\n\nEarl Brandenburg began his lifetime affiliation with the YMCA as a teen member of the La Crosse (Wis.) YMCA. As a 20-year-old, he was employed as the Boys’ Work secretary in Wausau, Wisconsin. He was involved in YMCA War Work in San Antonio (Texas) and Michigan before enlisting in the Navy.\n\nAfter the war, he served as the town and country secretary for the Wisconsin State Committee, and later, as the Chicago-based regional Boys’ Work secretary on the national staff. In 1927, Brandenburg was named regional executive in Chicago and organized the system of area councils to coordinate the work of National Council and state committees. Six years later, as the associate general secretary of the National Council, he supported the continued development of area organizations throughout the U.S. and implemented a new percentage financing formula.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1940, Brandenburg served as general secretary of the St. Louis County (Mo.) YMCA. He was appointed director of the YMCA Retirement Fund in 1940, and was responsible for revamping the operations and increasing the investments of the Fund, which had suffered in the Great Depression. Under his leadership, the Fund gained stability and its assets grew from $18 million to $103 million. Brandenburg was a trustee of both Springfield College and George Williams College.\n\nElwood Brown began his YMCA career at the Salt Lake City Association in 1908 as the director of athletics, and in 1910, he was sent to the Manila YMCA. He was the first director of athletics in Manila and successfully introduced several American group games, such as volleyball and baseball. The Governor-General described baseball as “the most valuable unifying influence at work among the widely different peoples.” The program is a result of Brown’s leadership with the YMCA.\n\nBeyond the introduction of American group sports in the Philippines, Brown more notably organized the Far Eastern Games, “the most important athletic event in [Asia]” at the time (from the YMCA biographical files, Kautz Family YMCA Archives.). After the success of the first four Far Eastern Games, Brown petitioned the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the Far Eastern Games, The Pan American Games (the South American International Games), and the Indian Empire Games to be included in the IOC’s scope of influence under their “All Sports for All” program. Subsequently, athletes from the Far Eastern Games began competing at the Olympic Games.\n\nBrown and the YMCA athletic department also worked with the Army in France to set up a program for athletics during the Armistice period. It included mass athletics and competition for every man, American Expeditionary Force athletic championships, demonstrations of American sports to the French, and finally, it established the Inter-Allied Games.\n\nHarry Crowe Buck is considered by the YMCA to be the “Father of Modern Physical Education in India” having founded the profession of physical education in India as a Y ambassador from the International Committee of the YMCA in the United States. Buck had graduated from Springfield College (International YMCA College) in 1917. On a mission of humanity, he and his wife Marie C. Buck went to India in 1919 and organized the YMCA Physical Education College in Madras, India with the purpose of promoting the Springfield College core values by educating and empowering young Indian leaders in the field of physical education and sports in India. Buck was the adviser to the Madras government on physical education and both he and his wife received the Kaiser-i-Hind medal in 1932 awarded by the British Monarch for public service. Buck founded the Indian Olympic Associations, the first public playground in Indian cities, the first YMCA College of Physical Education for the training of teachers of physical education, introduced physical education as an integral part of the school and college curriculum, introduced coaching in games and sports, and he was the first coach to accompany an Indian team for the Olympic Games in 1924 in Paris.\n\nJohn Casey has had a profound impact on the YMCA movement, both as the president of the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago and then as the secretary general of the World Alliance of YMCAs where he was able to act on his unique global passion and vision for the YMCA movement. His commitment to addressing social issues in one’s community started with his work as the vice president of program development and government relations for the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago. In this role he had primary responsibility for developing and coordinating $15 million annually in state and municipal contracts to support much needed social programs including childcare for low-income families, higher education, juvenile delinquency, adult and youth employment, community health initiatives, drug and alcohol counseling, and various housing programs. He also advised the State of Illinois General Assembly on making improvements and addressing the enforcement of collections for delinquent child support, child abuse prevention, reforms to the state’s Medicare system, and many other initiatives to support children and families.\n\nAfter bringing the Chicago Y from financial peril, Casey went on to serve the World Alliance of YMCAs in Geneva, Switzerland, as secretary general. This was a significant honor in the history of the YMCA movement as he was the first Roman-Catholic and first local YMCA executive to ever hold the post, as well as being the first American in that post in 35 years. In this role he expanded the YMCA’s refugee and disaster relief efforts, integrated women into worldwide leadership roles in the YMCA, led the campaign to ban landmines, and created pathways for conflict resolution and community transformation through YMCA led efforts around the world. His greatest legacy is the focus on youth work in the worldwide YMCA movement, which still echoes around the globe with the International Youth Internship Program and the Global Youth Leadership Program. Casey was a mentor to literally hundreds of youth leaders around the world through the Young Professionals Forum with his passion of meeting and motivating youth to build a new generation of global YMCA leaders. As his term of office ended in 1998, under his initiative, the Mission Review Process was passed at the 14th World Council in Frechen, Germany, which gave the world movement a newly formulated mission statement called Challenge 21. The mission states, “Affirming the Paris Basis adopted in 1855 as the ongoing foundation statement of the mission of the YMCA, at the threshold of the third millennium we declare that the YMCA is a world-wide Christian, ecumenical, voluntary movement for women and men with special emphasis on and the genuine involvement of young people and that it seeks to share the Christian ideal of building a human community of justice with love, peace and reconciliation for the fullness of life for all creation.”\n\nGeorge Corsan is credited with the introduction of the massed method of swimming instruction, rhythmic breathing, the back crawl stroke, and the fear elimination drill, among other accomplishments.\n\nBefore the introduction of swimming lessons, it was estimated that 25% of the U.S. population did not know how to swim, causing more than 7,000 to die by accidental drowning. The YMCA recognized a need for uniform swimming lessons in the United States and put Corsan in charge of teaching people from all walks of life how to swim. He went to nearly every city in the United States, advertising his one week of five intensive class sessions at local YMCAs. “His land drills developed movement coordination; water wings provided support while practicing crawl stroke movements and breath control.” [Quote from Corsan’s book, At Home in the Water, 1910 Association Press]. In Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1913, 800 boys were given swim instruction in one week. And after just two lessons with Corsan, more than 200 had learned to swim 50 feet without assistance.\n\nIn just 20 years, Corsan’s system of swimming instruction was universally adopted and followed in the United States, Canada, Australia, and South America, where he was also involved in the designing and implementation of swimming pools. People and organizations worldwide, including the U.S. Army, used his teaching methods to expand access to swimming education.\n\nToday, the YMCA is considered “America’s Swim Instructor,” and tens of millions of people have learned to swim thanks to Corsan’s methods and implementation.\n\nSolon Cousins began working with the YMCA in 1954 as the director of personnel and planning of the Chicago (Ill.) YMCA. Twelve years later, he moved to the YMCA of Greater Boston (Mass.) as the executive director. His $2.5 million capital campaign helped build a new facility, expand four older branches, and purchase a camp.\n\nHe also created an innovative program that addressed personnel, program, and facility development. In 1970, Cousins became the National Board’s associate executive director and the first executive of the Urban Group. Under his leadership, a national health insurance program was developed and the Standards of Excellence for Urban Metro YMCA’s were established. He joined the United Way of Metropolitan Chicago as its executive director in 1974. Cousins was named national executive director of the YMCA of the USA in 1980, and for 10 years led a period of dramatic change.\n\nUnder his leadership, the national system was completely reorganized under a new constitution. Dues were lowered for member associations, the budget was balanced, the national office was moved to Chicago, the Y-Mutual Insurance Company was created, the fight against tax challenges was implemented, and the dramatic expansion of YMCA child care programs was supported. Cousins was a trustee of Springfield College, George Williams College, and the YMCA Retirement Fund. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Springfield College and the University of Richmond.\n\nDuring World War I, Hedley Dimock suffered near-fatal wounds when he fell on top of a German grenade to save the lives of his fellow soldiers. The Nova Scotia native survived-and thrived-years later to eventually become a dynamic teacher, trainer, and mentor of YMCA professional staff in group work, outdoor education, and character development. With a penchant for writing, Dimock penned Rediscovering the Adolescent, which broke new ground in social research and changed the approach to developing YMCA programs from the 1930s through the 1950s. His Camping and Character book is considered an influential treatise on camping. Dimock has been described as someone who was “as much a prophet as he was a scientist.” One of his most significant roles was that of a change agent for the YMCA, as he made a huge impact on the development of YMCA secretaries at home and abroad. At the end of his YMCA career, Dimock served as the director of training and leadership development at the YMCA of San Francisco, where he redesigned that program.\n\nLaurence Doggett’s first involvement with the YMCA was with the Student YMCA at Oberlin College in Ohio. He served one year with the State YMCA of Ohio, before leaving to pursue a doctorial degree at the University of Leipzig (Germany). His thesis at Leipzig was the history of the YMCA, subsequently published as “The History of the Young Men’s Christian Association.” Doggett was appointed Secretary of the State YMCA of Ohio upon his return to the United States.\n\nIn 1896, he became president of the International YMCA Training School (now Springfield College), where he served for 40 years. Under Doggett’s leadership, the School became known for its liberal religious teachings and for training leaders both inside and outside the YMCA. During his time as president, the College’s “Humanics” philosophy, which calls for the education of the whole person — in spirit, mind, and body — for leadership in service to humanity, was implemented. The philosophy still guides the College today. Doggett also ran four capital campaigns to establish and build the present-day campus and to create an endowment.\n\nIn addition to his work at Springfield College, Doggett also served as “principal” of the YMCA Summer Institutes at the Silver Bay (N.Y.) association, attracting up to 600 Y secretaries for summer training.\n\nJohn Dunderdale began an international career in the YMCA as the Boys’ Work secretary of the Windsor, Ontario YMCA-YWCA. After completing a graduate degree from Columbia University in 1935, he returned to Canada as the young men’s secretary of the Toronto Central YMCA.\n\nFor the next 27 years, Dunderdale worked as the Boys’ Work secretary for the National YMCAs of India, Burma, Pakistan, and Ceylon. He served as a lecturer at the YMCA College of Physical Education, director of the Staff Training School, secretary of the Personnel Committee, and district secretary. During WWII, he participated in the Emergency Services of the National Council, overseeing 225 centers serving allied forces in India, and later served as the secretary of the Program and Leadership Committee for the World Alliance of YMCAs.\n\nAfter his official retirement, he served six months as the secretary of the Ottawa office of the Canadian National Council of YMCAs, and then served a one-year appointment as secretary for Refugee Services in Bangladesh. Dunderdale was honored by the YMCA College in Madras and with the Fellowship of Honor from the National Council of YMCAs of Canada.\n\nClement “Pete” Duran, originator of the YMCA Youth and Government program, started his career as a desk clerk at the Amsterdam, N.Y., YMCA. The YMCA was so impressed with his abilities that they asked him to become the assistant athletic director. Duran accepted, and, in 1919 at the age of 17, he officially entered association work.\n\nAmsterdam was followed by Poughkeepsie, where Duran worked to form the Ki-Y, a youth mentoring partnership with the local Kiwanis Club. From there, he went to Yonkers, and finally to Albany, where Duran began to articulate his thoughts for a program designed to train youth in good citizenship. He later became associate director of Association Press. However, his role as creator of the Youth and Government program, which is now active in more than 40 states and the District of Columbia, is his most enduring legacy. His vision that “democracy must be learned by each generation” is still the motto of the Youth and Government program. Duran was the author of “The Program Encyclopedia” and “The New Encyclopedia of Successful Program Ideas,” both of which were widely used in YMCAs.\n\nDr. David E. Epperson was a distinguished local and national Y volunteer. He served for more than 50 years on the YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh’s Board of Directors, including board chair and numerous other roles. He was instrumental for the Pittsburgh YMCA to be placed with more than 400 interns in YMCA posts, many from the School of Social work where he was Dean for the School of Social Work at the University of Pittsburgh. He was particularly passionate about the Y’s international work. In 1991 he joined Y-USA’s International Committee. He became the first African American Chairman of the National Board of Directors for the YMCA of the USA Y-USA Board Chair from January 2005 to June 2007.\n\nEpperson was the first African-American YMCA World Service Worker Fellowship recipient in community development, serving a year at the Chinese University in Hong Kong after college graduation in 1961. Dr. Epperson was a delegate to nine World Council Meetings and served on the World Alliance Executive Committee from 1998 to 2002. He was a delegate for the YMCA at the 2010 World Council in Durban, South Africa. Dr. Epperson was deeply committed to the YMCA, a true YMCA icon.\n\nJoe Friday was an American Indian of the Ojibway Tribe, born in a wigwam in northern Canada. Along with YMCA Director Harold Keltner and William Hefelfinger, Friday is credited as a founder of the first father-son YMCA Indian Guide tribe in St. Louis in 1925. Friday had been a guide for Keltner’s hunting and fishing trips in Canada and Keltner invited Friday to come and work with him at the St. Louis association. Friday spoke before groups of boys and dads at the YMCA and found a keen interest in the Native American culture. The Indian Guides program grew out of those experiences. According to Indian Guide literature, Friday told Keltner, “The Indian father raises his son. He teaches his son to hunt, track, fish, walk softly and silently in the forest, know the meaning and purpose of life and all he must know, while the white man allows another to raise his son.” Although the Indian Guides program has become Adventure Guides, the legacy of Friday and Keltner lives on in the father-son bonding experience.\n\nJames Garland Stooke’s professional experience at the YMCA is a tale of two careers. The first 18 years, Stooke worked in professional positions in YMCAs around the country. He first began in Atlanta, Ga., serving as a community program director. He then moved to Memphis, Tenn., to become executive director of the Davis branch, which was right down the street from Elvis Presley’s Graceland. Five years later, Stooke accepted a position of vice president of program with the Central Florida YMCA. Then, he moved on to Kansas City, Mo., where he was the vice president of YMCA program and staff development. However, most of his colleagues are most impressed and familiar with Stooke’s work with the YMCA Association of Professional Directors (APD), which he took up in the mid 70s. Eventually becoming CEO of the APD, Stooke rekindled a spark of pride in being both a YMCA and APD member. During his 19-year tenure, APD membership grew from 3,050 to 5,900 members in 2000, established new models and programs in the form of conferences and workshops, and provided development opportunities for all YMCA staff. Stooke’s work developing tool kits and conducting trainings all over the country bolstered the development of thousands of YMCA staff members, creating a robust internal pool of extremely qualified professionals. From his teaching, both directly and indirectly, Stooke left the YMCA and APD with a well-informed training and development regiment that is still being used today.\n\nForty years ago, if Y members wanted to determine their levels of physical fitness, they would have to report to a research laboratory. In the late 1960’s, YMCA of the USA approached Dr. Golding, director of exercise physiology at Kent State University in Ohio, to help standardize adult fitness testing so that Y staff nationwide could conduct tests in the same way.\n\nUnveiled in 1971, the “Y’s Way to Physical Fitness” program became the first national fitness testing protocol by any organization. The battery of tests not only reflected the most-up-to-date scientific information, but it was simple to administer and interpret, it required a minimum of equipment, it required little time to administer, it was within the YMCA fitness director’s capabilities, it reflected changes in the fitness parameters that were emphasized in most YMCA fitness classes, and it was safe when administered according to the established protocols. Over the next 25 years, more than 8,000 people became certified as YMCA fitness specialists.\n\nIn 1993 he received the prestigious “Healthy American Award”, by the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and the U.S. Jaycees. Golding was honored in 1995 with the YMCA of the USA National Treasure award.\n\nBorn to missionary parents in Hawaii, Luther Gulick traveled the world by the time he was a teenager. He attended both Oberlin College and Sargent Normal School of Physical Training for short periods of time, leaving to become the gymnasium supervisor at the Jackson (Mich.) YMCA. He enrolled at New York University and received his medical degree in 1889 at the age of 24.\n\nFor the next 13 years, he served concurrently as the International Committee secretary for physical work and director of physical education programs at the School for Christian Workers (now Springfield College). At the School, he also worked as part of the Department of YMCA Secretaries.\n\nGulick also promoted health and physical education in the public education system in New York City. Described by C. Howard Hopkins as “the most unique genius to touch the first half century of the American YMCA,” Gulick was responsible for introducing new ideas and practices that forever changed physical education, sport, and health instruction.\n\nWhile at Springfield College, he invented the spirit-mind-body inverted triangle (the College’s emblem) to symbolize the concept of wellness. He challenged James Naismith to develop the game of basketball, and then helped disseminate the game to the world through the YMCA. He helped to organize the Boy Scouts in the U.S. and created Campfire Girls along with his wife, Charlotte. He wrote extensively, publishing in areas as diverse as physical measurements, dance, and sex education for soldiers.\n\nBorn in Kansas in 1886, L.K. Hall’s first involvement with the YMCA was during his college years at Baker University. After teaching school for two years, he began working for the YMCA, helping to establish the Camp Wood YMCA (Kansas) in 1915.\n\nHe was hired by the International Committee of the YMCA to develop programs for rural youth and also spent seven years in China developing Boys’ Work programs in Shanghai and for the China National Council of YMCAs. Hall returned to the U.S. to attend Columbia University in 1925. In 1928, he joined the faculty at what had then become known as the International YMCA College (now Springfield College), where he stayed for 15 years as the director of Boys’ Work Studies and later, the director of the Social Science Department.\n\nHall left Springfield College to become the interim editor of Association Press, the publishing enterprise of the National Council of YMCAs. He remained in this position for nine years until his retirement in 1952. In retirement, he served as the first director of the Association of Secretaries (today’s Association of YMCA Professionals) until 1957, and was also a visiting professor at George Williams College.\n\nTom Hargrave’s first job in the YMCA, after graduating from Knoxville College in Tennessee, was as executive director of the Portsmouth (Va.) YMCA. Over the next 15 years, he held various positions in the YMCA, including assistant director to the college and university YMCAs, branch executive for Florida’s First Coast YMCA, executive director in Pasadena, Calif., associate general director of Urban Action of the YMCA of Los Angeles, and the associate general director for program planning and development at the YMCA of Metropolitan Washington.\n\nBeginning in 1973, Hargrave served 19 years as president and chief executive officer of the YMCA of Metropolitan Washington, D.C. until his retirement in 1992. In Washington, he established the new YMCA headquarters and eliminated the association’s $1 million operating deficit. He created partnerships with Ys in India, Gambia, Costa Rica, China, and the Soviet Union. Among his proudest achievements, is the number of staff who served in Washington who went on to become influential YMCA leaders.\n\nIn retirement, Hargrave authored several books, including historical novels and histories of the Y. He was the recipient of many prestigious awards, including an honor from the African Alliance of YMCAs.\n\nArchibald Harte first became involved in the YMCA as member of the Student Y’s at Wesleyan University. He served as the secretary of YMCA’s in Huntsville and Mobile (Ala.) until 1907. Harte was then called to lead YMCAs in Ceylon, India, and Burma, where he began new programs, built facilities, and trained local Y leadership for 16 years.\n\nDuring World War I, Harte supervised a staff of 65 individuals in the Y’s Red Triangle program to provide services to soldiers and prisoners of war. In 1920, Harte was called to Jerusalem to lead the YMCA, which was then housed in a series of larger rented spaces. Harte developed a vision for a permanent Y building and worked tirelessly planning every detail. For years, he cultivated donors who shared his vision of a “Sermon in Stone.” After seven years of construction, the new Jerusalem YMCA was dedicated in 1933 with the words, “Here is a spot whose atmosphere is peace, where political and religious jealousies can be forgotten and international unity be fostered and developed.”\n\nHarte retired to his home on the shores of Galilee, which he bequeathed to the Jerusalem International YMCA as an international conference facility.\n\nAddie Hunton began her work with the YMCA in 1893 after she married YMCA Secretary William A. Hunton (inducted in 1992). She worked with the YWCA to educate Black youth in the midwest and south, where she also conducted surveys and recruited for the YWCA.\n\nAfter her husband’s death and the outbreak of World War I, Hunton volunteered for the Women’s Expeditionary Forces in France. Throughout her time in the Forces, she touched the lives of more than 25,000 stevedores, labor battalions, and engineers in war-torn France. She was one of just three Black women assigned to work with more than 200,000 segregated troops stationed in France. She established literacy courses and a discussion program on art, music, and religion here.\n\nIn 1919 she was moved to Southern France, where she organized educational, cultural, religious, and athletic activities for more than 1,000 African-American troops a week. She was later assigned, alongside Black troops, to recover remains from a battlefield and rebury them in a military cemetery at Romagne.\n\nAfter the war, she returned home and continued working with the YWCA and the NAACP, where she worked to advance the rights of Black individuals throughout the United States.\n\nAsa Kent Jennings became membership secretary of the Utica (N.Y.) YMCA in 1901 and later became general secretary of the Carthage, N.Y., association. He began his international work in 1918, serving first in France and then in Czechoslovakia as a regional secretary. In 1922, he went to Smyrna, Turkey, as a Boys’ Work secretary. It was in Turkey that Jennings performed the seemingly impossible, heroic act of saving nearly 350,000 refugees. When he arrived, Turkey was fighting a brutal war with Greece for possession of the territory around Smyrna in Asia Minor. As a result of the fighting, large portions of the city were burned to the ground. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced. With no authority beyond his convictions, Jennings was able to negotiate and secure safe passage from the Turkish armies for a fleet of Greek merchant vessels.\n\nJennings’ courage captivated the imagination of the world; his story was produced twice in movies, in 1945 as “Strange Destiny” and then in 1952 as “A Man of Great Importance.”\n\nJulius Jones started his career in 1963 as a youth program director at the Jacksonville (Fla.) YMCA. Four years later, he was appointed branch executive director in the Nashville (Tenn.) association. In 1972, he moved to the YMCA of Metropolitan Washington, D.C. as director of operations.\n\nIn 1979, he began 22 years of service as president and chief executive officer of the YMCA of Pittsburgh (Pa.). In that role, he was responsible for the operation of 17 local branches and outreach centers and three camps, with an annual budget of over $22,000,000. With a passion for staff development, Jones was a mentor and teacher for generations of up-and-coming YMCA directors. As a result of his international work, many long-term partnerships were created between U.S. and African YMCAs.\n\nHe served on numerous boards and committees, both within and outside the YMCA, including the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Private Industry Council, and Interfaith Volunteer Caregivers. In retirement, Jones continued to provide leadership with YMCA of the USA, the North American Fellowship of YMCA Retirees (NAFYR), and the YMCA Retirement Fund, including relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nNorm Joyner’s vast YMCA career began at the Montclair, New Jersey, Y serving as the assistant physical director. Since then, Joyner has blazed an impressive trail that carries out the Y mission locally and internationally. Joyner served in executive roles for several YMCAs, including Pittsburgh, Winston-Salem, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. During this time, Joyner was recognized for several awards and accomplishments. These include: Physical Director of the Year, Community Service Leader of the Year, the first African-American to be recognized as a National YMCA Leader in Health and Fitness, and the first African-American CEO of a non-Black heritage YMCA in Alabama. Joyner’s illustrious career also includes serving as an interim CEO and other executive positions for 17 different YMCAs. Joyner’s passion and drive was on full display on the global stage as well. In 2006, Joyner led the charge in revitalizing the YMCA of South Africa and the local YMCAs of South Africa. He rallied American CEOs to study the issue and pin down what could be done. The outcome? The YMCA now has a successful office within South Africa that is supporting local YMCAs throughout the country. In 2022, the office also experienced a successful national CEO transition and continues to work with U.S. YMCA leaders to inform each other on racial healing and global inequality. Clearly, Joyner’s impact and legacy carries the YMCA spirit, both nationally and abroad.\n\nRichard C. “Dick” Kautz was born August 1, 1916 in Muscatine, Iowa. Kautz was active as a member and lay volunteer in the Muscatine YMCA from childhood and became more deeply involved in the 1950s, when he participated in a reorganization study. He later went on to serve as president of the Muscatine Y and then as a member of the National Board of Young Men’s Christian Associations of the United States and a delegate to the World Alliance of YMCAs. He was elected chair of the National YMCA Board in 1970. He also served as vice chair of the World Alliance of YMCAs. In 1996, Kautz and his family donated over $800,000 to the national YMCA Archives, by then located at the University of Minnesota. The gift funded a major preservation project and prompted the renaming of the Archives in honor of the family. The records of the YMCA of the USA, founded in 1851, and its various committees, programs, and constituent bodies, form the core of the Archives. In addition to personal papers of over 300 YMCA leaders, the collection has more than 75,000 photos dating from the American Civil War to the present.\n\nHarold Keltner was a dedicated employee for more than 35 years at the St. Louis YMCA and additional years at YMCAs in Indiana and New York. He worked hard to develop the YMCA as a place to provide opportunities for youth, whether it was working at the Mexican border for the Fort Niagara (NY) YMCA or providing resources for other agencies seeking to serve youth. He was determined to help increase the bond between father and son. That was never more evident than in 1926 when he established a new program, along with Joe Friday, a member of the Ojibwe (Native American) tribe and National YMCA Hall of Fame inductee. The YMCA Indian Guide Program encouraged fathers and sons to be more involved with each other and was modeled on the often deep and profound relationship between Native American fathers and sons. The YMCA Indian Guide Program was recognized in 1938 as a National Program and more than seven million fathers and sons have participated. Keltner was also able to effectively demonstrate the value of the YMCA even during the Depression, when he raised enough funds to build a new YMCA, one of the few built in the United States during that time.\n\nFrank Kiehne joined the YMCA as a teen in Burlington, Iowa. After serving in the Marine Corps during World War II, he attended George Williams College. There, he was the president of the Student YMCA. He worked with the Chicago (Ill.), Kansas City (Mo.), and St. Louis (Mo.) associations before being named the executive director of the YMCA of Reading and Berks County (Pa). While in this role, he developed programs for migrant workers and disadvantaged youth.\n\nIn 1970, Kiehne moved to the YMCA in Washington D.C., where he helped to address the social unrest of the era. Kiehne served as a consultant to the newly formed Peace Corps in 1961 and moved on to become the executive director of the YMCA of the USA’s International Division. He was instrumental in implementing a decentralized approach to international work that supported indigenous leadership. In the 1980s, he served as secretary for refugees and rehabilitation for the World Alliance of YMCAs, and in 1990, he became Congressman Donald M. Payne’s foreign affairs advisor.\n\nKiehne received numerous recognitions, including the North American Fellowship of YMCA Retirees (NAFYR) Stahl Award and the Distinguished Alumni for George Williams College/ Aurora University in 1970, and again in 2006.\n\nRon Kinnamon was known as a positive, upbeat and creative leader during 38 years as an executive with the YMCA. Ron started at YMCA Camp Grady Spruce. He then worked with YMCAs in Dallas, Miami, Atlanta and San Francisco before finishing his career with the YMCA of the USA as assistant national executive before retiring in 1998.\n\nKinnamon was the first to receive the distinguished F. William Stahl Award in 1975 for publishing a 1,500 page resource: “Family Focus” that contained material used to facilitate workshops around the nation with local YMCA leadership on family values and enrichment programs.\n\nKinnamon was the first to receive the distinguished “Legends in Camping” Award in 1995 which recognizes those individuals who have been integral in shaping the camping experience and model while he was serving on the staff of YMCA of the USA.\n\nOne of Kinnamon’s most significant contributions was incorporating the four character development values of Caring, Honesty, Respect and Responsibility in all YMCA programs. He was also an early proponent of older adult programs in the YMCA for aging baby boomers as well as concerned with childhood obesity and youth fitness long before it was a common concern.\n\nAfter serving in the Army during WWI, Herbert Lansdale earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees from Oberlin College and completed additional graduate studies at Clark University, while serving as educational director of the Worcester (Mass.) YMCA.\n\nHe accepted an assignment as the general secretary of the YMCA in Saloniki, Greece in 1925, and two years later was selected as the national secretary of the YMCAs of Greece, a post he held until 1939. For two years, Lansdale served as the U.S. State Department director of the Division of Relief and Welfare of the American Mission for Aid to Greece.\n\nHe returned to the United States as the general secretary of the Rochester (N.Y.) YMCA, where he remained until 1952. Lansdale was appointed executive secretary of the International Committee of the YMCA of the United States and Canada, and served from 1957 to 1964 as general secretary of the National Council.\n\nLike his parents before him, Bev Laws became a public school teacher after graduating from college, and worked part time as a football and basketball referee at the YMCA. After completing his graduate degree at New York University in 1953, he accepted the physical director position of the Montgomery, Alabama YMCA.\n\nSoon after, he was appointed executive director of the new South Branch of the Montgomery association. He became the general secretary of the Orange County, Florida YMCA in Orlando in 1963, and completed a capital campaign that resulted in the construction of three new branches. After nine years in Orlando, Laws accepted the chief executive officer position at the YMCA of Greater Houston (Texas).\n\nUnder Laws’ leadership, Houston developed a resident camp, added four new facilities and withstood the economic challenges of the 1980s. When Laws retired in 1992, Houston was the fourth largest YMCA in the country. He served on numerous national committees, was the co-chair for the Camping Centennial, and chaired the Urban Group and the National Employee Benefits committees.\n\nJohn Ledlie began his 44-year career as a 19-year-old assistant secretary for Boys’ Work at the Bronx Union Branch (N.Y.) YMCA. He later moved to the Patterson (N.J.) YMCA, and in 1924 became the Boys’ Work secretary at the Jersey City Y.\n\nFive years later, he became director of the New Jersey State YMCA’s Camp Wawayanda. For four years, he served as executive for Boys’ Work of the Central Atlantic area. In 1944, he was appointed youth and camping Secretary for the National Council, where he served until his retirement in 1963. Ledlie developed national camping standards that were adopted by other national organizations.\n\nHe helped build the Y Indian Guides program for boys and their fathers from a few hundred to 12,000 “tribes” and a membership of 175,000. He was a prolific writer, with over two dozen publications that included: “So You Want To Go To College,” “Gearing Into Life,” “Adventures in Christian Living,” “Managing the YMCA Camp,” “Camping Skills for Trail Living,” and “Better Camping.”\n\nPaul Limbert is among the most notable YMCA professionals of the 20th Century, influencing the YMCA movement at the local, national, and international levels. He earned divinity degrees from both Eastern and Union Theological Seminaries and completed his doctorate in 1929 at Columbia University.\n\nAfter serving as an Army first lieutenant during WWI, he became the physical director at Camp Upton, New York. Limbert held faculty positions at Franklin and Marshall College and Columbia University and was a faculty adviser to the Student YMCA. For six years, beginning in 1946, he was the president of Springfield College (then the International YMCA College), and in 1953 was named the secretary general of the World Alliance of YMCAs.\n\nAfter retiring from the World Alliance, he accepted the appointment as the executive director of the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly in North Carolina. Limbert authored several books, including “Christian Emphasis in YMCA Programs,” “College Teaching and Christian Values,” “Living a Century,” and “New Perspective for the YMCA.” He was recognized with the Legion of Honor award from France, the L.K. Hall Citation from the YMCA Association of Professional Directors (APD), and with honorary doctorates from both Springfield College and American International College.\n\nJohn Long joined the YMCA as a youth member and worked as a part time staff member during his college years. He graduated from Springfield College (then the International YMCA College) in 1922, and began his full-time career with the Brockton (Mass.) YMCA as the industrial and immigration secretary, moving into the general secretary position in 1938.\n\nLong was active in the community, helping immigrants qualify for U.S. citizenship. When he left the Brockton YMCA for a similar position in the Germantown (Pa.) YMCA in 1945, 1,000 people from 17 countries attended a testimonial to honor him.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1969, he served in several capacities in the Phillipines, including: as a member of the International Committee staff, a member of the National Board of the Philippines YMCA, and as the area secretary of the Southern Philippines. When he left, he was recognized with four citations from various Philippine YMCA organizations honoring his work and dedication to the people.\n\nMarvin Ludwig’s inspiring YMCA career reaches both beyond retirement and American soil. After seven years of service as an aquatic director for Camp Highridge and as an executive in Marion, Ohio, Ludwig was selected to serve the YMCAs of Ethiopia as fraternal secretary and eventually secretary general for 11 years. Ludwig’s care and passion to create positive long-lasting impacts for the YMCA of Ethiopia is evident in his work. For example, Ludwig was influential in the creation and execution of the Addis Ababa mission statement, which eventually led to the formation of the Kampala Principles. His commitment to the creation of this mission statement helped create a focused objective for the newly found organization. This dedication to a focused objective is also apparent in the words of Ludwig himself. From a personal anecdote shared by Norris D. Lineweaver, Ludwig utilized the YMCA of Jerusalem as an example of the extreme power in bringing people together. He presented that in the swimming pools of the Jerusalem YMCA where Christians, Muslims, and Jewish people all swam together during a time of great conflict. Ludwig asked the group if they saw not just overcoming fear of water, but also of the other. He left these college students with this wisdom: “The mission of the YMCA is often to see the unseen. Never take for granted the impact you can make on an entire generation, indeed the future of a nation, when you win the trust of a child as their swim instructor.”\n\nArmin F. Luehrs (Whitey) had a 41 year career with the YMCA as one of the most highly recognized camping specialists from 1948 to 1990. He was considered legendary by his peers during the camping movement of his time. Luehrs was drawn to the YMCA as a Hi-Y high school student when a new YMCA opened up in his hometown of Sheboygan, Wis. He then spent five years as a summer staff person at the Wisconsin State YMCA Camp Manito-wish.\n\nHis local work continued with the St. Paul YMCA as director of the wilderness canoe camp, Widjiwagan, and the new resident family Camp du Nord, the latter of which he helped establish. It was there he met the camp nurse who eventually became his wife and mother to their three children.\n\nWith the Minneapolis YMCA, Luehrs supervised the four resident youth camps and three large metropolitan day camps, along with the development of a new 1400 acre site for camping and recreational use.\n\nThroughout his career, Luehrs had been actively involved with the American Camp Association (ACA) in a variety of projects and events, culminating a term as national president. He was also a recipient of ACA’s Distinguished Service Award, recognizing his volunteer service.\n\nLuehrs was then invited to serve on the national staff, first, as a regional program and camping specialist for the Southwest and Pacific Regions (office, Dallas) and later with the Program Division (Chicago) continuing with the camping portfolio nationally.\n\nSome additional highlights during this era included: the development of Day Camp standards; the first and second National Conferences for Outdoor Education (school related programs); the centennial of YMCA camping in 1985 brought more than 500 people to the Y of the Rockies; the U.S. Postal System issuing a YMCA Camping Stamp (22 cents), the first of its kind; inauguration of World Camps in each of the regions; and camper exchange programs with European countries.\n\nFor eight years in retirement, Luehrs served as chairman to the International Camp Counselor Program for the New York YMCA.\n\nAfter graduating from Knoxville College in 1928, Leo B. Marsh began working at the Detroit (Mich.) YMCA as the youth work secretary. He held a series of YMCA positions in Chicago (Ill.) and in Toledo and Columbus (Ohio). In 1944, he joined the national staff as associate executive secretary of the Central Atlantic Area. He later served as the director of the Board of Interracial and Counseling Services.\n\nDuring this period, he continued his education at George Williams College, Springfield College, the University of Chicago, and Columbia University. During his 26 years as director, he became the first African- American president of the National Association of Secretaries in 1954. He also served as the U.S. representative at the World Conference of Christian Youth in India in 1952, and as a delegate to the YMCA World Council Meeting in Japan in 1965. He was one of the founders and first general chair of the National Conference of Black and Non-White YMCA Staff (BANWYS).\n\nMarsh also served for two years as the assistant executive director of the National Board and as executive for the Committee for Interracial Advancement in 1967. After he retired in 1970, he served as a consultant to the Harlem Branch of the YMCA of Greater New York, where he was instrumental in the creation of the Black Achievers program as a strategy to create mentorships between inner-city youth of color and successful minority businessmen.\n\nAs a YMCA Professional, Robert devoted more than 50 years of his career as a leader in YMCA organizations in Hawaii, the USA and around the world. Robert’s YMCA experience included complex international work in four continents, the Pacific, Middle East and across the U.S.\n\nHe provided leadership with “YMCAs in areas of crises” by traveling several times each year to Belfast, Northern Ireland and The Republic working at the invitation of and in partnership with the Belfast YMCA and the Irish YMCA. He also worked actively in support of the YMCA of the USA’s Jerusalem International YMCA, East Jerusalem YMCA, Gaza YMCA, Nazareth YMCA and others in organizing and participating in meetings with the leadership of other regional factions. Robert also initiated and led activities to strengthen partnerships with the Africa Alliance of YMCAs.\n\nThroughout his career, Robert also played a significant role in the YMCA’s relationship, between the YMCA of the USA and YMCAs in Asia & the Pacific as well as the Canadian and Mexican YMCAs, and the Soviet Union. He served as the key representative for the YMCA of the USA for several decades with the National General Secretaries of both China and Japan.\n\nMeredith Mathews began his YMCA career in Ohio, first in Columbus and later in Youngstown. He moved to Oklahoma as program director of the YMCA in Lawton and then as the executive director of the USO-YMCA in McAlester.\n\nIn 1947, he became the director of the Northeast Fourth Street YMCA in Oklahoma City, a struggling inner-city association that he helped to transform with a new facility. Ten years later, he was appointed executive of the East Madison YMCA in Seattle (Wash.). His successes led to his appointment as associate executive director of the Pacific Northwest Area Council of the YMCA in 1965. He was named executive director of the Pacific region YMCAs in 1971, with responsibility for assisting 126 facilities in 11 states.\n\nHe retired in 1976 after 39 years of service, but remained active in the International Association of Retired Directors of the YMCA. In 1993, the YMCA of Greater Seattle recognized Mathews by naming a facility in his honor: the Meredith Matthews East Madison YMCA. He also received municipal and community recognitions, as well as awards from the YMCA Association of Professional Directors (APD), the National Board of YMCAs, and United Way.\n\nBill McAllister joined the St. Louis (Mo.) YMCA as a youth work director in 1947. Seven years later, he became a branch executive in Chester, Pennsylvania, were he established extensive young-adult programs and was responsible for the construction of a new facility.\n\nHe served in several branches in the Buffalo (N.Y.) YMCA before being appointed associate executive for urban affairs. In this role, he created the Y Academy, an education program that worked with gifted inner-city boys in Buffalo. In 1968, McAllister became the associate executive of the West Central Area of the YMCA, and two years later was appointed the first executive director of the newly-formed Mid-American region. He served as director of the Department of Personnel and Training for the YMCA of the USA.\n\nFor five years, beginning in 1984, he was senior vice president and chief operating officer of the YMCA Retirement Fund, with an emphasis on strategic planning. He retired in 1989, but maintained connections with the YMCA through board service on the Greater Bergen County (N.J.) YMCA, Sioux Indian YMCA, and YMCA of the Rockies. He also served as chairman of the World Fellowship of YMCA Retirees.\n\nWhen Robert McBurney arrived in the United States from Ireland in 1854, he took a room at a YMCA. Eight years later, he became the only employed staff person of the New York City YMCA. He was responsible for taking care of the library and programs in the few rented rooms that made up the association.\n\nUnder McBurney’s leadership, the association grew and moved several times into larger quarters. In 1870, the YMCA moved into its own building, designed by McBurney, to accommodate the specific membership and program needs of the Y. Over the next seven years, McBurney oversaw the development of nine more facilities as well as a dramatic increase in membership. He was an outspoken advocate of the “fourfold purpose,” incorporating physical activity as part of the Y’s mission when the idea was controversial.\n\nHe developed the “Metropolitan Association” model of a semi-autonomous branch network with one central administrative authority. Robert McBurney also served in senior leadership roles for the International Committee, the precursor of today’s YMCA of the USA. One of his biographers wrote that McBurney’s influence on the YMCA movement was “profound, exceeding that of any other man.”\n\nQuentin R. Mease started his YMCA career, which spanned from 1939 to 1976, as an executive for the Crocker Street YMCA in Des Moines, Iowa. He went into the Army from 1942 to 1946 and was discharged as a captain. He attended George Williams College and received a master’s degree in 1948. From 1948 to 1976, he was an executive director for the Houston South Central YMCA, located in the historic Third Ward community, as part of the YMCA of Greater Houston. Mease was a founding member and first president of the Houston Area Urban League. Mease and the late Leo B. Marsh co-sponsored the first Southwest Region YMCA intercultural consultation at Houston YMCA Camp Holden in 1955, an early desegregation initiative for the national YMCA. He helped orchestrate the purchase of YMCA Camp Holden, the Houston Camp for Blacks. In the 1960s, Mease became a primary agent for peaceful desegregation in Houston and led the forces that allowed the city to avoid the racial violence experienced by other U.S. cities at the time. The South Central YMCA became the central meeting place in this effort. Mease conceived the first YMCA Black Achievers Program at the South Central YMCA in 1967, which later was adopted as the national YMCA Black Achievers Program.\n\nMease was considered a pillar of the community right up until his death at age 100. He was looked at as a visionary who was not hindered by race, age, or demographics. He saw what it was, and fought for what could be. He was a man of great character and was respected by common folk as well as the powerful and wealthy. He believed in and lived the YMCA mission and values each day of his 100 years.\n\nMease was inducted into the YMCA of the USA’s YMCA Black Achievers Hall of Fame in 2003. He was honored as the founder of the YMCA Black Achievers Program by the YMCA of the USA at its 40th Anniversary Black/Hispanic Conference in New Orleans in 2008.\n\nDavid Mercer’s YMCA service lives on not only through results, but also through the many people he’s inspired with his kindness, humanity, and integrity. Along his journey from a volunteer camp leader to a YMCA of the USA executive, Mercer energized people from all over the world with his embodiment of the YMCA spirit. During his service with the Los Angeles and San Francisco YMCAs, Mercer helped increase annual giving and membership. The work didn’t stop there, as Mercer also helped raise annual income and membership during his 10-year service as national executive director. Specifically, Mercer developed the first National Corporate Partnership in the history of the YMCA with Pepsi Cola, an important milestone for the Y. Yet, one of the most impactful contributions to the Y movement comes in the form of Mercer’s “legendary service” initiative. Mercer challenged and focused his entire staff to provide the best experience possible to YMCAs of all sizes. His work expanded internationally as well, as Mercer developed great relations with YMCAs in China, Jerusalem, and Japan. Mercer continues to carry out the spirit of the Y through his alumni chapter, helping most recently with the Sioux Indian Project. Through his genuine regard for all human life, the YMCA spirit flows through his veins.\n\nTo say that Harold Mezile is a go-getter and motivated to lead by example would be an understatement. In a 40-year career with the YMCA, he was known for his social justice work and transformational leadership style. He created initiatives that impacted the urban landscape. He is described as a cause-driven equity leader and innovator. He inspired people to collaborate in a collective way to make differences in the communities they serve. Among his accomplishments, Mezile pioneered the Beacons Adaptation Partnership, an after-school network started in 1996 during his tenure as president and CEO of the YMCA of the Greater Twin Cities, the third largest YMCA in the United States. Beacons provided enriching out-of-school time services for more than 5,000 youth daily from low-income urban communities, with an estimate of over 60,000 youth served since the inception of the program. He is also credited with starting a number of national Y initiatives, including Search Institute Partnership, Minority Achievers, Multicultural Executive Leadership Program, Diversity and Inclusion, Strong Community Agenda, and the Employee Resource Networks.\n\nJames Naismith, inventor of basketball, urged the young William Morgan to attend the International YMCA Training School (now Springfield College) upon graduating from high school. He became the physical director of the Auburn (Maine) YMCA after completing his studies. He stayed in Maine for just one year before accepting a position at the Holyoke (Mass.) YMCA.\n\nWhile at Holyoke, he realized that basketball was too strenuous for the gym class of middle-aged businessmen that met at noon. He combined aspects of basketball and badminton to create a game he called “mintonette.” Morgan was invited to demonstrate his new game for faculty and students at the International YMCA Training School in nearby Springfield. While watching the game, the spectators suggested a new name, “volley ball.” The rest is history.\n\nMorgan left the YMCA in 1897 to begin a career with General Electric and Westinghouse. He kept ties with Springfield College and the game he created, stating he was content in the knowledge that the game brought a richer life to millions of people throughout the world.\n\nRichard Morse was a nephew to Samuel Morse, inventor of the telegraph. He was ordained a Presbyterian minister, but never entered the active ministry. Instead, he chose to become the religious editor of The New York Observer, a weekly newspaper founded by his father.\n\nIt was through a report of a YMCA convention he wrote for that paper, that Morse sought out work in the YMCA. He first joined the YMCA in 1869 as editor and publisher of the new Association Monthly magazine. This began a 47 year career, which culminated in his appointment as general secretary of the YMCA’s International Committee. Morse was one of the original members of the World’s Committee from 1878 to 1888, and was active in the New York City association.\n\nMorse’s YMCA work took him across the Atlantic Ocean 50 times, including relief work in France during World War I. Among the several books written by Dr. Morse are, “My Life with Young Men,” “A History of the North American Young Men’s Christian Associations,” and “Robert R. McBurney, A Memorial.”\n\nDescribed as “one of the most nobly useful men in the world” by President Woodrow Wilson, John R. Mott began his association with the YMCA as a leader of the Student YMCA at Cornell University. Beginning in 1888, he served a 27-year tenure as national secretary of the Student YMCAs.\n\nFrom 1915 to 1928, he served as general secretary of the International Committee (today’s YMCA of the USA), and also served on the executive committee of the World’s Committee of YMCAs. Mott led the YMCA’s expansive involvement in World War I. Under his leadership, the national movement raised $250 million for YMCA programs supporting troops in the U.S. and overseas. Beginning in the late 1920s, he turned his attention to international projects focused on unifying world-wide Christian evangelical concerns.\n\nMott authored 16 books, visited over 83 nations, and received honorary awards from 14 countries, including the Distinguished Service Medal from the United States. He received six honorary degrees from universities around the world and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his life-long humanitarian efforts.\n\nRichard Newcomb Jones’ YMCA career is truly a lifelong affair. With his first YMCA experience coming at 9 years old as a Y member, Jones went from a volunteer, to a part-time employee, eventually capping off his Y career as national associate director of sports for the YMCA of the USA. Under Jones’ supervision and leadership, YMCA leaders club programming flourished throughout the Great Lakes region. His work with program development has led to robust leadership training programs and thousands of qualified individuals who have ascended into leadership roles. Jones’ influence with the leadership programs has positively impacted the lives of thousands of teenagers and rising leaders for the YMCA and beyond. Jones made a point of forming relationships with everyone he met. This made him the first call for anyone wanting to take the next step of their career or anyone looking for recommendations to fill a new position. Jones’ passion for development and training has given the Y a rich internal pool of leaders and innovators for years to come.\n\nJohn O’Melia served in the Army during WWII, and completed his undergraduate and graduate studies at Western Reserve University before joining the Cleveland (Ohio) YMCA staff. As an assistant program secretary, he developed an innovative interracial camp, community service programs for youth, and a citywide coeducational camp.\n\nHe also served as executive secretary in two Cleveland branches. In 1956, O’Melia joined the Ohio-West Virginia Area Council of YMCAs, where he had the responsibility of coordinating adult and industrial programs, interracial services, and inner-city initiatives. In 1960, he founded the YMCA Center for International Management Studies, which offered management education activities to industrial leaders from the midwest and their counterparts from foreign countries.\n\nAs director of National Program Services, and later as executive of Constituent Services on the national staff, O’Melia provided leadership for the full range of YMCA programs and organizational initiatives. From 1970 until his retirement in 1988, O’Melia worked with the International Division of the YMCA of the USA, first as the executive director of World Development and then as the director of the International Division.\n\nO’Melia’s father, uncle, and brother were all YMCA directors.\n\nOver 40 years, Owen Pence became one of the most influential and well-respected representatives of non-governmental organizations. His work began with student work in France with the National War Work Council. He eventually served 23 years on the National Council in Personnel Services staff and as director of the Bureau of Research, Studies and Trends.\n\nAfter his retirement in 1949, Pence became Secretary for International Affairs of the World Alliance of YMCAs and represented the Alliance at the United Nations in New York. His apprentice, Arthur L. Swift Jr., says of him in a statement, “No man in our generation has more profoundly and more soundly influenced the development of our Movement. Encouraging, urging, condemning by conference and example, he gave the brotherhood of secretaries and their lay boards and committees in local communities across America a new understanding of the importance and use of careful records and studies.”\n\nPence also helped characterize the Association, showing its growth and influence trends. He fought for the strengthening of policies in personnel, the raising of standards, and the adequate education of secretaries in their preparation and training. He was also integral in the publication of the YMCA Yearbook, where he analyzed and appraised the Association’s work regarding current events. Swift describes Pence once more, “In loyalty unsurpassed; in critical and creative leadership a guiding force in the Association’s progress; a wise and trusted friend, a keen analyst, an able historian; an untiring worker, exact and exacting, very respectful of detail, yet with mind alert to national and world affairs and their meaning for Christian efforts and hopes.”\n\nPence authored and edited dozens of prominent essays, research studies, and books for the Association over his 40 years of service.\n\nBill Phillips decided to become a YMCA director while attending a teen Leadership Development Conference at YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly. He began his career as Boys’ Work secretary at his hometown Y in Pensacola, Fla. Beginning in 1962, he served in several leadership roles at the Central Florida YMCA in Orlando, and in 1968, Phillips returned to Pensacola as general director to lead the racial integration of that YMCA.\n\nPhillips returned to the Central Florida YMCA during the 1970s as associate general director and then chief executive officer. He was the president and chief executive officer of the YMCA of Greater Seattle from 1982 to 1992, during which time two capital campaigns were completed and the budget tripled. He was appointed president and chief executive officer of the YMCA of Greater Houston (Texas) in 1992, a position he held until his retirement in 2002.\n\nIn Houston, the Y grew from $27 million to nearly $70 million. Four new facilities were constructed, 15 were renovated, and the funds were secured for three additional branches. Phillips served on the Board of Trustees of the YMCA Retirement and the National Board of the YMCA of the USA. He often said he was most proud of the fact that over 25 people who served on his staff went on to become chief executive officers, including five in the Urban Group.\n\nPeter Post found his passion and lifelong connection to the Y when he was 18 years old joining the staff of the Camp Hazen YMCA in Chester, Connecticut where he worked while attending Bates College. He joined the Y full time as a youth director at the YMCA in Westfield, Massachusetts before joining the Bridgeport, Connecticut YMCA as a branch director. From there he became the General Director of the Woburn, Massachusetts Y before merging it with the Boston Association. He then began a 23 year career in Boston that included becoming the President/CEO in 1981 for an 11 year run. His tenure in Boston included the largest capital campaign in history of the Boston Y at the time as well as creating a homeless shelter for 22 families. He was instrumental as chairman of the World Urban Network Steering Committee. Peter served as the Associate National Executive/Chief Operating Officer of the YMCA of the USA where he was instrumental in creating the Metro 30 organization to strengthen and expand YMCA work in urban areas. He re-established YMCA World Service awareness and giving from local YMCAs, through the MRC field system to increase international understanding and financial support of global Y initiatives.\n\nJerry has been the Secretary General and CEO, Rosario YMCA, Argentina; Founder and CEO, YMCA of Costa Rica and co-founder YMCA of Guatemala; Director of the International Office for Latin America and the Caribbean, YMCA of the USA; Director, International Group, YMCA of the USA; and Chief International Officer, YMCA of the USA.\n\nJerry launched Mano a Mano sin Fronteras youth service-learning exchange. He created the Binational Mexico/United States Committee that brought together key leaders to provide oversight leading to a strong and meaningful relationship through the YMCA North American Network. He led the development of the United States/Mexico Border Coalition convening local Ys to support the development of YMCA Homes (Casas) for Migrant youth and Ys in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. He led U.S. efforts in the development and growth of YMCAs in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nJerry is a founder and key motivator of the YMCA Secours Speciaux. This fund allows dedicated YMCA leaders to retire to a decent life after years of service in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Jerry is also a founder of the International Coalition of YMCA Universities. Jerry is the co-founder and supporter of the U.S. Hispanic/Latino Leadership Network.\n\nThe advocacy and perseverance of Jim Raines personifies the YMCA’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and social justice. In the face of a defiant board, community, and network of CEOs, Raines racially integrated the YMCA of Albany, Ga., in 1968. During this time, many southern Ys were not integrated, and some even withdrew from the national Y to stay racially segregated. Despite the lack of support and unity, Raines committed his service to creating a welcoming and inclusive community with a lack of advancement around him. Moreover, Raines displayed more courage and great leadership in his service in San Francisco. Here, Raines was involved in international programs that focused on aid for South Asian refugees. He also continued to fight for diversity and inclusion during the height of the AIDS epidemic, providing strong advocacy in 1980s San Francisco. Raines didn’t keep his knowledge and passion of fighting discrimination to himself, rather he was very influential in coaching, professional development, and helping colleagues in their journey towards social equity. Raines was always committed to engaging and supporting the advancement of women, minorities, and LGBTQ+ members, staff, and program participants. In a dark time, Raines showed the YMCA what was needed to eliminate segregation. Through his courage and action, Raines’ legacy continues to live on through the Y’s work in diversity, inclusion, and social justice.\n\nAlthough José Rendón’s YMCA tenure was mostly spent in one state between two cities, the impact of his hard work expands not only all over the city of San Antonio, but the state of Texas and nations around the world, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean. Rendón was a champion of grassroots organizing and the advancement of a Hispanic Latino movement within the YMCA. When serving as executive director for the Westside YMCA in San Antonio, Texas, Rendón helped pioneer the concept of city-YMCA partnerships. Rendón’s public policy-guided vision helped develop facilities and provide services to vulnerable communities within San Antonio. This movement proved to be influential in the city, as more than 50% of YMCAs in San Antonio had some form of a partnership with the city by the late 1980s. Rendón also worked tirelessly to develop and pave the way for Hispanic and Latino communities within the Y. For example, with his signature grassroots method, Rendón helped form the first National Hispanic Conference in 1990 and the YMCA Hispanic Latino Leadership Network. Rendón’s service expanded internationally when he volunteered to work with the Latin America and Caribbean Alliance (LACA) of YMCAs. Specifically, Rendón worked with the YMCAs of Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay. With his help, YMCA national and LACA redesigned their philanthropic systems, saving some YMCAs from potential bankruptcy. Although Rendón’s career found himself in one state, his collaboration and grassroots organizing has created lasting impacts around the globe.\n\nEdgar M. Robinson first became associated with the YMCA as a college student in New Brunswick, Canada. He served as the chairman of the Boys’ Work Committee and later developed their first camping program. In 1898, he was hired as the Boys’ Work secretary by the Massachusetts-Rhode Island State Committee.\n\nHe worked four days a week while attending the International YMCA Training School (now Springfield College). Although the emphasis on youth was a minor part of the national organization’s work, Robinson was appointed the Boys’ Work secretary of the International Committee in 1900. At the time, there were twenty Boys’ Work secretaries and 30,000 boys as members nationwide. Thirteen years later, there were 363 secretaries with over 120,000 youth in membership. Robinson developed camping programs, father and son programs, sex education programs, specialized work with employed boys and wartime programs.\n\nHe was also instrumental in the development of the Boy Scouts of America. In 1920, Robinson completed a nine-month world tour which led to the 1923 “Conference with Boys” in Austria, attracting 800 delegates from 54 countries. After his retirement, Robinson returned to Springfield College where he served as the dean of the Boy’s Work Department.\n\nRix Rogers began his career in 1956 at the Lakeshore Branch of the Montreal YMCA. He became the assistant general secretary of the Montreal YMCA in 1965, and served as its chief executive officer from 1968 to 1971.\n\nRogers was appointed to general secretary/chief executive officer of the National Council of YMCAs of Canada in 1971, and held this position until his retirement in 1986. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto and graduate degree from Springfield College. Rogers is known for his expertise in board development, committee work, volunteer and staff development, and fundraising.\n\nHe formed relationships with the Canadian government, which helped to create new ways to provide YMCA services across Canada. Rogers served as the Canadian trustee for the U.S. Retirement Fund Board of Trustees and represented Canada in the World Alliance from 1982 to 1984. As a founding member of the North American Urban Group, he brought together chief executive officers from large Urban Ys in the United States and Canada.\n\nJane Seaver Kirk paved the way for women to become executive leaders within the YMCA movement. Minus the first three months of her career, Kirk was the first woman to hold whatever position she had in the Y. For example, Kirk started the first program for American military in a downtown YMCA. She also was the first female member of the Middle Atlantic Region YMCA staff. Adding to the theme of firsts, during Kirk’s first year as deputy director of the YMCA International Group, fundraising for the National World Service Campaign went from $60,000 to $1 million. These groundbreaking accomplishments eventually led to Kirk receiving Fund Raising Executive of the Year in 1991, the highest honor for the North American YMCA Financial Development Officers. Kirk continued to serve the YMCA mission well after her retirement, taking many opportunities to volunteer for various boards and committees. Her willingness to serve others long after retirement clearly displays the purpose and spirit of the YMCA. As Jane herself put it: “My goal has always been to demonstrate by performance that I have been qualified to hold the position. Working hard to do well is the way I live my life all the time. I am happy that I have the mind, spirit, and body to be able to do so.”\n\nAs a teen, Ed Singer was a member of the Zanesfield, Ohio Hi-Y Club. He began his career as a physical education director in Ohio YMCAs, first in Columbus and then in Cincinnati, from 1936 to 1941. Singer served as director of the Douglas USO Club at Fort Sill (Okla.) and as the itinerant director of the Regional Army and Navy Department of the YMCA.\n\nHe returned to local YMCA work after World War II as executive director of the YMCA in Kansas City (Kan.). Singer resigned from the Y in protest after being told that, despite his credentials, “the time was not right for the appointment of a colored secretary,” when he applied for the general secretary for the Midwest position. One year later, Leo Marsh recruited him back to the Y as general program and membership secretary for the Center Avenue Branch in Pittsburgh (Pa.). Singer remained in Pittsburgh until 1951, when became branch executive, and later associate general secretary, in Pasadena (Calif.).\n\nHe and other African-American leaders promoted an “open door” policy of YMCA membership throughout the U.S. as well as an “equal pay for equal positions” policy for all Y staff. In 1961, Singer was appointed executive director of the Nuuanu YMCA branch in Honolulu (Hawaii). Five years later, he joined the national staff as association executive of the Pacific Southwest Area Council of the YMCA. In 1967, he was appointed the director of the Washington office of the National Board, where he served until his retirement.\n\nWith an undergraduate degree in economics and history and graduate degrees in both business and divinity, Harold Smith was well prepared for his 42 years at the YMCA Retirement Fund. He served in various roles before his 1983 appointment as president and chief investment officer.\n\nIn Smith’s 17 years as president, the Fund grew from 17,000 members with $400 million in assets, to 75,000 members and $3.75 billion in assets. Smith also had success combining his expertise in financial matters and his deeply spiritual side. From 1958 to 2000 he served as voluntary senior pastor of the Unity Hill United Church of Christ in Trumbull, Conn. Smith served as a member of the YMCA of the USA International Committee and director of the World Federation of Associations of YMCA Secretaries in Geneva, Switzerland. He was the treasurer of the YMCA Association of Professional Directors (APD) from 1969 to 1978, and served a three-year term as the APD president.\n\nIn retirement, Smith continued to serve on the Board of the International Branch of the YMCA of Greater New York and as a Springfield College trustee. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Springfield College in 1998.\n\nRoy Sorenson began his lifelong association with the YMCA as a 12-year-old in Milwaukee. He worked part-time for the Madison YMCA while attending the University of Wisconsin, and joined the Milwaukee YMCA staff in 1923 as the assistant Boys’ Work secretary.\n\nIn 1927, he joined the National Council of YMCAs, first on the Boys’ Work staff and later with the National Program Services Department. For 10 years, Sorenson served the National Council in Chicago (Ill.), where he helped introduce nonfacility-centered programs and community club programs into the YMCA. In 1946, he became the managing director of the San Francisco (Calif.) YMCA.\n\nUnder his leadership, four new branches were developed and an innovative youth work program was initiated. Sorensen was instrumental in the development of the San Francisco Master Plan for Youth, the Social Welfare Council, and the Bay Area United Fund. Sorenson authored “Designing Education in Values: A Case Study in Institutional Change,” “The Art of Board Membership,” and “How to Be a Board or Committee Member.”\n\nCaptain Thomas V. Sullivan (1800-1859), a sea captain and founder of the first United States YMCA, was inspired by his encounter with the nascent YMCA movement in England. Before the age of 33, Sullivan had been shipwrecked in the Antarctic and attacked by pirates off the coast of Brazil. He had also made and lost a fortune. Hardships associated with life at sea and an illness led to his conversion to a more active Christianity in 1833. Taking his message to his community he began what he called a “Marine Mission at Large.” His interdenominational work as a lay missionary involved preaching and distributing tracts on board ships in an attempt to reach men who would otherwise attend no religious service. He called his interdenominational work “social religion” and when he read about the London YMCA he wasted no time in expressing his enthusiasm for the idea. In December 1851, Sullivan founded the Boston YMCA, the first YMCA in the United States. He found the ideals of the YMCA so compelling that he advocated for the newly created organization with the zeal of a preacher. Soon, Sullivan had managed to encourage the residents of cities and towns all over New England to form YMCA groups in their community. Though little detail is known of his life and career, Capt. Sullivan can be regarded as the inspiration and driving force for the establishment of the YMCA movement in the United States.\n\nChanning Tobias worked to create strong YMCAs in African-American communities throughout his career. He served 12 years as national student secretary, and in 1923, was appointed the senior secretary of the “Colored Men’s Department” of the YMCA.\n\nHe traveled extensively in the U.S. working to provide better YMCA services for African-Americans. His work also brought him overseas as a member of the student deputation that visited European relief areas and as a delegate and speaker at the World YMCA Conference in Finland. He provided training in places such as Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Palestine, and the Congo. Tobias’ efforts also reached outside his YMCA work.\n\nAs a well-known champion for civil rights, he was an unofficial advisor for Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. He was successful in helping to change discriminating policies in the U.S. Government, including in the Military. His influence extended beyond America. On the eve of WWII, Mahatma Gandhi broke his custom of silence every Monday to talk with Tobias about race relations during a trip to India.\n\nLeslie Tompkins joined the Yonkers (N.Y.) YMCA as a teenager and became employed working with the “boot blacks” and “newsboys”, the school dropouts of the 1900s. He graduated from Springfield College in 1918 shortly before entering the Army. After his military service, he joined the Maine State YMCA Committee, where he helped to found the Maine State YMCA Camp.\n\nHe served as general secretary of the Gloversville (N.Y.) and Amsterdam (N.Y.) YMCAs. He then joined the New York State YMCA Executive Committee, where he had training and support responsibilities for railroad and city associations. In 1937, he became the executive for personnel services of the National Council of YMCAs. He helped to implement a new approach to personnel policies and established a new certification system.\n\nIn 1946, he was named associate general secretary and served as executive of field services on the national staff until his retirement in 1957. He also served eight years as the executive director of the Association of Secretaries.\n\nDespite growing up in an era when Japanese-Americans faced the challenges of intense discrimination, Wada grew to become a regional and national leader for humanitarian causes.\n\nHe was an editor of the University of California at Berkeley newspaper in 1940, but was unable to secure employment as a journalist after college. He was drafted into the Army’s Military Intelligence Service in 1941. After he left the Army, he took his first job with the YMCA at the University of California’s Student YMCA in 1946. He went on to program director positions in the San Francisco YMCA, and became the executive director of the Buchanan Street Y after a short tenure with the California Youth Authority.\n\nWhile working in San Francisco, Wada established a bridge between Japanese-American and African-American youth. In retirement, Wada was appointed to the Board of Regents for the University of California, the first Asian regent in the board’s 109-year history.\n\nAt the age of 19 John Wanamaker was hired by the Philadelphia YMCA, officially becoming the first corresponding secretary in the YMCA movement. The Y centered itself around making a conscious evangelistic effort to bring the youth to faith in Jesus Christ. John initiated daily prayer meetings at noon. He also supervised the distribution of hundreds of New Testaments, enlisted and trained more than forty young men as Sunday School teachers and secured many pledges of total abstinence.\n\nWhen the Civil War began in 1861, Wanamaker helped other northern YMCA leaders who were forming the United States Christian Commission to support the enlisted men of the Union Army and Navy.\n\nAfter four years with the Association, John Wanamaker decided to leave the position for a highly successful and financially rewarding career in retail. Even with his thriving businesses however, he always made time for the Y, and in 1870 John Wanamaker was elected President of the Philadelphia Association. He continued to invest in the mission of the YMCA as a result of his business success, both nationally and internationally. He never lost sight of the promise of the Y mission to influence the lives of men in society.\n\nWilliam Wesley Peter began his work with the YMCA in 1904 as the Dayton, Ohio, association vice president while a student at Northwestern. In 1910, he earned his M.D. and became a medical missionary in China. Dr. Peter joined the health division of the Chinese National YMCA in 1913. He began organizing and lecturing at national health education programs in cooperation with the China Medical Missionary Association and the National Medical Association.\n\nWhile secretary with the National Committee in China, Dr. Peter organized the Typhus Commission; served as chairman of the Sanitation Board of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee; as a member of the Huai Valley Conservation Board; as Honorary Secretary of China Central Committee; a part of the American Red Cross; and a lecturer on public health at Peking Union Medical College and St. John’s University Medical School.\n\nMoreover, Dr. Peter also edited and founded Health Magazine, was co-author of “Famine Fever,” and has written numerous articles on phases of public health. In 1924, he was decorated by the Chinese Government and was made an Honorary Member of the Japanese Red Cross following relief work during the Japanese earthquake.\n\nThrough the Chinese National YMCA, Dr. Peter was a public health pioneer, establishing education systems and raising awareness for diseases like cholera, affecting thousands. His lectures brought forth the National Council of Health Education, which combined the principles of medical and educational organizations and the YMCA’s.\n\nAs Director of the Philadelphia MRC Len launched several major initiatives including the Delaware Valley Marketing Co-Op which involved all the YMCAs in the MRC with planned membership campaigns and membership trainings.\n\nLen developed several new initiatives as the East Field Executive including yearly multi-day CEO/CVO Institutes, Board Assessments, Member Service rating process, and continued the Marketing Co-Op that he initiated in Philadelphia. Len was able to bring together the MRCs and the East Field, which was not done anywhere else in the country. The East Field went from having the highest number of “troubled YMCAs” in the country to having the lowest. His initiative of pooled resources, his strategic plan, and his focus made the entire East Field organization most successful.\n\nWhile leading the Jerusalem YMCA during a difficult time after 9/11 and during the 2nd Gulf War he was able to bring the first USAID grant to the Jerusalem International YMCA (JIY). This meant JIY could continue services working with Palestinian and Israeli teens as well as running programs in some troubled northern Israeli Arab communities. He believed the good in people’s hearts would always come through. Len embodies the spirit of the YMCA, showing a concern and love for all.\n\nRobert Wilson was an outstanding basketball player at West Virginia State College, and after graduation, played for the Harlem Globetrotters, Chicago Stags, and Tri-City Blackhawks. He was one of the first men to break the NBA color barrier.\n\nAfter his basketball career, he became a teacher in North Carolina. In 1955, he accepted his first YMCA position as the youth director in the Milwaukee association. While there, he developed the first Hi-Y and Tri-Hi-Y training for YMCAs, as well as innovative outreach programs. He also served YMCAs in Dayton (Ohio) and Detroit (Mich.). Wilson became the chief executive officer of the YMWCA of Newark (N.J.) in 1970, the first African-American to lead a metropolitan YMCA.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Y gained solid financial footing while expanding its inner-city child care center and youth programs. In 1978, he joined the national staff as regional associate executive for the Northeast region, and later became the Management Resource Center (MRC) director for the YMCA of Greater New York. In 1989, he was appointed executive vice president of the YMCA Retirement Fund. Wilson was awarded the Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and was inducted into the Sports Halls of Fame at the Harlem (N.Y.) YMCA and West Virginia State College.\n\nLuther D. Wishard (1854-1925), the first YMCA student secretary, formed campus associations in the USA—including one at the divinity school at Vanderbilt University, the first YMCA at a theological school—and saw the campus YMCA movement grow explosively. Under his leadership, there were 345 student associations with more than 22,000 members by 1891. A devout Christian, Wishard thought of his YMCA work as a kind of evangelism, spreading both Christianity and the principles of the YMCA. As the American YMCA movement spread to other countries, Wishard convinced some of those early YMCA missionaries to transplant the student YMCA concept to the lands in which they were working. In 1884, the first student YMCA outside North America was established at Jaffna College in Ceylon. By 1887, student YMCAs had been created in Japan, China, India, Syria, and Turkey. Wishard’s astonishing contributions to the movement are historic. He took a “world tour of missions” to promote the student movement (with financial assistant from John Wanamaker), during which he helped establish a university YMCA in Tokyo. He later served as the first secretary of foreign work for the International Committee. And with all of that, Wishard still found the time, energy, and backing to create the YMCA center on Lake George at Silver Bay, N.Y., still a distinguished and active YMCA conference center.\n\nThe YMCA: From 1914 to 1918, the conflict that would come to be known as the First World War ensnared 28 nations with a total population of 1.5 billion, or 90% of the world’s known populace. Fifty-nine million men fought in World War I, resulting in 7.7 million deaths and 18.6 million injuries. By the time America entered the war in 1917, it was clear that World War I would be remembered as a great humanitarian crisis. Before the United states joined the battle, the YMCA leveraged America’s status as a neutral nation, providing relief to prisoners of war on both sides of the conflict. During this period, 65 YMCA secretaries worked with prisoners of war in Great Britain, France, Italy, Serbia, Austria, Germany, Russia, Bulgaria, and Romania. Serving over five million detainees through morale-building activities and the provision of equipment, the YMCA’s work ensured that war prisoners received both humane treatment and mental welfare. The ability of the YMCA to engage in this work speaks volumes to its credibility, and the value world leaders placed upon the Movement. On April 6, 1917 President Wilson declared that the United States would join the Allied Forces, officially beginning America’s involvement in the war. Immediately, the YMCA pledged its support. Expanding upon its legacy of service during previous conflicts, the YMCA was asked to take on nearly all human service activities for the U.S. military. Over the next two years, the YMCA dispatched 25,926 men and women to minister to the mental, spiritual, and physical needs of the Allied Forces in what former President William Howard Taft called “one of the greatest achievements of peace in all the history of human warfare.”\n\nThe Work: Selecting from approximately 200,000 applications, the YMCA divided the workers between home and overseas assignments. Women workers comprised 20% of the total, with twice as many serving overseas as on the home front. Drawing upon its expertise in mental, spiritual, and physical development, the YMCA brought the full suite of its programs to bear in the war effort. Educators offered literacy and English instruction as well as courses on a wide variety of topics. Ministers provided spiritual guidance and conducted religious services.
