        "text": "Bio\n\nMy specialization is Twentieth Century American literature, with particular emphasis on Modern fiction and American culture (fiction and cultural studies of the 1910s-1950s), I split devotion to the so-called “standard” canon with that of African American literature. My interests includes the writings of contemporary novelists as well, such as those by Tobias Wolff, Caryl Philips, and Paule Marshall. Sherwood Anderson, Ernest Hemingway, Toni Morrison, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Percival Everett, Cormac McCarthy, Richard Wright, Charles Chesnutt, Flannery O’Connor, Ishmael Reed, and Zora Neale Hurston are also among my favorites. My primary scholarly concerns are issues of race and identity as they relate to notions of Americana. My research interests also include narrative construction as it relates to ontology in African American fiction, the intersection (of narrative technique) in film and literature, and American history and popular culture of the 1920s and 1930s especially. See my forthcoming edited collection from Kent State University Press, Teaching Hemingway and Film as one example. Further, in Hemingway, Race and Art: Bloodlines and the Color Line, I investigate Ernest Hemingway’s rarely recognized, life-long interest in race. And in Understanding James Baldwin, I explore the literary life of Baldwin, one of the twentieth-century’s true social justice warriors. I am also the editor of the recently published Norton Critical Edition of Winesburg, Ohio, by Sherwood Anderson, an author whose imprint on American Modernism is irrefutable.\n\nI earned an Outstanding Teaching Award and was inducted into the North Carolina State University Academy of Outstanding Teachers in 2020.\n\nIn 2023, I was the recipient of an NCSU Outstanding Extension Award and inducted into the North Carolina State University Academy of Outstanding Faculty in Engagement and Extension.\n\nFollow me at:\n\nhttp://ncsu.academia.edu/marcdudley\n\nand\n\nmarckdudley.com\n\nand on Twitter @RealMarcDudley\n\nProjects\n\nMy current projects have me working with the texts of Ernest Hemingway, Toni Morrison, Cormac McCarthy, and Ralph Ellison. Hemingway, Race, and Art: Bloodlines and the Color Line is a rare, comprehensive exploration of Ernest Hemingway’s life-long engagement with American racial politics. In Understanding James Baldwin, I explore the life and social advocacy work of one of America’s most celebrated literary voices. Recently, I consulted on and was featured in the PBS documentary “Hemingway,” a film by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick (2021).\n\nExtension and Community Engagement\n\nIn recent years, I have been a frequent host and mediator of book discussions for the “Read Smart” discussion series sponsored by NCSU Libraries and the Wake County Public Library (Village District). I have also been a guest on local radio (WUNC) and I’ve spoken widely on the literary craft of both Ernest Hemingway and James Baldwin for such organizations as Winston-Salem Writers and NCSU’s own Osher Lifelong Learning Institute.\n\nFor my engagement efforts, in 2023 I was awarded an NCSU Outstanding Extension Award and was inducted into the North Carolina State University Academy of Outstanding Faculty in Engagement and Extension.\n\nPublications\n\nBooks:\n\nTeaching Hemingway and Film.
