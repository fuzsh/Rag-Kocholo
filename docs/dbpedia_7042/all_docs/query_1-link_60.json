Gray\n\nFrom 1880 to 1920, Indiana experienced a golden age of literature, with Hoosier authors achieving both national prominence and national acclaim. These writers provided readers with stories that emphasized traditional values and offered shelter from an ever-changing world. Attention focused especially on four men, including the great Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Booth Tarkington and noted newspaper columnist and humorist George Ade. The other member of this special group – Meredith Nicholson – also won enormous success with his novels. Nicholson stands as the most Hoosier of all the Indiana writers, serving as an outspoken advocate for the state. In addition to writing such national bestsellers as Zelda Dameron and The House of a Thousand Candles, his best-known novel, Nicholson won praise as an insightful essayist, with his work published in such national magazines as The Saturday Evening Post and Atlantic.\n\nLibraries may purchase through ProQuest or Overdrive.\n\nThe People’s Choice: Congressman Jim Jontz of Indiana\n\nRay E.

Now responsible for taking care of his widowed mother and supporting his four brothers, he took up the reins of the plow to begin preparing the field for planting. Family legend has it that the young farmer, Theodore Clement Steele, tied “colored ribbons to the handles of the plow so that he could watch the ribbons in the wind and the effect that they had on the [surrounding] colors.” Recognizing Steele’s passion for art, his mother supported his choice to make his living as an artist.

Ryan White, however, had been diagnosed with AIDS from contaminated blood-based products used to treat his hemophilia. “It was my decision to live a normal life, go to school, be with friends and enjoy day-to-day activities,” White said. “It was not going to be easy.” Those words were an understatement, to say the least.

Their story includes much of early 20th-century America: the rise of unions, the plunge into the Great Depression, the patriotism of World War II, and the starkness of McCarthyism. It is flavored by delivery men hawking fruit and ice, street sports, and Saturday matinees that began with newsreels. Immigration status colors every scene, adding to their story deportation and citizenship, generational problems unique to new immigrants, and a miraculous message of hope.\n\nLibraries may purchase through ProQuest or Overdrive.\n\nThe Miami Indians of Indiana: A Persistent People, 1654-1994\n\nStewart Rafert\n\nNow scattered in small communities in northern Indiana, the Eastern Miami Indians, once a well-known tribe, have lived in undeserved obscurity since the 1840s. In recent years they have become more visible as they have sought restoration of treaty rights and have revitalized their culture. The post-removal history of the Indiana Miami tribe is a rich texture of social, legal, and economic history, much enhanced by folklore and a rich series of photographic images. In The Miami Indians of Indiana: A Persistent People, 1654–1994, Rafert explores the history and culture of the Miami Indians.\n\nBuy from:\n\nGoogle Play | Basile History Market (Adobe Digital Editions)\n\nLibraries may purchase through ProQuest or Overdrive.\n\nThe Native Americans\n\nElizabeth Glenn and Stewart Rafert\n\nNative American ancestors inhabited the land of Indiana from around 9,500 BC. European contact with Indiana’s Miami, Wea, Mascouten and Shawnee tribes began in 1679. However, Indians were forced onto western reservations in the 1830s. By 1850 only a portion of the Miami remained in Indiana. Many natives either assimilated into white culture or hid their identity. This scenario changed when Native Americans served in the military and at home during World War II. Afterward, Indians from many lineages flocked to Indiana. Along with Indiana’s Miami and Potawatomi, they are creating a diverse Indian culture, expressed through pan-Indian as well as tribal activities, that enriches the lives of all Hoosiers.\n\nBuy from:\n\neBooks.com | Google Play | Basile History Market (Adobe Digital Editions)\n\nLibraries may purchase through ProQuest or Overdrive.\n\nCampaign Crossroads: Presidential Politics in Indiana from Lincoln to Obama\n\nAndrew E.

Two years later, he bought out his partners and renamed the establishment L.S. Ayres and Company.

Juxtaposed with its stand against slavery a second tenet of the Society’s creed – adherence to peace – also challenged the unity of Friends when the dreaded conflict erupted. Indiana Quakers Confront the Civil War chronicles for the first time the military activities of Indiana Quakers during America’s bloodiest war and explores the motivation behind the abandonment, at least temporarily, of their long-standing testimony against war.\n\nLibraries may purchase through ProQuest or Overdrive.\n\nThe Kimberlins Go to War: A Union Family in Copperhead Country\n\nMichael B.

Shively\n\nThe stories of seven men and one woman from Indiana who survived the horrors of captivity under the Japanese in the Pacific during World War II are captured in vivid detail by author John C. Shively. These Hoosiers stationed in the Philippines were ordered to surrender following the fall of Bataan and Corregidor in 1942. It was the largest surrender of American armed forces in U.S. history.

It examines antebellum religion, education, reform, and politics, and how they affected the identity of not just one young man, but of a nation caught up in a civil war. Furthermore, it discusses how a native-born Hoosier reached the decision to fight for the South, while detailing a unique war experience and the postwar life of a proud Rebel who returned to the North after the guns fell silent and tried to remake his life in a very different state and nation than the ones he had left in 1860.\n\nThe book uses not just Preston’s story, but that of his family as a lens to help us glimpse the past. Preston’s paternal family had strong ties to the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and Washington College (now Washington and Lee University). The maternal side of Preston’s family tree included his grandfather, Governor Noah Noble.\n\nBuy from:\n\nKobo | eBooks.com | Google Play | Kindle Store | Barnes and Noble for Nook |Basile History Market (Adobe Digital Editions)\n\nLibraries may purchase through ProQuest or Overdrive.\n\nShadow of Shiloh: Major General Lew Wallace in the Civil War\n\nGail Stephens\n\nThirty-two years after the Battle of Shiloh, Lew Wallace returned to the battlefield, mapping the route of his April 1862 march. Ulysses S. Grant, Wallace’s commander at Shiloh, expected Wallace and his Third Division to arrive in the early afternoon of April 6. However, they did not arrive until nightfall, and in the aftermath of the bloodbath at Shiloh, Grant attributed Wallace’s late arrival to a failure to obey orders. By mapping the route of his march and proving how and where he had actually been that day, the 67-year-old Wallace hoped to remove the stigma of “Shiloh and its slanders.” That did not happen. Shiloh still defines Wallace’s military reputation, overshadowing the rest of his stellar military career and making it easy to forget that he was a rising military star, the youngest major general in the Union. In Shadow of Shiloh, Gail Stephens addresses Wallace’s military career and its place in the larger context of Civil War military history.\n\nBuy from:\n\nKobo | eBooks.com | Google Play | Kindle Store | Barnes & Noble Nook | Basile History Market (Adobe Digital Editions)\n\nLibraries may purchase through ProQuest or Overdrive.\n\nA Soldier in World War I: The Diary of Elmer W.
