        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Gustavus John Esselen Award for Chemistry in the Public Interest is one of the most prestigious honors provided by the Northeastern Section of the American Chemical Society. The award annually recognizes a chemist whose scientific and technical work has contributed to the public well-being, and has thereby communicated positive values of the chemical profession. The Awardee should be a living resident of the United States or Canada at the time of nomination, and the significance of this work should have become apparent within the five years preceding nomination.\n\nThe Award was established in 1987 to honor the memory of Gustavus John Esselen, a distinguished member of the Northeastern Section. The first awardees were F. Sherwood Rowland and Mario J. Molina, who subsequently received the Nobel Prize. As can be seen by the list of past recipients, any field of chemistry is valid as long as the scientific work has clearly contributed to the public well-being and its value to society has become apparent within the last five years.\n\nThe award consists of a medal and a check for $5,000. Travel expenses incidental to the conferring of this award will be reimbursed. The award will usually be held in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the April meeting of the Northeastern Section. The Awardee will deliver an address on the subject of the work for which the honor is being conferred, or for work in progress which is also directed to chemistry in the public interest.\n\nA Brief History\n\nIn 1985 an inquiry was made as to whether the Section would wish to honor another former leader of the Northeastern Section. The Esselen family proposed to donate a sum of money to provide for an award in the memory of Gustavus John Esselen II, Chairman in 1922 and 1923, and a member of the ACS Board of Directors for many years. In 1948, Dr. Esselen received a special award, the James Flack Norris Honor Scroll, “as the person who has done most to advance the interests of the Northeastern Section.” A committee consisting of William O. Foye, Truman S. Light, Arthur S. Obermayer, and Myron S. Simon, Section Chairman, met with Esselen’s son, Gustavus J. Esselen III, and recommended to the Board of Directors that the Section accept the offer, which it did. The committee and Mr. Esselen agreed that the award should not be in a specific field of chemistry, but instead should have the special purpose of emphasizing the positive values of chemistry to mankind. In light of the climate of the day, with the disaster of Bhopal on every chemist’s mind and the public receiving nothing but negative stories about chemistry from the media, this was to be a small step toward establishing a balance.\n\nMr. Esselen proposed to add a bronze medal to the monetary award. A prominent sculptor from Newton, Massachusetts, Lloyd Lillie, was selected to prepare the design which was then approved by members of the Esselen family. The fact that Dr. Esselen had done much work in plastics during his career led his son to propose that the bronze medal be imbedded in a block of clear plastic, which was done, to give a very distinctive addition to the ceremonial presentation.\n\nThe first presentation of the Gustavus John Esselen Award for Chemistry in the Public Interest was made in 1987 to F. Sherwood Rowland and Mario J. Molina for their work on the chemical processes which were destroying the stratospheric ozone layer, explaining the formation of the Antarctic Ozone Hole. Since then, the award has been given to chemists in several fields of chemistry and has become a much coveted prize.\n\n– Myron S. Simon, assisted by Phyllis A. Brauner, Arno Heyn and Arthur S. Obermayer with suggestions from Edward R. Atkinson. “The Last Quarter Century, Part I,” The Nucleus, Northeastern Section of the American Chemical Society, Inc., February, 1998, pp 17-18\n\nClick to see the article “In Memory of Gutavus John J. Esselen III” from the October 2007 issue of The Nucleus >\n\n2023 Esselen Award Call for Nominations\n\nThe Northeastern Section of the American Chemical Society (NESACS) is inviting nominations for the 37th Gustavus John Esselen Award for Chemistry in the Public Interest. This prestigious annual award is given to a chemical scientist whose scientific and technical work has contributed significantly to the public well-being thereby communicating the positive values of the chemical profession. The awardee shall be a living resident of the United States or Canada at the time of nomination and the public impact of the work should have become apparent within the five years preceding the nomination.\n\nThere is no limitation to the field of chemistry. The selection committee focuses on the general public recognition of the work, as well as its scientific/technical significance.\n\nThe Award consists of a bronze medal and the sum of $5,000. Travel expenses incidental to the conferring of the award will be reimbursed. The award will be presented at the April 2024 meeting of the Section. The Awardee is expected to deliver an address on the subject of the work for which the honor is conferred, or for work in progress which is also directed toward chemistry in the public interest.\n\nNominations should be submitted as a single pdf file including:\n\nA letter signed by the primary sponsor with a description of the nominee’s work recognized as making a major contribution to the public welfare and as communicating positive values of the chemical profession, plus the names of two co-sponsors;\n\nShort supporting co-sponsor statements;\n\nThe nominee’s professional biography including a list of no more than ten of the nominee’s publications selected for their pertinence to the work nominated for recognition; and\n\nCopies of popular and technical press news or feature articles indicative of public benefit and interest.\n\nNominations Are Due October 13, 2023 to John Macor at john.macor@sionnatx.com with cc to JPiperGrady@gmail.com.

Address: 11 Thaxter St., Hingham, MA 02043.\n\nBio\n\nGustavus John Esselen, II was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, June 30, 1888, the son of Gustavus J. and Joanna Blyleven Esselen. All of his higher education was obtained at Harvard University where he was awarded the A.B. (magna cum laude) in chemistry in 1909 and a doctorate in 1912. In that same year he married Henrietta W. Locke who with three children survived him at the time of his death on Oct. 22, 1952.\n\nUntil 1921 he was a member of the research staff of General Electric Co. in Lynn and then of Arthur D. Little, Inc. of Cambridge, MA. At the latter firm he was associated with Little and Wallace Murray in the fabrication of a “silk” purse from reconstituted collagen, in turn derived from a sow’s ear. In 1930 he founded Gustavus J. Esselen, Inc., which subsequently became Esselen Research Corporation and then, following a merger, Esselen Research Division of United States Testing Co., Inc. During this period he was involved in solving a variety of problems submitted by industrial clients. Among these was the development of anhydride curing agents for epoxy resins and poly(vinylbutyral) as an improved material for safety glass, both of which enjoyed considerable commercial success. More than 40 U.S. patents were issued as a result of his research efforts.\n\nEsselen was a member of the American Chemical Society for 43 years during which time his outstanding services to the society and the profession of chemistry were recognized and honored, not only in his native New England, but throughout the United States. He was twice chairman of the Northeastern Section, ACS (1922-23) and served as councilor and director of the national organization, during which time he was a member of the ACS Council Policy Committee. His chairmanship of the national ACS meetings held in Boston in 1928 and 1939 was an outstanding service. He was on the advisory boards of I/EC and C&E News, 1946-48. In 1948 he received the James Flack Norris Honor Scroll as “the person who has done most to advance the interests of the Northeastern Section.” In 1950 he was made an honorary member of the American Institute of Chemists for his services to the profession of chemistry and chemical engineering. From 1919 to 1951 he was chairman of the American Section of the Society of Chemical Industry. Prior to World War II he was a reserve officer in the U.S. Army’s Chemical Warfare Service. During the war he was a committee chairman with the Office of Scientific Research and Development.\n\nEsselen’s distinguished contributions to chemistry and chemical engineering were in accordance with the highest ethics of these professions; his recognition of the duties of a professional led to his exertion of a wise and beneficent influence on all the professional societies to which he gave so generously of his time and led to his participation in numerous civic activities in the Boston area. Esselen was a very sensitive person, devoted throughout his life to the fine arts and music. His motto, contained on a tapestry in his office, was a quotation of Richard Wilstþtter, “It is our destiny, not to create, but to unveil.”\n\nAdapted from Edward R. Atkinson, in W.D.
