        "text": "During World War I, African American Minnesotans wanted to serve their state and their nation. Historically, however, the U.S. military had been racist in its recruiting. It allowed African Americans to serve only in segregated units. Facing this institutional racism, the African American community of Minnesota asked Governor J.A.A. Burnquist to form an all-African American battalion of the Minnesota Home Guard. The Sixteenth Battalion became the first Minnesota-recruited African American military unit in state history.\n\nWhen the Minnesota National Guard was federalized in the spring of 1917, the state was left without any military organization. To defend the home front the Minnesota Commission of Public Safety created the Minnesota Home Guard. The Home Guard existed for the duration of World War I. Units performed civilian and military duties.\n\nMinnesota’s Home Guard units followed the racist recruiting policies of the U.S. military. Still, African American men saw the Home Guard as an opportunity. A leader in the community named Clarence Wigington petitioned Governor Burnquist to form an all-African American battalion of the Home Guard. In the racist climate that prevailed, a “separate but equal” unit was the most feasible option.\n\nOn April 20, 1918, nearly a year after the creation of the Home Guard, the all-African American Sixteenth Battalion was ordered to form. Before this order was received, companies A and B formed in St. Paul. Led by Wigington, African American men met at the old state capitol building. Wigington gave an address; afterward, the men were sworn in. Wigington became captain of Company A. Orrington C. Hall led Company B.\n\nOn April 26, 1918, companies C and D formed in Minneapolis and were sworn in at city hall. Gale C. Hilyer led Company C and Charles Sumner Smith captained Company D. A medical corps headed by Dr. Valdo Turner formed. About five hundred men enlisted in the battalion overall, with Major Jose H. Sherwood in command. The Sixteenth also had a band and drum corps. The band was led by Professor William H. Howard and the drum corps by Charles Miller.\n\nThe officers of the Sixteenth were all men of color. Due to the poor treatment they received when trying to enlist, the men of the battalion demanded that their officers be of their own race. The Adjutant General’s office agreed. As the companies formed some whites criticized the state government for allowing African Americans to become officers.\n\nAfter its formation the battalion became active. Spanish American War veterans and ex-regulars ensured the battalion was well drilled. Each company began a schedule of drilling every week. On Memorial Day in 1918 it marched in parades alongside all white Home Guard units in both Minneapolis and St. Paul. The men did not have uniforms at the time but wore white gloves. According to newspaper accounts, the battalion received special applause from the crowd.\n\nThe African American community of the Twin Cities embraced the battalion. There were patriotic rallies and parades and the battalion band became popular. It played at community events, dances, and battalion drills. The Sixteenth escorted African American draftees to the train station. The battalion also provided a line of communication between the state government and the African American community.\n\nDuring the summer of 1918 the battalion experienced infighting. Some men felt they should be in charge because they had military experience, which most of the officers lacked. Many expressed a desire to leave the unit. Discipline was not maintained. Attendance suffered, but the battalion continued to host events.\n\nWhen World War I ended, Home Guard units began to muster out. The Sixteenth continued to operate. Its band played concerts as late as February 1919. Determined to continue serving, leaders of the battalion pushed for the unit to be inducted into the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nOn April 25, 1919, the Minnesota Legislature approved the formation of a separate battalion in addition to units of the Minnesota National Guard. This new unit was composed of the Sixteenth Battalion and was officially designated the First Infantry Battalion of the Minnesota Militia. Some African American veterans returning from overseas joined the new unit. The African American men of this unit were not officially part of the Minnesota National Guard. Like the Sixteenth, it was a segregated unit."
