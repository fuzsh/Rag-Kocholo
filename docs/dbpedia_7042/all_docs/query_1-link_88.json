        "text": "In 1773, at the age of fourteen, Cuffe began his career as a crew member onboard a whaling ship bound for the West Indies.14 During this time, tensions were mounting between the United States and Great Britain over maritime trade, taxation policies, and representation in Parliament. Once the American Revolutionary War formally began on April 19, 1775, the British navy implemented an “undeclared commercial blockade” along the North American Atlantic coast and issued a “seize and detain” order against American shipping in September.15 In 1776, while onboard a whaling ship, Cuffe was captured by the British Navy and detained in a jail near New York harbor as a prisoner of war for three months.16 Following his release, Cuffe decided to begin his own maritime trading business and presented his plans for commercial intercourse with the State of Connecticut and Nantucket Island to his brother, David.17 Cuffe became the “master of a small covered vessel of twelve tons,” and during their ventures, the Cuffe brothers experienced many difficulties such as being robbed by pirates on two occasions.18 In 1784, Cuffe married Alice Abel Pequot—a descendant of the Wampanoag tribe to which his mother belonged.19 The couple settled in a small house on the Westport River.20 He soon procured a vessel of eighteen tons, in which he sailed to the banks of St. George, “in quest of codfish, and returned with a valuable cargo.”21 In addition to his reputation as a successful maritime entrepreneur, Cuffe was also known as a faithful Quaker, Federalist, and committed anti-slavery advocate with connections to prominent abolitionists in Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and London.22\n\nAs a man of color, Cuffe often experienced race-based inequities in a period marked by enslavement, subjugation, and the denial of rights and freedoms to African Americans and Native Americans.23 Weary of the seemingly dismal future for African Americans in the United States, the majority of whom were enslaved at that time, Cuffe contemplated possibilities for settlement in a location where freed African Americans could experience equality and justice. Through the transatlantic Quaker network, Cuffe first learned about the British colony of Sierra Leone and the African Institution, a British abolitionist and anti-slavery group.24 Cuffe secured the blessing of his fellow Friends to establish trade between Sierra Leone and the United States and was provided two certificates to travel to the colony.25 As Cuffe’s influence grew internationally, English abolitionists began to view him as a potential partner in ensuring the success of Sierra Leone for those formerly enslaved in the United States and England.26 At the turn of the century, Cuffe began making arrangements for the settlement of free African Americans in Sierra Leone.\n\nThe West African coastal site, later known as Sierra Leone, was home to the Mende and the Temne—the largest of the region’s many ethnic groups.27 Following the abolition of slavery in Britain in 1772, formerly enslaved individuals were termed “Black Poor,” and in 1786, the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor formed plans for their repatriation in Sierra Leone.28 In addition to London’s “Black Poor” population, Black Loyalists, to whom the British gave land in Nova Scotia and Canada, would settle in Sierra Leone.29 These Loyalists were those formerly enslaved in the American colonies who obtained freedom from slavery by taking refuge with British forces during the American Revolution.30 This decision to emancipate the individuals enslaved in the rebelling colonies who would join the British army was issued on November 7, 1775, by Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia.31 The proclamation reflected military strategy rather than a commitment to abolitionist principles. In 1791, Britain established the colony of Sierra Leone to provide a home for these individuals in Africa. The colony presented possibilities for abolitionists and pro-slavery advocates alike.\n\nFor British abolitionists, Black emigration provided several advantages: a way to alleviate the Black residents of their subpar living conditions in London; an opportunity to include Black individuals in the Christianizing mission in Africa; and as a path for Black self-governance and freedom. Those in favor of the slave trade, but opposed to integration, considered settlement an effective way to rid Britain of its Black population.32 Similarly, for pro-slavery Americans, African-American settlement provided an opportunity to elude the challenges of emancipation and assimilation. Given that the United States had not yet abolished slavery, some argued that the emigration of the country’s free African-American population to Sierra Leone would prevent slave rebellions and violence between white and Black Americans.33 For some American proponents of abolition, such as Cuffe, Sierra Leone offered promises of freedom from racial injustice and the potential for economic prosperity. Cuffe envisioned that his settlement in Sierra Leone would position him to become a key figure in the economic development of the West African regional and international economy. He believed that if local production of exportable commodities throughout West Africa increased alongside the development of local shipping capabilities, the need for participation in the international slave trade and thus, the number of enslaved individuals exported, would eventually decrease.34 In effect, Cuffe’s theory would contribute to the abolition of the slave trade, and bring about a West African transatlantic economy on par with that of the United States and Europe.35 In 1810, Cuffe embarked on his first trip to the British colony of Sierra Leone to explore the possibilities for African-American settlement.36\n\nIn 1810, Cuffe and his all-African-American crew aboard the Traveller made two voyages to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where they remained for three months at a time.37 Upon arrival, Cuffe was treated with “great kindness” by the governor and he proposed a number of “improvements.”38 After determining the colony a suitable location for settlement, Cuffe sailed to England where he was granted an audience before the African Institution.39 The institution agreed to “defray the expenses of seven immigrants” to alleviate a portion of the initiative’s cost and would provide them with land and farming provisions upon arrival.40 Also, during his visit, Cuffe helped establish the “Friendly Society of Sierra Leone,” a trading organization involving the Black settlers and natives, which he hoped would encourage mass emigration to the colony.41 Cuffe envisioned that these emigrants would promote the Christian faith, establish business enterprises, and advocate for the abolition of slavery.42 In 1812, explaining his interest in the colony, Cuffe stated:\n\nHaving been informed that there was a settlement of people of colour at Sierra Leone under the immediate guardianship of a civilized power, I have for these many years past felt a lively interest in their behalf, wishing that the inhabitants of the colony might become established in the truth, and thereby be instrumental in its promotion amongst our American brethren. It was these sentiments that first influenced me to visit my friends in this colony, and instead of repenting, I have cause to rejoice in having found many who are inclined to listen and attend to the precepts of our holy religion.43\n\n…our prayer to God is, that our brethren who live in distant lands and are held in bondage, and groan under the galling chain of slavery; that they may be liberated, and enjoy the liberty which God has granted unto all his faithful saints.44\n\nAlthough some African Americans rejected efforts on behalf of white-led institutions to settle free Blacks in Africa, most approved of Cuffe’s well-intentioned plans for the freedom and prosperity of his people. Cuffe planned to make one voyage per year, in which he would transport African Americans to Sierra Leone and return to the United States with valuable cargo.71 Cuffe received an English land grant to provide settlers with tracts of land and he personally supplied one year’s worth of farming provisions per settler.72 Cuffe’s initiative, however, was short-lived. Upon his return from Sierra Leone in 1816, he became seriously ill and died on September 7, 1817.73 Despite having made only one successful trip, knowledge of Cuffe’s “back to Africa” effort was widespread and influenced other nineteenth century African Americans—such as Henry Highland Garnet, Martin R. Delany, and Bishop Henry McNeal Turner—to consider the prospect of settlement in Sierra Leone, Haiti, and Liberia.\n\nFollowing the example of the British African Institution, across the Atlantic Ocean Americans laid the foundations for their own institutional-level settlement initiatives. Like its British counterpart, the ACS was equally fraught with competing motives and goals. Although the ACS attracted abolitionists—who believed that African Americans would never be treated as equal citizens in the United States—it was primarily sponsored by the owners of enslaved individuals who were concerned with removing the presence of free African Americans from the United States, rather than with supporting African development. The leaders of the ACS sought Cuffe’s endorsement on the basis that they shared a common goal of settling freed African Americans in Africa.74 Given the discrepancy between Cuffe’s motives and those of the ACS, Cuffe declined to support the society.75 Despite lacking Cuffe’s blessing, the ACS continued to grow in influence and even attracted the espousal of American presidents.\n\nPresident Madison was a strong supporter of the ACS and would later become its third president in 1833.76 President Madison was an early advocate for African-American settlement and wrote in 1819 that “the freed blacks ought to be permanently removed beyond the region occupied by or allotted to a White population.”77 Other prominent American politicians who supported the settlement project included Henry Clay, a founder of the ACS who, as a senator from Kentucky, advocated on the society’s behalf in Congress, and who succeeded President Madison as its fourth president from 1836 to 1849.78\n\nThe abolition of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, tensions with Britain, institutional colonization and abolitionist efforts, and African-American-led “back to Africa” initiatives all shaped the nation during the eighteenth century. At the center of these events was the pioneering figure of Paul Cuffe. His expansive maritime travels and activism for people of color spanned from English ports to the White House, where he presented his plans for improving the livelihood of his fellow African Americans in Sierra Leone. A monument was erected in commemoration of Cuffe’s legacy on June 15, 1913, dedicated by Horatio P. Howard, Cuffe’s great-grandson.79 On the grounds of the Friends’ Meeting at Central Village in Westport, Massachusetts, the five-foot stone monument is located near the graves of Paul Cuffe and his wife with the inscription: “In memory of Captain Paul Cuffe: Patriot, Navigator, Educator, Philanthropist, Friend. A Noble Character.”80 The pursuit of African-American liberties abroad did not end with Cuffe, but rather, many nineteenth-century African Americans built upon his legacy. For example, in 1818, Prince Saunders, a free African-American man from Boston, traveled to several African-American communities promoting emigration to the newly independent nation of Haiti at the request of King Henri Christophe.81 Perhaps the most well-known figure associated with the “back to Africa” movement, Marcus Garvey (1887-1940), sought to establish an independent Black state in Liberia among other locations around the world.82"
