        "text": "Top (left to right): Gillian Black, Kim Coughlin-Lamphear, Shannon Collart, Kelly Fortner, Brec Ronis - Bottom (left to right): Kali Rothrock, Douglas Smith, Rene Smith, Peggy Stewart, Anna Thaler\n\n- Gillian Black, Academic Advisor, Academic & Career Advising Center\n\nFor almost 10 years now Gilly has been working tirelessly to support students through the rigors of earning a degree in the College of Natural Resources and Sciences by creating a more inclusive environment.\n\n- Kim Coughlin-Lamphear, Accessibility Advisor, Student Disability Resource Center\n\nMost of the accomplishments I have mentioned above are beyond the scope of Kim’s job description, and have been initiated with her characteristic enthusiasm and willingness to go above and beyond for the benefit of our students. That’s why Kim deserves recognition as an outstanding staff member and asset to the whole campus community. Thank you, Kim!\n\n- Shannon Collart, Advancement Events Coordinator, University Advancement\n\nIn every aspect of her work, she shows ongoing devotion to the University and its principles. Colleagues and coworkers consistently show excitement to work with her, enjoyment of the spirit she brings to every endeavor, and appreciation for her contribution to the result. In my 9 years as a staff member, I have not encountered anyone so deserving of this recognition.\n\n- Kelly Fortner, Student Support Coordinator, Center for Community Based Learning\n\n\"In all aspects, Kelly is both a hard-working staff member and valiant proponent of the benefits of community-based learning. They serve students diligently, equitably and respectfully to make sure their community experiences are successful, and they are supported with a strong understanding of their career paths. In this year’s transition for the CCBL program, Kelly provides critical support for these programs and has stepped up to assist with many tasks once covered by other staff. In all realms, Kelly is a delight and honor to work with - they has a sunny disposition and “can-do” attitude that is contagious, and lifts the team’s spirits even when the going is rough.\"\n\n- Brec Ronis, Administrative Support Coordinator, Art + Film\n\nAs ASC for the largest department in CAHSS, Brec Ronis is both highly effective and efficient in her job, while also being incredibly kind and personable. She has very successfully navigated the merger of the Departments of Art and Film - folding her now increased and even more complex duties seamlessly into her workflow. She creates a welcoming environment for all of the students, staff, and faculty that she interacts with on a daily basis, and is central to the successful functioning of our program.\n\n- Kali Rothrock, CARE Services Case Manager, Office of the Dean of Students\n\nIt takes a strong willed and compassionate individual to address complex and challenging issues on campus such as prevention of sexualized violence and basic needs but Kali has never shied away from being a leader in advocating for these areas. Kali will go out of her way to meet and present to others to better serve our campus which makes her one of the most accessible resources our campus has to offer.\n\n- Douglas Smith, Coordinator, Umoja Center for Pan African Student Excellence\n\nAs student Jaguar Smith sums up, “Douglas goes above and beyond to show his love and support for his community and has set the bar for how we must interact with, support, and engage with one another. Every day I see Doug maintain a positive attitude, despite the obstacles he or others may face, and seeing that allows everyone around him to continue moving forward with faith and resilience. I am honored and privileged to work with a person such as Douglas Smith, and aspire to be the positive, uplifting, and transformative leader that he has proven to be. I am grateful for the time that I have been able to work alongside Doug and know that no one is more deserving of this award than he.\"\n\n- Rene Smith, Department Coordinator, Anthropology; Geography, Environment & Spatial Analysis; World Languages & Cultures; Center for Translation & Interpretation\n\nRené has shown an exceptional ability to cope with challenging transition and increasing workloads while maintaining excellent collegial relationships at all levels of engagement that has led to consistent stability for students, faculty and staff despite myriad challenges of the last few years. René goes above and beyond the call of duty to mentor other ASCs and ASAs, in addition to being a consistent asset for the CAHSS dean’s office that has seen a complete turnover of staff and administration in the last year. Her responsiveness, communication skills, and professionalism is a model for us all.\n\n- Peggy Stewart, Administrative Support Assistant; Environmental Studies; Environment & Community M.A.; History; International Studies; Politics; Religious Studies\n\nPeggy Stewart has, for 13 years now, gone well above and beyond the requirements of her job. She has done so with grace and with humility, with generosity and with clarity, and she has done so in the context of organizational instability, staffing shortages, and increased workload. This is the third time our programs have nominated Peggy for a staff recognition award. In the interest of equity and justice, the faculty of Peggy’s six academic departments would love to double her pay. Since we cannot do that, we are unanimously in strong support of her work being recognized and celebrated through this award.\n\n- Anna Thaler, Academic Advisor, Academic & Career Advising Center\n\nAnna works tirelessly to promote student success through their dedication to their advisees, campus collaborations and creating a more inclusive environment.\n\nAlexander Bippus\n\nJessica Citti\n\nKristina Hunt\n\nRob Keever\n\nPamela Kirschner\n\nSamantha (Sammi) Martinez\n\nNora Montoya\n\nJaneth Serrano\n\nLaura Sullivan\n\nNicki Viso\n\nSusan Wright\n\n*This year there are 11 award recipients as there was a tie for the 10th spot.\n\nAlexander Bippus, Indian Natural Resources Science and Engineering Program + Diversity in STEM\n\nAlex Bippus is an asset to Cal Poly Humboldt students through their natural mentorship abilities, an asset to the INRSEP+ program, and an asset to Cal Poly Humboldt. Through one-on-one student mentoring, INRSEP+ team work, cross university collaborations, and community engagement, they have demonstrated they are truly an exemplary employee.\n\nJessica Citti, Learning Center\n\nHumboldt is very fortunate to have Dr. Citti as a staff member on our campus. They approach every challenge and opportunity with great thoughtfulness, collaborative spirit, and student-centeredness that is truly amazing. Dr. Citti is a model to Humboldt students. They are kind, professional, collegial, curious, equitable, and collaborative. I believe they embody what we hope Humboldt students will become as future graduates.\n\nKristina Hunt, Academic and Career Advising Center\n\nKristina is dedicated and devoted to student success. She is a fabulous co-worker, team player and career services advocate. She is always to take on new challenges and responsibilities and does so with grace and great attitude.\n\nRob Keever, Dean of Students Office\n\nRob is an amazing colleague and champion of student support. Rob has created and started many initiatives to institutionalize and systematically change how our campus supports students. Rob is an invaluable resource and an asset to the university.\n\nPamela Kirschner, Office of Student Life\n\nShe is kind, optimistic, and incredibly hard working. Pam has been thrown hurdle after hurdle that she overcomes with intentional optimism while also challenging the process to ensure it best serves our students and the university.\n\nSamantha (Sammi) Martinez, Retention through Academic Mentoring Program\n\nSammi channels her lived experiences as an Humboldt alumnus, STEM graduate, first-generation Native woman into a free-flowing, yet strategic style of support and guidance for each of the 25-30 mentors hired each year. She focuses on supporting, respectfully guiding and accompanying student leaders in their development as scholars and paraprofessionals. As a result, the spaces they share with peers across campus create interactions which support the students’ ongoing work towards successful navigation of the university. In addition, her insight and perspective into how RAMP can aspire to contribute to the university’s goals regarding our persistent equity gaps are crucial to the program.\n\nNora Montoya, Academic and Career Advising Center\n\nNora is dedicated to helping students achieve their academic, personal and professional goals. She is an attentive listener, caring and thoughtful career advisor. She is always willing to help with a project, brings thoughtful ideas, and is a great team player and collaborator.\n\nJaneth Serrano, Financial Aid\n\nJaneth is a role model of a high performing employee, working mother, community leader and mentor to many who are attracted to her servant leadership, passion and desire to make a lasting impact. She is a lovely person inside and out.\n\nLaura Sullivan, Student Medical Services\n\nThe SHC lab COULD NOT have stayed fully operational during the pandemic, and while short-staffed, without Laura's willingness and ability to rise to the occasion and provide the necessary leadership! Laura is a true asset to the Student Health Center, to campus, and to the student patients receiving care.\n\nNicki Viso,Title IX & Discrimination, Harassment, & Retaliation Prevention\n\nNicki's particular penchant for transparency, care, and collaboration is not only worth recognition, but also a key component of increased efforts to make Cal Poly Humboldt a more safe and aware place where current and potential students can gain access to affordable, high-quality education that is responsive to the needs of a fast-changing world.\n\nSusan Wright, Department of Biological Sciences\n\nWhat stands out about Susan, is the way that she does her job. Her tone and attitude toward the students, staff, faculty and the University itself is incredibly supportive, compassionate, and positive, while her work ethic is driven and conscientious. Susan Wright is an exceptional employee of Cal Poly Humboldt! Susan has shown dedication to the students and all their efforts. She has become an invaluable asset to the department and is involved with school administrative tasks. She has proved time and time again to be reliable, caring, and knowledgeable.\n\nTo honor our Award recipients, there will be a private luncheon hosted by President Jackson and Staff Council. More details about this private event will be communicated soon with our recipients!\n\nThank you to everyone who participated in this year’s Staff Recognition Awards process, including a very special thank you to the President’s Office staff, to each person who took time to nominate a staff member, and to our 2021/22 Staff Council members who conducted the review of all nominations. And a big shout out to our incredible Cal Poly Humboldt staff members who do outstanding work to support our campus community and continue to lift each other up each day. Thank you!"
