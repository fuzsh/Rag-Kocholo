        "text": "On February 2, 2023, Ilhan Omar took to the floor of the House of Representatives to address what being an American meant to her. Responding to Republican efforts to remove her from the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, the representative for Minnesota's fifth congressional district asked, “Who gets to be an American? What opinions do you have to have to be counted as American?”Footnote 1 In attacking Omar for her past comments on Israel and track record of criticizing U.S. foreign policy, House Republicans were conflating progressive politics with foreignness, arguing that this combination is subversive and represents a real threat to the American government and the stability of the nation.Footnote 2 Indeed, the vote to remove Omar came just a few years after President Donald J. Trump had implored Omar and her progressive allies in “The Squad”—House Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib—to “go back” to the “crime infested places from which they came.”Footnote 3 Acknowledging how her race and identity were once again being used by Republicans to question her Americanness and delegitimize her politics, Omar offered the following rebuttal:\n\nIlhan Omar is an example of a twenty-first-century progressive who strategically embraces the language of patriotism when critiquing American power—both at home and abroad. As such, she reminds us that patriotism and forms of internationalism are often intertwined. By proudly proclaiming her identity as an American, Omar was participating in a centuries-old debate over what kind of country America was, is, and should aspire to be.Footnote 5 Indeed, her insistence on the need to expand the contours of the nation represents a dissident form of Americanism—a deliberate effort to complicate universalizing national myths, to grapple with histories of racial violence and exclusion, and to demand a radical transformation of U.S. democracy.Footnote 6 None of this negates her desire to forge political solidarities across borders in the name of civil and human rights.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the actor, singer, and activist Paul Robeson was one of several radical Black activists also grappling with the limitations of the nation and the question of patriotism. Robeson's talent as a college football player, singer, and actor had—by the 1940s—made him one of the most instantly recognizable and celebrated Americans on the world stage.Footnote 7 However, as anticommunist fever took hold during the early years of the Cold War, his activism came to be seen as a dangerous by many in the United States.Footnote 8 Denounced as “un-American” by the American government and blacklisted in the entertainment industry, the politics of anticommunism threatened both Robeson's livelihood as well as his radical Black international vision that connected the struggle for racial and economic justice in the United States to anticolonial movements around the world. Fearful of being branded “subversive,” many Black leaders—from conservatives such as Manning Johnson and George Schuyler to former allies including National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Executive Secretary Walter White—argued that Robeson had lost his way and was out of touch with ordinary African Americans.Footnote 9 Some white politicians and reactionary voices in the media went further, insisting that if he did not like it in America he should “go back to Russia,” impugning him in ways that made him a target of white supremacist violence.Footnote 10 Like Omar, Robeson's progressive politics were denounced as foreign, disloyal, and incongruous with the American way of life.\n\nIn many ways, Paul Robeson was the dictionary definition of a “citizen of the world.”Footnote 11 His travels, performances, and political associations all point to the impossibility of reading his life and Black politics solely through the lens of the nation-state. Nevertheless, his activism—like Omar's in the twenty-first century—was intimately grounded in his relationship with the United States and his precarious status as an American citizen. Furthermore, he repeatedly framed himself as a patriotic and loyal American. We need to take Robeson's patriotic declarations seriously. Not least because they tell us something about the way in which Black radicals responded to the repressive politics of McCarthyism that denounced them as foreign and disloyal. But also, and perhaps most significantly, we must take his declarations seriously because these pronouncements have important implications for the study of Black international activism. This vibrant body of scholarship rightly demands that we grapple with Black history's global vision and move beyond national frameworks.Footnote 12 However, it is important to note how even the most expansive forms of Black internationalism are rooted in specific national circumstances.Footnote 13 Black international politics do not always represent an escape from, or an outright rejection of, the nation. Instead, this mode of political engagement often demands a fundamental reckoning with the politics of nationalism and the nation in order to challenge global inequalities."
