        "text": "It’s a little windy this Friday night outside the oldest private residence in Raleigh, North Carolina: Haywood House. The weather started out warm, close to 70 degrees at midday, but now it’s 7 p.m. Guests are arriving, bearing food and smiles, and the temperature has dropped quickly.\n\nHaywood House sits at a busy intersection in downtown Raleigh, and, echoing most of the surviving older buildings, it’s surrounded by parking lots and government buildings. Directly across is the North Carolina State Bar; a block east is the Capitol building. Visible from the Haywood House’s front door is a large, long stone church that’s also an Episcopal preschool, and some studio apartments.\n\nMost of the new arrivals hurry inside, stopping briefly to knock at the outsized double doors that lead from a Doric-columned porch to the foyer and staircase inside. A few stop short of the double-doors to take photos, sitting on a small bench on the porch, lit with a strobe light. The traffic on South Blount Street is busy tonight; another of Raleigh’s many downtown events is starting up a few blocks south, and cars rush by.\n\nThe first to sit is Emerson Foster. His ancestors were slaves owned by the Hawkins family back in the 1800s. He’s here to gather more information about where enslaved people are buried in nearby Warren County; these are often areas found near their enslaver’s family cemeteries, marked solely by fieldstones at the boundaries. His most recent find was at the gravesite of John Hall, one of the first three judges of the North Carolina Supreme Court. Oddly, one of Emerson’s ancestors, a slave woman named Hannah, was buried in the Hall cemetery. Foster wonders if that signifies a deeper relationship.\n\nEugenia Ijames, a schoolteacher from Johnston County, sits and remarks quietly that “this house is filled with history, and the people are filled with wonderful stories. I hope to be able to take some of the stories back to my students.”\n\nEarl Ijames, her husband, is next; he’s a farmer and historian, and quick to point out his bonafides: seventh-generation North Carolinian, and the curator of African American History and Agriculture at the North Carolina Museum of History. He talks about the history of the Haywood House, and its current owner, Betsy Haywood:\n\n“I’ve known Betsy Haywood probably 25 years at least,” he says. “Her mother, I knew even better. Her mother’s the one who used to originally invite me over to Haywood Hall (a nearby, even older Haywood family residence that the family no longer owns) for Christmas parties and all the gatherings like this.”\n\nEarl has brought a palm tree native to North Carolina, called the Carolina palmetto or cabbage palm, for Betsy’s gathering. Sabal palmetto is a hardy survivor, one that tolerates droughts as well as cold and heat, and he’d like to plant it in the nascent garden here at the house.\n\nThe guests tonight are descendants of slave owners, former slaves, or are the offspring of mixed race marriages, all of them breaking bread together and trading histories—sharing stories.\n\nSomething like 90 percent of the dinner guests tonight are related. As Samuel Alston, another attendee, puts it: “Once you start doing the research, it really gets to be interesting. Guess what? We’re all cousins.”\n\nAnd Betsy Haywood, current owner and resident of Haywood House? This dinner is one stop on her odyssey—a journey through her family history, a desire to face the past and reckon with all that it has wrought. But that’s a maudlin way to describe her motivations. This is more than reckoning with the past. There is more to Betsy than that; she moves forward with a desire to connect and change the dynamic of the relationship she has with the group she’s eating with tonight. She refers to Emerson Foster, whose ancestor Hannah was buried in the family cemetery of North Carolina Supreme Court Justice John Hall, as “Cousin Emerson.”\n\nLately, she’s been attempting to figure out who shares her ancestry, and since 2015 has been reaching out to people white and Black who share her last name (Haywood was the surname given to all the slaves who worked on her family’s land.). Her search also extends to the Hawkins surname (Richard Haywood, the original owner of the house, was the grandson of Philemon Hawkins III, a plantation owner in Warren County). Family myth has long held that Philemon Hawkins was descended from the slave trader Sir John Hawkins. So far, Betsy has been unable to prove a DNA connection with John Hawkins.\n\nSir John was one of the first purveyors of the “Triangle Trade”—a term that signified trading goods for enslaved people in Africa, then selling those people in the Americas for money and goods to be brought back to England. A bloody geographic triangle of people-as-product, the term dissociates the very real human cost and hardship of lives uprooted and families upended.\n\nBut Betsy has unearthed a lot of tangible, invaluable information to share with the world: the records of her own Haywood family’s slave holdings.\n\nShe began by inviting descendants of the Haywoods and Hawkins families to dine together at her home and explore the history, and the archives, inside. She calls these dinners “Hanging With the Hawkins & Haywoods.”\n\nShe describes a dinner six months ago when a retired Black attorney from Ohio named Gary Franklin, who was researching his family’s ancestry, made a long-lost connection by looking through the Haywood family slave records:\n\n“We were over at one end of the dining room, and everybody else is having a drink and talking at the other end,” Betsy says. “He looks at it (the registry) and he goes, ‘Oh my gosh, that is my great-great-grandmother's entire family, Matilda and her children.’ I still get chill bumps talking about it. And I just stood there, and tears started trickling out of my eyes and out of Gary's eyes. I said, ‘I'm a little embarrassed, and I just feel awkward.’ And he said, ‘I'm not. This is the best moment of my life. I have found my whole family.’\n\n“That was my favorite evening.... He found one branch of his enslaved Curtis family in our family slave records.”\n\nThere are a lot of distant cousins here tonight.\n\nEarlier in their relationship, Betsy found a match between her and Emerson, who is Black, but related to the Hawkins family. And today, Betsy and Emerson both call each other \"cousin.\"\n\n“Everyone in here, we represent just about every family that ever lived in Warren County, North Carolina,” Emerson chimes in.\n\nAfter dinner, they begin an elaborate show and tell in the large drawing room, with its plentiful seating. Everyone tucks in to generous servings of strawberry shortcake, and Emerson fires up his phone camera for another stream. Betsy begins again: “Eleanor Hawkins Haywood (1776-1858) was my great-great-grandmother, and her portrait is in the library.” Betsy gestures to her left to the family library, which is across a long hallway and out of sight (how many people alive can encompass almost 200 years in a lazy sweep of an arm?) and then passes around photocopied silhouettes of Eleanor and her brother, John D. Hawkins.\n\nShe mentions details from a letter written to accompany the silhouettes, adding in a few details about those days, including a reference to “that long, long pipe” that ladies used to smoke with “to keep from staining their lips,” and slowly the history of this widespread and far-reaching family home comes to life.\n\nSlavery is mentioned often, never avoided or stepped around or over. Even in the description of the silhouette, Betsy reads an accompanying note that had been passed down with the silhouette: “When she would find that her pipe had gone out, she would call Polly; Polly was nowhere near, and she would say, ‘Drat that girl.’” The Polly mentioned in that note was a young enslaved girl in the home.\n\nOffhandedly, Betsy mentions that a miniature of Colonel Philemon Hawkins III, who was born in 1752 at Pleasant Hill Plantation in Warren County, is in the house library, and gives another 250-year-encompassing wave toward that area of the house.\n\nFollowing that remark down a rabbit hole reveals that Philemon Hawkins Jr. and Lucy Davis Hawkins had 13 children. From there, following just the daughters from that coupling—and the colonels and governors and businessmen that they married or sired—is a dizzying experience.\n\nOne out of many of the notable daughters, Sarah Hawkins, who married Colonel William Polk, has been credited with coming up with the idea for the Raleigh Experimental Railroad, which carried stone for the building of a new State Capitol Building, completed in 1840, in wooden carts drawn by horses by rails.\n\nSince then, she’s been mostly alone in her battles. And Wake County property taxes for downtown property remains high. She’s skeptical about its future:\n\n“The city has not expressed any interest,” she says. “I don't think that the city is very interested at all in historic preservation. The city of Raleigh could not possibly care less, as far as I'm concerned.”\n\nIn the 1970s, Betsy’s mother, Margaret “Margie” Haywood, fought to secure historic property status for the Haywood House. But she ran into a state government plan to either tear down many historic homes along Blount Street to make way for parking for workers in the nearby State Government Complex. Later, in 1986, the state proposed to move Haywood House house and rebuild it on another lot. But Margie Haywood would have none of it. And her opinion mattered, because she chaired the state’s Historic Properties Commission.\n\nBetsy has just shared a story about an ancestor of hers she discovered in Franklin County, Florine Green. Florine was black, and a DNA match with Betsy; both are descendents of Philemon and Delia Hawkins.\n\nFlorine’s aunts were light-skinned—so light they could pass for white. One of her aunts was an accomplished seamstress, and sewed for Doris Duke, a family whose vast fortune was made in the tobacco fields of North Carolina. She married a white man, and lived as white for years. She was outed as black by a jealous cousin who moved to New York, and subsequently was kicked out of her own home. Betsy ends her story by asking, “Was there this compulsion to act white, look white, be white?” Earl Ijames responds quickly: “if you could pass,” and others in the room nod and repeat the words.\n\nRichard Hunter recalls his own story of blurred genealogies, citing another family, the Christmases. William Christmas was the surveyor who laid out the town of Raleigh in 1792, carved out of a thousand acres from the Joel Lane Plantation.\n\n“I had a phone call at the office one day,” Richard begins. On the phone was a man who was researching the Christmas family.\n\n“I said, ‘Well, there are two Christmas families. The white Christmases and the black Christmases.’ He laughed, and said, ‘Well, they’re white now, but they used to be black!’”\n\nManning Marable and Leith Mullings write about the loss, and writing-over, of African history and culture, in their introduction to their anthology of black writers, Let Nobody Turn Us Around:\n\nThose captured from Africa were not people without history and culture. They were mothers and fathers, sons and daughters…. (They) created themselves, but not just as they pleased, not under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past.\n\nMarable and Mullings are right, of course, but there’s even more to it. Black people in the South, in North Carolina, did have to create themselves, and they did it in so many ways, not only as slave labor. They were slaves, they were free people, and even, rarely in this state, manumitted people. They were parts of mixed-marriage couples (sometimes hidden as slave/master relationships) and illegitimate offspring. And in the process, they not only created themselves; they created North Carolina, and the country. They are as much a part of the history here as their more well-known white counterparts.\n\nLook at Charlotte Hawkins Brown, a great-granddaughter of John D. Hawkins, and founder of the Palmer Memorial Institute in 1902, which began as a boarding school for African-American children, run out of a small blacksmith’s cabin, and grew into a fully accredited, nationally recognized prep school, before its closure after a fire gutted the school's administration and classroom building in 1971.\n\nBrown also helped to convince Guilford County to open the county's first public rural school for black students. An educator, speaker and leader, she became known as the \"first lady of social graces\" after her national radio appearances, and her book The Correct Thing to Do, to Say, to Wear was published in 1940.\n\nAnd the Haywood House itself—a sagging but still standing piece of North Carolina history, sitting among parking lots and government buildings, slowly sinking in the rising tide of Wake County property taxes? As Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote in his novel about a similarly sprawling and influential family, the Buendías:\n\n“Things have a life of their own. It’s simply a matter of waking up their souls.”"
