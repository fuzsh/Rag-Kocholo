        "text": "Villas\n\nWelcome to Your Pacific Adventure!\n\nZona Dorada | Bucerias (near Puerto Vallarta) | Pacific Coast of Mexico\n\nAventura Pacifico Suites & Villas\n\nTake a 3D tour NOW of our:\n\nSuites\n\nAventuraPacifico.com is dedicated to helping you enjoy a wonderfully relaxing stay in Bucerias (“Place of the Divers”), in the heart of tropical Pacific Mexico. We provide casual, comfortable accommodations in a charming, authentically Mexican setting, just two short blocks from the best beach on the entire Bay of Banderas. Those who prefer to avoid big package-tour resorts and cookie-cutter chain hotels, but don’t like to spend a fortune on luxury character lodging, rejoice! This serene, sun-drenched and superbly located property consists of just seven self-contained convenience suites featuring a shared rooftop deck with panoramic views of the ocean, a lovely outdoor swimming pool and patio area, and a superb stretch of golden beach only a couple of minutes walk from your door. This is simply one of the most perfect spots in all of Mexico for relaxing, lounging in the sun, swimming and all other types of water-sports, including boogie boarding, body surfing, sailing, sea-kayaking and deep-sea fishing (as well as kite surfing, and parasailing for the more adventurous.) If your preference is to simply relax during your stay, sit up on the rooftop terrace and drink in the spectacular Pacific sunsets, or lounge by the pool and read, or even check your email and make no-charge VoIP calls to the US and Canada on our free wifi network. The safe and friendly town of Bucerias is lovely for local walks, and the heart of vibrant Puerto Vallarta is just half-an-hour away. Many compelling adventures beckon in the area, from whale-watching to zip-lining, to nights on the town featuring culinary delights, classical and contemporary concerts by the sea, and salsa dancing to the wonderful live music that the area is building a burgeoning reputation for. We look forward to helping you discover this slice of paradise by the sea on your very own Aventura Pacifico (Pacific Adventure) in tropical Mexico. Hasta Pronto!
