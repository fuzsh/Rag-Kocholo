        "text": "RESULTS\n\nForty-five studies, published between 2000 and 2019, were included in this review.17,36,40,41,47,48,52,54–57,61,63,69,70,72–101 Thirteen (28.9%) of the 45 studies comprised samples of patients with psychiatric conditions other than BPD,40,41,52,55,72,74,77,81,82,87,91,97,100 including other personality disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, substance abuse disorder, and anorexia nervosa (Tables – and – ). All but two studies47,82 reported sex distributions for patients with the diagnosis of BDP. The female-to-male ratio of patients included in studies reporting sex distribution was 8:1.\n\nInterpersonal Reactivity Index\n\nEleven (24.4%) of the 45 studies included in this review used the IRI as a measure of empathy (Table ).17,54,55,61,72,76,79,83–86\n\nInterpersonal Reactivity Index cognitive subscales\n\nSeven studies using the perspective-taking subscale of the IRI found a significant reduction of the corresponding scores in patients with BPD relative to healthy control subjects.55,61,76,83–86 Three studies did not find significant differences of PT scores between groups.54,72,79\n\nNo study found a significant difference of fantasy scores between patients with BPD and healthy control subjects.54,61,72,76,79,83–86\n\nHarari and colleagues17 and Martin and colleagues86 calculated the sum of scores from both cognitive subscales of the IRI (i.e., the PT + FS score). Both studies revealed an overall deficit of cognitive empathy in patients with BPD.17,86\n\nInterpersonal Reactivity Index emotional subscales\n\nEight studies using the personal-distress subscale of the IRI found enhanced distress in patients with BPD.54,61,72,76,79,83,84,86 One study did not find a significant difference of PD scores between patients and controls.85\n\nTwo studies reported impaired,55,85 and one study reported enhanced, empathic concern in patients with BPD,72 but the vast majority of studies did not find significant differences of EC scores between patients and controls.54,61,76,79,83,84,86\n\nIn parallel with their calculations regarding the cognitive subscales, Harari and colleagues17 and Martin and colleagues86 also calculated the sum of scores from both emotional subscales of the IRI (i.e., the EC + PD score). Martin and colleagues86 reported enhanced emotional empathy in patients, whereas Harari and colleagues17 did not.\n\nHappé’s Advanced ToM Test\n\nTwo (4.4%) of the 45 studies included in this review used Happé’s advanced ToM test (Table ).40,41 None of them found a significant difference between patients with BPD and healthy control subjects in terms of ToM capacities as assessed by this test.40,41\n\nFaux Pas Detection Test\n\nSix (13.3%) of the 45 studies included in this review used the Faux Pas detection test as a measure of ToM capacities (Table ).17,41,61,78,88,94 Five of these studies found significant deficits of ToM in patients with BPD.17,61,78,88,94 One study did not find a significant difference between patients and controls in recognizing faux pas.41\n\nTwo of these six studies independently analyzed the cognitive and affective domains of ToM.17,78 Both studies found deficits of cognitive ToM in patients with BPD. Baez and colleagues78 also found deficits of affective ToM in patients, whereas Harari and colleagues17 did not.\n\nReading the Mind in the Eyes Test\n\nThirteen (28.9%) of the 45 studies included in this review used the RMET to assess ToM capacities (Table ).36,47,48,61,73,78,80,88,89,91,98,99,101\n\nFour studies reported lower,80,89,98,101 and three studies reported higher,48,73,88 RMET total scores in patients with BPD relative to healthy control subjects, but six studies did not find a significant difference between patients and controls in the RMET total score.36,47,61,78,91,99 Schilling and colleagues47 reported a pattern of high confidence ratings for correct and incorrect answers in patients.\n\nNine studies assessed emotional valences on the RMET.47,48,61,73,80,88,89,91,98 Table presents detailed information regarding the diversity of results from these studies.\n\nEmpathy Quotient\n\nTwo (4.4%) of the 45 studies included in this review used the EQ as a measure of empathy (Table ).79,96 Both studies found reduced EQ scores in patients with BPD relative to healthy control subjects.79,96\n\nMovie for the Assessment of Social Cognition\n\nSeven (15.6%) of the 45 studies included in this review used the MASC as a measure of ToM or mentalizing and social cognition (Table ).36,52,55,56,81,97,99\n\nTwo studies found reduced MASC scores in patients with BPD relative to healthy control subjects.36,55 In particular, they found an average reduction of 4.6 points in the MASC total score, as well as an average reduction of 1.7 points in the score specifically measuring items “challenging the interpretation of intentions” in patients with BPD.36,55 With respect to items “challenging the interpretations of emotions” and regarding the capacity to “measure thoughts,” Preißler and colleagues36 found lower scores in patients with BPD relative to controls, whereas Ritter and colleagues55 did not find a significant difference between groups.\n\nAlthough four studies did not find significant differences of MASC scores between patients with BPD and healthy control subjects,56,81,97,99 three studies revealed an increase of overmentalizing errors in patients.52,81,97 In addition, one study revealed “overconfidence in errors” as the major abnormality in BPD.52\n\nMultifaceted Empathy Test\n\nFour (8.9%) of the 45 studies included in this review used the MET as a measure of empathy (Table ).54–57\n\nOn the MET cognitive subscale, Dziobek and colleagues54 found deficits of cognitive empathy in women with BPD, but no other study found a significant difference between patients with BPD and healthy control subjects on this subscale.55–57\n\nOn the MET emotional subscale, two studies found deficits of emotional empathy in patients with BPD.54,55 Specifically, these studies found an average reduction of 0.9 points in the “emphatic concern” subscale score of patients with BPD relative to healthy control subjects.54,55 One of these studies also found impaired “emotional contagion” in patients.55\n\nTwo studies by Wingenfeld and colleagues56,57 did not find significant differences of emotional empathy between women with BPD under usual conditions and healthy control women, but one of these studies reported deficits of emotional empathy in women with BPD under stress.57\n\nReflective Functioning Questionnaire\n\nThree (6.7%) of the 45 studies included in this review used the RFQ as a measure of mentalizing (Table ).87,90,93\n\nPerroud and colleagues87 found higher RFQ_U and lower RFQ_C scores in patients with BPD relative to healthy control subjects. Likewise, Badoud and colleagues90 calculated the RFQ total score by subtracting the RFQ_C score from the RFQ_U score. The result was a negative value for the subtraction (−4.4) in patients with BPD, and a positive value (+7.5) in healthy controls.90\n\nThe main purpose of a study by Morandotti and colleagues93 was to differentiate patients with BPD from healthy subjects by using receiver operating characteristic curves. Their study found that the RFQ_U score was particularly useful for such a differentiation and also for predicting BPD severity.93\n\nMayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test\n\nSix (13.3%) of the 45 studies included in this review used the MSCEIT as a measure of emotional intelligence (Table ).74,75,77,82,96,100 Four of these studies found deficits of emotional intelligence in patients with BPD.74,77,82,100 Two studies did not find significant differences of emotional intelligence between patients and controls.75,96\n\nOther Measures\n\nTable summarizes results of the eight studies (17.8%) using other measures of empathy and related processes.\n\nThe Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy revealed decreased cognitive empathy, but similar levels of emotional empathy, in patients with BPD relative to healthy control subjects.92 Curiously, in women with BPD, Niedtfeld70 found enhanced emotional contagion secondary to nonverbally expressed emotions (i.e., ones just conveyed by emotionally charged facial expressions and prosody, but not by speech content) and lack of emotional empathy when both speech content and nonverbally expressed emotions were presented.70\n\nThe Joke-Appreciation and the Nonverbal ToM tasks revealed deficits of ToM in patients with BPD.41,61 Colle and colleagues95 also reported ToM deficits using the Theory of Mind Assessment Scale and found them to be more pronounced when mindreading tasks of patients required them to undertake an “allocentric” perspective—that is, the perspective of another individual. Likewise, the Mentalization Questionnaire and the Mentalization Scale revealed deficits of mentalizing abilities in BPD.69,89\n\nThe False-Belief Picture Sequencing Task and the Mental State Attribution Tasks did not reveal significant differences between patients with BPD and healthy control subjects in terms of ToM.61,63 Ghiassi and colleagues63 reported, however, that parental care during childhood influenced ToM capacities of patients with BPD as assessed by the MSAT; maternal rejection and punishment, taken together, were found to be a significant predictor of poor mentalizing in BPD.63\n\nSummary of Results Across Studies\n\nThirty-six studies included in this review reported deficits of empathy (i.e., cognitive or emotional), ToM, mentalizing, social cognition, or emotional intelligence in patients with BPD.17,36,41,47,52,54,55,57,61,69,70,74,76–90,92–98,100,101\n\nEight studies reported enhanced emotional empathy in patients with BPD, mostly because of an increase in the PD subscale scores of the IRI.54,61,72,76,79,83,84,86 Curiously, three studies using the RMET also revealed enhanced ToM capacities in patients with BPD.48,73,88\n\nContradictory results between distinct tests for assessing empathy and related processes were reported in three studies.54,79,88 The study by Dziobek and colleagues54 showed deficits of both cognitive and emotional empathy on the MET but revealed enhanced emotional empathy on the basis of the PD subscale of the IRI. Matzke and colleagues79 reported deficits of empathy on the basis of the EQ but found enhanced emotional empathy on the basis of the PD subscale of the IRI. Finally, Zabihzadeh and colleagues88 found lack of ToM capacities in patients with BPD based on the Faux Pas detection test but found enhanced ToM capacities on the RMET.\n\nSix studies showed no significant differences of empathy or related processes between patients with BPD and healthy control subjects.40,56,63,75,91,99 With respect to the tests employed in these studies, Arntz and colleagues40 used Happé’s advanced ToM test; Beblo and colleagues,75 the MSCEIT; Ghiassi and colleagues,63 the MSAT; Wingenfeld and colleagues,56 the MASC and the MET; Berenson and colleagues,91 the RMET; and Duque-Alarcón and colleagues,99 the RMET and the MASC.\n\nComorbidities\n\nEight (17.8%) of the 45 studies included in this review analyzed the possible effect of comorbid psychiatric conditions on dysfunction of empathy and related processes in BPD.36,73,80,87,88,91,94,96\n\nPreißler and colleagues36 reported significantly lower MASC scores for items to “measure thoughts” in patients with BPD and comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) relative to patients without comorbid PTSD. In addition, this study found the following two significant predictors of poor social cognition: intrusive symptoms (a core feature of PTSD) and history of sexual trauma.36\n\nUnoka and colleagues80 reported higher RMET total, neutral valence, and negative valence scores in patients with BPD and major depressive episode relative to patients without this comorbidity. Zabihzadeh and colleagues88 also reported higher RMET total and negative valence, but lower positive valence, scores in patients with BPD and comorbid MDD relative to patients without comorbid MDD. By using the Faux Pas detection test, this study found reduced ToM capacities in patients with BPD and comorbid MDD relative to patients without comorbid MDD.88\n\nFinally, Perroud and colleagues87 found higher RFQ_U scores in patients with BPD and comorbid ADHD relative to patients without comorbid ADHD. No further significant contribution of comorbidities for the pattern of empathic dysfunction in BPD was reported.\n\nNeuroimaging\n\nTwo (4.4%) of the 45 studies included in this review assessed empathy or related processes in the setting of blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) fMRI.48,54\n\nUsing an adaptation of the MET for fMRI, Dziobek and colleagues54 found that patients with BPD showed less activation of the left superior temporal gyrus in a condition challenging cognitive empathy but found higher activation of the right insular cortex in a condition challenging emotional empathy.\n\nUsing the implementation of the RMET for fMRI, Frick and colleagues48 found activation of multiple brain regions both in patients with BPD and healthy control subjects. The authors highlighted a pattern of enhanced activation of the right amygdala during positive emotional valence stimuli and a pattern of enhanced activation of the left amygdala during negative emotional valence stimuli in patients with BPD.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nEighty percent of the studies included in this review reported deficits of empathy or related processes in patients with BPD.17,36,41,47,52,54,55,57,61,69,70,74,76–90,92–98,100,101 Moreover, enhanced emotional empathy in BPD was reported in eight studies, all of which revealed that patients had increased scores of distress on the IRI self-report questionnaire.54,61,72,76,79,83,84,86 Several studies found no significant differences between patients with BPD and healthy control subjects in terms of empathy or related processes,40,56,63,75,91,99 and some even found contradictory results between distinct tests.54,79,88 No study reported enhanced cognitive empathy, social cognition, or emotional intelligence in patients with BPD.\n\nClinical heterogeneity (i.e., differences in characteristics of patients) across samples partly explains the diversity of results reported by studies included in this review. Specifically, demographic factors (age, sex, and education), the severity of BPD symptoms, history of traumatic events, history of suicidal attempts, features leading to hospitalization, concurrent medication, and psychiatric comorbidities might have influenced the reported results. A key example here is the influence of childhood trauma and comorbid PTSD on the development of empathic dysfunction in BPD,36,102 which leads to a practical inability in determining where the aberrations in empathy and related processes originated. Statistical variance due to small sample sizes might also have contributed to the diversity of results.\n\nThe measures used to assess empathy and related processes can also explain part of the results, and some tests might even be unable to detect abnormalities. An example is perhaps the RMET,44 which—despite being the most frequently used test in studies included in this review36,47,48,61,73,78,80,88,89,91,98,99,101—was the test that most often did not detect differences between patients and controls,36,61,78,91,99 and the only one revealing enhanced ToM capacities in patients with BPD.48,73,88 Maybe the absence of stimuli resembling realistic social interactions on the RMET can explain the presumably inaccurate results.\n\nThe absence of realistic social interactions is also a common feature of performance-based tests using cartoons or illustrations to present stimuli, such as Happé’s advanced ToM test, the False-Belief Picture Sequencing Task, and the MSAT. None of these tests revealed significant differences between patients with BPD and healthy subjects in terms of ToM.\n\nIn addition, results based on the IRI, EQ, RFQ, and other self-report measures should be interpreted with caution because these tests are dependent on the participants’ ability to understand percepts, perspectives, and emotions—an ability potentially lacking in patients with mental disorders.\n\nAlternatively, some of the applied measures might have disproportionately weighted different dimensions of empathy and related processes in patients with BPD. This can lead to somewhat discrepant results, such as those reported by Dziobek and colleagues,54 in which a decrease of cognitive and emotional empathy was shown using the MET, whereas enhanced emotional empathy was revealed using the PD subscale of the IRI. It is conceivable that the reason for such a discrepancy might be the absence of a specific measure of distress on the MET.\n\nLack of cognitive empathy, ToM, mentalizing, social cognition, or emotional intelligence was found to be a common feature among patients with BPD. This can explain a failure in their process of repairing disrupted social cooperation, which is a finding supported by neuroimaging data in the setting of an economic exchange game with healthy partners.103\n\nThe possible concomitance of reduced emotional empathy further diminishes the ability of patients with BPD to sustain social cooperation, but a most intriguing finding is the possible occurrence of the empathic paradox, or borderline empathy paradox, in these patients.31,32 This is a form of enhanced emotional empathy enabling access to the emotions of others, which are possibly misinterpreted in the setting of interpersonal relationships. Put simply, it is possible that some patients with BPD may perceive and respond to subtle emotional cues that healthy subjects might otherwise ignore for the sake of socialization. The occurrence of this borderline empathy paradox has been related to a previous history of abuse during childhood, and is consistent with results of selected studies indicating enhanced emotional empathy and ToM.48,54,61,72,73,76,79,83,84,86,88 Along these lines, a proposed model explains the borderline empathy paradox resulting from a combination of increased attention to social stimuli and dysfunctional processing of social information,31 but the model needs to be confirmed. In addition, it is uncertain how patients with BPD interpret basic social information, and how well they use it to support interpersonal relationships.104\n\nWe did not include results of studies based on emotion-recognition tasks. Although this exclusion may be regarded as a limitation of the current review, it was intended to avoid possible confounds. As mentioned in the introduction, we consider emotion recognition as a prerequisite for empathy, but the possible occurrence of preserved or even enhanced emotion-recognition abilities is not necessarily a synonym of preserved empathy. In other words, although empathy and related processes are dependent on emotion recognition, an individual can be able to recognize emotions without being empathetic at all. We also did not include results of studies using unpublished105,106 or not generalizable assessment measures of empathy-related processes,107 and we did not include results of studies using other than “traditional ToM tasks.”108\n\nPrevious reviews have focused on dysfunction of empathy and related processes in patients with BPD.26,31,102,104,109–116 The major advantage of the present review relative to former ones is the inclusion of a larger number of studies assessing a wider range of psychological processes, using tools that help to explain the abnormal social functioning in patients with BPD. Furthermore, we separately reported the possible role of comorbidities and also considered findings of neuroimaging studies. Most previous reviews were either nonsystematic26,102,104,109,110,112 or had a different scope in terms of the addressed psychological processes.111,113–116 In particular, a substantial number of those reviews included studies on emotion recognition,31,104,112,116 and some were also devoted to psychiatric conditions other than BPD.111,114,116\n\nThe heterogeneity of samples and assessment measures, the different implementations of the latter, and the discrepancies among concepts underlying the addressed psychological processes correspond to limitations of this review, leading to a practical inability to calculate valid effect sizes or to take a meta-analytic approach. A possible strategy to deal with this particular limitation in the future could be to develop and implement research domain criteria117 as well as to use accurate, more homogeneous, and valid neuropsychological tools to assess empathic dysfunction in BPD.\n\nAccordingly, no cutoffs to establish impaired empathic capacities in patients with BPD have been previously established in the literature, apart from a value of 4.5 reported by Morandotti and colleagues93 for the RFQ_U. It is relevant to point out that cutoff values have been previously proposed for tests applied to healthy subjects or in the setting of psychiatric conditions other than BPD. For instance, a cutoff of 30 has been proposed for the EQ in a study involving patients with Asperger’s syndrome or high-functioning autism.49 The current absence of cutoffs for the vast majority of tests assessing empathy or related processes represents a limitation in conveying validated information regarding salient differences between patients with BPD and healthy control subjects. Future original research studies aimed at resolving this issue are warranted.\n\nAnother limitation was the scarce number of neuroimaging studies using valid assessment measures and conditions designed to test empathy and related processes in BPD. Most probably, the results of these studies are not generalizable and did not specifically confirm the involvement of brain regions considered as part of the mirror neuron system in the process of empathic dysfunction. Curiously, one study not fulfilling inclusion criteria for this review revealed decreased activation in brain regions belonging to that system, as well as increased activation of the amygdala.118\n\nAlso of note is that published functional neuroimaging studies in BPD have been diverse in terms of their designs, paradigms, and conditions, with results that still need to be integrated into a single, coherent picture. For instance, studies not included in this review found increased activation of the following regions of the brain in BPD: frontal pole, medial prefrontal, frontal, anterior cingulate, and temporal-parietal cortices, as well as the precuneus and the superior and middle temporal gyri.85,119,120 Similarly, resting-state BOLD fMRI studies mostly reported decreased functional connectivity among several brain regions in patients with BPD.121,122\n\nStructural neuroimaging studies have also been carried out in the setting of BPD. A widespread reduction of gray matter volume was demonstrated by using segmentation-based methods—including voxel-based morphometry and algorithms combining either analyses of cortical surface and sulci,123,124 or assessments of cortical thickness and source-based morphometry.125,126 Regional abnormalities (e.g., in the limbic system) were also reported.127,128 One study using diffusion tensor imaging revealed reduced fractional anisotropy of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in adolescents, but not in adult patients, with BPD.129\n\nNovel work is needed to clarify the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of empathy and related processes in patients with BPD via neuroimaging studies mapping psychopathology in combination with reliable neuropsychological assessment measures. Furthermore, it will be relevant to explore novel strategies to study neural substrates of social interaction in BPD. A key example here is hyperscanning—the use of simultaneous behavioral experiments in which participants can interact with each other while fMRI data are synchronously acquired from different scanners. With hyperscanning, a given pattern of brain activity can be consistently compared with the corresponding pattern of another brain.130 This sort of strategy would be especially well suited to evaluate trust and sensitivity to rejection in patients with BPD, given that lack of trust and an increased or inappropriate (i.e., maladaptive) rejection sensitivity occur in these patients, and might contribute to their pattern of abnormal social functioning.131,132 Furthermore, hyperscanning could be used to test the sense of belonging, acceptance, or inclusion of patients with BPD to specific social contexts.132 Another strategy that could provide similar advances is the “second-person neuroscientific approach” to study social interaction. In simple terms, second-person neuroscience refers to studies in which there are real-time interactions, as opposed to simply observational contexts (sometimes referred to as third-person neuroscience).133\n\nFurther proposed dimensions of empathy, such as the prosocial concern,134 and novel psychophysiological assessment measures, such as ecological momentary assessment,135,136 should also be brought to the fore to evaluate patients with BPD. Prosocial concern, as proposed by Zaki and Oshner,134 refers to an additional dimension to the concept of empathy, apart from “experience sharing” (largely related to emotional empathy) and “mentalizing” (largely related to cognitive empathy and ToM). By taking prosocial concern or motivation into account, it would be possible to assess how well an individual can help another on the basis of his own resources or both of theirs. Ecological momentary assessment involves a series of repeated measures of behaviors or physiological processes from participants engaging in real-life activities.135,136\n\nIn summary, a common finding in patients with BPD is dysfunction of empathy and related processes. This seems to contribute to their symptoms because a lack of cognitive or emotional empathy, ToM, mentalizing, social cognition, or emotional intelligence serves to preempt sustained social cooperation or to prevent its repair after disruption. In addition, enhanced emotional empathy or an excessive and inappropriate awareness of patients to emotions of others may occur. The authors postulate that such an inappropriate awareness might lead to emotional instability and intense personal (and interpersonal) distress, in keeping with results of numerous studies revealing increased scores in the personal distress subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. This conclusion further helps to explain the unstable interpersonal relationships of patients with borderline personality disorder."
