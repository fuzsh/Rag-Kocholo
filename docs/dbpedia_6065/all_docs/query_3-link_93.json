        "text": "Warning: This article contains many spoilers for all seasons of 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.'\n\nAs someone with 20 years of anxiety and depression under my belt, I’m always interested in TV shows featuring characters with mental illness. More often than not, they leave me cold. (Or pissed off, or frustrated, or bored, or all of the above.)\n\nFor instance, Pretty Little Liars missed the mark completely by portraying every character with mental health issues as evil. Don’t even get me started on Scandal’s Olivia Pope, whose undiagnosed PTSD turns her into a murderer. Mr. Robot, Sherlock, and Breaking Bad all perpetuated the \"mad genius\" stereotype. And then there are the characters whose mental health provides a convenient excuse for their shitty behavior, like Mad Men’s Don Draper and UnREAL’s Rachel Goldberg.\n\nSo when Crazy Ex-Girlfriend came along, I had pretty low expectations. And then I was blown away.\n\nThe protagonist, Rebecca Bunch (played by the show’s co-creator and writer Rachel Bloom), isn’t a victim or a villain. She’s complex. She’s normal. As are all of us with mental health issues.\n\nFYI, if you’ve just discovered the show on Netflix, don’t be fooled by the rainbow-bright, exaggerated musical numbers, or the focus of early episodes: Rebecca’s over-the-top obsession with her ex. Gradually, we discover that something deeper and much more radical is at the core of the show—Rebecca’s depression, anxiety, OCD, and fixation. And, in the sixth episode of the third season, we finally get the professional diagnosis we’ve been patiently waiting for: borderline personality disorder (BPD).\n\n“I like how the show illustrates the complexity of people,\" Hilary Jacobs Hendel, licensed psychotherapist and author of It’s Not Always Depression, tells SELF. \"Each character has their own flaws and struggles combined with very wonderful aspects. This reflects humanity.\"\n\nIndeed, having a mental illness doesn't mean you can't function in society or that your entire identity is dominated by your illness. \"Rebecca, for example, is intelligent and performs well in school, gets along with her colleagues, and dresses appropriately for work,\" Hendel explains. \"Her symptoms get triggered by intimacy in relationships because intimate relationships in her childhood led to pain, loss, fear, shame, and anxiety.\"\n\nWhen Rebecca isn't triggered, she does well—she's able to go to work and have friendships. But when she's dealing with a lot of anxiety, those relationships can suffer, Hendel says.\n\nIt's at those points when another of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend's major strengths comes through: compassion. “The majority of shows and movies that deal with themes of mental illness usually portray the mentally ill person as an antagonist; a 'psycho' that deserves to be locked up, punished, or even killed for their erratic, dangerous behavior,” psychologist Carmen Harra, Ph.D., tells SELF. But the first two seasons are spent building up compassion for Rebecca as a complex character with some very obvious \"quirks.\"\n\nThen, in the third season, we see Rebecca set her sights on revenge after being left at the altar, turn on her closest friends, and even try to take her own life, revealing the true severity of her symptoms. Still, \"our empathy continues,\" Harra says. \"In the real world, compassion is a healing grace for [people with mental illnesses] and is just as crucial for their recovery as appropriate medical treatment.”\n\nAt the crux of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend's success is its understanding that mental illness doesn’t end with a diagnosis.\n\nHow many times have we seen an on-screen character’s mental illness seemingly “cure” itself within a couple of episodes? Or if they do go to therapy, we never see or hear what goes on there. They’re in therapy, end of story. But in Rebecca’s case, we’re with her every step of her therapeutic journey. As a viewer, it has been frustrating at times to witness Rebecca’s failure to truly confront her issues during sessions with Dr. Akopian, her first therapist.\n\n“This is an accurate depiction of the kind of ambivalence towards therapy with which many clients struggle,” Justine Mastin, licensed therapist and owner of Blue Box Counseling in Minneapolis, tells SELF. “It’s one of the ways in which the show gifts us with a nuanced portrayal of both declining mental health and its treatment.” Many patients may not be ready to head into the deep end and do the (oftentimes uncomfortable) work of coming face-to-face with their issues, especially if it's their first time in professional counseling. But, as they build up trust with their therapist, they may become more comfortable getting into those difficult areas.\n\nEven when tackling the topic of suicide, Crazy Ex Girlfriend does so in a way that encourages others to seek help.\n\nWith last year's 13 Reasons Why, we saw how controversial (and damaging) TV depictions of suicide can be. In 13 Reasons Why, the plot romanticizes suicide as a tool of revenge: A graphic scene showing the central character's suicide is followed by a season of blaming other characters for her death and making it seem as if her death was inevitable. It's a fantasy that those who do actually die by suicide will never see play out in real life. Such intense depictions of suicide in the media can lead to what experts call suicide contagion, or suicidal behavior in vulnerable people who see or read about it.\n\nIn Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, we do see Rebecca's suicide attempt, which ultimately isn't the safest way to portray that event, Christine Moutier, M.D., chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, tells SELF. But, crucially, we also see everything that led up to it (including Rebecca's mounting stress and mental health issues), we see her change her mind and ask for help, we see her guilt in the aftermath (and that her friends still love and accept her), and we see her get help—in detail.\n\nAnd, yes, this increased visibility of complex, nuanced characters with mental health conditions matters—a lot.\n\nNot only is the show relatable for those dealing with mental health issues, it's also helping those who don't understand what that experience is really like. It accurately portrays \"how profoundly symptoms of mental health conditions impact a person's life, and that going through the experience of getting professional help, receiving a diagnosis, and learning how to manage mental health is truly a journey,\" Dr. Moutier explains. \"Through this show, Rebecca seems to be able to take viewers on that journey with her—it's unusual for the complexities of suicide risk and prevention to be portrayed with this level of reality.”\n\n“All those contending with mental disorders (a sizable portion of the population) as well as their family members, are incredibly hungry for accurate, real-life portrayals of mental illness in the media,” Stephen Hinshaw, Ph.D., professor of psychology at UC Berkeley, tells SELF. “Although the U.S. public knows far more facts about mental disorders than ever before, fundamental attitudes have hardly budged over the past 60 years.\" The end result is that those who are actually dealing with those disorders don't get the treatments they need and deserve.\n\n\"All the more reason for interesting, sometimes humorous, humanizing, and non-sensationalized portrayals on film and TV,” he says.\n\nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend won’t last forever (series co-creator Aline Brosh McKenna has hinted that the next season will be its last). But hopefully it sets a precedent, because we simply can’t have enough TV shows that shine an authentic, honest light on mental illness.\n\nRelated:\n\n‘Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’ Actress Rachel Bloom Reveals How She Overcame Crippling Sleep Anxiety\n\n'13 Reasons Why' Is Not the Force for Mental Health Awareness People Say It Is\n\n(NSFW) 'Your Crazy Ex-Girlfriend' Star Rachel Bloom Is Begging You to Vote in This New Funny or Die Music Vid"
