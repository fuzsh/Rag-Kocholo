        "text": "The world of cinema is highlighted by vivid scenes that bring out the best in a film, events that leave spectators clinging to the edge of their seats, and unforgettable characters that highlight the best and worst in a person. We, the critics and audience of the world, have seen various themes, topics, and issues brought to light in the form of movies, and oftentimes, TV series. From racial prejudice to misogyny, to class struggles, cinema has become a form of expression to us.\n\nAs humans, we look to relate to what we watch, and as a society, we wish to seek mass comfort by fitting to a certain set of norms. Yet, to many, one topic lays untouched and unmarred: mental illness. If it were mentioned or highlighted in a film, it’d be romanticized in a way that makes it more of a comic or horror insertion, rather than a factual and existing topic.\n\nI am a lover of cinema and films, as well as a student of psychology, and after researching the different ways that mental illness has been diffused and portrayed in today’s media, I was easily able to distinguish the poor and strong depictions of mentally ill characters in some of today’s most popular movies and TV series. As artists of today’s society challenge themselves by delving further into the more controversial topics of humanities, the cinematic industry’s portrayal of mental illness is debated by various experts and the question of “How can we truly depict such emotive and psychological conditions in today’s media?” waits to be answered.\n\nA Definition of Mental Illness\n\nWhat are mental illness disorders? Could they be a personality trait — a simple flaw that a person could carry? Or are they a sudden shift in your mood, that you could easily wave off? According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, these conditions can “affect a person’s thinking, feeling, behavior, or mood… a mental health condition isn’t the result of one event… genetics, environment, and lifestyle influence whether someone develops a mental health condition.” (NAMI 1). The following disorders that we will analyze in films are Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Eating Disorders, Psychosis, Schizoaffective Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorders.1\n\nThe Romanticizing and Dehumanizing of Mental Illnesses\n\nIn many movies and TV series, mental illnesses are only shown for ‘humorous purposes’ or to exaggerate a certain aspect of the film. This is seen in the movie The Shining, where the main character’s arc takes a sudden turn as he descends into “an aggressive psychosis” (Haider 8). Other examples include Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960), which is a staple in cinema and the world’s immediate response when it comes to defining a psychopath. To summarize the perspective on psychosis-influenced characters, “In 80s slasher movies, ‘crazy’ is personified as evil, and often masked or disfigured to ramp up the shock effect” (Haider 8). US psychologist and expert Dr. Danny Wedding masterfully explains this in his book Movies And Mental Illness:\n\n“Films such as Psycho (1960) perpetuate the continuing confusion about the relationship between schizophrenia and dissociative identity disorder (formerly multiple personality disorder); Friday the 13th (1980) and A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) both perpetuate the misconception that people who leave psychiatric hospitals are violent and dangerous; movies such as The Exorcist (1973) suggest to the public that mental illness is the equivalent of possession by the devil; and movies such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) make the case that psychiatric hospitals are simply prisons in which there [sic] is little or no regard for patient rights or welfare. These films in part account for the continuing stigma of mental illness.”\n\nMental health facilities in films are shown as twisted and demented hospitals that are haunted by the ghosts of demon-like patients. The truth is, these asylums are under-funded and neglected. The same idea is given to rehabilitation centers, being described as the center of nightmares and roaming with unstable addicts.\n\nStatistics on This Prevailing Topic\n\nAccording to Doctors Stacy L. Smith, Katherine Pieper, and Christine Moutier in the USC Annenberg article Mental Health Conditions in Film & TV: Portrayals that Dehumanize and Trivialize Characters, the problem also lays in how rare and unexplored this topic often is. While 18.9% of Americans suffer from a mental health condition, and about 450 million worldwide, only about 1.7% show it in films (out of a ratio of 4,598), and 7% in TV (out of a ratio of 1,220). To minimize the percentage even further, of this 1.7% none of the characters were Hispanic/Latino, Middle Eastern/North African, Native American, or a Pacific Islander. As Dr. Smith quotes, “The characters were presented with mental health conditions reflecting an exacerbation of existing inclusion disparities across film and TV. The majority of mental health portrayals feature white… male characters.” (L. Smith 6).\n\nOf the 7% of characters in TV series that were portrayed with a mental health condition, approximately 50% were only diagnosed for humor purposes, setting the bar even lower for many filmmakers and audiences. Quoting Dr. Smith once more:\n\n“Humor was another facet linked to portrayals of mental health conditions. Twenty-two percent of film characters and a half (50%) of TV characters were shown in a humorous or mocking light. These findings suggest that experiences of individuals with mental health conditions are largely trivialized in entertainment storylines.”\n\nHow the Media has Portrayed Mental Illness\n\nIn the absence of real testimonies from people with mental illness conditions, the masses and the general public rely on the media in order to get an idea of what it’s like to carry these symptoms. Yet the media has portrayed mental illnesses as life-eating conditions that can corrupt its victim’s mind and destroy a community. According to the Industrial Psychiatry Journal2, “This has resulted in the belief [sic] in the general population that people with psychiatric disorders are uncontrollable and dangerous and should be feared and avoided.” In many instances, the media adds to the romanticizing of mental health and illnesses by hyper-sexualizing them and exaggerating the conditions to an extent as to produce a humorous or ‘horror’ effect. Not only can this idea be proven in films and TV, but also in news broadcasts, interviews, and in general, the overall stereotype that was created by society due to centuries of prejudice.\n\nOn behalf of popular films such as Suicide Squad and Gothika, female madness, or hysteria, is the subject of sexual objectification. An example is Harley Quinn, a psychiatrist-gone-mad after she is injected with poisons and performed experiments upon by her previous patient and tormenter, the Joker. Due to her sudden fall into hysteria, she immediately becomes a female sidekick and antagonist in the Batman franchise. The idea of a ‘crazy’ and deranged character is tied with an antagonist or an anti-hero, which many usually relate to psychosis and/or borderline personality disorders.\n\nCounterattack\n\nOn the other hand, there are many films and TV shows that have successfully depicted mental health conditions and are highly praised due to this. A Beautiful Mind (2001) was awarded four Academy Awards in the 2002 Oscars Ceremony, including the award for ‘Best Picture’ (Bauer 8). The film depicts the story of mathematician and Nobel Prize winner Josh Nash (played by Russell Crowe), who experienced a decades-long battle against schizophrenia. Another example is Silver Linings Playbook, which shows the struggles of a bipolar man, played by Bradley Cooper, as he tries to live with his conditions after leaving a mental health hospital. Many applauded the actor’s phenomenal performance of demonstrating the range of emotions that bipolar disorder could often include, as well as the way his lifestyle choices were made (Greenstein 4). Lastly, the film Thin (2006) follows the stories of four women who struggle with eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, as they pursue treatment and seek acceptance in one another. It was highly admired for touching a sensitive and rarely-considered topic, as well as not romanticizing eating disorders, especially when about 10 million men and 20 million women suffer from a type of eating disorder at least once in their lives.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs our media has changed and the voices of activists have echoed throughout Hollywood and other cinematic capitals of the world, the neglected theme of mental illness continues to be the subject of hyper-sexualization and trivialization. Biased stereotypes, common beliefs shared by society, exaggerations, the usage for humorous or horror purposes, and the lack of representation in the matter have all contributed to a growing stigma that has worsened the impact of mental health on communities more than the conditions themselves. Yet certain films and TV shows stand out, showing that with the proper research, right actors, and open minds, the true side of mental illnesses are shown and contrast the dehumanized renditions. Quoting blogger Sean Krainert, “As those of us with a mental illness, or close to somebody with one, knows.. There are light and dark sides to our illnesses. And often enough, it is these dark sides that are portrayed in movie characters in order to entertain or drive home a point, often adding to the stigmatization of the disease.” As the artists of today’s society challenge themselves by delving further into the more controversial topics of humanities, the cinematic industry’s portrayal of mental illness is debated by various experts and the question of “How can we truly depict such emotive and psychological conditions in today’s media?” waits to be answered.\n\nNotes\n\nDepression: Depression involves recurrent, severe periods of clear-cut changes in mood, thought processes, and motivation lasting for a minimum of two weeks. Changes in thought processes typically include negative thoughts and hopelessness. Depression also affects sleep/energy, appetite, or weight.\n\nBipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder causes dramatic shifts in a person’s mood, energy and ability to think clearly. Individuals with this disorder experience extremely high and low moods, known as mania and depression. Some people can be symptom-free for many years between episodes.\n\nEating Disorders: Eating disorders are characterized by the intentional changing of food consumption to the point where physical health or social behaviors are affected.\n\nPsychosis: Psychosis is characterized as disruptions to a person’s thoughts and perceptions that make it difficult for them to recognize what is real and what isn’t.\n\nSchizoaffective Disorder: Schizoaffective disorder involves symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations or delusions, and symptoms of a mood disorder, such as depressive or manic episodes.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorders: BPD is characterized by a pattern of instability in emotions (commonly referred to as dysregulation), interpersonal relationships, and self-image. Individuals with BPD can also struggle with impulsivity and self-harm.\n\n(NAMI 1)\n\nThe Industrial Psychiatry Journal is associated with the Industrial Psychiatry of India in this context.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“Mental Health Conditions.” Edited by National Alliance on Mental Illness, NAMI, 2020, www.nami.org/learn-more/mental-health-conditions.\n\nL.
