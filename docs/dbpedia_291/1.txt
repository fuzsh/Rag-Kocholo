National Benzole was a British petroleum company established in 1919 and in the early 1960’s were rebranded as National, as by this time benzol was no longer used as a fuel additive. In the company’s early years, benzol (mix of toluene & benzene) was a by-product of gas production from coal and in surplus supply. It was known to improve the performance of internal combustion engines when added to the fuel, hence the word Benzol in the company name.

Initially the company used pure benzol and this was later a 50/50 mix with petrol. After the war ended in 1945, the proportions of benzol to petrol were reduced and by 1958, benzol was considered a hazardous compound and phased out altogether by the early 1960’s. Thereafter, National Benzol sold only standard petrol. ‘Super’ was a brandname for a National Benzol petrol mix.

During the 1920’s, the company underwent rapid expansion and in 1928 they launched a new advertising campaign that featured the ‘Mr. Mercury’ trademark for the first time. The Mr Mercury emblem caught the public imagination and retained well into the 1960’s. During the 1930’s, the Mr Mercury image was changed from a full length figure to a stylised head wearing a streamlined and winged helmet.
