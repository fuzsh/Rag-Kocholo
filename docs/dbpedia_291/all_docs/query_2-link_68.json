        "text": "Paul Sharp (1912 -1998) was born in Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire and attended Leeds College of Art 1940/1941 before serving in the RAF until 1946, when he continued his studies at the Royal College of Art until 1949.\n\nOf the Benfleet illustrations the black and white pen and ink is the more representative of his work in designing and illustrating a series of books sponsored by National Benzole and published by Chatto and Windus. The two illustrations appear in one of three sailing guides produced ….Sailing tours : Thames and S E ….in the 1960s."
