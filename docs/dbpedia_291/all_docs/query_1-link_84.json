Tim owned and raced vintage cars all of his life. He found a 1930 Alvis Silver Eagle which stayed in the family for over 50 years. He also owned a Speed 20 Alvis Special and campaigned for hundreds of VSCC and BDC events. Her smooth engine and reliability is testament to Tim's skills and craftsmanship.\n\nGuy Tilden Walker\n\nDirector\n\nFrom a very young age Guy was inspired by his father Tim Walker, as he watched him Build and race CJ (1935 Alvis speed 20.) Later in life Guy helped Tim Work on CJ as well as campaigning the car in the VSCC racing series. Racing vintage cars helped Guy understand how to set cars up for reliability and safety. Guy caught the vintage Vehicle bug from then on and began to help Tim in the workshops, where he experienced a wide variety of Vintage Marques and engineering. Guy was constantly surrounded by fine vintage motor cars. The only family car for many years was a lovely Silver Eagle nicknamed ET. Guy attended college and travelled throughout Africa and Australia before returning home to continue working with Tim in 1992. Guy Is very adventurous and indulges in many outdoor activities with his family, such as kayaking, yacht sailing, abseiling etc. His days are spent training the younger members of staff, eating biscuits and moaning!\n\nRachel Tilden Walker\n\nManager\n\nAs Guy’s wife, Rachel has been involved in the business for the past 30 years, mostly offering support, advice and guidance from afar. However, since the pandemic, she has taken a more active role, providing business management and coaching to Guy and the team. Her passions are complementary to the technical expertise of our engineers; education, personal development and team building are areas that really get her energized. Helping the business run smoothly – from a financial and management perspective – is where Rachel’s skills come in handy. She combines her work at Tim Walker’s with a love of boats and sailing – when not in the office she can be found out on the water, teaching people how to skipper their own boats and building teams of young people into amazing sailing crews as they take charge of large Challenge 72 yachts.\n\nMatthew Ridgway\n\nWorkshop Manager & Chief Machinist\n\nMatt came to Tim Walker Restorations in 2001 from Ivan Dutton, the Bugatti specialist. He brought his wealth of Bugatti experience with him and now tackles a wide variety of projects. He supports the rest of the team with his machining skills as he is a fully qualified tool maker. Matt is the Workshop Manager and enjoys training the younger members of staff. You’ll often see Matt's friendly face at concours car events at VSCC racing meets – a real enthusiast!\n\nRob McCartney\n\nRestoration Technician\n\nRob joined the team in 2019. He has vast experience restoring and rebuilding a diverse selection of vehicles, in fact, Rob co-owned a company that imported and commissioned Vintage land rovers, as well as other classic vehicles, from the US and supplied them to the European market. In his spare time, Rob will be tinkering with one of his classic Volkswagens; a 1956 beetle and a sand rail buggy. Competent in welding, spraying, fabrication and mechanical work, Rob is a valued member of the team. He (was) a keen rugby player, and still enjoys supporting his son in the Tring Rugby 1st Team at the weekends, as well as holidaying in his 30ft Winnebago!\n\nRichard Anderton\n\nRestoration Technician\n\nRichard joined the team in 2021. With over 20 years experience restoring and preparing Bugattis and other marques, It would be safe to say Richard is a heritage vehicle enthusiast! He initially qualified as a tool maker/machinist, and deploys these precious skills to manufacture obsolete components to keep these vehicles safely on the road. Richard also has vast experience of race preparing and supporting heritage vehicles at several European tracks - he restored, race prepared, and supported a 1927 Bugatti Type 37 at the Historic Monaco Grand Prix, which competed very successfully. Richard has also been fortunate enough to attend the Mille Miglia several times supporting customers and ensuring the cars reliability throughout. When Richard isn’t at work with us, you’ll find him tinkering with his 1986 Porsche 944, which he is currently restoring.\n\nArthur Walton\n\nRestoration Technician\n\nArthur has been working and tinkering with heritage machines since the early 2000s, when he was working with a well-known Bugatti specialist. During his time there Arthur restored, serviced, and prepared some of the most prestigious vintage cars known. He built a wealth of experience while doing so and enjoyed learning the intricacies of vintage engineering. Since then Arthur has specialised on many marques, including Frazer Nash, Riley, Alvis and many more, and has always found huge satisfaction in keeping the old cars on the road. In his spare time, you will often find Arthur scrambling up a muddy hill on his 1985 1000cc Wasp, which he rides with his friends all across the UK. If he's not in a sidecar you may see Arthur running around his local town which is something he is very good at! Welcome to the team Arthur!\n\nJoe Mellor\n\nRestoration Technician\n\nJoe joined the team in 2014. Since then he has been awarded a Level 3 Diploma in Classic Vehicle Restoration Principles after completing a 3 year apprenticeship with us. In 2016 Joe won the Malcom Davey award; a competition in memory of Malcom Davey for all apprentices in the vintage car sector where each participant was tasked to design and manufacture a special tool to be used in the vehicle restoration environment. During weekends Joe enjoys fettling his fathers' 1930 Ford Model A as well as using the car for various events and car shows. He has recently completed the rebuild of a 1910 Adler engine, including modifying the complex cone clutch arrangement.\n\nToby Proctor\n\nRestoration Technician\n\nMany of you will recognise Toby, as he previously worked for TWR for 7 years! Toby left to complete a Masters degree at Portsmouth University, where he received a distinction in advanced manufacturing systems. His passion and knowledge for heritage cars soon sucked him back to TWR, and thus he rejoined in early 2022. While Toby was at university, he began to organise and start a formula student racing team. In the first year of racing, the team finished in the top 10 concept class and went on to win this class in their second year. By the third year Toby had led the team to even more success, becoming one of the top electric teams in the UK! On the weekends and whenever Toby finds spare time, you will find him tinkering with his Suzuki Jimmy that he has prepared to compete in RTV mud-plugging trials. Toby has supercharged the vehicle, rewritten the ECU and comprehensively adapted the suspension and chassis to create a vehicle capable of most RTV routes! Great to have you back Toby!\n\nRussell Griffths\n\nRestoration Technician\n\nRussell started with the TWR team in October 2023. He is always up for a challenge and loves the mechanical engineering involved with maintaining heritage vehicles. Prior to working with us, Russell, along with a small team, was responsible for building the Speirling McMurtry special - the fastest-ever vehicle up the Goodwood FOS hill climb with a time of 39.081s! this is a monumental achievement and something that Russell is very proud of. In his spare time at the weekends, you will find him whizzing around a motorcross track, preparing for the race series that he competes in at a high level.\n\nGeoff Andrews\n\nMachinist\n\nGeoff helps us manufacture and adapt components for the vintage vehicles. Geoff first learnt the tool maker trade as an apprentice in a marine engineering company. After serving a 5 year apprenticeship, Geoff began work at a gun drilling company where he quickly worked his way up and became chief engineer and chief CAD designer. After 6 years working as chief engineer, Geoff moved to another company where he manufactured and machined engine components for racing cars using CNC machines. Geoff enjoys gardening and doing DIY.\n\nSarah Thaker\n\nOffice Manager\n\nSarah joined us in 2023 from previously running her own village shop and post office which she did for almost 4 years. Sarah's previous experience includes performance data advisor and credit controller for several large companies. Here at TWR Sarah performs the role of office manager which includes a diverse selection of responsibilities including invoicing, sales ledger, day-to-day running of the business and importantly payroll! On the weekends Sarah is often working out or running around after her two young boys.\n\nDoes your car need some expertise?\n\nPlease get in touch with our awesome team!\n\nContact Form Demo\n\nΔ\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail\n\nYour phone\n\nYour Message\n\nI have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.\n\nAddress\n\nTim Walker Restorations Ltd\n\nWoodham, nr Aylesbury\n\nBuckinghamshire\n\nEngland HP18\n\nPhone\n\n+44 (0)1296 770596\n\nFollow us"
