        "meta_description": "Available for auction is a genuine illuminated double-sided 1960’s National Benzole sign. The sign measures approximately 20” in diameter, 6” in depth with an 8” support arm. The seller states the sign is in excellent condition and fully operational, however, it does exhibit signs of aging in the form of a light patina. The sign is constructed of a rounded red metal frame encasing two identical plastic translucent faces featuring the National Benzole logo and reads \"Benzole National Mixture\". The sign’s lighting has been updated to brighter and more energy-efficient LED lights and is wired to a UK plug.Founded in 1919, National Benzole was a major fuel supplier in the UK. The character on the side is a chap called 'Mr Mercury' which was also the company logo. In 1957, National Benzole was purchased by Shell/BP and rebranded in the 1960s to just National. The company became a very common sight for motorists up until the 1990s when it was phased out in favor of the more popular BP brand.Pre-rebranded National Benzole signage is very rare and sought after. Whether you’re a Petroliana fan or an enthusiast of vintage automobilia, this authentic 1960s National Benzole sign would make an excellent addition to your garage or collection. The buyer is responsible for shipping, shipping insurance, handling, and transactional fees.",
