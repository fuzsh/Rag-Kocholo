        "text": "The following text was the introductory talk given by Bryan Sheppard on September 27th 2009 at the unveiling of the Blue Plaque in memory of Janet Blunt.\n\nBryan gave the manuscript to AHA after the talk. It therefore seems fitting after the untimely death of Bryan to print the talk on the History Association website.\n\nJanet Blunt was born in India on 28th April 1859, the daughter of Charles Harris Blunt, a Major General in the Royal Bengal Artillery stationed at Umballa, a military station in the Punjab. After the death of Janet’s mother, Mary, in 1892, Charles retired from active service and brought his family back to England, and lived here at Halle Place. After he died, Janet, a spinster, became a benevolent ‘lady of the manor’.\n\nBetween 1907 and 1931 Janet made a remarkable collection of songs, carols and Morris dances in this village. She was inspired initially by the recollection of songs that her father sang, along with the work of Cecil Sharp and his contemporaries. Whereas other collectors travelled and cycled long distances in their chosen areas of research, Miss Blunt was able to amass a significant collection of songs and Morris dances from the community in which she lived; leaving us with a vivid and priceless record of social music making and Morris dancing.\n\nJanet was effectively the Lady of the Manor in Adderbury West and as such was very much involved in running the estate she had bought from the Risley family. Through her contacts with the tenants and villagers, she was able to note down 125 songs from 46 different singers living in Adderbury and the surrounding parishes. Indeed, people in the village remembered as children hiding under the open window and listening to the old men singing with Miss Blunt playing the piano and writing down the songs and tunes.\n\nJanet Blunt’s housemaid Winnie Wyatt had worked for her from the age of 13. When Miss Blunt died Winnie’s cottage was left to her – (the building-over there). After the funeral when Halle Place was being cleared, most of Janet’s song books and manuscripts were heaped into a number of cardboard boxes and put out for the bonfire! Luckily Winnie knew how important the songs and dances were, saved them and sent them off to the English Folk Dance and Song Society. These manuscripts are now available on line for everyone to see. Without Winnie Wyatt, none of these wonderful old songs and indeed the majority of the Adderbury Morris dances would have survived!\n\nWilliam ‘Binx’ Walton was one of Janet Blunt’s best informants. He was a stonemason, shopkeeper and the landlord of the Wheatsheaf pub up on the Oxford Road. He gave her songs and the local Morris dances which he remembered from his dancing days in the mid 19th century. The Waltons were also bell ringers and Binx recounted how they once took beer to the belfry, got drunk and fell down the stairs and were subsequently banned from the Church.\n\nPerhaps the most famous part of Janet Blunt’s collecting was the detailed notes on the distinctive Adderbury Morris dances, largely gleaned from William Walton and his brother John. The Walton brothers demonstrated the dances on the lawn here at Halle Place using maids and other servants to make up the dance sets! Janet spent many hours meticulously noting down the dances and tunes, and describing the dances in layman’s terms in such detail that they could be reconstructed by the revival Morris team in the 1970’s – but more of that later.\n\nInterestingly there had been an earlier revival of Morris dancing in Adderbury in 1908 at the school in the village. A lady came from Oxford, possibly from Mary Neale’s Esperance Dancers, and, with the help of two old villagers, probably the Waltons, taught the dances to the children. (It is probable that it was in fact one of the Miss Leigh Hoskins who taught the children in 1908 – see Tim Radford’s article, “Female Influences on Morris Dance in Adderbury”, elsewhere on this website.)\n\nOne of those pupils was Charlie Coleman a well known village resident and son of the local blacksmith. This team of Adderbury dancers continued to dance after leaving school appearing at various village events and according to Charlie, were proud to lead the Adderbury Club Day parade on many occasions.\n\nWe do know the names of some of the other dancers in this team; through my conversations with Charlie Coleman in the early 1970’s they were:- brothers Percy and Ronald Pargeter, George Robins and Harry Wallin. They all went to fight in the First World War but only Charlie Coleman returned and so Morris dancing once-again died in Adderbury.\n\nAfter the Great War, Miss Blunt referred William Walton to Cecil Sharp, probably in the hope of seeing the Adderbury Morris dances published. According to the Reverend Gepp’s History of Adderbury, Sharp came to this village to visit Walton. However, Janet Blunt, and indeed Cecil Sharp himself maintain that William, or Binx as he was better known, went up to London to stay with his daughter and whilst there visited Cecil Sharp. By this time Binx was 83 years old and blind, and was to die two weeks later. Sharp wrote of this meeting ‘After I had danced Jockey to the Fair to him, Walton said it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen and then added ……….. ‘Of course I can’t see anything – I’m blind!’\n\nCecil Sharp duly, as Miss Blunt had hoped, published his interpretation of the Adderbury tradition in his series of Morris Books. However. Roy Dommet a well known latter-day authority on the history of Morris dancing, pointed out that “…..unfortunately 1919 was in the period that Cecil Sharp appears to have pressurized informants, as at Abingdon, Brackley and Wheatley, and his interpretations cannot be completely relied upon if there is alternative evidence…”.\n\nWhat Cecil Sharp subsequently published was then somewhat at odds with that noted by Janet Blunt who had carefully some years earlier recorded, albeit in layman’s terms, what she saw. She maintained that all the dances except “The Happy Man” were double stepped, while Sharp has one as a three four step and one as a single step. She also refers to the hand movements as swinging forward and back’ again in contrast to Sharp’s ‘dip in, dip out’ hand movements. In addition Sharp seems to have introduced new movements like processional up and half gyp, whilst leaving out other movements that didn’t fit into his model of dancing gleaned from his earlier work on the Headington Morris Dances. This meant that there were two very different ways of interpreting the Adderbury Morris dances.\n\nSo let’s now leap forward fifty or so years to early 1974 when I decided to try and revive the Morris Tradition in the village having learnt to dance with Barry Care, the ex-squire of the Morris Ring at Moulton in Northamptonshire. Together Barry and I delved into Cecil Sharp’s manuscripts at Clare College in Cambridge which in turn led us to Janet Blunt’s work. Barry’s passion for the tradition cannot be underestimated and it was with his encouragement that I embarked on reviving Morris dancing in Adderbury.\n\nMy enthusiasm being stimulated I tried to arouse some interest in the project amongst my friends from the village. People like Phil Taylor, Charles Hall, Jim and Bill Plester and others showed an interest and I felt the nucleus of a team was there. Around the same time I received a call from John Leslie explaining that Tim Radford, who had recently moved to Banbury from the south coast, was teaching Morris Dancing at an Adult Education Class in the town. He went on to say that I would be welcome to go along. This I did and met with Tim and the “students” who were learning basic dances from the Headington Tradition; I joined in and helped with the teaching. At the end of the session I shared the fruits of my research into the Adderbury Morris with Tim and we agreed to join forces. The following week the students along with a few Adderbury people began practicing the Adderbury dances in the village and the revival was up and running.\n\nDuring the first year of performance in 1975 the team split into two for reasons I won’t go into here. The Adderbury Morris Men continued to dance in the style advocated by Cecil Sharp and dressed in the costume described by him. The newly formed Village side, where membership was restricted to villagers and people from surrounding parishes, took a more radical approach and looked back in more detail at Miss Blunt’s notes and reinterpreted the dances. This included performing dances with songs; a style which is unique to this village. They also decided to wear a different costume and this was based on the memories and photographs of Charlie Coleman, who as I mentioned earlier was a member of the pre First World War revival Morris team and was the last link between the old dancers and the current Morris sides.\n\nSo in conclusion today is a very important day for the Village of Adderbury. A day to remember a very special lady, born just over 150 years ago, without whose foresight the world renowned Adderbury Morris tradition would never have been recorded.\n\nI hope you will join me in saying a big thank you to Janet Blunt. I feel sure she’s up there somewhere listening to us!\n\nThank you Miss Blunt.\n\nBryan Sheppard\n\nRhoda Woodward’s most ambitious contribution to the history of the village of Adderbury was her account of the Schools of Adderbury. In the first two parts of this account she wrote about the Boys’ School, the Girls’ School and the Infants’ School, using material in the archives of New College, the log books maintained at the schools from 1872, HMI Reports and entries in the Parish (later Deanery) magazine. The final section recounted Rhoda’s memories of her own schooling in Adderbury, and it is this section that we are re-publishing here as the final element in our tribute to the work of Rhoda Woodward.\n\nMy own memories of the Infants and Girls Schools date from the 1930s. It is likely that not much would have changed since the beginning of the century. Toilets were still outside, cold and bare, with rusty chains that worked most of the time, except when there was a spell of severe frosty weather. The only hand washing facilities consisted of a chipped sink in the corner of the porches: each one had a cold brass tap, a bar of household soap and a damp roller towel fixed to the back of the door.\n\nInside, the walls were still painted over the bricks; in spite of all the requests by HMI they never did get plastered. As no-one lived in centrally-heated homes, I suppose we were reasonably warm; each week one pupil was chosen to check the temperature of the rooms and record the results in red ink on a chart which was usually pinned to the cupboard door. As long as the thermometer did not drop below sixty degrees Fahrenheit it was considered to be quite warm enough. A large tortoise stove which burned coke heated the pipes which ran round the rooms. Teachers used to put a pan of water on top of the stove to disperse the coke fumes.\n\nIn spite of all the so-called improvements to the windows in the infants school, the big room always seemed gloomy. On very dull days the teacher would have to lower the big lamps from the ceiling, which then had to be lit with a match. It was necessary to get the wicks turned up just the right amount or they would smoke, making the glass black with soot. Both the teachers and the caretakers, who would have been responsible for filling up the lamps with paraffin and trimming the wicks, must have been very relieved when electricity, which had recently come to the village, was installed in 1936.\n\nPhysical exercises, or ‘drill’ as we called it, was done out in the playground or, in the case of the older girls, in the road outside the school, as there was not much traffic went up and down Mill Lane at that time. If there was snow on the ground or it was pouring with rain, we would perform our ‘knees bend arms stretch’ at the side of our desks with all the windows open – usually just as the room was getting warmed up. All the windows had to be opened using a long pole with a hook on the end, as they were high so that children could not see what was going on outside and be distracted from their work.\n\nThere was no such thing as P.E. kit, although we were supposed to wear plimsoles. We girls had to tuck our frocks in the legs of our knickers, which at that time had legs threaded with elastic. If this broke one leg of our drawers would hang below our skirt and make us the laughing stock of the rest of the class.\n\nAt playtime the sound of singing could be heard as we played the same rhyming games as our grandparents must have done; after all, they taught us the words. ‘The farmer’s in his den’, ‘Nuts and May’, ‘Ring of Roses’ and ‘The Good Ship Sails through the Illy Allu O’ are a few that I remember.\n\nSome games changed with the seasons in some mysterious way that I never did get to know when or of any set date. For a while it would be whip and top time; we made our own whips from a length of string – the best sort came from the Co-op grocery parcels. A top cost a penny but were often kept from year to year. Sometimes we would put coloured paper or chalks on the top to make them look pretty when they spun. Then there would be a time for skipping ropes and then ball games. There were quite a few different games could be played by throwing a ball against a wall. In the girls’ school playground we used to throw quite large balls against the wall at the side of Moorey House, but they never complained, although it must have made quite a noise inside their house.\n\nI started school at five years of age. We were each given our special peg for our coats; I do not know how many children could read their own names but probably could recognise their own coat. The new ones sat in small chairs behind small tables, in the small room known as the babies’ room, the second term ones on long desks behind us. I remember that first morning: one of the older children brought round shallow trays of sand for our first lessons; we learned to write the letters and figures that our teacher, Miss Dale, wrote on the blackboard in the sand with one finger, a new figure or letter each day. On Friday we were taught to do small sums and words from the 1,2,3,4 and the A,B,C,D that we had been taught. As each week went by , more and more numbers were added, so that we learnt to read at the same time; it was a very simple but effective way of teaching. When we could show teacher that we could do the lesson, after the blackboard was cleaned we were given another tray and a lump of plasticine; teacher worked with the ones that were a bit slower to learn. While teacher was concentrating on the new ones the next class would be using work cards and a tin of counters to help with the arithmetic, and while they were being taught we would be given the plasticine again or pastels and a drawing book with black pages separated by a sheet of tissue paper.\n\nWe were all expected to know the three Rs by the time we went into the big room the following year. After that first year, there were always end of term examinations, which were all written out by the teachers on the term’s work, and a report, also hand written, though I believe the main part was done on an ancient copier by the boys at the boys school.\n\nEven at that tender age we had the usual history and geography, tables, problems, addition, subtraction, multiplication and mental arithmetic, nature study, sewing, knitting and singing, accompanied by Miss Dale on the piano. The vicar came to give scripture lessons once a week and on other days we had bible stories and sang hymns.\n\nOur teachers often read to us, especially the younger ones, to illustrate a history lesson or to tell us about places in other lands. Even the older ones enjoyed listening to stories, which would sometimes be a chapter from one of the classics. They had a way of making it all sound so real.\n\nAs we got older, lessons gradually became more difficult but had to be done properly; if not, it was not unusual to be asked to stay in at playtime and do the whole lesson again. Talking was not allowed in class time and along with any other misdemeanour could result in having to write out 50 or 100 words again at playtime. All words had to be of at least five letters and could not be copied straight from a page from the dictionary; two words the same would always be noticed. Most other schools seemed to get lines, but we got WORDS.\n\nYear after year, if any new books came we would be asked to bring a sheet of brown paper, which was easy to obtain as all groceries from the Co-op were delivered in a brown paper parcel. We were then taught to cover the books to keep the original ones clean and sometimes to renew covers on the older books.\n\nThe first arithmetic books had squared pages and the writing books a wide space and a narrow one: this was to teach us to keep our figures and letters to a uniform size. History, geography and nature study books had a plain page between the lined one, which was used to draw maps or to illustrate a lesson. There was also what was known as rough books; these were for a first effort when we had to write a composition or essay. Any spelling mistakes or bad English would be marked with the dreaded red or blue pencil and, when corrections had been made, copied into our best writing books. Should any of these mistakes be repeated, which they often were, there would be more blue pencil and a not very complimentary remark and all to be written out ten times.\n\nSewing class was always a very important lesson, or hand work as I believe it was called in the infants school. For the first ones we had to fray the edges of a piece of material and later to stitch a border with coloured silks. Then there was wool work; with a blunt needle with a large eye we made borders and designs on canvas. When we had progressed to a larger rectangle, it could be folded into three and two thirds stitched together to make a bag with a flap. With two press studs added, we had a handbag, which in those days was called a pochette, which was proudly tucked under our arms when we went to Sunday School and which housed our secret treasures.\n\nAs we moved up in class, we began to make clothes, starting with a baby’s bib, which, like future garments, had to be faced with bias binding, which we had to make ourselves by cutting strips of a contrasting material on the cross. There was a special way of joining these strips so that it made a longer piece and did not pucker when it had been sewn with running stitches and then turned and hemmed on the wrong side; the ties also of the binding had to be over-stitched. Other garments were pinafores, a nightdress, several different types of frocks – the first very plain and graduating to gathered skirts, and finally, in the last year, our own choice of material and pattern. This was the only time we were allowed to use the sewing machine.\n\nWe were allowed to buy the things that we had made or, if we did not want them, they were sold at the end of term. As well as clothes we did embroidery cushion covers and table runners; this was a long narrow cloth placed across the centre of the table when it was not being used for a meal. Sometimes some of the gentry ladies, who still visited quite regularly, would ask for something like this to be made specially for them. Only the very best needlework scholars were chosen for this task.\n\nNobody at that time had thought of forming a P.T.A.; we had fetes and concerts to buy the equipment that we needed. When the West End tennis courts were built we raised money for tennis racquets; there was enough to buy cricket bats for the boys and some large rubber balls for the Infants. We had to find sixpence to play on the courts: I think that would have allowed two of us an hour. The headmistress gave up her evening to coach us. Our very best purchase must have been in 1936 when we raised enough money at a concert to buy a large electric wireless. All three schools could then enjoy a new form of teaching as we listened to the schools radio programmes. Our prize possession was carefully returned to its cardboard box and pushed from school to school by two of the older boys on a wheelbarrow.\n\nShould one of us finish the set work before the end of term, the headmistress would often bring a pile of her own mending for us, which was also supposed to teach us to make do and mend. Instead of the usual darning one year I was given the task of letting a piece into the back of a waistcoat that belonged to her husband, who was also headmaster of the boys school. Shortly afterwards there was a school outing to London: we went by train and while on the platform I was reminded by some friends that the Headmaster was wearing the waistcoat and how I would be in big trouble if my stitching came undone. I did not enjoy my day as I was worried that his waistcoat would fall off, and was very relieved when he arrived back at the station all in one piece.\n\nDuring the last two years at school we were taken to Deddington by coach to cookery classes, which were held in a rather dingy hall. There was a cold tap but no sink, except a portable one which was erected in the middle of the room, with a large bucket underneath to collect the waste water. Each week two girls would be responsible for emptying the bucket: should it overflow, the penalty would be having to get on our hands and knees and scrub the floor.\n\nIn the mornings we would plan a meal and go across to the grocers to buy the ingredients: we were able to buy the dinner at cost price to eat for our midday meal. In the afternoon we would make cakes, each pair would have to complete their allotted cleaning job – usually something had to be scrubbed – and write notes on the day’s work. We did learn quite a lot of practical, plain cooking methods.\n\nThere were only two teachers to each school after the Infants, which, after the first year, had the six to eight year olds in one room. The age group eight to eleven were in the small room at the girls’ school, with eleven to fourteen year olds in the big room. We left school at fourteen.\n\nThese were pre-war years and there was not much choice of employment. A few girls went to work in one of the shops or factories in Banbury, although there were not so many then. Most school leavers went into domestic service; it was not unusual for the job to be arranged by one of the parents or relatives without the boy or girl having much say in the matter. There was certainly not much advice from the schools on planning our future.\n\nThere was, however, a reasonable amount of health care. The health nurses still called to inspect heads at regular intervals. Oh, how we dreaded that we would be called out to go into the porch to have stuff put on our heads: I only remember that there were one or two that did. There were not many school rules, but we were not allowed to wear jewellery and long hair had to be tied back and not loose on shoulders. The dentist called and there were medical tests and eye tests: if there was a problem the health nurse would come and give an extra eye test. A test card was always pinned up in the school.\n\nEveryone walked to school, very few people would have owned cars. Some children came from outlying farms or Milton but still seemed to get there on time. Being late was a serious offence. We always seemed to form groups and walk down together, the older ones looking after the younger ones. After the first day children went to school on their own; if your mother brought you to school you were called a titbab.\n\nThe number of pupils according to school photographs was always well over fifty to each school and thought by inspectors tom be overcrowded when they came. We all got very excited when we read in the Deddington Deanery Magazine that ‘A church senior school site had been approved and secured by our Managers on the Milton Road, and that they had instructed the architect to prepare detailed plans for the practical subject rooms and three classrooms to be the first stage. Until the Board of Education has told us just how much they require it is impossible to estimate the cost, but at Mr. Stilgoe’s suggestion it was agreed to set to work to raise money for the school.’\n\nAdderbury and Bloxham held a big fete as they would have used the school as well as Adderbury and we bought blue stamps with ‘Adderbury School’ printed in white lettering, each one costing a penny. However, it was not to be; when a new school finally came it was for a new generation and on a different site.\n\nWhen I left school in July, 1939, war clouds were gathering and by September we were at war. Pupils were no longer expected to go into domestic service: there were more opportunities as people were needed for war work and to fill vacancies in jobs when men and women had been drafted into the forces or to do war work.\n\nRhoda reverted to the school log books to tell the story of Adderbury’s schools in wartime. She brought her history of these schools to a close by showing how they changed once all senior pupils moved to secondary schools after 1950. She then concludes her history in the following words.\n\nA tribute should be paid to all those hard-working people who through those years cleared ashes, carried coal and cleaned the schools. The canteen ladies who managed to prepare all those meals on wartime rations and the Institute caretaker who kept the Institute boiler fire going by begging old shoes and rubbish to help out the coke ration. The Adderbury schools could not have survived without them\n\nWe were always told that our school days were the best years of our lives. It is only years later that I have come to realise how well we were taught. The discipline was hard to take at times, but must have stood us in good stead when a few years later we were called up or had to take any type of war work we were told to do – something which brought an new independence we had not known before.\n\nRhoda Woodward\n\nJackson’s Oxford Journal was a weekly newspaper founded in 1753 by William Jackson, which continued in one form or another until after the First World War. For the first fifty-five years of its existence Jackson’s Oxford Journal was the only local newspaper serving Oxford and surrounding areas and hence Adderbury.\n\nJackson came to Oxford as a young man of 28 in the 1740s after completing his apprenticeship as a printer in London. In 1747 he had made a start by launching a paper called The Oxford Flying Weekly Journal and Cirencester Gazette, but despite having a very experienced partner and despite some attractive inducements to potential readers, the venture only lasted two years before folding. The truth was that at that time there had to be a very good reason for consumers to buy a new-fangled thing like a local newspaper, especially when government stamp duty, taxes on paper and advertising meant that the cost was not inconsiderable.\n\nFour years later, in 1753, Jackson saw a new opportunity in the gathering preparations for a parliamentary election in 1754, and on 29th September 1753 he published the first edition of Jackson’s Oxford Journal, bearing this masthead.\n\nThe Oxfordshire election of 1754 was the most important in the eighteenth century – it also attracted lots of other superlatives: the most notorious, the most violent, the most literary, the most expensive. It gave people a chance to judge just where the country stood – on the government of the day, and on the relatively new Hanoverian monarchy. Such chances came about rarely; at that time politicians preferred not to have elections at all – they were hugely expensive and the outcomes were always doubtful. Much better to arrange things among themselves. It was the Duke of Marlborough who tore up the usual rules, because he wanted the constituency in which he lived to reflect his own beliefs and to supply him with members of parliament that he could deploy at will. This could only be achieved by getting rid of the two sitting members.\n\nAs far as Jackson was concerned:\n\n“[He] could not have ventured at a more auspicious time. This altogether extraordinary election, in a constituency centred about a famous University City, provided him with the three indispensables: sensational ‘copy’; a public avid for news, and, more especially, for scandal; and a large corps of educated literary volunteers, who were competent and eager to supply both gratis.” ( R.J.Robson, 1949: The Oxfordshire Election of 1754, OUP, p.29)\n\nThis is what Jackson said in his first edition about his plans for the paper as a whole:\n\n“This paper will be more complete than any that has hitherto appeared in this Part of the Kingdom. For besides the Articles of News, foreign and domestic, in which we shall endeavour to surpass every other Paper, our situation will enable us to oblige our Readers with a particular Account of every Transaction relating to the present Opposition in Oxfordshire”\n\nSaturday 5th May 1753\n\nIt’s said that people who found newspapers always have two aims in mind: to influence events and to make money. In the course of the 1754 election, Jackson put his newspaper at the heart of current events in Oxford. This was something that he continued to do throughout his reign as proprietor, setting his journal apart from many others at the time who survived on national stories, often plagiarised from London newspapers.\n\nWith his Journal established as a result of the 1754 election, Jackson now had to make money out of the venture – something which he managed to do with great success over the next forty years or so. Cover price was one element: his virtual monopoly gave him some flexibility here, and he encouraged people to take out subscriptions rather than pay separately for each copy. He also seems to have solved the problem of distribution, important particularly for the rural hinterland. The third element was advertising, with the whole of the front page often devoted to advertisements. One sort of advert was particularly attractive to him – ones for patent medicines. The manufacturer could be charged for the insertion (although there is virtually no cost involved) and be charged again when the product was sold on his behalf – either at the Journal’s central office, or anywhere it is delivered.\n\nJackson also managed very successfully to make his various enterprises over the years seem a natural part of Oxford life. Jackson’s the printers was the place you went to have things printed or bound. Jacksons Journal was where you went to find out about Oxford events or to publicise news of your personal successes. If you were going out of Oxford, you needed to have copies of the Journal kept by for your return in case you’d missed something. Jackson also consolidated his position as a printer. The University at the time had two privileges. One was the exclusive right to print almanacs. Their own printing enterprise, however, had “fallen into torpor”, as one account put it, despite the fact that it had moved into magnificent new buildings. Jackson took over the printing of these almanacs in 1768 and continued for another 20 years. The University had an altogether more significant privilege in the right to print bibles, but again here they were in trouble because of the incompetence of their own printers. In 1780, an alternative was found. It was agreed to admit master printers into partnership who could take upon themselves ‘the care and trouble of managing the trade for our mutual advantage’. It was to be in the form of a joint-stock company, with 48 shares of which the University as ‘owner partner’ held half. Expenses were to be shared equally with the partners and profits equally divided. Who better to take on the Oxford end of this than the successful businessman, William Jackson, especially as this entitled him to call himself ‘Printer to the University’, never bad for trade? This system was so successful that it was recommended as a model to Cambridge University by their Commissioners in 1852: ‘We are satisfied that no Syndicate, however active and well chosen, can replace the intelligent and vigilant superintendence of those whose fortune in life is dependent upon its success.’ Finally, in 1782 Jackson took over the Wolvercote Paper Mill, thus securing supplies for his businesses and towards the end of the eighteenth century he joined with others in the establishment of a bank.\n\nBy the 1770s Jackson had his printing business in the High Street, next to the Covered Market. In 1771 he became a leading member of the Paving Commission for the city and in 1786 he received an honorary bailiff’s place and the freedom of the city, although he played no part in council affairs. As soon as the turnpike road to Buckingham and London through the fields of Headington was started in 1775, Jackson bought land beside it and built a country mansion, Headington House, which was finished by 1883. To go with it, he purchased the lordship of the manor. With all this we can truly say that he had arrived.\n\nJackson’s Oxford Journal and Adderbury\n\nGiven that for a large part of its life Jackson’s Oxford Journal was the only local paper serving Adderbury, there are two questions we can reasonably ask:\n\nWhat picture of Adderbury emerges from the coverage of the village provided by the Journal?\n\nWhat picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the Journal emerges from what we know independently about the concerns of Adderbury at this time?\n\nThe coverage of Adderbury life in Jackson’s Oxford Journal was fairly detailed. The British Library’s holdings of the Journal have been digitised and we can ask, for example, how many mentions of Adderbury there are in the nineteenth century? This is the answer, using the British Library’s own categories:\n\nAdvertising 2031\n\nArts & Sports 92\n\nNews 1258\n\nPeople 179\n\nTOTAL 3540\n\nThis works out at about one and a half mentions every fortnight through the century. The interesting categories are Advertising and News.\n\nWe expect there to be advertisements in Jackson’s Oxford Journal – in some editions the whole of the front page might be made up of them. But to find so many advertisements associated with the name of Adderbury is at first surprising; the village was not a large centre of trade, after all. Part of the explanation lies in the British Library’s classifications: they treat as advertisements, for example, all announcements about creditors and debtors. And into the same category go announcements about the meetings and various dealings of Turnpike Committees – and since Adderbury was on the route of three turnpikes it’s not surprising that the village is mentioned a lot. However, there were Adderbury concerns that wanted to advertise goods and services in Oxford and Oxfordshire. The most numerous of these seem to have been private schools, particularly boarding schools, followed by Adderbury’s pubs – and in particular the Red Lion. It makes sense that pubs would seek to advertise beyond the village, since pubs played key roles in the nineteenth century property market, whether as locations where interested parties could get details of properties for sale, or as locations where auctions would take place.\n\nIt’s in the News section that Jackson’s Oxford Journal comes closest to characterising Adderbury. The Journal knew that, outside of Oxford and the small number of towns in its area, it would be addressing itself to largely agricultural communities, and, within those communities, to farmers and landowners. In its centenary edition in 1853, it boasted that “The Oxford Journal has for very many years made a special feature of agriculture. Almost every Landowner and Farmer in the County is a Subscriber. [It has] … great popularity among the agricultural and trading classes.” This audience would want to know about the detail of sales at agricultural shows both locally, regionally and nationally and would be interested in the weather, the state of the market generally, and in particular the cost of foodstuffs, and the prices obtained for stock and agricultural products. And the numerous farming stories would be linked with the name of Adderbury because of the success of Adderbury’s farmers. – largely, but not exclusively, successive generations of Stilgoes at Adderbury Grounds Farm.\n\nIn addition to this, it’s clear that the Journal kept itself well informed of developments that could affect country estates. As early as 1859, for example, it reported:\n\n“The prospects of this County developing its mineral resources is apparently becoming clearer. A shaft is being sunk on land belonging to His Grace the Duke of Marlborough in the parish of Northleigh; mining operations are commenced on the estate of Mr Chamberlin at Adderbury; measurements and levels have been taken by skilful engineers for a tramway intended to convey iron ore from Dr. Wilson’s estate at Over Worton to the Somerton station of the Great Western Railway; while miners … are at the present time procuring, from a depth of thirty-five yards below the surface, a quantity of ‘green stone ore’ at Steeple Aston.”\n\nBeyond farming, the two major types of news that were of interest to the nineteenth-century newspaper reader were death and crime, and Jackson’s Oxford Journal assiduously followed the reports of the various courts and the activities of the coroners at the time. The picture of Adderbury that emerges is pretty mundane, though. There are deaths in the village, of course, but the ones that become newsworthy for the Journal are mostly the result of accidents at work, particularly those resulting from the use of machinery. And the crimes reported are mostly to do with petty theft, particularly the theft of foodstuffs from farms or public houses or animals from public pounds.\n\nThe other question, about what conclusions we can reach concerning Jackson’s Oxford Journal from its coverage of Adderbury, is more complex. We have other newspapers to provide a comparison, the Banbury Guardian from 1838 and the Banbury Advertiser from 1855, as well as knowledge about village affairs derived from other sources such as the Parish (later Deanery) Magazine. And on this basis it’s possible to suggest that the coverage provided by Jackson’s Oxford Journal needs to be supplemented if we’re to gain a complete picture of Adderbury, because it seems that the Journal’s coverage is limited by the interests of its “natural” readership, by its own admission the landowning and professional classes; the coverage also reflects the reports it received and hence the news it could print, as well as the social and political outlook of the Journal itself. We have to assume, for example, that the opening of the Banbury and Cheltenham Through Railway in 1887, a fairly significant event for the village, was not reported in the Journal because it had little significance for its agricultural readership. We can also notice that when the Journal did include local news, it was likely to take an unusual approach to it: it did occasionally, for example, report on an Adderbury Club Day. But it spent virtually no time on the entertainments and parades. Instead it reported on the accounts of the various friendly societies, something that would be of greater interest to its readership who might be involved with the administration of such societies in their locality. Similarly, many articles printed by the Journal were submitted by local Church of England clergymen, as the most literate inhabitants locally and it may be this that accounts for the fact that the Journal did not report on the grand opening, involving more than 500 people, of the Methodist Church in Adderbury in May 1893. Finally, we can notice that the Journal has a preference for accounts of village life that emphasize common purpose and harmony. It was certainly the case that the Journal did not report on the “bitter contention” between villagers and landowners over allotments in Adderbury that was covered in the Banbury Guardian in May 1893.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturning finally to William Jackson himself, he died in 1795. Throughout his life he had taken good care to ensure that his private life remained private, and his obituary in his own journal was amazingly brief and generalised.\n\n“Died on Wednesday Morning last, aged upwards of Seventy, William Jackson, Esq. Proprietor & Publisher of this Journal ever since its first Establishment. In his publick Characterisation his Loss will be long felt. In private Life he was warm in his Attachments, and sincere in his Friendships.”\n\nJackson’s Oxford Journal, 25th April 1795\n\nThere is only one mystery and that is his will. He left £10,000 to his sister, a widow in Leeds, but virtually everything else (house, business and property) to a certain Mary Jones, who had effectively run the business for many years. We will never know whether Jackson simply made a logical choice – Mary knew more about the business than anyone else, so should inherit – or whether there was more to it.\n\nPhil Mansell\n\n2020\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the 230 years since it first opened to Oxford in 1790, the relationship between the Southern Oxford Canal and the village of Adderbury has never been either close or straightforward (see the paper. “Adderbury and the Oxford Canal over 200 years” elsewhere on this website). But the canal, which traverses the parish from north to south, is in 2020 still in rude health as a waterway and retains the great majority of its historical artefacts, all of which now have Grade II listed status. This stretch of canal is also among the busiest on the whole of today’s canal network, with 3956 lock movements recorded at Nell Bridge Lock in 2018, for example.\n\nThis situation has not come about by chance. This paper looks at the broader historical factors well beyond the village that have led to the canal’s survival. Not surprisingly, the key issues turn out to have changed over time.\n\nThe Oxford Canal in the 18th Century\n\nThe initial problems of the Southern Oxford Canal are well known, with construction delayed at Banbury for twelve years because the company ran out of money. But this should not blind us to the fact that the enterprise was extremely well-founded, and it was this which, more than any other factor, contributed to the company’s success in the following century.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Sir Roger Newdigate was the one man who gave the canal its original character and caused the Oxford Canal to get off the ground so early in the day. His energy was prodigious, and once he had lobbied and encouraged all the necessary groups to come together to seek a parliamentary act, he was no less assiduous in guiding the act through its various stages. He was then for many years Chairman of the Oxford Canal Company. Newdigate’s motivation was threefold. First, perhaps as a result of seeing large-scale canal schemes on his two grand tours in Europe, he undoubtedly believed in James Brindley’s original vision: the construction of a “silver cross” of canals to link the main river systems of England. Secondly, he wished to bring economic benefits to Oxford, where he was a long-serving MP for the university. But perhaps most significant was his wish to open the collieries on his Arbury estate and find markets for their output on the model of the Duke of Bridgewater’s phenomenally successful canal into Manchester.\n\nSo the main features of what we can call the business plan of the Southern Oxford were in place from the outset: it had national rather than purely local strategic importance, and it “had coal behind it” and was intended to convey this commodity to London via Oxford and any number of canalside markets large and small, all of which were ready to purchase large amounts of coal for domestic and business purposes.\n\nThe Nineteenth Century: Competition with the Railways and other canal routes\n\nIn addition to the factors mentioned above, the Oxford Canal had two further advantages to enable it to combat competition from the railways and from other canals during the nineteenth century. First, it was to the canal’s long-term advantage that it was built early, before the large cost increases associated with the era of the Napoleonic Wars. Second, the company was conceived as providing only the infrastructure over which others could travel, trade and do business, with its income hence deriving from tolls alone. These two factors together meant that the company was able to earn substantial revenues from the outset and had paid the debts associated with its construction by the middle of the century. It was then able to take action in the face of dissatisfaction on the part of canal carriers and the threat of a rival, more direct route to London, to shorten and straighten the part of the canal between Hawkesbury and Braunston. Work started in 1829 and the new line was opened on 13th February 1834 at a cost of £167,172. The route was shortened by almost eleven miles.\n\nReliance on tolls is sometimes said to encourage a largely passive management style, but in the case of the Oxford Canal it was something which repeatedly proved its effectiveness in negotiations with other canals (where passage over the Southern Oxford’s waterway could be allowed providing there was ongoing recompense for lost tolls) and in providing an easy way of coping with competition (whereby tolls could be lowered, for example, quickly and with the minimum of administrative complexity).\n\nA measure of its success was the fact that, after a century of competition from railways and from the alternative canal route to London provided by the Grand Union, the volume of traffic passing over the Oxford canal as a whole remained much what it had been a hundred years before. What had dropped as a result of competition were the toll receipts and the fact that the more profitable long haulage business had been lost to competitors.\n\nThe Twentieth Century Survival: War, Decline and State Intervention\n\nThe threats to the canal’s continued survival in the 20th century were greater in number and variety and even more severe in their effects than had been experienced hitherto. Two world wars robbed the canals of the manpower they relied upon, competition from the fledgling road haulage industry robbed canals of short haul traffic, falling demand for coal led to much reduced activity, while a huge backlog of maintenance issues built up, well beyond the ability of an individual company to manage. Together these problems meant that only government intervention could solve the canal’s problems.\n\nThe first round of government intervention came when it was clear that conscription in the First World War had robbed the Southern Oxford Canal together with the other canals of the men needed to keep the canal trade going. As a result, a scheme was agreed which compensated the canal companies for the business they had lost.\n\nThe second government intervention was much more far-reaching in its effect and came with the nationalisation of transport by the incoming Labour Administration after the Second World War, in 1948. It has sometimes been claimed that the government of the time was initially unaware that it had nationalised the canal system: many of the canal companies had come to be the property of railway companies, the real focus of the nationalisation movement, with the canals entering the process by default. Whatever the truth of this, it appears that the government had no plan for the nation’s waterways at the time of nationalisation. In the event, it took twenty years until the Transport Act of 1968 for a clear picture to emerge. In this Act, Minister of Transport, Barbara Castle, proposed a tripartite division of the waterways into commercial waterways, that were believed to have a viable future, leisure waterways, which would receive government funding for their maintenance, and remainder waterways, for which there would be no public support.\n\nThe recognition of the leisure uses of canals owed a lot to the work of Tom Rolt, whose popular 1944 book, Narrow Boat with its descriptions of the unchanged way of life on canals, proved attractive to many with increasing amounts of leisure time, and to the activities of the campaigning group, the Inland Waterways Association, but also, it appears, to the views of Castle herself. She wrote in her 1993 autobiography, Fighting all the Way, that:\n\n“A source of satisfaction was what I was able to do for the canals. I had always been fascinated by inland water­ways. I had been on a couple of canal holidays with Jimmie and had been struck by how quickly one could escape from drab industrial surroundings as one slipped between the hedges lining the towpath in a flat-bottomed boat. I believed that messing about in boats was a leisure activity which should be increasingly available to everyone.”\n\nThere remained a problem for the Southern Oxford Canal. The canal was by this time in bad shape physically and the question was whether it would make it into the category of leisure waterway, or would it be consigned to be a remainder waterway with no financial support and no protection by legislation? In the event, it seems that an amount of subterfuge was required. The story has been told a number of times. Here is one version (Robinson, 2008):\n\n“The death of the veteran canal boatman Jack Skinner, at the age of 88, severs a link going back more than 200 years in the tradition of the coal and freight-carrying trade on Britain’s canals … in 1967, he helped to save the Oxford canal from closure …. Treasury officials had recommended filling in the waterway, arguing that it was no longer commercially viable. Jack was asked to take Barbara Castle, then minister of transport, on a fact-finding trip from Thrupp to Lower Heyford. He took the precaution of going out the night before and getting the cooperation of the lock keepers en route to make sure there would be enough water in the pounds to give the impression that there was more water in the near-derelict canal than there actually was. “She never knew the difference – and it done the trick,” he recalled. Castle decided to save the canal, ultimately securing enough subsidy to keep open 1,400 miles of commercially non-viable canals for pleasure cruising. Everyone who now enjoys fishing in the Oxford canal, or cruising on it, or walking along the towpath should remember with gratitude the trick that Jack played.”\n\nTwenty-first Century Survival: The canal as “heritage asset”\n\nThe survival of the canal forward from the late twentieth and into the early twenty-first century looks rather more certain than at any previous time its 230-year life. The reason for this is that the canal, and indeed canals in general, have come to be seen as part of the national heritage, with, as we have seen, local canal assets enjoying Grade II listed building status.\n\nIt is difficult to provide a chronological history of the growth in importance of “heritage”. Even the word itself is difficult to define. But it is undeniable that public interest in the past is at an all-time high, as witness the unprecedented membership levels for the National Trust and English Heritage, together with the coverage of historical and heritage topics in television programmes and popular magazines. The beneficial role that canals can have in urban regeneration projects has been shown, particularly in Brindley Place and Gas Street Basin in Birmingham and in Gloucester Docks, and the National Waterways Museums at Ellesmere Port, Gloucester and Stoke Bruerne have provided a focus for historical interest.\n\nBut the event that had perhaps the greatest influence was remote from canals. During the August Bank Holiday in 1980, developers demolished the Firestone Tyre Factory on the Great West Road in London. It was widely believed that the demolition was carried out in anticipation of the building becoming listed in the near future. There was a public outcry, and, as a result, the relevant government minister, Secretary of State for the Environment Michael Heseltine, took a series of measures which had the effect of shaking up the old-fashioned and slow-moving protection system described by Thurley (2013). He speeded up the listing process, enlarging its scope to include nineteenth and twentieth century buildings, and in 1984 created a new quango, English Heritage, to become the government’s principal statutory adviser as well as take on responsibility for the sites previously managed by the Ministry of Works. Ten years later, the creation of the National Lottery Heritage Fund in 1994 provided another confirmation of the importance that heritage had assumed.\n\nCertainly, the latest body to have responsibility for the canals, the Canal and River Trust created in 2012, appears to have little doubt that heritage Is a key part of its role, as the following extract from the Trust’s 2018 Annual Report shows:\n\n“The canals and river navigations cared for by the Trust were created for industry and serve very different purposes today. They are free to access and use. They contribute to the physical and mental wellbeing of communities, visitors and volunteers; adding to the quality of life of those who participate and engage with them. They run through towns and cities and across rural areas and permit a range of leisure activities and enjoyment of nature and heritage in a way that few other attractions do. The Trust’s historic waterways deserve to be cherished and passed on to future generations, so that they too may benefit from and enjoy them. The Canal & River Trust is the custodian of a rich and diverse waterways heritage in England and Wales, much of it over 200 years old. Many of the Trust’s heritage assets are designated as scheduled monuments, listed buildings and conservation areas.”\n\nPhil Mansell\n\n2020\n\nReferences:\n\nCastle, B (1993): Fighting all the Way.

Yale University\n\nJoan Frederica Mathewana Granville (known among close friends and relatives as Mathewana) was the daughter of Bernard Granville of Wellesbourne Hall, Warwickshire. She was born at Calwick Abbey Staffordshire about 1830 a direct descendant of Admiral Sir Richard Grenville, the naval hero of Elizabethan days.\n\nOn August 10th 1850 she married the vicar of Wellesbourne, the Reverend Lord Charles Paulet (born 13th August 1802). He was the second son of Charles Ingoldsby Paulet 13th Marquess of Winchester and Anne Marchioness of Winchester. At the time of the marriage Charles was aged 42 and Mathewana aged 20. She was his second wife, he previously having married Caroline Margaret Ramsden the daughter of Sir John and Lady Ramsden.\n\nCharles and Mathewana had three children. They were Ernest Ingoldsby Paulet born August 22nd 1851 who died on February 5th 1853 aged 18 months; Adela Paulet born February 22nd 1854 at Wellesbourne; and Eleanor Mary Paulet also born at Wellesbourne in May or June 1858.\n\nOn July 23rd 1870 Charles, aged 67, died at 34 Regency Square Brighton leaving approximately £45,000. The result was that Mathewana at the age of 40 needed to find somewhere for herself and her two daughters to live. Lady Paulet seems to have been financially secure and in 1871 they were lodging with Hannah Ravenhill at Leamington Hastings in Warwickshire. Over the next four years the family seem to have based themselves in the Manor or Clarendon hotels in Leamington Spa. They also stayed for the ‘season’ in various resort hotels such as at Buxton and Torquay. After moving to Adderbury Lady Paulet and her daughters continued to winter on the south coast or across the channel. Torquay and Cannes were two of her favourite destinations.\n\nTowards the end of 1874 the Paulets arrived in Adderbury but why they choose here is unknown. During the twenty year period 1874 to 1894 the family played an important part in the life of the village including the church. The Paulets moved into Hall House in West Adderbury, known today as Le Halle Place. This was rented from the Risley family. The first thing Lady Paulet did was to change the name of the house to the Manor House. Although the house had never been a Manor presumably the new name was more in keeping with her status. The change of house name was quickly followed by a change in the name of the road from Mud End to Manor Road.\n\nThe first record of the Paulets in Adderbury comes in the Adderbury Parish Magazine for January 1875 when the ‘Misses Paulet gave their talents for a concert for the benefit of Mr Wells the organist and in February 1875 the Magazine stated that Lady Paulet entertained a large gathering of aged guests on the 6th January, who sat down to a good dinner, the women afterwards being entertained with tea, while the old men enjoyed their pipes. The Miss Paulets with Mr Crow were very active in attending to the wants of all present.\n\nThe Paulet’s generosity was a feature of their life in Adderbury and the wider world. Lady Paulet was involved in a lot of charitable work as a patron as well as an organiser of events.\n\nWhilst living at Wellesbourne and Leamington she gave donations to a variety of charities, orphanages and causes such as the Girls Industrial School. She was patron of St James the Less church and school building fund in Liverpool and these good causes continued to be supported by her after the move to Adderbury. In 1877 £5 was given to the Stafford House committee for the relief of sick and wounded Turkish soldiers and The Freeman’s Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser for 26th January 1880 noted that Lady Charles Paulet had sent a present of twelve pairs of blankets for the Duchess of Marlborough’s Relief Fund.\n\nWhilst living at Adderbury she continued her earlier connections by supporting national charities as well as those in Leamington and Birmingham. Lady Paulet was particularly keen on helping women in need. At Leamington she ran an annual stall to raise funds for the Charitable Repository for the benefit of gentlewomen in reduced circumstances and she also supported the Royal Patron of Temperance – a house for women inebriates.\n\nIn 1885 at the Adderbury Flower Show Lady Paulet showed her support for the elderly people of the village by supplying tea for those who were on Parish Relief and she also paid for them to have free entry to the show. At the same show she paid and arranged for children from the Banbury work house to attend. Again in 1887 she sent and paid for the transport, attendance and tea at the show of 30 Banbury workhouse children. During the winters of the 1880s soup kitchens were begun in the village to which Lady Paulet gave monetary donations. Between 1881 and 1894 Lady Paulet also made an annual donation to the village school’s clothing fund. By 1889 her daughter Eleanor had become secretary of the local district for the Oxfordshire Working Guild. This charity made garments for the poor and these were distributed around the parishes of the county.\n\nSome other village groups that benefitted from Lady Paulet’s generosity were the Drum and Fife band (a donation for new musical instruments) and the fire brigade (new uniforms). She also gave £20 towards the parish room fund. The Milton Branch of the C of E Temperance Society was given a donation and there were several donations towards the Reading Room Club over the years. She regularly invited various village groups to the Manor House for a meal. These included the choir, the bell ringers and the farmers.\n\nBoth Adela and Eleanor followed in their mother’s footsteps by supporting what was happening in the village. They were involved in raising money and supporting the church. During the Paulets’ time in Adderbury the daughters made various things for the church. These included white silk offertory bags, two alms bags for Milton church and on another occasion some green embroidered silk hangings for the church. The daughters, along with Lady Paulet and Mrs. Cobb, produced a set of altar carpets for church festivals.\n\nIn 1878 at the Choral Association gathering of the local Deanery a new banner for the church, was given as a gift by Eleanor and Lady Paulet presented a violet Pall to the parish. This was a cloth that was spread over a coffin or hearse at a funeral.\n\nRegular donations were made to the Sunday School between 1877 to 1894 and in 1889 a reredos for the side chapel was planned. Lady Paulet offered a piece of oak for a Triptych, i.e. a centre frame picture with sides to fold over. Miss Grace Wilson undertook to paint the picture, and when the organ needed retuning and cleaning Lady Paulet gave £2 towards the cost. She was also very generous in supporting the restoration of the church and hosted public sales of work at the Manor House to raise funds. In 1888 the Churchyard was improved on the north side by turfing the edge of the border, and by putting up fences to keep people off the grass. This was paid for by Lady Paulet as was the cost of repairing a seat which was originally a gift from her Ladyship.\n\nIn 1887 the village celebrated the Queen’s Golden Jubilee and decided to install a new clock and chimes to mark the occasion. The following article appeared in the The Bell News and Ringers Record for January 14th 1888.\n\n“ADDERBURY, OXFORDSHIRE – DEDICATION OF THE NEW JUBILEE CLOCK AND CHIMES.\n\nIn June Adderbury celebrated Her Majesty’s Jubilee in the manner that was followed in most places—viz.: by a substantial dinner to all the residents—but a movement was set on foot for the purpose of securing some permanent memorial of the occasion, and it was resolved a new clock and chimes in the tower of the parish church would be a fitting memento of one of the most memorable events of our time. Lady Charles Paulet took the greatest interest in the proposal, and through her well-directed efforts and those of others of the parishioners, the movement took a practical shape, and now in the old tower of Adderbury church there is a clock and chimes of the most modern construction. To celebrate the dedication of the new clock, and also as a memento of the Jubilee year, on Saturday week trees were planted at Adderbury East and West, and also near Milton by Masters Gepp, Master Cecil Granville, the Misses Bennett, the Misses Gardner, and the Misses Turner and the tree planting was the occasion of much interest.\n\nIn the evening Lady Charles Paulet entertained at her residence a number of the leading farmers and others to a supper of the most liberal description. The chair was occupied by the Rev. H. J. Gepp, and the vice-chair by Lieutenant Granville. At the conclusion of the repast, the Chairman proposed “The Queen,” which was loyally drunk..….In proposing the health of their generous hostess, Lady Charles Paulet, the Chairman said it was a very fortunate day for them when her ladyship determined to settle at Adderbury. She took the greatest interest in the parish, and in every possible way endeavoured to promote the welfare of the inhabitants. Among her many other acts of kindness they had only to look at the assistance she gave them in the restoration of their noble church, which by her generous help they were able to carry out.\n\nThe Chairman then gave ” Success to the new Church Clock,” and said that as Adderbury had now a railway station, it was only fitting that they should have a clock showing the correct time. If any one there took the trouble to go up to the belfry they would see that the clock was really a work of art. He was pleased that they had such a permanent memorial of the Queen’s Jubilee as the clock and chimes would form’, and considered they had a great deal to be proud of in Adderbury.\n\nThe same evening the choir and ringers were entertained to supper by Lady Charles Paulet, and at 11 o’clock the dedicatory service in the church began. The building was brilliantly lighted, and there was a large congregation. After prayers, the vicar gave a short but appropriate address upon the words—”Redeeming the time.” After the address, the choir and clergy proceeded to the end of the church near the tower, and the hymn ” O God, our help in ages past,” was sung, and then the Vicar said—” I do solemnly dedicate the clock placed in this tower as a memorial of the jubilee of our Queen, and to the glory of God, for the use of the inhabitants of this parish.” At five minutes to twelve Miss Paulet set the new clock going by pulling a rope in the tower, and the intervening five minutes were spent in silent prayer. At twelve the new clock in sonorous and melodious tones proclaimed the advent of a new year, and the Hymn “Father let me dedicate all this year to Thee,” was sung. The service then ended. Near the tower a brass has been placed on the wall bearing the following inscription:-” This clock with quarter chimes was erected in this tower by the inhabitants’ of Adderbury to the glory of God and in memory of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. December 31st, 1887. ‘Redeeming the time.’ The memorial plate, which is nicely engraved, was presented by Miss Paulet. The new-clock is replete with all the modem improvements so as to make a very accurate timekeeper, and form a standard for time in the village. The main frame of the clock is of one solid casting of iron, planed smooth and true, with all the various wheels, levers, and other working parts a fixed to it by screws in such a manner that any separate one may be removed without interfering with any of the rest. All the brass wheels have had their teeth cut from the solid, so as to he perfectly accurate and smooth. The clock shows time on two dials, facing east and west. It chimes the “Cambridge” quarters upon four bells, and strikes the hours upon the largest bell. The movement is nicely enclosed in a glass fronted case in the ringing room. Messrs. J. Smith and Sons, Midland Clock Works, Derby, carried out the work. The cost was about £130. Most of the inhabitants are bent upon adding the carillon machinery to their Jubilee clock, and are very anxious to have the Coronation Hymn at their next flower show. A considerable sum is already guaranteed for the purpose.”\n\nThe Adderbury Flower Show was first held in 1877 and Adderbury Horticultural Society was under the patronage of Lady Paulet and other notable gentlemen!! Competition entries were staged in a large marquee, and the appearance of the tent was added to by a number of pot plants being sent for decoration only. These were supplied annually by Lady Paulet, the Rev. H. J. Gepp, and others. During the years that Lady Paulet was in Adderbury she strongly supported the Flower Show. On five occasions the Manor House grounds were used for the event. In addition to the prizes given by the show committee extra prizes were given by her ladyship and her daughters. In 1878, for example, Lady Paulet gave a wheel barrow for the best 12 round white potatoes whilst Adela gave a basket for 8 culinary apples, and a basket for a collection of fruit. Eleanor gave a garden-line for the best lettuces and a garden line for the best marrow by weight.\n\nHer Ladyship also entered exhibits through her head gardener, winning classes that included the best collection of Roses and best collection of Asters. Besides supporting the Adderbury Flower Show Lady Paulet also entered other local Flower Shows such as the one held annually at Banbury.\n\nThe first of the Adderbury Horse Races was run on the field at the back of the Manor House at the same time as the Flower Show took place on the Manor House grounds. Lady Paulet was a supporter of the races and two of her male relatives Lieut. C. D. Granville and George Granville were patrons. Being seen at events was an important aspect of Victorian Society and Lady Paulet and her daughters were often recorded in the local and national papers as guests at gatherings. For example they attended the County Ball at Banbury Town Hall, a garden party held by the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough at Blenheim Palace and a garden party held by Holford Cotton Risley at Deddington. In 1888 they attended the Warwickshire Hunt Ball and H. Duc Norris’s daughter’s wedding at Chacombe House.\n\nIn the 1880s both of the daughters got married. In 1886 Adela married Frederick Lecoq Thorne who lived in the Manor House in Mill Lane. Adela was his second wife. She had not been very well in the early 1890s and died in London on July 15th 1893 where she was being treated. The Deanery magazine records that …….”Mrs. Thorne having died in London was brought to Adderbury, and taken at once to the Church….The coffin, covered with purple velvet and brass ornaments, was placed on the wheeled bier, where it remained from Monday till Wednesday with standard lights at the foot and head. Relatives and friends kept constant vigil beside the beloved form, and many visited the Church to say a prayer and to shew their interest and sympathy on the occasion……. the Church being nearly full, and the coffin being borne to its final resting-place—a simple earth grave lined with moss situated on the west side of the Church—by choirmen vested in cassock and surplice. There was a wealth of beautiful flowers in cross and wreath round the bier and some way down the nave. The Choir sent a letter of condolence and sympathy to Lady Charles Paulet, signed on their behalf by Mr. Ward.”\n\nIn memory of his wife and daughter Dr Thorne paid to have a Lych Gate erected. This was dedicated on January 11th 1895 and the Deanery Magazine records that…”It has been built from designs by Mr. Webb…. and forms a very ornamental way of approach to the Churchyard and Church: The oak woodwork supports a Stonesfield slated roof, and rests on piers of Hornton stone. The ridge of the roof is of lead, and in the centre is a brass cross enclosed in a circle. On the upper beam facing east runs the inscription. “In memory of Adela Thorne, died July 13, 1893;” and on that facing west “In memory of Winifred Lillie Thorne, died July 26, 1892. “The gates themselves are low, of pretty design, and with brass fittings. Mr. Thorne has also given us a new gate for the side path. The whole harmonizes well with our fine old Church and well-kept Churchyard, and while standing as a suitable memorial to those who are gone, is a beautiful object for the passers-by and the parishioners to look at……”\n\nIn memory of her daughter Lady Paulet presented a stone figure of the Blessed Virgin to fill the large niche on the north side of the east window of the church. The work was entrusted to Messrs. Farmer and Brindley of London.\n\nOn June 4th 1889 the Morning Post recorded Eleanor’s marriage of June 1st to Edward Thomas Henry Hutton. The Parish Magazine also recorded the event.\n\n“The people of Adderbury have taken so much interest in the marriage of Miss Paulet and Colonel Hutton, which took place at St Paul’s, Knightsbridge, on the 1st of this month that they will doubtless approve of their good wishes to the newly married pair for a long and happy life being expressed in the Parish Magazine. Miss Paulet belongs to a family which has for a long time been resident in Adderbury, and the members of which have always acted as kind neighbours as well as good friends to the church and the poor. She has herself been most kind and thoughtful for others, and always ready to assist in the various works which are carried on for the good of the parish.- Now that she is leaving Adderbury, she may be sure that she takes with her the good wishes and gratitude of many in the place.”\n\nParish Magazine July 1889\n\n“The Bride and Bridegroom paid a short visit to Adderbury on the 14th and 15th of June and a triumphal arch was erected not far from the Green in Adderbury East, and another near the bride’s former home in Adderbury West. The bells rang out a merry peal as Colonel Hutton and his lady drove through the street, where many were assembled to greet them. To celebrate the event Lady Paulet gave a series of entertainments, on Friday to the Choir and Ringers, and on Saturday, in the afternoon to the women of Adderbury West, and in the evening to the men. All enjoyed very much her Ladyship’s hospitality, and responded most heartily to the toast of “Health and Happiness to the Bride and Bridegroom. By the kindness of the family, the people of Adderbury had an opportunity of inspecting the handsome wedding-presents, which filled a large room and were on view for two days. Although Mrs. Hutton has left us, we feel sure she will not forget her Adderbury friends in her new life and home.”\n\nColonel and Mrs. Hutton continued to support the Flower Show and Races whenever possible with both extra prizes at the races and their attendance. One great attraction for the Flower Show in 1889 was Colonel Hutton bringing a 30 strong band of the 1st Battalion the Kings Royal Rifles. Lady Paulet organized the transport of the band from Banbury Station to the Manor House where they were fed and looked after. Despite heavy rain in the morning, heavy showers in the afternoon and thick fog on the race course in the late afternoon there was a good attendance with visitors coming from as far away as Warwick and Leamington. Those attending were faced with whether to look at the exhibits, listen to the superior playing of the band or attend the horse races.\n\nMost went to the races first!!\n\nThe death of Adela meant that Lady Paulet now had no family in Adderbury and as Colonel and Mrs. Hutton were due to travel to Australia in early 1894 Lady Paulet decided to travel with them to be near her daughter Eleanor.\n\nIn 1894 the Parish Magazine printed the following:-\n\nThe Lady Charles Paulet – Many of the parishioners were unwilling that Lady Charles, who has been such a public benefactress to the place for more than twenty years, should leave us without some acknowledgment in word and act. …. An address, signed by the Vicar and Churchwardens, together, with a framed picture was forwarded to her Ladyship before she left England.\n\n“We, the Vicar and Churchwardens of Adderbury, on behalf of the parishioners, desire to express our sincere regret to your Ladyship at your departure from the parish after your long residence amongst us. We thank you for your many acts of kindness and liberality, and we wish to record our sense of your constant readiness to promote the well-being of the parish and the people of Adderbury, especially your generous help towards carrying out the restoration of the Parish Church. We trust that you may be spared in health and happiness for many coming years, and in the name of the subscribers to the accompanying picture, we ask your acceptance of it as a memento of our regard and esteem. – Henry J. Gepp, Vicar, Nathaniel Stilgoe, W. B. Bennett. Churchwardens – January, 1894.”\n\nLady Charles replied: –\n\n“My dear Mr. Gepp, – Will you convey to all my friends in Adderbury my heartfelt thanks for their kind remembrance, which has touched me deeply. It is so little I have been able to do for them that I am surprised they should have thought of offering me anything. I shall value the beautiful gift greatly…… Hoping our thoughts and prayers may often unite us, Believe me, my dear Mr. Gepp, yours very sincerely, M. Paulet. – February 2, 1894.”\n\nIn 1894 they sailed to Australia where Lady Paulet made numerous friends during her visit there in company with her daughter and son-in-law, General Sir Edward Hutton, Commander of the New South Wales forces.\n\nBy May 1896 Lady Paulet, Colonel and Mrs Edward Hutton had taken a lease on 65, Cadogan Gardens, London for the season and between 1897 and 1899 Lady Paulet is recorded in Kingstown, Jamaica and New York.\n\nLady Charles Paulet died aged 83 on December 10th 1918 at Fox Hills, Chertsey, the home of her daughter and son in law.\n\n“Endowed with great beauty,” wrote a correspondent of the “Times,” “a saintly mind, and a gracious presence. Lady Charles Paulet was a type grande dame whose whole life was spent in thinking of the welfare of others rather than of herself. It has been said of her that in all her long life she had never been known to say an unkind word nor do an unkind act to man, woman, or child about her. Accompanying her daughter and son-ln-law, General Sir Edward Hutton, in Australia and Canada, she exercised a remarkable influence upon all she met.\n\nThe funeral took place at Wellesbourne, a requiem service being held at Lyne Church, Chertsey before the body was removed to Wellesbourne, where it was interred in the family vault in Wellesbourne Church.”\n\nReferences\n\nAdderbury Parish Magazine and Deddington Deanery Magazine 1875-1893 National newspapers\n\nBanbury Guardian and Banbury Advertiser 1875-1893\n\nBarry Davis\n\n2020\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe first half of the nineteenth century saw an unprecedented expansion in the efforts of central government to gather information about aspects of national life that had previously been held to be matters for purely local concern. For example, listing only enquiries which gave specific results for Adderbury, Arthur Young had reported on the state of agriculture in 1809, there was an enquiry into charities in 1826 and there would be the report of a commission into Friendly and Benefit Societies in 1874.\n\nWhat the government wanted to know in 1851, however, was more far-reaching than any of these other enquiries. First, there was the “ordinary” ten-year census, the sixth of its type. This time round, however, the census not only recorded the names and numbers of all household residents in the United Kingdom on the night of 30th March; but it also wanted more precise details about their place of birth, age and occupation, as well as new information about their marital status, their relations to the head of the household and any disability they might have. Then there was an educational census which aimed to ascertain how many boys and girls were being taught in classes on a specified day and the type and size of the schools they were attending. The third census, a census of attendance at religious services, was the most contentious.\n\nThere were two major areas of enquiry in the religious census. First, the government wanted an exact measure of the number of sittings in places of worship compared with the number of the local population; with the country going through substantial change, especially with the creation of new, urban areas, finding out about the availability of places to worship seemed a reasonable enquiry at the time. Second, however, the government wanted to know exactly how many people actually sat on the available seats on 30th March 1851. It was the answer to this second question that was most eagerly anticipated in the country as a whole. On the one hand, the Anglican church feared that the results of the religious census would threaten the status of their church as the Established Church. On the other hand, members of dissenting congregations looked forward to having their increasing status and legitimacy confirmed by the survey results.\n\nThe Results of the Religious Census: National Trends\n\nAlthough the figures and tables published in 1854 proved difficult to interpret, at the highest level of generalisation a fairly clear picture emerged. Cannadine (2017) puts it as follows:\n\n“… it was generally agreed that in the case of England and Wales only half of the population who could have gone to church on that particular Sunday in fact did so; that half of those attending (which meant one quarter of the whole population) were Anglicans who worshipped at the established Church of England; but that the other half (and thus another quarter of the whole population) attended dissenting chapels or (in much smaller numbers) Catholic churches instead.” (pp.253-4)\n\nThe Census Locally\n\nAt the time of the census, the parish of Adderbury consisted of the ‘townships’ of Adderbury East and Adderbury West, the chapelries of Barford St John and Bodicote and the hamlet of Milton. Taken as a whole, the parish contained Anglican places of worship in Adderbury, Bodicote and Barford St John and dissenting congregations in Adderbury West (Quakers and Independents), Adderbury East (Wesleyan Methodists), Bodicote (Baptist and Wesleyan Methodist Chapels) and Milton (Primitive Methodists). All of the dissenting congregations had reached the stage of maturity where they had a permanent building for their exclusive use. The wider Adderbury Parish of the time hence clearly shared with others in “Banburyshire” an openness to dissent which revealed itself in the percentage of “dissenter sittings” in the Banbury registration district for the census, which, at 44.29%, was far higher than the 31.34% returned for the county as a whole.\n\nResults for Adderbury and Milton\n\nThe census results for Adderbury and Milton, as summarised by Tiller (1987) are as follows. It should be noted that the census asked how many seats in places of worship were free and how many were paid for by subscription (a large source of income for many congregations).\n\nADDERBURY EAST, Population 978\n\nSt. Mary the Virgin: Average attendance 240 (This is, according to Tiller, an “unsigned and extremely scant Anglican return”. The vicar at the time, Rev Charles Alcock, was apparently an extremely assiduous and hard-working parish clergyman (Allen, 1995, pp. 23-24); it has to be assumed that, in failing to give a satisfactory return, Alcock was following the lead of his Bishop, Samuel Wilberforce, who told the House of Lords shortly before the census was issued that “if consulted by the clergy of his diocese as to the course they ought to pursue, he should be inclined to advise them not to answer the queries”. In the event 27.1% of the Anglican returns in the Oxford diocese show clerical failure to answer compulsory questions or carry statements of clerical refusal compared with just 10% nationally)\n\nWesleyan Methodist Chapel: Erected 1829.

Signed Thomas Tarver, Steward, Bodicote.\n\nCommentary on Results\n\nIt is obvious that the sketchy nature of the Anglican return for Adderbury makes futile any attempt to replicate the national results locally. But it is clear, however, that in Adderbury as in the nation as a whole, fewer than half of the inhabitants attended any form of religious service on the census Sunday. Tiller (1987, p. xxx) suggests that for many there was nevertheless a “strong moral code”, a sort of “popular religion”, which was “a loose combination of unofficial Christianity and large elements of superstition and custom, selectively validated by institutional religion”. In support of this view, Tiller quotes from Flora Thompson’s description of Cottisford:\n\n“Many in the hamlet who attended neither church nor chapel and said they had no use for religion, guided their lives by the light of a few homely precepts, such as ‘Pay your way and fear nobody’; ‘Right’s right and wrong’s no man’s right’; ‘Tell the truth and shame the devil’ and ‘Honesty is the best policy’”\n\nWe can also see in the census returns a clear contrast between the different dissenting congregations. At the time of the census, the Independents were the most numerous, while the Quakers were in decline. The Wesleyan Methodists in East Adderbury were well established, in their first small chapel in Chapel Lane, but had not yet made the strides which allowed them by the end of the century to build a much larger church on the High Street itself.\n\nOn from 1851\n\nOn the Anglican side, it is sometimes said that the growth of dissent and the relative weakness of the numbers attending Anglican worship could be attributed to a failure in the first half of the nineteenth century to meet the needs for regular services and pastoral support for all parts of the parish. After 1851 the main developments seem to have been intended to address such issues. In Bodicote, after restoration of the parish church in 1854, Bodicote was made into a separate parish in 1855. A new church was built in Milton in 1856-7 and consecrated in 1857. Change at Barford St John, however, had to wait until 1890, when it was annexed to Barford St Michael.\n\nOn the dissenting side, there were a number of national developments, which have been summarised as follows:\n\n“The nineteenth century witnessed a very gradual easing of the legislation which had continued to restrict nonconformists. Laws which excluded all but practising Anglicans from government and municipal posts were repealed in 1828-9, and in 1871 it became illegal to debar Nonconformists from teaching or studying in English universities. Unitarians gained freedom of worship in 1813 and the Dissenters’ Chapels Act (of 1844) effectively secured for them those chapels in which they had worshipped for the past twenty-five years. After 1836 Nonconformists had the right to conduct marriage ceremonies and in 1880 they were granted the right to conduct burial services in parish churchyards.” Wakeling (2016), p.4.\n\nThe Independent Chapel in West Adderbury continued in existence. It was registered as a place of worship for marriage 1854-60. The adjoining manse was pulled down in 1870, perhaps because the chapel had by that time had two honorary pastors, retired men with homes elsewhere; the manse was replaced with a school. The chapel closed in 1955 and was sold in 1957.\n\nDespite continuing problems over the financing of their 1810 chapel, the Wesleyan Methodists of East Adderbury founded a much larger church at the junction of Chapel Lane and the High Street accommodating 130 and featuring an attached School Room. Ashbridge (2004) suggests that the members wished to “build a new chapel in the centre of the village and remain no longer in the background” (p.16). This was opened in 1893 and thanks to generous donations was able to begin its life unencumbered with debt (Allen, 1995, p.19). The Methodist Church continues to flourish.\n\nDespite the relatively large number recorded at the Milton Methodist Chapel, it would appear that this nonconformist congregation was absorbed into the corresponding chapel at Bloxham, with whom it shared a pastor. The chapel building was used by the Church of England until their new church was built.\n\nThe single exception to the generally optimistic picture for dissenting congregations is that of the Quakers, where the number of worshippers at the Adderbury Meeting House had fallen to an average of 12 at the time of the census. This mirrored a national decline: while the population of England trebled between 1715 and 1851, the number of Quaker adherents had more than halved. The Quakers came to acknowledge that the rules which effectively prevented Friends from marrying outside the Quaker community were a major cause of the decline. An 1859 report, quoted in Thompson, 1972, pp 163-65, says that “Within … the present century, the Society of Friends in England has disowned nearly one third of all its members who have married, a total of not less than four thousand persons”. It was also believed that a general movement away from the land had affected the Quakers disproportionately. An 1806 report said “Almost all the Quakers were originally in the country … but this order of things is reversing fast. They are flocking into the towns and abandoning agricultural pursuits.” At Adderbury the decline in numbers continued: they were down to 4 by 1909 and the Meeting House closed in 1914.\n\nPhil Mansell\n\n2020\n\nReferences:\n\nAshbridge, P.

Historic England.\n\nFor a short period in the 1970s Adderbury played a role in international affairs. Government drivers delivered ministerial red boxes requiring decisions on topics such as the terms of an International Monetary Fund loan to the UK, yet another attempt to find a solution to the Rhodesia problem, the Cod War and the UK presidency of what was then known as the EEC.\n\nAll this because Anthony Crosland and his wife Susan had bought the mill on Mill Lane in Adderbury as their “country cottage”. And for part of their time together in Adderbury, Crosland, a senior Labour politician, was Foreign Secretary.\n\nThe Croslands had had the idea of a “country retreat” in mind for some years. What attracted them to Adderbury in the first place is unknown; although North Oxfordshire as an area to search may have suggested itself because of the presence at Prescote Manor near Cropredy of Labour backbench stalwart Richard Crossman. Certainly the Croslands stayed with the Crossmans when they first came to see the Mill. Susan Crosland said they just followed up an estate agent’s advertisement. At all events, it seems to have been love at first sight: according to Susan Crosland in her 1982 biography of her husband, Crosland said later the first evening: “As soon as I saw it, my heart turned over”. The Croslands failed to secure the mill on this occasion, but were successful when it came onto the market again two years later, in 1975.\n\nWhat the Croslands were looking for was somewhere they could be alone together as much as possible in their busy lives. He was in demand as the author of The Future of Socialism (1956), which has been described as “the most important theoretical treatise to be written from the moderate left of British politics in the first twenty-five post-war years” (Roy Jenkins), as a government minister and as a constituency MP (for Grimsby) and during times when attendance at House of Commons votes was an additional necessity. She was equally busy as a successful journalist who came to specialise in celebrity interviews for the national press, writing under the pen name “Susan Barnes”. Her profiles included ones of Barbara Cartland, Margot Fonteyn, Kenneth Tynan, Kingsley Amis and Jack Jones. Anthony Crosland and Susan Catling (as she then was) had met in 1956 and married in 1964. It was a second marriage for both, and Susan had two daughters from her previous marriage.\n\nAdderbury came to symbolise their marriage to quite a surprising extent. This is clear from the following passage describing one visit to Adderbury in 1976 taken from Susan Crosland’s biography of her husband:\n\n“From the sitting-room we could see the brook, brown and swollen, rushing self-importantly past the bottom of the garden, spilling over into the garden. ‘Think I like Adderbury best of all in winter,’ [Tony] said. ‘Gives an even greater sense of being alone together.’”\n\nIn the short period they had owned it, their house in Adderbury had seen both disaster and subsequent triumph in Anthony Crosland’s political life. When they bought the mill, in 1975, Anthony Crosland was Secretary of State for the Environment, but in 1976 came the Labour Party leadership election which followed Harold Wilson’s resignation. Although his friends and supporters advised him against it, Crosland decided to put himself forward as a candidate, suggesting that he would “draw support from the common ground which unites Left and Right”, although with little hope of success. Interestingly, he said that he felt “I could get through the public humiliation because I have a happy marriage and we have just bought a country cottage”.\n\nIn the event, Crosland came bottom of the poll and was eliminated on the first round. Yet within weeks he was appointed Foreign Secretary by the incoming Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan, and the press was suggesting that this was just a prelude to the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer which had always attracted him and which, in turn, could lead to even higher things.\n\nSusan Crosland came into her own as she accompanied her husband abroad (paying her own way in economy with Crosland popping through bearing glasses of champagne). One of the few concessions she made to being a minister’s wife was that she stopped dyeing her hair pink. The highlight for her of Crosland’s nine months as Foreign Secretary was the Queen’s Bicentennial visit to the United States. The Croslands went over on the Royal yacht Britannia, with the Queen showing her how to stand for hours without tiring. At the embassy dinner in Washington for President Ford, she fell and broke her jaw – which was set by presidential surgeons.\n\nDuring Crosland’s time as Foreign Secretary, it wasn’t just red boxes that came to Adderbury. Dignitaries visited as well, none more exalted than Dr Henry Kissinger, the US Secretary of State. After initial awkwardness, Crosland and Kissinger came to have quite a close relationship. Two stories are told in the village about Dr Kissinger. The first concerns food: Kissinger was apparently very fond of onion soup made from especially sweet onions grown in the Croslands’ Adderbury garden, as well as of dishes made from their rhubarb (known thereafter as “Kissinger’s Rhubarb”). The other story concerns the Adderbury Scout troop, who on one occasion had their night exercises rudely interrupted by the armed security men who were guarding Kissinger.\n\nThe Crosland’s life together in their Adderbury weekend retreat was not to last for long. On Saturday, 12th February 1977, the day after their thirteenth wedding anniversary, Anthony Crosland suffered a major stroke. Susan Crosland’s account of events is as follows:\n\n“When [Tony] returned from his morning walk it was long past noon. I was in the courtyard when he came striding down the lane, swinging his arms …. “Adderbury is an absolutely ravishing village. This is an ‘ultimate’ weekend,” he said.\n\nTwenty minutes later we were having a belated mid-morning coffee, he working on Rhodesia papers. He had to refill his pen from the bottle in my desk, always grumbled about this task. “Are you sure pens used to run out this soon?” he said, returning to his chair. I was at the table in the window and had just started a letter to Sheila. “Something has happened,” he said.\n\nBecause he often mimed to entertain me, spoke in a solemn voice about things trivial, as I turned in my chair I imagined ink from the newly-filled pen had leaked onto something quite unimportant. [His secretary] said later how strange it was to see on the Rhodesia papers where the pen had stopped in mid-letter. “I can’t feel my right side,’ Tony said.””\n\nFive days later Anthony Crosland died in the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford. His ashes were later scattered by Susan Crosland in the sea off Grimsby, where Crosland had been the popular and successful MP. As David Owen, then a Junior Minister at the Foreign Office, said at the time: “His lifestyle, the long hours, good food, little exercise, alcohol and cigars could not have helped.”\n\nSusan Crosland continued to visit Adderbury at weekends for just over twenty years after her husband’s death, receiving help from villagers with the garden and with the management of the sluice gate at the Old Mill. In 1982 she published her biography of Crosland, with the Preface written from Adderbury. This has been described as the outstanding inside portrait of what it was to be a leading politician in the second half of the twentieth century and of what it was to be his devoted supporter, wife, and lover. Thereafter, according to a friend, “though Susan Crosland lived for thirty-four years after Tony died, her grief never left her. Consequently her career did not hit its former heights”. Neither collections of her celebrity interviews, nor a series of what were known at the time as “airport novels” were particularly successful. She also suffered from ill health. She sold the mill in 1998, and on 26 February 2011 she died of pneumonia at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after a short illness. She was survived by her first husband and the two daughters from her first marriage.\n\nJack Donaldson, (later to become Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge), who was Minister of Arts in the Wilson and Callaghan governments, and hence a cabinet colleague of Anthony Crosland,, said the following about the marriage of Anthony and Susan Crosland at the Service of Thanksgiving for Anthony Crosland, held at Westminster Abbey on 7th March 1977:\n\n“… the thing which perhaps no one understood or allowed for was his capacity to love. Those of us who knew him well were not surprised when he found someone with whom he could settle down and mature … No, what surprised us was the ease and simplicity with which he slipped into the roles of husband, of step-father, and of head of the family. If he had not met Susan Barnes all this might never have been revealed and he might never have fulfilled his potential. But it was a marriage of two equals and he gave to it as much as he received.”\n\nPhil Mansell\n\n2020\n\nSources:\n\nCrosland, S. (1982): Tony Crosland. Coronet Books.\n\nJeffreys, K.
