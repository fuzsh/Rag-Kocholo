The company had become part of the joint \"Shell-Mex and BP\" company in 1957 and in the year this map was issued the benzole side of the business was hived off, no longer used as a fuel additive, and the brand would drop the 'benzole' from the title.

These were designed by Calvert and Kinneir under the auspices of the Anderson Committee. Within a few years the Worboys Committee would undertake a complete review of all UK road signs and again designs by Calvert and Kinneir would be adopted replacing those seen here.",
