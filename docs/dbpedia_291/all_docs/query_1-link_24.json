It was called\n\nLes Aventures des Schtroumpfs and consisted of 5 black-and-white shorts made for television.\n\nSmurfnapped, The smurfs and the magic Egg, The black smurf, The smurfs and the Dragon, The flying smurf.\n\nIn 1965 TVA Dupuis made this short also, but I do not think it was in the first movie. Le Faux Schtroumpf.\n\nBetween October 1967 and May 1968 dutch TV KRO showed 9 episodes of smurf shorts.\n\nProbably made by TVA Dupuis. In the small booklet given away when you bought BP smurfs\n\nin Holland in 1969 they mention that the smurfs were known from TV by children.\n\nUitzenddatum Nr.

It is said that Stuart R Ross travelled in Belgium in 1976 and came across the\n\nsmurfs. He then made an agreement with Dupuis and Peyo for the rights for the smurfs in\n\nNorth America.\n\nIt was first released in October in 1976 i Belgium but not until November 1983 in the US.\n\n1978 UK National Benzole\n\nIn 1978 when National Benzole started selling smurf merchandise a lot of shorts were made.\n\n1979\n\nBP answer this when it comes to choosing animators in 1979.\n\n1979 Australia\n\n1981 Hanna Barbera and NBC\n\nFrom september 1981 to december 1989. 256 episodes and 418 stories!!\n\n2011 Sony Pictures Animation\n\nSony Pictures Animation obtained the rights to make a smurf movie in 2008.\n\nThe new smurfs from Schleich in 2009 were moviesmurfs and all smurf fans were hoping\n\nfor a new movie soon.
