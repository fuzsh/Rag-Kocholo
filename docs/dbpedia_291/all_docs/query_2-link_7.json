In the company’s early years, benzol (mix of toluene &amp; benzene) was a by-product of gas production from coal and in surplus supply. It was known to improve the performance of internal combustion engines when added to the fuel, hence the word <i>Benzol</i> in the company name.\n\t\n\tInitially the company used pure benzol and this was later a 50/50 mix with petrol. After the war ended in 1945, the proportions of benzol to petrol were reduced and by 1958, benzol was considered a hazardous compound and phased out altogether by the early 1960’s.
