        "text": "Riddlesworth means the settlement by the reeds; it is a village in the extreme south of the county of Norfolk, overlooking the reed beds that used to skirt the river Waveney. It has an impressive Hall; indeed there is nothing to the village but the the hall and its former estate farms and cottages. The existing building is third hall to have been built on the site or nearby. The church, which is also incorporated into the estate, is a small one, with no side aisles and an insignificant chancel of relatively recent date. Originally it had no tower, but by the fifteenth century it had acquired the tower which remains today.\n\nThe first hall was built in the Jacobethan style by Sir Dru Drury (c.1531 – 1617), who acquired the manor of Riddlesworth through his marriage to the Norfolk heiress Catherine Finch. He had been one of the two courtiers who had Mary Queen of Scots under his guardianship at Fotheringay Castle. He was one of the witnesses to her execution. His elaborately sculptured wall tomb stands on the north wall of the church. It shows Sir Dru kneeling in prayer, flanked by angels. Similarly designed tombs exist in Oxford Cathedral and near Aylsham in Norfolk. His son, also called Dru, inherited a considerable fortune upon his father’s death. However this Drury never became as prominent in national affairs as his father. However he was returned as knight of the shire for Norfolk in 1621. Drury was elected for Thetford as the junior member of its two MPs. This Drury died on 23 Apr 1632.\n\nRiddlesworth passed to his only surviving son, William Drury. No other member of the family sat in Parliament. In 1703 a female member of the Drury family and her servant were killed by a falling chimney as they lay in bed. That was in the Great Storm of November in that year. The Hall remained in the family into the late18th century, when it was acquired by Sylvanus Bevan the “Banker”. He hated his name, and left instructions in his will that no subsequent members of his family should ever be called Sylvanus. He rebuilt the Hall to the design of Thomas Leverton, establishing a brickworks to the south of Riddlesworth in the process.\n\nIt then became home to the Thorneycrofts who sold it to the Champions and their descendants, who held it well into the twentieth century. The Hall burnt down in the last years of the nineteenth century and was rebuilt on the old foundations.\n\nThe HALL became a school during the Second World War, when it became the wartime home of the Felixstowe Ladies’ College. Then in 1946 it was converted into a Prep School for girls. Its most famous pupil was Diana Spencer, later better know as Princess of Wales. The school closed its doors in April 2023. It was put up for sale, inviting offers of over £3 million.\n\nDuring the war an army camp was set up in Riddleworth Park, and in 1946 this was converted in a resettlement camp for Polish soldiers who did not want to return to the Communist controlled country. They became integrated into the Norfolk community.\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE HISTORY OF NORFOLK\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\nRate this:\n\nHubert Howells was born in the last decade of Queen Victoria’s long reign. His father earned a precarious living as a painter and decorator in Gloucestershire. He was brought up as a Baptist, but showing early musical ability he joined the choir of his local parish church. When he was eleven his father filed for bankruptcy, which was a deeply upsetting experience for the whole family, Hubert included. His musical studies were however supported by Lord Bledisloe, who had recognised the boy’s talent. Aged sixteen he was taken on as articled pupil by the organist at Gloucester Cathedral.\n\nHe had had an enjoyable experience with a number of other budding composers as a pupil at the Royal College of Music in London. He was not conscripted to fight in the First World War, as he was suffering from distressing autoimmune disease; uncomfortable this may have been, but it saved him from the trenches in France. He went on briefly to be organist at Salisbury Cathedral before turning to editing Tudor church music. He married in 1920 and had two children, Ursula and Michael. Michael’s death at the age of nine made a profound impression on the composer, and it was sadness that he was never able entirely to shake off.\n\nHUBERT HOWELLS\n\nOn Thursday the 16th of November this year I attended a concert of Howells at Norwich Cathedral. It was given by the BBC Singers, a group that produces some of the best vocal music in the country. The presenter was Ed Balls (b. 1967), a former senior Labour politician and husband of Yvette Cooper, currently Shadow Home Secretary. He is the uncle of a friend of our son Peter, whom he met at Norwich School. She is now married to another former Norwich School pupil who is an engineer at Lotus Cars. Ed Balls was born in Bawburgh near Norwich, where he lived until he was eight years old. He was a keen musician and played the violin while studying at Nottingham Grammar School. He was obviously intent on a political career from an early age, as he went to Oxford University (Keble College) where he read PPE (Politics, Philosophy and Economics). This is the most prolific route into politics for young people in Britain. Coming from an Anglican family, he first became acquainted with the music of Howells at evensong in Keble College chapel. Since his retirement from frontline politic he has become increasingly involved with Norwich affairs. Besides his involvement with cathedral music he has been regularly associated with Norwich City Football Club.\n\nThe concert was one of a series arranged to celebrate the restoration of the cathedral organ, the first for over 80 years. Although mostly consisting of choral music, there were also two pieces of solo organ music by Hubert Howells in the concert. The performance was recorded for later transmission on BBC Radio 3. The appearance of Ed Balls meant the concert was covered on Radio 4 lunchtime news the next day. The concert will be repeated in London at St Martin in the Fields. For the first time in public Ed Balls conducted two of the choral pieces. A pleasant story goes with one of these; Ted Heath was a good musician, and while studying at Balliol College Oxford (another PPE student!) he won the position of Organ Scholar at the college. As such he was taught by Howells, who, knowing of his intention to enter politics, said if he ever became Prime Minister he would write him a piece of music. As we all know, Heath did indeed become PM, and Howells wrote him A Grace for Number Ten Downing Street in 1972. It was sung there in the presence of the Queen Mother. I know the QM was partial to a glass of gin, but as to her opinion of modern choral music I am at loss to say. I hope she enjoyed it.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE STORY OF NORFOLK\n\nRate this:\n\nThe motto of Bury St Edmunds is ‘Shrine of a King, Cradle of the Law’. The latter phrase refers to the fact that in 1214 rebel English barons held a secret meeting before going off to confront King John with the Charter of Liberties, the forerunner of the Magna Carta. What is this to do with St Edmund? It was on his feast day, November the 0th, that this meeting took place. This was not a coincidence. The idea of the nation having a Patron Saint had not then taken hold, but in several ways he was the forerunner of St George as the national figurehead. The life of St Edmund makes him in one crucial respect a much better candidate for that role – he was an Englishman. In contrast the Greek George was alive before the country of England even existed. Edmund’s life story prior to his death was lost when the victorious Vikings took over the kingdom and records were destroyed; his history is murky. So too is the legend of St George; it is is the stuff of speculation and invention. But at least the tale of St Edmund only involves a believable wolf, not a mythical dragon.\n\nSt Edmund was put to death on this day in the year 869, after a principled stand against his Viking captors. The story seized the imagination of the local East Anglians, but it is doubtful if would have reached a wide audience had it not been for the account of The Passion of St Edmund, written by the monk Abbo of Fleury.\n\nSt Edmunds Day does not appear in the official list of major Catholic Saints, although he is included among the minor ones. The 20th of November is devoted to, among others, St Felix of Valois (one of the founders of the Trinitarian movement in the 12th century). He renounced his possessions and retired to a densely forested part of the country near Valois, where he gave himself to prayer and contemplation. John of Matha, a young nobleman of Provence, heard of the holy hermit and sought him out. He put himself under his direction and proposed that together they founded an order for the redemption of captives. Felix, though seventy years of age, agreed and together they set off for Rome to see the Pope.\n\nPope Innocent III agreed slightly reluctantly, and appointed John of Matha superior-general of the new order. The Pope commissioned the Bishop of Paris and the Abbot of Saint Victor to draw up the rule of the Order. Felix returned to France to establish the Order there. He was received with great enthusiasm, which extended to the king himself. He was donated 20 acres of woodland where he had earlier built his hermitage. There he erected the monastery that became the Motherhouse of the Trinitarians. John of Matha was left in Italy and founded monasteries there, while Felix remained in France to look after the interests of the local congregations. He founded another monastic house in the capital, Paris. Felix died amongst his fellow Trinitarians in 1212. Although he is said to have died on the 4th of November, his feast day is November the 20th.\n\nHere is a list of some of the things that have occurred in the past forty years on this day, the 20th of November. 1990 was the beginning of the end for MARGARET THATCHER, who failed to win an outright victory in the leadership vote of the Parliamentary Conservative Party. In 1992 fire broke out in Windsor Castle, badly damaging the fabric and causing over £50 million worth of damage. In 1997 the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. In 20012 a typewriter, the last one to be built in the UK, was produced at a North Wales factory.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\nTHE STORY OF THE PAST\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nRate this:\n\nAlthough there have been architecturally significant buildings erected for many hundreds of years throughout Europe, the profession of architect is a phenomenon of the modern era. Prior to the seventeenth century, when gentlemen became involved in planning and the design of buildings, the task of erecting all kinds of structures (both those of a practical and an aesthetic nature) had been left to artisans. The great buildings of the medieval era had mostly been ecclesiastical structures, but some military ones (forts and castles) also survive. The different requirements of the two branches of architecture produced very different styles.\n\nThe great age of church building was already running out of steam, even before the Reformation called a halt to this form of architecture. Very few new churches were built between the fifteenth and the nineteenth century, although among them were some in Norfolk. The construction of castles had ended after the Norman period saw a spurt of energetic military construction, and the perceived need to defend towns with walls was no longer a consideration by the end of the 15th century; the larger towns and cities already had their walls, and the population was no longer regarded as dangerous.\n\nThe architectural profession advanced from two directions, above and below; from the upper strata of society the connoisseur deigned to involve himself with the dirty job of actually overseeing the tradesmen, while the carpenters and bricklayers began to learn the classical principals that shaped their work. Below is a list of some of the most important figures in the history of local buildings.\n\nSIR ROGER PRATT, (1620-1685). He was one of the most important English architects of the 17th century (not jut locally). His friends included Sir Christopher Wren and Inigo Jones. His houses at Ryston in Norfolk and Clarendon House in London were the most influential of the time. He built his own home at Ryston Hall in 1689-72. It remains, though altered by John Soane and Anthony Salvin.\n\nHENRY BELL, (1647-1711). Bell was a King’s Lynn merchant; not exactly a gentleman, but not an artisan either. Having reconstructed much of Northampton after the fire of 1675, his Norfolk works are all in the King’s Lynn area. The Customs House of 1683 was designed as a merchants’ exchange. He also rebuilt North Runcton church in 1713 after its collapse.\n\nMATTHEW BRETTINGHAM, (1699-1769). AN early 18th century Norwich-based architect, Brettingham began life as a bricklayer, apprenticed to his father. He was therefore a true artisan-builder. In charge of the building of Holkham Hall, to the designs of William Kemp in 1734-64, he probably designed the Doric temple at Blickling Hall. In the 1740s he altered the façade of Norwich cathedral and in 1742-6 rebuilt the nave of St Margaret’s church at King’s Lynn. He was responsible for the older section (1742) of Gunton Hall and Hanworth Hall of 1743.\n\nTHOMAS IVORY, 1709-1791). Unlike Pratt and Bell, Ivory too was a reversion to the artisan-builder. A Norwich timber merchant, he developed his architectural skills on the job. He is best known for the Octagon Chapel of 1746, also he remodelled the Assembly House (1755). He designed the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital of 1771 in St Stevens Road. He also designed Ivory House (in All Saints Green) and a number of Norwich town houses including the terrace 29-35 Surrey Street.\n\nWILLIAM DONTHORN, (1799-1859). Swaffham born, Donthorn was trained under Jeffrey Wyatville, and was noted for his Italianate mansions and his Tudor Gothic-style houses. Time has not been kind to him as few of his buildings survive. The Gothic Hillington Hall has gone, as have all his workhouses, and the Greek Pickenham Hall. A small cottage at the crossroads east of the present Hall was recognised as his work in recent years, and has been restored. The Old Rectory at Great Moulton, constructed in 1832 in Italian style, also survives, and Cromer Hall of 1829. The stable block of 1831 at Felbrigg Hall is another of his buildings. The Coke Column at Holkham is his most impressive piece of work.\n\nJOHN BROWN, (1805-1876). He was Surveyor of Norwich Cathedral Diocese and as such he was responsible for the rebuilding of 25 churches in Norfolk. He also built a number of workhouses. He was probably the designer of St James’s Mill in Norwich, which still stands out in that part of the City.\n\nEDWARD BOARDMAN, (1833-1910). The most prominent Norfolk architect of the 19th century, Boardman was responsible for much activity in Norwich. As the revival of church architecture gathered speed he restored Anglican churches and built nonconformist chapels including the Methodist Chapel-in-the-Field.\n\nGEORGE SKIPPER (1856-1948). Born at East Dereham, Skipper was a brilliant architect of the Edwardian era. Famous for his Norwich buildings such as the Marble Hall, the HQ of AVIVA (1904). It was constructed with stone originally intended for the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral, and is arguably the finest Edwardian Baroque structure in Britain; the Royal Arcade of 1899 is a unique blend of coloured tiles. Cromer’s former town hall is built to his design.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE STORY OF NORFOLK\n\nRate this:\n\nThis central pub in Costessey had been called the White Hart since the seventeenth century, and probably before that. In 2009 it close for refurbishment, and in 2011 it reopened as the Harte. It also started serving meals. The current building dates from 1931, when it was rebuilt in the Mock Tudor style of the period – this means it has the appearance of half-timbered construction, although beneath the surface it is convention brick. This retrospective style of architecture had been popular since the nineteenth century, but was soon to disappear. The Second World War was followed by a more uncompromisingly modern technique. Although I worked for years at the Post Office, when it was just across the road, I had never been there until recently; now it is a regular place where we go for lunch. Molly and I normally have the prawn sandwich, which with chips and salad garnish makes just the right sized repast.\n\nBefore its closure for rebuilding in 1930 the pub was a late Georgian style building. It had been built at the behest of one John Burgess, who in 1830 was a successful businessman who was busy buying property in Costessey. Besides the pub he owned several cottages. He worked in Taverham, but there all the land was controlled by the squire, and none was available for purchase. The landlord who ran it for him was called John Miller.\n\nWe do not know what the earlier White Hart looked like, though its position was more or less the same. In 1778 Parson Woodforde walked over from Weston Longville to the pub to see a woman who was selling buttons and lace while staying there. That was not the reason he went (though he did buy some items from her). No, her fame was the fact that she had fought as a combatant in the Royal Marines for several years, without her sex being discovered. When eventually her identity became known her resulting notoriety gave her a fame that could be used to provide her with a reliable source of income.\n\nHannah Snell was her maiden name, and she was born in Worcester on 23 April 1723. At the age of 17 she moved to London where she married a Dutchman. Her husband abandoned her while she was pregnant, and she later found out that he had committed a murder, for which he was hanged. He was a bad lot in short. After her young daughter died she made a daring move; she enlisted in the Royal Marines on the sloop-of-war HMS Swallow at Portsmouth. She served in India, where she was injured, being shot in the groin. She got a local woman to remove the bullet and keep her sex secret. On her return to England however she revealed her true identity to her shipmates. She was persuaded to petition the Head of the Army to secure a soldier’s pension, which she did. She became quite a celebrity, having the story of her exploits written about in the Gentleman’s Magazine and elsewhere. A chapbook (i.e. a cheap popular pamphlet) entitled The Female Soldier was published in 1750 and ran to two editions. Her portrait was painted several times and engravings of her in military uniform were widely published.\n\nIn 1869 the pub was taken over by James Yallop who, it is recorded, was a breeder of Norwich canaries. This was when Norwich earned its reputation as the city for these colourful birds. Canaries had been introduced to the city by the “Strangers” from the Low Countries, and by the 1860s local breeders had discovered how to enhance the colour of their plumage from yellow to brilliant orange by feeding the birds with hot Natal pepper. Nowadays other spices are used. Of course everybody now thinks of the Norwich City Football Club when speaking the Norwich Canaries, but this name is a relatively recent phenomenon. Back in the early years of the 20th century the team was known not as the Canaries, but as the Norwich Citizens.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE STORY OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:\n\nThe weather was getting colder in November 1981, with overnight frosts. M. TEXIER continued to be an excellent customer; he wanted a further 6 magnifiers this month. I also got a magnifier order from Whitby Hospital – obviously Bill’s doing. We had an order from Lotus Cars at the end of the month, and one from Zimbabwe. I had an order for some magnifiers from a glass engraver, who needs them for her students.\n\nI was having large breakfasts, provided by my sister; porage, sausages and potato cakes one morning, sprats, toast and marmalade and porage the next. Tig served the porage on a plate rather than in a bowl. We were eating rather opulent scale and consuming unusual meals; “cerf en Suisse” for example. Translated into English this meant we were eating a Swiss stag. Later in the week we dined on rabbit stew. I thought rye bread was a recent discovery of mine, but I was having Danish rye bread with salami all those years ago. With all this food maybe I was putting on weight?\n\nApparently Culford school have sent their video camera away to be mended, and David phoned us up to get us to collect it. I had been getting up early to put in an hour’s double bass practice before work. I was already getting interested in auction sales, and so I went round on preview days. I intended to buying interesting things, particularly anything musical. I must have had an eye for this, because I was paid £5.60 for sending some sheet music to a customer in Germany.\n\nI kept getting cheques that hadn’t been signed – very frustrating, although they were always signed in the end. Guy Fawkes came and went with out a mention from me in my diary; likewise I did not observe Remembrance Sunday either. I did get an invitation to the Carol Supper from Marie at Forncett. This was a memorable occasion, which I will mention in due course.\n\nOn the 13th I was woken up at 8 a.m. by a phone call from Canada (where it was still last night). It was my sister; I got my other sister Tiggy to talk to her in the cold, while I was snug and warm in my bed! I heard that the poor thing has been having a difficult time in Canada; one of her sons has got into a bit of trouble by joining a gang. The teenage years are difficult at the best of times, when children may go off the rails somewhat. Today you would never believe that such a pillar of the community had passed through a controversial stage.\n\nTiggy was busy arranging a trip to London for her Girl Guides; my travels were a little more pedestrian. I just busied myself with making a flagpole for the Guides flag. During the week I repaired a man’s barometer which he presented me with. I have no idea now what this entailed, but he must have been satisfied with what I did because he gave £5 for my trouble. I often wonder if these repairs stood the test of time, but I never got any negative feedback so they must have done. Fido has a cough, so I phoned the vet and arranged to take him in.\n\nI had a phone call to say that a Dutchman had demolished ten feet of our garden wall with his lorry. He phoned in the evening to apologise, and to tell me that he would be round at the weekend with a bricklayer to build it up again. If only all people who damaged my property were so accommodating. I suppose it is just as well that Graham was there next door, to give him my phone number. It wasn’t the first time someone had smashed into the wall, but I think it was first time that the culprit had repaired it. I couldn’t watch The News at Ten because the newscasters were on strike!\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF EAST ANGLIAN LIFE\n\nRate this:\n\nThe hall was built for Sir Edmund Bedingfeld; he was granted the licence to crenellate it in 1482. It is a medieval style manor House, facing inwards towards a courtyard. It is not however (despite its crenellations) a particularly well defended one, apart from its moat. In the opinion of some people the middle ages ended in 1485, so Oxburgh Hall is perhaps better characterised as a very early modern structure. Its crenallations only extend to a few battlements around the gatehouse towers, and were obviously never intended to be used by soldiers to defend the hall. They are merely decorative.\n\nThings progressed without major incident until the 1530s, when King Henry VIII wanted a divorce. The Pope refused to grant this, which led to the church in England becoming separated from the Church of Rome. This was to cause problems for the Bedingfeld family, as they were staunch Roman Catholics. There is “priest’s hole” in the property, where family’s Catholic chaplain could hide from the Protestant authorities, who would call at the property and try to search him out.\n\nThe Hall and its estate went through various ups and downs until the Second World War. In 1950 the whole estate was auctioned off in lots by the head of the family. The Hall faced imminent demolition in 1951, but was saved by Sybil, Lady Bedingfeld, her daughter and niece, who raised enough funds to buy Oxburgh Hall back. They then donated it to the National Trust in the following year. It has recently undergone a major restoration, including a thorough job or retiling the roof. Members of the family still live in private apartments at Oxburgh Hall today.\n\nThe Drawing Room reveals reveals the new discovered 18th-century Jacobite glass, with its cryptic symbols. The Jacobites were supporters of the exiles Catholic Stuart king during the 18th century, and the 3rd Baronet was said to be a secret member.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF NORFOLK\n\nRate this:\n\nThe station was built in 1845 in the burst of activity that heralded the heyday of the Victorian era. This attractive building was styled in the Italianate manner. In that year it was just a stop on the line to Norwich from London, and the station was briefly not a junction. That soon changed. In 1846 the line to Kings Lynn provided the first junction when the line was extended to the north, and the following year the line to Peterborough added a junction to the north west. In 1866 the Ely to Sutton railway was opened to the south west, and in 1878 this line was extended to St Ives. The route was closed in 1964. To the south east the junction of the line to Ipswich via Bury St Edmunds was opened in1880. The sidings just to the south of the junction with the Breckland line to Norwich form a major depot for building materials. With such a complicated arrangement it is no wonder that the junction needs urgent additions and modifications, as the demand for extra train services is constantly growing.\n\nEven with the proposed improvements, expected to cost over half a billion pounds, the proposed increase in passenger trains is relatively modest. At present there is one train per hour on the electrified mainline from Kings Lynn to London; under the updated system this will be increased to two trains per hour. There is one train per hour from Norwich to Liverpool via Peterborough with the East Midlands, and this will remain the same. Similarly the trains from Norwich and Birmingham to Stanstead airport (currently one per hour from each departure) will be unaffected. To the south the frequency of the service from Ipswich will rise from one every two hours to one every hour. Bear in mind that these figures must be doubled to account for the return journeys. The increase in freight trains is touted as a major benefit of this upgrade, but again the increase is modest. How I managed find a ‘special’ ‘ to ride through Ely in 1977 I do not know; the number of destinations was probably less (there was then no Stanstead station to serve), though trains still went through Ely and Cambridge en route from Norwich to London Liverpool Street. Kings Cross was not then the terminus for trains from Kings Lynn.\n\nIn short the off peak service at ELY STATION will increase from six passenger trains per hour to ten, while freight will double to two trains per hour. Presumably peak time services are more densely provided, though as freight is nor subject to peak demand I assume that these trains are reduced in frequency to allow for additional passenger traffic.\n\nIn spite of this minor increase in trains, I understand that an extra platform will be needed at Ely. The layout of tracks to the station will be modernised with either a longer platform or an additional island. The picture shows the general extent of the various junctions at Ely, but it does not show the extent of double and single track lines, so it is not clear from this what needs to be done. The current alignment of tracks is congested; for example the two tracks that go east to Norwich are reduced to a single track as it approaches the junction. In the same way the double track line from Bury St Edmunds is reduced to a single track across Hawk’s Bridge, although there is the space to return it to double track at some time in the future.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF EAST ANGLIAN LIFE\n\nRate this:\n\nALL SAINTS’ DAY is the 1st of November, so Halloween (the eve of All Saints Day) falls on the 31st of October. (ALL SOULS’ DAY is the 2nd of November.) This was a popular festival in the Catholic Church, falling as it does in an increasingly cold and dull time of year. This remained a much loved celebration in spite of the Reformation, when Catholic forms of worship were increasingly frowned upon. This was particularly true of Ireland, where the feast day of All Saints remained an annual event, as the Irish stayed resolutely Catholic. In Scotland too the celebration of Halloween persisted, despite the the Presbyterian system of church governance that played a deadening effect on all forms of outward show in religious practice. This attachment to Halloween was particularly true in the Highlands, where Catholicism persisted longer than the more radically Protestant Lowlands.\n\nAmong the earliest settlers in North America the celebration of Halloween was not feature of their Puritan religion. Whereas it still held sway among those less than wholly committed Protestants who stayed in the old country, it played no part in the make-up of the pre-independence American people; why then did Halloween become such a feature of the contemporary USA? The answer lies in the numbers of Irish who, after potato famine, emigrated to the USA. The Scots did the same following the Highland Clearances; they brought Halloween with them to the New World.\n\nMeanwhile things were happening in the political firmament south of the border in England; as I Implied earlier, Halloween was more popular as a good old knees-up, rather than as a Holy occasion for the remembrance of the departed saints. It was a time for partying and lighting bonfires in the gloom. On the 5th of November 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to blow up Parliament. This was only days after Halloween, and the rejoicing that resulted from its failure immediately took the place of Halloween in popular culture. This suited those in charge, who could replace a Roman Catholic festival with an anti-Catholic one; Guy Fawkes and his co-conspirators were Catholics who hoped to start a violent revolution that would return the country to Roman conformity. The common people did not so much mind about the justification for the the conviviality, so long as it resulted in junketing and high jinks.\n\nNow, with the increasing fashion for all things American, the celebration of Halloween has largely displaced Guy Fawkes from the minds of the young. I doubt that many of them know anything of the history of the Gunpowder Plot, and were it not for the letting off of fireworks (which has not attached itself to Halloween) it would already have disappeared into the misty past. The old rhyme has it that the 5th of November ‘should never be forgot’; I wonder how much longer it will be remembered.\n\nOne thing clearly demonstrates the connection between Halloween and Guy Fawkes, and this concerns the pumpkin. When I was a child we did not have any pumpkins, but we had turnips. These would be turned into turnip lanterns. Turnips were much larger vegetables than they have since become (if you can get them at all). These turnips were huge; hung up with faces carved into them and a candle placed inside they provided a spooky flickering backdrop to the Guy Fawkes bonfire. This tradition must have gone back to the distant past, older even than the exploding fireworks and into the era of medieval Halloween. When Halloween made it across the pond to North America it took with it the tradition of making lanterns, but it was not turnips that were turned into lanterns but that local fruit, the pumpkin. So there you have a definite correlation between the two celebrations!\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF NORFOLK\n\nRate this:\n\nThis is is the smallest plot if land in the National Trust’s expansive portfolio. This stone marks the spot where a duel was fought between Sir Henry Hobart, 4th Baronet, and Oliver Le Neve. This took place on the 21st of August 1698. Sir Henry died as a result. It is recorded in the National Trust’s website as part of the Blickling estate. Blickling Hall was the residence of Sir Henry, and Oliver Le Neve lived at Great Witchingham Hall; no doubt Cawston was selected as half-way between the two places.\n\nThe Cawston duelling stone was sculpted in Portland stone in 1770, and erected by the Holt Road near the Woodrow pub, by one W.W. Bulwer of Wood Dalling. It is not known if the Woodrow was already a pub at the time, but I suspect that it was. The public house (which still stands) was built in the 18th century, after the duel. The memorial is an urn on a square pedestal, and is inscribed on the front with the letters ‘H H’ to commemorate Henry Hobart. The Woodrow was still a working pub when I was regularly driven past it on my way to school from 1959. It was closed in 1963, but the adjacent garage remained open to supply petrol to passing cars. The garage was bought by the fuel company National Benzole, who in 1964 donated the duelling stone to the National Trust.\n\nSir Henry was a Whig politician who had been MP for Kings Lynn from 1781-1785. He held various positions under King William III. In 1798 a Tory neighbour, Oliver Le Neve, was said to have accused Hobart of having acted in a cowardly manner while serving in Ireland. Hobart immediately challenged Le Neve to a duel. Le Neve denied the accusation, but Hobart would have none of it. Le Neve apologised but this was not accepted either, so a fight was arranged to take place on August the 20th. The two opponents met at the appointed site with swords drawn, but there were no seconds to ensure a fair contest. This was illegal. Hobart was mortally wounded at Cawston but survived to die a day later at Blickling. Le Neve escaped to Holland. When he returned after two years he was tried at the Thetford assizes but acquitted. It was the last duel fought on Norfolk soil.\n\nHenry had been knighted at the age of 13 by king Charles II. The young man was headstrong and argumentative; he was well known swordsman, and all the signs pointed to him winning the duel. Oliver had only married two months before. The pair met on a Saturday morning, with the only witness a servant girl, who was terrified and hid her face in the bushes. Hobart almost immediately wounded Le Neve in the arm, but his sword became caught up in his opponent’s sleeve. Le Neve made his riposte and Hobart immediately felt a blade run through his stomach. He died in agony back at Blickling.\n\nI have passed the duelling stone many times, and once (many years ago) I stopped with my father to inspect the monument. It is something that I suspect few people have done. It is an insignificant memorial to a momentous event.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF THE PAST\n\nRate this:"
