        "text": "Check The Oil! magazine has two regular columns that are directly related to the topic of this Website. Letter from Europe looks at the relatively undeveloped Petroliana collecting scene in Europe and also at the history of European Petrol Companies. Dave Leach's regular map column covers Oil Company Road Maps from the USA and also internationally, including Europe.\n\nLetters from Europe\n\nOctober 2012: Beaulieu Autojumble 2012\n\nThis year's Beaulieu Autojumble was another successful event, with a wide range of interesting petroliana on sale. Although there were fewer plastic globes on sale than often, they did include a very rare globe carrying the \"Budget\" brand which was used for at most a couple of years around 1980 by Fina subsidiary Arndale Fuels, prior to using its own Arndale identity (see below right).\n\nSeptember 2006: Alcohol Blends\n\nJuly 2006: Shell's 1930s German Maps\n\nThe topic covered by this article needs no introduction to users of this website, as it focused on maps from pre-war Germany.\n\nJanuary 2006: Beaulieu Autojumble\n\nJuly 2005: Brussels Retro Festival and the Museo Fisogni\n\nJanuary 2005: Alan Vale's Collection\n\nSeptember 2004: Total - the International Gasoline\n\nMarch 2004: Toy Rail Tankers\n\nJanuary 2004: The 2003 Beaulieu Autojumble\n\nNovember 2003: Brussels\n\nSeptember 2003: Spidoléine\n\nJuly 2003: Techno Classica Essen (and Service Station design according to Minale)\n\nMarch 2003: French Standard Service Stations from the 1930s\n\nJanuary 2003: The 2002 Beaulieu Autojumble\n\nNovember 2002: Petrol Tankers\n\nSeptember 2002: Memoires en Route - an exhibition in Paris\n\nMay and July 2002: Trading Stamps in Europe\n\nMarch 2002: Theo multiple pumps\n\nIn the 1930s, the Liverpool-based firm of Theo & Company Ltd sold \"multiple pumps\" where a single fuel dispenser could sell up to six brands of fuel. These allowed UK service stations to offer all the popular grades without cluttering their forecourts.\n\nJanuary 2002: Alternative sources of petroliana in the UK\n\nNovember 2001: The origins of Elf\n\nWith the recent mergers to create TotalFinaElf, this letter took a timely look at its history, including some of the smaller names associated with it such as Elan, La Mure and NerVol.\n\nSeptember 2001: Romania\n\nJuly 2001: Susanne and Peter Bonito's Austrian Collection\n\nSusanne and Peter Bonito live in Vienna and have an extensive collection of petroliana, featuring Mobil and Shell. This letter looks at how Susanne started their collection and focuses on some of their favourite items. They also maintain an excellent website.\n\nMay 2001: Rétromobile\n\nMarch 2001: More small collectibles\n\nCarrying on the theme of the October Letter, this article looked at more small collectibles issued by petrol and oil companies, including key rings, such as those shown from Cepsa and Heron. Also featured were badges and some licence plates issued as a promotional item by Deutsche BP.\n\nDecember 2000: The Beaulieu Autojumble\n\nEach September, the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu, Hants. hosts Britain's largest autojumble. Many stalls have a selection of petroliana, and this report looked at some of the globes, signs and pumps on sale. One of the more unusual items was an early 1970s globe from Sheaf, made from three sheets of plastic and carrying Sheaf's distinctive purple and white colours.\n\nOctober 2000: Oil Company Pins\n\nSmall lapel pins are amongst the most widely collected items of petroliana in Europe. This article shows 14 pins, mainly from the 1960s, used by service station attendants or tanker drivers, plus a further 13 more recent promotional pins from France.\n\nAugust 2000: Five old pumps...\n\nA look at five old petrol pumps from Britain, each with a tale to tell. One of the five was an abandoned BP pump in Withington, Gloucs. (right).\n\nApril 2000: Conoco in Europe\n\nA brief history of Conoco in Europe, starting with its 1960s acquisitions of Jet, SOPI and Seca. The article also looked at been more recent operations in Scandinavia where Conoco acquired the Maxi and ARA chains, and at the much earlier involvement of Conoco's predecessor company, Marland, when it set up the Sealand Petroleum company in London in 1926.\n\nFebruary 2000: Petrol companies as publishers\n\nEuropean petrol companies have often published books, partly as a means of encouraging motorists to get out and see the countryside. This article looked at several examples from Britain, published by companies such as Shell, BP, National, Jet and Total. It also refers to some published in continental Europe.\n\nDecember 1999: Tunisia in the 1930s\n\nThis month the letter crossed the Mediterranean to Tunisia and looked up at the oil companies operating in there in the 1930s. There are copies of some classic adverts which were published in la Tunisie Automobile, the magazine of the A.C.T. Companies represented include Shell, Esso, Mobiloil, and Kervoline. A classic early 1960s Total station is also shown.\n\nOctober 1999: The history of Fina\n\nNoting that Fina had just been acquired by TOTAL, this month's letter looked at the history of Fina from its origins in Belgium in the early 1920s. Starting with the production of oil in Romania and Chechnya, Fina soon developed a downstream activities in Belgium, France and Britain, where it acquired Citex.\n\nThe article shows Fina stations operating under a number of different signs, as well as the Socal Fina variants used in Switzerland. There is also mention of Fina collectables including the once ubiquitous inflatable toys and cars given away by British service stations.\n\nAugust 1999: The London Classic Motor show and Britain's last globe?\n\nThe London Classic Motor show is held in late March each year at Alexandra Palace in North London. The 1999 show included some interesting small Petroliana, and featured an interesting display of cans and other small items from Mike Berry. The article also looked at a recently discovered design of Butler globe that appears to have been introduced as late as 1996.\n\nApril 1999: Speedwell Oils\n\nSpeedwell Oils were marketed by the British Oil and Turpentine Corporation under the slogan \"running made easy\" and showed a tiger chasing a native boy with a can of Speedwell Oil on his head. A 1935 booklet promoting the oil ran to 136 pages of hints, tips and delightful advertisements. The letter also looked briefly at the oil can collection of a Cambridgeshire collector.\n\nFebruary 1999: Ray Walls' globe collection\n\nRay Walls has several hundred globes in his collection ranging from early examples by Shell, Bluebird and Pratt's to relatively modern plastic globes from companies such as Ultramar, Baxter Johnson, Sadler and Burmah.\n\nDecember 1998: Ray Walls' Petroliana collection\n\nRaymond Walls lives just outside Belfast in Northern Ireland. He has what is probably the largest collection for Petroliana in UK with several thousand items: mainly from Britain and Ireland, but with a few from France, Holland and the USA. Highlights include large numbers of lubricating oil cans, two gallon petrol cans and enamelled signs dating back from the 1920s.\n\nOctober 1998: The Russians in Europe\n\nRussian oil companies have time to time become involved in the Western European petrol markets. One of the first of these was ROP which sold cut price petrol in Britain in the 1920s and 30s under the ZIP brand. Another Russian operation used the Nafta brand in Sweden in the 1930s and this name was revived in the 1960s for use in Britain and Belgium. Nafta's British operation was sold to Q8, which had bought Gulf in the rest of Europe, and the letter also shows a rare UK Gulf globe still in use at a small Devon garage.\n\nJune 1998: Retromobile\n\nRetromobile is the largest annual event devoted to Automobile and boat related materials in France. The February 1998 show had some excellent enamelled signs, cans and globes on display.\n\nApril 1998: Children's toy tankers and garages\n\nA look at children's toys produced by companies including Matchbox, Dinky, Hot Wheels (formerly Corgi) and Majorette. Two Indian models, based on early Dinky designs, were also featured in the colours of Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil.\n\nFebruary 1998: The role of Petroleum Co-operatives in Europe\n\nThis letter featured the history of the OK co-operative based in Sweden. It also looked briefly at some of the agricultural co-operatives in the UK with retail fuel operations.\n\nOctober 1997: Petroliana in Sweden\n\nTo coincide with the opening of a large exhibition at the Nordiska Museet in Stockholm called \"Bilen\" (cars), the article looked at some of the Petroliana to be found in Sweden. Items were also featured from the Motor Museum in Motala, and there was an image of maps from a number of companies.\n\nAugust 1997: Giveaways from British service stations\n\nThere was a brief look some of the football related giveaways from British service stations as well as a small garage in Cheltenham that had been operating more or less continuously since 1912 under one family ownership.\n\nJune 1997: Two British Museums\n\nThis letter looked at the collections of Petroliana that can be found in the Cotswold Motor Museum in Bourton-on-the-Water and in the Lakeland Motor Museum at Holker Hall in Cumbria.\n\nApril 1997: Europe's secret service stations\n\nThree American companies had small service station operations in Europe that were not publicised by in the USA. They were Kendall and Getty which both operated in Italy in the 1960s, and Phillips 66 which supplied the small chain in Britain under the TOPS brand.\n\nFebruary 1997: German Zapftstellen\n\nIn the 1930s when space in German cities was at a premium, many oil companies developed so-called Zapftstellen that were basically small sidewalk buildings that both stored and dispensed petrol. The letter shows examples from Olex, Leuna and BV.\n\nDecember 1996: Finds in East Anglia\n\nEast Anglia is a predominantly rural area of England where there are still a reasonable number of smaller service stations. This letter showed a pair of Phoenix pumps plus an abandoned station on the A143 and described some of the other smaller names to be found in the area.\n\nOctober 1996: BP and Mobil collectables\n\nAs BP and Mobil were about to merge their downstream operations in Europe, this letter looked at some of the collectables to be found from the two companies, including a rare modern design of Mobil globe.\n\nAugust 1996: the first letter from Europe\n\nThe first letter from Europe gave an introduction to the collecting hobby in Europe and showed advertising signs from BP and Dominion Motor Spirit.\n\nThe Christmas 2010 quiz answers are:\n\nAdler - Amoco, later sold to France's Elf\n\nCleveland - Esso\n\nDominion - Marland, but sold to Shellmex-BP soon after Marland's merger with Conoco\n\nEP - Murphy Oil (Murco)\n\nGainsborough - Sinclair then Atlantic Richfield (Arco), later sold to Total\n\nRedline - Although it claimed to be 100% British-owned, Redline may have had links to Union Oil Company of California, but was later sold to Esso\n\nTops - Phillips 66\n\nVIP - Signal Oil, then Occidental (OXY), later sold to Elf\n\nText, layout & images © Ian Byrne, 2000-16\n\nAll original copyrights in logos and map extracts and images are acknowledged and images are included on this site for identification purposes only."
