        "text": "This superb gunmetal or bronze medallion came to us in a collection of vintage keyrings and will probably date from the 1950s although it has been produced in the ‘art deco’ style of the 1920s .\n\nIt depicts a four spoked steering wheel in the grasp of a pair of hands which emerge from the sleeves of a traditional linen jacket and are in the correct ‘ten minutes to two ‘ driving position .\n\nWe have inlaid the medallion into a new keyfob in oak bark tanned leather .\n\nThese Scammell keyrings are some of the most beautiful quality keyrings which were ever produced for cars & lorries and are a shining example of just how good English keyring manufacturing rose to in the 1960s & 1970s .\n\nVery few of those Scammell keyrings that were used will have survived the rigours of life on the road in a commercial vehicle .\n\nIn our opinion these keyrings are some of the most original & iconic vehicle keyrings which were ever made – and show the affection which these lorries were held in by transport companies and drivers alike .\n\nThe keyrings are beautifully made with a nickel plated badge with jewellery quality vitreous enamel detail in the shape of a Scammell lorry radiator mounted onto a keyring in genuine tan pigskin leather .\n\nThe back of the keyfobs is gold embossed with the legend :- ‘ IF YOU’VE GOT A LOAD TO MOVE GET A SCAMMELL ‘\n\nPigskin leather was ( and is ) a very expensive material and was usually reserved for keyrings for prestige cars such as Jaguar & Aston Martin – not usually for lorries !\n\nUsing such an upmarket material for these keyrings shows the pride which owners and drivers of these vehicles had all those years ago ( and still do have )\n\nThe vehicles which Scammell produced are so well known that they need no description here – sadly Scammell ceased producing lorries in the late 1980s.\n\nAlbion Motor Co. of Finnieston Street in Glasgow Scotland produced the famous Chieftain, Clydesdale & Reiver trucks .\n\nAlbion’s motto was ‘ Sure as the Sunrise ’ .\n\nThe Albion Reiver was a 6 wheeler truck and was immortalised by Mark Knopfler\n\n( originally of Dire Straits fame ) in his 2009 song :- ‘Border Reiver ‘ .\n\nKnopfler was originally from Newcastle and the Reiver was close to his heart and roots as the original term ‘Border Reiver’ related to Scottish clansmen whose chief activity was cattle rustling and other misdemeanors operating on both sides of the Scottish/English border to avoid being arrested by forces from either country.\n\n“ Southern bound from Glasgow town, shes shining in the sun\n\nMy Scotstoun lassie, on the border run .\n\nWhistling down the hillsides and tearing up the climbs\n\nI’m just a thiever, stealing time\n\nIn the Border Reiver.\n\nThree hundred thousand on the clock and plenty more to go\n\nCrash, box and lever, she needs the heel and toe\n\nShe’s not too cold in winter but she cooks me in the heat\n\nI’m a six foot driver but you can adjust the seat\n\nIn the Border Reiver\n\nSure as the sunrise, that’s what they say about the Albion “\n\nIn the 1960s motor dealers soon started to issue keyrings with their own details on with cars which they had sold – here is a lovely early example from the 1960s with jewellery quality vitreous enamel and a sheath of wheat as a logo.\n\nNot actually a motor dealer keyring – but a charming keyfob badge from the 1960s promoting Silver Fox Stainless Steel – probably Sheffield based .\n\nThe badge was made by the famous CUD company ( Castles Unit Development Co. of Leicester ) as can be seen on the reverse of the badge .\n\nCUD made the late 1950s & 1960s torpedo car keyrings which are so sought after by collectors .\n\nAlso on the back of the badge can be seen the initials ‘ TPL ‘ scratched into the badge – doubtless engraved by the owner of the keyring who decided to personalise his own keyring before personalising became fashionable!\n\nThis Indian motorcycle badge came to us from USA and was probably intended as a watch fob badge rather than as a keyfob badge .\n\nNonetheless – our subject is keyrings so onto a keyfob it was mounted .\n\nDifficult to put a date on the badge – but it is certainly not as old as the last Indian Chief motorcycle to come off the production line in 1952 just before Indian sadly ‘ bit the dust ‘ .\n\nIt was only the late Indian Chiefs which actually had an ignition key which needed a keyring – so this keyring will probably end up being used in an Indian owner’s car rather than on their motorcycle !\n\nThis keyring will have travelled the length & breadth of the UK very many times over and probably most of Europe as well – in a Leyland Tiger bus which is the vehicle which it represents .\n\nWhilst the leather keyfob itself has seen very considerable use and is now worn in and polished with use like a comfortable pair of boots :- the enamel badge is completely intact and without an enamel chip or even a small scratch – which is quite remarkable – this keyring was obviously a treasured possession and a badge of honour.\n\nIt has now been received by us to be treated simply as merchandise amongst all of our other vintage keyrings – which seems rather sad after the illustrious life it must have led.\n\nTo us – a keyring in this very carefully used condition is of far greater value than a new old stock keyring which has spent it’s life forgotten at the back of a cupboard drawer rather than out on the open road.\n\nThese keyrings are still perfectly serviceable and have many more miles left in them yet and would look very much the part in use in an original condition car or motorcycle which has not suffered the indignity of over- restoration .\n\nA few years ago keyrings in this condition would not have been considered saleable but the market has changed very dramatically .\n\nNowadays many customers do much prefer a keyring which has ‘ had a life ‘ rather than one in new old stock perfection .\n\nVenerable old keyrings like these were brand new almost 60 years ago and dangled from the ignition of a similarly brand new motor car or motorcycle as the ignition key was turned on for the very first time .\n\nFast forward almost a lifetime and that keyring has now travelled countless thousands of miles probably in several different vehicles but usually with the same driver .\n\nIt has only been as a result of repairing many hundreds of keyrings for customers over the years that we have begun to realise the significance of these aged jewels and the sentimental importance in which they are held by their owners irrespective of condition .\n\nKeyrings like these have become talismans which have accompanied their owners on all their journeys through life .\n\nIf only keyrings like these could talk……………."
