The tanker, registered TYH 799, was No. 2627 in their fleet. The vehicle had stood exposed and derelict for over forty years until it was discovered by an expert coachbuilder, who has restored it completely into it's present condition.\n\n\"National Benzole\" was a major petroleum brand used in the United Kingdom from 1919 to the 1960s. It was later re-branded by it's new owners (Shell-BP) as \"National\" until the early 1990s, when the brand was phased out by parent company, BP.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Terry Pinnegar Photography.
