        "text": "The wheel of wealth will be slowed by all difficulties of transport at whatever point3 arising, as a carriage is by the roughness of the roads over which it runs.\"âJohn Beattie Crozier.\n\nCorrect Benzole Costs.\n\nThe National Benz()le Co., Ltd., disagrees with the section of the report of the Sub-committee on Motor Fuel, _appointed by the Standing Committee on Prices under the Profiteering Act, dealing with the cost and the recommended retail price of benzole, and, in the course of a statement issued by the company, it is asserted that the committee made a serious error in assuming that a gallon of crude benzole when refined gave an exact equivalent quantity of refined motor benzole. It is pointed out that the exact constituents of a gallon of average quality crude benzole when refined are as follow :-63 per cent. -meter benzole; -5 per cent, solvent naphtha.; 20 per cent, creosote; whilst 12 per cent. is lost in refining, showing that from one gallon of crude benzoic less than twothirds of a gallon of motor benzole is produced.\n\nThe committee took its cost of the crude benzole at is. 4d., but, on this badis of output of refined benzole, the equivalent cost of one gallon of refined benzole must be 2s. lid., whilst to this\n\nâ¢ must be gadded the cost of refining, say, 60. per gallon, and 5d. per gallon may be deducted for the value of the residuals, leaving the net. cost of one gallon of motor benzole at the manufacturers' works at 2.. 3d., whilst to this must be added the allowance made by the committee of 50. for distribution, and 4d. for the garage profit, bringing the total cost to the public to 3s. 00., which, however, does not allow the same profit to the distributor of lid. per gallon as is allowed in the case of petrol. Again, the committee allows for distribution of petrol 6.197d., whereas it only allows 50. in the case of benzole. Making Corrections in each of these items, the cost of benzole to the public should be 3s. 2.697d. The company point out that the committee's suggestion to cut down the price of National benzole to 2s. 8d. per gallon is suicidal, and is certainly net likely to act as an encouragement of the production of home-produced-motor fuel, which is regarded as the sole remedy for the grave danger of a motor spirit famine..\n\nSelling British Lorries in Germany.\n\nThe disposal of surplus British Army lorries in Germany was the subject of a number of questions put by Mr. Marriott and Mr. Forrest in the 'House of Common.s one day last week.\n\nMr. Rollaway, in his reply, said that motor lorries in Germany are notified to the Diapoeal Board for sale from time to time as and when they become surplus to requirements. All the lorries disposed of up to the present have been sold to British firms, and equal opportunity of purchasing vehicles LS afforded to all British private firms of financial standing.\n\nThe total number of lorries in the motor transport parks at Aaehener and Bickersdorf (Cologne) aerodromes on February 1st was 3,300, of which 2,550 have been notified to the Disposal Board as surplus to requirements. Of the latter 018 number 716 have been sold to the Maudslay Motor Co., Ltd., and 200 to the Albion Motor Car Co., Ltd. The total sum realized from these sales was -Â£334,400. A further 562 of the surplus lorries have beets shipped to this country for repair. The average price obtained for vehicles in situ in Cologne is Â£387 per lorry. Six hundred and sixty-six Thornycroft lorries were recently sold in Cologne by the Disposal Board, and they were purchased by the Mandalay Motor Go., Ltd., at an average price of Â£400.\n\nMr. H. P. Thompson, writing to The Times concerning Mr. Kella.way's answer, coteplains of delay and difficulty attending attempts to negotiate with the Disposal Board for these lorries.\n\nThe 1920 Tractor Trials.\n\nOne of the fuatfruits of the combination of the efforts of the Royal Agricultural Society and the -Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in regard to the Farm Tractor Trials of 1920 is a distinct improvement in the classification Of competing vehicles.\n\nFormerly, Class 1, as outlined by the R.A.S.E., was for agrimotors, of under 30 h.p, Class,2 being for agrimotors of over 30 h.p. Class 1 has now been divided into two classes, so that there are seven classes altogether instead of six. Class 1 is now for agrimotors not exceeding 24 h.p. suitable for ploughing two furrows, whilst Class 2 is for vehicles of unspecified h.p. suitable for ploughing three furrows. Class 3 remains as before (except for its new numbering) for tractors of over po h.p. suitable for ploughing four furrows.\n\nAnother alteration which has been made is the extension of the date for the receipt of entries to March 27th.\n\n17,806 War Lorries Sold.\n\nMr. KeLlaway stated, in reply 'to a question by Mr. Atkey, in the House of Commons ono day last week, that the number of lorries disposed of up to the present is 17,806, and the price realized for them was Â£7,239,159. The total mmher of lorries under the control of the Ministry of Munitions at the present time is 15,394, This figure includes the lorries under repair at Slough and those in Abbeville and. Cologne.\n\nThe new Karrier company with the title of Karrier Motors, Ltd., has recently been formed with a. capital of Â£650,000 in Â£1 shares (250,000 preferred).\n\nMr. John Allen, 0.B.E., has, on account of ill-health, tendered his resignation of the vice-chairmanship of the Standing Joint Committee of Road Transport Associations. Mr. R. J. Howley has been elected to fill the post.\n\nSir Henry Fowler, K.B.E., is the next president of the Institution of Automobile Engineers. His first connection with heavy motoring was as chief observer, of the Liverpool heavy motor trials of 1898, when he was one of the trusted lieutenants of Sir John Aspinall at the Horwich works of the L. and Y.R.\n\nState Fuel Action.\n\nA deputation to Sir Hamar Greenwood, in his capacity as Minister in charge of the Petroleum Department of the Govern. went, -was received at the House of Commons last week, representing the Standing Joint Committee of Mechanical Road Transport Associations.\n\nThe deputation urged that the maximum facilities by all departments should be given to promote increases of all home-produced fuel, more particularly benzole and power alcohol, whilst it wasâ¢ further urged that the State should increase its investments in oil fields, and should take all possible steps to ensure the development of wells and fields within the empire.\n\nSir Hamar Greenwood gave a favourable reception to the deputation, and undertook to lay its representations before the Cabinet.\n\nOpposing Tramway Schemes.\n\nA petition against the L.C.C.'s Tram ways and Improvements Bill has been lodged in the House of Commons by the Automobile Association and Motor Union. Among the points urged in opposition to the proposals are the inadequacy of the proposals to increase the width of the road; the danger arising from reducing footway -width in order to secure greater carriage-way width; the fact that considerable congestion will he caused on certain important arterial thoroughfares by the running of tramways; and the inadvisability, lack of necessity, arid inexpediency of the proposals at the present time when the need for speeding up transport for London is becoming a vital necessity.\n\nA new benzoic company is coming nub next week.\n\nThe L.G.O.C. experiments with alcohol-benzole mixtures are completed.\n\nThe addition of 5 per cent, by volume of acetone improves the volatility of petrol, owing to its low boiling point.\n\nThe annual luncheon's and meeting of the C.M.U.A. have been fixed for Wed, nesday, April 14th, at the Savoy Hotel, London.\n\nThe U.S.A. has begun. to Control fuel exports by prohibiting the exportation of fuel oil As a result, _creosote, oil is already up by 100 per tent. in price to is, 4d. per gallon.\n\nThe inaugural meeting of the Institute of Transport takes place on Monday next at the Institution of Civil Engineers, London. There are already upwards of 500 members and associates.\n\nl3onallackand Sons are turning, out a considerable number of well-constructed, serviceable standard bodies for use on the standard Ford chassis and also the one-ton model manufactured by the Ford. Tradesmen may note with interest that early delivery can be given.\n\nHeat Treatment at HaHeys.\n\nNo pains are being spared to ensure that the material used in the construction of the Halley \" Six \" shall be worthy of the ,excellent design of the new mode.\n\nAt the works at Yoker an up-to-date heat-treating plant has been installed, and a very completely equipped laboratory for carrying out of both physical . and chemical tests. Here all material used in the Halley works will undergo a rigorous inspection and the heat-treating processes will be carried out under the continual supervision of the expert scientist in charge.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Halleys are rapidly recovering from the effects â¢ a the moulders' strike, and that output is rapidly increasing.\n\nL.C.C. Buses.\n\nThe estimates required by the Standing Orders of Parliament which have been prepared by the L.C.C. show the expenditure of capital that will be required in the event of sanction being given to the Council's Traniwaye and Street Improvements Bill of the present session.\n\nThe total expenditure is estimated at Â£5,118,500. Of this sum, Â£3,363,500 is estimated to be required in connection with, and for the construction and equipment of the proposed new tramwavs and the reconstruction of the Embankment tramways, .1,355,000 is required for a new street and street wiâ¢denings, whilst Â£400,000 is to provide omnibuses for service from or to any point Within the county or beyond the county within the 'Metroplitan Police district.\n\nDemands for Welding.\n\nThe growing extent to which transport by road is being utilized in cases of urgency in preference to carriage by rail appears to be making itself distinctly felt in connection -with, the transit of motor-vehicle component parts for repair.\n\nThe New Welding Co., 26, Betsebery Avenue, EC. 1, inform no that both at their London office and their Manchester establishment there has been lately an extraordinary increase in the proportion of orders arriving by lorry âoften over dista:itoes exceeding 100 miles. The reasons for this are, of coarse obvious, and it is clear that where as in cases of welding, time is of paramount importance, business . concerns are no longer content to trust themselves to the haaancle of the railways under ixresent conditions.\n\nDraughtsmen Wanted.\n\nOne of the leading concerns in the petrol-vehicle industry is desirous of getting in touch with qualified draughtsmen and draughtsmen's assistants. They have vacancies for a very thigh-class man and for five or six assistants.\n\nWe shall be pleased to pass on to them any inquiries addressed to \" C.H.L.,\" care of the Editor of this journal.\n\nA Three-language Catalogue.\n\nDennis Bros., Ltd., of Guildford, evidently with an eye to overseas trade, have just issued a c:atalegue printed in three languagesâEnglish, French and. Spanish. An effort' has been made in producing this book to oonvey to the reader, by means of -unretouched illustrations, some of the methods of manufacturing the standard 3-4-ton Dermis lorry and the 30-seater char-a-bance of which specifications and working drawings are contained in the catalogue. It should Offer an incentive to prospective purchasers to pay a visit to the company's works, which are thoroughly up-to-date and cover a large area.\n\nTractor Trials in Poland.\n\nAn exhibition of agricultural machinery and a trial of motor ploughs will take place at Lemberg next June. The British Consul at Warsaw has notified the Department of Overseas Trade in this country that the trial will take place at Tarnopol from June lit to June25th, participating machines to be delivered before May 25th. The conditions of the competition may be seen by British firms at the inquiry room, Department of Overseas Trade, 35, Old Queen Street, S.W, 1, and applications by intending competitorS must be sent in before April 1st to the â¢Exhibition Committee, Warsaw, Clunielna No. 2.\n\nBuses for Walthamstow.\n\n. Having considered a report on motor omnibuses prepared by the tramways manager, the Walthamst,ow Corporation Tramways Committee now recommends the promotion of a Bill to enable the Council to run motor omnibuses.\n\nPersonal Pars.\n\nCongratulatiens to Lieut.-Col. D. S. Kennedy, D.S.O., on successfully coming through a rather difficult operation to his eyes. 1Vlany readers will remember him in pre-war days when, in partnership with Mr. G. W. Watson, he practised as a consulting engineer with London offices in Pall Mali. Prior to that, he had been responsible for one of the largest fleets of vehicles in London, and in earlier days was connected with Tlaornyerofts and Wallis and &covens. Col. Kennedy's experience with commercial vehicles, both steam and petrol, has been extensive and varied in many parts of the globe. Not long before the war, in collaboration with Mr. G. W. Watson, he read a valuable paper on the subject before the Institution of Automobile Engineers, of which he is a member. He is also a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. During the war, in the,. M.T., Col. Kennedy's\"; abilities found full scope. He organized one of the earliest and most successful heavy repair shops in France, after which he commenced to build and organize another north of Dunkirk, so near to, the front that, during the process it was continually bombed and \"straddled\" by the long range fire which made Dunkirk useless as a port. This uncomfortable site become untenable when the memorable retreat of March, 1918, occurred. At the shortest notice, Cal. Kennedy, had hastily to pull down asernany of his buildings as he could, uproot his plant, and, packing his unit, lock, stock and barrel on to five trains, to retire. to the comparative quiet of Rouen. There, bn a, marshy site, he started again, and, in record time, overcame its difficulties, erected a repair shop which was a model of its kind, and got from it an output which was invaluable in keeping the transport going in those critical days from the beginning of 1918.\n\nMr. George W. Watson occupied the presidential chair at the meeting of the Institution of Automobile Engineers on Wednesday last, when Mr. P. J. Worsley ready his paper on gears and gearing, and took a welcome stand against prolixity in the discussion. His own contribution to a highly technical subject would have been welcomed. His work on Tank gearboxes was a -valuable contribution to the nation's efforts in the war.\n\nAlgerian Transport:\n\nThe most difficult problem in Algeria at the present time is one of transport. During the war railway rolling stock deteriorated considerably, and, this has resulted in an enormous delay in transpotting produce from. the interior to the decks.\n\nA remarkable proof of the expansion of business in Algeria is forthcoming from the inauguration of a number of motor-vehicle services. In less than a year the number of motorbuses and motor lorries has multiplied very considerably. Fourteen services of motorbuses are now running in the department of Oran, 17 in the department of Constantine, and 24 in that of Algiers. In the entire colony of Algeria some 500 motor lorries are now on the roads, -and the number is constantly increasing.\n\nBrighton and Heavy Traffic.\n\nBrighton Corporation Watch Committee has considered a letter from the National Traction Engine Owners' and Users' Association, complaining that the only available route for heavy locomotives through Brighton (via Old Shoreham Road) is positively dangerous. In view of the fact that the present bylaws were framed 20 years ago, 'ince when self-propelled traffic has beconle so general throughout the country, the asso(dation urged the Corporation to revise the by-laws. The Watch Committee has, on the suggestion of the Chief Constable, now agreed to permit King's Road and Grand Junction Road to be used between the hours of 6 p.m. and 9 a.m.\n\nPalladiums for Overseas.\n\nPalladium Autecaes' Ltd., are evielently fully alive to the potentialities of overseas trade, as orders which they have recently received go to prove. Four 4-ton Palladiums are being shipped to Bombay at a-n early date to the order of Mr. K. D. Wadia, of Bombay, whilst the company have also received orders from Trollope and Coils' Ltd., the building contractors of London, for the supply of foer similar vehicles which are to be sent to China in connection with the construction of the enormous bank buildings that the company is undertaking in Shanghai and Hong-Kong. An order has also been received (subject to the ratification of the Board of Trade and the Minister of the Interior in Roumania) for the supply of two 4-ton chassis for use in Roumania. Other fourtanners of this make have also been sent to Spain and other parts of Europe quite recently.\n\nWe understand that the company have definitely decided to reserve a considerable percentage of its production to be used to open up a steady export trade.\n\nLeicester and Motor Traffic.\n\nLeicester authorities' in common with these of some other of the older Midland towns, whose central thoroughfares have become quite inadequate to meet the stress of modern-day motor traffic, are concentrating attention upon potential remedies, but the suggested adoption of the plan favoured by Manchester and Glasgow for regulating locomotion at tramway stops is. not meeting with general acceptance.\n\nThe objection in Leicester's case is that the attempted remedy is calculated to prove â¢worse than the di,seaise;41 020 hard-and-fast by-law, it is argued, being likely to make the congestion greater than over in the central area of the cityr., The idea has been put forward locally that, at points at which queue stands are established, as at all central stoppingplaces, the safety and convenience of the public may be best served by diverting the tram lines to the kerb, rendering the ground usualliy covered by the elines free for the passage of non-stop traffic. There are, however, inherent difficulties in the matter, which, obviously, are not limited in their application to the conditions of Leiceater a central thoroughfares.\n\nInst. A.E. Paper.\n\nAn interesting paper, entitled \" Gear Cutting for Motorcars,\" was read before the Institution by Mr. P. J. Worsley.\n\nM.I.A.E., on Wesdneday, 3rd inst. The author, owing to the large scope of the subject, had to abbreviate his paper to what amounted practically to a review of the methods and processes in general eze for gear-teeth production, with short descriptions of the principles on which gear-cutting machines work. The author stated that interest centres chiefly round bevels for rear axle drives.\n\nIn the discussion which followed the paper, several speakers pointed out that generating teeth is much to be preferred to cutting them with a hob.\n\nCaptein S. Brantley 11Toore, representing David Brown and Sons (Huddersfield), Ltd., gave some interesting details of the new F.J. type worm gear, which we recently described.\n\nMunicipal Transport Departments.\n\nLocal authorities which have not established transport. departments are thinking of doineso. Walthamstow Council has asked the chiefs of its departments to confer and report as to arranging for the tramways department to be the Council's recognized transport department., and be a centre for the housing, maintenance, and repair of Mechanicallypropelled vehicles.\n\nThe Disposal Board states that it het a limited number of unused 25 h.p. Crossley motor ambulances at 2600 each.\n\nOpenings in Guatemala.\n\nEvidence is not wanting that_busine.se men and transport owners in Guatemala and neighbourhing countries are waking up to the fact that something has to be done about the transportation question. In considering this question it should be noted that there are two classes of hauling to be catered for : one consists in getting crops from the farms to the nearest railway point; the other is timber hauling, but it seems that the latter is the more important medium for introducing motor vehicles into Guatemala.\n\nThere is at present no representation of the British motor industry in the district, and this has already benefited the manufacturers of -American vehicles.\n\nAs to the type of machine most suitable for operation in this country, it should be knewn that all roads in Gusto male are soft, dirt e-oads, mostly consisting of steep gradients and all kinds of curves and corners. Vehicles should be capable of being run on paraffin, as that fuel can always be obtained in the'-country districts in an emergency, whereas petrol cannot.\n\nRoadside Fuel Supplies.\n\nThe Automobile Association have installed a motor spirit bulk storage station at Aldermaston on the Bath road.\n\nâ¢ This is the fleet of its kind in Great Britain, and is the first of a 'series being erected by the Association throughout the -country. The etations are being installed with a view to popularizing bulk storage. For the moment only benzole is stocked, but as other home-produced fuels come on the market it is probable that they will also be supplied. â¢\n\nParis Street Flushing.\n\nThe French De Dion company recently supplied 12 motor watering-carts and road sweepers combined to the city of Paris. These vehicles carry a butt holding 3,600 litres of water, and the spray can he regulated to deliver 200 litres per minute. The trials of the vehicles, which were held near the Hotel de Ville, were entirely successful. About 100 of these vehicles are expected to be turned out by the De Dion Co. very shortly. We illustrate on this page one of the vehicles under test.\n\nAlbion Extensions.\n\nThe Albion Motor Car Co., Ltd.' have practically completed negotiations to acquire a large additional piece of land of between 40 and 50 acres near their pre sent works at Scotstoun. When the buildings which it is intended to erect upon this site are finished, employment should be provided for a large number of workers, and the extensions will go a considerable way towards making Glasgow and Western Scotland one of the world's principal centres for the mana7, facture of commercial-motor vehieles.\n\nMotor Cab Co. 'Sued.\n\nMr. -G. II. Tontatinyof Pedro Street, Clapton Park, recently sued the National Motor Cab Co., King \"Street, Hammersmith, for the return of Â£20 deposit, Â£25 spent in repairs, Â£50 estimated loss, and Â£100 for breach of warranty. Tornatin, who â¢ had bought the ear from the 'National Motor Cab Co.,on the hire-pur. chase system, 'stated that although the defendants had had the cab \"in hospital\" for nine days and he had spent Â£25 on it, the vehicle was useless. The plaintiff's (.01-1 said : \"The car drove me mad, and I joined the Army to get out of the way of it.\"\n\nValentine Newell, motor expert, said the car was a good one of its class, and was good for 3,000 to 4,000 miles.\n\nThe jury found that there had been fraudulent misrepresentation and for the Plaintiff on all points, but Judge Cluer entered â¢a verdict for a recision of the contract and Â£100 damages.\n\nViews on Haulage.\n\nAn interesting and practical address was recently given at a. meeting of the Bournemouth Rotary Club by Mr. H. Newland. The author described industry as being divided into two broad groups, manufacturing production and transport, transport coming second only to manufacture, but each hieing absolutely dependent upon the other.\n\nMr. Newland claimed that there is nothing finer-looking, with the right thing an the right place, than a wellturned-out commercial motor vehicle of\n\nany type. In the matter of conveyance there can be no comparison between the method of delivery by railway and by road by the latter method any load up to 10' tons can be transported from door to door, without expensive packing and 'without any intermediate handling what\n\never, to a destination 80 miles away in one day. This brought home the great need of putting motor transport on a sound economical basis with universal and impartial organizations to provide return loads and vehicles for these loads.\n\nSpeaking as a haulage contractor, the author said that he could definitely state that if he could be reasonably assured of return loads he could knock the bottom out of almost-any railway rates up to at least a 50-mile radius.\n\nDeath of M. Saurer.\n\nWe regret to announce the death of M. Adolph Saurer at the age of 70. He was the founder of the well-known Swiss commercial motor concern at Arbon. The Saurer business was established in 1853, and soon developed in the making of gas motors. Adolph Saurer was also a pioneer in the commercial vehicle-weal& and his farm was one of the first to produce a really serviceable machine. About 2,000 men find employment in the Arbon works. M. Saurer was a man very well\n\nliked, and the town of Arbon will lose in him quite a philanthropist.\n\nHints on Working Aluminium._\n\nIn view of the extended use which is being made of aluminium for various purposes in the commercial-vehicle industry, we feel sure that the booklets issued by the British Aleminium Co., Ltd., 109, Queen Victoria Street, B.C. 4, on\"Hints on Working Aluminium,\" will be welcomed.
