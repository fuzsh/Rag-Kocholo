        "text": "Home Smurfs Supersmurfs Playsets Houses Buildings Contact\n\nBP Australia history\n\n1979-1982\n\nIt all started in August 1979.\n\nSmurfday was set to 9th of September 1979.\n\nAs you can read 10 smurfs were sold when the campaign started. First release.\n\nAnd you could also get the display rack with the correct smurf names used\n\nin Australia. It says for display only so maybe customers could not buy this??\n\nSmurfs were sold for 85 cents when they started.\n\nFirst smurfs sold in September 1979.\n\nBefore the end of 1979 they sold these 16 smurfs. So 6 more were added in 1979.\n\nKeep Fit, Astro, Coin, Sunbather, Papa and Smurfette.\n\nAlready in November 1979 PeterÂ´s sold the blue/white ice lolly with the name Smurfee.\n\nSo this existed before the PVC Smurfee was made or painted.\n\nThis advert was also in the papers in 1979.\n\nCloseup on the text\n\n1980\n\nThe first poster from 1980 is this one from June. A funny thing is that they\n\nused the same poster in 1981, but changed some smurfs.\n\nGolfer, Tennis, Trumpeter, Chef and Digger is marked ( coming soon).\n\nAnd here are the supers shown on that poster.\n\nThis was the poster used for Christmas 1980. 27 regular smurfs and 9 super smurfs.\n\n3 new playsets were sold for Christmas. Playset 1,2,3,4, large house and cottage were also sold in 1980.\n\nAs you see the Smurfee was new for Christmas 1980. It was made after the\n\nSmurfee ice lolly from Peters and since it got the same name it is kind of a promo smurf.\n\nIt was the first ice lolly smurf made in Hongkong I think.\n\n1981\n\nIn 1981 we got the Australian rules smurf. The first version of this smurf was made\n\nfor BP Australia. It was painted in the VFL colours. I do not know if it is correct but I call\n\nit the VFL as a difference to the australian rules sold in other colours and other countries.\n\nAFL did not exist when this was made in 1981. VFL changed name to AFL in 1990. The\n\nclosest correct name could be \"Big V\" as they were called in the interstate matches. :)\n\nHere are the ones shown on the poster from 1981.\n\nThe rugby and australian rules sold then were both unmarked and had the same base.\n\nFor christmas 1981 you could see this advert.\n\nThere is a picture from a station in the smurf advert pages.\n\nIt shows that smurf in cage was also sold during 1981.\n\n1982\n\nKath showed us these pictures from summer( January) 1982. It was probably\n\namong the last smurfs sold when BP had the smurf license in Australia.\n\nAdditional information\n\nHere is a display I got from Australia. I have removed some of the smurfs\n\nto check markings and some were removed before I got the display.\n\nThe interesting thing is that almost all smurfs mentioned sold in Australia\n\non this page have their name on this display. And since most of them are glued\n\nor were glued I am 100% sure they were the versions sold at that time in Australia.\n\nTherefore I am pretty sure Laughing, Flute, Injured and Gardener (Mermaid and\n\nSurfer??) were sold by BP before they stopped. Probably a few more were sold but\n\nso far we have no pictures of them. :)\n\nThis display is and was in pretty bad shape, but it tells a lot about the history.\n\nThe smurfs sold in Australia were made in Hongkong. But sometimes, just like\n\nBP South Africa, they got other smurfs made for BP, like mustard dot smurfs.\n\nThe display has the correct australian names on the stickers.\n\nTogether with this display I also got the extremly rare BP playset with the pump.\n\nI do not know if it was ever sold or if it was a promotional item for the stores??\n\nAnd here is some additional information from the seller who had a BP station in\n\nCanberra with her husband during the smurf-era.\n\nHere are some answers Maureen could give me about the display:\n\n\"The smurf in box has a BP on front of his overalls. The pump has a sticker red BP Super &\n\nprice per \"liter\" above the red . There doesn't appear to be a green & yellow BP sign unless it\n\nis hidden in the unopened plastic, can't see it though & don't want to open it.The back of box\n\nthe contents are described in 4 languages, German, French, English, don't know the 4th \"nog\n\nmeer smurfen om te smurfen\". On the posters I'm sending it mentions 1980 so that must have\n\nbeen the year they were launched. My husband was president of the Australian Service\n\nStation Association at that time & we did go to the launching of the smurfs either in Hong\n\nKong or Singapore can't remember which & have no photos but I'm still sorting through\n\nthings. My husband died in August last year & I havn't touched most of the things we\n\nhoarded. I don't even know why we kept the smurfs, probably to give to the grandkids\n\none day but they are now too old for smurfs (to play with) So there you are ! \"\n\n\" Iâm looking through some of the questions you asked. I canât remember when the items\n\nwere sold it would have been early 1980âs. We had a large 24 hour site in the middle of\n\nCanberra so we would have been among the first to sell smurfs. I have another box of\n\nnewspaper cuttings & documents Iâve recently opened which I havnât been through as yet but\n\nIâve just done a quick look & found a brochure in very good condition with heading\n\nâCollecting Smurfs is Smurfyâ & a photo of the smurfs. In bottom right hand corner is a\n\nsquare with âlets go Smurfingâ & a big BP sign . I think it maybe similar to one I sent you\n\nWith the original purchase. You can have it if you want it its no use to me. I have your\n\naddress & I still owe you around $10. Donât expect to receive it in a hurry as Iâve a lot of\n\nsorting to do. I think I told you my husband died 18 months ago & Iâm trying to downsize the\n\naccumulated junk but it takes time, its slow work. You asked for a photo of Bruce when he\n\nwas Motor Trade president Iâll try to get one of those to you too. Digital cameras wernât\n\naround in those days so we didnât tend to take photos of every single moment of our lives like\n\nthe kids today do. I didnât have a rugby smurf & can;t remember the ice lolly. Any other way\n\nI can help let me know but donât think there is much I can add. Iâve just reread another of\n\nyour emails where you state you are writing the history of smurfs. Wish I could help more. If\n\nthere is anything from BP Australia you really need to know Iâll just have to try harder to find\n\nsomeone but you could probably do the same. Good luck with it all. Maureen\"\n\nHere are the smurfs and smurf accessories sold by BP in Australia\n\nFirst the playsets which all were marked BP. Notice that in the beginning( just like with\n\nthe playsets sold in the US by W Berrie) they were made in W Germany. Therefore\n\nyou got the white flowers with the playsets also in those english boxes.\n\nGarden Playset 1\n\nContained both green and brown germanmade parts.\n\nSame box but Hongkong marked and this one contained Hongkongmade parts.\n\nFence Playset 2\n\nGermanmade parts inside. A Hongkongmade box could exist??\n\nGate Playset 3\n\nContained germanmade parts with white or yellow flower.\n\nHongkongmade box could exist. Not seen it yet though.\n\nMushroom Playset 4\n\nContains germanmade parts. White or yellow flowers.\n\nBoth these boxes contains white flowers.\n\nHongkongmade box could exist also then always with yellow flower.\n\nBoat Playset 5\n\nWhen they started selling this in Australia all parts were made in Hongkong.\n\nBP Petrol Pump Playset 6\n\nPlayset 6 was only released in the red german box and since they made a special super smurf\n\nbox for the National Benzole petrol pump in the UK and this playset never was sold in the\n\nUS, no large box with the roof existed. So a special BP box was made but I am not sure\n\nif it ever reached all the stations?? Everything in this box was made in Germany.\n\nWell Playset 7\n\nContains Hongkongmade parts.\n\nSnail Carriage Playset 8\n\nContains Hongkongmade parts.\n\nLarge smurf house and cottage\n\nBoth these ones are the same as the ones sold in the US.\n\nCottages sold with green or red roof and darkbrown doors.\n\nSmurfs\n\nOn these pictures you can look more closely on the different smurfs sold by BP. They go very\n\ngood with the information above and therefore I am 100% sure Flute, Mermaid, Police, CB\n\nFunker, Gardener, Jester, Diver, Superman, Torch, Surfer, Umbrella, Injured and Conductor\n\nwere sold in Australia by BP. Also the Have a Heart-smurf collecting money for children\n\nwas sold by BP. #1 Teacher could have been sold as seasonal figurine.\n\nHamburger is the only odd one here but could be correct or bought in a toystore after BP\n\nstopped. Since like in all countries after BP stopped with the smurfs, the trademark-rights\n\nended and shops could import smurfs from toydealers for the stores.\n\nA picture from a BP station somewhere in Australia in 1981"
