        "text": "CHAPTER THREE\n\nJEWS OF NEW ENGLAND, THE OLD SOUTHWEST, AND THE BORDER STATES\n\nTHE JEWS OF CONNECTICUT\n\nSeeking opportunity with a minimum of competition, many of the German immigrants of the late 1830’s moved out of New York City. Less than ten years after Albany had established the first congregation outside of the metropolis—in fact in only five years, 1840 to 1845—Jews succeeded in organizing themselves permanently in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. Jews were not newcomers in New England. New Amsterdam Jewish peddlers were knocking on doors in Hartford in the 1650’s. On at least one occasion a large Jewish family, passing through Connecticut in 1771, succeeded in collecting ten males for a service. Jacob Pinto was one of the petitioners in 1783 who sought the incorporation of the town of New Haven. The new Germans started coming into this city by the 1830’s but were, it would seem, not welcome. About the year 1840 there was a congregation in New Haven and a few years later in Hartford also. A New Haven newspaper of the 1840’s declared that “Yale College divinity deserves a court-martial for bad generalship” because it had not kept the Jews out of town. But not all New Havenites were hostile and when a synagog was dedicated in the next decade generous Christians helped it financially. In 1850, Dr. Joseph Goldmark, Louis Brandeis’s father-in-law to be, stopped off in New Haven to see Professor Agassiz, but was appalled by the blue laws of the pious Puritans: Sunday in New Haven was a death sentence. Not all Jews shared his prejudices; by 1881 one of the Germans was president of the Board of Education.\n\nNew Haven and Hartford were the only two Jewish communities of any size in the state before the coming of the East European Jews in the 1880’s. The total Jewish population in the state at that time may then have been less than 2,000. There were about fifteen towns in Connecticut which housed Jews; not one of these had as many as 100 Jewish inhabitants. Norwich was probably typical of these smaller settlements. The pioneer Jew arrived there in 1851 but the first organization was not established till 1878. It almost foundered before it came into being because of a bitter fight over the name of the proposed community. Was it to be a congregation, a lodge, or a society? Quite properly, Noah Webster’s Dictionary was consulted and the new group called itself the First Hebrew Society. It was a charity, worship, and burial association.1\n\nRHODE ISLAND JEWRY\n\nThe New England states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts have this in common: All three fashioned Jewish communities of a sort during the first five years of the 1840’s, yet all had sheltered Jewish settlers since the second half of the 1600’s. Rhode Island, however, was unique; it could boast of two earlier communities, neither of which had survived. Due to the influence of Roger Williams and his tolerant successors it was not difficult for the Jews of those early days to organize themselves and to worship publicly. Newport had an informal congregation in the period 1678 to 1685 and a well-organized synagogal group from about 1750 to the end of the century. The Salvation of Israel congregation met in the beautiful Peter Harrison sanctuary which was dedicated in 1763. Nineteenth-century Newport citizens never forgot the halcyon past when their town was one of the great American ports and when Aaron Lopez was Newport’s most distinguished merchant-shipper, “for honor and extent of commerce probably surpassed by no merchant in America.” Generations later the Newporters believed that prosperity would be restored to their deserted wharves with the return of the Jews. Thus when a Jewish peddler once came to town they licensed him, but when he desecrated the Sabbath by making his usual rounds they indignantly withdrew his right to peddle. Aaron Lopez had kept his warehouse closed from Friday sundown to Monday morning. The old Newport synagog was reconsecrated in 1883 with the coming of the East Europeans.\n\nWesterly, the Rhode Island-Connecticut bordertown on the Pawcatuck River, attracted a sprinkling of Jews by the 1870’s who settled there because of its textile industry and shipping. There is no evidence that they even attempted to conduct services. The only organized Jewish settlement in the state was in Providence which had a community of about 1,000 men, women, and children. There were two congregations in town but all told they sheltered but 105 members (ca. 1877). Practically all the Jews of Rhode Island had crowded into that one town, a very important manufacturing center. Providence’s Jewish Pilgrim Father, the Holland-born Sephardi, Solomon Pareira, arrived there in 1838 when Providence was a city of over 20,000. By the early 1840’s the Jews were numerous enough to meet in his home for services; in 1849 they had a cemetery; a few years later they had a congregation which proceeded to hire a man to serve as cantor, shohet, and teacher. This factotum was Joseph Spiro, a German-born talmudist who was paid $5.50 a week, a modest sum even in those days. A year later he had gone back to New York. Pareira was the president of the congregation; the secretary-treasurer was the Mexican War veteran, Jacob R. Hirschorn (Hershorn). Hirschorn, a Bavarian, had arrived in New York City in 1846 at the age of sixteen and soon enlisted in a regiment of New York Volunteers. Because of his knowledge of French and German he was put in the quartermaster corps and did an excellent job as a forager in Mexico. On the way home he was stricken with yellow fever in New Orleans and was carried to La Charité where the good sisters nursed him tenderly and tried to save his immortal but infidel soul by reading him edificatory Catholic tracts. He survived unconverted to return to New York and later to Providence where he married one of Pareira’s daughters who bore him ten children. In Providence he made his way at first by retailing hosiery; later he and a partner were in the embroidery business.\n\nWhen in need Jews in town could always turn to the congregation but by 1877 the first social-welfare society was set up as the charity arm of the community. The Montefiore Lodge Ladies Hebrew Benevolent Association was a mutual-aid, religious, sick, and burial association which enjoyed the ministrations of two coeval presidents, a “gentlemen” and a “lady.”2\n\nMASSACHUSETTS JEWRY\n\nProvidence was the second largest city of New England; Boston was the largest and for centuries had been one of America’s leading ports. Jewish merchants had been in and out of it ever since the day when Solomon Franco landed in 1649, yet it had no formal Jewish community until about the year 1843. In 1733 the handful of Jews had even bought ground for a cemetery but it disappeared after a couple of decades. Although there is no evidence, private religious services were probably held in town in the 1830’s. It is not easy to understand why native and immigrant Jews avoided this metropolis which already had a hundred thousand inhabitants in the 1840’s before the Jews began to settle there. It is true Massachusetts was a conservative state; the constitution was not liberalized as far as Jews were concerned till 1833. There were economic reasons as well: few European packets and steamers selected Boston as a terminus; the capital-poor Jews could not hope to engage in shipping or merchandising, and the Erie Canal after 1825 made New York a more desirable haven for migrants. Jews held their first service in Boston in 1842; the following year this group of humble artisans and shopkeepers—Germans for the most part—organized the Lovers of Peace, Congregation Ohabei Shalom. By 1844 the Jews had purchased a burial ground after which there came a ritual bathhouse (mikveh) for the women and later an all-day school where Hebrew and the basic secular subjects were taught, probably in German.\n\nWithin a decade the Jewish newcomers had begun to settle in a number of other places in the state and by the 1870’s they were well ensconced in New Bedford, Fall River, Worcester, Springfield, and elsewhere. They were careful to pick the ports, the rivertowns, and manufacturing centers that were also served by railroads. Leopold Morse, an eighteen-year-old Bavarian, opened a clothing store in New Bedford about the year 1850. Shortly thereafter he moved to Boston where he became one of the largest clothiers in town. In 1870 he entered politics, and although he lived in a rock-ribbed Republican district he was sent to Congress in 1877 as a Democrat and served for five terms. Although he was not affiliated with any synagogal group, the first Jewish old-folks home and orphanage in New England was established through his generosity. After his death it was called the Leopold Morse Home for Infirm Hebrews and Orphanage. His younger brother Godfrey followed him from the Bavarian Palatinate, went to Harvard where he edited the Harvard Advocate, and served as manager of the first crew that rowed against Oxford; by 1883 he was president of the Boston Common Council.\n\nThe census of Massachusetts Jewry taken in 1876 showed 8,500 Jews in Massachusetts, 7,000 of whom were in Boston. This was a tremendous growth in a period of less than thirty years. There were at least ten congregations in Boston, two literary associations, a Y.M.H.A., a musical congeries, a city-wide United Hebrew Benevolent Association, and a Hebrew Ladies Sewing Society. There were also several Jewish literary and musical organizations. The fact that mid-century Boston was the cultural “hub” of this country may have been of some influence in furthering Jewish groups of this type in Boston, but it is well to bear in mind that there was no Jewish community of size anywhere in the United States that did not set up formal literary or musical associations. In this characteristic effort the Germanic influence was probably determining.3\n\nMAINE JEWRY\n\nCongregation Ohabei Shalom of Boston, the mother synagog of Massachusetts and of northern New England, had its beginnings in a Jewish New Year service in 1842 at the home of Peter Spitz. Haiman Philip Spitz, his brother, was also one of the charter members of this congregation. Seven years later a group of Jews assembled in Haiman’s home, then in Bangor, Maine, and established the first synagog in that state. When Haiman came to Maine he was of course not its first Jew. Individuals had been drifting into a number of cities and villages ever since the Revolution. The earliest Jewish settler of whom there is any known record was Susman Abrams, a German from Hamburg who lived in Waldoborough, Thomaston, and Union near the coast where he owned and ran a tannery yard. Like other small town Jewish pioneers he married a Christian and attended Christian services. Haiman Spitz was a Prussian Pole who had come to New York via England and had turned to the manufacture of clothing, selling many of his products in the South. When he was about twenty-four years of age he moved to New Orleans; later at the time of the Mexican War he enlisted in the army serving under General Zachary Taylor. After the Mexicans were defeated he went back North and made his home in Bangor where he was joined by his brothers Peter and Julius. Bangor, a good-sized town in the 1840’s, was the lumber center of the world, connected by water to the principal east coast ports and by railroad, via Waterville, to all the cities of New England and the Atlantic tidewater.\n\nBangor’s Ahavat Ahim, Brotherly Love, was a typical all-purpose pioneer organization providing religious services, eleemosynary aid, care of the sick, and burial. The functionary hired for $175 a year was expected to chaunt the liturgy, provide ritually-slaughtered beef and fowl, teach the children, circumcise the infants, sit with the sick, and be the “servant” of the community. Influenced possibly by their Puritan neighbors the congregants expelled a member of the synagog who was living with a woman who was not his wife. Such surveillance of personal morals was untypical in immigrant conventicles. The congregation did not continue uninterrupted. Either competition from the new timberlands of Michigan and Wisconsin or the early onset of the panic of 1857 shattered the Maine lumber trade and drove the handful of Jewish peddlers, dry goods merchants, and clothiers out of business. The congregation closed its doors in 1856 or 1857 and shipped its Scroll of the Law and ritual silver to Ohabei Shalom in Boston for safekeeping. Some time in the 1870’s an entirely new set of worshippers reorganized Ahavat Ahim and retrieved the Sefer Torah from its Boston caretakers.\n\nBy 1876 there were about 500 to 600 Jews in Maine, most of them in the four larger towns of Portland, Bangor, Lewiston, and Waterville. They had begun to make their appearance in the 1860’s in order to take advantage of the opportunities in those ports and towns where shipping, fishing, and the manufacture of textiles and machinery had begun to flourish. By 1874 there was a formal community in Portland. The Jews here had clustered around the B’nai B’rith lodge which also conducted religious services and looked after the needy. Lewiston and Waterville had sufficient numbers to pray with a formal quorum but there is no evidence that congregations were forged. In the southern and western part of the state, in Bucksport near Bangor and in Sanford near Portland, there was a handful of Jews and far over to the east, on the other side of the state, German Jewish immigrants had settled in Houlton, Pembroke, and in the important commercial city of Eastport. In all probability these businessmen opened shops there with an eye to the trade in the neighboring Canadian province of New Brunswick.4\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE JEWRY\n\nWhen the eighteen-year-old Leopold Morse arrived in the United States from Wachenheim in Bavaria someone shipped him out to Sandwich, New Hampshire, an upcountry town many miles from nowhere. There must have been opportunities there in 1849 or his wholesaler would not have dispatched him to that spot. At least he learned English, for there was probably not another Jew or German in the place. In general Jews were few and far between in the Granite State; they avoided it, unhappy with the fact that Jews as non-Christians were disabled politically. When the last restrictions against their holding office were finally abolished in 1877 there were fewer than 200 Jews in all New Hampshire.\n\nThe first Jews came to Portsmouth during the Revolution but they did not remain there. They were birds of passage, West Indians, or French, who owned or captained privateers which preyed upon British shipping. After the war, a Prussian Jewish couple opened a shop and prospered. Despite the fact that Abraham Isaac and his wife kept their store closed on Saturdays, or mayhap because they kept it closed on their Sabbath, people respected them and patronized them. On Isaac’s death in 1803 this Jew, the only one of his tribe in town, was buried in the Christian cemetery. His fellow townsman, the poet Jonathan Mitchell Sewall wrote the epitaph which closed with these words:\n\nThrough various toils his active spirit ran,\n\nA faithful steward and an honest man.\n\nHis soul, we trust, now freed from mortal woes\n\nFinds in the patriarch’s bosom sweet respose.\n\nSergeant-Major Abraham Cohn of the 6th New Hampshire Volunteers was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor “for conspicuous gallantry displayed in the battle of the Wilderness, Virginia, in rallying and forming under heavy fire, disorganized troops; also for bravery and coolness in carrying orders to the advance lines under murderous fire.” This immigrant who began his military career as a common soldier rose through the ranks ultimately to become the regimental adjutant, the colonel’s right-hand man, because of his linguistic skills and his ability to command the respect of his associates. He may well have been an obscure businessman, a clerk or a peddler in New Hampshire, when he enlisted in 1864 under Colonel, later General, S. G. Griffin.\n\nIn the decade of the 1870’s there were two or three families in Northumberland and Groveton, far to the north on or near the Connecticut River; in the capital city of Concord on the Merrimack there were but two Jews; and even in Portsmouth on the Atlantic Coast there were only twenty-nine men, women, and children in 1876. In this, the second largest city in the state, there were probably ten Jews above the age of thirteen but no community was shaped. Two smaller towns, Rochester and Great Falls, up the Salmon River from Portsmouth, could together muster fifty-three Jews, twenty of whom were gainfully employed. It may be assumed that a substantial number were young peddlers who used Rochester and Great Falls as their home base while scouring the countryside for business. Now that the Yankee peddlers had gone west, a German-accented Jew could hope to survive. In 1857 the Great Falls contingent with the aid of the Rochestrians, established a burial society—the only formal Jewish organization in all New Hampshire. But why active in these two particular mill towns? Was there no economic balm in the other villages of New Hampshire? No one but the peddler himself knew why he singled out a special spot. He had his reasons, probably, and unless he wrote his memoirs—and told the truth—there is no way to determine his motivations. Post-eventum reflections may be entirely wrong. Why were there at that time no Jews in Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city?5\n\nVERMONT JEWRY\n\nThere were very few Jews in New Hampshire; there were even fewer in Vermont. The Jewish census of 1876 put the total number of Jews in the Green Mountain State at 119. Obviously the Central Europeans who were coming down the gangplank at Castle Garden felt that there were better opportunities elsewhere. The first permanent Jewish settler of whom anything is known is Joshua Montefiore, and if he was not the first Jew in Vermont, he was certainly the most distinguished one. Joshua was the uncle of Sir Moses Montefiore, the world’s most respected Jew in the nineteenth century. Uncle Joshua was a little bit of everything—lawyer, soldier, author, editor, farmer, and above all, adventurer. After he became a solicitor and notary public in London of the 1780’s he left for Jamaica where he sought to practice his profession. He was not permitted to hang out his shield for his fellow-attorneys barred the way, pointing to an Island law of 1711 which forbade Jews, mulattos, Indians, and Negroes to assume any civil or political office. Disappointed Joshua returned to England and satisfied his martial spirit by becoming a soldier in an expedition that set out in the early 1790’s to colonize an African island off the coast of Sierra Leone without the use of slave labor. When that expedition failed he returned home and began to write commercial manuals and legal compendia. In this he was quite successful; his books were popular, useful, and widely read. Obviously he was an able and competent man. No later than 1811, he came to this country after wandering about in many Southern European lands and fighting in the West Indies during the Napoleonic wars. When he landed in Philadelphia he was already a man of forty-nine. Here in the United States he continued to publish his works and, for a time, edited a weekly which was subsidized by the British government.\n\nHe drifted about going as far west as Indiana before he decided to settle down as a farmer in St. Albans, Vermont, near the Canadian border. Moses Montefiore, his nephew, sent him money regularly. The elderly Joshua was to end his life as a “remittance man.” At seventy-three years of age this widower, still stouthearted, married a young woman, a Christian, and before he died in 1843 he had fathered eight children. His youngest was born when he was about eighty years of age. The children were reared as Christians but he was buried on his own farm as a Jew in a ritual ceremony which he had prepared.\n\nSt. Albans was to have its day in the sun in 1864 when a group of Confederate soldiers coming in from Canada raided the city, looted the banks, and fled back toward the border. It was during the 1860’s that Jews began to enter Vermont and to create their first community. Among those who made their appearance at this time was Herman Seligson who enlisted in Middlebury, in 1862, in the 9th Regiment of Vermont Volunteers, infantrymen. He was a diminutive, black-haired Prussian who gave his occupation as a “salesman.” (Peddlers were also salesmen.) A month after he enlisted he was elected as first lieutenant, and before the year was over he was detached from his command and put in charge of a mountain howitzer battery. By the first of January, 1863, he was made captain, and before he was separated from the service in 1865 he had served as a division provost marshal and, finally, as regimental commander of the 9th Vermont with the rank of lieutenant colonel. For an immigrant youth to rise from private to regimental commander while still in his early twenties was quite an achievement even in those days when George Armstrong Custer became a major general at the age of twenty-five.\n\nIt is not improbable that some Jews may have crossed over into Vermont from Canada, for by the late 1870’s there was a handful in Charleston, not too far from the Province of Quebec. In Burke, somewhat farther south, there were almost enough for a religious quorum, but this group may have wandered up from the south, up the Connecticut River, through Connecticut and Massachusetts, into Vermont, and then northward by way of the Passumpsic River. Charleston and Burke were remote towns with populations of about 1,000 each. It is worthy of note that in Vermont, as in New Hampshire, these early peddlers and modest shopkeepers bypassed the large cities. In 1876 no Jews were reported in Burlington, the largest town in the state. Actually Nathan Lamport, a Polish immigrant, was already there in 1874; before he died in 1928 he was to become a distinguished New York City businessman and a generous giver to Orthodox institutions. Montpelier, the capital city, reported but two Jews. Obviously the humble immigrants who came in the 1860’s and on believed that they would fare better in the villages. Many of the Central Europeans who did enter the state ended up in one county in western Vermont, near the New York border, in the two towns of Rutland and Poultney. Some may have come most of the way from New York on the Hudson; others may have used the train connections with Albany, Boston, and New York City. By 1876 at least half of the Jews in Vermont were in this one county. Most were in Poultney, the smaller of the towns, and it was here that Congregation Benai Israel was established in 1867. Why settle down in Poultney, a town of some 3,000 or less? A few Jews planted their residences there and later newcomers agglomerated around them; Jews are lonely people. The place became a peddlers’ center and Jews from Fair Haven and even Bristol, forty miles away, came in for the Holy Days. When they arrived they found not only Rutland County Jews but some from the neighboring New York towns of Granville and Hartford. The congregation was thus a regional one as was the cemetery that was purchased in 1873.\n\nIt is doubtful whether there were ever more than twenty householders who participated in the services. They met in a private home over the second floor of a Jewish-owned store and conducted services on the New Moon and the Holy Days. Not all was peace and harmony. On one occasion a group of Jews who came to town to worship refused to pay the one dollar fee and raised such a disturbance that the police had to be called in. By the time the troublemakers got out of court the fines they paid were five times as large as the modest admission charge of the synagogal fathers. In 1872 the members allowed themselves the luxury of secession and for a year there were two separate conventicles in the county. The congregants were mostly Germans, probably Bavarians, in view of their indiscriminate interchange of “b’s” and “p’s.” Judging from the extant minutes they were rather literate in German; their Hebrew and their Yiddish transliterations of Hebraic terms left something to be desired, but they were a pious lot and devoted to their ancestral traditions. In conducting synagogal business they hewed to the American line and, following parliamentary rules, took care that every motion should be properly “gemowed.” The names of those who were born and who died were recorded for most of the years from 1874 to 1891. The list of “Birds” beginning in 1866 turned out to be a list of “Births.”6\n\nJEWS IN THE OLD SOUTHWEST\n\nALABAMA JEWRY\n\nThe 1840’s may not have been a fabulous decade for American Jews but it is clear that those years were important, very important. By that time the entire eastern half of the country was settled, with the exception of Michigan and Wisconsin in the North and Florida in the South. As the cotton culture shifted westward with the planters and slaves, farmers and shopkeepers, the native and immigrant Jews, moved too. A generation later, by the 1870’s, there were more Jews in the Gulf states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas than in all of New England, and this despite a devastating Civil War and the uncertainty of the Reconstruction years. The lure of new opportunities drew able men from the Atlantic tidewater to the new cotton lands of the Old Southwest. The move west began in the 1820’s extending all the way from Georgia to Texas. Philip Phillips, Solomon Heydenfeldt, and Aaron Lopez, all three Charlestonians, settled in Mobile in the short period from 1834 to 1841. Not yet thirty years of age, Phillips soon became one of the leading citizens of the state and was sent to Congress in 1853. He remained in Washington after he refused to run again for office and was speedily recognized as one of the great lawyers of his day. By the time he passed away in 1884 he had pleaded about 400 cases before the United States Supreme Court. Heydenfeldt served as a judge in Talapoosa County before he pushed on to California where he was the first man to be elected to the state Supreme Court by the vote of the people; Aaron Lopez, a descendant of the well-known Newport family, practiced medicine in Mobile, pioneered in the field of mental health, and became a vice president of the American Medical Association.7\n\nMobile on the Gulf was the chief Jewish settlement in Alabama during antebellum days. Jewish traders had lived in the town under the English in the 1760’s but no community was organized till 1841, in the decade that Mobile was to become the second largest cotton market in the world. The group called itself Congregation Gates of Heaven and He That Considereth the Poor, Shaarai Shomayim u-Maskil el Dol (Ps.41:2). Among the founders were the two Jones brothers from London. It was they, probably, who suggested that cumbrous names which reflect Anglo-Jewish religious and philanthropic institutions and traditions. The Joneses started out modestly as cleaners of clothes (second-hand clothes?) and became merchants, politicians, communal workers, and business entrepreneurs. Israel L. Jones, once acting-mayor, brought the streetcars to Mobile, and Solomon I., his brother, was treasurer of Alabama’s Grand Lodge of Odd Fellows, a leader in the fire department, an alderman, a port warden, and a lieutenant colonel in the militia. Both brothers were very interested in the new congregation. Israel was president and Solomon was a trustee despite the fact that his wife was a member of a local Episcopal church where she was inscribed in the rolls as a “Jewess.” Either she was of Jewish birth or she was born Christian but dubbed Jewish by virtue of her marriage. Israel was also president of the Mobile Musical Association. Joseph Bloch and Sigmund Schlesinger, Germans, were well-known local musicians. Bloch ran a music store, published sheet music, and taught music in a local Catholic college; Schlesinger wrote Civil War songs and a series of services for the Reform synagog. He was one of the country’s first composers of modern settings for the Jewish liturgy. In his compositions he followed the German Protestant tradition and did not hesitate to borrow frequently from Italian operatic writers such as Verdi. A whole generation of American Jews was thrilled by his vibrant, dramatic, occidental melodies.8\n\nMontgomery was the only other Alabama Jewish settlement of any importance in the mid-nineteenth century. Jewish beginnings in the Montgomery area go back to the 1780’s when the Pennsylvanian Abram or Abraham Mordecai settled there. That was a generation before Alabama was admitted to the Union, when it was still part of Georgia, then one of the largest states in the Union. Mordecai was a son of a Jewish father and a German Christian mother. He fought in the Revolution, drifted south, and became a trader among the Indians in what is today Alabama. He worked with the Indian agents around the turn of the century, ransomed whites taken captive by the Creeks in the Kentucky forays, fought in the War of 1812, married an Indian African woman, and raised a brood of children. He bought his supplies at Augusta, Pensacola, New Orleans, and Mobile, trading furs, roots, and cotton cultivated by the sedentary Indians; he built the first cotton gin in his part of the country. Though not without some education he was a rough and earthy frontiersman, feuding with the Indians who once clubbed him unconscious, left him for dead, and cut off one of his ears. The United States agent in the Creek Nation rated him as a “bad character.”\n\nMordecai was not uninterested in Jews. Like his older contemporary, James Adair, who also traded with the southern Indians, he believed that the Indians were descendants of the Lost Ten Tribes and still preserved Jewish religious traditions. Frontiersmen like Mordecai paved the way for the first squatters but they built no synagogs. It remained for the German émigrés who came to Montgomery from the 1830’s and on to establish the first congregation in 1846. This was the Society for Visiting the Sick, Chevra Mevacher Cholim, a religious organization that provided worship facilities as well as sick-care and burial. Christians came from long distances to watch Jews as they prayed; they were a curiosity. By 1849 after the Jewish community had more than doubled it called itself Kahl Montgomery, Montgomery Congregation. Among the members were the Lehmans, founders of the family that in a later generation would stand out in the financial and political life of New York.\n\nKahl Montgomery had a number of notable rabbis, including James K. Gutheim, a fiery Confederate patriot who refused to take the oath of loyalty to the federal government in New Orleans, and Adolph Moses who had fought as a Red Shirt under Garibaldi in the Italian liberation war. Moses left Montgomery to serve Mobile Jewry after the resignation of “Rabbi” Abraham Jaeger who, during his second year in the pulpit of Mobile, had become a Christian, joining the Southern Baptists. In 1873 Jaeger published an account in Chicago of his acceptance of Christianity, describing the psychological process that had impelled him to change his religion. He called it Mind and Heart in Religion, or, Judaism and Christianity. Kaufman Kohler, then the rabbi of Sinai in that city, examined the book and wrote to Jaeger: “I knew when you became a Christian that you had lost your heart, but now after reading this book I am convinced that you have also lost your mind.” In 1853 Claiborne on the Alabama River between Mobile and Selma had a congregation of fifteen members and a hired officiant. But when the railroads supplanted the steamboats and took over cotton transport, the congregation and the whole town died. Nothing was left; it was not even a ghost town. In the 1870’s there were over thirty villages and hamlets in the state with a handful of Jews. By that time Montgomery had passed Mobile; only four other places had congregations or societies: Selma, Uniontown, and Eufaula in the south, and Huntsville in the north. Birmingham, the future Pittsburgh of the South, had only twenty Jews.9\n\nMISSISSIPPI JEWRY\n\nIn the 1830’s and 1840’s adventurous Jews could steam north from Mobile up the Tombigbee River into eastern Mississippi into Columbus, go still farther west into Mississippi proper, up the Pascagoula to Meridian, or hug the Gulf Coast at Biloxi. A cemetery was laid out in that city in the early 1840’s. Meridian, a substantial community, had a congregation in the 1860’s; Columbus was organized much earlier, by the 1840’s, for Germans and Alsatians had already been drifting in for a decade. It was during the 1830’s that Colonel Chapman Levy, one of the South Carolina argonauts, moved into the Columbus area with his mother’s slaves and started planting cotton. As a nineteen-year-old, Levy had been admitted to the bar in Columbia, S.C. In 1812 he had been elected to the Carolina state legislature and had served in the War of 1812 as a captain of militia. During the Nullification Controversy of the 1830’s he had returned to the state House of Representatives as a strong Union man. On his way west to the rich cotton lands of Mississippi he had stopped long enough in Georgia to become a state senator. By then he was already Colonel Chapman Levy, an influential Democratic politician high in the counsels of the party leaders in Washington. By the time he died in 1850 he had moved still farther west to the village of Camden. There is no evidence that he was concerned with the developing Jewish communities of Mississippi.10\n\nThe rich counties in the state were not in the eastern but in the western section—the river counties. The largest number of Jewish settlements was on the Mississippi and up its tributaries. By the 1850’s Woodville, near the Louisiana border, had a congregation of sorts; Natchez in the adjoining county was the state’s largest town in the 1830’s when the Jews started arriving in larger numbers. Almost eighty years before these Germans, Alsatians, and Polanders arrived, the Monsantos of Louisiana were already doing business there; one of them had settled in Natchez in the 1790’s, farming and trading under the Spanish. Some time around the year 1840 the Central European newcomers established a burial society; by 1843 they had an organized community. During the Civil War the Yankees shelled the town but the only casualty was little Rosalie Beekman, age seven. When Vicksburg fell in July, 1863, Union soldiers occupied Natchez. The Jewish soldiers from the North were welcomed by the local foreign-born Jewish shopkeepers; their daughters, more ardent in their patriotism, rejected the advances of the Jewish Yankees although ultimately some of them married into local families and stayed in Mississippi. Acculturation had done its job well in Natchez as all through the South. Jacob Mayer of Natchez changed his first name to John; one of his older daughters had a good European name, Theresa, but a son born in 1864, in the heat of the War, went through life with the mouth-filling militant name, Joseph Eggleston Johnston Mayer. The Natchez Jewish maidens smuggled contraband goods through the Union lines in their hoopskirts. The Jewish quartermasters from the North who secured passes through the lines for the girls never realized that the billowy, bulging skirts covered socks, shirts, and trousers, to say nothing of shoes and boots for the brave boys in gray.11\n\nA sick-care and burial confraternity was founded in Port Gibson in the 1850’s. Eugene H. Levy, a son of Jack (Jacob) Levy, was born in Grand Gulf in 1840 and together with two brothers enlisted in Louisiana batteries and companies during the War. After the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, Eugene entered his father’s banking business in New Orleans, turned later to planting, and then went north to New York City where he lost his fortune during the depression of the 1880’s. But his education and skill as a writer made it possible for him to become a financial reporter and, finally, the owner of the Dixie Book Shop. He was a cultured gentleman highly esteemed by New York’s intelligentsia. Over 100 miles farther north up the Mississippi lay Greenville destined in the postbellum period to shelter the second largest Jewish settlement in the state. Like other towns Greenville testifies to the rise of the merchant class after the War and to the fall of the planter aristocracy. And as the bourgeois rose to power financially and politically the Jews rose with them. Greenville Jews were worshipping together, meeting at the local B’nai B’rith Lodge in the 1870’s. Below Greenville lies Mayersville, the county seat of Issaquena County, named after the businessman David Mayer. The big town in the next county to the south was Vicksburg which housed the largest synagog in the state. By the 1870’s there were over 500 Jews, many of them shopkeepers, in town; Greenville had over 300; Natchez over 200. Meridian, Canton, Port Gibson, and Columbus were still smaller, and there were at least twenty to thirty other villages where Jewish groups had established themselves. Many of the settlers had come up the river by way of New Orleans; they peddled, opened stores, and then moved on as the river traffic gave way to the railroads. Vicksburg was an important steamboat, railroad, and cotton-shipping point in the mid-nineteenth century. A burial society was established there in 1841, but it was not until 1870, a generation later, that a synagog was dedicated.12\n\nVicksburg, like Montgomery and Mobile, attracted a number of interesting rabbis during its heyday. The Rev. Bernhard Henry Gotthelf, who had served the Union Army as a hospital chaplain in the Louisville area, received a call from the Vicksburg congregation after the Civil War. He officiated with distinction until carried off by the yellow-fever epidemic of 1878. One of his successors—this was in 1883—was Herman Milton Bien who was born in Germany and had received a good Jewish education in the Cassel teachers’ seminary. After he came to the United States in 1854, a young man of twenty-three, he went into business but soon wound up in San Francisco with a private school of his own. When the school closed because of the accidental death of one of his charges, he accepted a rabbinical position. His headgear in the synagog attracted attention; following the prescription in Leviticus for the high priest he, too, wore a tall linen mitre on which he had inscribed in Hebrew, Sacred to the Lord (Lev. 16:4). Before he left San Francisco he published Jewish periodicals and when that venture also failed he crossed the border to Virginia City, Nevada, where he opened a private school and sat in the territorial legislature and later in the state assembly. He then returned east to New York City where he edited German and Jewish weeklies. His next shop was at Port Henry, on the shores of Lake Champlain. There he finally engaged in business successfully and settled down to married life. But yearning for the world of books he took rabbinic positions in Chicago and Dallas before accepting the pulpit in Vicksburg where he spent the last years of his life. Bien was a prolific writer. He fancied himself an intellectual and indeed he was a man of education and culture. Maybe he was competing with his brother Julius, an eminent lithographer, map engraver, and international president of the B’nai B’rith. Herman wrote and published sermons, poetry, dramas, plays for Purim and Hanukkah, and a novel Ben Beor to counter the lurid tales of the Wandering Jew written by Eugene Sue and other Christian writers. The title Ben Beor was chosen with Lew Wallace’s Ben-Hur in mind. Ben-Hur sold close to 2,000,000 copies; Ben Beor probably never sold as many as 2,000 copies. The career of Bien is important historically because it is typical of the educated German Jewish immigrant who wandered everywhere, tried his hand at everything, and frequently succeeded at nothing. Bien was a litterateur, a violinist, a pianist, a poet, and a frustrated unhappy man; he committed suicide.13\n\nARKANSAS JEWRY\n\nFor a stretch of almost 200 miles in Mississippi one can look across the Father of Waters and see Arkansas. Jews had begun settling in Arkansas Territory ever since 1823 when it was true frontier sheltering fewer than two people per square mile. It is eloquent testimony to the enterprise of Jews that at least nine Arkansas villages have been named after them despite the fact that as late as 1880 they numbered less than one-fourth of 1 percent of the total population. Abeles, Altheimer, Berger, Bertig, Felsenthal, Goldman, Levy, and Wiener is not the roster of a German turnverein but a list of Arkansas place-names. Arkansas Jewish settlers of the antebellum generation were not usually American born but were Central European emigrants. After their arrival in America some traveled down the Ohio and Mississippi from the North; most, however, started out from New Orleans and, it would seem, ascended the Mississippi, turned off to the left in Louisiana, and climbed the Ouachita and Red Rivers into Arkansas. Still others continued up the Mississippi into the state and then veered to the left working their way up the Arkansas and White Rivers. In the days before the railroad supplanted the steamboat, rivers and canals were the most frequented highways in America.\n\nOne of the first Arkansas Jewish pioneers was one of the numerous Blocks who had moved from Maryland, Virginia, and Ohio to Missouri; this one, Abraham Bloch, kept on going down until he came to the mouth of the Red River. He pushed toward the Upper Red River country and finally around 1823 he settled in Washington, Hempstead County. By then Bloch was already forty-three years old and had been in this country for more than two decades. Throughout his years in the Arkansas back counties till his death in 1857, he kept in touch with the Jewish world by reading Leeser’s Occident. The Mitchells of Little Rock, Galicians by birth, were also territorial pioneers. They may have come as early as 1830. There were three brothers; one of them, Dr. Jacob Mitchell, was an Indian herb doctor who practiced for a time in Nashville, Tennessee, where he helped found the young community in 1848. The Mitchells were merchants who dabbled in anything that spelled profit; they ran a stagecoach line to Hot Springs where they had hotel interests. A branch of the Mitchell business was established at Fort Smith, on the border of Indian Territory.14\n\nJust six miles away from Fort Smith lies the town of Van Buren. Like Fort Smith it traded with the Indians in the neighboring territory and served as an outfitting point in the 1850’s for settlers taking the southern route to California. The Baers and Adlers were in business in this small place selling merchandise although they did some farming also. One of the Adlers, Samuel, went east to marry a Sulzberger in Philadelphia; his pious father-in-law insisted that the young man learn ritual slaughtering so that his daughter might eat kosher food on the Indian frontier. Samuel Adler and Sarah Sulzberger’s son Cyrus grew up to become America’s most influential communal worker in the first third of the twentieth century. The Adlers lived on the western edge of the state; the Hirsches lived on the White River in northeastern Arkansas. Eighteen-year-old Aaron Hirsch arrived in New Orleans in 1847 and joined his brother who lived in a village near Natchez. Aaron peddled for several years; his ability to speak French earned him a welcome at some of the plantations. That made him a compatriot of Lafayette and Rochambeau! He crossed the Mississippi River and moved up into the interior to Batesville where in the course of about ten years he built up the largest merchandising establishment in northern Arkansas. “We had for sale everything from a needle to a farmer’s wagon, horses and mules, and occasionally bought and sold a few slaves.” The Hirsches also ran a four-horse stage to a neighboring town. In the postwar period when Batesville was bypassed by the railroad, Aaron moved down the White River to Newport and gave the Episcopalians the ground for their first church.\n\nIt was not until the late 1860’s, after the War, that the German Jews started coming in numbers to Arkansas. Little Rock certainly had a religious quorum before the War, for a burial society was put together in 1860, the very year that Jonas Levy was elected mayor of the town. The congregation was formed in 1866. A year later, Pine Bluff, down the Arkansas below Little Rock, set up its congregation, and by 1869 Louis Altheimer had settled there. Altheimer was only thirteen years of age when he and his sixteen-year-old cousin Simon Bamberger landed in New York City in 1863. Simon was one day to become governor of Utah; Louis was destined to become a wealthy merchant and planter. After Altheimer had learned English on an Indiana farm, he went to Mississippi and opened a grocery store. He was then a mature youngster of fifteen years. But business was bad and he went west to Nebraska following the tracklayers of the Union Pacific. He built a portable store and shifted it ever westward till the tracks reached Cheyenne. By that time he was tired of wandering; he missed the trees and he dreaded the hard winters. Before leaving Germany he had read Friedrich Gerstaecker’s book on America and Arkansas. That was the state! He went back to Europe, married a girl there, and then returned to settle down in Pine Bluff. By the turn of the century he was a wealthy businessman and planter owning thousands of acres of farm land. When the Arkansas overflowed its banks and the heavy rains ruined his crop he was in trouble, but, with the help of a son, he recouped his losses through the Altheimer Dry Goods Company in Little Rock which soon boasted of its seventy employees. He had branch stores in other towns, including Altheimer which he and his brother had founded in 1885.15\n\nIn the late 1870’s when Louis Altheimer was making his mark, there were at the most 2,000 fellow Jews in the state scattered in about thirty towns. Most of the villages had fewer than twenty Jews, almost half of Arkansas Jewry lived in Little Rock. Six towns had established communities: Little Rock, Pine Bluff, Helena on the Mississippi, Camden on the Ouachita, Fort Smith, and Texarkana sitting astride the borders of Arkansas and Texas. In 1876 the Jewish businessmen in Texarkana turned to their fellow citizen Charles Goldberg and asked him to conduct services for them. He agreed to do so. Goldberg, a Pole, came to the United States in the 1840’s and peddled in the Missouri River Valley till he fell sick. Nursed back to health by a Christian family and importuned by a clergyman he became a convert and prepared himself for the Presbyterian ministry. When the Civil War erupted he left his charge in Texas to become a chaplain in the Confederate Army, the only “Jewish” chaplain to serve the South. After the War he officiated in towns in Texas and Arkansas including Washington, Abraham Block’s village. Then when the railroads built Texarkana in 1873, Goldberg soon became the city’s Presbyterian minister and one of its first school teachers. Thus it was that the Rev. Charles Goldberg of the Pine Street Presbyterian Church was available to preach to the Jewish congregation during the High Holy Days; when one of the local boys wanted to become bar mitzvah Goldberg prepared him. He never sought to convert his former coreligionists. Jewish tradition would have it that on his death bed he called the Jews to his home, read the Shema, and asked them to bury him in their cemetery. The Christians in town vigorously deny this, yet it is interesting to note that he lies at rest today not in the Pine Street Presbyterian Church burial ground but in a nondenominational cemetery.16\n\nLOUISIANA JEWRY\n\nIn his appeal in 1825 for funds for Cincinnati, Joseph Jonas wrote that if it had a synagog hundreds of Jews would come up from New Orleans for Holy Day services. If there were hundreds of Jews at that time in New Orleans, why then did they not create a congregation of their own? Jews had been in and out of the city for a long time. Six years after Bienville founded the town in 1718 he promulgated a Black Code which contained an article expelling Jews. But this is in no sense proof that there were any Jews in town. All that the governor had done was to republish a 1685 Black Code which was originally issued to regulate slavery in the French West Indies and to expel the Jews who were then living there. The governor had not bothered to remove the anti-Jewish clause which was not relevant in the New Orleans of 1724. It was not until the French and Indian War that Jews began to find their way into the Spanish city. Dutch-born Isaac Rodrigues Monsanto arrived in 1775 and was soon followed by his family. As merchant-shippers the Monsantos carried on trade south along the Gulf Coast, into the Caribbean to the Islands, east to Europe and, closer to home, north up the Mississippi to the Illinois Country. A year or two after the coming of the first Monsanto some English Jews from the British West Indies sailed up the river under the specious pretext of exchanging prisoners. Actually they were traders seeking to do business with beleaguered New Orleans, desperately in need of goods and provisions. By 1759 or 1760 there may have been enough Jews to conduct a service; there is no evidence that they did.\n\nAfter 1803 when New Orleans became American the town began an economic expansion that within a generation was to make it the second largest port in the South. Hundreds and thousands moved into the city to take advantage of its worldwide trade. Jews from the States, from Europe, the Islands, and even from Mexico bent their steps to the new El Dorado. By the 1820’s there were more than enough Jews in town for a good-sized community but many were indifferent and others were intermarried, hampered in their Jewish affiliation by a Christian wife and Christian children. The catalyst arrived in the person of Jacob S. Solis, an English-born Jew who in 1827 or 1828 founded the first Jewish congregation in town, the Gates of Mercy, Shanarai-Chasset. The synagogal constitution published in 1828 is interesting for it reflects a “frontier” community. The first president Manis Jacobs, though devoted to his task, was himself intermarried. Provision was made for interment in the newly purchased cemetery of Christian wives and children, suicides, and even the occasional adulteress. Those who joined the congregation constituted but a fraction of the potential membership and were outnumbered by donors who refused to become members in a formal sense. Among those who gave but kept their distance was the pioneer merchant Judah Touro, now an old-timer who had been in the city for about twenty-seven years. Why were so many Jews unconcerned about their people and their faith? No one answer is adequate. No one will ever really know why an individual refuses to identify with his tradition and his group. Words such as “alienation,” “rebellion,” “assimilation” explain nothing. For many Judaism—its obligations and practices—had always been a burden. In a wide-open town like New Orleans, with its freedoms and opportunities, there was but one goal, wealth, power, recognition, and the drive to that end moved the humblest Jewish shopkeeper as it did the brilliant Judah P. Benjamin.\n\nAmong those who neither joined nor contributed was Samuel Hart. His will is eloquent testimony to a form of Americanization that was not unique. He was a Galician Jew who had come to the United States, probably by way of England, where he had picked up the typical Anglo-Jewish name of Hart. Two of his brothers back in Poland bore the good English name of Robinson. By 1823 Hart was already a man of substance; he owned one-half of the steamboat “United States,” four Negro slaves, $20,000 in bank stock, and two lots in Louisville. Had he once lived in that town and then moved down the river to lusher pastures? Apparently he had a slave mistress and a mulatto child for he made ample provision for them. In 1832, on the eve of death, when he rewrote his will nothing was said of Polly and her son; he was now anxious to endow the four children of Cecilia Beni, a woman of color. One of the boys bore his name, Samuel. Hart had traveled a long way, spiritually and culturally, from the little Orthodox Jewish village of Stry in Galicia.17\n\nNew Orleans was the staging area for European immigrants who settled in the lower Mississippi Valley in the states of Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and East Texas. It was the most important town in the Old Southwest, an ever-expanding commercial center until the 1850’s when the railroads began diverting its river traffic. The Crescent City benefited from the fanning out of brilliant Charleston Jews. Some went to Georgia and even to northwest Florida, others pressed on to Alabama, Mississippi, and to Louisiana, to New Orleans. Three friends, all remarkable men, were part of this Push to the West. They were Judah P. Benjamin, his cousin Henry Michael Hyams, and Dr. Edwin Warren Moïse. In the 1850’s these three were among the most powerful leaders in the state. Benjamin was in the Senate; Hyams, banker, landowner, able lawyer, was lieutenant-governor; Moïse, physician-turned-lawyer, was Speaker of the Louisiana House.\n\nHad these three men remained in Charleston would they have achieved the success which distinguished them in their new Louisiana homes? All three intermarried and were accepted in the best social circles. Was this assimilation a precondition for acceptance? In a state where the Jewish vote was inconsequential these three achieved a dominant position, not because they assimilated but because of their superb talents. The Parisian visitor Baron Solomon de Rothschild referred to Benjamin as “perhaps the greatest mind on this continent.” He also wrote that all these men had Jewish sympathies. It is true that none of them converted, but it is equally true that none affiliated with a synagog. Hyams was the only one of the three who was something of a “Jew.” In the 1820’s, before leaving Charleston, he had served as a secretary of the Reformed Society of Israelites, and there is evidence that throughout his life he never forgot his inherited Jewish faith. These three men were part of an elite group of Jews, both native and foreign born, professional men and brilliant entrepreneurs, who acquired wealth and power, intermarried, and played leading roles in the life of a great city. In contradistinction to Europe, the genius of America permitted these Jews to rise without submitting to baptism. The banker Michael Heine married a Creole but always remained a Jew; his Catholic-reared daughter Marie married the Duc de Richelieu and, after his death, the Prince of Monaco.18\n\nJews like Heine, Benjamin, Hyams, and Moïse did nothing for the Louisiana Jewish community as such. The humble European Jewish immigrants, the men and women ignored by them, built the Jewries of New Orleans and the backcountry. The start made in 1828 with the founding of Congregation Shanarai-Chasset was something to use as a base. Incoming Alsatians, Rhinelanders, Poseners, and East Europeans founded the present-day Jewish community of New Orleans. In the relatively short space of about fifty years New Orleans Jewry grew from about around two hundred unorganized Jews to a thriving community of about ten congregations and pious associations. The synagogs followed the German or the Polish rite and even the new Reform or American tradition. The New Orleans of the 1870’s might well brag of its 5,000 Jews, its sick-care and burial society, its men’s and its women’s charity associations, its hospital and old-folks home, its society for orphans and widows, its education and literary societies. There was a special organization to aid the poor of Jerusalem and only New Orleans had a Hebrew Foreign Mission Society dedicated to the furtherance of the unhappy Jews of China. Let the Christians send their missionaries to Africa; Rabbi Julius Eckman was ready to sail for China.19\n\nIn the decade of the 1870’s there were about 2,000 to 3,000 Jews in the upcountry. The pattern of settlement there created by the shotgun of accident and opportunity is not easy to trace. As in the rest of antebellum America, townsites on the river were inevitable and popular. The larger places were already settled by the 1850’s followed by a lull of activity because of the Civil War and its aftermath, but in the 1870’s there was a renewed push up the rivers and bayous. Newcomers leaving New Orleans went up the western bank of the Mississippi to Donaldsonville and Plaquemine and then veered to the eastern side at Baton Rouge. When the Jews established a congregation there in the 1850’s they numbered about a dozen families more or less. The town itself had a population of about 5,000 and was known for the beauty of its location and its surrounding sugar plantations. In those days Louisiana Jews would occasionally buy land and plant cotton but only a few, like the Lemanns of Donaldsonville, turned to sugar.20\n\nSugar was big business; it required a large capital expenditure for slaves, overseers, technicians, and machinery. Traditionally Jews preferred to remain in the buying and selling of soft goods, in urban commerce and industry. Back in the 1840’s Judah P. Benjamin had sunk huge sums in Bellechasse, a sugar plantation near New Orleans. He had practically given up the law, determined to become a planter, an aristocrat, and a gentleman. He was and remained a gentleman, but fate and ambition had decreed that he was not to remain a planter in spite of the brilliant effort he exerted to make Bellechasse a success and a showplace. Just about the time that Benjamin turned to planting, Antonio Mendez, one of the founders of the Louisiana sugar industry, passed away. He was born in 1750 in Havana but went north to Spanish New Orleans about the year 1784. One of the first things that he did there was to secure a “blood purity” or limpieza certificate to document that he was free from the taint of all “impure races” such as Jews, Moors, mulattoes and Indians. These statements were essential for those who wished to be socially acceptable and eligible for ecclesiastical offices; anyone having a drop of Jewish blood in his veins was prone to heresy. Mendez experimented with the manufacture of sugar which he began to produce in the 1790’s although not in commercial quantities. When the Americans took over Louisiana, the first governor, William C. C. Clairborne, appointed him in 1804 as a civil commandant of a district, but the Spaniards there hesitated to acknowledge his authority because of his “Jewish extraction.” In order to keep the peace, Clairborne thereupon revoked the appointment. There is, however, no known evidence that Mendez was really a descendant of those Jews who had been forcibly baptized by the Spanish and Portuguese 300 years earlier.21\n\nContinuing northward and eastward Jews settled in Bayou Sara and Clinton where they could trade with the neighboring Mississippians. Those Jews who kept going up the river beyond Baton Rouge preferred the Mississippi towns of Natchez and Vicksburg, establishing no substantial communities on the Louisiana side. Although Opelousas and New Iberia in south Louisiana had thriving communities during this period, more of the immigrants turned up the Ouachita to Monroe, Bastrop, and Farmersville near the Arkansas border; still larger groups moved up the Red River through Avoyelles Parish to Alexandria, Natchitoches, and Shreveport in the direction of Texas and Arkansas. There were at least ten other clusters of Jews in other villages and hamlets of the state.\n\nShreveport Jewry was only about a fifth as large as that of New Orleans, yet it was the second largest Jewish community in the state. Pioneers had moved into that part of Louisiana in the 1820’s when cotton was beginning to come into its own and cattle driven from Texas brought profits to venturesome merchants. Fourteen-year-old Jacob Bodenheimer arrived in New Orleans from Speyer on the Rhine in 1822. After spending a few years in the big city he took passage up the Red River to the northwestern border at a time when the country was still wild. He traded with the Indians, peddled among the whites, ran a ferry, opened a tavern, and built one of the first stores in that remote corner. Strangely enough he and his family remained religiously loyal and observant; that was most difficult and altogether atypical.\n\nSouth of Shreveport on the Red River lies Alexandria where Jews created a full complement of Jewish institutions in the 1850’s and 1860’s. It was the third largest Jewish town in Louisiana. Still farther south in Avoyelles Parish there were practically no Jews, but there were two “Jewish” towns: Marksville and Bunkie. The former was named after a Jewish businessman by the name of Marc Eliche who had emigrated from Alsace before the Civil War. The latter was built by the family of Colonel A. M. Haas and was given that name as a compliment to the Colonel’s daughter who pronounced “monkey” as “bunkie.” Thus local tradition. Marksville is the county seat.22\n\nJEWS IN EAST TEXAS\n\nWith their eyes fixed on the beckoning West, men left New Orleans to travel up the Mississippi to the Red River and on to Natchitoches. Then they cut over to Nacogdoches, the most important town in East Texas in those days. This is the route that young Adolphus Sterne took in the 1820’s although he had already wandered as far north as Tennessee. This native of Cologne was something of an adventurer for by 1826-1827 he was involved in the abortive revolution that created the ephemeral Republic of Fredonia. He managed to come out of the episode with a whole skin. Though arrested he was either included in the amnesty that followed or his Masonic friends intervened for him. He made his peace with the Mexican government and was appointed an alcalde in the city. He was one of the town’s outstanding citizens. When the Texans revolted in 1835 and sought independence Sterne supported them enthusiastically; he acted as their agent in New Orleans, recruiting, outfitting, and transporting American supporters up the Red River to Texas. His friend Sam Houston was baptized as a Catholic in the home of this Nacogdoches Jew; Sterne’s Catholic wife served as Houston’s sponsor. Sterne intervened in a brawl between Houston and a Colonel Jordan, late of the Federal Army, just in time to stop the irate Colonel from hacking Houston to death with an axe. After the Republic was proclaimed Sterne led a company of men in battle against invading Cherokees and in later years served his fellow citizens in the state legislature.\n\nEven before the war for Texas independence in 1835-1836 brought in daring men from all parts of the United States, Lieutenant Samuel Noah, a West Point graduate, had fought in one of the Mexican revolts as early as 1812. During the fateful March-April days of 1836 when Fanning’s men were massacred at Goliad and Houston defeated Santa Anna at San Jacinto, Jewish volunteers played their part. There is no evidence that the Wolf who died in the Alamo with Bowie and Crockett was a Jew; Lieutenant Edward J. Johnson, a nineteen-year-old artillery officer who was executed at Goliad, was one of the Cincinnati Johnsons; Moses Albert Levy of Virginia served as a surgeon in the Volunteer Army; Levi Charles (Myers) Harby, a brother of Isaac Harby, resigned from the navy to help the Texans gain their freedom. All through the 1830’s before and after the battle for independence, Jews in small but increasing numbers settled in Nacogdoches, along the Gulf Coast at places like Velasco and Galveston, or steamed up the rivers into the interior. They were soldiers, adventurers, businessmen, empresarios, and land promoters; some were United States citizens; some were immigrants. The Galician youngster, Simon Wiess (Weiss) had left home at the age of sixteen and had wandered all over Europe and the West Indies before deciding to make his home in the United States. By the middle 1830’s he had left New Orleans behind him and had established himself in the new Republic of Texas where he was appointed a deputy collector of customs at Sabine-town, near the Louisiana border. He married a Christian girl in Natchitoches and then planted himself permanently in a place of his own in Jasper County on the Sabine River. He called it Wiess Bluff. This enterprising storekeeper shipped cotton down the Sabine in those early days thus helping to develop the river traffic. Some time before he died in 1868 he wrote an ethical letter to his sons as they were about to enter the business world: Never hesitate to say no; be meticulous in fulfilling a contract; allow no loafing or drinking in the store; maintain a one-price policy; sell for cash; read good literature, and associate with the best people. This was good advice in postbellum Texas; it is still good advice anywhere.23\n\nTexas had no dearth of adventuring Jews in that thrilling decade of the 1830’s. After having suffered reverses in Alabama, Simon Mussina, a Philadelphian, edited English newspapers in Matagorda and Matamoras, Mexico, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville which he helped to lay out. In later life this businessman, druggist, newspaper editor, and land promoter became so involved in land litigation that he finally turned to law as a profession. His investigation of titles brought him to the capital, Austin, where he became an officer of the local Episcopal church though he never became a Christian. The last rites over his body were performed in Galveston where he was buried from the First Presbyterian Church. Early Texas is an excellent laboratory for a most fascinating study of the assimilative process as it affected Jews in a pioneering area. Logic and tradition fade, tolerance prevails, and the commonweal is the highest law.24\n\nIt is not too much of an exaggeration to maintain that almost everyone in Texas in the 1840’s was in the land business: Texas had nearly 270,000 square miles and a population of less than 200,000. That would allow at least a square mile to every inhabitant. In its eagerness to secure immigrants the Republic signed contracts with colonizers, empresarios. One of them, a Frenchman, Henry Castro, was very probably of Jewish descent though he, too, like many other Texas notables of that generation, was married to a Gentile. Castro had come to this country in 1826 and became a citizen. He did not concern himself with Texas colonization until 1842. In the course of the next four years he sent over some 2,000 emigrants in twenty-seven boats. Four towns, scattered over sixty miles, were founded by him, including one named Castroville. These villages were the first permanent white settlements between San Antonio and the Rio Grande. Despite skillful propaganda in Germany and in France and the expenditure of large sums of money he was certainly not successful, at least financially. Involved in colonizing Algiers, the French had no desire to send people out to the dreary Texas plains; fear of a war with Mexico frightened others off, and Castro departed this world in the 1860’s a poor man. Castroville and Castro County in the Texan panhandle are monuments to the memory of a Marrano-like figure who loved to boast: “I descend in line direct from Jean de Castro, Viceroy of the Portuguese Indes and Goa.”25\n\nCastro’s contemporary, Jacob de Cordova, a member of a distinguished West Indian rabbinical family, was equally unsuccessful in his attempt to profit from his huge holdings. Some time before 1820 this Jamaican had come with his parents to Philadelphia where they joined one of the synagogs. They were observant Jews and Jacob was given a good Hebrew education though this did not deter him from marrying a Christian in 1826 in a Presbyterian ceremony. A decade later he was in New Orleans in business. The following year, in 1837, he was in Galveston selling tobacco, liquor, and stationery. Before his life ran its course he was to be a merchant, a newspaper publisher, founder of the Texas Odd Fellows Lodge, legislator, map maker, land promoter, and town builder. He was one of the original proprietors of the Waco townsite. By 1845 he had opened a land agency anticipating admission to the Union and the thousands of settlers who would pour into the country. He bought up soldiers’ land scrip and by 1855 he either owned or controlled over 1,000,000 acres. But he discovered too late that he had over-extended himself; interest on borrowed money ran anywhere from 8 to 10 percent; by 1859 his empire had collapsed. In pursuit of his policy of peddling his lands to prospective settlers Jacob became a propagandist publishing newspapers, maps, and books—The Texas Emigrants’ and Travelers’ Guide Book and Texas, Her Resources and Her Public Men. He became an avid booster for his adopted state, lecturing on its potentialities in New York, Philadelphia, and even in Manchester, England. However it is very much to be doubted whether his proslavery attitude sat well with some of his English audience. He was an entrepreneur with vision; in 1865 he proposed the establishment of mills in Bosque County for the manufacture of cloth. De Cordova died in 1868 and was buried under a large stone cross erected by his pious Christian admirers.26\n\nIn the 1840’s before he became an important land agent and locator, Cordova had established himself as a wholesale and retail merchant in Houston. Jews had come to town as early as 1835 and strangely, since originally it was certainly not the largest nor the most important Jewish settlement in the state, Houston led all other Texas Jewries in laying the foundations for a Jewish community. In relatively rapid succession the town’s Jews established a cemetery in 1844, held services in the late 1850’s, hammered out a permanent Ladies’ Hebrew Benevolent Society in the 1870’s, and in the next decade fashioned a Hebrew and German English School which Christians also patronized. The surest index to the stability of the Houston Jewish community is that two reverend gentlemen from Jerusalem spent five days in town in 1868 collecting money for the schools of the Holy Land. Two years later the Houston Jews began to build a synagog of their own and received large sums in contributions from local Christians. By 1880 there were almost 500 Jews in town.\n\nIn 1858 the twenty-one-year-old Harris (Hirschel) Kempner had a brush with the law in Houston. Houston was then a growing town of about 7,000 and insisted that its ordinances be obeyed. This malefactor was arrested and fined for riding through the streets at about five miles per hour. That was forbidden. Young Kempner at the age of sixteen had landed in New York City where he worked as a bricklayer for some time, and then in 1858 had moved on to Cold Springs, Texas. When the War came along he joined the cavalry as a private and came out as an officer. After the South surrendered he settled down in Galveston where he and his associates and his children after him built a very imposing commercial empire. A century later the Kempners of Galveston were still a great power in banking, real estate, sugar, and a host of other activities. Part of Harris Kempner’s success must be attributed to his wife, a Seinsheimer from Cincinnati. He saw her for the first time in New York City where he had gone to buy tobacco, snuff, and canned goods in carload lots. He and his partner were wholesale grocers and liquor dealers. He stayed in a boarding house, probably one run by Jews, where food was dished out in family style. Kempner was attracted very much and impressed by a sturdy young lady who was shoveling in the food at a good rate. She was vivacious and attractive. That girl, he said to himself, is vigorous and healthy and would make a man a good wife. On his next trip north he went to Cincinnati to buy whiskey—by the carlot—proposed to her and married her. The marriage was a great success; their eight children rallied around their mother when Harris Kempner was snatched away at a relatively early age.27\n\nUp until the turn of the nineteenth century Galveston was the largest and most cultured city in the state. In the late 1870’s almost one-third of the 3,300 Jews in Texas lived in this Gulf Coast town. There were twice as many Jews in Galveston as in Houston. The early settlers, aside from those Europeans who arrived by boat via New Orleans, had come in from the Atlantic tidewater, from declining Charleston, from Baltimore, and from Philadelphia. The most notable families of Jewish immigrants to the Lone Star Republic were the Ostermans, the Dyers, and the Seeligsons; all of them started out in the dry goods business. It took years before the Galveston Jews pulled themselves together and purchased ground for a cemetery. That was in 1852, just a year before Michael Seeligson became mayor; he took the job, he wrote Isaac Leeser, to confound those Christians who were crusading against Jews. By 1870 there was a congregation in town, a social club—the Harmony—a charity and burial group, and a ladies welfare organization.\n\nIt is quite probable that Galveston was slow in putting a Jewish community together because there were so many disparate elements. In this it resembled New Orleans which waited a whole generation after the Americans took over before the first congregation shaped itself; also as in New Orleans many Jews were probably indifferent. When Rabbi M. N. Nathan was called in from New Orleans to consecrate the cemetery in 1852 he chided his listeners because they concealed their origins, intermarried, held no services, and did not circumcise their children. The “frontier” took its toll. Isadore Dyer was reputed to have encouraged the Jews to hold the first service in his home. He was one of the Dyers of Baltimore, an observant family that had helped found the first Baltimore congregation in 1829. Dyer left half of his residual estate to the Protestants Orphans Home, the other half to the local synagog. This man had married out, actively supported the Episcopal church, and permitted his wife to rear their children as Christians, but when one of them died he insisted on a Jewish burial.\n\nIsadore had a sister, Rosanna, who had come to Galveston in the late 1830’s with her husband Joseph Osterman. She kept a kosher home; even when the port was blockaded during the Civil War she refused to compromise by eating forbidden food. She won the love and respect of the sick and wounded in the Confederate States Hospital by her devoted ministrations. In 1866 coming down the Mississippi her boat burnt to the water’s edge and she died of exposure in the cold February waters. When her will was opened it was found that she had left the bulk of her estate to numerous Jewish and Christian institutions. Undoubtedly patterning herself on Judah Touro, she made provision for Jewish societies in Philadelphia, New York, Cincinnati, Galveston, and Houston. The New Orleans Hebrew Foreign Mission Society—the Chinese!—was given a legacy and the Jews of Palestine were also remembered. In Galveston she left money for the care of sailors, for prison reform, and for a nondenominational widows and orphans home “for are not all men brothers before God?”\n\nRosanna’s Amsterdam-born husband had predeceased her by five years. In certain respects the Ostermans were a tragic family: they had no children; she died in a steamboat accident; he was accidently shot to death in a gunsmith’s shop. Osterman had been in business first in Philadelphia and then in Baltimore where he had been defrauded; he moved on to Galveston, probably at the suggestion of his brother-in-law Major Leon Dyer who had served the Republic of Texas. Osterman arrived on a schooner with a load of goods from New Orleans about the year 1839. He opened for business in a tent and in the course of a very short time became the largest retailer in town, for he was a brilliant innovative entrepreneur. Osterman imported wines from Holland and, in turn, shipped the Dutch cotton. In a more modern variation of the triangular trade his schooner brought in ice from New England, rum, molasses, and lime juice from the West Indies and, undoubtedly shipped the New Englanders and the West Indians products which were in short supply. This resourceful businessman sold the first sheet-metal stoves in town, manufactured soap and candles, sent out loaded mule trains to the hinterland to trade with the settlers and Indians, built roads and a ferry, advanced the planters money on their crops, paid interest on time deposits, sold the Texas army some of the new percussion caps and revolvers, and helped finance Gail Borden, Jr, as he began manufacturing condensed milk. Osterman is an interesting combination of merchant-shipper and merchant-banker. His contributions to the pioneer economy are evident.28\n\nAt an early stage in the history of the Republic and State of Texas Jews began to move into the towns of the backcountry in the eastern, northern, central, and southern areas and to settle in the Gulf Coast towns all the way from Sabine Pass near Louisiana to Brownsville on the Mexican border. Isaac Jalonick may well have been Belton’s only Jew, but he saw a copy of The Occident and hastened to write to Leeser whom he praised to the skies as a “poblick advocate” of the Jews. By 1880 there were about forty towns with Jews, at least twelve of which had organized communities. Most of these settlements began to flourish in the 1870’s with the expansion of the railroad systems.\n\nEarly Jewish Dallas is an interesting community which developed rather rapidly. In the one year, 1872, it bought a cemetery, held services, and established the usual all-purpose benevolent society. Two Sanger brothers were presidents of the congregation. Services were often held on the second floor of the Sanger Brothers store, and in 1874, Philip, another brother, was vice president of the budding congregation. The five Sanger brothers reflect the influence of the Rothschild myth on American Jews. The successes of the Rothschild brothers in Europe profoundly influenced many large American Jewish families. If brothers would only work together in harmony there is nothing they could not accomplish; there must be a common effort and a common treasury. These hopes and these goals are reflected to a greater or lesser degree in the efforts of the Seligmans, the Guggenheims, the family of Max Lilienthal, and the Kempners and Sangers of Texas.\n\nIsaac Sanger, the oldest of the five brothers, came over from Bavaria in 1851 and learned the rudiments of business the hard way, as a salesman in New Haven and then as a bookkeeper for a clothing manufacturer in New York City. Six years later he struck out for Texas and, together with a partner, established a store in McKinney in the northern section of the state. His goods came by oxcart from Shreveport or from Millican, the railroad terminal. In 1855 with the aid of two other brothers the main store was shifted to Weatherford and branches were maintained at McKinney and Decatur. Then came the Civil War; at least two of the brothers enlisted in the Confederate Army. After the War they started over again, this time at the Millican railhead, and they moved north, town by town with the advancing end-of-track until in 1871 they reached Corsicana. By that time all the brothers and the rest of the family had come over from Bavaria, even papa and mama, and Isaac had moved to New York to become the resident buyer and financier.\n\nAlex, one of the brothers who had come from Germany in 1865, served his apprenticeship in Cincinnati and became a partner in the family business in Corsicana in 1872. That year the others sent him on to Dallas, the new railroad terminus, to open a store. With the help of Sam and Lehman, two other brothers, the Waco store was opened. Later branches were established in Fort Worth and Wichita, Kansas. Ultimately the family opened a wholesale department in Dallas and also manufactured their own overalls and jumpers. The Dallas retail store became one of the great institutions of Texas and by 1910 could brag of having installed the first escalator in the South. It had nine acres of floor space and at its peak employed about 1,800 people. The store sold merchandise—that was its main job—but it sponsored art exhibits, gave book reviews, conducted a theatre for adults and teen-agers, offered hospitality to the Girl Scouts and the Parent-Teachers Associations, sponsored lectures, staged style shows, presented choral singers, and opened a branch post office. The employees were offered sick and death benefits, insurance, and the convenience of a building and loan association. Quite early brother Philip built a beautiful home “far out in the country” with three drawing rooms and a third-floor ballroom. The problem of transportation was solved by asking one of the brothers who controlled the local mule-drawn streetcar to extend the line to his residence. To make sure that the conductor would not drive off without him before breakfast was finished, Philip would toot on a little silver whistle and the driver would wait patiently. Philip then sauntered out to the car and to the day’s work.\n\nOn November 30, 1901, Eli Sanger, one of the brothers, bought one of the first automobiles in Dallas. It was a Locomobile and cost $850.29\n\nJEWS IN THE BORDER STATES\n\nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\nBy 1828 when New Orleans’ Gates of Mercy were opened to receive those Jews who were determined to be Jews, the initial penetration of the interior of the Continent was complete. At one end was Cincinnati, at the other New Orleans. In the decade of the 1830’s the Jewries of Louisville and St. Louis would come into being; during the 1840’s the wandering Arameans would move up and down the Ohio and the Mississippi Rivers and their tributaries, ranging east to the Appalachians and west to the Great Plains. It was during this same decade, the 1840’s, when the Jews were settling in all parts of the Old Southwest, laying the groundwork for future Jewish communities, that for the first time in its almost fifty years of existence the national capital began to shelter Jews in numbers. The District of Columbia, Washington and Georgetown, attracted few Jews in the early national period because there were few in the United States. When the Central Europeans started coming to these shores the District soon received its share. Like almost all towns and areas settled by Jews at this time, Washington and Georgetown had pioneers who preceded the “masses” by a generation or two. The first known Jew was already ensconced in the District in the 1790’s before the capital was officially transferred from Philadelphia to Washington in 1800. Isaac Polock was a third-generation American, grandson of a prominent Newport merchant-shipper. In 1792 Isaac was in Savannah where he was hauled before the congregation on the charge of having desecrated the Sabbath by keeping his store open on a Saturday. When he explained that some wares which he had ordered had arrived on the Sabbath and had to be stored at once, he was exonerated. Three years later he was in Washington building houses which were ultimately to serve as offices and residences for cabinet members. Like his grandfather he was a merchant-shipper, busying himself for the most part in the coastal trade. In those days Washington, Georgetown, and Alexandria were ports. The Polocks were observant; despite the fact that they were apparently a lone family they had their own “priest” who acted as shohet and Hebrew teacher.30\n\nDuring the early 1830’s there was a bare sprinkling of Jews in town, including a directory publisher and an army officer; even as late as the early 1840’s when Captain Alfred Mordecai wanted a minyan to help bury a child, ten male Jews could not be found. Religiously speaking, the Jewish congressmen were almost a total loss. They kept to themselves. By the late 1840’s and 1850’s immigrants started coming. It was they who succeeded in fashioning a congregation in 1852. They called it the Washington Hebrew Congregation; the name may have been a variation of the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation. The congregants were fortunate in securing the help of Captain Jonas P. Levy, a brother of the wealthy, assertive Uriah P. Levy, then a high officer in the United States Navy. Jonas Levy, a maritime officer, had been an active participant in the Mexican War and had been put in charge of the port of Vera Cruz by General Zachary Taylor. Like his brother Uriah he was a good businessman and was the head of a company that sought to bring gas light to Washington. Levy called his enterprise the Washington Benzole Gas Light Company. His most ambitious project—which at $100 a share never got off the ground—was the proposal to build a road from New York to New Orleans, to Tampico, Vera Cruz, and the Mexican West Coast, near Acapulco, from where steamships would carry the travelers on to the California El Dorado. It was a brilliant but not unusual idea in those days before the Union and Central Pacific Railroads spanned the continent. Levy served as president of the new congregation after it was chartered by Congress in 1856.31\n\nLike their fellow Jews in Baltimore a generation earlier the Washingtonians ran into a roadblock when they set out to incorporate their new religious association. Up to that time only Christian churches in the District were recognized and when Jonas Levy’s petition for a charter reached Congress a gentleman from Mississippi, Hendley Stone Bennett, objected to the “Hebrews.” The Kentuckian Humphrey Marshall who was pushing the bill responded laconically that Mr. Bennett “objected to the bill in regard to the Hebrews. My bill is in regard to the Americans.” The House laughed and approved the charter. This brief passage between Bennett and Marshall is interesting and confusing: Bennett was a Democrat; Marshall was a member of the nativist American Party which was then agitating against Catholics and immigrants. Even Jews were not untouched by this xenophobia: the congregational constitution of 1857 declared that only citizens could be officers—this at a time when the majority of the stalwarts of Washington Hebrew Congregation spoke with a foreign accent.\n\nJews in the national capital began to spread their wings in the 1860’s. The census of that year discloses that of the fifty-one gainfully employed Jews in the District at least forty-one were in some form of retail merchandising. On February 1, 1860, Rabbi Morris J. Raphall of New York City opened the House of Representatives with prayer, the first Jew to do so. Fully caparisoned with praying shawl and velvet skull cap he prayed before a crowded gallery. He was “listened to with marked attention.” The Jews swelled with pride although some Christians were nonplussed: “going to pray for ten percent a month”; “a Jew praying for the American House of Representatives! The next thing we shall have will be a shaking Quaker dancing a reel” or “Brigham Young, surrounded by his harem, threatening to send the administration to hell.”32\n\nNumerous Jews settled in the capital to take advantage of the business opportunities offered by the War. The young Bavarian Simon Wolf had left Ulrichsville, Ohio, as a clerk; he read law for two years and hung out his shingle in Washington in 1862. For the next sixty years Wolf was to glory in his position as the appointed—and self-appointed—lobbyist for an American Jewry that was to grow from 150,000 to 4,000,000. In 1863 the Washington Hebrews dedicated their first synagog building and asked their friends throughout the country to help finance the bold undertaking. Their appeal was supported by Mayor Richard Wallach, a Unitarian, son of a Roumanian father who, it is not too audacious to venture the guess, was born a Jew. After the War, veterans and others moved to town to fill civil service positions. By 1871 there were three congregations in the District and two ladies philanthropic societies. Before the decade ended it was to shelter at least 1,500 Jews.33\n\nThere is today in the National Archives, in Washington, a document of particular interest to Jews of the capital and all of America. The cinema entrepreneur Barney Balaban gave it to the government in 1945. Shortly before that time a professor of the Hebrew Union College of Cincinnati working in the field of American Jewish history visited Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach in his office in New York and asked the distinguished bibliophile if he had any old papers of significance for Jews. In answer to his query Dr. Rosenbach took him into the vault and pointed to an old document lying on the floor. “That is the most important Jewish document I own,” he said. The professor picked it up; it was an original copy of the Bill of Rights. This is the document which now graces the National Archives.34\n\nWEST VIRGINIA JEWRY\n\nThe District, as it is known, was created out of land originally ceded to the national government by the states of Maryland and Virginia. About six weeks before the Washington Jews dedicated their first synagog building, formerly the Methodist Episcopal Church South, President Abraham Lincoln signed the bill admitting the western part of Virginia to the Union as a state. The non-slavery counties of northwestern Virginia were loyal to the Union. There were of course Jews in that part of the state even as there were some almost anywhere where towns of size grew up. Jews had certainly been passing through Wheeling at least since 1820 for the city lay on the Cumberland Road and on the Ohio, the main southern and western artery for trade and travel. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad reached the city by 1853. Jews planted themselves in Wheeling because it was a very active commercial, manufacturing, and port city. There were about 11,000 people there in 1850, but long before that in the 1840’s the Jews had begun to hold services; by 1849 they had a congregation and a cemetery. Jews set up a charity association in the 1850’s and their efforts were reenforced in the 1860’s by the Ladies Hebrew Benevolent Society. The ladies provided sick-care, shrouds, a funeral carriage, relief for all in distress, and, as a matter of course, financial aid to a congregation that was always in need of cash.\n\nFarther down the Ohio was Parkersburg where Jews had stopped to settle in the 1850’s. By the end of the 1860’s, in 1869, the first society around which the community was to gather, was a Young Men’s Hebrew Association. It offered not only fellowship but also religious services and aid for itinerants. Still farther down the river close to the mouth of the Kanawaha lay the village of Point Pleasant. No Jews were to stop there till the middle of the twentieth century but some did go up the river to Charleston in the mid-nineteenth century; others undoubtedly came from the East on an old road that ran across the mountains from Richmond to the Ohio. The Parkersburg community began as a Y.M.H.A.; Charleston Jewry began in 1873 as a Hebrew Educational Society that taught children, held services, lent money to its members, and started a German Club. When the sanctuary was built by the Society in 1875 no man could join the Club who had not contributed to the synagog. This was a well-integrated group. In 1885 Charleston members got rid of their rabbi with whom they were unhappy and advertised for a teacher who was to lead in services and teach the children Hebrew, German, and religion. They said specifically they wanted no rabbi. Charleston, Wheeling, and Parkersburg were the three leading Jewish towns in the 1870’s. Wheeling had about 300 Jews; Charleston and Parkersburg, fewer than 100. There were about a half-dozen other Jewish settlements either on the Potomac or its tributaries, oriented to Virginia, or on the Monongahela, satellites of Pittsburgh.35\n\nTENNESSEE JEWRY\n\nImmigrants coming up the Mississippi from New Orleans or western pilgrims floating down the Ohio past Wheeling, Parkersburg, Louisville, Owensboro, Henderson, and Paducah, might well decide to remain in Memphis. Because of its superb location it was one day to become the biggest city on the Mississippi between St. Louis and New Orleans. There was no Memphis in 1795 when Benjamin Myers settled in Nashville. This Myers was the son of a Newport religious factotum of the 1770’s and a brother of Major Mordecai Myers, the veteran of the War of 1812. Nashville in the 1790’s was still on the edge of settlement. Here, too, it took a half - century before a community was established by humble emigrants from Central Europe. Services were held in 1848, and a burial association was established and a cemetery purchased in 1851. The new group called itself the Hebrew Benevolent Burial Association, Shield of David. The founders, consisting of “five families and eight young men,” may have chosen the name Shield of David because they lived in Davidson County. Nashville was by then a prosperous town of about 20,000 just about to complete railroad connections south to the Atlantic at Charleston. After that there was no question of its future.\n\nUltimately Memphis was to become the most important city in the state. The first Jewish pioneer was Joseph I. Andrews, a grandson of Haym Salomon, Robert Morris’s bill broker in 1781; Andrews’s wife Miriam was a granddaughter of “Major” Benjamin Nones, a veteran of the Revolution. Andrews bought a cemetery for local Jewry in 1847/1848 after a brother died and by 1853 there was a burial society and a permanent religious community. Memphis was a great cotton center and grew rapidly. By 1876 the population had more than tripled since the 1850’s and the Jews had grown from a handful to over 2,000, despite the recurring yellow-fever epidemics which took a terrible toll. The butcher, Henry Seesel, who was in charge of the Jewish cemetery, buried 100 men, women, and children in 1873 alone. Seesel, of Speyer on the Rhine, had established himself permanently in the town in 1857 after about ten years of stopping in about a half-dozen towns engaged in at least seven different occupations. His experience as a stockkeeper and clothing salesman in Cincinnati lasted but two days. When his boss told him to stand outside the store and pull in customers his first prospect turned out to be a country bumpkin who knocked him down and called him a “damned Jew dog.” Seesel quit immediately.36\n\nChattanooga, Brownsville, and Knoxville were much smaller than Memphis. In the 1870’s Chattanooga had fewer than 200 Jews and the other two towns fewer than 100 each. All three Jewish communities were organized in the postbellum period. The Knoxville Jews came together when they bought a cemetery plot in 1865 to bury a Confederate soldier. This goad to organize is reminiscent of the creation of the Hebrew Benevolent Society in New York City in 1822. Money was collected there in 1820 to provide for a dying Revolutionary War veteran and the unspent surplus was used to create a new social-welfare society. The Knoxvillians held services from 1866 on in the basement of a wholesale vinegar establishment; the humble worshippers used the barrels as seats until they emerged from the depths in the early 1870’s to enjoy the hospitality of the First Presbyterian Church.\n\nAlmost from the very first day, Squire Julius Ochs was the “rabbi” of the Knoxville Benevolent Society Congregation. Ochs was a Bavarian, born in Fuerth in 1826. His father saw to it that he received a fine education in the classics and in modern languages; at his bar mitzvah Julius read some of his own poetry in German and spoke briefly in English, French, and Italian. Reverses at home and the severe Bavarian laws impelled him to join members of his family in America in 1845. In order to take the ship in Bremen he walked 250 miles. His life in America was a series of almost bewildering ups and downs. He was a peddler, a teacher of languages in a Kentucky girls seminary, a part-time rabbi in Louisville, a Mexican War soldier, and even an owner of a chain of stores in the South. He was welcomed everywhere for his culture and his ability to play the guitar. One begins to suspect that he was not a “practical” person. He spent his last dollar in New York City to listen to an opera and sold a successful business he owned to finance a brother; then he went to work for the new owners. Ochs helped manage a cotton factory in Louisiana, led a Masonic lodge, wrote an operetta for a drama and music club, traveled in the transmississippi West and in the South for a wholesale jeweler, and opened a business for himself; he made money, he lost money. All this before the War of 1861, during which he was a Union militia officer. Unlike many others, Jews included, he refused to participate in the smuggling so common then, particularly in the Memphis area. He managed to keep the peace beautifully with his wife, an ardent “rebel”; in later years she was active in the Daughters of the Confederacy and he was a chaplain in the Grand Army of the Republic. Toward the end of the War he settled in Knoxville; once more he was in and out of the army and then by the spring of 1865 back in business for himself. This time he became wealthy but when Lee surrendered, prices collapsed and Ochs, left with a huge inventory bought at inflated war prices, had to liquidate his business. There were days when he was literally down to his last loaf of bread.\n\nHis friends rallied around him and elected him squire, justice of the peace. Now at least he and his numerous family had enough to eat. The boys went to work delivering newpapers; the eldest son Adolph, with two younger brothers, arose at 3:00 in the morning, took care of the paper route, finished at seven, and then went on to school. Adolph decided to learn the printer’s trade, moved to Chattanooga and at the age of twenty bought the Chattanooga Times. Then he brought the squire and the entire family to Chattanooga and put them to work in his new enterprise before he finally moved on in 1896 to rebuild The New York Times. The last ten years of the squire’s life, to his death in 1888, were good years. He never became wealthy but “I never betrayed a friend, never received a favor which I did not return, nor borrowed a dollar which in the end was not paid back.” Ochs’s life in America is not typical. He was cultured, generous, idealistic, yet in his ups and downs he is more typical of the German immigrant than the Seligmans, the Guggenheims, and an August Belmont."
