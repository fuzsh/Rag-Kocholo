        "text": "Always used to collect the England World Cup coins. One tournament they simply guessed at who would be in the squad and got two or three wrong (which was doubled by the fact that they were consequently missing the actual players who were picked).\n\n0\n\nI collected Tiger Tokens, well I tried to, riding a small 250CC that couldn't get £5 in the tank, thankfully the garages still gave me tokens.\n\nI used to work for a Mobil Garage, giving stuff like Glass tumblers, Hi ball Glasses, tape cassettes and so on.\n\nDoes anyone remember getting Green Shield Stamps from petrol garages?? I collected them but can't remember which garages gave them out.\n\n1\n\nGlasses of every description were definitely the most common give aways. We had cupboards full of the damned things. The promotions always used to stop just when you had collected five of them. Rarely managed to get a full set of 6! And the 'hits' cassettes, often with cover versions of songs by unknown artists. I don't think we are really missiing out.\n\n0"
