        "text": "In his later years Stafford Challis, who has died aged 95, gave great service to the financial section of Marie Curie Cancer Care and, as honorary treasurer, to his great love, the National Liberal Club - where he also sat on the general committee, and, to his particular satisfaction, the wine committee. He had devoted his working life to Berger Paints, in Britain and India.\n\nStafford was born in White Hart Lane, Tottenham, then largely rural. A lifelong Tottenham Hotspur fan, he recalled that when gas was installed in the family home, the fitter was Tommy Clay, then Spurs captain and an England international.\n\nStafford's father died in 1919 and he and his brother supported their invalid mother until her death in the 1950s. Stafford joined the National Benzole Company, at 17, qualifying as a chartered secretary in the early 1930s.\n\nIn 1938 he married Lucy Fletcher, and during that decade he also learned to fly. During the second world war he flew briefly with the RAF, and had a \"good\" war - playing a lot of sport.\n\nHe worked for Berger in Calcutta from the mid-1940s. While there he served as president of the Chartered Secretaries of India. From 1963 until the mid-1970s he worked for Berger in London.\n\nIn 1998 he moved to Manchester to be near his daughter and became involved with the local Liberal Democrats. He cut a distinguished figure on the streets of Chorlton-cum-Hardy in his trademark trilby hat.\n\nHis wife's death in 1967 was a great blow. He is survived by his son and daughter, four grandchildren and a great-grandson."
