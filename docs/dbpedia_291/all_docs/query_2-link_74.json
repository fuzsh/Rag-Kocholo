        "text": "Has anyone experienced a marked reduction in mpg using E10 petrol instead of E5?\n\n'Official' sites say it could be 1% or so only.\n\nI have a significant reduction due to something and filled up with E10 recently; I'm investigating!\n\nThanks\n\nIn reply to CPH:\n\nYes, I used to be able to drive from my home in Glasgow to Dad's home in south Bucks without re-filling. Using E10, I consistently need to re-fill just after Birmingham.\n\nI don't track mpg, and probably wouldn't have noticed if I was only doing short trips, but for that long trip which I do regularly, it was very obvious.\n\nFrom what I have read this is to be expected. I am assuming (perhaps optimisitically) that the reduction in CO2 emissions from using E10 take into account the fact that the mpg is reduced, meaning that we will burn more of it...\n\nIn reply to CPH:\n\n> Not 1% or so.\n\nThat 1% (or whatever it actually was) will have been determined under controlled conditions using a number of vehicles on a dynamometer, probably also on-road tests.\n\nEthanol is ~30% less energetic per unit volume than 'pure' petrol, E10 would therefore be ~3% less energetic than pure petrol but the actual change has been from E5 to E10, a ~1.5% reduction in volumetric energy density. It's just too small to notice anecdotally against a backdrop of changing use and seasons.\n\nModern turbocharged vehicles with fuel-composition sensors may well claw some of that loss back anyway by being able to alter their boost and ignition maps to increase efficiency. That said, I suspect such sensors are rare OEM fitments outside of the very high performance sector.\n\njk\n\nPost edited at 11:49\n\nIn reply to CPH:\n\nI have a fairly old Honda Civic mk8 1.4 and if anything I seem to be getting getter MPG on longer journeys. I was getting 49 mpg at best and now on a good run I'm seeing 51 mpg. This could just be the type of journeys I'm doing and the times I'm driving but it's certainly not a significant drop.\n\nAs JK says above, ethanol fuel can have advantages, it's more resistant to detonation so you can change the tuning. Maybe all the Honda gadgetry is finally doing something worthwhile.\n\nIn reply to CPH:\n\nCan’t remember, sorry, but probably I commented on an increase in fuel consumption overall since I started using E10 which was early summer - since it first became available in my area. However, my thoughts have changed over time as to the actual cause or more likely causes; ie multiple things interacting.\n\njkarran has mentioned some of the things that can cause a change in consumption and there are many others.\n\nTo further complicate my average fuel consumption, the pandemic has changed my driving distances considerably and that alone maybe having a disproportionate effect overall. I do know my car’s computer “learns” and adapts and so changes/manages lots of things based on recent and past driving styles, etc. as to how it reacts and responds to driver inputs during the next journey which no doubt can change fuel consumption considerably.\n\nWhilst weekly average mpg are generally lower (shorter journeys, less longer journeys to offset, more cold starts, etc. could explain it), I have found some (usually) longer journeys have returned a much higher ave mpg than I expected. Overall, with more hindsight, I think my changes over just some six months can be explained for various reasons such that the increase in fuel usage can’t be attributed purely to the change in fuel from E5 to 10. Just my thoughts meantime.\n\nHowever, I am looking to change to a BEV in the shorter term so I’m unlikely to get full year and more using E10 fuel to see what a longer term average will be using E10.\n\nIn reply to CPH:\n\nI monitored this over a ten-year period in the US, carefully calculating mpg's from the actual amount of fuel I put in the tank. I found about a 7% drop in mpg in my Toyota Prius with E10 compared with E0. I soon got to know the \"gas\" stations that were not putting ethanol into their petrol, and usually noticed the difference in performance just a few miles after filling up.\n\nI suppose the difference in fuel consumption depends to some degree on the specific engine.\n\nThe only times I have noticed a drop in performance in my diesel car in the UK, it has been very marked with engine stuttering etc. and I have put that down to something like water getting into the storage tanks rather than a bad batch of fuel from the refinery.\n\nIn reply to CPH:\n\nNot done any mpg comparisons, but I do think I can feel a difference in acceleration and generally how the car feels to drive. I know it's very subjective and might well all be in my head, but personally I think it 's made a difference.\n\nI never really used to notice much of a difference between premium unleaded and the bog standard stuff, but after noticing the car feeling a bit different and slightly sluggish after a couple of E10 fill-ups I did fill it up with premium petrol, and it feels much better to me. Since then I've been using premium petrol. I should probably try E10 again to see if I can tell the difference and properly decide whether it's worth spending extra on a fill-up (or better yet get the gf to fill my car up and not tell me which one, so I can run a proper experiment without bias!).\n\nMy car is a 9 year old 1.3l Yaris (so obviously not turbocharged as more modern small-engined cars seem to be, if that makes a difference), for reference.\n\nPost edited at 23:51\n\nIn reply to AukWalk:\n\nWell, that's how it started with me, thinking this was just a subjective impression. That's why I started calculating mpg's carefully (for about ten years over nearly 100,000 miles of driving) and soon discovered that it was not subjective. One thing I have wondered is whether with the high humidity in Texas, the ethanol in the fuel in ones tank can absorb some of the atmospheric humidity, making the problem worse than it might be (but I think that's unlikely).\n\nThis is why I am now so \"cool\" on E10.\n\nSo I thought I would pass on my experience to UKC, and what to I get?: a dislike!\n\nps. I calculate the mpg by filling up the tank to the cut-off point at the pump, and then refilling it at the same pump to the same cut-off point and recording the exact mileage in between. The only time this goes wrong is when the garage is cheating on their volumes. They are meant to be strictly calibrated by law in TX (and here), but on several occasions I have came across places that were way off, i.e., when one is expecting to be able to put about 8 1/2 gallons into a 10 gallon tank, finding I was able to put in something like \"11\" gallons! But most of the time the volumes are pretty consistent. Invariably, the mpg's calculated in this way are not as good as those estimated by the car's computer, which plays the error bars the other way.\n\nIn reply to wilkie14c:\n\nSurely solder and brass are resistant to water. Just looking around at all the brass taps in the house. Maybe it's galvanic corrosion between the aluminium carburettor shell and other metals.\n\nThis E10 fuss has been a real boost to the sales of fuel treatments and stabilisers. The trend on YouTube is videos of people separating out the ethanol by adding water with food colouring and then separating off the coloured aqueous layer. The issue you then have is you lose the good fuel additives that retard detonation and you have loads of idiots storing relatively large volumes of fuel in inappropriate containers in their garages.\n\nIn reply to wilkie14c:\n\nIt also appears that, according to info I've been getting - book on the subject of fuel plus info from the Vintage Motorcycle Club, Royal Enfield Owners Club and BSA Owners Clubs - that fuel pipes can rot, plus gaskets and grommets, and worse still some actual fuel tanks, can perish due to the presence of Ethanol. Obviously E10 has twice the Ethanol of E5, so the effect is much more drastic.\n\nYou have to remember that fuel systems were designed when there was no Ethanol in fuel.\n\nOn a side question - the source of the Ethanol is as a by-product of the sugar industry. I was under the impression that the government was trying to reduce sugar intake. So if they succeed in reducing sugar consumption, then where is all this Ethanol going to come from in future ?\n\nIn reply to DubyaJamesDubya:\n\n> It should be bioethanol and thus made by drawing CO2 from the atmosphere (using sunlight) so thus a nett zero contributor of CO2. Sounds great doesn't it...\n\n> However I read that 80% of the energy gain can be consumed by harvesting, manufacture and distribution so a rather poor return. Worse still is the use of valuable food production capacity to provide the feedstock\n\nThe standard feed stock in places like south America where ethanol is a popular fuel is sugar cane bagasse, the waste left over after the majority of the useful/easily extractable sugar has been extracted. For years the aim has been to use cellulosic biomass to produce biofuel and with this aim people have been engineering microorganisms to either produce enzyme mixes that can be added to feedstock which break down the cellulose and liberate the sugar or otherwise the produce yeasts that can directly use the alternative feed stock.\n\nOften some of the fuel produced is used directly to produce more fuel by heating the fermenters but there is a substantial net gain and any CO2 output comparison needs to include the equivalent used in fossil fuel extraction and purification.\n\nIn reply to CPH:\n\nIf you are old enough you'd remember when National (National Benzole) and Discol (Cleveland Discol) were common brands in the UK and they had loads of ethanol in the fuel. Previously benzole was used as an anti-knock (pre-detonation additive) but after the war it was more important to the chemical industry so replaced by methyl or ethyl alchohol. In fact the first Benz ran on alchohol as did Model T Fords and most cars of the early days, in fact up to WW2 petrol was cursed by performance car owners. To cure the knocking compression ratios were reduced until lead tetraethyl was introduced. Where modern cars fall down is the compression ratio is far too low to burn alchohol effectively, the cars for countries like Brazil which have E85 have different engines. The USA have been running on E25 for decades.\n\nAs long as the various seals and gaskets are appropriate the only identified problem in Germany (we have had E10 for over ten years) is the carbon filters in the fuel tank breathers stop working effectively, the premium manufacturers know this and fit better ones (there was a move to have this included in the MOT).\n\nIn reply to fred99:\n\n> It doesn't matter how long the CO2 has been locked away, the critical factor is how much of it is unlocked.\n\nHave to disagree with that statement.\n\nI’ve been burning pallets for the last 6 or 7 years for house heating, yes, I’m still pumping out CO2, but that’s probably several tonnes of fossilised carbon that I haven’t used, let alone what would have happened to said pallets.\n\nPlus it was free\n\nIn reply to jkarran:\n\nNot sure how you're working the percentages, did you factor in the way that ethanol combusts in a progressive and power transfering piston-friendly way and why some US racers actually choose very high ethanol/methanol contents. \"Gas is for cleaning the windshield but methanol is for racing\". I don't think it's as simple as counting the carbons etc.\n\nI'd be astonished if anyone can actually obserbe a real world performance difference, assuming of course their fuel system is compatible). Super, which now means E5, being better for everyday usage is 99% marketing scams (the 1% is the slightly additional cleaning agents added to try to differentiate product)\n\nPost edited at 21:34\n\nIn reply to CantClimbTom:\n\nEngines that are optimally designed for methanol are not identical to those that are optimised for petrol.\n\nI suggest that you make careful measurements over many tank-loads with the different fuels to see how the ethanol additives affect your mpg and car performance. I noticed pronounced changes to both, but could only measure the mpg (over a ten-year period in the US). Maybe you will be one of the lucky ones whose car is not very noticeably affected. Otherwise, be prepared to be astonished. I was.\n\nIn reply to CPH:\n\nI wasn't suggesting something like you can get an old Vauxhall Cavalier and shove 100% methanol in it and expect it to run well. I understand that cars e.g. like those running on E85 are modified for that. I was just pointing out that it's not as easy to compare power yields of differing fuel types as just looking at the theoretical chemical energy.\n\nI'm still surprised to hear that someone's car would have noticeably different fuel consumption between E5 and E10. E10 can cause some people problems with o rings and lines but I wasn't expecting economy as an issue. Sorry to hear that, if you don't mind me asking, what car do you have?\n\nIn reply to CantClimbTom:\n\n> Not sure how you're working the percentages, did you factor in the way that ethanol combusts in a progressive and power transfering piston-friendly way and why some US racers actually choose very high ethanol/methanol contents. \"Gas is for cleaning the windshield but methanol is for racing\". I don't think it's as simple as counting the carbons etc.\n\nI just compared the volumetric energy densities then applied them crudely to the changing fuel mix. I did mention the greater knock resistance of alcohol as a possible benefit in limited applications but no, it's not 'accounted for'.\n\nMethanol isn't ethanol. I think it's mainly used in performance engines as a chemical charge-cooler and octane booster (both getting less important as direct injection grows in that sector).\n\n> Super, which now means E5, being better for everyday usage is 99% marketing scams (the 1% is the slightly additional cleaning agents added to try to differentiate product)\n\nSuper is necessary if your engine knocks (or worse) on regular which is very unusual for production vehicles. Mostly it's pointless.\n\nJk\n\nPost edited at 18:28"
