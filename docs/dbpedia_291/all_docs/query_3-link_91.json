He had traced it back until it was nothing more than a simple cell. The method pursued by him was to follow up the oviduct of a species of Acheta to its extreme termination. IN that region of the oviduct a collection of simple formative cells is seen, and among them some are taking on additional development, and by tracing down the oviduct these cells are found in further stages of development until the characteristic vesicle and dot of the legitimate egg is seen.\n\nHe also stated the different modes by which constitutive cells are developed, by evolution, by division.\n\n[end page 265 | begin page 266]\n\n{{264}}\n\n{{November 6. 1849}}\n\n{{Dr Holmes on the Boomerang}}\n\nDr Holmes, spoke of the peculiar flight of the singular Australian missile, the Boomerang, and remarks were made by Dr Pickering, Prof. Harvey, Dr H.

Gould, C. T. Jackson. 31.\n\n{{Mementos of Dr Nathaniel Bowditch}}\n\nThe occasion was rendered peculiarly interesting from the circumstance that the meeting was convened in the Library room of Dr Bowditch, formerly President of the Academy. The arrangements of the apartment remain precisely as there were in his day. His chair and table occupy their usual position, his bust occupying the wall as near as possible to the place where he used to sit, and all the papers on his desk remaining just as he left them. Many incidents relating to his early life and his subsequent habits especially relating to his scientific labors were related, and many memorials of him were shown, such as medals, a bust of La Place presented by his widow, the manuscripts of an Almanac constructed by him at the age of fifteen, his Abstract of the mathematical papers in the Transactions of the Royal Society, his portfolios, on the covers of which were numerous mottoe, in various language, characteristic of the philosopher, and lastly the fragment of his translation of the fifth volume of the Mecanique Celeste as far as he had proceeded.\n\n{{Profs.

Bowditch, gave the result of the microscopic examination of the accumulations on the teeth of healthy persons, near the gums in 49 individuals, most of whom were very particular in their care of the teeth. Animalcules and vegetable products were found in every instance except two. IN those cases the brush was used three times a Day, and a thread was passed between the teeth daily. Windsor soap was also used by one of these two persons, with the brush. Dr B. had tried the effects of various substances in destroying the animalcules, and especially of tobacco, by which they seemed\n\n[end page 268 | begin page 269]\n\n{{267.}}\n\n{{December 4. 1850}}\n\nTo be in no wise incommoded. Soap suds, and the chlorine Tooth Wash invariably destroyed them.\n\n{{Prof. Agassiz on the Eggs of Invertebr. Animals}}\n\nProf. Agassiz, made some remarks on the Egg in Vertebrate animals as a means of clarification. What is their structure, and is there any thing specific in the Eggs of the different classes of Vertebrata? In the Eggs of them all may be seen a generation of cells and sometimes more than one, in the germinative dot, as may be readily seen in eggs of turtles, rabbits, squirrels, etc. The eggs of mammals are very minute, and surmounted by epithelium; and they begin at once their subdivision within the parent. In those of Birds a large bulk of vitellus is developed in the ovary, before the albumen and shell is added. The same is the case in Turtles, Lizards and Serpents; but the Eggs of Bactrachians are different, and are small, elastic and dilatable like those of Fishes. He thought therefore that that [sic] there was a closer affinity between the first mentioned Reptiles and Birds than between them and the Batrachians; and that the Turtles, Lizards and Serpents might be incorporated with Birds, while the Batrachians were classed with Fishes.\n\n{{Horsford on adulterated Vermillion}}}\n\nProf. Horsford exhibited several specimens of Vermillion which varied very essentially in color, from adulteration. Some of the articles used for that purpose are Chromate of Lead, Sulphate of Lime, Carbonate of Magnesia.\n\n{{Desor, Animals about L. Superior}}\n\nMr. Desor mentioned some facts relating to the distribution of animals in the region of Lake Superior, and specified some of the Animals found on Isle Royale whose presence he was at a loss to account for, except on the supposition that the island was once continuous with the continent.\n\nThe Academy then adjourned.\n\nAttest\n\nAugustus A.

Gould declined serving as a member of the Committee of Publication, and Professor Joseph Lovering was nominated by the chair, and unanimous by chosen to fell the vacancy.\n\n{{Prof Agassiz on the coloration of Animals}}\n\nProf. Agassiz presented some new views respecting the coloration of animals. He stated that the coloration of the lower animals living in water, depends upon the condition, and, particularly, upon the depth and transparency of the water in which they live; that the coloration of the higher types of animals, is intimately related to their structure; and that the change of colour which is produced by age in many animals, is connected with structural changes. He stated that coloration is valuable as an indication of structure; that it is a law universally true of vertebrate animals, that they have the colour of the back darker than that of the sides; and that the same system of coloration, prevails in all the species of a genus, partially developed on some, but recognizable when a large number of species is examined.\n\n{{Prof. Pierce, on errors in the lunar theory, and occultations}}\n\nProfessor Pierce expressed the opinion, that there are errors in the lunar theory that still remain to be investigated; that occultations cannot be relied on as a means of accurately determining longitude; & that they are of little use for any purpose, except when whole groups of stars, as the Pleiades or Hyades, are taken.\n\nHe made some remarks upon the orbit of the comet of 1843, considered as a straight\n\n[end page 284 | begin page 285]\n\n{{283}}\n\nLine directed through the sun’s centre.\n\n{{Dr. Locke’s communication}}\n\nProfessor Horsford communicated a letter addressed to the Academy by Dr. John Locke, purporting to be the first of a series which he proposes to send instead of the one he withdrew.\n\nIt was voted to refer it to the keeping of the Recording Secretary, to be accessible to the Fellows of the Academy for consultation.\n\nThe Academy then adjourned,\n\nJos.

J. Bigelow, W. Channing, A. A. Gould, Peirce, Bowen, S. C. Walker, B. A. Gould, Jr., Bacon, Horsford, H. I. Bowditch, Bouve, C. T. Jackson, M. Wyman, Lovering, Boyden, Agassiz, Guyot, Storer, J. H. Abbot.\n\nThe Records of the preceding meeting were read.\n\n{{Communications by the Cor. Secretary}}\n\nThe Corresponding Secretary communicated) a letter of acceptance from Mr. Jonathan P. Hall, recently elected a Fellow of the Academy; also (letters of acceptance from Prof. Elias Fries of Sweden, & M. Macedoine Melloni, of Naples, recently elected Foreign Members. The latter gentleman stated that he has sent to the Academy the first volume of his work, “Sur la Coloration calorifique”, in which he has demonstrated, as he believes, the identity of light and heat.\n\n{{Letters com. by the Cor. Sec’y.}}\n\nThe Corresponding Secretary also communicated letters from the Secretary of the Royal Institution, the Secretary of the Linnean Society, the Librarian of the British Museum, and the President of the Academy of Breslau, acknowledging the receipt of various publications of the Academy; two letters from Petty Vaughan, Esq. recently deceased)\n\n[end page 285 | begin page 286]\n\n{{284}}\n\nAnd the second of Dr. Locke’s series of letters relating to the Electro-Chronograph.\n\n{{Prof. Pierce’s remarks respecting Spica}}\n\nProf. Pierce stated that Mr. Schubert has discovered that Spica is a double star, one of the component parts of which is invisible. This conclusion was deduced by Mr. Schubert from observations made from 1764 to 1847 inclusive, and was said of Prof. Peirce to rest on much stronger grounds, than the similar conclusions of Bessel in regard to certain other stars. Spica has an irregular motion in right ascension, and it revolves in fifty years at the distance of one second and a half from the common centre of gravity of the two. This discovery Prof. Peirce considered a most remarkable step on the progress of stellar Astronomy.\n\n{{Mr Walker on the velocity of electricity in telegraphic circuits}}\n\nMr. S. C. Walker exhibited to the Academy a drawing illustrative of the results of experiments made by him, on the 4th of February last, to determine the velocity of electricity through the telegraphic circuit between Washington and St. Louis, seventeen hundred miles in length. His experiment gave a velocity of a little less than ten thousand miles a second. This result he proposes to test by further experiments on telegraphic lines in which chemical changes of colours are used, instead of markings made by means of an electromagnet. Mr. Walker found that pauses and syllables could be simultaneously transmitted in opposite descriptions, without interference, in the title graphic circuit in the same manner as they are in air.\n\n{{Prof. Agassiz on certain animals composed entirely of cells}}\n\nProf. Agassiz stated that he had ascertained that there are certain animals, capable of performing all the great functions of animal life, which consist entirely of cells. He referred, in illustration of his remark, to the genus Cohyne, of the Polypoide Medusae, found in Boston harbor. He distinguished the cells of which the tentacles of these animals are composed, and three kinds, epithelian, lasso, and locomotive cells. The tentacles, which consist of two cylindrical bodies, one within the other, tapering to a point, and without any.\n\n[end page 286 | begin page 287]\n\n{{285}}\n\ncavities, as composed entirely of such cells. The epithelian cells cover the whole surface of the tentacles. The individual lasso cells throwing out their inner cylindrical body, the tentacles are converted into stems with long, lateral threads for catching small animals. By the contraction nof their inner or locomotive cells, they are reduced to one tenth of the length they have when elongated. The locomotive cells were stated by Professor Agassiz to undergo endosmosis and exosmosis, accompanied by a change of form in the individual cells which constitute the inner cylinder of the tentacle, and in that change to become organs of locomotion. The apparent fibres described by some writers, were said by Prof. Agassiz to be merely elongated cells.\n\nProf. Peirce and Dr. Walter Channing made some further remarks in regard to the cause of the elongation of the cells.\n\n{{On a uniform scale of thermometrical & barometrical rotation}}\n\nAfter a discussion of considerable length, in which Mr. Guyot, Mr B. A. Gould, Jr., Prof. Agassiz, and the President took part, on the importance and practicability of introducing a uniform system of thermometrical and barometrical rotation in all countries whose science is cultivated, it was, on motion of Mr. Guyot,\n\nVoted, That a committee be appointed to consider the expediency of recommending the adoption of the centigrade thermometrical scale, and the metrical barometrical scale at the meteorological stations in Massachusetts.\n\nVoted that Mr. Guyot, Prof. Agassiz, Prof. Pierce, Prof. Lovering & Mr. B. A. Gould, Jr. be that committee.\n\n{{On the structure of the egg}}\n\nProf. Agassiz made some remarks respecting the structure of the egg. He stated that no two portions of the egg between the centre and the periphery, have the same structure; that the yolk does not consist of homogenous cells; and that it is not a store of nutritious matter to feed the young animal; but that it is a living, organized being.\n\nOn motion of Prof. Peirce it was voted that a monthly meeting of the Academy, be held on the first Tuesday in August, as four o’clock, in the afternoon.\n\n[end page 287 | begin page 288]\n\n{{286}}\n\n{{Memorial to the Senate & House of Representation}}\n\nOn motion of Mr. B. A. Gould, Jr., it was\n\nVoted, That a committee be appointed to address a memorial to the Senate & House of Representatives of the United States, on the subject of attaching a corps of scientific men, to the commission for running the boundary line between the United States and Mexico.\n\nProf. Agassiz, Prof. Peirce, and Mr. B. A. Gould, Jr. were appointed a committee for that purpose.\n\nThe meeting was then dissolved.\n\nJos. Hale Abbot,\n\nRecording Secretary.\n\nThree hundred and thirty fifth Meeting.\n\nAugust 6. 1850.\n\nThe Academy met at their Hall on Tremont Street, the President in the chair.\n\n{{Fellows present}}\n\nMembers present, Messrs. J. Bigelow, Bowen, Pierce, Beck, Folsom, Agassiz, H. J. Bigelow, A. A. Gould, Prof Robb of Fredericton, New Brunswick, J. H. Abbot.\n\nThe records of the previous meeting were read.\n\n{{Report of committee}}\n\nProf Agassiz, in behalf of the committee appointed at the last meeting to address a memorial to the two Houses of Congress on the subject of attaching a corps of scientific men to the Mexican Boundary Commission, reported that they had performed the duty assigned them. He further stated that, on account on the absence of some of the members of the Committee, appointed at the last meeting to consider the expediency of recommending the adoption of the centigrade thermometrical scale, & the metrical barometrical scale, at the meteorological stations in Massachusetts, the Committee were not prepared to report.\n\n{{Letter form Prof. Salisbury}}\n\nThe Corresponding Secretary read a letter from Prof. Salisbury of New Haven acknowledging, in behalf of the Oriental Society, the receipt of Vol. IV, Part II, of the Memoirs of the Academy, and soliciting for its Library the three previous volumes of the New Series to complete the set.\n\n{{Four pamphlets presented}}\n\nThe Corresponding Secretary laid before the Academy four\n\n[end page 288 | begin page 289]\n\n{{287}}\n\npamphlets, one presented by the Royal Society of Gottingen, and three presented by Prof. Hausman, with his acknowledgments for Vol. II. Part II. of the Recordings of the Academy.\n\n{{Letter of acceptance from Prof. Bischoff}}\n\nThe Corresponding Secretary also read a letter of acceptance from Prof. Bischoff of Giessen, recently elected a Foreign Member of the Academy.\n\n{{Dr. Burnets paper on Spermatozoa}}\n\nProf. Agassiz communicated a paper on Spermatozoa by Dr. Burnet of which he gave a brief abstract. He highly commended the paper as establishing new and important views, and evincing uncommon qualifications on the part of its author for such researches. On motion of Prof. Agassiz, it was referred to the Committee on Publications.\n\n{{Prof. Robb’s donation & remarks.}}\n\nProf. Robb of Fredericton, who was present by invitation, presented to the Academy Prof. Johnston’s “Report on the Agricultural Capabilities of the Province of New Brunswick; and the “Journal of the New Brunswick Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Home Manufactures, and Commerce;” and accompanied the donation with some interesting remarks respecting those works, and the efforts now making to improve the condition of New Brunswick by the introduc- of more scientific methods of agriculture.\n\n{{Prof Agassi on the Siluridae}}\n\nProf. Agassiz stated that he had ascertained that catfishes and the whole family of Siluridae, to which they belong, have a subcutaneous cavity behind the humerus, and outside of the peritoneum and the muscular walls of the abdomen, into which protrude potions of the liver, and sometimes the air bladder and kidney. He also stated that these animals have lateral holes for the admission of water into the interior of their bodies.\n\n{{Tooth of a horse exhibited by Prof. Robb}}\n\nProf. Robb exhibited a tooth of a horse found with several others on the bank of a river, and proposed the question, whether it belonged to a living or to an extinct species. Prof. Agassiz thought the question could not be satisfactorily answered without a greater number of specimens for comparison with the teeth of the living species, these being but slight differences of form in the teeth of this genus of animals.\n\n[end page 289 | begin page 290]\n\n{{288}}\n\n{{New type of scales presented by Bonito}}\n\nProf Agassiz exhibited a part of the skin of a Bonito caught off Nahant, which presented a remarkable peculiarity in the form of its scales. At first sight, the animals seemed to offer the anomalous phenomenon of ctenoid and cycloid scales occurring upon the same individual; but, on further examination, the scales were found to be a new type, intermediate between the ctenoid & the cycloid, the serratures being merely marginal, and not extending over the posterior surface.\n\n{{Dark stripes on the Bonito}}\n\nHe also called attention to some dark longitudinal stripes, which at first appeared to militate with the views he had bought before the Academy at a late meeting, respecting the connection between the coloration and the structure of animals. On examining their more carefully, however, each stripe was found to originate at the base of one of the finlets of the tail.\n\n{{Shrill noise made by the cat fish when taken out of water.}}\n\nProf Agassiz, in reply to a question of the President, stated that the shrill noise, heard on suddenly drawing a cat fish out of the water, is occasioned by the escape of air form the air-bladder through the pharynx [struck out] a lateral aperture in the surface of the animal; and in reply to a remark of Dr. Gould, he stated that a somewhat similar explanation, is applicable to the noise made by the Drum fish, when taken from the water, a fact recently ascertained by Dr. Holbrook.\n\nThe meeting was then dissolved.\n\nAttest, Jos. Hale Abbot,\n\nRecording Secretary.\n\nThree hundred and thirty sixth Meeting.\n\nAugust 14. 1850.\n\nA statute meeting of the Academy was held at the Library Hall, the President in the chair.\n\nPresent Messrs, J.

Abbot; and, by invitation, Dr. Holland of London, Lieut Wise, U.S.N, Prof. Coffin of Washington, Messrs. Hillhouse of New Haven, La Fayette of France, G. P. R. James, of [blank] and Wells of Cambridge.\n\n{{Corresponding Secretary}}\n\nThe Records of the monthly meeting held in August having been read, the Corresponding Secretary laid before the Academy letters from Prof. Encke of Berlin, and Prof. Muller also of Berlin, signifying their acceptance of the honour conferred upon them by the Academy in electing them Foreign Honorary Members.\n\n{{Letter from Prof. Agassiz}}\n\nThe Vice President read a letter from Prof. Agassiz, expressing his regret that the was prevented by illness form attending the Meeting, and requesting the acceptance, by the Academy, of a paper, published by him in the “Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,” entitled “The Classification of Insects from Embryological Data.”\n\n{{Communication from Prof. Horsford}}\n\nProf. Horsford read a paper upon the “Spheroidal State of Bodies.” He stated that, in some cases, high temperature is not essential to the production of the phenomenon, and that, in no case, is any new law required for its explanation. He accounted for the impunity with which the hand may be plunged into molten metal, and for the Leiden-frost experiment on the same principle, namely, that the exposed bodies are kept from coming in contact with the heated metals by intervening aqueous vapour; in the formation of which much heat becomes latent, and which, by its non-conducting property shields, in the one case, the hand, and, in the other, the water contained in the hated crucible, from all heat but that of radiation. As instances of the occurrence of the spheroidal state in the\n\n[end page 292 | begin page 293]\n\n{{291}}\n\nabsence of high temperature, he referred to the form mercury assumes on glass, oil & ether on water; and to the bead upon agitated alcohol. The explosion at the close of the experiment of burning potassium or sodium on water, that which takes place on fused salt-petre and water coming in contact, and that which takes place in the leidenfrost experiment, when the crucible is cooled so as to allow contact, he attributed to the same cause, the instantaneous production of steam. The explosion which sometimes occurs but an instant after potassium is thrown into water or nitric acid, he referred to a mixture, in explosive proportions, of hydrogen from the water with oxygen from the acid, or with that of the air. He doubted whether the explosions of steam boilers, are ever to be referred to the principle of the Leidenfrost phenomenon, the temperature of about 300˚, at which contact takes place, being too low to produce the requisite quantity of steam. At the conclusion of his paper, Prof Horsford illustrated his subject by several interesting experiments.\n\n{{Prof. Peirce on the turbine Wheel}}\n\nProf. Peirce stated that he had obtained, from some investigations connected with the turbine wheel, the following result: that the curve along which a material point should move so as to compel this curve to raise weights to which it is reattached, must be the cycloid. He exhibited a drawing of a bucket of a turbine wheel constructed by Mr. U. A. Boyden, exponents upon which, conducted with the most scrupulous care, had shown it to produce and effect equal to eighty eight per cent of the power expended; and stated that some of Mr. Boyden’s wheels had given the astonishing result of ninety two per cent of the power.\n\n{{Law of Vegetable growth}}\n\nProf. Peirce made some remarks in regard to the fraction which expresses the law of vegetable growth, which he compared with the ratio of the mean motions of the planets, and found to express now nearly the arrangement of these bodies than Bode’s law. For this purpose Neptune’s period of revolutions must be multiplied by 1/1 x ½ to obtain that of Uranus. The period of Uranus must be multiplied by ½ x 2/3 to obtain that of Saturn. Saturn’s period must be multiplied by 2/3 x 3/5 to obtain that of Jupiter and so on. If this law is true, these can be only one planet within the orbit of Mercury, and no planet beyond Neptune. This law or honorary seems to be that to which successive development in general, tends to conform, and is manifested when\n\n[end page 293 | begin page 294]\n\n{{292}}\n\nother forces opposed to it, are not too powerful. The atomic laws are opposed to it in crystallizing and other chemical processes; and also the higher laws of organization, such as those of bilateral division in the higher animals.\n\n{{Prof. Peirce’s communication}}\n\nProf. Peirce remarked that the perturbative function of planetary motion, had been developed by Hansen according to the eccentric anomaly of one of the planets, in a numerical form; and exhibited the first terms of a literal development of this function, which is more simple than the usual form of development according to the mean anomaly. He through there are reasons for believing that some other form of development, will be discovered, better adapted to cases of great inclinations and eccentricities; in as much as, in case the two orbits do not approach each other within a small distance, the development of this function, should not contain any term capable of becoming infinite.\n\n{{Dr. C. T. Jackson Phos. Lime discovered in New Jersey.}}\n\nDr. C. T. Jackson exhibited to the Academy a number of specimens of native phosphate of lime or Apatite, from a large vein three or four feet in thickness, discovered by Mr. Francis Alger and himself, during the month of last June, in Hurdstown in New Jersey. Crystals of this mineral, had been been [sic] found in the magnetic pyrites of this locality; but the very variable and deceptive appearance of Apatite had prevented the true nature of the vein from being discovered. In illustration of its variable appearance, he exhibited specimens from several localities in this country and in Europe. The peculiar resinous lustre of the broken surface, he stated to be in its most constant characteristic. The specimens from Hurdstown were crystallized, massive, and granular; and some them [sic] were covered with an iridescent film of oxide of iron. They were found, on subjecting them to chemical examination, to contain the usual components of Apatite. Dr. J. remarked upon the importance of augmenting the proportion of phosphates in our soils; and stated that Mr. Alger, in accordance with his advice, had obtained a lease of the locality; that mining operations had been commenced, and that thirteen tons of the mineral, were on their way, to Boston to be converted into prepared phosphates for agricultural use. On Dr. Holland’s referring to the researches of Prof. Dauberry of Oxford University, who was employed by the British Government to investigate the economical value of the phosphate of lime of Estremadera, in Spain, Dr. Jackson stated\n\n[end page 294 | begin page 295]\n\n{{293}}\n\nthat Dr. Dauberry reported that mineral phosphate of lime, is as valuable for agricultural purposes, as that obtained from bones; but that the supply at that locality is too small to be of much importance.\n\n{{Comet discovered by Mr. Bond}}\n\nIn reply to an inquiry of the Vice President, Mr. B. A. Gould, Jr., stated that no intelligence had reached this country of the comet discovered by Mr. Bond, on the twenty ninth of last August, having been discovered in Europe previously to the fifth of September.\n\nThe Academy then adjourned.\n\nJoseph Hale Abbot,\n\nRecording Secretary.\n\nThree hundred and thirty eighth Meeting.\n\nNovember 5. 1850.\n\nThe Academy met by invitation at the house of the President, Dr. J. Bigelow.\n\nPresent Messrs. J. Bigelow, S. Cabot, E. C. Cabot, Horsford, Eustis, Guyot, Everett, Warren, Admiral Owen, Phillips, H. I. Bowditch, Bouve, W. F. Channing, C. Jackson, Jr. C. Pickering, Felton, Eliot, Treadwell, Beck, B. A. Gould, Jr. O. Pickering, A. A. Gould. A. A. Hayes, J. B. S. Jackson, M. Wyman, Paine, Swett, H. J. Bigelow, Cole, Whitney, Peirce, Lovering, Peirson, Desor, J. Wyman, Agassiz, Emerson, A. Walker, Alger, Bowen, J. H. Abbot, and by invitation, Mr. Gurowski, late of Russia.\n\nThe Recording Secretary read the proceedings of the previous meeting.\n\n{{Prof. Guyot’s Report on baro. & thermos. Scales}}\n\nProf. Guyot, in behalf of the committee appointed to consider the expediency of recommending the adoption of the centigrade thermometrical scale, and the metrical barometrical scale, made a Report, to which was appended a series of Resolutions. A discussion of considerable length ensued in which Messrs. Horsford, Lovering, B. A. Gould, Jr., Paine, Guyot, W. F. Channing, Peirce, Agassiz, Everett, & Treadwell took part; and the Resolutions, the second having been amended\n\n[end page 295 | begin page 296]\n\n{{294}}\n\nas moved by Mr. Treadwell, were passed as follows:\n\n1. Resolved that the American Academy, earnestly recommend the adoption of the metrical scale for the barometer, destined for the observations made in behalf of the state of Massachusetts, and of the Smithsonian Institution, not only for the sake of convenience, but also as a first step leading to a general adoption of the metrical system of weights and measures in scientific matters.\n\n2. As regards the Thermometer, that the scale of Fahrenheit in actual use in this country, be retained for the present.\n\n3. That a committee be appointed to consider the prosperity and the practicability of introducing the modified Fahrenheit’s scale mentioned in the Report, or some other possessing similar advantages, as a universal scale, and to correspond with eminent meteorologists, and scientific societies.\n\n4. That notice be given to the Smithsonian Institution of the opinion of the Academy on the subject of this Report.\n\nThe Academy then\n\nVoted, that the committee to be appointed in pursuance of the foregoing resolutions, consist of the gentlemen who reported them, viz., Messrs. Guyot, Agassiz, Peirce, Lovering, & B. A. Gould, Jr.\n\nProf. Agassiz made an oral communications of considerable length upon the classification and homologies of radiated animals.\n\n{{Toronto Observatory.}}\n\nProf Lovering read a part of a letter from Capt. Lefroy, of the Toronto Observatory, to Mr. W. C. Bond, representing that there is danger of the magnetic observations at that observatory being discontinued after next March; and expressing a desire that the Academy would use its influence that that Observatory may be sustained for a further period of three years. He then offered the following Resolutions, which, after some remarks by Mr. Guyot in their support, were adopted:\n\n1. That, in the opinion of this Academy, it is highly desirable that the magnetical & meteorological observatory at Toronto, should be sustained for another period of three years.\n\n2. That a committee be appointed to correspond with\n\n[end page "
