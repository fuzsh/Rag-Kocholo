A few buckets of water quenched the fire, which is said to have caught from a defective stove pipe.\n\nAt 4 o'clock the engines were again called out by an alarm which proceeded from the vicinity of the post office. A shed in the rear of the refreshment saloon opposite the post office, on Clay street, had been set on fire, but the timely discovery the roof prevented any material damage.\n\nIt was gratifying to notice the alacrity with which the engine companies (Ed., Empire, Protection & Howard) brought their machines to the scenes of danger. The three fire companies which have been recently organized turned out in force sufficient to satisfy the people that they could be depended upon in the hour of peril. A singular feeling of security has arisen in the community since the formation of these companies.\n\nSource: Daily Alta California, Volume 1, Number 162, 8 July 1850 — LOCAL MATTERS.

It was purchased in New York, at a cost of $1200, which was subscribed by the friends of the company, and was but recently imported. As a matter of course, the firemen looked to the result of this trial with great anxiety, and it is only necessary to say that it proved equal to their greatest expectations. Water was thrown several feet above the top of the liberty pole on the Plaza with apparent ease, which is sufficient proof that the company can command any building in the city. After the exercises were over the company returned to their engine room, on Kearny street, where a fine cold collation had been spread out for the occasion. The room was beautifully decorated with flags, festoons and different emblems significant of the Fire Department. Among the invited guests who were present were a large number of the members of the Common Council, several city officials, and many citizens and members of other companies. Many pertinent speeches were made and appropriate sentiments offered, amid a flow of champagne.

Hundreds of ladies and gentlemen visited their rooms and partook of a splendid collation that was prepared. The engine has been lately imported from New York, and is said to be one of the most powerful in the Department It has been beautifully painted and ornamented in a magnificent style. A fine painting of the great May fire in 1850, as seen from Rincon Point, has been placed on the tower of the engine. On the rear is a beautiful picture of a pioneer, with rifle in hand, protecting his wife and children from the savages, who have set fire to his cabin and are now in pursuit. This company is one of the oldest in the city, and the representation of the pioneer is suggestive of that fact. There are several large figures 1. nude of solid silver, placed on different portions, and in front a large plate of burnished silver bearing the word “Empire.\" A brass dog, representing vigilance, is placed in front, and there are several emblems of our nationality to ornament the engine. It cost $3,700, and is pronounced to be one of the best that could be made. The entertainment room was exceedingly well furnished, and had been beautifully decorated. A magnificent wreath of flowers, presented by Mrs. G. W. Green, was placed over the President's chair, and ornaments of various descriptions were placed about the room.

W. D. Brown & Co., and had a view of the beautiful carriage which has been constructed by that firm for the use of Empire Co No. 1, of this city. An article of home manufacture is sometimes apt to be overvalued, sometimes, as in the case of home made paintings, actors and other artists, undervalued : but to the Empire hose carriage, which, in every particular, was built, painted, and ornamented in the establishment of Messrs. Brown & Co., it must be admitted that California has made a fair start in engine building, and has turned out as pretty a piece of workmanship as ever won the affections of one of the d’boys, and made him ready to swear by, stand by, and die for his machine. The Empire hose carriage is four-wheeled, constructed of hickory wood, on a new principle designed by the builders, and finished in every part with much taste, elegance, and exquisite workmanship. It is painted a very rich lake color or subdued crimson, with a narrow vermillion stripe, and a broader stripe of yellow. The mountings, lamps, etc , are of silver plate, the binding of brass The boxes are of polished mahogany ; on the front box. inscribed within a silver line, are the words : \" Instituted 1853; on the other box are inscribed the words: \"Empire Hose.\" In front, is a gold is American eagle, with outstretch wings, as if in the act of commencing her flight ; on either side of the eagle in a gilt grissly, seated upon an acorn, and holding in its fore paws a placard, with \" Empire\" inscribed upon it. Two tulip bells, of clear and exquisite tone, are attached to the carriage, and also two lamps, silver plated and skillfully wrought. The crab upon the tongue is also silver plated, and is of very superior workmanship. The entire carriage is in every respect a splendid specimen of the skill of San Franciscan artisans, and reflects great credit upon Messrs. Brown & Co., who have expended in its construction the sum of $1500.\n\nSource: Daily Alta California, Volume 6, Number 244, 4 October 1855 — MINING INTELLIGENCE [ARTICLE]\n\nEMPIRE No. 1.\n\n1855 November 3\n\nThe new engine and hose carriage of this company went into service on Wednesday, and has been on hand promptly at the first stroke of the bell.

The companies were Broderick. No. 1, and Pennsylvania, No. 12. The former gallantly offered to escort their brethren of the Pennsylvanians to their new house.\n\nAt eight o'clock the Brodericks, in full force, marched from their house on Sacramento street, above Kearny, to the house of the Pennsylvanians on Jackson street, above Kearny. The latter company was then accompanied back through Dupont and Sacramento streets to the house of No. 1. Here the guests accepted of the hospitalities of their hosts, after which the procession moved.\n\nFirst in the advance a stalwart fireman, bearing the American flag, and then Schultz's celebrated band, playing a martial air. Broderick Engine Company, numbering 90 strong, and preceded by Chief Engineer Scannell, Assistant Engineers, and Honorary Members of No. 1 followed, and after them the Junior Members of the company, with scarlet caps, dragging their “skeleton\" hose carriage, and numbering 35 strong.' A quaint caricature of a skeleton, with the words \"I’m here,\" which was posted on the cart, attracted treat attention and created much merriment.\n\nThe Pennsylvanians, to the number of eighty-five strong, followed, dragging their hose-carriage, their elegant \"steamer”, pulled by the Company's two splendid horses, bringing up the rear of the procession.\n\nThe Companies marched through Kearny street to Washington, and down that thoroughfare to Montgomery street. As they wheeled into the latter thoroughfare the demonstration appeared to the finest advantage. Every man carried a torch, whilst from the van, centre and rear of the line, shot rockets and Roman candles in the greatest profusion, . and a benzole light blazed from the funnel of the steamer.\n\nThe sidewalks, windows and roofs of buildings throughout Montgomery street were filled with ladies and gentlemen, the former waving kerchiefs and the latter continually cheering and otherwise manifesting their delight at the imposing pageant.\n\nPassing down Second street, the procession halted at the house of Tiger Engine Company, No. 14. Here they entered, and were \"treated\" with true firemen s hospitality.\n\nA number of the ‘Tigers\" fell into procession, and accompanied their fellow firemen to the new house of the Pennsylvanians, on Sixth street, just below Folsom street. The house of the latter was ablaze, and flags innumerable were suspended across the street.\n\nBefore the escorting Company were allowed to depart, the Keystone State boys pressed the New Yorkers into their elegant rooms, where, amidst the approving smiles of fair women and cheers of brave men, sentiments were proposed and responded to, and general hilarity, indulged in over the festive board.\n\nJust as the Broderick Company left they gave rousing cheers, which were as vociferously responded to by the Pennsylvania's. The latter Company subsequently entertained their lady guests, and a dance wound up their part of the evening's festivities.\n\nThe Broderick Company, after seeing their companions snugly ensconsced in their new and beautiful house, inarched down to Bryant and through that street to their own future headquarters, just west of Third, on that thoroughfare. Hundreds awaited their coming. The street on either side was alive with citizens of both sexes and all ages. Flags and streamers were suspended across the street, and the house illuminated from sidewalk to roof. The machine nicely housed, all repaired to the elegant hall in the second story, there two long tables, filled with the most sumptuous viands, were spread, and at the head of them across table, covered with loaves of frosted cake, and ornamented with fresh flowers, the work, evidently, of the fair friends of the gallant firemen.\n\nAnd now the substantial; were attacked with a vim only equaled by that which the Brodericks exhibit when attacking the raging element. Subsequently, toasts were proposed and suitably responded to, and not until the early hours ushered in the day was the \"house warming \" over. The Broderick Company did the handsome thing throughout, and their brethren of No. 12 appreciated the courtesies, as did the former in the reciprocal acts of courtesy extended to them by the latter, as also those received from Tiger Co. 14.\n\nAlthough the policy of removing these two companies from up town may not be questioned, still we, in common with all about us, will regret losing companies so efficient as \"Broderick\" and Pennsylvania\" have always shown themselves to be. As for their late Chinese neighbors, inhabiting the combustible localities of Sacramento, Jackson. and Pacific streets, we can only say that it would not at all surprise us if their stores and tenements were found draped in black to-day, from grief at the departure of those who have done so much towards preserving their property in days long sync.\n\nSource: Source: Daily Alta California, Volume 17, Number 5585, 21 June 1865 — FIREMEN'S FESTIVITIES – GRAND TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION, ETC.

No. 1, wishing to suitably acknowledge the courtesies shown and services rendered them by the Chief Engineer of the New York Fire Department, have caused to be manufactured, by Messrs. Pohlman & Belemere, of this city, the most magnificent Fireman's badge which we have ever had the pleasure of examining, which will be sent East by the steamer of the 18th. It is of solid California gold, and very elaborate and elegant design. The upper or safety pin is in the form of a hook and ladder, crossed and tied with a rope. From this pin depends a gold chain with square links, which is fastened at either end to the badge proper, which has a large pin upon the under side, to fasten it to the coat or vest. The badge is surmounted by an eagle, with rays and laurel wreath, and in the bill of the eagle is a scroll, bearing the inscription— \"No. 1, Broderick Engine Company, S. F.\" The centre of the badge or shield represents the coat-of-arms or great seal of the State of California, in gold and blue enamel, with thirteen stars and \" Eureka \" beneath. Around this is elaborate and beautiful open scroll-work embodying emblematic designs, and beneath is a tablet, inscribed \"John Decker, Chief Engineer.\" Upon the back is the following inscription : \"Presented by the officers and members of Broderick Engine Company, No. 1, San Francisco.

Esq., Chief Engineer of the New York Fire Department, as a token of their respect and high estimation of his character as a fireman and gentleman.\" The whole cost of this elegant testimonial was about $300.

At the head of the procession marched Chief Engineer Scannell, Fire Marshal Durkee, Foreman of the Broderick. Marcus Harris, and the splendid Band of the Second Artillery, which furnished exquisite music for the occasion. The cortege arrived in the Cemetery at 3 o'clock, and moved directly to the Firemen’s Plot, situated in a central and elevated portion of the grounds. Here had assembled large concourse of persons, some pedestrians, and other seated in carriages. In the centre of the plot assigned to the Broderick Company stands the monument, an imposing and symmetrical structure of marble. The base, solid and square, is handsomely carved, and the words “Broderick,\" and \"one,\" cut on either side. Above are the epitaphs of the deceased members of the Company. On the north face of the base are the words \"Organized June 4th, 1850.\" and \"Disbanded December 2d, 1866.\" On the south face appear these words, \" Name changed from Empire, October 7. 1859.” The pedestal, or shaft is surmounted by a female figure in an altitude of grief—a \" Niobe (sic) all tears. This bust is most elaborately and exquisitely carved. The effect at the unveiling of the monument was very fine.\n\nThe exercise commenced with a dirge by the band, after which Foreman Harris called upon Chief Engineer Scannell, himself the Foreman of the Company, and Mr. McLaughlin, another member, to unveil the statue. The resolutions passed by the Board of Supervisors complementary to the Volunteer Fire Department, were read, as also the report of the final proceedings the Company, by the Secretary, J. Carson. Edward B Cotter, late Foreman of the Company then advanced and delivered\n\nTHE ORATION.\n\nWe deeply regret our inability to give, as we intended this address in extensor.\n\nIt was an exceedingly meritorious production, and was listened to with intense interest. He commenced is saying that we were assembled for laudable purpose -- the fulfillment of an acknowledged obligation. Today we have the consummating a scared trust, and exhibiting a glorious example. We are saying to the world the memory of noble men and deeds lives after the deeds are apparently forgotten in the exciting rush of daily struggle. We are presenting an inducement to all around us to live useful lives, that they may secure posthumous honors which should ever be accorded to all our kind worthy of them. We are here to pay a tribute of respect to our dead fellow-members. The speaker next eloquently descanted on the dauntless courage and eulogized the five lamented comrades whose memory was this day commemorated.\n\nThe speaker next gave a brief recapitulation of facts bearing on the history of the Broderick Company, and then he passed on to pay a beautiful to the dead Senator alter whom the Company was named, and by whom it was founded.\n\nMr. Cotter next alluded to the abolishing of the Volunteer Department and the immediate inauguration of the Paid Fire Department.\n\nIn this connection he said:\n\n“ When the midnight bells toll forth the close of this day, after an existence of nearly seventeen years, what was the empire, and is now the Broderick Engine Company No. 1, ceases to be a distinct organization. Proud of our past record, jealous of our future fame, no member of our Company has sought office at the hands of the Fire Commission. Ready at all times to peril our lives and health for the protection of the lives and property of our fellow-citizens, no mercenary motive has swayed us in bygone days, and no temptations of emolument will seduce us from our enviable independence now.\n\n“ While we deem the experiment of a Paid Fire Department dangerous to the welfare, of community, we, as citizens. are disposed to lend encouragement to the reformation and contribute, as far as possible, to its success.\n\n“ Not only so, but we would urge all our follow firemen belonging to other Companies to do likewise. We would conjure them to banish all jealousies and heart burnings, and on occasions to lend the advantage of their experiences of firemen’s duties.\n\n“ Let them not smirch their present fair excutchtion by any sin of omission or commission. Wherever and whenever the inexperienced recruits who are to step into the shoes of the burned and scarred veterans require this advice be given freely, and that assistants of their predecessors, let that advice Given freely, and that assistances be promptly rendered. By such conduct the respect and esteem of our fellow citizens which now accompanies us in our retiracy will be increased and perpetuated.\n\nSuch disinterested magnanimous as those just given admirably illustrated the mode elements, which compound the late Volunteer Fire Department of San Francisco.\n\nIn concluding his excellent oration, the speaker said:\n\n“ Processed of an unsullied reputation in the past as firemen, let us each and every one strive to pursue such as course as will forever cause the citizens of San Francisco to point with well-founded pride to our Company, which has passed away. Let our future conduct be a fitting sequel to that which has gone before, and it will in years to come be deemed an honor to the best citizen in any community to be known as one who was once a member of Broderick Engine Company, No. 1.\"\n\nThe oration concluded, the band executed less lugubrious strains than before, after which the long procession defiled through the circuitous avenues of the cemetery, and departed from the City of the Dead, mingle again with things of the City of Living.\n\nSource: Daily Alta California, Volume 18, Number 7009, 3 December 1866\n\nFINIS.\n\n1866 December 2\n\nThe old Volunteer Fire Department of San Francisco, which has done good service in its day, and was the pride and boast of our city, goes out of existence at 12 o’clock to-night, and will be superseded by the Paid Department.\n\nSource:Daily Alta California, Volume 18, Number 7008, 2 December 1866 — CITY ITEMS.

[ARTICLE]\n\nA RELIC OF OLDEN TIMES\n\nOLD FIRE CART NOW IN THE POSSESSION OF THE EXEMPT FIREMEN.\n\nThe Hose on the Reel Is Made of Leather and Is Still In Good Condition.\n\n1895 August 27\n\nA relic of ancient times, mute reminder of the days when San Francisco depended upon volunteers for protection against fires, is the old hosecart recently discovered in one of the old warehouses of the Southern Pacific Company.\n\nSince it was turned over to the Exempt Firemen and given a place of honor by them in their hall on Brenham place it has been visited by many of the veterans whose pride it was in the days gone by, when at the alarm of fire they flew to their places on the drag and strove with might and main to win the \"Fox Tail.\"\n\nThe historic relic was built for the old Empire engine No. 1, the name of which was subsequently chanted to Broderick No. 1 after the death of Senator Broderick.\n\nProbably the most notable fire in which the old reel did service was the great Brannan-street fire which occurred on the night of November 28, 1876, and which destroyed the old German Hospital and a great amount of valuable property. The Broderick No. 1 was one of the star companies — the volunteers. Its house was on Sacramento street west of Kearny, and many were the times that this piece of equipment, now such a curiosity, led the procession when the possession of the \"Fox Tail\" was the reward for the company which should reach the fire first.\n\nThe late Dave Scannell was the foreman of the company then, and Tim Bainbridge, now in charge of the criminal records in the office of the Chief of Police, was a member of the company.\n\nThe engine for which the old cart carried the hose is now at the Almshouse. where it is kept for fire protection. It was found in the Southern Pacific warehouses on Brannan street by George T. Bowen and Assistant Chief Dougherty. They immediately communicated with H. O. Rogers, superintendent of the warehouse, and were referred to E. P. Vining, who presented the old cart to the Exempt Firemen.\n\nIn early days, when the old volunteer fire brigades were mustered out, the Chief distributed a number of these carts to citizens for their own protection. The one now in the possession of the Exempts fell into the hands of Michael Skelly, one of the old pioneers, and he lost track of it over twenty-eight years ago, and now, after nearly a third of a century, it has again come into prominence.\n\nThe hose is nearly 250 feet long and is made of leather, resembling that used for soling shoes, and is copper-riveted throughout its entire length. Loops of leather riveted on every few feet throughout its length serve as handholds for the firemen to move it easily, as the nozzlemen required. It was made by Cook & Sons, manufacturers of leather hose, and H. B. Cook, who is now the chief deputy in the Tax Collector's office, was a member of the firm.\n\nAN OLD FIRE DEPARTMENT RELIC FOUND IN A SOUTHERN PACIFIC WAREHOUSE.
