        "text": "After the War\n\nThe war ended in November 1918 and so did the Government contracts, it was now back to work as normal at Sunbeam. Thanks to the companyâs technically demanding war work, both on aircraft and aero engines, Sunbeam now had an extremely skilled workforce. Unfortunately John Marston passed away in 1918 during a holiday at Colwyn Bay and Thomas Cureton ably succeeded him as Chairman.\n\nSeveral models were available from a running chassis that sold from Â£655 to the Cabriolet that was available from Â£1,040. About 2,000 were made.\n\nFrom 1922 onwards the car became the 16/40hp., almost identical mechanically except for a new overhead valve engine.\n\nAll prices were reduced by Â£100 and during 1922 and 1923 a total of 895 were built.\n\nThe initial version was similar to the 16hp. but fitted with a 4.5litre, 6 cylinder engine. Several models were available including the basic running chassis, the Touring Model, the 4-Seater Sporting Model, the Saloon, the Limousine, the Landaulette and the Cabriolet. Prices varied from Â£965 for the chassis to Â£1,300 for the Saloon, Limousine, Landaulette, and Cabriolet. A total of about 900 were produced.\n\nFrom 1922 the car became the 24/60 with a more powerful overhead valve engine. About 500 were produced. In 1924 the car went through another transformation with the introduction of the 24/70hp. The new car had four wheel brakes as standard, and a new efficient gearbox. Prices varied from Â£1,060 for the running chassis to Â£1,625 for the Saloon, Limousine, Landaulette, and Cabriolet. A total of 102 were built.\n\nThe London Showrooms at 12 Princes Street, Hanover Square.\n\nIn 1919 the Automobile Association conducted and important test over 10,000 miles to determine the relative merits of benzol as a motor fuel.\n\nA 16hp. Sunbeam car was chosen for the test, and the 10,000 miles were covered in 62 days, with an average fuel consumption of 24.57m.p.g. After the test the engine was dismantled and showed no appreciable signs of wear or damage.\n\nAfterwards the car was sold to a gentleman in Wiltshire. Five years later he wrote to the company stating that the car had covered 100,000 miles, with only little attention, and had never let him down.\n\nIn 1919 after a wartime ban, trials and racing events were again held in Europe. A Sunbeam car competed in the famous hill climbing trial at Gaillon and achieved a new record, covering the 1 in 9 course at an average speed of 109m.p.h.\n\nInterior views of the factory in 1919."
