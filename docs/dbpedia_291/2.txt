One of the many series of maps produced by petrol and oil companies, this is from the National Benzole Co Ltd, a company formed in 1919 to sell British produced benzole that became used as a 'blender' with petrol. The company had become part of the joint "Shell-Mex and BP" company in 1957 and in the year this map was issued the benzole side of the business was hived off, no longer used as a fuel additive, and the brand would drop the 'benzole' from the title. It was also the year the 'Mercury' logo was updated and modernised as seen on this cover.

The map, by Philip & Sons, is designed to show the outlines of the five 'area' maps also issued but it does show the first "motorway" in the form of the Preston bypass section of the M6 opened in 1958 and so the road signs section show the shortlived versions of the new signs for such roads. These were designed by Calvert and Kinneir under the auspices of the Anderson Committee. Within a few years the Worboys Committee would undertake a complete review of all UK road signs and again designs by Calvert and Kinneir would be adopted replacing those seen here.
