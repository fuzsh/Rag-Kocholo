Vincent writes to Jean Dehorgny, the superior of the priests in Rome, about writing a letter to Cardinal Altieri per Dehorgny's request. He asks Dehorgny to review the letter and suggest any changes. He also asks Dehorgny to visit Cardinal Antoine to renew offers of obedience and reassure him regarding some members of his household who were seized. Vincent mentions others who are traveling and says he eagerly awaits Dehorgny's return to Paris.",
