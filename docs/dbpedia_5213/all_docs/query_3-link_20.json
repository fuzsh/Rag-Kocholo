        "text": "This is a very short essay on my life as a law student in the Faculty of Law of the University of Ceylon, Colombo, now known as the University of Colombo. It deals very briefly with the history of the Faculty of Law and its origins in the Department of Law in the Faculty of Arts of the University of Peradeniya, of which the first Vice Chancellor happened to be Sir Ivor Jennings, and goes on to describe student life in the Faculty of Law in the late sixties and early seventies. This essay was written specially for the website of the Alumni Association of the Faculty of Law (AAFL) of the University of Colombo\n\nThis article aims to analyze the legal teaching in France. Our ap- proach is guided by a double perspective: the distinction between critical and mundane schools and the notion of crisis, brought from political science. After a brief historical introduction, we will demon- strate how, in the twentieth century, the legal teaching evolved and produced what we call “classical legal teaching model”. Our focus, from that double perspective, aim to a dynamics where great social transformations cause a strong impact on french universities and, on the other hand, how the body of law scholars, to keep their domi- nant position, manage to transmit throw the crisis the elements that guarantee that domination, on the “legal science specificities” pretext. Heritage is the political science brought key-concept to understand that dynamics and the classic model production. Our conclusion is an attempt to confront that dynamics with the issues that the legal teaching faces nowadays – specially the discipline loss of centrality – asking the question of how this new crisis will be faced by the law schools.\n\n414 The history of the law faculties, of legal education and legal research, is a part of the history of the universities, but it is more than that. Law schools belong to two worlds: the academic and the legal, and many law professors, teachers or researchers are more familiar with legal professionals than with their colleagues from other faculties. In fact, many academic lawyers are also practising lawyers and true academics are a rare breed in law schools, only to be found in some unpractical, and hence very minor, fields like the philosophy of law. Moreover, unlike the subject of other sciences, law is not universal, but national, which means that national law, national legal culture and national legal professions have done as much to shape the law schools in the second half of the twentieth century as the global evolution of science and education, 1 which is generally disregarded by lawyers, even academics, when they discuss the history, the current situation or the reform of law faculties. Nevertheless, law schools took part in the general evolution of the European universities, 415 but sometimes the common pattern was warped by elements specific for the legal world and some evolutions were unique to law schools.\n\nThe article explores the 16-th century lawsuit in Paris University. If we look for the causes of future collisions in the 1586 court hearings, then we should speak more generally about the conflict between the Theology and Art Faculties, between the dean and the Rector, or between the Sorbonne and Navarra colleges. Latent rivalry, hitherto shadowed by struggle against the ‘common’ enemies, such as the Protestants, Jesuits, royal encroachments on academic privileges and property (such as Pré-aux-Clercs), the attempts to carry out a radical college reform, would boil over into an open conflict in the mid-17th century. Weapon in all these conflicts was University history. The author scrutinized the lawers’ arguments as the building materials for inventing traditions of Paris University.\n\nJohn Gilissen (1912–1988) was a high-profile legal academic at the Université libre de Bruxelles (°1834) and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (°1969). Personal – albeit fragmentary – archival records deposited with these universities permit to reconstruct his teaching (both ex cathedra-courses for big groups and intensive tutorials), impressive global scientific network and insatiable scientific curiosity. Gilissen is the author of standard works on many aspects of domestic legal history (both public and private), and acquired renown as the secretary-general of the Société Jean Bodin pour l’histoire comparative des institutions. His influential position as a public prosecutor, law professor and legal historian generates a unique insider’s perspective on the confessional, linguistic and constitutional transformation of the country from World War One to the First Reform of the State. The current law curriculum at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel still bears marks of Gilissen’s comparative approach to the history of civil law and his interest in the contemporary relevance of institutional history.\n\nThis article considers the influence of legal education based on the Dutch tradition of legal humanism on a Scottish student of the late seventeenth-century. An annotated textbook retained by Charles Binning contains notes from his studies with the Utrecht professor Cornelis van Eck and provides evidence for Van Eck’s teaching practices. Their education abroad equipped Scottish legal students for the professional, intellectual and cultural lives they would lead when they returned home. Exposure to the ideas contained in the books they studied and their relationships with the Continental learned gave Scottish scholars admission into the international Republic of Letters. This had significance for the development of the Scottish Enlightenment."
