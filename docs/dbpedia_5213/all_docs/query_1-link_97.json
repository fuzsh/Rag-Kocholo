        "text": "COMBINED INDEX LIST OF YWMLS – for check list purposes This index list of names is intended to be of help to contributors to YWMLS, who should find here both the correct form of a surname and that person’s first name(s) or initial(s), as also the ‘real’ name behind a pseudonym. For YWMLS purposes, we use the full names of literary authors, literary critics such as Derrida whose work may be seen as constituting a school of thought, and historical personages. We use initials only for modern literary critics. Authors who also write literary criticism should be listed with full names. We list the titles of anonymous works also, but only anonymous works; others, even if the author is not named in the text of YWMLS, we list under author. The following list is by no means complete. It has been compiled from the names indexed in volumes 61 to 66 of YWMLS, which have all been checked by individual contributors. Nevertheless, we are well aware that it contains some ‘doubles’, i.e. people who are listed under two forms of a name. This may be a question of one spelling being incorrect, or of accentuation, or of single or double surnames, or of the use of a full first name rather than an initial, or it may be a question of correct positioning, e.g. whether to list under ‘Thou’ or ‘De Thou’ (we believe the former to be correct in this case but it is not always so for names with ‘de’). Any and all corrections will be welcomed. Please send all further information and corrections, with your recommendation for the correct best form to use, to lisa.barber@wanadoo.fr Please note that the alphabetical order has been generated by computer, and is not always that used in YWMLS. Double surnames, those involving an apostrophe (D’ ..., L’..., etc.), and various other factors may affect the order of listing here."
