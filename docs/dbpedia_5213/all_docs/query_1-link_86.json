        "text": "Link to a video version of part of this essay: http://digital.library.fordham.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/VIDEO&CISOPTR=40&CISOBOX=1&REC=7 There is also a full length version elsewhere on the same server.\n\nA reading of Nietzsche's Zarathustra's teaching of the overman as at once an imitation of Empedocles and a satirical exrcise designed to show that the fantasy of the higher human being is human rather than superhuman. Nietzsche thus exposes the vanity of the idea of the overman as perspective point of view -- his reference is to Lucian's Downward Journey, an account of the soul's perspective on its own all-too-human vanities after death.\n\nThe role of music in «The Birth of Tragedy» presupposes the question of the relation Nietzsche had uncovered between 'music and words' in his theory of meter and rhythm in ancient Greek. This question reflects Nietzsche’s architectonically quantitative, measured and timed, theory of words and music for his courses on rhythm and meter as well as his discussion of tragedy and music in his first book. It will turn out that a recollection of the meaning of the spirit of music also reviews the logical questions of metaphor and truth, reprised in «The Gay Science» (with regard to language and the alchemical art of love in terms of both music and science).\n\nas early as 1869, in his notes from Basel, Nietzsche had paralleled the musical culture of ancient Greece and the song culture of medieval Europe precisely for the sake of an understanding of Greek lyric poetry and tragedy. Thus Nietzsche declared that “for the Greeks, text and music were so intimately joined that without exception one and the same artist created both of them.” Nietzsche further observed that the marriage of text and music was “in no way a rarity: think of the troubadours, the Minnesänger, and even the guild of Meistersingers” (Fruehe Schriften Vol 5, p. 308; cf. p. 367)."
