DuLong\n\nWARNING: I am in the process of updating this bibliography so you will notice some things are crossed out because they are no longer valid and I have yet to find a replacement. Also, I am not done yet indicating with asterisks the works that are now available online. JPD, 20 April 2016.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTracing noble ancestors in France can be challenging. However, the researcher is blessed with a variety of published and manuscript resources to rely upon. In this partially annotated bibliography I list some of the more valuable books, articles, and indexes to manuscript collections available to the researcher. I also list some works that are less than accurate since you will probably encounter them sooner or later and you should be prepared for them.\n\nThis web page originally appeared as a post on a CompuServ genealogy forum in April 1992. It was written as an addition to Michael K. Smith's \"Bibliography for Research in British and Continental Royal and Noble Lineages and Heraldry\" posted on the same forum as two files, ROYALB.TXT and ROYALJ.TXT. I added this information because his otherwise very detailed and valuable listing lacked crucial works for doing French noble research. This is not a comprehensive bibliography but only an update of my original CompuServ file. It reflects what I have learned over the intervening years by working on the Baillon and Le Neuf research projects. Basically, this represents my working bibliographic notes.\n\nThis bibliography only covers the nobility prior to the French Revolution and not during the Napoleonic Empire or the Restoration. These periods are beyond my expertise. I have included a few titles relating to the nobility of New France.\n\nMost of these works are in French. With a little effort, and brushing up on your High School French, you should be able to extract valuable information from these sources. You will find many of these books in public libraries with large genealogy collections or through the Family History Library. However, some of them you are more likely to find only at large university graduate libraries, often in storage.\n\nSince I originally wrote this bibliography in 1999 there has been a major improvement. Many of these works, especially the older ones, are available in digital files that can be downloaded for free. When I know for sure that there is a digital version of a work, I will indicate it with the use of an asterisk. I suspect others are also now available online. You can search Google, Gallica, FamilySearch or the Internet Archive for digital copies. Some of these works are also available for purchase on CDs or DVDs. In the past, many of these CD and DVD products were available from GeneaGuide.com, but that firm is apparently no longer in business. However, many of these works are now available from Histoire & Généalgie. In fact, this company offers a special Cabinet Généalogiste Expert which includes most of the major works mentioned in this bibliography and consists of 22 CDs or DVDs for the price of 988.00 euros. The individual works in this collection can also be purchased separately from this company. Although many of the works in this special collection can be downloaded for free, the free versions are not always high quality scans.\n\nWhen you suspect you have a French ancestor who was a noble you must launch a research project to verify your suspicions. You can not merely accept vague family traditions or the misleading use of prepositions in your surname. Contrary to popular belief, the use of \"de,\" \"de la,\" and \"du\" in a surname is NOT a not sign of nobility. Also, keep in mind that merely possessing a seigneurie, that is, a manor and landed estate, is also not proof of nobility as many wealthy commoners purchased seigneuries. However, if you find your ancestor consistently referred to in original documents as an écuyer (squire), chevalier (knight), or some other noble title, then you have an interesting clue well worth pursuing.\n\nThe general approach I recommend for tracing a French noble family is as follows:\n\nFirst look through the key references and construct a detailed research bibliography. Make sure you include all the bibliographic information including any cryptic codes and numbers. These mysterious pieces of information are usually document codes and call numbers.\n\nNow systematically hunt for the books and articles on this bibliography. This process usually requires visiting several university libraries and the extensive use of interlibrary loan. Also, some of the items will be found at the Family History Library. Carefully, review what others have found about the family you are researching. Perhaps your problem has already been solved by another genealogist.\n\nIf necessary, make up a list of manuscripts to consult in France. Although you could visit France to do the research, few of us can afford this. Besides, when in France why would you want to be in an archives or library when you could be touring one of the most magnificent countries in the world. Instead, I suggest that you order digital copies of the documents. Digital copies are usually cheaper than microfilm or paper copies. Processing a reproduction order can take up to and beyond six months. Be patient. I find it is better to get copies than to hire a researcher in France. This way you can pour over the evidence at your leisure. Be prepared to encounter some difficult to read script.\n\nLastly, analyze your evidence and make sure you have an original document or a printed source citing original documents to prove the link between every generation. Never settle for less.\n\nI also strongly suggest you find others researching the same family and band together to divide the labor and share the costs. In my own case I have been very lucky to become a team member with some rather brilliant colleagues, namely René Jetté, Roland-Yves Gagné, Gail F. Moreau, and Fr. Joseph Dubé. I consider myself as the junior partner and I am fortunate to work with such talented people and to learn from them.\n\nI would also like to thank Jean-Philippe Gérard for reading over this bibliography and supplying me with some helpful comments.\n\nLastly, in addition to Smith's bibliography, you might want to consult Leo van de Pas's \"Royal Genealogical Book Evaluations\" web site.\n\nKey References\n\nWhenever I start a project to study a French noble family I always consult these essential of tools. These key references will show you the state of the knowledge for the family you are interested in researching. They point to published and manuscript documentation about French noble and bourgeois families. Most of the manuscripts will be found in France at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BN or BNF, National Library of France) or the Archives nationales (AN or ANF, National Archives of France) in Paris. However, many of the books and articles can be found in North America. The addresses for these important institutions are:\n\nCentre d'accueil et de recherche des Archives nationales (CARAN)\n\n60, rue des Francs-Bourgeois\n\n75141 Paris Cedex 03\n\nFRANCE\n\nThe entrance is on 11, rue des Quatre-Fils - 75003 Paris.\n\nWeb: http://www.culture.fr/culture/sedocum/caran.htm\n\nNote: The Archives nationales is undergoing renovation until 2004.\n\nBibliothèque nationale de France\n\nSite Richelieu\n\n58 rue de Richelieu\n\n75002 Paris\n\nFRANCE\n\nThe manuscript collection is at the Richelieu site, but the books and many other offices are located at the new library at Site François Mitterrand, Quai François Mauriac, 75013 Paris.\n\nWeb: http://www.bnf.fr/\n\nBibliothèque nationale de France. \"Inventaire des instruments de recherche: manuscrits occidentaux.\" About 2,700 microfiche. Paris and London: Chadwyck-Healey, 1991.\n\nImagine all the indexes, inventories, guides, and research tools for the western manuscripts of the Bibliothèque nationale on microfiche and that is what is in this collection. The most important item for genealogists researching French nobles is the \"Table alphabétique du Cabinet des titres\" (Noms de famille des 6 premières séries, 10 vol. manuscrits). This is the same as bound volumes found at the library under the title \"Répertoire alphabétique des séries généalogiques de l'ancien cabinet des titres de la Bibliothèque nationale\" (mss., 10 vols., in-fol.1898). The original index is on the shelve near the doorway as you enter the Department of Manuscripts. This index is the key to the crucial Cabinet des titres, that is, the Office of Noble Titles. In these titles you will find evidence submitted to document nobility and proving noble status back several generations. You will find the papers of the juges d'armes (Judges of Arms)with one exception, all members of the Hozier familyand the papers of Bernard Chérin, généalogiste des Ordres du roi (Genealogist of the King's Orders). On this index you will find out what parts of the Cabinet des titres hold documents concerning the surname you are researching. Many of the indexes listed under the Libraries and Archives Guides section of this web page can also be found in this microfiche set. You are more likely to find this microfiche set at larger university graduate libraries.\n\nThis index to the Cabinet des titres is now available on CD from GeneaGuide.com. The full citation for this product is:\n\nGrando, Denis, and Christophe Levantal, eds., in collaboration with Daniel Catan and Christian Robert-Leroy, Répertoire alphabétique des six séries généalogiques du Cabinet des titres de la Bibliothèque nationale de France, CD, based on the original index prepared under the direction of Ulysse Robert (Paris: Générep, 2001).\n\nNote: The original manuscript index for the first six series in the Cabinet des titres is now available via Gallica.\n\nArnaud, Etienne. Répertoire des généalogies françaises imprimées. 3 vols. Paris: Privately printed by the author, 1978-1981.\n\nVol. 1, A-F, 599 p.\n\nVol. 2, G-M, corrections and additions to Vol. 1, 553 p.\n\nVol. 3, N-Z, corrections and additions to Vols. 1 and 2, 592 p.\n\nEven before I look at the microfiche indexes of manuscripts, I usually consult Arnaud's index of printed French genealogies. It includes not only nobles but also many bourgeois families. A family citation will often have the province of origin, associated estates, and a code indicating the published works containing information about the family. You will have to refer to the front of each volume for the full bibliographic information that matches the code. Remember to check vols. 2 and 3 for additions and corrections. Arnaud will usually point to all the well known published works. Arnaud also conveniently points to citations for a family in the Jougla de Morenas and de Warren's Grand armorial de France ([1934-1952] 1975), Saffroy (1968-1988), and some original manuscripts at the Bibliothèque nationale. This tool is in need of an update to catch up with the all the materials published since 1981 in France and Québec.\n\nArnaud's index is now available on CD from GeneaGuide.com. The CD contains additional families and corrections. In addition, this same firm sells another CD entitled Bibliothèque généalogique de France, which indexes published genealogies of at least three generations since 1982. It is meant to complement Arnaud's work.\n\nArnaud's index is available on CD from Histoire & Généalogie. The CD contains additional families and corrections.\n\nSaffroy, Gaston. Bibliographie généalogique, héraldique et nobiliaire de la France des origines à nos jours. Imprimés et manuscrits. 5 vols. Paris: Librairie Gaston Saffroy, 1968-1988.\n\nVol. 1, General topics, nos. 1-16008, xxviii p., 734 p.\n\nVol. 2, Topics organized by provinces, French colonies, the Latin Orient, and refugees, nos. 16009-33963, viii p., 872 p.\n\nVol. 3, Genealogies organized by surname, nos. 33964-52222, vi p., 831 p.\n\nVol. 4, Index, iv p. 538 p.\n\nVol. 5, Supplement and index, nos. 52223-57484, by Geneviève Saffroy (Gaston Saffroy's daughter).\n\nThis is the masterpiece bibliography for the French nobility. Saffroy records published secondary sources as well as some primary source manuscripts in the Bibliothèque nationale and other libraries and archives in France. Although Arnaud points to some manuscripts at the Bibliothèque nationale, Saffroy's work offers more manuscript citations but is still not comprehensive. I usually check vol. 3 first because it is organized by family surnames. I then move on and check vol. 2 for information about the area in which my noble ancestors lived. The index is of limited help since it is only for authors and titles. Saffroy assigns a unique accession number at the beginning of each citation. Occasionally, other indexes will refer you to Saffroy and then indicate this number. Please see vol. 1, pp. xxvii-xxviii for a list of abbreviations used in the citations.\n\nThe obscure code at the end of many citations in Saffroy are the call numbers used at the Bibliothèque national. For example, [8 LM1 26 is the call number for La Chenaye-Desbois and Badier's Dictionnaire de la noblesse ([1863-1876] 1980). In general, if you see the abbreviation BN ms. fr. or BN n. acq. fr. followed by a number in a Saffroy citation, then it is indicating the French Manuscript Collection or the New Acquisitions French Manuscript Collections at the Bibliothèque national. Arnaud (1981) also points to Bibliothèque nationale call numbers and uses Fr. and NA to indicate manuscript collections at this institution. I can not emphasize enough how important it is to read the introductory materials in both Saffroy and Arnaud to understand all their subtleties.\n\nIzarny-Gargas, Louis d', Jean-Jacques Lartigue; Jean de Vaulchier. Nouveau nobiliaire de France: Recueil de preuves de noblesse: Notices de 30.000 familles nobles d'Ancien Régime origines, armes, preuves de noblesse et sources archivistiques. 3 vols. Versailles : Mémoires & Documents, 1997-1998.\n\nVol. 1, A-D;\n\nVol. 2, E-L;\n\nVol. 3, M-Z.\n\nThis is a recent and welcomed addition to essential tools for researching French noble families. In this work you will find an index to published and manuscript proofs of nobility, which are rich in genealogical information. The introductory material is particularly worthwhile reading as it explains how one became a noble in France, what positions were ennobling, how nobility could be lost, and the rules for proving nobility in order to enter prestigious social institutions. It is organized by surname and then seigneurie or province. Titles of documents, their date, and location are given for the families listed. Lastly, the blazon of arms, if known, are provided. This reference work should be added to any major genealogical collection with a French interest. More information about this publication, including how to order it, can be found at the Mémoire et Document web site. At this web site you will also see that this book is now available on CD.\n\nGérard, Jean-Philippe. Répertiore des ressources généalogique et héraldiques du Départment des manuscrits del a Bibliothèque nationale de France. Versailles: Mémoire & Documents, 2003.\n\nI have been remiss in not adding this important work sooner to this bibliography. M. Gérard provides us not only with a bibliographic guide to many valuable genealogical and heraldry documents in the Department of Manuscripts at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, but he also provides practical information about using these documents and gives us some insight into the history and organization of the Cabinet des titres. The book is organized by the category of the documents, but there is an index included. This book is available from Mémoire et Document.\n\nGenealogical Dictionaries\n\nThe works in this section are genealogical dictionaries that contain published information about nobles and royals in France. Their quality range from excellent and well documented to useful finding aids only to absurd works requiring great caution. Most, but certainly not all, of these works are organized by family surname.\n\n*Anselme de Ste-Marie, Père.

Père Anselme de Ste-Marie was Pierre de Guibours (1625-1694). After his death the project was taken over by Honoré Caille du Fourny (1630-1713). It was completed by Paul Lucas (1683-1759) alias Pére Simplicien and François Raffard (1655-1726) alias Père Ange de Ste-Rosalie.\n\nThis is the definitive work on the royal house and peerage of France. It is the French equivalent of the English Complete Peerage. Once you become accustomed to the way it is laid out, by how a family was associated to the king and his household or when a titled peerage was established, it becomes easy to work with. Considering when it was produced, it is very modern. Père Anselme and his editors showed a great concern for documentation and cited sources in the margins. They even quoted the entire text of documents creating peerages. Each volume has its own index and there is a general index in the last volume. Vol. 9 is dedicated to recording the members of the Order of the Holy Spirit. You should use this set in conjunction with Potier de Courcy ([1868-1879] 1968).\n\n*Aubert de la Che[s]naye-Desbois, François-Alexandre, et Jacques Badier.

Much of it is plagiarized from earlier works, usually Père Anselme ([1723-1733] 1967). The documentation of other more careful researchers is striped out when they pilfer the words of others. They do not cite any sources based on their own research either. Nor do they include transcriptions of original documents. My opinion of it has become more mild over the years. It is a widely published work that appears in many libraries. Although I use it with caution, it is a convenient finding aid that will notify you if the family you seek is prominent enough to have others write about it. The challenge is then to find where these authors got their data. Now available on CD from GeneaGuide.com.\n\nCarretier, Christian. Les ancêtres de Louis XIV: 512 quartiers. 2nd rev. ed.

Paris: Imprimerie Royale, 1839-1848.\n\nLouis-Philippe, the Citizen King of the French, created a special shrine to commemorate the crusaders when he remodeled Versailles. Vol. 6, parts 1 and 2, of this work lists the knights, gives some biographical details, and presents their arms. Be forewarned that some of these arms and some of the crusaders are bogus. Nevertheless, it is an interesting work to examine. You can access it online at Gallica.\n\n*Hozier, Louis-Pierre d'. Armorial général ou registres de la noblesse de France. 13 vols. Paris: Firmin-Didot, 1738-1908.\n\nIt is very important that you understand that the manuscript \"Armorial général\" is distinct and very different from the published Armorial général. It is also crucial that you know a little about the role of the d'Hozier family.\n\nShortly after Louis XIII established the office of judge of arms a member of the d'Hozier family occupied the position. A member of this family held the office until the Revolution and later under the Restoration. Their official title became: \"généalogiste de la maison du roi, juge général des armes et blasons, et garde de l'armorial général de France.\" For several generations this dynasty of genealogists were responsible for accrediting the nobility of French families and recognizing and registering their arms. The manuscript \"Armorial général\" was the result of an interesting tax initiative on the part of Louis XIV. In 1696 the King insisted that everyone register their arms and pay a tax. Those bourgeois without arms, but with means, were granted arms and then taxed. Charles-René d'Hozier was charged with compiling this information into the \"Armorial général.\" He did so between 1697 and 1707 placing the information in 48 manuscript volumes organized by province. Many French familiesincluding many bourgeois familiescan be found in the manuscript \"Armorial général\" in the Cabinet Des titres. However, the only information you will find in the manuscript is a description of their arms and a drawing of them. Also, it should be noted that some complete rolls of arms collected for the Armorial général in 1696 are available in print for specific regions and provinces. For example, see Meurgey de Tupigny's (1965-1967) armorial of Paris.\n\nDespite the shared title, the thirteen published volumes of the Armorial général is not the same information collected for the 1696 tax and found in the manuscript \"Armorial général.\" The published Armorial général is the work of Louis-Pierre d'Hozier, the nephew of Charles-René d'Hozier. It contains only the most prominent French families at the time of the publication. Each family has a written family history with footnotes pointing to original documents and published sources. The first 10 vols. were published from 1738 to 1768. Supplemental volumes were published in 1868, 1872, and 1908. Now available on CD from GeneaGuide.com.

Moréri tends to repeat his contemporary Père Anselme ([1723-1733] 1967). Nevertheless, he sometimes has information that is not otherwise available. M.

Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1979-1984.\n\nAnyone doing French genealogical research on either peasants, bourgeois, or nobles would benefit from reading Mousnier. He has prepared a social guide to the world of our ancestors. His chapters dealing with nobility, heraldry, the peerage, and the royal household are superb.\n\nBourgeois Gentlemen and Robins\n\nMolière poked fun in his plays at bourgeois gentlemen who made money in lucrative positions and then tried to pass themselves off as nobles. They are important to us because many of our noble ancestors you will find trace back to an grandfather who was ennobled because of his office. The son would try to pass as a noble and the grandson would usually succeed at the charade. By time the family arrived in New France, they might have been passing as bona fide nobles for several generations. One of the important ways to enhance your families noble pretensions was to make sure your son married the daughter of a true noble family. The downwardly mobile noble would allow his daughter to marry the upwardly mobile bourgeois's son and thus we gain a gateway to the ancient nobility.\n\nFamilies that became noble through holding offices were called nobles of the robe, or \"robins,\" in contrast to those hereditary nobles with ancient lineages who were called nobles of the sword. Office holders tended to insure that their sons would inherit their office and after a generation or two the nobility attached to the office was now firmly a fixed to the family. The sovereign courts were the most important. These included the royal or king's council, Chambres des comptes (Court of Finances), Cour des aides (Court of the Aids Taxes), Cour des monnaies (Currency Court), the various provincial Parlements, and the most prestigious of them all the Parlement de Paris. Other important magistrates included the officials in the Bureau de ville of Paris, which would include the Prévôte des marchands (the mayor), the Échevins (the aldermen), and the Conseillers de ville.\n\nBlanchard, François [or Guillaume]. \"Les généalogie des présidents du Parlement de Paris et des conseillers du Parlement de Paris jusqu'en 1712.\" 36 mss. vols. on 4 microfilm reels, 0656806-0656809, Family History Library.\n\nThis manuscript provides genealogical information about leading Parisian families involved in the administration of the city.

Saint-Nazaire-le-Désert: Références, 1996.\n\nThis is a must consult work if you find any of your ancestors involved in the Parlement de Paris. Unlike the British Parliment, this was not a legislative body, but rather the highest court of appeal in France. It had many other administrative duties including the registering of royal acts to make them official. If your ancestors was a member of this court, then he would have been educated in canon, Roman, and customary law probably at a university like the ones in Orléans, Paris, or elsewhere in France. Basic information about the service of each person is provided and some genealogical details are given. As these positions became hereditary, and there was a lot of intermarriage between the families, it is often possible to trace several generations for some families in this work.\n\nVilleneuve, Gérard de. Comment rechercher les origines d'un magistrat Parisien. Versailles: Centre Généalogique de Paris, 1985.\n\nThis is the first volume of a projected multi-volume work. It identifies the sources of information dealing with the nobility of the robe. Unfortunately, this work does not yet go to the end of the alphabet. To my knowledge, no other volumes have been completed. His book covers ennobled administrators, lawmakers, and judges.\n\nNobility in New France\n\nMany nobles came to New France as officers or administrators. Although most of them returned to France after their tour of duty, some remained and founded families that can still be found in Québec, the Maritimes, and Louisiana. The following works concentrated on noble families in Québec.\n\n*Auclair, Elie-J. Les de Jordy de Cabanac: Histoire dúne ancienne famille noble du Canada.

You should use his dictionary because he includes citations and it is more recently updated. However, the genealogical tables provide a nice visual way to look at these families. I hope he continues to update his dictionary. This have become a very useful tool, but keep in mind he does not trace these families roots back in France.\n\n__________. \"Les écuyers de la Nouvelle-France: noble ou roturiers?\" Mémoires de la Société généalogique canadienne-française 68:2 (Summer 2017): 136-156.\n\nDrolet analyzes what is known about people claiming to be nolbes (écuyers / squires) in New France and discusses whether or not we know if they were indeed nobles, recently ennobled, or commoners pretending to be nobles.\n\nFitte de Soucy, Louis de, and Miren de Fitte de Soucy.

The extensive lists and bibliographies (pp. 161-208) she offers are the best places to start to see if you have a French Canadian ancestor who was noble and to check if there is anything published on the family. Be warned that she only covers people living as nobles in New France and not those who might have noble ancestry back in France. For example, she does not list Catherine Baillon, Anne Couvent, or Jeanne Le Marchand.\n\nGagné, Roland-Yves, \"Les origines des familles Le Neuf et Le Gardeur,\" Mémoires de la Société généalogique canadienne-française:\n\nPart I, \"Les origines des familles Le Neuf et Le Gardeur,\" 63:3 (Autumn 2012) : 174-198;\n\nPart II, \"De Richard Le Neuf à Jean et Jean dits Le Neuf, frères,\" 64:1 (Spring 2013): 9-27;\n\nPart III, \"Les enfants de Jean Le Neuf le jeune et de Marguerite Le Gardeur,\" 64:3 (Autumn 2013): 199-216;\n\nPart IV, \"Les cinq enfants de Mathieu Le Neuf et Jeanne Le Marchand,\" 64:4 (Winter 2013): 261-280;\n\nPart V, \"Les frères Robert et Jean Le Gardeur,\" 65:1 (Spring 2014): 23-40;\n\nPart VI, \"Les familles alliées Lainé et Poullain,\" 65:2 (Summer 2014): 97-108;\n\nPart VII, \"Jean Le Gardeur, Jeanne Le Tavernier et leurs enfants,\" 65:3 (Autumn 2014): 213-226;\n\nPart VIII, \"Boniface et René Le Gardeur, sieurs de Tilly,\" 65:4 (Winter 2014): 261-276.

Gagné's research clearly establishes the origins of both the Le Neuf and the Le Gardeur families in Normandie. In the case of the Le Neufs, he demonstrates how this family went from being tanners to nobles over several generations.\n\nGagné, Roland-Yves, and Laurent Kokanosky, \"Les origins de Philippe Amiot (Hameau), de son éspouse Anne Couvent et de leur neveu Toussaint Ledran,\" Mémoires de la Société généalogique canadienne-française 58, no 1, issue 251 (Spring 2007): 17-58.\n\nGagné and Kokanosky identify the places of origin back in France for the Amiot, Couvent, and Ledran family.

The arms our ancestors used and the orders they were awarded can turn into clues you might need to use to solve a genealogical problem. This was certainly the case in the research we did on the ancestry of Catherine Baillon. We used a seal and a display of arms to solve two different problems and to prove the link between generations.\n\nBefore proceeding with citations on these topics, I would like to direct your attention to the French Heraldry and Related Topics web page. This is one of my favorite sites to visit. François Velde has done a tremendous job providing us with information about French heraldry, nobility, royalty, and orders.

Paris: Imprimerie nationale, 1881.\n\nDemay provides us with several valuable books containing descriptions of seals in various collections. Pierre de Clairambault (1651-1740), as the genealogist of the prestigious Order of the Holy Spirit, had an extensive collection of seals depicting the arms of the nobility and royalty. We were particularly fortunate on the Baillon project because Demay had inventoried seals from Picardy, Flanders, and Normandy, all areas we were researching. Typically, Demay transcribes the motto on the seal, describes it in detail, indicates the original document the seal was attached to, and provides an identification number so you can examine the seal or, more likely, a plaster cast of the seal in La salle de sigillographie et d'héraldique at the Archives nationales. Some illustrations are also included.\n\nDevreaux, Pierre. Blazons et armoiries: témoins de notre histoire. St-Malo, France: Éditions d'Art Derveaux, 1987.\n\n__________. Provinces de France: histoire et dynasties. St-Malo, France: Éditions d'Art Derveaux, 1989.\n\nDevreaux is an excellent heraldry artist who has made some spectacular wall charts showing the lineages of the French kings, the dukes of Burgundy, and the Dukes of Brittany. These charts include beautifully done colorful images of the arms of the husbands and wives. These two books are illustrative of the quality of his art.\n\nDubuisson, Pierre Paul. Armorial des principles maisons et familles du royaume. Original ed. 1757. Reprint ed.

He provides the blazon as well and often names the family's seigneuries.\n\nFauteux, Aegidius. \"Armorial du Canada français.\" 2 vols. Typed manuscript at the Salle Gagnon, Bibliothèque centrale de Montréal, n.d.\n\nThis manuscript is worth consulting if you do not find what you seek in Massicotte and Roy's French Canadian armorial. Unfortunately, it is not published and you must consult it at the Salle Gagnon, Bibliothèque centrale, in Montréal.\n\n__________. Les Chevaliers de Saint-Louis en Canada. Montreal: Les Éditions des Dix, 1940.\n\nThe Royal and Military Order of St-Louis was founded by Louis XIV to reward officer for bravery and service.

Engraved by Beaumont, Graveur ordinaire de la Ville. Paris: Éditions Contrepoint, 1977.\n\nBeautifully done set of engravings showing the arms of the mayor (Prévôt des marchands) and aldermen (Échevins) of Paris before the French Revolution. Not well documented, but so far I have found it to correspond well with other data my colleagues and I have collected on some of these officials.\n\nHozier, Jean-Françios-Louis d'. Recueil de tous les membres composant l'ordre royal et militaire de Saint-Louis depuis l'année 1693. 2 vols. Paris: J. Smith, 1817-1818.\n\nThis book is organized by the date in which a gentleman was made a knight in the Order of St-Louis. Because it lacks an index, it is difficult to search. Also, some Canadians are missing from this compilation. Lastly, it ends its coverage in 1743. You are better off using Fauteux's Les Chevaliers de Saint-Louis en Canada (1940) who used this work in preparing his own. Nevertheless, this work is worth consulting if you are searching for someone who held this order, but was not French Canadian or Acadian. It this list is easily accessible online at Gallica.\n\n*Massicotte, Édouard-Zotique, and Régis Roy. Armorial du Canada français. 2 vols.

Armorial de la généralité de Paris. 4 vols. Macon, 1965-1967.\n\nThis is a well done example of a concentrating on the \"Armorial général\" manuscript of arms for a particular region, Paris. It has the blazons (technical descriptions of coats-of-arms) for the families living in and around Paris. It also has blazons for corporations, churches, and guilds. He also has a list of published armorials based on the \"Armorial général\" manuscript for other provinces. The introductory material in these volumes is an excellent explanation of the 1696 arms tax and the history of the \"Armorial général.\"\n\nJougla de Morenas, Henri, and Raoul de Warren.

The surname and occasionally the associated estate names as well as the province of origins are recorded. Each family is assigned an accession number. Frequently a drawing is made of the arms. Some families have partial genealogies and family tables included. The authors also mention the sources for their information including manuscripts at the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Unfortunately, the inclusion of sources only starts haphazardly with the letter \"E\" in vol. 3 and does not become standard until vol. 4. Vol. 7 is a supplement with additions and corrections. It is important to get a description of your ancestor's possible arms. This will become a visual clue that you will learn to use in your research to differentiate families with similar surnames. The Grand armorial de France is the best place to start your search for the arms of a French family. This work is now also available on CD from Mémoire et Document.\n\n*Paris, Louis.

It has a description of the seal, the motto, the name of the document and a unique number you can use to examine the seal at the La salle de sigillographie et d'héraldique of the Archives nationales in Paris. This was projected to be published in two volumes. However, only vol. 1, covering A-M, was published.

His website also holds many other interesting articles relating to heraldry in Canada.\n\nExample Family Histories\n\nFrench genealogists have compiled some rather well done reports, especially considering when some of them were working.

Bertrand not only cites medieval cartularies, he includes the relevant\n\nparts in his appendix. Cartularies are charters usually preserved at monasteries and recording donations of the devoted. They are packed with genealogical data and are essential for doing medieval research.\n\n*Butkens, Christophe. Trophées tant sacrés que profanes du duché de Brabant. 2 vols.

He was one of the first to take great care to cite his sources. His work on the great feudal families is rare and not yet microfilmed. Yale University Library has most of them in their Rare Book Collection.\n\nJetté, René. Traité de généalogie. Montréal: Les Presses de l'Université de Montréal, 1991.\n\nJetté's treatise on genealogy is a breakthrough work for a number of reasons. However, in the context of this web site, his most important contribution was to point out three lines going back from Québec and Acadia to Charlemagne. Although one of these lines he latter modified when further evidence came forwardsee the article by Jetté, DuLong, Gagné, and Moreau (1997 and 1999) cited in the Nobility in New France sectionhis work has been an inspiration to several other North American French researchers to try and trace back other noble families.\n\n*La Roque, Gilles André.

The last two volumes contain transcriptions of proofs in the first two volumes. This set is difficult to work with because of its confusing organization and lack of a thorough index. However, if you have a family with any ties to the Harcourts, then you must consult this work. Now available on CD from GeneaGuide.com.\n\nLeportier, Paul. Familles médiévales normandes. 3 vols.

Vol. 1 contains Beaumont (counts of Meulan, Leicester, and Warwick), de Bellme, Montgommery (counts of Bellme), de Ponthieu, d'Alenon, de Tosny (lords of Conches, barons of Flamstead), Hauteville (kings of Sicily, princes of Antioche; counts of Mortagne and of Perche, the lords of Montfort-sur-Risle and of Bertrand de Briquebec, Briquessart (vicounts of de Bayeux and counts of Chester); vicounts d'Arques; Tesson (barons of Thury and Saint-Sauveur), Crespin du Bec-Crespin, Dangu and Tillires, de Briouze, Paynel of Moutiers-Hubert, Hambye, Moyon, and Marcei; de La Haye in lower Normandy, the lords of Ligle, the lords of Beaufou, Peverel, Reviers (counts of Devon and Vernon), de Vassy, de Bricqueville, Aux Epaules, and de Campion. Vol. 2 covers du Hommet, de Conteville, Géré alias Giroie, Malet, de Ferrières, de Thibouville, de Colombières, de Mortemer, Bacon, de Villiers et de Vierville, Bigot, du Merle, de Bailleul, Suhard, d'Ouessy. I have no information on the contents of vol. 3.\n\nPâris, Bertrand, with the contribution of Paul Leportier. La Famille de Corday. Mayenne, France: Éditions Régionales de l'Ouest, 1994.\n\nThis well researched and documented book is of interest because the Le Neuf and Le Gardeur families of New France have a matrilineal descent from the Corday family. Furthermore, this same family gave birth to the heroine Charlotte Corday who stabbed to death the revolutionary rabble rouser Marat in his bath and was guillotined for her effort!\n\nLibrary and Archives Guides\n\nI must explain my approach to libraries and archives. I treat them as military objectives. I first identify the targets of choice, that is, the libraries and archives most likely to hold the data I am interested in. I then learn everything thing I can about the targeted institution including organization, catalogues, cataloguing systems, manuscript indexes, online resources, and guides. I then prepare a specific mission list of what I want to find and in what collections I hope to find it in. If writing, I make up a very specific request pointing to exact citations. If visiting, I make up a detailed hit list of what I want, where it should be, and how I found out about it. I have yet to find a librarian or archivist who is not impressed by my level of preparation and who has not helped me willingly. In my opinion, an unprepared general request for information is a disservice to yourself and to the staff at these often overwhelmed institutions.\n\nArchives nationales de France. Guide du lecteur. 6th ed. Paris: Archives nationales, 1993.\n\nThis is the basic how-to-use-the-archives manual. You should read this over before you write or visit the Archives nationales. It is updated frequently.\n\nBernard, Gildas. Guide des recherches sur l'histoire des familles. Paris: Archives nationales, 1981.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best published guide to French genealogy. He discusses in detail what is available in both the Archives nationales and the Bibliothèque nationale de France. See in particular pp. 193-217 and 226-227 coving nobles, orders of knighthood, and heraldry.\n\nBibliothèque nationale de France. Guide pratique de la Bibliothèque nationale. 2nd ed. Paris: Bibliothèque nationale, 1989.\n\nLike the guide for the Archives nationales, this is essential reading before visiting or writing to the library. It too is updated frequently.\n\nI have listed in this section as many Bibliothèque nationale de France catalogues as I can find that I have used in the past. Others may exist. Working with them you will soon observe that there are several series of manuscript numbers referring to difference collections that were donated or collected at distinct times. The French Manuscript Collection (often abbreviated as fr. ms.) is a closed series. Nothing new has been added to it since 1862 when the French Manuscripts New Acquisition Collection (often abbreviated as n. acq. ms.) was opened and where the new contributions have been placed. With a manuscript number and a series name, for example, Anciens petits fonds français, you should be able to refer to the correct catalog and look up a short description of the manuscript of interest. These documents can only be found at the Bibliothèque nationale de France and to my knowledge they have not been microfilmed by the Family History Library.\n\nKeep in mind that the Bibliothèque nationale de France is not organized like any American or Canadian library you are familiar with. Its collection has grown over centuries not decades. Works dealing with genealogy were not all donated at the same time. This is why you have to look though all the catalogues listed here. Each of these catalogs also contains an index.\n\n__________, Département des Manuscrits. Catalogue des manuscrits de la collection Baluze. Compiled by Lucien Auvray and René Poupardin. Paris: E.

Compiled by Philippe Lauer. 3 vols. Paris: E. Leroux, 1923-1932, 24 cm.\n\nPierre de Clairambault (1651-1740) was a Genealogist of the King's Orders. Unlike his compatriot Bernard Chérinwhose papers were deposited in the Cabinet des titresClairambault's papers were not donated until after the French Revolution and were kept separate. Unfortunately, many of his papers were burnt by the revolutionaries. You might also want to check for seals in the Clairambault collection (Demay 1885-1886).\n\n__________.

Small sized manuscripts are numbered below 20000 and large sized ones above 20001. I have learned that the Bibliothèque nationale de France has continued to add manuscripts to this collection and they are up to at least 16427 and 25245 respectively. There are apparently published continuation summary inventories covering these additions.\n\n__________, Département des Manuscrits. Les Catalogues du Département des Imprimés.

Only the following provinces are covered: Anjou, Artois, Bourgogne, Champagne, Flandre, Languedoc, Lorraine, Maine, Périgord, Picardie, Touraine, and Vexin. If your ancestor originates from one of these provinces, then I suggest you check this index.\n\nBluche, François. Les honneurs de la cour. 2 vols. in 1. Paris: Les cahiers nobles, 1957.\n\nTo be granted the honneurs de la court a person had to demonstrate an unbroken noble lineage extending back to 1400. This honor meant that you would be presented to the king. It was more than just attending the court at Versailles. It was an honor reserved for only members of the most ancient nobility of the sword unless the king made a special exception. The genealogist of the king's orders would verify any candidates lineage.\n\n__________. Les Pages de la Grande-Écurie. 3 vols. in 4. Paris, 1966.\n\nIn order to take advantage of social perks, the nobles had to prove their nobility to the King's genealogists. These are the proofs people submitted to place their sons as pages in the King's Great Stable. Similar documentation had to be submitted for other various royal sponsored institutions and schools.\n\nChauleur, Andrée. Bibliothèque et archives: comment se documente?

Each set of documents is briefly described with the period of coverage indicated. I use this resource to identify documents I might want to order and look through when visiting Paris.

Saffroy (1968-1988) does point to this collection under the abbreviation CGMBPF. However, he is not complete in his coverage. I believe that this is still an ongoing publication project and their might be more volumes published since 1989. For an index see Popoff (1993).\n\nNewman, Lindsay Mary.

I have to add some French journals. I am aware of GE-Magazine and La Revue française de généalogie. However, I have never really looked through them closely. This is an oversight I must remedy. Meanwhile, I thought I should include what I had and add to this section later.\n\nGeneaGuide.com\n\nWeb: GeneaGuide.com\n\nThis is a key website for anyone doing French genealogy.

There is a CD available from GeneaGuide.com, compiled by Philippe Houël de Chaulieu, which indexes these journals from 1956 to 2000. It too is a GeneaGuide.com partner.\n\nI want to thank Peter de Loriol Chandieu for sending me a comprehensive list of French genealogy journals that he found in Héraldique et généalogie, no. 153 (October-December 1999): 305-317.

It is an interesting hodgepodge of facts and illustrations regarding the French nobility and heraldry.\n\nWarning: All of the above works are helpful tools. However, it is absolutely essential that you track down original documents to back up any research you do. All of these works contain errors of transcription or omission. The grades I assigned to these works are subjective.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any works I have missed that you think should be added. Also please contact me should you notice any mistakes in spelling or grammar. At 45 I have not yet mastered some of the basic mechanics of writing in my native tongue. I make even more mistakes in French since I do not have a French web spell checker yet.\n\nThank you for visiting this page and I hope you find it helpful."
