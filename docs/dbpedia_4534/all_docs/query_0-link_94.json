Jumps are a relatively simple way to add excitement and visual interest to your cheers, routines, and general spiriting. Though it may take some cheerleaders a little bit of time to get the hang of proper jump technique (and to build up their strength and flexibility), the good news is that once you get it, it becomes second nature quickly!\n\nIn this post, we will focus on learning the most common cheerleading jumps, breaking down the proper placement for arms and legs. I did intentionally leave out a couple jumps that are usually included in these lists, such as the double nine and double hook. I’m not sure these have been widely used since at least the late 90s or very early 2000s. As cheerleading continues to evolve some skills and techniques may evolve or fade out, and that’s ok. I would wager that the herkie is next on the endangered skills list, but I have left it for now because I feel it is important to help understand the difference between a herkie and a side hurdler.\n\nAnyway, let’s dive in!\n\nNow that you know the different cheerleading jumps, let’s learn how to actually do one. Check out these posts for a how-to guide, as well as tips and trick to improve your jumps (links coming soon!):\n\nHow to do a Cheerleading Jump\n\n10 Common Cheer Jump Mistakes\n\nLet me know in the comments what your favorite jump is!"
