        "text": "Like all sports, cheerleading has it’s own language. Teddy bear. Buckets. Scale. Helicopter. These are common words that probably bring to mind pictures of every day items; however, they have a very different meaning in the cheer world.\n\nWhen you are first starting out, it can be a little overwhelming to learn all of the different terms for each cheerleading skill. It can also be a little intimidating – no one wants to say the wrong thing. To help give you a head start on learning the cheer lingo, I created this (almost) complete cheer dictionary that you can save and reference whenever you need it.\n\nThis list is by no means exhaustive (though I sure tried to catch them all!), and some terms vary from team to team (for example: daggers vs. tabletop or prep vs. elevator). Cheerleading also continues to evolve, so terms can change, get added, or become obsolete over time – when was the last time you actually heard anyone say “herkie”?!\n\nI will continue to update this post with links to additional resources, pictures, and videos for as many terms as possible. However, I know sometimes you won’t have the time to dig for the pin or have internet connection to pull this page up. To help with this, I have also turned the cheer dictionary into a PDF that you can save to your phone or print and keep in your cheer binder for easy reference! Use the form below to download the Cheer Dictionary PDF:\n\nLet's learn some cheer vocab!\n\nAerial – tumbling skill performed without hands; often a side aerial (no-handed cartwheel)\n\nArabesque – body position for stunting where the flyer stands on one leg with the other leg extended straight behind, arms in a T; the entire stunt group should face the side\n\nArabian – a flip that takes off backwards, does a half turn, and lands facing the front\n\nAround the world – advanced cheerleading jump in which the legs come up in a pike, then open to a toe touch before landing\n\nAwesome – extension with flyer’s feet close together\n\nBackbend – position in which the feet and hands maintain contact with the floor while the back arches and stomach pushes up toward the ceiling (see also: bridge)\n\nBack Handspring – tumbling skill that involves jumping backwards and passing through a handstand position before landing back on the feet\n\nBack Tuck – back flip with legs in a tucked position\n\nBackspot/back base – Stunt position in the back of the stunt group responsible for maintaining contact with the flyers ankles and calling the counts for the stunt\n\nBaja – stunt in which the flyer does a front flip while maintaining contact with a brace on the floor.

This is used after extending into the single leg stunt before pulling the body position, though is not a requirement.\n\nPost up – way to get into a stunt where the flyer holds the hands or shoulders of someone on the floor in front of the stunt.

This can be performed as a tumbling skill or basket toss\n\nShew – that was a lot! Like I said before, some teams will have different terms for certain skills or motions, but for the most part, this is the main vocab you will need to feel confident talking about cheerleading. If you found this helpful, please share with the other cheerleaders and coaches you know!"
