STEREOPHONIC IS NOT TO BE MISSED.\n\nDON’T WAIT. TICKETS WILL BE HARD TO GET.”\n\n“ THEATRICAL SOLID GOLD. ALL THE\n\nTINY DETAILS,\n\nWILD RHYTHMS, AND\n\nCLEVER HOOKS ADD UP\n\nTO A BRAVE,\n\nBREATHTAKING WORK.THE RESULT:\n\nA CLASSIC.”\n\n“AN EXCEPTIONAL\n\nPIECE OF WORK AND ONE OF THE MOST EXHILARATING MOMENTS\n\nI’VE EXPERIENCED IN A THEATER IN RECENT MEMORY.”\n\nStereophonic mines the agony and the ecstasy of creation as it zooms in on a music studio in 1976. Here, an up-and-coming rock band recording a new album finds itself suddenly on the cusp of superstardom. The ensuing pressures could spark their breakup â or their breakthrough. Written by David Adjmi, directed by Daniel Aukin, and featuring original music by Arcade Fire’s Will Butler, Stereophonic invites the audience to immerse themselves â with fly-on-the-wall intimacy â in the powder keg process of a band on the brink of blowing up."
