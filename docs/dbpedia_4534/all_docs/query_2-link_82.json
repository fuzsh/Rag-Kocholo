You will receive an email confirming this cancellation.\n\nYou may now select a new arrival time.\n\nArrive at your check-in location during your selected Move-In arrival time. Use the Move-In maps to find the correct place.\n\nIf you are traveling in a separate vehicle from your parent/guest, follow the \"student\" route to your check-in location. Your parent/guest should drive directly to your community's unloading zone by following the \"parent\" route.\n\nIf you are traveling in one vehicle, follow the \"student\" route to your check-in location before going to your community's unloading zone.\n\nFirst-Year students should be ready to present their Mobile Talon Card on your device during Check-In.\n\nUpper Class students should be sure to have an ID document (current US driverâ€™s license, current passport, current US government ID) or their physical Talon Card ready to present during Check-In.\n\nOnce you are checked in, follow the signs from your check-in location to your community's unloading zone.\n\nReview the How to Open Your Door flyer in your check-in packet and follow the Update Your Talon Card instructions BEFORE going to your unit. There are HotSpots located near the entrance to each residence hall.\n\nUnload your vehicle(s) as quickly as possible.\n\nMoving bins are provided, but we encourage you to bring wagons and dollies to make moving easier. Kindly limit your bin use to one hour.\n\nPlease move your vehicle as soon as you finish unloading to make room for other residents who are arriving.\n\nIf you need assistance, find a volunteer in a \"Nest Builder\" T-shirt or a staff member.\n\nIf you have questions throughout the day, stop by one of the Information Tents."
