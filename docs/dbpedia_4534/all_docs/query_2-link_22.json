        "text": "Who to Credit - DVD or Film\n\nMany people can be involved in the production of a film but not all need to be listed in the citation. Typically the director is the only name that is used. If the director is unknown, give credit to someone in a similar role (producer/writer/host etc.). Their job title (such as Director) is put after their name in round brackets to clarify what role they had in the film production.\n\nWho to Credit - Streaming Video from a Website\n\nFor videos from websites such as YouTube or Vimeo, credit the person who posted the content. If a real name is provided, use that followed by the person's user name in square brackets. If the real name of the person who posted the content is not known, just use their user name without brackets.\n\nWho to Credit - TV Series and TV Series Episode\n\nWhen citing a whole TV series, credit the executive producer(s). When citing a single episode from a TV series, credit the writer and the director of the episode. For both series and single episodes, include their job titles after their names in round brackets.\n\nDirector's Last Name, First Initial. Second Initial if Given. (Director). (Year of Publication). Title of Movie [Film]. Production Company.\n\nNote: Only specify how you watched a film (on DVD, streaming, etc.) when it is important to indicate a specific version. Put this information in in the square brackets following the word \"Film\" and a semicolon. If you have more than one director use (Directors) instead and separate their names with commas, adding an ampersand (&) before the final name. If the director is unknown, credit someone in a similar role (producer/writer) and put their job title in round brackets after their name.\n\nDirector's Last Name, First Initial. Second Initial if given. (Director). (Year DVD was produced). Title of DVD [Film; optional descriptive information if DVD is a unique version]. Production Company.\n\nNote: In general, you don't need to cite the format of a movie. However, include it if the information you are citing can be found only in that particular format or edition (e.g. special features or commentary).\n\nWriter's Last Name, First Initial. Second Initial if Given. (Writer), & Director's Last Name, First Initial. Second Initial if Given. (Director). (Year the episode was originally aired, Month Day if known). Title of episode (Season Number, Episode Number) [TV series episode]. In Executive Producer's First Initial. Last Name (Executive Producer), Television series name. Production Company.\n\nNote: Include the writer and director for the episode and put their job title in round brackets after their name. If one person did both jobs use (Writer & Director).\n\nCite the URL for the log-in page instead of the URL for the actual movie. Omit the URL if the TV episode was viewed on cable television rather than online."
