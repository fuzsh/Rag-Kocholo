The art and scenery in this entire film are beautiful. The writing is intriguing and worth putting your time in.\n\nThe premise of the movie is interesting, they switch bodies and we get to see the different lives of two completely different people who get to experience each other's worlds. The story is a well-written and structured movie that I've seen that can hit you emotionally, so without spoiling I won't say more.\n\nThe romance of the movie is done pretty well where ... you care about the two main characters getting together. The characters though, I feel like they could've done a bit better, but overall, they do enough service to make the movie enjoyable and make you hope that the characters end up together.\n\nOverall, it's hard to talk about how good this movie is without spoiling but this supernatural movie is one you should at least give a watch when you have the chance!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nExpectation: 9.5\n\nReality: 5\n\nAfter seeing many Makoto Shinkai works, this one didn't hit as hard. Character lacked depth and thr story felt bland. Of course animation was amazing, as you would expect, but the film was underwhelming at best.\n\nThe plot was pretty predictable and due to the nature of the phenomenom in the film, the romance was not as good as his other works. For the hype this had built up by the time I watched it, it really disappointed me to see the same-old plotline we've seen in every other one of his films. The ending was done well I must admit and combined ... with a good score, it pulled the right strings at the right time. However, this wasn't enough to carry the rest of the film.\n\nGarden of words has much better character writing and challenges Your Name for animation quality.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThis is just The Lake House but animated, and instead of a mailbox, they body-swap. If you can watch this without thinking it's a 1-1 facelift of The Lake House, congratulations, you're delusional. There are way too many similarities, practically all of them, to believe that Shinkai had not seen The Lake House before making this atrocity. They even have a train scene where he tries to meet her. Ironically, the only part I enjoyed- the body-swapping- is the only part that is different. Well, aside from the sudden amnesia subplot in the last half-hour, because Shinkai felt he needed further justification for the title, ... which he didn't, that puts the last nails of the plot into the coffin.\n\nYour Name also marks the first time Shinkai officially sold out to teen consumer culture by departing from his usual, good adult contemporary stories. It's one of the shallowest, easiest crowds you can sell out to, as seen by this awful, copy-pasted plot. I actually enjoyed 5 Cm for its realism in an industry bombastically oversaturated with wish fulfillment, and this takes an axe to that. Even his prior fantasy works could not be considered wish fulfillment. Children who Chase Lost Voices is currently my favorite of his works (I still need to see his old OVAs). It has some distinct themes about coping with death, but mostly it's just pure fun, something Your Name forgets to have because it was too busy checking off a marketing list for teens.\n\nSure, this movie looks great, but why watch a bad movie that looks good when Ghibli is a studio?\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for August\n\nHere are the North American anime & manga releases for August Week 1: August 4 - 10 Anime Releases Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka II (I...read more\n\nAug 2, 2020 10:29 PM by ImperfectBlue | Discuss (3 comments)\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for November\n\nHere are the North American anime & manga releases for November Week 1: November 7 - 13 Anime Releases Cheer Danshi!!
