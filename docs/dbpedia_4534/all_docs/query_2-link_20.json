        "text": "Since Your Name was released in Japanese theaters over last Summer, the film has gone on to be one of the most successful anime movies of all time. It’s with good reason though, as it is a thoroughly wonderful film.\n\nThe story of Your Name is based around two main characters, Mitsuha Miyamizu and Taki Tachibana. Mitsuha is frustrated with her life in the Hida countryside with all sorts of shrine related responsibilities and wants to live in Tokyo.\n\nThis desire is then seemingly manifested in a dreamlike way, where the following day Mitsuha can’t recollect the fact she was acting all weird and more than a bit tomboyish.\n\nIt seems that while dreaming Mitsuha swapped places with Taki, a boy in Tokyo, and it’s here their lives overlap. Leaving messages to one another about how best to manage the situation, each party tries to give advice on how to proceed.\n\nHowever, the result is something that ends up being mutually beneficial, as Mitsuha helps Taki with his love life and Taki makes Mitsuha more assertive with her classmates and the residents of her town.\n\nIt's the town that then becomes a very important focus in the relationship between Taki and Mitsuha, as well as the love they feel for one another.\n\nThe premise for the story was openly inspired by the 12th century Japanese story, Torikaebaya Monogatari where two siblings display the mannerisms of the opposite sex and it’s really clear when you watch the film that this is where the body-swapping premise came from.\n\nHowever, for me at least, a better narrative comparison would be the Griffin and Sabine books by Nick Bantock, where two people have their lives crossed without warning and in almost a voyeuristic way.\n\nIn a tone and visual sense I also felt that Your Name reminded me a great deal of the excellent anime series Xam'd: Lost Memories, as that too had a very naturalistic tone in terms of the characters and story.\n\nA lot has been spoken about this film and with good reason, Makoto Shinkai has been making anime for over two decades and he has a particularly sumptuous visual style.\n\nThe vistas of both Tokyo and Hida are stunning and the resultant animation is overall very impressive indeed. There’s also a great deal of warmth with the characters, especially in the Hida segment, and it really grounds the film as being an honest slice of life story.\n\nWhile being a Tokyo resident, I do find the depiction of the city somewhat overly flattering, as it’s nowhere near that clean, but the way in which the countryside is shown is incredibly well done and really quite accurate.\n\nFrom the raindrops hanging off the web of a joro spider to the simple act of weaving threads, this film really is a visual tour de force in a strangely understated and very particular way.\n\nAdmittedly, I am familiar with Shinkai’s prior animated output but this is something else entirely. The obviously increased budget compared to his earlier works means he’s been able to bring a very human and understated story to a far larger audience and it has clearly resonated.\n\nThere are some fascinating and clever narrative reveals along the way, such as to do with the past of Mitsuha’s town and the imminent passing of comet with a 1200-year orbit but I really don’t want to spoil how that resolves.\n\nOne additional point that’s worth making is that the score, by RADWIMPS, fits very well indeed. The instrumental cues and insert songs are pitched perfectly for this film and I only hope that their English localization doesn’t diminish their impact.\n\nI still think that this movie wasn’t nominated for an Academy Award is a great injustice, but I do in part understand why. This is not to say I agree with its omission but from a cultural standpoint, Your Name is very much set in Japanese society in a way that is likely beyond the parochial vantage point of those in Hollywood.\n\nIt’s entirely their loss though; this is a genuinely brilliant, often funny and very sweet movie. With a fantastic third act and an uncommonly uplifting finale. It is also easily one of the best animated films of the last decade and I mean that in a global sense, as Disney’s output has nothing on this.\n\nIn conclusion, Your Name is an incredibly good movie and one that tells a warm understated story with very likable characters, it also happens to be visually stunning throughout. Like many, I am now greatly looking forward to whatever Shinkai can come up with next.\n\nDisclosure: This review is of the Japanese version of the movie. I saw it in Japanese theaters a few times over the past few months but I was also sent a subtitled version by Funimation for the purposes of this review.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. I also manage Mecha Damashii and do toy reviews over at hobbylink.tv."
