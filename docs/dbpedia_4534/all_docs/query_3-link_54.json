        "text": "The scanners and metadata agents used by Plex will work best when your major types of content are separated from each other. We strongly recommend separating movie and television content into separate main directories. For instance, you might use something like this:\n\n/Media /Movies movie content /Music music content /TV Shows television content\n\nWarning!: Plex will do its best to appropriately find and match content. However, a failure to separate content such as movies and TV shows may result in unexpected or incorrect behavior.\n\nIn the above example, it is the main folder of each type of content (e.g. /Movies, /Music, /TV Shows) that you would specify as the content location for that library type.\n\nYou might have your own image files for movie posters & backgrounds, subtitles, your own movie “extras”, etc. To use these, ensure they are named and organized, and that the Local Media Assets source is enabled and ordered correctly.\n\nRelated Page:\n\nNote: We use .ext as a generic file extension in the naming/organizing instructions. You should use appropriate file extension for your files, of course. (Some operating systems such as Windows may hide your file extensions by default.)\n\nMovies in Their Own Folders\n\nMovie files can be placed into individual folders and this is the recommended method, as it can (sometimes significantly) increase the speed of scanning in new media. This method is also useful in cases where you have external media for a movie (e.g. custom poster, external subtitle files, etc.). Name the folder the same as the movie file:\n\n/Movies/MovieName (release year)/MovieName (release year).ext\n\n/Movies /Avatar (2009) Avatar (2009).mkv /Batman Begins (2005) Batman Begins (2005).mp4 Batman Begins (2005).en.srt poster.jpg\n\nSo long as you’re using the current “Plex Movie” metadata agent for the library, you can also include the IMDb or TheMovieDB ID number in curly braces to help match the movie. It must follow the form {[source]-[id]}.\n\n/Movies /Batman Begins (2005) {imdb-tt0372784} Batman Begins (2005) {imdb-tt0372784}.mp4\n\n/Movies /Batman Begins (2005) {tmdb-272} Batman Begins (2005) {tmdb-272}.mp4\n\nRelated Page: Using Subtitles\n\nRelated Page:\n\nStand-Alone Movie Files\n\nIf you wish, you can also put movie files next to each other in a main folder. While this is supported, we do still recommend having the movies in individual folders as outlined above.\n\nThe structure isn’t particularly important unless you have local media assets like posters or subtitles for a particular movie (in which you should have the movie and assets together in an individual folder, as outlined above). To correctly name a movie file, name it as follows:\n\nMovieName (release year).ext\n\n/Movies Avatar (2009).mkv Batman Begins (2005).mp4\n\nMultiple Editions\n\nTip!: The ability to specify different editions for a movie requires a Plex Pass subscription for Plex Media Server admin account.\n\nIn cases where you have a specific movie edition (Theatrical release, Director’s Cut, Extended Edition, Unrated, etc.) or even multiple editions, you can specify that edition information by appropriately naming the file and/or folder. This is only available when using the (non-“legacy”) Plex Movie agent available in Plex Media Server v1.28.1 and newer\n\nTo do so, you add the edition information inside curly braces to help distinguish the movie. It must follow the form {edition-[Edition Name]}. You can specify whatever normal text you want for the edition name (with a max limit of 32 characters).\n\nIn cases where you group your movie files together (not within individual folders for each movie), you’ll need to make sure that the files are named appropriately.\n\n/Movies Avatar (2009).mkv Blade Runner (1982).mp4 Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Director's Cut}.mp4 Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Final Cut}.mkv Top Gun (1986).mkv\n\nIf you are following our recommendation to use individual folders per movie, you can add the edition name to either the folder or filename or both. For consistency, we recommend including the edition information in both the folder name and the filename. This can also be used along with the {[source]-[id]} tag mentioned previously. The order of the tags is not important.\n\n/Movies /Blade Runner (1982) Blade Runner (1982).mp4 /Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Director's Cut} Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Director's Cut}.mp4 /Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Final Cut} Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Final Cut}.mkv\n\nNote: If you’re also providing your own and you have multiple editions for the movie, you’ll want to use individual folders for each edition and then place the local extras files in whichever edition you choose to be the “main” one. (Or you could also copy the extras and place them alongside each edition.)\n\nRelated Page:\n\nMovies Split Across Multiple Files\n\nMovies that are split into several files (e.g. pt1, pt2), can be played back as a single item (in most, but not all, players) if named correctly. The split parts must be placed inside their own folder, named as usual for the movie. Name the files as follows:\n\n/Movies/MovieName (release year)/MovieName (release year) – Split_Name.ext\n\nWhere Split_Name is one of the following:\n\ncdX\n\ndiscX\n\ndiskX\n\ndvdX\n\npartX\n\nptX\n\n…and you replace X with the appropriate number (cd1, cd2, etc.).\n\n/Movies /The Dark Knight (2008) The Dark Knight (2008) - pt1.mp4 The Dark Knight (2008) - pt2.mp4\n\nHowever, to get a better overall experience, we encourage you to instead use a tool to join/merge the individual files into a single video. There are multiple ways you can do this and a quick search in your favorite search engine should give you some options on how to “join” files. An unofficial guide with one free tool has even been posted in our forums."
