After all, there are so many different factors that you should take into account.\n\nYou don’t want something so obscure that no one understands what it means, but at the same time, you don’t like something so generic that it doesn’t stand out from the crowd.\n\nThese are the top tips to consider when creating a great movie name:\n\nKeep it short and easy\n\nMovies like Jaws, Goodfellas, and Jumanji were popular even before they hit theaters. These films are instant classics, not only because of the quality of their productions but also because of their memorable and easy-to-spell names.\n\nIf you reduce the name of your movie to one word, people will feel intrigued to know more about the story behind the title. A short name is an excellent hook to catch viewers’ attention.\n\nCreate a marketable name\n\nA good brand is an essential part of a successful movie. Film titles are crucial to that branding and significantly affect how people perceive your movie.\n\nYour movie name can be a marketing tool that gets people talking about it for weeks. It can go viral on social media and online review sites. It may even encourage viewers to sign up for your mailing list or buy tickets to your premiere.\n\nIf you want to make it big, design a name that’s:\n\nUnique: e.g., Descendant of Fortune or Duke of Hope.\n\nSimple: e.g., Dog or Tech.\n\nTimeless: e.g., Amused by Dreams or Key of Darkness.\n\nEasy to pronounce: e.g., Body of the Sea or Hope of Time.\n\nWeb-friendly: e.g., Dogs of Sorrow or Boys and Foes. A web-friendly movie name must be easy to remember and type.\n\nSEO-friendly: e.g., The Horror Diaries or Land of Fantasy. An SEO-friendly movie name must have keywords related to the movie genre or other key aspects of the film. This will make it effective as an SEO domain.\n\nSee how big companies like Warner Bros or Walt Disney Pictures promote new releases: the movie’s name is always at the center of the marketing campaign.\n\nConsider the movie genre, characters, and location\n\nOne of the most important things to consider when planning out a movie name is what kind of story you want to tell.\n\nBefore deciding on a final name for your project, ask yourself these questions:\n\nWhat type of movie genre is the one you want to write?\n\nIs it science fiction, comedy, horror, romance, or drama?\n\nWhat about the characters: good guys, bad guys, or even a mix?\n\nDo you want your story to take place on Earth or in space?\n\nAre you interested in describing a specific location?\n\nA descriptive movie title tells people what to expect and anticipates the plot without spoilers. If you create your movie name based on its genre or location, you’ll be closer to building a solid audience and fanbase around your product.\n\nFind inspiration in real-world movies and productions\n\nReal-world movies are a great source of inspiration. They capture the experience of living in a particular place and time and can help you to imagine your film’s setting and movie title.\n\nThere are many ways to get inspired by real-world movies: by looking for visual cues, noticing how certain films use particular locations or objects, or studying how characters behave toward each other.\n\nSee Spotlight.\n\nThis 2015 film follows the story of a group of journalists who undercover a conspiracy around church child abuse. The plot is based on a true story, and the movie’s name comes from the investigative journalist unit: ‘Spotlight.’\n\nThe movie’s title fits the script, the narrative, and the images viewers see on the big screen.
