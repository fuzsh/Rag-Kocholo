This is a nice site, a place for civil discourse and dick jokes. If you want to stay at a fun joint with liveblogs during football games and a great community, we’re ecstatic to have you. Unfortunately, if you leave offensive material in the comments, we’ll have to send you home. Commenting here is a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe former name of the Washington Commanders is a grating slur that pisses us off every time we see it. So now, even after the name change, they are the Washington [*Redacteds] in the comments."
