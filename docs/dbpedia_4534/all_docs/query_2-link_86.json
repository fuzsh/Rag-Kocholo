        "text": "Find inspiration from the movie characters you love for unique baby names that aren’t overused.\n\nUnique Baby Names From Movie Characters You Love\n\nChoosing a baby name is no easy feat. How do you pick just one name from thousands for a little person you don’t know yet? Luckily, there’s inspiration all around us. When you start your baby name search, you’ll probably find yourself considering every name you come across: in magazines, books and on screen.\n\nYour favorite movie is a great place to start, but you want your baby name to have an edge, right? So, don’t go for the obvious choice. While several main characters from movies have unique names, you can also look to the supporting cast for ones that aren’t overused.\n\nGinny (\"Harry Potter”)\n\nIf you don’t want a Harry or a Hermione, how about the character who arguably goes through the biggest personal transformation throughout the “Harry Potter” series? Ginny Weasley (played by Bonnie Wright) goes from a little girl who is desperate to go to Hogwarts to a world-class wizard and one of the fiercest Quidditch heroes the school has ever seen. (She also ends up marrying Harry Potter himself, but she’s so much more than that.)\n\nThe name Ginny, which is an English diminutive of Virginia meaning “virginal,” fell out of the U.S. Social Security Administration's (SSA) Top 1,000 baby girl names list in 1983 — but it deserves a comeback.\n\nJasper (“Twilight”)\n\nForget Edward and Jacob. If you want to give your baby boy a “Twilight”-inspired name that’s far less predictable, go for the complex, charismatic Jasper (played by Jackson Rathbone). This Persian name also has an awesome meaning: “bringer of treasure.”\n\nIt’s a popular choice, ranking at No. 154 on the SSA list in 2018 — its recent rise up the baby boy name charts partly due to \"Twilight's\" phenomenal success. One of the few “gem” names for boys, Jasper is the perfect nod to your love for vampiric sagas, without being too obvious.\n\nGray (“Jurassic World”)\n\nArguably the best “color name” out there, Gray is also a diminutive of the English, Grayson, which means “the son of the bailiff.” It’s more well-known as a surname, which makes it an unusual baby name choice while still maintaining a traditional vibe.\n\nIt’s also the perfect choice for a little one (boy or girl, as it has definite unisex potential) who might just grow up to be obsessed with dinosaurs. After all, Gray is the courageous, intelligent, excitable young boy in “Jurassic World,” played by Ty Simpkins.\n\nKit (“Pretty Woman”)\n\nA traditional unisex name that still has the cool factor is Kit, a.k.a. Julia Roberts’ BFF in the 1990 blockbuster “Pretty Woman.” Aside from the leopard print–loving sidekick played by Laura San Giacomo, other memorable movie Kits include Kit Fisto, the Jedi Knight in the “Star Wars” series; Kit Snicket in the “A Series of Unfortunate Events” novels; and Kit Keller, the kid sister in “A League of Their Own.”\n\nThe baby girl name Kit, meaning “pure,” is traditionally a diminutive of Katherine, but it’s weighty enough to stand alone today.\n\nAugust (“Mission: Impossible – Fallout”)\n\nMeaning “great, magnificent,” August is the perfect name choice for the “Mission: Impossible” villain (played by Henry Cavill) who thinks he can get the better of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt. This Latin name is steeped in history — Augustus was the first emperor of the Roman Empire — and also has many artistic and literary associations, such as the famed sculptor Auguste Rodin and Swedish playwright August Strindberg.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, August has steadily risen in popularity in the U.S., and in 2018, it ranked No. 170 on the baby boy name chart.\n\nVesper (“Casino Royale”)\n\nSometimes, a movie can turn a regular word into a bonafide name, and Vesper is one of them. Originally a Latin word used for evening spiritual services, its strongest association today is with Eva Greene’s character in the 2006 James Bond film “Casino Royale.” (Of course, the “Vesper Martini” is the famous drink ordered by James Bond in both the book and the movie.)\n\nA musical name with a beautiful meaning (“evening star”), Vesper is one of those pop culture names that’s only going to get more popular, making this a good time to claim it for your kid.\n\nLaurie (“Little Women”)\n\nLouisa May Alcott’s classic “Little Women” was all about the March girls, but their story wouldn’t be the same without the moody yet lovable Laurie, played by Christian Bale in the acclaimed 1994 film adaptation and then by Timothée Chalamet in the most recent adaptation.\n\nLaurie’s full name is Theodore Laurence, so this character offers multiple name options, including the sweet, modern Theo and, of course, Laurence.\n\nPrimrose (“The Hunger Games”)\n\nIf Katniss is too left field, a more conservative tribute to your “Hunger Games” obsession is Primrose, the name of the younger sister of Jennifer Lawrence’s protagonist. Primrose “Prim” Everdeen, played by Willow Shields in the hit movie franchise, is a gentle, healing character, reflected in her sweet, somewhat quaint name.\n\nThe meaning of Primrose, which was first used as a Scottish surname, is “first rose.” The fact that it’s not as popular as its fellow flower names, Rose and Violet, makes it an attractive choice for parents who want their little bud to stand out.\n\nZuri (“Black Panther”)\n\nThere’s no end of baby name inspirations in the Marvel movies, and superhero baby boy names don’t get much more exotic than Zuri. This African/Kiswahili name means “good, beautiful.”\n\nIt was the perfect choice for the “Black Panther” shaman, warrior and trusted advisor to the king (played by Forest Whitaker), who is one of T'Chaka’s most loyal companions. Strong and special, Zuri works equally well for a baby girl.\n\nLeia (“Star Wars”)\n\nIt’s no surprise that Leia shot up the baby name chart after “Star Wars” first hit screens in 1977, but four decades later, it’s still a popular choice, as is the alternative spelling Leya. A name of Hindi origin meaning “the law; lion,” Leia has stature written all over it thanks to Carrie Fisher’s unforgettable portrayal of one of the Rebel Alliance’s greatest leaders.\n\nA popular name in Spain and Sweden as well as the U.S., where it ranked No. 296 in 2018, Leia could be the perfect choice, whether you see the character as a princess or a general.\n\nAlfred (“Batman”)\n\nIf you want a baby boy name that evokes character and wisdom but also lends itself nicely to hipper nicknames, look no further than Alfred. An English name meaning “wise counselor,” Alfred could be Alf, Alfie, Fred or Freddie.\n\nThe name is memorable in “Batman,” given to the superhero’s butler, Alfred Thaddeus Crane Pennyworth, as well as “I, Robot” (Alfred Lanning) and “The Hobbit” series (Alfred Lickspittle).\n\nCecilia (“Atonement”)\n\nWhile Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) is the main character of “Atonement,” Keira Knightley’s character Cecilia — Briony’s sister — could be considered the second heroine. She’s free-spirited, passionate and relatable — who hasn’t moped around a little after college wondering what to do with their life?\n\nThe Latin name Cecilia, the female form of Cecil, has enjoyed many a pop culture reference. It appears in Charles Dickens’ “Hard Time,” the novel/movie “The Virgin Suicides” and the film series “The Hunger Games.” Simon & Garfunkel even wrote a song about a Cecilia.\n\nCecile (“Cruel Intentions”)\n\nIf you’re into the name Cecilia but would like a more unisex sound, don’t forget Cecile. While she didn’t get as much screen time as Sebastian Valmont, Kathryn Merteuil or Annette Hargrove, Cecile Caldwell (played by Selma Blair) is a memorable character in the cult classic “Cruel Intentions.”\n\nCecile, a French name meaning “blind,” can also be found throughout classic French literature — “Les Liaisons Dangereuses,” “Cousin Pons” and “Germinal,” to name but a few — and can be tweaked yet again if Cecily is your preference.\n\nKip (“Napoleon Dynamite”)\n\nIt’s the U.S. diminutive of Christopher, but Kip is a great name in its own right (Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne, long-time colleague of Stephen Hawking, is one of many Kips who don't have a longer name).\n\nIt’s also the name of Derek Aaron Ruell’s character in the hit movie “Napoleon Dynamite.” As Napoleon’s older brother, Kip may not be the coolest character, but there’s something endearing about his efforts to be “manly,” and he has the perfect short-but-sweet name.\n\nConnie (“The Godfather”)\n\nConstanzia Corleone (played by Talia Shire) is Don Corleone's youngest child in “The Godfather” film series, but her nickname Connie is cuter. A diminutive of the English name Constance, it means “steadfastness” — something you’ll need in spades if you’re part of one of New York’s most notorious organized crime families.\n\nDespite falling steadily down the baby name chart since 1955, when it reached its all-time peak of No. 35, Connie is a popular name in pop culture. “The Godfather” aside, the movies “Camp Rock,” “Cowboy Up,” “Eternal” and “The Good Son” have characters named Connie.\n\nBo (“Dumplin’”)\n\nThe hunky heartthrob from “Dumplin’” aside, Bo is a name with serious swagger. Originally a Norse nickname meaning “to live,” it’s been inching its way up the U.S. baby boy name chart since the early 2000s.\n\nIf a two-letter name is simply too short for you, consider Beau as an alternative. This French name, meaning “handsome,” is a more popular choice, not least among celebrity parents. Art Garfunkel, Wendy Wilson, Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Tori Spelling all have sons named Beau.\n\nSloane (“Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”)\n\nWho could forget Sloane Peterson from “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off?” The ultimate sidekick to the fun-loving Ferris Bueller, Sloane (played by Mia Sara) has an equal amount of fun skipping school, pranking the high school faculty and reminding everyone how complex those coming-of-age years can really be.\n\nThis name of Irish origin means “raider” — perfect for a strong baby girl.\n\nAlistair (“Twilight”)\n\nAnother character from the “Twilight” series — because how can you really have too many? — Alistair was a nomadic vampire who had a tracking ability that allowed him to track animate beings from great distances.\n\nThis Scottish name means “defending men” and has quite a sophisticated sound to it.\n\nElle (“Legally Blonde” and “Kill Bill”)\n\nYes, Elle from “Legally Blonde” showed that pretty, popular people can be smart, too.\n\nBut perhaps more interesting was Elle Driver from both volumes of Quentin Tarantino's “Kill Bill.” Daryl Hannah plays the hired assassin who makes the case that eye patches are actually super cool.\n\nElsa (“Frozen)\n\nDon’t like the name “Elle”? Well, the name Elsa from “Frozen” is an obvious variation.\n\nJules (“Pulp Fiction”)\n\nJules Winnfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson, makes the movie “Pulp Fiction” what it is. A hired assassin, working alongside Vincent Vega, Jules is intriguing in that he’s super self aware and uncompromising on his morals.\n\nOf course, the name Jules is a rather unique boys’ name but could also be used for a girl, especially as a nickname for Julia or Juliana.\n\nMaximus (“Gladiator”)\n\nThis is quite a mighty name for a young boy, but Russell Crowe wears it proudly in the movie “Gladiator.”\n\nThe abbreviated Max has been quite popular in recent years, moving in and out of the top 100 baby names list.\n\nDaisy (“The Great Gatsby”)\n\nDaisy Buchanan is the apple of Nick Carraway’s eye in the novel, “The Great Gatsby,” which was adapted as a movie (again) in 2013. (Carey Mulligan played Ms. Daisy.)\n\nOf course, there’s the older Daisy in “Driving Miss Daisy” and Julia Roberts’ character, Daisy, in “Mystic Pizza.” Needless to say, this name’s a classic that never goes out of style.\n\nNeo (“The Matrix”)\n\n“The Matrix” was a decade-defining movie when it came out in 1999. Neo, aka “The One,” is the main character that everyone’s rooting for in this alternate universe.\n\nOf course, “One” is also an anagram for Neo.\n\nMowgli (“The Jungle Book”)\n\nThis name is so unique that it’s not even in the SSA's top 1,000 baby names.\n\nIt’s a literary name from “The Jungle Book,” which has been turned into several films — the most recent of which was released in 2016. A young Neel Sethi played the ever-endearing Mowgli.\n\nJuno (“Juno”)\n\nEllen Page played a pregnant teen ever-so-coolly in the indie film, “Juno,” released in 2007.\n\nBut this name has quite a history, with a Latin origin meaning “queen of the heavens.” Juno was the patron goddess of Rome, and the protector of women and marriage.\n\nAce (“Ace Ventura: Pet Detective”)\n\nThis eccentric pet detective was one of the funniest characters of the ’90s — so much so that there were not one but two movies made about him.\n\nA Latin name meaning “one, unity,” this is a perfect name for a first-born child. While it’s grown in popularity, it still only ranked No. 255 on the 2018 SSA list.\n\nTristan (“Legends of the Fall”)\n\nA gender-neutral name, Tristan is actually more popular among boys, probably due to Brad Pitt’s dreamy character in “Legends of the Fall.”\n\nThis name has been falling in and out of the top 100 list for baby boys now for the past 20 years.\n\nLena (“The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants”)\n\nActress Alexis Bledel played Lena Kaligaris in “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” (and the sequel), which put this name on everyone’s radar in 2005 when the film was released.\n\nHowever, actresses Lena Dunham (of “Girls” fame) and Lena Headey (of “Game of Thrones”) are perhaps the reason this name keeps climbing the baby name charts in recent years to No. 301 as of 2018.\n\nFlint (“Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs”)\n\nFlint Lockwood won over audiences in 2009 when he built a machine that converts water into food — yes, even meatballs.\n\nWhile this name was more popular in the 1950s, it’s definitely making a comeback as a unique moniker for a baby boy.\n\nMolly (“Booksmart”)\n\nOlivia Wilde’s “Booksmart” stars Beanie Feldman as high school valedictorian Molly — and you can’t get a more classic name choice than that.\n\nThe diminutive of the Hebrew Mary, meaning “bitter,” it’s ranked in the U.S. Top 500 since records began.\n\nEdgar (“The Lost Boys”)\n\nThe late 1980s classic “The Lost Boys” was the first on-screen pairing of “The Two Coreys” (Feldman and Haim). In the movie, Feldman plays vampire Hunter Edgar Frog, who warns the Emerson brothers about an evil gang of vampires.\n\nAlas, the Old English name Edgar doesn’t mean “vampire hunter” — its official meaning is “wealthy spearman.” It’s held onto a Top 400 placement in the U.S. since records began.\n\nAlice (“Alice in Wonderland”)\n\nAlice, meaning “noble,” was a hugely popular baby name long before the Disney film “Alice in Wonderland” (based on Lewis Carroll’s children’s book) was released in 1951.\n\nIt’s actually a shortened, Germanic form of the French name Adelais and is a top choice for parents of inquisitive, imaginative girls around the globe, particularly in Sweden, Brazil, France, Portugal and Italy.\n\nLucian (“Underworld”)\n\nA Latin name meaning “light,” Lucian has been in the U.S. Top 1,000 since the 1940s.\n\nThe most famous bearer is probably Berlin-born British painter Lucian Freud (grandson of Sigmund), but in the movie world, Lucian is a werewolf in the “Underworld” franchise.\n\nAva (“Ex-Machina”)\n\nA variation of Eve, Ava has Hebrew, Latin and Germanic roots and has a number of meanings to choose from: “life; bird; water; island.”\n\nIt’s the name of a humanoid robot with artificial intelligence in “Ex-Machina,” played by Alicia Vikander. Of course, it’s also the name of one of the greats of Old Hollywood, Ava Gardner.\n\nJake (“Avatar”)\n\nThe Hebrew diminutive of Jacob, Jake means “supplanter.” In “Avatar,” the name belongs to the main character, a paraplegic renegade Marine veteran who defects to the Na'vi race.\n\nJake ranked 295th on the U.S. chart in 2019 and is a Top 100 name in England, Scotland, Ireland and Australia.\n\nAudrey (“Atlantis: The Lost Empire”)\n\nHepburn might be what comes to mind when you hear the name Audrey, but diminutive movie icons aside, it’s also the name of a character in Disney’s “Atlantis: The Lost Empire.”\n\nAn English name meaning “noble strength,” it ranked 49th on the U.S. baby name chart in 2019.\n\nEthan (“Mission Impossible”)\n\nMeaning “strong, firm,” Ethan is a biblical name (it comes from the Hebrew Eitan), but it’s best known — for movie fans, at least — as the lead character in the “Mission Impossible” franchise.\n\nTom Cruise plays the senior spy agent who’ll be back on the big screen for the seventh installment in 2022.\n\nYolanda (“Pulp Fiction”)\n\nShe only has a supporting role in Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction,” but small-time thief Yolanda (aka Honey Bunny) makes a big impact.\n\nYolanda is a name of Spanish and Greek origin meaning \"violet flower” and is an edgier choice than the English Violet.\n\nKnox (“Dead Poets Society”)\n\nJosh Charles played Knox Overstreet in the hit movie “Dead Poets Society,” ensuring he stood out among the Charlies, Neils and Richards of his privileged all-boys prep school.\n\nA Scottish name meaning “round hill,” Knox dates back to at least the 13th century as a surname, but it was made cool again by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie when their son Knox was born in 2008.\n\nAnita (“Almost Famous”)\n\nPlayed by Zooey Deschanel, Anita is the older sister of the endearing “Almost Famous” protagonist William Miller. It’s definitely a name with a rock ‘n’ roll vibe, thanks to Anitas Baker, Hall and Pointer.\n\nAnother movie connection is via the lead human character in Disney’s “101 Dalmatians.” Anita is a Spanish name meaning “grace; unguided.”\n\nFitzgerald (“The Revenant”)\n\nHe’s a bad boy in the Oscar-winning “The Revenant,” but John Fitzgerald might offer an unexpected baby name choice.\n\nFitzgerald means “son of Gerald,” and it also has literary and political connections thanks to F. Scott Fitzgerald (“The Great Gatsby”) and former U.S. President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. If it’s too much of a mouthful, Fitz has a whole other vibe.\n\nMargot (“The Royal Tenenbaums”)\n\nFormer precocious child turned literary genius, Margot is played by Gwyneth Paltrow in “The Royal Tenenbaums,” while Nicole Kidman bears the name in “Margot at the Wedding.”\n\nThe French diminutive of Margaret, Margot means “pearl” and has been climbing the U.S. baby name chart since 2013.\n\nForrest (“Forrest Gump”)\n\nNature name Forrest means “dweller near the woods,” and it’s also the eponymous character from one of Tom Hanks’ best-known — and most loved — films.\n\nIn 2013, Forrest enjoyed a revival, reentering the Top 1,000 as one of the fastest-rising names on the list.\n\nMisty (“She’s All That”)\n\nClea DuVall played the wonderfully gothic Misty in teen movie “She’s All That,” the 1999 take on the classic Cinderella story. An English name meaning “mist,” Misty has been declining in popularity since the 1980s, but maybe that means it’s due for a revival?\n\nIn real life, the most famous bearer is ballerina Misty Copeland.\n\nNaveen (“The Princess and the Frog”)\n\nWhen it comes to Disney princes, Naveen from “The Princess and the Frog” is up there with the best of them — he’s basically the whole package.\n\nActor Naveen Andrews, who played Sayid on the hit TV show “Lost,” has helped draw attention to this traditional Hindi name meaning “new.”\n\nFreda (“Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers”)\n\nThe daughter of Morwen and sister of Eothain in Rohan, “Lord of the Rings” character Freda is played by New Zealand actress Olivia Tenant.\n\nA German name meaning “peaceful,” it hasn’t ranked in the U.S. baby name chart for decades.\n\nBartleby (“Dogma”)\n\nBartleby, meaning “son of the furrow,” is an English surname. It’s also the name of Ben Affleck’s character (a fallen angel) in “Dogma” and a famous Herman Melville character.\n\nMelville’s short story “Bartleby the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street” has been adapted for the big screen three times.\n\nSidney (“Scream”)\n\nThe protagonist of the “Scream” movie franchise cemented Sidney as a gender-neutral choice. However, this French name (meaning “Saint Denis”) has a much longer history as a girls’ name.\n\nIt even made it into the Top 300 in recent years before it felt out of the chart in 2016.\n\nRonnie (“Sin City”)\n\nOne of the Irish mercenaries in “Sin City,” Ronnie is played by Jason McDonald. He comes to a brutal end when his head is sliced in half by one of Miho's throwing stars, but that aside, the name is a cute choice that ages well.\n\nAs a boys’ name, it’s short for Ronald, but it’s increased in popularity for little girls in recent years.\n\nNatalie (“Charlie’s Angels”)\n\nCameron Diaz plays Natalie Cook in “Charlie’s Angels” and “Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle.” But that’s not the only Natalie in the movie world — there’s also the late, great Natalie Wood, star of “West Side Story.”\n\nNatalie means “birthday of the Lord” and ranked 41st on the U.S. baby name chart in 2019.\n\nPatrick (“American Psycho”)\n\nMovie history offers lots of Patricks, but few are more memorable than Patrick Bateman, the madman from Christian Bale’s classic movie “American Psycho.”\n\nOf Latin origin, the name means “noble, patrician,” and although it’s slipped from the Top 30 position it enjoyed in the 1960s, it remains a popular choice both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nEmily (“The Devil Wears Prada”)\n\nThere are actually two Emilys in “The Devil Wears Prada” — Miranda Priestly’s long-suffering assistant Emily is played by English actress Emily Blunt. The feminine variation of Emil, it means “rival” and is one of the most popular “E” names for girls.\n\nThis classic, pretty name also harks back to literary greats Emily Bronte and Emily Dickinson.\n\nTennessee (“Alien: Covenant”)\n\nA popular place name (perhaps due to Reese Witherspoon choosing it for her son in 2012), Tennessee is also a character in “Alien: Covenant.”\n\nDanny McBride plays the eternally positive chief pilot of the Covenant ship. Like most place names, Tennessee works equally well for a girl.\n\nAstrid (“Crazy Rich Asians”)\n\nOne of the biggest movie hits of 2018, “Crazy Rich Asians” features a stellar cast, including Gemma Chan as Astrid Leong-Teo.\n\nA Scandinavian name meaning “divinely beautiful,” Astrid has managed to maintain a certain mystery while still rising up the U.S. chart — it reached an all-time high of 518th in 2019.\n\nSterling (“Cars 3”)\n\nA secondary antagonist of “Cars 3,” Sterling is a billionaire business car and owner of Rust-eze.\n\nIf you’re inclined to name your newborn after an animated vehicle, you could do worse than go for this English name, which means “of the highest quality.”\n\nLara (“To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”)\n\nA Russian name meaning “citadel,” Lara may be famous as the romantic heroine in “Dr. Zhivago” and Angelina Jolie’s tomb-raiding adventurer Croft, but a more modern pop culture reference is Lara Jean Covey in “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.”\n\nIt’s a Top 100 name in England, Ireland and The Netherlands and is a huge hit in Sweden, where it ranked No. 4 in 2019.\n\nSilas (“Despicable Me”)\n\nAn English name derived from Latin meaning “wood, forest,” Silas is a nature name without being obvious about it.\n\nIt’s also the name of the former director of the Anti-Villain League in “Despicable Me 2” and “Despicable Me 3.” It’s a popular choice in the U.S., ranking 107th in 2019.\n\nLauren (“This Means War”)\n\nReese Witherspoon plays Lauren in the 2012 comedy flick “This Means War,” but this baby name has an even stronger movie connection. Lauren Bacall (“The Big Sleep,” “To Have and Have Not”) was named the 20th greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema by the American Film Institute.\n\nLauren means “baby laurel,” and although it dropped out of the U.S. Top 25 in 2006, it remains a popular pick.\n\nAdonis (\"Creed\")\n\nThe exotic-sounding name Adonis was used in the movie \"Creed,\" one of the sequels in the Rocky film series.\n\nThe Greek name appropriately translates to \"lord.\" It's a strong, masculine-sounding name, and some opt to go by the nickname \"Don\" instead.\n\nDawson (\"Titanic\")\n\nWhether you recognize the name from \"Dawson's Creek\" or the steamy Jack Dawson in \"Titanic,\" Dawson's popularity in film and television allowed it to evolve from a surname to a given name.\n\nIt means \"son of David.\"\n\nNoah (\"The Notebook\")\n\nNoah isn't the most adventurous of names, but it does have romantic notes thanks to Hollywood.\n\nNoah is the name of the leading man in \"The Notebook,\" one of the greatest romantic movies of all time. In Hebrew, it means \"repose.\"\n\nRobin (\"Batman\")\n\nRobin, Batman's trusted sidekick, is also a fantastic baby name.\n\nWhile Robin is more of a loyal buddy than the star of the show, the name actually means \"bright and shining.\"\n\nAriel (\"The Little Mermaid\")\n\nAll '90s babies grew up singing \"Part of Your World.\" The diehard fans would re-enact the entire scene every time they went to the pool, so it's safe to say that the name Ariel deserves a spot on the list.\n\nIn Hebrew, it means \"lion of God.\"\n\nAna (\"Frozen\")\n\nWe included Elsa, so we just couldn't leave Ana behind. While the Frozen version of Ana is spelled \"Anna,\" the shorter spelling with just one N encourages people to pronounce it \"AH-nuh.\"\n\nThe name originated in France, and it means \"grace.\"\n\nMinerva (\"Harry Potter\")\n\nMinerva McGonagall is objectively a better professor than Dumbledore. She was tough but fair, and she didn't spend a decade prepping one of the students for inevitable death, so it's not even up for debate.\n\nThe fierce and beloved professor's name is a Latin word meaning \"intellect.\" That just goes to show that the defining features of each Harry Potter house are more like guidelines; Gryffindor's can be brave and brilliant.\n\nQuinn (\"Batman\")\n\nQuinn isn't a new name, but it was made popular by the Batman film series and the \"Suicide Squad\" spinoffs. Harley Quinn is a tragic character, but the name Quinn is anything but.\n\nThe traditional Irish name sounds sweet and innocent, but it translates to \"wise\" or \"counsel.\"\n\nDorothy (\"The Wizard of Oz\")\n\nFollow the yellow brick road! Portraying the lovable, young heroine of \"The Wizard of Oz\" turned out to be Judy Garland's breakout role. It's a sweet, vintage name that was very popular back in the day. It was also used as the name of a character in the television series \"Golden Girls.\"\n\nWhile the name Dorothy instantly reminds us of blue and white gingham and red, sparkly shoes, it's actually a Greek name meaning \"gift from God.\"\n\nClementine (\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\")\n\nClementine was the name of the bubbly, spontaneous protagonist of \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\" Played by Kate Winslet, Clementine Kruczynski's tale of completely erasing her ex from her mind is iconic.\n\nClementine, a French name with Latin roots, means \"merciful and mild.\"\n\nTrinity (\"The Matrix\")\n\nAnother name from the popular Matrix movie series, Trinity is a hacker and computer programmer who has escaped the Matrix after being aided by Morpheus.\n\nWhile the character is rebellious, the name Trinity has Christian roots. It symbolizes the holy trinity: the father, the son and the holy ghost.\n\nFletcher (\"Fletch\")\n\nIrwin M. \"Fletch\" Fletcher is the star of the movie \"Fletch.\" The Los Angeles Times reporter is offered buckets of money to help a millionaire end his life after supposedly receiving a terminal cancer diagnosis. It turns out that he wasn't even sick to begin with, but that's not the point.\n\nThe name Fletcher was formerly used only as a surname, but it has recently become a popular first name for boys as well. The Old French and Middle English name means \"arrow smith.\"\n\nRegina (\"Mean Girls\")\n\nRegina is literally the Latin word for \"queen.\" It was used as a name for girls in medieval times, sometimes referring to the Virgin Mary.\n\nIt was a fitting name for Regina George, the reigning popularity queen in \"Mean Girls,\" but Regina doesn't have to be a villainous name. Regina George was more of a dictator than a queen, but most Regina's are perfectly nice.\n\nRosemary (\"Rosemary's Baby\")\n\nIn the psychological horror film \"Rosemary's Baby,\" a young, pregnant woman in Manhattan grows suspicious of her neighbors. Based on a 1976 novel by Ira Levin, the movie follows her disturbing spiral into danger as she tries to protect her baby from the members of a supposed Satanic cult.\n\nThe name Rosemary must have been chosen for the character because of how sweet and gentle it sounds, a stark contrast from the evil undertones of the plot. Rosemary is a Latin word meaning \"dew of the sea,\" and it's also the name of a fragrant herb.\n\nLyla (\"August Rush\")\n\nThe movie \"August Rush\" was a favorite among music lovers, and the story is heartbreaking. Lyla, a talented young cellist, falls in love at first sight with a rough-around-the-edges guitarist. They end up having a baby together, but Lyla's father secretly gives the child up for adoption. When Lyla discovers the truth, she stops at nothing to find her lost child, August.\n\nShe's an incredible character, and the name Lyla is just as wonderful. It comes from an Arabic name meaning \"night.\""
