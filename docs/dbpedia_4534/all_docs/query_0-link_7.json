Despite the title's implications, \"Stand Up and Cheer\" wasn't all patriotic music; it was, however, mostly adult contemporary standards - and even show tunes - but no rock and roll. Among those who guest-starred on \"Stand Up and Cheer\" were Jim Backus (singing \"You Gotta Have Heart,\" Mr. Magoo-style, with the regulars), Bob Crane (who also played the drums), Milton Berle, Ken Berry (who sang with the regulars and did a tap number), and even Lassie (the regulars sang \"I Wish I Had a Puppy\" around her while she was on stage)! Each show ended with Mann saying, \"Always remember....,\" after which the chorus sang, \"Keep your eye on the grand old flag!\" as a giant American flag appeared behind them. A terrific variety show that could be enjoyed by the entire family.",
