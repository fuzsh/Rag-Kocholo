        "text": "Please give us the complete sentence, with some context, so we have a specific situation to discuss.\n\nThere are hundreds of sites where you can ask the name of a particular movie if you don't remember the name .\n\nIn my opinion, Title of a movie means the name of a movie. It's an official language.\n\nWhat is the working title of the movie. But I don't think a layman like me will use this word.\n\nWait for the natives to reply.\n\nLet's say, I am looking at the movie's poster. Is that what I see there the name of a movie or the title of a movie?\n\nActually, I thought that it's a set phrase and it doesn't depend on the context.\n\nLet's say, I am looking at the movie's poster. Is that what I see there the name of a movie or the title of a movie?\n\nActually, I thought that it's a set phrase and it doesn't depend on the context.\n\nThat's obviously is the TITLE for me. Wait for the valuable inputs from the native speakers.\n\nThese are interchangeable. I agree that \"title\" is the proper word, and we probably should say \"title\" but we're just as likely to say \"Hey, what was the name of that movie?\" We do the same with books.\n\nI went to a few movie review sites. Surprisingly they never use the word \"title\" or \"name\" within any of the sites.\n\nThey have lists to check.\n\nReviews, Great Movies; Now Playing.\n\nWhen you click one of the movies the review comes up and it lists:\n\nCast, Director, Studio, Writer, Cinematographer, Release Date.\n\nBut no where does \"title\" or \"name\" appear.\n\nAnd thinking back a conversation might play out like this (again with no \"name\" or \"title\":\n\nDo you want to see a movie tonight?\n\nWhat's playing?\n\nThe Foreigner.\n\nWho's in it?\n\nJackie Chan.\n\nSounds great; when is it playing?\n\nI went to a few movie review sites.

Even if it is not there , how would you get the list without typing the name.\n\nIt is because the name or the title is at top of the page in block letters.

Does it sound unnatural to say title or name? If so, how would you rephrase it?\n\nThere was this movie I loved when I was a teenager, I saw it in Hungarian. I'd love to watch it again. Just wondering what the title/name could be in English, because sometimes it's not translated literally."
