It remained in its fully assembled state for some 100 million years before it began to break up. The concept of Pangea was first developed by German meteorologist and geophysicist Alfred Wegener in 1915.\n\nplate tectonicsRead more about the formation and fragmentation of Pangea.\n\nWhat is a supercontinent?\n\nA supercontinent is a landmass made up of most or all of Earth’s land. By this definition the landmass formed by present-day Africa and Eurasia could be considered a supercontinent. The most recent supercontinent to incorporate all of Earth’s major—and perhaps best-known—landmasses was Pangea. Supercontinents have coalesced and broken apart episodically over the course of Earth’s geological history. Scientists suggest that the next supercontinent capable of rivaling Pangea in size will form some 250 million years from now, when Africa, the Americas, and Eurasia collide.\n\nplate tectonicsRead more about the supercontinent cycle.\n\nHow did Pangea form?\n\nIt’s now widely accepted that the formation of supercontinents like Pangea can be explained by plate tectonics—the scientific theory which states that Earth’s surface is made up of a system of plates that float on top of a deeper plastic layer. Earth’s tectonic plates collide with and dive beneath one another at convergent boundaries, pull away from one another at divergent boundaries, and shift laterally past one another at transform boundaries. Continents combine to form supercontinents like Pangea every 300 to 500 million years before splitting apart again. Many geologists argue that continents merge as an ocean (such as the Atlantic Ocean) widens, spreading at divergent boundaries. Over time, as the landmasses collide in the limited space remaining, a Pangea-sized supercontinent forms.\n\nplate tectonicsRead more about plate tectonics.\n\nHow did Pangea’s formation affect life on Earth?\n\nGeologists contend that Pangea’s formation seems to have been partially responsible for the mass extinction event at the end of the Permian Period, particularly in the marine realm. As Pangea formed, the extent of shallow water habitats declined, and land barriers inhibited cold polar waters from circulating into the tropics. This is thought to have reduced dissolved oxygen levels in the warm water habitats that remained and contributed to the 95 percent reduction of diversity in marine species. Pangea’s breakup had the opposite effect: more shallow water habitat emerged as overall shoreline length increased, and new habitats were created as channels between the smaller landmasses opened and allowed warm and cold ocean waters to mix. On land, the breakup separated plant and animal populations, but life-forms on the newly isolated continents developed unique adaptations to their new environments over time, and biodiversity increased.\n\nspeciationRead more about how speciation (the formation of new and distinct species) works.\n\nHow did Pangea affect Earth's climate?\n\nPangea was immense and possessed a great degree of climatic variability, with its interior exhibiting cooler and more arid conditions than its edge. Some paleoclimatologists report evidence of short rainy seasons in Pangea’s dry interior. Climatic patterns of the entire globe were affected by the presence of Pangea as well, since it stretched from far northern latitudes to far southern latitudes. The equatorial waters of Panthalassa—the superocean that surrounded Pangea—were largely isolated from cold ocean currents because the Paleo Tethys and Tethys seas, which together formed an immense warm water sea surrounded by various parts of Pangea, also affected the supercontinent’s climate, bringing humid tropical air and rain downwind. Pangea’s breakup might have also contributed to an increase in temperatures at the poles, as colder waters mixed with warmer waters.\n\nocean currentLearn more about the effects of ocean currents.\n\nPangea, in early geologic time, a supercontinent that incorporated almost all the landmasses on Earth. Pangea was surrounded by a global ocean called Panthalassa, and it was fully assembled by the Early Permian Epoch (some 299 million to about 273 million years ago). The supercontinent began to break apart about 200 million years ago, during the Early Jurassic Epoch (201 million to 174 million years ago), eventually forming the modern continents and the Atlantic and Indian oceans. Pangea’s existence was first proposed in 1912 by German meteorologist Alfred Wegener as a part of his theory of continental drift. Its name is derived from the Greek pangaia, meaning “all the Earth.”\n\nFormation\n\nThe assembly of Pangea’s component landmasses was well underway by the Devonian Period (419.2 million to 358.9 million years ago) as the paleocontinents Laurentia (a landmass made up of the North American craton—that is, the continent’s stable interior portion) and Baltica (a landmass made up of the Eastern European craton) joined with several smaller microcontinents to form Euramerica. By the beginning of the Permian Period (298.9 million to 252.2 million years ago), the northwestern coastline of the ancient continent Gondwana (a paleocontinent that would eventually fragment to become South America, India, Africa, Australia, and Antarctica) collided with and joined the southern part of Euramerica (a paleocontinent made up of North America and southern Europe). With the fusion of the Angaran craton of Siberia to that combined landmass during the middle of the Early Permian, the assembly of Pangea was complete.\n\nGeography\n\nPangea was C-shaped, with the bulk of its mass stretching between Earth’s northern and southern polar regions. The curve of the eastern edge of the supercontinent contained an embayment called the Tethys Sea, or Tethys Ocean. The Paleo-Tethys Ocean took shape during Pangea’s initial assembly phase. This ocean was slowly replaced by the Neo-Tethys Ocean after a strip of continental material known as the Cimmerian continent, or the Cimmerian superterrane, detached from northern Gondwana and rotated northward.\n\nOn the periphery of Pangea was Cathaysia, a smaller continent extending beyond the eastern edge of Angara and comprising the landmasses of both North and South China. Cathaysia lay within the western Panthalassic Ocean and at the eastern end of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. Both oceans also contained scattered fragments of continental crust (microcontinents), basaltic volcanic island arcs, oceanic plateaus, and trenches. These island arcs and other isolated landmasses were later welded onto the margins of Pangea, forming accreted terranes (landmasses that collide with continents).\n\nThe assembly of the various large landmasses into the supercontinent led to the development of extensive dry climates in the supercontinent’s tropics during Permian times. As low-latitude seaways closed, warm surface ocean currents were deflected into much higher latitudes (areas closer to the poles), and cool-water upwelling developed along Pangea’s west coast. Extensive mountain-building events (or orogenies) occurred where the continents collided with one another, and the newly created high mountain ranges strongly influenced local and regional terrestrial climates. East-west atmospheric flow in the temperate and higher latitudes was disrupted by two high mountain chains—one in the tropics oriented east-west and one running north-south—that diverted warm marine air into higher latitudes.\n\nThese developments may have contributed to the series of mass extinction events that took place near the end of the Permian Period. Paleoecologists have posited that continental collisions eliminated several shallow-water marine basins—the primary habitat of most marine invertebrates—and Pangea’s north-south orientation, which drastically changed ocean circulation patterns, altered regional climates. In addition, by the end of the Permian Period, land largely prevented cooler waters near the poles from entering the Paleo-Tethys and Neo-Tethys basins, which may have raised water temperatures in shallow areas above the tolerance limits of corals and other organisms (see also Permian extinction).\n\nBreakup\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nThe mechanism for the breakup of Pangea is now explained in terms of plate tectonics rather than Wegener’s outmoded concept of continental drift, which simply stated that Earth’s continents were once joined together into the supercontinent Pangea that lasted for most of geologic time. Plate tectonics states that Earth’s outer shell, or lithosphere, consists of large rigid plates that move apart at oceanic ridges, come together at subduction zones, or slip past one another along fault lines. The pattern of seafloor spreading indicates that Pangea did not break apart all at once but rather fragmented in distinct stages. Plate tectonics also postulates that the continents joined with one another and broke apart several times in Earth’s geologic history.\n\nThe first oceans formed from the breakup, some 180 million years ago, were the central Atlantic Ocean between northwestern Africa and North America and the southwestern Indian Ocean between Africa and Antarctica. The South Atlantic Ocean opened about 140 million years ago as Africa separated from South America. About the same time, India separated from Antarctica and Australia, forming the central Indian Ocean. Finally, about 80 million years ago, North America separated from Europe, Australia began to rift away from Antarctica, and India broke away from Madagascar. India eventually collided with Eurasia approximately 50 million years ago, forming the Himalayas."
