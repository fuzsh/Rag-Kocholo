Yager\n\nBoard Member At-Large\n\nCollege student and outdoor extraordinaire, Markell Yager Trezvant, is one of NCLF’s newest board members. Ready to offer her skills and efforts to support the Fillmore and Black Community at large.\n\nWhile Markell is new to her board position, by no means is she new to community involvement. She attributes her interest in serving her community to her mother/ Grandmother Ms. Lily Trezvant, NCLF’s own Board President and jack of all trades. Observing her mom build up her community inspired Markell to do the same! Being raised in the Bayview, Diamond Heights and Fillmore has granted Markell her ability to not only adapt but thrive in various environments and situations.\n\nMarkell is currently 3 semesters away from graduating with her Associate’s degree in Sociology from City College of San Francisco, then heading to California State University, Los Angeles to continue her education. When she started off at CCSF, Markell was studying Real Estate but recognized that unconsciously her heart was set on Sociology. When she is not studying hard, Markell can be found reading books of all kinds and enjoying time with her dog Simba. Markell also enjoys hiking, fishing and can put together some gorgeous floral arrangements! Talent and ambition are not limited to just Markell, as she comes from four brothers; one of which graduated from Briar Cliff University and one who is currently in the Military, as well as three sisters. Coming from a large tight-knit family is what has helped mold Markell into the person she is today.\n\nFive years from now Markell sees herself walking after the aneurysm she sustained 4 years ago, traveling to Europe once again and striving to sustain equal opportunities for her community!\n\nKatherine Campbell\n\nBoard Member At-Large\n\nThe most powerful moment of my life was when I developed a strong community relationship and became a community leader, working in the communities of San Francisco and Oakland – Katherine Campbell.\n\nMs. Campbell’s journey into community leadership and service began in 1969. She had received a scholarship to Miami University and left San Francisco for Miami, Florida. Less than a year after leaving for Miami, she moved back to San Francisco and committed to serving the community. She received political education from the Black Panther Party (BPP) and was a member of BPP from 1969 – 1978.\n\nTo serve the community effectively, Ms. Campbell acquired skills and certifications. As a member of BPP, she received an Associate Degree in social sciences from Laney College. She went on to study Civil Engineering at San Francisco State University and Family Counseling and Eviction Defense at UC Berkeley. She got her counseling certification from UC Berkeley.\n\nIn line with her purpose and passion, Ms. Campbell’s career was centered around community leadership and service. After her education, she took an internship at S.F. County Jail at 850 Bryant for its pre-release program. In this position, she provided counseling for inmates to help find housing placement and readjust to life after incarceration. She also interned at Juli House as a counselor for young pregnant women, providing assessment and counseling and helping them prepare for motherhood and independent living.\n\nAs a counselor for Mission Housing, Ms. Campbell worked on the transitional housing program for homeless people by providing counseling and other supportive services. She was also a case manager and counselor for the Family Service Agency.\n\nKatherine Campbell was part of BPP during the development of its 10-point service plan and supported the Sickle Cell Anemia program. She was also an active part of BPP’s projects, Seniors Against a Fearful Environment and Oakland Community School. Oakland Community School was one of the best accredited alternative schools. Ms. Campbell was also part of the free breakfast project of the party in Fillmore, San Francisco. In 2019, she commemorated the 50th year anniversary of the establishment of Black Panther Party breakfast program serving hunger kids.\n\nFrom when she was a young child and every member of her family played roles towards a common goal and then all through her life, Ms. Campbell has seen how teamwork is essential for productivity. She is a strong believer in the values of teamwork. In her words, “It took all of us to work out a plan: a whole team, I, my mom, and siblings, contributed in sustaining the home and maintaining the family as important building blocks.” She also believes that teamwork inspires ownership describing that as, a young child, it was “exciting to know that we can have some ownership through teamwork.”\n\nAs someone who makes decisions after carefully thinking them through, Ms. Campbell’s top pieces of advice for anyone are: take advice from your elders, stay focused, look before you leap into things, and let your dreams of ownership materialize. Katherine Campbell summarizes her life’s journey in the pursuit of happiness as “If you put your mind to it; then, you can do it.” In her words, “I have learned that life is a building block; you have to build up to it because I find it instrumental in accomplishing goals.”\n\nPhyllis Bowie\n\nBoard Member At-Large\n\nFrom Hollywood to Food Stamps – Phyllis Bowie is a native San Franciscan raised in the Fillmore district and is a proud Air Force veteran. She is a community advocate for urban food security and fair and equitable housing. After 10 years of working in the entertainment industry as a lifestyle expert and interior designer, Phyllis Bowie lost both her TV contract and her booking agent. Bowie found herself faced with quadruple raised rent and as a result was threatened with eviction from her apartment of 25 years and literally found herself hungry. Eventually putting her pride aside, she applied for food stamps. Bowie was depressed and feared homelessness like so many of her fellow veterans. Faced with skyrocketed rents, unfair housing, out of control homelessness, gentrification, watching the City’s’ Black population reduce to 3% and witnessing Black businesses in her beloved Fillmore community fall like dominoes. Bowie had reached her limit. She became sick and tired of being sick and tired of hopelessness. At that point after being in front of the camera, Bowie picked up a borrowed video camera and from behind the camera never looked back. Her nonprofit business Living with Phyllis was born.\n\nLiving with Phyllis grew into an award-winning local television show and a food blog that entertains and provides information to the underserved to remove the stigma of receiving food benefits and on how to feed their families on food stamps and on a rent poor budget.\n\nBowie reclaimed her uplifting and contagious happy disposition. “…prayer and being in service to others was the medicine I needed to lift myself up and to find the beauty of living every day in gratitude..” said Bowie now no longer on food stamps as she darted off with camera in hand to the Fillmore Farmer’s Market to spread the news about the food stamp Market Match program.\n\nPhyllis Bowies’ life commitment to the San Francisco African American community is to address food insecurity by creating community vegetable gardens, partnering with local farmer’s markets and partnering with community leaders to educate underserved families. This education empowers the community with knowledge and skills on how to grow and prepare healthy foods that help to reduce diseases like diabetes, high-blood pressure and obesity which disproportionately plaques Black communities."
