        "text": "Overview of COVID-19 vaccination\n\nThese clinical considerations provide information to healthcare professionals and public health officials on use of COVID-19 vaccines. They are informed by:\n\nRecommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nDeliberations of the ACIP COVID-19 Vaccine Work Group\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine approval (licensure) under a Biologics License Application (BLA) or authorization under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\n\nCDC’s Emergency Use Instructions (EUI) for FDA-approved vaccines\n\nEmergency Use Listing (EUL) of COVID-19 vaccines by the World Health Organization (WHO)\n\nACIP’s General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines\n\nTwo types of COVID-19 vaccines are available for use in the United States:\n\nmRNA vaccines\n\nModerna COVID-19 Vaccine (2023–2024 Formula) is authorized for children ages 6 months–11 years; SPIKEVAX is the licensed Moderna product for people ages 12 years and older. These vaccines are hereafter referred to as updated (2023–2024 Formula) Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (2023–2024 Formula) is authorized for children ages 6 months–11 years; COMIRNATY is the licensed Pfizer-BioNTech product for people ages 12 years and older. These vaccines are hereafter referred to as updated (2023–2024 Formula) Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.\n\nProtein subunit vaccine\n\nNovavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (2023–2024 Formula) is authorized for people ages 12 years and older. It is hereafter referred to as updated (2023–2024 Formula) Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine composition\n\nThe 2023–2024 formulation for all COVID-19 vaccines licensed or authorized in the United States (Moderna, Novavax, and Pfizer-BioNTech) has been updated to a monovalent vaccine based on the Omicron XBB.1.5 sublineage of SARS-CoV-2. The Original monovalent and bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) formulations should no longer be used.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine-specific package inserts and EUA fact sheets for healthcare providers (fact sheets) and U.S. COVID-19 Vaccine Product Information can be consulted for a full list of ingredients and information on the conditions of use, storage and handling, preparation, and administration procedures.\n\nRecommendations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nGroups recommended for vaccination\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older in the United States for the prevention of COVID-19. There is currently no FDA-approved or FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine for children younger than age 6 months. CDC recommends that people stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nThere is no preferential recommendation for the use of any one COVID-19 vaccine over another when more than one recommended and age-appropriate vaccine is available.\n\nVaccination schedules can be found in Table 1 for people who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised and in Table 2 for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised. See Appendix A for recommendations for people who received COVID-19 vaccine outside the United States.\n\nVaccine dosage and administration\n\nCDC recommends that people receive the age-appropriate vaccine product and dosage based on their age on the day of vaccination and in accordance with the recommended intervals for that age group (1). However, for children who transition from age 4 years to age 5 years and children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised and transition from age 11 years to age 12 years, FDA authorization allows for an alternative dosage (see Table 1, Table 2, and Transitioning from a younger to older age group).\n\nVaccine doses should be administered by the intramuscular route.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination guidance for people who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccination schedule for people who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised is detailed in Table 1. The recommended vaccine type and number of updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine doses are based on age and vaccination history.\n\nAges 6 months–4 years\n\nUnvaccinated: 2 or 3 homologous (i.e., from the same manufacturer) updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine doses, depending on vaccine manufacturer (i.e., Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nPreviously received an incomplete series of Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine doses: Complete the vaccination series with 1 or 2 homologous updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine doses, depending on vaccine manufacturer and the number of previous vaccine doses.\n\nPreviously received all doses in the initial vaccination series with Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine: 1 homologous updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine dose.\n\nSpecial situations for children ages 6 months–4 years: For information on circumstances in which heterologous dosing may be considered when doses from the same manufacturer are recommended, and guidance on completing the initial vaccination series if children in this age group receive 1 dose of Moderna and 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech, see the section on Interchangeability.\n\nAges 5–11 years\n\nUnvaccinated or previously received any number of Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine doses: 1 dose of an updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine from either manufacturer (i.e., Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nAges 12 years and older\n\nUnvaccinated: 1 dose of an updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech) OR 2 doses of updated (2023–2024 Formula) Novavax vaccine.\n\nPreviously received 1 or more Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine doses: 1 dose of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nPreviously received 1 or more doses of Original monovalent Novavax vaccine, alone or in combination with any Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine doses: 1 dose of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nPreviously received 1 or more doses of Janssen vaccine, alone or in combination with any Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine or Original monovalent Novavax doses: 1 dose of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nSpecial situation for people ages 65 years and older: People ages 65 years and older should receive 1 additional dose of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech) at least 4 months following the previous dose of updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine. For initial vaccination with updated (2023–2024 Formula) Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, the 2-dose series should be completed before administration of the additional dose.\n\nTable 1. People who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised: Recommended COVID-19 vaccination schedule by COVID-19 vaccination history, October 25, 2023\n\nAges 6 months–4 years\n\nNotes:\n\nEnsure the correct volume of updated (2023–2024 Formula) Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (0.25 mL) is withdrawn from the vial. Discard the vial and excess volume after extracting a single dose. See FDA Announcement and Moderna Healthcare Provider Fact Sheet.\n\nAll COVID-19 vaccine doses in this age group should be homologous; see footnote* for more information.\n\nAges 6 months–4 years COVID-19 vaccination history\n\nprior to updated (2023–2024 Formula) vaccine† Updated (2023–2024 Formula)\n\nvaccine Number of updated (2023–2024 Formula)\n\nvaccine doses indicated Dosage\n\n(mL/ug) Vaccine vial cap\n\nand label colors Interval between doses Unvaccinated Moderna 2 0.25 mL/25 ug Dark blue cap; green label Dose 1 and Dose 2: 4–8 weeks‡ OR Pfizer-BioNTech 3 0.3 mL/3 ug Yellow cap; yellow label Dose 1 and\n\nDose 2: 3–8 weeks‡\n\nDose 2 and Dose 3: At least 8 weeks 1 dose any Moderna Moderna 1 0.25 mL/25 ug Dark blue cap; green label 4–8 weeks after last dose‡ 2 or more doses any Moderna Moderna 1 0.25 mL/25 ug Dark blue cap; green label At least 8 weeks after last dose 1 dose any Pfizer-BioNTech Pfizer-BioNTech 2 0.3 mL/3 ug Yellow cap; yellow label Dose 1: 3–8 weeks after last dose‡\n\nDose 1 and Dose 2: At least 8 weeks 2 doses any Pfizer-BioNTech Pfizer-BioNTech 1 0.3 mL/3 ug Yellow cap; yellow label At least 8 weeks after last dose 3 or more doses any Pfizer-BioNTech Pfizer-BioNTech 1 0.3 mL/3 ug Yellow cap; yellow label At least 8 weeks after last dose\n\nAges 5–11 years\n\nNotes:\n\nEnsure the correct volume of updated (2023–2024 Formula) Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (0.25 mL) is withdrawn from the vial.

For initial vaccination with updated (2023–2024 Formula) Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, the 2-dose series should be completed before administration of the additional dose. If Moderna is used, administer 0.5 mL/50 ug; if Novavax is used, administer 0.5 mL/5 ug rS protein and 50 ug Matrix-M adjuvant; if Pfizer-BioNTech is used, administer 0.3 mL/30 ug.\n\nAbbreviation: rS = recombinant spike\n\n*Per FDA authorization, all COVID-19 vaccine doses in this age group should be homologous; see Interchangeability of COVID-19 vaccines for information on circumstances in which heterologous dosing may be considered.\n\n†COVID-19 vaccination history refers to previous receipt of doses of Original monovalent mRNA or bivalent mRNA vaccine or a combination of the two; for people ages 12 years and older, Original monovalent Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine doses, alone or in combination with any mRNA vaccine doses; and for people ages 18 years and older, Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine doses, alone or in combination with any mRNA or Original monovalent Novavax vaccine doses.\n\n‡An 8-week interval between the first and second COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna, Novavax, and Pfizer-BioNTech) doses might be optimal for some people as it might reduce the small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with these vaccines.\n\n§For children who transition from age 4 years to age 5 years during the initial vaccination series:\n\nModerna series: Children are recommended to complete the 2-dose series with updated (2023–2024 Formula) Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, 0.25 mL/25 ug (dark blue cap; green label), as per the FDA EUA; there is no dosage change.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech series: Children who received 1 or 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for ages 6 months–4 years, 0.3 mL/3 ug (yellow cap; yellow label) are recommended to receive 1 dose of updated (2023­–2024 Formula) Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, 0.3 mL/10 ug (blue cap; blue label) on or after turning age 5 years. If the 10 ug dose is the second dose, administer 3–8 weeks after the first dose; if it is the third dose, administer at least 8 weeks after the second dose. Alternatively, these children may complete the 3-dose series with updated (2023–2024 Formula) Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for ages 6 months–4 years, 0.3 mL/3 ug (yellow cap; yellow label), as per the FDA EUA.\n\n¶Updated (2023–2024 Formula) Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and updated (2023–2024 Formula) Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine are also available in a prefilled, single-dose syringe for people ages 12 years and older.\n\nConsiderations for extended intervals for COVID-19 vaccine doses\n\nAn 8-week interval between the first and second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech) doses and between the first and second doses of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine might be optimal for some people as it might reduce the small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with these COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhile absolute risk remains small, an elevated risk for myocarditis and pericarditis has been observed among mRNA COVID-19 vaccine recipients, particularly in males ages 12–39 years (see COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditis for additional information). Cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were identified in clinical trials of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine and through passive surveillance during post-authorization use outside the United States.\n\nUnder the current COVID-19 vaccination schedule (Table 1), the extended interval consideration applies only to the following people who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised:\n\nAges 6 months–4 years, depending on their vaccination history\n\nAges 12 years–64 years and receiving a 2-dose Novavax series\n\nThe minimum interval between the first and second doses continues to be recommended for:\n\nPeople who are moderately or severely immunocompromised\n\nPeople ages 65 years and older receiving Novavax vaccine\n\nSituations when the fullest possible protection needs to be achieved sooner (e.g., increased concern about an individual’s higher risk for severe disease)\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination guidance for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccination schedule for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised is detailed in Table 2. The recommended vaccine type and number of updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine doses are based on age and vaccination history.\n\nFor information on the use of pemivibart (Pemgarda™) for COVID-19 pre-exposure prophylaxis, see COVID-19 vaccination and pemivibart.\n\nAges 6 months–4 years\n\nUnvaccinated: 3 homologous (i.e., from the same manufacturer) updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine doses (i.e., Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nPreviously received 1 or 2 Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine doses: Complete the 3-dose series with 2 or 1 homologous updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine doses, respectively.\n\nPreviously received a combined total of 3 or more Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine doses: 1 dose of homologous updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine.\n\nAdditional doses: May receive 1 or more additional homologous updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine doses.\n\nAges 5–11 years\n\nUnvaccinated: 3 homologous (i.e., from the same manufacturer) updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine doses (i.e., Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nPreviously received 1 or 2 Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine doses: Complete the 3-dose series with 2 or 1 homologous updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine doses, respectively.\n\nPreviously received a combined total of 3 or more Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine doses: 1 dose of updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine from either manufacturer.\n\nAdditional doses: May receive 1 or more additional updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine doses from either manufacturer.\n\nAges 12 years and older\n\nUnvaccinated: 3 homologous (i.e., from the same manufacturer) updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine doses (i.e., Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech) OR 2 updated (2023–2024 Formula) Novavax vaccine doses.\n\nPreviously received 1 or 2 Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine doses: Complete the 3-dose series with 2 or 1 homologous updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine doses, respectively.\n\nPreviously received a combined total of 3 or more Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine doses: 1 dose of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nPreviously received 1 or more Original monovalent Novavax vaccine doses, alone or in combination with any Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine doses: 1 dose of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nPreviously received 1 or more doses of Janssen vaccine, alone or in combination with any Original monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine or Original monovalent Novavax doses: 1 dose of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech).\n\nAdditional doses:\n\nPeople ages 12–64 years may receive 1 or more additional doses of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech)\n\nPeople ages 65 years and older should receive 1 additional dose and may receive further additional doses of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech)\n\nSpecial situations: For information on circumstances in which heterologous dosing may be considered when doses from the same manufacturer are recommended, and guidance on completing the initial vaccination series if people ages 6 months and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised receive 1 dose of Moderna and 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech, see the section on Interchangeability.\n\nPeople who were vaccinated for COVID-19 and subsequently become moderately or severely immunocompromised should follow the COVID-19 vaccination schedule according to their age and prior COVID-19 vaccination history (Table 2); see Considerations for timing of COVID-19 vaccination in relation to immunosuppressive therapies for vaccination of people who will shortly become moderately or severely immunocompromised (e.g., prior to organ transplant) and Considerations for COVID-19 revaccination.\n\nTable 2.

People ages 12 years and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have the option to receive 1 additional dose of updated (2023–2024 Formula) Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, 0.5 mL/50 ug (dark blue cap; blue label) updated (2023–2024 Formula) Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine; or updated (2023­–2024 Formula) Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, 0.3 mL/30 ug (gray cap; gray label) at least 2 months following the last recommended updated (2023­–2024 Formula) vaccine dose. Further additional doses may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last updated (2023–­2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine dose.\n\n§Administration of additional doses is as follows:\n\nPeople ages 12–64 years who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may receive 1 additional dose of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech) at least 2 months after the last dose of updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine indicated in Table 2. Further additional doses may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine dose.\n\nPeople ages 65 years and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should receive 1 additional dose of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech) at least 2 months after the last dose of updated (2023–2024 Formula) vaccine indicated in Table 2. Further additional doses may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine dose.\n\nFor all age groups, the dosage for the additional doses is as follows: Moderna, 0.5 mL/50 ug; Novavax, 0.5 mL/5 ug rS protein and 50 ug Matrix-M adjuvant; Pfizer-BioNTech, 0.3 mL/30 ug.\n\n¶Updated (2023–­2024 Formula) Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and updated (2023­–2024 Formula) Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine are also available in a prefilled, single-dose syringe for people ages 12 years and older.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination and pemivibart\n\nPemivibart (Pemgarda™) is a monoclonal antibody for COVID-19 pre-exposure prophylaxis in people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised and unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination and who meet the FDA-authorized conditions for use. Pemivibart is not authorized for treatment of COVID-19 or for post-exposure prophylaxis. Healthcare providers should consult the pemivibart EUA fact sheet and EUA frequently asked questions for the FDA-authorized conditions under which pemivibart may be used.\n\nPemivibart is not a substitute for COVID-19 vaccination. People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should receive COVID-19 vaccine according to the recommended schedule. Per the pemivibart EUA, administration of pemivibart should be deferred for at least 2 weeks after a dose of COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nDescription of moderate and severe immunocompromising conditions and treatment\n\nModerate and severe immunocompromising conditions and treatments include but are not limited to:\n\nActive treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies\n\nHematologic malignancies associated with poor responses to COVID-19 vaccines regardless of current treatment status (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute leukemia)\n\nReceipt of solid-organ transplant or an islet transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy\n\nReceipt of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy or hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) (within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppressive therapy)\n\nModerate or severe primary immunodeficiency (e.g., common variable immunodeficiency disease, severe combined immunodeficiency, DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome)\n\nAdvanced HIV infection (people with HIV and CD4 cell counts less than 200/mm3, history of an AIDS-defining illness without immune reconstitution, or clinical manifestations of symptomatic HIV) or untreated HIV infection\n\nActive treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (i.e., 20 mg or more of prednisone or equivalent per day when administered for 2 or more weeks), alkylating agents, antimetabolites, transplant-related immunosuppressive drugs, cancer chemotherapeutic agents classified as severely immunosuppressive, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, and other biologic agents that are immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory (e.g., B-cell-depleting agents)\n\nFactors to consider in assessing the general level of immune competence in a patient include disease severity, duration, clinical stability, complications, comorbidities, and any potentially immune-suppressing treatment.\n\nFor additional information about the degree of immune suppression associated with different medical conditions and treatments, providers can consult ACIP’s General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunizations, the CDC Yellow Book, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America policy statement, 2013 IDSA Clinical Practice Guideline for Vaccination of the Immunocompromised Host.\n\nSelf-attestation of immunocompromised status\n\nPeople can self-attest to their moderately or severely immunocompromised status and receive COVID-19 vaccine doses wherever vaccines are offered. Vaccinators should not deny COVID-19 vaccination to a person due to lack of documentation.\n\nConsiderations for COVID-19 revaccination\n\nRecipients of HCT or CAR-T-cell therapy who received 1 or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine prior to or during treatment should be revaccinated. Revaccination should start at least 3 months (12 weeks) after transplant or CAR-T-cell therapy and should follow the currently recommended schedule for people who are unvaccinated (Table 2).\n\nRevaccination may also be considered for patients who received 1 or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine during treatment with B-cell-depleting therapies (e.g., rituximab, ocrelizumab) that were administered over a limited period (e.g., as part of a treatment regimen for certain malignancies) according to the currently recommended schedule (Table 2). The suggested interval to start revaccination is about 6 months after completion of the B-cell-depleting therapy. Timing of vaccination for patients who receive B-cell-depleting therapies on a continuing basis (e.g., for treatment of certain autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis) is addressed in Considerations for timing of COVID-19 vaccination in relation to immunosuppressive therapies.\n\nA patient’s clinical team is best positioned to determine the degree of immune compromise, need for revaccination, and appropriate timing of revaccination.\n\nConsiderations for timing of COVID-19 vaccination in relation to immunosuppressive therapies\n\nAdministration of COVID-19 vaccines should not be delayed in patients taking immunosuppressive therapies. Whenever possible, COVID-19 vaccines should be administered at least 2 weeks before initiation or resumption of immunosuppressive therapies. For patients who receive B-cell-depleting therapies on a continuing basis, COVID-19 vaccines should be administered approximately 4 weeks before the next scheduled therapy.\n\nTiming of COVID-19 vaccination should take into consideration:\n\nCurrent or planned immunosuppressive therapies\n\nOptimization of both the patient’s medical condition and anticipated response to vaccination\n\nIndividual benefits and risks\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, providers caring for these patients may administer Moderna, Novavax, and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines outside of the FDA and CDC dosing intervals when, based on their clinical judgment, the benefits of vaccination are deemed to outweigh the potential and unknown risks for the recipient who is immunocompromised.\n\nThe utility of serologic testing, cellular immune testing, or B-cell quantification to assess immune response to vaccination and guide clinical care has not been established. Such testing outside of the context of research studies is not recommended at this time.\n\nTiming, spacing, age transitions, and simultaneous administration\n\n4-Day grace period\n\nDoses administered up to 4 days before the minimum interval or age, known as the 4-day grace period, are considered valid. If a dose is administered prior to the 4-day grace period, see Appendix B. Doses administered at any time after the recommended interval are valid.\n\nTransitioning from a younger to older age group\n\nCDC recommends that people receive the age-appropriate vaccine product and dosage based on their age on the day of vaccination (Table 1 and Table 2).\n\nIf a person moves to an older age group between vaccine doses, they should receive the vaccine product and dosage for the older age group for all subsequent doses. However, for children who transition from age 4 years to age 5 years and children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised and transition from age 11 years to age 12 years, FDA authorization allows for an alternative dosage (see Table 1 and Table 2).\n\nSimultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines\n\nIn accordance with General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, routine administration of all age-appropriate doses of vaccines simultaneously, also known as coadministration, is recommended for children, adolescents, and adults if there are no contraindications at the time of the healthcare visit. Simultaneous administration is defined as administering more than one vaccine on the same clinic day, at different anatomic sites, and not combined in the same syringe. Providers may simultaneously administer COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines to eligible patients; the Health Alert Network (HAN) published on September 5, 2023 may be consulted for additional information about simultaneous administration of these vaccines.\n\nThere are additional considerations for simultaneous administration of an orthopoxvirus vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine as follows:\n\nThere is no required minimum interval between receiving a dose of any COVID-19 vaccine and an orthopoxvirus vaccine, either JYNNEOS or ACAM2000 vaccine (e.g., for mpox prevention), regardless of which vaccine is administered first.\n\nUse of JYNNEOS vaccine should be prioritized over ACAM2000 when co-administering a COVID-19 vaccine and an orthopoxvirus vaccine.\n\nPeople, particularly adolescent or young adult males, who are recommended to receive both vaccines might consider waiting 4 weeks between vaccines. This is because of the observed risk for myocarditis and pericarditis after receipt of ACAM2000 orthopoxvirus vaccine and COVID-19 vaccines, and the hypothetical risk for myocarditis and pericarditis after JYNNEOS vaccine. However, if a patient’s risk for mpox or severe disease due to COVID-19 is increased, administration of mpox and COVID-19 vaccines should not be delayed.\n\nNirsevimab: In accordance with General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccine and nirsevimab (a long-acting monoclonal antibody for certain infants and young children for prevention of RSV) is recommended.\n\nFor best practices for administering multiple injections, see ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization and Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (Pink Book).\n\nInterchangeability of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nmRNA COVID-19 vaccines\n\nChildren ages 6 months–4 years should receive all doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine from the same manufacturer (i.e., homologous dosing); this includes children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised and those who are not. People ages 5 years and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should receive a 3-dose initial mRNA vaccination series using vaccines from the same manufacturer.\n\nFor people who receive 1 Moderna and 1 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose, complete the initial vaccination series as follows:\n\nChildren ages 6 months–4 years who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised should follow a 3-dose schedule. A third dose of either updated (2023–2024 Formula) Moderna vaccine or updated (2023–2024 Formula) Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should be administered at least 8 weeks after the second dose.\n\nPeople ages 6 months and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should follow the recommended 3-dose schedule. A third dose of either updated (2023–2024 Formula) Moderna vaccine or updated (2023–2024 Formula) Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should be administered as follows:\n\nAges 6 months–4 years: at least 8 weeks after the second dose\n\nAges 5 years and older: at least 4 weeks after the second dose\n\nNovavax COVID-19 Vaccine\n\nPeople ages 12 years and older who receive a first dose of updated (2023–2024 Formula) Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine should complete the 2-dose initial vaccination series with Novavax vaccine. Those who previously received 1 dose of original Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine may receive 1 dose of any updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna, Novavax, or Pfizer-BioNTech) (Table 1 and Table 2).\n\nAdministration of COVID-19 vaccine doses from different manufacturers\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine doses from the same manufacturer should be administered whenever recommended. In the following circumstances, an age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccine from a different manufacturer may be administered:\n\nSame vaccine not available at the vaccination site at the time of the clinic visit\n\nPrevious dose unknown\n\nPerson would otherwise not receive a recommended vaccine dose\n\nPerson starts but unable to complete a vaccination series with the same COVID-19 vaccine due to a contraindication\n\nA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) report is not indicated in these circumstances.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccination schedules for people who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised and people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should be consulted for age-specific information; see Appendix B for recommended actions following interchangeability-related COVID-19 vaccine administration errors or deviations.\n\nVaccination and SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing\n\nPre-vaccination testing\n\nAntibody testing is not currently recommended to assess the need for vaccination in an unvaccinated person or to assess immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following COVID-19 vaccination. If antibody testing is done, vaccination should be completed as recommended regardless of the antibody test result.\n\nInterpretation of SARS-CoV-2 test results in vaccinated people\n\nPrior receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine will not affect the results of SARS-CoV-2 viral tests (nucleic acid amplification or antigen tests).\n\nSee also CDC COVID-19 health care professional, CDC COVID-19 laboratory, and FDA SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing Web pages.\n\nPatient counseling\n\nPre-vaccination counseling\n\nProviders should counsel COVID-19 vaccine recipients, parents, or guardians about expected local and systemic reactions.\n\nLocal reactions include pain/tenderness, and, less commonly, swelling and redness at the injection site.\n\nSystemic reactions include fever, fatigue/malaise, headache, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, and diarrhea; among younger children, particularly those younger than age 3 years, systemic reactions also can include irritability/crying, sleepiness, and loss of appetite.\n\nLocalized axillary lymphadenopathy on the same side as the vaccinated arm or groin, if vaccination was in the thigh, has been observed following vaccination with Moderna, Novavax, and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines (2). Infrequently, people who have received dermal fillers might experience temporary swelling at or near the site of filler injection (usually face or lips) following a dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nMyocarditis and pericarditis: People receiving any COVID-19 vaccine, especially males ages 12–39 years, should be made aware of the rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination. Counseling should include the need to seek care if symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis develop after vaccination, particularly in the week after vaccination. See COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditis for additional information.\n\nAnaphylactic reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been rarely reported following receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. For more information on the assessment and potential management of anaphylaxis, see Preparing for the Potential Management of Anaphylaxis after COVID-19 Vaccination.\n\nFor more information on patient counseling, see Vaccine Recipient Education.\n\nPost-vaccination observation period\n\nSyncope (fainting) might occur in association with any injectable vaccine, especially in adolescents. In accordance with General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, vaccination providers, particularly when vaccinating adolescents, should consider observing vaccine recipients for 15 minutes after vaccination.\n\nAdditionally, to monitor for allergic reactions, providers should consider observing people with the following precautions to a previously administered COVID-19 vaccine type for 30 minutes if a subsequent dose of the same vaccine type is administered:\n\nHistory of a non-severe, immediate (onset less than 4 hours) allergic reaction after administration of a previous dose of one COVID-19 vaccine type\n\nHistory of a diagnosed non-severe allergy to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine\n\nSee Contraindications and precautions for more information.\n\nContraindications and precautions\n\nCDC considers the conditions listed in Table 3 to be COVID-19 vaccination contraindications and precautions.\n\nTable 3. Contraindications and precautions to COVID-19 vaccination\n\nTable 3. Contraindications and precautions to COVID-19 vaccination Medical condition or history Guidance Recommended action History of a severe allergic reaction* (e.g., anaphylaxis†) after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine‡ Contraindication Do not vaccinate with the same COVID-19 vaccine type.§\n\nMay administer the alternate COVID-19 vaccine type.§\n\nHistory of a diagnosed non-severe allergy* to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine‡ Precaution May administer the alternate COVID-19 vaccine type.§ History of a non-severe, immediate (onset less than 4 hours) allergic reaction* after administration of a previous dose of one COVID-19 vaccine type§ Precaution Moderate or severe acute illness, with or without fever Precaution Defer vaccination until the illness has improved. History of MIS-C or MIS-A Precaution See COVID-19 vaccination and MIS-C and MIS-A. History of myocarditis or pericarditis within 3 weeks after a dose of any COVID-19 vaccine Precaution A subsequent dose of any COVID-19 vaccine should generally be avoided.\n\nAbbreviations: MIS-C = multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children; MIS-A = multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults\n\n*Allergic reactions in Table 3 are defined as follows:\n\nSevere allergic reactions include: known or possible anaphylaxis, a progressive life-threatening reaction that typically includes urticaria (hives) but also with other symptoms such as wheezing, difficulty breathing, or low blood pressure; angioedema (visible swelling) affecting the airway (i.e., tongue, uvula, or larynx); diffuse rash which also involves mucosal surfaces (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome).\n\nNon-severe allergic reactions include but are not limited to: urticaria beyond the injection site; angioedema involving lips, facial skin, or skin in other locations. NOTE: Any angioedema affecting the airway (i.e., tongue, uvula, or larynx) is considered a severe allergic reaction.\n\n†Anaphylactic reactions have been rarely reported following receipt of COVID-19 vaccines (estimated incidence: 5 per million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered). For more information on the assessment and potential management of anaphylaxis, see Preparing for the Potential Management of Anaphylaxis after COVID-19 Vaccination.\n\n‡See package inserts and EUA fact sheets for a full list of vaccine ingredients. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines contain polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n§The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) are one type of COVID-19 vaccine and the protein subunit vaccine (Novavax) is another type of COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nConsiderations for people with a history of allergies or allergic reactions\n\nPeople with a contraindication to one COVID-19 vaccine type (Table 3) may receive the alternative COVID-19 vaccine type in the usual vaccination setting. Consultation with an allergist-immunologist is encouraged to provide expert evaluation of the original allergic reaction, and depending on the outcome of the evaluation, reassess if administration of additional doses of the same vaccine type may be possible.\n\nPeople with an allergy-related precaution to one COVID-19 vaccine type (Table 3) may receive the alternative COVID-19 vaccine type in the usual vaccination setting. Vaccination with the same COVID-19 vaccine type may be considered on an individual basis; the same vaccine type should be administered in an appropriate setting and under the supervision of a health care provider experienced in the management of severe allergic reactions. An observation period of 30 minutes post-vaccination should be considered. Referral to an allergist-immunologist should be considered.\n\nHealthcare professionals and health departments may request a consultation from CDC’s Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment COVIDvax project for a complex COVID-19 vaccine safety question not readily addressed by CDC guidance.\n\nReporting of vaccine adverse events\n\nFor licensed COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech in people ages 12 years and older), healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to report to VAERS:\n\nAny adverse event that occurs after the administration of a vaccine licensed in the United States, whether or not it is clear that a vaccine caused the adverse event\n\nVaccine administration errors, whether or not associated with an adverse event\n\nFor COVID-19 vaccines given under an EUA, vaccination providers are required to report to VAERS:\n\nVaccine administration errors, whether or not associated with an adverse event\n\nSerious adverse events regardless of causality. Serious adverse events per FDA are defined as:\n\nDeath\n\nA life-threatening adverse event\n\nInpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization\n\nA persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions\n\nA congenital anomaly/birth defect\n\nAn important medical event that based on appropriate medical judgement may jeopardize the individual and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above\n\nCases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in children and adults\n\nCases of myocarditis\n\nCases of pericarditis\n\nCases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death\n\nReporting is also encouraged for any other clinically significant adverse event, even if it is uncertain whether the vaccine caused the event.\n\nInformation on how to submit a report to VAERS is available at https://vaers.hhs.gov or by calling 1-800-822-7967. In addition, anyone can register in V-safe after their COVID-19 vaccination to receive health check-ins via text messages or email.\n\nSafety considerations for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech\n\nIn clinical trials of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines, types of post-vaccination reactions were generally similar. However, the frequency of some reactions varied by age, vaccine manufacturer, and vaccine dose. The most frequent reported reactions, by age group, follow below.\n\nPeople ages 12 years and older\n\nLocal: Injection site pain; less commonly, injection site redness and swelling, and axillary swelling/tenderness\n\nSystemic: Fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and chills; less commonly, fever and nausea/vomiting\n\nOverall, symptoms tended to be more frequent and severe following the second dose of vaccine and among adolescents and younger adults compared with older adults.\n\nChildren ages 6 months–11 years\n\nLocal: Injection site pain/tenderness; less commonly, injection site redness and swelling, and axillary or groin swelling/tenderness\n\nSystemic:\n\nAges 6 months–4 years: Irritability/crying, drowsiness/sleepiness, and decreased/loss of appetite, particularly in children younger than age 3 years; less commonly, fever\n\nAges 5–11 years: Fatigue and headache; less commonly, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, chills, diarrhea, and nausea/vomiting\n\nIn all age groups, most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity, typically began 1–2 days after vaccination, and resolved after 1–3 days.\n\nEUA fact sheets and package inserts can be consulted for detailed information about post-vaccination reactions for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nFebrile seizures can occur in infants and young children ages 6 months–5 years with any condition that causes a fever (most common with high fevers), including COVID-19. Febrile seizures are uncommon after vaccination and were rare in mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials for infants and young children. In rare instances, administration of certain combination vaccines or more than one vaccine at the same clinic visit has been associated with an increased risk of febrile seizures in infants and young children. The potential impact of simultaneous administration of COVID-19 and routine vaccines on the risk of febrile seizures has not been specifically studied. CDC is monitoring for febrile seizures following COVID-19 vaccination in infants and young children.\n\nSee also COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditis.\n\nSafety considerations for Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine\n\nIn clinical trials of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine among people ages 12 years and older, the most frequent reported vaccine reactions included:\n\nLocal: Pain/tenderness at the injection site; less commonly, redness and swelling\n\nSystemic: Fatigue/malaise, headache, and myalgia; less commonly, arthralgia, nausea/vomiting, and fever\n\nIn addition, lymphadenopathy was also reported to occur after Novavax vaccination in the clinical trials.\n\nMost symptoms were mild to moderate in severity, had onset 1-3 days after vaccination, and resolved within 1–3 days. Overall, symptoms were more frequent in people ages 12–64 years compared to people ages 65 years and older and more frequent after dose 2 than dose 1 of the initial vaccination series.\n\nThe EUA fact sheet can be consulted for detailed information about post-vaccination reactions for Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine.\n\nSee also COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditis.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditis\n\nConsiderations for COVID-19 vaccination\n\nCases of myocarditis and pericarditis have rarely been observed following receipt of COVID-19 vaccines used in the United States.\n\nEvidence from multiple monitoring systems in the United States and globally support a causal association for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech) and myocarditis and pericarditis. Cases have occurred most frequently in adolescent and young adult males within 7 days after receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech); however, cases have also been observed in females and after other doses. Data from clinical trials of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine and post-authorization vaccine safety monitoring outside the United States suggest an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following Novavax vaccination.\n\nFor mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine:\n\nAfter reviewing available data, ACIP and CDC determined that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination (e.g., prevention of COVID-19 and its severe outcomes) outweigh the rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in all populations recommended for vaccination.\n\nExtending the interval to 8 weeks between the first and second doses for some people might reduce the rare risk of vaccine-associated myocarditis and pericarditis; see Considerations for extended intervals for COVID-19 vaccination for more information.\n\nPeople, especially males ages 12–39 years, should be made aware of the rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following receipt of these vaccines and the benefit of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing the risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19, including the possibility of cardiac sequelae.\n\nCounseling should include the need to seek care if symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations develop after vaccination, particularly in the week after vaccination.\n\nIn younger children, symptoms of myocarditis might also include non-specific symptoms such as irritability, vomiting, poor feeding, tachypnea, or lethargy.\n\nFor people who have a history of myocarditis associated with MIS-C or MIS-A, see COVID-19 vaccination and MIS-C and MIS-A.\n\nMyocarditis or pericarditis after a dose of COVID-19 vaccine\n\nDevelopment of myocarditis or pericarditis within 3 weeks after a dose of any COVID-19 vaccine is a precaution to a subsequent dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, and subsequent doses should generally be avoided. Experts advise that these people should:\n\nGenerally not receive a subsequent dose of any COVID-19 vaccine\n\nIf, after a risk assessment, the decision is made to administer a subsequent COVID-19 vaccine dose, wait until at least their episode of myocarditis or pericarditis has resolved (resolution of symptoms, no evidence of ongoing heart inflammation or sequelae as determined by patient’s clinical team)\n\nConsiderations for subsequent COVID-19 vaccination might include:\n\nMyocarditis or pericarditis considered unrelated to vaccination (e.g., due to SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses)\n\nPersonal risk of severe acute COVID-19 (e.g., age, underlying conditions)\n\nTiming of any immunomodulatory therapies; ACIP’s General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization can be consulted for more information\n\nHistory of myocarditis or pericarditis that occurred prior to COVID-19 vaccination or more than 3 weeks after a COVID-19 vaccine dose\n\nPeople who have a history of myocarditis or pericarditis that occurred before COVID-19 vaccination or more than 3 weeks after a COVID-19 vaccine dose may receive any currently FDA-approved or FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine after the episode of myocarditis or pericarditis has completely resolved (i.e., resolution of symptoms, no evidence of ongoing heart inflammation or sequelae as determined by the person’s clinical team). This includes people who had myocarditis or pericarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses.\n\nHistory of other heart disease\n\nPeople who have a history of other heart disease, including congenital heart disease and Kawasaki disease, may receive any currently FDA-approved or FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nPeople exposed to SARS-CoV-2\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are not recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis. People with a known or potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure may receive vaccine if they do not have symptoms consistent with COVID-19; however, people should follow CDC’s post-exposure guidance.\n\nPeople with prior or current SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, regardless of a history of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, including people with prolonged post-COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nPeople with known current SARS-CoV-2 infection should defer any COVID-19 vaccination at least until recovery from the acute illness (if symptoms were present) and criteria to discontinue isolation have been met.\n\nPeople who recently had SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying a COVID-19 vaccine dose by 3 months from symptom onset or positive test (if infection was asymptomatic). Studies have shown that increased time between infection and vaccination might result in an improved immune response to vaccination. Also, a low risk of reinfection has been observed in the weeks to months following infection. Individual factors such as risk of COVID-19 severe disease or characteristics of the predominant SARS-CoV-2 strain should be taken into account when determining whether to delay getting a COVID-19 vaccination after infection.\n\nViral testing to assess for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or serologic testing to assess for prior infection is not recommended for the purpose of vaccine decision-making.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination and MIS-C and MIS-A\n\nMIS-C is a rare but severe condition in children and adolescents infected with SARS-CoV-2. MIS-A, a similar condition in adults, is even rarer and less well characterized. Both include a dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk of recurrence of MIS following reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. It is also unknown if COVID-19 vaccination can, in rare instances, contribute to an MIS-like illness.\n\nConsiderations for initiating COVID-19 vaccination in people with a history of MIS-C or MIS-A\n\nExperts consider the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination for people with a history of MIS-C or MIS-A (i.e., a reduced risk of severe disease including potential recurrence of MIS-C after reinfection) to outweigh a theoretical risk of an MIS-like illness or the risk of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination for those who meet the following two recovery criteria:\n\nClinical recovery has been achieved, including return to baseline cardiac function; and\n\nIt has been at least 90 days after the diagnosis of MIS-C or MIS-A\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination may also be considered for people who had MIS-C or MIS-A and do not meet both criteria, at the discretion of their clinical care team. Experts view clinical recovery, including return to baseline cardiac function, as an important factor when considering COVID-19 vaccination. Additional factors, such as the risk of severe COVID-19 due to age or certain medical conditions, may also be considered.\n\nThe timing of COVID-19 vaccination in people with a history of MIS-C or MIS-A should take into consideration current or planned immunomodulatory therapies for treatment of MIS-C or MIS-A; see Considerations for timing of COVID-19 vaccination in relation to immunosuppressive therapies for more information.\n\nConsiderations for administration of subsequent COVID-19 doses in people diagnosed with MIS-C or MIS-A after COVID-19 vaccination\n\nOnset of MIS more than 60 days after most recent COVID-19 vaccine dose\n\nAdministration of subsequent COVID-19 vaccine doses should be considered for those who meet the two recovery criteria described in Considerations for initiating COVID-19 vaccination in people with a history of MIS-C or MIS-A.\n\nOnset of MIS 60 days or fewer after most recent COVID-19 vaccine dose\n\nFor persons in this category who meet the recovery criteria, the decision whether or not to administer subsequent COVID-19 vaccine doses should be made on an individual basis by the MIS clinical care team and patient or parent or guardian. Subsequent COVID-19 vaccine doses should especially be considered if there is strong evidence that the MIS-C or MIS-A was a complication of a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nConsiderations involving pregnancy, lactation, and fertility\n\nStaying up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations is recommended for people who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the future, and people who are breastfeeding. A growing body of evidence on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination indicates that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any potential risks of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. Maternal vaccination has also been shown to be safe and effective, and protects infants younger than age 6 months from severe COVID-19 and hospitalization.\n\nSide effects can occur after COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant people, similar to those among non-pregnant people. Acetaminophen can be offered as an option for pregnant people experiencing fever (fever has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes) or other post-vaccination symptoms.\n\nFootnotes"
