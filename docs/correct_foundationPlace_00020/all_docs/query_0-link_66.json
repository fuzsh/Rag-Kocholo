        "text": "The 3ʳᵈ International Conference, Toward Sustainable Groundwater in Agriculture: Linking Science & Policy took place from June 18 – 20. Organized by the Water Education Foundation and the UC Davis Robert M. Hagan Endowed Chair, the conference provided scientists, policymakers, agricultural and environmental interest group representatives, government officials and consultants with the latest scientific, management, legal and policy advances for sustaining our groundwater resources in agricultural regions around the world.\n\nThe conference keynote address was provided by Mark Arax, an award-winning journalist and author of books chronicling agriculture and water issues in California’s Central Valley. Arax comes from a family of Central Valley farmers and is praised for writing books that are deeply profound, heartfelt and nuanced including The Dreamt Land, West of the West and The King of California. He did a reading from his latest book The Dreamt Land and commented on the future of groundwater in the Valley during his keynote lunch talk on June 18.\n\nGroundwater is the lifeline for many rural and agricultural regions and their associated cultures and populations around the globe and a cornerstone of global food production. Groundwater constitutes nearly half the world’s drinking water and much of the world’s irrigation water supply.\n\nMore than 150 speakers plus poster presenters were on hand. The conference featured several plenary sessions and four concurrent tracks offering a wide range of policy and technical presentations.\n\nThe Water Education Foundation and UC Davis hosted similar conferences in 2010 & 2016.\n\nView the conference program here.\n\nFor more program information, visit the UC Davis site here.\n\nSession Topics Included:\n\nEmerging Contaminants\n\nSustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) in California\n\nEnvironmental Justice\n\nModeling & Data\n\nSalinity & Nitrate Policy\n\nThe conference also featured discussions about threats to groundwater, such as overuse; salinity; nonpoint source pollution from agricultural activities, animal farming, ranching, and forestry activities; agricultural groundwater impacts to surface water; and groundwater quality and quantity conflicts at the urban-rural interface, which have reached global dimensions and threaten the very livelihood of this planet.\n\nSponsorship Opportunities:\n\nWhether you are a new company seeking exposure to a global audience or an established organization with a strong track record in the field of groundwater, this conference provided a variety of opportunities to set yourself apart and reach new clients. View details of the various sponsorship levels and benefits here.\n\nCooperating Organizations:\n\nAmerican Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)\n\nGroundwater Resources Association of California (GRA)\n\nInternational Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH)\n\nInternational Water Management Institute\n\nNational Groundwater Association (NGWA)\n\nUC Davis Agricultural Water Center\n\nUSDA\n\nWater Institute\n\nPricing Details:\n\nRegistration for the three-day conference was $795 and included lunches and refreshment breaks June 18-20 plus hosted receptions and poster sessions.\n\nFree Monday Workshop Options Included:\n\nAll-Day Session: Implementing Groundwater Demand Management in Agricultural Regions\n\nMorning-Only Session: Regulating, Monitoring & Managing Groundwater Nitrate & Salinity\n\nAfternoon-Only Session: Tools & Strategies to Engage Stakeholders in Groundwater Management & Planning\n\n*NOTE* Registering for the all-day workshop precluded participation in either of the other two workshop sessions since they were hosted at the same time. See more workshop details here.\n\nLocation & Timing Details:\n\nThe 3ʳᵈ International Groundwater Conference was hosted June 18-20 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport in Burlingame, which offered a free airport shuttle.
