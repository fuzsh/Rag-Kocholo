The vision of the TWLF for a Third World College extends far beyond the bounds of campus to a vision of a liberatory education by and for communities of color. The Ethnic Studies Library strives to make this history and legacy more accessible through a public exhibit in the Bernice Layne Brown Gallery at Doe Memorial Library, a reception on April 24, 2019, and the unveiling of a digitized collection of TWLF-related archival materials on Calisphere.

The TWLF 50th anniversary project will be our first online collection digitized in our lab.\n\nIn July 2018, TWLF veterans visited the Ethnic Studies Library and helped select the archives they felt were meaningful in telling the story of the TWLF strike. We are excited to share these documents on Calisphere for all to see.

Dawson and Abby Ginzberg\n\nIn anticipation of next year’s year-long 50th anniversary of the Third World Liberation Front (twLF) at UC Berkeley, the CRG will screen Frank R. Dawson and Abby Ginzberg’s 2016 documentary Agents of Change.\n\nThe film will be followed by a panel discussion with Ziza Delgado, Juanita Tamayo Lott, and Jason Ferreira as well as an info session about next year’s 50th anniversary of the Third World Liberation Front at UC Berkeley.\n\nFILM SYNOPSIS\n\nFrom the well-publicized events at San Francisco State in 1968 to the image of black students with guns emerging from the takeover of the student union at Cornell University in April, 1969, the struggle for a more relevant and meaningful education, including demands for black and ethnic studies programs, became a clarion call across the country in the late 1960’s. Through the stories of these young men and women who were at the forefront of these efforts, Agents of Change examines the untold story of the racial conditions on college campuses and in the country that led to these protests. The film’s characters were caught at the crossroads of the civil rights, black power, and anti-Vietnam war movements at a pivotal time in America’s history. Today, over 45 years later, many of the same demands are surfacing in campus protests across the country, revealing how much work remains to be done. Agents of Change links the past to the present and the present to the past–making it not just a movie but a movement.\n\nBIOS\n\nJason Ferreira is Chair of the Department of Race & Resistance Studies at San Francisco State University. He received his PhD in Ethnic Studies from Berkeley and is a proud veteran of the twLF99 hunger strike. Dr. Ferreira’s teaching and scholarship focus on the history of radicalism within and across communities of color. Recent scholarship includes “With the Soul of a Human Rainbow: Los Siete, Black Panthers, and Third Worldism in San Francisco” and he is completing a social history of the Third World Strike. In the community, Dr. Ferreira co-founded the Institute for MultiRacial Justice. He also established the Center for Political Education as a space dedicated to building strong movements and the Left through education, analysis, theory, and activism. He currently serves on the Board of Directors for the Freedom Archives and the Kendra Alexander Foundation.\n\nJuanita Tamayo Lott is featured in Agents of Change. After helping to set up the College of Ethnic Studies at SF State in 1969 – 1971, Juanita completed graduate work at the University of Chicago. Her career in Washington, D.C as a demographer/statistician in the federal statistical system focused on the impact of demographic shifts on public policy. Her latest book in progress is Golden Children: The Legacy of Ethnic Studies at SF State. The Juanita Tamayo Lott Collection resides in the Asian Division of the Library of Congress. She serves on the planning committee for the 50th anniversaries of the SF State student strike and founding of the College of Ethnic Studies.\n\nZiza Delgado earned her Ph.D. and M.A. in Ethnic Studies from the University of California at Berkeley. Dr. Delgado is currently the Cultural Diversity Coordinator and a professor of Ethnic Studies, History and Urban Education at Glendale Community College (GCC). In 2017 she developed the first certificate degree in Restorative Justice for a community college in the nation and co-founded the Restorative Justice Center, a campus program serving formerly incarcerated and system impacted students, at GCC. Dr. Delgado’s research and teaching are dedicated to the study of the history of ethnic studies, race, racism, social movements, education theory and praxis, restorative justice, U.S. history and carceral studies."
