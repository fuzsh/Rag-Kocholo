SUITS AFFECTING THE PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP\n\nCHAPTER 153. CONSERVATORSHIP, POSSESSION, AND ACCESS\n\nSUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSec. 153.001. PUBLIC POLICY. (a) The public policy of this state is to:\n\n(1) assure that children will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the best interest of the child;\n\n(2) provide a safe, stable, and nonviolent environment for the child; and\n\n(3) encourage parents to share in the rights and duties of raising their child after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage.\n\n(b) A court may not render an order that conditions the right of a conservator to possession of or access to a child on the payment of child support.\n\nAdded by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 20, Sec. 1, eff. April 20, 1995. Amended by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 751, Sec. 25, eff. Sept. 1, 1995; Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 787, Sec. 2, eff. Sept. 1, 1999.\n\nSec. 153.002. BEST INTEREST OF CHILD.

April 20, 1995.\n\nSec. 153.003. NO DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX OR MARITAL STATUS. The court shall consider the qualifications of the parties without regard to their marital status or to the sex of the party or the child in determining:\n\n(1) which party to appoint as sole managing conservator;\n\n(2) whether to appoint a party as joint managing conservator; and\n\n(3) the terms and conditions of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.\n\nAdded by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 20, Sec. 1, eff.

A history of sexual abuse includes a sexual assault that results in the other parent becoming pregnant with the child, regardless of the prior relationship of the parents. It is a rebuttable presumption that the appointment of a parent as the sole managing conservator of a child or as the conservator who has the exclusive right to determine the primary residence of a child is not in the best interest of the child if credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern of past or present child neglect, or physical or sexual abuse by that parent directed against the other parent, a spouse, or a child.\n\n(c) The court shall consider the commission of family violence or sexual abuse in determining whether to deny, restrict, or limit the possession of a child by a parent who is appointed as a possessory conservator.\n\n(d) The court may not allow a parent to have access to a child for whom it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that:\n\n(1) there is a history or pattern of committing family violence during the two years preceding the date of the filing of the suit or during the pendency of the suit; or\n\n(2) the parent engaged in conduct that constitutes an offense under Section 21.02, 22.011, 22.021, or 25.02, Penal Code, and that as a direct result of the conduct, the victim of the conduct became pregnant with the parent's child.\n\n(d-1) Notwithstanding Subsection (d), the court may allow a parent to have access to a child if the court:\n\n(1) finds that awarding the parent access to the child would not endanger the child's physical health or emotional welfare and would be in the best interest of the child; and\n\n(2) renders a possession order that is designed to protect the safety and well-being of the child and any other person who has been a victim of family violence committed by the parent and that may include a requirement that:\n\n(A) the periods of access be continuously supervised by an entity or person chosen by the court;\n\n(B) the exchange of possession of the child occur in a protective setting;\n\n(C) the parent abstain from the consumption of alcohol or a controlled substance, as defined by Chapter 481, Health and Safety Code, within 12 hours prior to or during the period of access to the child; or\n\n(D) the parent attend and complete a battering intervention and prevention program as provided by Article 42.141, Code of Criminal Procedure, or, if such a program is not available, complete a course of treatment under Section 153.010.\n\n(e) It is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interest of a child for a parent to have unsupervised visitation with the child if credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern of past or present child neglect or abuse or family violence by:\n\n(1) that parent; or\n\n(2) any person who resides in that parent's household or who is permitted by that parent to have unsupervised access to the child during that parent's periods of possession of or access to the child.\n\n(f) In determining under this section whether there is credible evidence of a history or pattern of past or present child neglect or abuse or family violence by a parent or other person, as applicable, the court shall consider whether a protective order was rendered under Chapter 85, Title 4, against the parent or other person during the two-year period preceding the filing of the suit or during the pendency of the suit.\n\n(g) In this section:\n\n(1) \"Abuse\" and \"neglect\" have the meanings assigned by Section 261.001.\n\n(2) \"Family violence\" has the meaning assigned by Section 71.004.\n\nAdded by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 20, Sec. 1, eff.

April 20, 1995.\n\nSec. 153.007. AGREED PARENTING PLAN.

If the parties do not submit a revised parenting plan satisfactory to the court, the court may, after notice and hearing, order a parenting plan that the court finds to be in the best interest of the child.\n\nAdded by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 20, Sec. 1, eff. April 20, 1995. Amended by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 751, Sec. 26, eff. Sept. 1, 1995.\n\nAmended by:\n\nActs 2005, 79th Leg., Ch. 482 (H.B. 252), Sec. 3, eff.

After an objection is filed, the suit may not be referred to mediation unless, on the request of a party, a hearing is held and the court finds that a preponderance of the evidence does not support the objection. If the suit is referred to mediation, the court shall order appropriate measures be taken to ensure the physical and emotional safety of the party who filed the objection. The order shall provide that the parties not be required to have face-to-face contact and that the parties be placed in separate rooms during mediation. This subsection does not apply to suits filed under Chapter 262.\n\n(g) The provisions for confidentiality of alternative dispute resolution procedures under Chapter 154, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, apply equally to the work of a parenting coordinator, as defined by Section 153.601, and to the parties and any other person who participates in the parenting coordination.
