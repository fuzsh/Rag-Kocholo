        "text": "What is Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation?\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a regional economic forum established in 1989 to leverage the growing interdependence of the Asia-Pacific. APEC's 21 members aim to create greater prosperity for the people of the region by promoting balanced, inclusive, sustainable, innovative and secure growth and by accelerating regional economic integration.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nAPEC has 21 members. The word 'economies' is used to describe APEC members because the APEC cooperative process is predominantly concerned with trade and economic issues, with members engaging with one another as economic entities.\n\nAPEC MembersDate of JoiningAustralia6-7 Nov 1989Brunei Darussalam6-7 Nov 1989Canada6-7 Nov 1989Chile11-12 Nov 1994People's Republic of China12-14 Nov 1991Hong Kong, China12-14 Nov 1991Indonesia6-7 Nov 1989Japan6-7 Nov 1989Republic of Korea6-7 Nov 1989Malaysia6-7 Nov 1989Mexico17-19 Nov 1993New Zealand6-7 Nov 1989Papua New Guinea17-19 Nov 1993Peru14-15 Nov 1998The Philippines6-7 Nov 1989Russia14-15 Nov 1998Singapore6-7 Nov 1989Chinese Taipei12-14 Nov 1991Thailand6-7 Nov 1989The United States6-7 Nov 1989Viet Nam14-15 Nov 1998\n\nWhat Does APEC Do?\n\nAPEC ensures that goods, services, investment and people move easily across borders. Members facilitate this trade through faster customs procedures at borders; more favorable business climates behind the border; and aligning regulations and standards across the region. For example, APEC's initiatives to synchronize regulatory systems are key to integrating the Asia-Pacific economy. In such cases, a product can be more easily exported with just one set of common standards across all economies.\n\nSustainable and Inclusive Asia-Pacific\n\nAPEC works to help all residents of the Asia-Pacific participate in the growing economy. For example, APEC projects provide digital skills training for rural communities and help indigenous women export their products. Recognizing the impacts of climate change, APEC members implement initiatives to increase energy efficiency and promote sustainable management of forest and marine resources.\n\nThe forum adapts to allow members to deal with important new challenges to the region's economic well-being. This includes ensuring disaster resilience, planning for pandemics, and addressing terrorism.\n\nAPEC's 21 member economies are Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Chile; People's Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Mexico; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; Peru; The Philippines; The Russian Federation; Singapore; Chinese Taipei; Thailand; United States of America; and Viet Nam.\n\nAPEC Process\n\nAPEC: Cooperation and Consensus\n\nAPEC operates as a cooperative, multilateral economic and trade forum. Member economies participate on the basis of open dialogue and respect for views of all participants. In APEC, all economies have an equal say and decision-making is reached by consensus. There are no binding commitments or treaty obligations. Commitments are undertaken on a voluntary basis and capacity building projects help members implement APEC initiatives.\n\nAPEC's structure is based on both a \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" approach. Four core committees and their respective working groups provide strategic policy recommendations to APEC leaders and ministers who annually set the vision for overarching goals and initiatives. The working groups are then tasked with implementing these initiatives through a variety of APEC-funded projects. Members also take individual and collective actions to carry out APEC initiatives in their individual economies with the assistance of APEC capacity building projects.\n\nAPEC Capacity Building Projects\n\nCapacity building projects play an important role in helping translate APEC's goals into reality. By enhancing members' capacity through skills training and technological know-how, APEC-funded projects strengthen members' readiness to adopt new initiatives from electronic customs processing to regulatory reform. APEC projects also target specific policy areas from enhancing small and medium enterprise competitiveness to facilitating the adoption of renewable energy technologies in the region.\n\nThe APEC Project Management Unit oversees APEC-funded projects in collaboration with working groups. Funding for projects is made possible by contributions from APEC members.\n\nThe APEC Policy Support Unit provides policy research, analysis and evaluation to assist in the implementation of APEC's agenda.\n\nThe APEC process is supported by a permanent secretariat based in Singapore."
