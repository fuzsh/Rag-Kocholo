We help you reconnect so that you can feel less stress and have better relationships.\n\nResolving unseen patterns\n\nWe teach time-tested mindfulness practices alongside modern neuroscience to reveal and resolve the unseen patterns that keep people disconnected from their purpose and stuck.\n\nA proven program\n\nWe combine personalized one-on-one coaching with mindfulness training developed over years of coaching everyone from business leaders to stay-at-home moms. Youâ€™ll develop knowledge and skills that you can take into any situation.\n\nHolistic\n\nWe help people strike a balance between work, life and spirit so that they feel whole, happy and purposeful.\n\nBrief but deep engagements\n\nOur programs are less than six months in length; we get to the heart of the issue quickly. During this time the work is very introspective and focused.\n\nMind/Body experts\n\nWe have strong and deep backgrounds in helping people apply mind/body practices to their lives."
