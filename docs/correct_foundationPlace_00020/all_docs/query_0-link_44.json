        "text": "Through our community investments, we support the advancement of community leaders, community organizations and community networks.\n\nFor most grants, our team will approach an organization directly to invite them to submit a grant proposal. Throughout the year we also review unsolicited grant proposals that align to our giving areas. Our grants are unrestricted for general operating purposes to help expand an organizations’ mission and ability to do their important work. Our funding primarily supports organizations in Baltimore as well as in Colorado Springs, San Francisco and New York that have an approved nonprofit status [Internal Revenue Service 501(c)(3) sections 509(a)(1), 509(a)(2) and qualifying 509(a)(3) supporting organizations] or that are fiscally sponsored by a 501(c)(3) public charity.\n\nThe following steps outline the grant making process:\n\nIf you’re new to working with us, please answer a few questions to see if your work and our giving areas align.\n\nDownload a preview of the Foundation's standard grant application for reference."
