        "text": "Great Place To WorkÂ® has been surveying employees around the world about their workplace experiences for 30 years. We have developed a set of themes and metrics that not only reveal whether employees feel their workplace is great, but also predict retention, agility, and overall business success.\n\nUsing our proprietary Trust Indexâ„¢ survey, we measure the core of what we know creates great workplaces â€” key behaviors that drive trust in management, connection with colleagues, and loyalty to the company.\n\nThe survey enables employees to share confidential quantitative and qualitative feedback about their organizationâ€™s culture by responding to 60 statements on a five-point scale and answering two open-ended questions.\n\nEmployees tell us whether or not leaders are accessible, if they communicate honestly and clearly, and if their actions match their words. They tell us if they feel respected as individuals, if they receive support for their well-being and personal development, and if they have opportunities to contribute, and appreciation for their work. They tell us whether they believe their company is fair related to pay, profits, promotions, recognition, favoritism, and opportunities for growth. They tell us if they are proud of their work, their team, and their company, if they feel they make a difference, and if their work is meaningful. And they tell us if they enjoy the people they work with, if they feel cared for, and if they can be themselves.\n\nList rankings are based on this employee feedback, which we analyze to determine the extent to which this experience is shared by the full workforce. Great Place To Work measures the differences in survey responses across demographic groups and roles within each organization to assess both the quality and consistency of the employee experience. Statements are weighted according to their relevance in describing the most important aspects of an equitable workplace.\n\nThe best companies create great work experiences not just for full-time managers, but also for their part-time employees on the front lines, for those whoâ€™ve just joined and those whoâ€™ve spent their whole career there, for every race and ethnicity, gender, neurotype, or other demographic in the organization â€“ we look at it all. Companies with the broadest set of employees who report positive workplace experience receive the highest rankings on lists.\n\nIn order to analyze employee feedback in context, we collect information from each company including their industry, revenue, size, and employee demographics. We identify the organizations that offer the most generous, caring and innovative cultures reflecting a genuine commitment to meet the diversity of their peopleâ€™s needs inside and outside the workplace as validated by what employees themselves report in survey results.\n\nBecause employee feedback drives these rankings, surveys must meet strict requirements for how they are distributed and the percentage of employees who respond to ensure they accurately represent honest feedback from the companyâ€™s full population. To be eligible for the Fortune Best Workplaces in the Bay Area list, companies must be Great Place to Work-Certifiedâ„¢ and must have 10 or more employees in the U.S. They must also be headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area. Companies with 10 to 999 people are considered for the small and medium category; companies with 1,000 employees or more are considered for the large category. Companies appearing on Fortuneâ€™s 100 Best Companies to Work For list rank at the top.\n\nIn the last year, Great Place To Work surveyed companies employing 7.5 million people in the U.S. and received 1.3 million survey responses. Of those, nearly 100,000 responses were received from employees at companies who were eligible for the 2023 Fortune Best Workplaces in the Bay Area list and this list is based on their feedback."
