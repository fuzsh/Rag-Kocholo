In 1966, Jerry began his lifelong career working in construction. His uncle, Grant Haug, got him started in his construction career. He worked for various companies until 1989. At that point, he partnered with Arvid Nelson to form A&N Contractors. Over the 16 years of the business, they remodeled and built many of the houses and businesses in Hawley and surrounding communities.\n\nJerry was an avid sportsman. He loved spending time hunting and fishing with friends and family. Jerry loved snowmobiling and was part of a snowmobiling club.
