        "text": "Sylvia Anderson, who voiced Lady Penelope on “Thunderbirds” and co-created the series, died on Wednesday. She was 88.\n\nHer official website announced the writer, actress and producer died following a short illness at her home in Bray, Buckinghamshire in England.\n\n“Her intelligence was phenomenal, but her creativity and tenacity unchallenged. She was a force in every way,” her daughter, Dee Anderson, said in a statement.\n\nAnderson, who co-created “Thunderbirds” with her late husband Gerry, also served as head of programming for HBO in the U.K.\n\nThe original “Thunderbirds” ran for one season between 1965 and 1966, but inspired several feature-length films about the family that operated a unique private mechanized emergency response service. Most recently, Amazon ordered four seasons of a reboot called “Thunderbirds Are Go.”\n\nSylvia is survived by Dee, a singer-songwriter who was collaborating with her mother on a TV series called “The Last Station,” as well as her son Gerry Anderson Junior. She has four grandchildren and one great granddaughter."
