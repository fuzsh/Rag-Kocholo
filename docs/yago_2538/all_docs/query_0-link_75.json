        "text": "Thunderbirds co-creator Sylvia Anderson, best known for voicing Lady Penelope in the popular TV show, has died aged 88.\n\nA producer and writer, Ms Anderson created the Supermarionation puppet series with husband Gerry.\n\nShe died at her home in Bray, Berkshire, England, following a short illness, her daughter Dee Anderson confirmed.\n\n“Sylvia was a mother and a legend — her intelligence was phenomenal but her creativity and tenacity unchallenged,” her daughter said.\n\n“She was a force in every way, and will be sadly missed.”\n\nGerry Anderson died in 2012 aged 83 after suffering with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAs well as voicing Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward in Thunderbirds from its debut in 1965 until 1968, Sylvia also worked on Joe 90, Captain Scarlet and Stingray.\n\nPA"
