        "text": "Gerry Anderson, one of Northern Ireland's best-known presenters, has died aged 69 following a long illness.\n\nIn a career spanning 30 years, he hosted radio and TV programmes for BBC Northern Ireland, BBC Radio Ulster, BBC Radio Foyle and BBC Radio 4.\n\nBBC Director General Tony Hall said he was a \"distinctive and iconic voice\".\n\n\"That he was inducted into the UK Radio Academy Hall of Fame speaks volumes of how special and unique a broadcaster and personality he was,\" he said.\n\nGerry Anderson started working as a radio presenter in 1984 and went on to become a household name in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe pair's comic bickering and banter became a constant feature of their morning phone-in show.\n\nMr Coyle said it had been \"an absolute pleasure to work with Gerry\".\n\n\"He always brought a smile to my face and I had the ability to do the same to him,\" he said.\n\n\"In 30 years of working together, there was never a cross word spoken. I knew him so well. It just hasn't sunk in yet.\"\n\nIrish country singer Daniel O'Donnell, a frequent guest on the programme and the subject of many Coyle impersonations, said his family had lost a \"very, very incredible person\".\n\n\"I got to know Gerry very early in my career,\" he said.\n\n\"Somebody told me, 'your record was on the radio and the man playing the record put a rooster on just after you'd started to sing'. From there on the banter began.\n\n\"There's a great sadness in Gerry's passing, Isn't it strange that there's a smile on everybody's tribute to him? There's a laugh with the sadness.\"\n\nAnderson also made a number of TV series and documentaries for BBC Northern Ireland, and had a brief spell in London as a presenter on BBC Radio Four.\n\nHis Radio Four show received hostile reviews and marked a low point for the presenter, both personally and professionally, but he continued to make award-winning programmes for BBC Northern Ireland.\n\nDescribing him as a \"true legend of the industry\", the director of BBC Northern Ireland, Peter Johnston, said his BBC colleagues and many listeners would miss him.\n\n\"This is a day of great sadness for everyone at Radio Foyle, Radio Ulster and BBC Northern Ireland, and of course our thoughts are with Gerry's wife and family,\" he said.\n\n\"Gerry was a man of great wit and mischief, but he also brought great wisdom and insight to what he did.\n\n\"Of course, he'll be sadly missed by all of us, but also by all his loyal listeners, for whom he often brought light on dark days over the decades.\n\n\"I think in Gerry's case - it's often said lightly, but in his case truly - I don't think we'll ever see his like again.\"\n\nHis friend and fellow broadcaster, Gerry Kelly, said he was \"one of the most innovative and clever broadcasters\" he had ever known and would be sorely missed.\n\nMickey Bradley, a member of the Undertones who worked with the late broadcaster in BBC Radio Foyle said Gerry Anderson \"broke the mould\".\n\n\"He was very funny off-air as he was on-air,\" Mr Bradley said.\n\n\"Every morning he was never in the studio earlier than two minutes before the programme started and, of course, many times he was late for his own show.\"\n\nGerry Anderson is survived by his wife Christine, his children David and Kirsty and his two grandchildren Sarah and Thomas.\n\nDescribing him as a \"beautiful and loving husband\", Christine Anderson said Gerry Anderson had \"touched the hearts and lives of all who knew him and who followed him\".\n\nShe added: \"I have been overwhelmed with the love expressed for Gerry, even in the few short hours since he passed away.\n\n\"I always knew that Gerry was hugely popular. His humour, intellect, creativity and talent made him a great broadcaster.\"\n\nMrs Anderson said he had been \"the most courageous and best friend anyone could ever have\", and that the Anderson family were \"immensely proud\" of how he had dealt with his illness.\n\n\"He will always be an inspiration to us all,\" she said.\n\n\"As a family, David, Kirsty and I are heartbroken but we know the prayers, good wishes and love of the public will help sustain us at this terrible time.\"\n\nMrs Anderson said she understood people would want to \"show their love and appreciation for Gerry in a public way\", but asked that people respect the family's privacy in the coming days.\n\nGerry Anderson's funeral will take place on Sunday at 11:00 BST at St Eugene's Cathedral in Derry.\n\nMourners are invited to attend to pay their respects, or donations can be made to the Foyle Hospice in lieu of flowers."
