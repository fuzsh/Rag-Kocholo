        "meta_description": "Gerry Anderson's career spanned 60 years, and he created and produced some of the world's most beloved children's television series including Thunderbirds, Stingray, Captain Scarlet, Space:1999, Terrahawks, Space Precinct and many more, some with his then-wife Sylvia. Released a decade after his death, this incredibly revealing, emotionally charged and deeply personal documentary will draw on exclusive access to over 30 hours of previously unpublished interviews, in order to share the untold stories that defined his life and body of work. In a fitting tribute to the technical pioneer, and with permission from his youngest son Jamie, A Life Uncharted will use artificial intelligence to bring Gerry to life via a 'deep fake' simulation, allowing him to candidly share his story with fans on screen. With additional interviews and commentary from friends, family, fans and colleagues, viewers will bear witness to a revealing look back through Gerry Anderson's life, from a poverty-stricken childhood at the hands of warring parents, charting the previously undisclosed story of his journey to becoming the legendary creator whose legacy still inspires and entertains to this day.",
