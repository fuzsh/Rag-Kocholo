        "text": "Gerry Anderson: A Life Uncharted is a documentary that focuses specifically on the man, rather than the shows that he created. If you are more interested in the latter then you would be better off watching Filmed in Supermarionation (2014), which provides a comprehensive overview of all productions, wrapped in a cosy blanket of nostalgia and fandom. Gerry Anderson: A Life Uncharted offers a more challenging viewing experience due to its honesty and candour. Gerry Anderson had a difficult childhood and suffered a bereavement early in life. During the course of this 88 minute exploration of his life it becomes clear that these traumas both drove his creativity as well as marred his own personal life. Furthermore, this documentary is also about a son looking for answers, as Jamie Anderson attempts to learn more about his father’s past.\n\nGerry Anderson was born Gerald Alexander Abrahams in 1929. His secular Mother Deborah was frequently at odds with her Jewish husband Joseph and hence Gerry’s most formative years were blighted by the acrimonious and dysfunctional marriage of his parents. He was also subject to antisemitic abuse during his early school days which eventually led to his mother changing his surname by deed poll. Gerry idolised his older brother Lionel and always felt in his shadow. When Lionel died in a plane crash during World war II, Gerry was devastated. Needless to say these emotional issues both motivated and plagued him throughout his life. Gerry strove to escape the poverty of his youth and be successful. His scripts often featured strong father figures and absent mothers. His workaholic nature meant he often became estranged from his own family. He also struggled to maintain friendships beyond business.\n\nGerry Anderson: A Life Uncharted offers a broad spectrum of views and opinions. There is both old and new archive footage of Gerry talking quite candidly about his relationship with his parents, his failings as a parent and the deterioration of his marriage to Sylvia. It doesn’t always make for comfortable viewing but it is very credible and human. Contrary views are also aired from those who worked with him such as Roberta Leigh and three of his four children contribute in an equally candid fashion. From Gerry’s perspective, despite all his hard work he never seemed to reconcile himself to his success. He also felt that Sylvia over-stated her contribution to the success of AP Films and Century 21 and it is clear that he felt taken advantage of. Despite becoming successful and then subsequently losing it all, he eventually found happiness and stability with his third marriage to Mary Robbins.\n\nA key part of Gerry Anderson: A Life Uncharted is its focus on Gerry’s struggle with dementia during the last few years of his life. It is a very personal account recounted from the perspective of son Jamie and mother and wife Mary. It will resonate with anyone who has first hand experience of a loved one succumbing to this condition and many of the anecdotes recounted will have a familiar ring to them. Yet despite the difficulty of dealing with such a debilitating illness, it is fascinating how Gerry managed to use his fame to raise public awareness, as well as £1 million for the Alzheimer's Society in a year. Tragically, when he finally passed away on Boxing Day 2012, Gerry had no memory of his life work or its popularity.\n\nGerry Anderson: A Life Uncharted takes a gamble by using deep fake technology in order to bring Gerry Anderson back to the screen, thus making the audio interviews more accessible. What viewers are presented with are a series of black and white scenes of Gerry sitting on a sofa talking to an interviewer off camera. The documentary clearly states its use before it begins and its inclusion does not in any way invalidate the authenticity or relevance of the actual audio interviews. Overall, if you wish to understand what drove Gerry Anderson to be so creative and successful, then Gerry Anderson: A Life Uncharted offers some insight. It also clearly shows the human cost as well. Fans who idolise their heroes may be uncomfortable with Gerry’s open admission of his own personal failings. Those with a capacity to separate their feelings of fandom from their curiosity will be rewarded with an engaging and somewhat melancholic documentary. Just bear in mind that some facts presented remain disputed and that this is documentary is weighted towards Gerry Anderson’s perspective."
