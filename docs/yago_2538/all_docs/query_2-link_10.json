        "text": "Gerry Anderson MBE[1] (14th April, 1929 - 26th December, 2012), born Gerald Alexander Abrahams in Kilburn, North London,[2] was a British producer, director and writer who became famous for his futuristic television programmes, particularly those involving the super-marionation process of specially modified marionettes.\n\nMarried for years to the former Sylvia Thomas, better known by her married name of Sylvia Anderson, he sired at least one son, Gerry Jnr, by her. The acrimony of their divorce in the 1970s led him to refer to her, invariably with undisguised hostility, as \"that woman\" for the rest of his years.\n\nHe died on 26 December, 2012, of dementia at the age of 83. At his death, he left behind a legacy of futuristic story-telling that would continue to outlive him. His work continued through Jamie Anderson, his son by Mary Anderson."
