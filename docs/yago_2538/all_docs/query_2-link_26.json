        "text": "A true gem of a documentary for die-hard fans of the creator of a wide variety of TV shows and movies featuring miniatures and puppets.\n\nGerry Anderson etched his mark in our culture with his innovative puppet work and miniatures. With his steadfast dedication in using those things toward producing a wide but distinctive variety of shows, he will be remembered by generations around the world.\n\nThere have already been more than a few specials concerning the development (his invention of \"SuperMarionation\") and production and reception of his various shows such as \"The Thunderbirds\", \"Space 1999\", \"UFO\", etc.\n\nThe topic which this documentary reveals for the first time, to my knowledge, are various personal difficulties Anderson had in his life, and how those difficulties probably inspired his creative choices throughout his career.\n\nFor fans of his work, I would consider this as \"must viewing\".\n\nThe editors of this video, however, have seen fit to persist in cutting in clips and phrases from his shows / puppets, etc which, IMO, don't have anything to do with what was being discussed, either in subject or tone. Seeming to echo an old radio trick which is done for humorous effect, these clips only detract from the underlying story which is not funny.\n\nIf those clips were scenes or even the shows being discussed at the time, then the clips would have been relevant, but as they were used, they were a needless distraction, subtracting a point from my review."
