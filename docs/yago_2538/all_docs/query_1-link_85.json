        "text": "A message at the start of Gerry Anderson: A Life Uncharted (BritBox) explains that new footage of the Thunderbirds and Stingray creator has been generated “with artificial intelligence known as Deep Fake”. The producer and director who devoted his career to fantastical puppetry has become a sort of fantastical puppet himself.\n\nThis feels a strange way to tell Anderson’s story. And unnecessary too, as the fake Anderson doesn’t turn up until the end when the simulacrum walks over a bridge at the cemetery in the Netherlands where his brother is buried. Is it a bizarre attempt at homage – TV’s ultimate puppet-master transformed into computer-generated marionette? Or did ITV, which produced the documentary for BritBox, simply fancy trying out its new technology on the sly?\n\nHappily, the “Deep Fake” fakery is generally noticeable by its absence over the course of this more-or-less conventional feature-length documentary. It traces Anderson’s life from his unhappy childhood in London to his tempestuous marriage to Thunderbirds collaborator Sylvia Thomas (they parted on such bad terms, on the night of the wrap party for Space: 1999, that he went on to model a latex villain on her) and his descent late in life into dementia.\n\nA Life Uncharted is framed as a personal journey by Jamie Anderson, youngest of Anderson’s four children, who begins by says he never really knew his father, who passed away on Boxing Day 2012 aged 83. By the end, as he walks across that bridge in the Netherlands, followed by a CGI version of his dad, he says he has gained a deeper understanding. But viewers may not feel likewise – at least not so far as Anderson’s work is concerned.\n\nAnderson is revealed to be a flawed maverick – a loyal son to dysfunctional parents, a unfaithful husband to the first of his three wives, a cold-hearted colleague who dropped friends and business partners as soon as they ceased to be of use. Alas, the film sheds little light on his creative instincts: landmark sci-fi series such as Joe 90 and Space: 1999 – the Marvel movies of their day – are referenced largely in passing and only in so far as they impacted on Anderson’s personal life. Thunderbirds are no.\n\nAnderson’s love of derring-do and of magnificent flying machines was, we are told, inspired by his dashing older sibling, Lionel, who joined the RAF at the start of the Second World War and was sent for training to Thunderbirds Field airbase in Arizona (the name would stick with Anderson). Lionel was shot down over Arnhem aged 22, leading Gerry to observe, “My brother was the one who should have lived. I would have happily swapped places with him”.\n\nBut there is almost nothing about the the creative process behind Thunderbirds – aside from the fact that constant on-set squabbling with Sylvia, his wife and collaborator, sounded a death-knell for the marriage. Many juicy details are glossed over. Sylvia, for instance, was dead against husband-and-wife Martin Landau and Barbara Bain playing the leads in Space: 1999, a casting insisted on by Anderson’s ally at Associated Television, Lew Grade. Nor can space be found in the 93-minute running time to mention that Anderson prepared legal proceedings against James Bond producer Albert Broccoli after his initial treatment for an adaptation of Ian Fleming’s Moonraker was rejected.\n\nAnderson fans will regard such omissions as a missed opportunity. We do learn that Anderson was inspired to create Thunderbirds’s International Rescue by an operation to recover flooded miners in Germany. And that the absence of maternal figures in his television stemmed from a troubled relationship with his mother.\n\nSadly, that’s as far as the film goes in exploring Thunderbirds and its legacy. Were Anderson’s shows regarded as cutting edge for their time? Have his trademark puppets, with their huge eyebrows and wobbly heads, aged well? How much wealth did he accrue as hit followed hit? These questions are not answered. They aren’t even asked.\n\nAs a portrait of a driven, eccentric individual, A Life Uncharted is more satisfying. Anderson was clearly a Marmite character, who could provoke both enormous loathing and great affection.\n\n“A very evil man,” said his early patron Roberta Leigh. His daughter Joy says they were so estranged that when she turned up at a book signing he didn’t recognise her. “He found it very hard to make friends,” says third wife Mary. “He just didn’t see the value of maintaining good relationships with people.”\n\nHe could be kind, too. As his father lay dying in hospital, Gerry arranged for a television to be wheeled in so that his dad could watch the first episode of Thunderbirds. And his work has, of course, fired the imaginations of generations of children. However, those professional accomplishments are side-stepped in favour of delving into Anderson’s idiosyncrasies and into the demons that haunted him from childhood – his parents were a poor match and rowed constantly – and which were exacerbated by Lionel’s death.\n\nThe story is a riveting one. Yet it’s hard not to conclude that this profile is obsessed to a fault with Anderson the private person while giving short shrift to Anderson the on-screen miracle worker."
