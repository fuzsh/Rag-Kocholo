        "text": "Sixty years ago a generation of kids spent Saturday mornings battling underwater aliens and policing the Earth’s Oceans with the crew of a futuristic nuclear-powered combat submarine called Stingray.\n\nA forerunner of the iconic 1960s sci-fi shows Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlett and Space: 1999, Stingray – which turns 60 this year - was the first of the children’s TV shows using electronic puppets.\n\nAnd this wasn’t its only TV first.\n\nIt was the very first British television series to be filmed in colour and the first with a main character in a wheelchair.\n\nCommander Sam Shore - a paraplegic who had lost his legs in a submarine accident - was only mobile because of his specially-designed hoverchair.\n\nStingray also featured a non-verbal and tail-less mermaid called Marina, who the crew had rescued from the underwater alien city of Titanica. She remained silent through all 39 episodes of the series, first shown on ITV from October 4, 1964, to June 27, 1965.\n\nStingray and the subsequent sci-fi puppet shows were the brainchild of husband-and-wife duo Gerry and Sylvia Anderson.\n\nThey coined the term ‘Supermarionation’ to describe the technique of using puppets with electric moving parts.\n\nFilmed two episodes at a time in a huge studio space in Slough, Stingray cost £1 million to make, which is equivalent to £20.7 million today.\n\nGerry Anderson, who died in 2012, aged 83, after battling Alzheimer’s, said it was inspired by his memories of U-boats in World War II, which claimed the life of his much-loved brother, Lionel.\n\nGerry’s son Jamie, 39, is now the brains behind an epic multi-platform resurrection and celebration of Stingray, to mark its 60th.\n\nCelebrations will include a symphony concert and four new books which will bring Stingray alive for a new generation.\n\nThe only child of Gerry and third wife Mary, Jamie has fond memories of all his dad’s shows.\n\nHe recalls seeing the Thunderbirds puppets in his Oxfordshire home as a child, although his dad was then making new shows, so the Lady Penelope and Parker puppets were hanging in the closet in black bin liners.\n\nHe also recalls how the voice of Arthur, the wine waiter in the Kings Arms in Cookham, near Maidenhead, where his mum and dad met, inspiring the clipped tones of Aloysius Parker, Lady Penelope’s chauffeur in Thunderbirds.\n\nAnd he remembers his mum telling him that his dad had made the shows he was watching on videos as a youngster.\n\nHe tells The Mirror: “I was probably four, maybe five, and was pulling a video out of the VHS case to put it in the player when mum said, ‘you know, your father made those.’\n\n“As a kid, you have no concept of what goes into making TV, so I thought she literally meant he had printed out the VHS cover and put the tape in the box.”\n\nIt dawned on Jamie that his dad might be “someone” when the BBC licensed some of his shows in the early 1990s and Gerry started being invited onto current children’s programmes that Jamie and his friends watched to talk about the iconic productions.\n\n“I started to realise it a bit more, especially after the BBC licensed Thunderbirds in 1991, because, after that, everything blew up,” he says.\n\n“My friends started bringing these annuals from the sixties and seventies that belonged to their parents to school and would ask me to take them home and get my dad to sign them. So, there was this sudden sense that somehow my dad was cool.\n\n“But my dad was the world’s least nostalgic human being. People think if you’re the son of Gerry Anderson then you must have grown up with the puppets everywhere but that wasn’t the case.\n\n“As far as he was concerned, once a show was done, it was done, and he was on to the next one. Also, he was a perfectionist, so when he’d finish something he’d look back, and all he could see were the mistakes.”\n\nWhile he was a boundary pushing filmmaker, Jamie remembers Gerry as an over-protective dad.\n\n“He did that sort of cotton wool parenting because he was scared that I’d hurt myself.\n\nHe didn’t even want me to ride a bike,” he says.\n\nThis led to clashes in Jamie’s teens, as his dad forbade him from following him into TV production.\n\n“He told me the industry was full of arseholes and if I tried to get into it, he would make sure every door was slammed in my face,” he says\n\nInstead, Jamie studied science and briefly worked in horse breeding, but then found his way into graphic design and moved back home to help his mother care for his ailing father when his dementia was first diagnosed.\n\n“My father never wanted to stop working and so right until his illness stopped him, he was working with me on a book,” he recalls.\n\nBy the end of his life, Gerry regretted telling Jamie to stay out of the family business which is why he has spent the past decade rebuilding the brand.\n\nHe says: ”I heard it as a tacit approval and permission now to do so. And so when Dad died, I felt able to pick up that battle and run with it.”\n\nJamie established Anderson Entertainment, which will celebrate Stingray’s landmark anniversary, with a variety of engaging projects and offerings this year.\n\nWith no active production since 2005, Gerry Anderson’s name and the shows were all ripe for resurrection in a world where websites and social media now provide easy connection points for fans, old and new.\n\n“When he died, we were looking at a deceased figurehead and a deceased brand because we had none of those connection points,” says Jamie. “There was no website or hub that tied everything together.”\n\nOne of the key things Anderson Entertainment celebrates is the deeply emotional connections those iconic TV shows made with their young viewers in a world that can now feel lost in time.\n\n“I’ve met some fascinating people thanks to my dad’s work,” says Jamie. “I met a big burly biker, covered in tattoos with a big beard and piercings, with a big booming voice, who told me that for his whole childhood he was bounced from foster home to foster home, suffering from abuse at some of them.\n\n“He said the only thing that kept him going was Captain Scarlet, because he was a man who always came back and when he told me that, he broke down.\n\n“I’ve also had people tell me they went to work for NASA because they watched these shows as kids.”\n\nAnderson Entertainment has spent 18 months working on the 2024 celebration programme for Stingray.\n\nThunderbirds will turn 60 next year and Space:1999 will be 50 the following year, giving the Stingray phrase ‘Standby for action’ a whole new meaning, as Gerry Anderson’s legacy is reborn for today’s global audience."
