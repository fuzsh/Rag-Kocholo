        "text": "Gerry Anderson, a British filmmaker who transformed old-fashioned puppets into futuristic action heroes in the 1960s in the hugely popular children’s show “Thunderbirds,” and later cast real people in series including “U.F.O.” and “Space: 1999,” died on Wednesday in Oxfordshire, England. He was 83.\n\nHis death followed a diagnosis two years ago of dementia, according to an announcement on the Web site of his son Jamie.\n\nAs a filmmaker in the 1950s, Mr. Anderson dreamed of directing sweeping dramas, but he would make his name working in miniature. “Supermarionation,” he called it, merging the words super, marionette and animation to describe this new puppetry for the television age, one with skinnier strings and broader ambitions.\n\n“Thunderbirds are go!” a voice pronounced in the opening sequence of “Thunderbirds.” The series, about an international rescue team, made its debut in 1965 and eventually included 32 hourlong episodes. A generation of British children was in thrall.\n\nScott Tracy, strong in the jaw and cool in the captain’s chair, led the pilots. Brains, the eccentric genius, stammered but always found a solution. The glamorous Lady Penelope (whose voice was provided by Sylvia Anderson, Mr. Anderson’s wife) cruised in the back of her chauffeured convertible. The Hood, with his evil arched eyebrows and cone-domed skull, never gave up but never won.\n\nMore was expected of the imagination back then, of course. Facial expressions were limited and it was rare to see a puppet strolling across the screen. Marionettes were not known for realistic gaits.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
