        "text": "It’s Sunday lunchtime in our front room and I’m impatiently waiting for Brian Walden to stop talking to Ted Heath so that I can see how International Rescue will get to grips with a giant alligator.\n\nAnd it’s not just me. My friend John and our plumber, whose ringtone played the Fireball XL5 theme, would be green with envy. Forty-odd years on, here I am taking tea with “Lady Penelope” in her riverside home, a scone’s throw from Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire.\n\nEven our photographer is excited. Let’s face it: this is the kind of brand loyalty multi-nationals would kill for.\n\nThat she’s part of a great many people’s childhood is clearly something of which she is enormously proud. She is particularly chuffed that her six-year-old grandson is a fan. “He adores Alan and all the characters... and he hasn’t been told to sit down and watch them,” she laughs.\n\nOne of the true pioneers of women in television, Sylvia stumbled into it almost by accident. After graduating from the London School of Economics, her eye was caught by an advert for a Girl Friday at a fledgling film company.\n\nWith no experience but bags of enthusiasm she was taken on, quickly learning every aspect of film production. Having cut their teeth on commercials and documentaries, she and a handful of colleagues, including her future husband Gerry, formed their own company. Initially working on another writer’s puppet films they later decided to produce their own.\n\nAs their ambitions grew, thanks to the patronage of TV impresario Lew Grade, so did their budgets. The result was a filming technique called Supermarionation used to produce hits including Stingray, Captain Scarlet, Joe 90 and topped by the insanely entertaining Thunderbirds.\n\n“Lew Grade was a one-off,” says Sylvia of the man who brought a dash of Hollywood to British television. She and Gerry would occasionally accompany him to America and witnessed his selling technique. “He’d walk in to the head of the studio or whatever and compliment him on his tie and suddenly do the Charleston! They absolutely loved him.”\n\nThe couple married in 1960 and for two decades the partnership of Gerry and Sylvia was a golden one. Together they would co-create and co-write the first episode of a proposed new series, then Gerry would specialise in the effects and the hardware, while Sylvia concentrated on character.\n\n“We had around us a fantastic team of people who were very talented and didn’t really know how talented they were,” says Sylvia. “We managed to get that together on a very little amount of money. I’ve never looked down on what we did, but I must emphasise the teamwork. No one person does everything.”\n\nWhat did limit them, however, was running time. “Each time I was frustrated because I couldn’t do a back story,” says Sylvia. Once again Lew came to the rescue and indulged her. “The hour-long show made all the difference. With Thunderbirds we were beginning to be film-makers.”\n\nAudiences may have loved Brains and the Tracy brothers but it was the uber-cool Lady Penelope who really fired the imagination of the public and press. On the first day of shooting, hordes of reporters descended on Slough trading estate where the series was filmed, mainly wanting to speak to Lady Penelope, the convivial and glamorous Sylvia.\n\nThat set a trend and that’s when jealousy raised its ugly head.\n\n“Gerry wasn’t a very social person so if we went anywhere I’d be the one who had to break the ice. I’m much more outgoing. There’s nothing wrong with one of you being outgoing and one of you being quiet so long as the one who is quiet doesn’t start to resent the very thing that drew you together in the first place,” she says.\n\nAnd, as Sylvia points out, once the publicity train starts to roll, you can’t stop it. “Every time we had a new series or a film the reporters would come to me, and however much you try to include that person who’s glowering in the corner, it’s difficult. But we staggered on for a while.”\n\nThe inevitable divorce, fuelled by more press attention, practically redefined acrimonious. Sylvia says Gerry gave interviews that called into question her contribution to the series.\n\n“He started rewriting history.” Again, Sylvia stresses that any success was born out of teamwork. “We were a team but why would I want to take away from what I’d done? And why would I want to take it away from Gerry? I think he was really like a spoilt child.”\n\nSylvia’s daughter, jazz singer Dee Anderson, witnessed her father’s behaviour. “A lot of the time I really did get on with Gerry but he was a very complex person,” she says. “I think he gave Sylvia a very bad time.”\n\nThings came to a head when the company eschewed puppets for live-action films. Power went to Gerry’s head. “Going from puppets to live action made him think, ‘Oh, I really am in the film business’, and he would give interviews absolutely dissing the earlier stuff we’d done. And to me that was so unnecessary because it gave us our start.\n\n“It was a shock when we split up, and I’m not going to go into those details because they’re not very nice, that he couldn’t just go quietly because he was already with someone else and already had another son. I just had to keep quiet. To me it was just such a waste of very good years that we had.”\n\nAnd his resentment stretched across the decades. In 2004, despite his not owning the rights, Working Title tried to involve Gerry in the production of their Thunderbirds feature film.\n\n“They said, ‘We don’t know what to do, Sylvia, we’ve tried to include him but his demands are so great that we can’t do it’. Later, I heard Gerry on the radio saying that he was very upset with them...he told his fans not to praise the film.”\n\nFollowing the divorce, Sylvia became head of production at one of the UK’s first video companies and then spent 30 years as HBO’s London talent scout. Now, more than halfway through her eighth decade, there’s no sign of her slowing down. Not only is she a novelist, she is actively involved with bringing a new TV series, created by her daughter, to the screen.\n\nShe admits her emotions were mixed when she learned of Gerry’s death last Christmas. “We hadn’t spoken for years because he didn’t want to speak; he married a secretary at Pinewood and if he saw me he’d scuttle off into another office. I thought, ‘What a waste, we threw it all away’.\n\n\"But it turned out he was never happy, even after that. I felt worse than I thought I was going to feel because when someone’s alive there’s always hope that they might say, ‘This is all silly’.\n\n“After all, part of it was a very happy time.”\n\nDee Anderson appears at The Pheasantry, King’s Road, Chelsea, on June 11.
