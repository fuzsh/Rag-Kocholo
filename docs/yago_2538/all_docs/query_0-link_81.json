        "text": "The voice of Lady Penelope in the cult 1960s TV series Thunderbirds has died aged 88 following a short illness.\n\nSylvia Anderson co-created the hit puppet show with her late husband Gerry, along with a string of other children's classics, including Stingray and Captain Scarlet.\n\nHer daughter, Dee Anderson, hailed her \"a mother and a legend\", who would be sadly missed.\n\nShe said: \"Her intelligence was phenomenal but her creativity and tenacity unchallenged. She was a force in every way.\"\n\nBorn in London, Sylvia Anderson graduated from the London School of Economics with a degree in economics and sociology before moving to the US.\n\nOn her return to the UK she joined a TV production company, where she met her future husband.\n\nTogether they created Thunderbirds, which featured the futuristic adventures of the Tracy family, who operated International Rescue.\n\nThe ground-breaking show pioneered the technique of 'Supermarionation', which made the puppets' lips move in time with the recorded dialogue.\n\nThe hit series went on to spawn a highly successful franchise, including two feature films and a toy empire.\n\nSylvia provided the aristocratic voice of the Lady Penelope character, which was also based on her own appearance.\n\nThe Andersons' creative collaboration continued up until they separated in 1975. They divorced in 1981.\n\nShe went on to work for the US TV network HBO in the UK and also wrote a number of books, including her autobiography Yes M'Lady.\n\nShe also dedicated time to charity work, including Breast Cancer Care.\n\nShe leaves a daughter, Dee Anderson, a singer and songwriter, and a son, Gerry Anderson Junior, an anaesthetist.\n\nShe also had four grandchildren and one great-granddaughter."
