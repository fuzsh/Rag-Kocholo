        "text": "The wife of legendary broadcaster Gerry Anderson has accepted his induction into the PPI Radio Awards Hall of Fame.\n\nChristine Anderson travelled to Dublin to accept the award posthumously on his behalf.\n\nMr Anderson started his broadcasting career at BBC Northern Ireland 30 years ago, presenting his first programme on BBC Radio Foyle in 1985.\n\nBefore long his popular mid-morning programme was broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Radio Foyle every weekday morning from 10.30am-12pm.\n\nIn the programme Gerry, joined by his ‘side-kick’ Sean Coyle, would share his passion for music while imparting his musings on life and embarking on weird and wonderful conversations with his listeners.\n\nThe much-loved Derry presenter died in August last year.\n\nSpeaking earlier this week, Peter Johnston, Director, BBC Northern Ireland, said: “Gerry was a man of great wit and mischief but also brought real wisdom and insight to everything he did.\n\n\"All of us in BBC Northern Ireland miss Gerry very much, but of course he is most missed by his family and his adoring and loyal fans.\n\n\"This recognition from the PPI is a fitting tribute to a true legend of our industry - something which is often said lightly but is genuinely true of Gerry.”\n\nFergus Keeling, Head of Radio, BBC Northern Ireland, said: “Gerry was possibly the cleverest man I've ever known. He was naturally funny and had an incomparable style of broadcasting.\n\n\"His charm, his wicked wit and his searing insights on life endeared him to us and of course his thousands of listeners. This award pays homage to the man who will be remembered fondly for making us laugh every day at ourselves and this funny world we live in.”\n\nMORE: Legendary broadcaster Gerry Anderson inducted into PPI Radio Awards Hall of Fame"
