        "text": "Fanderson is saddened to report the death of Dr Gerry Anderson, Gerry and Sylvia’s son.\n\nDr Gerry Anderson was the only son of Sylvia and Gerry, the legendary husband and wife team of Thunderbirds fame. He was born in Windsor on 31st July 1967 and his parents issued an invitation to the celebration of his birth in the image of a clapper board saying “Proudly presenting Gerry Anderson Jnr” bearing his weight and time of birth.\n\nGerry had been suffering from an incurable brain tumour for a number of years, but prior to that was a renowned anaesthetist, who was headhunted from the UK to New Zealand. He was then offered a prestigious medical consultancy in Tasmania, where he decided to live with his wife and three children.\n\nGerry had taken a different route to his parents and sister Dee Anderson, who were all in the creative arts, as he had always wanted to enter the medical profession. Dee remembers him asking her for a blood pressure monitor as a Christmas present when only 8 and diagnosing medical conditions from an early age.\n\nGerry had many experiences in his medical career before becoming an anaesthetist. One of his favourite memories was when he was a ‘flying doctor’ travelling all over the world to treat the sick and dying. He also set up a medical centre in the middle of a remote area of the Amazon forest where he treated a primitive tribe, alongside two other doctors who were travelling with him. He was always trying to utilise his medical skills to improve people’s lives.\n\nIn later years, Gerry was an exceptional anaesthetist, who had a gentle confidence which was reflected in his work. Many of his patients kept in touch with him years after their treatment, saying he had made a huge impact on them and their hospital experience.\n\nAlthough Dee was several years older than Gerry she shared extraordinary experiences with him when they would spend their holidays on film sets at Pinewood Studios, watching their parents programmes being made like Space:1999 and UFO, and mingled with stars from stage and screen like Cliff Richard, Joan Collins, Shirley Bassey and Des O’Connor, who visited their home in Gerrards Cross or at their villa in Portugal.\n\nGerry was married with three teenage children, Kelsey, Eamear and Max, who gathered around his bedside with his wife Andrea in the last few days of his life.\n\nDr Gerry Anderson was just 55 years old when he passed away on Wednesday 26th April 2023, and although he did not pursue the stage or screen, was really a true star who made a difference as he touched so many people’s lives.\n\nThe following photos are © Sylvia Anderson estate\n\nIt’s just one week until club members will be joining special guests and committee members to celebrate 40 years of the world’s only official appreciation society for Gerry Anderson, Sylvia Anderson and their wonderfully talented teams that made some of our favourite television programmes and films.\n\nWe’d planned to do it in 2021, but Covid-19 and travel restrictions put paid to that!\n\nWe’ll be at the Pinewood Hotel (Wexham Park Lane, George Green, Slough, Buckinghamshire SL3 6AP) from 14:00, where we’ll have a barbecue and, like all good birthday parties, music, drink and (of course) cake! There will also be a cash bar for drinks.\n\nWe’ll even have some surprises to keep you entertained between conversations…\n\nJust bring along your order confirmation to show us when you arrive, and we’ll check you against our guest list. Sorry, there will be no on-the-door admissions.\n\nIt’s a relaxed event, so dress code is casual.\n\nSee you on Saturday!\n\nIt seems quite remarkable now, but Fanderson has been a part of all our lives for 40 years.\n\nIt’s grown from quite humble beginnings, when producer/writer/director Gerry Anderson recognised the need to bring together various disparate groups into a cohesive club for all fans of his work.\n\nNowadays, when many other media-related clubs have closed down, gone online, or been taken over by the production companies involved, we’re a rare breed. A club created and run by fans, for fans.\n\nNow, 41 years later, we’re celebrating this milestone (we’d planned to do it in 2021, but Covid-19 and travel restrictions put paid to that!).\n\n40 FAB Years is not a convention, but a relaxed party. The perfect occasion to catch up with friends you’ve made through Fanderson over the years, and some special guests will be celebrating with us. We’ll have a barbecue and, like all good birthday parties, there’ll be music, drink and (of course) a cake!\n\nWe’ve got space for just 100 Fanderson members to join us at the Pinewood Hotel, a little way down the road from the world famous studios in Buckinghamshire. We’ll be there from 14:00 on Saturday 20th August 2022.\n\nSee more and book your place here.\n\nAs the anniversary of Gerry Anderson’s birthday (14th April) draws near, broadcasters and streaming services in the UK are planning to celebrate!\n\nOn the day itself, BritBox in the UK will offer Gerry Anderson’s Greatest Episodes. This will apparently include Gerry’s favourite ten episodes of his own productions, including linking material by the man himself. The episodes are:\n\nStingray Pilot\n\nThunderbirds Trapped In The Sky\n\nThunderbirds Terror In New York City\n\nThunderbirds Attack Of The Alligators\n\nCaptain Scarlet And The Mysterons The Mysterons\n\nJoe 90 The Most Special Agent\n\nUFO A Question Of Priorities\n\nUFO Reflections In The Water\n\nSpace:1999 Breakaway\n\nSpace:1999 Black Sun\n\nSurprisingly, the selection doesn’t include Gerry and Sylvia’s least known series – The Secret Service – which Gerry had told fans on many occasions was his personal favourite of all his series (and is also available on BritBox). Keen Fanderson members will know that all these episodes have been on BritBox since January, although the linking material will be new to the platform. Normally costing £5.99 per month, if you sign up to BritBox now you get a free 7-day trial.\n\nNetwork Distributing are offering another of their popular Night In experiences from 14th April via their streaming platform. At just over 4½-hours, Gerry Anderson’s Night In includes Supercar False Alarm, Fireball XL5 A Day In The Life Of A Space General, Captain Scarlet And The Mysterons The Inquisition, Joe 90 The Birthday, UFO A Question Of Priorities, Space: 1999 Black Sun, Terrahawks Close Call and New Captain Scarlet Dominion in high-definition (all already available on Blu-ray Disc). Each episode has a special introduction, and special features include “some Supermarionation commercials advertising everything from Sugar Smacks to… er, more Sugar Smacks….”. All for just £4.99 for 7-day access!\n\nThe UK’s Forces TV (Freeview/YouView 96, Freesat 165, Sky 181, and Virgin 274) is inviting UFO fans to choose their favourite episode from the pre-selected shortlist of Mindbender, Sub-Smash, A Question Of Priorities, Reflections In The Water and The Cat With Ten Lives. Voting closed on 10th April. The winning episode will be broadcast at 10pm on 14th April (repeated on 17th April at 9pm), accompanied by some “never before seen on TV” footage including Gerry giving a very special introduction to the winning episode. UFO fans immediately expressed their dismay at the seemingly arbitrary episode selection, which would appear to be geared to those for which it was possible to create an introduction by the man himself.\n\nShout! Factory are also holding a 24-hour marathon of Anderson productions on the day for viewers in territories with the Shout! Factory TV streaming service."
