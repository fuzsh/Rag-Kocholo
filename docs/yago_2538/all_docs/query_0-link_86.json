        "text": "Sylvia Anderson, the co-creator Thunderbirds, has died after a short illness, aged 88.\n\nAnderson was also the original voice of Lady Penelope and co-created the hit series with her late husband Gerry.\n\nHer daughter has confirmed that she died at her home in Bray, Berkshire.\n\nDee Anderson said she was \"a mother and a legend\", who would be sadly missed.\n\n\"Her intelligence was phenomenal but her creativity and tenacity unchallenged. She was a force in every way.\"\n\nGerry Anderson died in 2012 aged 83 after suffering from Alzheimer's.\n\nAs well as voicing Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward in Thunderbirds from its debut in 1965 until 1968, Sylvia also worked on Joe 90, Captain Scarlet and Stingray.\n\nSpeaking last September, Mrs Anderson said she had had \"fun\" playing a great aunt to her original character, voiced by Oscar nominee Rosamund Pike, in ITV reboot Thunderbirds Are Go.\n\nShe had a \"creativity and genuine love for her characters\" that touched fans around the world, her daughter said.\n\nBorn in south London to a boxing champion and a dressmaker, she went on to have a career in television spanning five decades.\n\nShe recently worked as head of programming for HBO in the UK and had been writing a show with her daughter entitled The Last Station.\n\nBehind the camera, she took on many roles for Thunderbirds, including character development and costume design.\n\nWhen asked if she saw herself as a pioneer for women in television during the 1960s, Mrs Anderson was modest.\n\n\"I never waved the flag or anything about being a woman, but I was a woman with a group of men. Now and again I would get a director and I would go on set, one in particular, no names of course, and he was very, very huffy because I was a woman giving him notes on what he had shot the previous day, and I tried to do it very carefully,\" she said.\n\nGerry and Sylvia came up with the idea for Thunderbirds in 1963.\n\nThe couple told the story of the Tracy family who form a secret organisation dedicated to saving human life, set in the future.\n\nMs Anderson said her mother \"would always find time to take care of people who were suffering or in need of support\".\n\nThe pair had planned a charity ball for Breast Cancer Care, which will now go ahead in May in her memory.\n\nShe is survived by her daughter, who is a singer-songwriter, son Gerry Anderson Junior, an anaesthetist, four grandchildren and one great-granddaughter."
