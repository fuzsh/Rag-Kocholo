        "text": "What is your NMU connection?\n\nStudent and graduate (1967-1972) with both a bachelor's and master's degree in music education.\n\nYour favorite NMU memory or story\n\nSo many memories and stories are entwined with the music department. The NMU “Pride of the North” marching band,\n\nthe tours of the Wind Ensemble, being a member of the inaugural NMU Fantastics, and the performances representing\n\nNMU across the UP and the country. The music faculty always expects the best from each student instilling pride in the department and the university.\n\nWho is the most influential person you met during your time at NMU and why were they so influential?\n\nDr. Harold Wright\n\nDr. Lorin Ricthmeyer\n\nDr. Tim Lautzenheiser\n\nDr. Robert Stephenson\n\nDr. George Whitfield\n\nDr. Elda Tate\n\nDr. Ruth Mathews\n\nDr. James Hendricks(Dept. Of Education)\n\nWith the one exception, all members of the music faculty while I was at NMU. All demanding excellence and a strong work ethic.\n\nTell us about the significance of any teams, clubs or organizations you were part of during your time at NMU\n\nThe music fraternity Phi Mu Alpha which fosters the development of music on the university level and beyond. The NMU\n\nchapter at the time encouraged a strong bond between its members and many lifelong friendships were developed,\n\nWhat is/was your favorite thing to do in Marquette?\n\nShopping at Getz’s Clothiers!\n\nTalk about any significant/memorable sporting events, weather occurrences or other on-campus activities\n\nBeing a commuter was an experience, to say the least. The UP winters were and are a challenge. During the late sixties\n\nand early seventies, NMU did not cancel classes! Thanks to my carpool of fellow music majors of Rusty Veale, Tom\n\nPolkinghorne, and Alan Oien we were often there when some of the on-campus guys weren’t.\n\nWhile I was a student at NMU during my freshmen year that I answered an ad posted on the bulletin board in the music department looking for a guitar teacher at the Delta Music Center in Ishpeming. I was hired, and the person who placed the ad was Nancy Williams, who in 1971 became my wife.\n\nShare any dorm/roommate stories you may have\n\nMany of my best friends made at NMU of course were not commuters. The shared memories of rehearsals, performances, and gatherings in the Clef Club during card games of Hearts are long-lasting. Thanks for the memories Bob Vogel, Ken Medel, Craig Bowerman, Gary Bawks, Merry Jo DeSautel, Cam Whitford, Dick Stafford, Charlie Menghini, Pete Zyburt, George Bengston, Dale Mattis, Keith Polkinghorne, and of course others.\n\nWhat is your current or former profession?\n\nDirector of Bands Retired 1972-2009\n\nNegaunee Public Schools\n\nNegaunee, MI\n\nHow did NMU help you get to where you are today?"
