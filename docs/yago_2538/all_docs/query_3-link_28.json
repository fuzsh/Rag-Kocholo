        "text": "Gerry Anderson, the creator of hit TV shows including Thunderbirds, Stingray and Joe 90, has died at the age of 83.\n\nHe also created Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and his puppet superheroes fired the imaginations of millions of young viewers in the 1960s and '70s.\n\nThunderbirds, a science-fiction fantasy about a daring rescue squad, ran from 1965 and was his most famous show.\n\nAnderson had suffered from Alzheimer's since 2010 and the disease had worsened in recent months, his son Jamie said.\n\nJamie Anderson announced the news on his website, external, saying his father died peacefully in his sleep at noon on Wednesday.\n\n\"Gerry was diagnosed with mixed dementia two years ago and his condition worsened quite dramatically over the past six months,\" he wrote.\n\nGerry Anderson talked about the onset of the disease in June 2012.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Berkshire he said: \"I don't think I realised at all. It was my wife Mary who began to notice that I would do something quite daft like putting the kettle in the sink and waiting for it to boil.\"\n\nHis other creations included UFO, Space: 1999, Supercar and Fireball XL5.\n\nAnderson said his favourite creation was Parker, Lady Penelope's butler and chauffeur in Thunderbirds.\n\nVoice actor David Graham, who voiced the reformed safecracker, as well as fan-favourite Brains, said it was \"a very sad day\".\n\n\"I owed him a lot professionally and he was a good friend as well,\" he told the BBC. \"I think he was a genius.\"\n\nHe revealed the inspiration for the voice came when Anderson \"took me to an old pub in Cookham where there was an old guy who was a waiter and he said, 'I'm going to call him over, just listen to him'.\"\n\nActor Brian Blessed, who worked with Anderson on shows including The Day After Tomorrow and Space 1999, told BBC News: \"I think a light has gone out in the universe.\n\n\"He had a great sense of humour. He wasn't childish but child-like and he had a tremendous love of the universe and astronomy and scientists.\n\n\"He got their latest theories, which he would expand on. He was always galvanised and full of energy.\""
