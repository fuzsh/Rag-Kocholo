        "text": "Thunderbirds co-creator Sylvia Anderson has passed away at the age of 88.\n\nAnderson was a producer and writer for the much-loved puppetry TV show. However, she is perhaps best known for voicing the character of Lady Penelope in its original series.\n\nAnderson died at her home in Bray, Buckinghamshire on Wednesday (March 16) following a short illness, The Guardian reports. The star’s daughter Dee Anderson confirmed the news.\n\n“Sylvia was a mother and a legend. Her intelligence was phenomenal but her creativity and tenacity unchallenged,” her daughter said in a public statement. “She was a force in every way, and will be sadly missed.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSylvia Anderson worked on Thunderbirds from 1965 to 1968, later helping to create Joe 90, Captain Scarlet and Stingray.\n\nSylvia was married to her Thunderbirds co-creator Gerry Anderson between 1960 and 1981. He died in 2012, aged 83, after battling with Alzheimer’s disease."
