Securely packaged, rolled and inserted into a strong mailing tube and shipped tracked. Poster Prints are of comparable archival quality to our Photographic prints, they are simply printed on thinner Poster Paper. Whilst we only use Photographic Prints in our frames, you can frame Poster Prints if they are carefully supported to prevent sagging over time.\n\nPoster prints are budget friendly enlarged prints in standard poster paper sizes (A0, A1, A2, A3 etc). Whilst poster paper is sometimes thinner and less durable than our other paper types, they are still ok for framing and should last many years. Our Archival Quality Photo Prints and Fine Art Paper Prints are printed on higher quality paper and the choice of which largely depends on your budget.\n\nEstimated Product Size is 59.4cm x 42cm (23.4\" x 16.5\")\n\nThese are individually made so all sizes are approximate\n\nArtwork printed orientated as per the preview above, with landscape (horizontal) orientation to match the source image.\n\nMADE IN THE UK\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nFREE COLORIZATION SERVICE\n\nYou can choose advanced AI Colorization for this picture at no extra charge!\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
