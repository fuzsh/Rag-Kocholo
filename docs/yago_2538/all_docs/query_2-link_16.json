        "text": "In an interview given on the day her husband was inducted into the Irish Radio Hall of Fame, Christine Anderson also spoke of Gerry's devastation when he learned of his illness and his bravery during his battle with cancer.\n\nAnd she said that despite being \"like chalk and cheese\", the two of them were soulmates.\n\nSpeaking on the Nolan Show ahead of the induction ceremony in Dublin, Christine said: \"I think I loved him the first time I saw him. We had many ups and downs, like every couple, but he was very easy to get on with.\"\n\nThe broadcaster, who was one of Northern Ireland's best-known presenters, died a year ago, aged 69.\n\nHis widow said that Gerry was \"completely devastated\" following his diagnosis, which led to him being off the air for two years.\n\n\"I was going through it with him and we had two wonderful years of reflecting,\" she said.\n\n\"But neither of us for one minute thought he wasn't going to make it.\"\n\nShe also said that, despite being in the media and having a very high profile, Gerry was a very private person, adding that they kept his illness out of the public domain.\n\n\"I kept it so private and Gerry so private that people were shocked when he passed away,\" she said.\n\nThe mother of their two children - David and Kirsty - said that, at the time, she wasn't aware just how ill he actually was.\n\n\"It's a funny thing,\" she said.\n\n\"You're in the middle of this nightmare and you don't see it.\n\n\"Three days before Gerry passed away I went into the office to ask the consultant what the next step was, and he said: 'I don't think you realise Gerry's dying'. And that was like a rollercoaster running over me.\"\n\nShe added: \"Gerry was just very unfortunate in his illness. Other people get through it. But I feel so lucky to have had him. I wouldn't change anything.\"\n\nIn a career spanning 30 years, he hosted radio and TV programmes for BBC Northern Ireland, BBC Radio Ulster, BBC Radio Foyle and BBC Radio 4, and was a columnist for the Belfast Telegraph. Gerry published a memoir, Surviving In Stroke City (1999), and received several radio industry accolades for his work."
