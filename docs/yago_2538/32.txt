Famous for his shows which employ "Supermarionation" - marionettes with control wires connected to interior mechanisms that control facial features and other functions of the puppets. However, since this kind of puppetry makes it difficult to depict them walking realistically, his shows are usually science fiction series that emphasize the characters operating futuristic vehicles.
