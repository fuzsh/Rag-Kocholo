Back in late 1969 & early 1970, the then married couple of Gerry Anderson & Sylvia Anderson produced their first ever live-action #SciFi TV series called #UFO, whose premise was that an unknown race of extraterrestrial aliens were clandestinely visiting Earth to use human beings as spare parts for their dying race.

While the first season of “UFO” did well when it finally premiered 2 years later in 1972 in the United States, ITC Entertainment later pulled the plug not long after ordering a 2nd season when ratings for the series when it went into reruns began to falter.

Gerry Anderson then proposed an alternate show that eventually morphed into what became #Space1999.
