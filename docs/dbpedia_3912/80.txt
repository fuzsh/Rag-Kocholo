Per Wikipedia:

"'Kilroy' was here is an American popular culture expression that became popular during World War II; it is typically seen in graffiti.

Its origins are debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle — a bald-headed man (sometimes depicted as having a few hairs) with a prominent nose peeking over a wall with the fingers of each hand clutching the wall — became associated with GIs in the 1940s.

On the outside wall of the World War II Memorial on the National Mall (DC) are two golden gates. There is a 'Kilroy Was Here' engraving behind each of them."
