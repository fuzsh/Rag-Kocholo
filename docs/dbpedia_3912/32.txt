KILROY WAS HERE Giant False Leaf Katydid (Pseudophyllus titan, Pseudophyllinae, Tettigoniidae) by Sinobug (itchydogimages) on Flickr. Pu’er, Yunnan, China See more Chinese grasshoppers and crickets on my Flickr site HERE..... "Kilroy was here" is an American popular culture expression that became popular during World War II; it is typically seen in graffiti. Its origins are debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle — a bald-headed man (sometimes depicted as having a few hairs) with a prominent nose peeking over a wall with the fingers of each hand clutching the wall — became associated with GIs in the 1940s.
