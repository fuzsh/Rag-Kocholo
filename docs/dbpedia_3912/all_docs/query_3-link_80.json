        "text": "Beginning in 1939, World War II involved over 100 million people across 30 countries; it was the deadliest war in history. The war includes events such as the Holocaust, the introduction of nuclear weapons, and the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Prior to Pearl Harbor, the United States remained neutral through the war, only entering after the Japanese’s direct attack.\n\nOver 16 million Americans served in the armed forces during this time; over 405,000 were killed and 670,000 injured, and over 130,000 were held as prisoners of war. The war ended with the suicide of Adolph Hitler, the execution of Mussolini, the surrenders of Germany and Italy, and the forced surrender of Japan following the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings.\n\nThe World War II memorial completed construction and was dedicated on December 11, 2011, the 70th anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor. The two black granite tablets stand over 6 feet tall, honoring each branch of the United States Armed Forces. Paying homage to the war veterans in the Wichita area, the memorial is decorated with brick pathways, the bricks carved with the veteran’s name, branch of services, and dates of service.\n\nPhoto Credit: Dave Norris\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary says simply that Kilroy was “The name of a mythical person”. One theory identifies James J. Kilroy (1902–1962), an American shipyard inspector, as the man behind the signature. The New York Times indicated J.J. Kilroy as the origin in 1946, based on the results of a contest conducted by the Amalgamated Transit Union to establish the origin of the phenomenon. The article noted that Kilroy had marked the ships themselves as they were being built—so, at a later date, the phrase would be found chalked in places that no graffiti-artist could have reached (inside sealed hull spaces, for example), which then fed the mythical significance of the phrase—after all, if Kilroy could leave his mark there, who knew where else he could go? Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable notes this as a possible origin, but suggests that “the phrase grew by accident.”\n\nDuring World War II he worked at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, where he claimed to have used the phrase to mark rivets he had checked. The builders, whose rivets J.J. Kilroy was counting, were paid depending on the number of rivets they put in. A riveter would make a chalk mark at the end of his or her shift to show where he had left off and the next riveter had started. Unscrupulous riveters discovered that, if they started work before the inspector arrived, they could receive extra pay by erasing the previous worker’s chalk mark and chalking a mark farther back on the same seam, giving themselves credit for some of the previous riveter’s work. J.J. Kilroy stopped this practice by writing “Kilroy was here” at the site of each chalk mark. At the time, ships were being sent out before they had been painted, so when sealed areas were opened for maintenance, soldiers found an unexplained name scrawled. Thousands of servicemen may have potentially seen his slogan on the outgoing ships and Kilroy’s apparent omnipresence and inscrutability sparked a legend. The slogan began to be regarded as proof that a ship had been checked well, and as a kind of protective talisman. Afterwards, servicemen began placing the slogan on different places and especially in newly captured areas or landings, and the phrase took on connotations of the presence or protection of the US armed forces.\n\nThe Lowell Sun reported in November 1945, with the headline “How Kilroy Got There”, that a 21-year old soldier from Everett, Sgt. Francis J. Kilroy, Jr., wrote “Kilroy will be here next week” on a barracks bulletin board at a Boca Raton airbase while ill with flu, and the phrase was picked up by other airmen and quickly spread abroad. The Associated Press similarly reported at the same time that according to Sgt. Kilroy, when he was hospitalized early in World War II a friend of his, Sgt. James Maloney, wrote the phrase on a bulletin board. Maloney continued to write the shortened phrase when he was shipped out a month later, and other airmen soon picked up the phrase. Francis Kilroy himself only wrote the phrase a couple of times."
