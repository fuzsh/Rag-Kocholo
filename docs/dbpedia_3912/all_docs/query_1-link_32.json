        "text": "Hook And Irons sent this email to their subscribers on October 13, 2023.\n\nNew Blog. Kilroy Was Here\n\nText-only version of this email\n\nKilroy Was Here The History of the world's first meme. Imagine thousands of tired and bleary eyed GI's marching through the war torn streets of Europe during WWII, scanning ahead and looking for unknown dangers when they encounter, etched on a wall, a childish but altogether familiar face peering over a ledge: a round bald head, a bulbous nose, and fingers clutching the edge of the wall. An accompanying proclamation, ‘Kilroy Was Here,’ always nearby, a sort of signature. Kilroy is an enigma wrapped in chalk and wall scribbles, a graffiti ghost from World War II, who seemed to be everywhere even before the GIs could get there and has made appearances in every conflict since. He was scribbled on the bulkhead of ships, painted on the walls of the places Americans were sent to liberate, etched on the sides of Zippo lighters and drawn on sides of tents the GI's slept. Kilroy. A name so plain, yet dotted with an irresistible allure of mystique. His omnipresence during the tense days of the 1940s wasn’t just a doodle; it was a thread weaving through the solidarity of soldiers, an unspoken nod that whispered: You're not alone - Kilroy was here, and now, so are you. Shop Now Today, Kilroy hasn’t entirely vanished. He pops up in unexpected corners, on the walls of historic sites, in comic strips, and sometimes, in modern street art. To me Kilroy is a nod to the past, a slight chuckle threading through history, linking us back to moments of weariness, hope, mischief, and perhaps a shared understanding amidst chaos that we are in this together. Hook & Irons has added to the legend of Kilroy by adding his likeness to the American Fire Service. He is a nod to the humor that the American soldier had, the symbolism that has persisted, and the the humor we must have in this job where chaos can come at any time.
