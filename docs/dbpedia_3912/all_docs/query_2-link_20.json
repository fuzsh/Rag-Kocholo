        "text": "In planning your attendance at a New Orleans wedding, be sure to allow extra time at the Higgins Hotel for a few days on your own! You should be fine as long as you adhere to the rules of common courtesy. Being punctual, respecting the couple’s wishes, and limiting your alcohol intake are only some things you should keep in mind when attending the wedding. You should be considerate to others and ensure that you do not interfere with the ceremony in any way. Even if you do not know many people at the event, you can have a good time and enjoy yourself. Here are the top things you need to know to avoid faux pas when attending your first wedding.\n\nConfirm Your Attendance Promptly\n\nWhen you receive a wedding invitation, you must confirm your attendance. By telling the couple if you can or cannot attend, they will be able to plan more accurately, for instance, how much food they will need at the wedding reception. You should send your reply promptly and avoid unnecessary delays. The couple will also tell you how you can RSVP. Make sure that you fill in the information accurately. Sometimes, you might receive a printed card that you should fill in with all the information they need. On other occasions, it might be enough to send your answer digitally. And if there is any change in your circumstances, let the couple know as soon as possible. After confirming, be sure to check availability at the Higgins Hotel, Curio by Hilton to assure you can book your choice of room there. See: http://www.higginshotelnola.com/our-wedding for a specially discounted rate for wedding attendees. In spring and fall, availability is sometimes more constricted, due to convention activity, so book early!\n\nSend Your Gift At The Right Time\n\nGetting a perfect gift for the couple does not need to be difficult. All you need to do is listen to what the couple asks for. If they have a registry, then use it. And if they ask everyone to donate the money elsewhere instead of buying a gift, listen to them. On the other hand, if they do not say anything about gifts, then you can never go wrong with cash. However, you also need to give the couple the gift at the right time. Greenvelope’s blog can help you learn more about wedding gift etiquette, and you might find further inspiration there. You can also give the couple a nice card they can keep to commemorate the special day.\n\nPlan Your Travels In Advance\n\nPunctuality is one of the most significant rules of every good wedding guest. It is highly important that you come to the ceremony on time. So, you should plan your travel arrangements in advance. If the wedding venue is a bit far from your home, you might want to plan in more detail. For instance, if you would need to travel too far, be sure to book a hotel room and spend a couple of nights before the ceremony, allowing you to enjoy the city prior to the event. But even when you are not spending the night, you need to plan your transportation carefully. Have a look if there are any road closures that you need to be aware of. And if you are traveling by public transport, ensure that there is a connection that can take you to the location on time.\n\nWear A Suitable Attire\n\nIf you are not careful about what you wear to the wedding, you could make quite a faux pas. Women should wear a nice cocktail dress or a long gown, and it is important that you avoid white color. It might be taken as disrespect towards the bride. After all, the bride should be the center of everyone’s attention during the ceremony and upcoming celebrations. Men, on the other hand, can wear a tux or even a blazer with a dress shirt. However, when you are picking your outfit for the wedding, the most crucial thing is to adhere to the dress code. From there, it will be much easier to choose what to wear. Some weddings can be more formal. But on some occasions, the newlyweds prefer more casual events. Find out the dress code in advance, and you will not be able to go wrong.\n\nSwitch Off Your Phone\n\nThere are only a few things that could be more awkward than a phone that starts ringing during the ceremony or one of the speeches at the wedding reception. So, before the wedding starts, you should switch off your mobile phone. If you cannot part with the online world, you should at least turn on the silent mode. This way, you will be able to avoid an unnecessary embarrassment that could interfere with the celebrations. You should also listen to the couple’s wishes. At some weddings, couples might ask the guests to turn off their phones or not to post anything on social media. In that case, you should respect their request and enjoy the day without the device.\n\nWatch Your Alcohol Intake\n\nWhen people reflect on the wedding, they should be talking about the bride and the groom. If you drink too much alcohol, you might lose control of your behavior. The intoxication might lead to many unpleasant situations, and then, if people talked about the event, they would remember the unfortunate incident. You should enjoy yourself at the wedding and have a good time with others. So, you should be very careful about how much alcohol you drink. You also must remember that you should not be driving after drinking alcohol. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 32 Americans die in drunk driving accidents every single day. Drink responsibly and do not put others in danger.\n\nDo Not Take Attention Away From The Couple\n\nAt the wedding, all the attention should be on the couple. Weddings tend to make people very happy, but there are still some things you should not share with others. For example, a wedding should not be a place where you announce your engagement or pregnancy. Even though it is an exciting announcement, it would be considered rude to share that at someone else’s wedding. You might take attention away from the couple, and in the end, it might ruin their day, no matter how happy they would be for you. When you have some happy news to share with the world, try to do so after the wedding."
