Until that moment, the external world had been shielded from me; my parents and peers had kept my attention, and, by doing so, diverted it from the melting pot of culture around me. In retrospect, though I went with my friends, we experienced this freedom in solitude; hardly any of us spoke on the Oyster Bay line of the LIRR into the city. Rather, our minds became like sponges; we absorbed the visual, verbal, and material culture that we had just entered.\n\nNot more than five minutes after we boarded the train, I saw, what was to me a beautiful work of art: a graffiti mural on a highway overpass. Though I had previously been exposed to graffiti, both by friends who were \"skaters\" and others, like my elders, I had never come to appreciate its artistic beauty. Painted in vivid colors and seemingly cryptic language, an environmental eyesore had virtually been transformed into a living piece of art. In the city that day, my memory was saturated with different tags and murals, all which were of a unique style and color. Though I had difficulty reading the words, and distinguishing the individual images, I had been exposed to a form of art, that, even today, lacks both recognition and social approval.\n\nThis new-found appreciation for spray can art led me to sit in the window seat every train ride into the city from then on. In the past eight years, as I sat by the window, I have seen popular graffiti become more prevalent. Not only have walls been painted, but subway cars, street posts, bathroom walls, bus seats, train seats, roads, sidewalks, telephone booths, truck sides, billboards, posters, and even notebooks have become the sketch pad where art is created, and thus, a home for graffiti art is found.\n\nParallel to the visual emergence of modern graffiti has been the creation of, for our purpose, a distinct \"graffiti culture\". Anthropologists, invested in the study of culture, will find that graffiti writers, uniquely defined by their style, purpose, and geographical location, are the participants in a distinct subculture of American society. Within this graffiti culture, taggers\" (writers who sign their names on the walls in cryptic style) have formed \"crews\" that \"represent\" not only in big urban cities, but also, \"bomb\" in local communities. These aforementioned terms like bombing, tagger, crews, and represent are not only an aspect of graffiti culture, but more importantly, this dialect is a distinct testimony to the idea that graffiti \"culture\" is inextricably linked to the larger American culture which we are a part of. Language and culture go hand-in-hand; language creates culture, and similarly, culture creates language. Therefore, the difficulty I expressed earlier about being able to read tag art is justified; this distinct language is reserved for members of the graffiti culture and may only be acquired through the participation or repeated exposure to tag culture.\n\nInterpreted in this light, graffiti can be seen as a form of communication. This quality of graffiti art, as a communicative convention, is a common feature of the \"subculture\" as explored by authors, primarily, Hebdige (1979). These authors share a similar understanding that the methods used by a \"subculture\" to communicate provide the opportunity for anthropologists to gain perspective and insight on graffiti as a subculture born of contemporary American culture.\n\nFollowing the lead of other authors who have investigated and documented common features of the graffiti culture, this thesis aims to offer a new perspective on the contemporary state of graffiti in the 21st century. The goal of the anthropologist is to break down the walls of the ethnocentric scope. My purpose is not to judge the social, political, or moral merits or shortcomings of graffiti art, but to explore the range of attitudes and practices from both sides of the social spectrum — those who condone and those who condemn. Rather than passing judgment, I am interested in the ways graffiti becomes a flashpoint for debates about delinquency, art, urban decay and the appropriate use of public space. This thesis will explore how graffiti is used by the gang culture as a symbol of unity and communication and follow this history into the present day, highlighting graffiti's movement into public space and how graffiti acquired greater meaning through this shift. This transformation is marked as the first \"face\" that graffiti acquired throughout its social development, and thus, will be treated in the text accordingly.\n\nRiding the hip-hop movement of the 1970's and 80's, graffiti was \"re-born\" into a more public light. Iridescent colors in cryptic form plagued the streets of NYC, generating a wealth of social commentary and political reactionary measures. As graffiti connoted the impoverished, violent, and unruly, graffiti artists struggled to carve a niche of significance in mainstream American culture. This cultural battle (that between the majority/mainstream culture and the minority/subculture was unavoidable) led to changes in the graffiti culture. As it was inevitable, chronological progression and extraneous influences were marked contributors to the reality of how the \"face\" of graffiti has changed in recent years. The \"face\" of graffiti, and its subsequent changes in recent years, will be the nucleus of the thesis argument — the material presented will relate back to this theme. In light of its present significance, I offer this summary as what I would like to be understood as the definition of the \"face\" of graffiti, \"used throughout the remainder of this thesis in reference to the specific developmental stage at which graffiti finds itself\". This \"face\" is inclusive of all cultural, stylistic, physical and implicit changes of, the graffiti culture participants, but also, the people, places, purpose, and presentation or style in which graffiti has manifested itself in American society since its contemporary \"re-birth\" in the late 1970's.\n\nThrough interviews and documented research, I will offer an explanation as to why graffiti has been a topic of social and political controversy for many years. In this research, I will uncover how the stigma attached to the graffiti world inhibits it from gaining artistic recognition, and in contrast, how some graffiti, in its inherent nature and meaning, add fuel to the fire of social disapproval. This social debate has come to the forefront in contemporary culture, and due to this immediacy, this thesis will explore how graffiti has undergone a shift of purpose, meaning, form, and aesthetic presence during the course of its maturation. Graff, the contemporary digital image of graffiti, will bring the thesis full circle. Using public vehicles to promote graffiti and overcome endless social problems, the artists who participate in this method of expression have invented a new way by which to immortalize and facilitate the visibility of graffiti in contemporary culture through the use of the Internet, and consequently, the Internet's home for contemporary graffiti, coined \"graff\".\n\nGraffiti, like any other art form, can be an aesthetic tool used by the anthropologist to better understand the social, political, and cultural attitudes deeply embedded within a particular group. I am not necessarily claiming that art defines culture, but rather, am asserting the notion that it is visual representation of particular beliefs and attitudes, and quite certainly, is a material manifestation that, by nature, has the ability to contribute to culture. All people, whether a member of the graffiti community, or not, can see the art on the wall; the meaning is subject to interpretation, and thus, the intended meaning and audience may be overlooked, transformed into an unintended statement.\n\nTherefore, this thesis will offer insight into the lives of graffiti artists. By documenting some key aspects of graffiti culture, it is the purpose of this thesis to better familiarize the reader with a micro-culture of our shared American culture that for so long has only been characterized by the art and not the artist. Susan Phillips, in her book titled Wallbangin' describes her similar interest in graffiti culture:\n\nGraffiti has provided me a special window into people's lives. This window has allowed me to see the positive in what is usually viewed as negative, to find morality in what is often considered depravity, and to discover a creativity and depth of history that makes me grateful to live in the time and place that I do. (Phillips 1999: 351)\n\nAnthropology is based in the narrative; the primary goal of the anthropologist is to understand a way of life through participant observation. This critical tool enables the anthropologist to establish a relationship with the people who are an integral part of the cultural system, and thus, learn from watching, helping, and questioning them in an honest and sincere environment.\n\nGraffiti, rather than being identified as its own culture, is often associated with many other specific cultures; hip-hop, gang, and skateboard culture all contribute to the graffiti art culture. However, hip-hop, gang, and skater graffiti must be viewed in their own light; it would be a disservice to graffiti art to define the culture solely by characteristics of the previously mentioned contributors. As graffiti has changed over the course of time, the types of graffiti (hip-hop, political, gang) have developed differently, and so, as this thesis focuses itself on the changing \"face\" of hip-hop graffiti, it is important to read about this individual form, apart from the many underlying social connotations associated with the other graffiti sub-cultures. For example, gang graffiti may often be viewed in society as a visual territorial claim; sometimes misinterpreted, the myth of the \"Bloods\" and \"Crips\" of LA has heightened the social awareness of gang related graffiti and its ultimate purpose. On the other hand, hip-hop graffiti may also be territorial, but in a different sense. These writers fight for wall space. A mutual respect is found between many of the more prominent artists, and so, their murals are often left untouched and undisturbed. Finally, skaters have a tendency to tag all around NYC; no territorial claims seem to be made, rather, these sticker tags, and quick wall scribbles are the signposts where the skaters leave their name. Whatever the case may be, it is sad to understand that all of these graffiti types have been viewed as one rebellious culture; viewed as a group of delinquent individuals who have little self-regard and an obvious lack of regard for public property. Graffiti may not be viewed as a monolithic culture, but rather, must be engaged as a representation of a diversity of voices.\n\nOn this note, I would like to briefly mention the different types of graffiti as offered by Phillips (1999) — popular and community-based graffiti. By noting the depth of its message and the impact upon the individuals that it has reached, it may be possible to appreciate graffiti from an artistic, expressive standpoint, rather than it being approached from the stereotypical societal view. I do not intend to make the argument that graffiti is politically correct, in that it can be considered as defacing public or private property, but rather, I am hoping with that a more comprehensive understanding of both who creates and who sees the graffiti in America, it will be possible for the reader to understand graffiti in light of its cultural significance. This task, in itself, is the purpose of the ethnographic approach of the anthropologist; contact and discussion with the participants of graffiti culture is the only way by which to truly document graffiti culture as the graffiti artists experience it.\n\nIf we understand the diversity of graffiti in form, content, and construction, it is possible to see how graffiti is a unique method of expression used by an often-overlooked sub-culture in our global society. Therefore, I will offer a brief description of how graffiti is categorized in society; these categories indicate boundaries that distinguish one type of graffiti from another, and so, also draw lines between artistic sub-cultures within the graffiti community.\n\nStyles and Meanings of Graffiti\n\nSusan Phillips (1999) identifies two distinct categories, which may be used to better understand graffiti; \"popular graffiti\" and \"community-based graffiti\" differ in their content, authors, and intended audience. However, it is important to note that though these types of graffiti differ on these particular domains, the inherent nature of graffiti is preserved in that they both share the same contextual arena — public space. Phillips here defines popular graffiti:\n\nFirst is the ever-present \"popular graffiti\" — the everyday stuff, the witty commentary, Read\"s \"folk epigraphy,\" Dundes's \"latrinalia,\" the phallic symbols, the jokes, the \"for a good time call X's,\" the \"eat me's,\" and \"fuck you's,\" the love proclamations, and the \"so-and-so's were here.\" This type of graffiti is generally written in the national language so that everyone can understand it and, if they want to, participate in its humor or respond in kind. (Phillips 1999:47)\n\nEveryone encounters this type of graffiti on a daily basis; it is on bathroom stalls, public billboards, and even is chalked on the sidewalks of the Union College campus; from this graffiti, there is no escape. This pervasive nature of \"popular graffiti\" is what intrigues anthropologists like myself; its consistent representation in American culture inextricably links it to our contemporary social world — graffiti is a part of us.\n\nIf I am somewhat representative of the middle-class American male youth, and do admit to, from time-to-time, writing on the walls of bathroom stalls, carving my name on trees, etching my initials on school desks, and inking my name in school texts, then I may assume that my behavior is not uncommon. However, though these behaviors are not condoned, the greater public similarly, not harshly condemns them. In a matter of speaking, I am a graffiti artist; the act of disfiguring public property makes me a vandal, and consequently, a person who has created graffiti.\n\nThe argument may be made that graffiti does not describe my behavior, but rather, graffiti is a term used for spray-can art and initial marking in cryptic form. I am not here to attack or admonish those who have participated in behaviors similar to mine. Rather, I would like to illustrate the fact that according to Phillips's definition of \"popular graffiti\", it is difficult to lump all graffiti together as one type of artistic expression; if this were to happen, my initials on the bathroom stall in the basement of my high-school would carry the same public perception as a larger spray painted initial on the side of a NYC building. The American public disapproves of the latter graffiti based on its placement in the public arena and its inherent ability to alienate the public majority from its message and meaning. Because of the popular distinction between acceptable and unacceptable graffiti in our society I would like to offer Phillips's second category of graffiti which may better fit the stereotypical image of this expressive medium — \"community-based graffiti\".\n\nThe second category described by Phillips, community-based graffiti, in essence, is the graffiti that generally is viewed as a nuisance to a common citizen. Personally speaking, graffiti art classified under this heading were always the pictures spray-painted in exaggerated bubble letter and cartoonist style. These graffiti were the ones that I became enchanted by in the opening anecdote. These graffiti were the ones that appeared in vibrant pastels, vivacious characters, and a vicissitude of remote locations. These graffiti are the ones that at one time I did not understand. These graffiti are the ones that I hope to give the reader insight into, so that they too, may better understand their complex meaning, and dynamic culture from which they are born.\n\nPhillips (1999) offers many sub-categories that fall under the aforementioned heading of community-based graffiti. It is important that all of the sub-categories be mentioned at this time, as the remainder of this thesis will primarily focus on one particular type of community-based graffiti — hip-hop graffiti. Briefly, hip-hop graffiti was chosen due to its innate ability to both alienate and create a cohesive group that reflects contemporary social trends and issues. Also, hip-hop graffiti is chosen due to the style, method, and individuals that create these images, as these individuals also seem to be a part of the middle-class American society that is confronted and affected by the presence of these images.\n\nGang graffiti is a type of graffiti that often underscores much of the social recognition that this expressive medium may merit. However, the power to create identity and communicate political rhetoric and personal anti-sentiments in gang graffiti must not be ignored. Political graffiti is based in internal symbolism by which negative political sentiments are voiced. These types of graffiti are common during times of politically charged movements, and consequently, the have the ability to evoke an emotional response, whether positive or negative, from their audience. Finally, in my opinion, the most interesting category of community-based graffiti is that which is a product of the \"hip-hop culture\". I use the term \"hip-hop culture\" to refer to the type of graffiti that is a product of contemporary pop-culture. Hip-hop graffiti is a visual product of the hip-hop culture, an offbeat youth culture emerging in society, and thus is ingrained in music, clothes, dialect, and messages stemming from roots of the hip-hop movement.\n\nThis type of graffiti is spraycan art, tag art, and aerosol art. Lining subway station walls, billboards, and building sides, \"hip-hop graffiti\" is what many would deem as the most intriguing and sophisticated style of writing. \"Hip-hop graffiti\" has become a global art form, and through its illegal expressive medium, has come to gain greater attention in the media (Phillips 1999:49-56). Though each of the aforementioned types of graffiti may engage a different issue, it is important to remember that each of these graffiti styles is a product of the graffiti culture. Each type of graffiti plays an integral part in the understanding of American culture and as it will become clear, the communal purpose shared by the individuals who create any of these types of graffiti structures the unity and cohesiveness that is a necessary feature of any culture.\n\nGraffiti as Art: Public Perception and Consumption\n\nEach graffiti artist has a unique style; just like Van Gogh, Vermeer, Rembrandt, Escher, and even Michaelangelo, all artists prefer different surfaces and materials with which to create. As the history of art indicates, experimentation with different mediums occurred, and in turn, certain individuals found that they could best express themselves on canvas, in marble, on wood, in oil, in watercolor, in pointillism, in small, in large, and even on ceilings. How were these choices a visual representation of the culture and time in which they painted? How did their youth experiences (material, symbol, and linguistic) understanding of the world shape their choice? As Abel and Buckley (1977) put it:\n\nIf the art and literature of a particular culture are often examined for insights into the preoccupations of the best minds of that society, should not graffiti be given the same consideration? Does a drawing have to be plastered on a page to qualify for such analysis? Do we stop searching for the inner meaning of a painting or a poem when it appears on a wall merely because we do not happen to acknowledge the wall as a suitable receptacle for art or literature? Do we stop trying to understand what motivated the artist or the writer merely because he chose to express his thoughts through some unconventional medium? (Abel & Buckley 1977:14)\n\nThe aforementioned questions bring to the surface many of the significant insights that the study of graffiti may lend to our anthropological and psychological knowledge and perception of popular culture. These questions also raise issues concerning the public perception and consumption of graffiti as art; it is understood that the inherent meaning of graffiti is often overlooked due to the unconventional medium in which it is displayed. The anthropologist, trained in a relativist approach to culture, may explore the significance of its meaning as an expressive form and social commentary. By understanding and appreciating graffiti as a part of our society, it is possible to develop and embrace a greater understanding of us as Americans.\n\nThus, a question arises as to what is the significant difference between a commissioned Michaelangelo fresco on the ceiling of a Church and a MTA subway car painted in the holiday spirit by P Jay and Lyndah? Further, what is the difference between these two scenarios and graffiti murals commissioned by Project Safe to be painted as an advertisement for an AIDS hotline and drug abuse center?\n\nWhat distinguishes these three examples may be mainly a public stereotype and this idea will be explored further throughout this thesis. Michaelangelo is considered to be one of the most profound artists in history while graffiti artists are generally considered to be a nuisance to the general public. Even though Project Safe's murals helped increase the number of callers in search of help, the method by which this goal was achieved was shunned in the public eye. Needless to say, even though Project Safe undeniably provided a boundless social resource, they were forced to paint over their advertisements, and consequently, spend an additional $400 dollars that could have been used for a greater purpose. Project Safe used the private space, which had been approved for this use by the building owner. Project Safe, however, used this private space in a public arena; though they could choose to aesthetically develop the building side any which way they pleased, their social service advertisements were met with harsh disapproval by the political anti-graffiti movement team in Denver. After the anti-graffiti task force had conducted lengthy research, the team figured out a way by which to legally demand the elimination of these murals. \"Working through Denver Zoning Administrator Dorothy Nepa — who announced that \"they weren't murals. They were signs. They were erected without permits\" (in Kirksey, 1989: 5B) — the city issued \"cease-and-desist\" orders to the buildings' owners\" (Ferrell 1993:1823).\n\nThus, it is obvious that public officials, and subsequently, the general public look negatively at graffiti, even in its most productive form. Whereas Michaelangelo's fresco is a work of beauty and indication of a refinement of God-given talent, its purpose it serves in contemporary society is merely a painting to be looked at. And, in fact, if Michaelangelo's paintings were kept in his bedroom, their significance to not only the art world and its critics, but also its impact on contemporary society would have never occurred.\n\nProject Safe's graffiti approach to a contemporary public medical threat may not be seen as artistic or beautiful by many, however, its beauty must not be defined by its aesthetics. Rather, by its inherent ability to motivate those people in need of help to seek help, its purpose serves humanity. Ernest Abel makes the distinction between graffiti art and \"initial carving\" or tagging, but consequently, arrives at a similar conclusion. He states:\n\nThe graffiti \"artist\" whose work brightens a drab area and adds color to the mind-dulling blandness of the inner city, whose designs enliven the sterile concrete jungles, is considered by some to be upgrading his environment: Initials are the work of a self-centered narcissist interested only in seeing his name; but the graffiti \"artist,\" so the argument goes, is a public benefactor. (Abel 1977:139)\n\nIt can be said that graffiti, therefore, is a reflection on the relationship between art and society, and consequently, this raises the question as to the authenticity of art in the public world. Society has the ability to change and alter the boundaries and \"walls\", which define what is art. Though graffiti may not presently be categorized as a type of art, it must, however, be appreciated as a medium by which it is possible to reach particular individuals. The anthropologist would affirm that this ability to serve humanity makes this linguistic medium a critical part of our culture. Though every anthropologist may not agree with its illegal nature, it is important to understand that its ability to speak to the public is a feature that must not be ignored.\n\nPublic vs. Private Space: Construction and Use\n\nThe aforementioned anecdote concerning the murals commissioned by Project Safe in Denver highlights an issue that lies at the base of both the graffiti message, as well as, the anti-graffiti opposition. It is clear that the use of public space to serve private purposes is unacceptable by the general public. Though, in reference to Project Safe, the building owners private wall was painted with his consent, there remained a problem. It was suggested, through the political reaction to the image, that there are implicit laws, which guide the way an individual utilizes this space. In summary, private space becomes public when the public disapproves of how an individual uses the space privately. The message remains that the public (officials and citizens) often dictate the private, and so, it appears as though the only truly private space that remains lies within the walls of a home or building, hidden from the public eye of disapproval and judgment. Graffiti, therefore, poses a threat to political and social control in its embedded message, regardless of the style or method by which it is conveyed. There is an inherent protest against the corporate and governmental control of public space in any graffiti art, tag art, or work of art that finds its canvas in the public forum.\n\nIn turn, I would like to address the question as to who controls public space. It is evident through the construction of billboards, their intended purpose and their contractors that public space is owned and controlled by a minority in our society. I will borrow an interesting fact from my professor's office door which reads that, \"95% of the world's money is held by lower than 2% of the population\" (Meade). This 2% of the population controls our everyday resources, makes decisions as to where they are most needed, and designates how we will consume them. Billboards are the products of capitalism, owned by multi-billion dollar corporations that make up the majority of the wealth in our country, billboards are an advertisement displayed in public space.\n\nIn essence, as we quietly walk through our daily lives, we are flooded with images, pictures, products, and slogans that we have not chosen to see. Why then, if graffiti utilizes a similar method of presentation, do we view the image and consequent message as vulgar, and the act, as vandalism? Though this question will be answered in more concrete depth later in this paper, I would like to explore this issue on both a psychological and anthropological front. Phillips (1999) initiated my interest in this particular aspect of graffiti. It is believed that an identical message when presented in a magazine would be viewed as graffiti if it were displayed on a subway car, alley wall, or street corner store. Phillips addresses this issue in light of Armando Silva's research when she states:\n\nIn his exploration of the \"marginalized\" aspects of graffiti, Armando Silva (1987) indicates that graffiti transform permissible writing into the impermissible. A message may be moral, legal, or social, but it is incompatible with societal norms due to its form. What is acceptable in a newspaper ad becomes illicit when it resides in graffiti, even if the messages are identical. In using graffiti, Silva indicates, writers marginalize activities that could potentially be legitimate. Further, the fact that the chosen medium is marginal and illegal often correlates to the type of people who produce graffiti — people who are themselves marginalized, even if only through the manner they choose to express themselves. (Phillips 1999:23)\n\nSo it is my question of who decides what is permissible public space that is conveniently answered by graffiti. A response to this larger issue of the control of public space; graffiti, in its expressive form, promotes a message that the public fails to interpret due to its chosen medium. There is a paradox here; graffiti uses public space to contest those who control it, and simultaneously, the public disregards the message as an act of vandalism due to our own biases and structural complacency. Though many are in opposition to the fact that the distribution of power is based on the control of money and this is the protest that graffiti expresses, the public fails to make the connection between this shared philosophy. By evaluating graffiti from an anthropological perspective, this type of resistance to an elitist dictation of public space may be understood.\n\nIt is a fact that money dictates both contemporary visibility and invisibility. Those who are able to pay for space may use it as they see fit, whether it be for the posting of advertisements or for the building of a mansion by which space is made private through the construction of walls and boundary markers. Therefore, it can be understood that the use of public space, whether or not commissioned by the general public, is left in the hands of the elite. The elite, in this respect, may be granted the luxury of privacy in their homes, as well as, be afforded the opportunity to advertise business ventures or other concerns in the public forum due to their economic status. On the other hand, the majority of Americans may only find privacy in their home, and the degree to which this privacy becomes possible depends on individual economic resources. Thus, the American public is bombarded on a daily basis with billboards and other advertising mechanisms in the public arena.\n\nThe ability to create images in public space is a power that must not be overlooked. Though, psychologically speaking, it may be argued that we have become desensitized to the presence of these billboards, their ability to shape our consumer decisions is more powerful than we may understand. Individual disapproval to their presence in public space is seemingly pointless, as only an elite few (corporations and individuals) seem to dictate the use of public space.\n\nTherefore, I would like to suggest that graffiti, though seen as vandalism and an illegal use of public space, is rather a type of resistance that opposes the elitist control of imagery and message. Ferrell best defines this message in his book Crimes of Style when he states:\n\nGraffiti writing survives as a creative, playful response to a prefabricated culture, a response as disrespectful of legal and political boundaries as it is the private and \"public\" property through which they are enforced. Graffiti exists as a public art outside the control of public officials, an alternative style outside the circle of corporate style and consumption. Graffiti illuminates the city, but sporadically, less a series of lasting monuments than evocative moments, vulnerable to the give and take of the street. Ultimately, it stands as a sort of decentralized and decentered insubordination, a mysterious resistance to conformity and control, a stylish counterpunch to the belly of authority. (Ferrell 1993:197)\n\nGraffiti art, at its very core, is illegal in its nature, and so, a visual act of defiance and revolt. Though the messages may not be directed at authority figures or political ideals, the fact remains that behind each piece of graffiti lies public space.\n\nGraffiti as a form of Public and Political Resistance\n\nA visually salient, though often artistic and creative manner of resistance, graffiti inherently opposes political domination and authoritative control of public space. Phillips candidly remarks, \"Because of these destructive tendencies, graffiti says \"fuck you\" to society, even if it doesn't exactly say \"fuck you\" — though many graffiti, of course, do\" (Phillips 1999:23). She continues with this thought:\n\nWhether or not it says so in so many words, the fuck you message is implicit in the use of graffiti as communication. The medium itself implies alienation, discontentment, marginality, repression, resentment, rebellion: no matter what it says, graffiti always implies a \"fuck you\". Though addressing the larger society in this contemptuous manner may be a secondary or even tertiary element of the graffiti writer's agenda, this element always lurks in the background of every graffito on every wall. (Phillips 1999:23)\n\nThis type of rebellion and resentment, shared between the graffiti artists and their work, is exactly the type of message that society tries to suffocate. The blatant disregard for public space is interpreted by the public as a type of \"fuck you\" statement; internalized, the message of graffiti is seen as a personal attack, rather than a more general resistance to a system which leaves the fate of public space in the hands of a minority within our society.\n\nThus, it is obvious that graffiti inherently promotes a message of rebellion and resistance, a type of resistance that promotes an anarchist ideology in many layers. Reisner and Wechsler (1974) also maintain a position on graffiti that regards it as the voice of resistance. In this passage, it is obvious that the expressive medium of graffiti is an opposition to authoritative and aristocratic domination.\n\nGraffiti are the voice of the common man. We are used to taking our history from aristocrats and statesmen and their paid scribes. But through graffiti we discover evidence of another version of history, characterized by oppression and opposition to the official point of view. Topics too sensitive, too bigoted, too outrageous for the official version are the natural province. (Reisner & Wechsler 1974:vi)\n\nAlong these same lines, other anthropologists have explored the nature of a resistance movement in society. Graffiti, with its seemingly global appeal and use, has been a form of political resistance for many years. It is important here to note, however, that though the basic message of graffiti remains the same, in that it is a commentary on the private control and use of public space, it is also necessary to indicate a second message of graffiti. Through the act of graffiti, a second message may be promoted, which is central to its nature; the content of each graffiti piece is unique to the context and circumstances from which every individual writes. Thus, graffiti is not only a form of political resistance, but also, remains a way by which people may assume a sense of cohesiveness, rallying around shared ideology.\n\nOften, graffiti has been used as a type of political resistance in third-world nations; anonymous expressive acts of political rhetoric, these graffiti are a cultural commentary on the likes and dislikes of social policy. Stephen Leavitt relates this cultural phenomenon in his essay, \"Cargo Beliefs and Religious Experience\". He maintains the understanding that people occupy themselves with a particular behavior, action, or object in the face of political domination; in the case of Papa New Guinea, cargo cults have emerged as a convention by which to maintain identity and prestige in the face of political oppression. Similar to the way in which graffiti creates identity, the Papa New Guineans have used cargo as a material way by which to comment on social ideology and, in turn, create a shared system of beliefs through which people may have an identity. Leavitt remarks about the emergence of cargo cults as a response to political domination here:\n\nThe Europeans who arrived did not share the same view of how relationships are built. They had control over extremely attractive material goods, but they refused to enter into proper exchange relations with the local people. Instead, they instituted colonial control and acted as superiors. Some anthropologists have argued, then, that the Papa New Guinean preoccupation with cargo is a way of rebuilding a sense of independence and prestige in the face of colonial rule. (Spradley & McCurdy 1997:338)\n\nThis example clearly illustrates how people may react to cultural domination and colonial rule. Graffiti, therefore, is a cultural response to opposing ideologies; the graffiti artist \"underdog\", however, must convey dissatisfaction in a passive and harmless, but, resistant manner. This raises the question as to whether or not the political opposition conveyed through graffiti is just an American form of resistance to the dominant culture? Rather, the graffiti movement has become a global form of expression that often highlights the political unrest felt by certain members within a culture.\n\nIn Paraguay, for example, graffiti has been a critical medium by which political communication occurs. Under authoritarian rule, Paraguay has suffered extreme times of censorship and thus, the people have registered their anti-sentiments in public displays of art — namely graffiti. Lyman Chaffee (1990) has investigated the extent to which graffiti plays a part in Paraguay's political culture. Though his findings were geared towards the impact that graffiti has on Paraguay's political power struggle, he did argue that graffiti, in essence, is a popular form of resistance among youth culture. Chaffee explores why graffiti has gained popularity and the innate ability to promote cohesiveness when he remarks:\n\nGraffiti writing is one of the easiest and most efficient ways for individuals and opposing groups to register political dissidence, express social alienation, propagate anti-system ideas, and establish an alternative collective memory. Groups can use graffiti to push their agendas or generally to make their presence felt, for it is an extremely easy means of communicating ideas and establishing a collective identity with the masses by putting a government on notice that anti-system sentiments exist with a definite historical memory. Given by the circumstances of doctoral regimes, graffiti communication can be, if recognized by groups and if organized sufficiently, an important medium for breaking the dominant control and censorship which authoritarian governments exercise. (Chaffee 1990:127)\n\nGraffiti, as a type of discourse, therefore, may achieve many goals. The \"in your face\" method of presentation, boldly projects the animosity and/or neglect that a particular group of people may feel. It is possible for a number of people to join forces in their struggle and statement without knowing each other personally. Through this graffiti, writers have created an identity; grounded in resistance to a dominant system, artists share graffiti as an expressive form by which to communicate social unrest. The \"walls\" upon which graffiti is written remain a public forum by which many individuals are both reaffirmed of their anti-structural sentiments as well as given an opportunity to voice their opinion.\n\nLila Abu-Lughod develops this idea of a \"Discourse of Anti-Structure\" in her book about Bedouin women title Veiled Sentiments. Abu-Lughod discusses many different types of discourse in Bedouin society, each of these means of expression serve a different function. Lughod generally defines discourse as a formalized type of communication in which emotional sentiments are conveyed through an expressive medium.\n\nNegative sentiments that challenge the \"status quo\" and the core ethics of a society are called \"Discourses of Anti-Structure\". In reference to the Bedouin emphasis placed on autonomy and honor, Lughod explains that ginnahwas (short love poems) are used to express feelings of love and desire. However, as she candidly remarks, discourses of anti-structure draw upon a commonly shared negative sentiment about the social world — the attachment to other people through this discourse eases, as well as, extinguishes any physical desire to act upon it. Therefore, the ginnahwas are a form of expression by which men in the Bedouin society may convey an emotion that is not socially accepted; if a man expresses love for a woman, he both dishonors his family, as well as, himself and consequently loses his autonomy. Then how does thin man maintain a positive social identity? How does act upon these feelings without disgracing himself? And similarly, since graffiti stands as an expression of emotion, how do these participants do so collectively and in public without actively threatening their own name or the dominant culture which within they have established an identity?\n\nGraffiti may be understood as a discourse of anti-structure; a passive resistance to social complacency and the elitist dictation of public space, graffiti challenges the core ethics to our culture without actively posing a threat to its dominant ideology. Abu-Lughod refers to Michael Meeker's work with poetry in the Bedouin community; his findings illustrated the undeniable link between poetry and its purpose. Lughod quotes Meeker's claim here:\n\nBedouin words, far more than Bedouin actions, were the center of an effort to work out the various possibilities and impossibilities of uncertain political relationships. These words reveal systematic strategies for putting together a kind of political order in spite of uncertain political relationships. From the forms of a Bedouin voice, one can begin to understand with some precision the shape of a Bedouin experience. (Lughod 1979:27)\n\nRelevant to American society, graffiti serves a similar purpose as Bedouin poetry; the writing on the wall is like poetry, sentiments about a cultural system are put forth in society and through their passive nature, implicitly question societal norms.\n\nThis type of passive resistance gives a minority within a culture a voice. However, I am hard pressed to say that the act of doing graffiti or reciting Bedouin poetry is not pleasurable in its own right. Many anthropologists have also commented on this type of pleasure associated with writing; though the pleasure may explored psychologically as a \"risk\" behavior, it is more important now to just mention that the pleasure does in fact exist. Anthropologically speaking, the excitement that the writers experience through doing graffiti is a characteristic that brings to the surface a common theme in our social world. The behavior of graffiti artists is representative of the dissatisfaction with a state of existence; it may be said that graffiti artists enjoy their trade due to its rebellious nature, as well as, its inherent ability to communicate a message of distaste. Ian Maxwell highlights this appeal here:\n\nGraffiti is, of course, largely illegal. Its outlaw status constitutes no small part of its appeal: stories of close calls with the Graffiti Task Force (\"the Graft Squad\", or \"the Transits\" as they are known by writers) abound. Writers recount with evident pleasure the tingle of illicit excitement as a piece is put up, late at night, in a suburban train yard, the unavoidable rattle of the metal mixing ball inside the spraycan and the tell-tale hissing of the application threatening to give them away. They proudly display old scars from climbing barbed wire fences, crawling through drains. (Maxwell 1997:50)\n\nIt is clear that there exists a link between the act of doing graffiti and our social world; the pleasure inherent in conscious illegal behavior may be a way by which we can understand a part of youth culture. It seems as though graffiti may be a reaction that promotes a shared ideology of contempt, resistance, and political dissatisfaction. Understanding that this graffiti is not the act of one individual, but rather, is seen as a movement and matter of representation and identity will help society, as well as, anthropologists engage the idea that graffiti is only one type of discourse by which these negative sentiments are expressed.\n\nGraffiti as Extreme Resistance: Anarchism\n\nMany authors, including Ferrell (1993), have interpreted the rebellious nature of graffiti as a type of anarchist resistance. Graffiti can naturally be viewed as a contemporary type of expressive opposition to authority; though each individual graffito contains a complex message of its own, there is the simple, implicit assumption that every graffito opposes authority. Ferrell outlines the different aspects of graffiti that define it as a type of anarchism; first, he argues, that graffiti may be considered anarchy due to \"adrenaline rush\" that is experienced by graffiti artists while engage in the illicit behavior. \"The adrenaline rush of graffiti writing — the moment of illicit pleasure that emerges from the intersection of creativity and illegality — signifies a resistance to authority, a resistance experienced as much in the pit of the stomach as in the head\" (Ferrell 1993:172).\n\nThe second defining element of graffiti that filters its ideological base towards anarchism lies in the fact that graffiti is a creative and stylistic means through which a message of resistance is conveyed. There is a dimension of graffiti that will be addressed later that indicates the emphasis placed on creativity and style. Graffiti writers, therefore, can be considered artists, whose message is conveyed through artistic expression that promotes spontaneity, individuality and creative thought. Ferrell summarizes this argument when he says, \"Without the spark of playful creativity, resistance becomes another drudgery, reproducing in its seriousness the structures of authority it seeks to undermine\" (Ferrell 1993:173).\n\nFerrell indicates another aspect of graffiti that may be used to define this expressive act as a type of resistance in that within its nature, graffiti is unpredictable and mysterious; when and where graffiti may next be found is a question that will forever remain unanswerable. The lack of predictability inherent in graffiti's nature makes it a threat to those in authority; most graffiti is done whenever the artist feels an urge to 'create'. This lack of a linear, pre-ordained time schedule removes the graffiti artist from the mass society, in turn, making not only their mode of expression an act of anti-social ideology, but also, their behavior a piece of resistance-oriented social commentary.\n\nFinally, Ferrell identifies, what I and many others would propose as the most significant feature of graffiti; graffiti inherently maintains a position that opposes the authoritative, dominant, and hierarchically structured capitalist society in which we live. Graffiti shows up when, where, and how it wants; the graffiti artist, in fact, breaks down the 'walls' between the people and their environment. This is exactly what is anthropologically significant; graffiti, in its nature, is a reflection on the relationship between people and their environment. A testimony to an aspect of culture, the spontaneity with which graffiti is created gives us insight as to the people that do it; though the graffitist's behavior sporadic, his/her message remains the same. Graffiti artists contest the elitist control of the fate of our society's living environment. Ferrell summarizes this argument when he says:\n\nGraffiti writing breaks the hegemonic hold of corporate/governmental style over the urban environment and the situations of daily life. As a form of aesthetic sabotage, it interrupts the pleasant, efficient uniformity of \"planned\" urban space and predictable urban living. For the writers, graffiti disrupts the lived experience of mass culture, the passivity of mediated consumption. (Ferrell 1993:176)\n\nThus, graffiti, in of itself, is a type of discourse that lends us to many different paths of exploration. On the one hand, the behavior of the graffiti artist remains a mystery to many of us; a psychological exploration of the intrinsic pleasures of its creation may only be understood through speaking with those people who engage in the behavior. This is where the anthropological perspective becomes significant. Through ethnographic research and personal graffiti narratives, it will be possible to uncover many of the underlying motivations for the behavior and also illuminate how graffiti implicitly comments on contemporary culture and the people who create it.\n\nGraffiti and its Relationship to Contemporary American Culture\n\nIn light of the rebellious and political nature of this type of communication, it is significant to mention what audience graffiti artists are trying to reach through their pieces. Previously, I have addressed the issue of graffiti culture and it is again important to highlight the key features of this community, which separate it, and distinguish it, from all other sub-cultures in the American culture from which it is born.\n\nTraditionally, anthropological research, which identified and indicated the presence of a culture, was based on 'field-work', a method by which anthropologists would actively participate in a culture in order to understand it. Therefore, culture was traditionally viewed as different, exotic, and misunderstood; the search for the 'Other' was the mission of the motivated anthropologist. Graffiti, as defined as a subculture, innately constructed as a reaction to the larger American culture, will be explored through methods of participant-observation and fieldwork. Only then, will it be possible to define graffiti artists as members of a particular community. Speaking with a number of different graffiti artists will inevitably give me a deeper perspective on the material, expressive, and communicative aspects of the culture that they create.\n\nThe question of whether or not the graffiti community may be defined as a culture of its own is a difficult issue. Many anthropologists would argue that graffiti is a community that only exists as a reaction to a larger culture; without its social context upon which it is built, it would be difficult to argue that this group would exist. In other words, the message, behavior, and implications of graffiti would not exist if it were not based in American culture. The particular social statement that graffiti makes within our culture would be insignificant if it were interpreted in a different social context; American graffiti is a reaction to American culture. Therefore, in light of this clarification, I will define graffiti and its artists as a culture for the reason that other words like 'subculture' and 'micro-culture' connotes a negative, subordinate image of this community. I will not use the word 'community' to define graffiti artists due to the geographical diversity from which the artists live; geographic proximity is one defining characteristic of a community. Thus, I have settled on the word 'culture' as a reference tool when addressing the act and participation of individuals in a shared behavior — graffiti. Susan Phillips also addresses other significant factors that will help clarify why 'culture' may be an appropriate term in the discussion of graffiti.\n\nPhillips asserts, \"How do we define culture in a globally linked world, where Westernized consumerism is spreading like wildfire through our sagebrush mountainsides\" (Phillips, 1999: 45). Phillips answers, \"One way is to look at the mechanisms people use to distinguish themselves from one another\" (Phillips, 1999: 45). Therefore, it can be argued that what defines a culture is, in essence, exactly what distinguishes one culture from another. Thus, graffiti culture can not be identified by a style of dress, geographical location, ethnic or racial heritage, but rather, graffiti artists 'represent' themselves, and identify with one another through names and writing style. Ethnographic anthropology is pinpointed at representing 'the Other'; whether it be through film, literature, or photography, and ethnography serves to illustrate the importance of a cultures behavior not only to themselves, but also, to those that surround them. In regard to graffiti culture, it can be said that in essence, graffiti artists share a common medium and behavior; they paint on walls and the inherent meaning of their message, is conveyed through a distinct and particular language that is only understood by those who are part of the graffiti culture.\n\nThis graffiti culture that has evolved in American society is often socially romanticized; many common stereotypes depict the graffiti artist as socially inept, rebellious, and disrespectful. It is possible, however, that these stereotypes are based on an innate human rationale, 'the fear of the unknown'. Because graffiti writing on buildings, walls, and public space is not primarily geared to the pervasive American culture, the message being conveyed remains meaningless and frustrating for those who may not understand it. Phillips describes the intended purpose of graffiti here:\n\nGraffiti allows people to create identity, share cultural values, redefine spaces, and manufacture inclusive or exclusive relationships. But because of its illegal aspect, graffiti both creates and reflects alienation. Oftentimes, this is secondary to the graffiti writer's primary objective, which is communication to his or her own group. James Scott (1985, 1990) has written extensively about forms of resistance, ways of indirectly confronting the dominating class. Graffiti can also act like what Scott calls a 'transcript' (hidden or open), which, with a little prodding in right areas, can reveal power relations at its base. (Phillips 1999: 46)\n\nIt is clearly evident through this understanding that graffiti writers use public space to communicate a message that is intended for a small cultural group. As Phillips and many other published researchers have noted, \"Graffiti has traditionally been viewed as the product of people who have little representation within the traditional mass media\" (Phillips 1999: 46). Here, Phillips argues that this form of expression, like many other communicative conventions serves a two-fold purpose. On the one hand, graffiti has the ability to convey a message to a selective group, while simultaneously, making a social commentary about the lack of the lack of acknowledgment graffiti culture receives in contemporary society. Reisner and Wechsler, authors of the Encyclopedia of Graffiti, reaffirm Phillips's claim in this passage:\n\nGraffitists are people who do not have any other outlet for their thoughts. They are not in the media; they do not express themselves before the public in any way. (Reisner & Wechsler 1974:vi)\n\nOther people who have studied graffiti have also come across a similar trend; the main purpose of graffiti is to earn 'respect' within the graffiti community, while consequently making a social statement in order to gain recognition in the media. Ferrell has interviewed a 'famed' graffiti artist under the tag of 'Eye Six' about the motivation and intended audience of graffiti. Ferrell concluded that graffiti writers share a common purpose, \"Though they may hope that a piece will be seen and appreciated by the public, they can be sure that it will be seen and evaluated by members of the subculture\" (Ferrell, 1993: 51).\n\nWhat has come of graffiti since this literature challenged the public understanding of the graffiti culture? Since Ferrell (1993) offered insight as to the aesthetic side of the graffiti image, what social influences have helped shaped the \"face\" of the graffiti image as we see it today? Benedict Anderson (1983) and Manuel Castells (1997a, b) have acknowledged the current state of culture in both the modern, and post-modern, periods respectively. A notion of an \"imagined community\", as coined by Anderson (1983), has generated a more comprehensive analysis of how graffiti flexed its muscles during the modern period, as the graffiti artists themselves, contributed to a sharing of ideals, values, purpose, and behavior, during a crucial time of \"identity\" crises in America.\n\nCastells (1997a, b) post-dated the work of Anderson, however, in theory, Castells' notion of \"identity\" streamlined directly from the point at where modernity ended and the point of post-modernity began. Castells developed theory concerning the power of the image, and in the case of graffiti, the image on the wall, and presently, the graffiti immortalized on the Internet have maintained a social and cultural value similar to that which Castells predicted. It is this \"face\" of graffiti, both on the Internet and undeniably on the streets on which we travel daily, that is the medium for which graffiti makes its mark. Whether it is on canvas or cement, public or private, graffiti has undergone a development that has culminated in the \"face\" which appears in our contemporary experience. It is through the contributions of these last two authors, when juxtaposed with Hebdige's (1979) theory of \"recuperation\", that a more clear understanding of how graffiti has become part of contemporary culture will surface. Graffiti has been appropriated the power to affect the daily experience of those individuals who come in contact with the graffiti image, and these findings are what will become the focal point of this thesis.\n\nIt is my hope, that through reading this thesis, the reader will come away with a greater appreciation of the artists involved in graffiti writing. Though their presence may often been look upon as a social nuisance, it is significant that their behavior may be viewed as a 'glimpse into contemporary American culture'. Graffiti culture is a testimony to the idealism shared by many resistance groups, the rebellious message regarding the control of public space, and the culturally constructed reception of graffiti as art and the people who create it.\n\nChapter 2\n\nSymbols of Resistance: Private Art and Public Consumption\n\nSymbols lie at the core of every culture. Objects or behaviors that contain a shared meaning between members of a culture, symbols contain the ability to unify people through a common understanding. Kottak explains, \"A symbol is something verbal or nonverbal, within a particular language or culture, that comes to stand for something else.\" He continues, \"There is no obvious, natural, or necessary connection between the symbol and what it symbolizes\" (Kottak 1996:25). In the case of graffiti, the 'writings on the wall' have stood as symbols of resistance and a general discontent with contemporary social realities and the 'status-quo'. Graffiti and art alike are the epitome of implied symbolism and as Kottak clarifies, \"As is true of all symbols, the association between a symbol (water) and what is symbolized (holiness) is arbitrary and conventional\" (Kottak 1996:25).\n\nThis arbitrary association is the reason why graffiti is indicative of resistance in popular culture. Although the cryptically constructed letters may often disguise the verbal message of graffiti, its identification in contemporary culture as a symbol for resistance is universally understood. Kottak continues to explain the significance of the symbol to culture in this passage:\n\nFor hundreds of thousands of years, people have shared the abilities on which culture rests. These abilities are to learn, to think symbolically, to manipulate language, and to use tools and other cultural products in organizing their lives and coping with their environments. Every contemporary human population has the ability to symbol and thus to create and maintain culture. (Kottak 1996:26)\n\nImages on the wall, which are viewed by people in their daily lives, stand as a symbol of resistance. Every person in our society helps create contemporary culture, and by doing so, people construct the framework by which symbolic meaning is possible. Symbols are manifestations of an ability to communicate effectively, and in particular, graffiti is only one symbol, which is part of a greater symbolic system — contemporary American culture. Graffiti is equated to resistance through the essence of cultural communication — the symbol. WAX emphasized the importance of graffiti as a means of communication for its intended audience:\n\nGraffiti…it's an identity among other graffiti artists or gang members… besides that, I don't think it means much unless you know each other… if you put your tag on the wall and someone sees it — they know who that person is. Sometimes, They'll put their crew next to their own tag and their crew name to let people know who they're affiliated with. (WAX, January, 2001)\n\nBeing recognized, famed, and admired are only a few of the many motivations of the graffiti artist. His interest in establishing a known identity through the ability to symbol is initially directed towards the graffiti community. There are circumstances in which graffiti artists seek social approval and recognition, although, these acknowledgments are secondary in the graffiti culture.\n\nArtists like WAX are more inclined to seek approval by their peers rather than their parents. However, as graffiti increases in popularity amongst people both young and old, it appears as though graffiti is beginning to move away from its structural roots in resistance. This shows how graffiti is a malleable symbol, and like Holy Water, the ideological and theoretical meaning that the object (water or graffiti) suggest was once adopted by a small group of people. Following this, the symbol was slowly integrated into popular culture, representative of a meaning that may be different from its original use. This chapter will explore how this symbol is created by popular culture, consumed by popular culture, and integrated into the greater symbolic system of an ever-growing global culture. By examining how graffiti, as a symbol, is constructed, used, and perceived by people, it will be possible to gain greater insight as to the intricate and complex nature of American culture.\n\nSymbols are an imperative feature to any culture. Graffiti is a symbol that enables communication between cultural groups — breaking down language, ideological, and political barriers, which impeded communication between groups. Graffiti, when understood as a symbol, is a particular feature of American culture that has generated interest due to both its undeniable presence in the public arena, as well as, its adoption by the middle-class youth of America. However, it is impossible to understand graffiti in of itself — its birth is in a larger cultural web, and so, its understanding may only come from an analysis that considers this cultural birth.\n\nThe dominant American culture can be viewed as a finished painting. Paints of a multitude of colors are layered in spots, dots, and lines. These marks on the canvas when viewed alone can only be understood as to what they truly are, a spot, a dot, or a line. When viewed in terms of their relationship to one another, relative position on the canvas, and magnitude or significance within the greater picture, the markings begin to take on meaning. In combination with one another, these structural elements are consolidated in what is seen as the painting. The spots, dots, and lines are analogous to the subcultures of America. Graffiti, as one of these subcultures, also contains various levels of culture within it. Thus, graffiti as a symbol of resistance used by gangs will be discussed. A communicative convention of opposing groups, graffiti became visible in the public arena. Increased visibility of this symbol, combined with the development of the aesthetic image followed graffiti's adoption by the middle-class youth of America. With this shift of participants and purpose, graffiti changed its \"face\" for the first, but not the last, time in the public arena.\n\nGang Graffiti\n\nGang culture is increasingly studied by anthropologists in recent years due to the growing social concerns of gang violence, gang warfare, and the underlying political threat of gang politics to the larger American political system. Susan Phillips (1999) has done extensive fieldwork in Los Angeles, CA, as well as in other gang inhabited cities, concerning the systematic, political, and symbolic representation and construction of various gangs. Similar to other groups formed out of necessity, gang members often find a socially recognized identity through gang membership when otherwise ostracized from the 'social norm' and popular culture. Gangs are dependent upon the larger context from which they are born. The values, politics and culture of gangs is a structural and systematic reaction to often depraved social conditions and, in particular, a lack of representation within the greater American culture. Phillips (1999) clarifies the development of gangs in this passage:\n\nGangs are socially constructed entities. Their existence is inextricably linked to the larger society's politics, its skewed relations of power, the limited access to its economic resources, and the systematic persecution and exclusion of certain populations from participation within it. It represents perhaps a form of what Turner (1969) controversially referred to as \"antistructure\": the antithesis of the larger system, its polar opposite and the thing that ultimately reinforces the place of each. (Phillips, 1999: )\n\nConstraints on economic resources, social acceptance and the lack of social recognition fuel the formation of gangs. Gangs are constructed upon a need for community, brotherhood, respect, and most importantly, the need for the individual to maintain a sense of identity. Contemporary politics and the exclusive/inclusive nature of the class system in America has streamlined certain individuals to gang culture. Gang affiliation and membership is a resistance to the 'status-quo'; this subculture is structurally indicative of popular culture, but similarly stands strong against the exclusive principles of contemporary society. In other words, initiation and acceptance into a gang indicates a life-long commitment and dedication to a particular way of life, a type of honor and devotion to a system that stands as a resistant measure to the personal rejection and the unfortunate failure of the American social system. Phillips expresses the essence of gang resistance when she states:\n\nGangs oppose the system without doing so in an overtly political manner. In this respect they are perhaps more clever than we might think — because no movement that is overt can wrestle with the power of the global corporate politic and the machinations of the modern state. The only \"revolution\" that can happen today is one that happens incidentally. Indeed, it has already taken place among those decentered populations that have been forced to radically shift their social and political affiliations just to survive. The affirmation of their separateness from the larger social conditions that have excluded them is relevant only secondarily to the internal relationships that carry greater weight in their daily concerns. In their apolitical relationship to the dominant society, gangs have found their politicization. Without confronting them directly, gangs have successfully threatened the dominant social and legal systems of the United States. (Phillips 1999:92)\n\nIt is understood that a gang symbolizes a resistance to the American social norm. A reaction to the exclusive nature of the United States social system, gangs seem to be a symbol of resistance — a subsequent culture that creates and integrates its own symbolic system into the greater American culture. This resistance is identical to that which graffiti initially opposed. A symbol that visually displayed these sentiments expressed in the preceding passage, graffiti was a way that both gangs and other members of society anonymously opposed the social system from which they were ostracized. Spradley and McCurdy (1997) summarized research conducted by William Beeman about American resistance movements, identifying the cause, effect, and symbolic nature of these revitalization in this passage:\n\nWhen one cultural group becomes dominated by another, resulting rapid change and loss of authority may make its original meaning system seem thin, ineffective, and contradictory. The resulting state of deprivation often causes members to rebuild their culture along what they consider to be more satisfying lines. The process, which is called revitalization by anthropologists, has occurred over and over again among peoples throughout the world. Often couched in religious terms, movements prescribe rituals and beliefs designed to restore order to their existence. (Spradley & McCurdy 1997:330)\n\nGangs have integrated aspects of the dominant American culture in their inherent structure and organization. However, like other revitalization movements, gangs have adopted practices, values, and ethics, which are more applicable to their immediate situation and life.\n\nIt is important to recognize the ability of gangs to establish a sense of community, brotherhood, and family, before exploring the subsequent use of graffiti as a symbol identifying unity and ownership. Gangs can be viewed as a symbol for family, integrating kinship relations that denote honor, respect, admiration, and subsequent power and authority. Every gang has a name by which it \"represents\" itself and the members of a particular gang will refer to their group as their \"family\". Members of a particular gang often refer to their friends as either \"brotha\" or \"sista\" when not using a particular individual's nickname. Nicknames are another way by which a gang member may be identified; the often humorous nature of the name is evidence of the comfort and security in their identity, which is a result of gang membership.\n\nHowever, gangs do differ from traditional kinship relations in a significant way. It is rare for a member to be addressed by his/her birth name. The subsequent anonymity implicit in this gang specific behavior is a testimony to the core values of the gang. Resisting traditional mannerisms by the use of nicknames, gangs promote unity in their purpose. Members are initiated into the family and thereby are given a nickname which indicates their similarity and brotherhood to those around them. The gang name is established as their family name and shared identity. A gang is a community, a family, and a culture which offers its members both security and protection, not only from a dominant parent culture, but also, from other gangs and groups which have arisen out of similar conditions.\n\nThe community, territory and boundaries established by gangs are not marked by what would be considered \"traditional\" methods. Due to the lack of social recognition, gangs have been forced to create a symbolic system which is created by and solely contended for communication between different gangs. Any given city may be inhabited by numerous gangs, and the close proximity with which they reside often results in a continuous battle for land ownership and living space. Contrary to much of what the general public may assume, gangs do not always resolve these territorial disputes through violence. Rather, the violent gang wars are often only a physical manifestation of the lack of communication evident in our country. Gangs fighting each other can be seen as a symbol of misdirected anger of American citizens in a depraved economic and social condition.\n\nGangs, in their inherent structure and communal nature, integrate a symbolic system as an initial response to territorial disputes. Gang graffiti, as mentioned earlier, is quite different than what would be considered as \"popular\" or \"hip-hop\" graffiti, due to its simplicity of style and unity of color. The latter genre of graffiti, identified by its cryptic lettering and barrage of visually stimulating colors, will be explored in greater depth later in this thesis as its form, purpose, and style are a type of graffiti which developed out of gang graffiti. Ideology and purpose were lost in this adaptation, and through this, a new \"face\" of graffiti developed. D-CON affirms the discrepancy between these two art forms, maintaining the argument that society confuses the two types of graffiti even when there are distinct differences between them.\n\nA lot of people confuse gangsters with graffiti artists. They call graffiti — gang art, and that's not what it is… gangsters don't do colorful artwork… (laughing)… gangsters just catch a quick gangster tag on there and put a number 13 on the end to let you know that they're gang-bangers. (D-CON, January, 2001)\n\nFor D-CON and many other graffiti artists, there remains a bitter taste towards the notion that their \"art\" would be considered gang art. On a number of occassions, other informants remarked in a similar manner. WAX, explaining the essence of this confusion between crews and gangs, empathizes with the popular misunderstanding of their separate purposes. However, WAX remarks:\n\nCrews do a lot of gang behavior…y'know, they depict stereotypical gang behavior. At least that's all that's been heard about them in the public and popular media. You never hear anything good about crews… gangs do graffiti that is more broad… it covers a larger territory… crews are about getting up… they're about getting their name out. (WAX, January, 2001)\n\nThis insight identifies a common theme in popular society by which the public often categorizes and groups individuals together for need to exhibit control around the surrounding environment. In other words, common social psychological thought that there is an innate human tendency which argues that people necessitate control over their environment for the sake of psychological comfort and emotional ease. By doing so, it may be argued, that the need which drives these members of popular culture to lump together different individuals under one category, is a similar need by which drives both graffiti artists and gang members to attempt to manufacture a degree of control over in an environment in which they feel none.\n\nThis thought helps us empathize with the shared human condition that makes individuals act in a particular expressive manner. However, this argument also promotes a greater appreciation, though not necessarily an approval, of other members in society who have found different outlets to manifest their inner frustration. It is evident, that there is a similarity which binds the two graffiti forms together, and this similarity is interwoven in the web of the human condition. Within this surface similarity are particular differences that separate the two genres of graffiti from each other — these differences are distinct and identifiable through both the group structure responsible for the graffiti and the graffiti itself. WAX, though not a member of a gang, helps explain his experience with the type of structural differences he has come to understand in his experience with crews, and the familiarity of gang presence in New York City:\n\nThe main difference between gangs and crews is that gangs are organized. There is a type of structure, like an agenda they follow… like certain territory or structure that they care about. A crew is just like a bunch of people who hang out together… they just do everything together. (WAX, January, 2001)\n\nThis depiction of gang graffiti, the meaning and purpose motivating its use, is affirmed through past fieldwork (Phillips 1999), as well as, through the present interviewee responses. Not only do gangs differ in their structure and purpose, but the consequent symbols used by either group, are intended for consumption by separate groups and for separate reasons.\n\nGraffiti functions for gangs on many different levels. First, as a boundary marker, gang symbols in the form of graffiti are seen on stores, walls, alleys and corners, reminding enemies \"Beware\" and \"Caution\". Though the graffiti do not spell out these admonitions, the mere presence of the gang's chosen color and abbreviated family name function as a clear warning. Frequently, in disputed areas, two or more gang names may be present on a wall or building. Crossed out, scribbled over, and defaced, these graffiti are evidence of the symbolic communication through which gang members may communicate without verbal or physical encounters.\n\nUsually, crews (name) are two to four letters long and then you put a K at the end to denote that it's a crew and not a gang or anything else… y'know, because gangsters have their own way of writing things to let you know that they're gangsters and crews have their own way of writing things to let you know they're graffiti artists. (D-CON, January, 2001)\n\nThese symbols are a shared identity that any member may tag; a sense of pride, unity, respect and fear are many of the cohesive bonds promoted by gang representation. A communal bond is formed through graffiti's symbolic meaning. However, there is a paradox that lies at the core of gang graffiti's intended message.\n\nThough a gang is an organization formed upon resistance and the idea of 'safety in numbers', the meaning enclosed in gang graffiti is one that stresses a dichotomy between those people who are a part of the 'in' group, and those individuals who are part of the 'out' group. Exclusion from dominant society is a primary factor as to the reason why gangs are formed, and in the creation of these 'members only' organizations, gangs have created a social system, which promotes the type of exclusive atmosphere that they are resisting. Symbolism manifests itself in material culture, as gang members often 'represent' their colors in uniform style dress, family name, graffiti style, and geographic location. Graffiti, in turn, for gangs is a symbol of resistance to popular culture, although, it remains to be a question as to what social or political rhetoric is the focus of this resistance. Viewed as a sub-cultural entity, the entire gang system and its use of graffiti as a representation of identity may be considered a form of resistance to the dominant American society.\n\nOnly through this holistic analysis is it possible to appreciate the purpose that graffiti serves to the gang community. Although each gang may be an exclusive group, the production and consumption of gang graffiti for the sake of symbolic representation is solely directed towards other surrounding gangs. The exclusive social world which gangs have created out of the greater American society is indeed private, although, this sub-cultural system only remains private to the institution responsible for necessitating this particular lifestyle. Gangs, and subsequently the use of graffiti as an exclusive form of symbolic communication, have used public space to create a private community.\n\nPrivate vs. Public Space Explored\n\nI think it's a resistance to corporate America and all these people that say… y'know, this is the way it should be. You need to get a job, and do this and do that… it's definitely a resistance movement — it's a defensive identity. it's a way of standing back and being like, I'm not part of this society, y'know… that condones X, Y, and Z… (D-CON, January, 2001)\n\nGang graffiti, among other genres of graffiti, make use of public space as a medium upon which a symbolic message is conveyed. In doing so, graffiti transforms what was once public space into a private canvas upon which an individual chooses the image to be displayed. In the 1970's and 1980's, New York City subway cars and passenger trains were transformed into canvases for graffiti artists. Considered as an act of vandalism and an \"eyesore\", opposition arose to this public form of expression. However, the anti-graffiti movement, and its support by the general public and political parties only heightened the excitement and increased the enjoyment felt by many early graffiti artists. When asked to describe the essence of public versus private space, in an attempt to understand how the graffiti artist may define these conditions, WAX responded:\n\nPublic… in graffiti, is basically anywhere you can get in trouble for doing it… y'know, like a public apartment building — you can't just spray there without worrying about getting caught. As far as private space… well, I know some kids who had my boys do the inside of their house and… if you saw on MTV CREWS, Outkast had a mural thrown up in their garage — I thought that was pretty cool. (WAX, January, 2001)\n\nThrough this statement, it may be understood that graffiti defines what is public and what may be considered private space; the threat of being 'caught out' plays a dual role in graffiti. Not only does the anxiety of being caught increase the addrenalin rush felt by the graffiti artist, but it also, as the amount of anxiety is inextricably linked to the danger of the 'spot', designates the type of respect that is to be given to a particular artist for his/her dedication. WAX continues to explain this idea further in this excerpt:\n\nThe public space is… public space like walls is definitely important for graffiti, because a lot of people do graffiti for fame and to get noteriety… so people will be like… I saw your shit up. Or, it's like marking your presence… getting your name up or whatever… so it has to be public space. (WAX, January, 2001)\n\nDetermined to get their name up and visible, graffiti artists have also moved towards 'hittin' up' spots that are visible, and consistently viewed by the public on a daily basis — billboards. Billboards, buildings, and sidewalks became a medium through which graffiti artists expressed their opposition to the public control of space. Though the actual content of the \"piece\" did not express anti-capitalist sentiment, nor did it openly contest the public control of space, the underlying message conveyed in the graffiti is one that is defiant, and critical of society's complacency and acceptance of elitist control over public space. Eye Six, quoted in Ferrell (1990), explains just how upsetting the passivity evident in public consumption is to him, legitimizing graffiti through its active defiance and public forum in which it is exhibited.\n\nYour average person is just subservient to whatever is thrown up. Whatever building in built, whatever billboard is put up — whatever. They just sit on their asses; they pretty much go with the flow like all sheep do…. At least we act on our feelings. We don't just sit around and doodle in our houses, we go out and get paint. (Ferrell 1993:10)\n\nIt is not the purpose of this quote to identify the general consensus of the entire graffiti population in regard to their view of popular society. Rather, it is important to appreciate this insight in terms of its individual expression of frustration on behalf of one graffiti artist about the public control of space and the lack of social action confronting this lack of power. This lack of control has also been affirmed through members of the general public who have chosen to speak out against the inextricable link between corporate America and the control of public space.\n\nIt has been argued that billboards and other forms of advertising that manifest themselves materially in popular culture are similar in nature to graffiti. In essence, the graffiti artist attempts to take something that they that consider ugly, and through their addition, make it visually pleasing. D-CON maintains this belief with a brief anecdote.\n\nWe'd paint on a wall and… we'd be like, this wall is ugly before we start, and once we got up there, y'know… we'd be like now this looks a lot better. But, obviously the Freeway Commission didn't seem to agree with us too much on that…(laughing)… (D-CON, January, 2001)\n\nThe common citizen has no choice as to the content, placement, message, meaning, or psychological implications. However, due to the \"socialized\" method by which these advertisements are presented, there is a lack of contest in their dominating presence in the everyday social world of most Americans. Luna (1995) indicates his distaste with corporate America, as well as, the categorization of graffiti as vandalism. This vandalism, he expresses, is inherent in billboards and public forms of advertising; the hypocrisy that he advocates is evident in this passage:\n\nBut let's take a step back and reconsider the whole question of 'urban blight' from a new perspective. Couldn't we say that advertisements 'assault our eyes', that they are every bit as much, if not more, a part of this blight than the illegitimate graffiti with which they compete for our attention. If we don't think about it too hard, we can explain public advertisements away as so much 'filler' in our daily routine: we're always just driving by the billboard to get where we really want to be. But if we consider the question more deeply, we will realize that we never just pass anything, that we climb the mountain, not just to be on top, but for the process of climbing itself…and that there are a lot of billboards on the way up this mountain, which, like Tantalus, we are forever scaling. We dwell with these billboards and they subject our senses and intellect to a number of different responses; they engage us without consent and create needs that can only be met through consumption. (Luna 1995:4)\n\nNot all forms of graffiti carry the weight of this resistance message, as it is evident, through the graffiti appearing in \"legal yards\" that there are some writers who do not choose to undermine their \"art\" through a violation of public law and policy. However, the historical roots of graffiti are found in a cultural movement opposing the control of public space. Earlier representations of graffiti by gangs were transformed into the more artistically motivated graffiti seen today. The underlying message conveyed in the act of writing graffiti is illegal, and so, the act implicitly promotes a resistance to those people who oppose it. WAX added insight as to the reason why many graffiti artists choose to do graffiti:\n\nI know a lot of people who do it just cause you're not supposed to do it… y'know… they do it just for the thrill of doing it and not getting caught or, because of the rush they get from the chase. (WAX, January, 2001)\n\nIt is only through the voice of these graffiti artists that it is truly possible to make the connection between the negative feelings that are felt by some of the participants and the behavior that is a manifestation of their discontent. This, in turn, is the essence of anthropological fieldwork — the voice of individuals within a particular culture are heard. This feeling of resistance is again conveyed through the testimony of other artists; SCHMOO, an active participant in the graffiti culture, indicates one of his primary frustrations that has led him to engage in graffiti writing in the following excerpt from an interview:\n\nMany people have the urge to write their name places to commemorate being there. People don't get upset when they hear stories of \"Kilroy was Here\" or kids scratching in Janet + Joe on a tree. But somehow when writing gets associated with the city, and kids from all races and backgrounds get together to express themselves in some rebellious way right in the face of everyone, it gets associated with evil. Then officials feel the need to go over graffiti with plain flat paint. The thing that they don't understand is that they are expressing themselves just as much as we are when we put our name or crew up. Unfortunately they don't have the creativity that we do. (ARTCRIMES Q&A, 1994: 6)\n\nGraffiti, through an understanding of SCHMOO's statement, can be viewed as a culturally constructed symbol of resistance. However, the culture from which the symbol has been adopted, is the dominant American culture. Within this system is where the rules prohibiting private construction of public space were created, and, it is within this greater system that graffiti finds its meaning as resistance. Graffiti as a symbol for resistance is solely constructed upon the law and social policy currently in effect within any social system.\n\nWhen the illegal nature of graffiti is removed as is the case, for example, with the advent and increasing popularity of contemporary \"legal yards\", much of the tradition, ritual, and ideological framework upon which this public form of expression is lost. The mere inclination of this loss of tradition and meaning in graffiti has spawned a 'revitalization' movement within the graffiti culture itself; the writers, using contemporary means of communication such as magazines, pamphlets, phone, internet, and even graffiti, have attempted to counter a move towards \"legitimate and legal\" graffiti. The mission statement of a graffiti 'zine' was titled \"The haves will never subdue the public voice\" is supplemented by the dedication written on the adjacent page reads, \"Dedicated To All The Haters\" (The Vapors 2000:4). These sentiments indicate the type of extreme opposition many revivalist graffiti writers are to this slowly developing trend of the commercialization of graffiti art; their dissatisfaction is affirmed in the mission statement which follows:\n\nThey can write their names out of money on their glassy building walls. They can loom over us any damn day they wish and sing little songs that remind us of them everywhere we go. They can do all these things, but the voice of the individual is just footsteps away.\n\nThese footsteps will take you as far as your heart, into more desolate and dangerous places than you ever thought you'd step, just to write your name and let the gods know that you cared. The haves will send armed men after you and the will strike and you must be prepared. But the numbers are on our side. From the highest rooftops to the dank tunnel passageways, we will be heard. And we will scream as loud as we can, because we want you to remember this.\n\nLike reading poetry once written in another language, graffiti loses something in the translation when it tries to win the affection of the haves. It is not to be taken more lightly than weaponry, because that is what it is. Graffiti is our war. Graffiti is not supposed to be there. that's why it works. (The Vapors 2000:4)\n\nIt is here that the 'voice of change' is resisted; graffiti motivated by resistance to public, social, and political policy is starting to lose its significance in the overall graffiti cultural network.\n\nHowever, though there is a small revitalization movement towards context and symbolically based graffiti, the bitterness with which the authors of the aforementioned \"haves\" statement is not representative of a popular view among contemporary artists. Rather, many artists expressed their knowledge as to the significance of resistance in the symbolic nature of graffiti. Resistance as a primary motivation for the display of graffiti has not been lost as a result of this trend. SCHMOO expresses his recognition of graffiti and understanding of its purpose as cultural symbol, indicating that this functional purpose still exists at the core of graffiti, regardless of whether or not rising artists understand this fact. SCHMOO comments, \"Graffiti is meant to be a public display.\" He continues When it is illegal it is a political statement, whether the kid knows it who's doing it or not\" (The Vapors 2000:4). It is at the core of graffiti in which resistance to public control lies. The mere fact that graffiti is written upon a wall without permission and thus, illegally is symbolic of opposition and resistance, will continue to exist. Graffiti is a method of expression, by which, certain groups or individuals resist the privatization of public space. Giller (1997:3) clarifies the contemporary condition of graffiti in the following:\n\nEspousing self-chosen identities, urban youth use graffiti to reclaim and transform the denied space closest to them, the neighborhoods and communities which surround and shape their lives. Employed by those with few avenues for formal arts training and production open to them, graffiti is a visual means of resisting the privatization of public space. These \"parasitic\" art forms create \"openly contested terrains.\" In \"bombing\" as many sites as possible with one's chosen identity, graffiti is art attacking architecture, the marginalized attacking the mainstreatm. In painting your name on a \"public\" space, graffiti writers sybolically take possession of that which society has inaccessible to them. Simply stated, name plus place equal possession. In reappropriating an urban built environment engulfed by skyscrapers and privatized spaces, graffiti is a declaration of identity and an assertion of power. In the middle of spaces that have excluded them, graffiti empowers the marginalized to inscribe signs of their own. (Giller 1997:3)\n\nFor these people, the graffiti artists and those who appreciate graffiti as an art form, this control of public space is only a part of what is core to the meaning of graffiti. Instead, these individuals who appreciate the arts, use graffiti as an artistic symbol by which to construct both an individual, as well as, a group identity in an environment which facilitates pressure against this goal. In other words, many of the youth who participate in graffiti do so by membership in a \"crew\", promoting ideals of group and individual identity through artistic symbolic representation. Though crews may appear to be similar to gangs, as they both consist of individuals who write graffiti, they differ in structure and purpose, offering solutions to the needs of two different groups of people in contemporary American culture.\n\nHip-Hop Graffiti and Contemporary American Culture\n\nIngrained within the walls on which graffiti is written, and expressed through the voices of its participants, the influence of the hip-hop movement, or rather explosion, in America can be understood. With this said, I will now take the time to provide the reader with a brief, but succinct, overview of the link between graffiti and hip-hop, and consequently, attempt to provide the reader with a more complete understanding of how contemporary American culture has come to only embrace the latter of the two movements in corporate and commercial society. SCHMOO offers a definition of hip-hop, further indicating the broad range of expressive mediums of which it embodies:\n\nHip-hop is a movement based around Rap music, breaking and graffiti. It was started in NYC in the early 70's. Each of the art forms has different roots, coming from different cultures. The culture still exists today, it's just not in the mass media like it was during the 80's.\n\n(he continues later in the interview mentioning hip-hop artists)\n\nRappers: Run-DMC, Ice Cube, Public Enemy, KRS-One (Boogie Down Productions). Crazy Legs is the most famous breaker of all time. Naming the most famous writers would be impossible. (AC interview)\n\nIncluding the artists mentioned by SCHMOO, there were a number of other artists who helped 'promote' or further the acceptance of the hip-hop culture in popular culture. In particular, the two films Wild Style and Style Wars are products of the hip-hop culture; both of these films, like pseudo-documentaries, help to highlight the key players in this hip-hop movement and simultaneously use interviews and live footage to emphasize their contribution to the success of this movement. Through networking and research, it was possible to get into contact with one of the many graffiti artists who may now be considered \"veterans of style\". BG 183, a graffiti artist whose taste and talent was generated through the graffiti movement of the early 80's, repeatedly informed me of the dramatic influence of the aforementioned films.\n\nNext, y'know, I started lookin at people like… people like DUSTER, people back then… SEEN, or like… CRASH, DAZE, LEE… these people were like top management. And when I started in the early 80's with people like that… people in, y'know… Wild Style came out the next year and that got me wantin' to write like I seen it in the movies. People getten' busy… like I was already 'bombin', but that movie got me bombin even more. (interview with BG 183, March, 2001)\n\nMedia plays a dynamic role in the internal structure and development of any subcultural system, and this influence, may not be overlooked in regard to the hip-hop movement of the 70's and 80's. The impact of mass-media representation soon became even more evident through an enormous popular interest in this anti-structural method of representation. However, though the general public, including the Mayor of New York City at the time, Ed Koch, may have thought that they understood the underlying motivation behind these \"Art Crimes\", the ethnography of graffiti artists who participated in this cultural power struggle suggest a different notion.\n\nRather, graffiti artists like BG 183 have merely glanced over the \"resistance\" nature that was \"tagged\" on the identity of graffiti artists by the media and capitalist consumers in the mid 80's. Instead, the power of ethnography yields a different primary motivation than that which had been assumed by popular culture. Therefore, the remarks made by BG 183 convey the notion that graffiti was a fun and innovative way by which to display expressive art while simultaneously, through repeated exposure, serve as a means by which to establish an individual, discrete, and creative public identity. Threatened by consummerism and the structural elements of a capitalist society, BG 183 not only states his purpose, but also, indicates a distinct bitterness which he still holds in regard to the misrepresentation of graffiti in popular culture.\n\nOur shit was not to make money. I go out just to paint… Fuck that… if I was going to do like, a painten' job for somebody, I'd rather take all the paint I possibly can and I wouldn't worry about the money… y'know the money was the farthest thing from my mind and I've just kept goin', y'know… the subway trains… I really wanted to be the KING to hit a train more than anybody else on that particular line. (interview with BG 183, March, 2001)\n\nThe distaste conveyed through BG 183's statement is quite indicative of both the birth and subsequent rise of popularity "
