        "text": "During America's involvement in WWII - both in the Pacific Theater against Imperial Japanese Military forces and in the European Theater alongside the Allied Forces and against Germany - a peculiar phenomenon seemed to follow troops wherever they went. Recurring, nearly identical graffiti began popping up in countries around the world, on walls, bathroom stalls, the sides of buses, and even on property belonging to the opposing military.\n\nThe strange and semi-humorous image was almost always the same and featured what appeared to be a bald man with a large, bulbous nose peering over a wall or fence with the words \"Kilroy Was Here\" written underneath. Sometimes, the man - who many assumed was the cartoonish Kilroy in question - had one or two curly hairs, or his nose would be rounded in a different way, but the general image was always the same.\n\nThe doodle appeared in far too many places and in too many different forms to be the work of one person or even an inside joke among a small group of friends. Instead, the vague connotation of what \"Kilroy Was Here\" meant took root in the minds of soldiers who found themselves far from home and risking their lives. Eventually, Kilroy became something thousands of people spread across the world as the conflict continued.\n\nAs the war progressed, the \"Kilroy Was Here\" graffiti gained a cult-like status, with American GIs stationed across the globe spreading it everywhere they went. It soon became increasingly hard to find places \"Kilroy Was Here\" wasn't already inscribed. Some believe this ubiquity, in turn, may have led to something of a competition among soldiers.\n\nTo pass the time and mitigate the ever-present stress and danger of combat, GIs may have tried to find strange and increasingly remote locations before Kilroy arrived (that is to say, before someone else had already marked the place with the ever-present cartoon tag).\n\nSome historians also believe that Kilroy became a joke among GIs - they imagined Kilroy as a kind of supersoldier who was always ahead of everyone, no matter how distant or dangerous the destination may have been. They would mark the spot with the iconic cartoon, and pretend it had already been there, left by the mythical Kilroy, as an in-joke among their fellow soldiers. So, no matter where the military went, Kilroy had already been there.\n\nWhile the true origins of the Kilroy trend are still unknown, many believe it may have all begun with a man named James J. Kilroy, a safety inspector who worked at the Bethlehem Steel company's shipyard in Quincy, MA. He was tasked with inspecting warships that were under construction. To show that a certain section of the ship had been checked, he'd write in yellow crayon, \"Kilroy Was Here.\"\n\nKilroy told the American Transit Association in 1946:\n\nI started my new job with enthusiasm, carefully surveying every inner bottom and tank before issuing a contract. I was thoroughly upset to find that practically every test leader [the head of a work crew] I met wanted me to go down and look over his job with him, and, when I explained to him that I had already checked the job and could not spare the time to crawl through one of those tanks again, he would accuse me of not having looked the job over. I was getting sick of being accused of not looking the jobs over, and one day as I came through the manhole of a tank I had just surveyed, I angrily marked with yellow crayon on the tank top, where the tester could see it, \"Kilroy was here.\"\n\nAccording to a report in the Spokane Daily Chronicle in December 1946, Kilroy believed that \"the 14,000 shipyard workers who entered the armed services were responsible for its subsequent worldwide use.\" Essentially, since Kilroy was inspecting sections of unfinished warships, his signature mark would most likely be seen by the men working in the yards, and they became familiar with the term without necessarily knowing who Kilroy was or what it meant that he had been there. When they went overseas, the term they'd all seen and grown familiar with went with them.\n\nThe report in the Chronicle also explained that \"As far as the American Transit Association is concerned,\" Kilroy is indeed the man unwittingly responsible for the phenomenon. In way of recognition, they presented Kilroy with a streetcar, which was then \"attached to the Kilroy dwelling, scene of an acute housing problem, to provide living quarters for six of the nine little Kilroys ranging in age from 6 months to 15 years.\"\n\nAs author and scholar Charles Panati once wrote of the \"Kilroy Was Here\" phenomenon, \"The outrageousness of the graffito was not so much what it said, but where it turned up.\" If even a fraction of the legends are to be believed, it turned up absolutely everywhere. According to an investigative article in Collier's Magazine in 1946:\n\n\"Kilroy was here\" is lettered on the very tip of the torch of the Statue of Liberty, on the bullet-scarred base of the Marco Polo Bridge in China, and reverentially, near the eternal flame of the Unknown Soldier under the arc de Triomphe in Paris. When a famous steeplejack was hired recently to do some work on the topmost structure of the George Washington Bridge in New York, he found these words tauntingly inscribed in the most inaccessible section of one of the towers.\n\nApparently, the phrase even showed up in places that essentially should have been impossible. For example, it was allegedly discovered carved into the wood railings of the HMS Queen Elizabeth by American soldiers boarding the ship for the first time during WWII. It was also supposedly responsible for breaking up an \"anti-American riot\" in China, when \"a local police chief pointed to a faded 'Kilroy was here' chalked on the side of a building, thus graphically reminding the rioters that millions of Kilroys had contributed to their liberation.\"\n\nWhile the \"Kilroy Was Here\" fad became commonplace for the US Armed Forces and became a way to stave off fear and boredom whiel instilling a sense of camaraderie in even the farthest corners of the globe, it was truly baffling for many among the opposing armies. For example, some sources claim that Japanese forces found the term scrawled on a bombed-out tank and were so confused about its meaning that they took their concerns to senior officers.\n\nOne man who likely didn't see the humor in the proto-meme was Adolf Hitler. According to legend, the existence of the \"Kilroy Was Here\" image was brought to his attention by a number of his commanders, who kept finding the words scrawled on US ordinances that the Third Reich managed to recover.\n\nCommanders also told Hitler that the phrase had been discovered in many remote locations, often before the American military had even arrived, which allegedly led Hitler to conclude that the Kilroy in question must be some sort of spy or supersoldier making his mark across Europe. Some reports even claim that Hitler tasked some of his best men with finding and killing the mysterious Kilroy. Though this legend is fascinating, the tales of Hitler's interest in the phrase may be highly embellished, to say the least.\n\nThe wild and dubious reputation of the Kilroy tag was well-earned. It truly did seem to appear everywhere, and one place it appeared with great frequency was the walls of bathroom stalls. So, unsurprising to anyone familiar with the Kilroy lore, the doodle eventually wound up in some of the most secure, exclusive bathroom stalls in the world.\n\nAccording to a possibly apocryphal story, \"Kilroy Was Here\" popped up during the Potsdam Conference, a post-WWII meeting between the so-called Big Three: President Harry Truman, UK Prime Minister Clement Attlee, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. According to a 1946 Collier's magazine article, different ranks of soldiers used different bathrooms, and the latrines got nicer as the rank of soldier that used them increased. The best of the best was a \"breath-taking, ballroomlike marble chamber for the VIPs.\" Armed guards \"were posted on this VIP bathroom day and night,\" yet not even they could stop Kilroy.\n\n\"On the second day of the conference, Generalissimo Stalin came popping out of this magnificent lavatory, spouting in Russian to one of his aides,\" the Collier's article reported. \"An American interpreter standing nearby swore to a Tank correspondent that what Stalin was trying to find out was: 'Who is this Kilroy?'\""
