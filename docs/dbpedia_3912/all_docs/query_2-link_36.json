        "text": "In life, he was a small, sickly ruler who died young and was quickly forgotten. In death, thousands of years later, he massaged post-Cold War US-Mideast relations, revolutionized the museum-going experience, and became a global pop-cultural phenomenon, filling the slot left by another king who’d died young the year before named Elvis Presley.\n\nMore than 30 years after the groundbreaking King Tut exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the boy king returns to New York — sort of. Tut doesn’t travel (with the exception of two series of tests performed on his mummy in Egypt, he has remained where he was found, in his tomb in Luxor). Tut’s artifacts, however, do. The new exhibit, “Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs,” opens April 23 at Discovery Times Square.\n\nSo: What have we learned about Tut since 1978? And why does he remain such an enduring subject of awe?\n\n“Westerners have been going to Egypt since 5000 BC; they’ve been fascinated with it since they’ve known about it,” says Edward Bleiberg, curator of Egyptian art at the Brooklyn Museum. “So much of Egyptian culture is focused on death; we believe they were the first culture to artificially preserve the body. And death is something that we, in our culture, have trouble dealing with. It’s a way of thinking about it without thinking about it.”\n\nTut’s tomb, discovered by a British explorer in 1922, was the first royal crypt to have been found virtually intact, revealing the true, elaborate extent of royal Egyptian funerary rites. Tut was buried with over 5,000 objects, and found with the carcasses of two babies, stillborn, believed to be his. His diminutive size and stature (he stood between 5-foot-6 and 5-foot-7) led archeologists to believe he died at age 13. In 1968, the first X-rays of Tut were taken, and bone fragments in the skull led to the popular theory that he was murdered, killed by a blow to the head.\n\nWhat we’ve learned about Tut since then is remarkable, but the circumstances surrounding his birth and death remain murky.\n\n“It’s a mystery,” says David P. Silverman, curator of the new Tut exhibit. “You could not have written a better one for Hollywood. But it’s one that’s been narrowed down.”\n\nIn 2005, the body was briefly exhumed from its tomb in Luxor to undergo a new, more extensive autopsy. Over 1,700 CAT scans were taken (with no radiation damage to the carcass) and DNA tests were performed during the course of a few days. The cause of death remains unknown, although the murder theory has been disproved. It’s what scientists have learned about his brief life that’s even more intriguing.\n\nTut died later than previously thought, probably at age 19. DNA tests reveal that his father was the pharaoh Akhenaten, and his mother was one of Akhenaten’s full sisters. “It sounds terrible, but incest was not uncommon [among royalty] in Egypt,” Silverman says. Cleopatra’s parents, for example, were also full siblings, “and she was a genius. But you also wind up with morons, and with other genetic problems.”\n\nTut appears to have suffered from the latter. The 2005 tests — the results of which were published this year — show that Tut had an elongated head, an overbite, an impacted molar, a recessed chin, wide hips, large, “feminizing” pectoral muscles, a clubfoot and “wasting diseases” in the foot, a fracture above his left knee, and malaria. In other words: probably not a looker.\n\n“If you took 20 to 30 images of Tut from artwork,” says Silverman, “it’s clear that none of them were meant as portraits.”\n\nTut was married to a half-sibling, who likely bore the two stillborn babies found in Tut’s tomb. His mother’s mummy has not yet been identified, but his grandmother’s has — DNA tests performed on a lock of hair, found in a place of honor in Tut’s tomb, confirm his paternity and maternity.\n\nTut’s tomb, too, tells us far more about Egypt’s economy and culture during his rule — from about 1333 to 1324 BC, during the 18th Dynasty — than previously known. It was quite modest given his stature, which leads Egyptologists to believe that the boy king died suddenly, and that a lesser citizen’s crypt was hastily readied for Tut’s burial.\n\nThis was a microcosm of what happened to the wider Egyptian citizenry, which, during the 19th and 20th dynasties, suffered from inflation; there was a 20% markup on coffins, as necessary to your average Egyptian as a car or a high-school diploma is today. “You had to have a proper coffin to live forever,” says Bleiberg. So they’d buy on credit, or on the black market, or dump their ancestors out of their own and re-use the coffins themselves.\n\nAs for the objects, food and diversions needed for the afterlife: “There was a Tiffany’s and a Target,” says Bleiberg. “The people who would furnish a tomb on a budget — they’re very much like us.” (Tut’s was Tiffany.) One of the most fascinating discoveries of the past 10 years: poor people built mini-pyramids, 2 to 3 feet high, the equivalent of the modern tombstone. What remains of ancient Egypt are not the monuments to life but to death; it was a culture obsessed with immortality, its pyramids and tombs the grandest equivalent of “Kilroy was here.”\n\nThis new exhibit, which ends its five-year-long tour in New York City, is projected to bring in $40 million, most of the proceeds going to museums in Egypt, which always sees a spike in tourism after a traveling Tut exhibit. The blockbuster 1978 Met show, which changed the nature of what an exhibit could be, was actually inspired by Richard Nixon, who wanted to show the Soviet Union that “Egypt was our friend.” (One of the Met’s most famous acquisitions, the Temple of Dendur, was chosen by Jacqueline Kennedy as a gift from Egypt.)\n\nTut remains Egypt’s best ambassador. Zahi Hawass, the secretary general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, “is extremely pro-active,” says Silverman, who taught Hawass in grad school. “He wanted to bring his country into the 21st century, to use these exhibits as cultural awareness, a learning process that goes both ways.”\n\nBleiberg has mounted a competing exhibit devoted to Egyptian morbidity: “To Live Forever: Art and the Afterlife in Ancient Egypt,” up now. The Met, too, just mounted a rival exhibit, called “Tutankhamun’s Funeral” featuring just 60 artifacts. (Both the Met and the Brooklyn Museum turned down the chance to host this blockbuster traveling exhibit because control over profits and presentation is held by the Egyptian corporation AEG.)\n\nThree concurrent exhibits, in one city, devoted to a person who’s been dead for thousands of years and never been present in any of the shows named for him?\n\n“Tut makes millions and millions,” says Silverman. “He’s not frightening, yet still, there is that mystery. It serves to make this one of the most exciting kinds of exhibitions ever done.”"
