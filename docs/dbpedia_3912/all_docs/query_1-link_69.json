        "text": "Effectively explaining technology to less technical business leaders, investors, courts, and regulators is a challenge, but it is also critical to the success of any technology organization. A recent decision is illustrative: In this case, one company brought a lawsuit against another for allegedly stealing trade secrets related to its proprietary software. See https://lnkd.in/eEbx2X8j. At trial, the defendant wanted to demonstrate its software to the jury to help show that it had not stolen the disputed features from the plaintiff's software. Opinion at 12. Despite the fact that the defendant described its software as “probably the most important exhibit in the case,” the court would not admit the software. Id. at 48. Why? Because the defendant sought to introduce the software at trial on a different laptop than the one on which it had transmitted a copy of the software to the plaintiff during discovery. The defendant explained that the original laptop, which transported the software for discovery purposes, was simply a medium for transferring its software to the plaintiff and was unfortunately now inoperable. Id. at 13. The district court, however, would not allow it. In the end, the jury awarded the plaintiff $2 BILLION for theft of trade secrets. While the decision was reversed on appeal, the district court's decision suggests a fundamental lack of understanding about what software is and how it works (as well as a fundamental understanding about the legal requirements for \"authentication\"). Anyone with even a basic understanding of software (and authentication) would have permitted the defendant to demonstrate the software on a different computer, given that a computer is just a medium for displaying the output of software. How can we be more effective explaining technology to the non-technical? 1. AVOID JARGON: Don't use words that aren't commonly understood by a lay audience and don't use acronyms. 2. USE ANALOGIES: Use less technical technological analogies with which your audience is likely to identify. Here, an analogy to playing a CD (or vinyl record) on a different player, may have resonated better with the judge. 3. VISULAZATION: Sometime technical concepts are easier to convey through a visual diagram or representation. Such visualizations can often be introduced at trial, either as demonstrative evidence or as a summary of voluminous evidence. 4. PRACTICE: One of my former colleagues, U.S. Attorney Timothy O'Shea was fond of telling witnesses that they needed to explain a technical concept like they would explain it to their least sophisticated aunt or uncle at Thanksgiving dinner. Consider practicing that at your next family gathering. 5. OUTSOURCE: Finally, some people may be stronger than others at this. If you already know it is not your strength, consider engaging a colleague or representative that is more skilled at explaining the technical to the non-technical. Stay safe out there!\n\n75 years ago on July 5, 1949 (according to Wikipedia, but pretty much every credible source says June 5), Tommy Eyre was born in Sheffield, England. His father was a steelworker who let Tommy sit on his knee when he played piano for singalongs in pubs. Eyre grew up to be a talented keyboardist who played with Joe Cocker, B.B. King, John Mayall, Dusty Springfield, Tracy Chapman, Wham! and many others. Eyre did amazing musical things, including the keyboards in Gerry Rafferty’s ´Baker Street´ (1978), but I am remembering him today for his organ playing on Joe Cocker’s ‘With a Little Help From My Friends’ that he arranged and performed at just 18 years old. Imagine being a teenage musician playing the first notes listeners hear on a cover of a song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney that impressed The Beatles so much that they sent a congratulatory telegram. Props of course to Joe Cocker’s vocals, Jimmy Page’s guitar, and Procol Harum’s BJ Wilson on drums and HUGE kudos to soul singers Madeline Bell Reeves, Rosetta Hightower, Patrice Holloway, and Sunny Wheetman on backup vocals. The things this song does just changing chords from D to A to E I never thought possible. If you’ve ever had a friend: • believe in you more than you’ve believed in yourself, • give you great advice that made all the difference, • answer the unexpected late night call to crash on their couch, or • even if you’ve just crushed a little bit on Winnie Cooper, find the nearest stereo system, raise a prayer of Thanksgiving for those helpful people in your life, say ‘Happy Birthday, Tommy Eyre (probably one month belated)’, and turn it up really, really loud. Then a little bit louder. Your spirit will thank you."
