        "text": "There is always Journey's End, of course. RC Sherriff's theatrical venture into the trenches of the first world war started life in 1928 with Laurence Olivier in the lead. Since then it has been translated to other media (cinema, and an admirable production by Michael Simpson for the BBC) and other wars, and has even become a school book. It has an enduring popularity, no doubt to do with the genuine poignancy of those young chaps going into the trenches, straight from public school. And this is despite its emasculated language: it smacks too little of the St Quentin trenches in 1918 and rather too much of the West End stage in 1928.\n\nWhat is really odd about the success of Journey's End is that few other dramatists emulated it. Sherriff stood almost alone in bringing the battlefields of 1918 France to the auditoriums of 1930s London. Where are the other first world war plays? Why aren't they produced?\n\nThese are the questions that Two's Company theatre is setting out to answer. Its season, Forgotten Voices from the Great War, unearths four first-world-war plays: two by Miles Malleson, one by a woman with the unusual pen name Bosworth Crocker, and one by the German playwright Ernst Johannsen.\n\nThe short plays by Malleson are a real surprise. He was 26 when he joined the army at the outbreak of the war in August 1914. In January 1915 he was invalided out and, by 1916, he was a confirmed pacifist. He became an actor; by the time of his death in 1969, he was probably best known for some deliciously eccentric film performances. He was a perfect, dotty Chasuble in 1952's The Importance of Being Ernest and a beautifully childlike, toy-loving Sultan in The Thief of Baghdad (which he partly wrote). In the 1950s and 1960s, if you did Moli√®re in English, you very probably did Malleson's versions.\n\nIt is not easy to reconcile that actor with the passionate author of \"D\" Company and Black 'Ell. \"D\" Company is set in Malta - where Malleson had been posted - in October 1914. It is, simply, an evening in the barrack room with half a dozen soldiers. The characters, from illiterate navvy to toff, are written with affection and humour. But there are also sharp stabs of pathos: when the toff reads from his letter to his girlfriend and talks with longing about his future wife and children, it becomes painfully obvious that he will not survive.\n\nBlack 'Ell has a more conventional structure (conventional for 1916, that is). The parents of a soldier in France learn from a newspaper that he has been awarded a DSO for killing six of the enemy and that he is coming home that morning. While they rush off to the station, the son arrives at the house - and the play, previously comic, changes tone. He is haunted by the enemies he has killed (this is two years before Wilfred Owen's Strange Meeting), reliving their deaths with horror: \"I watched the life die out of his eyes.\" Then the civilians come back and cheer.\n\nThe two plays are curiously innocent, but they work. And it was astonishing to discover that in November 1916, shortly after publication, both texts were confiscated by the war office and Scotland Yard. They were described as a deliberate calumny on the British soldier - although it was never established whether the calumny was the illiterate men of \"D\" Company or the newly decorated officer in Black 'Ell - and were not republished until 1925. Malleson was not a man to take this lying down: \"To write a deliberate calumny of the British soldier was the last thing I wanted to do,\" he said, \"yet the book was called that by a cabinet minister who had not read it.\"\n\nThis experience bears an unhappy resemblance to the fate suffered by Johanssen's Brigade Exchange, written in Germany in 1929. When the Nazi party came to power in 1933, Brigade Exchange was withdrawn from publication and performances banned. It is, as Rob Young's new production reveals, a harsher play than those by Malleson. It takes place on the western front in the summer of 1918 in the middle of a battle against the French. The German spring offensive had come to a halt and they began a retreat that was to lose them the war. These men are old soldiers, hardened to death and mutilation after four years of slaughter. The humour is strong, cruel and black; the passionate pleading of Malleson's conscience-stricken hero is mild beside it. If it had been written in Britain about the British army, it would probably have been censored out of existence.\n\nIt certainly puts Crocker's Pawns of War into sharp relief. Written in 1918 and set \"toward the end of summer 1914\" (Germany invaded Belgium on August 3 1914 and Britain entered the war on August 4), it takes place in a burgomaster's house in the small Belgian town of Aerschel. The occupying forces consume the family's food and drink and take hostages - among them the burgomaster himself. The sufferings of the family ought to be shocking, but the characters are cliches, and their talk turns into rhetoric at the drop of a spiked helmet (\"Devils! Devils! You shall not murder them!\"). The author (her real name was Mary Arnold Lewisohn) has clearly strayed too far into foreign territory.\n\nThis is just the start of the season: Two's Company will present more first-world-war plays next year. While we must thank the company for making these plays available to us, nobody can pretend that they are masterpieces. But why not? Why do so few of these plays match up to the size of their subject?\n\nPost-first-world-war drama has dozens of characters who came out of the war as heroes, or were physically or mentally scarred by it. But the stage, particularly the British stage of the 1910s and 1920s, was no place to present the blood and filth of the trenches with anything like accuracy and truth. Even though there were ways to convey the horrors, it is hard to imagine audiences in evening dress flocking to see them in the gilded palaces where they watched Chu-Chin-Chow and Dear Brutus. The slaughter of millions in the trenches was too shocking, the sufferings inflicted on their menfolk too appalling and too close to them to work as live \"entertainment\".\n\nLong after the war, however, the rough language of the soldier and the bloody violence of his profession are commonplace in our theatre. The audiences who watched Dear Brutus while the battle of Passchendaele raged would have been profoundly shocked by the fine plays written in our own time: Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, Accrington Pals, Hamp (revised, improved and filmed as King and Country). And films have been more successful: Chaplin with Shoulder Arms in 1918; Milestone with All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930; Kubrick with possibly the best of them, Paths of Glory, in 1958.\n\nGreat dramatists were not created in the killing fields. What was created was brilliant poetry, novels and famous memoirs. Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, the subjects of my play Not About Heroes, stand out. Sassoon's memoirs are as powerful and moving as his sometimes savage poems. Owen was an original on the edge of greatness when he was killed a week before the end of the war. (Yeats sniffily disagreed; Yeats was a fine poet but a poor critic.) There were Isaac Rosenberg, Charles Sorley, Edward Thomas, Ivor Gurney, all heavily anthologised. Novels by Ford Madox Ford, Richard Aldington, Ernest Hemingway and Henri Barbusse tell us more than any of the histories about what it was like to be there. And they can be read silently and alone, sparing us the embarrassment of public tears.\n\nThe exception, once again, is Journey's End. Well, at least the people in it talk like people in a decent play."
