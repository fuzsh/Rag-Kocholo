        "text": "Registration and check in to start by 8am | Aaron Burr First Floor near Lounge\n\nTime Slot 1 (9-10.15am)\n\nPanel 1: Indeterminate Environmentalisms | Aaron Burr Hall 216\n\nOrganizer: AES/APLA/CAE\n\nChair and Discussant: Cindy Isenhour, University of Maine\n\nEva Steinberg, CUNY Graduate Center, “Saving Seeds, Making Futures”\n\nSeed saving has emerged to preserve dwindling plant biodiversity, most commonly through ex-situ cryopreservation, in which a seed is removed from its environment and frozen until some point in the future. Given a seed’s inherent propensity for change through relationships with its environment, a key question emerges in these scenarios: Why do we assume these seeds will be able to grow in these unknown and unpredictable futures? In this paper, I interrogate the ways in which ex-situ conservation relies on control and purity through technoscientific intervention to reproduce seeds and security, and juxtapose this method with in-situ conservation. In-situ seed saving maintains a seed’s relationship with its environment, but risks genetic drift and erosion through open pollination and natural mutation. Through a case study of “ultracross okra” and collard breeds developed by the Utopian Seed Project, this paper advocates for embracing these moments of impurity in seed saving as essential to promoting and maintaining biological and cultural diversity. More broadly, I make an argument for a shift in the emphasis of “saving” from reproducing the past to ensuring future potential, even if it entails impurity, change, or hybridization.\n\nChristopher Morris, George Mason University, “It’s Not the Eskom Issue—That’s Coming Later Today”: Studying Chemical Shedding While Load Shedding in South Africa”\n\nScientific interest in bisphenols has grown considerably over the last decade, driven by the presence of the chemicals in consumer materials and the knowledge of their potential health risks as endocrine disruptors. And while bisphenols are increasingly ubiquitous as contaminants in the environment, their specific sources can be difficult to trace. In South Africa, the scientific study of the indeterminacies surrounding such chemical shedding encounters the indeterminacies of electrical “load shedding.” Like everyone in South Africa, scientists in the country contend with a precarious power supply and scheduled-but-intensifying power outages. This paper goes inside a research-oriented NGO in South Africa studying the presence of bisphenols in fish and shellfish in the country’s coastal waters. Drawing upon ethnographic interviews I conducted with two of the NGO’s scientists, I explore what it means to do pressing, cutting-edge science in a context of infrastructural constraint and uncertainty.\n\nCaitlyn Bolton, Boston College, “Climate Behavior: Seaweed Farmers, Tabia, and Islamic Ethics during Zanzibar’s Offshore Search for Fossil Fuels”\n\n“Promising to make the islands the “Dubai of East Africa,” the Zanzibari government contracted a gas company from the UAE, who subcontracted Chinese boats to trawl through coral reefs in search of that fateful substance that promises fantastical wealth at the expense of planetary health. Sitting just inland of the boats drilling for seismic testing, a group of women lay out their harvested seaweed to dry under the hot equatorial sun. Tossing aside the bleached seaweed—diseased from rising ocean temperatures—they complain of the similarly rising cost of electricity, which had arrived in the village just thirty years ago alongside the cash from seaweed to pay for it. Perhaps, if the boats find oil, the women can abandon their plots and their dying seaweed to bask in the country’s newfound prosperity. Perhaps Zanzibar could finally gain independence from mainland Tanzania, no longer dependent for energy on the underwater electrical cable tying the islands like an umbilical cord to the African continent. Or perhaps oil will turn out just like tourism did: owned and run by outsiders who dispossess them of their land and privatize the ocean. But instead of kitesurfing tourists crashing through their farms, it will be oil spills. These potential futures do not, in the villagers’ estimation, actually depend on what the ocean may or may not be hiding beneath her depths. An op-ed in a local newspaper declared that “the problem is ‘tabiawatu’ (‘people-behavior’) not just tabianchi (climate)”—drawing on the multivalent concept of tabia, a Swahili word that simultaneously means nature, an individual’s moral character, and interpersonal behavior. Proper tabia, it is understood, is primarily developed through Islamic education and pious practice. This paper examines the way that Zanzibaris draw on the concept of tabia to make claims for the ethical co-construction of self, social relations, and the environment to shape an uncertain future under the shadow of fossil fuels.”\n\nAmanda Wetsel, Dartmouth College, “Certainty, Indeterminacy, and Arboreal Value”\n\nIn response to the number of trees felled in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, a group of environmental activists designed a project to measure how trees the city reduced heat, noise, and dust. As part of their efforts to preserve urban green spaces and promote the planting and care of trees, they wanted to assign a monetary value to the trees’ contributions. Two years later, they collaborated with the mayor’s office to inventory the city’s trees and attach an ID tag to each tree. This paper explores how the activists express what they can and cannot know about trees in the city.\n\nSumin Myung, Johns Hopkins University, “Complexity and Shallowness: A More-Than-Human Politics of Geomorphological Indeterminacy in South Korea”\n\nFor forest scientists in South Korea, “complex geomorphologies and shallow soil depths” have been the definitive characteristics of mountainous forests (sallim), which cover about 63 percent of the country’s landscape today. Drawing from my 34-month archival research and fieldwork, this paper explores how these qualities of forest soils—complexity and shallowness—have defined and refracted technoscientific interventions in forests, which were devastated by local overuse, Japanese wartime extraction, and the Korean War. During rapid, large-scale reforestation campaigns in the 1970s under the military dictatorship, complexity and shallowness had to be overcome swiftly through labor-intensive interventions, such as implementing aggressive soil erosion controls and planting billions of fast-growing trees such as Japanese green alders (Alnus firma) and black locusts (Robinia pseudoacacia). As a result, certain trees and human laborers have become together what I call “biogeomorphological engineers.” These more-than-human assemblages participated in not only the greening of national landscapes but also the reconfiguration of human-nature relationships in the midst of postcolonial nation-building. Recently, however, complexity and shallowness have challenged forest scientists and policymakers once again in relation to new critical concerns: promoting carbon sequestration and biodiversity through scientific reforestation to fight climatic crises and forest degradation. Following scientists in the field, conference rooms, and archives, this paper shows how geomorphological qualities have enacted or frustrated more-than-human assemblages over time. Through these assemblages, I suggest, complexity and shallowness have referred not to (deterministic) conditions or realities but to (indeterministic) attributes of forest geomorphologies, through which human labor, tree species, and soils make new relations and enable “horizon work” (Petryna 2022) in times of ecological uncertainty.\n\nPanel 2: The Threat and Promise of Digital Infrastructures | Aaron Burr Hall 213\n\nOrganizer: AES/APLA/CAE\n\nChair and Discussant: Lyndsey Beutin, McMaster University\n\nNida Kirmani, Brandeis University, “The Promises and Perils of Social Media: Digital Activism against Enforced Disappearances in Balochistan”\n\nThe practice of enforced disappearance is one of the most extreme manifestations of state violence and exemplifies the opaque nature of the state, particularly with regards to the peripheries. Pakistan is one of many countries where this practice is widespread. According to the state’s Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, 8,100 cases have been filed with them since 2011 of which 5,853 cases have been ‘disposed of’; rights groups contest these figures, arguing that this is a gross underestimate. A large number of those missing are from Balochistan—the country’s most underdeveloped province, which has been the site of an ongoing insurgency for several decades. Despite the thousands affected, this issue rarely makes it onto the national media. For this reason, activists and family members of missing persons increasingly relying on the digital sphere, particularly Twitter, to call for the return of their loved ones and to highlight the state’s violent practices. This paper analyzes how social media is being used as a tool to resist state opacity and end the practice of enforced disappearances by Baloch activists and family members of missing persons. Interview findings demonstrate the double-edged nature of social media, which is also used by representatives of the state for the purposes of surveillance, to further their narrative, counter critique, and frighten critics into silence. The paper highlights the ambiguous nature of the digital sphere—one that is laden with both promise and risks for members of marginalized groups.\n\nHope Bastian, Wheaton College, “Mothering in 4G: WhatsApp, Social Networks and Challenges to Authoritative Knowledge of Birth, Breastfeeding and Postpartum in Cuba”\n\n“Based on research from 2018-22, this ethnography identifies emerging frustrations and resistance to the exclusive technocratic biomedical management of birth and postpartum in Cuba. In the early 1960s, the Cuban Revolution expanded access to prenatal care and hospital birth to 99% of pregnant women in both rural and urban areas. Women receive state support in the form of medical care, parental leave, and extra food rations, and the country’s low infant mortality rates are often celebrated as advances of Socialist modernity. However, the supremacy of the biomedical model often subjects mothers to violence and denies agency to make decisions about their births, bodies, and babies. Increased internet access since 2019 has exposed some women to alternative models of birth and parenting. New virtual spaces of sociability, and the relationships forged through them, allow women to question the health system’s authoritative knowledge and adopt alternative birthing and parenting practices. These women talk about the importance of networks of peer-to-peer solidarity and information exchange through WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook groups that connect them with movements beyond the island, constructing new subjectivities around slogans like “teta es poder”, that celebrate breastfeeding as source of knowledge and power. I place these agentive practices in the context of recent political changes, an example of how Cuban civil society is gradually moving from virtual spaces to institutional places, to challenge their subordination to patriarchal control of the biomedical system and the state. I also follow the responses of the public health officials, media, and individual healthcare providers to this online activism, as experts in local primary care clinics, maternity hospitals, and the Ministry of Public Health headquarters are interpellated to respond to alternative practices presented by emerging social movements around birth and breastfeeding.\n\nOnur Arslan, UCDavis, Wiring the Legal: The Birth of Electronic Justice in Turkey\n\nAs of the 2000s, the infrastructures of law in Turkey have transformed in two interconnected ways. First, giant buildings dedicated to law has been erected throughout the country. Second, the law’s physicality has been networked with the help of emergent digital technologies such as Judiciary Informatics System (UYAP) or video-conferencing technologies. As the new technologies (screens, cables, computers, etc.) have digitized words and appearances and made them transferable across different spaces, daily legal practices, including being in the courtroom, have become feasible on-line and remotely. Taken together, this was a cyber-spatial intervention into the country’s legal system that has been problematized for decades as fragmented and cumbersome. Based on 27-months of fieldwork, this paper investigates how Turkey’s legal terrain is reshaped at the interfaces between experts, legal technologies, and epistemological assumptions on legal objectivity. Specifically, it asks: what happens when the courts are no longer bound to a site? What and who exactly is rendered remote through new electronic technologies? What politics do they materialize? How do they alter our sense of legal knowledge and the way the law is practiced?\n\nPanel 3: The Indeterminacy of Anthropological Translations | Aaron Burr Hall 209\n\nOrganizer: Andrew Brandel, Pennsylvania State University\n\nChair and Discussant: Andrew Brandel, Pennsylvania State University\n\nPanel Abstract: This panel explores the indeterminacy of translation not as an abstract problem, but by looking at concrete practices of translation in particular contexts. More specifically, it trains attention on anthropological translations and the danger of their tacit reinforcement of the inequality of languages, including our picture of what language at bottom is. Drawing on descriptions from a range of regions and settings where they are conducting ethnographic fieldwork, contributors show how what counts as translation depends itself on the context of practice, and that it is boundaries are often fuzzy.\n\nTobias Kelly, University of Edinburgh, “Conscience, Translation, and Indeterminacy”\n\nThis presentation focuses on the indeterminacy of conscience. It does so through an examination of attempts by British conscientious objectors to military service to prove the sincerity of their convictions. In going so, the presentation will examine the ways in which the indeterminacy of translations – between personal biography, ethical commitments, legal form and anthropological knowledge – can be productive of new social relations.\n\nMilad Odabaei, Princeton University, “Translation Praxes in Revolutionary Iran”\n\nSince the 1990s, after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and amid ongoing cycles of revolt and repression, the translation of continental philosophy and social theory has witnessed an unprecedented growth in Iran. In this presentation, I reflect on the proliferations of translation praxes and its relation to political and epistemological indeterminacies of a revolutionary society. I describe how translation of philosophy and theory emerges as a form of political activism, exacerbating existing political antagonisms, and how it gestures to a politics to come. I conclude by drawing on my study to reflect on anthropological debates about translation.\n\nGili Kliger, Harvard University, “Translation and the Circulation of Concepts”\n\nTranslation, we might assume, facilitates the movement of a concept from one language to another. If you can find a rough equivalent of a word in another language, you help the concept it expresses travel into a new language context. On this view, a word that resists translation would seem to block this movement. This paper draws on examples from the history of anthropology to explore the possibility that the opposite is true: it is only when a word refuses or resists translation that new meanings and new ideas circulate. Paying attention to the history of particular “untranslatables” shows us that it is precisely when no easy equivalents are found that words continue to circulate untranslated, and, in so doing, prompt sustained inquiry into the ideas they seem to express.\n\nLotte Buch Segal, University of Edinburgh, “Sensing Similarity, Betraying Particularity?”\n\nIn this paper I wish to pause with the indeterminacy of translation zooming in on ethnographic instances of loss where an experience, an expression, or an atmosphere hereof seems to open up a sense of similarity; of understanding the phenomenon at hand by drawing on ethnographic knowledge from a spatial or temporal elsewhere, or when they physiognomy of a concept suddenly seems to fit , both sharpening and changing it’s allegedly original meaning. How, in such instances does it help or hinder to think of these as acts of translation and what are the consequences of doing so, and does the concept of translation itself hold the capacity for indeterminacy that anthropological translation necessitates if we want to pay allegiance to the meaning of a word, to everyone who uses it. What is lost in such a movement, and might there be a way to think about that loss not as a lack but a shift in tonality instead.\n\nPanel 4: Citizenship, Solidarity and the Futures of Non-belonging Part I | JRRB A12\n\nOrganizer: American Ethnologist\n\nChair and Discussant: Susanna Trnka, University of Auckland\n\nPanel Abstract: Citizenship is not a stable entity. In many parts of the world, both the meanings and the legal provisions commonly attached to citizenship are shifting. Covid/post-Covid politics have markedly reshaped healthcare and welfare, border policies, labor and manufacturing and distribution chains. So too have Brexit, the legacies of Trump, and climate change. This panel interrogates the various forms of belonging and nonbelonging that we might expect, and demand, as part of national, regional and global futures. Simultaneously an enchanted concept, promising much more than it can entail, and a bureaucratically-driven line in the sand entailing the most mundane paper trails that nonetheless potentially carry life and death consequences, “citizenship” has come to symbolize and materialize a huge range of facets of life, inclusive of but extending beyond the allocation of rights within contemporary state forms. Examining a broad range of inter-personal and political struggles over the indeterminacies of belonging and the various forms 21 st century solidarities might take, the panel probes whether or not “citizenship” is even the right rubric for asking questions about political rights and inclusion. Panellists’ papers reflect on the deepening scars of post-plantation economics, global stops and flows of diasporic labour – and the actual people such “flows” involve, human–non-human relations, freedom, religious nationalism, COVID-19 containment measures, post-petro citizenships, youth activism, and the disavowal of differently abled personhoods. The panel’s speakers propose new ways of considering how racism, sexism, mental and physical ableism, religious exclusion, globalized climate and energy crises inflect the indeterminacies of 21st-century forms of solidarity and nonbelonging.\n\nDeborah Thomas, University of Pennsylvania, “Authority, Vulnerability, and Surrender: Fugitive Forms of Belonging”\n\n“The organizers of this panel, in their abstract, provocatively ask whether “citizenship” is the right rubric for asking questions about political rights and inclusion? My comments today will take off from this question to ask whether “political rights and inclusion” are the right rubrics through which to explore forms of world-building we might call freedom. Scholars of the political across disciplines have been increasingly attentive to stances of refusal of the language of sovereignty and citizenship, and to the ways people seek forms of affiliation outside what Leela Gandhi calls “possessive communities of belonging” (2006:10). I am interested in thinking through and from the ritual space of kumina in Jamaica – or more specifically, from the network of kumina practitioners who are loosely organized as the St. Thomas Kumina Collective – about the practice of belonging. My reflections will not constitute an ethnographic interrogation, but rather a conceptual one, as I am interested in the non-linear and unexpected ways something that feels like freedom circulates and is transmitted from one to another, today, yesterday, and maybe tomorrow. I want to think through three problem-spaces – freedom without autonomy; authority without sovereignty; surrender without subordination – in order to reframe belonging as a mode of vulnerability grounded in embodied practice, process, and dialogue, rather than in the political and social possibilities imagined to follow from recognition, inclusion, and the extension of rights.”\n\nNeha Vora, Lafayette College, “Entangled precarities: human-nonhuman kinship and urban belonging in the Arabian Peninsula”\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic hit the GCC (Gulf Cooperative Council) states particularly hard in 2020, leading to hundreds of thousands of immigrants losing their jobs and having to leave the country, people stranded as borders closed, and a rise in xenophobia. But humans were not the only ones impacted by these changes. Animal abandonments skyrocketed, shelters were at capacity, and street animal populations grew as people lost their livelihoods and relocated to their home countries leaving their pets behind. Meanwhile, Dubai banned the feeding of stray animals, which led to heightened anxieties among residents who regularly feed stray cats around their homes and workplaces and had developed relationships with specific animals who depended on their care. The pandemic exacerbated precarities among immigrants and animals, as well as highlighted their entanglements. This paper, part of a larger research project in its early stages, discusses human-nonhuman relationships in the United Arab Emirates, particularly the forms of care and affection between immigrants, who occupy a liminal space of permanent temporariness due to their dependence on renewable short-term work visas, and stray cats, who also exist liminally, in-between domestic and wild, owned and ownerless. I explore the importance of these human-nonhuman bonds for mitigating the isolation and out-of-placeness that these groups of urban dwellers often experience. For many immigrants, these relationships and care practices have been a source of kinship and intimacy, a way to build social networks with other humans, an opportunity to make political criticisms of state and society, and a site for the articulation of racial and cultural differences. I highlight how a transspecies approach to Gulf urbanism is essential to understanding forms of belonging and exclusion, particularly in the wake of structural upheaval.\n\nDamani Partridge, University of Michigan, “Legal Impossibilities”\n\nWhat work does the law do for the noncitizen? How does one organize amidst its constraints? Could the law ever be a source of liberation or must one organize in spite of its regulatory force? This paper thinks from the perspective of dispossession in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Berlin. Amidst histories of land grabbing, mass incarceration, and death, what should come next? What new forms of political possibility can one imagine? What possibilities are already in effect? Can these forms be mobilized transnationally or are they only relevant to particular contexts?\n\nPanel 5: Analogical Indeterminacy: On the promise and limits of non-human analogies | JRRB 399\n\nOrganizer: Victoria Nguyen, Amherst College and Vinicius de Aguiar Furuie, University of Toronto\n\nChair: Victoria Nguyen, Amherst College\n\nDiscussant: Jerry Zee, Princeton University\n\nPanel Abstract: In recent years, anthropologists have extended ethnographic inquiry “beyond the human” (Kohn 2013, Tsing 2015, Haraway 2016), highlighting how such analyses can help us better understand social life and the anthropos. Analogies have been vital to this process, helping to resolve the interpretive dilemma non-human subjects pose. In this sense, analogies help to capture ineffable connections, detachments and displacements; facilitating comparison even as they admit fundamental differences (see Raffles 2010). This panel explores the role of analogies and “analogical thinking” in creating meaning in and across zones of indeterminacy. We explore how analogies are used to navigate the space between what anthropology has deemed “incommensurate realities” (see Povinelli 2001) or zones of “ontological conflict,” (Blaser 2013), attending to how they configure or prefigure understandings of more-than-human relations. How are both human and non-human subjects constituted through analogy? How does analogy work to render subjects familiar or strange? What are the promises and limits of such analogies, and how might non-human-knowledge-as-analogy assert affinity even as it bolsters differences?\n\nVinicius de Aguiar Furuie, University of Toronto, “Fishing Families: Moral analogies and human-animal-state relations”\n\nThe fisherfolks of the Iriri river—in the Eastern Brazilian Amazonia—talk about the tucunaré with a great deal of reverence. They admire the fishes’ “family values”: their loyalty to their partners and vigilance of their offspring. Seen as entities imbued with moral agency, the tucunaré are not just a natural resource or a commodity. Through a form of analogical thinking that relates the tucunaré’s family values to their own, the fisherfolk calibrate the relation between themselves and the fish, imposing limits on how many fish they catch by weighting their obligations to their families against those of the tucunarés to theirs’. This moral analogy also affects relations to state agencies that regulate fishing: fisherfolk’s accounts of self-sacrifice resonate with the tucunaré’s, but are not recognized by the state. This paper positions the relationship between fisherfolk and tucunaré alongside other anthropological accounts of human-animal relationality in anthropology. Examining moral analogy alongside ascriptions of reciprocity, eroticism, violence, predation and domestication, I argue that it opens a space of in-betweenness between the “ideal hunt” (Willerslev et al 2015) and the “alternate ontology of hunting” (Nadasdy 2007).\n\nVictoria Nguyen, Amherst College, “Intimate Invasives”\n\nIn 2002, the emerald ash borer—a dime-sized, iridescent Asian beetle—was discovered in Canton, Michigan. Since then, it has decimated tens of millions of ash trees, making it the most destructive and costly insect to ever invade North America. Engaging the discursive and technical strategies of emerald ash borer representation and mitigation, this paper explores how the constitution of this insect as invader relies upon both historic and novel analogies to animate ideas of threat and endangerment. In this way, I show how the management of invasive species shapes and is shaped by cultural imaginations of nature, urban belonging, state sovereignty, and global security (Helmreich 2005, Subramaniam 2001, van Dooren 2011, Catellino 2017). Yet, asking after the productivities and limitations of cross-species analogies, the paper interrogates how such comparisons inform our understandings of both human and more-than-human worlds. Considering the insect-analogy’s various ordering logics, I suggest the formation of the ash borer as a contemporary biological, economic, and sovereign threat is as much dependent on historic fears and recycled rhetoric as it is upon the work of analogy in rendering the insect both strange and quotidian.\n\nAmy McLachlan, Independent Scholar, “Something like this world: Analogy, substitution, and provisional kinwork with Uitoto migrants”\n\nWhat is the relationship between analogy and kinship? This paper explores the generative limits of analogic thinking in the curing work of Indigenous Uitoto migrants navigating the hazards and possibilities of (re)making kinworlds under displacement. Uitoto kinwork (the work of making and repairing relations) is mediated and managed through the force of ancestral beings whose bodies are plants. Living far removed from their home territories in the Colombian Amazon, Uitoto migrants are compelled to test the limits of analogic kinships, through the adoption and adaptation of new kinds of kin, new forms of kin reckoning, and new plant kin (Miller 2019) as media and mediators of those relations. Navigating a constant play of substitutions for the substances that materialize kinship, Uitoto migrant curing involves a particular approach to the ‘moral project in perpetuity’ (Londoño 2012) that characterizes much Amazonian kinwork. What do these creative, adaptive, and frustrated forms of kinwork disclose about the limits of the analogic expansion of relation as the basis of ethics beyond the human? What might a perpetually provisional kinwork offer to anthropological approaches to more than human relations?\n\nPanel 6: Unspoken Secrets and Unsettled Pasts |JRRB 301\n\nOrganizer: Suvi Rautio, CUNY John Jay College/University of Helsinki\n\nChair and Discussant: Suvi Rautio, CUNY John Jay College/University of Helsinki\n\nPanel Abstract: This panel probes into the “unspoken things” that are pervasive in power and interpersonal relations. Each paper considers unspoken secrets and unsettled pasts – from the unnamed and withheld information by authorities to the silences and absences embedded in biographical narratives and family histories. In studying these themes, secrecy becomes a proactive investment in relationships to mark exclusionary sociality. Members of a collective ‘know what not to know’ and silence becomes an expression of loyalty to the inner group. The “unspoken” can build both trust and break down relationships; protect and endanger groups and individuals; give control and create vulnerabilities; provide a means to mediate between untrusting persons or groups. Beyond interpersonal affairs, secrets represent that which remain hidden and unseen. Undoing their concealment can lead to fatal consequences. Secrecy is thus integral to power, and although that which remains ‘unsaid’ are sometimes known, they cannot always be articulated (Taussig 1999) and remain phonetically unattainable to outsiders (Derrida 1995). This panel examines the epistemological, emotional, methodological and ethical issues that researchers can come to terms with when confronted by other people’s secrets. Rather than seeking to settle and close unfinished stories of the past, the “unspoken” offers multiple approaches to understand the workings of indeterminacy.\n\nSuvi Rautio, CUNY John Jay College/University of Helsinki, “How Secrets Shape Ethnography”\n\nThe objective of this paper is to unpack the relationship between the anthropologist and her interlocutors by considering the role that secrecy plays as a proactive investment in people’s social encounters. Looking at how things left unsaid maintain secrecy and trust, as two connected attributes, this paper asks the following: how does secrecy shape ethnographic research? The material this paper builds on is framed around my previous work with the Dong people of Southwest China to analyze the ways that secrecy and silence became a vital component of our social interactions. I then compare these engagements with my current project that looks at the role silencing plays in the transmission of memory. In combining ethnographic material from two very different projects that both focus on China, the objective of my paper is to unpack the micro-politics and cycles of power that anthropologists enter into when conducting research to bring into sharper focus the roles that secrecy, silence and positionality play in ethnography. In disentangling these cycles, I show how grappling secrets is not about waiting for their sudden exposure, but about adapting to different ways of looking, listening, and paying attention.\n\nDiana Marre, Autonomous University of Barcelona and Hugo Gaggiotti, University of the West of England, “Suffering in Silence: Stolen Babies and Children as Unspoken Public Secrets in Contemporary Spain”\n\nSince the 2000’s, several scholars and European organizations (Council of Europe 2005, 2006, United Nations Human Rights Council 2014, 2017) have alluded to an unidentified number of children that have been displaced from their birth families through irregular adoptions that took place in Spain during the Civil War (1936-1939), the Franco dictatorship (1939-1975) and the first decades of democracy (1975-1995). This paper discusses why, in Spain, this enforced displacement of children between the 1930’s and 1990’s remains unrecognized and as an unspoken public secret, unnamed and excluded from public and private conversations. The paper elaborates on the concepts of state of exception (Agamben ([2003] 2005) and necropolitics (Mbembe 2003) to justify the implementation of a reign of terror (Taussig 1992; Green 1994) that displaced children and stolen babies face by erasing their identities via social death or more “condescending” approaches. A state of exception that bases itself on a fear that is unnamed, invisible, silenced and secret (Bellman 1981; Taussig 1999) is made to appear as normal and, therefore, is accepted as a way of avoiding fear (Taussig 1992). Hereby, our paper considers how silencing and “un-naming” things become technical devices to support fear.\n\nNerina Weiss, Fafo Institute for Labour and Social Studies, “Dangerous knowledge and proxy-reasons: therapeutic attempts of a former PKK fighter”\n\nA sunny noon somewhere in Turkey, Jihan finds herself sitting on the balcony and contemplating suicide. Her friend happens to pass by and convinces her to seek medical help. Indeed, Jihan is allowed to jump the queue and is taken in as an acute case. The doctor immediately realizes that Jihan has experienced some trauma, however, which is unclear. Jihan on her side remains unwilling or unable to tell of her past as a guerrilla fighter and her experiences during prison in the 1990s. Based on biographical interviews with Jihan, a former PKK guerrilla fighter, this paper explores the limited access Kurdish activists in Turkey have to medical and psychological support for their health issues caused by violence and trauma. Theoretically I draw on the literature of ignorance and not-knowing (Dilley and Kirsch 2015), as well as on Das’ (1996) concept of poisonous knowledge to explore Jihan’s meeting with the medical sector in Turkey. Her experiences of war, torture and imprisonment constitute dangerous knowledge, which is difficult to share in a context where the therapeutic safe room cannot be taken as a given. After all medical stuff have been actively involved in the torture of political prisoners, and political cleavages also exist in the therapist-patient relationship today. Jihan – and probably also the doctor – therefore navigate a therapeutic setting vested with mistrust and silences and explore the unsaid traumata and proxy-reasons in an attempt to cope with the traumata and violent experiences unsaid.\n\nMarta-Laura Haynes, CUNY John Jay College, “Untrusting: The gendered labor of winning ‘hearts and minds’”\n\nTrust in the police is commonly seen as a major indicator of a ‘healthy’ democracy. Hence, building trust has become the centerpiece in community policing efforts worldwide, including in Rio de Janeiro and Recife, Brazil. However, in a country where a ‘George Floyd’ is killed by police eight times per day, trust in the state is always a political project of subjugation and, ultimately, white supremacy. In these landscapes, trust presents itself as a historically fraught, gendered, and racialized concept. It must be read as more than a moral commitment, a character disposition, or a dynamic set of interests negotiated between transacting parties (Jiménez 2011). Rather, contestations around trust—and its ever present shadow distrust— allow us to think through the precarity of Black life in the wake of the plantation (Sharpe 2016). By approaching trust as a verb rather than a noun (Coates 2019), this paper explores not simply what trust is but the gendered labor it performs in police units and favelas subjected to ‘democratic’ policing efforts. My research suggests that trust has become but a placeholder for a process of racial passing and is feeding into an underlying racist power structure. What if we let go of trust in policing and embrace distrust as counter-hegemonic resistance and articulation of care? In regions where policing results chronically in violence instead of public service, my research shows the devastating consequences of the highly racialized, gendered, and frequently hidden reality of trust.\n\nAndreas Bjorklund, University of Oxford, Secrets, silence and creativity among stateless Kuwaiti Bidoon asylum-seekers\n\nIn the European asylum context, truth-telling is expected to discern the ‘genuine’ from the ‘bogus’ refugee through credibility assessments (Liodden 2019) measured against ‘objective country material’. The latter (e.g. UKHO 2016) has dichotomised stateless Kuwaiti ‘Bidoon’ asylum-seekers into two ‘types’, whereby one is more likely than the other to be granted refugee status. This ‘labelling’ (Zetter 1991) becomes productive of specific communal relations that pit individual needs against collective understandings of history and claims for justice. But some specifics of how this happens cannot be said lest it disqualify people for protection. Here, the unspoken paradoxically reconstructs and erases communal boundaries. Nevertheless, the ‘unsaid’ is in fact often known – a ‘public secret’ (Taussig 1999) – leading the sociological function of the secret to become a primary concern (Simmel 1950) as opposed to the content of the secret itself. Danger mostly arises when known secrets must explicitly be articulated. This all presents problems for ethnographic portrayal and the production of knowledge about a community whose identity is under question. It also causes ethical dilemmas for engaged anthropologists and others who participate in the asylum process, for example before asylum tribunals. Drawing on Sarró’s (2022) analysis of the secret as an ‘imagination trigger’ that inspires creativity, this paper explores how secrets contribute to ambiguities that distribute benefits and risks unequally and unpredictably. In doing so, I argue for both a literary ethnography as a mode of writing, and an engaged anthropology recognising its limits to voice clarity where silence prevails.\n\nRoundtable: Revisiting Rappaport’s Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity |JRRB 397\n\nOrganizers; Michael Lambek, University of Toronto and Jacob Bessen, University of Toronto\n\nChair: Michael Lambek, University of Toronto\n\nAbstract: It is now over 20 years since the publication of Roy Rappaport’s magnum opus Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity (Cambridge University Press, 1999). It is time for a retrospective on this important work, one which perhaps has not received the attention it deserved — and continues to deserve. At once a profound analysis of the formal consequences of ritual and an elaboration of the relation of humanity with the world we all inhabit, the book also examines the creation of truth and certainty within life conditioned by indeterminacy, alternatives, and the possibility of deceit. Participants will offer a range of responses to the book, emphasizing its relevance to current conversations and directions within ethnographic theory, the opportunities it offers our social and political engagements, and informed critique.\n\nPanelists:\n\nKeith Hart, Goldsmith, University of London\n\nThomas Csordas, UC San Diego\n\nEllen Messer, Tufts University\n\nJacob Bessen, University of Toronto\n\nMichael Lambek, University of Toronto\n\nVlad Naumescu from CEU (Central European University)\n\nSalon: Severance |Aaron Burr Third Floor Lounge\n\nOrganizers: Ilana Gershon, Rice University, Nelle Mole Liston, NYU, and Caitrin Lynch, Olin College\n\nWe invite people interested in a wide-ranging discussion about the Apple + television show, Severance. We will explore what the show reveals about how capitalism has shaped the moral economy of time and affect and the kinds of selves neoliberalism enables. We are especially interested in the critiques of corporate life and management practices embedded in the show. Please join us if you have watched the show, and long to talk about it with fellow anthropologists.\n\nPanel 1: Enacting Climate Knowledge and Politics in Global Climate Institutions | Aaron Burr Hall 213\n\nOrganizer: Jessica O’Reilly, Indiana University\n\nChair and Discussant: Cal Biruk, McMaster University\n\nPanel Abstract: Activists and advocates often invoke the motto “follow the science,” whether their cause is climate, vaccines, or fiscal policy. This slogan suggests that solutions are readily discernible from scientific research. But while decision-making may proceed from an apparently authoritative body of knowledge, both producing and enacting this knowledge involves navigating indeterminacy, both as a challenge and as a site of possibility. Panelists will explore how both climate knowledge and climate politics are formed, contested, and enacted in global climate institutions, with a particular focus on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 27th Conference of Parties (COP27), held in November 2022 in Egypt.\n\nCharles Nuermberger, Princeton University, “Evaluating the Existing Documentation of Youth Climate Activism”\n\nWe surveyed documentation of youth activity in relation to the UNFCCC, to evaluate their claims of political engagement. For the purposes of this archival analysis, we centered mainstream newspapers, UNFCCC programming, independent media outlets, and youth NGO websites. We found that, though rates of youth participation with the international climate process are increasing, this engagement has been inadequately documented. To involve youth more substantially as actors in the process, we advocate for the use of genre writing to capture under-examined youth voices, in addition to more standard forms of documentation.\n\nJessica O’Reilly, Indiana University, “Anticipating 1.5 degrees”\n\nAt COP21 in Paris, UNFCCC leadership issued an invitation to the IPCC to produce a special report on limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The assessment report, known as SR1.5, has driven the international conversation about climate science and policy since its publication in 2018. SR1.5 mapped the notion of carbon budget—itself a fraught signifier that indicates how much more CO2 can be emitted without exceeding a temperature threshold—onto time. Specifically, the report estimated that the world would exceed the carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5°C somewhere between 2030 and 2052. Activists picked up on the 2030 number as a “deadline,” and the countdown began immediately: as of 2018, activists declared, we had “12 years left.” Several IPCC leaders and authors—many of them well-versed in interacting with governments and communications strategists—have expressed frustration with this message. First, there were not 12 years left to act if we want to limit warming to 1.5°; the time to act was instantly. Second, while the timescale might help people comprehend the urgency of the issue, it also suggests that we will move, in a linear fashion, toward a threshold that we will cross, or not cross, at the projected time. In fact, climate change is not unfolding in a linear way that we can, at some point, simply stop. What’s more, improvements in measurement and models meant that, between the Special Report (2018) and the AR6 assessment (2021), we missed the mark. In retrospect, we had already blown the 1.5°C target as the number was being negotiated. Scientists are engaged in a difficult, collective balancing act of precision and politics, as they seek to underscore the urgency the climate crisis demands without giving up their own professional credibility.\n\nNaveeda Khan, Johns Hopkins University, “A Tale of Global Climate Negotiations”\n\nWith a focus on the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the means by which countries are to report on their carbon emission reduction targets and the pathways by which to achieve them, this paper describes common tabular formats for reporting as the central way the Paris Agreement seeks to corral countries to combat climate change. The accounting regime that is at the heart of the Agreement is excavated to show how it indexes, however feebly, the entangled and often violent histories of colonialism and extractivism without providing a clear pathway to redressing these.\n\nCindy Isenhour, University of Maine, ““Just” or “Just” Numbers?: On Climate Justice Advocates’ Quest to Expose the Indeterminacy and Injustices of Climate Accounting”\n\nClimate negotiators rely on reports of each country’s emissions to make decisions about how to best avoid dangerous climate change and assign responsibility for mitigating its worst impacts. Compared to some negotiation spaces where issues of justice are central, conversations about emissions accounting have always been understood as technical, apolitical spaces focused on “just the numbers.” But anthropology has always understood the indeterminacy of numbers, despite their sheen of objectivity and the way they can mask and reproduce injustices. In this paper, we draw on five years of observations at the climate negotiations to explore the recent emergence of tensions around climate accounting on the international stage as climate justice advocates increasingly insist on “just” methods of accounting that allocate the remaining carbon budget fairly —with an eye towards distributional justice. And yet, it is the indeterminacy surrounding what might replace current accounting methods that seems to close down more ambitious and just possibilities for both negotiators and activists.\n\nPanel 2: Interlocutors’ Pragmatic Production of Indeterminacy and Unknowability |JRRB 397\n\nOrganizer: AES/APLA/CAE\n\nChair and Discussant: Michael Lambek, University of Toronto\n\nMarco Motta, University of Neuchâtel, “The Vagueness of Concepts: Lessons on Ordinary Language from the Perspective of Haiti”\n\nIn this paper, I will show that vagueness and opacity are, more often than not, precisely what concepts need in order to be what they are and to do what they are meant to do. Drawing on fieldwork in Haiti, I will show how certain ways of using ordinary language are precisely meant to cultivate a kind of indirectness and indeterminacy, notably over what is taken for fact as well as what is considered context. Indeed, there are ways of speaking that destabilize our confidence in a stable and determinate knowledge of the world. Moreover, the often allusive, equivocal, and ambiguous character of the use of language seems to doom any effort to draw sharp lines between concepts. What this puts into question is not only the idea that for concepts to be concepts, they need to be clearly delimited and defined; it also questions our drive to certainty. And though vagueness may at times serve specific or even strategic purposes (like in courts or love affairs) this is not always the case. In fact, vagueness is inherent to language as a whole, thus to a whole form of life. Through a few examples, I will show the aesthetic and political importance of the improvised, playful, and poetic dimensions of everyday speech.\n\nSeema Golestaneh, Cornell University, “Indeterminacy as Epistemic Practice: Mysticism, Knowledge and Precarity in Iran”\n\nIn my research among Islamic mystics in Iran, I encountered a number of individuals and collectives who embraced a particular form of mystical knowledge called ma‘rifat. While much has been written on the concept of ma‘rifat over the years, my focus is the particular hermeneutic stance of my interlocutors— the Iranian Nimatullahi Sufis. I translate ma‘rifat, in their sense of the term, as “unknowing”. In affirming the unfathomability of God, unknowing operates as an engaged awareness that we (humanity) know very little, approximating nothing. Yet this intense awareness of the limitations of human cognizance is not thought to impede intellectual contemplation; rather it is an opportunity to position oneself at a precipice, the limits of knowability, which becomes a point from which it is possible to develop new epistemologies. Just as indeterminacy speaks to an acknowledgement or emphasis on that which is ambiguous and unsettled, so too does unknowing involve an engagement with that which is fundamentally inscrutable and beyond our reach. In this paper, I will first consider how unknowing is articulated and practiced by Nimatullahi Sufis as an epistemic practice. I will then examine their embrace of unknowing in light of the fact that the position of Sufis within the Iranian socio-political sphere is both tenuous and unclear, with significant implications for their ability to practice freely. I will conclude with a brief speculative discussion on what insights unknowing might offer into the production of anthropological knowledge as a whole.\n\nAhona Palchoudhuri, Brown University, “The Indeterminacy of a Request: Rain-Making Rituals in Rural Bengal”\n\nWhat is it that we know and don’t know when we say “please”? Linguistic anthropologists (Levinson 1983) have studied how strategies of request often deploy an aesthetics of doubt via which petitioners adopt tones of uncertainty and indirectness as ways of mounting affective pressure on their addresses. Rather than reducing the petitioner’s uncertainty to a culture of politeness (Felix-Brasdefer 2005), I consider how the forms of doubt built into a request also enable the mutability of its content. Such an open-endedness of what it is that one needs is characteristic of life lived in material precarity, in which an unpredictability of circumstance often demands an everyday renegotiation of aspiration and resource. I situate my examination of the relation between doubt and request in an ethnographic study of rain making rituals in the Bankura district of rural West Bengal, where minor fluctuations in the daily tempo of rain often determine whether there will be a drought or a flood. I find that rain-making rituals in Bankura are structured so as to simultaneously request the presence and absence of rain.\n\nBilal Nadeem, Stanford University, “Between Piety and the Everyday: Islam, Faith, and Reason during a Public Health Emergency”\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic gave rise to new epistemic struggles and discursive possibilities at the nexus of theological modes of reasoning and public health rationality. Conducting ethnographic research in the UK during Covid-19, I illustrate how some Sunni Muslims brought religious ways of knowing to bear on the indeterminacies of pandemic life. First, my interlocutors granted a cardinal place to concerns for their tawakkul (trust in divine plan). Yet, they articulated different notions of what constituted reliance on God, ultimately translating these notions to a spectrum of attitudes towards vaccination, social isolation, and quarantining. Second, amid protracted uncertainty engendered by the pandemic, these Muslims attempted to locate divine wisdom within disordered physiological processes associated with coronavirus, the efficacy of public health restrictions, and broader social transformations consequent to the pandemic. All in all, in concerns related to their tawakkul and their explorations of divine wisdom, my interlocutors attempted to vest secular, scientific knowledge and everyday life under a public health emergency with sacred meaning in ways that destabilized paradigmatic divisions between piety and the everyday.\n\nPanel 3: Legal Figurations |Aaron Burr Hall 209\n\nOrganizer: AES/APLA/CAE\n\nChair and Discussant: Tobias Kelly, Edinburgh University\n\nSmoki Musaraj, Ohio University, “Remittances, Kinship, and the Rule of Law: An Ethnography of Judicial Reform at the European Periphery?\n\nJudicial reforms have become important rites of passage to European Union accession. Mandated by transnational bodies and implemented by local commissions, such reforms are often shot through with indeterminacy around the very notions of legitimate wealth and legitimate exchange. Such indeterminacy arises primarily from the legal pluralism that constitutes these reforms. This paper explores the inherent indeterminacies of judicial reforms in transitional justice contexts by taking a closer look at the vetting of judges and prosecutors that has been taking place in Albania since 2016. Assets of sitting judges and prosecutors are evaluated by two local independent commissions and monitored by an international body. The legitimacy of these assets is often a subject of contention and a leading cause for demoting judges and prosecutors. In justifying such assets, remittances and gifts from intimate partners and kin, typically in cash, are often presented by the defendants. These financial assets are, at times, deemed as illegitimate and, other times, as legitimate sources of wealth. Remittances constituted a widespread source of income for Albanians in the 1990s and 2000s, yet they are often difficult to document given their informal nature. Based on courtroom observations of hearings at the two commissions between 2019-2021, this presentation explores the various ways that money, kinship, and law intertwine in the assessment of remittances and gifts as legitimate/illegitimate sources of wealth. I note how these contestations speak to multiple and contradictory cultural notions of kinship and legitimate exchange among kin. Drawing upon Viviana Zelizer’s work on money and social ties, I explore how intimate and kinship relations are defined and contested in the vetting process by various parties. Further, I examine how these contestations contribute to a general state of indeterminacy of the legal and cultural framework of judicial reform in transitional justice contexts.\n\nJohana Romer, University of Essex, “’Voy de Mariscos’: Bureaucratic Closure in Catalan Judicial Process”\n\nWhat are the theological and political discourses that shape judges’ and criminal justice professionals’ understandings of violence in a Catalan carceral system? While much has been written about the subjective experience of uncertainty engendered by neoliberalism, the relationship between neoliberal bureaucratic processes and uncertainty is variegated. Taking as a case study the transformation of the role of penal judges in a Catalan criminal justice system in a neoliberalizing Spanish region, this paper explores the effects of neoliberal policies on judicial procedure in this context. It argues that neoliberal processes have ultimately magnified the power of prosecutors and some prison staff in determining outcomes in sentencing and parole, leading penal judges and some professionals to seek alternative responses to conflict within carceral institutions.\n\nPablo Aguilera Del Castillo. University of Pennsylvania, “Environmental Expertise as Doubt and Multiplicity: The Political and Epistemic Affordances of Indeterminacy in the Collaborations Between Water Chemists and Environmental Lawyers in Mexico”\n\nSimultaneously a source of doubt and multiplicity, indeterminacy conjures notions of incompleteness and unfinishedness. But perhaps interrogating indeterminacy can illustrate how its productivity lies precisely in this dual nature. In this paper, I examine the relationships between law and science in the case of Mexican environmentalism in Yucatan. Building on my fieldwork research, this paper focuses on how environmental lawyers borrow scientific concepts in their legal statements and how scientists rely on legal boundaries in the construction of their scientific claims. I examine this complex process, paying close attention to the role of the “precautionary principle,” “shifting burdens of proof,” the existence of “reasonable doubt,” “catastrophic risk,” and the changeability of “pollution thresholds.” By analyzing the use of these concepts between lawyers and scientists, I offer an initial reflection on how indeterminacy becomes a fertile ground for the cultivation of new ethical practices and political subjectivities among Yucatecans. This approach to the study of environmentalism illustrates how the crises are not just discursively rich events, but also epistemically important sites of knowledge making practices.\n\nSara Omar, Georgetown University, Sexing and Governing Indeterminate Bodies in Islamic Law\n\nPaper Abstract: Muslim jurists have historically defined sex as a particular set of genital acts. Males in contrast to females were expected to perform different gendered roles during coitus. Indeed, gender differentiation was a major component of Muslim scholars’ socio-legal system of hierarchy. Since Jurists’ legal determinations resulted in tangible socio-legal and spiritual consequences, they were invested in sexing bodies along gendered lines to the extent possible. As such, no single body could remain sexually neutral and ungendered after reaching the age of puberty. Given this framework, what did medieval jurists do with indeterminate bodies that defied the male/female binary? Did they force them to fit into their legal system, which was rooted in a fundamental presumption of sex and gender polarity? How did they legally accommodate unsexed and unsexable bodies? This paper explores such questions while examining the process and ways in which Muslim jurists sought to sex, socialize and consequently govern all bodies exclusively along the male/female binary.\n\nSarah P. Robinson, Critical Inquiries Research, “Sally Moore’s Theory of Process: Absolute Indeterminacy as Starting Point and Background Condition”\n\n“Almost 50 years ago, in 1975, Sally Moore (1924-2021) articulated a powerful theory of process, which she used, argued for, and developed over her long and brilliant career in anthropology. Process is both method and idea: a way of approaching fieldwork and a way of making sense of materials gathered. While notoriously difficult to sum up, process focuses on human action in the flow of time and is a way of studying – and seeing, in one frame – efforts to create order and efforts to unmake or remake order. Of critical importance, process rests on “the basic postulate . . . that the underlying quality of social life should be considered to be one of theoretically absolute indeterminacy” (1975:232). As such, efforts at fixity may reduce (but never eliminate) indeterminacy, but only for a time, and efforts against fixity or towards new fixities exploit indeterminacy and may create more or less indeterminacy. The contexts in which Moore developed and used process ideas included, famously, studies of law and of the state. This paper: (1) examines Moore’s theory of process in detail, including the notion of absolute indeterminacy as starting point and background condition, (2) argues that Moore’s theory of process is highly valuable for addressing the dis-order of our present, and (3) argues, in particular, that Moore’s theory of process can should be used to develop a highly productive approach to an anthropology of the state.\n\nPanel 4: Indeterminacies in Life Courses | JRRB A12\n\nOrganizer: AES/APLA/CAE\n\nChair and Discussant: Jackie Solway, Trent University\n\nMiranda Tuckett, New School, “Choreographing Death: Negotiating Ambivalence around Dying through Gift Giving and Narration”\n\nIn October 2021, a woman I call Theresa died an assisted death in Switzerland. Those of us who had been present received an ornament a week later with a note that read: “The Stars are Bright Tonight, Love Theresa”. This was one of many material gifts and artifacts that made up Theresa’s death. Alongside gift giving, this paper will focus on a text that Theresa wrote before she died in which she details a conversation between “mind and matter”. Theresa articulates the tension as one between desire and fact. This text demonstrates the internal paradoxes of secular understandings of personhood, rationality, and decision making. There is an assumption that resistance to assisted dying concerns the biopolitical powers of the state. This analysis doesn’t help to understand the ambivalence present among those who are planning to die. This ambivalence is often overlooked or repressed. Building on over 12 months of fieldwork in London and Switzerland, this paper attends to how Theresa choreographed her death. I contend that the term choreography can be opened up to consider doubt and ambivalence as it relates to self-reflexive personhood and decision making. I consider the notion of choreography as a form of narrating one’s death which stays with uncertainty.\n\nKim Shively, Kutztown University of Pennsylvania, “Cemetery Establishment as Place-Making: Death and Muslim Exiles in the U.S.\n\nMuslims who experience exile often face indeterminacy as they age and face death. Many Muslim migrants wish to be returned to their homelands for burial, in part because they view burial in Muslim contexts as important to accruing the blessings that will help them on Judgment Day. But what happens when repatriation is impossible? This paper examines how Muslim refugees living in the US reconsider the final dispositions of their bodies, seeking new models to guide them in their decision-making about death in “ghurba” (a foreign place). Some feel they have a renewed relationship with major figures of the Muslim past since they, like the Prophet Muhammad, will be buried not in their homeland but in ghurba. To follow the example of the Prophet in this respect, Muslims have established new Muslim cemeteries in the US, which allows for migrants to worry less about missing the blessings that come from being buried in Muslim contexts, since they reconceptualize burial in ghurba as generating the blessings associated with following the life of the Prophet. This paper examines how cemetery establishment as place-making is an essential way in which Muslim exiles create a more certain future for themselves in this world and the next.\n\nPierre Minn, University of Montreal, “Voluntary Childlessness and Indeterminate Futures”\n\nThe Canadian province of Québec has gone from having one of the world’s highest fertility rates to one of the lowest in less than a century. A growing number of young adults in Québec are publicly stating their intentions not to have biological children, with some resorting to surgical sterilization procedures as a way of embodying their decisions. In this paper, I will explore the indeterminacies that result when Millennials and members of Generation Z take positions against their own and others’ biological reproduction. Working against assumptions that young heterosexual men are not concerned with paternity or reproduction, I propose an ethnographic investigation of how straight, cisgender Québécois men imagine or foreclose their personal and collective futures. This study is of particular salience in Québec, a minority-majority polity founded through settler colonialism where the continued existence of the French-Canadian population was historically attributed to high fertility. Drawing on feminist and queer work of reproduction and futurity, this study considers the influence of climate change, heritage, masculinity and linguistic identities on decisions not to father children.\n\nPanel 5: The Political Uses of Semiotic Indeterminacy | JRRB 399\n\nOrganizer: Ilana Gershon, Rice University\n\nChair: Ilana Gershon, Rice University\n\nPanel Abstract: There is often ambiguity in what signs mean, and this ambiguity can serve different political ends depending on the structured ways the ambiguity is formulated and interpreted. Sometimes a sign can be openly recognized as multivalent by a heterogeneous community of interpreters. Sometimes a sign is seen as tightly tied to a particular meaning, despite how the sign is actually deployed in practice. Sometimes formulators believe the sign is a transparent representation, yet the sign’s interpreters will have none of this putative transparency in meaning. How people make use of and respond to semiotic indeterminacy reveals a great deal about how people enact power relationships in a variety of publics and institutional settings. These papers each focus on one way in which semiotic indeterminacy can be structured – such as a strategically deployed shifter ala Urciuoli – and explores what possibilities are created or prevented through strategic use of this ambiguity.\n\nBonnie Urciuoli, Hamilton College, “Revisiting the strategically deployable shifter, or, manipulating indeterminacy for power and profit”\n\nThe making of meaning is fundamentally indexical, tied to the conditions in which it is produced, always subject to change, revision, and alternate interpretations. Semiotic indeterminacy is thus built into the social nature of meaning-making. While not generally an issue in routine discourse, institutional and organizational fields of discourse are often concerned with control of discursive ambiguity. In fields of discourse such as politics and marketing, concerned as they are with messaging and persuasion linked to the power, positioning, and profit, the semiotic potential provided by indeterminacy is manipulated to produce meaning that appears both fixed and vague, at least among those engaged in the discourse. Why such investment in manipulating semiotic indeterminacy into an appearance of determinacy? The answer lies in what gets indexed by such manipulation: the nature of these fields of discourse, the means by which their agents exercise control or authority, for whose benefit, toward what desired outcome (not that it always works). To illustrate this, I discuss what I have called strategically deployable shifters: discursive acts in which social actors operating in such fields take advantage of the indeterminacy of terms like skills or communication or diversity while performing what appear to be acts of clear-cut reference. Such usage points to and recreates strategic social alignments, a function far outweighing the importance of denotative specificity. Building on this analysis (originally developed to account for promotional usage in corporate and corporatized higher education registers), I explore these principles in greater detail.\n\nAnna Weichselbraun, Berggruen Institute, “On the semiotic indeterminacy of the security seal”\n\nThe tamper-indicating seal in nuclear facilities is widely understood as a simple binary sign: the seal is either intact or broken, and these poles map onto a moral binary. Intact seals indicate compliant behavior, whereas broken seals indicate something suspicious. Yet, the seal’s status as apparently simple and binary conceals a semiotic indeterminacy that is put to use politically in the ethnographic context of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s nuclear safeguards program. Nuclear inspectors apply seals in the nuclear facilities of member states to ensure that the verified nuclear resources in the facility is not tampered with in their absence. This paper examines, in a first step, the use of tamper-indicating security seals at the IAEA, and the work that is put into making the sign become legible as binary. In a second step, it examines how the interpretation of a seal as broken occurs iteratively across a bureaucratic structure that mobilizes various actors into a common meaning-making project that is, however, filled with tensions. Whereas the IAEA’s bureaucratic staff wants to find maximally stable meanings that can stand on their own, the diplomats take up these meanings only to unsettle them again. The seal’s semiotic indeterminacy thus becomes a powerful resource in the search for causality and intention which might ultimately determine the moral status of the member state under scrutiny.\n\nElana Resnick, UC Santa Barbara, “The Determined Indeterminacy of White Supremacy”\n\nThis talk explores how manifestations of systemic white supremacy take hold through the widespread politics of racial disavowal. Rooted in ethnographic and archival research in Sofia, Bulgaria, I examine how strategies of what I call “determined indeterminacy” naturalize white supremacy and institutional racism. Determined indeterminacy is a collective method of deniability—the institutional and everyday denial of the systemic racism that undergirds social life. Tracing the changing politics of racial disavowal within a long history of racial erasures might help us understand how the strategic indeterminacy of contemporary white supremacy takes shape and works to naturalize, transform, and fix longstanding racial hierarchies.\n\nJosh Babcock, University of Chicago, and Ilana Gershon, Rice University, “The State Ignoring Subject: Ideologies of Substantive and Procedural Listening in U.S. School Board Meetings”\n\nIn this paper, we turn to recent US school board meetings to explore how semiotic indeterminacy underpins the ways people organize to ignore specific participant roles in local democratic contexts. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, school boards across the U.S. gained widespread public attention as ideological battlegrounds. This was not substantively new, school boards were crucial sites at which the state met the street in prior moments, even if mediatized public attention was being directed in new ways. Yet more than the variable substance of the policies-qua-“issues” that refracted binary partisan frames (and vice versa), what emerged in these school board meetings was a persistent question of how the state listens to its citizens – or not. In this paper, we conceptualize the “state ignoring subject” as a figure that gets institutionally structured and interpersonally inhabited in the reflexively public space of the U.S. school board meeting. We elaborate the semiotic and institutional strategies through which procedural listening gets used to block the forms of substantive listening that are variously demanded by meeting attendees, both explicitly through verbal discourse, and implicitly through conduct. We show how individuals work to inhabit and challenge the figure of the state ignoring subject, not in order to refuse seats at the metaphorical table, but to strategically manage what happens after seats are allocated and voices are given space in situations where it has been determined in advance that some groups’ called-for outcomes should be categorically ignored. We build on scholarship in the anthropology of the state and bureaucracy along with linguistic anthropological theorizations of the racially hegemonic listening subject to show how ignoring stands as a constitutive modality of liberal democracy and depends on patterned forms of semiotic indeterminacy.\n\nPanel 6: The Indeterminacy of Exchange: Graeber’s Contributions to Economic Anthropology Revisited | JRRB 301\n\nOrganizer: Jeremy L. Jones, College of the Holy Cross and Chris Vasantkumar, Macquarie University\n\nChair: Jeremy L. Jones, College of the Holy Cross\n\nDiscussant: Gustav Peebles, New School\n\nPanel Abstract: While the late David Graeber’s oeuvre ranges widely across key anthropological terrains, few scholars have contributed so much to economic anthropology’s recent revitalization. Not since the middle of the last century has an anthropologist achieved such massive crossover success with broader audiences. Yet, that achievement has itself for the most part preempted rigorous assessment of his work’s specifically anthropological claims. Relatedly, an over-attention to his anarchist and critical realist leanings tends to obscure his deep debts to scholars such as TPolanyi, Turner, Munn, Mauss, Pietz, MacGaffey, and Weiner, as well as, perhaps surprisingly, to structuralism and other modes of formalist conceptualization. Redressing such elisions, our panel revisits Graeber’s economic work in a critical yet generative manner, opening up his thought to productive reassessment via a focus on his work’s influential yet often indeterminate connections to key anthropological interlocutors. It does so in regard to three main thematic foci. First, it elaborates the consequences of his stark delineation of the “human” from the “economic” for his understanding of value and social creativity in the “dream economies” of early European colonialism in Africa and the Americas vis a vis Mauss and Parry’s understandings of the person(a) in the context of various kinds of exchange. Second, it situates his work on debt against his work on theories of value, and considers how his separation of “hierarchy,” “exchange,” and the ur-principle of “baseline communism” might be read through the Marxist-structuralist lens of “transformation.” Finally, it assesses the often-implicit debts Graeber owes to feminist economic anthropology, particularly with regard to the work of Annette Weiner and the gens as a key conceptual mechanism for delinking relational economic performances from received logics of singularity.\n\nChris Vasantkumar, Macquarie University, “Un-Making Graeber’s Fetishisms: Rethinking Person, Value and Social Creativity in Colonial “Dream Economies””\n\nMy paper reads David Graeber’s work on “human economies” against the grain to reclaim some space for a non-reductive understanding of the roles played by other-than-human entities in the various sorts of interactions commonly glossed as “exchange” or “economic” relations. Specifically, it contrasts his nuanced (if sometimes slightly slippery) readings of ethnological and historical accounts of European colonialism in Africa and the Americas with his assumptions about the anthropocentrism and secularity of all economic behavior. Key here is the tension between his engagement with Mauss and Parry’s writings on the complexity of the notion of the persons/personae involved in any particular exchange (which can be individual and/or collective, human and/or other-than-human) and his reliance on reductive notions of the Fetish and religion more generally which cast any engagement with the non-human as “our own actions coming back at us.” Ultimately, I argue that the often but not always implicit secularism and anthropocentrism of Graeber’s conceptualization of the economic makes it nearly impossible for him to reckon with Wyatt MacGaffey’s more nuanced elaboration of the fetish, in which the latter emerges as a kind of gift-adjacent mode of rooting contracts in/routing contracts through the broader supernatural universe of its African participants. Nor does it allow him to capture the ontological significance of the Fetish within the “dream economies” that characterized the cultural confrontations of early European colonialism in Africa and the Americas in its own terms (as opposed to Marx’s). This in turn leads him to disastrously rehabilitate the discredited colonialist trope of “‘making fetish’ – as a form of collective investment [in which] one can, in effect, create a new god on the spot.” As result his work on value and social creativity simultaneously overstates the ephemerality of African “gods” and underestimates the inarguability of our own.\n\nJeremy L. Jones, College of the Holy Cross, “Debt: A Degenerative Template”\n\nThis paper reads David Graeber’s history of debt against the backdrop of his earlier work on value, and considers the animating role of violence in each. In analyzing debt, Graeber proposes a tripartite structure of animating moral principles: “baseline communism,” “exchange,” and “hierarchy.” His emphasis on the “baseline” quality of communism is drawn directly from his reading of Mauss, particularly the latter’s political writing. It is intended, we can surmise, as a response to and reframing of several streams of anthropological and political thought: the perennial claim that non-Euroamerican “traditions” were socialist avant la lettre, the zombie-like persistence of the gift-commodity divide, which he deems to be a product of “formalist economism,” and of course the central ideology of our times, that society is an amalgamation of individuals pursuing marginal utility. It is notable, though, that Graeber does not define “exchange” and “hierarchy” as being “baseline.” In part this is a historical argument: the book traces the way violence, including the violence of state structures, shifted the baseline “human economy” into new historical forms. But it often feels like a logical argument, too, with the “baseline” figuring as the simplest–and most violence free–form of the three. Tied to this, I argue, is a question of how these moral principles fit with the specific reading of Marx and structuralism that informs his analysis of value. I explore this link by revisiting his rendering of the polyvalent concept of “transformation.”\n\nCaroline E. Schuster, Australian National University, “Graeber and the GENS: Recalling Debts to Feminist Economic Anthropology”\n\nI first read David Graeber’s Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value in Jessica Cattelino’s graduate seminar in the mid-2000s, shortly after the book was published. We read it as a companion text to the great Melanesian ethnographies of gendered social orders: Weiner, Munn, Strathern. It was only much later, and through my engagement with the GENS collective and their feminist manifesto for the study of capitalism, that I came to appreciate the great debt owed to feminist exchange theory within anthropological theories of value, and particularly Graeber´s contributions to economic anthropology. This talk revisits the three-way connection between gender, value, and exchange that was so central to the Melanesianist anthropological project, and vital to the ethnographic record upon which Graeber built his theory of economic action. Is it possible to decouple the feminist theoretical commitments in this corpus of work from its contributions to economic analysis and understanding of value? What new political alliances and theoretical insights might be gained by foregrounding the often-implicit critique of gendered inequalities in Graeber’s formidable contributions, and by making explicit the intellectual debts owed to the women whose work marked out its foundations?\n\nRoundtable 1: Visualizing Indeterminacy | Aaron Burr Hall 216\n\nOrganizer: Carolyn Rouse, Princeton University\n\nChair: Carolyn Rouse, Princeton University\n\nAbstract: This roundtable focuses on the use of data visualizations to represent complex ethnographic data. Princeton’s Department of Anthropology created the Ethnographic Data Visualization Lab (VizE Lab) to re-engage visual anthropology theory and practice in the digital age. For the roundtable, Jeff Himpele will discuss recent efforts by Princeton’s VizE Lab to incorporate data visualizations into cultural anthropology theory and pedagogy. He will discuss how data visualization can extend anthropology’s purview beyond the sensorial horizons and limits of ethnographic fieldwork while making intelligible a wide range of complexities. Carolyn Rouse and Ivan Melchor will discuss how the VizE Lab is being used to visualize indeterminate flooding risks in New Jersey. The visualizations are meant to help engineers and policy advocates imagine alternative land management horizons. Ken Anderson will discuss how he employed data visualizations at Intel to represent patterns, within cultural indeterminacy, for humanistic design. Finally, Laurence Ralph will describe how he is working to teach political advocates to use visualizations to inspire policy change.\n\nPanelists:\n\nJeff Himpele, Princeton University\n\nLaurence Ralph, Princeton University\n\nKen Anderson, Princeton University\n\nIvan Melchor, Princeton University\n\nCarolyn Rouse, Princeton University\n\nSalon: The Gloaming | Aaron Burr Hall Third Floor Lounge\n\nOrganizer: Amy Stambach, (UW-Madison)\n\nWhether you read all or only a few pages of Melanie Finn’s The Gloaming (2016, Two Dollar Radio), you will not miss the fact that its theme of indeterminacy diffuses into questions about anthropological reasoning and the possibility that spectral forces move the world. This salon will summon some of the most shimmering passages of Finn’s work to consider how the gloaming—the twilight, the netherworld of tragedy and guilt—conjures a world more powerful, more formidable and persuasive than, well, what? Anthropology?\n\nPanel 1: Migrant Paths Through Bureaucracy | JRRB A12\n\nOrganizer: AES/APLA/CAE\n\nChair and Discussant: Julie Kleinman, Fordham University\n\nThis paper analyzes the hopes and futurity of LGBTQI+ East Africans on the move from Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo, who are seeking refugee protection in the Republic of Uganda despite the state’s necropolitics exerted on queer populations, and locates their hopes within the broader political, economic, and social context of relations in queer daily life in Kampala. This chapter draws on in-depth interviews translated from Kiswahili, Kirundi, and Luganda with 9 queer migrants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 4 queer migrants from Burundi, and participant observation in a queer indigenous NGO in Kampala, Uganda (2022), including interviews with lawyers and community organizers working on needs in the growing community of queer migrants seeking protection in Uganda. Preliminary findings reveal that queer migrants from DRC and Burundi share plans of starting small businesses in Uganda, using skills gained in DRC and Burundi in the creative economy (such as catering Congolese food, tailoring Kitenge fashions, or recording and producing music in Kirundi or Kiswahili) and hopes of eventually being placed by UNHCR in a third country that are intertwined with the complex intimacies of gender and sexuality, identity, sex work, and care. Community organizers working with queer migrants in Uganda report that most queer migrants have faced extreme food insecurity in the past 2 years, that queer migrants from Somalia remain segregated from those from Burundi and DRC in the Kampala social landscape, and queer refugees migrating from Rwanda are increasingly using claims of DRC citizenship to enter Uganda.\n\nElizabeth Rubio, Princeton University, “What is (to the) Left of Citizenship?: Indeterminacies of Paperless Immigrant Justice”\n\nThe question “what is left of citizenship?” (Nyers 2004) in the era of post-9/11 securitization-hysteria and neoliberal state withdrawal is one of enduring social scientific concerns. Dismantling liberal logics that assume continuities between citizenship, rights, and state protection, scholars have upset the notion that 21st century citizenship is a good of unambiguous value. Arguing that the immigrant’s pursuit of citizenship is precisely what aids the nation-state’s “refoundings” (Honig 2005) and lends borders their legitimacy (DeGenova and Peutz 2010), they have also framed said pursuit as a conservative investment. Yet liberal political discourse falsely equates immigrant activists’ outermost political horizons with expansion of citizenship regimes. As such, collective visions that view citizenship as a conduit of harm rather than liberation are often obscured. Through ethnography with undocumented US-based activists enacting abolitionist approaches to citizenship, this paper explores the indeterminacies that attend to collective projects oriented “to the left of” citizenship. If citizenship is one of those universal liberal goods Spivak says we “cannot not want,” what does it look like to strive to refuse it?\n\nSina Mirzai, Johns Hopkins University, “What Creates a Sense of Belonging among Kurds in New York City?”\n\nAfter the very recent event of Jîna (Mahsa) Amini’s murder, a young Kurdish woman at the hands of the Iranian morality police, global awareness of Kurdish identity has increased. This paper ethnographically explores the meaning of Kurdishness among four interlocutors from different areas living in New York City. Interactions with them raised questions around the discourse of the Kurdish diaspora in the US, namely how they find each other and identify as Kurds in relation to 1) their lived-experiences in the United States and 2) Persian, Turkish, and Arab communities. By attending to their experiences of Kurdish background either here or back home, as well as their search for finding other Kurds, I explore what shapes the interlocutors’ sense of belonging and why this belonging is important to them. I argue that my interlocutors seek a more complex “unifying experience” in relation to their Kurdishness nationalism within American culture. In the end, we see the events of the past (such as genocide, persecution, assimilationist project, and state violence against Kurdish gender and ethnicity) are indeed parts of the complexities of the diasporic Kurds in America. And it helps us to rethink the meaning of immigration and nationalism one more time through diasporic emotions.\n\nMarcelo Giacomazzi Camargo, University of Brasília, “History, haunted: Haitian activism in São Paulo and the ghost of slavery”\n\nIn the world of Haitian migration to São Paulo, sustaining a dignified mode of living is often described as breaking free from the past and moving into the future. This idea arises between the initial boom of Haitian arrivals to the country and its descent into economic recession. In this period, the then-bustling sectors of civil construction and factory farming differentially incorporated scores of Haitian workers, and tales of physical abuse, unpaid wages, and life-altering injuries abounded. Haitian activism in Brazil arose in response to these realities. Migration was described as an experiment in uniting geographic and historical movement; the move to Brazil would be a move to where the future could be found. Violent capitalist bondage, activists argued, interrupted this momentum, and left Haitians in a form of temporal stasis that risked allowing the ever-encroaching ghost of slavery to catch up. This paper will think with the reflections of Haitian activists in São Paulo today, who interpret this state of historical indeterminacy through their everyday encounters with racism. Racism’s fractality, its capacity to emerge in equally threatening ways across echelons of social life, emerges as evidence of a pervasive national tendency to push Black migrants back through history into the position of slaves ostensibly left behind after the Haitian Revolution and Brazilian abolition. In addition to their direct strategies to combat dispossession, Haitian activists foster a kind of categorical ambiguity by describing their political ties with Brazilians as kinship and laying claim to Brazilian identities for themselves consequently. In a public forum where being Haitian means being Black, and where being Black puts one at risk of temporal displacement, becoming Brazilian is an attempt to upset the given national-racial script and introduce descriptive confusion to avoid crystallization into the preferential object of slavery.\n\nPanel 2: Death and Dying from the Region of the Feminine (Will run continuously from 1.15-3.30) | JRRB 399\n\nOrganizer: Clara Han, Johns Hopkins University\n\nChair: Clara Han, Johns Hopkins University\n\nDiscussants: Miriam Ticktin, CUNY and Lotte Segal, University of Edinburgh\n\nPanel Abstract: This double panel takes the experience of death and dying as a site from which to consider how the feminine region – the attention to detail and minor figures – allows for indeterminacy within knowledge and helps us rethink politics, justice, and care. Feminist anthropology has intervened on dominant models of politics which assume a stable boundary between the domestic and the political-jural. Feminist theory on care, on the other hand, has taken care as attention to particulars against a theory of justice, understood in terms of universal principles. Each of the panel participants have examined the ways in which women’s perspectives usher forth different imaginations of justice and politics: the ways in which revolution is imagined and embodied in Iran today and the ways in which mothers seeking justice challenge state legitimacy; the feminine refusal to forgive endemic impunities in relation to the Bangladesh war; the ways in the household and women’s intimate labors recasts the dominant literature on gangs and drug trafficking; how women’s ascetic subjectivities recast the ritual vow on the fast to death. The panel takes as its anchor a method of engaging the minor, as Veena Das puts it, “..we might ask what happens when you start, not so much with the stance of complete innocence with regard to concepts (as if you had never heard the words state, power, or society before) but by acknowledging an indeterminacy on where these are to be found? How could concepts that social scientists use be rethought so as to be seen not as super concepts that belong to some hallowed sites of abstract thought but as humble and quotidian in that they criss-cross with everyday concepts” (Das, 2022: 133-134). This panel responds to this provocation to create concepts via attention to the minor within sites marked by catastrophic violence and chronic grinding violence that shape experiences of death and dying.\n\nChowra Makaremi, EHESS, “ “Mothers who want justice” in Iran”\n\nFrom the “mothers of Khavaran” who demanded truth about the fate of their children, imprisoned and killed in the 1980s, to the “mothers seeking justice” (madaran-e dadkhah) who denounce States killings of protesters from 2017 up until today, movements of “mothers” have radically challenged State legitimacy in Iran, while traveling from the periphery to the center of public attention. The paper will explore the history of different generations and organizations of justice seeking mothers since the 1979 revolution: How did they reconfigure the relationships between affects, kinship and politics? How did these changes reshape the practice of political resistance, drawing one genealogy (among others) of the “Woman Life Freedom” movement, and shedding light on its scope and meanings?\n\nNayanika Mookherjee, Durham University, “Irreconciliation and feminine indeterminacy of the Bangladesh War”\n\nIn Denktagebuch (Thought Diaries, 1950-1973) Hannah Arendt wrote that acts which cannot be forgiven are beyond punishment and hence cannot be reconciled to. In this paper, I draw from Arendt to further theorize and extend the concept of irreconciliation* and reflect on the lessons of feminine indeterminacy that is central to the idea of justice of the Bangladesh war. This allows me to reflect critically on the interdisciplinary scholarship on reconciliation, apology and forgiveness and theorize irreconciliation as a less examined lens of analysis. Most post-conflict reconciliatory exercises make it incumbent upon survivors to forgive and seek closure as an exhibition of ‘moving on’. Rather than being in opposition to ‘peace’, or be equated to revenge, irreconciliation instead allows various feminine subjectivities of the Bangladesh war to interrogate the status quo by refusing to forgive endemic impunities, particularly in the aftermath of staged processes of justice and absence-presence of the rule of law. As an ethnographically less examined phenomenon, I argue that the indeterminacy of irreconciliation allows an important examination of the ‘rule of law’ within processes of unresolved genocidal injustices.\n\nShahla Talebi, Arizona State University, ““How Many Times We have to die in order to Live?””\n\nIf life and death are not to be perceived as mutually exclusive, with birth taken “as the inception of a linear stretch of time over which a particular life is lived and death as the moment of cessation of that time, but “as working together…within each moment”, as Das and Han suggest (2015), invoking Dōgen’s view, or if, “after death, our molecules continue their journey through the ecosystem…where “a cancer cell could potentially leave the body at death and continue as a life form indefinitely, …,” or if “Many kinds of death at the organism level occur despite health of most of the organs or cells in the body”, or if “Memories not only move between tissues in the same body, they can apparently be moved across bodies” (Levin 2021), then how we may conjure a feminine notion of life, death, body, soul, self and other in light of the recent revolutionary movement in Iran? Can a feminine perspective imagine the victory or/and the defeat of a revolution differently, avoiding the conventional masculine views of them as mutually exclusive instances? What may a feminine anthropology offer to social movements where so many lives lost, so much suffering endured and yet the possibility of a better future appears so fragile if not lacking? What kind of healing or cure may be possible if we imagine different notions of life and death, self and other, memories, imagination and dreams? What can we learn from the Iranian youngsters and their recent revolutionary uprisings?\n\nMiki Chase, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, “The ambiguity of the vow: Indeterminate forms of ideal death in the Jain practice of santhara”\n\nThe Jain fast until death, known variably as sallekhana, santhara, or samadhi-maran, is undertaken mostly by laywomen and enacted as a ritual vow. Legal contestation of santhara has led to masculinist discourse that subsumes anxieties around voluntary death as a feminine mode of ascetic practice into questions of communal religious rights. This talk shifts from legal and doctrinal constructions of Jain pedagogy to bring ethnographic attention to dying spaces within the home, asking how laywomen’s santhara deaths are made morally intelligible within social configurations of kinship and community shaped by gendered narratives, matriarchal roles, and the intimacy of everyday life. Anthropological insights in this talk illuminate the vow as not merely an act of individual agency, engaging women’s embedded ascetic subjectivities to reflect on how agency, embodiment, and voice are simultaneously dispersed and collaborative in socially (re)producing the religious ideality of santhara deaths. At the same time, this talk considers how the vow can be otherwise seen as a gesture of ethical repair to achieve a good death even when a religiously ideal death is beyond reach.\n\nClara Han, Johns Hopkins University, “Household Events: Drug Economies and Multiple domestics”\n\nIn the social science literature on drug economies and gangs, the figure of the male gang member and the street have retained a central place, undergirded by assumptions about drug economies as operated by coherent associational networks or “gangs”. In studies that attempt to shift discussions of gang life to topics such as disability, the male perspective continues to be privileged, and questions of care (who is caring for the wounded, the bedridden) are suppressed and unattended to. This paper draws on research in a police-occupied low-income neighborhood in Santiago, Chile. It seeks to shift the focus of drug economies from one positioned on the male gang member and “the street” to household events with attention to the perspective of women. It asks how drug economies and police violence look from these perspectives, what counts as significant, and how justice comes to be imagined from a region of the feminine.\n\nPanel 3: Tarrying with indeterminacy in political and legal anthropology | Aaron Burr Hall 209\n\nCo-organizers: Maria José de Abreu, Columbia University and Milad Odabaei, Princeton University\n\nChair and Discussant: Milad Odabaei, Princeton University\n\nPanel Abstract: “This panel addresses epistemological concern with indeterminacy in political and legal anthropology. We direct our attention to the sites of creation, subjection, and transgression that expose historical contingencies and performative enactment of law and the inscription of distinct forms of conduct to individual and social bodies. We invite reflections on indeterminacy both as a feature of legal and sociopolitical worlds, and therefore as an object of anthropological reflection, and as the difficulty of naming and conceptualization that exposes anthropology and liberal modes of reason more generally to political-theological indeterminacies of the contemporary world. In the latter case, we invite methodological reflections on indeterminacy at the limit of existing paradigms, and as the site of the emergence of speculative and experimental methodologies. Scholars may consider texts and contexts where the law seeks to give form to sexuality, kinship, and community, as well as human–non-human, and friend–enemy relations–often all at once–by regulating the relation between the private and the public, (zahir the outward) and batin (the inward), and the intimate and the distant. Case studies will include the state regulation of hijab in Iran, and the association of the unveiled body with both impiety and the West, or of the regulation of public sex under right-wing authoritarianism in Portugal. “Virtue,” “chastity,” “custom,” “tradition,” “nature,” “history,” or even “God” emerge as conceptual categories, practical grammars, or political strategies to secure instances of the nomos against indeterminacy or to exploit indeterminacy internal to the operation of the law, rendering the law inoperative and holding its subjects in abeyance. In such cases, we inquire about the temporality, grammar, and the insight of indeterminate states and their epistemological significance for critique and a speculative anthropology of a world to come.\n\nEmilio Spadola, Colgate University, “Life is a part of death: Islam and the indeterminacies of tradition”\n\nFor several decades, Jacques Derrida’s and Talal Asad’s distinct and distinctive conceptions of politics, law, and religion have deeply influenced anthropologists and other scholars of religion. In the field of Islamic studies, however, scholars’ embrace of Asad’s genealogical framing of Islam as a “discursive tradition,” combined with Derrida’s admitted lack of expertise, has resulted in an elision of the latter’s thought. To reopen discussion, this paper contrasts Derrida’s (implicit) critique of tradition as genealogy in Politics of Friendship (1997) and other works with Asad’s conception of “living tradition” (2015). Reading Derrida on indeterminacy and death as the precondition of friendship alongside a longtime Muslim friend’s guidance on life and death, I consider non-genealogical dimensions of contemporary Muslim politics and law.\n\nHarini Kumar, Princeton University, ““Nation at Repair, Women at Work”: Gender, Protest and Citizenship in South India”\n\nFrom December 2019 to March 2020, India was engulfed in protests against the new Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The CAA is the first time in the post-colonial Indian legal landscape that religion is being used as a criterion for citizenship. The Act provides a path to citizenship for persecuted minorities from neighboring countries but excludes Muslims. Amid countrywide protests emerged a unique political experience spearheaded by Muslim women. This paper focuses on a protest site in the southern Indian city of Chennai to examine the everyday practices of domestic and ritual life that Muslim women brought to such spaces. While there were recognizable signs of civil disobedience such as marches and protest slogans, this paper argues that the seemingly apolitical aspects of religious and social life—prayer, marriage, and domestic rituals—are also expressions of political and moral will. When protesters exclaim that they will not show their papers, it is not just a form of political dissent; they are also alluding to affective ties to place, kinship, and traditions that temporally and spatially exceed the prescriptive nature of the demands of the state to prove one’s citizenship via documents. Although the protests were about a citizenship law, the protesters were in fact pointing to various modes of belonging that cannot be captured by the bureaucratic apparatus of the state. This pa"
