Disagreements between military historians and etymologists about the meaning of D-Day abound. Here are just two explanations:\n\nIn Stephen Ambrose's D-Day, June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II, he writes, \"Time magazine reported on June 12 [1944] that \"as far as the U.S. Army can determine, the first use of D for Day, H for Hour was in Field Order No. 8, of the First Army, A.E.F., issued on Sept. 20, 1918, which read, 'The First Army will attack at H-Hour on D-Day with the object of forcing the evacuation of the St. Mihiel salient.'\" (p. 491)\n\nIn other words, the D in D-Day merely stands for Day. This coded designation was used for the day of any important invasion or military operation. For military planners (and later historians), the days before and after a D-Day were indicated using plus and minus signs: D-4 meant four days before a D-Day, while D+7 meant seven days after a D-Day.\n\nLearn more about D-Day here.\n\nWhy is the Museum located in New Orleans?\n\nNew Orleans is home to the LCVP, or Higgins boat, the landing craft that brought US soldiers to shore in every major amphibious assault of World War II. Andrew Jackson Higgins and the 30,000 Louisiana workers of Higgins Industries designed, built and tested 20,000 Higgins boats in southeastern Louisiana during the war. Dwight Eisenhower once claimed that Higgins was \"the man who won the war for us.\"\n\nLearn more about Higgins Industries and Andrew Jackson Higgins here.\n\nHow is Dr. Stephen Ambrose connected to the Museum?\n\nThe late Dr. Stephen Ambrose was the founder of The National WWII Museum. He spent decades researching and writing about the war, Eisenhower, and D-Day. As he collected more than 2,000 oral histories from D-Day veterans, he realized that the United States had no museum to honor these men and women and the people on the Home Front who made our victory in World War II possible. Ambrose was also the founder of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at The University of New Orleans.\n\nFind out more about Stephen Ambrose and Nick Mueller, the founders of The National WWII Museum, here.\n\nDo you have a database listing all D-Day Veterans?\n\nNo, but we do have some helpful tips on finding information about veterans.\n\nHow many World War II veterans are alive today?\n\nEvery day, memories of World War II—its sights and sounds, its terrors and triumphs—disappear. Yielding to the inalterable process of aging, the men and women who fought and won the great conflict are now in their late 80s and 90s. They are dying quickly—according to US Department of Veterans Affairs statistics, we are losing 348 veterans per day and only 496,777 of the 16 million Americans who served in World War II were alive in 2018.\n\nThis urgency guides the Museum in everything we do. Collecting the oral history of a veteran, donating an artifact, or contributing to the Museum are only a few of the ways you can help us to preserve the legacy of the Greatest Generation.\n\nView more statistics and download full report.\n\nI have something from the war in my attic. Do you want it for the Museum?\n\nAre the \"Higgins Boats\" in the Museum from World War II?\n\nLess than 10 original LCVPs or “Higgins Boats” are known to exist today. The Museum’s LCVP was built by volunteers, many of whom were Higgins employees, from the original plans and contains some original parts like the ramp and the engine.\n\nOur LCP(L) is an original Higgins built craft. It was restored to original condition by our volunteers, many of whom also helped build the LCVP.\n\nPT-305 is also an original Higgins built PT boat. It is the world's only fully restored, operational, combat veteran PT boat.\n\nIs the Museum part of the federal government?\n\nNo, The National WWII Museum is a private non-profit institution. We have received federal, state, and private funds for initial construction and the ongoing Road to Victory Expansion.\n\nI want to tour Normandy. What should I go see?\n\nPlease look into our D-Day Tours or find out more about other World War II travel packages.\n\nWith three hundred seventy-five miles of beaches, cliffs, farming villages and ports, Normandy is a contrasting landscape of ancient fortresses and castles, ruined monasteries, and rolling farmland replete with memories of World War II and scarred with evidence of the Allied D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944. While there are many faces of Normandy, here are some basic suggestions for those travelers wishing to visit D-Day-related sites\n\nTop Sites (from east to west):\n\nPegasus Bridge. Located on the Caen Canal, this key bridge was captured by British airborne troops in the early morning hours of D-Day, helping to secure the eastern flank of the invasion. Although the original bridge was taken down in 1994, a museum marks the site of this crucial coup de main operation.\n\n“The Memorial and Museum of Peace.” Caen’s Battle of Normandy Museum offers guided tours of the landing beaches (British and American) along with a pass to the memorial. Caen is the site of the British breakout through German lines.\n\nWWII Museum at Bayeux. While this town’s chief attraction is its 11th century tapestry honoring William the Conqueror’s victory at Hastings in 1066, the Musée Mémorial de la Bataille de Normandie 1944 paints a vivid picture of the Allied invasion and campaign in Normandy.\n\nArromanches. See the remnants of Mulberry B, one of two huge artificial harbors the Allies towed to Normandy from England. The Museum here has a great model, showing how the structure worked.\n\nOmaha Beach. One of two beaches attacked by American forces on D-Day (the other is Utah Beach). Located near the town of St. Laurent, Omaha Beach was the bloodiest of the D-Day beaches. You can still see remnants of one of the Mulberries, or artificial harbors, the Allies built to support the invasion.\n\nAmerican Military Cemetery at St. Laurent. Stretching across the bluff overlooking Omaha Beach, the rows of white marble crosses and stars commemorate the men who died fighting for the Allied victory in Normandy. A must see.\n\nPointe-du-Hoc. The elite US Rangers scaled this 40-meter high cliff between Omaha and Utah beaches to neutralize a dangerous German gun battery. Check out the cliffs, the ruins of German bunkers, the bomb craters, and see if they were successful.\n\nSt.-Lô. In the town where the Americans finally broke through the German lines, the Holy Cross Church is home to a memorial to Maj. Thomas Howie, who had vowed to be the first American in St.-Lô. He was killed shortly before his troops took the city.\n\nUtah Beach. The area around Utah Beach contains monuments, abandoned tanks, and pillboxes— reminders of D-Day. The Musée du Débarquement, near La Madeleine, is located in a German bunker, and offers striking accounts of the battle for Normandy.\n\nSte-Mère-Eglise. In this town taken by the US Airborne on D-Day, the Musée des Troupes Aéroportées includes photos, a glider, and parachutes commemorating the morning of June 6, 1944 when American paratroopers dropped over the town to secure the western flank of the invasion.\n\nRecommended Travel Books:\n\nThe Visitor's Guide to Normandy Landing Beaches by Holt, Tonie and Valmai\n\nAAA Essential Normandy: All You Need to Know by Nia Williams\n\nInsight Compact Guide: Normandy by Manfred Braunger\n\nA Traveler's Guide to D-Day and the Battle for Normandy by Carl Shilleto and Mike Tolhurst\n\nVisitor Code of Conduct\n\nTo ensure a positive guest experience, we ask all guests to adhere to the following rules.
