        "text": "Week 5 Graffiti Lecture 1 The “art” of graffito is, of course, ubiquitous and timeless and has been found on many varied surfaces from Neolithic caves to the telephone booth and subway walls of today. In its less formal phases it has been called doodling. penn/sites/expedition/tikal-graffiti/ The term Graffiti comes from the ancient Greek verb “graphein” — to write and represent scratches, drawings, scribbles and paintings on different hard surfaces such as rocks, stones, or building walls. Today, we have ended up talking about modern graffiti art, but although its beginnings can be traced to the late 1960s in the United States, the history of graffiti appears to go much further back in time— beyond even ancient times.\n\nThere are Egyptologists who specialize in studying ancient graffiti, scrutinizing every piece of information they can get from them. And this is not a shoot in the dark because, in ancient Egypt, graffiti have been left in many and various places. Some were even found in spots they haven’t been quite expected — on ceremonial palaces or royal buildings, for instance.\n\nWander the ancient Greek and Roman ruins of Ephesus, Turkey and you'll find this astonishing advertisement for a Roman brothel etched into the marble walkway. Dated to the 1st Century A., it's considered the oldest advertisement in history, for the oldest profession in the world! (3) So what does this ancient bordello advert mean? The part that you'll probably notice first is the foot leading the way, and, above that, a cross believed to represent an intersection. The size of the foot is said to mean that a certain age was required to enter (i. if your foot was smaller, you were too young) and the use of a left foot indicates that the brothel was on the left at the cross- roads ahead. The depiction of a woman tells us what one can find there and the hole at the upper left (the location of the brothel) with the coin-filled purse, tells us that if you had enough money to fill the cavity, you could buy her affection. The box underneath the woman symbolizes the library that was opposite the brothel. Meaning, that if you had no money, there was always the library! Essentially, it's an ancient version of “No money, no honey!” Archeologists have revealed, the streets of Pompeii were full of drawings and inscriptions (around 11, 000 in a town of 11, 000 citizens) and what is really surprising — they existed not only on inns, bars, public baths and basilicas but also on the walls of the wealthy private houses. Among them, there were political appeals, declarations of love, caricatures, boasts, insults, curses, and even riddles and word squares. There were, of course, other examples of graffiti in the ancient world. The Maya site of Tikal in Guatemala contained examples of ancient Maya graffiti. Viking graffiti survived in Rome and at Newgrange Mound in Ireland. In Sri Lanka, at the fifth-century citadel of Sigiriya (pronounced ‘Si-gih-ree-yah.’, there were left over one thousand and eight hundred graffiti on the Mirro Wall. The modern time graffiti include the names of the Napoleon’s soldiers carved on different\n\nmonuments during his campaign in Egypt in the 1790s. Some graffiti date from the period of the World Wars. The widespread phrase “ Kilroy was here” accompanied by the characteristic image of a bald man peeping out of a wall dates from the time of the World War II. Probably, it was initially drawn by an American soldier and later entered the American popular culture. medium/@ancientworldalive/history-of-graffiti-2befed3786a While Graffiti iconography has been around since Egyptian times, it was not until World War II, that one name became identified with Graffiti. That name was “KILROY”. “KILROY” worked in a bomb plant in Detroit where, after checking a bomb he would scrawl in white chalk “KILROY WAS HERE\", on its side. These bombs found their way throughout war torn Europe and “KILROY” became a celebrity. As American forces took back towns from the Germans, a soldier would invariably write “KILROY WAS HERE\" on whatever wall was left standing. After the war, the name “KILROY” became synonymous with Graffiti, finding its way on countless student's notebook covers. Also made it’s way into modern culture: seriouslywhatisgoodguys.blogspot/2011/09/1942-kilroy.html (9) (10) 1950's - After the death of Charlie \"BIRD\" Parker, the great jazz musician, the slogan \"BIRD LIVES\" was scrawled throughout jazz clubs across the country, particularly New York; but it was short lived, and certainly didn't have the impact that “KILROY” had. FRUSTRATED BY THE lack of progress on social and political issues and reacting to the turmoil that had spread across the land, a number of groups began to advocate radical measures to achieve their goals of justice and equality. Four of the most prominent and successful of these organizations were the Black Panther Party, the Students for a Democratic Society, the Weather Underground Organization, and the Youth International Party, or the Yippies. The Black Panther Party was founded in 1966 in Oakland, California, by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton. They demanded the right to control the schools, medical centers, welfare programs, and police system in poor black areas, exemption from military service and the right to bear arms for self-protection. They organized chapters throughout the country, initiating 'liberation' schools, breakfast programs for children, and medical clinics in poor areas. The Black Panthers had many confrontations with the police that led to shootings and arrests.\n\nThe SDS was founded in Chicago in 1962 and was active throughout the sixties on college campuses across the land. In the mid-sixties, they were active mainly in civil rights causes, but later they became more concerned with ending the United States' involvement in Vietnam. The SDS often coordinated activities with the Black Panthers and espoused radical, though at first, Marxist, means of protest. A splinter group known as the Weathermen believed in violent revolution and acts of terrorism to achieve their goals. This group was implicated in a number of bombings at colleges and federal institutions.\n\nThe Youth International Party, or the Yippies , was the brain child of sixties activists Abbie\n\nMCs/rappers, but they also perform turntable scratching to create percussive sounds , and b- boying (breakdancing).\n\nRock Steady Crew video Crazy legs 1982 vs storm (battle squad) 16 years old\n\nGraffiti, like the other three elements, is an artform, a means of cultural expression. Like the other forms of hip hop, it also expresses resistance. Graffiti challenges, for example mainstream notions of what counts as art, what counts as public space, and what counts a property, just as emceeing/DJing challenges what counts as music, and bboying challenges what counts as dance. (26/27) Graffiti, unlike the other forms of hip hop, is more easily misunderstood because it is often done illegally and the artists are often secretive about their real identities. As such, it has not received the kind of positive mainstream recognition afforded to rappers, DJ's, and dancers. Some professionals in the art world have embraced graffiti, but that doesn't mean that the public at large understands and appreciates what graffiti is all about.\n\nBirth and Evolution Graffiti, if we define it as any type of writing on the wall, goes back to ancient Rome, and if drawn images count, then we could point to the first graf artists. But the style of urban graffiti that most people have seen and know about, the kind that uses spray cans, came from New York City in the late 1960s, and was born on the subway trains. Taki 183 , who lived on 183rd street in Washington Heights, worked as a messenger who traveled all throughout the city. While he did so, he would use a marker and write his name wherever he went, at subway stations and also the insides and outsides of subway cars. Eventually, he became known all throughout the city as this mysterious figure. In 1971, he was interviewed for an article by the New York Times. Kids all over New York, realizing the fame and notoriety that could be gained from \"tagging\" their names on subway cars (that traveled all over the city, naturally) began to emulate Taki 183. The goal was to \"get up\" (using the slang of the day), to have one's name in as many places as possible, and as kids competed against each other to get famous, the amount of graffiti on trains exploded.\n\nThe Beginning: (28) \"CORNBREAD\" and his partner \"KOOL EARL\" two Philadelphia writers, helped define the role of the modern day Graffiti writer; a major part of that role was fame. Darryl McCray , got his name “ Cornbread ” from an ornery cook at a youth detention center during one of his early stays. McCray kept pestering the cook with demands for cornbread instead of the stale white bread being served. He didn’t get the cornbread, but he got the name. And the name stuck — not just to McCray, but to walls all over the city when he started tagging in the late 1960s. He was just a teenager then, his parents gone, hen the grandmother who raised him died. Cornbread remembers at one point being a young man writing on walls and crying. For \"CORNBREAD\",\n\nwhat began as a way to get attention from a girl he liked with a few tags, soon turned into a full time mission, getting up so much that he gave himself a “crown” ( an image that continue to be repeated over the next decades until today). \"CORNBREAD'S\" exploits were chronicled by the black press and the two, soon fed off each other. At times journalists would mention an idea that would strike \"CORNBREAD\". An idea, for example, that it would be amazing if somebody tagged the Jackson Five jet as it landed in Philly. As a result, \"CORNBREAD\" would do it, and the press would publish it. By the late 60's a sub- culture had started in Philadelphia, it had its own distinct style: long letters with platforms on the bottom. “When I realized all I had to do was write my name on bizarre things, I became a glutton for publicity.. the media was more than glad to accommodate me,” he remembers. He cannily kept upping the ante — tagging police cars, and in one of his favorite stories, an elephant.\n\n“I was on the bus one day, reading the newspaper and it said ‘Cornbread is shot to death.’ I knew I had to do something amazingly bizarre to let people know I wasn’t dead. I started writing ‘the real Cornbread is not dead,’ but people thought it was an imposter. So I go to the zoo. It’s a big tourist attraction. I watch the zookeeper shower the elephant with a hose, watch him tug on his flappy ears, and pat his side. The elephant is tame. I saw the zookeeper was not in danger. It seemed to work. At least the police, who arrested him, knew he was alive. Pre-Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, McCray’s tagging got him instant notoriety. A little later, when his style came to New York it was dubbed \"Broadway elegant\". The one thing missing from the Philadelphia movement was the prominence of the subway. \"CORNBREAD\" stopped writing in 1972.” https:/ nstrumnt inquirer.com/philly/news/The_legend_of_Cornbread - Sign of youth, possibly lack of parental guidance, lack of funds (31) subwayoutlaws/history/history.htm (34) Graffiti really took off South Bronx in the 70’s In the 1970s, fires ravaged much of the Bronx: seven census tracts lost 97 percent of their buildings and 44 tracts lost more than 50 percent. Many people still believe that those fires were the result of arson—landlords burning their own buildings for profit, or even residents starting the fires. It was a community of major urban devastation. Was the South Bronx bad? Yeah, it's bad. Along with northern Brooklyn, the south Bronx is the worst area of NYC, when you take crime and poverty rate into account. It used to be much worse, and has gotten a lot better, but you can say that about every single neighborhood in NYC. Jun 8, 2012. city-data/forum/new-york-city/1599313-south-bronx-bad.html df\n\n(35) Around 1970-71 the center of graffiti culture shifted from Philadelphia to New York City\n\nLet’s hear from a few primary source voices\n\nSharp TOPCAT 126 came from Philadelphia in the late sixties, maybe ’68, and he started tagging the streets. [Tagging is writing your name.] And he hooked up with Julio 204 and TAKI 183, and they grabbed the torch.\n\nC.A. 87\n\nIn the late sixties, I saw the name TAKI 183 in little letters everywhere, and JOE 182 and Julio 204. One day I was playing stickball on 182nd Street and JOE 182 came out. He was one of the hottest graffiti writers then. He said, “Look what came out in the papers!” There was a cartoon of a guy catching someone writing graffiti, and saying, “Are you JOE 182?” And the writer said, “No, I’m his ghost.” Because nobody could catch them. They were just like these mysterious figures.\n\nMICO I began in different neighborhoods. But we all had one thing in common: We wanted to be famous. I started writing in East Flatbush in 1970. Then slowly I met people from the four other boroughs. Everybody went to the writers’ bench at 149th Street and Grand Concourse in the Bronx. There was one for Brooklyn writers on Atlantic Avenue. In Washington Heights, it was on 188th Street and Audubon Avenue. We would hang out, see our work, and everyone could get autographs. C.A. 87 was from Washington Heights. TRACY 168 was in the first generation. COCO 144 used to live on 144th Street and Broadway, which is what the number 144 meant.\n\nLEE I met so many characters on the 149 bench. It was like a speakeasy, everyone came and traded stories.\n\nTRACY 168 I grew up in the Bronx. Me and my friend FJC4 were dropping off some legal papers in Queens —his father was a lawyer—and we just took a marker out. We never thought we’d see the tag again, but on the way back, we caught the same train and it already had some other writing next to it. It was like a communication. At the time, New York was all dark. We had the Vietnam vets coming back, all pumped up. We had the war protesters. And we had the street gangs.\n\nC.A. 87 I was in the Savage Nomads. You had the Saints at 137th Street and Broadway, and in the 170s you had the Young Galaxies. But if I was C.A. 87 and the guys from other neighborhoods saw my name, instead of trying to beat me up they would ask for autographs.\n\nJeff Chang, author of Can’t Stop Won’t Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation\n\nThere were graffiti writers in many gangs, especially the larger ones like the Black Spades, the Savage Skulls, and the Ghetto Brothers. The writers would mark the gangs’ clubhouses and often their turf. At the same time, you had graffiti crews that moved separately from the gangs and could slip in between their territorial restrictions. Eventually, as the gang structures died off, the graffiti writers could be seen as the heralds of a new era.\n\nMICO We didn’t call it graffiti in the early seventies. We would say, “Let’s go writing tonight.” Graffiti is a term that the New York Times coined, and it denigrates the art because it was invented by youth of color. Had it been invented by the children of the rich or the influential, it would have been branded avant-garde Pop Art. Ironically enough, my full-time job today is in the New York City court system. And we get graffiti cases all the time. nymag/guides/summer/17406/index1.html\n\nSo here is a glossary of the graffiti terms.

Featuring artists ranging from LADY PINK to John Fekner, Graffiti Art Success for America opened up new possibilities for graffiti in a gallery setting. While it was not the first art space to exhibit graffiti — the United Graffiti Artists collective held a show at the Razor Gallery in 1973 — Fashion Moda was one of the first to allow the writers to paint directly on the walls and facade of the gallery.\n\n(45) Lady Pink we will discuss in a few minutes.\n\n(46) John Fekner In the 70s, John Fekner was ‘anonymously known’ for over three hundred environmental/conceptual works consisting of dates, words, and symbols spray painted throughout the five boroughs of New York. (47) The “Warning Signs” project focused on pointing out hazardous conditions that dominated New York City and its environs in the 1970s. In the spring of 1977, Fekner created word-signs using hand cut cardboard stencils and spray paint. He began a relentless crusade concerned with social and environmental issues. Starting in the industrial streets of Queens and the East River bridges, and later on to the South Bronx in 1980, his messages were seen in areas that were desperately in need of construction, demolition or reconstruction. By labeling structures and emphasizing problems, the objective was to call attention to the accumulated squalor by urging city officials, agencies and local communities to be more responsible and take action. (48)With a word or two (''Decay'', for instance, or ''Broken Promises''), Fekner brought an element of street theater into disaster areas. With a single stenciled phrase (''Wheels Over Indian Trails,'' for instance) he mingled present with past on the side of the Pulaski Bridge near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. What in other hands might have been vandalism had a salutary effect. People in desolate parts of the city saw more, felt more, thought more and came out of their apathy. Trivia: While campaigning for president in 1980, Ronald Reagon visited a desolate stretch of the borough to point that Carter hadn’t done anything for the community since his 1977 trip.\n\n“... I always felt what we were doing was so much more than it was in that specific moment... graffiti could be legitimate” -CRASH (50) CRASH (b. John Matos, 1961, Bronx, New York) took an interest in unconventional artistic expression at an early age. At just 13 years old, he began following the older teens from his neighborhood to the train yards and began bombing. Designated as \"CRASH\" after he accidentally crashed the computer in his school, his name started appearing on trains circulating all throughout New York City. By 1980, the display of his work transitioned from train yard backdrops to canvases on gallery walls. CRASH transformed the graffiti movement by curating the groundbreaking \"Graffiti Art Success for America\" at Fashion MODA. CRASH’s career took\n\noff and he saw instant international popularity. His work has been part of numerous museum and gallery exhibitions around the world, including shows such as \"Graffiti\" at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and \"Art in the Streets\" at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Regarded as a pioneer of graffiti art, CRASH’s work combines elements of both traditional fine art and underground urban art creating a dialogue concerning the very nature of art itself. With apparent Pop-Art influences showcased amongst a subcultural street art foundation, CRASH allows viewers to explore the impartial quality that art has to offer, reminding us that great art can be found everywhere, whether it be on the side of a train, encompassing the surface of a building, or displayed on the walls of an art gallery. - Crash’s daughter - Changed trajectory of lives - Success has changed neighborhood and families - Ferrari video - Many graffiti artist have gone on into graphic design, fashion, building sets, etc. - Some of Crash’s other works: Where’s Eric!

Do you think the presence of women in the scene has increased and why do you think so? Do you think you’ve influenced the growth of women in graffiti?\n\nLP: As the times have changed and feminism has caught up with society, a lot of females are into street art and graffiti because they’re just being made stronger, tougher, sturdier, and they’re not all feminine and dainty and delicate and need to be protected by some man. Girls are braver and they are just as foolish and reckless as the next guy and they’re out their showing their thing. And I think it’s a cross-section of our society- you see women in sports, women in the military, women invading every aspect of our world and the same thing with graffiti- they can paint large, they can express themselves just as boldly as any guy and there’s nothing holding them back. I’d like to think I set an example earlier on that no matter what size you are or gender or anything, it just takes a lot of dedication and a lot of courage and a lot of heart to get this done, and a lot of women have followed suit. I’m certainly not the very first one.\n\n(65/66)Susan: One of the best known and well-loved female writers is Lady Pink. Here are peeps of Reminisce, Omega, and one by Utah.\n\nSaGe: Hells yeah.

We got into this thing with colors. First it was two colors, then three colors, then four. What makes me a powerful artist, \" he states, \" is that my paintings are alive, strong and very bright. The color combos make it. Balance: each color as strong as it is enhances the color beside it, going back and forth. Giving style and balance and movement, that is what makes a good artist.\" \"After the colors,\" TRACY 168 continues, \"the challenge became who could do the biggest piece, the wildest. Then it was top-to-bottom, whole car, whole train. We worked on clouds and flames. We got into lettering. Everybody was trying to develop their own technique. When I would go into a yard (train), the first thing I would do is look around and see who was good.\n\nThat would be my objective. To burn the best writer in the yard, and I wouldn't leave until I did something better than him.\"\n\nBecause of these types of beginnings, most street graffiti was based on the macho culture of competition. How long will you take to do a car before you get caught? How big can you write your name? It was fueled by a rage against a society which didn't care about its kids. It was a form of communication and a way to gain recognition outside of community. It was perceived as the only way to escape the ghetto, and to become known and recognized in faraway places, like Brooklyn.

That line was Fab’s calling card and introduction to the world of pop culture. He initially exploded on the scene in the late 70’s as one of the first Graffiti artist to exhibit his paintings internationally. Along with close friends and contemporaries, Futura 2000, Keith Haring, Jean Michele Basquiat, Lee Quinones and others, Fab was key in getting the art world to realize New York graffiti was spawning an art movement that would eventually pulsate globally until today, and give birth to street art. Like many creative figures from the New York downtown scene in the 80’s Fab would explore other modes of creative expression. At the seminal Times Square Art show that his work was featured in he would link up with budding filmmaker Charlie Ahearn and come up with the idea that eventually became the cult classic and first film on Hip-hop culture, “Wild Style”, which he also produced, stars in and composed all the original music for. - reporter - Fantastic Five - South bronx very dangerous place - All about who you knew After numerous solo exhibits and group shows in the late eighties Fab wanted to reach a broader audience so he decided to expand on his experiences making the film Wild Style and direct music videos. His first assignment was the song “My Philosophy” for Hip-Hop legend KRS- ONE. Fab would go on to direct numerous videos and commercials for artist like, Queen Latifah, Nas, Snoop Doggy Dog and companies like Pepsi. But shortly after settling in behind the camera in the late 80’S, MTV, feeling the cultural pressure asked him to host a program called, YO! MTV Raps, which immediately becomes the highest rated show on the channel and blasts Hip Hop culture into the living rooms of mainstream America and millions on several continents and countries around the world.\n\nas much as they were drawings, performances. It was where I learned how to draw in public. You draw in front of people. For me it was a whole sort of philosophical and sociological experiment. When I drew, I drew in the daytime which meant there were always people watching. There were always confrontations, whether it was with people that were interested in looking at it, or people that wanted to tell you you shouldn’t be drawing there...” “I was learning, watching people’s reactions and interactions with the drawings and with me and looking at it as a phenomenon. Having this incredible feedback from people, which is one of the main things that kept me going so long, was the participation of the people that were watching me and the kinds of comments and questions and observations that were coming from every range of person you could imagine, from little kids to old ladies to art historians.” haring/!/about-haring/to-new-york#.XqnneGhKjZQ - Opportunity: blank advertising poster - Finishes in a minute or two - As many as 30 a day - All different but the same - Don’t have to know anything about art to understand it - Could be arrested - More important to make a lot of different things and keep coming up with different things that were never made before than doing one thing well, they come up fast but its a fast moving world\n\nBack to Zephyr...\n\nOver a two month period in the arly spring of 1980, man named Sam Estes provided studio workspace to popular graffiti artist\n\nEquipped with all the necessary tools to bring their art from the street to the canvas\n\nCanvas was a relatively new medium for the graffiti artsits so the transition would be complex\n\nBut the results were astounding, artists offered new avenue to augment skills and dvelp new ideas\n\nHistorical and social significance of these canvases is rich and each posseses unhindered creativity\n\n“Over a two month period in early spring 1980, a man named Sam Esses provided a studio workspace in Manhattan to a number of popular subway graffiti artists. In the studio space these graffiti artists were equipped with all necessary tools to bring their art from street to canvas. Provided in the studio were: Canvases, spray paint, markers, a safe environment to paint in and a vibrant group of passionate artists to share and inspire art. Canvas was a relatively new medium for graffiti at this time, and the transition from painting on subways to painting on canvas would be complex. But the results of the Graffiti 1980 Workshop were astounding. Not only were dozens of brilliant canvases produced, but these artists were offered a new avenue to reflect on,\n\naugment, and develop their skills. The historical and social significance of these canvases is rich and each inherently possess unhindered creativity, personal expression and substantial cultural relativity. The Graffiti 1980 collection opens an unadulterated window into the history of the graffiti art movement. Some of the artists who participated in the project have forged professional art careers and some have not. Some of the artists have given up graffiti while others have never quit. And some have since passed away. But through these canvases each spirit is alive and the legacy of these artists illuminates new paths for new artists with love for graffiti.”\n\nAt first we relied on our closest graffiti associates to paint there, so the earliest canvases were done by ALI, STAN 153, NOC 167, SAL 161, JEAN 13, TRACY 168, MACKIE, QUIK, RASTA ,BIL-ROCK and REVOLT. The studio atmosphere was charged and full of creative excitement and anticipation. Whenever someone was painting a canvas there was always a roomful of other graffitists watching intently and taking in every deft move of their spray cans— a performance art ethos in full effect. Fortunately things remained pretty calm most of the time and we only had a few, um, “incidents”. Given the amount of pre-existing rivalries at the time, it was nothing short of a miracle that no serious violence occurred. Word of the studio reached outward resulting in the eventual arrivals of heavy hitters SEEN, KEL 139, MARE, SHY 147, COS 207, T-KID 170, DURO and DONDI. The canvases that were created in just two short months tell a story of natural, organic, self-taught artistry. Painted exclusively with enamel spray cans of the era, and an occasional use of black magic markers, the paintings rendered are nothing short of majestic. zephyrgraffiti/2019/02/the-graffiti-1980-studio/ - Started in 1973/ - 1st ones to stand on ledge, no one else noticed it was wide enough to stand on - Hall of fame - Relationship w graffiti is diff for everyone - Even between partners - There is no real history of graffiti, everyone has their own history - Tens of thousands of graffiti - Every time is a competition, war within self and other painters and law enforcement - Homages to psychedelic chemical endeavors - 1970s hippies - Pastime, has to remain fun and playful, when it loses the fun, “I’m out”\n\nLEE Born in Ponce, Puerto Rico in 1960, Quinones was raised in New York’s Lower East Side. Lee Quinones is considered the single most influential artist to emerge from the New York City subway art movement. He is a celebrated figure in both the contemporary art world and in popular culture circles, faithfully producing work that is ripe with provocative socio-political content and intricate composition. Lee’s paintings are housed in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of Art, the Museum of the City New York, the Groninger Museum\n\nof some of its protagonists and greatest innovators. FUTURA 2000 is undoubtedly one of those. Over the course of his career, he transitioned from making New York-based subway graffiti in the early 1970s, to exhibiting at Fun Gallery in the 1980s alongside major artists such as Jean- Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Kenny Scharf. McGurr’s major contribution to graffiti art was his use of abstraction, adopting a style of painting characterized by its blending of text and imagery. He went on to collaborate with the punk band The Clash, designing their album art and performing live graffiti during their concerts. Today, McGurr’s work can be found in the collections of the Museo de Arte Moderna di Bologna, the Musée de Vire in France, and the Museum of the City of New York. No longer working in graffiti, McGurr lives and works as a graphic designer in Brooklyn, NY. - Off-white, LV - Leonard McGurr - From NYC - Joined the navy - Technology experienced there helped to shape him to become who he is - Fred - Project dragon blue - Photoshop -\n\nSharp: Aaron Goodstone/ Sharp has been one of the first New York City subway graffiti artists. He was born Aaron Goodstone in 1966, in New York, United States. Nowadays, Sharp works in acrylic, mixed-media, and spray paint on canvas. His style has been described as Techno Abstract Symbolism. - peer pressure - Incognito because not controversial In his youth, Sharp served an apprenticeship on the 6 line of the IRT where he challenged the industrial power of 600 miles of steel and machinery running like a blood vessel through the city, blasting through the tunnels and thundering along the “el” over miles of rubble where apartment buildings once stood. Sharp with his partner Delta wrested the Pelham Bay Express from the hegemonic grip of Madseen UA. They proclaimed, \"we are here, we will not be ignored. They were on hand to be major players in the last years of significant aerosol painting on the legendary trains of new york. Those years saw the end of the old culture of innocent creation and achievement that brightened the destroyed city, turning deferred-maintenance wrecks into brilliant canvases that put a new face on the concept of public ownership. The story is one of owning nothing yet owning it all, infusing the faceless grid with your own identity, your own spirit, finding freedom that transcends captivity, giving form and color as medicine for a community in pain. Sharp’s paintings today carry all this heritage in their DNA. The elegant, proliferating wild-style lettering is in dynamic tension with the grid and calls the background to life; a visual metaphor in\n\nwhich the energy of the soul finds expression in the circumstances of the given life. The futurists glorified and emulated modernism and industrial power and speed. The graffiti writers took hold of this powerful infrastructure and transformed it, restoring the spirit of Ogun, the yoruba divinity of iron, to the naked trains. The rhythm of writing is exuberant motion and crackling energy. The message is within the form itself which could only have evolved on a moving object. Sharp today paints not far from his roots as a youth on the streets, where you must invent yourself through cultural expression to achieve Ghetto Celebrity Status.\n\nKool Koor Beginning his career in 1979, writing Graffiti on the subway trains and throughout the urban landscape of New York City, Kool Koor (American, b) grew up surrounded by such artists as A-One and Toxic (American, b), who lived in the same neighborhood in the South Bronx. He’s known for his space-age-inspired works, which range from surreal scenes to intricate works of abstraction. Attending the Art and Design School in Midtown (manhattan) meant Kool Koor had plenty of access to the subway on his commute to and from school, allowing him to gain notoriety through collaborative and individual works on the trains.

His whole opus is a product of various cultural and urban influences and is inseparable from the context of the deranged city of New York back in the days. The way Toxic performed lettering, chose locations and exchanged information and advice within his community, made his approach progressive and revolutionary. With a lot of patience and courage, Toxic was focused on constant learning and therefore artistic upgrade. - Worked closely with Koor and A-One - Toxic is an international artist from South Bronx, now moves between Tsucany, Paris,"
