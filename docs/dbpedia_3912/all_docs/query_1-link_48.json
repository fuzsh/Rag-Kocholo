        "text": "The first historians we know of wrote mainly about war and military action. For example, the poems of Homer recounted the Trojan wars. Herodotus, who lived in the 5th century BCE and who is considered the father of history, gave an account of the Persian wars. A few centuries later, Thucydides related the major events of the Peloponnesian wars. In Asia, Chinese historians around the same time (5th to 3rd century BCE) wrote of the Warring States. Sun Tzu, who wrote The Art of War, is one of the best known authors of this era. Essentially, war and its history not only go back a long way but have also had a place in all cultures. Historians in the Arab world recorded the history of the Hijira and the spread of Islam in the 7th century CE, although with limited attention to the military aspect. In sub-Saharan Africa, the history of the Fulani Jihads of the 17th and 18th centuries is still told today through the oral history of the griots.\n\nJust like the traumas and social, political, economic and cultural upheavals that war triggers, the history of war is universal. However, how historians write about war has changed a great deal over time.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, history became an academic discipline subject to the scientific method. Since that time, the history of war and of the military has gone through different phases. After enjoying significant popularity among historians of the 19th century, war history saw a decline and loss of legitimacy in the 1930s due not only to its outdated method of only describing battles, strategies and the “great” generals, but also the most often then not nationalistic, racist, and undeniably Eurocentric nature of these writings.\n\nA subsequent series of developments has continued to impact and transform this school. For example, the 1980s saw the introduction of cultural analyses of war to understand how culture influences conflict and how conflict in turn influences society and its culture. The advent of academic gender analysis and theory also led to a rethinking of military history. Military masculinity and the place of women in conflict became the focus of many studies. The examination of war violence in all its forms, from combat to (mass) sexual violence, massacres and genocide, also form part of this movement. While some historians analyze the experiences of victims, others seek to understand the actions of the perpetrators. Today, war is even analyzed from the standpoint of its antithesis: peace!\n\nThe history of war and the military has undergone incredible changes in the past 50 years. As armed conflicts are a key part of the human experience, what has posed a problem for historians is not the history of war itself but rather how it was written, who wrote it, and for whom. The renewed relevance of war history has therefore stemmed from the introduction and use of methods, subjects and problems borrowed from other historical approaches.\n\nCover photo: A representation of the Peloponnesian War on an ancient vase (source: Futura).\n\nArticle written by Thomas Vennes, PhD candidate in history at Sherbrooke University, for Je Me Souviens.
