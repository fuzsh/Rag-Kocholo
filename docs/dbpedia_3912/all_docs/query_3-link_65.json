        "text": "By Dramaturgical Publications Fellow Shannon Stockwell\n\nOutside a closed\n\nAmerican Red Cross\n\nin London, 1946,\n\nMr. Chad asks,\n\n\"Wot, no Yanks?\"\n\nIn Underneath the Lintel, playwright Glen Berger emphasizes the singularly human need inside all of us to leave a mark on the world, something that will endure long after our inevitable deaths. One of the ways in which he discusses this need is through graffiti—the unsanctioned, uncensored defacement of public property—and few examples of graffiti have ever reached quite such a memetic status as a little man called Kilroy.\n\nKilroy is a simple cartoon drawing, a man seen peeking over what appears to be a wall with the words \"Kilroy was here\" next to it. He seems to have originated and became popular during World War II, appearing in unusual places, including the top of the Statue of Liberty. A famous tale claims that in July 1945, during the Potsdam Conference to discuss the end of World War II, Stalin had the use of an exclusive bathroom to which only two other people had access. It is said that Stalin exited the bathroom and immediately asked one of his aides, \"Who is Kilroy?\"\n\nAn ad from 1946 sells Kilroy\n\nclips you couldattach to your\n\nclothing in The Billboard\n\nKilroy's omnipresence made him prominent in public consciousness during the 1940s, to the point where he is immortalized on the World War II Monument in Washington, D.C., purposely chiseled into the stone by the monuments creators. You could even purchase little clips of him to peek over your shirt pockets. Despite being such an icon of the 1940s, the true origins of \"Kilroy was here\" prove difficult to track down with any certainty.\n\nKilroy is immortalized on the\n\nNational World War II Memorial\n\nin Washington, D.C.\n\nIt turns out that the phrase \"Kilroy was here\" and the drawing of the little man peeking over a wall originated in different places. In regards to the phrase, the most accepted origin was explained in 1946, when the American Transit Association hosted a contest to find out who Kilroy was. Many men came forward, but only James J. Kilroy (1902–62) of Quincy, Massachusetts, had evidence linking him to the meme. He was a welding inspector at the Bethlehem Steel shipyard during World War II who wrote \"Kilroy was here\" to mark the completion of his inspections; the ships then went out unpainted, so soldiers often saw the unexplained phrase during their deployments. To some it was a comfort, a lucky talisman that meant they would return home safely. For putting the mystery to rest, James Kilroy was awarded a 37-year-old defunct streetcar; he used it to house six of his nine children.\n\nSome, however, reported that the first appearance of the phrase was much earlier than James Kilroy claimed. It was apparently found in a vault in Fort Knox that was locked in 1937 and remained unopened until the '70s.\n\nMr. Chad makes an\n\nappearance in veteran\n\nRon Goldstein's\n\nscrapbook from World War II,\n\ndrawn in 1946.\n\nThe \"Kilroy\" illustration began as the English cartoon Mr. Chad, who often found himself attached to \"WOT! No____?\" lines (e.g., \"WOT! No Petrol?\"); it was a humorous way of bringing attention to serious shortages and rationing during World War II. The exact origins of Mr. Chad are unclear, but many suggest that the drawing is linked to a diagram representing an electric circuit. Some also claim that it was created by a British cartoonist George Edward Chatterton. Wherever it came from, it began circulating in the early 1940s. Though no one can say exactly how, Kilroy and Mr. Chad teamed up sometime during World War II, and the result was a plucky and ambitious little cartoon that traveled the world and is still recognizable to many today.\n\nClick here to buy tickets and learn more about Underneath the Lintel.\n\n“To Be or Not to Be”: The Iconic Speech’s Origins, Interpretations, and Impact\n\nBy A.C.T. Publications Staff The opening line of Hamlet ’s “To be or not to be” soliloquy is theater’s most iconic, most referenced quote. What’s less known is the famous speech’s history, with Hamlet ’s earliest publications offering varying versions of its language. Also questioned is its meaning—is Hamlet contemplating suicide or is he weighing the consequences of murder? Though definitive answers are unlikely to arise, the questions “To be or not to be” asks have kept audiences, scholars, and actors engaged for centuries. Hamlet ’ s \"To be or not to be\" speech as it appears in the three original editions of the play. Photo by Georgelazenby. Courtesy Wikimedia Commons. The first edition, or First Quarto (Q1), of Hamlet was published in 1603. Because the text is much shorter than later editions and its language is less poetic, it is nicknamed the “Bad Quarto” by scholars. “To be or not to be” in Q1 reads as: To be, or not to be—ay, there’s the point. To die,\n\nThe American Sound: The Evolution of Jazz\n\nBy Cecilia Padilla There is nothing so uniquely American as jazz music. In its simplest form, jazz embodies the essence of the American people: bold and inventive. The improvisation of the jazz ensemble can even be seen as a metaphor for the American democratic ideal: musicians playing solos have the liberty to express themselves as long as they adhere to the overall structure of the tune—individual freedom but with responsibility to the group. The evolution of jazz music also carries with it the social development of our nation from slavery to the swinging songs of World War II. Musically, jazz contributed immensely to the way contemporary musicians approach instrumentation, composition, and vocal arrangements. It is difficult to find a popular tune today that does not derive from such jazz icons as Joe Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Thelonious Monk. Jazz is the great equalizer; for more than a hundred years, it has been the common ground between blacks and whites, me\n\nPurely Pinteresque: The Elements of Pinter's Language\n\nBy Taylor Steinbeck Most artists take years to establish their voice and style. This wasn’t the case for playwright Harold Pinter. His first West End play, The Birthday Party, showcases the elements of Pinter’s aesthetic that would later be evident throughout his 29 plays and 23 screenplays: the rhythm of colloquial language punctuated by pauses and silences, mysterious characters who rarely say what they mean, and the unsettling, yet witty juxtaposition of comedy and terror. Suspenseful and comical, familiar and foreign, disturbing and alluring, The Birthday Party is quintessential Pinter. Graphite drawing of Harold Pinter. By A.C.T. Senior Graphic Designer Brad Amorosino. Pinter is a playwright who uses the back-and-forth of everyday conversation to create conflict and shape power dynamics between characters. “My characters tend to use words not to express what they think or feel,” said Pinter in a 1995 speech, “but to disguise what they think or feel, to mask their actual"
