        "text": "DENNIS HAS A 'WARNING' FOR YOU\n\nFull disclosure: Styx is not playing Staten Island at 8 p.m. Friday.\n\nBut the band's VOICE is: Dennis DeYoung, a founding member and lead singer on seven of the group's Top 10 hits, will perform \"The Music of Styx\" at the historic St. George Theatre.\n\nAnd he has some words of advice for you.\n\n\"I'm gonna give you a warning: If you never liked Styx don't come to the show because there's a lotta Styx music in it,\" DeYoung told SILive. \"If you love Styx, get on down to see us do the finest job of recreating it in the universe.\"\n\nThe Chicago-based band originated in 1962 when brothers John and Chuck Panozzo joined 14-year-old DeYoung in the basement of his childhood home to form one of America’s most successful and enduring bands. Styx has sold over 35 million albums worldwide, making it the only band ever to record four consecutive triple-platinum albums.\n\nFor more than five decades, DeYoung has been a singer, songwriter, keyboardist and record producer. He continues to tour with his six-piece band around the world, showcasing all of Styx's greatest hits spanning the ‘70s, ‘80s, and ‘90s.\n\n\"So, close your eyes and it sounds just like the records — or keep your eyes open and get into the spirit of the whole doggone thing,\" said DeYoung, extending his apologies for postponing the show a few months ago due to illness.\n\nTickets are $49-$79 on Ticketmaster and at the box office. The historic St. George Theatre is located at 35 Hyatt St. and doors open at 7 for the 8 p.m. show. For more information, visit StGeorgeTheatre.com or call 718-442-2900.\n\nHere seven of the main reasons you need to show up:\n\nBEST OF TIMES\n\nDeYoung accomplished the difficult task of marrying a romantic lyrical theme with social commentary in this rock ballad. Sparse verses and a giant chorus showcase one of DeYoung’s best vocal performances.\n\n,\n\nThis flop from band's 1973 sophomore album (aka \"Styx II\") got a second shot in 1975, when it landed at No. 6 on the Billboard singles chart. DeYoung wrote the song, the first of many for his wife, and introduced what would become a Styx signature: Classical piano in the verse and heavy guitar riffs in the chorus.\n\nD\n\nThe lead single from the band's 1979 triple-platinum album \"Cornerstone\" was Styx's first, and only, number-one single in the United States. The song was written by DeYoung as a birthday present for his wife, Suzanne, and with no intention of putting it on the album. However, he eventually agreed to put his demo recording on the record with some guitar overdubs. The rest is Billboard Hot 100 history.\n\nCOME SAIL AWAY\n\nThe lead single from 1977's \"The Grand Illusion\" charted at No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. Still, \"Come Sail Away\" helped the band's seventh album achieve multi-platinum sales by 1978. It's one of the biggest hits of Styx's career. Wiki trivia: DeYoung revealed on In the Studio with Redbeard (which devoted an entire episode to the making of The Grand Illusion), that he was depressed when he wrote the track after his band's first two A&M offerings, \"Equinox\" and \"Crystal Ball,\" sold fewer units than expected after the success of the single \"Lady\".\n\nDCD\n\nThis guitar-driven rocker from 1978's \"Pieces of Eight\" actually began life as an acoustic ballad, but according to UltimateClassicRock.com, DeYoung suggested that Styx heavy it up into the classic it is today. Rock journalist Sterling Whitaker declared the result a \"staple of classic rock radio, television and movies, and sporting events, as well as every Styx concert since the dawn of man.\"\n\nMR. ROBOTO\n\nThis is where some alienated older fans griped that Styx jumped the shark — but there is no denying the pop culture impact of this Vocoder-spiced track from the rock opera album \"Kilroy Was Here.\"\n\nDeYoung sings the part of Robert Orin Charles Kilroy (ROCK), a musician placed in a futuristic prison for \"rock and roll misfits\" by the anti-rock-and-roll group the Majority for Musical Morality (MMM) and its founder, Dr. Everett Righteous (guitarist James Young).\n\nKilroy escapes by overpowering a Roboto prison guard and hiding inside its emptied-out metal shell. When Jonathan Chance (guitarist Tommy Shaw) finally meets Kilroy, at the very end of the song, Kilroy unmasks and says \"I'm Kilroy! Kilroy!\", ending the song.\n\nTrivia: “Mr. Roboto” was released at the last minute instead of “Don’t Let it End,” at the request of A&M Records. Stan Winston, of film fame, designed the Roboto costume and mask, which is featured on the album cover and music video.\n\nPop culture note: It introduced the Japanese phrase \"domou arigatou\" in the American vernacular.\n\nTOO MUCH TIME ON YOUR HANDS? TELL US YOUR FAVORITE STYX TRACK\n\nSound off by clicking the \"comments\" button at the top of this slideshow.\n\nOH, AND STATEN'S OWN STEVE AUGERI IS THE OPENING ACT\n\nDeYoung will be joined by special guest and opening act Steve Augeri, former lead singer of Journey and a Staten Island resident."
