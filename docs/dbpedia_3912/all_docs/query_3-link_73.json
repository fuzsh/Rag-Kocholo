James J. Kilroy was employed during the\n\nwar at the Bethlehem Steel Company's Quincy shipyard inspecting parts of\n\nwarships under construction. To satisfy his superiors that he was doing his job\n\nhe scribbled in yellow crayon 'Kilroy was here' on inspected work. It is\n\nbelieved that the shipyard workers who joined the armed forces were responsible\n\nfor the world-wide spread.\n\nIn article <37c084ee...@news.usenetserver.com>, rros...@mcs.net (Rich\n\nRostrom) says:\n\n>nicke...@mindspring.com (Porkchop) wrote:\n\n>> Can anyone tell me the origin of this term?\n\n>> Who was Kilroy , and when did he first strike?\n\n>Nobody knows.\n\nWell, I wouldn't go that far. Kilroy was an inspector at\n\nthe Brooklyn Navy Yard. Instead of putting a more usual\n\n\"passed\" mark on the large parts, he wrote \"Kilroy was\n\nhere.\" The marks had to be large because the parts were\n\nlarge, and the mark had be visible to the workmen. In this\n\ncase, the workman might be a crane operator.\n\nYes, the expression became popular. Evidence of having\n\nbeen there, as with the pregnant girl.\n\nIf I remember correctly, the expression was more popular in\n\nthe Pacific Theater than in the European theaters.\n\nGFH\n\n***************************************************************\n\nhttp://www.ankerstein.org/\n\nThe Anchor Stone Building Set (Anker-Steinbaukasten) Home Page\n\nSee what makes me tick.\n\n***************************************************************\n\nIn article <37c788f5...@news.curie.dialix.com.au>, John Wager\n\n<jwa...@mediaone.net> wrote:\n\n>|Abdullah Azad wrote:\n\n>|> Like so:\n\n>|> \\\\|//\n\n>|> (O O)\n\n>|> ===============oOo=(_)=oOo============\n\n>|I vaguely remember hearing another piece of this puzzle:\n\n>|That the kilroy graphic was actually a bit of circuit diagram\n\n>|for some kind of electronics, and this got translated\n\n>|soon into a cartoon figure.
