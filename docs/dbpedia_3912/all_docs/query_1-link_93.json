        "text": "Once\n\nthey served. Now they serve room service. In my travels, I've come\n\nacross many hotels that have weathered war. A B&B in Vicksburg,\n\nMiss., with a cannonball wedged in the wall. The lakeside villa where\n\nan Axis dictator tried to hold on to power at the end of World War II.\n\nA permanently anchored ship that set a record for carrying soldiers\n\nacross the sea to war.\n\nThere are hundreds of hotels with a war\n\nstory to tell. The places where Washington really \"slept here.\" The\n\nB&Bs and plantations of the South whose one-time owners bet on the\n\nConfederate cause and lost. During World War II, just about every major\n\nhotel on the West Coast served some military purpose. Even the\n\nAhwahnee, the luxury lodge in Yosemite National Park, was taken over as\n\na hospital for mentally anguished war casualties – a move that psychologists came to question, since the looming granite walls led to an unanticipated kind of claustrophobia.\n\nOut\n\nof this roll call of military service, I've picked a few notable spots\n\nI've found in the now-quiet, one-time war zones around the world.\n\nTHE WILLARD INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, WASHINGTON D.C.\n\nOne\n\nof the best hotels in the nation's capital was the scene of some\n\npresidential cloak and dagger in the days around the Civil War. Though\n\nthe current Willard dates to the 1890s, it sits on the site of an\n\nearlier version of the hotel where Abraham Lincoln arrived incognito\n\nFeb. 23, 1861, soon before his presidential inauguration. The secrecy\n\nwas due to an assassination attempt in Baltimore that had Lincoln\n\nbackers concerned that locals already bent on rebellion (Washington is\n\na very southern city to this day), might try again. But\n\nword got out and Lincoln soon was entertaining politicians and\n\nsocialites while planning his new cabinet and wrestling with reports of\n\nactions by southern states that were seceding from the Union rather\n\nthan accept his move into the White House. Lincoln left March 4, his\n\ninauguration day. A bill — hotel, not legislative — signed by Lincoln\n\nis framed in the lobby. The total for the 10-day stay: $773.75.\n\n1401 Pennsylvania Ave. NW; Washington, D.C., 20004. 202-628-9100 or www.washington.intercontinetal.com. Rooms from $322 per night.\n\nCEDAR GROVE MANSION INN, VICKSBURG, MISS.\n\nA\n\nUnion cannonball is still stuck in the parlor wall from the days when\n\nUnion gunboats laid siege to the key Mississippi River town. When the\n\nConfederates finally lost the city, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant snoozed away\n\n(rebels claim drunkenly) in the master bedroom of his new headquarters.\n\n2200 Oak St., Vicksburg, Miss. www. cedargroveinn.com or 800-862-1300. Rates from $100 per night.\n\nPERSHING HALL HOTEL, PARIS, FRANCE\n\nSupermodels\n\ncavort where Gen. John \"Black Jack\" Pershing planned American battle\n\nplans in World War I. The boutique hotel was also the former home of\n\nthe American Legion, the U.S. veterans group, in Paris. The scene is\n\ndecidedly hip, but there are remnants of the past all around –\n\nincluding American stars in the wrought ironwork and portraits of\n\nprominent past veterans upstairs.\n\n49 Rue Pierre Charron, Paris. 011-33-1-5836-5800 or www.pershinghall. com. Rooms from $556 per night.\n\nROYAL HAWAIIAN AND MOANA HOTELS, HONOLULU\n\nThe\n\ntwo venerable hotels were already well-established on the beach at\n\nWaikiki when the Japanese attacked nearby Pearl Harbor in 1941,\n\nbringing the United States into World War II. Shrapnel from the\n\nAmerican antiaircraft fire rained down on Honolulu. With the beaches a\n\ntangle of barbed wire as Americans prepared for a possible invasion of\n\nOahu, the hotels served as\n\nhospital wards and later as R&R spots until the conflict ended in\n\n1945. The Moana later merged with a modern hotel next door and today\n\nhas one of those needlessly pretentious corporate names: The Moana\n\nSurfrider, A Westin Resort Waikiki Beach. We'll just stick with the\n\nMoana. Much has changed, but the Moana's famed Banyan Court looks much\n\nthe way it did on the day the dive bombers and torpedo planes flew toward Battleship Row.\n\nCall (888) 625-4990 or go online at www.spg.com. The Royal Hawaiian is at 2259 Kalakaua Ave. The Moana is at 2365 Kalakaua Ave. For both hotels, go to www.spg.com or\n\ncall (888) 625-4990. Rates at the Royal Hawaiian and the Moana start at\n\njust under $300 per night but can climb steeply during busy periods.\n\nGRAND HOTEL A VILLA FELTRINELLI, LAKE GARDA, ITALY\n\nAfter\n\nthe Allied invasion of Italy, Italian politicians arrested dictator\n\nBenito Mussolini and had him tucked away in a mountain prison. But Nazi\n\ndictator Adolf Hitler sent crack troops to rescue \"Il Duce\" and had his\n\nfamily installed in this 1892 villa on Lake Garda, where he\n\nre-established his muchdiminished fascist regime. His mistress was at\n\nanother villa down the lakeside. Near the war's end, Mussolini fled but\n\nwas killed by partisans. The villa was next owned by a communist\n\nmillionaire (yes, in Italy there were such things) who died in the\n\n1970s while trying to blow up an electrical transmission tower. Today\n\nit is one of the top small resorts in the world, operated by the former\n\nmanager of the Kahala Hilton in Hawaii. Via Rimembranza 38-40,\n\nGargnano, Italy. 011-39-0365-798-000 or www.villafeltrinelli.com. Rooms from $1,025 per night.\n\nKEMPINSKI HOTEL ADLON, BERLIN, GERMANY\n\nBefore\n\nWorld War II, the Adlon was the great meeting place for expatriate\n\njournalists covering the rise of Adolf Hitler. It was damaged in World\n\nWar II and later demolished by the Soviet puppet East German\n\ngovernment. The Berlin Wall came down in 1989 and eight years later, a\n\nmodern version of the Adlon rose on the same spot near the Brandenburg\n\nGate. It's also famous as the spot where Michael Jackson held his baby\n\nover the balcony rail while waving to fans in 2002.\n\n011-49-0-30-22610 or www. hotel-adlon.de. Unter den Linden 77, Berlin. Rooms from $571 per night.\n\nRELEXA SCHLOSSHOTEL CECILIENHOF, POTSDAM, GERMANY\n\nThe one-time royal getaway outside of Berlin is where Russian dictator Joseph Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\n\nand U.S. President Harry Truman met to carve up Europe at the end of\n\nWorld War II. The 43-room hotel has been reborn as a quirky getaway in\n\nthe now-unified Germany.\n\nNeuer Garten, Potsdam. 011-49-331-37050 or www.relexahotels.de. Rooms from $198 per night.\n\nINTERCONTINENTAL RESORT BERCHTESGADEN, GERMANY\n\nUnlike\n\nthe Adlon and Relexa Schlosshotel Cecilienhof, which play up their\n\nWorld War II links, the sparkling new luxury hotel in the German Alps\n\nsouth of Munich would rather you looked out the windows at the\n\nmountains and didn't think too much about what came before. That's\n\nbecause it is actually located in Obersalzberg, the onetime playground\n\nof the Nazis and Adolf Hitler's place of \"inspiration.\" The ruins of\n\nthe Nazi enclave are still evident, and the resort was built next to\n\nwhat was once Luftwaffe leader Hermann Goering's estate and over what\n\nwas once the radio room of the underground bunker system. Creepy and\n\ngorgeous.\n\nHintereck 1, Berchtesgaden, Germany. 800-424-6835 or www. ichotelsgroup.com. Rooms from $309 per night.\n\nREX HOTEL, HO CHI MINH CITY\n\nAlong\n\nwith the nearby Continental and the Caravelle, the Rex was a center of\n\nintrigue in the city then called Saigon during both the French and\n\nAmerican involvement. The Rex was the unadvertised headquarters of the\n\nCIA during the war. After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975 and the\n\nofficial renaming of the city after the North Vietnamese leader, the\n\nold hotels fell into\n\narchitectural slumber. But with the reopening of the country in the\n\n1990s, development has transformed the area (the Caravelle, the\n\njournalists' favorite, especially looks nothing like its old days –\n\nit's all sleek and luxurious now). But any visitor to the city should\n\nstop in at the rooftop bar of the Rex on a Friday or Saturday night just to watch the throngs of locals enjoying the relative cool of the evening below.\n\n141 Nguyen Hue Blvd., Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. www.rexho telvietnam.com or 011-84-8-829-2185. Rooms from $140 per night.\n\nMORE WAR\n\nIt's\n\nmore of a tourist attraction, but the Queen Mary in Long Beach, has a\n\nhotel on board. You'll sleep more comfortably than the 16,683 soldiers\n\nand crew who were sped across the Atlantic in 1943 in one trip at the\n\nheight of World War II — the most people ever carried on one ship.\n\nSome\n\nof the war-related hotels I have yet to visit include Villa Bled in\n\nSlovakia, the playground of the anti-Nazi partisan turned Yugoslavian\n\ndictator Josip Broz Tito.\n\nLike\n\nmany of the great hotels of Paris, the Hotel Meurice was forced to host\n\nGerman forces after the occupation in 1940. But the Meurice was able to\n\nregain some of its honor as the site of the official surrender of the\n\ncity back to the French in 1944.\n\nThe Hotel New Grand in\n\nYokohoma, Japan, is where Gen. Douglas MacArthur first set up his\n\nheadquarters for the occupation of Japan after the surrender in Tokyo\n\nBay. Suite 316, where the general lived, is kept as it was in his day\n\nand can be rented by the night by history buffs or the merely curious.\n\nAlso,\n\na Cold War-era villa has gone from strongman's hideaway to exclusive\n\nluxury getaway: Stalin's Black Sea dacha — really more of a compound —\n\nis part of the Zelenaya Rosha resort."
