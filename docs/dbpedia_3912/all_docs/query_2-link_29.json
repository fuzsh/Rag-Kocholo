        "text": "Dear ladies of this particular ancestral shield, who refuse to allow me to live out my days as a bachelor of poise and equanimity:\n\nAh, my wonderfully charming kinswomen! There are simply not enough holidays in the year for us to gather together and celebrate the richness of life. It is always such a merry occasion to be in your presence, as you all have such a fiery zest for existence. And now, I am straight-up begging you to let me die alone.\n\nPlease.\n\nPlease be open to the idea that I may want to live, and very well exit this world, riding a spiritual motorcycle without a spiritual sidecar.\n\nYou see, after years of enduring the same narrow dialogue, my mind, my spirit, and indeed my body have weakened. Tell me about your job, your hobbies, your anything; hell, unburden yourself of all your opinions about your damnable commute and those marital troubles that have ventured well beyond mild suspicion!\n\nFor I can no longer endure such exchanges:\n\n“You should get a girlfriend.”\n\n“There are actually a few friendlywomen in my life right now.”\n\n“Why don’t you want a relationship?”\n\n“Just rarely my thing.”\n\n“But it’d be so nice.”\n\n“Not for me… or them, eventually.”\n\n“You know, someone special.”\n\n“Hello? Are these ears on?”\n\n“…a teammate of sorts…”\n\n“The hell is happening? Is this purgatory? HELLO?”\n\n“…who we’d meet…”\n\n“HEY I BLEW UP THE MOON AND NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS ASSASSINATING THE LOCAL CATS I USED TO PAY PROTECTION TO AS A WARNING.”\n\nThen, as if a gaggle of wedding dresses were drunk in wherever the brain’s equivalent of the garage is — I have no idea, biology was an 8 a.m. class when I was 19 and I was half-Popov back then — some dart is unceremoniously hucked with an arm spin leftover from college softball, and in comes some reference to my life so obscure that it actually perplexes me, the only geek who’d be able to catch it.\n\n“Hey, what about that church friend’s niece who wore that slimming mauve number to Grandpa’s funeral 15 years ago, the one you discussed community service with — each of you with a wildlydifferent reference point on the matter — for roughly six minutes at the reception?”\n\nWHO, I DARE ASK. WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. AM I HAVING A STROKE WHILE ALSO TAKING THE LSAT. WHAT IS THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING. IS THIS HOW THEY GET CONFESSIONS.\n\n“Or whatever happened to that childhood neighbor of yours who set the treehouse on fire because she saw The Craft too young?”\n\nLADY, THIS ISN’T TRUE DETECTIVE. I DON’T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HER EITHER. DO YOU WANT ME AT THE LIBRARY SNOOPING AROUND ON A MICROFILM READER? YOU KNOW, SHE ALSO SAW THE GAME TOO YOUNG AND WOULDN’T STOP RANTING ABOUT REALITY BEING A SUPREMELY ORGANIZED, ALL-ENCOMPASSING CONSPIRACY PLOT AGAINST HER WHEN ALL I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS THE MIGHTY MIGHTY BOSSTONES.\n\nThat gal moved away, anyway — and with her went my copy and thus any pivotal period-appropriate understanding of The Outsiders — and I assume she is now very happy with a live-in consort she met on Wiccan Twitter.\n\nAs for me, all that’s left is a sad, pathetic life where I do exactly what I want all the time, and which ends in a eulogy I assume to be akin to this: “He died alone, even though I told him not to and now we’ll probably just bury him in the backyard like that goldfish he killed.”\n\n[For the record, the murder at tiny sea was an accident. It was Thanksgiving and I thought, hey, I’m eating more than I should today, so should Aurum! Alas, the road to Hell saw the addition of at least one paving stone that day.]\n\nFollowing that brief funeral oration — the deliverer of which will likely be determined by drawing reusable straws from my millennial straw collection — you will head to the two-plot tombstone I imagine you’ve all chipped in to purchase just so I could eternally rest beside a coffin full of pharmacy valentines under the chiseled namesake, “Unfulfilled” — a grave that henceforth, in that weird final drunken hour of Christmas, would be sardonically referred to as the Tomb of the Unknown Lover.\n\nOn the fateful day of my single-ticket departure, I figure the small talk that’d populate the cemetery, as stilettos till the first and final plot of land I’ll ever call my own, would include gems like, “Can you believe he never proposed to that coworker he mentioned in passing one Easter?”\n\nIf I were to actually marry, I’d have to hire a choir to drown out all the pats on the back, cushioned by whisper-yells of, “You know, I was the one who suggested he get married someday somewhere to someone at some point. Am I a matchmaker? Maybe. A saint? You know, who’s to say?”\n\nMeanwhile, I’ll be at the altar thinking of all the times 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 was barked at me like some witch’s curse. In my vows, I’ll likely hold back tears as I inform my extremely-soon-to-be-wife, “You saved me from a life of sexual exploration and potential deviancy that I would’ve found thrilling, but this is good, too.”\n\nThis has gone on for so long that, if I were to bring around another “girlfriend,” eyes would roll black and open mouths would ominously emit some ancient song that only the wind could translate. Lest we forget the last time I brought a ladyfriend to a family wedding! She named every military coup the United States government has backed in Latin America and suddenly my family took the most diligent interest in my office job.\n\nAnyway, all this to say, I can’t make Thanksgiving. Some gal I’m seeing invited me to hers and it sounds like a vacation.\n\nYour dearest spinsir,\n\nJake\n\nI reviewed Justin Timberlake’s extremely unassuming concept album Man of the Woods and it’s easily the craziest thing I’ve ever heard. There’s (almost) no music on it whatsoever, and yet art must be examined and explored, so here it is, a track-by-track journey through the brazenly weird and indulgent spectacle.\n\n1. “Filthy”\n\nFrom the get-go, Timberlake is sure as hell what he wants to do without really knowing what he wants from it. He explains his album’s concept to a therapist, not directly to the listener, about his eagerness to record everything he does and separate the great from the good. In the process, he’d like to “disappear from the filthy life [he’s] known.” The inspiration, as it turns out, comes from Dave Grohl. See, toward the end of the ’90s, the Foo Fighters frontman was drinking himself into oblivion in Los Angeles. Feeling the weight of indulgence and the filth of the city, Grohl bought a quiet house in Virginia and turned the basement into a studio. His two bandmates — “this was before they started sizing up like the Polyphonic Spree,” clarifies Timberlake — joined him and all the three of them did was hang out, barbecue, and work on There Is Nothing Left to Lose, arguably their strongest record. “It just always sounded like the best recording process imaginable,” Timberlake says. He’s not wrong either. I’m entirely onboard at this point. Then he adds, “I just don’t want my record to sound like Hole.” This comment sends me into a mouth-foaming frenzy. I immediately hatch a plan to kidnap his former brotherhood of *NSYNC before realizing I’d have just as easy a time getting the pop star to pay out a Backstreet Boy ransom these days. By the time I try to lure/add these goofs on LinkedIn, I consider the whole revenge plot pointless and give up, ultimately and reluctantly returning to the album.\n\n2. “Midnight Summer Jam”\n\nThis entire track is just Timberlake making a playlist for cooking and there’s no cohesion to it whatsoever. The lineup starts with a Parliament “booty banger” — his words, not mine — and ends with a Christmas song. His own “Can’t Stop the Feeling” makes an appearance, but I can’t fault him for it. That song’s a blast. However, I honestly can’t tell if Timberlake knows he recorded it.\n\n3. “Sauce”\n\nIf not for the sensational closer, this would be the album’s standout track. It’s just Timberlake going over his favorite recipe for a ginger barbecue sauce. It’s the only time headdresses the audience directly and he is tremendously invested in it. His tone is level-headed and charming, and he tells the listener they can do it, no problem, at least a half-dozen times. I kind of understand why everyone crushes on him here. I have a brief moment of falling in love with him too. He looks like Ryan Gosling, but has the approachability of Jimmy Fallon. Alas, the only time I’ve related to Cameron Diaz is short-lived.\n\n4. “Man of the Woods”\n\nShortly after being introduced to Justin the Chef, we’re met with Justin the Pop Singer talking about shedding his skin to become Justin the Man of the Woods. The whole pitch sounds way more Red Dragon than I think he intends, as he goes on and on about “the glory of the wilderness” and his intentions to “kill self to become more and beyond.” Then he gets distracted with listing things you can do in the woods, ranging from enjoying tranquil hikes along a foggy coast to creeping around the edges of a farmer’s property and stealing looks at the missus from the dark canopy of a woodland haven. The track ends with him simply naming birds, some of which aren’t even found in forested areas.\n\n5. “Higher, Higher”\n\nTimberlake gets so damn excited about his own idea that he puts on a Pat Boone record — no idea which one, they all sound the same to me — and proceeds to dance-complete packing a duffel bag while smoking several joints and calling his posse one by one to explain the upcoming weekend plans and the “miracle project that’ll finally wipe Tom DeLonge and his beloved Angels & Airwaves clean off the face of the musical earth.” I can’t even tell you what this means. He gets so high it’s almost a coded language rooted in pop culture references (even replacing the word “Machiavellian” with “”McConaugheyian”). After a coughing fit that a tween would consider amateur, he takes to microwaving burritos and singing to them and the world somehow starts making sense again.\n\n6. “Wave”\n\nA day or two later, with his friends rounded up in the driveway — I don’t catch any names — Timberlake and his crew pile into two or three cars and head out. Timberlake, both figuratively and literally, waves goodbye to his old life. He doesn’t mention his family, but he apparently has a soft spot for the community pool, because he tearfully talks the driver into pulling over for that one, claiming it could’ve been his parent in another life. I think he’s STILL high. Actually, given a few off-hand comments, I’m pretty sure he made shroom burritos, which makes him smarter than Neil DeGrasse Tyson in my book.\n\n7. “Supplies”\n\nArriving at the campsite, Timberlake proceeds to list off what he forgot to bring, which appears to be practically everything. Someone suggests visiting the general store and Timberlake clarifies that he needs specific items. There is a disorienting interlude of silence.\n\n8. “Morning Light”\n\nAs far as I can tell, this is just Timberlake providing Alicia Keys (who I guess is also there?) with a detailed account of how his wife doesn’t know where he is — “gone by morning light,” he says with a wink I can hear. He mentions downloadable content that includes blueprints of their home and sketches he made visualizing his escape. Keys asks if everything is okay at home. Timberlake asks who’s asking. Keys asks what. Timberlake then also asks what. After a breathy silence, Keys quietly sings “this girl is so tired” to herself. Timberlake counters this out of nowhere with, “So what’s up with horses? They cool?”\n\n9. “Say Something”\n\nAlthough the conversation occurs in the growing distance, away from the hot mic — which Timberlake continually refers to as Keaton, because Michael Keaton is “the hottest Mike,” a joke that he explains no less than ten times — it seems that Keys bails on “whatever Deliverance tribute this hipster summer camp is turning out to be” and leaves. Timberlake, to his credit, isn’t mad; instead, he simply says, as if doves are landing on his sunshine-drenched arms, “She doesn’t get it.” That’s when Chris Stapleton (who is ALSO there, I guess?) asks if they’re going to record any music today. With the airy reassurance of a demigod at the end of an orgy, Timberlake breathily informs the country star, “We are the music and we are not ready.” Stapleton sighs and ultimately flags down Keys for a ride.\n\n10. “Hers (Interlude)”\n\nThis title makes no sense. The only explanation I can figure is that it was supposed to be “Covers (Interlude)” and the phone call cut out when Timberlake drunk-dialed his producer, who only heard the last part. It’s just increasingly drunker versions of “Wagon Wheel” around a campfire. Seriously, it’s the same song over and over and over, progressively getting sloppier, but that doesn’t stop Timberlake from repeatedly yelling, “Hell yeah! Was that ____________?” One time, it’s “the Stones”; another, it’s “Jack Johnson,” who Timberlake seems to believe he played in a Saturday Night Livesketch. [It was actually Bon Iver and he was very good.] Each question ends with Timberlake doing a finger snap (that he assumedly completes with an extended throw of his entire arm) and then takes the loudest sip of a tall boy you’ve ever heard. It’s barely sunset.\n\n11. “Flannel”\n\nTimberlake, it turns out, did not come entirely unprepared. Now that it’s a chilly night, he reveals how he “brought enough flannel to date Seattle,” a sentence he promptly writes down as a catchy slant rhyme for his upcoming “Chris Pine phase,” which he corrects to his “Chris Evans phase.” [He of course means Chris Gaines, the bad boy rock star alter ego of Garth Brooks.] I imagine Timberlake has apparently not been to Washington since Amazon crept in like Jeff VanderMeer’s Area X. Still, his flannel collection sounds impressive, as he describes the ideal occasion for wearing each one, based on the color palette alone. His ruminations range from a green-and-blue flannel for a casual fundraiser at a juicery to a fire-colored flannel for The Hunger Games, which he mistakes as “the first movie Stanley Tucci’s directed since Big Night.” [To clarify, Tucci acted in the franchise, but didn’t direct any of the films. He’s directed, as well as written, several films since Big Night, which I hoped Timberlake would call Biggie Nights or In the Big of the Night. He doesn’t.] This has a nice ending though, as Timberlake invites everyone to try on the flannels, so he can go around praising how good they look. Each dude is allowed to keep the one he looks best in and I was suddenly mad I wasn’t present for the flannel that one of the guys quietly refers to as “the ugliest thing since the Dallas revival,” a burn that truly floors me.\n\n12. “Montana”\n\nThis is actually a very pleasant group conversation about the state of Montana until a debate arises if there is, in fact, a city of “Hannah” there. Timberlake admits that he’s pretty sure there isn’t, but wants to know for sure because that’d be “so funny.” This is followed by several minutes of everyone quietly trying to get service. Eventually, the conversation splits off into entirely separate dialogues, one about Glacier National Park and one about the neurological effects of molly. The track closes with Timberlake drunkenly posing what he seems to believe is a riddle, “What’s a party in the USA?” There are two admirable attempts at solving the puzzle — “The GOP” and “any gathering that has more than one bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos” — as well as several sorta-guesses, ranging from “Andrew WK” to “hey man, what isn’t a party.” Timberlake stifles a few crafty giggles throughout. Once everyone gives up, he sings the line, “It’s a party in the USA.” A frustrated wave of understanding weaves through the woods.\n\n13. “Breeze Off the Pond”\n\nHoping to “sober up enough to find wood sprites and trap them in a collection of jars called our hearts,” Timberlake and crew stand at the edge of the nearby pond (“nature’s diffuser of our most essential oil — water,” the pop singer somehow calls it). There’s a howl, which spooks all of the men except Timberlake, who whispers, “I’ve found you, my mad bitch.” In the moment that follows, I swear, you can hear the drunken necks crack as they all turn to their (honestly and truly) fearless leader. Timberlake calls out with a terrifying sound I can’t even begin to describe before he laughs heartily and mightily. I assume he’s not wearing a shirt here. He sounds shirtless. He sounds shirtless as hell.\n\n14. “Livin’ Off the Land”\n\nNo joke, this whole track is just Timberlake drunkenly trying to eat stuff — mostly berries and leaves. His friends gently talk him out of the desire finally, but he straight up tries to gobble a frog, which I’m pretty sure he considered an edible, since he goes off about licking toads. He’s SO drunk. I know this because he also mentions beating Battletoads in Battlemaniacs on Super Nintendo and that nonsense was borderline impossible. If true, this is more impressive than the shroom burritos. I kind of fall in love again.\n\n15. “The Hard Stuff”\n\nAfter an extraordinarily sloppy false start to New Kids on the Block’s “You Got It (The Right Stuff),” Timberlake proceeds to hype a drink that seems to just be Bacardi 151 chased with hipster moonshine made by his friend, a dealer known only as Kicks. The move doesn’t take. Timberlake coughs until the track ends. Somehow, it’s not an hour but it feels like it.\n\n16. “Young Man”\n\nThis is so very far and away the best track on the album; I can’t help but ask questions. And they are not simpleton curiosities about the direction of music or the (arguable) evolution of art; I have burning inside me what are, at minimum, neuron-assassinating attempts at coming to terms (grips?) with existence, mortality, and what may come in the unknown that follows, whether it be total darkness or a daydreamy box social among the stars.\n\nHere, we listen to Timberlake’s comrades say good night to each other, which is undeniably precious and insanely cute — I’m pretty sure Kicks lullabies someone to sleep — and then there are only the sounds of the wilderness. We finally hear this prophesied “Man of the Woods” in his element. In the alluring respite, Timberlake hums to himself beside the pond, head against a log and I assume hands folded across his chest. He drifts off adorably into slumber and you believe this to be the end of the album. What else is there to a Man of the Woods at the end of a night? However, this is not the end; it is only the beginning. I recognize the cliché here, yet, I swear on all that has led me to this moment in history, it is anything but.\n\nTimberlake stirs and sits up — I assume crossing his legs, facing the pond — and his voice reemerges, more angular and bold, almost rehearsed, and what follows is, without a single hint of the remotest doubt, the most robust meditation I have ever heard on ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. He touches on how, if all holy texts were woven together, tightened up and ordered — not entirely unlike the Boiled Leather version of the fourth and fifth books in George R. R. Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire series — humanity would have every single answer they crave about theology. He doesn’t necessarily claim there to be a definitive god or goddess (and, as he explains in incredible, pretty much unfathomable depth, even this consideration of male god or female goddess is “as narrow a light in the world as a single ray of sunshine sweeping past teeth”). Timberlake suggests that the meaning of life is so all-encompassing it is essentially rendered meaningless. Toward the end, he poses a question I honestly haven’t stopped thinking about: “Would you, and could you, worship air? Should you, a creature of finite capability, dedicate your waking actuality to something as entirely indifferent to your life as it is your death, even though it is the only thing separating the two for you?”\n\nBy now, you likely share the notion that gave me chills so aggressively I thought my spine shattered. It’s not Timberlake. Or it’s his body, sure, but whatever truth rings out from his mouth with his voice has not been sourced from his consciousness. Timberlake, I suspect, is merely an amplifier here, a singer being used as mere instrument. Whether alien or god/goddess — Timberlake’s right, divine masculine and/or divine feminine is a patronizingly elementary observation of the assumed universe-creator, which may be a family or even an entire species — the entity that performs on this track is the most important individual and/or group that has blessed our world with a presence.\n\nThis monologue is a good 15 minutes and it simultaneously feels a week long and only a few seconds. I remember when I first heard Godspeed You! Black Emperor in high school and naively barked at a kickback, “This is as deep as it goes!” But, seriously, Timberlake makes Godspeed sound like The Ataris. Timberlake (or whoever/whatever speaks through him) drops a “genre” of music that can only be described with the word ‘post’ and a militia of exponentials. It’s post-post-post-music/art/infinity and it nourished me like a flood and abandoned me dry. I know how this sounds. It’s…insane. I FEEL insane. But it’s beautiful. It’s SO beautiful. This world is as saturated as it is empty and I for one cannot wait for the follow-up album, if only for the nurturing dream of further ethereal guidance. I hope Timberlake (and whatever briefly visited, or continues to lurk within, him) shows up to Grammys, unhinges his jaw, and devours the building and its concept, blessing them with annihilation for cursing us with rudimentary sounds we believed to be “music” all these years.\n\nNow we know the brilliant truth. This is the light. You are all welcomed to it.\n\nWhen I was unjustly kicked out of the greatest Ray Manzarek cover band to ever come out of Cincinnati, I promised myself three things:\n\n1. Get tested.\n\n2. Find love.\n\n3. Never betray rock 'n roll.\n\nThe first promise was originally in regards to paternity (the kid wasn't mine, but the dog and No Fear shirts were). Since then, I've made it my life's duty to always get myself tested. Even in my pre-date pep talks, I always make sure to ask, \"Are you ready to rock?\" And guess what? The answer's always yes.\n\nBut, sure, down the road I was, in fact, tested again and diagnosed with \"the alphabet soup of hepatitis\" by a doctor I'd like to diagnose with poor beside manners. I simply had too many dreams. Though, yeah, okay, one of those dreams was to have unprotected sex with 1,000 Denny's waitresses.\n\nAs for the second promise, I did find love. Her name was Dinah, and she worked at a Denny's. The right girl is always where you least expect it, I guess. Months later, she was gone though. Tragically diagnosed with a cheater's heart. And, later, assumedly some hepatitis, courtesy of yours truly. I mean, I'm no saint. Hell, I'm barely even a hardware store assistant manager or a Bob Seger fan!\n\nNow, we come to the last promise. I owe rock 'n roll my life. Literally. I was born to a dice inspector father and a riverboat pickpocket mother, but in actuality, it was the ghost of Eddie \"Guitar Slim\" Jones using my daddy's dong to pork Janis Joplin in my mama's body in that county fair detainment center. I mean, come on, that's basic science. Just because Neil deGrasse Tyson didn't narrate that cosmo-spiritual avatar sex, which I have to assume was extremely raunchy and somewhat bewildering with two adults handcuffed and drunk off \"loonshine\" (one part whiskey, one part gasoline from a stolen car), doesn't mean it didn't happen just like that.\n\nYet, decades later, thanks to Obama, I'm all of a sudden hard up for cash. I need to pay rent or my landlord will evict me. I think. His accent's pretty thick. Might be from Boston. Maybe Laos. I don't know. Geography's pretty dumb, and I did not finish high school (you just need life experience for a resume anyway).\n\nSo, after generously donating most of my belongings to local creditors, I am selling my treasured 1983 Yamaha P22.\n\nThis is a hard day. This piano got me chicks in every dive bar from Cincinnati to Covington. When I was diddling the keys, those leathered up babes thought I was playing them. And I would. Later. After I'd get too loaded to finish the set.\n\nFor the record, though, that's not why they kicked me out of the band. Let me be clear. They kicked me out because their friend Reggie owned a keyboard, and they said it made more sense to have a keyboard than a piano, and I said it made more sense to shred with real musicians instead of band geeks. And that was the last time I saw them. Well, as a member anyway. I saw them a few years ago at a BBQ. They were alright.\n\nBut back to the archangel of rock piano! Did you know, according to a survey of Ohio's greatest rock pianist, the Yamaha P22's birth was the raddest thing about 1983?\n\nIt beat out the release of the totally awesome and kick-ass Return of the Jedi, the debut of the friggin' Chicken McNugget, and the long-awaited break-up of those asshats, The Carpenters, finally quitting after they single-handedly tried to kill music like the tone-deaf children of the corn. Why Alice Cooper never ate their fingers is beyond me.\n\nAnyway, speaking of fingers, this superbabe-magnet, once nicknamed \"88 Keys for 88 Beans\" by a guy who looked like Lemmy from Motörhead himself, could be yours for just $3,000.\n\nThat's right, only $3,000! And you seem like just the right kind of cool dude or dudette I'm looking for. I can only trust you or any friends or family you may know that want to save rock music and/or have a few grand. Tell them about me and this fierce wooden dragon of rad. Please. At $3,000, this blessed masterpiece is practically a gift, and rumor has it the wood is from all the stakes used in the many attempts to find out once and for all if Prince is a vampire.\n\nThis piano is like a jet ski that can magically play the intro to Meatloaf's \"Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are\" by heart. In fact, this piano may legally be classified as an aphrodisiac. Bet you won't find that section of Guitar Center! Shoot, this may even be the same kind of piano Billy Joel nailed his \"uptown girl\" on. This piano is borderline a secret that I'm only telling you about (or, again, any friends or family, maybe some well-to-do co-worker you sometimes get lunch with). Tell yourself and everyone you know that this piano could potentially make you the next Mozart (high-flyin' '80s version). Like me, you could become the class act you always promised your older brother Ted you'd be one day.\n\nI'm telling you, here and now, this is the single greatest deal I've heard of since my French landlord told me I could keep half my security deposit."
