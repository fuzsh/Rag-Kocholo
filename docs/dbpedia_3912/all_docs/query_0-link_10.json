        "text": "Washington, DC\n\n17th St., between Constitution and Independence Ave.\n\nGPS coordinates: 38.889613,-77.040306\n\nTake a photo of your rally flag with the above image.\n\nâKilroy was Hereâ was an American popular culture expression, often seen in graffiti in war-torn Europe. Its origins are debated, but the phrase and distinctive accompanying doodleâa bald-headed man and prominent nose peeking over a wall with the fingers of each hand clutching the wall became popular with GIs serving in Europe, providing some levity in unpleasant conditions.\n\nThe phrase may have originated through United States servicemen, who would draw the doodle and the text \"Kilroy was here\" on the walls and other places they were stationed, encamped, or visited. An early example of the phrase being used may date from 1937, before World War II.\n\nAccording to one story, it was reported that German intelligence found the phrase on captured American equipment. This began leading Hitler to believe that Kilroy could be the name or codename of a high-level Allied spy. At the time of the Potsdam Conference in 1945, it was rumored that Stalin found \"Kilroy was here\" written in the VIP's bathroom, prompting him to ask his aides who Kilroy was.\n\nWWII Memorial hours: 24 hours daily, staffed 0930-2000 hours. The memorial is huge and you may need to ask staff where one of the two Kilroys is located. Either one will do."
