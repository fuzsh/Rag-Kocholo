        "text": "A 55 year old thank you!\n\nA Search for Dennis\n\nGeorge Ciampa wrote:\n\nDennis was a gunner on a Navy troop ship. The ship was transporting us from England to Normandy just prior to the D-Day. He probably saved my life. I only know that he shot down a German torpedo plane that was attempting to torpedo us. It happened in the middle of the night. We heard a loud explosion. By the time I heard that he shot the plane down, we were so busy that I did not see him again.. Prior to that episode, during the day, we hit a mine cable that exploded about 50 to 100 yards off the starboard side. Fortunately, no damage was done but I was only too happy to leave the ship. By the time we landed at Normandy, we had been sitting broadside to shore waiting to climb down a rope ladder into a landing craft. German 88's were firing over us and I just wanted to get on shore since I could not swim. We made two attempted landings with 88's firing over the landing craft before finally landing at Utah Beach. Part of our outfit landed at Utah and part at Omaha. I was in a graves registration company (607th). Our job was to pick up the dead and bury them in temporary cemeteries on the two beachheads.\n\nI had met Dennis while on board. He was 18 or 19 at the time, as was I. I casually met him a few days before and he invited me to the ship's galley for lunch. He was from Ohio, I believe Cincinnati. Richard Blake is his name. I would like to locate him.\n\nNote to readers: If you know anything about Richard, please contact the editor. Click here or on the link at the bottom of the page!\n\nUPDATE, August 1, 2004\n\nI sent a letter to Kilroy some time ago and after all this time finally discovered that the person I was looking for DENNIS REED. He was from Cinn. Ohio.\n\nDo you know Don J. Gilliland?\n\nAt Hendricks Field?\n\nJim Joyce wrote:\n\nHello I'm looking for information or photos (class photo or photo album) on a Pilot trained at Hendricks Field at Sebring, Florida from March to June 1942. His name was Don J. Gilliland. Can you help or point me in the right direction?\n\nHe lived in our Community and we recently honored him with a big frame in our dance hall, it is over 4' x 5'. Full of pictures, medals, information, patriotic saying, and pictures of him (tough to get). There was good local press coverage on the event too. I received a journal from another pilot who served with him and were best friends, it reads like a novel and he wants my help publishing it. So I'm still looking for information on him. As far as relatives are concerned the government is still looking. Some say he was married before going overseas and had a son prior to his being killed. Others say he was never married, memories are slipping at 57 years ago and everyone at 76+ age.\n\nThat's why I want to get it right to honor these airmen before they are all gone! and we will be guessing history like the Civil War.\n\nThanks, Jim\n\nNote to readers: If you know anything about Don J. Gilliland, please contact the editor. Click here or on the link at the bottom of the page!\n\nDo you know Cpl. Bell.?\n\n124th?\n\nI'm trying to hunt up some information on my dad, I know this is a way long shot, but I have to try. I have reason to believe that my dad (and my uncle) were in the 124th. He entered into active service in Feb 1941 at Camp Blanding and may have been transferred out in early 1944. My dad's name was Clifford Bell (my uncles name is Reid Bell, I know he made it all the way to New Guinea, Morotai and Mindanao). I also know my dad ended up in Germany and was discharged from the 604th Engineers Combat Bn., he was a Cpl. at the time, his MOS was Camouflage Technician 804. He was qualified as SS BAR in June 1943 and SS RIFLE in January 1044. He departed for overseas in February 1943. I believe at that time he was heading for Germany. His date of entry into service is February 1941 and was discharged in October 1945. So what this has to do with 124th? I'm not sure. Why I think he at one time was in the 124th is this: my Uncle Reid Bell, says that my dad served with him in the 124th There is also his picture in a year book of the 124th Infantry. My uncle was later transferred to the 155th, but he (my uncle) was in one of the Battalions on the 124th during the Driniumor river Battle in New Guinea. Anyway my uncle's memory and a picture in a year book is not conclusive evidence, but it does raise a mystery to me. I know it's been a long time and there were a lot of men in that unit, but I came across this on the internet, so I thought I would ask.\n\nThanks very much,\n\nLance Bell\n\nNote to readers: If you know anything about Corporal Bell, please contact the editor. Click here or on the link at the bottom of the page!\n\nResponse 1\n\nHi Pat,\n\nIt's obvious that Lance's Dad, Clifford Bell was with the 124th Infantry Regiment in Fort Benning as we have his photo with Hq Co 2nd Bn. The 124th was at Fort Benning from January 1942 until the Fall of 1943. While we (124th) were at Fort Benning many guys were shipped out to form other Infantry Regiments. It's possible that your Dad was shipped out on one of these cadres. If not then he went to Fort Jackson, South Carolina along with the rest of us in the 124th. There were now very few of us left who had been with the 124th in Camp Blanding as replacements were sent in as the old hands were sent out when forming new Regiments. At Fort Jackson the Regiment was deactivated and men were shipped to various units. I was sent back to the 31st Infantry \"Dixie\" Division Service Company 154th Infantry Regiment. This was later redesignated the 124th and we were in combat in New Guinea, Morotai and Mindanao. If your Uncle Reid Bell was in New Guinea with us then he probably followed along the lines that I did. If Reid Bell is still living or any of his heirs then refer them to the website www.kilroywashere.org and to my narrative which recounts the 124th Infantry all the way from Camp Blanding and back to Camp Blanding. If anyone wishes to contact me then I would be happy to relate whatever knowledge I have of the 124th.\n\n(Aubrey) Paul Tillery\n\nClick here for\n\nM/Sgt Tillery's Pictures and info.\n\nNote to readers: If you want to contact Paul, click here or on the link at the bottom of the page. I will forward to him.\n\nResponse 2\n\nDear Pat,\n\nI've been pondering the question of Clfford Bell. The name means nothing to me. From his letter, the two brothers were at Camp Blanding not long after the National Guards's were federalized in Nov. However I do know that none of the 31st Div. men ever went to Europe unless they transferred to another unit. The 31st spent a good bit of time in 42-43 as cadre at Fort Benning,GA. While there many, many opted to transfer into just about every branch of service, many went to OCS. The three Divisions of the 31st were remanned with replacements and ended up with every part of the country represented.\n\nI think Mr. Bell transferred. His brother was in the 124th and did the South Pacific with them. Only the 124th went to fight on the Driniumor River. The other two Div's. went to other areas. They were regrouped in Sept. 44 and landed on Morotai, then to the PI's in April of 45. The 155th was one of the three 31st Divs. and he could have transferred into it. I would suggest to the writer to contact St. Louis and ask for his fathers records or research his dad's ETO unit. I know this isn't much but its a sure bet Bell got out of the 31st and 124th early on.\n\nMarion Hess\n\nPresident of the 124th Inf. Regt'l. Assoc.\n\nThe amtrac \"Lulu Bell, B-23,\"\n\nCorporal Thomas (Tommy) Iradi\n\nMy dad, Corporal Thomas (Tom, Tommy) Iradi was with the 773rd Amphibious Tractor Battalion, and took the Marines to the beach on Saipan, Tinian, Okinawa, etc. He was on the second wave to hit Yellow Beach 20 minutes after zero hour on the initial invasion of Saipan. Later, he was the first amtrac to reach the Marines after/during the Banzai attack on 7 July. His tractor, named \"Lulu Bell, B-23,\" alone brought about 15 Marines to safety.\n\nHis outfit secured Tokashiki Shima just south of Okinawa where he tripped a booby trapped \"suicide\" boat. He lost his mustache, his helmet and his eyebrows! Minutes later the depth charges around the boat lit off and sent timbers thousands of feet in all directions! He was also in the Philippine campaign and the invasion of Okinawa. Also part of the occupation forces only weeks after the war ended.\n\nIt was interesting readng Col. Gertz's account of the chimney/tower spotter. My dad has relayed the very same story. If I'm not mistaken, he was on the same beach at the same time. I would love to get those two together on the phone sometime. Wouldn't THAT be something! When we were last in Saipan he told us of how he lay down on the beach picking through the pieces of shells as the mortars landed around him. \"\"What else could I do . . . My face was in the sand . . . so I picked through the shells,\" he said! . . . Amazing!\n\nWe found the beach where he landed. In fact it's now the site of the Pacific Island Club, a sort of Club Med arrangement where we stayed when we were there last. And where I think we will be staying in November.\n\nInteresting note . . . When they were building the club a backhoe or bulldozer hit a mortar round or something that sailed across the road and blew up with no apparent injuries! They're still finding ordnance all over that island. In fact they report that bones and skulls are still showing up through the sand on the beaches. We saw a few bones but it was hard to tell if they were animal or . . . otherwise. We saw the tank hung up on the coral . . . pretty strange to see jet skiers whipping around it on 21st century recreation machines . . . weird! While in Okinawa my son took a side trip with our guide and a few Marines to investigate some newly discovered caves and there were med packs and unused ammo still in there! And a grenade that they were careful not to disturb!\n\nMy Dad is 80 years old now and we are returning to Saipan in November (for our second trip in three years.) We want to find the beach where he retrieved the Marines on that day. We will be traveling with the Valor Tours group. I would like to get as much information about the Saipan campaign as it relates to my father's experiences as a history that we can pass down. Please, any information on the events of the Saipan campaign would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks to the Bill Hoover also for his info. Do you think it is possible that he was taken to the beach by the 773rd . . . possibly aboard Lulu Belle, B-23?\n\nPlease let me know what I have to do to contact others who may have been with him during this time. Thank you again . . . so very much. It's great to see the spark in the old soldier's eyes when he recounts his experiences. To me . . . it's priceless. God bless them all!\n\nThank you,\n\nThomas E. Iradi\n\nNote to readers: If you know anything about Corporal Iradi or the landings, please contact the editor.

I am a Japanese living in Tokyo.\n\nI am much fond of the U.S., and have been interested in American culture. So, I have frequently visited the U.S. Now, I have a plan to write a delightful and interesting book about the U.S. In this book, I want to introduce about \"Kilroy was here\" in one chapter. So, I have eagerly investigated about this item. However, for the life of me, I can't resolve an question. So, I want to ask you about this question.\n\nI am sure that you know \"Rosie The Riveter\" as a symbol of working female during World War in the U.S. Although many ideas about the identity of Kilroy have been presented, the most popular idea is that Kilroy was a riveter. I am surprised that symbolic American male and female during the World War had the same job. Is there any relationship between \"Kilroy Was Here\" and \"Rosie the riveter\"?\n\nI would very appreciate receiving your reply.\n\nResponse\n\nThank you Dr. Mukai, it is good to hear from you again!\n\nYour English is great and a lot better than my Japanese. As far as I know, there is no connection between Kilroy and Rosie. Actually, the most accepted legend of how Kilroy started was that he was an a inspector of riveting (See \"Legends\"). It is not too surprising that riveting comes up so often because everything from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Empire State building to thousands of ships were put together with rivets in those days. It was a dirty, hot, dangerous job that required a lot of upper body strength which probably explains why Rosie, doing a very tough \"man's job,\" became a symbol of women doing their bit for the war effort.\n\nI will put your question on Kilroy Was Here. Maybe some of my readers will have some more information that might be of some help.\n\nI am looking forward to your book. If Kilroy Was Here can be of further help, let me know.\n\nResponse 2\n\nMakio, Please see the new memorial to Rosie at http://www.rosietheriveter.org/\n\nWhat's the truth about . . . ?\n\nTokyo Rose\n\nBill Eudy wrote:\n\nAccording to Keith O'Brien in an article in the \"THE VOICE\" of the Retired Enlisted Association, a publication for the Total Force, August 2000 Tokyo Rose was \"The radio personality that never existed. They called her Tokyo Rose -- a temptress of the vilest kind . . . (who) never actually existed. She is a myth first spawned by US servicemen. \"\n\nA federal jury convicted her of treason and sentenced her to ten years in prison in 1949. According to O'Brien, In 1977, in his last official act as president,Gerald R. Ford pardoned her,ending the story but not the legend of TOKYO ROSE.\n\nWhat is the true story of Tokyo Rose?\n\nNote to readers: If you have any first hand knowledge about Tokyo Rose, please contact the editor. Click here or on the link at the bottom of the page!\n\nResponse\n\nBill, There is so much revisionist history going on these days . . . witness the current treatment of the dropping of the atomic bombs and the internment of Japanese and Japanese Americans. There is also so much misinformation on the internet that it is hard to determine the truth. The truth, however, is out there -- in the memories of the readers and contributors to Kilroy Was Here. Readers, tell us of your knowledge of Tokyo Rose!\n\nResponse from Quizlet\n\nBill, the results from of poll was:\n\n\"No, she never existed\" ................................. 4%\n\n\"No, I heard several female voices\" ................ 4%\n\n\"No, I never heard her at all\" ......................... 15%\n\n\"Yes, I heard her as Tokyo Rose ................... 78%\n\nSadly, I couldn't get the demographics of each respondent but I did get these responses:\n\nBill Hoover wrote: (See his story)\n\nI was aboard a LST docked at Pearl Harbor waiting for orders to combat. I was listening to the radio. A female voice said \". . . this is Tokyo Rose broadcasting to the Marines in the Pacific who are going out to die.\" She played a little stateside music, then said \" . . . a lot of you young men sitting there in Pearl Harbor will never leave Hawaii.\" The next morning,\n\na Japanese American welder aboard one of the LST's stuck his torch into a 50 gallon drum of gasoline. The result was, if my memory is correct, 3 or 4 LST's blown up and several hundred Marines and Sailors killed\n\nNote: Bill, may have remembered a bit of American propaganda or rumor. Here is more on the explosion from John. Click the star\n\nor wounded. It was kept quiet in the States, but was called \"the second Pearl Harbor Attack.\" I don't know if it was really Tokyo Rose, but someone sure as hell said they were, and had some pretty good information.\n\nSemper Fi\n\nNorman Gertz, Colonel USMC (Ret) wrote:(See his story-1) (See his story -2)\n\nReference the alleged myth of Tokyo Rose. I personally heard her broadcasts at least a dozen times. She referred to herself as \"Orphan Anne.\" I believe the Tokyo Rose name was created by her listeners. She often opened her broadcasts with \"Hello to all my boneheads in the Pacific\". As I recall, she would often identify the units (regiment or battalion) by name and make her comments directly to them. One of her favorite lines was \"Where do you think your wives or girlfriends are tonight while you are in a foxhole?\" She tried to emulate a disk jockey routine by allegedly playing music requests. She often played Glenn Miller and other big band music. She would often referred to casualties by name and unit. I have no idea whether that information was valid. We took what she said very lightly considering what she was trying to do.\n\nWhatever her name, she existed and somehow was able to play all the latest popular music.\n\nDo you know . . . ?\n\nRobert Hudgins\n\nI would like to locate any relative or any fiiend of ROBERT HUDGINS (maybe Hutchins) who was a Marine Corps officer (Major?) in the SW Pacific Theater in WWII. I do not know if he survived the war, but do know that he married an Australian girl named Fay(e) who came to the US in the spring of 1944. Please contact me if you know anything at all about him.\n\nJames\n\nNote to readers: If you know or knew this veteran, please contact the editor. Click here or on the link at the bottom of the page!\n\nResponse\n\nHi Pat . . . Don't know if this is the guy or not . . . we had a Major Harry Hutchins in the 4th Marine Division. He was the Division Naval Gunfire Officer. He was a very distinctive individual . . . spoke with a British accent I thought. (could have been Australian) He was known as \"Half Track Harry\" as he operated from a halftrack vehicle with a BC610 radio (very powerful). I don't remember seeing him after Saipan/Tinian. I have no recollection of him on Iwo Jima so he could have been transferred. His unit would have been Headquarters Battalion, 4th Marine Division.\n\nThe 4th Marine Division has a reunion scheduled for the end of August in Washington,DC and there would probably be people there who would remember him. Its at the Marriott, Pennsylvania Ave. & 14th Street.\n\nHope this information is of some help.\n\nNorman Gertz, Colonel USMC (Ret)\n\nResponse\n\nHi Pat.......with regard to the search for \" Hudgins\"........in this month's Semper Fidelis memorandum for Retired Marines there is a listing under \"Taps\" showing:\n\nHUDGINS, Johnnie H. Sergeant, retired September '54, died April '00\n\nHope it helps.\n\nNorman Gertz, Colonel USMC (Ret)\n\nDo you know...?\n\nCecil G. Mercer\n\n2/9/00\n\nThis month will be the 55th Anniversary of the invasion of IWO JIMA. My Father participated in the invasion force. He was in the Army, Battery D-506th AAA Gun Battalion. His MOS.-2601 Fuse-setter Service Number-34014286. His rank T-5 and 36 years old. He stayed on the island till September of 1945 He received the Bronze star and good conduct medal. He retired from the Army after 22 years. 9 Months and 15 days as an SFC. The story he related to my grandfather and family....\n\nOne day a gaggle of P-38s arrived, the island not secured, the pilots were informed to post a watch during the night. Being tired, they fell asleep without posting the guard. The next day, they were all found with their throats cut. I'm sure there are more horrible stories than that, as 4300 GIs were killed in the first 26 days of fighting. 2-19-45 3-16-45. My Father was T-5 CECIL G. MERCER. If anyone knew him, I would like to learn more about my Dad and his company. We never lived together and now he is deceased.\n\nWalter Cecil Mercer.\n\nNote to readers: If you knew this veteran, please contact the editor. Click here or on the link at the bottom of the page!\n\nFOUND!\n\nPat Merris wrote\n\nMy name is Pat Merris and today, 11/19/05, I visited my dad who was on Iwo Jima in '45 to get info on his time there for a story I want to write of his WW2 experiences. On Oct 15, 1945 he was on a C-47 flying from Iwo to Saipan that crashed and he was one of five survivors out of 17 and spent 36 hours in the water before rescue. He had told me a story of a group of pilot's killed in their tent not far from his. He was with the 20th AAF and worked on P-38's. When I got home, I was doing research and came onto your site. I read all of the search requests and came on the Mercer letter. I know the incidents are the same. He told me how just to get water you went with a 5-man team because the Japanese would come in to steal water and rations. I would be glad to pass on any other info to the Mercer family. Great site!\n\nP.S. I have eight brothers and two sisters and we were all in the military. With the years my dad spent in WW2 we have a combined total of 105 years military service. Five of us are Vietnam era vets.\n\nResponse\n\nPat, sadly Butch's (Walter C. Mercer) address has changed and he hasn't kept me up to date. I will put your letter in as a \"Found.\" Maybe he will respond.\n\nBy the way, thank your Dad for me and thanks to your whole family for your services to our country!

He was my uncle and was killed in the invasion of the New Georgia Islands in 1943.\n\nI have obtained, and read, the official Marine Corps version of his death which differs from what the family was told at the time.\n\nHe Enlisted in the US MARINE CORPS 16 June 1937 in Washington, D.C.

He was discharged 22 July 1941.\n\nAfter World War II was declared he re-enlisted 9 February 1942 and was assigned to the Amphibian Tractor Battalion at Dunedin, Florida. He was later transferred to New River, North Carolina and then sent to San Diego, California. He later sailed from San Diego on the SS Lurline on 18 April 1943.\n\n4 July 1943 his official Marine Corps record states \"emb. Abd. USS McCalla at Guadalcanal, SI and sailed therefrom. 5 Jul 43 landed on enemy territory New Georgia BSI.\"\n\nHe was in the First Marine Raider Battalion, First Marine Raider Regiment. His official records list a conflict regarding his date of death. One states 9 July 1943, killed in action at Enogai Point, New Georgia, BSI. However, his death certificate furnished by the Marines states he was injured 9 July 1943; and lists his date and time of death as 0630 hours, 10 July 1943. It further states \"sustained injury in action against an organized enemy, from enemy sniper fire. Principal cause of death: fracture compound, femur, left.\"\n\nHis death has raised many questions in the family. The official cause of death does not agree with what the family was told at the time. As noted above, two different dates were given for his death.\n\nIs there anyone who has first hand knowledge of this battle and who, perhaps, knew this Marine?\n\nAny information you can give on this would be greatly appreciated by the family.\n\nI would appreciate any first-hand information that anyone may have.\n\nJean Maurer"
