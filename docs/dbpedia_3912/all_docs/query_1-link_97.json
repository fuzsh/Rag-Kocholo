Abroad, renewal of the Iran nuclear deal seemed doubtful and tensions remain high between Iran, Israel, and Arab states. Many Iranians have lost hope of a better future, and the country seems at a crossroads. How should the United States deal with this? View slides from the presentation here: Daoud Iran at a Crossroads.\n\nFeb. 11: China and the United States - Dr. Min Ye, Professor, Department of Political Science, Coastal Carolina University\n\nFor a decade, the United States and China have been in competition for the greatest global influencer. A major point of contention is the status of Taiwanese sovereignty, now even more relevant with the possibility that the Ukraine invasion may prompt China to take similar action with Taiwan. How will the United States engage a China which is increasingly seeking to expand its sphere of influence? View slides from the presentation here: Ye US-China Relations.\n\nFeb. 18: Politics in Latin America – Dr. Rick Kilroy, Professor, Department of Political Science, Coastal Carolina University\n\nElectoral results in Latin America over the past four years have led many observers of the regional/political scene to discern a left-wing surge in the hemisphere, reminiscent of the so-called “Pink Tide” that swept the area some 20 years ago. But how much do these politicians actually have in common? What implication does their ascendency have for the region? View slides from the presentation here: KIlroy Latin America Politics.\n\nFeb. 25: War Crimes - Professor Thomas Nachbar, University of Virginia Law School and US Army Judge Advocate General School\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in widespread charges of war crimes and calls for justice. But what exactly are war crimes? Opinions of what constitutes a war crime have evolved, as have ways to identify and punish the perpetrators. How will the war crimes committed in Ukraine be handled? View slides from the presentation here: Nachbar - War Crimes.\n\nGreat Decisions 2022\n\nThe Dyer Institute for Leadership and Public Policy, the Department of Politics, the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, and the Center for Global Engagement at Coastal Carolina University host the Great Decisions in Foreign Policy Lecture program.

What are the roots and the bureaucratic logic behind today's dominant drug policies in Latin America? Is it time to reconsider punitive drug policies that disrupt supply chains and punish drug possession?\n\nClick Here to see the recorded program.\n\nFeb. 12: Climate Change - Pam Martin, Ph.D., professor, Department of Political Science and Honors College Fellow, Coastal Carolina University\n\nand Tom Mullikin, the SC Floodwater Commissioner.\n\nThe ideological divide in the United States on the subject of climate chan ge has impeded progress in curbing greenhouse emissions. But extreme weather e vents at both ends of the thermometer have focused attention on the consequences of inaction. What role will the United States play in future negotiations on climate?\n\nClick Here to see the recorded program.\n\nFeb. 19: The Quad Alliance – Jordan Roberts, Ph.D., assistant professor, Department of Intelligence and Security Studies, Coastal Carolina University\n\nAs part of the U.S. pivot to Asia, the United States has been in dialogue with Japan, Australia, and India in an effort to contain China. Recently, the Quad countries held joint naval exercises in the South Pacific. How effective will the actions of this alliance be?\n\nClick Here to see the recorded program.\n\nFeb. 26: Outer Space - Maj. Gen. Leah Lauderback, director of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Headquarters U.S. Space Force\n\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957 marked the beginning of the space era and of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. In the 21st century, there are many more participants in space, including countries such as India and China and commercial companies such as SpaceX. How will the United States fare in a crowded outer space?\n\n2021 Lecture Series\n\nFeb. 6: Arctic Security – Dr. , Coastal Carolina University\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump left many scratching their heads when it was rumored that he was looking to purchase the large island nation of Greenland from Denmark. While any potential deal seems highly unlikely, the event shows the changing opinion within the U.S. government toward engagement with the Arctic region. Because of climate change, large sheets of arctic ice are melting, exposing vast stores of natural gas and oil. With Russia and China already miles ahead with their Arctic strategies, can the U.S. catch up?\n\nClick Here to see the recorded program.\n\nFeb. 13: The Korean Peninsula – Ms. Soo Kim, Rand Corporation\n\nThe Korean Peninsula is facing a defining era. Attempts by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump to repair the rift between North and South have lost any momentum as Pyongyang continues to test long-range missiles for its nuclear weapons program. As the rift between the U.S. and China grows further, South Korea may end up in the middle of the two superpowers. What does the future hold for the U.S. relationship with the ROK?\n\nClick Here to see the recorded program.\n\nFeb. 20: Global Supply Chain and National Security – Dr. Michael Murphree, USC\n\nThe shutdown of global supply chains due to the Covid-19 pandemic brought to the fore an issue with the high level of global economic interdependence: what happens when one country is the main source for an item, say face masks, and then can no longer supply the item? Countries suddenly unable to meet the demand for certain supplies are faced with growing calls for economic nationalism. What are some of the lasting effects that the pandemic could have on global supply chains and trade? How would this affect national security?\n\nClick Here to see the recorded program.\n\n27: China and Africa – Dr. , Coastal Carolina University\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis has put a massive strain on what was growing a positive economic and political relationship between China and the continent of Africa. As Chinese President Xi Jinping’s centerpiece “Belt and Road initiative” continues to expand Chinese power, the response to the spread of Covid-19, as well as the African government’s growing debt to China, has seen pushback. What are some of the growing economic and political issues between China and Africa?\n\n2020 Lecture Series\n\nFeb. 1: Red Sea Security - Ambassador David Shinn, George Washington University\n\nThe Red Sea has remained vital for global trade since the time of ancient Egypt. Once home to the spice trade, the Red Sea now sees millions of barrels of oil a day transported across its waters. With major nations like China, France, Italy, and the U.S. building large ports and bases in the region, what does the future of the region look like? How important is Red Sea security for global security? Can the region be a place of global cooperation?\n\nFeb. 8: India and Pakistan – Ms. Elizabeth Threlkeld, Stimson Center, Washington, D.C.\n\nIndia’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi rode a wave of Hindu nationalism to a historic reelection in 2019. His first order of business was to revoke the special status granted to the Kashmir region, inflaming the rivalry between India and Pakistan. How will the Kashmir situation affect the region, both economically and politically?\n\nClick Here to see the recorded program.\n\nFeb. 15: Artificial Intelligence and Data - Dr. Paul Cerkez, CCU Department of Computer Science\n\nPolicymakers in many countries are developing plans and funding research in artificial intelligence (AI). Global growth is slowing, and not surprisingly, many policymakers hope that AI will provide a magic solution. The EU, Brazil, and other Western countries have adopted regulations that grant users greater control over their data and require that firms using AI be transparent about how they use it. Will the U.S. follow suit?\n\nClick Here to see the recorded program.\n\nFeb. 22: Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking - Ms. Elhem Daadaa, Fulbright Language Teaching Assistant from Tunisia\n\nAlmost every nation has enacted laws criminalizing human trafficking, and international organizations, governments, and NGOs sponsor a large variety of projects to curb trafficking and slavery. Billions of dollars have been allocated to these efforts. What is the international community doing to combat slavery and trafficking? What are the experiences like for those being trafficked?\n\nClick Here to see the recorded program.\n\nCompanion reader: Companion reader textbooks are published by the Foreign Policy Association and may be purchased online.

These antique numbers mangle understanding of the U.S.-China trade relationship, shrinking America’s true economic size and competitiveness, while swelling China’s. Bad numbers give rise to bad policies that ultimately kill U.S. jobs and cede market share to China. What other tools can the United States employ to counter China’s unfair trade practices? There are several available, yet they remain mostly unused.

Russia has been accused of interfering in the 2016 presidential elections in the United States, and China is highly committed to using cyberspace as a tool of national policy. Dealing with cyber conflict will require new ways of looking at 21st century warfare. Is the United States prepared to respond to such threats?

Many positions in the State Department have never been filled, and meetings with foreign leaders such as Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin have been undertaken with little advance planning. What effect are these changes having now, and how will they affect ongoing relationships between the United States and its allies and adversaries?

Of all NATO allies, Turkey represents the most daunting challenge for the Trump administration. In the wake of a failed military coup in July 2016, the autocratic trend in Ankara took a turn for the worse. One year on, an overwhelming majority of the population considers the United States to be their country’s greatest security threat. In this age of a worsening “clash of civilizations” between Islam and the West, even more important than its place on the map is what Turkey symbolically represents as the most institutionally westernized Muslim country in the world. CCU welcomes Nora Fisher-Onar, an assistant professor in global politics at Coastal Carolina University, to address this topic.\n\nUS Global Engagement and the Military\n\nGreat Decisions \"US Global Engagement and the Military\"\n\nThe global power balance is rapidly evolving, leaving the United States at a turning point with respect to its level of engagement and the role of its military. Some argue for an “America first” paradigm, with a large military to ensure security, while others call for a more assertive posture overseas. Some advocate for a restoration of American multilateral leadership and a strengthened role for diplomacy. Still others envision a restrained U.S. role, involving a more limited military. How does the military function in today’s international order, and how might it be balanced with diplomatic and foreign assistance capabilities?

State and non-state actors today must maneuver a complex and rapidly evolving media landscape. Conventional journalism now competes with user-generated content. Official channels of communication can be circumvented through social media. Foreign policy is tweeted from the White House, and “fake news” has entered the zeitgeist. Cyberwarfare, hacking and misinformation pose complex security threats. How are actors using media to pursue and defend their interests in the international arena? What are the implications for U.S. policy? CCU welcomes Misti Williams, a lecturer of political communication in the Department of Communication, Media and Culture at Coastal Carolina University, to address this topic.\n\nGlobal Health: Progress and Challenges\n\nGreat Decisions \"Global Health: Progress and Challenges\"\n\nThe collective action of countries, communities and organizations over the last 30 years has literally saved millions of lives around the world. Yet terrible inequalities in health and well-being persist. The world now faces a mix of old and new health challenges, including the preventable deaths of mothers and children, continuing epidemics of infectious diseases, and rising rates of chronic disease. We also remain vulnerable to the emergence of new and deadly pandemics. For these reasons, the next several decades will be just as important—if not more so—than the last in determining well-being across nations. CCU welcomes Fredanna M'Cormack McGough, chair of the Department of Health Sciences and associate professor of public health at Coastal Carolina University, to address this topic.\n\n2017 Lecture Series\n\nThe Future of Europe\n\nGreat Decisions \"Future of Europe\"\n\nA public lecture on “The Future of Europe” was presented on Saturday, Feb. 4, 2017 at 10 a.m. at the Myrtle Beach Education Center.
