Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easy when you have a lot of caches to log in finding the cache and is understandable....I do it myself sometimes.\n\nThe more feed back you provide the more likely hiders will strive to provide quality caches. Please keep this in mind when entering your log. I certainly enjoy reading your comments and is a positive reinforcement to provide different kinds of hides Thanks for your ear."
