        "text": "T he 70th anniversary of the end of World War II will be celebrated in August and September. WWII began in 1939; but the United States did not enter the war until Japan attacked the U.S. naval fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Sunday morning, Dec. 7, 1941.\n\nThis attack began the largest combined effort of teamwork throughout the history of the United States. This teamwork led to the end of the war when Japanese Emperor Hirohito surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945 (the date in Japan); and U.S. President Harry Truman announced Japan’s surrender on Aug. 14 (the date in the USA due to time zone differences). Japan officially surrendered on Sept. 2, 1945, on board the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. All three dates are known as V-J Day or Victory over Japan Day.\n\nVictory was possible with U.S. military personnel and citizens of all ages on the homefront joining forces to battle the enemy. Men, women, and children worked for the war effort on the homefront. As men went to war, women entered the work force. Children helped with scrap metal drives and victory gardens where vegetables were grown and shared by the community. Recycling was important since there were shortages of everyday items as well as major appliances, because factories changed regular production to wartime efforts. Ration coupons were needed to buy gasoline, sugar, coffee, meat, canned food, clothes and shoes.\n\nDuring the war, “V” for victory was seen on a variety of items; such as, jewelry, buttons, milk bottles, advertisements, etc. The radio was important for war news since televisions were not yet household items. Theater movies had war themes. Bob Hope and the USO entertained the troops. Secrecy was important in letters to and from the homefront and military.\n\nService flags were displayed in home windows with blue stars to represent living sons and daughters serving in the military, and gold stars represented those who lost their lives. Gold Star Mother’s Day is observed the last Sunday in September.\n\nNose art on warplanes and pin-up girl photographs were popular during World War I and II. “Kilroy was here” graffiti was popular during WWII and the Korean War. The famous Life Magazine photograph from August 14, 1945, of the sailor and the lady in white kissing in Times Square to celebrate the end of WWII is still popular today.\n\nAs a member of the “baby boomer” generation, I was born after WWII; but I grew up hearing wartime stories from my parents. Daddy left his home in Bemis, Tennessee to serve in the US Coast Guard. Mother rode a train from Luray to Jackson, Tennessee to West Palm Beach, Florida to marry Daddy in October 1943. For me, stories about “the war” were a sad time but also a romantic time due to my parents’ young love and marriage.\n\nSome jobs on the homefront were dangerous. Obviously, ammunition was needed to fight the enemy. Many ordnance plants were built throughout the USA. Wolf Creek Ordnance Plant was constructed in West Tennessee in 1941 to provide ammunition to England during World War II. Then, the USA entered the war; and Wolf Creek Ordnance Plant became an important supplier to the US military.\n\nThis facility was located in Milan on the Gibson County and Carroll County line and was operated by Procter & Gamble Defense Corporation. The US Military operated Milan Ordnance Depot at the same location. The two facilities combined later and became the Milan Ordnance Plant. The facility was also known as Milan Army Ammunition Plant and Milan Arsenal.\n\nMany sacrifices were made during the war by citizens on the homefront, and 14 civilian employees at the Wolf Creek Ordnance Plant in Milan made the ultimate sacrifice in five separate accidents during WWII. These accidents occurred on June 30, 1941; July 31, 1941; Feb. 13, 1942; March 2, 1944; and Aug. 9, 1945.\n\nOn June 30, 1941, Richard Ernest Milner died in the first fatal accident at Wolf Creek Ordnance Plant. He was a single man, 28, from Tyler County, Texas.\n\nOn July 31, 1941, Lewis Green Cantrell was injured while working on heavy equipment as a mechanic helper for Ferguson-Oman Co. at WCOP, and he died Aug. 4 in Clemmer Clinic in Milan. He was a 30-year-old from DeKalb County.\n\nOn Feb. 13, 1942, at 12:05 p.m., Solomon Rufus Haney of Scotts Hill was crushed between a truck and a building as the driver backed up to get a load of ammunition. Sol was my paternal grandfather’s brother. One of Sol’s sons was on the USS Missouri at the time of Japan’s surrender.\n\nOn Thursday, March 2, 1944, four civilian employees of P&G Defense Corporation were killed and 18 injured at the WCOP due to an explosion on line K. The men killed were Walton Eldridge Abernathy of Huntingdon; Johnnie McWhirter Blackmon of Medina; Aaron Thomas Blankenship of Medina; and Theotis “Pud” Davenport of Milan.\n\nTheotis Davenport was scheduled to report to the U.S. Army in less than two weeks. His foreman moved him from second to first shift to allow more time with his family.\n\nOn Aug. 9, 1945, many people lost their lives due to the conflicts of World War II. On this date, U.S. airmen dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. Thousands died from this bomb and from the bomb that was dropped three days earlier on Hiroshima, Japan. Also, on August 9 in the town of Milan, TN a shell exploded on ammunition loading line C at 1:20 p.m. at WCOP. Seven men lost their lives and thirteen people were injured. They were civilian employees of P&G Defense Corporation.\n\nWilliam Emerson Maness of Jackson, John Dee “Penn” Gorman of Alamo, Floyd “Joe Billy” Mitchell of Bradford, Edward Andrew “Edd” Voorhies of Trenton, and Frank McCree Johnson of McLemoresville died on Aug. 9 in Gibson County and Carroll County. R. V. Johnson of Lexington died from his injuries on August 10 in Henderson County. Frank Victor Bedwell of Lexington died from his injuries on August 13 in Gibson County.\n\nWilliam Maness was my maternal grandfather. I only know him from his portrait that hung on my grandmother’s wall and from the stories told by my grandmother, my mother, and my uncles. My mother described him as a kind man and a hard worker with blue eyes and dark, wavy hair. She said that at the time of his death he was planning to work two more weeks at the Arsenal and then leave to farm full time since some employees were being too careless at the plant. He said that reject bombs were being re-worked on the production line.\n\nDr. Robert L. “Bob” Stump Jr. was the Chief Medical Officer of the Milan Ordnance Center as a civilian employee of P&G in Milan when the Aug. 9 accident occurred. His name is listed as the physician’s signature on the death certificates for the men who died Aug. 9-13, 1945. Dr. Stump currently lives in Valdosta, Georgia where he celebrated his 100th birthday on Feb. 13.\n\nIn a phone interview on March 13, 2013, Dr. Stump explained that production line C produced cluster bombs. A cluster bomb was one large case which held 250 small bombs. Employees would pack a bomb and latch it closed.\n\nThe plant and the hospital on the property were shut down when the armistice was signed. Everyone was sent home and told to return two days later. Employees began being laid off.\n\nAs the world rejoiced that the war had ended, widows from the Milan Arsenal accidents were left to find jobs, learn to drive or find transportation, find care for their young children, and continue the best they could. Young children of the victims no longer have memories of their fathers or they only remember the tragic accidents and funerals that were quickly held.\n\nMay we always remember the sacrifices of the brave men, women, and children who worked on the homefront during World War II.\n\nMore details are available on each of the deceased in the July 2015 “Family Findings” quarterly published by Mid-West Tennessee Genealogical Society.\n\nThank you to my mother and my uncle, Rachel Maness Haney and Gilbert Ray “Gil” Maness, for encouraging me to write this article. Research included researching death certificates and newspapers, interviewing relatives, and searching memorials on FindAGrave.com.
