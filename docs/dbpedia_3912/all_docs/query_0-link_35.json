        "text": "Street art has a fascinating history. There are times that it has been illegal and cities have worked hard to clean it up, and there are times that it has been commissioned and cities have paid massive sums of money to have more work added to their streets. So, how could this form of visual art exist on two completely different sides of the legal and social spectrum? We are going to take a deep dive into the history of street art to answer that exact question.\n\nLet’s start with the absolute basics before we weave through the colorful past of graffiti and street art.\n\nThe History of Street Art\n\nLike we mentioned above, street art has a crazy history. From artwork on the side of caves to the police of New York City chasing down taggers in the subway system to city-sponsored public art funds to pay for new murals, there’s a lot to cover. Here we will briefly cover some of the major moments in the history of street art to give you a deeper understanding of how the art has evolved.\n\nTo begin, we have to go WAY back.\n\nThe Stone Age and Cueva de las Manos\n\nStreet art isn’t an invention of the 20th century. One of the oldest pieces of wall art is located inside of a cave in Santa Cruz, Argentina and it’s called Cueva de las Manos. It dates back to 7000 BC or possibly earlier. Nothing is known for sure about the meaning behind these paintings, but it’s believed it was religious or ceremonial.\n\nThis is just one example of art painted on walls inside and outside of caves from the Stone Age. It has been uncovered on multiple continents and helped historians learn more about the ways of life.\n\nWhile today’s street art is very different from the cave paintings of thousands of years ago, it’s important to recognize that the desire to use walls and shared spaces as a canvas to create art isn’t a new invention in the 1900’s. It’s been happening as long as humans have been around as a way to document, communicate, and express ourselves.\n\nEarly Roman and Greek Cities\n\nLet’s jump ahead a few thousands years to the ancient empires in Europe. There are some incredible examples of street art in ancient Roman and Greek cities that are still able to be viewed today.\n\nFor example, there is some wall art in the ancient Greek city of Ephesus (located in Turkey) that appears to have been advertising a brothel in the city. It includes a hand, a foot, and a number.\n\nPompeii is another place with multiple images depicting themes of politics, sex, and religion. Also in Italy, there is a mural in Rome created around 200 AD and is thought to be one of the first images of Jesus Christ. Depicted with a man’s body and a donkey’s head, it’s believed to be a mockery of religion. The city of Bologna also clearly has Roman-era graffiti in Latin sprawled across the ceilings and floors of some of its many porticos. Using street art as a form of protest and expression has been around for thousands of years!\n\nKilroy\n\nFast forward to World War II, a small character starting showing up in many of the places American service members were stationed and on war ships. Kilroy is a character with a bald head with just a few hairs hanging his nose over a wall and has the words “Kilroy was here” written underneath him. It’s simple and small, but has become extremely familiar to many. Sometimes, the doodle was hid in hard to spot places and other times, it was made a bit more obvious. It was even rumored that Hitler spotted the doodles and was concerned about this possible “super spy” and ordered German soldiers to track him down.\n\nThere is some mystery about the origin; however, the predominant theory is that soldiers began duplicating it, allowing it to easily spread across Europe. There were Australian and British characters that some think inspired Kilroy. After the Second World War, a story came out about a Massachusetts man who worked on warships and used the doodle to mark the rivets he worked on.\n\nKilroy continued to spread as graffiti throughout the world during the Korean and Vietnam Wars and even recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s one of the first contemporary pieces of street art that was recognizable on a large scale.\n\nInvention of the Aerosol Spray Can\n\nThe invention of the aerosol spray can in the early 1900’s was definitely an important event in the history of street art. It started as a way to apply insecticides and deodorizers, but paint wasn’t too far behind. In 1949, Edward Seymour started putting paint in spray cans and changed the game. The very first color was aluminum because he created it to spray radiator parts. Being able to spray paint instead of using a brush or a smaller tool made it easier to paint textured surfaces and create larger works of art with less work.\n\nCornbread and Taki 183\n\nThere is some debate on exactly where modern graffiti started, but most agree it was popularized in either Philadelphia or New York City. It seems to have started around the same time with similar intentions in both cities and really started to increase in prevalence in the late 1960s and ’70s.\n\nIn the mid-1960s in Philadelphia, a 12-year-old named Daryl McCray started tagging his nickname, Cornbread, which he earned because of his love for his grandma’s cornbread. At the time, he lived at the Philadelphia Youth Development Center and to avoid the violence and drugs that many of the other kids engaged in, he started tagging his name with his friends all over the center. Once released, he continued and tagged walls all over North Philly. One of the craziest places he managed to add his message was on the side of an actual elephant at the Philadelphia Zoo. This stunt landed him in jail, but also helped make him an icon for years to come.\n\nMeanwhile, in New York City, there was a similar movement happening where tags were popping up all over neighborhoods. One name that many people recognize as one of the first that made the rounds was Taki 183. The name came from a version of the young man’s name and street number. He said he was inspired by another neighborhood kid who did the same. He was a bike messenger and brought a spray can and markers up and down the island of Manhattan adding his tag to as many places as he could. He has since talked about that time in interviews and said that he just couldn’t get enough and loved to see his name on every single light pole he rode by. He was one of the first who tagged nonstop and really covered a lot of ground with the same message.\n\nThese are just two names out of many of the original pioneers of the street art movement that helped turn it into what it is today.\n\nActivism and Chicano Murals\n\nWhile taggers were spreading their names all over the East Coast, there was another colorful movement happening throughout the Southwest corner of the United States. Chicano neighborhoods were seeing more and more murals on public places within their communities that helped spread messages about civil rights. Used as a form of protest, the murals represented an obvious message and with the bright colors, they were hard to ignore.\n\nChicano street art pulls a lot of inspiration from their Mexican heritage, culture, religion, and common struggles faced by members of the community. These murals were found in many immigrant neighborhoods in the 1970s. It’s impossible to ignore the impact these colorful murals had on the street art movement around the country.\n\nOne of the best places to go today to find beautiful Chicano street art is the Pilsen neighborhood in Chicago. Home to the National Museum of Mexican Art, Pilsen is covered in gorgeous murals that carry positive messages. If you get the chance, don’t miss out on the incredible street art being created in Chicago neighborhoods!\n\nVandalism, Subway Cars and Broken Window Theory\n\nOnce the 1980s rolled around, some of the larger cities began trying to figure out how to deal with increases in crime in the urban centers. The Broken Window Theory, first introduced in 1982, became a popular speaking point with mayors and police chiefs in places like New York. The theory states that any areas with signs of crime and disorder, such as vandalism (like a broken window), encourage additional and more serious crimes.\n\nPolice forces began targeting some of the smaller crimes in an attempt to reduce the more serious offenses from happening. During this time is when cities like NYC started to implement controversial “stop and frisk” policies. Public figures like the mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, believed that if they could crackdown on the small offenses like graffiti and jaywalking, it would help lower the overall crime rates in their cities. These policing efforts combined with programs designed to “clean up the city,” like the MTA’s Clean Car Program in 1984, make it easy to see why street art received such a negative reputation for so many years.\n\nThis pressure from law enforcement didn’t stop artists from evolving and getting their work out there. It just increased the number of arrests for vandalism, as well as forcing more and more artists to work in the middle of the night to avoid being caught.\n\nDuring this same time, more and more cities around the globe were developing their own underground street art scenes. It was an art form closely tied with punk and hip-hop movements and seen as a type of subculture. The style of lettering and graphics transformed as artists learned from each other and evolved their techniques. More neon and bright colors were used and letters took on more of a three-dimensional look. There was still a continued theme of resistance and protest, but works became more abstract and included more images.\n\nKeith Haring, Banksy, and the Modern Street Art Movement\n\nA big shift happened in the late 1990s and early 2000s as street art moved away from being considered property damage and vandalism and started being embraced by the public.\n\nFor many, the stencil-like cartoon characters of Keith Haring are immediately recognizable. What most don’t realize is that Haring was instrumental in bridging the gap between street art and the public, helping to change the perception of the art form and bring it into public favor. His work with government programs and fundraising for the AIDS epidemic helped more people recognize the potential that street art has to generate real change. Along with Haring, other artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat took commissions to cover the sides of buildings and add some color to urban spaces. Once street artwork began being commissioned by wealthy property owners, it wasn’t long before you could find famous street artists’ work in galleries across the world.\n\nFast forward a decade or two and artists like Banksy are captivating the world. A British artist that has rocketed to global fame and decorated walls in cities all over the world, Banksy’s style is simple, yet poignant, which is why it’s so wildly popular.\n\nAs a teenager, Banksy covered trains and walls near his home, but quickly learned that he needed to speed up his process because he was constantly running from the police. He created his first stencil and realized how beneficial that was to his work. He moved to London around 1999 and retreated into the shadows, not letting people know his real identity. The anonymity celebrates the history of street art as mysterious while also bringing a lot of positive attention to the craft.\n\nColorful Walls All Over\n\nNow, we are able to enjoy street art in every major urban area in the world as well as small towns and there’s even a movement to decorate the sides of grain silos on farmland. Cities that used to arrest taggers are now hosting huge art festivals to bring artists to neighborhoods in the city and paint live for people to enjoy.\n\nIndustrial neighborhoods are transitioning into hotspots for breweries, new loft apartments, and galleries and those transitions bring more and more spaces that are screaming for some art.\n\nJust because street art is a mainstream art form now doesn’t mean it’s lost the origins. It is still used for protest and resistance messages and helps bring attention to socio-political causes. During the summer of 2020, there were hundreds of new portraits of George Floyd painted within the months after he died at the hands of the police. It will continue to be a source of expression for so many people, but instead of having to create the artwork in the wee hours of the morning under bridges and overpasses – artists are invited and celebrated for the beautiful pieces they add to the urban landscape.\n\nWhat does the Future of Street Art Look Like?\n\nMany cities in the United States have developed public art programs for their communities because studies have shown that art in the community is crucial for development and identity. Cities like Denver and San Francisco require a percentage of all construction projects over a million dollars to go to public art installations to ensure that there is a never-ending flow of new experiences. Most cities offer grants to artists and organizations to encourage involvement in the public art space.\n\nThe internet and social media have also played a huge role in changing the street art world. You can follow specific street artists now and see what they are working on even if they are on the other side of the globe. Geotags allow people to easily locate certain art pieces with just one click making them easier to find. Let’s Roam offers walking tours that give you everything you need to find street art and learn a little more about the city you are exploring. The options are endless!\n\nWhere to Find Street Art Today\n\nYou can locate street art almost anywhere these days, but there are still a few urban cities that rank high on the list of the best.\n\nParis\n\nThe Montmartre neighborhood is famous for its hilltop cathedral and its street art. With many of the most famous artists in the Louvre calling that neighborhood home during their lifetime, it makes sense that current artists would be inspired to create there as well. Banksy did a famous piece about international refugees there and he’s not the only global artist to add to the artwork.\n\nLos Angeles\n\nInfluenced by international artists as well as styles from the Latino gang tags of the past, Los Angeles has no shortage of street art installations. Graffiti artists still tag while looking over a shoulder today while adding their touch to the colorful walls downtown and near the beaches. The Downtown LA Art District is one of the best places to check out the scene.\n\nMelbourne\n\nExplore the alleyways of Melbourne in Southern Australia for an explosion of color around each corner. Called the “graffiti laneways”, you can spend hours just winding through the narrow passageways taking in the art that is constantly changing. Hoiser Lane is the most famous, but it’s easy to find others that are a little less traveled and there is no shortage of quirky dive bars and food spots if you need a break.\n\nBerlin\n\nIf you visit Berlin, you’ll probably already have the Berlin Wall on your list of attractions. Some of the art is dating back decades and tells a colorful story about a dark time in Germany’s history. Aside from the famous wall, there are tons of areas in Berlin that you can find incredible, modern street art including stencil art (like Banksy’s popular pieces) and other graffiti art.\n\nMiami\n\nMiami is a city with plenty of different cultural influences which makes the art scene there quite unique. With plenty of Latin American immigrants and culture, you’ll see some of the same types of subject matter as the Chicano murals. Wynwood is a neighborhood where many of the city walls are splashed with color and it has become a destination for many visitors. There are many public places decorated with colorful pieces that seem to fit in perfectly with the backdrop of palm trees and the ocean.\n\nNew York City\n\nMany would claim this to be the birthplace of modern street art. There is definitely no shortage of places to find it. Stroll the Highline Park and see a unique view of the New York City streets paired with a collection of incredible street art and public art installations like nothing else in the world. Walk through Little Italy and SoHo looking for pop art on every corner. Neighborhoods throughout the five Burroughs have different styles and feels, so it’s easy to see why NYC is one of the best places in the world to find street art now. You can even tour old subway trains at the Transit Museum and see if you can find any with graffiti dating back to the 1970s.\n\nWhile art galleries and museums will always be available and showcase beautiful masterpieces, street art has opened up a more accessible viewing platform that can be enjoyed by everyone at any time of day, on any day of the year. Like anything else, it will continue to transform and evolve, but it’s not slowing down anytime soon. Get out and enjoy it!"
