        "text": "We are going to talk about three incredible European queens — all named Matilda! Now, don’t worry, I’ll try to make this as clear as possible. The Medieval period was full of people who had very similar names, but their different titles help us figure out who is who. There also aren’t many artifacts or pictures of these three Matildas — likely due to their very conflict-filled lives. The images you will see are the best I could find in representing them, though many come from artists of the Victorian period or modern times.\n\nThe other interesting tidbit is that all three Matildas were, in some way, related to one another. Now, you may be thinking “no big deal — most royals were probably related.” And in some cases, you are right — the family trees during this period were huge. But luckily, in this case, the relationships are clear — and quite interesting. Because at some point in each of their lives, these three Matildas were queens of England — all within a 200 year time span.\n\nThe three Matildas that I’d like to introduce you to are Matilda of Flanders, Matilda of Boulogne (a.k.a. Edith), and the Empress Matilda (a.k.a. Maude).\n\nMatilda of Flanders, 1031–1083\n\nThe first, Matilda of Flanders, was born in 1031. She was the daughter of the Count of Flanders and his French wife, and her bloodlines made her connected to many famous royal families of Europe — including being a descendant of Charlemagne (a very famous Medieval king).\n\nMatilda of Flanders was extremely well-educated for her day and also very beautiful — with refined, delicate features, a well-set head, and a graceful figure. As a young girl, she spent much of her time in Lille, a town built by her father in Northern France. By her late teens, Matilda was a very eligible bachelorette — she was wealthy, beautiful, and smart. And she would catch the eye of someone very important: William of Normandy, the bastard son of the current Duke of Normandy.\n\nNow, you may be thinking: Why would a bastard son be important?\n\nYou’d be right to question, just as Matilda and her father did. William sent a representative to ask for Matilda’s hand in marriage, but Matilda responded that she was too high-born to consider marrying a bastard (who she thought had no future). In response, William rode from his home in Normandy to Bruges, where Matilda was staying. Now, there are conflicting accounts here — some say they met while Matilda was on her way to church, and others say that he stormed into her house. Either way, William dragged Matilda off by her long braids and threw her down to the ground, where he beat her. Everyone who heard of the incident — including Matilda’s father — was furious.\n\nExcept Matilda. From that moment on, Matilda refused to marry anyone but William. When her father asked her why, she stated,\n\n“Because I did not know the Duke then so well as I do now; for her must be a man of great courage and high daring who could venture to come and beat me in my father’s place.”\n\nNo one could understand her reasoning, and even the Pope was brought in on the matter. The Pope issued a papal ban on the marriage, stating that the couple were too closely related. But none of it mattered to Matilda. In 1051, at the age of 21, she married William of Normandy, who was then 25. And despite everyone’s reservations, Matilda and William would go on to have a very successful and happy marriage. In fact, it was so happy that William was completely faithful to her, never having any bastard children (a huge rarity among royal marriages) and contemporary accounts state that they held each other in high respect and esteem. Together, they would have nine children — two of whom would become kings — and all of whom were very well-educated.\n\nYet this wasn’t all that made Matilda an incredible woman. She also played a huge role in her husband’s endeavors. But to understand what happened, we have to set the scene:\n\nIt is 1054, and the King of England — Edward — has died without an heir. The English throne is entirely up for grabs. William and Matilda see an opportunity. William was related to Edward through Edward’s mother, and thus believes that he should be rightful king of England. Despite all his efforts, though, a man named Harold is crowned king — and William decides to go to war for the throne.\n\nMatilda’s role in this war is huge. Women during the Medieval period often ran their husbands homes and businesses when the men were away fighting, and Matilda was no different. She ran the entirety of Normandy throughout the war . Charters and legal documents from the period show that she administered judgment in courts and used her wealth to endow religious communities.\n\nShe also used her own funds to build a ship, the Mora, which she gave to her husband. It had been outfitted with a figurehead effigy of their youngest son holding a trumpet, bow, and arrow pointed towards England. Now, it really shows you how much they loved one another, because William chose to use the Mora as his flagship.\n\nIn 1066, William of Normandy went down in history when he conquered England and became known as William the Conqueror. Two years later, on May 11 of 1068, Matilda was crowned Queen of England. Now, being queen is a big deal, but Matilda took it two steps further. First, during her coronation, the language was changed to state that the queen was “divinely placed by God, shares in royal power, and blesses her people by her power and virtue.” This is huge, because it gave Matilda enormous power as queen — fitting her as a co-ruler rather than simply the king’s wife. Second, Matilda was only 4 foot 2 inches tall at the time of her death — making her England’s smallest queen.\n\nMatilda didn’t spend very much time in England. William stayed to conquer lesser rebellions against his rule, but she returned to Normandy — where she spent her time governing their home lands, supporting her family’s interests, and sponsoring many ecclesiastical houses.\n\nShe also became part of a historical mystery. William’s campaigns of 1066 are commemorated in one of the most famous medieval tapestries that still exist — the Bayeux Tapestry. This huge work of art depicts 58 scenes about William’s progress to the throne, and is called “La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilda” in French. Though many historians no longer believe that Matilda played a role in its creation, some say the name of the tapestry says it all.\n\nMatilda lived to the age of 52, dying in 1082. It is said that William sank into a deep depression upon her death — becoming tyrannical in his rule and refusing to take part in his favorite things, like hunting. He died only four years later, heartbroken over the loss of his beloved wife and co-ruler.\n\nEdith (Matilda of Scotland), 1080–1118\n\nNow, this is where her story joins in with other Matildas. Luckily, this joining is by generations. Matilda of Flanders had a son — Henry I — who married Matilda of Scotland (“Edith”). Together, they had a daughter named Matilda (“Maude”). Somehow, by the twists and turns of history, all three women — Matilda of Flanders, Matilda/Edith of Scotland, and Empress Matilda/Maude — all ruled England.\n\nMatilda of Scotland (“Edith” for the remainder of this tale) was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and his wife, Anglo-Saxon princess Margaret of Wessex. Edith had rather tumultuous teenage years after her father died in 1093; her uncle and brothers fought over the throne, leading to several deaths before her brother, Edgar, finally assumed the throne in 1097 when Edith was 17. Just three years later, King Henry I of England sought Edith’s hand in marriage. Though scholars initially state the proposal was due to her descent from the Anglo-Saxon House of Wessex (which would help legitimize his rule), Henry had known Edith for quite some time. Contemporary chronicler William of Malmesbury recorded that Henry had “long been attached” to Edith, while Orderic Vitalis stated that William “long adored” her character.\n\nThough not as controversial or embroiled in controversy as the other Matildas, it is important to recognize that Edith was just as incredible a queen as the others. She acted as regent in her husband’s absences and went on her own travels around England. She was also a known patron of the arts, especially music, and undertook many building projects on her own estates. Unlike many queens of the early Medieval period, her seal survives (as shown below), and records detail her active role as an intercessor in political and ecclesiastical matters such as disputes between her husband and Archbishop Anselm during the English investiture controversy of 1103–07.\n\nKing Henry I and Edith had a seemingly typical medieval marriage, perhaps even a relatively happy one, with two surviving children — a son, William Adelin (died at age 17), and a daughter, Matilda. Henry I had numerous affairs and illegitimate children, but the historical record does not hint that this caused any discord beyond what might normally have occurred in a royal household (given that such behavior was in some ways “expected” among kings).\n\nEdith died on May 1, 1118, at Westminster. The cause was unknown.\n\nEmpress Maude, 1102–1167\n\nMaude was the daughter of King Henry I and Edith, but little is known about her early life. Many historians suspect she spent much of her time at the court of her mother, living amongst her noble uncles and other relatives.\n\nWhen Maude was 7 years old, she was betrothed to King Henry V of the Romans, who lived in Germany. Despite her young age, or perhaps because of it, Maude was shipped off to live in Germany. She was crowned Queen of the Romans — a stark contrast to her husband, who was already 24 years old— and placed in the custody of Archbishop Bruno of Trier, who educated her in German culture, manners, and government. This was a very high-status marriage — uniting the English royalty with one of the most prestigious dynasties in Europe. Over the next four years, Maude learned everything to do with her new role as queen . She married Henry when she was 12. (He was 28.)\n\nSoon after their marriage, and while Maude was still very young, political unrest broke out. Eventually, Henry V was excommunicated by the Pope — a move that forced the couple to march across the Alps to Italy in order to settle the matter. Fearful of Henry’s armies, the Pope fled Rome — leaving it wide open for Henry and Maude to settle in. And settle in they did. By this time, we know Maude was already playing a large, public role in government — administering grants, dealing with petitioners, and taking part in ceremonies. Upon reaching Rome, she and Henry had themselves crowned Emperor and Empress by a papal envoy at St. Peter’s Basilica. Despite later controversies surrounding this title, Maude would use the title of Empress throughout her life.\n\nWhen Maude was 16, Henry left to settle rebellions back in Germany — leaving Maude as regent over their conquered Italian domains. Up till now, the couple had remained entirely childless — and many chroniclers blame this lack of heirs on Henry’s sins against the Church. The truth is a bit more logical — Maude and Henry had married when she was only 12 and, though it is highly likely that they were sexually active during her teens, they probably didn’t have that much time together since they were campaigning across Italy and now Germany. They were reunited when Maude was 20, but it did not last long. Henry was stricken with cancer, and died in 1125. Maude, being childless, was now left under the protection of Henry’s nephew, Frederick, who inherited his estates. She was 23 years old and faced with a tough decision about her future.\n\nThough marriages were proposed to her, Maude decided to return to her home of Normandy, departing with her personal collection of jewels, her imperial regalia, two of Henry’s crowns, and the valuable relic of the Hand of St. James the Apostle.\n\nBut all would not be so simple for Maude. Her father, the King Henry I of England, was desperate for a male heir. Maude’s brother had been killed during one very drunken night at sea crossing the English Channel. Rules of succession were uncertain, with some dictating primogeniture (where the eldest son inherits) while others still allowed a king to crown his own successor. England was also in a bit of a precarious position because many of the previous kings had achieved rule through conquest, rather than peaceful succession.\n\nKing Henry, seeking to secure a stable transition to a male heir, had taken a second wife — but to no avail. So now he turned to his surviving daughter, Maude. Only a year after losing her husband, Maude was declared her father’s successor — and many Anglo-Norman barons swore to recognize her in the event of Henry’s death.\n\nHenry also secured a new husband for Maude in Geoffrey of Anjou, the eldest son of a Count. Maude wasn’t very happy with this — she found that her status was diminished, since she was now an Empress marrying a Count. She was also older than Geoffrey by 12 years. Eventually, she agreed to the match, and Geoffrey inherited his domains and was knighted by King Henry. Despite all the maneuverings, the marriage wasn’t happy — they didn’t like each other very much, and there was debate over when the couple would take possession of Maude’s dowry, which consisted of many castles in Normandy. Soon after marrying, Maude was so fed up that she left Geoffrey — and it was only a few years later that she agreed to return at her father’s request.\n\nMaude did, however, give Henry what he most wanted: a grandson to inherit his throne. She also, for good measure, gave him a second grandson, though she almost died during childbirth. By this time, there was still huge fighting over Maude’s dowry, which would have ensured her political power — but, before any resolution could happen, King Henry I died in 1135— leaving the English throne empty.\n\nWhatever the king’s desires, a distant male relative — Stephen of Blois — took the throne.\n\nAnother?! Matilda of Boulogne, 1105–1152\n\nMatilda of Boulogne was the well-educated, charming, and intellectual daughter of a Count and his wife, a princess of Scotland. She was also insanely wealthy, since she was an only child — making her the heir to all of Boulogne. At age 20, she married Stephen of Blois, who was also a count — and together, they became joint rulers of Boulogne. For ten years, they seem to have been pretty happy, having three sons and two daughters.\n\nIn 1135, word reached them that King Henry I of England died. Now, Henry had a daughter — the Empress Maude — who was to inherit the throne. Maude and Stephen were both part of the royal family as cousins, with Stephen’s claim made greater given he was the son of Adela, daughter of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders.\n\nStephen decided to beat Maude to it — and Stephen and Matilda declared themselves King and Queen of England in March 1136.\n\nThey took up residence at Oxford for their summer court, of which was later said, “never was there one to exceed it in numbers, in greatness, in gold, silver, gems, costume and in all manners of entertainments.” It is during their summer court that we learn a bit more about their intimate lives, as chroniclers state that they were the ideal medieval couple. Stephen was the brave, handsome warrior devoted to chivalry while Matilda the dignified, tactful, gracious, and intelligent queen — and both were insanely faithful to one another. As noted by Gareth Russell, a medieval historian, novelist, and blogger,\n\n“They co-funded the foundation of monasteries and nunneries linked to new, radical continental religious orders. They gave generously to both the Cluniac and Cistercian orders and helped fund the import of the Savignac religious movement to England, paying for the intensely strict monastic sect to establish monasteries in Essex, Lancashire and Devon. Independently of her husband, the Queen regularly went on religious retreat to Holy Trinity Aldgate, which had been founded by her late godmother and aunt, Matilda of Scotland, in the heart of London. She was also an enthusiastic patron of the Templar Knights, a group of warrior-monks who protected and partly financed the goals of the Crusades. Inspired by their mission statement, Matilda paid for the foundation of temples for the order in Essex and Oxfordshire, during which time she struck up a close friendship with the Templars’ Grand Master.”\n\nSo, it seems that Matilda had a fairly happy life with Stephen — that is, until war broke out.\n\nMatildas at War\n\nNow, to set a clear stage, we’re at the intersection of two Matildas. One, Matilda of Boulogne, sits as Queen of England next to her happy husband, Stephen, and presides over one of the most glittering and beautiful courts ever said to have existed. But all is not as it seems, since Stephen is battling both Scottish invasions in the north and Maude’s invasions in Normandy. Matilda has played an active role, helping to administer England’s affairs while also calling her own troops from Boulogne and Flanders to protect England. In 1139, she was the chief architect of a treaty with David of Scotland that restored peace and ended David’s support of Empress Maude.\n\nThe other, the Empress Maude, sits in Anjou, holding her title of Empress and her jewels, having borne three sons to a man she doesn’t really like, and having known oaths of allegiance that proved false when Stephen took the throne from her. She operates out of the border between Anjou and Normandy, securing knights on estates and gathering her forces and political support. She continues gathering support and eventually returns to English soil — taking shelter at the home of her stepmother, Arundel Castle.\n\nAt this point, their stories fully intersect. Stephen became fed up with the support Maude gained from her stepmother, the Dowager Queen. He insisted that Maude leave England and offered her safe passage. But in letting her go, Stephen loosened his greatest threat. Maude was no fool, and she immediately set to gathering support and forces — seizing control of southern marches and the entire Severn Valley. Minor rebellions broke out in her favor, including an attack on the city of Gloucester. Seeking to end the conflict, Queen Matilda went to negotiate with Maude in Bath. But Matilda was thwarted by her own husband, who refused to make peace and made several political moves that ultimately threw the rebellion out of control.\n\nIn 1141, it all came to a head at the battle of Lincoln, where Stephen was knocked unconscious and taken prisoner by Maude’s supporters.\n\nQueen Matilda was devastated when she heard the King had been captured. Maude was ecstatic, having captured her enemy. Maude took her prisoner to Oxford, the first seat of his power, and made a huge military display of might. She then went to Winchester, where Queen Matilda’s messengers were waiting to plea for Stephen’s life. Maude all but laughed in their faces. As a result, many of Stephen’s remaining supporters defected, and Queen Matilda was forced to leave the safety of the Tower of London with her children, trying to flee to safety in Boulogne.\n\nWhile Queen Matilda traveled, Maude made it to London — where she proclaimed herself the “Lady of the English.” She took up residence in her childhood home, revelling in a triumph that so many had thought her incapable of achieving. There, Maude received another message from Matilda, who was seeking to ensure her daughter Eustace would still inherit her husband’s estates. Maude again laughed, refusing Matilda’s request in the rudest terms possible. Maude also sought to pick London clean of every penny in order to pay her supporters, and she took great pleasure in gloating over her achievements. Unfortunately for Maude, Londoners weren’t going to take that lying down. On June 24th, the church bells rang backwards — a sign of open rebellion. London rose up against Empress Maude, and she was forced to flee London.\n\nQueen Matilda saw her chance. Using her grace and charm, Matilda won back crucial support for her throne and was able to capture Maude’s half-brother and greatest supporter, the Earl of Gloucester. Matilda used her charm and the Earl as a bargaining chip — and in a great political move, arranged to exchange her prisoner for her husband. The King and Queen were reunited, and the Empress Maude was running.\n\nYet all was not well. Stephen was mentally scarred from his time as a hostage and sank into a chronic depression. He relied more and more on his queen, Matilda, who struggled to cover-up her husband’s illness and continue running the kingdom. The fighting continued throughout this, and even the papacy in its declarations about England’s throne seems to have not known which way the wind would blow. The brutal and bloody civil war dragged on — with Stephen constantly chasing Maude around England. Queen Matilda remained in the capital, occasionally traveling to muster troops or financial support, and generally handling all the affairs of a monarch. The situation was so dire and bleak that the joke in England during the 1140s was that\n\n“Christ and His saints must have decided to go to sleep, since they clearly were not answering anybody’s prayers anymore.”\n\nIn 1147, Empress Maude returned to her husband on the continent, leaving England. For nearly two years, it seemed the war might be over. But it would continue, led on by Empress Maude’s son, Henry Plantagenet. Yet we’ll leave this conflict now, as Henry’s affairs are not our concern. What we care about is what happened to Matilda and Maude.\n\nThe Empress Maude spent the rest of her life in Normandy. She acted as her son’s representative and presided over government of the duchy, especially after her husband’s death in 1151. She also helped deal with several diplomatic crises, serving as an advisor to crises in Germany and France. She died in 1167, with her remaining wealth given to the Church. Her epitaph stated,\n\n“Great by birth, greater by marriage, greatest in her offspring: here lies Matilda, the daughter, wife, and mother of Henry.”\n\nThe Empress’s exploits would be told again and again in the many years after her death — including debates by Tudor scholars on her succession and many discussions of her character.\n\nAs for Queen Matilda, originally Matilda of Boulogne, she took time off at Hedingham Castle, the home of her close friend, the Countess of Oxford. There, while enjoying the spring weather, Matilda’s health collapsed and she died on May 3, 1152.\n\nIn the end, all their maneuverings had been for nearly nothing. Stephen and Matilda’s son and heir died only fourteen months after his mother, leaving the Empress Maude’s son, Henry Plantagenet, as the sole heir to the throne of England. Three months after his son’s death, Stephen signed the Winchester Agreement. In it, Henry was recognized as sole heir and Stephen was granted the right to hold the crown until his death, which came only eleven months later.\n\nThree Generations of Incredible Queens\n\nWhatever their ends, their lives were truly incredible. Matilda of Flanders oversaw her husband’s success in rising from bastard status to conquer England and went down in history as one of the most well-known English monarchs. Matilda of Scotland (“Edith”) continued her line for a brief time, maintaining power for her husband in his absence — a task often overlooked by the history books, yet so integral to how Europe was shaped and maintained over millennia. Matilda of Boulogne supported her husband’s efforts to take the English throne as well, though they were ultimately unsuccessful in securing the reign beyond their own lifetimes. And finally, Empress Maude, who was Matilda of Flanders’ granddaughter — and therefore rightful heir — spent a lifetime conquering lands, only to never actually be crowned Queen of her home country…yet finally, in her son, brought a restored administration and consolidated rule to what became the Angevin Empire. (He also married another incredible woman: Eleanor of Aquitaine.)\n\nThese Matildas were fascinating women. Their lives prove that medieval queens weren’t all glittering gowns and jewels, dancing and feasting. They were intelligent, politically astute women who used their power to accomplish many things. In no other period have I seen such immense complexity in queen’s stories and lives. And I continue to discover new ones with every book I read.\n\nAll in all, they prove one of my favorite quotes about medieval queens, as stated by Lisa Hilton,\n\n“Though there is ample, touching, funny evidence of the humanity of medieval queens, it is essential to remember that they were isolated as well as elevated by consecration. They were unique, they were sacred, they were magical.”"
