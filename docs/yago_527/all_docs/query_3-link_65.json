        "text": "A strange and uncertain new world awaited those who boarded the Mayflower nearly 400 years ago.\n\nThe treacherous transatlantic crossing, followed by an horrendous first winter in Massachusetts, claimed the lives of more than half of the passengers and crew who had boarded the ship in Plymouth on 16 September, 1620.\n\nAfter signing the Mayflower Compact - the first governing document of Plymouth Colony - the 53 surviving settlers and the remainder of the crew bravely set out to explore their new surroundings.\n\nAmong them was one Mayflower passenger who had already set foot on US soil more than a decade earlier.\n\nStephen Hopkins had spent several years in Virginia during a previous voyage, and his experience was to prove vital in the Pilgrims' early expeditions and the years that followed.\n\nWho was Stephen Hopkins?\n\nStephen Hopkins is believed to have been born in 1581 in the Hampshire village of Upper Clatford, near Southampton.\n\nShortly after his birth and baptism, his family moved to Winchester and, by 1603/4, Hopkins was married to Mary and living in Hursley, Hampshire.\n\nThe couple had three children - Elizabeth (born 1603), Constance (1606) and Giles (1607) - who were all baptised there.\n\nAn American adventure\n\nIn 1609, Hopkins was hired by the Virginia Company to be a ministers' clerk for the Jamestown, Virginia, settlement and boarded the 'Sea Venture', which was shipwrecked in Bermuda en route to Jamestown.\n\nThe crew subsequently built two boats and, remarkably, arrived at Jamestown just 11 days later in May 1610.\n\nThe shipwreck became a well-known story in London, and William Shakespeare wrote his play, The Tempest', to reflect many of the incidents that happened to the 'Sea Venture' and her passengers. It's believed the Bard possibly even based comic character Stephano on Hopkins!\n\nIn Jamestown, they found the situation in the settlement critical - with the group ravaged by illness and surviving on little food. But just as they were about to evacuate everyone, a relief ship arrived.\n\nHopkins remained in Jamestown for four years but returned to England in 1614 after learning of the death of his wife died. In 1617, he married Elizabeth Fisher at St Mary Matfellon Church in Whitechapel, London, and the following year the couple had a daughter they named Damiris.\n\nThe Mayflower voyage\n\nHopkins worked as a tanner and merchant, and was recruited by the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London to provide governance for Plymouth Colony and to assist with its ventures.\n\nWhen he learned of the Pilgrims' planned voyage to Northern Virginia, Hopkins paid for his and his family's passage, together with two servants - Edward Doty and Edward Leister.\n\nThe couple took with them Constance, Giles and Damaris but did not not pay for his eldest daughter Elizabeth, so it is assumed she had sadly died.\n\nAnd if the transatlantic crossing wasn't dangerous enough, Elizabeth gave birth while at sea to a son whom they named Oceanus.\n\nTime in Plymouth Colony\n\nShortly after arriving in North America, Hopkins was one of the 41 'true' Pilgrims who signed the Mayflower Compact and went on to become an active member of the community, presumably as a result of his years spent in Virginia.\n\nIndeed, his experience was vital in the Pilgrims' early expeditions, and he was considered something of an \"expert\" on Native Americans for the first few contacts.\n\nWhile out exploring, Hopkins is said to have recognised and identified an Indian deer trap. He was also sent on several of the ambassadorial missions to meet with the various Indian groups in the region.\n\nOver the years, he assisted Pilgrim leaders including Myles Standish and Edward Winslow.\n\nHe and Elizabeth also had five more children, named Caleb, Deborah, Ruth, Damaris (in honour of their first daughter who sadly died), and Elizabeth.\n\nHopkins is believed to have died in the summer of 1644, but the location of his burial is unknown.\n\nThe legacy of Stephen Hopkins\n\nStephen Hopkins is still remembered in Hampshire, where a series of guided walks allow you to hear all about his astonishing adventures and his links to Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'."
