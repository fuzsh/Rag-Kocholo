        "text": "Please note that the TimeRef website is currently being redesigned.\n\nThe Anarchy - Civil War - Stephen and Matilda (1139 - 1154)\n\nTweet\n\nStephen chosen by the barons\n\ntephen of Blois, with the approval of the Norman barons, claimed the English throne in 1135 after the death of Henry I, king of England. Henry had chosen his own daughter Matilda as heir to the English throne and had initially gained the agreement of the Norman barons but after his death the barons chose Stephen instead. The barons wanted a Norman to rule England and not an English woman like Matilda. When Stephen became king, Matilda and Geoffrey of Anjou, her husband, fled the country for their own safety.\n\nThe Barons take control\n\nStephen was not a particularly strong king and the barons used this time to build more castles from which they could harshly rule their lands both in Normandy and in England.\n\nSupport for Matilda\n\nNot all the barons supported King Stephen. In Scotland King David, Matilda's uncle, gave his full support to her cause and in the summer of 1138 invaded the north of England travelling as far south as Lincolnshire. The Scottish army was met by the Normans at Northallerton on the 22nd of August in Yorkshire. The battle is known as the Battle of the Standard because at the centre of the English army was a cart displaying important religious banners. The Scots were defeated and King David returned to Scotland.\n\nMatilda also had support from her half-brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester. Robert was an illegitimate son of Henry I and had a weak claim to the English throne. Initially Robert had supported Stephen but in 1138 changed sides and began to fight for Matilda.\n\nMatilda's escape\n\nThe winter was harsh and the siege lasted long enough for the citizens of Oxford to run out of supplies to eat and burn. The situation was hopeless and Matilda planned her escape. Dressed in white robes to travel unnoticed across the snow, Matilda and a small number of knights escaped from the city. The river had completely frozen and they were able to cross over the ice. In October of 1147 Robert of Gloucester died and in February of the next year Matilda left England for Anjou. Without the support of Robert her personal fight for the English throne was over.\n\nMatilda's son continues the fight\n\nHenry was the eldest son of Matilda and Geoffrey of Anjou. Henry made several attempts to overthrow Stephen and in 1153 a treaty was signed at Wallingford on the banks of the River Thames. Stephen's son Eustace had recently died and Stephen was happy for the fighting that had damaged the country so much to come to an end. It was agreed that when Stephen died Henry should become king as Henry II. Stephen died in October 1154 and in December Henry II was crowned at Westminster Abbey.\n\nKey people"
