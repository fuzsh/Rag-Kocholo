        "text": "by Susan Flantzer © Unofficial Royalty 2014\n\nDuring the 12th century in a period called The Anarchy, two Matildas who were the daughters of two sisters, Matilda of Scotland and Mary of Scotland fought each other for control of England. Matilda of Scotland and her sister Mary of Scotland were the daughters of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Through their mother, they were descendants of the Saxon kings in England.\n\nMatilda of Scotland married King Henry I of England and their daughter was Matilda of England, known as Empress Matilda from her first marriage to Holy Roman Emperor Henry V. Mary of Scotland married Eustace III, Count of Boulogne and their daughter Matilda of Boulogne married Stephen of Blois, the future King Stephen of England. Stephen of Blois and Empress Matilda were first cousins, both grandchildren of King William I of England (the Conqueror).\n\nA note about names: Matilda-Maud-Maude were interchangeable names. Matilda was the Latin or Norman form and Maud/Maude was the Saxon form.\n\nAbout.com: Matilda or Maud?\n\nAppellation Mountain: Name of the Day: Maud\n\nBehind the Name: Matilda\n\nBehind the Name: Maud\n\nMatilda of Boulogne was born circa 1105 and was the only child of her parents Eustace III, Count of Boulogne and Mary of Scotland. Upon her father’s death in 1125, Matilda became Countess of Boulogne in her own right. Boulogne was a county within the Kingdom of France from 896 – 1501, centered on the city of Boulogne-sur-Mer, a coastal city in Northern France. The same year, King Henry I of England arranged for his nephew Stephen of Blois to marry Matilda.\n\nStephen and Matilda had three sons and two daughters:\n\nBaldwin of Blois (c. 1126 – c. 2 Dec 1135)\n\nEustace IV, Count of Boulogne (c. 1129 – 1153) married Constance of France, no issue\n\nMatilda of Blois (c. 1133 – c. 1137), married Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester, no issue\n\nMarie of Blois, Countess of Boulogne (1136 – 1182) married Matthew of Alsace, had issue\n\nWilliam of Blois, Count of Boulogne (c. 1137 – 11 October 1159) married Isabel de Warenne, no issue\n\nFive years before Matilda and Stephen married, a terrible tragedy caused a succession crisis. The White Ship carrying King Henry I of England’s only son William Ætheling sank as it left France to sail to England, and William Ætheling drowned. Empress Matilda was King Henry’s only legitimate child, and on Christmas Day of 1226, Henry had his barons swear to recognize Matilda and any future legitimate heirs she might have as his successors.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: The Sinking of the White Ship and How It Affected the English Succession\n\nAfter the sinking of the White Ship, Stephen and Matilda stayed close to King Henry I and lived most of the time in England realizing that Stephen was very close to the throne. Henry’s daughter Empress Matilda had left England as a child to marry Holy Roman Emperor Henry V. The marriage was childless and Holy Roman Emperor Henry V died in 1125. Empress Matilda went to the royal court in Normandy (Kings of England were also Dukes of Normandy). Eventually, King Henry I made arrangements for his daughter to marry Geoffrey of Anjou in 1128. The marriage was not a happy one. The couple often lived apart and failed to produce a child until 1133.\n\nOn December 1, 1135, King Henry I of England died. Stephen of Blois, quickly crossed from Boulogne to England, accompanied by his military household. With the help of his brother, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, Stephen seized power in England and was crowned king on December 22, 1135. Matilda of Boulogne was unable to accompany her husband because she was pregnant, so she was crowned on Easter Day, March 22, 1136. Empress Matilda did not give up her claim to England and Normandy, leading to the long civil war known as The Anarchy between 1135 and 1153.\n\nDuring the civil war, Matilda of Boulogne proved to be her husband’s strongest supporter. Matilda was as strong and resourceful as Stephen was weak and indecisive. When England was invaded in 1138, Matilda rallied troops from Boulogne and its ally Flanders, and successfully besieged Dover Castle. She then went north to Durham, where she made a treaty with King David I of Scotland in 1139. After Stephen was captured at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141, she rallied Stephen’s supporters and raised an army with the help of William of Ypres, Stephen’s chief lieutenant. It was Matilda who recaptured London for Stephen and forced Empress Matilda to withdraw from the siege of Winchester, leading to Stephen’s release in 1141 in exchange for the Empress’ illegitimate brother and her chief supporter Robert FitzRoy, 1st Earl of Gloucester.\n\nBy the mid-1140s, the fighting had slowed down and there was a stalemate and the succession began to be the focus. Empress Matilda returned to Normandy in 1147. In the same year, the Empress’ husband and her eldest son Henry FitzEmpress, the future King Henry II, mounted a small, unsuccessful mercenary invasion of England. The Empress remained in Normandy where she focused on stabilizing the Duchy of Normandy and promoting her son’s rights to the English throne.\n\nMatilda of Boulogne died of a fever on May 3, 1152, at Hedingham Castle in Essex, England. She was buried at Faversham Abbey in Kent, England which she and her husband had established. Perhaps if she had not died and her husband had not lost his strongest supporter, the result of the civil war would have turned out differently.\n\nOn August 17, 1153, Stephen and Matilda’s eldest surviving son Eustace died. Ironically, this was the same day that the first child of Henry FitzEmpress, the future King Henry II, and Eleanor of Aquitaine was born. The child, William IX, Count of Poitiers, survived for only two years, but he was followed by seven siblings, two of whom became Kings of England.\n\nShortly after Eustace’s death in 1153, Stephen and Henry FitzEmpress reached a formal agreement known as the Treaty of Wallingford (or Winchester or Westminster). The treaty allowed Stephen to keep the throne until his death but forced him to recognize Empress Matilda’s son Henry FitzEmpress, as his heir.\n\nStephen survived his wife by a little more than two years. He died apparently of appendicitis at Dover Castle on October 25, 1154, and a line of 14 Plantagenet kings who ruled until 1485 started. Stephen was buried with his wife Matilda and his son Eustace at Faversham Abbey which Stephen and Matilda had founded. All three tombs were lost when Faversham Abbey was demolished during the Dissolution of the Monasteries during the reign of King Henry VIII. Their remains were reportedly thrown into the nearby Faversham Creek. Their empty tombs were unearthed in 1964 near what had been the center of the choir. At St. Mary of Charity Church, the parish church in Faversham, there is a tomb where it is said that the remains of King Stephen, his wife Matilda, and his son Eustace were reinterred after the destruction of Faversham Abbey.\n\nSharon Kay Penman’s excellent historical fiction novel When Christ and His Saints Slept deals with The Anarchy and most of the historical figures mentioned here are characters.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
