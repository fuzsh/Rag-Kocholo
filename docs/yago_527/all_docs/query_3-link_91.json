        "meta_description": "This is the second in a series of 2022 CSUB Alumni Hall of Fame profiles.When he was an assistant wrestling coach at CSUB, Darryl Pope was famous for subjecting his freshmen to a frightening Cobra maneuver to teach them what position not to get into.Most wrestlers got up from it petrified. Not Stephen Neal.“Instead of being this little puppy dog that’s scared, he gets up and his eyes are watering and he’s foaming at the mouth,” Pope recalled 28 years later. “He comes right back after me and I’m like, ‘This kid’s got what it takes.’”But few could have predicted just how far Neal’s talents would take him in sports – all the way to the Super Bowl.Neal went from fourth in the state wrestling championships his senior year of high school to winning two collegiate national titles and compiling a career record of 156-10 at CSUB. He was undefeated in 1998 and 1999, two of only four perfect seasons in CSUB history. In 1999 he won the Dan Hodge Trophy, the Heisman of wrestling, and the World Wrestling Championship in Ankara, Turkey.And in a sport where less than 2 percent of draft-eligible college athletes make the NFL, according to 2019 data, Neal made the league without playing any college football. Not only that, he spent 10 years protecting one of the league’s all-time greatest quarterbacks, Tom Brady, and playing for one of its all-time greatest coaches, Bill Belichick, as an offensive lineman with the New England Patriots.“They don’t come any better than Steve Neal,” Belichick said when Neal retired in 2011. “In terms of improvement and development as a player, Steve may have accomplished more than any player I have ever been around.”",
