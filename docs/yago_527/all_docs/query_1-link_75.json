        "text": "Matilda (c.February 7, 1102 – September 10, 1167) was born at Sutton Courtenay, in Berkshire to King Henry I of England and Duke of Normandy, and his first wife, Matilda of Scotland.\n\nMatilda of Scotland was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and the Anglo-Saxon princess Margaret of Wessex, who was born in the Kingdom of Hungary to the expatriate English prince Edward the Exile, Margaret and her family returned to England in 1057.\n\nFollowing the death of KingbHarold II Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, her brother Edgar Ætheling was elected as King of the English but never crowned and never reigned.\n\nMargaret of Wessex’s father, Prince Edward the Exile (1016 – 1057), also called Edward Ætheling, was the son of King Edmund Ironside of the English and of Ealdgyth. Historians are unsure of the identity of Ealdgyth, that may or not have been her name. She was first the wife of Sigeferth son of Earngrim, thegn of the Seven Burghs, and later of King Edmund Ironside.\n\nPrince Edward the Exile spent most of his life in exile in the Kingdom of Hungary following the defeat of his father by King Canute of Denmark and England.\n\nKing Henry I was the youngest son of William the Conqueror, who had invaded England in 1066, creating an empire stretching into Wales.\n\nThe daughter and heir of King Henry I of England, Matilda went to Germany as a child when she was married to the future Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich V.\n\nEmperor Heinrich V was the fourth and last ruler from the Salian Dynasty. He was made co-ruler by his father, Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich IV, in 1098. His mother was Bertha of Savoy daughter of Otto, Count of Savoy and his wife Adelaide of Susa from the Arduinici noble family, and as such a member of the Burgundian House of Savoy.\n\nMatilda travelled with the Emperor to Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned Empress in St Peter’s Basilica, and acted as the imperial regent in Italy. Matilda and Heinrich V had no children, and when he died in 1125, the imperial crown was claimed by his rival Lothair of Supplinburg.\n\nUpon her widowhood in the Holy Roman Empire, Matilda was recalled to Normandy by her father, who arranged for her to marry Geoffrey of Anjou to form an alliance to protect his southern borders in France.\n\nMatilda’s younger and only full brother, William Adelin, died in the White Ship disaster of 1120, leaving Matilda’s father and realm facing a potential succession crisis. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an oath of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in his Anglo-Norman court.\n\nKing Henry died in 1135, but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from the barons. The throne was instead taken by Matilda’s male cousin Prince Stephen, Count of Blois, who enjoyed the backing of the English Church and was proclaimed King in place of Empress Matilda. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.\n\nThis usurpation by Stephen of Blois resulted in the period of English history known as the Anarchy which was a Civil War in England and Normandy between 1138 and 1153, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order.\n\nAfter many years of Civil War the Treaty of Wallingford allowed Stephen to retain the throne but recognised Matilda’s son, Prince Henry Curtmantle (also know as Henry Fitzempress)as his successor.\n\nOver the following year, Stephen began to reassert his authority over the whole kingdom, but died of disease in 1154. Henry was crowned as King Henry II of Englandl0, the first Angevin king of England, then began a long period of reconstruction.\n\nThe conflict had been considered particularly destructive\n\nEmpress Matilda worked extensively with the Church, founding Cistercian monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was buried under the high altar at Bec Abbey after her death in 1167, until much later her tomb was moved to Rouen Cathedral.\n\nStephen of Blois (1092 or 1096 – October 25, 1154) was King of England from December 22, 1135 to his death in 1154. He was Count of Boulogne jure uxoris from 1125 until 1147 and Duke of Normandy from 1135 until 1144.\n\nStephen’s father was Stephen II Henri, Count of Blois and Chartres, an important French nobleman and an active crusader who died when Stephen was at most ten years old.\n\nStephen’s mother, Adela of England and Normandy, was the daughter of King William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. She was famous among her contemporaries for her piety and strong personality. Indeed, Adela was a major reason for Stephen II Henri’s return to the Levant. She had a strong formative influence on Stephen during his growing years; she would live to see her son take her father’s throne of England, but would die within a year after that.\n\nHis father died while Stephen was still young, and he was brought up by his mother. Placed into the court of his uncle King Henry I of England, Stephen rose in prominence and was granted extensive lands.\n\nKing Henry I of England had only one other legitimate child, the future Empress Matilda, but as a woman she was at a substantial political disadvantage. Shortly after the death of his son, the King took a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, but it became increasingly clear that he would not have another legitimate son, and he instead looked to Empress Matilda as his intended heir.\n\nEmpress Matilda’s claim to the title of Holy Roman Empress was through her marriage to Emperor Heinrich V, but her husband died in 1125, and she was remarried in 1128 to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, whose lands bordered the Duchy of Normandy.\n\nGeoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an Angevin ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans. At the same time, tensions continued to grow as a result of Henry’s domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars. Conflict was curtailed, however, by the power of the King’s personality and reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, the King arranged for Stephen to marry Matilda of Boulogne, inheriting additional estates in Kent and Boulogne that made the couple one of the wealthiest in England. Stephen became Count of Boulogne by jure uxoris, by right of his wife.\n\nMatilda of Boulogne was the daughter of Count Eustace III of Boulogne. Her mother, Mary of Scotland, was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Margaret of Wessex, (also known as Saint Margaret of Scotland) the daughter of the English Prince Edward the Exile of Wessex and his wife Agatha. Matilda of Boulogne was also the granddaughter of Edmund Ironside, King of England.\n\nAgatha, wife of Edward the Exile, is from unknown parentage. Her antecedents are unclear and the subject of much speculation and one of the unresolved questions of medieval genealogy.\n\nStephen narrowly escaped drowning with Henry I’s son, William Adelin (Ætheling), in the sinking of the White Ship in 1120; William’s death left the succession of the English throne open to challenge.\n\nWhen news began to spread of Henry I’s death on December 1, 1135 many of the potential claimants to the throne were not well placed to respond. Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou, rather awkwardly supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda’s supporters such as Robert of Gloucester.\n\nMany of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late King was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. Stephen’s brother Theobald was further south still, in Blois.\n\nStephen, however, was in Boulogne, and when news reached him of Henry’s death he left for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless, Stephen probably reached his own estate on the edge of London by December 8th and over the next week he began to seize power in England.\n\nThe crowds in London traditionally claimed a right to elect the King, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return.\n\nHenry of Blois delivered the support of the church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, Bishop of Salisbury and Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury to be handed over to Stephen.\n\nOn December 15, Henry of Blois delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late king had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath.\n\nFurthermore, the late king had only insisted on that oath to protect the stability of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late king’s royal steward, to swear that the King had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead.\n\nThree weeks after the death of King Henry I of England, Stephen’s coronation was held at Westminster Abbey on December 22,1135.\n\nWith Stephen crowned King of England this led to the time period known as the Anarchy.\n\nThe Anarchy was a civil war in England and Normandy between 1135 and 1153, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order. The conflict was a war of succession between King Stephen and Empress Matilda who both legally claimed the English throne.\n\nHenry I (c. 1068 – December 1, 1135), also known as Henry Beauclerc, was King of England from 1100 to his death in 1135. Henry was probably born in England in 1068, in either the summer or the last weeks of the year, possibly in the town of Selby in Yorkshire.\n\nHe was the fourth son of William I the Conqueror, King of England and Duke of Normandy and was educated in Latin and the liberal arts. On King William I’s death in 1087, Henry’s elder brothers Robert II Curthose and William II Rufus inherited Normandy and England, respectively, but Henry was left landless.\n\nHe purchased the County of Cotentin in western Normandy from Robert, but his brothers deposed him in 1091. He gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with King William Rufus against Robert.\n\nHenry’s mother, Matilda of Flanders, was the only daughter of Count Baldwin V of Flanders and Adela of the Franks and was the granddaughter of King Robert II of the Franks, and she probably named Henry after her uncle, King Henri I of the Franks.\n\nPresent in England with his brother King William II Rufus of England who died in a hunting accident, Henry seized the English throne, promising at his coronation to correct many of William’s less popular policies.\n\nHenry married Matilda of Scotland, a daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and the Anglo-Saxon princess Margaret of Wessex, the daughter of the English prince Edward the Exile and his wife Agatha, and also the granddaughter of Edmund Ironside, King of England.\n\nKing Henry and Matilda had two surviving children, Empress Matilda and William Adelin; he also had many illegitimate children by his numerous mistresses.\n\nDuke Robert II of Normandy who invaded from Normandy in 1101, disputed Henry’s control of England; this military campaign ended in a negotiated settlement that confirmed Henry as king. The peace was short-lived, and Henry invaded the Duchy of Normandy in 1105 and 1106, finally defeating Robert at the Battle of Tinchebray.\n\nHenry kept Robert imprisoned for the rest of his life. Henry’s control of Normandy was challenged by King Louis VI of the Franks, Count Baldwin VII of Flanders and Count Fulk V of Anjou, who promoted the rival claims of Robert’s son, William Clito, and supported a major rebellion in the Duchy between 1116 and 1119. Following Henry’s victory at the Battle of Brémule, a favourable peace settlement was agreed with King Louis VI in 1120.\n\nConsidered by contemporaries to be a harsh but effective ruler, Henry skilfully manipulated the barons in England and Normandy. In England, he drew on the existing Anglo-Saxon system of justice, local government and taxation, but also strengthened it with more institutions, including the royal exchequer and itinerant justices.\n\nNormandy was also governed through a growing system of justices and an exchequer. Many of the officials who ran Henry’s system were “new men” of obscure backgrounds, rather than from families of high status, who rose through the ranks as administrators.\n\nHenry encouraged ecclesiastical reform, but became embroiled in a serious dispute in 1101 with Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, which was resolved through a compromise solution in 1105. He supported the Cluniac order and played a major role in the selection of the senior clergy in England and Normandy.\n\nHenry’s son William drowned in the White Ship disaster of 1120, throwing the royal succession into doubt. Henry took a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, in the hope of having another son, but their marriage was childless.\n\nIn response to this, he declared his daughter Matilda his heir and married her to Geoffrey of Anjou. The relationship between Henry and the couple became strained, and fighting broke out along the border with Anjou. King Henry I died on December 1, 1135 after a week of illness. Despite his plans for Matilda, the King was succeeded by his nephew Stephen of Blois, resulting in a period of civil war known as the Anarchy.\n\nLouis VI (ca. December 1081 – August 1, 1137), called the Fat or the Fighter was King of the Franks from 1108 to 1137. Chronicles called him “King of Saint-Denis”.\n\nEarly life\n\nThe future King Louis VI was born around 1081 in Paris, the son of King Philippe I of the Franks and Bertha of Holland, the daughter of Count Floris I of Holland and Gertrude of Saxony.\n\nAbbot Suger of Saint Denis, who wrote a biography of Louis VI, tells us: “In his youth, growing courage matured his spirit with youthful vigour, making him bored with hunting and the boyish games with which others of his age used to enjoy themselves and forget the pursuit of arms.” And “How valiant he was in youth, and with what energy he repelled the king of the English, William Rufus, when he attacked Louis’ inherited kingdom.”\n\nLouis married Lucienne de Rochefort, the daughter of his father’s seneschal, in 1104, but repudiated her three years later. They had no children.\n\nOn August 3, 1115 Louis married Adelaide of Maurienne, daughter of Umberto II of Savoy and of Gisela of Burgundy, and niece of Pope Callixtus II. They had eight children. Adelaide was one of the most politically active of all France’s medieval queens. Her name appears on 45 royal charters from the reign of Louis VI. During her time as queen (1115–1137), royal charters were dated with both her regnal year and that of the king.\n\nWhen Louis ascended the throne, the Kingdom of the Franks was a collection of feudal principalities. Beyond the Isle de France the Kings of the Franks had little authority over the great dukes and counts of the realm, but slowly King Louis VI began to change this and assert Capetian power. This process would take two centuries to complete but began in the reign of King Louis VI.\n\nThe second great challenge facing King Louis VI was to counter the rising power of the Anglo-Normans under their capable new monarch, King Henry I of England.\n\nKing Louis VI was the first member of the House of Capét to make a lasting contribution to centralizing the institutions of royal power. He spent almost all of his twenty-nine-year reign fighting either the “robber barons” who plagued Paris or the Kings of England for their continental possession of Normandy.\n\nNonetheless, King Louis VI managed to reinforce his power considerably and became one of the first strong Kings of the Franks since the death of Charlemagne in 814.\n\nKing Louis VI was a warrior-king, but by his forties his weight had become so great that it was increasingly difficult for him to lead in the field (hence the epithet “the Fat”). Details about his life and person are preserved in the Vita Ludovici Grossi Regis, a panegyric composed by his loyal advisor, Suger, abbot of Saint Denis.\n\nAs King Louis VI approached his end, there seemed to be reasons for optimism. King Henry I of England had died on December 1, 1135 and Stephen of Blois had seized the English crown, reneging on the oath he had sworn to King Henry I to support Matilda. Stephen was thus in no position to bring the combined Anglo-Norman might against the French crown.\n\nLouis had also made great strides in exercising his royal authority over his barons, and even Theobald II had finally rallied to the Capetian cause.\n\nFinally, on April 9, 1137, a dying Guillaume X, Duke of Aquitaine appointed Louis VI guardian of his fifteen-year-old daughter and heiress, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Eleanor was suddenly the most eligible heiress in Europe, and Louis wasted no time in marrying her to his own heir, the future Louis VII, at the Cathedral of Saint-André in Bordeaux on July 25, 1137. At a stroke Louis had added one of the most powerful duchies in France to the Capetian domains.\n\nLouis died of dysentery 7 days later, on August 1, 1137. Despite his achievements, it would be the growing power of the soon to be Angevin Empire that would come to overshadow his successor, its seeds sown in the marriage between the Empress Matilda (daughter of King Henry I of England) and Count Geoffrey Plantagenet of Anjou and realised through their son, King Henry II of England.\n\nKing Louis VI was interred in the Basilica of St Denis in Paris.\n\nFrom The Emperor’s Desk: I could not cover the entirety of King Stephen’s reign therefore this post will cover his succession to the English throne.\n\nStephen of Blois (1092 or 1096 – October 25, 1154) was King of England from December 22, 1135 to his death in 1154. He was Count of Boulogne jure uxoris from 1125 until 1147 and Duke of Normandy from 1135 until 1144.\n\nStephen’s father was Stephen II Henry, Count of Blois and Chartres, an important French nobleman and an active crusader who died when Stephen was at most ten years old.\n\nStephen’s mother, Adela, was the daughter of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. She was famous among her contemporaries for her piety and strong personality. Indeed, Adela was a major reason for Stephen II Henry’s return to the Levant. She had a strong formative influence on Stephen during his growing years; she would live to see her son take her father’s throne of England, but would die within a year after that.\n\nHis father died while Stephen was still young, and he was brought up by his mother. Placed into the court of his uncle King Henry I of England, Stephen rose in prominence and was granted extensive lands.\n\nKing Henry had only one other legitimate child, the future Empress Matilda, but as a woman she was at a substantial political disadvantage. Shortly after the death of his son, the King took a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, but it became increasingly clear that he would not have another legitimate son, and he instead looked to Matilda as his intended heir.\n\nMatilda claimed the title of Holy Roman Empress through her marriage to Emperor Heinrich V, but her husband died in 1125, and she was remarried in 1128 to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, whose lands bordered the Duchy of Normandy.\n\nGeoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an Angevin ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans. At the same time, tensions continued to grow as a result of Henry’s domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars. Conflict was curtailed, however, by the power of the King’s personality and reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, the King arranged for Stephen to marry Matilda of Boulogne, inheriting additional estates in Kent and Boulogne that made the couple one of the wealthiest in England. Stephen became Count of Boulogne by jure uxoris, by right of his wife.\n\nMatilda of Boulogne was the daughter of Count Eustace III of Boulogne. Her mother, Mary of Scotland, was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Margaret of Wessex, (also known as Saint Margaret of Scotland) the daughter of the English Prince Edward the Exile of Wessex and his wife Agatha. Matilda of Boulogne was also the granddaughter of Edmund Ironside, King of England.\n\nAgatha, wife of Edward the Exile, is from unknown parentage. Her antecedents are unclear and the subject of much speculation and one of the unresolved questions of medieval genealogy.\n\nStephen narrowly escaped drowning with Henry I’s son, William Adelin (Ætheling), in the sinking of the White Ship in 1120; William’s death left the succession of the English throne open to challenge.\n\nWhen news began to spread of Henry I’s death on December 1, 1135 many of the potential claimants to the throne were not well placed to respond. Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou, rather awkwardly supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda’s supporters such as Robert of Gloucester.\n\nMany of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late King was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England.

Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late king’s royal steward, to swear that the King had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead. Stephen’s coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 22 December 1135.\n\nMeanwhile, the Norman nobility gathered at Le Neubourg to discuss declaring Theobald II, Count of Blois and Count of Champagne as King of England, probably following the news that Stephen was gathering support in England.\n\nTheobald II was the son of Count Stephen II Henry of Blois and his wife Adela of Normandy (daughter of William the Conqueror), and the elder brother of King Stephen of England. Although he was the second son, Theobald was appointed above his older brother William the Simple, Count of Sully.\n\nWilliam, Count of Sully was the eldest legitimate grandson of William the Conqueror. He would thus have been the principal rival to King Henry I’s daughter Matilda to inherit the throne after Henry’s death. However, William was not considered as a candidate for the English crown. Several historians have taken the view that he was passed over because of mental deficiency; hence his soubriquet “William the Simple”. Though widely argued, this has never been clearly substantiated.\n\nThe Normans argued that Count Theobald II, as the more senior grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the Duchy of Normandy, and was certainly preferable to Matilda.\n\nTheobald met with the Norman barons and Robert of Gloucester at Lisieux on 21 December 21st. Their discussions were interrupted by the sudden news from England that Stephen’s coronation was to occur the next day.\n\nCount Theobald II then agreed to the Normans’ proposal that he be made King of England, only to find that his former support immediately ebbed away: the barons were not prepared to support the division of England and Normandy by opposing Stephen, who subsequently financially compensated Theobald, who in return remained in Blois and supported his brother’s succession.\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine (c. 1122 – April 1, 1204)\n\nEleanor was the daughter of Guillaume X, Duke of Aquitaine, and Aénor de Châtellerault. She became duchess upon her father’s death in April 1137, and three months later she married Louis, son of her guardian King Louis VI of the Franks. A few weeks later, Eleanor’s father-in-law died and her husband succeeded him as King Louis VII of the Franks\n\nEleanor and Louis VII had two daughters, Marie and Alix. Soon afterwards, she sought an annulment of her marriage, but her request was rejected by Pope Eugene III. Eventually, Louis agreed to an annulment, as fifteen years of marriage had not produced a son.\n\nOn March 21, the four archbishops, with the approval of Pope Eugene III, granted an annulment on grounds of consanguinity within the fourth degree; Eleanor was Louis’ third cousin once removed, and shared common ancestry with King Robért II of Franks. Their two daughters were, however, declared legitimate. Custody of the daughters was awarded to King Louis VII. Archbishop Samson received assurances from Louis that Eleanor’s lands would be restored to her.\n\nAs Eleanor travelled to Poitiers, two lords—Theobald V, Count of Blois, and Geoffrey, Count of Nantes, brother of Henry II, Duke of Normandy—tried to kidnap and marry her to claim her lands. As soon as she arrived in Poitiers, Eleanor sent envoys to Henry II Duke of Normandy and future King of the English, asking him to come at once to marry her.\n\nKing Henry II of the English (March 5, 1133 – July 6, 1189)\n\nDuke Henry II of Normandy was born in Maine at Le Mans on March 5, 1133, the eldest child of the Empress Matilda, and her second husband, Geoffrey V, Plantagenet, Count of Anjou.\n\nHis mother, Empress Matilda, was born to Henry I, King of the English and Duke of Normandy, and his first wife, Matilda of Scotland, a daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and the Anglo-Saxon Princess Margaret of Wessex, the daughter of the English prince Edward the Exile and his wife Agatha, and also the granddaughter of Edmund Ironside, King of the English.\n\nKing Henry I of the English was the youngest son of William the Conqueror, who had invaded England in 1066.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn May 18, 1152 (Whit Sunday), eight weeks after her annulment, Eleanor married Henry “without the pomp and ceremony that befitted their rank.”\n\nEleanor was related to Henry even more closely than she had been to Louis: they were cousins to the third degree through their common ancestor Ermengarde of Anjou, wife of Robért I, Duke of Burgundy and Geoffrey, Count of Gâtinais, and they were also descended from King Robért II of the Franks.\n\nA marriage between Henry and Eleanor’s daughter Marie had earlier been declared impossible due to their status as third cousins once removed. It was rumoured by some that Eleanor had had an affair with Henry’s own father, Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou, who had advised his son to avoid any involvement with her.\n\nOn 25 October 1154, Henry became King Henry II of the English. A now heavily pregnant Eleanor, was crowned Queen of the English by Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, on December 19, 1154. She may not have been anointed on this occasion, however, because she had already been anointed in 1137.\n\nOver the next 13 years, she bore Henry five sons and three daughters: William, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, John, Matilda, Eleanor, and Joan. Historian John Speed, in his 1611 work History of Great Britain, mentions the possibility that Eleanor had a son named Philip, who died young. His sources no longer exist, and he alone mentions this birth.\n\nEleanor’s marriage to Henry was reputed to be tumultuous and argumentative, although sufficiently cooperative to produce at least eight pregnancies. Henry was by no means faithful to his wife and had a reputation for philandering; he fathered other, illegitimate, children throughout the marriage.\n\nEleanor appears to have taken an ambivalent attitude towards these affairs. Geoffrey of York, for example, was an illegitimate son of Henry, but acknowledged by Henry as his child and raised at Westminster in the care of the Queen.\n\nHenry I (c. 1068 – December 1, 1135), also known as Henry Beauclerc, was King of the English from 1100 to his death in 1135. He was the fourth son of William the Conqueror and was educated in Latin and the liberal arts. On William’s death in 1087, Henry’s elder brothers Robert Curthose and William Rufus inherited Normandy and England, respectively, but Henry was left landless.\n\nHe purchased the County of Cotentin in western Normandy from Robert, but his brothers deposed him in 1091. He gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with William Rufus against Robert.\n\nHenry was probably born in England in 1068, in either the summer or the last weeks of the year, possibly in the town of Selby in Yorkshire. His father was William the Conqueror, the Duke of Normandy who had invaded England in 1066 to become King of the English establishing lands stretching into Wales.\n\nThe invasion had created an Anglo-Norman ruling class, many with estates on both sides of the English Channel. These Anglo-Norman barons typically had close links to the Kingdom of France, which was then a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under only the nominal control of the king. Henry’s mother, Matilda of Flanders, was the granddaughter of Robert II of France, and she probably named Henry after her uncle, King Henry I of France.\n\nPresent at the place where his brother King William II died in a hunting accident in 1100, Henry seized the English throne,\n\nHenry was hastily crowned king in Westminster Abbey on August 5 by Maurice, the bishop of London, as Anselm, the archbishop of Canterbury, had been exiled by William Rufus, and Thomas, the archbishop of York, was in the north of England at Ripon. In accordance with English tradition and in a bid to legitimise his rule, Henry issued a coronation charter laying out various commitments.\n\nThe new king presented himself as having restored order to a trouble-torn country. He announced that he would abandon William Rufus’s policies towards the Church, which had been seen as oppressive by the clergy; he promised to prevent royal abuses of the barons’ property rights, and assured a return to the gentler customs of Edward the Confessor; he asserted that he would “establish a firm peace” across England and ordered “that this peace shall henceforth be kept”.\n\nDaughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and the Anglo-Saxon princess Margaret of Wessex, Matilda was educated at a convent in southern England, where her aunt Christina was abbess, and forced her to wear a veil. In 1093, Matilda was engaged to an English nobleman until her father and her brother Edward were killed in the Battle of Alnwick in 1093.\n\nHer uncle Donald III seized the throne of Scotland, triggering a messy succession conflict. England opposed King Donald and supported first her half-brother Duncan II as king of Scotland, and after his death, her brother Edgar, who assumed the throne in 1097.\n\nHenry I succeeded his brother William Rufus as king of the English in 1100 and quickly proposed marriage to Matilda due to her descent from the Anglo-Saxon House of Wessex, which would help legitimize his rule. After proving she had not taken religious vows, Matilda and Henry were married.\n\nHenry and Matilda had two surviving children, Empress Matilda and William Adelin; he also had many illegitimate children by his many mistresses.\n\nRobert, who invaded from Normandy in 1101, disputed Henry’s control of England; this military campaign ended in a negotiated settlement that confirmed Henry as king. The peace was short-lived, and Henry invaded the Duchy of Normandy in 1105 and 1106, finally defeating Robert at the Battle of Tinchebray. Henry kept Robert imprisoned for the rest of his life.\n\nHenry’s control of Normandy was challenged by Louis VI, King of the Franks, Baldwin VII of Flanders and Fulk V of Anjou, who promoted the rival claims of Robert’s son, William Clito, and supported a major rebellion in the Duchy between 1116 and 1119.\n\nFollowing Henry’s victory at the Battle of Brémule, a favourable peace settlement was agreed with Louis in 1120.\n\nConsidered by contemporaries to be a harsh but effective ruler, Henry skillfully manipulated the barons in England and Normandy. In England, he drew on the existing Anglo-Saxon system of justice, local government and taxation, but also strengthened it with additional institutions, including the royal exchequer and itinerant justices.\n\nNormandy was also governed through a growing system of justices and an exchequer. Many of the officials who ran Henry’s system were “new men” of obscure backgrounds, rather than from families of high status, who rose through the ranks as administrators.\n\nHenry encouraged ecclesiastical reform, but became embroiled in a serious dispute in 1101 with Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, which was resolved through a compromise solution in 1105. He supported the Cluniac order and played a major role in the selection of the senior clergy in England and Normandy.\n\nHenry’s son William drowned in the White Ship disaster of 1120, throwing the royal succession into doubt. Henry took a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, in the hope of having another son, but their marriage was childless.\n\nIn response to this, he declared his daughter Matilda his heir and married her to Geoffrey of Anjou. The relationship between Henry and the couple became strained, and fighting broke out along the border with Anjou. King Henry I died on December 1, 1135 after a week of illness. Despite his plans for Matilda, the King was succeeded by his nephew Stephen of Blois, resulting in a period of civil war known as the Anarchy.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: I couldn’t find any contemporary portrait of King Stephen that I liked so I’m using shots of King Stephen from the TV mini series “Pillars of the Earth” which I highly recommend!\n\nRelations among King Henry, Empress Matilda, and Geoffrey became increasingly strained during the King’s final years. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England. In 1135 they urged Henry to hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive, and insisted that the Norman nobility swear immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a more powerful position after Henry’s death.\n\nHenry angrily declined to do so, probably out of concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy. A fresh rebellion broke out amongst the barons in southern Normandy, led by William III, Count of Ponthieu, whereupon Geoffrey and Matilda intervened in support of the rebels.\n\nHenry campaigned throughout the autumn, strengthening the southern frontier, and then travelled to Lyons-la-Forêt in November to enjoy some hunting, still apparently healthy. There he fell ill – according to the chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, he ate too many (“a surfeit of”) lampreys against his physician’s advice – and his condition worsened over the course of a week.\n\nOnce the condition appeared terminal, Henry gave confession and summoned Archbishop Hugh of Amiens, who was joined by Robert of Gloucester and other members of the court. In accordance with custom, preparations were made to settle Henry’s outstanding debts and to revoke outstanding sentences of forfeiture.\n\nThe King died on December 1, 1135, and his corpse was taken to Rouen accompanied by the barons, where it was embalmed; his entrails were buried locally at the priory of Notre-Dame du Pré, and the preserved body was taken on to England, where it was interred at Reading Abbey.\n\nWhen news began to spread of Henry I’s death, many of the potential claimants to the throne were not well placed to respond. Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou, rather awkwardly supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda’s supporters such as Robert of Gloucester.\n\nMany of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late King was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. Stephen’s elder brother Theobald was further south still, in Blois. Stephen, however, was in Boulogne, and when news reached him of Henry’s death he left for England, accompanied by his military household.\n\nRobert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless, Stephen probably reached his own estate on the edge of London by December 8 and over the next week he began to seize power in England.\n\nOn December 15, Henry of Huntingdon delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry of Huntingdon convincingly argued that the late King Henry had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath.\n\nFurthermore, the late King had only insisted on that oath to protect the stability of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry of Huntingdon was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late King’s royal steward, to swear that the King had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead.\n\nMeanwhile, the Norman nobility gathered at Le Neubourg to discuss declaring Theobald king, probably following the news that Stephen was gathering support in England. The Normans argued that the count, as the more senior grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the duchy, and was certainly preferable to Empress Matilda.\n\nTheobald met with the Norman barons and Robert of Gloucester at Lisieux on December 21. Their discussions were interrupted by the sudden news from England that Stephen’s coronation was to occur the next day.\n\nTheobald then agreed to the Normans’ proposal that he be made king, only to find that his former support immediately ebbed away: the barons were not prepared to support the division of England and Normandy by opposing Stephen, who subsequently financially compensated Theobald, who in return remained in Blois and supported his brother’s succession.\n\nThe crowds in London proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return. Henry of Blois delivered the support of the church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, Bishop of Salisbury and Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury to be handed over to Stephen.\n\nStephen’s coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on December 22.\n\nAssessment: Stephen of Blois was clearly a usurper. King Henry I designated the English throne to his only surviving legitimate child, Empress Matilda. Barrons and other nobles swore an oath of allegiance to the Empress Matilda which they renounced upon the death of King Henry. Ignoring thier oaths, the nobility supported Stephen in the battle for the crown.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: The succession of King Stephen of England will take several entries to tell the complete history.\n\nHenry I of England’s succession plans were thrown into chaos by the sinking of the White Ship on November 25, 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving his eldest son and heir, William Adelin, and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship.\n\nWilliam and his party had remained drinking on the shore until after dark, confident that in a fast ship and on the still sea the delay would have no real effect. Consequently, it was the middle of the night when the drunken helmsman rammed the ship into a rock in the bay.\n\nThe crew and passengers could not lever the ship off the rock, or prevent the ship from filling with water.\n\nWilliam Adelin got into a small boat and could have escaped but turned back to try to rescue his half-sister, Matilda, when he heard her cries for help. His boat was swamped by others trying to save themselves, and William drowned along with them.\n\nAccording to Orderic Vitalis, Berold (Beroldus or Berout), a butcher from Rouen, was the sole survivor of the shipwreck by clinging to the rock. The chronicler further wrote that when Thomas FitzStephen came to the surface after the sinking and learned that William Adelin had not survived, he let himself drown rather than face the king.\n\nHenry of Huntingdon, speaking of the disaster, wrote that William, “instead of wearing embroidered robes…floated naked in the waves, and instead of ascending a lofty throne…found his grave at the bottom of the sea.” William’s wife, Matilda, was on another ship at the time of the wreck.\n\nWhen the ship sank, as many as 300 people were killed, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen. Henry’s court was initially too scared to report William’s death to the King. When he was finally told, he collapsed with grief.\n\nThe disaster left Henry with no legitimate son, his various nephews now the closest possible male heirs. Henry announced he would take a new wife, Adeliza of Louvain, opening up the prospect of a new royal son, and the two were married at Windsor Castle in January 1121.\n\nHenry appears to have chosen her because she was attractive and came from a prestigious noble line. Adeliza seems to have been fond of Henry and joined him in his travels, probably to maximise the chances of her conceiving a child.\n\nThe White Ship disaster initiated fresh conflict in Wales, where the drowning of Richard, 1st Earl of Chester, encouraged a rebellion led by Maredudd ap Bleddyn. Henry intervened in North Wales that summer with an army and, although he was hit by a Welsh arrow, the campaign reaffirmed royal power across the region.\n\nHenry’s alliance with Anjou – which had been based on his son William marrying Fulk’s daughter Matilda – began to disintegrate. Fulk returned from the Levant and demanded that Henry return Matilda and her dowry, a range of estates and fortifications in Maine.\n\nMatilda left for Anjou, but Henry argued that the dowry had in fact originally belonged to him before it came into the possession of Fulk, and so declined to hand the estates back to Anjou.\n\nFulk married his daughter Sibylla to William Clito, and granted them Maine. Once again, conflict broke out, as Amaury de Montfort allied himself with Fulk and led a revolt along the Norman-Anjou border in 1123. Amaury was joined by several other Norman barons, headed by Waleran de Beaumont, one of the sons of Henry’s old ally, Robert of Meulan."
