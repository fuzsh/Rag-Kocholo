        "text": "Empress Matilda, also known as the Empress Maud, was one of the claimants to the English throne during the nineteen year civil war known as ‘The Anarchy.’ Read on to learn more about this formidable woman who was willing to fight for the crown she believed belonged to her.\n\n(A 12th-century depiction of Empress Matilda – From: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Empress_Matilda.png)\n\nMatilda was possibly born on the 7th of February, 1102 at Sutton Courtenay, in Berkshire, she was the only legitimate daughter of Henry I, King of England and Duke of Normandy, and his first wife, Matilda of Scotland. Matilda was not an only child, she had a younger, legitimate brother, William Adelin, and thanks to her father’s relationships with numerous mistresses around twenty-two illegitimate siblings! As with many women of this time, little is known about her early life, however, it is believed that she stayed with her mother and was “…taught to read, and was educated in religious morals.” Whilst Matilda was described as being “very beautiful” no detailed description of her physical appearance exists.\n\nDates vary but in either late 1108 or early 1109, Henry V of Germany sent envoys to both of Matilda’s parents proposing he and Matilda marry. Henry saw this as a favourable match as; “…his daughter would be marrying into one of the most prestigious dynasties in Europe, reaffirming his own, slightly questionable, status as the youngest son of a new royal house, and gaining him an ally in dealing with France,” and in return Henry V would receive a dowry of 10,000 marks. Eight year old Matilda began her journey to meet her twenty-four year old fiance in February 1110. The couple met for the first time at Liège before travelling to Utrecht where they became officially betrothed on the 10th of April, and on the 25th of July Matilda was crowned German queen in a ceremony at Mainz. Matilda was placed into the care of Bruno, the archbishop of Trier, who was tasked with “…educating her in German culture, manners and government.” Matilda and Henry married in January 1114.\n\nIn 1112 Henry had arrested his chancellor, Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz, and various other German princes which sparked multiple rebellions, and led Pope Paschal II to excommunicate him. In response Henry, accompanied by Matilda, travelled to Italy in early 1116 “…intent on settling matters permanently with the Pope.” Their arrival in Rome in 1117, caused Pope Paschal to flee, in his absence papal envoy Maurice Bourdin (known now as antipope Gregory VIII), crowned the pair at St Peter’s Basilica. The exact date this took place is unknown but it’s likely the ceremony took place at Easter and again at Pentecost, Matilda used these ceremonies to claim the title of Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. We don’t know much about her life and thoughts on this but chronicles of the time record that she was “…playing a full part in the imperial government, sponsoring royal grants, dealing with petitioners and taking part in ceremonial occasions.” Whilst Matilda might have embraced the role, her official status was less clear. The Holy Roman Empire was governed by monarchs who, as with Henry V, had been elected King by the major nobles. To become an emperor they need to be crowned by the pope, and whilst Henry V had been crowned by Pope Paschal II in 1111, Matilda was crowned by Maurice Bourdin, who was declared an anti-pope and by the time of the second ceremony had himself been excommunicated. This meant that “…strictly speaking the ceremonies were not imperial coronations but instead were formal crown-wearing occasions.” Despite this, Matilda maintained that she had been officially crowned as the empress in Rome and used the title until her death.\n\nIn 1118, Henry returned to Germany to suppress further rebellions, leaving Matilda in Italy as his regent; there are few sources that detail her two year rule, but it’s likely she “…gained considerable practical experience of government.” In 1119, the couple reunited in Lotharingia, where Henry was focused on finding compromise with the Pope, Henry and possibly Matilda attended the Council of Worms where the matter was settled. In 1119 Matilda attempted to visit her father in England, but her journey was blocked by Count Charles I of Flanders, who refused to let her cross his territory, Marjorie Chibnall suggests that “…Matilda had intended to discuss the inheritance of the English crown on this journey.” Opinions vary on if Matilda and Henry had a happy marriage, what is known is their union failed to produce any children, something contemporary chroniclers blamed on Henry and his “…sins against the Church.” Henry died on the 23rd of May, 1125 leaving Matilda in the protection of their nephew Frederick. Matilda, who was twenty-three and childless had only two options; become a nun or remarry. Offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy, taking her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry’s crowns, and the relic of the Hand of St James the Apostle with her.\n\nIn 1120 the English political landscape was dramatically altered with the death of Matilda’s brother, William Adelin in White Ship disaster. With William dead, the line of succession was thrown into chaos. Initially, Henry put his hopes in fathering another son with his second wife Adeliza of Louvain, however, when a new heir failed to materialise Henry began to look at other options including;\n\nStephen of Blois, the son of his sister Adela, for whom he arranged a beneficial marriage to Countess Matilda I of Boulogne.\n\nCount Theobald IV of Blois, William Clito, however, as he was in open rebellion against Henry he was unsuitable.\n\nHis illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, however, it was decided that “…English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.”\n\nEventually, Henry declared that should he not father a son, Matilda was to be his successor. In January 1127, the Anglo-Norman barons swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have as heirs.\n\nIn early 1127 Henry began to look for a new husband for Matilda, and as was the case with the marriages of daughters, he planned to use the marriage to gain political alliance, and therefore, chose to marry her to Geoffrey, the eldest son of Count Fulk V of Anjou. The marriage would allow him to secure the southern borders of Normandy, however, Matilda did not like that match as “…she felt marrying the son of a count diminished her imperial status”, furthermore, Geoffrey was twelve years her junior. It was only thanks to the intervention of Hildebert, the Archbishop of Tours that Matilda agreed. In May 1127, she travelled to Rouen accompanied by Robert of Gloucester and Brian Fitz Count where she was formally betrothed to Geoffrey. Henry knighted his future son-in-law, and the couple married a week later on the 17th of June 1128 in Le Mans. The marriage got off to a rocky start as the couple did not particularly like each other and tensions arose over Matilda’s dowry. Matilda had been given several castles in Normandy by Henry, however, he had not specified when the couple could take possession of them. The couple separated before reconciling in 1131, the same year Henry summoned Matilda to England and had the council give “…another collective oath of allegiance” recognising her as Henry’s heir.\n\nMatilda gave birth to her first son, the future Henry II in March 1133 at Le Mans, followed a year later by another son, Geoffrey. The birth of her second son was difficult, leaving Matilda very ill to the point she wrote her will and argued with her father over where she was to be buried. Matilda wanted to be buried at Bec Abbey, but Henry wanted her to be interred at Rouen Cathedral; in the end it proved moot as Matilda recovered. Matilda and Geoffery began to fear they didn’t have genuine support for their claim to the English throne, so in 1135 they proposed “…the King hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should insist that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her.” Henry angrily refused, possibly because he feared Geoffrey would try and seize power in Normandy. Henry I fell ill and died on the 1st of December, 1135 Lyons-la-Forêt. If he made any deathbed declarations about who was to succeed him it is unknown, however, contemporary sources favourable to Matilda suggested; “Henry had reaffirmed his intent to grant all his lands to his daughter.” In contrast, those in favour of Stephen claimed “Henry had renounced his former plans and had apologised for having forced the barons to swear an oath of allegiance to her.”\n\nMatilda and Geoffrey were in Anjou when they heard news of Henry’s death, they marched into southern Normandy where they “…seized a number of key castles around Argentan that had formed Matilda’s disputed dowry.” They remained there “…pillaging the countryside and facing increased resistance from the Norman nobility and a rebellion in Anjou itself.” At the time Matilda was pregnant with her third child, and historians debate how much this affected her military plans. Stephen of Blois was in Boulogne when he heard the news of Henry’s death, and immediately left for England, accompanied by his military household. Stephen reached London on the 8th of December, where he was proclaimed King by the crowds who believed “…he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return.” Thanks to his brother, Henry of Blois, the bishop of Winchester, Stephen also had the support of the church. Stephen’s coronation was held at Westminster Abbey on the 22nd December 1135.\n\nMatilda gave birth to her third son William on the 22nd July 1136 at Argentan, and spent the next three years establishing her household knights on estates around the area. In early 1136 Geoffrey invaded Normandy, after a brief truce, he invaded again later the same year, “…raiding and burning estates rather than trying to hold the territory.” In 1137, Stephen met with Louis VI and Theobald forming an informal alliance against Geoffrey and Matilda, although not all his endeavours were successful he failed to retake Matilda’s Argentan castles when his Norman forces deserted him. Forced to give up his campaign, Stephen agreed to another truce with Geoffrey, promising to pay him 2,000 marks a year in exchange for peace along the Norman borders. In England Stephen’s reign started off well but it wasn’t long before he faced multiple rebellions. First, Matilda’s uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded the north of England taking Carlisle, Newcastle and other key strongholds. Stephen and his army marched north and met David at Durham, where a temporary compromise was agreed. This was followed by rebellion in South Wales, and two revolts in the south-west led by Baldwin de Redvers and Robert of Bampton. Matilda had not been particularly active in asserting her claims to the throne; it was her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, one of the most powerful Anglo-Norman barons that “…started the descent into civil war in England.” In 1138, Robert renounced his fealty to the King and declared his support for Matilda, triggering a major rebellion in Kent and across the south-west of England. Whilst his forces confronted Stephen’s, Robert remained in “…Normandy trying to persuade the Empress Matilda to invade England herself.”\n\nMatilda’s invasion began in August 1139, but didn’t get off to a good start when Baldwin de Redvers was unable to secure a port to receive her armies. The following month, Matilda’s stepmother, Queen Adeliza, invited Matilda and her forces to land at Arundel. On the 30th of September Matilda accompanied by Robert of Gloucester arrived in England with a force of 140 knights. Matilda stayed at Arundel Castle, while Robert marched north-west hoping to raise support for the rebellion and to link up with Miles of Gloucester, who took the opportunity to renounce his fealty to the King and declare for Matilda. Stephen responded by besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle before agreeing to a truce, whilst the details are unknown, Matilda and her household of knights were released and escorted to the south-west of England, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. It isn’t known why Stephen chose to release Matilda but three main reasons are suggested;\n\nHe believed it better to release her and focus on attacking Robert, who he saw as his main opposition,\n\nArundel Castle was considered almost impregnable, so he didn’t want to risk having to keep his army in the South whilst Robert was building his forces in the West.\n\nLastly, that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; “Stephen had a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.”\n\nMatilda established her court in Gloucester, which was “…still safely in the south-west but far enough away for her to remain independent of her half-brother.” By now, Matilda’s forces controlled a large amount of territory which stretched from Gloucester and Bristol, south into Wiltshire, west into the Welsh Marches and east through the Thames Valley as far as Oxford and Wallingford. It also extended into Devon and Cornwall, but her authority in these areas “…remained limited.” Stephen began his counterattack by Wallingford Castle which controlled the Thames corridor. The castle was held by Brian Fitz Count and Stephen found it too well defended, so continued into Wiltshire to attack Trowbridge, taking the castles of South Cerney and Malmesbury en route before returning east to protect the capital. Henry of Blois held a peace conference at Bath, at which Matilda was represented by Robert, however, the conference collapsed after Henry and the clergy insisted that they should set the terms of any peace deal, something deemed unacceptable by Stephen’s representatives.\n\nThe start of 1141 saw Matilda’s fortunes improve when Ranulf of Chester, a powerful northern magnate, joined her cause after Stephen had placed his castle in Lincoln under siege. Robert of Gloucester and Ranulf advanced on Stephen’s position with a larger force, resulting in the Battle of Lincoln on the 2nd of February 1141. Stephen’s forces were overwhelmed and Stephen was captured. Matilda received Stephen in person at her court in Gloucester, before having him moved to Bristol Castle, which was traditionally used for holding high-status prisoners. With Stephen in custody, Matilda began to take the necessary steps to have herself crowned queen. To do this she needed the support of the Church, as such she made a private deal with Henry that he would deliver the support of the Church in exchange for being granted control over Church affairs. Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury was unwilling to declare Matilda queen before speaking with Stephen, so along with a delegation of clergy and nobles, travelled to Bristol to see Stephen, who agreed that, “…given the situation he was prepared to release his subjects from their oath of fealty to him.” As such, the clergy gathered in Winchester on the 8th of April 1141, declared that Matilda should be monarch in place of Stephen. Matilda assumed the title “Lady of England and Normandy” and all seemed to be going to plan.\n\nThat was about to change as Matilda made her way to London to arrange her coronation; her position became precarious. Not only was the city surrounded by forces loyal to Stephen, but on the 24th of June, the city of London rose up against Matilda forcing her to flee the city and retreat to Oxford. On top of this, her alliance with Henry of Blois came to an end and he transferred his support back to Stephen’s. This led to what is known as the ‘Rout of Winchester’ which saw Robert of Gloucester taken prisoner and Matilda forced to flee to her fortress at Devizes. With both Stephen and Robert held prisoner, negotiations were held to try to come to an agreement on a long-term peace settlement, however, neither side was willing to offer any compromise. In November the two sides simply exchanged the two leaders, and at another church council, Stephen’s legitimacy to rule was established and a fresh coronation of Stephen and Matilda occurred at Christmas 1141.\n\nIn the aftermath of the retreat from Winchester, Matilda rebuilt her court at Devizes Castle in Wiltshire, establishing her household knights on the surrounding estates, supported by Flemish mercenaries, ruling through the network of local sheriffs and other officials. Backed by tRobert of Gloucester, Matilda was “…content to engage in a drawn-out struggle, and the war soon entered a stalemate.” Initially it looked like the balance was tipping in Matilda’s favour after Stephen faced more rebellions, a close call at the Battle of Wilton, and Geoffrey being recognised as Duke of Normandy by Louis VII. Yet, despite these successes, Matilda was unable to consolidate her position, this was compounded by Matilda losing several of her key supporters including Robert of Gloucester who died in 1147. In 1148, Matilda decided to return to Normandy, before re-establishing her court in Rouen, where she was reunited with her sons and husband. Matilda chose to live in the priory of Notre Dame du Pré and “…increasingly devoted her efforts to the administration of Normandy, rather than to the war in England.” As Matilda’s son Henry gained support for his claim to the throne, the church was able to broker peace, Henry recognised Stephen as king, but became Stephen’s adopted son and successor. With Stephen’s death in 1154, Henry assumed the throne becoming Henry II.\n\nMatilda spent the rest of her life in Normandy, where she remained involved in governing Normandy and advising Henry. She was particularly close to her youngest son, William, in 1155 she opposed Henry’s plans to invade Ireland, instead giving the lands to William. As she grew older, Matilda became increasingly focused on the church and her personal faith. She died on the 10th of September 1167 in Rouen, and was buried under the high altar at the abbey of Bec-Hellouin in a service led by Rotrou, the archbishop of Rouen. Her tomb’s epitaph included the lines; “Great by birth, greater by marriage, greatest in her offspring: here lies Matilda, the daughter, wife, and mother of Henry.” Matilda’s tomb was damaged in a fire in 1263 and before being repaired in 1282. It was then destroyed by an English army in 1421, but in 1684 the Congregation of St Maur identified some of her remaining bones and reburied them at Bec-Hellouin in a new coffin. Her remains were lost again after the destruction of Bec-Hellouin’s church by Napoleon, but were found once more in 1846 and this time reburied at Rouen Cathedral, where they remain.\n\nMatilda was an indomitable woman, who was willing to fight for what she believed was her right to rule England. Ultimately, it was not a lack of courage that cost her the crown, but her lack of popularity amongst the people who saw her as “arrogant and haughty” and “… as a foreigner and a woman who was married to one of the hated Angevin enemy.” Yet, it should be argued that Matilda achieved the ultimate triumph in placing her son Henry II on the throne, leading to the Plantagenet dynasty.\n\nWritten by – Gemma Apps.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Empress-Maud\n\nhttps://www.britainexpress.com/History/Stephen_and_Maud.htm\n\nMatilda: Empress, Queen, Warrior by Catherine Hanley."
