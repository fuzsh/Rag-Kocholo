        "text": "Empress Matilda, also known as Empress Maud (c. February 7, 1102–September 10, 1167), the daughter of Henry I of England, is best known in history for the civil war sparked by her fight against her cousin Stephen to win the throne of England for herself and her descendants. She was also a strong-willed and capable ruler in her own right, the wife of the Holy Roman Emperor, and the mother of Henry II of England.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMatilda was born on or about February 7, 1102, as the daughter of Henry I (\"Henry Longshanks\" or \"Henry Beauclerc\"), the Duke of Normandy and King of England. Through her father, Matilda was descended from the Norman conquerors of England, including her grandfather William I, Duke of Normandy and King of England, known as William the Conqueror. Through her mother's mother, she was descended from more kings of England: Edmund II \"Ironside,\" Ethelred II \"the Unready,\" Edgar \"the Peaceable,\" Edmund I \"the Magnificent,\" Edward I \"the Elder\" and Alfred \"the Great.\"\n\nMatilda or Maud?\n\nMaud and Matilda are variations on the same name; Matilda is the Latin form of the Saxon name Maud and was usually used in official documents, especially of Norman origin.\n\nSome writers use Empress Maud as their consistent designation for Empress Matilda. These are useful notes to distinguish this Matilda from the many other Matildas around her:\n\nHenry I had at least one illegitimate daughter also named Maud or Matilda.\n\nRobert, Earl of Gloucester, was married to a Matilda.\n\nThe rival of Empress Matilda for the crown of England was her cousin Stephen, whose wife, also a cousin of the Empress, was also named Maud or Matilda. Stephen's mother, Adela of Normandy, was a sister of Henry I.\n\nThe Empress Matilda's mother was Matilda of Scotland.\n\nMarriage to Henry V\n\nMatilda was betrothed to Henry V, who later became the Holy Roman Emperor, In April 1110, at the age of 8. She later married Henry V and was crowned Queen of the Romans. When Henry V died in 1125, Matilda returned to England at age 23.\n\nMatilda's younger brother William, the heir to the throne of England as her father's only surviving legitimate son, had died when the White Ship capsized in 1120. Her father Henry I, therefore, named Matilda his heir and obtained the endorsement of that claim by the nobles of the realm. At the same time, however, Henry I took a second wife in hopes of fathering another legitimate male heir following the death of his first wife.\n\nMarriage to Geoffrey of Anjou\n\nHenry next arranged a marriage between Matilda and Geoffrey le Bel, often called Geoffrey of Anjou. Geoffrey was 14 and Matilda was 25. He then called upon his good relations with Count Fulk V of Anjou to negotiate the betrothal of Matilda to Fulk’s son Geoffrey le Bel. They were soon married in June 1127.\n\nAfter a brief but tumultuous marriage, Matilda attempted to leave her husband. Geoffrey, however, wanted her to return and, after a royal council, Matilda was sent back to Anjou. At the same time, however, Henry I once again required his nobles to support Matilda as his successor. Geoffrey and Matilda had three sons: Henry II of England, Geoffrey, and William.\n\nDeath of Henry I\n\nMatilda’s father Henry I died in December 1135. Quickly thereafter, Stephen of Blois stepped up to claim Henry's throne. Stephen was Henry's favorite nephew and had been endowed by the deceased king with both lands and riches. Despite having pledged themselves to Matilda, many of Henry's followers reneged on their pledge and followed Stephen, preferring a British male king to a female ruler with a foreign husband. Matilda and her supporters—including Robert of Gloucester and King David I of Scotland—stood up to oppose Stephen, and so began the 19-year civil war known as The Anarchy.\n\nThe Anarchy\"\n\nFor several years between 1138 and 1141, skirmishes between Matilda and Stephen led to castles and lands being taken and lost. Each time one of the contenders seemed to gain the advantage, noblemen changed sides in the war. Finally, in 1141, Matilda captured and imprisoned Stephen. She then made preparations for her coronation in London.\n\nOn her arrival, however, Matilda immediately began imposing taxes and removing privileges from her soon-to-be subjects. These actions were poorly received and, before Matilda could be crowned, Stephen's wife was able to raise an army against Matilda and her supporters.\n\nUnable to defeat Stephen's army, Matilda retreated to Oxford and released Stephen from prison. Stephen was crowned King of England in 1141, and soon thereafter lay siege to Matilda. Matilda escaped across the Thames River to Devizes Castle, where she set up headquarters for several more years of war.\n\nOlder Years\n\nFinally admitting defeat, Matilda returned to France to her husband and son. After Geoffrey's death, she ruled Anjou; at the same time she worked to establish her son Henry II as the heir to the English throne. After Stephen's wife and son died, Henry was able to negotiate succession to the throne with Stephen and, in 1154, Henry was crowned King of England. His wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, became queen.\n\nDeath\n\nMatilda died September 11, 1167, and was buried in Rouen at Fontevrault Abbey. Her tomb stated only that she had been the daughter of King Henry, wife of King Henry, and mother of King Henry.\n\nLegacy\n\nMatilda was an important historical figure whose battle with Stephen had a profound impact on the politics of her time. In addition, as the mother of Henry II (and the person who helped put Henry on the throne) she played an important part in the story of English succession.\n\nSources"
