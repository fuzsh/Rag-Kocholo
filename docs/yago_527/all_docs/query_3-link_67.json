        "text": "Stephen Fry and Elliott Spencer had an immediate connection when they met in 2012.\n\n“We met at a friend’s house and I knew pretty much straight away that this was someone I wanted to spend, what I considered, the rest of my life with,” Fry said on The Jonathan Ross Show in 2015.\n\nThe A Bit of Fry & Laurie star added that he wasn’t sure if Spencer had the same thoughts, making a joke about the age gap between them. “Whether he thought the same because he’s got rather a lot more [life to go than me],” he quipped.\n\nThe two married on Jan. 17, 2015 — around three years after they had first met and two weeks after the proposal — in a small and intimate registry office ceremony in Norfolk, near where Fry grew up.\n\n“Gosh. @ElliottGSpencer and I go into a room as two people, sign a book and leave as one. Amazing.” Fry posted on X (formerly Twitter) alongside a photo of the pair grinning and signing their marriage license.\n\nSo who Stephen Fry's husband? Here’s everything to know about Elliott Spencer and his relationship with the actor.\n\nHe is 30 years Fry’s junior\n\nSpencer was born in 1987, making him almost 30 years junior to Fry, who will turn 67 in August 2024.\n\nFry often makes light-hearted jokes about their age gap, poking fun at himself during interviews.\n\n“There is an age difference and I keep forgetting which way round it is but I think he’s younger than me ... but I don’t mind,“ he said on The Jonathan Ross Show.\n\nSpeaking at the 2015 BAFTAs, which were hosted by Fry, Elliott said that he doesn’t let other people’s opinions on their age gap faze him.\n\n“I don’t care what people think, Stephen is the love of my life, the light of my life.” he said.\n\nFry proposed to Spencer in a restaurant\n\nFry asked Spencer to marry him during a romantic date night at a restaurant in London.\n\nThe Alice in Wonderland star revealed on The Jonathan Ross Show that he suspected his fiancé would say yes, but there was one moment when he thought the meticulously planned proposal may go wrong.\n\n“I kind of knew that he’d say yes, we had kind of danced around the subject [of marriage] and I bought a ring and waited for him to pop off to the loo and put the ring on the prongs of a fork so that he would see it as he started to eat. I thought it would be charming,” he explained. “Of course, he came back and he started chatting and he started playing with the fork and I thought, ‘For God’s sake look at the fork’ — you don’t really ever look at forks do you — and I thought, ‘He’s going to pick it up and the ring is going to fly off into that lady’s soup…’ “\n\nHe added that Spencer caught the ring just in time and called the proposal a “very teary and splendid moment.”\n\nHe and Fry would like to start a family together\n\nIn an interview with The Mirror, Fry stated his desires to start a family with Spencer. The Black Adder star said that one of his biggest regrets is not having any children of his own.\n\n“I have many godchildren now, nieces and nephews, and great-nieces and great-nephews, but I’ll never experience a child growing up. It’s a slight sadness,” he told the outlet. “I mean, that’s probably the biggest hole in my life experience.”\n\nHe explained that he and Spencer had discussed the idea of having a child together, although this is something yet to come into fruition.\n\n“Elliott and I, we talked about it a bit, but we never talked about it to the extent of ‘Right, so, we’re going to a clinic tomorrow to talk this through to some expert,' ” he said. “We never quite got that far. It was always ‘Yeah, it would be nice, wouldn’t it?’ ”\n\nHe works as a comedian, writer and photographer\n\nA multi-talented creative professional, Spencer works as a comedian, writer and photographer.\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror in 2015, he explained that his marriage and photography were his main priorities at the time.\n\n\"I’m just really happy and enjoying being married. It’s all been really exciting and new. I’m not really doing anything else,” he said. “I’m focusing on photography now rather than comedy, and being creative. I’m hoping to hold an exhibition so Stephen and all our friends can see my work.”\n\nHe and Fry like to travel\n\nThe couple are fond of traveling and have visited many exciting places together.\n\nIn 2017, Spencer tweeted a photo of the two of them exploring the Grand Canyon.\n\n“#GrandCanyon” he simplycaptioned the post, adding a black-and-white photo of the pair posing at the National Park.\n\nVacations with famous friends are also a regular part of the pair’s relationship. In 2014, Spencer shared a photo of himself and Fry with actress Emma Thompson in a restaurant in Florence.\n\n“Pretty amazing evening tonight in lovely company in Florence!” he wrote.\n\nSpencer and Fry honeymooned in Honduras, but the trip was unfortunately cut short due to an experience with homophobia.\n\n“We had a problem when we visited Honduras on holiday,\" Spencer told Daily Mail, as per The Independent, of their honeymoon to the country. \"It was homophobia. I don’t want to go into detail, but we had to leave.\"\n\nHe supported Fry during his prostate cancer treatment\n\nFry, who had his prostate removed after being diagnosed with prostate cancer, credited his husband for helping him through his diagnosis and treatment.\n\nOn the grading system used to determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer known as the Gleason Score, doctors labeled him a 9 out of 10.\n\n“This was quite an aggressive little bugger,” Fry said in a video shared in 2018. “As far as we know, it’s all been got. … I won’t know for sure until my PSA levels are checked. They should be 0 now because I have no prostate. But if there is anything left on the bed of the prostate, then I’ll need radiotherapy and the whole damn process will start again,”"
