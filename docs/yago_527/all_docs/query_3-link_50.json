        "text": "STEPHEN Graham has seen his star soar over the last decade, and has now cemented his name in Hollywood.\n\nBut he isn't the only famous face in his family, as his wife Hannah Walters is also a much-sought after actress.\n\nWho is Stephen Graham's wife Hannah Walters?\n\nBorn on July 12, 1976, Hannah Walters is an actress and producer.\n\nShe is best known for starring in Channel 4's This Is England in 2006, and in Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales in 2017.\n\nHannah also played DC Megan Riley in Whitechapel in 2009.\n\nIn 2023, she starred in Channel 4 drama Boiling Point alongside her husband.\n\nWhen did Stephen Graham and Hannah Walters get married?\n\nHannah married her husband Stephen Graham on June 6, 2008.\n\nThe pair met when they were in training at the Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance.\n\nGrowing closer in 2006, while filming the British drama This Is England, they chose to tie the knot two years later.\n\nStephen told Entertainment Daily that the two of them were friends before they started their relationship.\n\nMeanwhile in 2021, Hannah told The Mirror: “Twenty-eight years we’ve known each other. I’m going to be honest - the secret is that it’s me fancying my best mate.”\n\nShe added: “I want to kill him at times… but I just adore him.”\n\nDo they have children?\n\nTogether Hannah and Stephen have welcomed two children.\n\nThe couple have a son named Alfie, and a daughter called Grace.\n\nThe family live together in Ibstock, Leicestershire.\n\nWhat TV shows and films have Stephen and Hannah appeared in together?\n\nThe couple often appear alongside each other, and have starred in multiple projects together.\n\nShe starred alongside him in Shane Meadows's This Is England, This Is England '88 and This Is England '90, where she played Trudy.\n\nOther productions they have both appeared in together include Boiling Point, Walk Like A Panther, Funny Cow, and Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\n\nSpeaking of how his wife helps him prepare for his roles, Stephen told a press conference in 2020: \"I'm dyslexic so I struggle. My missus reads the script and says whether or not I'm doing it.\n\n\"She's made some good choices.\"\n\nThe couple also appeared alongside each other the gritty BBC One prison drama, Time.\n\nOn the series, Stephen played prison guard Eric McNally, while Hannah played his character's wife Sonia McNally.\n\nSpeaking about getting the role, Hannah revealed to Radio X that she was embarrassed when her husband put her forward for the part of his on-screen wife.\n\nBut she said that she got the job as they had \"quite good chemistry\", before joking: \"It would have been shocking if we didn't!\"\n\nSpeaking in an online Q&A about Time, the actor said of his wife: “I watched Hannah back in the day at drama school and always thought she was brilliant.”"
