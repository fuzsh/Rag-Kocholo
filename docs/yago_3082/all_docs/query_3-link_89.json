        "text": "Ulaganayagan Kamal Haasan and director Shankar teamed up once again for the highly anticipated sequel to their 1996 blockbuster Indian (Bharateeyudu). Titled Indian 2 (Bharateeyudu 2), the film hit theaters on July 12, 2024. However, despite the anticipation, the movie received negative reviews and failed to perform well at the box office.\n\nNow, Indian 2 is available for streaming on Netflix. Audiences who missed its theatrical release or wish to watch it again can stream the film in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam, with English subtitles.\n\nThe movie features a stellar cast, including Siddharth, Rakul Preet Singh, Priya Bhavani Shankar, SJ Suryah, and Bobby Simha in key roles. Produced by Lyca Productions in association with Red Giant Movies, the film’s music is composed by the acclaimed Anirudh Ravichander. Stay tuned for more OTT updates.\n\nClick here for Review\n\nArticles that might interest you:"
