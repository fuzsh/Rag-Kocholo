        "text": "by Vidhu Balakrishnan\n\nToday I am going to write about an actor who started off doing supporting roles in Tamil films.Though he was very talented he just couldn’t make it as a hero in Tamil films.Luckily for him the Malayalam film Industry bailed him out.He was cast as a hero opposite Bengali actress Rita Bhaduri in Director K.S.Sethumadhavan’s Kanyakumari.This film got him a Filmafare award for the best actor in Malayalam in the year 1974.He had earlier acted as a child artiste with the same director K.S.Sethumadhavan in Kannum Karalum.\n\nIt was in the year 1960 that he started off as a child artiste.He was just four years old when he won the President’s Gold Medal as a child artiste for his performance in Director Bhim Singh’s Kalathur Kannamma.The film was later remade in Hindi as Main Chup Rahungi.He acted in five more films as a child artiste.During this period he acted with legends like M.G.Ramachandran,Sivaji Ganesan,Gemini Ganesan and Sathyan.\n\nIn the year 1975 his mentor Director K.Balachander cast him as a hero in Apoorva Ragangal opposite Srividya where he played the role of a young man in love with an older woman.Kamal Haasan again won the Filmfare award for the best actor,this time for a Tamil film.The film also saw the arrival of yet another young actor called Rajinikanth who later went on to become a huge star in his own right.\n\nThis was followed by some memorable films like Manmadha Leelai,Oru oodhapu kann simittugirudhu,Moondru Mudichi,Avargal,16 vayadhinile,Nizhal Nijamagiradhu,Ilamai oonjal aadigiradhu,Sattam En Kayyil,Sigappu Rojakal,Aval Appadithan,Kalyanaraman,Meendum Kokila,Vazhveymayam to name a few.\n\nHe also acted in the Malayalam blockbuster Madhanotsavam opposite Zarina Wahab.Kamal Haasan was now a huge star with a string of successful films and numerous awards under his belt.This was when his mentor K.Balachander decided to make a Telugu film with him called Maro Charithra opposite Newcomer Saritha.The film smashed all box office records.Though this was a Telugu film it had a one year run at Safire Theater in Madras.\n\nMaro Charitra was remade by K.Balachander in Hindi as EK Duuje Ke Liye with Rati Agnihotri replacing Saritha.This film was also a box office success.Kamal Haasan had arrived on the national scene.Ek Duje Ke Liye was followed by Sanam Teri Kasam,Yeh To kamal Ho Gaya,Do Dil Diwane,Ek Nai Paheli,Zara Si Zindagi,Yaadgar,Geraftaar and a few other Hindi movies.He acted with Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia in Ramesh Sippy’s Saagar.He received the Filmfare award for the best actor in a Hindi film in Saagar but slowly he started drifting away from Hindi films and started concentrating in Tamil films.\n\nKamal Haasan’s 100th film was Raja Parvai directed by Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao.He penned the story and also produced the film co starring Madhavi. L.V.Prasad the producer of Kamal’s first Hindi film Ek Duuje Ke Liye had a memorable role in Raja Parvai.Though it did not set the box office on fire it was a beautiful film.Kamal received the Filmfare award for his performance as a blind violinist.His silent film Pushpak dirceted by Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao was said to be India’s first full length silent film.This film was a commercial success and also bagged a few awards with Kamal Haasan bagging a Filmfare award.\n\nKamal Haasan also had some memorable films in Telugu like Sagara Sangamam and Swathi Muthyam directed by K.Viswanath.While he received the Filmfare award for Sagara Sangaman it was the Nandi award for Swathi Muthyam.\n\nIn the year 1983 Kamal Haasan won his first National award for Moondram Pirai directed by Balu Mahendra.Kamal’s portrayed a school teacher who rescues a woman suffering from amnesia from a brothel.Sridevi played the woman suffering from amnesia.When it was pointed out by someone that the climax lacked logic Director Balu Mahendra said,”believe me there is no logic in life.”Haasan had earlier done a Kannada film called Kokila with Balu Mahendra.\n\nHaasan also bagged the National award for Nayagan in 1988.The film was directed by Mani Ratnam.His role of Velu Naiker was loosely based on the life of Bombay don Varadaraja Mudaliar.It was inspired by the English film The Godfather.Saranya played Kamal Haasan’s wife in Nayakan.\n\nHis third National award was for Shankar’s Tamil film Indian in 1997.Indian had the beautiful Manisha Koirala,Urmila Matondkar and Sukanya as heroines All three films were successful at the box office.\n\nIn 1994 Haasan had acted in a film called Mahanadhi.The film was influenced by Les Miserables.This film was said to be one of the saddest films ever made in Tamil.The film won three National awards.On the centenary of Indian cinema Forrbes included Haasan’s performance in the film on its list of 25 greatest acting performances of Indian Cinema.\n\nIn 1964 the great Sivaji Ganesan acted in a film called Navaratri where he donned a record nine roles.It was the 100th film of the thespian.The same film was remade 10 years later in 1974 as Naya Din Nayi Raat with actor Sanjeev Kumar.In 2008 Kamal Haasan broke that record when he donned 10 roles in Dasavatharam and we all know that only Kamal Haasan could have done that.Though panned by critics the film had a 100 day run and fetched Haasan the Tamil Nadu State award.\n\nWinning awards was a habit for Kamal Haasan but surprisingly the film which set the box office on fire in his entire career was the 1982 blockbuster Sakala Kala Vallavan which was a silver jubilee hit.It was a typical commercial film with music by maestro Ilayaraja.The song Ilamai Idho Idho is still played every year on the 1st of January.\n\nIn the South Indian Film Industry Kamal Haasan is known as Sakala Kala Vallavan.He is a master of all trades when it comes to films.He can act,dance,fight,sing,write,direct as well as produce.Films are a passion for him.No wonder he is called an encyclopedia of films.This evergreen hero has been in the industry for 55 years which not many can boast off.We have seen actors come and go but the incredible Kamal Haasan has managed to survive for over five decades.This speaks volumes of the man’s talent.\n\nSome of his memorable films of his off late are Unaipol Oruvan,Vishwaroopam and Papanasam.While Unaipol Oruvan was the remake of the Hindi film A Wednesday which had Naseerudin Shah in the lead role Papanasam was the remake of the Malayalam film Drishyam which had Mohanlal as the hero.Vishwaroopam despite the controversies had a 100 day run.\n\nNo commercially successful actor can boast of four national awards.He also has 19 Filmfare awards and a few State awards.We would definitely like to thank directors like K.S.Sethumadhavan and K.Balachander for having played a big role in the early stages of Haasan’s career.All of us would love to see this legend in a variety of roles in the years to come."
