        "text": "In July, actor Kamal Haasan announced that he would be collaborating with director H Vinoth of Valimai and Thunivu fame on a film. Tentatively titled KH233, the film will be bankrolled by Haasan’s Raaj Kamal Films International, with him being the producer along with R Mahendran. The team also released an announcement video with illustrations of Kamal Haasan leading a group of people. The tagline of the film read: Rise to Rule.\n\nNow, the makers released an update. In a short video on Instagram, the makers revealed that Kamal Haasan has begun tactical training for the film. It shows Haasan in an arms range and practising shooting with multiple guns, even handling shotguns and machine guns. The tagline of the video read, ‘Guts and Guns’, which hints at the film also being high on action, much like the actor’s previous Vikram.\n\nKH233 will be Kamal Haasan’s next film after the release of Shakar’s Indian 2. After his project with H Vinoth, Haasan is expected to start working on his film with Mani Ratnam. Titled KH234, the film will mark the duo reuniting after over three decades. They first collaborated on the crime drama Nayagan. A R Rahman is set to score music for the film."
