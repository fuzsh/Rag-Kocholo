        "text": "We spent a lot of time discussing cinema and life. He would sometimes get philosophical about the inconsequentiality of life. Once we went to a movie together. It was a mediocre American film called The Swarm, and I decided to take him to a theatre in the heart of the city. He didn’t know we were going to a public screening. He probably hadn’t been to a public theatre since he became a star. When we reached things were okay. He enjoyed the mediocre film thoroughly and refused to leave until the end titles. That’s when I panicked. This was Rajesh Khanna, THE star of the millennium. If audiences got to know he was present there would be a stampede and blood on my hands. But Mr Khanna refused to listen. He stayed on till the end. The inevitable happened after the show. All hell broke loose as audiences realised he was there. I became THE Rajesh Khanna’s bodyguard and security officer as I took him through the crowd. His shirt was torn. But he was enjoying himself thoroughly. He giggled and chuckled like a child.\n\nKamal Haasan\n\nThis was the era of the landline phones. My personal assistant, a big Rajesh Khanna fan, was over the moon as god himself asked him about his wellbeing. Mr Khanna announced he was doing a remake of my film Sigappu Rojjakal, and that the mahurat was the very next day, and would I please send him the cap that I wore for my character, since he wanted to wear it at the event and in the film. I agreed. Who says no to Rajesh Khanna?! He also commanded me to be present at the mahurat in Mumbai the next day. I protested saying that I wasn’t needed. He insisted. He wanted to introduce me as the upcoming star from the south. Anyway the cap was sent from Chennai to Mumbai by hand delivery (there was no courier those days) by a man who unfortunately turned out to be a fan of both Rajesh Khanna and Kamal Haasan.\n\nKamal Haasan"
