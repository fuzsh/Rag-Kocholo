The interesting film turned out to be a blockbuster hit and it's one of the top-rated Tamil films. 'Thevar Magan' rules social media as the film clocked 30 years recently, while fans and stars recall their best memories about the film. Here is a look at five reasons why the Kamal Haasan-starrer is a blockbuster hit.\n\nOfficial! Karthi's 'Sardar' to have a sequel\n\nImage Courtesy - Twitter\n\nSivaji Ganesan played an important role as a village head and Kamal Haasan's father in 'Thevar Magan'. The legendary actor stole fans' hearts with his amazing performance and his dialogues took a dig at casteism. Sivaji Ganesan also displayed how a father wishes to see his son take over his charge and his dialogues with Kamal Haasan are more popular and emotional. But the expert actor disappears in the middle as the story moves on and his death scene will leave you in tears.\n\nAshok Selvan's 'Nitham Oru Vaanam' censored 'U'; film to release on November 4th\n\nImage Courtesy - Twitter\n\nKamal Haasan played a character of two different shades, who wishes to become a businessman and takes over the responsibility of his father due to unavoidable reasons. Kamal Haasan sported two different looks for the film, and the actor's transformation after Sivaji Ganesan's is purely magical. Kamal Haasan voiced against casteism through the film and his meaningful words brought some change among fans in real life.\n\nMysskin to play an important role in Vijay's 'Thalapathy 67'?\n\nImage Courtesy - Twitter\n\nRevathi played the role of Kamal Haasan's wife in 'Thevar Magan' and her role in the film is an innocent one. Revathi's life changed minutes after Kamal Haasan decided to marry her after the groom he arranged for the actress ran away due to some reason. Revathi impressed the audience to strike better than the other female lead Gautami, who played Kamal Haasan's girlfriend in the film.\n\n'Prince' box office collection day 5: Sivakarthikeyan's romantic comedy continues to drop\n\nImage Courtesy - Twitter\n\nNassar played the antagonist against Kamal Haasan, and he gave a tough battle to make the film more interesting. Even though we have seen Kamal Haasan and Nassar in hero and villain roles in several films, their combination in 'Thevar Magan' is a special one as they play cousin brothers. Nassar attempts to dethrone Kamal Haasan and his family to become the head of the village, but all his plans go in vain and he loses his life in the end.\n\nPC Sreeram reveals the secret behind the success of 'Thevar Magan' as the Kamal Haasan starrer completes 30 years\n\nImage Courtesy - Twitter\n\nApart from the story, direction, and performances, it's Ilaiyaraaja's music that added power to the film. The legendary composer delivered music of different emotions and made the film speak through his music rather than words. Especially the song 'Vanam Thottu Pona' that appears during Sivaji Ganesan's death scene in the film will make you emotional and get connected deeply to the film.\n\n'Sardar' box office collection day 5: Karthi's spy thriller hits the 50 crore mark\n\nImage Courtesy - Twitter"
