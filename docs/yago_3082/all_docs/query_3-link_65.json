        "text": "Veteran actor Kamal Haasan is set to achieve a remarkable milestone in his illustrious career with four film releases hitting theaters within just six months.\n\nThe last time the Tamil cinema legend had such a packed release calendar was in 1989, when three of his films—Chankayan (Malayalam), Vetri Vizha (Tamil), and Indrudu Chandrudu (Telugu)—premiered within six months of each other.\n\nAlso Read – Harish Shankar: Biggest Culprit Behind Mr. Bachchan’s Negativity\n\nIn 2024, Haasan is poised to break his own record. The 68-year-old superstar has an impressive lineup with Kalki 2898 AD, Indian 2, and Thug Life set for release in the coming months.\n\nAccording to the latest reports, the sequel to Indian 2, Indian 3, is also going to arrive in the next 6 months, most probably on January 26, 2025.\n\nAlso Read – Heroine’s Failed Experiment: Will Prabhas Save?\n\nKalki 2898 AD, a futuristic sci-fi film directed by Nag Ashwin, will debut on June 27, generating immense buzz for Haasan’s lead role in this visually stunning spectacle.\n\nFollowing closely will be the long-awaited Indian 2 in July. The sequel to Haasan’s 1996 blockbuster Indian has been in production for years, featuring massive sets and an ensemble cast including Kajal Aggarwal and Siddharth.\n\nAlso Read – Vijay’s “GOAT” Trailer: Very Bad Response!\n\nRecently, Kamal Haasan revealed, “I agreed to do Indian 2 because Shankar told me the story of Indian 3 along with it.”\n\nAdditionally, Haasan will star in the highly-anticipated Thug Life, directed by the legendary Mani Ratnam, set to release in December 2024. Filming is currently underway in Delhi for this ambitious crime drama.\n\nKamal Haasan is doing another project with action directors Anbariv tentatively titled ‘KH 237’ is also going on the floors soon. Then there is Vikam 2 in the pipeline.\n\nFor an actor of Haasan’s stature to have four major releases within such a short span is unprecedented.\n\nOptimistic trade pundits are already predicting great box office numbers, given the buzz surrounding each project."
