Adding to the excitement, the lead actor and the film’s director have confirmed plans for a third installment ahead of the release of the second part of the franchise. This announcement has further piqued fans’ curiosity, especially regarding how Indian 2 will set the stage for the next sequel.\n\nWith a tagline of Zero Tolerance, Kamal Haasan will reprise his role as Senapathy in the sequel. The film has been in production since 2019 but faced significant delays due to an on-set accident in 2020. The pandemic caused further delays. However, despite these challenges, the makers have scheduled Indian 2 to premiere in theaters on July 12, 2024.\n\nIndian 3 release date window revealed\n\nDuring the IPL match between CSK and RCB, lead actor Kamal Haasan and director S. Shankar revealed some intriguing insights about the second and third installments. Kamal said, “I agreed to do Indian 2 because Shankar told me the story of Indian 3 along with it.” This statement has further fueled speculation among fans. The duo confirmed that the third part will hit theaters just six months after the sequel’s release. The makers are reportedly planning to release Indian 3 around the Pongal 2025. However, they have not yet disclosed the exact release date yet.\n\nAccording to Pinkvilla, a recent source confirmed that makers will attach the trailer for Part 3 with the Part 2 trailer. The source stated, “A crisp theatrical trailer of Indian 3′ will be attached to Indian 2. It will form a part of the end credits of this action-packed film. The team also intends to announce the release date of Indian 3 with Indian 2. The sequel of this 1997 cult classic ends on a cliffhanger, and the trailer for part 3 will amp up the excitement for the release of the finale.” However, an official announcement regarding this is still pending.\n\nAs the Indian 2 release date approaches, it will be intriguing to see how the audience reacts to its theatrical debut."
