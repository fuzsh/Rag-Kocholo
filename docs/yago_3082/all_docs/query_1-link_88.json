        "text": "Udhayanidhi Stalin is a popular actor and his upcoming film Is Maamannan. The film is announced to be the last one in his acting career as he took oath as the Tamil Nadu Assembly minister recently. The film also has 'Vaigai Puyal' Vadivelu in a pivotal role and is helmed by Mari Selvaraj. The actor recently gave an exclusive interview to Galatta Media where he shared some interesting insights about the film and his career. During the audio launch of the film, the director Mari Selvaraj spoke about Thevar Magan and it became the topic of discussion online.\n\nWhen asked about comparisons, Udhayanidhi Stalin said \"everyone likes Thevar Magan, still, we are discussing it. At that time, the songs from the film and scenes, actors such as Sivaji sir and Vadivelu screen presence were admired by many. That film and this film do not have any connection. But, what if, The Esakki character that Vadivelu sir played in the film, could be continued? The film (Thevar Magan) does not talk about caste, or against caste or praise it. It was about a family. But here it will be Mari Selvaraj's film that will speak about social justice.\" He then explained that Mari Selvaraj also said on stage that it was an imagination of how it will be if that Esakki character was present and confirmed there was no connection between the two films.\n\nThe actress Udhayanidhi Stalin then spoke about his career choices and said from Oru Kal Oru Kannadi, he thought people only wanted to see him in comedy roles and kept doing that. \"Then after Manithan I though what difference there in the film for me and the scope of it, Be it Nenjukkyu Needhi or Kalaga Thalaivan\", said the actor. He said the most intense film he has done is Maamannan that it was the most contrast to Oru Kal Oru Kannadi."
