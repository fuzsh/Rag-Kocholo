        "text": "Actor Kamal Haasan has officially announced a sequel to Thevar Magan (1992), which is regarded as one of the finest films in Tamil cinema.\n\nWritten by Kamal Haasan and directed by Malayalam filmmaker Bharathan, Thevar Magan won five National awards and was selected as India’s official entry to the Oscars. The film has a cult following, thanks to its strong storyline, brilliant performances by veteran actor Sivaji Ganesan, Kamal Haasan, Nassar and Revathi, and music by Ilaiyaraaja.\n\nDespite critical acclaim, the film has been criticised for glorifying one particular community. Kamal Haasan was last seen in the espionage-thriller Vishwaroopam 2 . A sequel to the 2013 film, Vishwaroopam 2 failed to meet the expectations of critics and audiences alike. According to reports, Kamal Haasan will begin work on Thevar Magan 2 after wrapping up his forthcoming film Indian 2 , with filmmaker Shankar. The actor also has Sabaash Naidu , an action-comedy starring Shruti Haasan, Ramya Krishnan and Brahmanandam in lead roles."
