        "text": "Ulaganayagan Kamal Haasan announced that he would discontinue from acting soon to focus on his political career with conviction and focus. His next film with director Shankar, Indian 2, bankrolled by Lyca Productions was expected and touted to be his last film. However, Kamal Haasan just made a pleasant surprise by announcing that he'd be doing one more film.\n\nThe even more exciting part comes only now as the Dasavatharam actor revealed that it would be the sequel of his cult classic film, Thevar Magan. In his recent interview, Kamal Haasan officially announced that Thevar Magan 2 is on the cards and he would complete his film acting career with these two sequels (Indian 2 and Thevar Magan 2).\n\nThis will be his third sequel in a row after Vishwaroopam 2 and Indian 2. More details regarding the rest of the cast and crew are expected to be announced in the coming days. It should be recalled that there were speculations and rumours already on the said project, and the man himself has made it official."
