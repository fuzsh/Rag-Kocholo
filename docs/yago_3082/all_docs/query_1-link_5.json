I would call this film as a masterclass in writing, people should actually learn writing by watching this. All credits goes to the pioneer aandavar!\n\nThe word 'Thevar' in the title stirs up many leftists making them think that it's a casteist film but that's actually the exact opposite. This film opposes the extremist casteism and casteism as a whole. Many dialogues throughout the film suggests it. Sakthivel stays the same from the beginning to the end, he doesn't want to be a…\n\nThis movie is everything that nayakan wanted to be , this follows the story of the complete destruction of a feudal elitist family who ruled the village , to the core as egos get hold of them .\n\nEvery character is well written and has multiple layers unfold as the film progresses. Kamal Hassan playes the younger lad who returns to the village after being abroad. Eventho he tries his best to act progressive by submissing his thoughts in front of his gf , we get to see that he's no different from his fam as he's a spoilt privileged brat who thinks he can fix everything but in reality is just a fool. He keeps trying to make himself…\n\nVery problematic film when it comes to caste, factions and its representation in Tamil cinema as a whole, but pretty seamlessly perfect if you view it as the template family drama. Whole caste issue is discussed in detail and in concise manner wrt Gramsci etal here.\n\nHighly problematic is its view of Dalits and south as an arena of sickle violence, the truth was it is always art imitates life and viceversa equilibrium. I mean its a film of contradiction, for a film which decries honor and all killing associated with it ends in it, decries and at the same time glamorises the same thing it despises, hate and misinformation or here partially cooked info can travel faster, it decries…\n\nVedhai vedhachonae Pazham sapdanum nu aasai pada mudiyuma. Innaikku naa vedhaikkraen, naalaikku nee sapduva, apram un magan sapduvan, apram avan magaen. Ithellam irunthu paaka naa irukka maatan aana vedhai naa pottadhu. Ithellam enna perumai aa, kadamai ovvoruthanoda kadamai.\n\nThevan aa irukkrathu mukkiyama manushana irukkrathu mukkiyama.\n\nPothum da ethukittathulaam pothum da, pongada poi vivasayam paarunga da, pulla kuttyngala padikka veinga da.\n\nEternally quotable. Have seen the film multiple times over the years that by this point every bgm beat, every actor's dialogue modulation is by heart for me. Have been seeing the film since childhood, while I was always amazed by it but never was totally immersed in the gravitas of it's emotions coz of my age. Something new happened while…\n\nRewatched to see how it holds up.\n\nI loved the movie very much the first time I watched it. I was instantly hooked to the hero's journey and the Godfatheresque story. But it has the same issue as Godfather 2 - doesn't impress me on rewatch ( Like Peter Griffin says I didn't care about it). The second half has lot of jarring issues which is very evident because of how contrastingly the tight screenplay is written for the beginning of the movie. A lot of the scenes just drag on and on, example Gauthami coming to visit again. Also Tamil Padam 2 ruined the ending for me, I can't watch this with a straight face without thinking about Siva…\n\nSivaji Ganesan and Kamal Haasan. Two of the greatest actors of all time from Tamil Cinema to grace Indian Celluloid ever. Helmed by veteran filmmaker from Malayalam Cinema, Bharathan. Music by Ilaiyaraaja. DOP by P. C. Sreeram. Written by Kamal Haasan himself. There's so much talent involved in Thevar Magan, and the output is of epic proportions.\n\nGoes right up among the finest performances by Kamal Haasan and is a testimonial to the actor's extensive prowess, that which makes him the legendary jack of all trades. There are so many (so very many!) memorable moments in this film that I just couldn't pick one as the singular best. Not to mention, the film has got one of the very best…"
