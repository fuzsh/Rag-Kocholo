        "text": "Kamal Haasan is often called a film institute himself and is called ‘Ulganayagan’ or ‘The Universal Hero’ for his excellent versatility.\n\nOver the years, he has given multiple cult classics, such as Ek Duje Ke Liye, Indian, Vishwaroopam and more, but did you ever wonder that despite being so talented, he could never be a part of Bollywood films?\n\nIn an interaction with India Today, Kamal Haasan said, “The times... those times were like that. I was a poorer cousin of Hindi cinema. I had to do my own laundry and stuff like that. They were really spoiled and rich. They could make one film for two and a half years and they could do 6 films at a time. I thought that was very defeating in character-building, both morally and technically speaking. That was one of the reasons.”\n\nHe further added, “The other reason was there were too many underworld connections. I didn't want to stay there to either oppose it or succumb to the threat. I was one of the actors to decide that I would not have anything to do with black money.”\n\nUpon being asked whether an actor can go big without corruption, Kamal Haasan said, “It is, I'm living proof of it. I'm quite happy. I drove in a car. It is quite possible. Someone else did it earlier. Cameraman Vincent. He never touched black money. It was much before any government threatened him to not keep black money. My brother and I made that call.\"\n\nWell, Kamal might have stated multiple reasons why he left Bollywood, but did you know that he was once considered a threat to Bollywood actors?\n\nAccording to older articles, headlined, “Kamal Haasan: A Threat To Bombay Heroes?” and “Why The Bombay Heroes Hate Kamal Haasan Guts?” you can clearly imagine the insecurity the top-shelf actors must be feeling against Kamal Haasan.\n\nOne of the articles written by Jyothi Venkatesh stated, “Like a hurricane, the Madrasi boy breezed in on film scene in the tinsel town of Bombay with his maiden venture - Ek Duje Ke Liye - and swept the entire country off its feet, winning accolade after accolade. The adulation which was Amitabh Bachchan’s after he worked in ten films became Kamal Haasan’s after just a single hit in Bombay. Overnight, Kamal became something of an irresistible one film celebrity.”\n\nOne of the Reddit users wrote, “I recently saw an interview of a Tamil film director & producer who was active during 1980-1990 and now a journalist. He revealed a shocking news about bollywood film industry secretly banning Kamal Haasan from doing Hindi films. When kamal hassan started doing Hindi films, he gained apprecition and popularity in less number of films like Ek Duuje Ke Liye, etc which made other bollywood lead actors feel insecured. When kamal hassan gained a lot of applause for his acting in movies like Sadma and Sagar, Amitabh Bachchan and other top heroes silently threatened bollywood producers and directors by asking them not to cast kamal hassan anymore in hindi films. Those films were kamal hassan's last straight hindi film and no other director or producer has approached kamal hassan after that, however KH returned to bollywood with Chachi 420 by directing it himself. After that all his films were only dubbed and released simultaneously in hindi like Hey Ram, Aalavandhan as Abhay, Mumbai express, Vishwaroopam and Vishwaroop.”"
