        "text": "Director Mari Selvaraj, who is awaiting the release of Maamannan, is back in the news after his bold speech on Kamal Haasan's Thevar Magan went viral. At the audio launch of Maamannan on June 1, Mari spoke against Kamal Haasan's Thevar Magan and the impact the film had on him, in his presence. He said that he did not know whether the film was right or wrong. His speech has started a debate on Twitter with people supporting their favourites.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMARI SELVARAJ'S SPEECH ON THEVAR MAGAN GOES VIRAL\n\nMari Selvaraj's Maamannan is gearing up for a grand release on June 29. The makers unveiled the film's trailer recently.\n\nThe audio launch of Maamannan, which saw Kamal Haasan as the guest, took place on June 1. The event was telecast on TV recently and Mari's speech went viral on social media. He spoke about Thevar Magan in Kamal Haasan's presence.\n\nSpeaking at the event, he said, \"Thevar Magan is considered a masterpiece today. I'm sure every director would have watched it before making films. I did the same before every film of mine. When I watched it for the first time, I was left in a dilemma. I did not understand whether the film was right or wrong. I was in conflicting minds.\"\n\nHe further added that Maamannan is a continuation of Thevar Magan. Vadivelu's character in Thevar Magan, which is Esakki, was his inspiration to model his role in Maamannan.\n\nHe explained further and said, \"I wanted to see my father fit into this world. I made Maamannan for my father. Vadivelu, who played Esaki in Thevar Magan, is a maamannan (king of kings). Esaki's transformation into a maamannan is the story of my film, Maamannan.\"\n\nMari Selvaraj also revealed that he watched Thevar Magan before making his films, Pariyerum Perumal and Karnan. He further added that he watched it before making Maamannan as well.\n\n\"Maamannan is a result of all the pain, distress and the positive and negative emotions I experienced after watching Thevar Magan,\" he shared.\n\nHere's the trailer of Maamannan:\n\nABOUT THEVAR MAGAN\n\nThevar Magan is an iconic film, directed by Bharathan. Apart from starring in the lead role alongside Sivaji Ganesan, Kamal Haasan also wrote the story and produced the film.\n\nThe film chronicles around the lives of Sakthivel Thevar (played by Kamal Haasan) and his father, Periya Thevar (Sivaji Ganesan). Sivaji plays a chieftain and the film explores the caste politics and domination in the village.\n\nHere's a song from Thevar Magan:\n\nWhile Thevar Magan was a huge success, it was also criticised for glorifying the Thevar community.\n\nMARI SELVARAJ'S SPEECH SPARKS A DEBATE\n\nAfter Mari Selvaraj's speech gained traction on social media, many sections of people have been expressing their opinion on Twitter. While some are taking Mari's side, others are fiercely defending Kamal Haasan's Thevar Magan.\n\nFilmmaker CS Amudhan applauded Mari Selvaraj for speaking his mind in front of Kamal Haasan. He wrote, \"That Mari speech was a watershed moment, it was a man at the pinnacle of his career being true to his soul & despite his adulation & forsaking all the connections he has foraged to call out a legend,it took some balls of steel. Iâ€™ve never seen it happen here. Good times! (sic).\"\n\nCheck out some of the comments on Twitter:\n\nMaamannan features Vadivelu, Udhayanidhi Stalin, Fahadh Faasil and Keerthy Suresh in lead roles. The film, like Mari Selvaraj's previous films, will talk about caste politics."
