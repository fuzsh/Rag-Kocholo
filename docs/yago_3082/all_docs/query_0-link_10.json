        "text": "Kamal Haasan, the Ulaganayagan of Kollywood is known for some pathbreaking movies. One of his most memorable movies where he excelled was Thevar Magan. Kamal shared screen space with none other than Sivaji Ganesan in the movie. The movie became a blockbuster hit and it also received rave reviews from critics and fans alike.\n\nWe already told you that the popularity of the movie sparked talks of a probable sequel to the movie. There was news recently that Kamal was ready with the script of Thevar Magan 2. Kamal is expected to start Thevar Magan after he finished Indian 2.\n\nNow, whenever there is a huge movie with an ensemble cast, there are several movies from the sets that create interest. Now, years after its release there is talk about the movie again.\n\nMalayalam filmmaker Bharathan directed Thevar Magan released way back in 1992. Nasser, Gauthami and Revathi portrayed other key roles in Thevar Magan. We hear that Kamal himself penned the script and he finished it in just a week's time.\n\nThe movie was a such a hit that it ran in theatres for 175 days.\n\nThis was revealed by Kamal Haasan himself in an interview with AR Rahman on social media. He said he was challenged by his friend to finish the script soon or he would walk out. That pressure made him finish the script in record time. But he went on to say that making a script wasn't a cake walk and it needs a lot of work and time. At times it may take years to pen a script.\n\nKamal Haasan is expected to resume shooting for the Indian sequel after the lockdown ends. After that he is expected to take Thevar Magan 2 to the sets. The pre-production work is underway and the movie is expected to be shot in the scenic locales of Pollachi in Kerala."
