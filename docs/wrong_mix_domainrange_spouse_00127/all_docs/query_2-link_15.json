        "text": "If you’ve never had the unique and brain-melting privilege of living in Los Angeles, you might not be familiar with the cultural icon that is Angelyne. Where to begin? She’s basically like Barbie, if Barbie drove a hot pink Corvette and smiled seductively down at you from billboards across the City of Angels.\n\nIn 2017, the real identity of the mysterious pop-culture icon—who began appearing on L.A. billboards in the early 1980s and quickly became a pink-accessorized, bleached-blonde emblem of the city itself—was unmasked for the first time by the Hollywood Reporter as Renee Goldberg, the Poland-born daughter of Holocaust survivors who later settled in Israel.\n\nAngelyne has led, by all accounts, a fascinating life, one that’s included a music career, a stint in the visual arts, and a campaign for governor of California. Now, Emmy Rossum will bring it to the small screen in a new limited series for NBC’s streaming service Peacock.\n\nBased on the 2017 Hollywood Reporter article that identified Angelyne as Goldberg, the Peacock series begins production this month. Rossum yesterday shared on Twitter a first look of herself as Angelyne, sporting that white-blonde hair and hot pink outfit.\n\nAngelyne’s heyday came long before Instagram, but in a certain light she can be seen as the original influencer; she turned a tragic past into a brand-new glittery identity as the pouting face of Los Angeles and merchandised it to the heavens. Long before the Kardashians, Angelyne was a living embodiment of all that’s glamorous and ridiculous about L.A., and while this isn’t the first time her story has been told—she was the subject of a 2016 documentary—the series will hopefully help illuminate another side of her.\n\nRossum will executive-produce the series alongside her husband, Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail, and Gary Baum—the Hollywood Reporter senior writer who broke the news of Angelyne's real identity—will serve as a consultant."
