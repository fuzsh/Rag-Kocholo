        "text": "If Annie Hall and Interstellar had a baby incubated in an off-Broadway blackbox theater, it might grow up into something like Comet. The film’s focus is the unpredictable nature of love, mixed in with some vague visual motifs of heavenly bodies and an underdeveloped sci-fi hook shifting us forward and backward through time. Yet despite this formalist flash and filigree, we’re still dealing with a two-hander about a bickering couple. You’ll cheer at their eventual entwining, but less because you’ve fallen in love with the idea of them being in love and more because that’s the cue that this desultory tale has finally found its end.\n\nWhile the story and much of the dialogue is lacking, Comet does have its merits. There’s Justin Long as our male lead, a deserving actor who rarely gets starring roles. It may or may not be a rebuke at his earlier persona as ‘The Mac Guy’, but his character in this film is named Dell. He’s a neurotic, motormouthed genius who works for a pharmaceutical lab and has an uncanny ability to draw correct conclusions about people at a glance. His constant self-doubt, however, often leads him to self-destruct. This is played out in a clever moment early on. We meet him as he’s gathered to view a meteor shower, but he misses the celestial display because he’s so engrossed in wooing a woman.\n\nThat woman is Kimberly (Emmy Rossum) and she’s at the same location – a Los Angeles cemetery/movie theater bathed in filtered lights – but she’s there on a first date with a handsome prig, who she later ditches for Dell. Comet leaps between this scene and four others during the six years of their on-again, off-again affair. Among them are getting reacquainted on a train, breaking up via a bicoastal phone call and Dell’s botched proposal in an indigo-hued Paris hotel room, in which Ms Rossum plays most of the scene in remarkably fetching underclothes. (To not make note of this fact would be to deny one of the film’s most striking attributes.)\n\nComet chooses to spin its story in such a circuitous manner for the sole purpose of allowing its characters to drench one another in waves of philosophical dialogue. They talk about rivers of time, of being in the now or of existing in reflections of what could be. Dell habitually comments on the film as though he were a screenwriter: “Are we in a chase scene?” “Is this like when the main character doesn’t know he’s dead?” These winks are fun to a point but get tiresome when Comet’s individual sequences reveal they have no forward momentum.\n\nWe know the outcome of each chapter except the last one, yet are condemned to return to each to bear witness. While the first scene has some charming and amusing banter, the others don’t have much going for them. Some of the juxtapositions work in the Cloud Atlas style of matching action or cross-cutting on a certain word, but none of this gimmickry can make up for uninteresting characters writhing in a drama too distant to care about."
