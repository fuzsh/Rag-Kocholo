        "text": "It started in January, when burglars boosted hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of jewelry and cash from “Dog Whisperer” Cesar Millan. Then, retired Laker and former Knicks coach Derek Fisher’s Tarzana, Calif., home was hit, with thieves taking $300,000 in jewelry, including five NBA Championship rings. Next up: Someone broke a window in Fabio’s Los Angeles house and walked out with a vault that contained $200,000 in gold and watches.\n\nNicki Minaj, former Laker Nick Young, Emmy Rossum, Jaime Pressly, Amber Rose, Hilary Duff, David Spade, singer Jason Derulo — all were burgled between February and September. Rapper A$AP Rocky had $1.5 million in jewelry stolen from his Beverly Grove home, while Alanis Morissette lost $2 million in jewels from her Brentwood abode.\n\nOn Oct. 19, thieves used a ladder to enter a second-story window at Mariah Carey’s Beverly Hills estate. They took just $50,000 in purses and sunglasses, but one high-end jewelry appraiser said it was a wise move: “A lot of Carey’s jewelry is shaped like butterflies. It wouldn’t be smart to try to resell it, and [the thieves] were prepped enough to know that.”\n\nAnd then there’s Dodgers right fielder Yasiel Puig. Adding insult to injury, his home was broken into while he and his team were losing Game 7 of the World Series on Nov. 1 — months after burglars swiped $500,000 in jewelry from another of his homes.\n\nThe crime spree is giving Hollywood flashbacks to 2008 and 2009, when a group of teens known as “The Bling Ring” ransacked more than $3 million in jewelry and designer goods from celebrity mansions.\n\nBut, according to a representative in the West Los Angeles precinct of the LAPD, the Bling Ring was “junior level compared to what’s going on now.”\n\nFor one thing, the members of the Bling Ring were motivated by an obsession with stars and wanting to live — and dress — like them. They stole Rolex watches, Louis Vuitton luggage and anything bearing a Chanel, Gucci, Prada or Yves Saint Laurent logo from Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Orlando Bloom, Megan Fox and others.\n\nAccording to LA Sheriff’s Department Detective Sgt. Mike Maher, Hollywood’s current star robbers “do not care about Instagram, or which celebs are hot. They don’t know who they’re robbing. They mostly target the biggest houses. They’re only in it for the money . . . it’s a way to fund gangs.”\n\nOne particular street gang that’s been named in police reports is the Rollin’ 30s, which is associated with the Crips. But Maher said that they’re far from the only ones. “They can be Asians, whites, Hispanics or black. Members of rival gangs even work together during the day, then go back to being mortal enemies,” he added.\n\nMaher told The Post that the criminals call themselves “Flockers” based on “Floccin,” a 2011 song and video by rapper Cowboy that celebrates smash-and-grab home break-ins. As the lyrics go, “Ding dong/nobody home/Take the cash . . . and I’m f–kin’ gone.”\n\nLike the Bling Ring, who would find out via the Internet when stars would be at movie premieres or on location, Flockers target times when people tend not to be home.\n\nThe LA Sheriff’s Department has seen a rise in these “ ‘knock-knock’ crimes,” said Maher. “They knock on doors of homes — if there’s no answer, they commence a [burglary]. It’s organized.”\n\n‘LA’s so spread-out it can take 20 minutes or more for the police to show up. These [burglars] are in and out in five minutes.’\n\nPolice say Flockers spend days driving around neighborhoods to survey when residents come and go, and when house staff, such as gardeners, routinely work. A large percentage of 2017’s robberies has occurred during weekdays.\n\nIn almost all the star crimes — including the ones involving Minaj, who lost $200,000 worth of furniture, among other items, and ex-Laker Young, who had half a million dollars taken from a safe — no one was home. But the plan isn’t foolproof. Amber Rose’s house was hit while she was sleeping.\n\nFor the most part, Flockers are all about stealing jewelry. “Once they figured out the price of gold was going up, they realized it’s more lucrative than selling drugs — and faster cash,” Maher said.\n\nIn February, Morissette had two safes containing $2 million in vintage jewels whisked out of her Brentwood home. That same month, similar crimes were committed against actresses Pressly and Duff, as well as “Shameless” star Emmy Rossum and her husband Sam Esmail, the creator of “Mr. Robot,” who lost $150,000 in antique gems. Jewelry and cash were lifted from the Beverly Hills manse of Spade and also Derulo’s Tarzana home.\n\n“Jewelry is the smallest thing you can invest money in that’s portable,” said Kimberly McDonald, jewelry designer to the stars. “That’s why so many stars buy it, [even though they tend to borrow] gems for awards shows. And gold does not depreciate.”\n\nAs for the thieves’ MO, she noted, gold jewelry “is easy to resell. They can’t resell one-of-a-kind pieces or pieces with very large identifiable stones . . . specially designed pieces can be traced or identified. [But they] can take small or midsize diamond or gold pieces and break them down.”\n\nScott Andrew Selby, co-author of “Flawless: Inside the Largest Diamond Heist in History,” noted that, “If it’s just normal jewelry, a thief can pawn it out of state. But if it’s unusual, they have to sell it to a fence [someone who moves stolen goods] for around 10 cents on the dollar. If they grab a hundred grand[’s worth] of gold or diamonds in one [burglary], they might make 10 grand. Bigger pieces might go to Canada or Antwerp [in Belgium] — 80 percent of diamonds end up there.”\n\nMaher claims Flockers go out with an agenda: “They often want to make 60 grand a day, and they’ll sometimes hit it.”\n\nIn August 2009, the members of the Bling Ring — all from in or around the suburb of Calabasas, Calif. — were brought down by acquaintances who ratted them out to police.\n\nRachel Lee, the supposed mastermind, served a year and four months in prison. Alexis Neiers served 30 days and was ordered to pay victim Orlando Bloom $600,000. Courtney Ames did 60 days of community service and got three years of probation. Nick Prugo served a year in jail. Diana Tamayo received 60 days of community service and three years of probation. Jonathan Ajar, who stole the goods, served three years which also included time for other, unrelated crimes. Roy Lopez Jr. got three years’ probation.\n\nAt least one of their victims got a little bit more stardom out of the experience: Hilton made a cameo as herself in director Sofia Coppola’s “The Bling Ring” movie, based on a Vanity Fair article by Nancy Jo Sales (who expanded it into a book, “The Bling Ring”).\n\nA friend of Hilton’s told The Post she “retained a sense of humor about it,” which allowed her (and her house) to appear in the film, but the burglary also “made her so nervous, she upgraded security to mega-high-tech, lasers, even full-time guards.”\n\nOne Hollywood manager said that, “The stars who’ve been [burgled] get better security — more expensive, more tech-y — but the cops say it’s better to get a dog and to quit blasting selfies [showing your] fine jewelry and clothes all over Instagram.”\n\n“Being at home doesn’t scare them so much now. It’s not being home,” said one celebrity agent of his clients and other stars like them. “They’ve been warned by security people to keep cars in their driveways, and to leave TVs and radios and lights on” so that it looks like someone in the house.\n\nOne security expert said, “LA’s so spread-out it can take 20 minutes or more for the police to show up. These [burglars] are in and out in five minutes.”\n\nSince the Bling Ring era, LA crime enforcement has gotten more organized to deal with the proliferation of home burglaries. There’s now the LAPD’s elite Commercial Crimes Division, based at the department’s Downtown headquarters, and Maher runs the Burglary-Robbery Task Force of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Major Crimes Bureau-Metro detail. “Now all the police crime units work together,” Maher explained. “Ten years ago, information wasn’t shared.” (So far, no one has been arrested for the 2017 crimes.)\n\nNot every star is running scared, however. Puig — whose homes, don’t forget, have been looted twice this year — told TMZ Sports: “I ain’t worried about that s–t. I have a f–king lot of money.”"
