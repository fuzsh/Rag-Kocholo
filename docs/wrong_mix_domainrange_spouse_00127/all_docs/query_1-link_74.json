        "text": "• Producers of Tinsley Mortimer's upcoming reality show have been looking to add more drama by staging catfights between her friends and sister and having her chase men who are really just actors. At least the producers have solved their other problem and found a few \"friends\" willing to appear on camera. Regulars will include Hannah Bronfman (the party-loving daughter of Edgar Jr.) and Paul Johnson-Calderon (the guy who was caught stealing purses last spring). Interesting. [ P6]\n\n• Anderson Cooper has been vacationing in India with man-friend Benjamin Maisani. And it sounds like they're having quite the time: \"Cooper's $3,200-a-night room features a four-poster mahogany bed and views of the gardens of the former Maharaja palace.\" Oh, and this: \"Anderson's room has a large round bathtub. On the first night it was filled with bubbles and sprinkled with red rose petals.\" How romantic. [ P6]\n\n• Madonna visited the Malawi orphanage where she adopted her son David and one of the orphans approached her and told her, \"You are our god.\" Not surprisingly, Madonna \"seemed cool with it.\" [Us]\n\n• Renee Zellweger is going to be spending the holidays with Bradley Cooper's family in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, Bradley Cooper's ex-wife, Jennifer Esposito, is now engaged to Australian tennis player Mark Philippoussis. So everyone's happy, right? Well, except for Jennifer Aniston, that is. [ NYDN, People]\n\n• Speaking of happy couples, now that they've supposedly inked their pre-nup, Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom went out and inked themselves with each other's initials, too. Marriage after just a couple months, now matching tattoos... what could possibly go wrong? [ People]\n\n• Madonna planted a tree to kick off construction of her new girls' school in Malawi. She wore heels. And she looked awkward. [ AP]\n\n• At Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner's wedding on Sunday, guests were given a gift bag containing a book in Hebrew and flip-flops with a tag that read \"Ivanka and Jared—what a pair.\" Of course, that's a step up from the wedding invitations which contained a promotional flyer for one of Donald Trump's golf courses. [ NYP]\n\n• Brad Pitt lives. Although his motorcycle was rear-ended by a paparazzo's car on Saturday and he lost his balance, neither he nor his bike suffered any damage, although he did get to exchange a few \"heated\" words with the photographer before leaving the scene. [ Us]\n\n• Lindsay Lohan's downward spiral continues, not surprisingly. She's been dropped by her record label, Casablanca Records, and there are reports that she isn't even getting paid for her gig as Emanuel Ungaro's \"artistic adviser.\" And she's been on a \"serious shopping spree\" in recent days, which probably isn't good news. Then again, she's being followed around by camera crews, so maybe this will all be turned into a reality show at some point. [ P6, NYDN]\n\n• Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner tied the knot in front of 500 guests yesterday in an \"over the top\" ceremony at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. (On hand for the big event: Andrew Cuomo, Rudy Giuliani, Anna Wintour, Barbara Walters, Sheldon Silver, and Emmy Rossum, among others.) The couple is heading to Africa on their honeymoon. [ NYP]\n\n• Madonna is taking a quick trip over to Malawi this weekend \"to lay the foundation stone\" at the new \"multi-million dollar girls school she's building.\" That's funny. We could swear we heard about another celebrity doing almost exact same thing not too long ago. Oh, yes, her! Hopefully this time around there's a little less controversy. And let's also hope Malawian schoolchildren are ready to study Kabbalah from dawn till dusk. [ Reuters]\n\n• In related news, Madonna's ex, Alex Rodriguez, now appears to be taking an interest in Buddhism thanks to girlfriend Kate Hudson. Or at least he's pretending to be interested in it to make her happy. You decide! [ NYDN]\n\n• Ashlee Simpson-Wentz—sister of Jessica, wife of Pete, and the character Violet on The CW's Melrose Place—is now unemployed. Melrose's producers are taking a \"It's not you, it's me\" approach and saying the decision to cut her out of the show had nothing to do with the fact she can't act, but was because that had been their plan for the character from the beginning. [ EW, People]\n\nThe last few weeks haven't been easy for personal trainer to the stars Tracy Anderson: She recently lost Madonna as a client, and she's been taking an increasing amount of heat from both former clients and the press. Today Jacob Bernstein of The Daily Beast takes a look at Anderson's sketchy past and her numerous financial, legal, and personal run-ins, a number of which have been reported in the past, but aren't any less shocking a second time around. Don't think, though, that any of the criticism is changing the mind of Anderson's other super-famous client, Gwyneth Paltrow. Gwynnie is sticking by her girl:\n\nMadonna dropped $32.5 million on a townhouse on the Upper East Side a few months ago. But don't expect to see her giving out spare change to panhandlers in the neighborhood. Despite the fact she made about a gazillion dollars last year (give or take), Madge only gave away $459,000 to charity and almost all of it went to the Kabbalah Centre, which means she didn't give any money to charity at all, really.\n\n• One of Madonna's neighbors has filed a lawsuit against their building's co-op board for not doing anything about the \"pounding noise and vibration\" emanating from Madge's triplex, which the neighbor says has been doubling as a \"dance rehearsal studio.\" The good news is Madonna is moving in the near future, so the angry tenant should soon be able to go back to complaining about her other neighbor who just plays the radio too loud. [ NYDN, AP]\n\n• Lindsay Lohan avoided jail time but had her probation extended by a year last week when a judge ruled that she hadn't completed an alcohol treatment program. Then she went out to a party in the Meatpacking district this weekend and actually stayed sober. What a delightful surprise! [ P6]\n\n• Bethenny Frankel is engaged to her boyfriend of 11 months, Jason Hoppy. \"She is very much a handful,\" Hoppy said, \"She needs a man that can handle her, and that I can.\" More power to you, sir. [ People]\n\n• Lindsay Lohan could use a little good news today, especially since she's still dealing with the aftermath of her disastrous outing at Paris Fashion Week. Today is not going to be that day, unfortunately. Lohan is set to appear in court in LA a little later to answer questions about whether or not she's violated the terms of the probation she was given after she was busted for DUI a couple of years ago. Let's hope her powers of persuasion are in full effect. The judge could potentially sentence her to jail time, which would not only suck for LiLo, but would also leave Emmanuel Ungaro directionless, clearly. [ TMZ, E!]\n\n• Are John Mayer and Jennifer Aniston back together? Is she simply powerless to resist his advances? And have they spent the last few weeks meeting up for secret, romantic escapades around town? For the sake of Aniston's long-term mental health, let's hope none of those things are true. [ Us, People]\n\n• Go set your DVR. Tyra Banks plans to air the \"first-ever televised colonic\" on her show today. Just don't watch it while you're eating. [ Dlisted, Tyra Show]\n\n• Madonna reveals all sorts of juicy, personal stuff in an interview in the November issue of Rolling Stone. Like how she really wanted to work with Eminem, but he turned her down (ouch); how her graffiti tag name back in the '80s was \"Boy Toy\" (how ironic!); and how she was a total geek in high school, just like every other celeb in the universe. [ P6, NYDN]\n\n• Penelope Cruz is making a cameo in the Sex & the City sequel. Get ready to suspend belief: She'll be playing the role of a banker. [ People]\n\n• Emanuel Ungaro \"creative consultant\" Lindsay Lohan is blaming the epic disaster that was her recent fashion show in Paris on \"coming in so late and having not that much time to do a whole collection.\" She also says she's still \"learning\" and that the negative press isn't going to stop her from returning to Paris in a few months to give it another shot. You go, girl! [ People]\n\n• Because he's a romantic at heart, Alex Rodriguez flew to Miami for a single night to take Kate Hudson to dinner. Oh, yea, and to see his kids, too. [ P6]\n\n• Heidi Klum and Seal have a new addition to the family: Lou Sulola, who was born on Friday night and joins siblings Johan, Henry, and Leni. [ People]\n\n• Tyra Banks ought to be in a good mood today. Not only has she dropped four dress sizes recently, she's been named the \"top-earning primetime TV star\" by Forbes thanks to the $30 million she's collected over the past year. [ Daily Mail, MSNBC]\n\n• The latest legal tiff between Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook is over: The couple has settled their dispute, which means neither of them will be heading off to jail. [ People]\n\n• Was Penelope Cruz sporting a giant sapphire and diamond ring the other night because she really is engaged to Javier Bardem? And did she wear a bulky sweater over her dress because she's pregnant? So many questions, so few answers. Sigh. [ P6, NYDN]\n\n• A flight attendant who worked aboard Oprah Winfrey's private jet says she was falsely accused of having sex with a pilot mid-flight by another flight attendant and the daughter of Gayle King. And even though she passed the polygraph test she was given, she was fired because of it. So now she's filed a lawsuit against Oprah. Naturally. [ NYDN]\n\n• David Letterman isn't the only late-night comedian who's found romance in the workplace: Jimmy Kimmel, who split up with comedian Sarah Silverman back in March, is now dating one of the writers on his show. [ People]\n\n• Madonna has reportedly parted ways with her nutty trainer, Tracy Anderson. Explains a source: \"Madonna had grown tired of the baggage that Tracy always seemed to be carrying with her. Tracy had grown to be more of a distraction than anything else.\" [ P6]"
