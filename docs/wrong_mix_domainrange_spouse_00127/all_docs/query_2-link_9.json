        "text": "Actress Emmy Rossum showed her sophisticated side as she stepped out in LA wearing a cute over-the-knee dress.\n\nThe Shameless star teamed her flowing white number with pointed killer heels for the all-white outfit.\n\nFlaunting her slim figure the brunette beauty made her outfit pop with a statement red handbag. She also wore a matching slick of glamorous red lipstick.\n\nEmmy stars as Fiona Gallagher in Shameless, adapted from its UK version for US network showtime, alongside William H Macy.\n\nThe 27-year-old was snapped in Beverly Hills picking up a bag of food and enjoying the sunshine before throwing on a brown leather jacket and heading back to the set.\n\nShe completed her look with a pair of retro-feel sunglasses.\n\nThe fashionista, who was nominated for a Golden Globe for her role in Phantom of the Opera, was named in the best dressed list in Vanity Fair's September issue.\n\nAnd judging by this timeless look we can certainly see why. Hurray for Emmy!"
