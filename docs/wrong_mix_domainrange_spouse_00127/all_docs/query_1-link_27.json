        "text": "30 years is a little much, no?\n\nWe all know that Hollywood is famous for casting young actors to play the wives and partners of men who are much older than them IRL.\n\nThis got me thinking – if Hollywood wasn't an ageist and misogynistic machine, and it actually cast women the same age as these 15 actors, who would've been the best option. Let's vote on it, shall we?\n\nNo disrespect to the ladies who actually secured these roles, and obv age is just a number, and two consenting adults should be able to do as they please! However, I sense a pattern here that doesn't work as prolifically the other way around.\n\nDo you agree? Sound off in the comments!\n\nShare This Article"
