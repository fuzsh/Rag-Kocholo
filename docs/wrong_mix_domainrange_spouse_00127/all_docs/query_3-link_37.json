That was close, aren't we all happy now?\" 398= :\n\nPaper Towns\n\n2015 Mark: 6 Watched Wed 2 September 2015\n\nStarring: Nat Wolf with Cara Delevingne\n\nDirector: Jake Schreier\n\nWeirdly not totally convincing teen bro/romance which didn't quite hang together but was fairly easy on the eye. It would be interesting to hear the point of view of someone who likes this stuff.\n\n398= :\n\nPhone Booth\n\n2003 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Sat 3 May 2014\n\nStarring: Colin Farrell with Forest Whitaker, Katie Holmes, Radha Mitchell, Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nDirector: Joel Schumacher\n\nReasonable concept, reasonable characters but just a little too implausable to hook me in. I quite like Colin Farrell in this, and Whitaker was preparing himself for the Shield with this role, but all the time you want to say, just go for it, nobody is that good a shot\n\n398= :\n\nPlastic\n\n2014 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Mon 5 May 2014\n\nStarring: Ed Speleers with Will Poulter, Alfie Allen, Sebastian de Souza, Emma Rigby\n\nDirector: Julian Gilbey\n\nThe Lavender Hill Mob and the Ladykillers are better caper movies. I mean this was OK but just a little err... A little unimaginative? Was it a true story? One minute.... Supposedly. Theon Greyjoy you are truly lost now.\n\n398= :\n\nThe Producers\n\n1967 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Tue 21 January 2014\n\nStarring: Zero Mostel with Danny Kaye\n\nDirector: Mel Brooks\n\nWatch this once if only for Springtime For Hitler. Over the top and potracted comedy, very much of its age\n\n398= :\n\nRicochet\n\n1991 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Sun 27 April 2014\n\nStarring: Denzill Washinton with John Lithgow, Ice T\n\nDirector: Russell Mulcahy\n\nWell, with a plate of nacho's and a gin and tonic this makes for a nice, non-challenging Saturday night. Intresting watching a pre-oscar Denzill Washington looking buff, and John Lithgow doing what John Lithgow does in his psycopath hat. Don't look for plot continuity, crediblity or philosophy in this film. Help yourself to polarisation of characters and 'action'at Yiou know it's a nice thing about films that so many of them turn out to be so entertaining. When I compare this too another film which springs to mind The Edge it differs in that it does not take itself too seriously, consequently works within its own 'cartoon' universe. It says 'look, we know you know, therefore we are not insulting your intelligence, just fill your face and enjoy'\n\n398= :\n\nTideland\n\n2005 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Sat 7 February 2015\n\nStarring: Jodelle Ferland with Brendan Fletcher, Janet McTeer, Jennifer Tilly, Jeff Bridges\n\nDirector: Terry Gilliam\n\nI guess I am the viewer who \" just won't know what to think about it Would I rather have watched this than not watched it? Definitely. Is it thought provoking? My thoughts are provoked. Did I enjoy it? Not really.\n\nWhat a wierd, disturbing film, it is the kind of thing which I can't wait to talk about with somebody. Like The Fall This gives a yound girl's perspective on the fucked up world we live in by imagining her imagination. The girl in this is truly brilliant but her world is well and truly fucked up... Damn. Like many disturbing films, I am positive that if I was judging it on merit as opposed to personal enjoyment this would rate Much higher. Just how accurate is it as an insight into a human mind? Damn damn damn!\n\n398= :\n\nA Walk In The Woods\n\n2015 Mark: 6 Watched Wed 30 September 2015\n\nStarring: Robert Redford with Nick Nolte, Kristen Schaal, Nick Offerman, Mary Steenburgen, Emma Thompson\n\nDirector: Ken Kwapis\n\nSo much more of a watch than Wild, this didn't suck half as much as it could have done. I suppose, when all's said and done, Billy Bryson is an entertaining bloke.\n\n398= :\n\nX-Men 2\n\n2003 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Thu 29 May 2014\n\nStarring: Patrick Stewart with Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, James Marsden, Kelly Hu.\n\nDirector: Brian Singer\n\nI am going to have to watch these again and again to learn who does what and what they are called. I probably have given this a six more out of optimism and love of Julia and Dave rather than I actually understood it. I will get there eventually!\n\n397 :\n\nEyes of Laura Mars\n\n1978 Mark: 6.1 Watched Wed 14 October 2015\n\nStarring: Faye Dunaway with Tommy Lee Jones, Brad Dourif, Rene Auberjonois\n\nDirector: Irvin Kershner\n\nFantastical, dated, unintentionally funny, it kind of held my attention for the duration, but it was a frowner in that you are constantly thinking is this a fantasy, or is it meant to be the real world, and ... Look, the 6 .1 I gave it means I enjoyed it, but I think I am getting picky nowadays. Funny watching Odo, Grima Wormtongue, and young Warden Dwight McCloskey even though Faye Dunaway's almost constant state of shock got annoying.\n\n396 :\n\nThe Virgin Soldiers\n\n1969 Mark: 6.3\n\nWatched: Sat 17 October 2015\n\nStarring: Hywell Bennett with Lynn Redgrave, Nigel Davenport, Michael Gwynn, Geoffrey Hughes, Roy Holder\n\nDirector: John Dexter\n\nLike Kes This has been a film that has been around all my life without me seeing it, and I'm not unhappy that I filled in the gap. I wouldn't say it's a must see, but it'll while away an afternoon, seeing who you can spot in it (My favourite was Lord Melbury from Fawlty Towers )\n\n395 :\n\nBeautiful Creatures\n\n2013 Mark: 6.4\n\nWatched: Thu 29 October 2015\n\nStarring: Alden Ehrenreich with Alice Englert, Jeremy Irons, Viola Davis, Emmy Rossum, Thomas Mann, Emma Thompson\n\nDirector: Richard LaGravenese\n\nThis is a bit like watching a condensed vesion of True Blood. Very American teen, a little bit too self righteous, nevertheless a well put together piece of evening distraction which I enjoyed watching, not least because of an A list supporting cast!\n\n394 :\n\nFifty Shades Of Grey\n\n2015 Mark: 6.49\n\nWatched: Fri 13 February 2015\n\nStarring: Dakota Johnson with Jamie Dornan, Rita Ora\n\nDirector: Sam Taylor-Johnson\n\nIve seen plenty worse films and fallen asleep during better ones. I am pretty sure that this may suffer from Frozen syndrome, i.e. lots of people who havent seen it will tell you its rubbish. It differs from Frozen in that it is not a cinematic masterpiece with a clutch of absolutely wonderful songs, nevertheless it is not that bad. I wouldnt want to pay 12 quid to watch it, but Im glad I went on my Unlimited card, not just to assuage my curiosity, but I also I enjoyed it!\n\nSPOILER ALERT: The thing is, it works in its own scheme, and it is a story which has been told a million times before, in that a reasonably hot, but fundamentally unextraordinary, chick has relationship with a chap who just happens to be The Worlds most eligible bachelor. It also happens that he apparently goes to work but doesnt do anything when he is there. Of the two central characters I found that he was the most interesting one by miles, but I think thats the way it was meant to be. Good choices on Thomas Hardy as book choice and Im on Fire as background music, and yes, it does pose questions about stated and revealed preferences, and realistic ones at that. It is not ground breaking (fisting, both cunt and ass is off the agenda!), It is as clichéd as fuck at times, and some scenes had me reaching for the mobile to check my texts, nonetheless it is a reasonable story told reasonably well.\n\nThe audience was very much of a specific demographic (i.e. not like me). The car park would have been a dangerous place after the packed house for the first showing streamed out at 2:45\"\n\n352= :\n\n3 Days To Kill\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Tue 24 June 2014\n\nStarring: Kevin Costner with Amber Heard\n\nDirector: McG\n\nThis is a rare film in that it lurches between eminently watchable and then dire from scene to scene, from frame to frame. On the positive side is Kevin Costner's quasi comedic performance a reasonable story (I'm struggling now) and ... The negatives including the worst sound track ever ( I Love It, I Want To Make It With you ) and unbelievable threads like his bitchy little daughter learning to ride a bike in the worst place possible and a stupid stupid ubercool manipulative spy-master. Because she is a tart in high heels. And why didn't the Christmas present say (SPOILER ALERT) \"there was never anything wrong with you, you dick\". Whatever, I gave it the mark, I enjoyed it, but if every film was this moderate I wouldn't enjoy Cineworld enough to justify the ticket\n\n352= :\n\nAfter Hours\n\n1985 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Thu 17 September 2015\n\nStarring: Griffin Dunne with Rosanna Arquette, Linda Fiorentino, Teri Garr, Cheech Marin, John Heard\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nMy first film alphabetically (as of September 2015). That doesn't tell you much, I guess I am avoiding confronting this, as it was recommended me by Jack Bennet, and I don't want to seem like a philistine. I am glad I watched it, nevertheless, it wasn't quite my tempo, in that although the characterisations were terrific, they had no real story to grow upon, I mean, SPOLIER ALERT how unlucky can a bloke be in an evening?, 'cos that is the premise. It isn't like one thing leads to another, the bad luck, although intertwined is just a set of inorganic incidents which play out against each other, not with each other.\n\nThere, I've gone and told you why I haven't given it a nine.\n\nPerhaps humour, because of its innate irrationality, becomes a very personal thing, I mean, I hate Keith Lemon, and don't like Harry Hill or Russell Brand, even though they are all well loved and no doubt very talented (apart from Keith Lemon). Perhaps its because by trying to be 'hip' for its time it is dated now, the Village People stereotypes seemed a little patronising to me. Perhaps its because Martin Scorsese blows hot and cold for me; whatever, I enjoyed the film, but for dark comedy would go for In Bruges\n\n352= :\n\nAge Of Heroes\n\n2011 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Fri 27 June 2014\n\nStarring: Danny Dyer with Sean Bean\n\nDirector: Adrian Vitoria\n\nWell I liked this. The paella was good, the wine more than adequate and I like Danny Dyer more than Mark Kermode, who seems to put a greater emphasis on packaging than content. To try and capture the soul of this film without giving spoilers away, it is just another heist movie, but without the comedy and set in World War II. If you like Sean Bean, you will like this film, if you don't well going and watch Walking on bleedin' Sunshine you vacuous moron. I actually reckon this was just the right film to watch at the time!\n\nPS: This is actually based around the true story of the formation of Ian Fleming's 30th Commando regiment!\n\n352= :\n\nThe Apartment\n\n1960 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sat 10 October 2015\n\nStarring: Jack Lemmon with Shirley MacLaine, Fred MacMurray, Jack Kruschen\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nHow foolish can two people be? Jack Lemmon is almost too good an actor, his timing and inflexion is so deliberate it leaves nothing to the imagination. Although some of this film kept the attention a lot of it was just too corny. The old days were great then though, when it was perfectly normal for geriatric blokes to go out with twenty somethings\n\n352= :\n\nBad Neighbours\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Mon 5 May 2014\n\nStarring: Seth Rogan with Zac Effron\n\nDirector: Nicholas Stoller\n\nZac Effron WILL do an action movie soon, and he will be good at it. This is exactly what you would tip from Seth Rogan, and had some genuine Laugh Out Loud moments. Yeah  it was good. Watch it. But do not expect anything beyond the expected\n\n352= :\n\nThe Best Of Me\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Wed 15 October 2014\n\nStarring: James Marsden with Michelle Monaghan, Luke Bracey, Liana Liberato\n\nDirector: Michael Hoffman\n\nMy goodness I had to take some deep swallows to sit through this one, but, you know, there was more good than bad about it. I reckon the male female ratio in the cinema on this particular Orange Wednesday was perhaps 1 to 20. The main man was just a bit too perfect, which no doubt explains the girly bias, and there were many excruciating (for me) glances, passages and scenes, nevertheless, it had its moments, it didn't resort to God, the plot took some surprising turns, the scenery was superb. And so yes, it gets a slight thumbs up. Not quite Labour Day, but worth the trip. Fuck I feel dorky on my own! Luke Bracey as young Dawson was very good\n\n352= :\n\nThe Boat That Rocked\n\n2009 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Mon 11 July 2011\n\nStarring: Phillip Seymour Hoffman with Bill Nighy, Nick Frost, Mark Addy, Rhys Evans, Chris O'Dowd, Gemma Artuton, Emma Thompson, Kenneth Brannagh, Jack Davenport\n\nDirector: Richard Curtis\n\nReasonably entertaining, but I must admit I found the foppish teen and the lack of factual continuity a little annoying, but that is just me. It could have been a TV series (Richard Curtis was the director) A good film for a UK/US connections.\n\nAlmost Famous (foppish Teen, Philip Seymour Hoffman) comes out 1.5 points in front as a piece of theatre about the music of our youth. It crosses over and is still relevant today, whereas TBTR is just a yarn.\n\n352= :\n\nChinatown\n\n1974 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Mon 17 August 2015\n\nStarring: Jack Nicholson with Faye Dunaway, John Huston\n\nDirector: Roman Polanski\n\nCouldn't quite get why this film is so accoladed. To be sure Jack Nicholson is awesome, but we have been spoilt by modern film and TV dramas, we really have. When films try to be 'modern' they date a little more quickly (Yeah, I know, this was set in the 30s, but the 'gritty realism' just seems a bit lame compared with The Wire ). I'd watch LA Confidential for this done better, but hell, watch it anyhoo\n\n352= :\n\nThe Counsellor\n\n2013 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sun 17 November 2013\n\nStarring: Michael Fassbender with Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt\n\nCan't remember much about this for some reason, but I did enjoy it. That was a really lame review!\n\n352= :\n\nDouble Indemnity\n\n1944 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Fri 7 February 2014\n\nStarring: Fred McMurray with Barbara Stanywick, Edward G Robinson\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nI always feel guilty giving old films relatively low ratings, but they do date. Yes this had great occasional dialogue, reasonable story, good, albeit somewhat falsified characters, but perhaps just as time wears on the film maker has more resources at their disposable, and old films have got to be something very special or, as in the case of Disneys, performed in a medium that is difficult to improve upon. Really, those sunglasses in the supermarket? Not in any universe.\n\n352= :\n\nDriven To Kill\n\n2009 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Tue 26 August 2014\n\nStarring: Steven Seagal\n\nDirector: Jeff F. King\n\nIt seems weird given the time elapsed to give these Segal films the same mark or better than some Oscar winning movies. The thing is though, they are entertaining. Not particularly challenging, often laughably executed, unsurprising in outcome, nevertheless they are entertaining. Of the double header we had, Driven to Kill edges it, even though they have the same mark\n\n352= :\n\nDumb and Dumber\n\n1994 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sat 27 June 2015\n\nStarring: Jim Carey with Jeff Daniels, Terry Garr\n\nDirector: Peter Farrelly\n\nJim Carey is too Jerry Lewis for my liking in this film, that certainly has its LOL moments but is hardly challenging. Bill and Ted and Stepbrothers do this so much better\n\n352= :\n\nFantastic Four\n\n2015 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Tue 4 August 2015\n\nStarring: Miles Teller with Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell, Reg E. Cathey, Tim Blake Nelson\n\nDirector: Josh Trank\n\nPerhaps we have been spoiled by the last few Marvel outings. This never quite gets the humour of its immediate predecessors, it all seems a little 'make my monster grow'ish. Full of phrases like \"His biometric scales are off the chart\" the science is imaginative and the logic less than impeccable. This sounds like a diss piece, it is not, it is still worth a watch for free, I just wouldn't want to pay eight quid. This review is unsatisfactory. :(\n\n352= :\n\nThe Gambler\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Fri 23 January 2015\n\nStarring: Mark Whalberg with John Goodman, Brie Larson, Michael K. Williams, Jessica Lange\n\nDirector: Rupert Wyatt\n\nAnother good turn from Marky Mark, in this he puts the lac in laconic. Like Wild, which I saw the same afternoon, I have to add that this was a GOOD film, a thoroughly enjoyable watch, top side of six and a half. What surprised me was I sat through three films and Wolf Hall, and never nodded once, which says something about how great movies are. I am sure I will look at other films on 7.5 and think WTF?\n\nLast year about this time I mentioned how cool it was the Michel K Williams appeared as a bit part in 12 Years A Slave This year he is strong support. Next year co star, 2016 he will star. He is a great watch\n\nThe Shooter, The Fighter, The Gamber, The Happening... Is there something going on here>\"\n\n352= :\n\nGuardians Of The Galaxy\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Tue 12 August 2014\n\nStarring: Chris Pratt with Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close, Benicio del Toro\n\nDirector: James Gunn\n\nI think this film may have caught me at the wrong time, in that I must have nodded off during parts of it. I kind of liked it but forgot most of it as well. The soundtrack thing didn't sit comfortably with me and I am ashamed cos my daughters love it. I s\n\n352= :\n\nHome\n\n2015 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Thu 23 April 2015\n\nStarring: Jim Parsons with Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez, Steve Martin\n\nDirector: Tim Johnson\n\nWhere do I start? I mean, this was a lovely watch, not entirely my cup of tea, but I would love to take Grace to see it (my two year old niece) in two year's time. I enjoyed Rihanna's contribution, as Tip, the heroine, and soundtrack. O (the alien protagonist) would have been better without me thinking of Sheldon Cooper at his gayest all night. Loved some of the homages, I may be wrong but A bit of a fixer upper was a direct lift from Frozen, the musical motif was the six note riff from Tomorrow (from Annie ) and really, was there a nod to the Ultimate Dog Tease?\n\n352= :\n\nThe Hundred Foot Journey\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Mon 15 September 2014\n\nStarring: Helen Mirren with Om Puri, Manish Dayal, Charlotte Le Bon\n\nDirector: Lasse Hallström\n\nAfter watching Pride a couple of hours earlier I was still high and in no real position to judge this objectively. I enjoyed it, but was it because I was in a super mood and pliable to all cinematic suggestion? It may have been you know, because objectively it was a nice story, amusing in places amidst scenery that was too lovely, yet... I dunno. 6.5 still says 'good film', it'll be interesting to compare this to Chef that comes out in a couple of days\n\n352= :\n\nIron Man\n\n2008 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sun 4 May 2014\n\nStarring: Robert Downey Jnr with Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges\n\nEnjoyable in a Marvel way. I went back to this to review it, I suppose to compare it with CA TWS, and for kind of the same story, the latter film does it better. All four main characters tend to grate just a little bit. Not enough to stop one enjoying the movie, just enough to imagine there is just too much smugness floating round to allow immersion and identification\n\n352= :\n\nJames Bond 19; The World Is Not Enough\n\n1999 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Thu 6 March 2014\n\nStarring: Piers Brosnan with Sophie Marceau, John Cleese, Robert Carlyle Denise Richards, Robbie Coltrane, Judi Dench\n\nDirector: Michael Apted\n\nHow long has it taken me to watch this film? Well I'm glad I did. Don't expect anything but ridiculous innuendo and overtime for stuntmen as Piers defeats an absolutely potty Kasak Megalomaniac super-villain who aims to further his ends in the most ridiculously inefficient, convoluted and entertaing way imaginable.\n\n352= :\n\nThe Keeper\n\n2009 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Wed 27 August 2014\n\nStarring: Steven Seagal\n\nDirector: Keoni Waxman\n\nPartt of a Segal double header, I had forgotten the name of both of them within the few days that have elapsed, yet I could kind of watch these with a friend most nights\n\n352= :\n\nKnowing\n\n2009 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Mon 23 June 2014\n\nStarring: Nicholas Cage with Ben Mendelsohn\n\nDirector: Alex Proyas\n\nOne of those tape it 'cos Nick Cage should be good for a few moments films, and sure enough he is. There were genuinely times during this that piqued my fear button, albeit exceedingly briefly, and it didn't quite clear the hurdle of suspension of disbelief, nevertheless I enjoyed it, so what?\n\n352= :\n\nLast Man Standing\n\n1996 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Mon 31 August 2015\n\nStarring: Bruce Willis with Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Michael Imperioli\n\nDirector: Walter Hill\n\nA critically poorly recieved film, I can praise some aspects of it, but feel that it is implausibility of it all that dissapointed me more than the technical aspects (music, acting, and cinematography were all pretty awesome). An all star cast replicate the story of A Fistfull Of Dollars with the added bonus that the hero is actually indestructable and, bar one which hits him in the lower off-stomach towards the end of the film, is to all intents and purposes, bullet-proof. It just doesn't wash, so by half way through you come to realise there is not a great deal of shock to look forward to.\n\nIntresting cast in that Walter Hill uses David Patrick Kelly in a pretty similar role to The Warriors and that the overarching feel of Deadwood has to be because of the directorial connection, along with Dern and Sanderson, who is eminently recognisable\n\n352= :\n\nThe Lego Movie\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sun 16 February 2014\n\nStarring: Chris Pratt with Elizabeth Banks, Will Ferrell, Will Arnett, Nick Offerman, Alison Brie, Charlie Day, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman\n\nThis turned out better than I would have expected. I feel I should have given it more than 6.5, nevertheless I nodded off during it, I think due more to tiredness (had just watched The Monuments Men and had a foot long, than lack of interest. A whole heap of cross references that I am sure I missed, and a believable premise. I am not sure how much was CGI and how much was stop-go, but it was quite magnificent, the cinematography, as it were. Almost too intense a visual assault, but definitely worth a watch and a credible movie for adults.\n\n352= :\n\nMonsters; Dark Continent\n\n2015 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Tue 5 May 2015\n\nStarring: Johnny Harris\n\nDirector: Tom Green\n\nThis might just be a better film than I imagined. It was not the roaring, explosion filled, monster fest I anticipated, although it did not lack for monsters and roaring and explosions. It had the feel of American Sniper meets The Day After Tomorrow on 8 mile and, has left me wondering was it an anti-war film. I think it was. SPOILER ALERT: If you want monster action you WILL be disappointed. If a film makes you think about it afterwards, that may indicate that it has merits unrealised. Mmmm....\n\nI was going to say it had a lot of Godzilla about it and damn, Gareth Edwards was Executive Producer.\n\nI should have realised and articulated this prior to going to the discussions, but say you took every monster out and replaced them with, say, camels, it would have made no material difference to the film.\n\n352= :\n\nPeggy Sue Got Married\n\n1986 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sat 17 May 2014\n\nStarring: Kathleen Turner with Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Helen Hunt, Joan Allen, Catherine Hicks,, Sofia Coppola\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nHard to go wrong with temporal displacement films even when they are done by non geeky people who understand the paradoxes that might be set up. Unusually I watched this over the same weekend as La Bamba (they are set in the same era)\n\n352= :\n\nPercy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief\n\n2010 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sat 11 January 2014\n\nStarring: Logan Lerman with Alexandra Daddario, Piers Brosnan, Joe Pantiliano, Sean Bean, Uma Thurman, Steve Coogan,. Rasorio Dawson\n\nWas this just more fun than Hunger Games ?\n\nAbsolutely stellar cast, one of the lads in my tutor class at Plymouth said it was his favourite film, and I've been meaning to watch it ever since. Would I rather watch this than Gravity ? Yes I would!!\n\n352= :\n\nPerfect Stranger\n\n2007 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Tue 13 October 2015\n\nStarring: Halle Berry with Bruce Willis, Giovanni Ribisi\n\nDirector: James Foley\n\nThis just managed to keep me hanging on until three quarters of the way through I was quite intrested in, and satidfied by, The resolution. There are plenty of better films kicking about but I wasn't kicking myself about watching this. Good idea filming three different endings!\n\n352= :\n\nThe Planet Of The Apes 1; Rise Of\n\n2013 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Mon 17 November 2014\n\nStarring: James Franco with Freida Pinto, John Lithgow, Brian Cox, Tom Felton, Andy Serkis\n\nDirector: Rupert Wyatt\n\nI should have loved this, but having just watched Life with David Attenborough on BBC talking about Chimp Hierarchies, this still seems unconvincing in visual terms (You can tell that allthough they are good they are not real apes, it fails in its own Universe as I don't care how powerfull the drug is, you can't learn Dick unless you are taught it somehow, and finally it fails in that the Bonobo is the bad guy. Huh?\n\n352= :\n\nPlatoon\n\n1986 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Tue 15 September 2015\n\nStarring: Charlie Sheen with Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon, Forest Whitaker, Johnny Depp\n\nDirector: Oliver Stone\n\nErr.. It is tough to write about an accoladed film, that technically you can't pick fault with, that most definitely wasn't a terrible watch, but just didn't do it for me in terms of super-enjoyable. A host of then young stars make this a touchstone for connections, a huge coincidence that the last two films I've watched ( Entourage and this) could not have been more different, or further apart in time, yet both featured Kevin Dillon. Crash knocked me out when I went back to it. This didn't. But it was worth crossing off for sure. Like Canon For Strings some people love it, but, not me.\n\n352= :\n\nRampart\n\n2011 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sat 20 December 2014\n\nStarring: Woody Harrelson with ice Cubem Steve Buscemi, Sigourney Weaver\n\nDirector: Oren Moverman\n\nHere is a Freebie. If you want Woody Harelson watch Natural Born Killers, If you want a reflection on policing in LA watch the entirety of The Shield, If you want a night in watching a film I guess this'll do.\n\n352= :\n\nThe Riot Club\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Wed 1 October 2014\n\nStarring: Max Irons with Ben Schnetzer, Natalie Dormer (will probably add to this list as they all get famous)\n\nDirector: Lone Scherfig\n\nI imagine that the cast in this will go on to greater things, (I recognised Ben Schnetzer from Pride and a few of the others set bells ringing), but that's nothing to do with assesing this film.\n\nI can't say it was thoroughly enjoyable, the characters were largely far too repulsive for that, but I reckon it was quite an excellent pitch at describing priveleged young men, in that some, without doubt, are disarmingly talented and charming whilst others are complete dicks. I also like the angle that this doesn't end good for general welfare. It would have been intresting to see if the landlord's daughter accepted the £27,000. Watch it and you will see what I mean. Go see, in fact double it up with Pride and be proud of British film making, if not quite proud of some aspects of humanity\n\n352= :\n\nSecretariat\n\n2010 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sun 12 January 2014\n\nStarring: John Malkovich with Diane Lane\n\nGood quiz background film, Malkovich is no longer mal, With of good story like this it must be tough to actually make a bad film of it, so this is a nice evening in\n\n352= :\n\nShaun The Sheep Movie\n\n2015 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Mon 9 February 2015\n\nDirectors: Richard Starzak, Mark Burton\n\nI loved the backgrounds on this. It was just like the land of my life, Yorkshire, the dales, the buses, the walls, the roads, Leeds/Manchester, the shops, the people. If the story had been a quarter of the scenery this would have been a great film. As it turns out it was a pleasant enough watch, perhaps not quite what I would pay £8 for, at least not when Kingsman or The Interview were on next door, but still pleasant enough with the old Unlimited card\n\n352= :\n\nSon Of A Gun\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Tue 3 February 2015\n\nStarring: Brenton Thwaites with Euan McGregor, Alicia Vikander\n\nDirector: Julius Avery\n\nOne of those films that are a jolly good watch, kind of semi predictable, a wee bit of head scratching as to peoples motive's, why did the girl like the boy, why did the King Con like the lad, where were the Australian Air Force?.. but not the total turn off it could have been. I'm still trying to figure out if these were good guys or bad guys.\n\n352= :\n\nSuspect\n\n1987 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Tue 5 August 2014\n\nStarring: Cher with Liam Neeson, Dennis Quaid\n\nDirector: Peter Yates\n\nI suppose I watched this for Liam Neeson, but Cher wasn't half bad in it. I just enjoyed it, even though I can't remember the title!\n\n352= :\n\nSwearnet: The Movie\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sun 26 April 2015\n\nStarring: Rob Wells with Mike Smith, John Paul Tremblay, Pat Roach, Carrot Top, Sebastian Bach, John Dunsworth\n\nDirector: Warren P. Sonoda\n\nI feel I should mark this higher for loyalty's sake, but I must try to be impartial. I love Trailer Park Boys, and this would have always struggled to keep up with that high standard. It is more of the same, with a good denoument, and a film which is an enjoyable watch, but you just can't help comparing it to its origins. If you are a fan you will like it.\n\n352= :\n\nThe Third Man\n\n1949 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Thu 29 January 2015\n\nStarring: Joseph Cotten with Orson Welles, Trevor Howard\n\nDirector: Carol Reed\n\nHere I go saying an absolute classic wasn't that entertaining. It just wasn't, the set up was not believable, the dialogue and behaviour dated. The sets not particularly imaginative (OK it was 1949) and the music, though instantly identifiable, didn't quite fit, at least for me. Still worth a watch.\n\nP.S. OMG - \" It is considered one of the greatest films of all time, celebrated for its atmospheric cinematography, performances, and musical score \" !!!\n\n352= :\n\nTouch The Top Of The World\n\n2006 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Thu 27 March 2014\n\nStarring: Peter Facinelli\n\nIn the same vein as Touching The Void without the level of drama and production qualities, and a little bit more backstory on the protagonist which is a little David Copperfield ish, in that it becomes a little overbearing to watch a hagiography. I think a plot summary would not be out of place so basically; it is the story of Erik Weihenmayer, the first blind person to climb Everest.\n\n352= :\n\nTransformers\n\n2007 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sun 29 March 2015\n\nStarring: Shia La Boef with Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Anderson, Megan Fox, Rachael Taylor, John Turturro, Jon Voight\n\nDirector: Michael Bay\n\nGreat start, but I realise why I can't remember much about me watching it first time; The last hour is devoid of story, and because it is CGI it is just a (SPOILER ALERT) boring fight during which I drifted between sleep and consciousness to see a Bay-fest of impact smashes and explosions.\n\n352= :\n\nUnder The Skin\n\n2013 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Mon 29 December 2014\n\nStarring: Scarlet Johanssen with Lots of non-actor extras\n\nDirector: Jonathan Glazer\n\nMuch of this film was impressive, Scarlett Johannsen conveys such perfect sexuality, I could very easily identify with the men she met. Those men were largely duped into the scenes being filmed by hidden cameras which is definitely worth watching. The film, however, failed to maintain my intrest throughout, in that we did kind of have the same scene four or five times, and given the sparsity of dialogue (13 minutes before the first words) I was becoming bored waiting for development. As a story concept it is terrific, but it is almost analogous to human emotion changes. If the cinematagraphy was meant to make Scotland look bleak, poor, cold and depressing it was terrific. The cast, given they were Johannseen and a bunch of non-luvvies were awesome. It could still have been a one hour Tales of the Unexpected\n\n352= :\n\nVanilla Sky\n\n2001 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Tue 5 August 2014\n\nStarring: Tom Cruise with Penélope Cruz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee, Noah Taylor, Cameron Diaz, Timothy Spall, Tilda Swinton, Steven Spielberg, Johnny Galecki\n\nDirector: Cameron Crowe\n\nWriting this before I've finished the film, but I can't wait to do so. Tom Cruise Sci Fi gets better as the years wear on. (see The Edge of Tomorrow\n\n352= :\n\nWild\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Fri 23 January 2015\n\nStarring: Reese Witherspoon (n) with Laura Dern (n), Thomas Sadoski, Michiel Huisman, Gaby Hoffmann\n\nDirector: Jean-Marc Vallée\n\nSix and a half is good. Reese Witherspoon was adequate, as was Lara Dern, but as Oscar Nominees they did't make me punch the air in triumph when they had their moments. The thing is, it's not too much of a story:\n\nSPOILER ALERT. Nice chick goes on a 1200 mile hike up the American Rockies, sees a snake in the desert, a coyote in the woods, wasn't well prepared but flutters her eyelashes for any amount of help. She feels threatened (multiple times) but never actually was harmed by any animals or humans. Like me when I go to Neil Aspland's house to talk to him, and they call the police. Mountains and Molehills. Why is the tone of this review far less positive than the other 6.5 I saw today, The Gambler ? Cos Mark Whalberg is not gonna be nominated for any Oscars.\n\nTo get things straight, I still enjoyed it\n\n351 :\n\nV For Vendetta\n\n2006 Mark: 6.8 Watched Thu 5 November 2015\n\nStarring: Natalie Portman with Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, Stephen Fry, Tim Pigott-Smith, Rupert Graves, Roger Allam, John Standing, Sinéad Cusack, Natasha Wightman, Imogen Poots\n\nDirector: James McTeigue\n\nWhy people hate me, volume 51115\n\nI appropriately watched this on Bonfire Night at the behest of my beloved neighbour, Danni, who had put up a quote from it on her FaceBook page , namely \"\"People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people\"\" To which I , naturally, replied \"\"Why on Earth should a government be afraid of people in a 'democracy' where over 55% of the people have less than 5% of the wealth? Amen my arse, they should be laughing to their back teeth reading FaceBook at all the lilly livered cunts whinging about how bad things are, without doing anything about it. (Don't take it personally Dan, you are fab!)\"\"\n\nThe thing is, the quote, and the film illicit the same reaction in me, that as humans we observe films, history, stories and analogies and imagine that we are not collectively horrible, and that we all go on about \"\"ewww, Selma, Suffragette, 12 Years A Slave, Schindler's List, that wouldn't happen on our watch\"\", but the fact is, it is going ahead full steam on our watch, this second, this minute this year, and we are fuckin' moronically oblivious to it.\n\nI was in the sauna yesterday, some bloke walks in, a Labour councillor from Normanton, and he told us about how the Conservative councillors attend 8 two hour meetings per year to claim their full £12,000 councillor's allowance. He went on to explain the math to us; £750 per hour. I then pointed out there would be many Labour councillors who would do exactly the same thing, that the demography of either party regarding all aspects of human 'goodness' was probably indistinguishable. He then said, quote \"\"Ah but we don't use it as a stick to beat them (i.e. the Tories) with\"\" I pointed out that he had just spent the previous two minutes doing precisely that. It didn't sadden me that Councillors might be greedy, or even that he had the effrontery to contradict himself in the space of 60 seconds and refuse to acknowledge it. It worried me a little that he tried to change the subject by inferring that I had somehow dissed an old friend of mine who was a councillor (I hadn't). The real permanent, inescapable tragedy was that a friend of over 30 years, sitting one yard away from both of us would not acknowledge the glaringly inescapable contradiction, choosing to say something along the lines of \"\"it's nothing to do with me\"\", and that far from being unique, he was being absolutely, typically, mundanely, 'nicely' human.\n\nWhich brings us to the film. The sofa family sucked, Steven Fry seems like a bit of an add-on. I mean I love the guy, but Gosford Park, The Hobbit part 12.. I'm being picky. Look, what do I know? I'm the only person I know who was cynical about 1984, but like I said, I carry a lot of baggage when it comes to my faith in collective humanity, and when I see films which make people feel right-on, I gag a little. And it saddens me that the majority of people do not, can not, comprehend why.\n\n250= :\n\n12 Years A Slave\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 7 January 2014\n\nStarring: Chiwetel Ejiofor with Ashley Dyke, Benedict Cumberbatch, Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt\n\nDirector: Steve McQueen\n\nNow then! Odds on for best film Oscar, but for me it is many lengths behind several films I have seen at the latter part of 2013. Don't get me wrong, it is quite awesome, but as a message film it fails. White folk in the Antebellum South were just as good, bad or usually indifferent as the 10,000 people closest to you now, at this moment in time. This film is an excuse for 95% y'all to get real righteous and say \"My goodness, how bad were those people\", but until you realise that you/we are just the same the message is pointless. Yeah, and like Jack Tarr could just stab a nigger on the boat. That could never of happened without the guy being hauled over the coals by the slave owner.\n\nSpoiler Alert. The film is about a bloke who was a slave for 12 years.\n\nP.S. Watched the BAFTA awards and Steve McQueen, the director, was giving his acceptance speech after receiving the Best Film award. He delivered this fine point:\n\nRight now there are twenty one million people in slavery as we sp... as we sit here. Twenty-one million people. I just hope that a hundred and fifty years from now our ambivalence will not allow another film-maker to make this film\n\nMy point is it will. And the same fuckers will be wringing their hands and voting for it\n\n250= :\n\n300; Rise Of An Empire\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 10 March 2014\n\nStarring: Sullivan Stapleton with Lena Hedey, Eva Green\n\nDirector: Zack Snyder\n\nSurprise! I thought this was going to be garbage (I never really liked the first one) but did I like this? Hell yeah! I know ships don't come over the top of hills of water like the cavalry, I know that Persian bitch-queens don't wear fishnets and Goth make up. I understand it was entirely green screen. I know that the queen of Sparta was the alternate universe Cersei Lannister. The film would have lasted just 30 minutes if they didn't put it in super slo-mo every time there was some blood flying through the air (which was practically the whole movie). Xerxes must have got gay virus and, and, and... everything. But it was ENJOYABLE. I actually got quite invested in a few of the lead characters.\n\n250= :\n\n51st State\n\n2001 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 14 January 2013\n\nStarring: Samuel L Jackson with Robert Carlyle, Emily Mortimer, Ricky Tomlinson, Sean Pertwee, Rhys Ifans, Meat Loaf\n\nDirector: Ronny Yu\n\nSolid, amusing film set in Liverpool!\n\n250= :\n\nThe Age of Adeline\n\n2015 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 22 May 2015\n\nStarring: Blake Lively with Michiel Huisman, Kathy Baker, Amanda Crew, Harrison Ford, Ellen Burstyn\n\nDirector: Lee Toland Krieger\n\nSitting writing about this and I want to mark it down, nevertheless I'll leave it at the 7 I gave it three quarters of the way through, in that it got much more interesting once Harrison Ford appeared on the screen half way through. It kept me awake, and the science was absolutely terrible. The best bit was Young Indiana Jones doing a great job of the accent. Surely did not like this more than The Lego Movie ?\n\n250= :\n\nAll The King's Men\n\n1948 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 5 July 1905\n\nStarring: Broderick Crawford\n\nDirector: Robert Rossen\n\nThis film discusses a theme that is close to my heart; politics, and gives a fairly compelling reflection upon it and human nature in general\n\n250= :\n\nThe Amazing Spiderman 2\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 28 May 2014\n\nStarring: Andrew Garfield with Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz, Colm Feore, Paul Giamatti, Sally Field Marc Webb\n\nI liked it! Much the same as the first francise, this has action with levity, and I liked\n\n250= :\n\nAmerican Sniper\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 16 January 2015\n\nStarring: Bradley Cooper (n) with Sienna Miller\n\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\n\nClint Eastwood has moved on a bit since Heartbreak Ridge. In this film he takes a true patriot story and paints it with stars and stripes, all very moving. Bradley Cooper has moved on from American Hustle (in which he was good) and I can see why he has been nominated for best actor. He won't get it as there are three stand outs in front of him, nevertheless he was as convincing a seal as Paddington was a bear, i.e. absolutely believable. He definitely has the best movie sniff ever!\n\nIf you enjoyed Fury, The Monuments Men, The Railwayman and Unbroken you'll enjoy this. I enjoyed those four so.... (Do the math). This has a brief, but I consider very convincing, scene when they watch 9/11 on telly. Just thought I'd throw that in there.\n\n250= :\n\nBarton Fink\n\n1991 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 3 July 1905\n\nStarring: John Turturro\n\nDirector: Coen Brothers\n\nI'm pretty sure that if I watch this again I will up it from a 7. Love that picture.\n\n250= :\n\nA Beautiful Mind\n\n2000 Mark: 7\n\nStarring: Russell Crowe with\n\nDirector: Ron Howard\n\nRussell Crowe is very good in this, but I reckon Good Will Hunting does the genius thing better\n\n250= :\n\nThe Best Years Of Our Lives\n\n1946 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 23 March 2015\n\nStarring: Frederick March with Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell, Hoagy Carmichael, Harold Russell\n\nDirector: William Wyler\n\n\"A multiple Oscar winner, it seems to be the one which has most faded from the public eye. The first 50 minutes or so are terrific, when, given the constraints of what was a film industry still learning, we have a great set up, but... It really doesnt go anywhere once the guys all come back from a night on the town. I might suggest that the film is heavily constrained by the mores of the day, which leaves one feeling that so much is missing, specifically sex, arguably the most important thing relationships, is barely alluded to, and though it was fine to chain smoke and get so drunk you couldnt remember, I reckon a boner was out of the question. It is a shame because the characters were there, a fistful of them which looked down the road of development but never travelled down there. It was not all sweetness and light, but I can only assume it was artistically stifled by an industry wracked with fear, so any gritty realism was constrained by censorship, overt or otherwise. For 1946 Passport To Pimlico was a far more enjoyable film.\n\nNB this film, as well as getting the gongs for film, director, actor, supporting actor and director is the sixth most ticketed in British history and makes all sorts of best of lists.\n\nA good film, but it could have been so much better. We had to wait another 32 years for The Deer Hunter to illustrate the damage of war more vividly to the Academy\"\n\n250= :\n\nBig Hero 6\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 3 February 2015\n\nStarring: Ryan Potter with Scott Adsit, James Cromwell\n\nDirectors: Don Hall, Chris Williams\n\nA beautiful picture in terms of the canvas, but kind of weird in it's exceedingly imaginative interpretation of how this particular world of San Fransokyo works. I feel like dropping it a notch, but the fact is, it was entertaining, especially the referencing within it, The Marvel aspect, the Ghibli influence, the strange American/Japanese juxtaposition within the entire mise en scène, I mean the bad guy in his mask was No-Face straight out of Spirited Away. Worth the watch for sure\n\n250= :\n\nBlack Sea\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 10 December 2014\n\nStarring: Jude Law with Scoot McNairey\n\nDirector: Kevin Macdonald\n\nI suppose if you watched The Dirty Dozen, The Hunt For Red October and The Lavendar Hill Mob you could piece together this particular film. I hope I haven't given to much away. Very reasonable film in all departments, Jude Law is really good, my favourite performance of his. I did think it was going to be worth a tad more at first, but still it maintained my intrest throughout and delivered a couple of nice little angles to keep me awake. I would love to know what Andrew Kidd thinks of this. (He is my nephew and is an expert on submarines. Hang on a minute, I'm thinking of a couple of plot holes here... Nah, doesn't matter, it's a yarn.\n\n250= :\n\nThe Butler\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 17 November 2013\n\nStarring: Forest Whitakker\n\nGreat film for quiz buffs in that it gives a historical insight into a lot of the post-war American presidents. A tableau!\n\n250= :\n\nCalvary\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 31 March 2015\n\nStarring: Brendan Gleeson with Chris O'Dowd, Kelly Reilly, Aidan Gillen, Dylan Moran, Isaach de Bankolé\n\nDirector: John Michael McDonagh\n\nDidn't quite get the story here, I mean, there was this thread, but perhaps it deliberately left some of the profiling to ones imagination. Brendan Gleeson absolutely lights up a screen, and the host of support actors do not displease the eye. If I had seen this before Cuban Fury I might not have liked Chris O'Dowd's part, but now.. hey, he's OK. This is like Father Ted  The Dark Side and is worth watching for the whole look and feel of it, but it is kind of disquieting. That's why I spread it out over a couple of days\n\n250= :\n\nCaptain America 2: The Winter Soldier\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 30 March 2014\n\nStarring: Chris Evans with Scarlett Johansen, Samuel L Jackson, Robert Redford, Jenny Augetter, Toby Jones, Stan Lee, Joe Russo\n\nDirector: Anthony Russo,\n\nFace-booked this to Jon Buck:\n\nOf the current batch at Cineworld there are a lot in the 7 or 8 out of 10 range, but this, along with the other action sequel 300 Rise of an Empire are both pleasant surprises in that the films are much better than the trailers might suggest and IMHO are better than their respective first instalments. Please don't expect anything too challenging but if you like films where (ANOTHER SPOILER ALERT) the protagonists beat the odds to kick some serious mother fekkin' ass neither one lets you down. Can't wait for Godzilla\n\n250= :\n\nCaptive\n\n2015 Mark: 7 Watched Wed 30 September 2015\n\nStarring: David Oyewolo with Kate Mara, Michael K Williams\n\nDirector: Jerry Jameson\n\nI didn't like the God bits, but apart from that it was a reasonable story well delivered. I found the ambiguity of Oyewolo's carachter quite intresting, and I enjoy watching Omar's ascent up the billing, but yes, the post end end was a little \"what?\"\n\n250= :\n\nCharlie Countryman\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 5 November 2014\n\nStarring: Shia LaBeouf with Evan Rachel Wood, Mads Mikkelsen, Melissa Leo, Rupert Grint, James Buckley, Aubrey Plaza\n\nFor a few moments I thought this was going to be an 8 or 9. That it isnt is more to my optimism than any fault of the film, which enjoyed with a cocked eyebrow on occasions. To take away is Shia LaBeouf who made this well over a year ago and for me genuinely comes of age as a full blown star who carries the film throughout. As impressive a lead role as I have seen this year. Considering I love music, a good soundtrack is like a good referee, you dont tend to notice them, but this score, when I noticed it, was awesome. The picture was easy on the eye, and really seemed to impart that post communist Eastern European feel, reminding me of Serbia and Bulgaria. Now the films characters are kind of OK, but Jay (from the Inbetweeners ) and Ron Weasley seem to have wandered onto the wrong film set. The resolution of the film is (Spoiler alert!) just a little unsatisfying, and its a shame it didnt settle into being a Sixth Sense meets Taken instead of being greedy and putting the Chuckle Brothers in the mix. Whatever, enjoyable all the same\n\n250= :\n\nChef\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 22 April 2015\n\nStarring: Jon Favreau with Sofía Vergara, John Leguizamo, Scarlett Johansson, Oliver Platt, Bobby Cannavale, Dustin Hoffman, Robert Downey Jr\n\nDirector: Jon Favreau\n\nA feel-good film with a lame, predictably twee story, and somewhat idealistic views on human behaviour, nevertheless... I loved it. August Rush effect, I guess Jon Favreau's enthusiasm for the film (He wrote, directed and produced it as well) just pervades the movie, the love of food is infectious, the dialogue is snappy and the soundtrack most excellent. Grab a beer, get some nice food, snuggle up and watch this. But don't expect John Le Carré!\n\nPS. I don't know how many favours Jon Favreau called in, but this is one hell of a cast.\n\n250= :\n\nCommando\n\n1985 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sat 20 June 2015\n\nStarring: Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nDirector: Mark L. Lester\n\nForgot what happened, but I know I enjoyed it. A very good 7, with plenty of guns and ammo.\n\n250= :\n\nCuban Fury\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Thu 27 February 2014\n\nStarring: Nick Frost with Rashida Jones, Olivia Colman, Ian McShane, Chris O'Dowd\n\nDirector: James Griffiths\n\nNick Frost is great! He was good in The World's End, and given this role without being Simon Pegg's foil is welcome. Chris O'Dowd is the largest knob-stick you could imagine (credit to the actor), the story is predictable, the music great, the characters stereotyped, and whatever, going to watch this at the cinema in a giggling audience was a most pleasant couple of hours. There are so many things you can criticise films on, but why bother. This works within its own universe, and Nick Frost is perfect for the role. Sufficiently affable, poignant, but, above all, believable. It'll be a shame when he gets a TV series in which he plays a hard-bitten, world-weary cop in some new town between Birmingham and London, one who plays by his own rules and has troubles at home.\n\n250= :\n\nDanny Collins\n\n2015 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 1 June 2015\n\nStarring: Al Pacino with Annette Bening, Jennifer Garner, Bobby Cannavale, Christopher Plummer\n\nDirector: Dan Fogelman\n\nSo sue me when I go off on one here. John Lennon is overrated. This film has a soundtrack largely made up of post Beatles Lennon material, hell, I bought the albums, but the songs are just not great pop songs, more whingy folk, or nondescript rock. I'm not saying they are terrible, but John Lennon has never, since the Beatles, produced anything like as good as any amount of tracks from Band On The Run or Ram or My Brave Face, Live and Let Die, Mull Of Kintyre etc etc. If a fourteen year old kid went to his music teacher saying \" sir, sir!! I've written this song.. \" and gave him Imagine I am pretty sure it wouldn't end up in anybody's top thousand.\n\nIn this film, the monkey on Danny Collins' back is a version of Sweet Caroline and his finale is a variation on... Imagine. So, what I am trying to say is, for a music film, the tunes simply do not carry the punch.\n\nNow.. having let rip on the score the rest of the film is a reasonable 100 minutes. Al Pacino is disarmingly charming, Annette Benning likewise easy on the eye, it is not totally unsatisfying. Wish it had been Judee Sill music though\n\nQuestion: What made John Lennon great?\n\nAnswer: Paul McCartney\n\n250= :\n\nThe Darjeeling Limited\n\n2007 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 20 May 2015\n\nStarring: Jason Schwartzman with Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, Anjelica Huston, Waris Ahluwalia, Amara Karan, Natalie Portman, Bill Murray\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nWell it's a Wes Anderson film, with the width, colour, camerawork, humour and human nature that is so typical of him. Given that he always uses the same cast, I suppose one could get a little blasé about these films. Most people like The Life Aquatic and The Royal Tennenbaums. I love Rushmoor. As usual the choice of music is largely wonderful, and each frame is a picture in itself. If you like Anderson, you will like this.\n\n250= :\n\nDelicatessen\n\n2000 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 5 December 2014\n\nStarring: Dominique Pinon with Marie-Laure Dougnac, Jean-Claude Dreyfus\n\nDirectors: Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Marc Caro\n\nOnce again Becca has lent me an Ultra-French film, which is very different from what I am used to. I wish I had watched this with somebody so we could explore the ideas behind it, when it was set, what did so and so mean. I can't remember it being subtitled, but it definitely was. Would I prefer to watch this than Gravity Yes I would\n\n250= :\n\nDevil's Knot\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 16 June 2014\n\nStarring: Colin Firth with Reese Witherspoon\n\nDirector: Atom Egoyan\n\nThis was a well paced reflection on a true story. As with all these kinds of things it would be lovely to know the real true story, but this made a pretty convincing fist of it. (But that is what story tellers do... Having researched it a lot of people seem to agree about the thrust of this, which I will not repeat, 'cos that is what I don't do, as it were.\n\n250= :\n\nDonnie Brasco\n\n1997 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sat 10 October 2015\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp with Al Pacino. Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, Anne Heche, Paul Giamatti\n\nDirector: Mike Newell\n\nStraightforward mob v law movie, with some interesting carachters, great dialogue and reasonable (based on true) story. Why do the lawmen always come out as being the unloveable ones in these movies? Al pacino is really good in this.\n\n250= :\n\nDriving Miss Daisy\n\n1988 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 5 July 1905\n\nStarring: Morgan Freeman with Dan Aykroyd, Jessicca Tandy\n\nDirector: Bruce Beresford\n\nMore Hans Zimmer, more of a Antebellum tinted oil painting than a story\n\n250= :\n\nEnd Game\n\n2006 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sat 29 March 2014\n\nStarring: Cuba Gooding Jnr. with James Woods\n\nDirector: Andy Cheng\n\nOne of those straight to DVD action movies, very much in the vein of The Shooter. This might have rated higher if only I could have figured out what happened in the end. :(\n\n250= :\n\nEverest\n\n2015 Mark: 7 Watched Wed 23 September 2015\n\nStarring: Jason Clarke with Josh Brolin, John Hawkes, Robin Wright, Michael Kelly, Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley, Emily Watson, Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nDirector: Baltasar Kormákur\n\nI know I always compare films to Gravity, but it is a great benchmark, and fits the bill entirely here, in that we have a film that is very strong on the picture, and one can't complain about the actors. This edges it in that the scenery is as good or better, the story is a little more engaging, and it's kind of real life. It fails on some of the detail. Everest harder than K2? An Alpine Chough flying around at 18,000' ? Touching The Void set the benchmark for this kind of stuff at 4% of the budget\n\n250= :\n\nFlight\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sat 13 June 2015\n\nStarring: Denzel Washington with Don Cheadle, Kelly Reilly, Bruce Greenwood, John Goodman, Melissa Leo, Piers Morgan\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nA good film with some notable aspects, If you liked John Goodman in Lebowski, you will like him in this, and if you are a Denzel Washington fan, you will not be dissapointed. Whatever.\n\nIf anybody ever reads this who has watched the film, please contact me if you agree/disagree. SPOILER ALERT (a bit). If the portion of the film after the rough take-off and Denzel going to sleep, to it's landing was cut, and pasted at the end of the film, this could have been a more rewarding experience? Even more so with a little judicious editing??\n\n250= :\n\nFoxcatcher\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Thu 15 January 2015\n\nStarring: Channing Tatum with Steve Carell, Mark Ruffallo (n), Katie Holmes, Vanessa Redgrave\n\nDirector: Bennett Miller (n)\n\nThis would have made a terrific one hour documentary. The carachters are reasonable (Channing Tatum is a little bit like a lunky Keanu Reeves), Steve Carrell is very wierd, the story is worth watching through, but there was a little too much standing around looking moody to maintain the excitment. Definitely worth the watch, if only to pique the curiosity about the affair\n\n250= :\n\nFurious 7 aka Fast & Furious 7\n\n2015 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Thu 23 April 2015\n\nStarring: Vin Diesel with Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Kurt Russell, Jason Statham\n\nDirector: James Wan\n\nA deep, thoughtful exploration of the existential conflict between the perceived nature of human existence and the reality of reality. An almost Derridesque thesis that dissects the relationships of humanity, focusing on the thought at not just the conscious and tangible, but the deep, primal level, casting the shadow of dichotomy onto our mores, our, loves, our lives.\n\nP.S. It does what is says on the packet, it's fast, it's furious, and if you like this kind of thing you will love this. Seriously, the ending is wonderful.\n\n250= :\n\nThe General\n\n1926 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 16 September 2015\n\nStarring: Buster Keaton with Marion Mack\n\nDirectors: Clyde Bruckman, Buster Keaton\n\nThis sets so many precedents on this page, in that it is the oldest film so far reviewed (by several years) and it is the only original silent one so far. That makes it difficult to judge, but funddamentally I have to ask myself, how much enjoyment did I get from it?\n\nI saw it listed in a list of 100 great action movies, and as Machete from the same list was so brilliant, and that it might be a quiz question I gave it a shot. Was it a comedy or was it an action film? I think it was an early major Hollywood production trying to find out. Was the story good? Yes, it was OK. Compelling protagonist? Yes, I got a bit mixed up with the bit parts, but Keaton and his girl were easy to identify with. Was the action good? Yes, it actually was great, a little more slapstick than Kung Fu Hustle, nevertheless it had a wow factor, especially taken in context. The acting? Brilliant, in that these people had to convey words through actions (there were dialogue cards, but they were relatively few and far between), so the exagerrated motions really feed the imagination.\n\nIn addisition these old films always carry a nostalgia factor that perhaps adds to their enjoyment quotient, so this film turns out to be more enjoyable than say Entourage and any amount of reasonable cinema-fodder. Glad I watched it.\n\nJust an afterthought: Is this film the victim of hype? Yes, I think so. On release it was slated and then forgotten about, then all of a sudden it becomes one of the best movies ever made, like somehow it has gone through a metamorphosis. It has been the same film all along, reasonably intresting, reasonably well made, and well acted. The Southern cause (i.e. slavery) was wrong. It didn't just become wrong in 1968, therefore it is difficult to root for a side which uses appeal to loyalty rather than logic as its battle cry. There is the wierd undercurrent of comedy which I do believe could have been left out. Anyhoo, it is not me who should be justifying my opinion, it should be the consegneti who appear to have gone through a Van Goughesque change of mind.\n\n250= :\n\nThe Godfather Part II\n\n1973 Mark: 7\n\nStarring: Robert De Niro with Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nGood, but not that good\n\n250= :\n\nHeat\n\n1995 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 22 December 2014\n\nStarring: Al Pacino with Robert DiNiro, Jon Voight, Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo, Tone Loc, Ashley Judd, Hank Azaria, Tom Sizemore, Bill Fitchner\n\nDirector: Michael Mann\n\nA very good film with a stellar cast, if anything subsumed within the whole cops and robbers oeuvre to such an extent that three days and two films and half a bottle of gin after watching it I can't really remember that much about the story. I suppose I could easily watch it again and enjoy it. You have gotta like Al Pacino.\n\n250= :\n\nThe Hobbit 3: The Battle of the Five Armies\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 12 December 2014\n\nStarring: Martin Freeman with Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Evangeline Lilly, Lee Pace, Luke Evans, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ken Stott, James Nesbitt, Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Orlando Bloom\n\nDirector: Peter Jackson\n\nThe must see film for December 2014, it was merely OK, with good shit to watch but not a great story and the characters had already been developed, so ... I really think perhaps two or even one long film would have done for The Hobbit, I don't know if I would have felt differently if I hadn't read the book at least 10 times, and there is no two ways about it, Peter Jackson set the benchmark with Fellowship, but this trilogy just felt as if it were padded out. Game of Thrones gets the distillation of books about right, leaving one wishing for more, excited about the prospects. This doesn't.\n\n250= :\n\nThe Hunger Games: 2 Catching Fire\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 25 November 2013\n\nStarring: Jennifer Lawrence with Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Phillip Seymour Hoffman\n\nDirector: Francis Lawrence\n\nMade me want to read the third book to by-pass the two parter third instalment. Reasonable Lost meets The Hunger Games 1. It is better than the first, in that it works within its own universe whereas number one didn't make sense in any imagination I could comprehend\n\n250= :\n\nThe Hunger Games: 3 Mockingjay Part 1\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 24 November 2014\n\nStarring: Jennifer Lawrence with Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Phillip Seymour Hoffman\n\nDirector: Francis Lawrence\n\nAnother notch up the scale. I reckon I never really enjoyed the constraints of the first two films once 'the Games' were on. In this third film there are no games therefore it becomes more difficult for the film makers just to invent shit, and, for me, this makes for a much more satisfying film. Do I detect the cast getting better as well, or is it just familiarity?? Now that I have adopted Jennifer Lawrence I realise that her Katniss mode kind of works, the action was good, the story meaty enough, the characters good, the music excellent and all in all it is a perfect set-up for the last instalment without being just that alone. I now officially want a Mockingjay badge.\n\n250= :\n\nThe Infidel\n\n2010 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sat 21 February 2015\n\nStarring: Omid Djalili with Richard Schiff, Yigal Naor, Matt Lucas\n\nDirector: Josh Appignanesi\n\nGreat idea, or at least a cool variation of the Trading Places trope. Omid Djaliliilays a very becoming role which has fun with the concept, illustrates some obvious what ifs but somehow fails in the end, by justifying religion, rather than delivering the coup de grace which it could, and should, have done with ease. The end veers into the oh really? bracket (that is a negative criticism, BTW)\n\n250= :\n\nInherent Vice\n\n2015 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Thu 12 February 2015\n\nStarring: Joaquin Phoenix with Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson, Katherine Waterston, Reese Witherspoon, Benicio del Toro, Jena Malone, Joanna Newsom, Martin Short\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nI am not qualified to review this film, as I was late for it and nodded off several times. I don't think that was the fault of the film, as everything was engaging about it, but just lack of attention on my part, and a reasonably complex thread was not conducive to true appreciation. I will watch it again and am sure I will love it! I enjoyed what I saw, with a cool cast and great dialogue.\n\n250= :\n\nInterstellar\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 12 November 2014\n\nStarring: Matthew McConaughey with Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Matt Damon\n\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\n\nI liked this. Yes, there were criticisms that might be levelled, but one gets your money's worth, on this three hour 'epic'. A catch-all 7, which surprised me 'cos I imagined that I would either love it or hate it, given the hoo ha that has pervaded the media about it. I do think that arty critics struggle with science films, and it did seem that opinion was very divided on it, nevertheless I am kind of ambivalent. It was a good yarn, well made and I would definitely say it was worth sharing the cost of a ticket on Orange Wednesday. Matt Damon does look like Mark Whalberg, especially in this film, for which I would put him in the mix for best support.\n\n250= :\n\nIron Man 3\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 22 October 2014\n\nStarring: Robert Downey Jnr with Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall, Jon Favreau, Ben Kingsley.\n\nDirector: Shane Black\n\nThese Marvel films do tend to merge and i forget actually how many points I should really give them. I certainly could not watch this kind of film at the expense of all others, nevertheless it is an entertaining night in, I suppose if I was deep into the cannon it may be quite challenging. You more or less know what to expect with these.\n\n250= :\n\nJack Reacher\n\n2012 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sat 1 August 2015\n\nStarring: Tom Cruise with Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins, Werner Herzog, David Oyelowo, Jai Courtney, Robert Duvall\n\nDirector: Christopher McQuarrie\n\nOnce you have swallowed that Tom Cruise is six foot eight, hard as fuck and has perfect memory, this is quite an enjoyable film! Yeah, I must admit, one can get bored with fights and car chases, but very solid 7\n\n250= :\n\nJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 3 March 2014\n\nStarring: Chris Pine with Kenneth Brannagh, Kevin Costner, Kiera Knightly\n\nDirector: Kenneth Brannagh\n\nReasonable action movie, everybody plays their parts and the goodies win. Who is the best Jack Ryan? Baldwin, though Chris Pine is perfectly good in this. Wish he had had a couple of flaws though.\n\nNonso Anozie plays the part of the heavy who attempts to assassinate Jack in his hotel room. Who the devil did he play that I recognise. Wiki wiki wik.... Ah, of course, Xaro Xhoan Daxos from Game Of Thrones. How TF did he escape?\n\n250= :\n\nJames Bond 18; Tomorrow Never Dies\n\n1997 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 4 March 2014\n\nStarring: Piers Brosnan with Jonathan Pryce, Michelle Yeoh Teri Hatcher, Judi Dench\n\nDirector: Roger Spottisoode\n\nHow long has it taken me to watch this film? Well I'm glad I did. Don't expect anything but ridiculous innuendo and overtime for stuntmen as Piers defeats an absolutely potty English Megalomaniac super-villain who aims to further his ends in the most ridiculously inefficient, convoluted and entertaing way imaginable.\n\n250= :\n\nJames Bond 23: Skyfall\n\n2012 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sat 15 March 2014\n\nStarring: Daniel Craig with Judy Dench, Javier Bardem\n\nDirector: Sam Mendes\n\nGreat start. The start is up there with great starts. But then... I've done something I've not done yet, and retain the option to alter this review, but I haven't finished watching the film yet. It's just got drawn out far too much in that middle third. Judy Dench and Token I find annoying, but I did like the new Q.\n\n250= :\n\nJames Bond 24; Spectre\n\n2015 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 28 October 2015\n\nStarring: Daniel Craig with \"Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, Ralph Fiennes \"\n\nDirector: Sam Mendes\n\nThese are so, so, much better than most of the earlier films, but they seem more a collection of magnificent set pieces than a coherent story. I definitely reckon Christoph Waltz was underutilised, almost seeming to parody himself. He is more convincing in Big Eyes where, as always, he essentially plays the same part. Worth the watch , but on review, for all their magnificence and huge budgets, neither of the the two films I saw today, this and Pan, were more enjoyable than Locke, which was Tom Hardy sat in a car\n\n250= :\n\nThe Judge\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 20 October 2014\n\nStarring: Robert Downey Jr with Robert Duvall (n), Billy Bob Thornton\n\nDirector: David Dobkin\n\nSometimes a little mushy, occasionaly funny with the odd surprise. Robert Downey Junior never seems quite serious enough, but Robert Duvall is awesome. Considering my penchant for daddy films I guess this is a low score, yet it was enjoyable enough. Nice Thomas Newman soundtrack, The story reasonable, and I can't stress how that Judge stole the show. Him or Dominic West for Best Supporting Actor\n\n250= :\n\nJurassic World\n\n2015 Mark: 7 Watched Thu 11 June 2015\n\nStarring: Chris Pratt with Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Omar Sy, B. D. Wong,, Irrfan Khan\n\nDirector: Colin Trevorrow\n\nThe burning question is, how does this film stack up against 1, 2 and 3? At a rough guess (memory fades) precedence would go 1 (outstanding and original), 2 (funny), 4 and 3. Although a pleasant enough watch it doesn't really bring anything new to the table (My favourite aspect was the, still brilliant, musical motifs). Perhaps I am becoming inured to action movies, but this is all that is. The kids are quite annoying (weren't they always?) The dinosaurs are only as impressive as those from over two decades ago, and the owners of the island are every bit just as stupid. I enjoyed the film, but it did not make my life more complete. My daughter is in love with Chris Pratt, so I'll give him a tick. He is definitely an improvement on Sam Neill.\n\n250= :\n\nLa Bamba\n\n1987 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 14 May 2014\n\nStarring: Lou Diamond Phillips with Joe Pantoliano, Marshall Crenshaw, Brian Setzer\n\nDirector: David Gordon Green\n\nL learned somethings from this film regarding the history of popular music, I enjoyed the music, and although the interpersonal relationshios were a little sludgy all in all I would not mind watching a film like this every day\n\n250= :\n\nLast Vegas\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 13 January 2013\n\nStarring: Kevin Klein with Mary Steenburgen, Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman\n\nI was not particularly looking forward to this, but after a while I cracked and was well glad. I mean, who wants to see for old actors resting on their laurels? The thing is though, although you will not want for gags, in a way their was some restraint, especially Robert DiNero who was pretty grumpy throughout, which, after The Family and a string of 'comedic' performances was more like it. Enough of the film came out as being believable to tip the balance in it's favour. Pretty solid seven which makes it a great trip to the cinema and well worth recording in two years time.\n\nI think the clincher was using September by Earth Wind and Fire during the film and over the end credits. Night at The Museum, The Ringer.. That is three out of three genuine feel good films that use this superb track to capture their objective\n\nOh, and guys, if you are reading this I put Kev in the lead actor role because I just did. Apologies, Mike, Morgan and Bob.\n\n250= :\n\nThe Lavender Hill Mob\n\n1951 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 14 January 2014\n\nStarring: Alec Guinness with Stanley Holloway, Sid James, Alfie Bass, Audrey Hepburn!, Robert Shaw!\n\nEaling comedy. Thoroughly enjoyable, Interesting, funny stereotypes, reasonable story, very dated, but hell, what is there not to like about it? Alec Guiness is a good actor\n\n250= :\n\nThe Legend Of Bagger Vance\n\n2000 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 5 December 2014\n\nStarring: Will Smith with Matt Damon, Charlize Theron, Jack Lemmon, Bruce McGill, Lane Smith, Joel Getch\n\nDirector: Robert Redford\n\nThis film had its moments, but was embarrassingly Schmaltzy (Can't spell that word), weird in terms of its own continuity, From the sun being above the horizon to being pitch dark in the space of one golf hole, and didn't really have a message, other than golf is a great game. But golf is a game which people love anyway, and you don't need a magic nigger. I liked all the actors, the scenery and music (bar Will Smith who just never seems to do it for me). Robert Redford should do the film of the Menlo 8.\n\n250= :\n\nLet's Be Cops\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 1 September 2014\n\nStarring: Jake Johnson with Damon Wayans Jr, Nina Dobrev, James D'Arcy, Andy García, Jon Lajoie\n\nDirector: Luke Greenfield\n\nRock solid comedy/action, with a good premise well executed. Jon Lajoile as Todd? Who was that? Ah yes, the bloke who I initially thought was Adam Scott, playing very much the same role. It'll be intresting to see how other peole regard this, I think it would be easy to get snotty about it, perhaps I have? Happy endings n all. Not challenging but does what it says on the packet.\n\n250= :\n\nLife After Beth\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 6 October 2014\n\nStarring: Aubrey Plaza with Dane DeHaan, John C. Reilly, Molly Shannon\n\nDirector: Jeff Baena\n\nZombie films make better comedies than Zombie films, and this is a case in point. It trundles along with enough comedy, titilation and make up to maintain the intrest, Dane DeHaan is really the lead in this, and it is just unpredictable enough to keep the film fresh.\n\n250= :\n\nLong Way Down, A\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 2 April 2014\n\nStarring: Peirce Brosnan with Imogen Poots, Rosamund Pike, Sam Neill. Toni Colette\n\nNothing wrong with watching this on an afternoon suckin' a Doctor Peppers. Aaron Paul kind of steps up for this, so all in all it was a reasonable entertaining watch. Brosnan actually puts in an annoyingly good performance. Watch it and think about it and the part he is playing. Even Sam Neill comes out smelling of roses. Imogen Poots along with Paul redeems herself after Need For Speed - yeah  that'll do!\n\n250= :\n\nLooper\n\n2012 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 20 April 2014\n\nStarring: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, with Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt.\n\nDirector: Rian Johnson\n\nThis makes me want to go and watch Memento and Inception again. Good film, solid story and concept, solid performances all round.\n\n250= :\n\nLucky Number Sleven\n\n2006 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 19 February 2014\n\nStarring: Josh Hartnett with Lucy Liu, Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci, Ben Kingsley\n\nSeven it is! Yeah! Good film, great cast, good story decent carachters. Bruce Willis has done a lot of fucking ace films!\n\n250= :\n\nMaleficent\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 9 June 2014\n\nStarring: Angelina Jolie with Sharlto Copley, Elle Fanning, Sam Riley, Imelda Staunton\n\nDirector: Robert Stromberg\n\nThis turned out to be better than I thought it would be. Ther best recent retake on a tale is Mirror Mirror, yet this came out with genuine credit\n\n250= :\n\nThe Man\n\n2005 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Thu 20 February 2014\n\nStarring: Samuel L Jackson with Eugene Levy\n\nYou know, somethimes there is nothing wrong with Samuel L Jackson just being given a platform to be Samuel L Jackson (though AFAIK he didn't say 'motherfucker' once.) I should really write more about the plots to remind me in future; basically an out of town dental product salesman gets mixed up with crime in Detroit with hilarious consequenses. Luke Goss is a very good, very typical Anglo- villain but, maybe it just caught me in a good mood, Eugene Levy is just superb, every nuance, subtle carachter change. I doubt this was up for awards at The Venice Film Festival, but it is a long long time since I laughed at a fart scene, but this film carries it!! It is only snobbishness which stops me giving it 7.5.\n\nI am sooo glad I wrote my review first. This is what it says on Wikipedia\n\nThe Man was blasted by critics, many of whom shared the opinion that the plot was pointless and its jokes rehashed. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes currently reports that the film holds a score of 11% based on 100 reviews.For his two 2005 performances in The Man and Cheaper by the Dozen 2, Eugene Levy received a Razzie nomination for Worst Supporting Actor\n\nIn retrospect, my point is that he (Levy) is meant to be like he is, the script was meant to be cartoon carachters with Tom and Jerry viloence and gags. And definitely not a pointless plot. And every gag is rehashed. Faggots.\n\n250= :\n\nNelson Mendela; Long Walk To Freedom\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 20 January 2014\n\nStarring: Idris Elba\n\nFascinating story, you almost think they could have made a three parter. With Invictus being the last instalment\n\n250= :\n\nMe and Earl and the Dying Girl\n\n2015 Mark: 7 Watched Sun 6 September 2015\n\nStarring: Thomas Mann with Olivia Cooke\n\nDirectors Alfonso Gomez-Rejon\n\nI thought it might be Fault In Our Stars y. It damn well was, what a terrible double header that would be. Having said that things generally worked in this film, Thomas Mann seemed like a young deadpan Bill Murray, and though quirky in the extreme, I felt generally more invested in it as it went along. I'm going to write this down now and see if I've said it already. Olivia Cooke is from Oldham! (No I haven't; she was in that horror film Ouija\n\n250= :\n\nMicmacs\n\n2009 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 9 December 2014\n\nStarring: Dany Boon with Dominique Pinon\n\nDirector: Jean-Pierre Jeunet\n\nAnother lend from Rebecca, another monochromy French film watched with subtitles. These films I am watching from her have very simialar ensembles of very quirky carachters doing insane shit. Apart from being a companion to Delicatessen I reckon it would make a decent triple with Blood Diamond and the magnificent Lord Of War In the context of looking at corruption and exploitation between the west and the rest\n\n250= :\n\nMidnight Cowboy\n\n1968 Mark: 7\n\nStarring: Dustin Hoffman with Jon Voight\n\nDirector: John Schlesinger\n\nI could be persuaded to watch this again to up its rating\n\n250= :\n\nMinions\n\n2015 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 10 June 2015\n\nStarring: Sandra Bullock with Chris Renaud, Pierre Coffin\n\nDirector: Kyle Balda, Pierre Coffin\n\nSorry fans, but I never quite got on with Despicable Me (Russell Brand gets on my tits), Whatever, given my reticence, this turned out OK for me, with arguably the best animated rendering of real places that I can remember seeing since Shaun The Sheep, if not eva. It kind of has that family friendly irreverance that provides an edge, albiet not dangerously sharp, but if you are looking for mayhem in London, check out Paddington first\n\n250= :\n\nMission: Impossible 5: Rogue Nation\n\n2015 Mark: 7 Watched Fri 31 July 2015\n\nStarring: Tom Cruise with Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, Alec Baldwin\n\nDirector: Christopher McQuarrie\n\nThis is actually a spoof of the series, Simon Pegg is exactly what you would expect, like a Chuckle Brother, despite which, this is a film that is quite a reasonable add to the watch list. Go and watch Spy, or especially Kingsman for a better version of this kind of thing, but don't write this off because of the excellence of them.\n\n250= :\n\nThe Monuments Men\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 16 February 2014\n\nStarring: George Clooney with Kate Blanchet, John Goodman, Jean Du Jardin, Matt Damon\n\nDirector: George Clooney\n\nFalling almost into the bracket of 'good for quiz purposes', This provides a fascinating look at the choices we face in war time, and the values we place on things on life in general. Definite moist eye moment in the hospital, all star cast, like Last Vegas, except its not in Las Vegas and they are getting shot at and the actors are 25 years younger (at least) and just about everything else. For some reason I found it hard to grade this film, but we'll stick at a tenous 7, for a film which maintained the interest and informed\n\n250= :\n\nMrs. Brown's Boys D'movie\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 14 July 2014\n\nStarring: Brendan O'Connell\n\nDirector: Ben Kellett\n\nThere was something quite refreshing about this. £3 million budget, critically rejected, 9 mil at the box-office so far, a little self conscious, nevertheless, funny, endearing, with an ability to retain investment the longer it went on. There was a Wilhelm scream on the bridge, but that is a good thing. There was a barrister with tourretes, I think more in a fishing for laughs rather than an homage to Not Another Teen Movie which failed a little, nevertheless the breaking of the fourth wall varied from expected to genuinely becoming. A caper, not quite in the league of The Parole Officer yet one which provided a nice evening at the flicks, and an antidote to Transformers 4 which ran a little too long\n\n250= :\n\nMud\n\n2012 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 26 October 2015\n\nStarring: Matthew McConaughey with Tye Sheridan, Reese Witherspoon, Jacob Lofland, Sam Shepard, Ray McKinnon, Sarah Paulson, Michael Shannon, Joe Don Baker, Paul Sparks\n\nDirector: Jeff Nichols\n\nA very very solid seven, i.e. It was not weighed down by any expectation, therefore having taped it from film four, it provided an entertaining night in. All aspects of the film were spot on, it is a reflection on how good modern films generally are. Two members of the Boardwalk Empire cast were there, and all cast members have a degree of backstory. I know it doesn't make any difference to the value of the film, but it has some fascination!\n\n250= :\n\nNot Another Teen Movie\n\n2001 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Thu 10 July 2014\n\nStarring: Chris Evans with Chyler Leigh, Jaime Pressly, Paul Gleason\n\nDirector: Joel Gallen\n\nI couldn't help but get sucked into this relentless barage of grossness and (deliberate) cliché. I guess it needed doing, even if most teen movies parody themselves anyway. I feel really guilty but it was more or less thoroughly entertaining with some real LOL moments. Now I've marked and reviewed it I am keen to see what the critics have to say...\n\n250= :\n\nOlympus Has Fallen\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 11 April 2014\n\nStarring: Gerard Butler with Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Ashley Judd, Melissa Leo\n\nDirector: Antoine Fuqua\n\nThis is, given that it could have been terrible, frikkin' awesome! An entry into my top 100 quotes: .Mike Banning (ie Gerard Butler) to Kang \"Why don't you and I play a game of fuck off. You go first....\"\n\n250= :\n\nPacific Rim\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 6 June 2014\n\nStarring: Charlie Hunnam with Idris Elba, Ron Perlman\n\nDirector: Guilermo Del Toro\n\nMonster movie. A no-holds barred, no laws of science sacrosant, big tableau, loud noises, heroes and villains, colourful, mother-fucker of a MONSTER movie..... I'm not sure if the Top Gun triumphalism in parts wasn't totally toungue in cheek, I reckon if I'd have been a kid I might have absolutely loved this. Both this and Godzilla turned out in some ways better than I expected, if not quite carrying the satisfaction of intrigue or surprise within the story. I've said something like this before, but if they do a crossover film between them... Wow!\n\nI suppose this could apply to most films, but watch it on the biggest screen you can.\n\n250= :\n\nPaul\n\n2011 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 23 November 2014\n\nStarring: Seth Rogen with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jason Bateman, Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Blythe Danner, David Koechner, Sigourney Weaver, Jeffrey Tambor\n\nDirector: Greg Mottola\n\nThere is little to fault about films like this, good to see Jeffrey Tambor and Jaseon Bateman from Arrested Development in the same film, Nick Frost and Simon pegg do precisely what they always do, Paul, an alien, was as convincing a bit of CGI / Stop Motion / whatever that I have seen so far, and Kristen Wiig was really funny! (I thought she was Amy Adams). I love movies.\n\n250= :\n\nRebecca\n\n1940 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 16 August 2015\n\nStarring: Laurence Olivier with Joan Fontaine, Judith Anderson, George Sanders, Leo G Carroll, C. Aubrey Smith\n\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\n\nQuite a jolly film that maintained my attention all the way through, kind of glad I could wallow in it alone, it has that stiff upper lipness about it, exaggerated theatre, it really is quite becoming. Joan Fonteyn is a peach.\n\n250= :\n\nRobin Hood\n\n2010 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 31 January 2014\n\nStarring: Russell Crowe with Cate Blanchett, Oscar Isaac, Mark Strong\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nPleasantly good. a very different take on The Robin Hood Story, very thin on history, Russell Crowe's accent is quite as unusual as people have warned, nevertheless it was a pretty solid watch. They should really make a sequel. In fact this film was only the prequel; I would willingly pay to see the follow-up.\n\n250= :\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums\n\n2001 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 14 January 2015\n\nStarring: Gene Hackman with Anjelica Huston, Bill Murray, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Danny Glover\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nWorth a watch for the cast alone. I love watching Wes Anderson Films, but sometimes I feel like I am missing something, that they are a platform for beautifully fully saturated cinematagrophy and marvellously quirky carachters rather than a story. Oh come on though, it was fun to watch, I especially liked Gwyneth Paltrow and Gene Hackman\n\n250= :\n\nSan Andreas\n\n2015 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 29 May 2015\n\nStarring: Dwayne Johnson with Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario, Art Parkinson, Paul Giamatti.\n\nDirector: Brad Peyton\n\nOK, let's put this out there. This is no Being John Malkovich. I think you can just about guess what you are going to get when you get your ticket torn with this one, so you have a cast which read the script and look suitably excited/stressed/determined/moody and a story which could be described is a short sentence and a chief protagonist who's jaw dropping dereliction of duty is exceeded only by the spectacular special effects. And there is the redeeming factor. I would seriously consider this to be the most impressive quality I have seen for a film of this genre. I just might be persuaded to go back and watch it in 3d and/or Imax. Perhaps it caught me in a good mood, but it is one of those rare films which I consider well worth the watch just because of the picture itself. There, I've said it.\n\n's up for Art Parkison (Rickon Stark) who provides some half decent humour and steals most of his scenes\n\n250= :\n\nShooter\n\n2007 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 26 February 2014\n\nStarring: Mark Whalberg with Kate Mara, Michael Peña, Danny Glover, Ned Beatty\n\nDirector: Antoine Fuqua\n\nI keep forgetting that 7 is Not bad at all  Good film. I suppose this should start with an An enjoyable enough romp... Am I struggling to describe the qualities of this film? -Yes! There's guns, and dick-heads and explosions and triumph against the odds. I suppose it is the kind of perfect film to watch with a couple of large G&T's in that if the alcohol combines with senility to diminish memory of such things I am pretty sure you will not have forgotton anything critical. As a noveau Whalbergian I appreciate the artistic sensibilities of this movie. Those who like this would also like The Expendables, Die Hard.... etc. P.S. Is Ned Beatty A ringer for John Heard (Govenor Tancredi in Prison Break )\n\nPPS. Some film critics, both liberal and conservative, saw the film as left-leaning in its politics, arguing that the main villain (Senator Meachum) was a clear analogy for Dick Cheney\n\n250= :\n\nShutter Island\n\n2010 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 16 November 2014\n\nStarring: Leonardo DiCaprio with Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nThere is a third aspect of a good story that I don't mention (I am always banging on about how important plot and characters are), and that is surprise, so for example, The Sixth Sense gets a massive boost up once it has concluded. Likewise this beautifully filmed thriller is resolved most excellently, and, in retrospect, fairly unambiguously. I reckon it is worth watching just so you can discuss it!\n\nOne may need to try to maintain attention during periods of this film if, like me, you watch it at bed time\n\n250= :\n\nSnow White And The Huntsman\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 3 May 2015\n\nStarring: Kristen Stewart with Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Sam Claflin, Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost\n\nDirector: Rupert Sanders\n\nI liked this more than I thought I would, it just wasn't as much fun as Mirror Mirror nevertheless it was still a good watch. If you look at the cast, I only recognised Chris hemsworth, the dwarves... like what a line up of stars (Oh I recognised Toby Jones as well. What really cheesed me off that I failed to recognise Marlooe beach, our favourite place in Pembrokeshire!\n\n250= :\n\nSolace\n\n2015 Mark: 7 Watched Thu 1 October 2015\n\nStarring: Abbie Cornish with Anthony Hopkins, Colin Farrell\n\nDirector: Alfonso Poyart\n\nI was warned that the ending was flagged up miles before it happened. I missed it, consequently was engaged by a film that was visually very competent, a cast that I felt I knew on a personal level, and an original (at least for me), slightly, but engagingly, fantastical story arc that propelled me another two hours closer to my death, but pleasantly so! Hopkins was a slightly straighter version of Hannibal, Colin Farrell had a quite an amazing part, leaving you thinking, was he bad, or was he good? Well I liked it anyway\n\n250= :\n\nSouthpaw\n\n2015 Mark: 7 Watched Fri 31 July 2015\n\nStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal with Forest Whitaker, Rachel McAdams, Naomie Harris, Victor Ortiz, Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson, Miguel Gomez, Oona Laurence, Rita Ora\n\nDirector: Antoine Fuqua\n\nIn the prices list for the 2015 Oscar, it will not win. Not to say it's not a well made film that tells an engaging tale, just that it will not win. If you had to describe an arc of a boxing film between sips of beer, you could quite easily have come out with this.\n\n250= :\n\nSpooks: The Greater Good\n\n2015 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Thu 14 May 2015\n\nStarring: Kit Hartington with Peter Firth, Jennifer Ehle, Elyes Gabel, Tuppence Middleton\n\nDirector: Bharat Nalluri\n\nJohn Snow is really making a name for himself. A reasonable watch, I enjoyed it, a notch above James Bond and a notch below John Le Carré in terms of the seriousness of the contents. Dare I say it seemed a little too PC, apart from the Arabs (who we know are all bad guys). Actually, when I think about it, the criminal mastermind had some good qualities.\n\n250= :\n\nSweet Sixteen\n\n2002 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 4 May 2015\n\nStarring: Martin Compston with William Ruane\n\nDirector: Ken Loach\n\nIt's grim up North. Lacking the feelgood factor which we have enjoyed in The Angel's Share and Looking For Eric this has the odd flash of humour and the usual exquisitely regional dialogue, but is altogether a deal bleaker, hence the lower rating. It is not a worse film, it is just a more uncomfortable one. It won the Screenplay award at Cannes and only grossed just over £300,000.\n\n250= :\n\nTaken\n\n2008 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 13 August 2014\n\nStarring: Liam Neeson with Maggie Grace, Holly Valance\n\nDirector: Pierre Morel\n\nScores marginally more than Driven to Kill and 3 Days to Kill because of Liam Neeson, yet it is pretty much the same story, just ropey enough to not convince me that it is a real world, nevertheless if 1400 kids in Rotherham can be trafficked (how do you spell that world), I guess this might have some credibility\n\n250= :\n\nTaken 3\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 12 January 2015\n\nStarring: Liam Neeson with Maggie Grace, Forest Whitaker\n\nDirector: Olivier Megaton\n\nCrazy fun from Liam Neeson. The plot devices used during this film are incredibly impossible, nevertheless, it is fun to watch. I am sure the scriptwriters must have sat round a table and thrown out any ideas that were feasable in terms of rational actions on the part of the carachters, just watch it and you will see what I mean. Whatever next? Cop eatin' a donut?\n\n250= :\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Thu 23 October 2014\n\nStarring: Megan Fox with Bill Fitchner, Will Arnett. Johnny Knoxville, Whoopie Goldberg Jonathan Liebesman\n\nGreat first half hour and Bill Fitchner (playing Bill Fitchner) tops of an awesome cast. The last hour is exactly what you would expect from Michael Bey, and so when you nod off you probably don't leave yourself many unanswerd questions. What I want to muse upon is the addition of value to a film by 'stars' i.e. I've mentioned Fitchner, but as I am currently watching Arrested Development I really enyoyed watching Will Arnett. Jonny Knoxvilles voice was amusing, Whoopie Goldberg. I guess I am a sucker for familiarity. Stupid humans!\n\n250= :\n\nThe Terminator\n\n1984 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sat 4 July 2015\n\nStarring: Arnold Schwarzenegger with Michael Biehn, Linda Hamilton\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nA must-watch film, elevated in public perception way way beyond its original budget. Linda Hamilton sucks a bit, and Arnie delivers his almost defining role. A thought provoking concept, a little gratuitous at times, the science is definitely stretchy, but what the hell, why not?\n\n250= :\n\nTomorrowland\n\n2015 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 22 May 2015\n\nStarring: Britt Robertson with George Clooney, Hugh Laurie, Raffey Cassidy, Tim McGraw\n\nDirector: Brad Bird\n\nSitting writing about this and I want to mark it up, nevertheless I'll leave it at the 7 I gave it three quarters of the way through, in that it was cram full of stunning scenes and action, and an absolutely brilliant speech from Hugh Laurie, when the girl looked up from designing cars at the end it kind of exposed it as the cop out it was. SPOILER ALERT, the film is based on the premise that if you are optimistic everything will be peachy. That is a complete non sequiteur\n\n250= :\n\nTransformers 4: Age Of Extinction\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 14 July 2014\n\nStarring: Mark Whalberg with Stanley Tucci, Kelsey Grammer, Nicola Peltz, Jack Reynor, Peter Cullen, John Goodman, Ken Watanabe\n\nDirector: Michael Bay\n\nThis might have been better with 30 minutes of editing. It was enjoyable, the cast, were great and/or hot (Whalberg most excellent, Tucci goes from strength to strength), the cinematography and music outstanding. It did roll on for a long time though. Definitely worth the watch, but go to the bog before it starts.\n\n250= :\n\nTremors\n\n1990 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Thu 30 January 2014\n\nStarring: Kevin Bacon with Ariana Richards, Fred Ward\n\nHilarious. Very toungue in cheek monster movie, Ridiculous concept, ham, acting, cheesy dialogue. 98% on Rotten Tomatos!!! WTF?\n\n250= :\n\nTroll Hunter\n\n2011 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 3 August 2015\n\nStarring: Otto Jespersen\n\nDirector: André Øvreda\n\nQuirky. As me Julia pointed out Otto Jespersen (Hans the trollhunter) should be employed in every single Hollywood blockbuster henceforth, as your go to Scandinavian. The 'kids' in the film kind of got on my nerves because a) The lad looked and acted like Ant McPartland and b) The girl did nothing but make stupid faces at the camera. CGI now has to be very impressive to impress. It is comedic without being a laugh a minute and I think perhaps I was nervous watching it with a large group to let myself get lost in it. Whatever, for fans of Scandinavian horror/comic/mocumentary it is a must-see.\n\nWhere the hell have I seen the beginning of this film before?\n\n250= :\n\nThe Truman Show\n\n1998 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 12 July 2011\n\nStarring: Jim Carrey with Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Ed Harris, Natascha McElhone\n\nDirector: Peter Weir\n\nA fresh watch even though I have seen it before. I really feel uncomfortable with universes that behave irrationally given their context, I mean a story teller can create the stage he wants, why does he have to make it go off at a tangent to itself? For example, the outside of the set for The Truman Show was shown in Hollywood. Why did they just not build it in Florida on the coast where the film was filmed and where you can have sea and islands. Are you telling me they kept a nuclear power station set on standby for thirty years on the off chance that he might just kidnap his wife and force her to drive over a bridge? It didn't have to be that way.\n\nEd Harris was brilliant as homo-artistic-malevolant Christophe and was it the Philip Glass part of the score which was outstanding or was it the other guy's? Was the concept believable? - yes, I am pretty sure that Space Cadets indicated that you could pick people who would suspend any amount of disbelief for any amount of time.\n\n250= :\n\nUnbreakable\n\n2000 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Thu 10 September 2015\n\nStarring: Bruce Willis with Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright, Charlayne Woodard, M. Night Shyamalan, Michael Kelly\n\nDirector: M. Night Shyamalan\n\nI watched this om the advisement of Mark Laycock, after dissing The Visit True to form it slots in to the Shyalaman timeline, in that it is not quite up there with The Sixth Sense, but definitely trumps Signs. The trouble is KIND OF SPOILER ALERT, the moment you know it is Shyalaman, you are looking for the twist. My wish is that he does a film but keeps his name under wraps, and that he actually abandons ideas of making another masterpiece and builds a story for its own sake, not just for the denoument. Look.. this is a good film, but it is not In Bruges\n\n250= :\n\nUnder Siege 1\n\n1992 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 5 July 1905\n\nStarring: Steven Segal with Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey, Colm Meaney\n\nLook.. It's only a film. With guns, and explosions and macho one liners.\n\n250= :\n\nUnder Siege 2  Dark Territory\n\n1995 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 14 January 2014\n\nStarring: Steven Segal with Katherine Heigl\n\nLook.. It's only a film. With guns, and explosions and macho one liners.\n\n250= :\n\nUnfriended\n\n2015 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sat 2 May 2015\n\nStarring: Shelley Hennig\n\nDirector: Levan Gabriadze\n\nSPOILER ALERT: five or six American teens get embroiled in spooky shit, but instead of running away ASAP, they get dragged in, with frightening consequences. The thing is with this it is very originally and cleverly done, and maintains the interest for the short running time of less than 90 minutes (Watch it, you will see what I mean). Good story, good cast, good concept, the most original horror film since Blair Witch\n\n250= :\n\nThe Way Back\n\n2010 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 15 April 2014\n\nStarring: Jim Sturgess with Ed Harris, Colin Farrell, Mark Strong\n\nDirector: Peter Wier\n\nReasonable watch/ Colin Farrell and Mark Strong are unexpected, Ed Harris is awesome. Good scenery massive variety, blah blah blah\n\n250= :\n\nThe Way We Were\n\n1973 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 31 May 2015\n\nStarring: Barbra Striesand with Robert Redford, James Woods\n\nDirector: Sydney Pollack\n\nI thought it was going to be a lot worse than it was. The Oscar winning tune was overplayed, without a doubt, I can't make my mind up if I love or loathe Robert Redford and Barbra Striesand certainly is not the orthodox starlet, yet, I could not help having empathy with her part. It is tough to sit through films like this when you have the box set of House Of Cards to wade through, but it certainly wasn't a wasted evening. They could have gone further with the politics\n\n250= :\n\nWest Side Story\n\n1960 Mark: 7\n\nStarring: Natalie Wood with Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno, George Chakiris\n\nDirector: Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins\n\nThis could be the best soundtrack ever, nevertheless it is a stage show and the film comes across as such\n\n250= :\n\nWhat We Did On Our Holiday\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 1 October 2014\n\nStarring: Rosamund Pike with David Tennant, Billy Connolly, Ben Crosby, Amelia Bullmore\n\nDirector: Andy Hamilton, Guy Jenkin\n\nAs this film wore on, and as time has elapsed in the last 12 hours or so since I saw it, this kind of got quite bearable. The children manged to wear down one's resistance, the humour although hovering on the borderline of cringe managed to stay for the majority of the film as digestable, the carachters were just believable enough and although I could fully understand anybody criticising this film as being sanctimoniously twee, on a personal level I enjoyed it, and given these provisos would recommend it to a friend. Hilarious take on newspapers. Good one!\n\n250= :\n\nThe World's End\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 25 February 2014\n\nStarring: Simon Pegg with Rosamund Pike, Nick Frost, Paddy Consadine, Piers Brosnan, Bill Nighy, David Bradley\n\nDirector: Edgar Wright\n\nLike the characters in the film I had a few, resulting in a giggling empathy, and eventually a turn-off and save the rest "
