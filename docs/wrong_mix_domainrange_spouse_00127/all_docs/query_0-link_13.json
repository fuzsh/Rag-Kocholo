Just as joyously, dozens of creators largely sidelined for a year due to the pandemic got to make music again.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)LOS ANGELES – Brandi Carlile paid tribute to John Prine, Bruno Mars celebrated Little Richard and Lionel Richie honored Kenny Rogers during an in memoriam segment on Sunday night's Grammy Awards that featured an especially long list of names after a year of the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier Sunday, Prine won two posthumous Grammys for best American roots song and best American roots performance, a year after receiving a lifetime achievement award at the Grammys. Carlile told The Associated Press that it didn't bother her to be performing without an audience at the pandemic-restricted Grammys because \"this time I’m just performing for John Prine. Corea, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 79, won the trophy for best improvised jazz solo and best jazz instrumental album.\n\nBillie Eilish arrives at the 63rd annual Grammy Awards at the Los Angeles Convention Center on Sunday, March 14, 2021.

The Los Angeles Olympics were just a few months away and closing ceremony producer David L. Wolper had a problem. He would do All Night Long. And he did it almost all night long, singing for 9 minutes as athletes danced on the field and people rocked in their seats. I basically just re-enacted the entire All Night Long video and brought it to life on stage, Richie said. I was sitting in traffic and a guy four cars up was crossing the street and saw me and yelled Lionel Richie, All Night Long, All Night Long.'\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. – Country music’s biggest stars should have been on the carpet of the Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday in Las Vegas, but like most of America, they were homebound because of the coronavirus. Still, the musicians played on, surrounded by spouses, kids and — in one case — a horse. “ACM Presents: Our Country,” a TV special aired on CBS in lieu of the delayed awards show, featured acoustic performances, special duets, clips from previous ACM Awards telecasts and a tribute to the late country icon Kenny Rogers. Brad Paisley’s wife, actress Kimberly Williams-Paisley, played the role of camera operator as Paisley and Darius Rucker played together via video conference. “Lean into your guitars and your pianos and your voices and let that heal you.”___Online:ACM Awards: https://www.acmcountry.com/___Follow Kristin M.
