        "text": "Erin was born in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio and received a Waldorf grade school education, which taught her the importance of artistic expression and individual identity. At the age of seven, her family moved to Akron and she fell in love with gymnastics. For the next several years she competed as an elite level gymnast. Here she is at age 12 competing in the Junior Olympic Games on the floor and bars. You can hear her mom, Lauren and younger sister, Kelly proudly cheering her on.\n\nErin has never been one to accept limitations without a fight. In high school, in response to a dare, she competed on the boys wrestling team and won several matches at the 103 lb class, although only 98 pounds at the time. Despite her height of 5”1’ she also decided she wanted to learn to pole vault her senior year of high school. Erin became the first woman to pole vault at the state level in Ohio, placing 2nd in the state with a jump of 10’9.” The same year, she also became the first person in her school’s history to compete in the State Meet for cross country four years in a row.\n\nIn college Erin rediscovered her creative roots through the bliss of filmmaking. She met her husband Jake when he acted in her first film. The two moved to Los Angeles together upon graduating. Since that time, directing and producing has taken Erin all over the United States and across the globe. She loves meeting people and learning about different cultures.\n\nErin’s creative and athletic backgrounds converged when she discovers her love of aerial sliks, both as a performer, and also as a filmmaker. She is privileged to work with the incomparable Selkie Hom, and blend storytelling art direction with the devastating beauty of her movement. Erin and Selkie continue to create short form content together while dreaming up long-form projects for down the road.\n\nErin’s favorite thing about filmmaking is that every day is new."
