        "text": "Last week it was reported that Emmy Rossum was requesting more than equal pay to continue on “Shameless,” wanting an added bonus for all her years on the Showtime series. As for her TV dad William H. Macy’s thoughts on the matter, he told TMZ that he thinks it’s “about f*cking time” that she gets paid equally. In fact, the actor not only thinks that his TV daughter should get what she deserves but also supports equal pay for all women.\n\nRossum, who portrays Fiona Gallagher and made her directorial debut in Season 7, was adamant about getting paid more than Macy as reparation for the previous years that she was underpaid.\n\n“She works as hard as I do. She deserves everything,” he said, before jokingly adding, “The only thing I’ve got over Emmy Rossum is I’m better looking.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Shameless’ Star Emmy Rossum Requests More Than Equal Pay to Continue on Hit Series\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, if Rossum closes her deal then WBTV will renegotiate salaries with the remainder of the cast. If she can’t close a deal, “Showtime could choose to renew the show without her or cancel it.” Though Variety later reported that the studio “hasn’t even been contemplated doing the show without her.”"
