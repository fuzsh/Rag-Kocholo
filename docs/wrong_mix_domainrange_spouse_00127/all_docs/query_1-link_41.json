This pandemic has made me feel like it‚Äôs silly for me to be documenting anything that isn‚Äôt serious but I think it‚Äôs important to have this to look back on even just for myself. I hope that these little breaks can help someone out there, too.\n\nWe have 2 months left in the year!\n\nWhat are you looking forward to as we wrap up 2021?"
