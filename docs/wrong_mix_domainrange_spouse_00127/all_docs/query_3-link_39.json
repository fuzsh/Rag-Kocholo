        "text": "Not dark energy in a hocus-pocus way—rather, I mean celebrities that may appear relatively \"normal\" by most standards, but there seems to be something off about them, presumably stemming from dark shit in their past/personal/family life that has gone largely unspoken. I get this vibe from both Michelle Pfeiffer and Michelle Williams. Williams's facial expressions in particular have always resembled those of a vacant cult member who was locked in a sex dungeon for 20 years.\n\nRobin Williams was one of them... and when he lost that, started going for darker and darker roles. To many people that was the sign of him burning out.\n\nThey all develop patterns. . . because we watch them during their most functional states and the inevitable crash.\n\nEzra Miller is normal when he's self hating, but when he's not, we see a rise of disorder from him.\n\nJim Carrey is another that is more functioning when he's low than when he's high...\n\nFor Robin, it was the opposite... the more seemingly coked up he was, the more functional.\n\nSame followed with Chevy, Murray, Murphy, Pryor, etc.\n\nK. West and Kim K. Black holes.\n\nThe funny thing is that she seems actually to be just a concrete-minded, uncreative bazaar-stall seller with a knack for commerce of one kind or another. Nothing is emotional because her heart is just a cash register drawer.\n\nKanye? The darkness of ego mixed with severe psychiatric disorders and lack of education (intellectual, emotional or otherwise). His talent is misdirected and crapped on, and his lowness of mood and bad judgment smell like a bad end coming.\n\nAlso, Beyonce and her husband. As soulless and grasping as the Trumps.\n\nMichelle Williams has the same energy as Lea Michele -- given how both made someone's death they were involved or formerly involved with all about themselves... and still do.\n\nand numerous d-listers (a few a-listers and several more between) of just being attention whores that center their publicity around people in their lives and milk it out for decades to come...\n\nr33 Yeah, pretty much. Though oddly, those the most open about how sleazy they are in his personal life, such as Jim Norton, doesn't for a lot of people... even the more taboo shock humorists. Perhaps because they try to lead a double life where on stage it's anything goes or even in the media support radical positions but tend to present themselves as ultra conservative in their own lives.\n\nr48 control freak. He aimed for women he could control, when he couldn't.. he retaliated. One dumb broad gave birth to another dumb broad. . . both cut out from the family fortune when it ended. As to his many productions, a lot of their success depended more on the backstage drama than the shows themselves... which he was known for fueling, if not outright creating himself. Which, despite their success, many looked at as working on a Aaron Spelling show as the last stop before skid row.\n\nr54 given the ample rumours, more like date rape or being in the presence of. . . he wouldn't have to kill them. Most of them were already spiralling out of control with untreated mental health or addiction issues. He gets the most flak for River Phoenix because he died outside of club after Johnny claimed ownership, but there are many others that could be attributed as well. But you'd find him in the same category as a not so innocent bystander that did nothing to stop it and may have fueled the environment that led to it. Degrees of separation., He has more bodies attached to him than Hillary Clinton. . . but how connected he i sto them depends on your perspective... and it doesn't help that conspiracy nutters fuel the speculation to even more wild theories.\n\nMichelle Williams always seems depressed. If I heard in the news that she overdosed on pills tomorrow, I wouldn't be surprised at all. She doesn't have a light touch for comedy at all. It's all depressing dramas.\n\nPfeiffer on the other hand just strikes me as a very private person who can be warm when she's around those she's comfortable with and she's done quite well in comedy before and has more range than Williams. You do get the sense that she's still trying to prove that she's more than a pretty face. That's always been her biggest obstacle.\n\nMichael Jackson and family.\n\nLike the Kardashians, the creep factor was always there... just not as visible when they first came on the scene. (contrary to popular belief, the sex tape wasn't the Kardashian's first entry, it was self promotion via the athelete formerly known as Bruce. Even back then some suspected Pimp Mama K had married Jenner to break into celebrity. Which both her and previous husband got a bigger hunger for with the OJ trial)\n\nThe Jackson's creep factor became apparent when they started growing up and obviously, Michael going solo... while Michael himself - hindsight, of course, we can see all the red flags now....\n\nsimilar to say Gary Glitter.\n\n[quote] Kanye? The darkness of ego mixed with severe psychiatric disorders and lack of education (intellectual, emotional or otherwise). His talent is misdirected and crapped on, and his lowness of mood and bad judgment smell like a bad end coming.\n\nKaye West’s mother chair of the English dept at Chicago State. His father was one of the Atlanta Journal Constitution’s first black photojournalists.\n\n[quote] West was raised in a middle-class environment, attending Polaris School for Individual Education[27] in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois, after living in Chicago.[28] At the age of 10, West moved with his mother to Nanjing, China, where she was teaching at Nanjing University as a Fulbright Scholar.[29] According to his mother, West was the only foreigner in his class, but settled in well and quickly picked up the language, although he has since forgotten most of it.[30] When asked about his grades in high school, West replied, \"I got A's and B's.\"[31]\n\n[quote] After graduating from high school, West received a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes. Shortly after, he transferred to Chicago State University to study English. He soon realized that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his musical work, and at 20 he dropped out of college to pursue his musical dreams.\n\nKanye is a batshit crazy lunatic. He is not uneducated. You describe black people in ways that you would never describe whites.\n\n[quote] Will Smith knocked the shit out of Chris Rock (official thread) Worst Oscars ever. The putative best actor winner assaulting a speaker who is a COMIC doing a joke about a woman who has to be \"protected\" by her husband Astonishing. Nasty ghetto trash. And don't pretend it's not all about stereotypes. Shit.\n\nr80 untreated mental health, addiction and the subsequent lasting impact of... is a lot of what we see as \"darkness\" in celebrities.\n\nRDJ screams trauma to me and more the downward spiral of being in the public eye. Which I saw as more rebellious, stunted, in that way of \"oh you think I'm fucked up? Let me show you how fucked up I can truly be\" - I'm inclined to think his character in The Wonder Boys or Home For The Holidays isn't that far off from him. Albeit, both characters were more gay than not. . . and we can dissect those rumours to death on whether or not he's bisexual. But he's very much the stereotype non effeminate version of the gay str8 man. We'd likely have him quoted under the judgmental shop bottom thread. We saw a similar aspect with Tim Curry.\n\n- I imagine a naked, tearful Renee Zellwegger staring into a floor-to-ceiling length mirror each day. She tugs on an imaginary piece of fat on her flat, skeletal abdomen as she resists the urge to drink her sixteenth mug of coffee. She can't resist, however, and as she sits in front of her latest shit script, hands shaking, she knows she'll have to do it all again tomorrow.\n\n- Matthew Perry lives in a perpetual blackout state. Overeating, over-drinking, over-drugging, over-purging ... just overdoing everything because of his addictive personality. Due to a twist of fate, he'll never have to work again. The Friends residuals will keep him deep in whatever his favorite drug/escape into infinity and beyond.\n\nR80, I agree. And I also find him fascinating.\n\nI think his issues stem from the fact that his father refused to leave him alone while making it plain he didn't much care about him.\n\nMost abusive/neglectful parents choose one or the other.\n\nPlus there's his time in jail and rumored assault while incarcerated.\n\nThe fact that he's never blamed other people for his behavior makes me respect him. No televised court drama for him.\n\nR160 I still remember Elizabeth Moss's remarks about Fred Armiesen after they divorced. She sounded horrified to even hear his name mentioned and said something about him being completely abnormal. I thought it was an unusual reaction by celeb standards. While occasionally you'll see Johnny and Amber melodramas, usually actors or actresses will manage to fake pleasantries about their ex , ie \" While we are no longer married we are still amicable and I wish him well in his future endeavors\" etc.\n\nOP, check out the posts from \"chumashj...@gmail.com\" on this google chat page about the suicide of hunky 80's-90's actor Ron Marquette.\n\nThey're kind of rambling, but it looks like she's strongly implying that Michelle Pfieffer's sister Dedee killed Marquette, then arranged w/police help to have it declared a suicide.\n\n\"...I did everything to believe it was suicide but the more I saw and read the more I wished it was suicide ....folks it's simple I can prove it just tell dede to talk to me for five minutes and this matter will be cleared up once and for all and trust me I'll give nothing but respect but she knows I know and she probably thought I died or was out of her hair ....but sweetheart I'm just getting started over 20 years I've been silent I think the truth about my best friend deserves to be told that why dede called me and only me saying she was sorry my reply was dede what did you do her reply I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm so sorry then she hung up !!!!\"\n\nJohn Cusack is apparently the celebrity that most creeped Danny Trejo out. I never got that vibe from him myself, but I’m going to trust the insticts of the guy who’s actually worked with him, been around hardened drug dealers since he himself became one at age 7, and did time in San Quentin.\n\n[quote] Aw, I like Willem. He was very nice and cool in person, same way as he comes off in interviews. He just has an uh, striking face.\n\nYeah, I know he can look creepy as hell when he has intense expressions, but everything I’ve ever read from people who worked with him depicts him as a sweetheart and consummate professional. Like Steve Buscemi, that’s one book you can’t judge by his cover.\n\n[quote] I still remember Elizabeth Moss’s remarks about Fred Armiesen after they divorced. She sounded horrified to even hear his name mentioned and said something about him being completely abnormal.\n\nI’m sure someone raised in a racketeering cult that worships celebrities and tried to infiltrate the US government is a really good judge of what is and isn’t normal.\n\nRDJ owns this thread. He always comes across to me as extremely arrogant, extremely damaged, extremely fucked up, intensely self-focused, and someone so internally breathtakingly angry they could turn on a dime. Not an attractive individual on any level. I suspect he knows and fears the fact that he's not an especially good actor, just an emotive one who can pour out the energy of irritation and annoyance onto the screen. I believe he harnesses his suppressed anger for his roles, but one pities his psychiatrist. My summary take: just a sour depressive very very angry turd who barely has it under control.\n\n[Quote] for what it's worth, I know someone who has worked The Weekend and he said that he is an asshole and very rude. I'm not surprised.\n\nIt's not like he hides how fucked up he is if you pay attention to the lyrics. Unlike say Selena Gomez or Ariana Grande.\n\n[Quote] Alyson Hannigan & Seth Green. I know there's a lot of people that feel they fit this category especially given how both tend to stay out of controversies involving former castmates on Buffy and other shows.\n\nWell Alyson did make an ass of herself by being \"shocked\" at SMG wanting Buffy to end after 7 seasons. And she's also rumoured to be one of Joss Whedon's flings. I think it's safe to say he has some dark energy.\n\nJon Hamm.\n\nHe was the ringleader of the fraternity hazing that involved setting the guy's pants on fire, leading him around with the claw of a hammer beneath his genitals and beating him so hard he was left with a fractured spine and almost lost a kidney. He was arrested for his involvement. When Jon was asked about what happened he glibly said \"it was a a bummer\". These actions are not the stupidity of youth, these actions speak to major character flaws.\n\nI think what is known about his drinking problem is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI'm going to throw in Heath Ledger here. Popular, nice-looking, lucky with the ladies, a wonderful actor. But he had demons. His separation from Michelle Williams & his daughter, among other things, led him to insomnia and a constant barrage of sleeping aids, some drugs and anti-anxiety experiences. So much so that it led to his death. According to reports - and who really knows - it was said Michelle was tired of his drug taking around their daughter. Weed was a common drug but I don't know if he was really into harder stuff. I don't think he adjusted quite yet to his celebrity; I think he thought of himself as just a regular guy and what was it about all of this fame that people were talking about. He never seemed comfortable at red carpet events. I miss his talent.\n\n[quote]Jerry Seinfeld. Wolf in sheep's clothing. Dating a teenager at the height of Seinfeld (TV show). Poaches a newlywed woman off of an average Joe.\n\nHuh? Jerry’s fug dull wife was married to a NYC multi-millionaire whose family owned a lot of real estate and theaters, her ex-husband was hardly “an average Joe”. After she was married to this man, [bold]she [/bold]pursued Jerry at a gym.\n\nThat ugly plain woman clearly wanted a billionaire. WTF does she bring to the table, she copies others recipe books?\n\nJerry is an asshole. Straight men are incredibly stupid, especially rich straight men they seem to welcome golddiggers. Jerry could have had his pick, he chose [bold]her?! [/bold] Maybe she blows him like a Hoover?\n\nAt least, Shoshanna was very attractive and seemed cool. Never heard anything bad about her.\n\nThis is an interesting thread. Actors play character that audiences are drawn to. Ultimately, the actors are nothing like those characters.\n\nAt least the good ones.\n\nAnd when a fan meets an actor, they're longing for that actor to be someone kind, someone special, someone...nice. But in reality the actor has a dark ugly past.\n\nSad\n\nI like Stephen Fry but he has a somewhat dark energy about him.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio over the past 10-15 years has a dark, closer energy in contrast to when he was younger.\n\nAlso don’t like to say it, as he’s so loved over here, but David Jason, British actor from Only Fools and Horses has a dark vibe too.\n\nALL those phony preachers begging people for money are evil and dark.\n\nThese preachers are nothing more than grifters under the guise of 'holy' men and women.\n\nt's pathetic that so many people are so fucking ignorant, they actually think by sending these bastard preachers money for \"miracle water\" and other such crap, they will magically get a huge wad of money or the high paying job of their dreams. These are the same assholes who continue to believe Drumpf's lies.\n\nDefinitely Jimmy Page. Very odd man. He's also a control freak.\n\nPage has been accused of being a Satanist, a secret leader of the OTO, who knows. Page has admitted he was interested in Aleister Crowley since he was a teen. When he became wealthy, he tracked down limited edition Crowley books as well as purchasing Crowley's Scottish home Boleskine House. However, Page spent less than a month in that home, it was always under some sort of construction. Page asked a friend to live there, the friend and his family spent more time there than Page ever did. Boleskine House was sold many years ago.\n\nOn the other hand, Page seems decent when it comes to certain responsibilities. Page still supports all his adult children.\n\nJimmy with one of his daughters.\n\n[quote]I always thought Armie Hammer exuded evil from his pores even before Cannibalgate.\n\nMe too!! After watching CMBYN (the first Armie movie I ever saw) I actually posted online asking if Oliver was a psychopath because he gave me psychopathic vibes in that movie! I couldn't understand what Elio saw in him. Turns out I was seeing Armie's true self even through his so-called acting.\n\nHammer and Cavill always struck me as white-bread lifeless blanks onscreen, I was astonished that Hammer turned out to have hidden evil depths! Who knew! Maybe 366 did, but I didn't!\n\nI have no idea why some people's inner selves register on screen and others' don't, but in Hammer's case maybe the blankness was because the last thing he wanted was for the camera to see inside.\n\nR375 There is a big difference between psychopaths and borderlines. Borderlines and narcissists are emotional vampires, especially borderlines. Psychopaths are not generally emotional vampires. They are con artists without a conscience but they usually mainly want to take your money. If they manage to rob you by deception and know they have gotten all they can they don't tend to stick around, they move on to the next mark. Borderlines are the \"I hate you don't leave me\" horrible vampires and narcissists are extremely vengeful.\n\nmany comedians do, of course. Many actors pretend to be dark and deep but really are laughably pathetic. I love how Johnny Depp thought he was so artsy and deep in his ridiculous texts. Fame and idolatry end up making some of these people think they are brilliant. As far as dark, that could fit Depp. Dark bc he is an addict. So, any addicts tend to be darker. Joaquin Phoenix, definitely. He was in a cult as a child after all. Crispin Glover, yes, perhaps. Michelle Williams is very regular and not at all dark energy. Many actors are just boring without someone feeding them lines or making them interesting, but occasionally one comes along with a certain something. Kevin Spacey is dark. And this question is dumb\n\nR352, I was googling 'snuck' when a p.a. (who I hope got a raise for getting that dictionary out so quickly) produced the proof Conan needed.\n\nI've always found Jen Garner to be a 'deese dem and dose' type person in terms of HER education. That quirkiness is an act.\n\nNot a big of Conan's -- terrible interviewer, whined when he got Tonight Show taken away from him; he wasn't good! and then he goes and bumps George Lopez's talk show off the air.\n\nBut good for him.\n\nR436 Leo used to be charismatic and even somewhat warm in interviews and arguably a little camp, too. That changed about a decade or so ago. You can see it in most pictures of him now. It’s like something died inside of him and he wears a mask. I don’t know it’s a dark energy, but a deadened one. I don’t know what happened to him but it’s sad.\n\nIt's really fucking stupid that someone must look an an interior actress like Kristen Stewart and say she's lifeless. No it's just how some people are. It's in the eyes or you have to look closer. With -all- the crazy acclaim she's gotten youd think that maybe they'd think they were missing something or that the actresses behavior is just closer to the vest. Though she did do batshit Tammy Faye type things with that Diana.\n\n[quote]All of Led Zeppelin\n\nNot true. Never heard any weird shit about bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, except he cheated on his wife while on the road. Then again, most rockers cheated on their wives and long term GFs during the years Led Zeppelin were popular.\n\nMost musicians and celebrities cheat on their wives and partners. If that's the worst they do, well.....\n\nR436, I know about Bob Villard. Just because Leo worked with a pedo doesn't mean he was abused by him. He had very protective parents.\n\nAnd he certainly wasn't sexually abused by Villard, or anyone else, at some point after 2006 when he was a grown-ass man and one of the most powerful people in Hollywood.\n\nThere WAS a noticeable change in Leo's demeanor after Titanic. I agree he could still be charming, but he didn't seem like the same guy to me. I think it was probably him trying to come across more masc.\n\nI agree that there was another change that happened at some point in the late 2000s. Now he's like a freaking robot. I can barely listen to/watch him anymore.\n\nWhen I first noticed it, I wondered if he was on strong psych meds that changed his speech patterns/movements. But I don't think that's it. It seems deliberate to me. He's very \"on\", and every gesture, every word seems rehearsed.\n\nThis press conference about Django Unchained is interesting. When answering a question, Leo already has that slow way of speaking, flat intonation and overall pretty serious demeanor. I'd say it's not as bad as what I've seen from him post-2015, but he already comes across as boring and overly controlled. However, at around 0:30 you can see him make eye contact with Don Johnson and throw him a mischievous grin, and there are a few other moments where he seems genuinely amused by something one of the others said.\n\nLike I said, that flat affect in interviews is put on, for whatever reason.\n\nR453 This photo was taken by Villard. Christopher Pettiet (on the left) died of a drug overdose in 2000 at the age of 24. It’s been confirmed Villard sexually abused Pettiet and there’s a creepy letter he wrote about Pettiet after his death in which he mentions managing all three of them. You guys are going on about how dark Leo is and yet are adamant that he wasn’t a victim of sexual exploitation or abuse when he was literally surrounded by pedophiles as a minor.\n\nR454, You didn't answer my question. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT LEO WAS ALONE WITH VILLARD? How you do know one of his parents didn't accompany him to that photoshoot, or all the other photoshoots with Villard?\n\nLook, I'm not saying Leo was never abused, be it by Villard or someone else. It very well might have happened. What I'm saying is, 1.) it's not proven and people shouldn't jump to conclusions and 2.) imo possible childhood sexual abuse he might have suffered doesn't explain the \"dark\" vibe I get from him. As I said, in his early days he seemed like a fairly normal, well-adjusted, fun-loving guy to me. If he was a victim of abuse, he hid it well. That \"darkness\" I see in him came much later, when he was a grown man in a very powerful position.\n\n[Quote] Bill Hader I really like but he has a dark depressive side along with the light one, I'd seen glimpses even before Barry.\n\nBill dating Rachel Bilson was so random.\n\n[Quote] It’s the same thing with Beyoncé. She used to be more open and show more personality early in her career, and now she gives us nothing.\n\nBitchy Beyonce was fun.\n\nTommy Lee Jones (who I find fascinating) pretends to an incomprehension of even the simplest question in interviews and seems profoundly insulted that he has to endure them. His irascibility is legend. I wish I knew what happened to him! Or maybe I don’t, since he was intelligent enough to get a scholarship to Harvard and yet plays these games with people luckless enough to have been assigned to sit down with him to do what all participants fully realize it is PART OF HIS EXTREMELY WELL-PAYING JOB TO DO.\n\nNot really \"dark\" energy, but I feel like Taylor Swift is a much bigger bitch than she pretends to be in public. Her strong reaction to jokes made about her dating life is so ridiculous and disproportionate to the \"offense\". Remember when Tina Fey and Amy Poehler made fun of her at the Golden Globes? Her response to that was to tweet a Madeline Albright quote \" there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women.’ I'm pretty sure Albright was referring to more serious things than Taylor's love life but hey, what do I know?\n\nSacha Baron Cohen came up on another thread, and he creeps the fuck out of me! Very chilly, closed, screen presence, at best, but when he gets to make his own \"humor\" films almost all the humor is cruel. He wants other people to reveal themselves and open themselves to public humiliation, while he enjoys the downfall of others and reveals nothing of his real self. I really suspect him of being a sociopath.\n\nNot that his creepy ass isn't right for some roles. When \"Les Miz\" came out, some people criticized his performance, saying he didn't get the maximum amount of fun out of the role. Which is true, in a lot of stage productions \"Master of the House\" is the big bouncy fun number and is played for laughs, but that can be a problem. When the character re-appears later on, it's best for the show as a whole if the audience doesn't see him and think \"Hey's it's the fun guy\", for the drama to have the most impact they should think \"Oh no, it's the horrible guy who enslaves and sells children!\". And Cohen was the horrible guy who sells children.\n\n[quote]Prince had a dark energy.\n\nI think Xennial was just correcting their previous post, but agree that their was a darkness to Prince. He liked to write using the good vs. evil theme, but I suspect he was living it as well. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether someone is an asshole playing the role of a kind person, or a kind person playing the role of an asshole.\n\n[quote]Sinead O'Connor said Prince threatened to beat the shit out of her. I believe her.\n\nShe also said he put heavy things into a pillowcase and started hitting her with it, and that she looked at his eyes and his irises disappeared, followed by him chasing her around the neighborhood in his car after she escaped. I think something went down, but I think her memory of it sounds a bit fantastical.\n\nRiz Ahmed.\n\nThis man is a compulsive liar, is super creepy, uses anyone and everyone. Including his wife, a woman he barely knew before marrying her, he thought she'd help his image. Lies about being working class. e\n\nRiz is a possible sexual assaulter. Previous to his Oscar nomination for the Sound of Metal film, his powerful team supposedly managed to bury all the sexual assault allegations. On the other hand, he's been abandoned by a lot of his high profile showbiz and creative field friends, in both Europe and the US.\n\nBasically, he's a very weird manipulative evil man. He's such a good actor, few of his fans see through his fake calculated image.\n\nThere’s something I can’t put my finger on about Fred Armisen. He’s funny and I love him in Portlandia, but his eyes have some kind of darkness to them. Maybe that’s why Elisabeth Moss described her short marriage to him as traumatic, awful, and horrible. He seems like a person who will gather info about you in the early stages of a relationship only to use it against you later in the meanest take down possible without batting an eye or feeing a hint of remorse later.\n\nNevertheless, R522, she projects dark energy on the screen, and given her background I can see why she'd have that aura.\n\nHaving a dark side doesn't make a person evil or horrible, a person can decide to live ethically even if they've been through living nightmares, or carry darkness inside. A person can be very aware of all the evil and horror in the world, and decide not to be evil and horrible themselves."
