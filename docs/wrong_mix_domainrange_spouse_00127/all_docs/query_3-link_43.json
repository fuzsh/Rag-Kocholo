My original review can be found here . The Inbetweeners 2 (UK, 2014) Directed by Damon Beesley & Iain Morris Starring Simon Bird, James Buckley, Blake Harrison, Joe Thomas I've spoken on many occasions about how screenwriters or novelists don't always make the best directors. As much as we bemoan a director's vision for a given film not gelling with that of the writer, when writers get behind a camera they often fail to grasp the difference between cinematic and literary storytelling. This is true of the cult classic Westworld , the would-be cult classic Sir Henry at Rawlinson End , and the coming-of-age drama The Perks of Being A Wallflower . The Inbetweeners 2 sees Damon Beesley and Iain Morris, the creators of the TV series, stepping behind the camera for a film which bids farewell to the famous foursome. Just as the first\n\nGREAT FILMS: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009)\n\nCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (USA, 2009) Directed by Phil Lord & Christopher Miller Starring Bill Hader, Anna Faris, James Caan, Andy Samberg When a given genre or medium becomes dominated by two major players with opposing approaches, it can be very difficult for a new, alternative talent to muscle in and take some of the glory. Film fans can be a tribal and contradictory bunch: we demand the moon on a stick in terms of innovation, and yet complain when a given director or studio doesn’t meet their usual standards (i.e. producing the same thing over and over again). The increasing conservatism of Hollywood compounds this problem; there’s no shortage of formulaic work out there, and truly novel films struggle to fight for their share of the oxygen of publicity. Since the late-1990s, mainstream animation in the west has been divided into two camps: PIXAR, which believes in making films which all the family can enjoy on the same level, and Dreamworks, whose film\n\nREVIEW REVISITED: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)\n\nThis is a reprint of my review which was published on this blog in December 2014, with a number of minor revisions. That version of the review can be found here . The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (New Zealand/ USA, 2012) Directed by Peter Jackson Starring Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Cate Blanchett The Lord of the Rings trilogy is such a milestone in fantasy filmmaking that any attempt to re-approach the Tolkien universe was bound to generate anxiety. As more stories about The Hobbit 's production came to light, it seemed increasingly unlikely that the end result could ever come close to matching Peter Jackson's original trilogy. An Unexpected Journey is very much a flawed first part, but it is still enjoyable and balances out its flaws with enough nice touches to justify some of its running time. In returning to Middle Earth, we have to deal with two diametrically opposed feelings. The first is nostalgia for The Lord of the Rin\n\nREVIEW REVISITED: National Lampoon's Animal House (1978)\n\nThis is a reprint of my review which was published on this blog 2 years ago, with a number of minor revisions. That version of the review can be found here . National Lampoon's Animal House (USA, 1978) Directed by John Landis Starring Jon Belushi, Tim Matheson, Peter Riefert, Karen Allen When I reviewed Basic Instinct three years ago, I talked about the reputation of erotic thrillers, commenting that they are \"often lumped together with horror movies as the stuff that 'sensible', 'reasonable' citizens wouldn't touch with a twenty-foot pole.\" You could add gross-out comedies to this list of untouchable genres, and you might have a case given the quality of Superbad and its recent counterparts. But just as dismissing all erotic thrillers would prevent us from having fun with Paul Verhoeven, so to dismiss gross-outs outright would lead us to overlook the qualities of the film which created that genre. National Lampoon's Animal H\n\nREVIEW REVISITED: Flash Gordon (1980)\n\nThis is a reprint of my review which was first published on Three Men on a Blog last year, with a number of minor revisions. My original review can be found here . Also be sure to check out the Movie Hour podcast on the film from November 2010 here . Flash Gordon (UK, 1980) Directed by Mike Hodges Starring Sam J. Jones, Melody Anderson, Max von Sydow, Brian Blessed It's often the case that films we loved in our childhood don't hold up half as well when viewed again as an adult. Likewise it's very common to rediscover a film we hated in our teenage years, only to find that we were completely wrong and that said pariah is actually a masterpiece. Flash Gordon is a more complicated example of this prolonged change of heart. As a boy under the age of 10, you can't believe your luck - bright colours, big action sequences, scary villains and a chisel-jawed hero. As a teenager who desperately wants to be cool, it's deeply embarrassing - dodgy special\n\nREVIEW REVISITED: The Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists! (2012)\n\nThis is a reprint of my review which was first published on this blog in May 2012, with a number of minor revisions. My original review can be found here . The Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists! (UK, 2012) Directed by Peter Lord Starring Hugh Grant, Martin Freeman, David Tennant, Imelda Staunton Film critics often get it in the neck for overanalysing or expecting too much from films which, for some people, are only designed to entertain. While expecting nothing other than fun from the movies will prevent one from properly exploring all that the medium has to offer, it is also true that reviewers have to keep their feet on the ground. Every so often we have to defend a film mainly because we enjoyed ourselves - and, ironically, the simplest pleasures are often the hardest to explain. The Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists! is a good example of this phenomenon. On the surface there is nothing especially remarkable about it, either in the quality of the a\n\nKIDS' STUFF: Mulan (1998)\n\nMulan (USA, 1998) Directed by Tony Bancroft & Barry Cook Starring Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, BD Wong, Miguel Ferrer In my review of Tarzan , I spoke about how the established conventions of the Disney Renaissance were increasingly applied to stories which could not be adequately served by them. In the case of Tarzan , the film-makers took Edgar Rice Burroughs' iconic, pulpy story, which played with ideas about human culture and the 'missing link', and turned it into a pretty but generic story with too many sidekicks and an unconvincing villain. Mulan comes from the same, late period of the Renaissance, but fares slightly better in its execution. It goes against Disney's generic strengths in many aspects, exploring a real historical figure rather than the heroes and villains of European folk tales, and in exploring this subject, it clearly doesn't go far enough in its ideas or characterisations. But it is one of the more interesting Disney fi\n\nREVIEW REVISITED: Wild at Heart (1990)\n\nThis is a reprint of my review which was first published on Three Men on a Blog in December 2011, with a number of minor revisions. My original review can be found here . Wild at Heart (USA, 1990) Directed by David Lynch Starring Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern, Diane Ladd, Willem Dafoe You know you've arrived as a filmmaker when a bespoke adjective is created to describe your work - Gilliam-esque, Kubrickian, Lynchian and so on. But with this honour comes the danger of said film-maker producing films which consist of familiar images or elements, without the narrative or thematic cohesion which earned them the label in the first place. Wild of Heart is only partially guilty of this, not being one of David Lynch's strongest or most cohesive efforts. Although its thematic unity is never in doubt, and its central narrative is easy enough to follow, it ultimately amounts to a series of strange and memorable moments which punctuate his loose reworking of a road movi\n\nREVIEW REVISITED: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010)\n\nThis is a reprint of my review which was published on this blog last June, with a number of minor revisions. That version of the review can be found here . Also be sure to check out the Movie Hour podcast on the film from November 2011 here . Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (USA, 2010) Directed by Edgar Wright Starring Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Kieran Culkin, Brandon Routh When I reviewed Gregory's Girl , I argued that coming-of-age movies are both thin on substance and have a limited lifespan. Films as varied as American Graffiti and Dirty Dancing revolve around the same old stories of young love and heartbreak; the ones that last are not just those that evoke their period, but which contain some kind of deeper truth about the process of growing up. Being a young man still somewhat within the coming-of-age bracket, it is hard for me to say how good Scott Pilgrim vs. the World will look in ten years' time, when the gaming world has moved on"
