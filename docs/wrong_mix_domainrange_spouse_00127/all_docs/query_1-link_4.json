        "text": "Entertainment One Films U.S. has acquired the North American distribution rights to indie drama “You’re Not You,” starring Hilary Swank, Emmy Rossum and Josh Duhamel.\n\nThe film will be released theatrically later this year.\n\n“You’re Not You” is produced by DPP in association with Di Novi Pictures (Alison Greenspan) and 2S Films (Molly Smith and Swank).\n\nCast also includes Loretta Devine, Ernie Hudson, Frances Fisher, Marcia Gay Harden, Ali Larter, Jason Ritter, Julian McMahon and Andrea Savage.\n\nGeorge C. Wolfe directed from a screenplay by Jordan Roberts and Shana Feste. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Michelle Wildgen.\n\nSwank portrays a woman who has been immobilized by ALS, and Rossum plays an aimless and self-absorbed college student hired to be her caregiver in spite of her husband’s objections.\n\nThe deal was negotiated for eOne Films by Sejin Croninger and for the filmmakers by CAA. Myriad Pictures is handling international sales and introduced the film to buyers at Berlin."
