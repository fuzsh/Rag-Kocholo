        "text": "The series gained critical acclaim winning a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award. The show earned the most nominations of any international television series in the history of the Primetime Emmy Awards, with twenty-seven in total. With fans all over the world, Downton Abbey has gone down in history as one of the most popular TV shows ever.\n\nHugh Bonneville earned a Golden Globe nomination and won two consecutive Emmy Awards for his performance in the series. Since Downton Abbey came to an end, Bonneville has played Mr. Brown in the 2014 film, Paddington, and its 2017 sequel, Paddington 2. He has appeared in the role of The Pirate King in the ABC fairytale-themed musical comedy extravaganza series, Galavant, during its 2015 and 2016 seasons. He was also the narrator of the ITV series The Cruise. In 2019, Bonneville was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant of West Sussex.\n\nApart from her role as Lady Sybil in Downton Abbey, Jessica Brown Findlay is best known for her work in 2011’s Albatross, 2014’s Winter’s Tale, and the British series, Harlots, from 2017 to 2019. In May 2015, she made her professional theatre debut at the Almeida Theatre, London, as Electra in a new adaptation of The Oresteia. In September 2020, she got married to Ziggy Heath after dating for more than four years.\n\nMichelle Dockery was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for her incredible performance as Lady Mary Talbot on Downton Abbey. After the series, she starred in the Netflix miniseries, Godless, for which she received her fourth Emmy nomination, the Netflix series, Anatomy of A Scandal, and the AppleTV+ miniseries, Defending Jacob. In February 2022, it was announced that Dockery and her Downton Abbey costar, Michael C. Fox, have signed a record deal with Decca Records as the duo Michelle and Michael. Early this year, in January, Dockery got engaged to long-time boyfriend Jasper Waller-Bridge.\n\nJoanne Froggatt has won a Golden Globe Award and three Emmy nominations for her portrayal of Anna Bates on Downton Abbey. After the show ended, she went on to star in the ITV drama series Liar. Froggatt also made her stage debut in 2019 as Frances Thorpe in the thriller Alys, Always, at the Bridge Theatre in London. In 2020, she announced that she has separated from her husband of eight years, James Cannon.\n\nAfter Downton Abbey, life has been happening for Rose Leslie. She starred in the HBO fantasy series, Game of Thrones, as Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow played by Kit Harington. The pair started dating while starring in the series and got married in 2018. In 2021, they welcomed their baby boy. She has also acted in a handful of movies and is now starring in the HBO sci-fi romantic drama, The Time Traveller's Wife.\n\nAside from being a part of the film adaptations of the series, Lesley Nicole has given voice to the character of Winsome Witch in the HBO animated series Jellystone! The three-time SAG Award winner has also made several guest appearances on several American TV shows — including The CW’s Supernatural and CBS’ The Odd Couple. She has also created a musical about her life with the help of songwriter, Mark Mueller.\n\nProbably the most famous person from the cast of Downton Abbey, we all know Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall from the Harry Potter films. In April 2016, she was awarded the Bodley Medal by the University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries in recognition of her outstanding contribution to the performing arts. In 2018, Smith starred in a British documentary titled Nothing Like a Dame, directed by Roger Michell, which documents conversations between actresses Smith, Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, and Joan Plowright.\n\nIn April 2019, after an eleven-year absence from theatre, Smith returned to the stage in Christopher Hampton's play, A German Life, as Brunhilde Pomsel at the Bridge Theatre in London. The film was released in the United States as Tea with Dames. In November 2020, Smith joined Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi, and Ian McKellen for a conversation on Zoom entitled For One Knight Only, for the charity \"Acting for Others.\"\n\nAfter leaving the sets of Downton Abbey in 2012, Dan Stevens has starred in the 2014 thriller films The Guest and Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb. He also starred as The Beast/Prince in Disney's 2017 live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, Lorin Willis in the 2017 biographical legal drama Marshall, Charles Dickens in the 2017 biographical drama The Man Who Invented Christmas, and Russian Eurovision singer Alexander Lemtov in Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga in 2020. From 2017 to 2019, he starred in the FX series Legion. In 2018, he starred in the Netflix horror-thriller Apostle.\n\nWith an extensive career on stage and screen way before Downton Abbey, Penelope Wilton starred in the British comedy-drama series After Life and Brief Encounters after the series ended. She has also been active on stage post the show. Wilton was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2004 New Year Honours and was elevated to become a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours, both for services to drama.\n\nFollowing her role in Downton Abbey, Lily James went on to make her film breakthrough with the title role in the 2015 movie Cinderella. James went on to portray Countess Natasha Rostova in the television adaptation of War & Peace (2016) and Pamela Anderson in the biographical series Pam & Tommy (2022).\n\nShe has had starring roles in several films, including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Baby Driver, Darkest Hour, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, and the musical Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, Yesterday, Rebecca and The Dig.\n\nIn October 2020, she made headlines after she was caught canoodling with married Pursuit of Love costar Dominic West in Rome. The PDA-filled pics surfaced shortly after James was linked to Chris Evans following her split from The Crown’s Matt Smith. Following the scandal with West, she was spotted kissing musician Michael Schuman in February 2021."
