        "text": "Netflix\n\n9900 Wilshire Boulevard\n\nNetflix’s shindig saw more rose champagne streaming than the company’s original content, and for good reason. They dominated the Globes with three wins on the TV side and two on film.\n\nTo toast big winners like Michael Douglas and creator Chuck Lorre of “The Kominsky Method,” director Alfonso Cuaron of “Roma” and the surprise win of Richard Madden for his sleeper hit “Bodyguard,” Netflix did not skimp on an exclusive and standalone buildout — just a few steps across from the driveway of the Beverly Hilton on the old Robinsons-May lot.\n\nServers in crushed velvet blazers, hunter green with bedazzled piping, slung classic cocktails like Negroni and pressed-juice gimlets while waiters circulated with apps — including vegan options, like faux-chicken bites on warm pita and crunchy veggie tacos.\n\nKate Beckinsale made new friends in rapper Machine Gun Kelly and “SNL” star Pete Davidson, huddled close on an outdoor patio with drinks for most of the evening — but not before Davidson put in some face time with boss Lorne Michaels.\n\nPlenty of people schmoozed with top Netflix boss Ted Sarandos, including “At Eternity’s Gate” director Julian Schnabel and actor Willem Dafoe, and Joe Alwyn and girlfriend Taylor Swift (whose “Reputation” concert special is airing exclusively on the service).\n\nMilk Bar cookies and a mobile makeup station added nice touches to the space, but were mere distractions from the serious dance party going down. Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher broke it down to Lil Jon’s “Get Low,” while the likes of Idris Elba, director Jon Chu, Molly Sims and Scott Stuber, Zoey Deutch, Danielle Macdonald and Jamie Foxx looked on in awe. — Matt Donnelly\n\nFox/Hulu\n\nThe Fox Terrace, Rooftop\n\nThe Golden Globes may be all about film and television, but it was music that stole the show at the joint Fox and Hulu post-awards ceremony celebration.\n\nJust hours after Taylor Swift sent “The Handmaid’s Tale” star Elisabeth Moss a message thanking her for listening to her music on-set and saying she’d love to meet her someday, the singer popped by the party that was also honoring her boyfriend Joe Alwyn‘s film “The Favourite.”\n\nSwift chatted with Olympian Missy Franklin and, according to a source, told her that when she was younger she wanted to be an Olympian. Meanwhile, Alwyn stuck close by his costars at the event, including Olivia Colman, who kept her Golden Globe close, and Nicholas Hoult.\n\nSwift drew a lot of attention, but so did drama film winner “Bohemian Rhapsody.” The team behind the film, led by star and film drama actor winner Rami Malek held court in a corner of the party with Queen singer Brian May. At one point a semi-circle four people deep formed around the group as attendees snapped photos.\n\nQueen’s music also proved to be a big hit when DJ Alex Merrell spun one of their tunes. The dance floor was a hot spot well into the night, with “Pose” stars Indya Moore and Dominique Jackson strutting their stuff. Their first season FX drama didn’t win Sunday, but the Globes was just the start of their awards season, and they were in good spirits, with Jackson continuing to dance as she made her way out of the party.\n\nCocktails were flowing, even if they weren’t themed to nominated projects such as “Can You Ever Forgive Me?,” “Isle of Dogs,” or “Atlanta” (although those who were drinking vodka were still on-brand for television drama winner “The Americans”). Guests could also enjoy an outdoor coffee and hot chocolate bar as they mingled and munched on crab cakes.\n\nNew Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier made a brief appearance before having to hop a flight, while co-chairman and CEO Dana Walden and exiting co-chairman and CEO Gary Newman stayed well into the night, chatting outside under heat lamps as rain began to fall. “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” star and limited series/tv movie actor winner Darren Criss caught up with “Insatiable” star Debby Ryan. The two drew a lot of attention on social media last fall as they traveled to the iHeartRadio Festival together, and they spent awhile chatting in front of cameras again here, with Ryan holding Criss’ trophy.\n\nContinuing “Versace” executive producer Brad Simpson’s award acceptance speech message about representation, executive producer Nina Jacobson confirmed to Variety that she is involved in the Women in LA and Women and Hollywood initiative #RememberTheLadies. “We just need more f—ing women nominated,” she said.\n\nWhile “Versace” is up for a couple of upcoming SAG Awards, Jacobson admitted she is more focused on newer properties at the moment. “I’m really hoping ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ sees nominations at the Oscars,'” she said of the movie she produced. “And then hopefully seeing a second wave for ‘Pose’ with people who may be just discovering it now for the first time.’ It’s been great to see Billy get recognition, but all of the women are just so fantastic, too. I really have a soft spot for MJ [Rodriguez]. I just think everything she does is magic.”\n\n—Danielle Turchiano\n\nNBCUniversal Golden Globes After Party\n\nJean-Georges Restaurant, Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills\n\n“Andy KILLED IT!” exclaimed Terry Crews, who was proud of his “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” co-star Andy Samberg’s hosting gig on Sunday night. “Those jobs are not easy!”\n\nCrews wasn’t the only one giving high marks to Samberg and Oh at the NBCUniversal party, held right after the Globes telecast. “I thought they did an incredible job,” NBC Entertainment co-chairman George Cheeks told Variety. “They were funny and charming, and I thought the opening was hilarious. They were great all the way around. And I loved the poignant moment at the end with Sandra as well.”\n\nThe always friendly and energetic Crews had reason to be in high spirits: He hosts NBC’s “America’s Got Talent: The Champions,” which premieres Monday, while “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” returns this Thursday on its new Peacock network home. “I’m having the week of my career,” he said.\n\nThe overall mood was celebratory inside the Jean-Georges Restaurant, particularly as “Green Book” director Peter Farrelly walked in with his family — and two new Globes, for best motion picture (musical or comedy) and best screenplay. “I’m so excited for what it means for the movie,” said Farrelly. The filmmaker’s kids, who wound up on the Globes stage with the film’s cast and crew, admitted they were “terrified” by the moment. “We were pulled up in a rush,” said Farrelly’s daughter Apple.\n\nAs the DJ spun classic ’80s pop and hip-hop tunes, partygoers dined on Jean-Georges cuisine rigatoni with veal meatballs and smoky tomato ragu, wood-roasted beef tenderloin, and the restaurant’s signature citrus salad. Then there was the sushi buffet: Celebrities spotted dining on spicy tuna and the like included Adam Driver and wife Joanne Tucker.\n\nElsewhere, “Saturday Night Live” executive producer Lorne Michaels held court in one booth while nursing a pink-colored beverage, while Spike Lee stopped by to say hello to Charlize Theron as Jamie Foxx milled about. Lee and Bill Murray (still holding the champagne chalice he brought on stage) were spotted chatting, and others who dropped by the party included Octavia Spencer, Linda Cardellini, Sterling K. Brown, Ryan Michelle Bathe, Justin Hartley, Jason Blum, and “BlacKkKlansman” star John David Washington chatting up Universal Pictures chairman Donna Langley. —Mike Schneider\n\nHBO\n\nCirca 55, Beverly Hilton\n\nHBO chief Richard Plepler was in possession of the best cocktail party gossip of all on Sunday night at the cabler’s post-Globes bash — a few details on the final season of “Game of Thrones.” Read about his comments on the highly anticipated six episodes here.\n\nHBO didn’t have its biggest night at the Globes — the company’s only win came for Patricia Clarkson for “Sharp Objects” — but the party was packed as usual. Clarkson finally got her bite (she told reporters backstage that she hadn’t had “a bite or a breath” in days) as she celebrated with showrunner Marti Noxon, star Amy Adams, and others from the series.\n\nKieran Culkin of HBO’s “Succession” made the rounds, collecting compliments for the first-year drama about a venal family of media moguls. Mahershala Ali, who stars in the new season of “True Detective,” made a big entrance with his Globe win for “Green Book.”\n\nTiffany Haddish and Regina King, a winner for “If Beale Street Could Talk,” shared a few hugs and squeals, after King finished a huddle with Plepler that looked very much like the two were talking about some future business.\n\nCandice Bergen, Laura Dern, Ava DuVernay, Jason Blum, Pete Davidson, Lakeith Stanfield, and Patricia Arquette (a winner for Showtime’s “Escape at Dannemora”) were also among the revelers.\n\nJohn Stankey, the new boss of HBO parent company WarnerMedia, was also on hand to survey the after-party scene at his first Golden Globes. He praised the performance of HBO’s management team during the past few months as the erstwhile Time Warner has been absorbed into the AT&T universe.\n\nAfter months of “getting to know each other,” the marching orders for 2019 are very clear. “It’s now about execution,” Stankey said. — Cynthia Littleton\n\nGolden Globes Award Celebration\n\nWilshire Garden\n\nThe HFPA’s official viewing and after party was the place for winners — because that’s where they got their statuettes inscribed at an engraving station on an elevated platform at the back of the soiree.\n\nChaos ensued when a winner came through using the same entrance as the steady flow of servers and bussers.\n\nRachel Brosnahan and her entourage walked past the platform, before turning around after realizing they were going the wrong way.\n\nA staffer tried her best to keep onlookers away from the door, eventually succeeding by enlisting several others to direct people away from the entrance.\n\nGlenn Close arrived with her longtime agent Kevin Huvane. The “Wife” star chatted with Christian Bale, who was already having his trophy inscribed. “Today’s” Natalie Morales and Dave Karger finally pulled Close in for an interview after having to dodge several photographers on the platform.\n\nAlso getting their trophies personalized (and polished by staff wearing white gloves and using soft blue cloths for shining) were “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” creators Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.\n\nJeff Bridges was the next to arrive, quickly prompting a round of applause from guests. Unfortunately, his brother Beau Bridges wasn’t recognized by staffers and was told he could not join his sibling at the engraving station.\n\nDarren Criss kept hydrated by a bottle of Fiji water while at the station. Richard Madden filmed his engraving on his iPhone and Olivia Colman quickly wiped her hands on her dress before being handed her statuette.\n\nThe party featured poster size blow ups of photos from past Globes ceremonies, including pics of Sterling K. Brown, Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn and the cast of “Big Little Lies.”\n\nThe buffet offered mini teriyaki turkey burgers and scallions on steamed buns, firecracker popcorn shrimp served with creole dip, white truffle parmesan tater tots and waffle fries.\n\nThe music from deejay Coco was a fun mix of new with some old dance classics, including Crystal Waters’ 1991 track “Gypsy Woman (She’s Homeless”). — Marc Malkin"
