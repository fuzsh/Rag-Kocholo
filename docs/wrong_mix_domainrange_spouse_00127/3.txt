When you’ve won two Oscars and your best options are starring in “The Resident” and “New Year’s Eve,” you start to produce movies yourself. Thus Hilary Swank and 2S Films’ partner Molly Smith are producing their second feature, “You’re Not You,” directed by George C. Wolfe (“Nights in Rodanthe”) and adapted by Shana Feste and Jordan Roberts from Michelle Wilgden’s novel. “The business is ever elusive, always exciting, always frustrating,” Swank told TOH last year. “I want to make movies that people talk about.”

Emmy Rossum is in talks to co-star in Swank’s long-in-development “You’re Not You,” which traces the relationship between a former ad exec suffering from Lou Gehrig’s disease (Swank) and her caretaker, a directionless college student (Rossum) who is engaged in an affair with a married professor. She aids the sophisticated older woman as they navigate the swift progress of the disease.

Swank’s recent titles “Amelia” and “Conviction” didn’t gain much traction with critics or moviegoers. Next up is Philip Noyce’s more promising “Mary and Martha,” a Working Title drama written by Richard Curtis for the BBC and HBO about two women who lose their children to malaria. Brenda Blethyn co-stars.

Rossum, who followed her 2004 breakout roles in “The Day After Tomorrow” and “The Phantom of the Opera” with “Poseidon,” currently stars in the hit Showtime series “Shameless.” She will next appear in “Beautiful Creatures” (February 13, 2013) with Viola Davis, Emma Thompson, Alden Ehrenreich, Alice Englert, and Jeremy Irons.

2S Films’ Swank and Smith, who have a first-look deal with Alcon Entertainment, are producing with Denise Di Novi and Alison Greenspan of Di Novi Pictures, who produced Wolfe’s “Nights In Rodanthe.” Financing is from Darryl Prince Productions.
