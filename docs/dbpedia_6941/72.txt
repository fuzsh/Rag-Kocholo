[Singing]

He that has and a little tiny wit–

With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,–

Must make content with his fortunes fit,

For the rain it raineth every day.—Fool (Lear 2.2)

The relationship of the characters’ interior states to the stormy exterior space in which they inhabit contains, in the stage direction and dialogue in King Lear, act 2’s storm scene, the capacity for a stunning visual spectacle. Akira Kurosawa’s 1985 period tragedy/film adaptation of Lear into historical Japan, Ran, takes full advantage of the storm scene and spreads the play’s storm and eclipse imagery throughout the film to interesting visual effect. Ran depicts the plight of Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging Sengoku-period warlord, in a throwback to Japanese, rather than English, history, that exchanges Lear’s three daughters for three sons.

It is especially interesting to note, for instance, the times at which Shakespeare’s stage direction–”storm still”–occur throughout scene 2, and how they coincide with Kurosawa’s directorial choices. For instance, in Ran, clouds expanding in dramatic close-ups are a constant theme from act 1, scene 1, the wild boar scene and its aftermath, when Lear divides the kingdoms to–in this case–three (then two) sons. The Guardian in a 2010 article called it “a storming Japanese Lear, spiced with Lady Macbeth” (another interesting aspect of the adaptation to analyze). Further, as Saviour Catania notes in “Wailing Woodwind Wild: The Noh Transcription of Silent Sounds in Kurosawa’s Ran,” “Thematically hollowness is of the essence, for Ran echoes throughout with Shakespearean silent sounds. Thus, though the cloud formations darken into an eclipse in the Third Castle conflict, they typically thunder in discordant silence. The effect is more manacingly oneric than that of Goneril’s vision of England as a ‘noiseless land’ (4.2.57) … for it equally evokes Edmund’s England plagued by ominous ‘eclipses [that] portend … divisions’ (1.2.136-7)” (89).

Examining digital, searchable versions of both texts–Shakespeare’s Lear and Kurosawa’s screenplay and storyboard images–as well as film criticism as shown in the references listed below, students are able to note and analyze commonalities in Shakespeare and Kurosawa’s source-texts with digital tools for data mining.

In this lesson plan, the overall goal/objective/theme is that students will work in a class discussion board on the learning management system (LMS) to visually and textually depict and present close reading/analysis of key themes of King Lear, act 2 as depicted in Kurosawa’s Ran. This lesson incorporates multiple methodologies so that students can form creative connections/insights via multiple learning methods to include: cultural studies, close reading, production analysis, digital humanities.

Due to its incorporation of Instagram-inspired blogs and digital humanities as noted below, searchable-text aspects/features, this lesson plan is ideal for undergraduate students of Shakespeare, and due to the creative nature of this lesson plan, it will also work well for more advanced, graduate English literature/cultural studies and film students, because students can employ more advanced reading tactics/analysis at different levels. The multiple methodologies appeal to multiple skill levels and learning strategies for visual and audible learners.

Beginning

How will I engage the learners: motivational strategy, hook, activation of prior knowledge?

In class, the instructor will provide an overview presentation of Akira Kurosawa and his career and influence in world film as one of the most acclaimed directors of all time. This can include a visual, PowerPoint aspect to the presentation due to Kurosawa’s films’ obvious visual appeal and include emphasis on Rashomon, Seven Samurai and his Macbeth adaptation, Throne of Blood, culminating in a discussion of his Lear adaptation, Ran. Due to time constraints, students can either watch Ran as a class–after having read the full-text of King Lear–or for homework. For this lesson, the instructor and students will discuss Lear act 2, then watch the clip depicting act 2, referencing their digital texts of both Lear and the Ran screenplay as they take notes and then discuss as a class and/or in pairs the visual and audio choices Kurosawa made in translating this play to the Japanese historical setting. Middle

How does the lesson develop? How are new concepts/processes learned? By gradual empowerment? Modeled, shared or guided instruction?

For homework, students will read the film criticism articles “Wailing Woodwind Wild: The Noh Transcription of Silent Sounds in Kurosawa’s Ran,” “Subtitles and Audiences: The Translation and Circulation of the films of Akira Kurosawa,” and “Blood Visibility/Invisibility in Ran.” They will then post to a discussion board on the learning management system (LMS). Each discussion post will contain (1) a photo or short video clip (2) lines, (3) close reading/commentary, in a digital humanities analysis/close reading project that spans 2 weeks or more. They can use screenshots or photos they take of the TV screen of Kurosawa’s Ran, act 2 (and/or other acts if applicable) and/or that they find in the illustrated and storyboard texts listed above. This discussion should be conducted internally to the course, via the LMS, to avoid copyright issues. End

How will I conclude this lesson? How will we integrate the ideas/experiences? How will I check for understanding? Application–what will learners do to demonstrate their learning?

Students will convene as a class and showcase in lightning-talk presentations (length dependent on class size/time) the visual choices, interpretations and textual impacts they uncovered reflecting on this assignment through close reading and digital searching/data mining of Kurosawa’s script and their digital editions of Lear act 2. Their discussion posts can be rolled into and used as reference points for a final paper that culminates/distills their knowledge and experience using the digital humanities approach to Lear.
