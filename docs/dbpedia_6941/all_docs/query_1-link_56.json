        "text": "King Lear\n\nBRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\n\nShakespeare's father was a glove-maker, and Shakespeare received no more than a grammar school education. He married Anne Hathaway in 1582, but left his family behind around 1590 and moved to London, where he became an actor and playwright. He was an immediate success: Shakespeare soon became the most popular playwright of the day as well as a part-owner of the Globe Theater. His theater troupe was adopted by King James as the King's Men in 1603. Shakespeare retired as a rich and prominent man to Stratford-upon-Avon in 1613, and died three years later.\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nIn the period in which King Lear was written—from 1604 to 1607—King James VI, King of Scotland and England, was trying to persuade English Parliament to approve the union of the two countries into one nation. (It was James who first used the term \"Great Britain\" to describe the unity of the Celtic and Saxon lands: England, Scotland, and Wales.) Such a combination of nations is called \"accession.\" In his speeches to Parliament, he regularly referred to the misfortunes that had been brought about by the disunion of England under King Leir, the historical source of Shakespeare's play. The historical context of Shakespeare's King Lear is thus twofold. Reading it you should keep in mind both the history of King Leir and the discussions on union/disunion of Great Britain in Shakespeare's own time.\n\nRELATED LITERARY WORKS\n\nShakespeare drew the main plot of King Lear—that is, the story of a ruler who divides his kingdom among his children and is consequently ruined—from several sources describing the legendary British king of that name. Scholars believe that the most important source was the second edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1587); Holinshed himself had taken the story of Lear from the History of the British Kingdom by Geoffrey of Monmouth, written in the twelfth century. (Critics have also pointed out that Lear's rejection of Cordelia resembles numerous classical British fairy tales, where a father rejects a daughter on the grounds that he does not believe she loves him enough.) Shakespeare drew further subplots from Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queen (1590), which also features a character named Cordelia, who dies by hanging; and from Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia (1580-90), which contains an outline of the Gloucester subplot.\n\nKEY FACTS\n\nFull Title: The Tragedy of King Lear\n\nWhen Written: c. 1605\n\nWhere Written: England\n\nWhen Published: 1608; 1623\n\nLiterary Period: The Renaissance\n\nGenre: Tragedy\n\nSetting: England, in pre-Christian times\n\nClimax: Lear raging in the thunderstorm\n\nAntagonist: Regan, Goneril, Edmund\n\nEXTRA CREDIT\n\nPoor Tom. The character of Poor Tom or the Bedlam Beggar, as which Edgar disguises himself, is based on vagabonds or madmen considered dangerous in England at the time. \"Bedlam\" was a slang word for \"Bethlehem,\" which was the name of a mental institution in London.\n\nTwo Versions. There are actually two different versions of King Lear—The History of King Lear published in quarto form in 1608 and The Tragedy of King Lear, which was published in the First Folio (1623) and is very substantially revised from the play published in 1608. Before the 1990s, editors usually \"blended\" the two texts, taking what they believed were the best versions of each scene. In recent times, some editors have started focusing on the \"original\" 1608 edition.\n\nPoor Fool. In Shakespeare's day, the roles of Cordelia and the Fool were often \"doubled\"—played by the same actor—since the two characters are never on stage at the same time. Shakespeare alludes to this fact at several points in the play. The first time that Lear summons the Fool, in 1, both he and his Knight observe that the Fool has been melancholy ever since Cordelia was sent to France. More famously, in 5, upon learning of Cordelia's death, Lear remarks \"And my poor fool is hanged\" (5.3). Sometimes directors staging the play invent a scene in which the Fool himself is hanged, to explain this line, but the tradition of doubling the characters is the better explanation.\n\nKing Lear intends to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, so that he can enjoy old age without the burdens of power. He has planned a ceremony in which each daughter will state how much she loves him, before an audience of nobles\n\nINTRINTRODUCTIONODUCTION\n\nPLPLOOT SUMMARYT SUMMARY\n\nincluding Lear's long-trusted advisor, Kent, the Earl of Gloucester, and two suitors for his youngest daughter's hand, Burgundy and France. During the ceremony, his elder daughters, Goneril and Regan each profess to love Lear more than anything in the world. However, his youngest daughter, Cordelia, refuses to play along; when her turn comes, she says that she loves Lear \"no more, no less\" than she should as a daughter. Enraged, Lear strips her of her dowry, and banishes Kent when the latter attempts to intercede on Cordelia's behalf. France says he will marry Cordelia even without a dowry. Lear then tells the gathered nobles that he will keep one hundred knights and alternate months living with Goneril and her husband, Albany, and Regan and her husband, Cornwall.\n\nBack at Gloucester's palace, Edmund, Gloucester's illegitimate son, plans to displace his legitimate brother, Edgar, as Gloucester's heir by turning Gloucester against Edgar. Edmund tricks Gloucester into thinking that Edgar is conspiring to kill him. Meanwhile, Goneril, with whom Lear has gone to live first, becomes angry with her father and his knights for causing chaos in her household. She orders her steward Oswald to treat Lear coldly. Meanwhile, the banished Kent returns to Lear in disguise, offers his services, and is accepted as part of Lear's company. Goneril criticizes Lear for his knights' rowdiness and demands that he dismiss half of them. Deeply insulted and angered, Lear curses Goneril and prepares to leave to go and stay with Regan along with his Fool and his other followers.\n\nBack at Gloucester's castle, Edmund's conspiracy moves along. After Edmund tricks Edgar into fleeing, Gloucester, convinced of Edgar's evil intentions, condemns him to death, declaring Edmund his legitimate heir. Cornwall and Regan arrive at Gloucester's castle and welcome Edmund into their service. Outside, Kent and Oswald arrive with letters for Regan from Lear and Goneril. Kent insults Oswald and challenges him to fight. Roused by the disturbance, Cornwall puts Kent into the stocks—even though such an action is disrespectful to Lear. Elsewhere in the countryside, Edgar disguises himself as a mad beggar \"Poor Tom\" in order to escape the death sentence declared by his father. Lear himself arrives at Gloucester's castle. Upset to find his man Kent (still in disguise) in the stocks, he grows increasingly angry when Cornwall and Regan refuse to see him. Shortly after Regan finally comes out, Goneril arrives. Lear quarrels bitterly with both, as Regan joins Goneril in claiming that Lear does not need to maintain any attendants of his own. When each says that he may stay with them only if he dismisses all of his knights, Lear rushes, mad with rage, into a brewing storm. Cornwall, Regan, and Goneril lock up Gloucester's castle to keep Lear out.\n\nSearching for Lear, Kent, who has been released from the stocks, meets a Gentleman who tells him that Lear and the Fool are alone in the storm. Kent tells the Gentleman that French forces are on their way to England. He gives the Gentleman his purse along with an identifying ring to bring to Cordelia, and\n\nasks the Gentleman to tell her about the injustice that Lear has suffered. Meanwhile, Lear has gone mad and is raging against the storm, while the Fool begs him to seek shelter. When Kent finds them, he leads them toward a hovel. Back inside the castle, Gloucester confides in Edmund that he has decided to try to help Lear; he also reports that he has received a letter about the French invasion. After Gloucester leaves to find Lear, Edmund tells the audience that he will betray his father to Cornwall. Out on the heath, having reached the hovel, Lear, Kent, and the Fool find Edgar, disguised as Poor Tom, inside. Gloucester finds them soon after, and leads them to the shelter of a house. Inside Gloucester's castle, Edmund tells Cornwall about Gloucester's decision to help Lear and hands over the incriminating letter from France. In return, Cornwall makes Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Back in the house, hiding from the storm, Lear hallucinates that Goneril and Regan are on trial before himself, Edgar, and the Fool. Gloucester returns, tells Kent that Goneril, Regan, and their husbands are plotting Lear's death, and asks Kent to rush Lear to Cordelia, who has landed with France at Dover. Back inside the palace, Cornwall sends men to capture Gloucester and sends Edmund and Goneril to tell Albany that the French have landed. When Cornwall's forces bring in the captured Gloucester, Cornwall and Regan pull out Gloucester's eyes as punishment for his treachery. However, Cornwall's Servant attempts to stop him; they end up dueling. Although Regan stabs the servant in the back, Cornwall receives a wound that will eventually kill him. Regan throws the now blinded Gloucester out of his own castle. Two servants take pity on Gloucester, and decide to try to help him find Poor Tom, who they know is Edgar in disguise. Outside Gloucester's palace, Edgar, still disguised as Poor Tom, meets his blinded father. Deeply moved, he agrees to show him the way to Dover. Meanwhile, Goneril and Edmund have traveled back to her palace to fetch Albany. However, Oswald meets them and reports that Albany has changed. Goneril quickly sends Edmund away. When Albany emerges, he berates her for her brutality to her father. In response, she criticizes him for becoming cowardly. A messenger arrives, interrupting their argument with news of both the death of Cornwall from the wound his servant gave him as well as the blinding of Gloucester. In the French camp, Kent and a Gentleman discuss Cordelia's love of Lear, which has brought her back to Britain at the head of an invading French army. Kent reports that Lear himself is in Dover and, although he has spells of sanity, he is too ashamed to see Cordelia. In the camp, Cordelia herself sends a search party after her father. Back at Gloucester's palace, Regan questions Oswald about Goneril and Edmund. She states her feeling that, now that she is a widow, she should marry Edmund and asks Oswald to convince Goneril of the logic of this. As Oswald hurries off with a letter for Edmund from Goneril,\n\nlate in the play to prevent the evil that they cause.\n\nFFrranceance – The husband of Cordelia. France is a benevolent character, who takes Cordelia as his wife without a dowry, when she has been rejected by her father, and even sends her back to England with the French army to rectify the wrongs carried out by Goneril and Regan against Lear. However, France only appears in the first scene.\n\nMINOR CHARACTERS\n\nReganRegan – Lear's middle daughter, who shares the vicious traits of Goneril, also flattering him in the power-transfer scene and abusing him thereafter. Regan shows her particularly brutal nature when she aids her husband, the Duke of Cornwall, in blinding Gloucester.\n\nGloucesterGloucester – An earl, or nobleman, who is loyal to Lear and similar to him in many ways. Like Lear, Gloucester misjudges his children, trusting his scheming illegitimate son, Edmund, over his honest and good child from his legal marriage, Edgar.\n\nCornCornwallwall – Cornwall is the husband of Lear's middle daughter, Regan, and just as vicious as she is. He disrespects Lear by putting his man Kent in the stocks and, later, violently blinds Gloucester.\n\nOswaldOswald – Goneril's steward, or chief servant. Oswald's blind obedience to the evil Goneril earns him contempt from the \"good\" characters Kent and Edgar, and eventually costs him his life.\n\nCurrCurranan – Gloucester's servant.\n\nIn LitCharts literature guides, each theme gets its own color- coded icon. These icons make it easy to track where the themes occur most prominently throughout the work. If you don't have a color printer, you can still use the icons to track themes in black and white.\n\nFATHERS, CHILDREN, AND SIBLINGS\n\nThe personal drama of King Lear revolves around the destruction of family relationships. Tragedy emerges from bonds broken between parents and children—and, at a secondary level, from the loss of ties among siblings. Lear, misreading Cordelia's understated, but true, devotion to him renounces his \"parental care\" (1.1) of her. This rejection is twofold. Lear withdraws his \"father's heart\" (1.1); he also strips Cordelia of the financial and political support that formerly made her attractive to her suitors. Driven by greed and ambition, Goneril and Regan fail to show any solidarity with their sister in 1. And later, despite their strong professions of love for Lear, they both betray him in order to consolidate their political authority. In addition,\n\nalthough the two \"tigers, not daughters\" (4.2) initially ally with each other, their lustful desire for Edmund ultimately drive Goneril to murder Regan, before committing suicide when Edmund himself is killed, thus ensuring the complete annihilation of the Lear line. Edmund's conspiracy to mislead Gloucester into disinheriting his legitimate son Edgar provides a foil to the Lear family situation throughout the play. Edmund—who is Gloucester's illegitimate or \"natural\" son from an affair outside marriage, rather than a legitimate or \"legal\" one—further highlights the question of where parent-child loyalty stems from: biology or socially acknowledged status. And, indeed, the private or familial sphere is inseparable from the public and political realm in King Lear. Fatherhood, in the play, serves as a model and metaphor for kingly leadership, while the narrative regarding the disintegration of families parallels the disintegration of the British state.\n\nAUTHORITY AND ORDER\n\nAt the beginning of the play, Lear is an authority figure, embodying order in his own person and commanding it from his family and followers. (This is how he is able to compel his elder two daughters to participate in the dramatic ceremony dividing the kingdom by professing their absolute love on cue, precisely when he demands it; this is why Gloucester, Kent, and others respectfully watch the ceremony unfold, despite thinking that Lear's plan to give up power is a bad idea.) Just as the father- child bonds discussed above encompass both a private and a public dimension, authority and order in this play exist at both the level of the family and the level of the nation. Throughout the tragedy, Lear and other characters also repeatedly invoke the ideas of natural and divine order. Lear appeals to the idea of divine justice when his children treat him unjustly (e. after his final quarrel with Goneril and Regan: \"O heavens,/ If you do love old men [...] Send down and take my part\" [2.4-221]). Gloucester similarly calls out to the gods after he has been betrayed and blinded in 3. Meanwhile, nature in the play seems to mirror the political chaos of the play, particularly in the form of the brutal storm that rages even as Lear himself, the former embodiment of order in the kingdom, rages in his own madness.\n\nDISINTEGRATION, CHAOS,\n\nNOTHINGNESS\n\nAlthough Lear begins as a figure of authority and order, when he gives up his power and Goneril and Regan turn against him, he falls apart, going mad. Moreover, his personal decline parallels a farther-reaching dissolution of order and justice in the British state. Lear's error, based on blindness and misjudgment, doesn't just ruin him personally. It\n\nTHEMESTHEMES\n\nleads to a political situation in which there is no order to guarantee justice, despite his (and Gloucester's) repeated appeals to the gods.\n\nCordelia's first answer to Lear's command that she pronounce her love for him, the answer that first enrages him against her, is (in 1) is \"nothing.\" After that first appearance, the word \"nothing\" recurs constantly throughout the play in the mouths of multiple characters. The repetition of this word highlights the theme of nothingness, and of the complete lack of meaning that results from nothingness – after all, when everything is destroyed, it is not possible to compare anything to anything else, and in such a void, without any ability to compare, nothing can have any meaning. And, ultimately, it is hard to argue that the ending of the play offers any justice at all: while the \"bad guys\" of Edmund, Goneril, Regan, and Cornwall are all killed, so are the heroes of Lear, Gloucester, and Cordelia. Nearly the entire social order, good and bad, is annihilated and turned to nothing. As Lear himself cries out in the moments before he dies, while holding the dead Cordelia in his arms, with his kingdom destroyed: \"Never, never, never, never, never\" (5.3).\n\nOLD AGE\n\nOriginally, Lear wishes to free himself of the burdens of ruling his kingdom because he is aware of his old age and wishes to \"crawl unburdened toward death\" (1.1). As his choice of the verb \"crawl\" suggests, Lear has a sense that old age forces the individual to remember his or her animal aspect—that is, the fact that human beings, like animals, are subjected to the forces of physical nature and have physical needs.\n\nAge as Goneril and Regan unkindly observe at various points, brings a kind of weakness with it. Regan mocks Lear: \"O, sir, you are old [...] You should be ruled and led/ By some discretion that discerns your state/ Better than you yourself\" [2.4-9]. Yet, together with the father-child bond, the play also suggests at various points that age should command respect. The fact that Lear's daughters abuse him for being old makes their cruelty seem all the worse and also indicates that all they care about is power, without any thought for wisdom. Cornwall and Regan's brutality to Gloucester is similarly heightened by our awareness of his age—for instance, when Regan plucks Gloucester's white beard in 3.\n\nFOOLING AND MADNESS\n\nFrom early on in the play, the Fool is probably the character with the greatest insight into what the consequences of Lear's misjudgments of his daughters will be. (The Fool's only competition in this respect comes from Kent in 1; in 1 Gloucester seems only to have a vague intuition that Lear's decision was a mistake.) Calling Lear\n\nhimself a Fool and admonishing him that he has reduced himself to \"nothing\" by dividing and handing off his kingdom, the Fool recognizes that by giving up his authority Lear is essentially ensuring his own destruction and the destruction of his kingdom. Just as the Fool's apparently nonsensical comments contain some of the most sensible advice that Lear receives on his behavior, Lear himself gains increasing insight into his situation as he moves from sanity to madness. His raving—for instance, in the storm or on Dover Beach—often resembles the riddling, but incisive, barbs of the Fool. It is possible to argue that in a world that itself does not seem to make sense—a world of death, of raging storms, of children who turn against their parents—it makes sense that madness might be the most sane reaction. Deliberately adopting the mad manner of a bedlam beggar, Edgar provides a counterpoint to Lear's uncontrollable madness, particularly in the storm scene (3).\n\nBLINDNESS AND INSIGHT\n\nThe tragic errors that King Lear and Gloucester make in misjudging their children constitute a form of figurative blindness—a lack of insight into the true characters of those around them. Reminding the audience of this fact, the language of the play resounds with references to eyes and seeing from the very beginning. Cornwall and Regan make these images and metaphors of (failed) vision brutally literal when they blind Gloucester in 3. For the remainder of the play, Gloucester serves as a kind of walking reminder of the tragic errors of blindness that he and Lear have committed. Yet, Gloucester's greater insight into the character of his two sons after he is blinded reflects an irony: literal blindness ironically produces insight. Only when Gloucester is blind can he see things for what they are. Throughout the play, characters allude to, and call upon, the gods and the heavens watching over them. As noted above, the gods and heavens suggest order and eventual justice. However, as watchers of the action of the play, the gods also become a kind of audience, and like the audience they both see the story of what is happening more completely than the individual characters on stage and can't seem to do anything to stop it.\n\nSymbols appear in teal text throughout the Summary and Analysis sections of this LitChart.\n\nSYMBOLSSYMBOLS\n\nat the flattery practiced by her sisters.\n\nThough contemporary readers might interpret “I want” here to mean that Cordelia desires the art of speech, in Shakespearean English it means something closer to “I lack.” This distinction is relevant to making sense of Cordelia’s character: she does not wish to abandon her principles, but rather affirms that she cannot deviate from them. Describing speech as “glib” highlights how it is superficial and insincere, while “oily” connotes a slimy or over- flattering type of language. Though she does not directly criticize her sisters, Cordelia implies that their language is “glib and oily” in a way that hers cannot be. Intriguingly, Cordelia’s words are themselves quite eloquent here. They may not be obsequious, but they are concise and effective—thus showing that she possesses linguistic skill, but simply not the art of flattery.\n\nMore broadly, Cordelia differentiates between speech and intention when she juxtaposes “to speak” with “purpose not.” Unlike Lear, who assumes that the “nothing” of her speech implies a “nothing” of emotional attachment, Cordelia is able to recognize the difference between words and things. This insight, however, does not necessarily aid her in the play—for while it may grant her an effective moral compass, it also denies her inheritance and leaves her open to others’ manipulative behaviors.\n\n\"Yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.\"\n\nRelated Characters: Regan (speaker), King Lear\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nPage Number: 1.1-\n\nExplanation and Analysis\n\nAs Scene One draws to a close, Regan and Goneril discuss their father’s dwindling mental capacities. Here, Regan comments that this is no new development, for Lear has historically lacked personal insight.\n\nThis conversation predicts the way Regan and Goneril will deny their father’s authority and install themselves with increasing power over him. To do so, however, they must justify their actions not only to others but also to themselves. One of their main strategies to do so is to take aim at Lear’s old age—and to argue that he is unfit to rule or even make personal decisions. Here, Regan takes an even more aggressive tactic, to note that Lear’s mental decline is in fact characteristic of his more general sensibility. That he has “but slenderly known himself” at any point in his life\n\nwould imply that his commands cannot be trusted to conform to his actual wishes and desires. More than a manipulative tactic, however, this sentence introduces the theme of introspection and self-knowledge. This question predominates King Lear, as many of the characters battle to harness their emotions and to make rational decisions that correlate with their actual needs. Regan’s point here is to take the example of aging and extrapolate it to a broader phenomenon: how many lack the thoughtfulness necessary to identify their wishes and inner nature.\n\nAct 1, scene 2 Quotes\n\n\"Thou, Nature, art my goddess.\"\n\nRelated Characters: Edmund (speaker)\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nRelated Symbols:\n\nPage Number: 1.\n\nExplanation and Analysis Edmund bemoans how his status as a bastard prevents him from having a claim to his father's title. As a result, he renounces the value of human laws and instead chooses to exalt the wonder of “Nature.” Here we see Edmund turn away for the first time from the systems that organize human life. He reveals a wish to violate social norms and seize power for himself. Since “Nature” exists beyond the royal system that delineates between legitimate and illegitimate children, it offers a world in which Edmund could receive a proper inheritance. That Edmund selects nature to be his “goddess” also marks a subtle turn away from Christianity and toward paganism. Though religion is not a blatant theme in King Lear, it bubbles under the tragedy’s surface. Edmund’s embrace of Nature could be seen as somewhat heretical, which foreshadows the way he will sin both spiritually and politically in order to further his own ascent to power. His soliloquy also initiates a pattern in King Lear of characters seeking solace or support in the natural environment. The tragedy often juxtaposes the banality and social cruelty of the human realm with a more egalitarian and open natural world. Shakespeare positions nature as an open psychological and physical space on which characters can project their ideal worlds, beyond the constraints of\n\nnormative human society.\n\n\"These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us.\"\n\nRelated Characters: Gloucester (speaker)\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nRelated Symbols:\n\nPage Number: 1.2-\n\nExplanation and Analysis\n\nEdmund has just falsely informed Gloucester that Edgar is plotting against his father. Gloucester notes, as he wonders how to proceed, that the movements in the heavenly bodies foreshadow negative events to come.\n\nThis passage speaks to the important role of omens for the characters of King Lear. Various characters refer to the way the heavens ordain human events, and thus examining their movements offers a way to guess at the future. Gloucester believes, here, that he can interpret “late eclipses”—moments when light is blocked from the sun or moon—as signs of “no good” to come. (Symbolically, we could say that the light of royalty and stability will be eclipsed by deceit and eventually murder.) Shakespeare thus presents Gloucester as adhering to the value of fate—believing the the heavens determine his life more than individual human action.\n\nIt is intriguing that Gloucester brings up the idea of heavenly bodies just after Edmund has sworn allegiance to nature. Though they both seem to be appealing to the same force, their ways of doing so are vastly different. If Edmund sees in nature a space beyond the moral and social constraints of humanity, Gloucester instead sees a divine power that rules over and intersects human affairs. The first sees it as a space apart; the second as deeply integrated. In this way, Shakespeare treats nature and the heavens as a complex symbolic system—a site that various characters interpret differently based on their own beliefs and ends.\n\n\"As if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion.\"\n\nRelated Characters: Edmund (speaker)\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nRelated Symbols:\n\nPage Number: 1.2-\n\nExplanation and Analysis After Gloucester departs, Edmund mocks his father’s comments on the heavens. He believes that the motion of the planets do nothing to ordain human action. With these characters, Shakespeare establishes two poles on the question of human agency in the context of heavenly predestination. Whereas Gloucester believes that eclipses in the sky predict negative events in the human world, Edmund finds this perspective ridiculous. This debate speaks to a philosophical question on free will, but it also expresses a generational difference. Just as Lear values ceremonial behavior and adherence to tradition, Gloucester finds deference the heavens to be important. Friction arises with both sets of children because the younger generations seek increased personal control. To substantiate his claim on the heavens, Edmund gives two examples of where human identities should not reasonably conform to fate: “villains” and “fools.” Shakespeare has not arbitrarily selected these terms. Being himself a villain (as he has just decided), Edmund is implicitly claiming that he acts according to his own will as opposed to the effect of any celestial body. Yet we could take his exploits as proof that Gloucester was correct that eclipses foretold negative events. “Fools” will play an important role later in the tragedy, when both actual and artificial fools render unclear whether the heavens or human action lead to madness. Thus even as Edmund disparages his father’s belief in destiny, Shakespeare subtly designs the structure of the tragedy to reiterate the ever-present role of fate.\n\nAct 1, scene 3 Quotes\n\n\"Old fools are babes again.\"\n\nRelated Characters: Goneril (speaker), King Lear\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nPage Number: 1.\n\nExplanation and Analysis During Lear’s visit, Goneril becomes increasingly frustrated with her father. She complains about how elderly people regress to a stage of seeming infancy.\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nRelated Symbols:\n\nPage Number: 2.3-\n\nExplanation and Analysis Having fled his father’s castle, Edgar finds himself alone in the wilderness. He decides to take on the disguise of a fool called “Poor Tom” in order protect himself from being recognized and killed. Edgar begins, first, by declaring this intention to “preserve” himself, marking basic survival as his primary intention. Saying, “bethought to take the basest and most poorest shape” declares that the best way to protect himself will be to take on an alternative identity and costume of lowliness. That his “penury” or poverty will be “in contempt of men” implies that his false identity will inherently criticize the morally-empty pomp and circumstance of those from which he hides. Thus he will take on the role of the “beast” primarily for self-protection, but also with an inherent skepticism of others, particularly the morally-bankrupt \"nobility.\" This passage takes the theme of man’s relationship to the wilderness in an intriguing direction: in order to best protect himself from the human world of deceit, Edgar must approximate the wilderness as much as possible—becoming “the basest and most poorest shape” that he can. In an odd way, this recourse to nature follows in Edmund’s footsteps: not only is he locating in wilderness something that was lacking in the human world, but he even invokes the tropes of baseness associated with Edmund illegitimacy. Yet whereas Edmund sought a reprieve from legal and moral justice, Edgar is seeking protection only from a misapplication of that justice. Thus Shakespeare presents nature as a repository of both productive and counter- productive divergences from human society.\n\nAct 2, scene 4 Quotes\n\n\"O sir, you are old. Nature I you stands on the very verge Of his confine.\"\n\nRelated Characters: Regan (speaker), King Lear\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nPage Number: 2.4-\n\nExplanation and Analysis Regan and Goneril argue with Lear about his behavior in their households. During the fight, Regan comments on his age and the way he approaches his mental and physical demise. Her accusation returns to the question of how insanity and elderliness interplay: Regan firmly contends that the decline of Lear’s mental capacities is responsible for his erratic behaviors. Here, she offers a somewhat new take on the issue when she brings in the ever-present image of “Nature.” Here, “Nature” signifies a wild realm beyond a human, rational range of understanding. That this force is “on the very verge of his confine” means that the specter of madness approaches Lear. His “confine” would thus stand for the metaphorical borders of his sanity—which, if breached by Nature, would shatter his mind. In this way, Regan defines a very fragile conception of human intelligence and control, in which emotional instability or old age could potentially weaken one’s “confine.” For her, “Nature” is a set of wild forces waiting to burst in and take advantage of human weakness the moment social or mental stability fails.\n\n\"O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars Are in the poorest thing superfluous. Allow not nature more than nature needs, Man's life is cheap as beast's.\"\n\nRelated Characters: King Lear (speaker)\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nRelated Symbols:\n\nPage Number: 2.4-\n\nExplanation and Analysis Lear becomes increasingly deranged during his conversation with Goneril and Regan. He begins raving, here, about the meaninglessness of life and how all men are essentially equivalent to beggars. As with many of Shakespeare’s supposedly mad characters, Lear chooses images that seem nonsensical at first but actually contain real philosophical significance. When he says that beggars “are in the poorest things superfluous,” he plays with the question of ownership and inheritance. Indeed, beggars have a great deal of “the poorest things”—the “nothing” so oft referenced in the play. In this way, they are weirdly superior to the rich. Lear continues to\n\naffirm the value of poverty when he continues, “allow not nature more than nature needs,” pointing to the way nature requires no human accessories or niceties to exist.\n\nAt this point, Lear could have still defined nature to be a separate space from human society, but when he adds, “Man’s life is cheap as beast’s” he brings the two together. That is to say, in this new worldview, men should not consider themselves superior to animals; their reason and things bring them no special existential merits. The choice of the economic term “cheap” stresses the foolishness inherent in how humans assess their lives in terms of money. Thus beneath Lear’s apparent madness, one can actually trace a complex critique of human society, one which has come from Lear’s experiences with his daughters greed and deceit. Indeed, saying “reason not the need” Lear seems to be aware of the value in his insanity. If he indeed finds “reason” empty or unnecessary, he is explicitly saying so. This passage thus brings into question the full extent of Lear’s insanity: has he actually lost his mind, or has he gained greater clarity into human folly?\n\n\"Here's a night pities neither wise men nor fools.\"\n\nRelated Characters: Fool (speaker)\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nPage Number: 3.2-\n\nExplanation and Analysis\n\nLear and his Fool stand amidst the overpowering storm. The first shouts at the natural forces, while the second offers these more reasoned statements.\n\nThe Fool is here describing the way Nature does not affect humans differently based on their social status. This night “pities” none more than others, because it affects all equally. Physically, this would be taking place on the stage as we would see King Lear and the Fool equally affected by the “night.” This statement quite cleverly plays with the opposition between “wise men” and “fools.” Note how the Fool and Lear continue to switch roles: whereas the supposedly wise king is screaming insanely into the environment, the supposedly jesting Fool is offering poignant commentary. Yet that Fool’s wise comment is to once more equate wise men and fools! After all, it is in his madness rather than his earlier rationality that Lear seems more introspective and intelligent. Thus the effect is not particularly to invert their roles but rather to, amidst a physical and metaphorical storm, show how fluidly\n\nintelligence and insanity bleed together.\n\n\"The art of our necessities is strange And can make vile things precious.\"\n\nRelated Characters: King Lear (speaker)\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nPage Number: 3.2-\n\nExplanation and Analysis Still amidst the storm, Lear reflects on the insignificance of physical possessions. He observes how little humans require in certain circumstances. Once again, Shakespeare places philosophically significant statements in the mouth of a madman. That Lear considers “our necessities” to be an “art” is a subtle paradox, for arts are generally taken to be a supplement to human existence rather than a strict requirement. Being a “strange” art further muddles the definition of “necessities,” which we would expect to be clear-cut and self-evident rather than uncertain. When Lear adds that this art “can make vile things precious” he points to the power human psychology has in reshaping its relationship to external objects. Things that should seen disgusting can be made “precious” with sufficient art—indeed they may even come to be seen as necessities. Lear’s confrontation with the primal nature of the storm thus seems to have radically altered his sense of what is essential versus superfluous. Shakespeare shows how his earlier conceptions have been opened up by this poignant confrontation with environmental and internal madness—ironically giving him greater insight than he had while supposedly sane.\n\nAct 3, scene 4 Quotes\n\n\"Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are, That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm, How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides, Your looped and windowed raggedness defend you From seasons such as these? O I have taken Too little care of this.\"\n\nRelated Characters: King Lear (speaker)\n\nRelated Themes:\n\n\"Out, vile jelly!\"\n\nRelated Characters: Cornwall (speaker), Gloucester\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nPage Number: 3.\n\nExplanation and Analysis After Gloucester helps Lear escape, Goneril demands that his eyes be removed. Cornwall makes this odd pronouncement as he follows her order. This command speaks to the evil inherent in Cornwall and Goneril’s characters. Despite Gloucester’s genuine intentions, Cornwall and Goneril not only torture and punish him but also verbally ridicule him as they do so. “Jelly” refers, here, to the physical substance of Gloucester’s eye, so Cornwall has claimed it is “vile” because of Gloucester’s misdeeds. In a sense to call his eyesight vile is correct, for Gloucester has repeatedly been blind to the behaviors of Edgar and Edmund—first metaphorically for believing that Edgar was plotting against him, and then literally for not being able to recognize Edgar as Poor Tom. Yet calling Gloucester “vile” is also highly ironic on Cornwall’s part, considering that his very action in the moment is even more despicable. Shakespeare thus presents a cycle of violence and retribution, in which metaphorical blindness becomes increasingly literal—but in which the agents of poetic justice are themselves even more hateful than those they're punishing.\n\nAct 4, scene 1 Quotes\n\n\"The worst is not So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'\"\n\nRelated Characters: Edgar (speaker)\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nPage Number: 4.1-\n\nExplanation and Analysis Edgar is reflecting on his lowly position when he sees the blind Gloucester led by an Old Man. He revises his earlier beliefs, pointing out that many are far worse off than himself and that, indeed, the ability to observe how bad things are must mean they are not at the absolute bottom. That Edgar’s observations are induced by seeing the Old Man and Gloucester reiterates how the tragic action offers perspective on one’s own misfortune. Edgar may have pitied\n\nhimself, but once he sees others in even more dire straights, he realizes that he was being ridiculous all along. His very ability to reflect on his state of affairs is juxtaposed with their lack of composure. This passage also returns to the question of how language can often deviate from reality. One would assume that saying “This is the worst” would imply that things are indeed at their most terrible, but Edgar points out that it is just the opposite. The very ability to speak those words implies a level of composure and reflection—indeed an ability to speak!—that must mean the state of affairs could be even worse. Thus not only can language misrepresent reality, in this case, the statement itself must misrepresent reality.\n\nAct 4, scene 2 Quotes\n\n\"The nature which contemns its origin Cannot be bordered certain in itself.\"\n\nRelated Characters: Albany (speaker), Goneril\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nPage Number: 4.2-\n\nExplanation and Analysis Albany has realized the deceitful way Regan and Goneril treated Lear. He condemns them, here, for turning against their own father. Shakespeare plays once more with the complex term “nature,” here used to refer to both Goneril’s disposition and to her blood-linked relationship to her father. In the first sense, Goneril’s “nature” means her cruel personality that has acted independently of any filial compassion and thus lashed out brutally against her father. But by selecting the possessive pronoun “its” for “its origin,” Albany implies that nature is inherently linked to the “origin” of one’s parents. Goneril’s actions against her father have thus both been characteristic of her nature but also have betrayed that nature because she “contemns”—sees with contempt—her father. Albany brings these two meanings of nature together in the second line. That something cannot “be bordered certain in itself” means that it cannot have a secure sense of its identity or disposition. That is to say, it is a nature that cannot be sure of its borders and thus can never know just how it will react. Albany implies that turning against one’s heritage is a kind of self-abnegation—a violation of one’s own nature. Thus Shakespeare plays with the dual meaning of nature as identity and origin to differentiate between\n\nthose who value heritage and those who belittle it.\n\nAct 4, scene 6 Quotes\n\n\"How fearful And dizzy tis to cast one's eyes so low! [...] I'll look no more Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight Topple down headlong.\"\n\nRelated Characters: Edgar (speaker), Gloucester\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nPage Number: 4.6-\n\nExplanation and Analysis Edgar wonders how to help his father in his current decrepit state. He pretends, here, to be overlooking an enormous cliff, hoping that Gloucester will ask to be hurled off it. The full effect of this passage is difficult to imagine without the image of the flat stage, but it comes off as somewhat farcical in an actual performance. Choosing words like “fearful” and “dizzy” to describe a flat stage would seem humorous and would allow the audience to comprehend better the metaphorical and literal blindness that is essential to this tragedy. And Edgar’s repeated references to vision—“cast one’s eyes so low” and “deficient sight”—make the irony of the scene entirely evident to the audience. The passage is, however, more than a humorous aside. It also transforms blindness into an odd asset for Gloucester. Edgar is able to set up a fake cliff for Gloucester, where he believes he has attempted to commit suicide and been saved by a miracle. Edgar thus harnesses the very quality in Gloucester that caused him to be treated so terribly—his blindness—and instead turns it into an opportunity for redemption.\n\n\"Gloucester: Oh let me kiss that hand! Lear: Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\"\n\nRelated Characters: Gloucester, King Lear (speaker)\n\nRelated Themes:\n\nPage Number: 4.6-\n\nExplanation and Analysis After Gloucester has survived his fake-suicide, Lear enters the scene. Gloucester asks to greet him royally, but the mad Lear rejects the offer due to an irrational comment on his impending death. Shakespeare places in conversation here two figures who are crippled from proper communication: Gloucester and Lear have both been driven to different forms of disability, with the first being blind and the second being insane. Yet he cleverly inverts their roles in this moment of mis- recognition: this inversion comes through in the way that Gloucester is blind, yet he is able to recognize Lear and thus asks to kiss his hand. Lear, meanwhile, is the blind one in that he does not recognize Gloucester. Indeed, his senses are nonfunctional in that he “smells” his hand incorrectly. The passage also reiterates the way madness is equivalent to philosophical insight. Lear is indeed correct to point out that his hand “smells of mortality,” for all human hands do in a sense. His insanity comes from that exact existential insight, for he applies it indiscriminately to every situation. Thus by staging an interaction between two forms of disability, Shakespeare burlesques the very nature of human interaction—for even when one man overcomes his disability and the other offers a poignant observation, they entirely fail to communicate.\n\nAct 5, scene 3 Quotes\n\n\"No, no, no, no.

Lear instead chooses to idealize their time in prison.

Each icon corresponds to one of the themes explained in the Themes section of this LitChart.\n\nACT 1, SCENE 1\n\nKent and Gloucester are in King Lear's court, discussing Lear's plan to give up his power and divide it among his daughters. Gloucester introduces Kent to his illegitimate son, Edmund, who is standing nearby. Gloucester says that, although Edmund is a \"knave\" (1.1) born out of wedlock, Gloucester loves him no less than the other \"son\" he has \"by order of law\" (1.1) (i., Edgar).\n\nGloucester's words to Kent show that he values his bond with his illegitimate son, despite the fact that a \"natural\" (i. biological) rather than a social or legal order connects them. This conversation looks ahead to the dismembering of the British kingdom by Lear.\n\nLear enters with Albany, Cornwall, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, and their attendants. Having sent Gloucester to fetch Cordelia's suitors, the lords of France and Burgundy, Lear announces that he has divided his kingdom into three parts. He intends to \"shake all cares and business from his age,/ Conferring them on younger strengths\" so that he can \"unburdened crawl toward death\" (1.1-2).\n\nIronically, Lear's authority as king, as the head of a political order, enables him to make the decision that will produce grave disorder. By using the word \"crawl\" to describe his progress toward death, Lear describes the aging human without his former authority as an animal.\n\nNext, Lear calls upon each of his daughters to state how much she loves him. First, Goneril insists that she loves her father \"dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty\" (1.1); Lear awards her one third of his kingdom, accordingly. Then, Regan claims that she loves her father even more than Goneril does; she is an \"enemy to all other joys\" but his \"dear Highness' love\" (1.1-4). Lear grants her a third, in turn.\n\nThe ceremony Lear has devised to make himself feel good also reinforces the plays theme of the connections between the \"public\" authority of Lear as a king and his \"private\" authority over his daughters as a father.\n\nWhile her sisters speak, Cordelia grows nervous, knowing that she would prefer to \"love, and be silent\" (1.1) than to make such a public declaration of her love for her father. And, indeed, when her turn comes to speak, Cordelia can answer only \"Nothing, my lord\" (1.1). Lear presses her to give another answer, but she insists that she loves him \"according to [her] bond, no more, no less\" (1.1).\n\nRefusing to go along with Lear's political theater, Cordelia stresses the importance of her inward bond. Her answer, \"nothing,\" will echo throughout the play. Here it anticipates the way in which the dismembering of the kingdom will lead to ruin, chaos, and annihilation.\n\nEnraged by this refusal to play along, and vowing by \"all the operation of the orbs\" (1.1), Lear renounces his \"paternal care\" of Cordelia forever (1.1). When Kent attempts to intercede on Cordelia's behalf, Lear reiterates: \"here I give/ her father's heart from her\" (1.1-2). He states that he will from now on alternate months living with his two other daughters, keeping only 100 knights on reserve to be his followers. When Kent continues to counsel him against such a rash decision, Lear banishes him on pain of death: \"out of my sight!\" (1.1). Having consoled Cordelia, and exhorted Goneril and Regan to live up to their declarations of love, Kent departs.\n\nLear invokes the heavens as a symbol of order and justice for the first of many times throughout the play. Kent, meanwhile, shows a personal devotion to Lear that is so strong that he is willing to step outside of the usual political order (i., the rules of the court) in order to try to protext his king. More insightful than Lear, Kent knows that dividing the kingdom is a bad idea; he also sees Goneril and Regan for the opportunists they are.\n\nSUMMARY AND ANALSUMMARY AND ANALYSISYSIS\n\n©2020 LitCharts LLC LitCharts Page 16\n\nGloucester returns with France and Burgundy. Lear addresses Burgundy first, telling him that Cordelia has been disowned. Cordelia interrupts, begging her father to explain that she has not done anything wrong: her only sin is to lack a \"still-soliciting eye and such a tongue\" (1.1) as her sisters. Burgundy asks, won't Lear give the dowry he proposed? Lear replies that he will give \"nothing\" (1.1). Then, Burgundy apologizes, he cannot marry Cordelia. France, however, says that the neglect of the gods has only increased his love: he pronounces Cordelia his wife and queen. Lear accepts and exits with his attendants.\n\nBurgundy's reaction to Lear's declaration reflects that authority and order, political and economic calculations, also govern marriage, however, like Cordelia herself, seems to have private, purer motivations.\n\nCordelia then takes leave of Goneril and Regan, saying she knows their faults, but hopes that they will live up to the love they have declared. Cordelia and France leave. Left alone, Goneril observes that Lear's old age is \"full of changes\" (334) and that he showed \"poor judgment\" (337) casting off Cordelia. Regan agrees the \"infirmity of his age\" (339) is to blame for his error. Goneril says that in these \"infirm and choleric years\" (345) they cannot permit their father to exercise any real authority.\n\nCruelly criticizing their father's senility, the sisters show their true colors for the first time, foreshadowing all the abuses that they will soon wreak on him due to his age. Like Kent, they also describe what Lear has done as an error. But they, unlike Kent, plan to take advantage of it, and show more interest in power than in the love they owe their father simply because he is their father.\n\nACT 1, SCENE 2\n\nEdmund stands alone on stage, criticizing the injustice of the laws and customs that deprive him of all legal rights just because he was born out of wedlock. Therefore, Edmund says, rather than law he worships \"Nature\" (1.2). Then, holding up a letter he has forged, Edmund explains to the audience that he is plotting to steal the land of his half-brother, \"legitimate Edgar\" (1.2), by winning all his father, Gloucester's, affection.\n\nEdmund, criticizing official legal order as unjust, decides to follow a more brutal \"win or lose\" natural order instead. At this point, a modern reader might be sympathetic to Edmund: it's not his fault he was born out of wedlock. The Edmund/Edgar sibling rivalry for paternal favor mirrors that between Lear's daughters.\n\nAs Gloucester returns from Lear's court, baffled by the events there, Edmund conspicuously hides the letter in his pocket. When Gloucester asks what it is, Edmund replies \"no news [...] nothing\" (1.2-3). Gloucester cheerfully demands to see it: \"the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself [...] if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles\" (1.2-7).\n\nThe word, \"nothing,\" repeated by Cordelia and Lear throughout 1, continues its echo here. Quickly falling for Edmund's tricks to turn him against his legitimate son, Gloucester displays a shortsightedness that matches Lear's own misjudgment of his daughter's.\n\nFeigning hesitation, Edmund hands over the letter, explaining that Edgar sent it to him. Gloucester reads it aloud. The letter argues against the \"aged tyranny\" (1.2) that keeps sons enslaved to fathers past their prime. It goes on to hint that if Edmund will help Edgar dispose of Gloucester, Edgar will grant the bastard half of his legitimate wealth. Edmund adds that Edgar has often said that, with \"sons at perfect age and fathers declined\" (76-7), sons should take care of fathers as their wards.\n\nIn his forged letter, Edmund uses the kinds of criticisms of age that Goneril and Regan cited at the end of 1—and which, indeed, motivated Lear to give up his own power—to play on Gloucester's own anxieties and turn him against his other son.\n\n©2020 LitCharts LLC LitCharts Page 17\n\nGoneril adds that if Lear does not like what she says, he can go to Regan. She knows that she and her sister are of the same mind on this subject and will not be overruled by an \"idle old man\" (1.3). \"Old fools are babes again and must be used/ With checks as flatteries\" (20-1), she concludes, resolving to write to her sister.\n\nGoneril speaks about the old, and how they should be subservient to the young, in the same terms that Edmund cited in his forged letter. For the time being, she show solidarity with her sister.\n\nACT 1, SCENE 4\n\nKent returns in the disguise of Caius, a commoner, to offer his services to Lear. Lear accepts. He sends Kent to fetch his Fool.\n\nAs in 1, Kent demonstrates his deep loyalty to Lear's authority, which empowers him to go outside of the usual order of political business. Lear's failure to recognize Kent in his disguise provides a dramatic metaphor for his failure to see his daughters' true colors.\n\nSeeing Oswald, Lear attempts to summon him, but Oswald ignores him. Irritated, Lear sends a Knight to call Oswald back. The Knight returns with the message that Goneril is not well and that Oswald refuses to obey Lear—the Knight thinks that Lear has been \"wronged\" (66). Lear sends the Knight to fetch his Fool. Both Knight and Lear observe that since Cordelia's departure for France the Fool has been melancholy and sad. Oswald enters again. Lear summons him and demands to know who he is. When Oswald replies, \"my lady's father\" (1.4), Lear grows enraged, calling him a \"dog,\" \"slave\" and \"cur\" (81), and hitting him. Kent joins in tripping Oswald.\n\nLear's demand to have Oswald acknowledge who he is—that is, the king (or former king)—draws attention to the fact that sight and recognition are part of authority and order, insofar as the leader and the subject must see and acknowledge each other for what they are if the system is to function. Lear's treatment in Goneril's house violates both the private respect she as a child owes her parent and the traditional order of official hospitality.\n\nThe Fool enters. He tells Lear to wear his (the Fool's) coxcomb (or fool's hat). He continues to tease Lear, who finally asks whether the Fool is calling him a Fool. The Fool replies that indeed he is: \"all thy other titles thou has given away. That thou wast born with\" (152-4). The Fool continues to mock Lear, saying that Lear is worth even less than he is: \"I had rather be any kind of thing than a Fool. And yet I would not be thee [...] I am a Fool. Thou art nothing\" (189-99).\n\nTraditionally, the Fool had the unique privilege of stepping outside of, and even inverting, the order of the court by criticizing the King. Speaking in mad, riddling language, the Fool makes insightful comments about Lear's diminished condition. The Fool's use of the word \"nothing,\" echoing Lear, Cordelia, and Gloucester, stresses that Lear has destroyed himself in the process of dividing his kingdom.\n\n©2020 LitCharts LLC LitCharts Page 19\n\nAt this point, Goneril storms on stage, irritated. She blows up at Lear, criticizing the Fool and all of Lear's knights for disturbing the peace in her house. Goneril scolds Lear, telling him he must return to his usual self. Lear, incredulous, jokingly demands whether anyone present recognizes him (i., as their former king). \"Who is it that can tell me who I am\" (1.4) But Goneril cuts him off, demanding that he reduce the number of knights with him from 100 to 50. Lear flies into a rage cursing her as a detested kite\" (or bird of prey; 1.4) and pleading the gods either make her infertile or to send her a \"child of spleen\" (296) so that she herself can know \"how sharper than the serpent's tooth it is/ to have a thankless child\" (302-3). Lear and his knights exit, preparing to depart for Regan's house. As they go, Lear tries, in vain, to stop crying at the loss of his daughter: \"Old fond eyes,/ Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck you out\" (317-8). Lear shouts that when Regan hears of Goneril's unkindness she'll \"flay\" Goneril's \"wolvish visage\" (325). He rushes out.\n\nLear seems to think that he was king by virtue of being himself, rather than by virtue of his power, and that therefore he could give up power but still demand respect. Now he is discovering that in giving up power he has given up his former identity. Lear curses Goneril using animal terms (\"kite,\" \"serpent's tooth,\" \"wolvish visage\"). The implication in Lear's use of these insults is that Goneril is an animal because, like an animal, she lacks the tender familial bonds of love that make humans unique. The fact that his curse focuses specifically on the idea that Goneril be without children—or, like him, have only thankless children—stresses how hurt and angered he is by his daughters' ingratitude.\n\nAs Lear departs, Albany enters, tentatively criticizing the lack of hospitality that Goneril has shown to her father. Goneril cuts him off. She summons Oswald, double-checks that he has written a letter to Regan, as she instructed, and orders him to bring it to Regan quickly. Then she turns back to her husband, telling him that he is foolish to be so gentle. Albany remains dubious: \"How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell./ Striving to better, oft we mar what's well\" (368-9)\n\nAlthough Albany is bound to Goneril through the laws and customs of marriage, and his political power depends on her, Albany's clear vision of her cruelty to her father starts to drive him away from her. Their opposing viewpoints on the treatment of Lear, among other things, will break their marriage by play's end.\n\nACT 1, SCENE 5\n\nLear explains what happened with Goneril to Kent (who is still disguised as Cauis), and then sends Kent to deliver a letter to Regan. Assuring Lear that he will not sleep until he has delivered the message, Kent speeds off.\n\nKent continues to show exemplary loyalty to Lear (though he has to maintain the disguise of Caius in order to do so).\n\nAs he prepares to head for Regan's castle himself, Lear is teased by his Fool, who predicts that Regan will be as like Goneril as \"a crab [...] to a crab\" (1.5). Meanwhile, Lear begins to rave, fearing that he will go mad at the \"monster ingratitude\" (1.5) that Goneril has shown him. As the Fool persists telling Lear \"thou wouldst make a good Fool\" (1.5), Lear begs: \"Sweet heaven!/ Keep me in temper. I would not be mad!\" (1.5).\n\nThe Fool also continues with the kinds of animal metaphors that Lear introduced in his curse of Goneril. Lear, meanwhile, having realizing that in giving up power he has lost his identity as king, calls out to the even higher power of heaven to help him, as he fears that in losing his identity he may fall into the chaos of madness.\n\n©2020 LitCharts LLC LitCharts Page 20"
