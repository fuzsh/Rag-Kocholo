        "text": "KENT\n\nMy lord, when at their home I did commend your highness' letters to them. Ere I was risen from the place that showed My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post, Stewed in his haste, half breathless, panting forth From Goneril his mistress salutations, Delivered letters spite of intermission, Which presently they read, on whose contents They summoned up their meiny, straight took horse, Commanded me to follow and attend The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks. And meeting here the other messenger, Whose welcome I perceived had poisoned mine— Being the very fellow which of late Displayed so saucily against your highness— Having more man than wit about me, drew. He raised the house with loud and coward cries. Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers.\n\nKENT\n\nMy lord, I arrived at your son-in-law and daughter's home and delivered your Highness's letter. But before I had risen from my respectful kneeling position, a stinking messenger arrived, out of breath and panting out greetings from his mistress Goneril. He didn't care at all about interrupting me, and he presented a letter from his lady, which they read immediately. Once they understood its contents, they summoned their servants and got on their horses to ride off straight away. They commanded me to follow them if I wanted the pleasure of getting their answer, and they glared at me coldly. Once we got here, I met that other messenger again, the rude one whom they welcomed while scorning me—and he was the very same fellow who was so insolent to you recently, your Highness. I had more anger than intelligence in me, so I drew my sword against him. He then woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly cries. Your son-in-law and daughter decided that my error deserves this punishment of being locked so shamefully in the stocks here.\n\nFOOL\n\nIf your daughter Regan and Cornwall are acting like that, then your troubles aren't over yet. Fathers who wear rags make their children blind to their needs. But fathers with bags of gold make their children kind. Fortune, that fickle whore, never opens the door to the poor. But despite all this, your daughters will give you as many dollars—or maybe sorrows—as you can count in a whole year.\n\nFOOL\n\nWe’ll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there’s no laboring i' th' winter. All that follow theirnoses are led by their eyes but blind men, and there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that’s stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down ahill, lest it break thy neck with following it. But thegreat one that goes up the hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again. I would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it. That sir which serves and seeks for gain, And follows but for form, Will pack when it begins to rain And leave thee in the storm. But I will tarry. The fool will stay. And let the wise man fly. The knave turns fool that runs away; The fool, no knave, perdie.\n\nFOOL\n\nYou should learn from the ant that there's no use in working in the winter—no one will work for a master who can't pay them. Everyone but the blind can see that the king has fallen on bad luck, and even the blind can smell his decaying fortunes. If a huge wheel goes rolling down a hill, don't try to cling to it, or else you'll break your neck. But if you see a wheel going up the hill, let it pull you up after it. When a wise man gives you better advice than this, give me my advice back. I'm a fool dispensing advice, so I want only scoundrels taking it. The man who works only for profit, and puts on a show of loyalty, will pack up when it starts to rain and leave you in the storm. But I will stay. The fool will stay. And let the wise man flee. The servant who runs away becomes a fool, but this fool is no scoundrel, so help me God.\n\nLEAR\n\nThe king would speak with Cornwall. The dear father Would with his daughter speak, commands, tends service. Are they “informed” of this? My breath and blood! “Fiery?” The “fiery” duke? Tell the hot duke that Lear— No, but not yet. Maybe he is not well. Infirmity doth still neglect all office Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves When nature, being oppressed, commands the mind To suffer with the body. I’ll forbear, And am fallen out with my more headier will To take the indisposed and sickly fit For the sound man. [notices KENT again] Death on my state! Wherefore Should he sit here? This act persuades me That this remotion of the duke and her Is practice only. Give me my servant forth. Go tell the duke and ’s wife I’d speak with them— Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me, Or at their chamber door I’ll beat the drum Till it cry sleep to death.\n\nLEAR\n\nThe king wants to speak with Cornwall. The dear father wants to speak with his daughter. He commands that she attend to him. Are they \"informed\" of this? By my breath and blood! \"Fiery?\" The \"fiery\" duke? Well tell that hot-headed duke that Lear . . . But no, not yet. Maybe he's sick. Sickness can make us forget the duties that we owe when we're healthy. We're not ourselves when illness makes our minds suffer along with our bodies. I'll restrain my rage, and fight against my fickle temper, which makes me want to judge a sick man like a healthy one. [He notices KENT again] A curse on my kingship! Why should Kent be locked up here? His punishment persuades me that the duke and Regan's refusal to see me is just trickery. Have my servant released. Go tell the duke and his wife that I will speak with them—now, immediately. Tell them to come out and listen to me, or else I'll beat a drum outside their bedroom door until they have to wake up.\n\nLEAR\n\nNo, Regan, I'll never curse you. Your tender nature will never turn harsh and cruel. Her eyes are fierce and vicious, but yours are comforting. You would never deny me my pleasures, dismiss my knights, thoughtlessly insult me, reduce my privileges, or lock the door against me. You know better than she does the natural duties of a child to a parent, the politeness and love that comes with gratitude. You haven't forgotten your half of the kingdom that I gave you.\n\nLEAR\n\nWho put my servant in the stocks? Regan, I hope you didn't know anything about it. Who's coming? Oh, gods, if you love old men and approve of children being obedient to their parents—if you yourselves are old—then take my side. Hurl down a lightning bolt for my cause!\n\n[To GONERIL] Aren't you ashamed to look at me, after you've abused me so badly in my old age?\n\n[To REGAN] Oh, Regan, are you really taking her by the hand?\n\nLEAR\n\nReturn to her, and fifty men dismissed? No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose To be a comrade with the wolf and owl— To wage against the enmity o' th' air— Necessity’s sharp pinch! Return with her? Why, the hot-blooded France that dowerless took Our youngest born— I could as well be brought To knee his throne, and, squirelike, pension beg To keep base life afoot. Return with her? Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter To this detested groom. [indicates OSWALD ]\n\nLEAR\n\nReturn to her, and dismiss fifty knights? No, I would rather refuse to live under any roof at all, and choose to live as a comrade of the wolf and the owl—fighting against the harshness of the open air, and living with the sharp pinch of poverty! Return with her? Why, it would be better for me to visit the hot-blooded King of France— who took my youngest daughter without a dowry—kneel before his throne, and beg like a servant that he should give me a pension to support my worthless life. Return with her? I'd rather be a scoundrel and a packhorse to this detestable stablehand here! [He points to OSWALD]\n\nLEAR\n\nNow, I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad. I will not trouble thee, my child. Farewell. We’ll no more meet, no more see one another. But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter— Or rather a disease that’s in my flesh, Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil, A plague-sore or embossèd carbuncle In my corrupted blood. But I’ll not chide thee. Let shame come when it will. I do not call it. I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot, Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove. Mend when thou canst. Be better at thy leisure. I can be patient. I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights.\n\nLEAR\n\nNo, please, daughter, don't make me go crazy. I won't bother you, my child. Farewell. We'll never meet or see each other again. But you're still my child, my daughter, my flesh and blood—or rather you're a disease that's in my flesh, which is still technically my \"flesh and blood.\" You're a pimple, a sore, a raised tumor corrupting my blood. But I won't criticize you. Shame will come to you when it decides to. I won't encourage it now. I won't ask the gods to smite you with lightning, or complain about you to them. Mend your ways if you can. Better yourself at your leisure. I can be patient. I can stay with Regan, along with my hundred knights.\n\nLEAR\n\nO, reason not the need! Our basest beggars Are in the poorest thing superfluous. Allow not nature more than nature needs, Man’s life’s as cheap as beast’s. Thou art a lady. If only to go warm were gorgeous, Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st, Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need— You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need. You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, As full of grief as age, wretched in both. If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts Against their father, fool me not so much To bear it tamely. Touch me with noble anger. And let not women’s weapons, water drops, Stain my man’s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags, I will have such revenges on you both That all the world shall— I will do such things— What they are yet I know not, but they shall be The terrors of the earth. You think I’ll weep? No, I’ll not weep.\n\nLEAR\n\nOh, don't be so logical about needs! Even the poorest beggars have at least something they don't need. If you only allow people to have what they need to survive, then a man's life becomes as cheap as an animal's. You are a fashionable lady. If you dressed only to stay warm, then you wouldn't need the gorgeous clothes you're wearing, as they hardly keep you warm at all. But as for my true needs—may the heavens give me endurance, the endurance that I need. You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, as wretched in his grief as he is in his frailty. If it's you who inspire these daughters to turn against their father, then at least don't make me such a fool as to take their insolence without protesting. Give me noble anger, and don't let any womanly tears stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags, I'll have such a revenge on you both that the whole world will . . . I'll do such things . . . I don't know what things I'll do yet, but they will be terrible. You think I'll weep? No, I won't weep."
