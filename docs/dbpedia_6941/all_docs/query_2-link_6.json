        "text": "Yuwen Hsiung presents in her paper, Kurosawa\\u27s Throne of Blood and East Asia\\u27s Macbeth, a comparative study between Kurosawa\\u27s film Throne of Blood and a contemporary Taiwanese play, Kingdom of Desire, both of which are adaptations of Shakespeare\\u27s Macbeth. Stepping from Eastern cultural background, both show similar orientation towards the original play, for instance the sizing down of the number of witches and the decreasing of Macbeth\\u27s heroic status. Gilles Deleuze\\u27s theory of movement image provides an insightful look into Kurosawa\\u27s filmology, which emphasizes the interrelatedness of every individual under the same condition. The idea of collectivity could be examined in two ways, diachronically and synchronically: Kingdom of Desire, although it resembles Throne of Blood in terms of plot, brings our attention back to individuality by focusing on the transformation of the protagonist. Macbeth, the character, would never appeal to the traditional Chinese the...\n\nIt can be argued that for the last two decades Japan has gone through a radical transformation making the country a stage for various masculine performances. The footprints of these transformation can also be observed through media representations. Within this context the aim of the article is to elaborate the masculine identity constructed through Sakamoto Ryōma in the historical drama Ryōmaden broadcasted in the year 2010 by the Japanese national channel. By giving several examples from the scenes focusing on the character traits of the protogonist, the type of masculinity which is thought to be idealised by means of an updated version of Sakamoto Ryōma will try to be highlighted. Within the popular history, Sakamoto Ryōma is known to be one of the architects of the Meiji Restoration. Although he could not live to see the Reformation itself his contributions did not go unnoticed. The latest version of these character who have already inspired several novel, anime and manga overlaps with the historically glorified masculin identity. On the other hand it can be noticed that the image itself differentiates from the iconic images of the previous decades. By creating a sympathic samurai who reverse the Japanese autocratic masculine image; the series not only refresh the social memory but also put into circulation a new masculine image.\n\nHakuchi, Kurosawa Akira’s 1951 film adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky’s novel The Idiot, finds its proper historical context in post-World War II cultural criticism. In this period an interest in Dostoevsky was shared by many artists and intellectuals who sought the larger cultural causes of the catastrophe that had involved all industrial nations. Kurosawa’s turn to Dostoevsky contributes a Japanese variant to the series of ethical revisions of modernism attempted in Europe by such artists and thinkers as Thomas Mann, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Mikhail Bakhtin. For them Dostoevsky represented an alternative model for an ethically differentiated collective consciousness, in opposition to the now discredited father of modernism, Friedrich Nietzsche. Through a reading of the film’s crucial scenes and motifs, Kurosawa’s cinematic mediation between the West and the East is shown to have started from the shared premises of the ethically revised modernism that emerged from the wartime trauma."
