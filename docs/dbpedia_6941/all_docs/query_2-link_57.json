A recurring character throughout Season 2 of The Bear, her performance had viewers glued to their screens.\n\nRELATED: Oliver Platt's Career, Including Chicago Med and The Bear\n\nBefore time on The Bear, Ramos first skyrocketed to fame as a young actress in the NBC drama American Dreams, which ran from 2002 to 2005. She played Patty Pryor, a petulant child who served up endless sass in each episode. The role earned Ramos three Young Artist Award nominations and helped cement her as a primetime star.\n\nMany came to know Ramos as teenager Haddie in NBC's Parenthood. Ramos was a Parenthood scene-stealer for all five seasons of the family drama, scoring two Supporting Actress ALMA Award nominations for her role on the show.\n\nBefore Parenthood, Ramos guest starred in several notable television programs, such as Scrubs (2005), Wizards of Waverly Place (2008), and Ghost Whisperer (2009).\n\nUnsurprisingly, Chicago Med won't be Ramos' first time working with primetime titan Dick Wolf: She guest starred in Law & Order Season 17, Episode 17 (\"Good Faith\") in 2007. She played Mary Reese, a Catholic school student who was sexually abused.\n\nRELATED: E.R.

Ramos was also in the sports drama Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's former partner, Cheryl Pistono; the ensemble cast including Solomon Hughes, John C. Reilly, Jason Segel, and Adrien Brody.\n\nRamos made her big-screen debut in 2012 in Mark Webber's The End of Love, starring opposite Michael Cera. The same year, she starred alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Melissa Leo, and 30 Rock's Tracy Morgan in the comedy flick Why Stop Now.\n\nIn 2016, Ramos shined as Michelle in the rom-com How to Be Single and as Marin in the comedy film Slash.\n\nShe joined Catherine Keener, Riley Keough, Cary Elwes, Anton Yelchin, and SNL stars Maya Rudolph and Molly Shannon in the 2017 thriller We Don't Belong Here.\n\nHer other notable film roles include 2017's The Boy Downstairs as Jane and 2018's Ask for Jane as Maggie.\n\nShe was also among the star-studded ensemble of 2022's historical epic Babylon, playing Harriet Rothschild opposite Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt in the blood-pumping drama chronicling Hollywood's transition from silent film to the \"talkies.\"\n\nRamos has also starred in a couple of Hallmark Christmas films: 2022's A Kismet Christmas and 2023's Christmas in Notting Hill."
