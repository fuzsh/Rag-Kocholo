        "text": "A specially commissioned audio version of PACE’s re-enactment of the Sma’ Shot story, which tells the story of the historic victory won by the Paisley weavers in the mid-1800s. Featuring members of PACE Youth Theatre, all parts were recorded in isolation during lockdown in June 2020. Sma’ Shot Day is an annual festival, held in Paisley on the 1st Saturday in July.\n\nCAST LIST\n\nSpirits/Storytellers\n\nSpirit of Jo – Craig Binning\n\nSpirit of William – Patrick Doherty\n\nSpirit of Nancy – Anna Horsborough\n\nSpirit of Liz – Katherine Wilson\n\nWeavers\n\nJo – Kai Ross\n\nWilliam – Euan Menzies\n\nNancy – Amy Gallagher\n\nLiz – Neve Ferguson\n\nJohn – Angus Bryans\n\nJean – Lucy Halliday\n\nCorks\n\nMaggie – Carla McPherson\n\nHead Cork/Maggie’s Father – JJ Hay\n\nSarah – Anna Bolton-Jones\n\nKim – Kathleen Irvine\n\nCathy – Molly Mae Paterson\n\nProduced by Alan Orr, featuring original music by Alan Orr & David Ramsay.\n\nThis is the first in a series of online yoga sessions, led by Sarah Haddath. Sarah trained at The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland has been working as a singer and actress for the last 7 years. Throughout her training and career she has been a yoga student and teacher. She primarily teaches Vinyasa Flow and Yin.\n\nYoga is a great compliment to any of the performing arts as it helps us with body awareness, mindfulness, breath control, fitness, grounding, stress relief, self discipline… the list goes on!\n\nThese videos aim to give you the space and time in the day to focus on yourself. Maybe you will learn something new about your body’s anatomy; maybe you will discover you are really good at balance postures (or not!); maybe you will simply find you are a little more relaxed after the class; whatever it is just enjoy it – it’s only yoga after all.\n\nEpisode 1 of 6 in a series of podcasts exploring monologues, focussing particularly on pieces suitable for young people. Each week, explore different approaches to working on specific texts, completing a series of tasks. Each week, establish the context of the monologue texts, then be guided through a series of appropriate exercises. Build up a toolkit of techniques and approaches an actor could choose between or use in tandem. Presented by Tom Cooper.\n\nTom is a director and teacher based in Glasgow. He has worked all over the UK on new plays, Shakespeare, devised work, musical theatre and opera. He has taught for London College of Music, the National Youth Theatre and Oxford School of Drama. For the last two years Tom has been part of the team of Short Courses tutors at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. He has led intensive weekend courses on acting and contemporary text, and a regular Saturday morning group focussed on devising.\n\nIn this episode, we explore two monologues from Too Fast by Douglas Maxwell."
