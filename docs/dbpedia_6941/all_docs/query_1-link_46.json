        "text": "Lawrence Olivier (BBC)\n\nLink to full production\n\nNote: This production is generally suitable for most audiences\n\n1994 - John Gielgud/Kenneth Branagh\n\nBBC/Renaissance Theatre\n\nLink to full production\n\nNOTE: This is an audio production.\n\n​\n\n1998 - Ian Holm (Lear)\n\nDirected by: Richard Eyre\n\nThis Lear is a stripped-down, stark production with a timeless setting--we could be anytime in the future or the past--and focuses intensely on the words rather than on the sets.\n\nNOTE: There is full nudity in this film from the Lear character However, it is in a long shot in the dark and it is (intentionally) difficult to see.\n\n​​\n\n​\n\n2018- Anthony Hopkins (Lear)\n\nWith Emma Thompson, Florence Pugh, and Emily Watson\n\n​\n\nStrong performances from all actors in this modern-setting Lear. WARNING: This production clearly hints at an abusive relationship between Lear and his elder daughters, especially Goneril.\n\nAkira Kurosawa, Ran\n\nThis outstanding production sets Lear in feudal Japan. Kurosawa's adaptation of this play is a fascinating meld of Shakespeare and Japanese culture, and it works brilliantly. The cinematography is unforgettable.\n\nNote: This film is rated R.\n\nDiscussion Questions (Film)\n\nWhat are the advantages of updating Lear to a modern setting, as in the National Theatre version or the Hopkins production?\n\nIn the National Theatre version, the actor playing Goneril has clearly chosen to characterize Goneril as openly playing up the \"daddy's girl\" relationship with her father. In what way does this choice illuminate the relationship between Lear and Goneril? Between Goneril and Cordelia? Between Goneril and Regan?\n\n\"DIVIDE WE OUR KINGDOM\": CHARACTERIZATION AND MOTIVE\n\nWhy does Lear choose to break up his kingdom? How does this reflect on Lear's competence as a leader?\n\nWhat did Cordelia mean by loving her father \"according to [her] bond\"? Why does she argue it would be inappropriate to love her father any other way?\n\n​In addition to introducing Lear and his daughters, we also get Gloucester and Edmund. In what way do these two men demonstrate failure as fathers?​\n\nIs this opening scene suggesting that love cannot co-exist with honesty?\n\nCAIUS AND MAD TOM: MOTIFS // DISGUISE, MADNESS, AND BLINDNESS\n\nIn scene 4, Kent disguises himself as Caius, an old commoner. In a parallel scene, we will see Edgar disguise himself as Mad Tom. In both cases, these men are not recognized by their \"fathers\" (Lear and Gloucester, respectively). Why does Lear not recognize Kent? Why does Gloucester not recognize Edgar?​\n\n​\"NATURE IN YOU\": MOTIFS // \"NATURAL\" BEHAVIOR AND \"NATURE\"\n\n​​O, sir, you are old / Nature in you stands on the very verge / Of her confine: You should be ruled and led /By some discretion that discerns your state / Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you / That to our sister you do make return. /Say you have wronged her, sir.\n\nConsider Regan's rhetorical \"moves\" here. How does her speech systematically belittle Lear? On what grounds is she essentially arguing that he is incapable? How does Regan's statement subvert BOTH the father/daughter and king/subject relationship?\n\n​\n\nCHARACTERIZATION AND MOTIVE // KNEELING\n\n​During this same conversation, Lear kneels to his daughters.\n\n​What is the meaning of this gesture? Is it sincere or is it meant sarcastically?\n\nWhat does this gesture -- even if it is sarcastic -- do for Lear? Does it accomplish his goal?\n\n​What does it do for the audience's sympathies or feelings to Lear? Do we respect him? Sympathize? Despise him?\n\nHow would the Elizabethans (and modern-day audiences) perceive the \"natural\"-ness of this gesture?​\n\n\"A DISEASE, A CARBUNCLE\" // REPULSION AND MISOGYNY\n\nHow is Lear's anger toward Goneril different from the anger he directs against Regan? What terms or ideas does he use with one sister but not with both? What does Lear's anger and its manifestations suggests about their relationship?\n\nWhich characters are acting \"unnaturally\"? What does it mean to act according to one's nature?\n\nWhy is Lear so revulsed by the female form?\n\nWhy does Lear curse Goneril's reproductive capacity, calling on the Gods by saying \"into her womb convey sterility\"?\n\n​By referring to her as a disease in his own blood and flesh, is Lear admitting to some degree of responsibility in shaping Goneril's character?\n\nPerformance Questions\n\nThe \"I gave you all\" exchange in the Hopkins version is notably restrained. What was gained (and lost) by this choice?\n\nThe James Earl Jones production, in marked contrast to the Ian McKellen performance (beginning at 4:16 in the \"Fifteen Minutes of Amazing Lear Performances\" video above) and the Lawrence Oliver performance (beginnign 12:50), features a Lear who is raging and physically powerful in contrast to the more frail and aged appearances of McKellen and Olivier. What difference did this degree of physical strength or capability make in the perception of Lear's character? Of his previous relationships with his daughters?​ ​\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\n\"EDGAR I NOTHING AM\": MOTIFS // DISGUISE, MADNESS, AND BLINDNESS​\n\nIn the Elizabethan era, and in much of Europe until the 20th century, mental illness especially among the poor was disregarded and dismissed: homeless people who suffered from mental illness existed on the fringes of society. We have seen other characters (Kent) disguise themselves as commoners, but disguising oneself as a homeless person with mental illness is an even more extreme form of disguise. Why, of all roles, does Edgar choose this one?\n\n​\n\n\"MAN'S LIFE'S AS CHEAP AS BEAST'S\" // THEME\n\n​One question this play asks and forces us to confront is a very simple one: What do we need?\n\n​What do we need to be considered human? Lear argues that if people ONLY had what they strictly \"need,\" then our lives would be \"as cheap as beast's\" -- that is, we'd be little better than animals just simply existing with basic food, clothing, and shelter.\n\nDoes Lear need to be a king? Although it's easy to despise Goneril and Regan, they have a point about the hundred knights: They're a rowdy and ungovernable bunch, and a genuine household management problem. Goneril is right when she points out that her own servants can serve Lear, and if there's a problem, she can deal with them. However, Lear cries out, \"O, reason not the need!\" when his daughters ask him what he even needs with one retainer in his entourage, and most audiences -- at least in this moment -- tend to sympathize with the king.\n\n​Does Lear really need an entourage?\n\nShould he have one whether he needs it or not?\n\nOn a psychological level, why does Lear need his retainers?\n\n​Without our own \"lendings\" -- our clothes, jobs, houses, cars, whatever we have that (to us) gives us value and identity, who are we?\n\nLear in the Storm\n\n\"BLOW, WINDS!\" // CHARACTERIZATION AND COMPLEXITY:\n\nIt is absolutely easy to condemn the decision of Goneril and Regan to allow their eighty-year-old father to leave in the middle of the night into a storm. However, they are correct in arguing that this is his choice. What is Shakespeare's purpose in giving his audience a logical reason to sympathize with Regan and Goneril here?\n\n​\n\nTHE STORM // SETTING\n\nWhat is Shakespeare's thematic or symbolic purpose in setting most of Act III in a storm?\n\nThe storm scene is one of the most famous in Shakespeare, and it represents not only a reflection of the turbulence in Lear's own mind, but a point of transformation for this character. Isolate one line in the storm scene which you believe indicates a change of character in Lear.\n\n​\n\nTHE STORM // CHARACTERIZATION AND MOTIVE\n\nWhy does Lear leave into the storm? Is it self-pity? Is he trying to kill himself? What are some possible goals or motives he has for this decision?\n\n\"HOW DOST MY BOY? ART COLD?\" // CHARACTERIZATION AND COMPLEXITY\n\n​A surprising moment in this scene occurs when Lear turns to the Fool and says, \"How dost my boy? Art cold?\" Why is this line generally considered to be a crucial turning point for Lear's character? What does this line suggest about how Lear has changed since the beginning of the play? What has changed him?\n\nNote: Some questions were taken or adapted from this site.\n\nQuestions\n\n\"TA'EN TOO LITTLE CARE OF THIS!\" AUTHOR PURPOSE/CHARACTERIZATION\n\n​The Hopkins version staged the hovel scene in a refugee or homeless encampment, a choice supported by the text when Lear states, \"You houseless poverty!...Poor, naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are/How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides...defend you from seasons such as these?\" He then adds, \"O, I have ta'en /Too little care of this!\" (III.iv.24-33) Why did Shakespeare include this line? What was his purpose in having Lear say this? What does it reveal about Lear at this point in the play?\n\n​\n\nLEAR AND TOM // CHARACTERIZATION AND COMPLEXITY\n\n​When Lear first meets Mad Tom, why does he automatically assume that Tom has \"come to this\" because he has given away everything to his daughters?\n\n\"IS MAN NO MORE THAN THIS?\" AUTHOR PURPOSE/CHARACTERIZATION AND COMPLEXITY//THEME\n\n​On seeing the nearly naked figure of Tom, Lear asks, \"Is man no more than this?\" Why did Shakespeare include this line? What was his purpose in having Lear say this? What does it reveal about Lear at this point in the play? How does this line represent a progression from the earlier line, \"O, I have ta'en /Too little care of this\"?\n\nPRODUCTION. In the Ian Holm production, the actor playing Edgar/Tom is positioned on top of a platform, a sheet or cloth wrapped around his hips and his arms outstretched in a posture intended to allude to the Crucifixion. Why did the director (Richard Eyre) choose this staging for this moment? What is the point Eyre is stressing here? How does it connect to the larger message of the play (and what is that larger message)?\n\n​\n\n\"OFF, YOU LENDINGS!\" // AUTHOR PURPOSE//CHARACTERIZATION AND COMPLEXITY//THEME\n\nWhy does Shakespeare have Lear remove all or part of his clothing? What is the purpose beyond showing Lear as losing his mind?\n\nOVERALL\n\nIn the storm, we see Lear's mental and emotional state degrade seriously as he confronts the elements, his own age, and the fact of his daughters' betrayal. At the same time, the storm scene also provides him with crucial insights about himself, his treatment of others, his lack of empathy before that point, and his larger failures to be responsible both as a father and as a king to protect people from harm or danger. Why are these two moments -- insanity and self-realization--occurring at the same time? Is Shakespeare suggesting they are essentially the same thing? What are the implications of that choice?\n\nGloucester's Blinding\n\n​\n\n\"OUT, VILE JELLY\" // AUTHOR PURPOSE//THEME // CHARACTERIZATION\n\n​How did Shakespeare's choice to blind Gloucester advance the theme of this play? In short, how did this blinding help Shakespeare convey his message (and what WAS that message)?\n\nWhy did Regan and her husband not just kill Gloucester outright for siding with Cordelia and hiding Lear?\n\nThis scene is notable for two things (among others): its drawn-out cruelty and viciousness, and the fact that this double exoculation is done right there onstage. Why? Why did Shakespeare choose to dramatize this act and not have it take place offstage, as would have been more conventional?\n\nDuring the scene, a soldier not only revolts against his lord, but actually stabs him to death. Why did Shakespeare include this scene? In what way does it serve the theme or propel the theme forward?\n\nThe Cliff Scene\n\n​\n\nGLOUCESTER'S ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. In this scene, Gloucester determines he will commit suicide. Why does he insist that a madman help him? Why is \"Mad Tom's\" madness important to Gloucester's purpose here?\n\nMADNESS AND BLINDNESS // AUTHOR PURPOSE. What point about madness AND blindness is being made here?\n\n\"EDGAR I NOTHING AM\" // CHARACTER MOTIVATION. Why does Edgar not reveal himself to his father, especially when it becomes clear that Gloucester admits he was wrong to trust Edmund?\n\nStaging and Production\n\nUNCOMFORTABLE LAUGHTER: STAGING THE FALL FROM THE CLIFF\n\nThis scene is notoriously difficult to stage. For one, it involves building a \"cliff\" for blind Gloucester to kneel upon, but what's more problematic is that it requires the actor playing Gloucester to fall. The effect is often met with uncomfortable laughter as we see an actor basically falling on his face, and given that he thinks he's leaping off the cliffs of Dover, the effect tends to play as comically anticlimactic.\n\n​\n\nIs some degree of comedy intentional here? Does Shakespeare intend to awaken (in the famous words of an AP prompt) \"thoughtful laughter\" in his audience?\n\nWhy would it be intentional? Why would he want audiences to laugh at Gloucester, who is at that point blinded, bereft of his children, and on the literal verge of suicide?\n\nHow do different productions we see on film handle this moment?\n\n​Compare at least two. The RSC scenework handles it by having Gloucester \"back up\" to the cliff, for example, while the Olivier production shows Gloucester falling flat on his face. How does that blocking choice affect our reaction to the play?"
