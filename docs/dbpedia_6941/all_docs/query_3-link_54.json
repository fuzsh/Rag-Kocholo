The two visits to Greg Doran’s rehearsal room set the foundation of my understanding of the play. To observe the first two weeks in the RSC rehearsal room was inspiring. The way that Greg and the acting company discuss text has challenged the traditional understanding of Shakespeare’s poetry.\n\n\"For me, it’s essential to distinguish literature in a traditional sense and dramatic language: how to visualise the philosophical layer of the text; how to find characters in the language and bring the images and characters alive on stage; how to connect to a wider audience. To find these connections are the foundation and principle to get closer to Shakespeare. The experience enhanced my further thinking on how to transpose Shakespeare’s world using Chinese language for the audience today. My thinking became clearer, as the emotional force of the text began to appear.\n\n\"My actors often speak fondly of the time in Stratford, the time when they spoke to the RSC actors about the characters, creating a contact point and understanding amongst themselves.\""
