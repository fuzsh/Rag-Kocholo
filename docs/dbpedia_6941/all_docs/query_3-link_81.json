( begins to cry ) ( Fleur breathlessly sobbing ) Do you remember?\n\nWhen you were a little girl, I used to brush your hair.\n\nA hundred strokes!\n\n( chuckles ) How you hated it!\n\nDo you want it up, or maybe a bow?\n\nI don't care.\n\nA bow, I think.\n\nThe more miserable one is on the inside, the more important it is to decorate the outside.\n\nIt doesn't matter anymore.\n\nYou feel too much, like your father.\n\nYou always have.\n\nWhat does he know?\n\nThis extraordinary idea that one should marry the person one is in love with.\n\nIn France, a husband is for convenience.\n\nLovers are for love.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThe new look.\n\nIt's very chic, very \"Colette.\"\n\nI brought you the new book from Paris.\n\nI'm getting lines.\n\nYou are very beautiful, and no one can take that away from you.\n\nFind yourself a good man-- a man that won't cause you trouble.\n\nThen look elsewhere for your passion.\n\n( knock at door ) Come in.\n\nMr. Mont's here again.\n\nI don't want to see him.\n\nHe brought these.\n\nAnd these.\n\n( laughing ) He's an idiot!\n\nAnd these.\n\n( laughing ) What shall I tell him?\n\nCome back tomorrow and he might find me up.\n\n( crying ) Oui.\n\nYou shouldn't invest in stocks.\n\nToo high-risk.\n\nTake out bonds.\n\nBonds are boring.\n\nI have bonds.\n\nExactly.\n\nSo did your father, and mine.\n\nThe Forsytes probably invented the concept.\n\n( knock at door ) Monsieur Profond, ma'am.\n\nProsper!\n\nI thought you'd gone!\n\nHow lovely to see you.\n\nEurope is a dull place.\n\nAnd I pined for Green Street.\n\nNonsense.\n\nBusiness brought you back, then?\n\nA long-term investment.\n\nGEORGE: Delighted, old boy.\n\nOh, you're just the thing.\n\nI want to park my money, and George is no good.\n\nGEORGE: Well, if you insist on shares, you should get Soames to handle it for you.\n\nKeep it in the family.\n\nI've never had the ready in my life!\n\nI'm not about to give it to anyone else to play with.\n\nWell said.\n\nWINIFRED: As far as I can see, investment is just a sophisticated form of gambling.\n\nAnd it's not as if I don't know about that, is it?\n\nPROFOND: The American market is where you should start.\n\nWall Street is in the doldrums at the moment, but it is going to go up.\n\nReally?\n\nUm...\n\nI think I'll go to the club.\n\nOh... dear.\n\nYou'll excuse me?\n\nIRENE: Jon?\n\nI'm going upstairs.\n\nJon!\n\nThere's someone to see you.\n\nNot now.\n\nThese are good.\n\nThey are very good.\n\nYou're lucky to see them here at all.\n\nMy sister's about to make off with them and hang them all in her gallery.\n\nYou come from an artistic family.\n\nSometimes it's hard to live up to.\n\nWere your parents artists?\n\nNo, they were peasants, from the north of Armenia.\n\nBut you're so... Rich?\n\nYes, I make it my life's work.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI've been rude.\n\nThings are difficult at the moment.\n\nYou need a change of scene.\n\nYou are an outdoors chap.\n\nI have some mines in British Columbia if you... That's a big change!\n\nAnd it's kind of you, but... Six months ago, I'd love to have gone to British Columbia.\n\nThe beauty of the world.\n\nI look at it now, and it doesn't seem beautiful anymore.\n\nYou are in a poor way?\n\nI am, rather.\n\nSo is Fleur Forsyte, from what I hear.\n\nHow did you know?\n\nShe has been ill apparently.\n\nBut happily, she's better now, returning to bloom.\n\nThe sun is shining on her in the form of a young man, Michael Mont.\n\nDo you know him?\n\nNo.\n\nA favorite of hers, it seems.\n\nHas been for a while.\n\nÀ bientôt.\n\nYes, good-bye.\n\nTake care.\n\nWhat an amusing man!\n\nFleur's got someone else.\n\nAlready!\n\nAlready!\n\nMind the... Good, good.\n\nFollow me, follow me, through here.\n\nJust here.\n\nI want it in front of this panel.\n\nMOVER: Is this okay, sir?\n\nSOAMES: Yes, fine.\n\nStop just there, thank you.\n\nGood.\n\nIt's electrically pumped.\n\nIt reproduces perfectly.\n\nAnd we're off.\n\n( Rachmaninoff prelude playing) ( Annette gasping ) It's wonderful!\n\nMONT: Madame, will you dance with me?\n\nShall we?\n\nDon't be stupid.\n\n( music continues with flourish ) ( laughing ) ANNETTE: Bravo, bravo!\n\nThey're dancing madly in there!\n\nI'm out of puff!\n\nMichael's staying for lunch.\n\nDoes she like him?\n\nFleur?\n\nOf course Fleur!\n\nI haven't asked her.\n\nUsually, she'd have told me... until this summer.\n\nThis boy...\n\nI've done nothing wrong.\n\nThis boy Jon Forsyte, he hurt her.\n\nShe's angry.\n\nWhy with me?\n\nBecause she can be.\n\nWill she come back?\n\n( music continues in background ) I hope so.\n\nThank you... for coming back from France so quickly.\n\nIt was nothing.\n\nWe needed you, and you came.\n\nIt is rather amazing... a piano that plays on its own.\n\nThere'll be proper wireless transmission soon.\n\nThese old things will be swept away.\n\nIt'll change everything.\n\nIdeas will finally have a channel.\n\nOf course, it'll be very dangerous.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt's easy to lie when you're not face to face.\n\nSometimes I think that you like me.\n\nOtherwise why would you want me here?\n\nWhy would you keep me hanging on?\n\nAnd sometimes I think that you really don't care at all.\n\nIs there someone else?\n\nNo.\n\nThen I'm going to ask you again.\n\nAnd if the answer's \"no,\" I'm not coming back.\n\nBut we're friends.\n\nI believe I could make you happy as more than that.\n\nWill you marry me, Fleur?\n\nWould you do anything for me?\n\nEven if everybody told you not to, would you stand by me anyway?\n\nIf you were my wife, I would.\n\nThen I'll do it.\n\nI'll marry you.\n\n( all laughing and talking ) GEORGE: A toast!\n\nTo the happy couple!\n\nALL: The happy couple!\n\nMichael.\n\nCongratulations, my dear.\n\n( breathes deeply ) My darling.\n\nWell, you'll have to let me beat you at billiards now, young man.\n\nAbsolutely, sir, I promise.\n\nEvery night.\n\nGEORGE: It's a bit speedy, isn't it?\n\nShe's not up the duff, is she?\n\nOh, George!\n\nYou are not enjoying your port?\n\nOh, sorry.\n\nIt's rather grand, in a small way.\n\nIt's delicious.\n\nHave you thought any more about British Columbia?\n\nYou're so nice to me, and I don't know why.\n\nYou lie terribly.\n\nIt's most amusing.\n\nThank you.\n\nI also have a small concern in New York.\n\nA printing business.\n\nPrinting?\n\nYou could get your hands dirty in that way.\n\nYou would have to work.\n\nI don't mind that.\n\nMy mother would be pretty much alone.\n\nI think your mother is quite capable of looking after herself.\n\nMONT: Ah, gentlemen.\n\nMAN: There you are, you old devil.\n\nGetting hitched?\n\nYou should see her.\n\nShe's a beauty.\n\nTo Michael... and his wife-to-be.\n\nFleur.\n\nMEN: Fleur!\n\nYou did not know?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nShe can't love him.\n\nShe is marrying him.\n\nWhen?\n\nSoon.\n\nShe must be doing it to hurt me.\n\nWhy don't you find out?\n\nANNETTE: What's King Lear all about?\n\nFathers, daughters, inheritance.\n\nThe usual things.\n\nSOAMES: So, he's back.\n\nHe's been here a while.\n\nDidn't you know?\n\nI hear congratulations are in order.\n\nYou do not lose a daughter, Mr. Forsyte, but you gain a son.\n\nThat's the general idea.\n\nMadame.\n\nUnlike King Lear, of course, who lose everything.\n\nThe death of his daughter Cordelia is utterly unnecessary.\n\nWell, you've given it away!\n\nA sacrifice to the proprieties of tragedy.\n\nOh, you dropped your program.\n\nOh.\n\nIn the 18th century, they rewrote the ending.\n\nCordelia lived.\n\nSo did her husband and her doting father.\n\nEveryone happy ever after.\n\nQuite right.\n\nMONT: Shall we see you in the interval?\n\nI doubt I'll endure that long.\n\nÀ bientôt.\n\n( softly ): Excuse me.\n\nMONT: You all right?\n\nI'm a little hot.\n\nACTOR: Go thou.\n\nI'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs to apply to his bleeding face.\n\nNow, heaven help him!\n\n( orchestra plays; audience applauds ) Excuse me.\n\n( comments quietly ) Ah, where's Fleur?\n\nWho was the boy, sir, with Profond?\n\nBoy?\n\nDark, good looking.\n\nFleur looked like she'd seen a ghost.\n\nWith Profond?\n\nAre you sure?\n\nIf she had a former attachment, I need to know.\n\nA silly romance.\n\nHe trifled with her.\n\nHe threw her over.\n\nAnd is she over it now?\n\nIf she wasn't, she wouldn't be marrying you.\n\nAnnette, my dear.\n\nAre you all right?\n\nStupid to feel so faint.\n\nThe play's about to start again.\n\nI thought I saw someone I knew.\n\nWell, they're not here now.\n\nIf you saw them, they've gone.\n\nAre you ready to go back in?\n\nI'm ready.\n\nGood.\n\nFleur...\n\nI haven't got much time.\n\nI'm shopping with Michael and mother.\n\nPresents for the bridesmaids.\n\nSo what do you want?\n\nI had to see you.\n\nWhy?\n\nDo you love him?\n\nReally love him?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIt's possible.\n\nSo you believe I could do that-- love you one day, body and soul, and forget about you the next.\n\nNo, I...\n\nIf you don't love him, why are you marrying him?\n\nTo get away from home, of course!\n\nI can't stand my father.\n\nMichael's nice.\n\nHe'll look after me.\n\nNice.\n\nWell?\n\nNice isn't enough!\n\nA marriage for convenience is terrible.\n\nWhat are my alternatives?\n\nYou know I still love you.\n\nHow can I know that?\n\nOh, I think about you every moment of every day.\n\nIs that why you're here?\n\nWe'd be ruining too many people's lives-- my mother's, your father's.\n\nNot this again.\n\nWe cannot exist in a bubble, Fleur.\n\nBut we can't exist for other people.\n\nYou see?\n\nWe think differently.\n\nNo, Jon.\n\nNot really.\n\nI might be selfish, but at least I'm honest.\n\nNone of this matters.\n\nIt's all excuses.\n\nThe truth is, they poisoned you against me-- your mother, your family... No.\n\nThey made you doubt me.\n\nI can see it now in the way you look at me.\n\nIs she really like her father-- a grasping, greedy Forsyte?\n\nNo!\n\nI don't think like that.\n\n( softly ): But you don't want me back.\n\nYou brought me here today to make sure I don't belong to someone else.\n\nAnd what's that if not possession-- possession of the lowest sort?\n\nI'm so sorry.\n\nNo, I am.\n\nI love you, Jon, so much it hurts.\n\nPlease don't go.\n\nThere's nothing to stay for.\n\nWe've hardly talked.\n\nDon't try and see me again.\n\nYou can't marry him!\n\n( softly ): You can't.\n\nAnd who are you to tell me that?\n\nIf you won't have me, then I shall do it my own way.\n\nAnd I'll forget about you, Jon Forsyte, I swear I will.\n\nMONT: Ah, there she is.\n\nANNETTE: Who was that?\n\nAn old friend, I believe.\n\nYou knew she was meeting this boy.\n\nI had an inkling.\n\nYou English men!\n\nI don't understand.\n\nAbsurd codes of honor.\n\nThese things have to be cleared up.\n\nAnd what if you've lost her?\n\nThen I never had her.\n\nAre you all right, my dear?\n\nYou look cold.\n\nMaybe a little.\n\nBut I'm all right, Mother.\n\nIn fact, I've never been better.\n\nJUNE: Thank you so much for coming.\n\nWe'll keep in touch.\n\nJon...\n\nI didn't know you were in London.\n\nThey were so calm, weren't they, his pictures?\n\nLooking at them, it's like he's here.\n\nWe've hung them thematically.\n\nLet me show you.\n\nI've decided I'm going to New York.\n\nCan I take a picture, please?\n\nA drawing?\n\nOf course.\n\nAny that you like.\n\nAnother time.\n\nJon!\n\nWhy New York?\n\nI thought you hated cities.\n\nOr is she going out there and you're tagging along?\n\n( crying ) I'm sorry.\n\nI didn't... Oh, I've been so cross and miserable.\n\nShe's marrying someone else.\n\nOh, Jon!\n\nIt's not her fault, it's me.\n\nI've been loathsome.\n\nEver since Dad died, I can't think straight.\n\nOne moment I want Fleur, and the next, I...\n\nI don't recognize myself.\n\nYou've been caught by the past, my love.\n\nAll that pain and anger...\n\nI found this in an old portfolio.\n\nIt's Mum.\n\nWho's the man?\n\nHe was her lover, the person who gave her the strength to leave Fleur's father.\n\nHe was also my fiancée.\n\nThere are a great deal of things in my life that I'm proud of.\n\nThis gallery, for one.\n\nBut the best thing, the most important thing is that Irene and I found a way to put the past behind us.\n\nYou can do that too, Jon.\n\nBut nothing means anything anymore.\n\nIt will.\n\nIt will.\n\nBelieve me.\n\n( player piano playing Rachmaninoff prelude ) This will never do.\n\nIt's filthy.\n\nBilson and the rest of the staff will give a final clean tomorrow.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think Michael should go home.\n\nIt's bad luck to see your bride the evening before a wedding.\n\nFleur is happy.\n\nThat is the important thing.\n\n( Fleur giggling ) It's getting rather late.\n\nYou're right.\n\nI should be getting back.\n\nOh, no, Michael, please don't go.\n\nYou can stay all night, if you like.\n\nANNETTE: Uh-uh-uh.\n\nSave that for tomorrow.\n\nGood night.\n\nGood night, Mr. Mont.\n\nGood night, sir.\n\nMichael.\n\nI'll see you out.\n\nMONT: You know you're a pig to your father.\n\nFLEUR: He deserves it.\n\nI rather like him.\n\nAfter all, he introduced me to you.\n\nYou know you've never said it.\n\nSaid what?\n\nThat you love me.\n\nBecause if you don't, we should stop all this now.\n\nWhat a chump you are-- giving a girl the let-out.\n\nIt might make me think you don't care.\n\nDon't twist things.\n\nYou know I do.\n\nAnd you?\n\nFace to face.\n\nCan you say it?\n\nI love you, Michael, more than anything, more than anyone.\n\nThere-- now I've said it.\n\nYou probably care for me less.\n\nI care for you more... if that's possible.\n\nDon't.\n\nBlast!\n\nAre you ready?\n\nYou look very beautiful, my dear.\n\nAway with you, both of you.\n\nI'll do that.\n\nYou can always pull out, you know, if you want to.\n\nAnd why should I do that?\n\nMarriage is for life.\n\nOr at least it should be.\n\nThink very carefully.\n\nI have thought.\n\nNot about Michael, you haven't.\n\nBut the other one.\n\nDon't talk about him!\n\nYou don't have the right.\n\nThe right!\n\nI'm your father.\n\nI've given you everything.\n\nI'll give it all back when I'm married.\n\nI'll throw it at you, if needs be.\n\nMy whole life I have dedicated to you, to making you happy.\n\nWell, you got it wrong, didn't you?!\n\nYou thought I cared about dresses and frippery!\n\nI'd have married Jon in my underclothes!\n\nAnd because of you...\n\nyou!...\n\nHe stopped loving me!\n\nThe one thing I really wanted.\n\nOf course...\n\nIt's my fault.\n\nIt always was.\n\nThat's how she saw it, how she still sees it.\n\nI don't want to hear about her.\n\nI'll tell you anyway, shall I?\n\nThe great sin your father committed.\n\nThen you can write me off altogether.\n\nI said I don't want to hear it.\n\nI married her because I loved her.\n\nVery simple.\n\nThat's why Michael's marrying you.\n\nShe abused my trust.\n\nShe denied me my right as a husband.\n\nShe ignored me.\n\nShe flaunted her lover in my face.\n\nShe locked me out of her life, her body.\n\nPlease!\n\nOne night... her door was open, and she was lying there looking very beautiful.\n\nShe is very beautiful, don't you think?\n\nI whispered her name, and she was asleep.\n\nStop.\n\nI must have been mad.\n\nI think I was.\n\nMad for her.\n\nSo I took her.\n\nForcibly.\n\nA punishment.\n\nAnd now when I see her... and whenever she looks at me...\n\nI know she's thinking only of that.\n\n( sobs ) ( sniffles ) It's all in the past, Daddy.\n\nIt's a terrible thing.\n\nJon didn't have to leave me.\n\nYou didn't change his mind.\n\nHe did that all for himself.\n\nThe fool.\n\nWhen he could have had you.\n\nHe didn't want me... Not enough.\n\nWINIFRED: Oh, there's Bilson.\n\nWhat a day, Bilson.\n\nI never thought I'd see it.\n\nGEORGE: Not a bad turnout.\n\nProbably wondering the same as me: Will the bride reach the starting block?\n\nWINIFRED: Of course she will.\n\nGEORGE: It's a havey cavey business.\n\nWINIFRED: It's all for the best.\n\nNow get in.\n\nThe aristocracy are such a disappointment.\n\nOne expects them to look different.\n\nWho from?\n\nFrom us, of course.\n\nBut if anything, we've got the edge.\n\nSmarter, better turned-out.\n\nFleur's done that, at least.\n\nWhat?\n\nOfficially pulled us into the upper classes.\n\nOh!\n\nOur names will be recorded on the stud book: money joined to land.\n\nWINIFRED: Annette.\n\n( whispering ): Psst, Annette!\n\nIs everything all right?\n\nShe's on her way.\n\nShe's on her way.\n\nShe's on her way, George.\n\nFleur!\n\nI've got it.\n\nI'm ready now.\n\nLet's get away from here.\n\nNow!\n\nOur Grand Tour.\n\nDressed like this?\n\nI should stand out, rather, don't you think?\n\nBut are you sure about this?\n\nYour marriage to Michael?\n\nMarriage can be a... misery.\n\nWe'll be all right, Michael and I.\n\nWe'll rub along.\n\nBut thank you all the same.\n\n( organ playing introductory notes ) ( wedding march playing ) ( door opens ) You know what's happening now... this moment?\n\nYes.\n\nYou know that you'll forget her soon enough, out there.\n\nHow long did it take you to forget this other chap?\n\nThe one before Dad.\n\nOh... A while.\n\nA long while.\n\nI saw Fleur again.\n\nOh, so she made contact?\n\nNo, I did.\n\nThe way we parted before was terrible.\n\nBut this time... We met in Green Park.\n\nShe was different.\n\nGrown up.\n\nAnd everything she did that day... everything she said... reminded me of why I loved her.\n\nOh, Jon.\n\nI thought I might go to Paris, stay with some old friends.\n\nThen maybe on to Spain.\n\nAnd the house?\n\nWhat will happen to it?\n\nI shall let it, or... put it up for sale.\n\nFor sale.\n\nA house is only a possession after all.\n\nStill, it's hard not to care.\n\n( organ playing recessional ) ( crowd applauding ) ( cheering ) SOAMES: It's Profond.\n\nShe did say she wouldn't invite him.\n\nWell, don't let it spoil things.\n\nNot today.\n\nDidn't Fleur look lovely?\n\nAnd that dress... Have you ever been married, Mr. Profond?\n\nA number of times.\n\nI don't recommend it.\n\nIt's like Miss Anne used to say, Miss Hester.\n\nMarriage is not the be-all.\n\nBut one might like to try it, all the same.\n\nA successful affair, Mr. Forsyte.\n\nThe bride looked in top-notch health.\n\nIndeed.\n\nWhy shouldn't she?\n\nA splendid display of the feminine sex, but the gem, the cherry on the cake... is your sister, of course, Mrs. Winifred Dartie.\n\n( Winifred giggling ) Oh, Prosper.\n\nI... just must... um... yes.\n\nGosh, sorry!\n\nI didn't mean...\n\nIt's all right.\n\nYou're Michael's cousin, aren't you?\n\nDo you want me to go?\n\nStay, if you like.\n\nYou looked so beautiful in your wedding dress.\n\nI can't wait to be married.\n\nHow old are you?\n\nNine.\n\nNine.\n\nThat's a lovely age to be.\n\nYour sash is undone.\n\nThere.\n\nYou're not crying?\n\nOn my wedding day?\n\nOf course not!\n\n( sniffles ) Go and tell them I'm almost ready.\n\n( crying ) ( sighs ) MONT: I've brought the car to the front.\n\nWhere's Fleur?\n\nI'll go and see.\n\nI will.\n\nShe's coming down!\n\nShe's coming down!\n\nShe's coming down!\n\nExcuse me!\n\nExcuse me!\n\nOh, my darling.\n\n( guests oohing and ahhing ) ( guests exclaiming ) Darling, will you take my handbag?\n\nThank you very much for all your help.\n\nAnd we'll see you soon.\n\nDaddy.\n\nWill you do something for me?\n\nThe picture... the Degas... MONT: Come on, Fleur.\n\nWe've got a boat to catch.\n\nThrow it away, will you?\n\nGet rid of it.\n\nI don't want it here when I get back... reminding me.\n\n( motor turning ) ( cheering ) ( horn tooting ) Wait here, Speight.\n\nI'll walk the rest of the way.\n\nSPEIGHT: Very good, sir.\n\nPARFITT: I, er... thought I'd start on the cellar, ma'am.\n\nMr. Jolyon's fishing equipment.\n\nIf you would, Parfitt.\n\nThere is somebody coming to view the house this afternoon.\n\n( knock at door ) Probably be them now.\n\nThank you.\n\nI shall see to it.\n\nYou haven't come for the house.\n\nIt crossed my mind... but no.\n\nOh.\n\nThis is for your boy.\n\nFleur wanted me to get rid of it, but I couldn't.\n\nI think he should have it.\n\nIt's a small thing.\n\nNot valuable, but... important.\n\nCome in.\n\nPlease.\n\nYou're going away?\n\nJon's abroad.\n\nI've nothing to keep me here.\n\n( exclaims surprise ) Fleur.\n\nUm... A likeness, certainly.\n\nSomething in the eyes.\n\nYes.\n\nMy daughter was an imp.\n\nShe was never bad, you understand?\n\nHas something happened to her?\n\nNo.\n\nYou talked of her in the past tense.\n\nHoneymooning, that's all.\n\nForever, it seems.\n\nI sometimes wonder if I was right.\n\nAbout what?\n\nI got a letter from Jon today.\n\nSo formal.\n\nHe writes like a 45-year-old, and he was... was always so alive.\n\nDid we ruin it for them?\n\nWere we too blind to see?\n\nMy daughter is happily married.\n\nOf course.\n\nWe are anticipating grandchildren.\n\nThat would be a happy occurrence.\n\nI'll leave you to your packing.\n\nSoames?\n\nGood-bye, then.\n\nI won't see you again.\n\nProbably not.\n\nCome and gone?\n\nHe didn't come about the house.\n\nHe didn't want to let it?\n\nNo.\n\nOh, no.\n\nIn fact... he didn't want anything."
