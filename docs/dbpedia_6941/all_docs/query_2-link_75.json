        "text": "There is no misunderstanding. My cams have playback function from my SD cards ! I use it everyday. What they are doing is removing local play back function from the alert. This is my beef and pushing a sub plan! Yeah this is bs… they could put the link to the pic to allow play back. I have an SD card. They ripped out the playback function. They changed the app UI to make it difficult. F that !!! We didn’t cause this issue they did. I’m sympathetic. However !!! Making the app less functional isn’t the right way to handle this. I’m not sorry I bought this to not to have a subscription plan. So stop shoving it down my throat. If you don’t understand what I’m saying is they took out the play back from the Time stamp of the alert pic you get. I don’t need my alerts to play from their servers when I have sd cards on all my cams. Waste ! They did not disclose when I purchased they would cripple the app in favor of a subscription plan. I want a refund for all my cams!! Shady as heck! I would have went with ring or nest if I wanted a sub plan. Here an idea stick to a what made you successful, not trying to create 50 other nonsense items that waste money. Business 101.\n\nThey did not remove the ‘local playback function’ unless that button is missing from the bottom bar when you open the thumbnail. Can you post a screenshot?\n\nAs Customer stated, when you click on an Event in the Events tab, whether it was a 12s clip or a full length clip, what it was showing you was the clip that the camera captured and sent to the cloud for 14 day storage. ALL video in the events tab IS cloud streamed video. Your SD video is still accessible.\n\nYour SD card video is accessed from the VIEW PLAYBACK bar at the bottom of one of these Events. Or alternatively, by pressing the playback button that looks like an SD card at the bottom of the Live View screen when you open the cam from the home screen.\n\nNow, with the introduction of the new Thumbnail base version (no AI) I am not sure if there is a view playback bar at the bottom. I will have to test that. If someone has a screenshot of the thumbnail event tab please post. If the view playback bar IS missing, this is something Wyze will need to address. You should be able to open your alert notification to the thumbnail or from the events and press playback. I agree.\n\nAs for CamPlusLite, you can get your 12s clips Plus Person Detection at no cost if you are willing to jump thru some hoops. Yeah, PIA. I know. But it is a solution rather than a rant. There are many people here who will help you work thru this if you ask.\n\nWyze is in huge transition right now and it is showing. Thousands of posts. Much growth, much pain. But, it will get better. I am nugging my way thru the changes and updates.\n\nYou might check these out. Some of them will help with the CamPlusLite.\n\nMy post:\n\nThat’s a little confusing ATM.\n\nForgetting the WCO, the SD playback buttons are not supposed to be affected. But as you say, there are several possible complaints. Is that a bug, or because so many people are logging on about the change? I can’t tell. Right now there is a bug that won’t let me turn off Cam Plus Lite to test this on non-WCO cameras.\n\nThe SD card ‘Playback’ button IS there on my non-WCO Cam Plus and Cam Plus Lite cams I have. I just can’t simulate a non-WCO Cam Plus Lite without a 12-second clip, nor an account that isn’t in some way subscribed to Cam Plus Lite. Maybe tomorrow I will create a new account and try not signing up for Cam Plus Lite (with can be had for $0, so no ‘pay’ conspiracy…?)\n\nAs far as WCOs go, there never has been a Playback button on any of them, and probably never will be. Those are battery-powered cams, and Wyze isn’t going to create yet another flurry of complaints about ‘why did my battery die in less than a day?’ on those. You can still schedule a recording if you like though, so they left people a method.\n\nAs far as automatic sign-ups, I think they did that for anyone on the legacy person detection & Cam Plus. Maybe they could have done more here, but up front those were the people that obviously cared the most."
