        "text": "[Enter Hamlet, and two or three of the Players (actors)]\n\nHamlet\n\nSpeak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to\n\nyou, trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as\n\nmany of your players do, I had as lief the town crier had\n\nspoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with\n\nyour hand, thus, but useuse gently. For in the very torrent,\n\ntempest, and as I may say, whirlwind of your passion,\n\nyou acquire and beget a temperance that may give\n\nit smoothness. Oh, it offends me to the soul to hear a\n\nrobustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to\n\ntatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings,\n\nwho for the most part are capable of nothing but\n\ninexplicable dumb shows and noise. I could have such a\n\nfellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods\n\nHerod. Pray you avoid it.\n\nPlayer\n\nI warrant your honor.\n\nHamlet\n\nBe not too tame neither, but let your own\n\ndiscretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the\n\nword to the action, with this special observance: that you\n\no'erstep not the modesty of nature. For anything so overdone\n\nis from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at\n\nthe first and now, was and is to hold, as 'twere, the mirror\n\nup to nature — to show virtue her own feature, scorn her\n\nown image, and the very age and body of the time his\n\nform and pressure. Now, this overdone or come tardy off,\n\nthough it makes the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the\n\njudicious grieve, the censure of the which, one must in\n\nyour allowance o'erweigh a whole theater of others. Oh,\n\nthere be players that I have seen play, and heard others\n\npraise, and that highly, (not to speak it profanely) that,\n\nneither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of\n\nChristian, pagan, nor no man, have so strutted and\n\nbellowed that I have thought some of nature's journeymen\n\nhad made men (and not made them well) they\n\nimitated humanity so abominably.\n\nPlayer\n\nI hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.\n\nHamlet\n\nOh, reform it altogether. And let those that play your\n\nclowns speak no more than is set down for them. For there\n\nbe of them will themselves laugh, to set on some\n\nquantity of barren spectators to laugh too. Though in the\n\nmeantime, some necessary question of the play be then\n\nto be considered. That's villainous, and shows a most pitiful\n\nambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.\n\n[Exit Players. Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]\n\nHow now, my lord, will the king hear this piece of work?\n\nPolonius\n\nAnd the queen too, and that presently.\n\nHamlet\n\nBid the players make haste.\n\n[Exit Polonius.]\n\nWill you two help to hasten them?\n\nRosencrantz\n\nWe will, my lord.\n\n[Exit Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Enter Horatio.]\n\nHamlet\n\nWhat ho, Horatio!\n\nHoratio\n\nHere, sweet lord, at your service.\n\nHamlet\n\nHoratio, thou art e'en as just a man\n\nAs e'er my conversation coped withal.\n\nHoratio\n\nOh, my dear lord ...\n\nHamlet\n\nNay, do not think I flatter,\n\nFor what advancement may I hope from thee\n\nThat no revenue has but thy good spirits\n\nTo feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flattered?\n\nNo, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp\n\nAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee\n\nWhere thrift may follow feigning. Do thou hear?\n\nSince my dear soul was mistress of my choice,\n\nAnd could of men distinguish, her election\n\nHas sealed thee for herself. For thou has been\n\nAs one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing —\n\nA man that Fortune's buffets and rewards\n\nHas ta'en with equal thanks. And blest are those\n\nWhose blood and judgment are so well commingled,\n\nThat they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger\n\nTo sound what stop she please. Give me that man\n\nThat is not passion's slave, and I will wear him\n\nIn my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,\n\nAs I do thee — something too much of this.\n\nThere is a play tonight before the king.\n\nOne scene of it comes near the circumstance\n\nWhich I have told thee of my father's death.\n\nI prithee, when thou see'st that act afoot,\n\nEven, with the very comment of thy soul,\n\nObserve mine uncle. If his occulted guilt\n\nDo not itself unkennel in one speech,\n\nIt is a damnèd ghost that we have seen,\n\nAnd my imaginations are as foul\n\nAs Vulcan's stithy give him heedful note.\n\nFor I, mine eyes will rivet to his face,\n\nAnd after, we will both our judgments join\n\nIn censure of his seeming.\n\nHoratio\n\nWell, my lord.\n\nIf he steal aught the whilst this play is playing\n\nAnd 'scape detected, I will pay the theft.\n\nHamlet\n\nThey are coming to the play. I must be idle.\n\nGet you a place.\n\n[Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and other Lords.]\n\nClaudius\n\nHow fares our cousin Hamlet?\n\nHamlet\n\nExcellent, i'faith, of the chameleon's dish; I eat the\n\nair, promise-crammed. You cannot feed capons so.\n\nClaudius\n\nI have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These\n\nwords are not mine.\n\nHamlet\n\nNo, nor mine. [To Polonius] Now, my lord,\n\nyou played once i'th' university, you say?\n\nPolonius\n\nThat did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.\n\nHamlet\n\nAnd what did you enact?\n\nPolonius\n\nI did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i'th' Capitol.\n\nBrutus killed me.\n\nHamlet\n\nIt was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.\n\nBe the players ready?\n\nRosencrantz\n\nAy, my lord, they stay upon your patience.\n\nGertrude\n\nCome hither, my good Hamlet, sit by me.\n\nHamlet\n\n[Indicating Ophelia] No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.\n\nPolonius\n\n[Aside to the King] Oh, ho, do you mark that?\n\nHamlet\n\n[To Ophelia] Lady, shall I lie in your lap?\n\nOphelia\n\nNo, my lord!\n\nHamlet\n\nI mean, my head upon your lap.\n\nOphelia\n\nAy, my lord.\n\nHamlet\n\nDo you think I meant country matters?\n\nOphelia\n\nI think nothing, my lord.\n\nHamlet\n\nThat's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.\n\nOphelia\n\nWhat is, my lord?\n\nHamlet\n\nOphelia\n\nYou are merry, my lord.\n\nHamlet\n\nWho, I?\n\nOphelia\n\nAy, my lord.\n\nHamlet\n\nOh, God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do\n\nbut be merry? For look you how cheerfully my mother\n\nlooks, and my father died within's two hours.\n\nOphelia\n\nNay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.\n\nHamlet\n\nSo long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a\n\nsuit of sables. Oh, heavens! Die two months ago, and not\n\nforgotten yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory\n\nmay outlive his life halfa year. But, by'r Lady, he must\n\nbuild churches then, or else shall he suffer not thinking on,\n\nwith the hobby-horse whose epitaph is:\n\n\"For oh, for oh, the hobby-horse is forgot.\"\n\n[It was common for plays in the 16th century to include a \"dumb show\" – a brief pantomine performance in which the actors don't speak (as in the expression \"deaf and dumb\"), whose purpose was to illustrate the moral of the story. This dumb show begins with a King and Queen entering, acting very affectionate. She embraces him and kneels down, as if protesting something. He lifts her up and hugs her. She lays him down on a bed of flowers. Once he falls asleep, she leaves. Lucianus arrives, removes the King’s crown, kisses it, pours poison in the King’s ear, and then exits. The Queen returns to find the King dead, and she becomes distraught. Lucianus returns and pretends to console the Queen. The dead body is carried away. Then Lucianus woos the Queen with presents. She rebuffs him initially, but after a while, she gives in and accepts his love. They exit.]\n\nOphelia\n\nWhat means this, my lord?\n\nHamlet\n\nMarry, this is “miching mallico” — that means mischief.\n\nOphelia\n\nBelike this show imports the argument of the play?\n\n[Enter a Player as Prologue.]\n\nHamlet\n\nWe shall know by this fellow. The players cannot\n\nkeep counsel, they'll tell all.\n\nOphelia\n\nWill they tell us what this show meant?\n\nHamlet\n\nAy, or any show that you will show him. Be not you\n\nashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.\n\nOphelia\n\nYou are naught, you are naught. I'll mark the play.\n\nPrologue\n\nFor us and for our tragedy,\n\nHere stooping to your clemency,\n\nWe beg your hearing patiently.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nHamlet\n\nIs this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?\n\nOphelia\n\n'Tis brief, my lord.\n\nHamlet\n\nAs woman's love.\n\n[Enter two actors in the roles of King and Queen.]\n\nPlayer King\n\nFull thirty times has Phoebus' cart gone round\n\nNeptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbèd ground,\n\nAnd thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen\n\nAbout the world have times twelve thirties been,\n\nSince love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,\n\nUnite commutual in most sacred bands.\n\nPlayer Queen\n\nSo many journeys may the sun and moon\n\nMake us again count o'er, ere love be done.\n\nBut woe is me, you are so sick of late,\n\nSo far from cheer and from your former state,\n\nThat I distrust you. Yet though I distrust,\n\nDiscomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;\n\nFor women's fear and love hold quantity\n\nIn neither aught or in extremity.\n\nNow, what my love is, proof has made you know.\n\nAnd as my love is sized, my fear is so.\n\nPlayer King\n\nFaith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too.\n\nMy operant powers, their functions leave to do.\n\nAnd thou shalt live in this fair world behind,\n\nHonored, beloved. And haply one as kind,\n\nFor husband shalt thou ...\n\nPlayer Queen\n\nOh, confound the rest!\n\nSuch love must needs be treason in my breast.\n\nIn second husband let me be accurst,\n\nNone wed the second but who killed the first.\n\nHamlet\n\nWormwood, wormwood.\n\nPlayer Queen\n\nThe instances that second marriage move\n\nAre base respects of thrift, but none of love.\n\nA second time I kill my husband dead,\n\nWhen second husband kisses me in bed.\n\nPlayer King\n\nI do believe you think what now you speak,\n\nBut what we do determine, oft we break.\n\nPurpose is but the slave to memory,\n\nOf violent birth but poor validity;\n\nWhich now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,\n\nBut fall unshaken when they mellow be.\n\nMost necessary 'tis that we forget\n\nTo pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.\n\nWhat to ourselves in passion we propose,\n\nThe passion ending, does the purpose lose.\n\nThe violence of either grief or joy\n\nTheir own enactors with themselves destroy.\n\nWhere joy most revels, grief does most lament;\n\nGrief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.\n\nThis world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange\n\nThat even our loves should with our fortunes change.\n\nFor 'tis a question left us yet to prove —\n\nWhether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.\n\nThe great man down, you mark — his favorite flies;\n\nThe poor, advanced, makes friends of enemies.\n\nAnd hitherto does love on fortune tend,\n\nFor who not needs shall never lack a friend;\n\nAnd who in want a hollow friend does try,\n\nDirectly seasons him his enemy.\n\nBut orderly to end where I begun,\n\nOur wills and fates do so contrary run\n\nThat our devices still are overthrown;\n\nOur thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.\n\nSo think thou wilt no second husband wed,\n\nBut die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.\n\nPlayer Queen\n\nNor earth to me give food nor heaven light.\n\nSport and repose lock from me day and night,\n\nEach opposite that blanks the face of joy\n\nMeet what I would have well and it destroy,\n\nBoth here and hence pursue me lasting strife,\n\nIf once a widow, ever I be wife!\n\nHamlet\n\nIf she should break it now!\n\nPlayer King\n\n'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.\n\nMy spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile\n\nThe tedious day with sleep.\n\nPlayer Queen\n\nSleep rock thy brain,\n\n[The Player King sleeps.]\n\nAnd never come mischance between us twain!\n\n[Exit Player Queen.]\n\nHamlet\n\n[To Gertrude] Madam, how like you this play?\n\nGertrude\n\nThe lady protests too much, methinks.\n\nHamlet\n\nOh, but she'll keep her word.\n\nClaudius\n\nHave you heard the argument? Is there no offense in't?\n\nHamlet\n\nNo, no, they do but jest, poison in jest, no offense i'th' world.\n\nClaudius\n\nWhat do you call the play?\n\nHamlet\n\n\"The Mousetrap.\" Marry, how? Tropically. This play\n\nis the image of a murder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the\n\nDuke's name, his wife Baptista; you shall see anon. 'Tis\n\na knavish piece of work, but what o' that ? Your majesty\n\nand we that have free souls, it touches us not. Let the\n\ngalled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.\n\n[Enter Lucianus.]\n\nThis is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.\n\nOphelia\n\nYou are a good chorus, my lord.\n\nHamlet\n\nI could interpret between you and your love, if I\n\ncould see the puppets dallying.\n\nOphelia\n\nYou are keen, my lord, you are keen.\n\nHamlet\n\nIt would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.\n\nOphelia\n\nStill better, and worse.\n\nHamlet\n\nSo you mis-take your husbands.\n\n[To the Players] Begin, murderer, leave thy damnable faces and\n\nbegin. Come, the croaking raven does bellow for revenge.\n\nLucianus\n\n‘Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing —\n\nConsiderate season else no creature seeing.\n\nThou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,\n\nWith Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,\n\nThy natural magic and dire property,\n\nOn wholesome life, usurp immediately.’\n\n[Pours the poison in his ears.]\n\nHamlet\n\nHe poisons him i'th' garden for his estate. His name's\n\nGonzago. The story is extant, and written in very\n\nchoice Italian. You shall see anon how the murderer\n\ngets the love of Gonzago's wife.\n\nOphelia\n\nThe king rises.\n\nHamlet\n\nWhat, frighted with false fire?\n\nGertrude\n\nHow fares my lord?\n\nPolonius\n\nGive o'er the play.\n\nClaudius\n\nGive me some light. Away!\n\nAll\n\nLights, lights, lights!\n\n[Exit all except Hamlet and Horatio]\n\nHamlet\n\n[Hamlet merrily sings a few lines from a ballad]\n\n‘Why, let the strucken deer go weep,\n\nThe hart ungalled play.\n\nFor some must watch, while some must sleep,\n\nSo runs the world away.’\n\nWould not this, sir, and a forest of feathers (if the rest of\n\nmy fortunes turn Turk with me) with two provincial\n\nroses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of\n\nplayers, sir?\n\nHoratio\n\nHalf a share.\n\nHamlet\n\nA whole one, I.\n\n[Making up a ballad]\n\n\"For thou dost know, Oh, Damon dear,\n\nThis realm dismantled was\n\nof Jove himself, and now reigns here\n\nA very, very — pajock.\"\n\nHoratio\n\nYou might have rhymed.\n\nHamlet\n\nOh good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for\n\na thousand pound. Didst perceive?\n\nHoratio\n\nVery well, my lord.\n\nHamlet\n\nUpon the talk of the poisoning?\n\nHoratio\n\nI did very well note him.\n\n[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\n\nHamlet\n\nOh, ha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders.\n\nFor if the king like not the comedy,\n\nWhy, then belike, he likes it not perdy.\n\nCome, some music.\n\nGuildenstern\n\nGood my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.\n\nHamlet\n\nSir, a whole history.\n\nGuildenstern\n\nThe king, sir ...\n\nHamlet\n\nAy, sir, what of him?\n\nGuildenstern\n\nIs in his retirement, marvelous distempered.\n\nHamlet\n\nWith drink, sir?\n\nGuildenstern\n\nNo, my lord, rather with choler.\n\nHamlet\n\nYour wisdom should show itself more richer to\n\nsignify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him to his\n\npurgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.\n\nGuildenstern\n\nGood my lord, put your discourse into some\n\nframe, and start not so wildly from my affair.\n\nHamlet\n\nI am tame, sir. Pronounce.\n\nGuildenstern\n\nThe queen, your mother, in most great\n\naffliction of spirit, has sent me to you.\n\nHamlet\n\nYou are welcome.\n\nGuildenstern\n\nNay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.\n\nIf it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer,\n\nI will do your mother's commandment. If not, your\n\npardon and my return shall be the end of my business.\n\nHamlet\n\nSir, I cannot.\n\nRosencrantz\n\nWhat, my lord?\n\nHamlet\n\nMake you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased.\n\nBut, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command —\n\nor rather, you say, my mother. Therefore no more, but\n\nto the matter. My mother, you say.\n\nRosencrantz\n\nThen thus she says: your behavior has struck her\n\ninto amazement and admiration.\n\nHamlet\n\nOh, wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother!\n\nBut is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's\n\nRosencrantz\n\nShe desires to speak with you in her closet\n\nere you go to bed.\n\nHamlet\n\nWe shall obey, were she ten times our mother.\n\nHave you any further trade with us?\n\nRosencrantz\n\nMy lord, you once did love me.\n\nHamlet\n\nSo I do still, by these pickers and stealers.\n\nRosencrantz\n\nGood my lord, what is your cause of distemper?\n\nYou do surely bar the door of your own liberty\n\nif you deny your griefs to your friend.\n\nHamlet\n\nSir, I lack advancement.\n\nRosencrantz\n\nHow can that be, when you have the voice of the king\n\nhimself for your succession in Denmark?\n\nHamlet\n\nAy, sir, but \"while the grass grows\" — the proverb\n\nis something musty.\n\n[An actor enters with a recorder, a simple flute-like musical instrument]\n\nOh, the recorder; let me see.\n\n[to Guildenstern] To withdraw with you,\n\nwhy do you go about to recover the wind of me,\n\nas if you would drive me into a toil?\n\nGuildenstern\n\nOh, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too\n\nHamlet\n\nI do not well understand that — will you play upon\n\nthis pipe?\n\nGuildenstern\n\nMy lord, I cannot.\n\nHamlet\n\nI pray you.\n\nGuildenstern\n\nBelieve me, I cannot.\n\nHamlet\n\nI do beseech you.\n\nGuildenstern\n\nI know no touch of it, my lord.\n\nHamlet\n\n'Tis as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with\n\nyour finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth,\n\nand it will discourse most excellent music. Look you, these\n\nare the stops.\n\nGuildenstern\n\nBut these cannot I command to any utterance of\n\nharmony. I have not the skill.\n\nHamlet\n\nWhy, look you now, how unworthy a thing you\n\nmake of me! You would play upon me, you would seem\n\nto know my stops, you would pluck out the heart of my\n\nmystery, you would sound me from my lowest note to the\n\ntop of my compass. And there is much music, excellent\n\nvoice, in this little compass, yet cannot you make it.\n\nWhy, do you think that I am easier to be played on than\n\na pipe? Call me what instrument you will; though you\n\nfret me, you cannot play upon me.\n\n[To Polonius, as he enters]\n\nGod bless you, sir.\n\nPolonius\n\nMy lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.\n\nHamlet\n\nDo you see yonder cloud? That's almost in shape like a camel.\n\nPolonius\n\nBy th' mass, and it's like a camel indeed.\n\nHamlet\n\nMethinks it is like a weasel.\n\nPolonius\n\nIt is backed like a weasel.\n\nHamlet\n\nOr like a whale?\n\nPolonius\n\nVery like a whale.\n\nHamlet\n\nThen I will come to my mother by and by.\n\n[Aside] They fool me to the top of my bent.\n\n[Aloud] I will come by and by.\n\nPolonius\n\nI will say so.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nHamlet\n\n\"By and by\" is easily said. Leave me, friends.\n\n[Exit all but Hamlet.]\n\n'Tis now the very witching time of night,\n\nWhen churchyards yawn, and hell itself breaks out\n\nContagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,\n\nAnd do such bitter business as the day\n\nWould quake to look on. Soft, now to my mother.\n\nOh heart, loose not thy nature! Let not ever\n\nThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.\n\nLet me be cruel, not unnatural.\n\nI will speak daggers to her, but use none.\n\nMy tongue and soul in this be hypocrites.\n\nHow in my words somever she be shent,\n\nTo give them seals, never my soul consent!\n\n[Exit Hamlet.]"
