        "text": "We all judge a book by its cover (or a bottle of wine by its label), so it should come as no surprise that one of the deciding factors on whether we click to watch a YouTube video or not, is a video’s thumbnail image.\n\nWe recently ran two thumbnails through visual heat mapping software to see what grabs a viewer’s attention on a first glance. On image one, the viewer’s attention is directed towards the text, the brand’s logo and the eye-catching parts of the high-quality image, giving the viewer a sneak peek as to what the film will be about, whilst also being visually appealing. In our opinion, this is why image one is more impactful as it uses this small window to its full potential.\n\n1. You should have a consistent template that is clear and easy to maintain\n\nConsistency is key for brand recognition and having a template in place can be time-saving for channel management.\n\n2. You should use clear and high-quality images\n\nThe image used for the thumbnail should be clear and not cluttered, whilst also being eye-catching.\n\n3. You should incorporate clear and colourful text that is easy to read\n\nThe text should be short and legible for both YouTube search results and the channel’s video section.\n\n4. You should be aware of the overlays\n\nAs seen below, we have created a three zone template to highlight where key visual elements and graphics should and shouldn’t be placed.\n\nNeed help?\n\nWe are YouTube experts who will help manage, integrate, optimise, amplify and evaluate your YouTube content and channel, ensuring you reach the right audience and drive high quality engagement and action rates.\n\nGet in touch to find out how we can help with your YouTube marketing strategy: stuart@navigatevideo.com"
