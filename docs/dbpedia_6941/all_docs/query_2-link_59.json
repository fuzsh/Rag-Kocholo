        "text": "Rishi Sunak is facing fresh pressure over his decision to skip part of the D-Day commemorations in Normandy after he blamed the events for making him late for an interview with ITV.\n\nHis decision to leave Normandy after the UK-focused events were finished, leaving Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron to participate in the international events, led to significant backlash last week with many fearing he had hurt his party’s chances in the election.\n\nIt has now emerged that the Prime Minister expected to get back to the UK earlier.\n\nIn the programme, which will air this evening, it is revealed that Sunak opened the interview by telling ITV’s UK editor and host Paul Brand: “Sorry to have kept you,” adding that the D-Day events “all just ran over”.\n\nThe Prime Minister then described the occasion as “incredible” and repeated that “it just ran over”, adding: “Apologies for keeping you.”\n\nMr Sunak went on to say he met “lots” of veterans over two days of commemorations and that he “already spoke to almost everyone that was there, I hope”.\n\nBut the revelation that he apologised for being late for the interview, even after leaving D-Day events early, risks reigniting the row that led to him apologising on Friday and being forced to rule out resigning before election day.\n\nMr Sunak has since repeatedly apologised for leaving the commemorations in Normandy “after the conclusion of the British event”. He said: “On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer – and I apologise.”\n\nDefence Secretary Grant Shapps denied on Wednesday morning that the Prime Minister had been “completely tone deaf” over his decision to leave the D-Day events early.\n\nHe told Sky News that “he was there meeting British veterans” and that the part he skipped “had no British veterans at it at all”.\n\n“He has rightly, I think, issued his apology for it,” Mr Shapps continued.\n\n“We can carry on going round and round in circles. I think the more interesting thing is, what does he really think about our veterans? What is his actual belief in this?”\n\n“And he is a Prime Minister who has from day one of his administration had a veterans’ minister in his own Cabinet. I don’t recall a time when we have had a veterans’ minister sit in the Cabinet in order to promote all the interests of veterans.”\n\nElsewhere in the ITV Tonight interview, Sunak faced questions about his background, and was asked if he was in touch with ordinary people’s struggles and if he ever went without anything as a child.\n\nThe Prime Minister replied: “There’ll be all sorts of things that I would have wanted as a kid that I couldn’t have. Right? Famously Sky TV, so that was something that we never had growing up actually, but it was lots of things.”\n\nSunak also batted away questions about Nigel Farage, whose Reform party is threatening to steal votes from the Tories, and who some of the Prime Minister’s own candidates have urged him to bring under the party’s umbrella.\n\n“I really don’t know him,” Sunak said. “I think I’ve met him maybe once in my life. I don’t know him.”\n\nResponding to the early excerpts of the interview, Labour’s shadow Paymaster General Jonathan Ashworth, said: “No one will believe any of Rishi Sunak’s promises. He has failed to provide any credible savings to fund his desperate wish list. The money simply is not there.\n\n“All Rishi Sunak offers is five more years of chaos and £4,800 more on family mortgages.”"
