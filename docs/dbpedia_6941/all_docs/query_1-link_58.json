King Lear Synopsis It is the night of a lunar eclipse in Celtic Britain and the aging King Lear has decided to relinquish his royal throne and divide his kingdom between his three daughters, Goneril, Regan and Cordelia. His surprise stipulation is that each daughter must prove her love to him by public declaration in order to receive her third of his land and power. Goneril, the oldest, speaks first, declaring that she loves Lear “dearer than eye-sight, space and liberty…No less than life.” Regan continues the flattery, adding, “I am alone felicitate in your dear highness’ love.” Lear then asks Cordelia, the youngest and his favorite, “what can you say to win a third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.” Cordelia, indignant at having to prove her Lear considers love and refusing to flatter her father, proclaims “I love your Majesty accord- ing to my bond, no more nor less.” Her father urges her to mend her speech Kent’s advice “lest you mar your fortunes” but she says she cannot. treasonous and Unjustly enraged, Lear withdraws his offer to give Cordelia her share of his realm. His longtime ally the Earl of Kent implores his king to reconsider, banishes him on but Lear is steadfast. He calls forth the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall, hus- bands of Goneril and Regan, and passes his coronet to them, investing them threat of death. jointly with his power, and says that he will alternate living in their house- holds. Kent again urges Lear to reconsider but his loyalty and sound advice are ignored; Lear declares Kent’s advice treasonous and banishes him on threat of death. Lear has called for the King of France and the Duke of Burgundy, both long-time suitors of the now impoverished Cordelia. He offers Cordelia first to Burgundy but, without the dowry of land, as previously agreed; the duke declines. Acknowledging Cordelia’s discredit, Lear then beseeches France to “direct your liking a more worthier way than on a wretch whom Nature is ashamed almost to acknowledge hers.” France, however, is impressed by Cordelia's steadfastness and says that he considers Lear’s youngest daughter “herself a dowry.” He takes her as Queen of France, explaining, “Thy dower- less daughter, King, thrown to my chance, is Queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.” Lear’s court exits, leaving behind Regan, Goneril, France, and Cordelia who entreats her sisters to “Love well our father: to your professed bosoms I commit him.” France and Cordelia exit. Later that night, as the eclipse wanes, Edmund, bastard son of the Earl of Gloucester, vows to himself to secure the land his father has given to his legit- imate son Edgar. His scheme involves a clumsy attempt to hide a letter from 5\n\n6. Gloucester that was supposedly written by his half-brother Edgar. Falling into Edmund’s trap, Gloucester demands to see the letter. Edmund’s forgery of his brother’s hand states that Edgar believes their aging father should turn over his fortune to his sons and let them manage his affairs. Gloucester is enraged, but Edmund calms him. Later, Edmund warns Edgar that he is in trouble with their father, “Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him.” After Edgar’s departure, the wily Edmund reflects on his situation which he believes is soon to change in his favor: “Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit.” At Goneril’s house on a subsequent day, she accuses her father of disruptive behavior and instructs her steward, Oswald, to act coldly towards Lear and his knights. Meanwhile, the banished Kent arrives, disguised as a servant, intend- ing to continue to be of service to Lear, behind the scenes. “Now, banished Kent, if thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned, so may it come, my mas- ter, whom though lov’st shall find thee full of labours.” Lear demands to see Goneril, but she instructs Oswald to say she is ill; Lear’s Fool jeers at him for giving his lands to his unappreciative daughters. Finally, Goneril enters and begins arguing with her father about an outbreak of The banished quarrelling and rioting in his retinue of 100 men, accusing him of protecting the miscreants and being too old to keep his knights in order. Furious, Lear leaves, Kent arrives proclaiming to Albany, Goneril’s husband, “How sharper than a serpent’s tooth disguised as a it is to have a thankless child!” Lear vows to take refuge at Regan’s, declaring “I have another daughter, servant, who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable,” unaware that Goneril is at that moment intending to writing to her sister. That night, at Gloucester's castle, Edmund convinces Edgar that he is in dan- continue to be ger and urges him to flee: “My father hath set guard to take my brother…O Sir! of service to Fly this place.” Edmund then wounds himself to make it look as if Edgar has attacked him. Gloucester, misguidedly thankful for Edmund's support, vows to Lear, behind capture Edgar and reward Edmund. the scenes. Meanwhile Regan and Cornwall arrive to discuss their ensuing war against Lear, using Gloucester’s dispute with his son as fuel. Edgar is accused of being a companion of Lear’s riotous knights. Regan vows that if Lear “come to sojourn at my house, I’ll not be there.” In the predawn hours, Kent arrives at Gloucester's with a message from Lear and meets Oswald (whom Kent dislikes and mistrusts) who is carrying a mes- sage from Goneril. Kent attacks Oswald, but Cornwall and Regan break up the fight and Cornwall puts Kent in the stocks. Gloucester tries to intervene, “Pray, do not, Sir,” replies Kent. While all this is ensuing, Edgar decides he must flee and disguise himself as a beggar for his own safety. 6\n\n7. Lear now arrives, and finds Kent in the stocks. At first, Regan and Cornwall refuse to see her father claiming fatigue from the night’s travels. Finally, they agree to see Lear, and Regan chides him to the brink, telling him that he “should be ruled and led” and encouraging him to return to Goneril’s. Soon, Goneril arrives and together the sisters admonish Lear for his behavior, accusing him of weakness; they push Lear to the brink of sanity, and he comments, “I gave you all…made you my guardians…” Lear, in a rage, leaves Gloucester’s castle and sets out into a building storm. Gloucester is concerned for his safety, but Kent cautions Cornwall urges him to “Shut up your doors my Lord; ‘tis a wild night…come out o’th’storm.” Lear to show Gloucester complains to Edmund that Lear’s daughters and their husbands patience with have commandeered his home for their own use and “charged me, on pain of perpetual displeasure, neither to speak of him [Lear], entreat from him, or any his daughters, way sustain him.” But Gloucester vows to search for his old master even if it costs him his life. and Edgar, in On the Heath, Lear and the Fool are buffeted by the raging storm when Kent an aside, takes arrives, still in disguise. He finds shelter for the King, whose sanity is faltering —“My wits begin to turn.” Lear refuses to enter. Unexpectedly, Edgar, disguised pity on the as Poor Tom, a madman, comes out of the hovel. Recognizing the King and his old king. Fool, Poor Tom engages the men but Lear sees only references to his daughters in Tom’s rages and begins tearing off his clothes. The group sees an approach- ing torch and Kent calls out for the man to identify himself. It is Gloucester who has arrived. He entreats Lear to enter the hut explaining, “My duty cannot obey your daughters’ hard commands to bar my doors…I have ventured to come seek you out and bring you where both fire and food is ready.” Back at Gloucester’s, Cornwall tells Edmund that he will seek revenge against Gloucester for his sympathy for Lear. Cornwall urges Edmund to betray his father, claiming, “though shalt find a dearer father in my love.” During the night, Gloucester has brought Lear, Edgar (as Poor Tom) and the Fool to an isolated farmhouse. Lear, half- mad, continues his rant against his daughters, prosecuting them in a mock trial. Kent cautions Lear to show patience with his daughters, and Edgar, in an aside, takes pity on the old king. Gloucester urges Kent to immediately take Lear to Dover, where protection awaits him. “If though should’st dally half an hour, his life…stand[s] in assured loss.” Together, they leave for Dover. Meanwhile, the storm is blowing itself out and Cornwall, Regan, Goneril and Edmund return to Gloucester’s house with their servants. Cornwall tells Goneril that an army from France has landed at Dover, and tells his knights to seek out the traitor Gloucester. Goneril says to pluck out his eyes. Cornwall takes his leave and tells Edmund, who is now calling himself Earl of Gloucester, 7\n\n8. to say behind. “The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding.” Gloucester, now a prisoner, is returned to his home where he is interrogated about his alleged treason and his loyalty to “the lunatic king.” Cornwall savage- ly plucks out Gloucester’s eyes. Blinded, Gloucester calls out to his son Edmund for mercy but Regan exclaims, “Thou call’st on him that hates thee; it was he that made the overture of thy treasons to us.” Gloucester is turned out of his home, but is followed by two servants who plan to help him. On the Heath the following morning, Goneril’s servant leads Gloucester to the farmhouse and comes upon Poor Tom (Edgar). Gloucester sends the servant away and asks Tom to lead him to the edge of the high cliffs at Dover. That afternoon, Edmund pledges his loyalty and love to Goneril. When her husband Albany learns that the daughters have mistreated their father (Lear) he lashes out at Goneril, “You are not worth the dust which the rude wind blows in A French your face,” Their conversation is interrupted by a messenger who brings news that Cornwall is dead from a fatal jab he received from a protesting knight dur- knight and ing his savage attack on Gloucester. Albany, feeling sorry for Gloucester and some com- learning of Edmund's treachery with his wife, vows revenge. At a French camp near Dover, Cordelia sends out a sentry to find her errant rades approach father. That night, at Regan’s nearby encampment, Regan shares her concerns and, finding with Oswald (who has delivered a letter to the encampment) that her sister might be in love with Edmund, whom Regan (now a widow) would like to marry. “My Lear, try to Lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk’d and more convenient is he for my hand convince him than for your Lady’s.” In the countryside near Dover, Edgar describes the perilous drop off the cliff to go to to the blind Gloucester who jumps, thinking he will die. In fact, he falls but a Cordelia, but short distance. Realizing he is alive, Gloucester cries out, “Alack, I have no eyes. Is wretchedness deprived that benefit to endself by death?” Now telling Lear runs away. Gloucester he is a beggar, Edgar helps his father up. Lear, now fully mad, approaches and speaks to them. Gloucester recognizes Lear’s voice. A French knight and some comrades approach and, finding Lear, try to convince him to go to Cordelia, but Lear runs away. Oswald comes across Edgar and Gloucester and threatens to kill them. Edgar, though, kills Oswald in a fight; he then discovers a letter that proves that Goneril plans to murder Albany and marry Edmund. “O indistinguish’d space of woman’s will! A plot upon her virtuous husband’s life; and the exchange my brother!” Edgar takes Gloucester’s hand and leads him away. At the French camp near Dover, Kent, who has continued to serve as Lear’s protector, and Cordelia discuss Lear’s condition with a doctor. When Lear 8\n\n9. awakes, he seems saner than before and recognizes his formerly favorite daugh- ter. Lear questions whether or not Cordelia has plans to poison him, “I know you do not love me; for your sisters have, as I do remember, done me wrong: You have some cause, they have not.” That night at the British camp near Dover, Regan interrogates Edmund about his possible love for her sister. “Dear my lord, be not familiar with her.” Goneril and Albany enter. Albany tells them that Lear is with Cordelia. Goneril says the sisters and their forces must band together to battle Cordelia and the French troops. Still disguised, Edgar pulls Albany aside and presents a letter that he believes will change the course of action. Edmund enters, soliloquizing to Trying to make himself about having pledged his love to both sisters. If Albany is killed in bat- up for some tle, both sisters will be widows.

Lear emerges, carrying the body of Cordelia in his arms, and cries out “A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all.” Grief stricken, he dies. The future of his kingdom rests in the hands of Albany, the aging Kent, and Edgar. 9\n\n10. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) nly a small collection of documents about the O life of William Shakespeare has come down through the centuries to us, but available materials state that he was born in 1564 and grew up in Stratford-upon-Avon, a prosperous English market town in the county of Warwickshire northwest of London. His father, John Shakespeare, was a glove maker and a prominent citizen of Stratford who eventually held the position of mayor. No known sur- viving formal records of the playwright’s life exist dating from the time between his christening in 1564 at Stratford’s Holy Trinity Church and his marriage in 1582 to Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior. The couple’s daughter Susannah was born six months after their wedding, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, were born in 1585. How Shakespeare sup- ported himself in his early adulthood and when or why he left Stratford for the London theatrical world have been the subject of much scholarly speculation. By 1592, Shakespeare had achieved some promi- nence in London both as an actor and as an author, especially of history plays; he also had published a long narrative poem, The Rape of Lucrece. The Portrait of Shakespeare, circa 1610. Taming of the Shrew (circa 1593) gained him further recognition. By about this time he also had become a member of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, a theatre company (renamed the King’s Men during the reign of James I which began in 1603) of which he was a principal actor, playwright and shareholder for the next 20 years. In 1598, Shakespeare’s company was evicted from its playhouse and then built the Globe Theatre in South London near the Thames River. It was at the Globe that Shakespeare produced his most famous tragedies: Hamlet (1600), Othello (circa 1604), Macbeth (1606), and King Lear (circa 1606). The first performances of Antony and Photo of William Shakespeare’s birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. 10\n\n11. Cleopatra, Coriolanus, and Timon of Athens most likely occurred during 1607 and 1608. Late in his life, Shakespeare produced a series of plays—including Cymbeline (circa 1609), The Winter’s Tale (circa 1610), and The Tempest (1612)— to which scholars have attached different labels; sometimes these have been referred to as “tragicomedies,” but in recent years they have most usually been described as “romances.” In 1613, the Globe Theatre caught fire and burned to the ground. About this time, Shakespeare returned to Stratford, where his wife and children still lived. (Like the playwright’s early years, this move has long been the subject of extensive scholarly conjecture.) Made financially prosperous by his years in the theatre, he died a wealthy Stratford landowner at age 52, in 1616, and is buried in the same Stratford church where he had been christened. Although many of Shakespeare’s plays were extremely popular in England during the playwright’s life- time, it was not until the 18th century—more than 100 years after his death—that his work began to exert a major influence internationally. His plays now are produced Model of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre worldwide more than those of any other dramatist. Since the mid-19th century, it has occasionally been argued that someone else of nobler lineage and greater education must have written his works, because some have found it inconceivable that a man of modest family background and only a grammar school education could have written the 37 masterpieces credited to Shakespeare. Nevertheless, the literary canon which every season is celebrated by theatrical companies worldwide continues to bear his name, as do Shakespeare festivals all around the English-speaking parts of the globe. 11\n\n12. Shakespeare’s Lear he first recorded performance of King Lear by William Shakespeare was on T December 26, 1606, before King James I at Whitehall in London. There has been much disagreement, however, about exactly when Shakespeare wrote the tragedy many have judged his greatest masterpiece. Although some think Lear may have been created as early as 1604, most scholars now believe that Lear was written in 1605 or 1606. Natural events support the later date; in the play, Gloucester refers to eclipses of the sun and moon, and such eclipses actually occurred in Britain in September and October 1605. Long before Shakespeare wrote his account of the struggles and madness of Lear, the story had appeared in pre-Roman English folklore and fairytales as King Lyr, or Ler. The tale was included in Raphael Holinshed’s Chronicles (published Cover of First Folio edition of Shakespeare’s works published in 1623. 12\n\n13. 1577, 1587) and in John Higgins’s A Mirror for Magistrates (1574). An anony- mous play, The Chronicle History of King Leir, was written sometime in the 1500s and published in 1605, and Shakespeare is very likely to have been famil- iar with it. Shakespeare’s Lear first appeared in print as The True Chronicle of the History of the Life and Death of King Lear and His Three Daughters, published in quarto in 1608. A more theatrical version of the text, The Tragedy of King Lear, appeared in 1623 in the First Folio, the first published collection of Shakespeare’s plays. Over the centuries, these two early editions of King Lear have frequently been combined into one edition, although many modern schol- ars and editors posit that each version has its individual integrity. In 1681, Shakespeare’s King Lear was eclipsed by a new adaptation written by Nahum Tate, an Irish poet and writer for the stage who created a popular series of versions of Elizabethan dramas. In his retelling of Lear, Tate eliminated the character of the Fool and the blinding of Gloucester and he created a happy ending for the story by marrying Cordelia and Edgar and restor- ing Lear to his throne. In that era, the populace did not necessarily regard the integrity of dramatic material as particularly essential, which may help to explain why many critics and audiences applauded Tate’s adaptation. His reworked King Lear was praised by Samuel Johnson, one of England’s most influential 18th century literary commentators, and acted by esteemed performers of the Georgian period including David Garrick; it was also a famous vehicle for Edmund Kean. It wasn’t until the mid–19th century that Shakespeare’s account of King Lear was restored to the British stage with a production staring actor William Charles Macready. Now, more than 400 years later, Shakespeare’s presentation of the King of Britain, his three Cover of a version of King Lear as adapted by Nahum Tate in 1681. daughters, and the strife he unleashes when he gives up his royal power, is regarded increasingly by scholars and critics as one of the greatest of all theatri- cal achievements. Despite being perhaps the most bleak and pessimistic of his tragedies, its psychological complexities speak directly to the modern audience and contem- porary sensibilities. 13\n\n14. Shakespeare’s Sources for King Lear opular commentators and academic experts around the world have P celebrated Shakespeare’s genius for 400 years. Yet theatre audiences do not often realize that the most esteemed playwright in world history, whom they adore for his great dramatic plots and poetic language, was in fact a very liber- al borrower from a variety of sources. A significant portion of Shakespeare’s true greatness does not exist in the originality of his stories, which he typically derived and reconstructed, but rather is due to his artistic transformation–through language and character development–of materials by Scholars have earlier authors masterfully conscripted for his own use. The Tragedy of King recognized in Lear is a perfect example of Shakespeare’s inspired adaptation of sources, and also typifies his skill in employing older elements to create works of dramatic Lear’s motif of art which completely overshadow their originals in craftsmanship and brilliance. three sisters, two Numerous early versions of the basic Lear story existed hundreds of years before Shakespeare’s play was written in the early seventeenth century, and this of whom are evil has caused frustration for scholars seeking to answer the sphinx-like riddle of exactly which sources Shakespeare had on hand when composing his work. In and one who is King Lear, for example, the general theme of filial ingratitude and the contrast good, affinities between the treatment of their aged parents by good and selfish children are common features found in ancient tales from Asian tradition. The motif of a love between the play test as a basis for the division of a parent’s property comes from European folk- lore, several variants developing a tale in which a daughter first tells her father and the fairy tale that she loves him as much as salt, and then dissipates his anger by demonstrat- of Cinderella. ing that this means he is essential to her life. Scholars have also recognized in Lear’s motif of three sisters, two of whom are evil and one who is good, affini- ties between the play and the fairy tale of Cinderella. The name “Lear” itself appears to originate in Celtic tradition, with characters called Ler, Leir or Lyr. The earliest extant written down version of the Lear story–one that Shakespeare could have known—is the Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain), a work composed in Latin by Geoffrey of Monmouth (c. 1100-c. 1155), a twelfth-century monk and historian. In this text, a pseudo-his- torical figure called Leir, eleventh king of the Britons and legendary founder of the city of Leicester, plans to divide his kingdom among his three daughters —Gonorilla, Regau and Cordeilla–who are put to a verbal test and given rule over their father’s land according to their relative professions of affection. The youngest daughter, when she refuses to flatter her father, is disinherited and afterwards marries the king of the Franks. No English translation of this work was available in Shakespeare’s day, but he might have read it in its original Latin or, just as likely, received the story as it was retold by numerous later writers 14 who borrowed from the Historia. For example, Geoffrey’s work forms the basis\n\n15. of two verse romance chronicles which retell the Lear story: the Anglo-Norman Roman de Brut (1155) by Wace—translated into English by William Caxton before Shakespeare’s time—and Brut by Layamon, one of the first major texts written in Middle English. Three centuries later, the Lear story was again briefly retold by John Hardyng in his Chronicles (1436), but it was a renewed interest in the story by In the 1574 Tudor chroniclers and versifiers of the next century that gave the tale truly wide- spread circulation. Obviously, such more contemporary sources have greater edition of A probability of having been familiar to Shakespeare. For example, the story of Lear was recounted by Robert Fabyan in his New Chronicles of England and Mirror for France (1516), and it appears as well in Polydore Vergil’s Anglicae Historiae Magistrates, (1534), a work which introduces Cordilla’s argument for transferring her pri- mary devotion from her father to her husband after marriage–a detail which also a verse appears in Shakespeare’s version. Later, elements from both Hardyng and Fabyan were appropriated by John Stow in his Summarie of Englyshe biography of Chronicles (1563) and Annales (1592). various figures In the 1574 edition of A Mirror for Magistrates, a verse biography of vari- ous figures from English history, John Higgins reiterated the tale of Leire as from English part of a collection of early legends of Britain. In Higgins’s version, which history, John draws upon Geoffrey of Monmouth as a primary source and contains many sim- ilar details, the dead Cordilla provides a first-person narrative account–in the Higgins retold form of a verse complaint—of her disinheritance and the subsequent disgrace the tale of Leire inflicted on her father by her sisters. Eventually, Leire comes to France and requests his estranged daughter’s assistance. Once reconciled, Cordilla aids him as part of a in reestablishing his rule for three years and, after Leire dies, she rules the coun- try for five additional years—until the sons of Gonerell and Ragan imprison her collection of in a dungeon, eventually leading her to commit suicide in despair. early legends Other possible sources for the play are William Warner’s Albion’s England (1586), a long verse chronicle containing a version of the Lear story, as well as of Britain. the 1587 second edition of Raphael Holinshed’s Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Wales, a work which Shakespeare clearly used as a staple source not only for King Lear, but also for Macbeth, Cymbeline and several of his English history plays. It was not until 1590, with the publication of two of the most famous English Renaissance poems—Edmund Spenser’s The Fairie Queene and Sir Philip Sidney’s The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia—that plausible antecedents for Shakespeare’s play represent literary and artistic modes rather than histori- cal writing. This is also where it becomes possible that Shakespeare becomes the source for subsequent works dealing with the story, in the view of some scholars. 15\n\n16. Book II of Spenser’s unfinished epic allegory celebrates the virtue of Temperance in the character of a knight named Sir Guyon. In Canto X, Sir Guyon reads a “chronicle of Briton kings” while sojourning at the House of Alma. This seven-stanza section of the lengthy epic is notable especially for the mode of Cordelia’s death; it is in Spenser that, for the first time known, the man- There is no ner of her death is specified as being through hanging, by her own hand. Sidney’s work is also notable for being a primary source for the secondary doubt that Gloucester plot in King Lear. One episode in Book II is set in “a certain hollow rocke” where the two main characters are compelled to take shelter from the hail Shakespeare and wind of a “tempests furie.” There, they encounter a king who has been alien- freely adapted ated from his legitimate son by the false accusation of his bastard son–who has usurped his father’s title and blinded him. Subsequently, the rightful son, some language described as “poorely arayed” and “extreamely weather-beaten,” rescues his and plot details father and prevents him from committing suicide by leaping from a cliff. The single most important and immediate source for the main plot of of an earlier Shakespeare’s tragedy, however, is The True Chronicle Historie of King Leir and play to his own his Three Daughters: Gonorill, Ragan, and Cordella, a chronicle play (author unknown) published in 1605 (although there is evidence that it was performed ends, making it by the Queen’s Men before 1594). Because this play draws upon many of the same historical sources that Shakespeare may have used independently for his superior. own work, the problem of scholarly attribution is tangled. There is no doubt that Shakespeare freely adapted some language and plot details of the earlier play to his own ends, making it superior. However, unlike Shakespeare’s play, King Leir features a prevalent Christian emphasis. Another major difference is the fact that the king and Cordella do not die in Leir but survive and live happily. The king goes off with his companions at the conclusion, leaving Cordella to reign in his place. Her two sisters—called Gonorill and Ragan—also do not die, but instead become fugitives. Two important features in Shakespeare’s play, the parallel plot of Gloucester and the character of the Fool, do not appear in Leir. For the mad verbiage Edgar employs when disguised as Poor Tom O’Bedlam, Shakespeare may have been indebted to a work published in 1603 by Samuel Harsnett (1561-1631). Harsnett was Chaplain to the Bishop of London and later became Archdeacon of Essex and subsequently Archbishop of York. His tract A Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures is a detailed account of several heretical exorcisms conducted by Roman Catholic priests in England during 1585-86. In Shakespearean Negotiations, Stephen Greenblatt notes that Shakespeare appropriated from Harsnett “the names of the foul fiends by whom Edgar . . . claims to be possessed” as well as “some of the language of madness, several of the attributes of hell and a number of colorful adjectives.” In the same year that Harsnett’s work was published, two other possible 16 sources for Shakespeare’s play also emerged, namely John Florio’s translation of\n\n17. Michel de Montaigne’s Essais and an account of the highly publicized court case in October involving Sir Brian Annesley. Scholars have noted that more than one hundred words from Florio’s translation do not appear anywhere in Shakespeare’s writing before King Lear, and that two of Montaigne's famous essays, “Of Solitariness” and “An Apology for Raymond Sebonde,” apparently refer to themes similar to those which Shakespeare's deals with in Lear. In the lawsuit involving Annesley, an ex-servant of Queen Elizabeth I who owned a valuable estate in Kent, the eldest of his three daughters, Lady Grace Wildgoose, attempted to have her father certified as incompetent so that she and her hus- band could take over the management of his affairs. Although the role played by Annesley’s second daughter in the affair is unknown, his youngest daughter, Cordell, opposed the malevolent designs of her elder sisters by appealing to Sir A discontented Robert Cecil. observer, the The Annesley case, moreover, does not stand alone as a possible legal histo- ry source of themes expressed by Shakespeare’s play. Another case involved Sir malcontent is William Allen, Lord Mayor of London from 1571-72. Growing old and frail, often a Allen decided to divide his estates and wealth between his three married daugh- ters, arranging to stay with each in turn. The trio eventually resented the charge melancholic of his upkeep and argued that Allen was rude to their servants. After cursing his anti-hero with a daughters for their mistreatment of him, Allen died in misery. Yet one more literary and dramatic source for King Lear may be the work of dark, sarcastic John Marston (1576-1634), the English poet, playwright and satirist. Some view of life. scholars have identified the mad speeches of Lear as being influenced by Marston’s book of satires, The Scourge of Villanie (1598), but more important- ly they have seen his play The Malcontent (1604) as a source for the saturnine personality and psychology of Edmund. The malcontent, a character type which frequently appears in Renaissance drama, stands apart from the society sur- rounding him, usually having separated himself by choice. A discontented observer, the malcontent is often a melancholic anti-hero with a dark, sarcastic view of life. In Edmund’s case, it should be noted in fairness, this separation is not only by nature but also due to illegitimate birth. While the quest to unearth Shakespeare’s sources provides much interesting material for study and research, it is often a difficult and inconclusive endeavor resulting in more questions than solutions. The same evidence can point to opposing interpretations. King Lear is by no means an exception to the typical problem of identifying the originals of Shakespeare’s work, and is perhaps an indication of the playwright’s genius by showing how he combined elements from a wide variety of previous authors. Ultimately, for the true lover of dramat- ic art, the products of Shakespeare’s craft usually soar above any of his histori- cal or literary sources, and their excellence far surpasses the quality of the raw 17 materials the playwright exploited for their composition.\n\n18.

Most The names of many official jesters in the courts scholars believe that the first actor to play the role of of Europe are preserved in historical records. In Lear’s Fool was Robert Armin, a member of England, the long list of jesters extends from Hitard, Shakespeare’s company who wrote Foole upon the fool of Edmund Ironside (ruled 934-46) to Foole (1600), a pamphlet which tells us a great deal Muckle John, the fool of Charles I (ruled 1625- about jesters in the Elizabethan age. 1649) who was the last official royal jester.

The Fool has been the play. After envisioning the Fool as a “sort of performed as a saucy adolescent knave, a rustic fragile, hectic, beautiful-faced boy,” Macready set- tled on a woman in the role. 20\n\n21. because Lear’s Fool is such a major char- acter in the play, his purpose goes beyond that of a minor comic foil to the course of tragic events. In Lear’s jester, we see the paradox of the “wise fool.” Although he makes his liv- ing by witty speeches and comic behavior, the Fool’s primary role in the play is that of a speaker of unpleasant truths. In this sense, he is not so much the provider of merry interludes that we–and Lear–antici- pate, but instead he is a “bitter fool” who enlightens the king about the harsh facts of the world. Goneril refers to him as an “all- licens’d Fool,” meaning that he is afforded the broad freedom to do and say what he likes in the presence of his betters. Even so, his biting speeches and acid commen- tary on Lear’s rash behavior–and on the disrespect of their father by Goneril and Regan–readily result in threats of the whip. Countering the expectations of his master to be a light-hearted court enter- tainer, the Fool maintains his diplomatic distance by speaking in oblique riddles, catch phrases, proverbs and snatches of song–yet his best efforts continually skirt the risk of being incendiary. Tom Derry and Muckle John The word “fool” appears 49 times in King Lear, Shakespeare undoubtedly had a well-considered more frequently than in any other Shakespeare play purpose for including Lear’s Fool in the play, and theexcept for Twelfth Night.

On one level, the Fool functions as Lear’s con- science after he disowns Cordelia for being honest in lieu of the false vows of Goneril and Regan. It could be argued that the Fool not only points out Lear’s folly and change in sovereign status, but that his lucid insight also spurs Lear on to the harsh real- ization of “filial ingratitude” that accelerates the king’s spiraling madness. Scholars have often been troubled by the fact that the Fool disappears barely halfway throughout the play. However, perhaps Shakespeare at this point considered the Fool no longer dramatically neces- sary, Lear having learned the hard way the necessary lesson about loving devotion versus sycophantic lip service that the Fool sought so earnestly to teach. The advent of Edgar in the assumed guise of the mad Poor Tom O’Bedlam, in a sense, replaces and overshadows the madcap musings of Lear’s court fool. Most importantly, Lear’s madness gains full force after the Fool disappears; the king can handle no more instruction concerning his rash actions, thereby rendering the Fool’s presence superfluous. Because the Fool remains an enigmatic character even in his exit, there have been various methods of portraying his disappearance from the stage. Some interpretations have included the Fool cravenly 22\n\n23. The Celtic Era A Pictorial Album One of the most popular schools of thought regarding the Celtic calendar maintains that the year was divided into thirteen months. This theory, developed by Robert Graves, argues that the months corre- sponded to the vowels of the Ogham or Celtic tree alphabet. Represented (clockwise from top) are the birch, rowan, ash, alder, willow, hawthorn, oak, holly, hazel, vine, ivy, reed and elder. 23\n\n24. During the final stages of the Iron Age (c. 6th century B.C.), the La Tène culture gradually trans- formed into the explicitly Celtic culture of early historical times. The original Celtic homeland flourished in parts of what is now France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Over the next few centuries, the Celts migrated into modern-day Britain, Ireland, Spain, northern Italy and Greece. To the east, the Celts spread as far as Turkey and the Ukraine. “Plate sin with gold, / And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks” —King Lear IV.6.

The previous works you have directed for Kansas City Rep are very diverse and yet each of them raises questions about how individuals, be they private citizens or religious and political figures, respond to societal issues.
