He now lives with the Mouri family while solving crimes.\n\nThe comic has exceeded 270 million copies, and an anime television series premiered in 1996.\n\nAnimated feature films, starting with \"Detective Conan: The Time Bombed Skyscraper\" (1997), have also been produced annually. The latest, \"The Million Dollar Pentagram,\" will be released in April 2024.\n\nThis article is for fans planning a Conan-themed trip, with a selection of eight recommended spots to visit. Don't miss the information about the new movie at the end!\n\nDetective Conan: 8 Locations Related to the Story\n\n1. Gosho Aoyama Manga Factory in Tottori\n\n2.

This facility, located in his hometown, opened in 2007. It is situated next to a roadside station (*), and the admission fee is 700 yen for adults.\n\nMr. Aoyama's personal history, copies of original drawings, and an exhibition where visitors can take photographs with 3D images of the characters are displayed inside.\n\nThere is also Conan Street in Hokuei, so taking a walk after visiting the factory might be fun.\n\n*Roadside station: a roadside facility furnished with markets, eateries, and restrooms.\n\nGosho Aoyama Manga Factory\n\nAddress: Tottori, Tohaku, Hokuei, Yurashuku 1414\n\nBusiness Hours: 9:30-17:30\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.gamf.jp/english/\n\n2.

Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo\n\nThe Rainbow Bridge, which connects the districts of Shibaura and Odaiba in Tokyo's Minato City, appears in the anime film \"Zero the Enforcer\" (2018).\n\nIn the movie, an intergovernmental forum will be held in the Tokyo Bay area. An explosion goes off, and Kogoro Mouri, the heroine's father, is arrested. But Kogoro was framed by Tohru Amuro.\n\nAmuro did it so that Conan would investigate the case. In the end, he faces the fact that the Public Service Bureau, an organization to which he belongs, was the cause of the incident.\n\nPhoto by Pixta\n\nTohru Amuro is a popular character. In fact, Tohru Furuya, the voice actor, played Amuro Ray in Mobile Suit Gundam. The name Tohru Amuro was made up of Amuro Ray and Tohru Furuya.\n\nIn the movie, Amuro crosses the Rainbow Bridge riding a Matsuda FD RX-7.\n\nThere is a walkway on the bridge, so those who feel fit enough should try crossing it on foot instead of riding the Yurikamome Line.\n\nRainbow Bridge\n\nLocated in Tokyo's Minato City\n\nOfficial Website https://www.shutoko.co.jp/en/index/driving/explore/rainbowbridge/\n\n4. Ebisu Garden Place in Tokyo\n\nPicture courtesy of Amazon\n\n\"The Time Bombed Skyscraper\" (1997) was the first anime film produced after the television series gained popularity.\n\nThe plot revolves around the lovers, Shinichi Kudo (Conan) and Ran Mouri, a day before Shinichi's birthday. Trying to stop a series of bombing incidents, they head for the Beika City Building, where an inferno is raging.\n\nPhoto by Pixta\n\nIt is said that Ebisu Garden Place inspired the design of the Beika City Building. Ran believed that she and Shinichi were meant for each other, and this belief prevented another bomb detonation. Ebisu Garden Place is a spot to enjoy that romantic feeling.\n\nIn the television series episode aired on January 12, 2019, Ran and Shinichi officially became lovers, and fans commented on Twitter (X).\n\nEbisu Garden Place\n\nAddress: Tokyo, Shibuya, Ebisu 4-20\n\nBusiness Hours: 8:00-22:00 (The time varies by the shops.)\n\nOfficial Website: https://gardenplace.jp\n\n5. Kasai Rinkai Park in Tokyo\n\nCompared to other films, \"The Darkest Nightmare\" (2016) is filled with action scenes.\n\nThe main characters, Tohru Amuro (Public Service Bureau) and Shuichi Akai (FBI) try to hunt down an undercover agent in the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nA female character pursued by Amuro and Akai arrives at Tohto Aquarium. There is a Ferris wheel at the facility, which many fans believe was inspired by Kasai Rinkai Park.\n\nPhoto by Pixta\n\nAkai once infiltrated the Black Organization, posing as Rye. His partner happened to be Amuro, who was called Bourbon. Amuro strongly despises Akai, so there is tension between the two.\n\nThe name Shuichi Akai, as is the case with Tohru Amuro, has an interesting backstory.\n\nShuichi Ikeda, the voice actor of Akai, played Char Aznable in Mobile Suit Gundam. Char's nickname was \"akai suisei\" (red comet), so this character became Shuichi Akai.\n\nThere is an aquarium and a Ferris wheel in the vast grounds of Kasai Rinkai Park, where visitors can have fun all day.\n\nKasai Rinkai Park\n\nAddress: Tokyo, Edogawa, Rinkai, Roku-chome\n\nThe park is open year-round\n\nOfficial Website: https://honyaku.j-server.com/LUCTMPA/ns/tl.cgi/https://www.tokyo-park.or.jp/park/kasairinkai/index.html?SLANG=ja&TLANG=en&XMODE=0&XJSID=0\n\n6. Hachijo Island in Tokyo\n\n\"Black Iron Submarine\" (2023) is about Ai Haibara (Sherry), who fled the Black Organization. The film is set on the island of Hachijo-jima Island, Tokyo.\n\nIn this thriller, the facial recognition system employed by Pacific Buoy, a facility off the island coast, is used to hunt Haibara.\n\nPhoto by Pixta\n\nHachijo-jima is one of the nine isles in the Izu Islands, off the south coast of Tokyo. Contrary to its location, the islands are administratively a part of Tokyo.\n\nVisitors can enjoy marine activities, such as snorkeling, diving, SUP, and surfing on the island.\n\nHachijo-jima\n\nAddress: Tokyo, Hachijo-jima, Hachijo.\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.hachijo.gr.jp\n\n7. Togetsukyo Bridge and Arashiyama in Kyoto\n\nIn \"The Crimson Love Letter\" (2017) set in Kyoto, Conan and Heiji Hattori are drawn into a case that involves Hyakunin Isshu.\n\nHyakunin Isshu, an anthology of 100 waka (poem) by 100 poets, became popular in the 16th century after being used in a karuta (card) game.\n\nPhoto by Pixta\n\nWhile the Togetsukyo Bridge only appears briefly in the movie, the main theme song is titled \"Togetsukyo: Kimi Omou.\" The song is sung by Mai Kuraki and plays an important part in the melancholic tale.\n\nIn the movie, the characters board a roofed pleasure boat and even enjoy a river cruise.\n\nTogetsukyo Bridge\n\nAddress: Kyoto, Ukyo, Saga Tenryuji Susukino Baba 1-5\n\nOfficial Website: https://kyoto.travel/en/other_attractions/112.html\n\n8.

The show begins!\"\n\nThe tower, an Osaka icon, has an observatory and hosts various attractions.\n\nSince the observatory can be chartered, it might be fun to enjoy an exclusive view of Osaka.\n\nTsutenkaku Tower\n\nAddress: Osaka, Naniwa, Ebisu Higashi 1-18-6\n\nBusiness Hours: 10:00-20:00\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.tsutenkaku.co.jp\n\n9.

The sword is also tied to a murder case, which summons Conan and Heiji Hattori.\n\nSet in Hokkaido, the new movie should be an exciting tale.\n\n*Hijikata Toshizo: Born 1835, he was the adjutant of the Shinsengumi, a group of swordsmen supporting the Tokugawa shogunate.
