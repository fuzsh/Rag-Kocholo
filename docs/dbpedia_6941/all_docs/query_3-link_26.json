        "text": "The Romanian theatre milieu is traditionally disrespectful, or, at least, not respectful enough, towards its own history. What better examples for such a brutal statement but the fact that the last edition of an official (edited by the Romanian Academy) History of Romanian Theatre dates back to 1973, and the Contemporary Romanian Theatre collective research, dedicated to the interval 1944-1974, published in 1975, was never followed by at least one similar project? We have never had a National Museum of Theatre, and the invaluable treasures of the former museums of the Bucharest National Theatre or Iasi National Theatre are hardly exhibited (Iasi) or stored in improper conditions and securely hidden from the public access (Bucharest). Historical researches are the subject of consensual disregard and pauperization-both by the so called cultural authorities and national research programs and funds. In this sad and depressing landscape, this paper aims at proving that theatre criticism-reviews, essays, surveys, interviews-can offer a rich and relevant archival dimension and vivid documentary material for re-imagining and revisiting famous theatre performances-in terms of directorial visions, spectacular visual and sound spaces and legendary acting. One could ask what would be the purpose of such an archival-reconstructive process in the field and with the tools of theatre criticism? This is a strategic, rather than a truly legitimate question: first and foremost, the efforts of all theatre historians have made such endeavors, based on written or oral testimonies, whether of critical value or not, in order to document how theatre performances were made and received in various times and spaces. However, once again, this is worth placing in the current context: both inside and outside the Romanian space, critical reflection contributions are fewer and less impactful, given the huge tsunami resulting from instant electronic communication and 1 Translated from Romanian by Camelia Oană\n\nTo be or not to be, the famous monologue that is very present in the actors’ repertoires, has suffered many changes overtime which either gave us extraordinary moments or it was simply transformed into dialogue, it was fragmented, moved into different acts other than where the author put it. All these changes were based on a directorial vision. In the television theater this scene (and even the whole show) has a different impact due to filming, editing and directorial vision. So the same show that has been watched at the theater it can be different on a television theater. In the performance hall we can watch the show as a whole, we have the chance to focus on a specific actor, on a specific image, which is something that we can lose in the television theater. In the filmed show we only see which is on the tiny screen. From this perspective, I’ve watched the famous monologue, To be or not to be, in some shows that are considered landmarks for this text only to watch it afterwards wh...\n\nIn 1866 amateur scholar Horace Howard Furness began work on a new American edition of Shakespeare which he designed to be the ultimate resource for all students of the plays. Inspired by the work of eighteenth-century Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone, Furness created a new variorum edition of Shakespeare which included the text of each play, extensive textual notes and a broad selection of critical and aesthetic commentary. Additionally, unlike most of his predecessors, contemporaries and successors, Furness integrated the history of theatrical production with that of textual editing and criticism. His aim was to provide all students of Shakespeare—including theatrical practitioners—the comments of editors, scholars, critics and actors on textual, critical, aesthetic, dramatic and interpretive issues on the same page as the text to which they referred. Furness strived to give scholars, students and practitioners the ability to make informed interpretive choices about the texts of Shakespeare. This article explicates the many reasons why Furness infused his edition with the evidence of performance practice and demonstrates the use-value of the New Variorum series to nineteenth-century theatrical professionals. I argue that Furness’s serious treatment of textual choices by actors and producers and critical writings by and about actors anticipated the shift in editorial theory in the mid-twentieth century which admitted stage practice as valid scholarly material.\n\nRepresentation of violent actions is a basic component of conflict-based dramaturgy. In the doctoral research The Spectacle of Violence - from Hypnotic Power to Social Responsibility, we highlighted the effects of the representation of violent action at the psycho-neurophysiological level, having as tools questionnaires of evaluation, EEG and memory tasks. Neuro-physiological results confirm the hypothesis that observing a conflicting or aggressive action creates a special attention to the approach avoidance complex necessary for survival in potentially dangerous situations. At the psychological level, the representation of violent acts has increased the level of anxiety and depression of actors and viewers, and, more importantly, some of the actors who have performed violent actions in the experiment have reported positive emotions about them. The latter observation corresponds to Elbert's (2017) two pedal model of aggression (2017), according to which the repetition of aggressive behaviors leads to the transformation in time of the negative emotions, that initially accompany them, in positive emotions. The results contribute to the possibility to develop methods of theater therapeutic intervention for the management of aggressive behaviors, highlight the responsibility generated by the representation of aggressive actions towards actors and spectators, and argue the need for the development of a new drama, beyond the scripts of punishment, with the role of creating a sense of the community and the common human condition.\n\nThe application of digital technologies to Shakespeare has advanced considerably over the last decade. The spread of online archives offers new opportunities for researchers and teachers, facilitating the collection of materials. Since 2011, we have seized upon the opportunity afforded by digital archives with a project, Arianna, whose main goal is the creation of the meta-archive Shakespeariana, a database that includes iconographical items inspired by Shakespearean plays from the 16th century to the present day. As this article demonstrates, Arianna allows the user to make simple or combined searches in different fields, containing more than 13,000 iconographical items. Managing, sustaining, and refining the project brings new challenges. It poses the need to refine the strategies and methods of data acquisition, to conceive new tools of investigation, and to introduce some possible interactions with the end user. To this extent, two important problems are raised. The first concer..."
