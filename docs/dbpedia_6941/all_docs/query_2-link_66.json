        "text": "♪ ♪ CORAL PEÑA: \"Antiques Roadshow Recut\" is on the hunt for treasures at Filoli in Woodside, California.\n\nIt's a piece of art, so, and, and a iconic piece of San Francisco history.\n\nYou're gonna make me cry!\n\n(appraiser chuckles) That's wonderful.\n\n♪ ♪ PEÑA: In this half-hour, \"Antiques Roadshow Recut\" continues our visit to Filoli in Woodside, California.\n\nThe grand former residence is almost 55,000 square feet, with 56 rooms, and originally, had 24 family and staff bedrooms, 15 bathrooms, and 17 fireplaces.\n\nThe house alone took three years to complete and cost $425,000.\n\nThat's around nine-and-a-half million dollars in 2024.\n\n\"Roadshow\" saw many impressive items at Filoli.\n\nGUEST: I actually found 'em for 49 cents at a thrift store.\n\n♪ ♪ GUEST: It belonged to my stepmother, who inherited it from her grandmother.\n\nMy stepmom was born in 1917, so I think her grandmother probably had her heyday at the end of the 19th century.\n\nHer second husband, I think, gave her this beautiful brooch.\n\nBut she had been a single mom and had her own millinery shop in New York.\n\nWow, wow.\n\nWhich at that time was very unusual.\n\nTotally.\n\nI think it's diamonds and onyx.\n\nThat's what my, I was always told.\n\nBut I don't know exactly the year, or the maker, or anything more.\n\nYou're spot-on, it is diamond and onyx.\n\nWhat I love about it is, these onyx are sort of faceted.\n\nYes.\n\nSo you get that play of the light in the darkness of the stones.\n\nThese are old-European-cut diamonds, and all in all, they weigh about five carats.\n\nThe piece firmly dates to the Art Deco period.\n\nIt's very much in the Deco color palette.\n\nIt feels very architectural.\n\nAnd then, on top of that, what's kind of fun is that it's, it's a ribbon bow, which has been interpreted in jewelry for centuries.\n\nBut the best thing about it is that it's signed by the maker Cartier.\n\nOh, wow!\n\nDo you ever wear this piece?\n\nI never have.\n\nI've always been afraid I'd lose it.\n\n(both laughing) Well, it is a brooch.\n\nYeah.\n\nUm... And if you turn it over here, you can see that it's marked on the pin stem along the side of the piece.\n\nAnd then it also has a serial number on the center element.\n\nCartier was, and continues to be, preeminent jewelry maker to royalty and important socialites, especially at this time.\n\nThey were the leaders of this style of jewelry.\n\nOf course, they started as a French firm and expanded into the U.K., and then, ultimately, into New York.\n\nAnd I feel that this is Cartier New York.\n\nConservatively, an auction estimate today would be in the neighborhood of $8,000 to $12,000.\n\nWow, okay!\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I'd expect that it would perform at the high end of that estimate, because it just epitomizes Cartier, 1920s, Art Deco jewelry.\n\nAnd I chose it 'cause I just thought it was beautiful.\n\nGUEST: Well, we got it from the daughter of our next-door neighbor, who had passed.\n\nAnd we had helped take care of her while she was elderly, and she told her daughter that she would like us to pick something from the collections that they had in their house.\n\nSo my husband went in and picked this, because he liked the lines in it.\n\nHe didn't know who it was by?\n\nWell, we suspected, you know, because of the signature, kind of looked like Matisse, and, and the style looked like it.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt is a lithograph by Henri Matisse, dating from the end of his career, in the early 1950s... Wow.\n\n...when his focus became more religious.\n\nHe designed for a church in the south of France, in Vence, the Chapel of the Rosary.\n\nIt's one of his famous works, with the, the stained-glass windows.\n\nAnd about the same time, he was making a series of lithographs of the Virgin and Child, which, this is one.\n\nMm, okay.\n\nSo you have the figure... Mm-hmm.\n\n...of the, the mother and child here.\n\nSigned in pencil and numbered, as these were, out of an edition of 100.\n\nHe was very scaled down and minimal with his line at this time.\n\nAt retail, or replacement, I would put the value of this at $25,000.\n\nOh!\n\nTuition!\n\nCha-ching!\n\n(laughing) One kid!\n\nOne kid paid for!\n\n(laughs) No way!\n\nYeah, it's fantastic, and it's in beautiful shape.\n\nYou're... Well, thank you so much-- that's very exciting!\n\nVery good news!\n\nYeah.\n\nGUEST: I believe this is the front panel of a cable car from San Francisco.\n\nI acquired it two or three years ago at an auction.\n\nI said, \"That's something I have to have.\"\n\nIt's a piece of art, so, and, and a iconic piece of San Francisco history.\n\nYes.\n\nPossibly.\n\nPossibly.\n\nYes.\n\nYes, and what did you pay for it?\n\nUh, $900.\n\nThe Presidio and Ferries Railroad Company started operations in San Francisco in 1880.\n\nThey started by doing a very long run from downtown San Francisco out to the Presidio Military Reservation.\n\nRight.\n\nThat was their original purpose.\n\nRight, this one from Market Street.\n\nFrom Market Street, which is downtown.\n\nRight.\n\nThey ran a cable car system, and it ran up until 1906, when there was a catastrophic event in San Francisco-- the earthquake.\n\nRight.\n\nMany of the cars were destroyed.\n\nRight.\n\nParts were salvaged.\n\nThey rebuilt, as they did with the city, and they were purchased by the City of San Francisco in 1913.\n\nThis front of a cable car is what you're thinking it is.\n\nThe design pattern is identical to what I've seen on some of the vintage cars.\n\nWhen we examine it forensically, you have a, a front that's made of separate individual boards.\n\nIt's put together in a tongue- and-groove construction.\n\nTongue-and-groove construction was very, very popular in the late 19th century.\n\nThese two boards-- this one and the one over there with the large hole in it-- they're a different wood.\n\nThey were a harder wood because there was a bolt that went through here, and that's what bolted it to the front of the cable car.\n\nThen they were covered with a fascia board.\n\nAnd we clearly see the oxidation mark.\n\nWhen we examine the paint, we see beautiful gilt, gold letters.\n\nAnd this would have been painted on by an employee of the cable car company.\n\nAnd they were called carriage painters.\n\nThey were very, very expert at doing this beautiful gold lettering.\n\nAnd when we look at the patina on this lettering, we see real age.\n\nThis is exactly what you want to see when it comes to gilt lettering.\n\nIt's absolutely authentic.\n\nDates to the late 19th century.\n\nThis metal bezel, that held the glass lens.\n\nBehind there, originally, was a fuel light that would shine out and magnify onto the street.\n\nSo you have an authentic front of a San Francisco cable car.\n\nAll right.\n\nWhich is pretty amazing piece of, of history.\n\nRight.\n\nGreat, I love it.\n\nNow, I'm going to place a retail value on it today of $5,000 to $7,000.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo I think you did very well.\n\nThat's great.\n\nCongratulations.\n\nAll right.\n\nAnd it's real.\n\nIt's real-- that's what I...\n\nIsn't that exciting?\n\nWell, it is.\n\nI like real, not fake.\n\n(laughs): I, I think... Or copies.\n\nI think we all do.\n\nWe were given it by our uncle as a wedding gift.\n\nI think it's...\n\nI'm guessing it's from Africa-- that's about it.\n\nAPPRAISER: It's West African.\n\nThey make 'em in Nigeria, and they also make 'em in Cameroon.\n\nThey've become extremely collectible in the past 15 or 20 years.\n\n(chuckling) If I saw this in the shop, I'd expect it to be $300 or $400.\n\nOkay.\n\nReally cool thing.\n\nThank you, guys, for coming in.\n\nGUEST: I brought a woodblock print that's been in my family for quite some time.\n\nI know it's by Chiura Obata, but I don't know a ton more about the painting itself, aside from it having been in my family since around 1940 or earlier.\n\nOkay, and then we have a picture that you brought in.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nCan you tell me what's going on in the picture?\n\nThis is my grandfather.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nMy great-grandfather, great-grandmother, and my grandfather's siblings.\n\nAnd this is in San Pedro, California, which is the L.A. area.\n\nAnd the painting is here in the background.\n\nThe exact one that we're looking at right now.\n\nMm-hmm, the same one.\n\nThe artist's life is really fascinating.\n\nOkay.\n\nUm, he was born in 1885, in Japan.\n\nAnd at an early age, he already was a, a, apprenticing to learn sumi-e painting-- line painting, essentially.\n\nAnd he emigrated to the United States in 1903.\n\nWhen in the United States, he became fairly successful fairly quickly, despite a lot of racism and xenophobia.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd there are a lot of stories about him having to run away from ruffians.\n\nAnd this was a difficult time in, in, in history... Mm-hmm.\n\n...for Japanese, uh, immigrants to America.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nHis talents really kept him going.\n\nHe became a very successful commercial illustrator.\n\nOne of the subjects that he did love painting was nature, and he loved going into the Sierra Nevadas, and he loved going into Yosemite.\n\nThe title of this is \"Evening Glow of Yosemite Waterfall.\"\n\nThis is someone who sought to convey the feelings that we would get from being there.\n\nHe wanted to bring into his artistic oeuvre and production some of his Japanese techniques.\n\nAnd one of the Japanese techniques that he would, of course, bring in would have, would have been woodblock printing.\n\nThere was a company that made woodblock prints from these watercolor drawings that he made for the, this exact \"World of Art\" Yosemite book that basically showcased his love of these California landscapes.\n\nOkay.\n\nThis was around 1930.\n\nNow, this piece is from that series.\n\nIt's signed and dated, uh, \"Chiura Obata, 1930.\"\n\nBut there's another part to the history here.\n\nWhen World War II happened, we all know that, unfortunately-- and this is an, a very unfortunate part of American history-- that a lot of Japanese Americans were interned.\n\nJust looking at this picture, for example, that you brought, which is of your greater family...\n\nYes.\n\n...what can you tell us?\n\nThey were interned.\n\nBefore the internment, my great-grandfather was imprisoned under unfounded suspicion of having dealings with the Japanese military.\n\nWhen he did get out, he passed away a day later.\n\nAnd then shortly after that, the rest of the family was interned.\n\nBut while they were in internment camp, a good friend and neighbor took care of all their belongings.\n\nSo that's how we are fortunate enough to still have this painting.\n\nThe artist himself was also interned.\n\nRight.\n\nEven being a professor at U.C.-Berkeley, even owning a shop on Telegraph Avenue.\n\nThe shop itself was attacked.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd he himself was sent to an internment camp.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd the really interesting thing about this is that at the internment camps, he actually started some programs for education and art schools.\n\nHm, interesting.\n\nEven those these were prints, they were really considered masterworks.\n\nThey were printed in very limited editions of only 100.\n\nOh.\n\nWe don't know how many of them exist anymore.\n\nHave you ever thought about value or how much you might value it for?\n\nI have no idea.\n\nIf I was going to put an insurance value on this today, because I'm assuming you'd probably want to insure it for the family... Definitely.\n\n...I would easily insure it at $20,000.\n\nWow.\n\n(laughs) Okay.\n\n(laughing) Wow-- that's amazing.\n\n♪ ♪ APPRAISER: What we have here is a country store advertising cabinet from around 1900.\n\nThey were designed to draw people in.\n\nLook at the way the horse looks at you.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd what that is is a chromolithograph.\n\nAnd then, if you open the back, you can see how they embossed it to make it stand out even more.\n\nMm.\n\nSo when somebody came in looking for a veterinary remedy, hopefully, Dr. Lesure was betting on the fact that this cabinet would attract 'em.\n\nThis one is probably gonna go in the $3,000 to $4,000 range.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, that's really nice, thanks.\n\nYeah.\n\nMy father was a collector of arms and armor here in the Bay Area.\n\nHe acquired the piece somewhere in the mid-'90s from a collection in the East Bay.\n\nAll I know about it is that it's a chanfron.\n\nI believe it was European.\n\nSo what is a chanfron?\n\nMy understanding is that a chanfron is a horse's armor for its head.\n\nBut I didn't know if this would've been more of a ceremonial or parade piece, versus something that it would've worn into battle.\n\nWell, it clearly would've been something f, for ceremonial purposes.\n\nAnd one of the reasons we'd say that is because of the etching.\n\nYou have these two panels of these winged harpies, and you've got two naked warriors at the base with their spears and their shields, and you have these fluted panels etched with these sort of bold foliate scrolls.\n\nSo you wouldn't have invested money in your horse armor with this type of decoration... Sure.\n\n...to lead it into battle.\n\nIn many instances, a knight, by his very definition, was a mounted soldier, and he would go to parades and other functions where he would embellish his armor to show his status and his rank.\n\nThis is a Maximilian-style chanfron, uh, which would date to the first quarter of the 16th century.\n\nThis would have been the style that was popular in Germany at the time.\n\nOkay.\n\nThe trick with most armor of this period is determining whether or not it's correct.\n\nSure.\n\nAnd whether or not it's a later reproduction.\n\nOkay.\n\nMany of the reproductions are relatively smaller, and this is obviously a very monumental piece, uh, which would have been the proper size.\n\nSo the first clue to us is that, yes, it's the large size of it and the quality of the decoration.\n\nThere's even some damage at the base that would indicate age.\n\nBut the real test in determining the age of armor is to turn it around.\n\nThis would have been forged metal, and as such, it would have been hammered on an anvil.\n\nAnd the interior surface shows no real evidence of hand-forging.\n\nSure.\n\nAnd in general, the thickness of the metal is of a uniform.\n\nSo I would say that this is a late-19th-century reproduction.\n\nOkay.\n\nBut immensely attractive.\n\nHave you given much thought to value?\n\nI know my father paid a few thousand dollars, probably, for it.\n\nI, I don't have a clue of what the market is like currently on it.\n\nI mean, I could throw a number out there and probably embarrass myself.\n\n(chuckles) So I, I would say maybe $4,000?\n\nRenaissance horse armor to begin with is extraordinarily rare, and particularly decorated examples, but oddly enough, equally as scarce are reproductions.\n\nOkay.\n\nAt auction, I would estimate its value probably around $5,000 to $10,000.\n\nFantastic.\n\nAnd I think it would actually probably do much better.\n\nSure.\n\n'Cause it's really, it's a handsome piece.\n\nFantastic, thank you so much.\n\nIf this were not a reproduction, I would estimate its, uh, auction value at around somewhere between $200,000 to $300,000.\n\nWow.\n\nBetter luck next time.\n\n(laughs) GUEST: My father-in-law started collecting Asian art.\n\nAnd G.T.\n\nMarsh and Sons imported many, many beautiful things.\n\nAnd we're talking around the '40s and '50s, when he was going to s, G.T.\n\nMarsh.\n\nWell, he struck up a relationship with Mr. Marsh and was invited to their family home in Stinson Beach, and took my husband, Bill, with him to create something lovely for his mother.\n\nAs a young man, Marsh was traveling from Australia.\n\nHe's 15 and says he wants to stay in Japan for a while.\n\nAnd he starts to absorb the Japanese aesthetics and design.\n\nUm, something as simple as this box that this piece came in, there's Japanese dragons.\n\nHe was one of the first to start exploring with mixed metals.\n\nWhen he's in the shop here, in San Francisco, they have an Italian jeweler, and I really wouldn't know this, except that one of our colleagues, who's not with us anymore, was, like, the Marsh expert.\n\nReally?!\n\nYeah, his name was Barry Weber.\n\nAll righty.\n\nAnd, uh, and I miss you, Barry.\n\nHe taught me about this jewelry.\n\nHe just loved it-- he had a passion for it.\n\nThis is oxidized steel on the surface.\n\nHow do they oxidize it?\n\nWell, this Italian jeweler was a gunsmith.\n\nHe knew about bluing gun barrels.\n\nIn this particular case, they perfected a technique where they sandblast the metal.\n\nThey use chemicals, they use heat, and they would gently give the metal this nice matte finish.\n\nAnd then in these connectors, they usually used white gold or platinum.\n\nAll right.\n\nI did test these.\n\nOkay.\n\nThey're white gold-- they are, in all three pieces, diamonds.\n\nAnd that is a cultured pearl, which would fit with coming out of Japan, and Mikimoto developing the pearls.\n\nOkay.\n\nNow, you have three things here.\n\nI'll, I'll break it down-- the ring.\n\nThe ring has a half-carat old-European-cut diamond in it.\n\nAll right.\n\nThe beauty of the earrings-- you can tell everybody.\n\nWhat's so fun about the earrings?\n\nThe pearls move back and forth.\n\nAs you move your head, the pearls swing back and forth.\n\nAnd it's a spring action.\n\nAnd they clamp on so well.\n\nAt 65 years, they're as good as they were done yesterday!\n\nAnd women who, um, don't have pierced ears... (chuckling) Right, right.\n\n...love these earrings.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd they're not too heavy.\n\nNo, not at all!\n\nOn the necklace, I have to tell you, it kind of blew me away.\n\nYou see big brooches, you see pins.\n\nI have never seen a necklace quite like this from Marsh.\n\n(voice breaking): You're going to make me cry.\n\n(laughing) That's wonderful.\n\nIt really is fabulous.\n\nI think very realistically and at auction, as a suite, I think you're looking at $30,000 to $44,000.\n\n(inhales deeply): Wow.\n\nNow, to break it down, it's easy $20,000 to $30,000 just for the necklace.\n\nWow.\n\nNecklace is beyond fabulous.\n\nI believe the earrings would be $5,000 to $7,000.\n\nI believe the ring would be the same.\n\nYou might find a ring, you might find a pair of earrings, but you're going to have a lot of difficulty... Finding that.\n\nThank you so much, Kevin.\n\n(laughing): You're welcome.\n\nYou made my day.\n\nYou made mine.\n\n(laughs) GUEST: This is one of the Hudson Valley School paintings that was given to me by my parents, who inherited it from my grandmother and my great-aunt.\n\nAnd who is the artist?\n\nWilliam Hart.\n\nHe is considered one of the Hudson River School artists.\n\nThe father of the Hudson River School was Thomas Cole.\n\nWilliam Hart is considered sort of a second-string painter in that group, but certainly very accomplished.\n\nAnd he exhibited all during his lifetime.\n\nAnd his paintings are in museums around the country.\n\nHe was born in Paisley, Scotland, in 1823.\n\nHe immigrated to the U.S. around 1830, and eventually to Albany and Troy, New York, area in 1831.\n\nWhat we find here is a landscape that is of Keene, New Hampshire.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nThis was a favorite area of his.\n\nMost of the works we see by him are of cows in landscapes, and the cows are rather large and dominate the composition.\n\nOh.\n\nThose are his later works, done sort, in the late 1870s to '80s.\n\nHe, he died in 1894.\n\nThis is really refreshing, because it's an early example.\n\nIt was done around 1859 to 1861.\n\nOh.\n\nYou can see it's, it's rather fresh.\n\nHe has an interesting approach.\n\nHe has figures on the right side, the cows are more minimal in the background.\n\nAnd then, of course, the beautiful landscape and the more or less luminous sky make it a, a rather creative composition for him.\n\nIt's signed in the lower right \"W.M.\n\nHart.\"\n\nAnd that's a typical signature for him.\n\nThe medium is oil on canvas, and the frame is wonderful.\n\nIt's, uh, original frame.\n\nCondition-wise, I think it might need a cleaning.\n\nThere is a catalogue raisonné of William Hart's work.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nThis work is listed there.\n\nIt does mention that it went through American art galleries in 1925.\n\nYou said you got it from your great...?\n\nMy great-aunt.\n\nYour great-aunt.\n\nSo would she have been in New York around 1925?\n\nShe was visiting her brother, who lived in Connecticut, but was a stockbroker in New York.\n\nSo, yes, I'm sure she...\n\nSo she has... ...traveled into New York.\n\nPerhaps that's where she acquired it.\n\nUnfortunately, the Hudson River School in general is not as much in vogue today...\n\nYes.\n\n...as it was, let's say, 20 years ago.\n\nIf it were in a gallery, I think it would probably sell in the neighborhood of $15,000.\n\nOh, my goodness!\n\n(chuckling): That, that surprises me, thank you.\n\nWell, you're welcome.\n\nAnd for insurance, I would suggest $18,000 for insurance.\n\n(stammers): Thank you very, very much, Debra.\n\nWell, you're welcome.\n\nI truly appreciate.\n\nIt gives me pleasure every time I look at it.\n\nAw, well, that's great.\n\nSo I'm very pleased to hear all of this.\n\nOh, good.\n\nPEÑA: Thanks for watching.\n\nSee you next time on \"Antiques Roadshow Recut.\""
