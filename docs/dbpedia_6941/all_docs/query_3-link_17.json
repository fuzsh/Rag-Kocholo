        "text": "Stage productions and film adaptations of King Lear have played a key role in re-signifying the play. Peter Brook’s 1962 production for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) has become an important landmark in the play’s theatrical “afterlife” in Britain after the Second World War. The most memorable feature of this Lear was its conspicuous grimness, considered highly subversive at the time as it broke away from romanticised approaches that still predominated in British productions of the play. The production’s overwhelming bleakness is commonly associated with Brook’s response to the absurdist theatre of Samuel Beckett, more particularly to the world of deterioration Beckett depicted in Endgame. Not only has the production’s Beckettian significance shaped the way King Lear has been read, performed and adapted in the anglophone world across the decades; it has become a theatrical convention that is time and again re-appropriated at the RSC. Although this approach has lost its initial freshness, Beckett’s pervasive influence on modern productions of the play prompts us to reconsider how these two entirely distinct theatrical traditions were made to intersect through signifying practices that shape contemporary Shakespearean performance. This article re-examines the impact of Beckett’s plays on post-Second War stagings of King Lear. In addition to Brook’s production, I will look at other Lears which, though equally indebted to Beckett, drew on the latter’s theatre in creative and innovative ways: Adrian Noble’s and Gregory Doran’s productions, staged at the RSC in 1982 and 2016, respectively. The multi-discursive nature of the three stagings not only undermined the primacy of the Shakespeare text as the main source of meaning, but also offered different ways to meaningfully re-signify King Lear through Beckett in productions staged over twenty years apart. The directors’ inventive assimilation of visual, thematic and performative elements emblematic of Beckett’s plays to render King Lear modern gained new significances within the wider theatrical contexts in which the productions were mounted. As I will discuss later, the Beckettian analogies took shape in relation to the institutional practices of the RSC and the audiences’ shifting perception of Beckett’s theatre. While the appropriation of recognisably Beckettian forms was instrumental in reinventing King Lear, the dialogic practices on which this connection was grounded also prompted drastic reconfigurations of key features of Beckett’s plays.\n\nThe use of Beckett to modernise King Lear foregrounds the complex interplay of textual and extratextual sources often employed to render Shakespeare’s plays meaningful onstage. This multi-layered nature of Shakespearean performance is sometimes overlooked in favour of a text-based view that locates the meaning of performance primarily in the text. The emphasis on the text is symptomatic of authenticity discourses that reverence it as a stable artefact. Undermining this notion, research on Early Modern drama has shown that Shakespeare’s plays were initially generated through collaborative work, intertextual appropriation, and shaped by the contingencies of theatrical performance. In the same vein, performance studies have drawn attention to the various elements which, alongside Shakespeare the text, are made to interact dialogically to construct meaning in the theatre. W. B. Worthen has painstakingly objected to the long-held view that Shakespearean performance is a derivative phenomenon, subservient to the authority of the Shakespeare text. For him, stage meanings “are not ‘translatable’ from the text, because meaning in the theatre arises from the application of productive practices to the text – behavior, scenic, design, lighting, movement, the full panoply of institutionalized theatre practice – that stand outside and beyond the text” (). In this sense, both the Shakespeare text and the theatrical apparatus employed in a stage performance play a part in the processes of meaning-making. Furthering this argument, Worthen advocates for a “postdramatic” movement which reconceptualises dramatic performance “away from a notion of performance as communicating an interpretation of the text toward a notion of affordance” (). The “affordance” of the text refers to its appropriability, its purposefulness, determined by both its material properties and the demands we make of it when deploying it. Instead of exerting a magisterial influence over the performance, dramatic writing is seen as raw material and a tool: “As material, the text is worked on and worked into the performance, made into something no longer essentially verbal in its construction, an event; as a tool, the text provides a critical agency, one instrument among many for making the performance” (). Within this framework, the text plays neither a magisterial nor a ministerial role, and the performance, by the same token, is neither liberated from nor inscribed within the text (). Rather, meanings in the theatre are grounded on a fluid relationship between text and performance, and generated through the dialogic tension between writing and mise en scène.\n\nWorthen’s argument regarding the dialogic fluidity of performance lays the groundwork for my examination of how King Lear was made to re-signify on the RSC stage through the directors’ appropriation of Beckett. The ongoing tensions between text and performance are amplified at the RSC, arguably the epicentre of Shakespearean performance in the English-speaking world. As will be shown below, the company’s name and reputation rely heavily on Shakespeare’s canonical status and the cultural capital accumulated in his work. The urge to honour Shakespeare has given rise to stage practices that position dramatic performance as the reproduction of meanings authorized by the text, as though the latter had a stable materiality and were a container of authentic meanings.\n\nWhile performance is made to underscore the text’s centripetal force, it is nevertheless intersected by the centrifugal force of the mise en scène and other discursive elements whose dialogic interaction constitutes the theatrical event. Rather than a monologic activity where meaning is mainly constructed through the unifying force of the Shakespeare text, Shakespearean performance is a dialogic phenomenon on which centralising and decentralising forces are brought to bear. These processes of centralisation and decentralisation reflect what Bakhtin has termed “heterloglossia”, the co-existence of multiple discourses within the various spheres of linguistic activity: “Authorial speech, the speech of narrators, inserted genres, the speech of characters” (). To Bakhtin, concrete discourse is shaped by several forces with which it is interwoven, such as “shared thoughts, points of view, alien value judgements and accents” (276). It follows that the living discourse, “having taken the meaning and shape at a particular historical moment in a socially specific environment, cannot fail to brush up against thousands of living dialogic threads…; it cannot fail to become an active participant in social dialogue” (). Bakhtin’s notion – though primarily centred on the novel – sheds light on how the appropriations of Beckett to perform King Lear took shape and acquired significance within the dialogic heteroglossia of the productions. The assimilation of recognisably Beckettian forms into the Elizabethan texture of King Lear reiterated intertextual practices commonly employed to make Shakespeare meaningful to contemporary audiences in specific cultural contexts.\n\nBeckett and Post-Second World War British Theatre\n\nA brief survey of Beckett’s emergence as a key figure of the Theatre of the Absurd in Britain will provide a broader understanding of the enduring impact of his drama on King Lear’s theatrical afterlife. World drama was never the same after the premiere of Waiting for Godot in the 1950s. The play drastically broke away from long-established conventions that still dominated Britain’s mainstream theatre, such as Aristotelian notions of plot development and the use of naturalistic settings. Rather than telling a story with a beginning, middle and end, Godot is centred upon Estragon and Vladimir’s wait for Mr Godot, who never turns up. They engage in a series of vaudevillian acts and metaphysical reflections to pass the time while awaiting their delayed appointment with the mysterious Godot. The play takes place on a bare country road near a withered tree, a vague set that cannot be easily pinned down to specific geographic locations or historical contexts. Beckett’s refusal to provide clear answers to enduring questions about Godot’s identity or the dramatic motivation for Didi and Gogo’s endless wait puzzled theatregoers and critics who attended the play’s British premiere in 1955. Unable to fully understand the play, audiences and critics alike mistakenly judged it against works of traditional theatre whose conventions were entirely overturned in Godot.\n\nThe tide was turned after the influential critic Kenneth Tynan deemed the play a masterpiece of modern theatre. It soon gained an overwhelmingly wide appeal among contemporary readers and audiences.Godot drastically shifted their perception of theatrical activity, and in turn widened their interpretative scope of what theatre can mean. Beckett’s subsequent plays pushed his minimalist aesthetics to the limits with remarkable verbal experimentations and highly subversive artistic forms. Although his dramatic oeuvre is not seen as part of the European high modernism of the 1920s, it has inherited “the modernist writer’s creed for ‘making it new,’ with each new work being presented as an innovation of both established conventions and the playwright’s previous work” ().\n\nHis next play, Endgame, is a case in point. While it carries traces of Godot’s compressed structure, it conveys a darker vision through a far more pared-down dramatic idiom. The open wasteland of Godot gives way to a claustrophobic room in which “the sense of decrepitude and entrapment are far more oppressive” (). Hamm, who can neither see nor walk, and Clov, who cannot sit, play a series of “ending” games which constantly frustrate our expectation for the tragic ending they appear to announce: “I’m warming up for my last soliloquy” (), declares Hamm towards the end of the play. The world of deterioration depicted in Endgame evokes the bleak aftermath of World War II, but the play refuses to conform to such critical interpretations. As Adorno has declared in his famous essay on Endgame, “Understanding it can mean nothing other than understanding its incomprehensibility” (). If we have now come to terms with the play’s resistance to provide explanations, British spectators attending the first performance of Endgame struggled to make sense of its acute grimness. Reviewer found fault with the “growing irritation” provoked by the characters’ ludicrous exchanges, which continued “without bringing with them any development of character.” This urge for character and plot development was symptomatic of the audience’s initial antagonism towards Endgame; once again, Beckett was evaluated from the perspective of Aristotelian theatre whose rules he was clearly rebelling against.\n\nThe publication of Martin Esslin’s The Theatre of the Absurd (1961) played a key role in reconfiguring audiences’ perception of Beckett and some of his contemporary playwrights. Esslin drew on Sartre and Camus to provide a definition of the “absurd” under which he grouped a wide range of entirely distinct plays by various playwrights. To him, the plays of the absurd share the same theme: “This sense of metaphysical anguish at the absurdity of the human condition” (). Esslin adds that absurdist writers employed unique methods to express the “senselessness of the human condition and the inadequacy of the rational approach” (), namely their rejection of traditional notions of plot development and character construction. Although Esslin’s “absurdist” label fails to encompass more broadly the vast scope of the so-called absurd plays, the book has been instrumental in elevating those plays and making them more accessible to spectators whose struggle to understand the new drama prevented them from responding more enthusiastically to the plays’ unconventional features.\n\nNot only has Godot – Beckett’s most famous play – become a theatre classic; it “has been absorbed into the theatre of our time” () and accrued an immense cultural capital. The play’s spare imagery is an iconic symbol of modern theatre: a bare stage, a tree, and two characters waiting for Godot. Other iconic images such as the dustbins of Endgame, and the half-buried heroine of Happy Days have equally become synonymous with modern drama. Beckett’s plays are infused with visual and performative components which, devoid of historical and socio-political references, cater to culturally diverse audiences in various sociocultural contexts. Gontarski notes that popular culture has played an enormous role in fostering the playwright’s emergence into the global economy, where “he and his work are too often reduced to a few immediately recognisable emblems, clichés, or catch phrases, like trash cans, bowler hats, or the act of waiting itself” (). Like Shakespearean drama, Beckett’s plays are highly appropriable materials whose “affordance” enables them to be reimagined in the theatre and beyond. Once assimilated into the tragic texture of King Lear, the emblematic marks of Beckett’s theatre afforded new possibilities of re-signifying the Shakespearean play."
