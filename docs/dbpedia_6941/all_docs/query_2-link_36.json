        "text": "Composition Drawing Guide\n\nAs artists, we like to deliver a memorable experience for the observer.\n\nIn this guide, I will demonstrate how I plan and place my compositions, and why.\n\nI will start by explaining some important drawing terms, and then show how to use them for composition.\n\nNote:\n\nAll drawings in the composition section are from life. While drawing from images is great in many cases, drawing from direct observation gives us the power to change the scene to our liking, or to our angle of sight.\n\nOverlapping\n\nOverlapping means an object that covers part of another object.\n\nWhen drawing flowers, draw overlapping petals (in most cases), to deliver a realistic result.\n\nIn addition, when one object covers part of another object, the observer assumes that it is in front of the object it covers.\n\nTherefore, overlapping attests to depth.\n\nForeshortening\n\nForeshortening is a distortion that occurs when looking at objects or planes that are along the line of sight.\n\nIn the next example, a circle, while in front of the observer, keeps its shape, no matter how far or close it is.\n\nBut, when the angle of sight is changed, the circle is no longer in front of the observer. It is now along the line of sight, and its shape is distorted to an ellipse.\n\nIn other words, its height becomes much shorter than its width (in this case).\n\nSo, in many cases, it is more interesting and natural to look at a drawing of a foreshortened object.\n\nIf you like flower drawing, like the examples below, you might like my beginners guide to drawing flowers.\n\nRemember:\n\nWhen drawing an ellipse (or any other shape), the closer it is to the horizon, the more that plane is foreshortened.\n\nTwo common mistakes to avoid:\n\n1. Do not draw the bottom of a cylindrical object flat (unless it is exactly on the horizon).\n\n2. Pay attention to the amount of foreshortening for each plane. In the example below, when there is not enough foreshortening, it looks like the top part of the vase is facing the observer.\n\nMore on ellipses, you can find in my ellipse-drawing guide.\n\nPerspective\n\nPerspective is a set of simple rules for drawing in a realistic way, especially when drawing from imagination.\n\nThe use of perspective can produce unnatural results if not done correctly:\n\nUse the power of linear perspective to create quick sketches, and explore different composition ideas.\n\nIf you are new to perspective, read my article on perspective drawing for beginners, or click the perspective category in my guide for best drawing tutorials on YouTube.\n\nComposition\n\nComposition is the way artists compose and arrange a scene.\n\nWhen it comes to still life, it means the placement of objects in an interesting manner.\n\nSince composition is a personal preference, there are no rules on how to create it.\n\nThat said, there are some things to avoid.\n\nFor a natural composition, it is best to avoid patterns, or anything that looks staged, uniform, or symmetrical.\n\nA box-shaped object, which is in front of the observer, is quite boring. When rotated, two sides of the object are foreshortened.\n\nThis results in an interesting composition with a sense of depth:\n\nTo learn more about depth, read my article on how to draw with a sense of depth.\n\nCylindrical Objects:\n\nWhat about a cylindrical object? Rotating it does not change its form.\n\nWhile the form does not change, symbols or text on the object rotate and create a spontaneous look, and therefore authentic!\n\nIn addition, some cylindrical objects do have interesting features that can be rotated.\n\nA view slightly from above is much better than a side view:\n\nObjects Placement:\n\nPlacing objects with space between them, or ordered by size (or any other pattern), is not interesting:\n\nThe use of overlapping and random placement (not in a row), renders better:\n\nTip:\n\nKeep your empty containers. You can use them to practice object grouping and placement.\n\nAdditionally, you can use any type of objects for composition practice. Even complex ones:\n\nKeep in mind:\n\nWhen you do place objects that are ordered by size, use the power of perspective (different placing in space), and overlapping (objects covering parts of other objects).\n\nThumbnails:\n\nSometimes, when you are not sure how to build a composition, you can use thumbnails with quick sketches.\n\nThis should not be a long process. A few minutes for each thumbnail, to see what works, and what does not.\n\nIt is beneficial to sketch some thumbnails for different compositions ideas. For example, different object placement, or close up vs long shot.\n\nWhen drawing from imagination, it is helpful to use thumbnails.\n\nThat is when perspective has a major role in creating true to life compositions.\n\nOn the other hand, when drawing from observation, there is a better way.\n\nCut a hole in a piece of paper and look through it, to find an interesting composition.\n\nFocal Point\n\nWhen one main object is the center of attention, it is the focal point.\n\nGive it the most contrast and details, in order for it to stand out.\n\nIn addition, for a pleasant and inviting composition, whether it is a still life or a landscape, it is usually better when the main subject is not in the middle.\n\nWhen the focal point is a bit to the side, you can balance it with something on the other side. Something small and gentle (mountains and shadow in this example).\n\nIf you like drawing trees (like the examples below), visit my tree-drawing guide.\n\nRule of Thirds\n\nThe rule of thirds is not exactly a rule.\n\nIt is a suggestion to put the main objects on the lines that divide the paper into three parts (either horizontally or vertically), or on the meeting points where these lines intersect.\n\nThe idea behind the \"rule of thirds\" is that placing an object in the middle or at the side, is not that interesting.\n\nIn many cases, I draw and paint my objects (roughly) according to the rule of thirds, without giving it much thought. Meaning, it happens naturally:\n\nThat said, in some of my drawings and paintings, the focal point is in the middle:\n\nAnd for some, the focal point is at the side (the main tree):\n\nWhen I draw quick sketches for characters, I sometimes use the intersection points as a place to draw their heads:\n\nComposition from Photos\n\nImages you find online are NOT free to use for commercial purpose.\n\nTo compose your own unique drawing from images, use images that are free to use.\n\nHere are several websites that let you download free images:\n\nUnsplash\n\nPexels\n\nPixabay\n\nStockSnap.io\n\nFREEIMAGES\n\nIn the next example, I used 3 images to compose a drawing:\n\nThen, it is a personal preference how to compose them.\n\nFor example, how big you want the characters to be (they are the focal point in this example), and their location (placement).\n\nTip:\n\nWhen combining several images for a composition, try to use images with same placement of horizon line.\n\nWhat Else Can You Compose?\n\nDrawing (or painting) is story telling!\n\nStart by choosing a subject to draw.\n\nYou can draw beautiful things like landscapes or the animal kingdom.\n\nOr, you can create your own stories. Like comics and graphic novels.\n\nI drew these comics in different periods:\n\nYou can use your drawing skills for a statement, message, protest, or to present (display) an event in your own unique way.\n\nI like drawing guides for my daughter in different subjects.\n\nWith some knowledge in perspective and attention to foreshortening, you can draw from imagination.\n\nFor example, draw your own product design.\n\nAnd give it context.\n\nOr, you can draw unique concept art (for the film industry or computer games).\n\nHere are my steps for drawing objects from imagination.\n\nThe first step is to get the structure right (paying attention to foreshortening and perspective).\n\nWhen I am happy with the composition, I render it.\n\nAnother thing I love composing is maps.\n\nMostly from imagination, though sometimes I do take commission map drawings.\n\nTo learn more about drawing maps, visit my map-drawing guide.\n\nRendering\n\nDrawing takes time. In order not to waste valuable time, it is best to plan for a beautiful composition.\n\nWhile object placement and other subjects covered in this tutorial are very important, the final render should be of a finished artwork.\n\nHere are some tips for creating a final render.\n\nContrast:\n\nContrast helps to create a drawing with a presence, and with a sense of depth.\n\nTo achieve that, draw areas with highlights and shadows.\n\nOne way is to illuminate the object/s is using a table lamp, at an angle.\n\nAnother way is to draw light and shadow from imagination (requires some knowledge and experience).\n\nCast Shadow:\n\nIn most cases, use cast shadow. Cast shadow helps with a sense of space and three-dimensionality.\n\nPen & Markers:\n\nFor a render with well-defined lines, you can use technical pens.\n\nColors add richness to the final render. Here is my review for recommended markers.\n\nRealism & Textures:\n\nMy favorite rendering style is realism with an emphasis on textures.\n\nSummary\n\nOnce you have a correct drawing, and an interesting composition, the next step is to learn how to draw textures.\n\nPlastic texture examples\n\nIf some drawing terms discussed above are new to you, read my guide on how to draw realism.\n\nFor the equipment I used in this article, view my recommended drawing materials."
