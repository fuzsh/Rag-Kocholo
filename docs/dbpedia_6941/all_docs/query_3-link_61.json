        "text": "After her seminal production of Titus Andronicus (2014), Lucy Bailey returns to the Globe to direct our Globe Ensemble in a riotous new production of Much Ado About Nothing.\n\nOpening the season on 22 April, Shakespeare’s energetic tale of jealously, self-discovery and love is the perfect comedy to reignite your passion for theatre and get your summer started.\n\n2022 sees a new Writer-in-Residence take up the quill at the Globe. Playwright Hannah Khalil becomes Shakespeare and Fletcher’s third collaborator in Henry VIII.\n\nThe Tudors… you know the story. But it’s never been told this way before. Directed by Amy Hodge (Women Beware Women, 2020), this historical tale of love, lineage, and power is told afresh from a female perspective. The present may be Henry’s. But the future is hers.\n\nFor the night owls, our Midnight Matinées return this summer with Much Ado About Nothing and Julius Caesar. Performances start at 11.59pm, so as the city settles down and fades away to sleep, revel in the enchanting atmosphere of the Globe under the stars and experience Shakespeare’s plays in a truly unique and magical way.\n\nVisiting the Globe as a family? Keep reading for details on our bumper offer to keep kids (both little and big!) entertained this summer…\n\nThis year marks the 16th anniversary of our annual Playing Shakespeare with Deutsche Bank project, created especially to introduce young people and students to Shakespeare. This March we turn to the spectacular Macbeth, directed by Sarah Frankcom – venture to great Scottish castles, be spooked by witches, and witness gripping battles in this 90-minute version of one of Shakespeare’s most popular tragedies.\n\nThanks to the continued support of Deutsche Bank and their Born to Be project, we are once more able to share over 20,000 free tickets with school children from London and Birmingham, as well as welcoming families to the Globe for their first experience of Shakespeare.\n\nFor the first time in our Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, we’re staging a full-scale show for families and young people, Midsummer Mechanicals, with our friends at Splendid Productions.\n\nThe hilarious follow-up to the play-within-a-play from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, this new play sees those mischievous Mechanicals, led by the ‘unparalleled’ Bottom, as they attempt to recapture the success of their first hit show, Pyramus and Thisbe. We can only imagine the pure chaos that will ensue.\n\nThe whole family can travel back in time to Shakespeare’s London and hear 400 years of history unfold on a Globe Theatre Guided Tour, running throughout the summer.\n\nOur expert time travellers will reveal all the secrets of our wooden ‘O’, and offer visitors the opportunity to discover Shakespeare at the playhouse for which he wrote, learn more about the history of London, and the story of the Globe Theatre itself. For those with little ones, our family-friendly tours are the perfect introduction for younger visitors!\n\nThis year sees the return of Research in Action, our programme of workshops where we explore the weird and wonderful world of Early Modern drama. Join us in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse for Editing in Action where we explore what performance can bring to the editing of John Fletcher’s texts; Translation in Action sees us experiment with translations of classical Hispanic comedia for English-speaking audiences today; and in Perfuming the Early Modern Stage we discover how perfumes, incense, and less pleasant odours were used on stage.\n\nWe also welcome two rising stars of Shakespeare Studies to share their research in These are the Youths That Thunder, our annual public lecture celebrating the new voices uncovering new ideas on Shakespearean times and texts.\n\nCan’t get enough of the Globe? We are now recruiting for Stewards to join our incredible Volunteer Family! Our plays wouldn’t happen without the amazing work of our Stewards, who are passionate ambassadors for the Globe. Benefits include the chance to attend open dress rehearsals, meet new people and, of course, become an integral part of the Globe family. If you have a passion for the arts and an enthusiasm for engaging with members of the public, we’d love to hear from you!\n\nThis month we’re opening our great oak doors and inviting professional performers to meet with our Casting team for Open Meetings. This new initiative supports our ongoing commitment to inclusion and diversity both onstage and off. We’d love to meet actors who we haven’t seen previously in the last two years, especially marginalised and underrepresented members of the artistic community. Our first Open Meeting is this February, and applications are now open!\n\nFor those who are unable to make the trip to London this summer, or would like the chance to catch-up on some of their favourite Globe productions, you can experience the magic of our wooden ‘O’ from anywhere in the globe, any time, with the new version of Globe Player, our video-on-demand platform. There are currently 16 productions available to stream, including shows from our recent Summer 2021 season, with further titles to be added this February 2022.\n\nOur Summer 2022 season opens 22 April 2022 and runs until 23 October 2022. Discover more about the season.\n\nBecome a Member today to access Advanced & Priority Booking from 31 January 2022.\n\nPublic Booking opens 11 February 2022.\n\n*Season multi-buy offer: Book for three productions in the Globe Theatre in our new season (excluding Macbeth) and get 30% off. (Valid on tickets in top two price bands. Must be booked by 23 April. Offer only applies to tickets booked in the same transaction. The discount will automatically be applied when tickets for three or more productions are added to your basket. This is a limited offer subject to availability.)\n\nPlaying Shakespeare with Deutsche Bank is supported by Deutsche Bank’s Born to Be programme.\n\nAnti-Racist Shakespeare is sponsored by Cambridge University Press.\n\nThe redevelopment of Globe Player has been made possible through support from The Linbury Trust.\n\nSummer 2022 photography by Kate Bones.
