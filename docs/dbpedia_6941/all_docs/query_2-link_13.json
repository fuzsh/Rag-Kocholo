        "text": "Part of the reason I went into marketing is because I love creating. It’s also why the topic of the best AI for images intrigues me.\n\nI love writing (surprise), cooking, design, and photography. I also used to paint and sew. But thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), you no longer have to be a lifelong creative to turn an idea into a visual reality.\n\nAI image generators help anyone create visuals that are weird, wonderful, and … weirdly wonderful. (Remember the Willy Wonka debacle in Glasgow?)\n\nBut how exactly do they work and what’s the best AI image generator for marketers? I tested the top options for you. Here’s the scoop.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow do AI image generators work?\n\nHow I Tested the Best AI for Images\n\nThe Best AI Image Generators\n\nHow do AI image generators work?\n\nPlagiarism is a big concern with even the best AI image generators. And it makes sense considering the very nature of how they work. AI image generators create by reimagining things that already exist. They don’t copy. They borrow and recycle.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nThe AI is “trained” on millions of existing images, descriptions, and captions available across the internet. This is how it “learns” what things look like and what they are called.\n\nWhen you enter a prompt into a tool, the AI reaches into its memory of those images and captions.\n\nThe AI produces an image or selection of images it believes fit your prompt.\n\nThink of it like a contemporary singer sampling a song from a bygone era. They’ve made it their own, but pieces of the original are still there and recognizable.\n\n(Author’s note: Britney Spears’ Bollywood sample in “Toxic” will always be a work of art on its own, of course.)\n\nHow I Tested the Best AI for Images\n\nAI image generation can get pretty wild. You can create images in any style and of practically anything.\n\nFor instance, I made one of “a photorealistic orange rabbit wearing a traditional Indian sari and playing an acoustic guitar” using Google’s Gemini.\n\nThen I asked for an electric guitar:\n\nWhy exactly? Well, as I’m sure many people justify their oddball AI creations: Because I could.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, I focused on a common marketing use case: creating an original image for a blog article.\n\nI tested nine of the most popular AI image generators and evaluated them on their speed, ease of use, and image quality.\n\nTo fairly compare the options, I also eliminated variables by:\n\nUsing the same prompt\n\nRequesting the same edit to the original prompt\n\nI also ran each tool three times after each prompt, giving them a fair opportunity to deliver. Consider these my “trials.” This is science after all.\n\nThe prompt: “Generate an image of a young marketing executive presenting information on a television screen in front of a small group of teammates”\n\nThe edit: Generate a photo-realistic image of a young marketing executive presenting information on a television screen in front of a small group of teammates.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nThe Best AI Image Generators\n\n1. Midjourney\n\nMidjourney is considered one of the most powerful generative AI tools out there, so my expectations for its image generator were high. It focuses on creating artistic and stylized images and is popular for its high quality.\n\nPricing: $10-120 per month, depending on the plan.\n\nTest Results:\n\nI’m used to the chatbot setup of ChatGPT, so Midjourney wasn’t what I expected.\n\nTo create, you have to join the Midjourney Discord channel (similar to Slack). From there, you use keyboard commands within chats to have the Midjourney bot perform your desired tasks.\n\nIn this instance, I had to join a “newbie” chat (there were several to choose from) and enter the command “/imagine” followed by my prompt. Then, the Midjourney bot processed my request (and sometimes those of others simultaneously.)\n\nIt delivered four images with each trial.\n\nFrom there, I could click numbered buttons underneath the images to get “upscales” (U) or variations (V) of a particular image. It isn’t entirely clear to a “newbie” what an upscale or variation means.\n\nPersonally, I wasn’t the biggest fan of this process. Anyone in the chat can see your prompt and results and even download them for their own use. Your results could also quickly be buried by others, and you’d have to scroll up to find them.\n\nSpeaking of results, they were quick but varied in quality.\n\nThe AI delivered a variety of styles and included some diversity in its human subjects (no glaring issues with features), but it produced the same settings and poses in each option.\n\nAlso, there was no clear way to edit the images created. I tried responding to the bot to no avail.\n\nMy second prompt resulted in less photo-realistic images — even though I specified that’s what I wanted:\n\nOverall, I have to say I was disappointed by Midjourney. Navigating was frustrating and didn’t produce the quality I expected from the hype.\n\nSomeone with more experience in Discord or prompting it might yield better results, but it didn’t win me over.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nFast (images in under 60 seconds)\n\nMultiple images at once\n\nWhat can be improved:\n\nUser-friendliness\n\nPrivacy\n\nEditing capabilities\n\nImage style variety\n\nPhoto-realistic quality\n\nBest For: Artistic endeavors, marketers with advanced technical knowledge, web developers, or those comfortable within Discord who can learn to navigate the nuances of prompts.\n\n2. DALL-E 3\n\nOwned by OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT), DALL-E is a pioneer in image generation.\n\nDALL-E3, the latest iteration of the tech, is touted as highly advanced and is known for generating detailed depictions of text descriptions. This means users can create original images and modify existing ones based on text prompts.\n\nPricing: It is available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Enterprise users, as well as developers through the API, starting at $20 per month.\n\nTest Results:\n\nUnlike most tools on our list, DALL-E3 generated only one image at a time.\n\nIn a world where a search engine can find millions of pictures in seconds, this is highly limiting and, honestly, underwhelming. But the image quality was impressive.\n\nIt showed detailed, realistic portrayals of people and had no visible difficulty replicating fingers or eyes, as we often see with AI. It also allows users to edit specific image details:\n\nFor example, I requested that the main subject of the image above shift to a woman of color and that the information on the television screen be changed to an Instagram profile.\n\nAfter editing, the photo wasn’t as seamless. You could see where the AI spliced in the new content and certainly did not use an Instagram profile, but I digress.\n\nAs you may be able to guess from my requested edit, where DALL-E3 fell short was its lack of diversity and variety.\n\nAfter running two more trials with my initial prompt, the settings of the image stayed the same — a generic, corporate office, while main subject in all of the images looked very similar as well, and most noticeably, all White or European.\n\nWhile the results for the initial prompt were quite photo-realistic, I ran my second prompt.\n\nThe results were consistent, and the diversity issue also remained. Out of curiosity, I ran one more test in a new chat window and found that all images were now of men, but again, they all appeared to be White or European.\n\nI was able to request changes to make the people in the image more racially diverse, but it took several tries.\n\nStereotyping and bias are common concerns with AI image generators, and that may be an issue with DALL-E3.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nHigh-quality images (crisp, detailed)\n\nRealistic human depictions\n\nAbility to edit image details\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nOnly one photo per prompt\n\nLack of diversity without additional prompting\n\nLack of variety in the setting\n\nLack of control over specifications (dimensions, style, etc.)\n\nBest For: Brands that would benefit from ChatGPT's greater AI abilities. In my opinion, the cost is not worth it just for image generation, especially considering some of the amazing free options in this list.\n\nPro Tip: If you find yourself getting the same results with each regeneration, or requesting edits proves fruitless, try opening a new chat window.\n\n3. Microsoft Designer\n\nDesigner is an AI image generator from Microsoft. It’s positioned as a tool to help you “create social media posts, invitations, digital postcards, graphics, and more, all in a flash.” Many say it’s a Canva competitor, and I can see why.\n\nDesigner uses DALL-E2 to generate images from text prompts, but you can also start with one of the built-in templates or tools.\n\nIts user-friendly templates include stickers, collages, greeting cards, and social media posts. Users can also perform everyday editing tasks like removing a background from an image.\n\nPricing: Everyone gets 15 free generations per day, but this jumps to 100 with a Microsoft Copilot Pro membership for $20 per month.\n\nTest Results:\n\nComing from DALL-E3, I was immediately pleased to see Designer deliver four images with each run of my test prompt. I was also happy to see the diversity in gender, race, and even setting.\n\nLike DALL-E3, the Designer results were realistic from the start (with no face or feature issues), but most still had an illustrative stroke.\n\nNevertheless, after running my second prompt, the results remained similar:\n\nOnce I found an image I liked, Microsoft Designer let me download, copy, edit, or use it in another design on the platform:\n\nWhat I like:\n\nMultiple images at once\n\nHigh-quality images (crisp, detailed)\n\nAccurate depictions of people\n\nLots of diversity (both in people featured and in style/setting of image)\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nAll images are square by default\n\n“Photo-realistic” images still have an illustrative look\n\nBest For: Microsoft Designer is a great free option for almost anyone, but it's especially valuable to teams looking for design flexibility or those heavily invested in social media. Microsoft Designer makes it easy to create graphics using its images.\n\n4. Adobe Firefly\n\nFirefly is design giant Adobe’s answer to generative AI. It can generate art or photo-style images in four common aspect ratios (square, portrait, landscape, and widescreen), and it allows users to select or upload resources for reference.\n\nPricing: Free for 25 credits per month, but premium plans offer more credits starting at $4.99 per month.\n\nTest Results:\n\nHonestly, Firefly immediately blew me away.\n\nNot only was it the fastest tool, but it also delivered four images in various styles, with a diverse group of subjects and some of the most photo-realistic results I’ve seen.\n\nThe depictions of humans were mostly realistic, but as I ran my additional trials, I did spot flaws like missing faces or choppy cut-outs in the backgrounds.\n\nSince Designer has a built-in option for photos, I deviated a bit from my experiment. I ran the initial prompt under the art filter to evaluate the differences.\n\nAgain, they were striking. The results were a mix of vectors and illustrations that employed bold colors, precise details, and visual depth for beautiful results.\n\nThe platform also let me edit the images, generate more based on one I liked, and use any of the images in an Adobe Express design.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nFree\n\nFast\n\nMultiple images at once\n\nHigh-quality, photo-realistic images (crisp, detailed)\n\nAccurate depictions of people (mostly)\n\nLots of diversity (both in people featured and in style/setting of image)\n\nEasy-to-use images in a design\n\nEdit specific details of images\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nHave to inspect closely for flaws\n\nMore image styles\n\nBest For: Great option for anyone, especially as a free tool. Both the artistic and photo results are top-notch and easy to repurpose into design inside and outside of Adobe.\n\n5. Canva Magic Design\n\nCanva’s AI image generator, Magic Design, brings the power of AI to the masses. You can use it to generate images, graphics, or videos in square, vertical, or horizontal aspect ratios, and you can choose from over 20 visual styles.\n\nPricing: All users get 10 free Magic Designs over their lifetime, but if you want more, varying usage limits are available in Pro, non-profit, and Education accounts, starting at $120/year.\n\nTest Results:\n\nWith the initial prompt, Canva delivered four graphic/illustrated images in each trial. Many figures were simple vectors without any defining features, reminiscent of 1990s clip art.\n\nYou can see the results of each trial circled in the same color.\n\nUpon entering my “photo-realistic” prompt, the results changed accordingly but left much to be desired.\n\nThe AI appeared to struggle with recreating finer details like hands, fingers, eyes, and on-screen content.\n\nNevertheless, if you find an image you like, you can easily use it in a new design within the Canva platform.\n\nWhat I Like:\n\nFast\n\nEasy to use\n\nLots of visual styles\n\nOffers video\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nPhoto-realistic results\n\nDepictions of people\n\nAttention to detail\n\nBest for: Those already investing in Canva Pro. This can be useful for art, vectors, or social media designs.\n\n6. Meta AI\n\nMeta AI is a free intelligent assistant from the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The company claims the chatbot is “capable of complex reasoning, following instructions, visualizing ideas, and solving nuanced problems,” including generating images.\n\nPricing: Meta AI is free for all Facebook users.\n\nTest Results:\n\nMeta AI is set up as a chatbot, and upon entering my test prompt, I was floored.\n\nWith each trial, Meta delivered four images — all vibrant, detailed, and in various settings. They also featured diverse groups of people.\n\nLooking closely at the faces, you can see some imperfections. But, for the most part, the images could easily be used in smaller sizes without any concern.\n\nMeta AI also allows you to click into an image to request edits (though this will change the entire image, not just a part, like with DALL-E3).\n\nOr you can animate the images with the click of a button.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nFree\n\nFast\n\nMultiple images at once\n\nHigh-quality, photo-realistic images (crisp, detailed)\n\nAccurate depictions of people (mostly)\n\nCan animate results with the click of a button\n\nLots of diversity (both in people featured and in style/setting of image)\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nSpecific edits\n\nImages are watermarked\n\nBest for: Small digital graphics for social media, eBooks, or otherwise.\n\n7. Gemini\n\nGemini, formerly Bard, was launched by Google in December 2023. Similar to competitor ChatGPT, Gemini responds to text prompts as a chatbot.\n\nHowever, taking a page out of the Google search engine playbook, it can natively understand images, audio, video, and code. In other words, you can upload a video and ask Gemini to summarize it.\n\nPricing: It's free, but “For Business” accounts are available with Google Workspace. Gemini Advanced is also available with a Google One AI Premium plan for $19.99 per month.\n\nTest Results:\n\nThis test was short but not necessarily sweet.\n\nAfter entering my test prompt, I was met with a message saying, “We are working to improve Gemini's ability to generate images of people. We expect this feature to return soon and will notify you in release updates when it does.”\n\nThe ability to create images of people was removed in February 2024, noting that “some of the images generated are inaccurate or even offensive.”\n\nUnderstandably, Google took precautions by turning off the feature but, of course, that makes Gemini unusable in our marketing use case.\n\nGemini can still create images (A la my orange rabbit from earlier), but the instances are specific and cannot include human beings.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nEasy to use\n\nFree\n\nImages are high-quality\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nOn the slower end\n\nNo depictions of people, not even animated\n\nBest for: Creative, abstract, or illustrative images\n\n8. Jasper Art\n\nJasper is a platform trusted by over 100,000 leading brands and agencies, including Wayfair, Ulta, and MorningStar.\n\nIts AI image generator, Jasper Art (only available under Pro plans), promises users the perfect picture to match their messaging.\n\nIt offers high-resolution, 2,000-pixel images, royalty-free commercial use, and unlimited generations, all without a watermark.\n\nPricing: Jasper Art starts at $49 per month per seat or ($39 per month per seat with annual payment), but a 7-day free trial is available.\n\nTest Results:\n\nI learned you can start creating from scratch with “free form” or with a “template” which includes categories like food photography, ink art, news graphic, and storybook photography.\n\nIn “free form,” Jasper Art allows you to refine your creation with a mood (i.e., calm, gloomy, or whimsical), medium (i.e., collage or ink), style (i.e., pop art or art deco), keyword (i.e., black & white or close-up), or language.\n\nFor this experiment, however, I stuck to “free form” and left all of the refinements empty.\n\nJasper delivered four images and took just a few seconds, but, to be honest, the results were lackluster.\n\nThe “young executives” all appeared older and were men with lighter skin tones. Few women were in the photos, and if there were, they were in the background. This was consistent throughout my trials, so, like DALL-E3, I had concerns about AI bias.\n\nFurthermore, Jasper struggled with recreating features like hands and fingers. One image even appears to have an elf leg coming out of a man’s hip onto a table.\n\nLike other tools, Jasper’s results were photo-realistic, but to confirm, I reran the prompt using the keyword filter “photorealistic.” The results were unchanged.\n\nI also experimented with the styles (specifically pop art and acrylic paint) to see how the tool handled those.\n\nPop art was true to its name, but Jasper appeared to have difficulty with acrylic paint, delivering images that looked half vector and half photo-realistic.\n\nIf you like an image, Jasper Art lets you download it in three different sizes, copy it to your clipboard, or share it to X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, or Reddit.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nEasy-to-use\n\nMultiple images at once\n\nOffers templates\n\nOffers high-resolution downloads\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nDifficulty recreating human features\n\nLack of diversity\n\nConcerns of bias\n\nBest For: Abstract or creative images. It's worth playing around with, if you already pay for Jasper Pro, but wouldn’t pay just for Jasper Art.\n\nPro Tip: In “free form, ”Jasper AI offers to “enhance your prompt” with the click of a button. It expanded my prompt and passed the 400-character limit while allowing me to edit before generating my images. While I didn’t use this feature in the experiment, Jasper's assumptions seemed to match the pictures it produced.\n\nReviewing the more detailed prompts may give you more insight into the image it will create by default.\n\n9. Getimg.ai\n\nWhile researching this article, I found Getimg.ai in a Reddit discussion. Redditors raved about it, so I had to see why. With a paid plan, it can generate photorealistic, artistic, or anime-style images, up to 10 at a time.\n\nPricing: Free for 100 credits per month, or paid plans beginning at $12/month which unlock more credits and features.\n\nTest Results:\n\nGetimg.ai generates four images by default on a free plan, and it can deliver up to 10 with a premium plan. It’s also transparent about its speed, displaying how long it takes to generate each image. The images I created took under 30 seconds.\n\nMy immediate reaction: Zero diversity. Except for one or two subjects, everyone in the photos is a white man, and many of them look like they could be cousins, brothers, or even twins.\n\nIn other words, Getimg.ai seems to use the same face repeatedly in one image.\n\nIf this works for you, the tool lets you like, download, generate similar images, or use them in a design. With a paid plan, you can also convert the image into a video.\n\nAs the tool defaults to photorealistic, I once again deviated from my test edit to run the prompt in other built-in styles.\n\n“Anime” delivers some beautiful creative images that are very much in line with what you’d expect from the Japanese style. In contrast, “Artistic” is reminiscent of characters in a video game. I personally expected them to look more like paintings or illustrations.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nGenerous free plan\n\nEasy to use\n\nFast (and transparent about generation speed)\n\nMultiple images at once\n\nCan upload reference images and tell it what not to generate with a “negative prompt”\n\nMultiple aspect ratio options\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nDiversity (in demographics as well as the setting of the photo)\n\nBest For: Creative or artistic images. Brands or marketers targeting younger audiences interested in Anime\n\n10. Fotor\n\nFotor is a popular photo editor and design platform. Fotor has also launched an AI image generator with a user-friendly interface that is a much easier way for users to generate images. This can greatly help users save time and have fun at the same time.\n\nPricing: New users will receive free credits as rewards. Fotor Pro users will receive 100 credits and pay $3.33 for a month.\n\nTest Results:\n\nIn my trials, I have input two prompts to this AI Image Generator.\n\nPrompt 1: In an office, a young marketing executive presents information through a TV screen in front of a small group of teammates.\n\nAs you can see from the user page, my elements in the prompt appear in the two images created by AI. I prefer to generate images in Fotor for its simple and organized page. Users can find a way to start creating images. All we need to do is to type in the content we want to see and choose a favored style. After that, you can receive images within a minute.\n\nThe style called Photography 3 can produce realistic images for us. However, the images can not be as specific as pictures taken by a camera. Some details may be a bit blurry in the images.\n\nBesides, the Fotor AI Image Generator has many functions that allow you to customize the outcomes you want. For the second time, I changed the default settings to create some new styles that may suit my requirements.\n\nFor this time, AI should generate three images in 4:3 as I set. Thus, I obtained three images in different layouts. Like other AI Image Generators, Fotor's AI Image Generator generated images that may have many identical elements, such as the same office and scenes. From this experience, I concluded the features of the Fotor AI Image Generator.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nUsers-friendly UI\n\nPersonalized and customizable\n\nCloud save data access\n\nVarious image styles\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nImage details\n\nImage elements variety\n\nBest For: Creative and illustrative images generation.\n\nPut the best to the test!\n\nWhat you consider the best AI for creating images is subjective. In my opinion, many of the free tools have more to offer marketers than the paid ones.\n\nI was particularly impressed by Adobe Firefly. It delivers some of the most realistic photos and professional-looking artistic images on the list, and it allows you to edit specific details.\n\nFor a marketer who is likely using an AI image generator to create an original image for content or a digital graphic, it more than gets the job done at no cost. On top of its creative prowess, it’s hard to top."
