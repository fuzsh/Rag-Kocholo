When we constantly put others before ourselves, it can result in stress, burnout, and a sense of losing control. The Chaos of Neglecting Self-Priority üå™Ô∏è Increased Stress: Without boundaries, we take on too much, leading to overwhelming stress. üï∞Ô∏è Time Mismanagement: Prioritizing others leaves little time for our own needs, causing disorganization. üíî Emotional Exhaustion: Constantly giving to others without replenishing ourselves leads to emotional fatigue. üòî Feeling Less Than: We may feel less valued and work extra hard to prove our worth, often without realizing it. The Power of Self-Priority üåü Improved Well-Being: Self-care boosts mental and physical health, making you more resilient. üßò Greater Focus: Prioritizing yourself helps you stay productive and reduces chaos. ‚ù§Ô∏è Enhanced Relationships: When well-rested and emotionally balanced, you can give more to your relationships. How to Prioritize Yourself üìÖ Schedule Self-Care: Make time for activities that replenish you, like exercise and hobbies. üó£Ô∏è Set Boundaries: Learn to say \"no\" to overextending commitments. Communicate your limits clearly. üõå Rest and Recharge: Ensure you get enough sleep and take breaks to recharge. üßò Mindfulness Practice: Incorporate mindfulness to stay grounded and connected to your needs. Imagine a professional who always puts work and others first, leading to burnout. By prioritizing self-care, they can bring more focus and calm to their life, positively impacting their work and personal relationships. Making the Choice Remember, giving yourself more allows you to give more to the world around you. Prioritizing yourself is not selfish; it's essential for a balanced, fulfilling life. My inbox is always open for those ready to explore how to prioritize themselves and reduce chaos in their lives. Enjoy the day you create.

I get it. . Being busy is familiar. Achieving is rewarded and celebrated. Doing gives you the feeling of being productive, therefore worthy of attention and recognition. . This way of living though means being stuck in the stress response. The stress response is a chemical reaction your body initiates (by releasing cortisol and adrenaline) when you perceive a threat. . A treat can be anything from you being face to face with a tiger üêØ OR you rushing to get the last train home (your brain doesn't know the difference!) . Being constantly in stress mode isn't sustainable and we all intuitively know it. Then, why some people are afraid to slow down? . My guess (and it's not an absolute truth) is because of the FEAR TO FEEL. . When you rest, you give time and space to your thoughts, emotions, problems, feelings, beliefs to come up to the surface. That can be unpleasant or even painful. Since we're wired for pleasure, the mind will do everything it takes to bring you away from pain. . Keeping busy can be a simple and effective way to distract you from the feelings you don't want to feel (it's fascinating how smart the mind is, isn't it?) . Unfortunately suppressing your feelings or ignoring your emotions won't let them go away. It'll actually exacerbate them. . The best path to become the healthier version of yourself, feeling more centred and good in your body is to learn how to feel the feelings. . This approach isn't easy and that's why I'm here to help! üëØ‚ôÇÔ∏è .

Like many people he'd transitioned to substantially working from home but he had allowed the line between work and home life to blur, overwhelming him. Before Covid he'd been used to commuting to work for about an hour each way and had therefore kept to a similar routine but working instead. As a result he worked a minimum 10 hour days, had constant meetings, didn't take breaks and to meet his targets often worked late into the evening. He was experiencing overwhelming fatigue, low motivation, trouble sleeping and a constant state of stress. Together we set out a plan for him focused on: 1. Recognising Triggers: Recognising what the contributing factors are and knowing what to do when you see them. 2. Implementing Self-Care Routines: Putting his needs first and prioritising his mental, physical and emotional wellbeing. We introduced daily practices such as movement breaks, mindfulness meditation and physical exercise to restore balance. 3. Setting Boundaries: We created 10 boundaries and later expanded this further to 15, such as setting clear work hours, taking a lunch break and learning to say no. Establishing healthy boundaries and communicating them to colleagues was crucial in preventing future burnout. 4. Creating a Support System: We focused on building a network of supportive colleagues, friends, and family members to lean on during tough times. 5. Planning for the Future: Setting him up to win, how to bounce back if you have broken a boundary and using his time for the things that matter to him. It took time to cut through the self-programming he was running and to embed new and healthier habits, clear boundaries and a growth mindset but through consistent effort he was able to regain his energy, passion and zest for life. His transformation was amazing to see and a testament to the power of taking positive steps towards mental and emotional wellbeing. If you or someone you know is struggling with burnout, remember that recovery is possible.

Yep, that was me. But guess what? I cracked the code to crushing burnout and imposter syndrome, and it all started with a simple two-letter word: NO. üé™ Sounds too good to be true, right? I get it. But trust me, it's as real as that morning coffee kick. In the crazy whirlwind of PR, I discovered that saying no was my golden ticket to sanity. üé´ My journey might have started with two simple letters, but it led to a profound realisation: I matter. My health matters. My happiness matters. And guess what? So do you. So, let's promise ourselves this: In the realm of PR, we'll keep saying yes to growth, yes to balance, and heck yes to our well-being. If you're curious about how I tamed these sneaky beasts of burnout and imposter syndrome, check out my article where I spill all the magical details. It's worth it, I promise... üìñ‚ú® Stay awesome üåü https://lnkd.in/eGGThHTW #PublicRelations #ProfessionalGrowth #WorkLifeBalance #SelfCare #MentalHealthMatters #ImposterSyndrome #BelieveInYourself #ContentCreation #DigitalMarketing\n\nHave you ever felt like you're stuck in a never-ending funk? Do you find yourself wondering why your energy levels are constantly low, no matter how much coffee you drink? Tired of feeling disconnected from your work and relationships? A few years ago, I hit a low point. Work sucked, my relationships were a mess, and I felt awful every day. Sound familiar? Like many of us, I was hesitant to seek professional help. Instead, I dove headfirst into research, determined to find answers on my own. That's when I stumbled upon some fascinating neuroscience (a study of how human brains work) that changed everything. It turns out, the culprits behind my persistent low mood weren't some deep-seated issues or major life events. They were hiding in plain sight ‚Äì small, everyday habits that were slowly draining my brain's energy and resilience. Here are just a few examples of what I discovered: Starting my day with a social media scroll (hello, anxiety!) Skipping breakfast or relying on sugary snacks (hello, mood swings!) Pushing through fatigue instead of taking breaks (hello, burnout!) These micro-habits, and others like them, were rewiring my brain for negativity and exhaustion without me even realizing it. The good news? Once I identified these sneaky energy zappers, I could start making small, manageable changes. And let me tell you, the results were nothing short of transformative. If this sounds like you, you're not alone. We're all trying to figure out this work-life thing, often without realizing how our daily choices affect us. Want to feel better and get your spark back? Let's talk about it. What small habits do you think might be dragging you down? Share in the comments or send me message. Let‚Äôs figure this out together. #MentalHealth #WorkLife #HealthyHabits\n\nEMOTIONAL REGULATION you heard about, but you may resist üôà Is the key to preventing burnout and improving your performance. Why is this topic uncomfortable for you? There is a certain mindset around emotions that you may experience in life/work situations, For example: Showing emotions at work isn‚Äôt PROFESSIONAL, Being emotional means being weak, Expressing emotions may come across as being too sensitive or too aggressive, Emotions are good or bad, etc. The thing is... Emotions are in the driving seat of everything you do (or don't do). Unseen - drain your energy so you feel stuck and unwilling to take action. Acknowledged and processed - give you clarity and energy to take action. So knowing about the importance of mastering this emotional art üé® I support my clients to build a good relationship with emotions through: üß† Mind work - understanding the message of the emotion. üß° Body work - feeling and regulating emotions by using tools like nervous system regulation. ü§∏ Action - putting information and energy from emotion into empowered action. My clients instantly report feeling relief, more energetic, And more confident, decisive and relaxed while performing at work, Which leads them to achieve the results they ultimately expect Like wellness, promotion, new job or career transition... Once they experience the impact of emotional regulation Their resistance melts away too, And emotional regulation becomes part of their day-to-day routine and lifestyle. I‚Äôm impressed and constantly amazed by the results, And I love seeing more and more professionals benefiting from the emotional work. Now, I‚Äôm curious, and I would like to learn from you, What have you tried to regulate your emotions at work? What works for you? Let me know in the comments below or reach out via DM üì© Photo series: While practicing one of my favourite emotional routines. #emotions #emotionalregulation #emotionalfreedom #burnoutprevention #performance\n\nAre you able to switch off at weekends and relax? I'll be honest with you - I used to be the person who worked six days a week, late evenings and struggled to not constantly look at my phone to check work emails and socials. üôà I was a victim of 'busyness' and a self confessed 'workaholic'. üò´ It took a long time to change those habits. Firstly, I had to understand why I was doing it (having been ill for 12 years in earlier life and not being able to work full time or do what I wanted drove a feeling of needing to 'prove' myself). I also had a limiting belief that doing nothing or relaxing was lazy. I started to work on changing my mindset first and then impelement small steps to make change. üôÇ Here's the thing - if you try and change too much too soon, you won't succeed as it's too much for our brains and bodies to deal with. üß† There's a reason that we need to do thinigs slowly striving for small, actionable and achieveable steps. üë£ Gradually, I learned how to relax and switch off and in time, I was able to hugely reduce my working hours by taking the pressure off. Nowadays, I LOVE switching off at the weekends and that time is sacred to me. üòä And guess what? I still get all my work done and if anything, am able to do more, be more productive and efficient meaning I bring my best self which ultimately only serves my clients and all other relationships positively. #Psychotherapist #WellbeingCoach #StressManagement #Resilience --------------------------------------------------- Hi, I'm Lisa and I help people rewire their brains for more resilience and less stress. üß† üîî If you like my content, ring the bell to stay updated with my posts. üê∂ I just got a new puppy so forgive the ocassional puppy spam. üß† You can work with me on a one to one basis in my private practice. üé§ I also deliver training and presentations to businesses and schools. üì® DM me for more info or to arrange a FREE, no obligation 30 minute chat."
