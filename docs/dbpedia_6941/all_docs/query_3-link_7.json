        "text": "The paper provides an insight in the retrogression of the protagonist King Lear from the play King Lear written by Shakespeare. It deals with a critical analysis of the evolution of madness or as we say insanity that the character occupies in the play. We begin with a concise diegesis of the plot line and how things transpire for the protagonist King Lear followed by detailed analysis of the instances that lead us to conclude that King Lear is a veritable example of “Reason in madness and madness in reason” as asserted by Shakespeare himself to be the leitmotif of the play. The discussion is centralised on Lear and his actions along with multiple lines and quotes from the actual play. We endeavour to prove our point that indeed it was King Lear only who because of his arrogance driven insanity led himself and his kingdom to ruins. Insanity is a recurring thread in the play and is associated with both disorder and hidden wisdom. Even the advise provided by few wise characters in the play seem mad babble rather a sage counsel. In the latter parts of the play when lear descends into madness, his turmoil and mind reflect the chaos that unfurls across the kingdom, which was once his. It’s only when he has lost all sane thought that he learns to be humble.\n\nAbstract The natural and accepted behavior is that a king should behave like a king. In a different way, a fool might show the conduct of a comedian or a silly person, but the notion in Shakespeare’s King Lear can be seen reversing. As a reader of the play, I believe that Lear is a king and should show responsibility and obligation according to his title. It is expected that the Fool behaves with amusing and humorous activities. This study aims to explore the concepts of ‘irrationality’ and its conflicting ‘wisdom’ to illustrate the profound inverted roles of the two major characters ‘Lear and the Fool.’ Through an analytical and critical examination, the study is meant to expose the comic conducts of King Lear and, on the other side, the wisdom sides of the Fool. The paper starts with an introduction about Shakespeare and the sources of the play, then analytically comments, in its first central part, on the behavior of Lear as a comic person mixing hilarity and inconvenient conduct. It is followed by the second central part, which deals with the aspects of wisdom in the behavior of the Fool. Then the paper ends with a concise conclusion. الملخص: السلوك الطبيعي والمقبول هو أن أي الملك يفترض أن يسلك سلوك الملوك وفي المقابل فالمهرج، من الطبيعي أن يظهر من سلوكه نوع من السذاجة والحمق والفكاهة، لكن الفكرة في مسرحية ’الملك لير‘ King Lear لوليام شكسبير معكوسة، كقارئ للمسرحية، أعتقد أن ’لير‘ هو الملك ويفترض أن يتصرف كملك يتمثل المسئولية والواجب وفقاً لمنصبه، من المتوقع أن يكون سلوك المهرج ينم عن أنشطة فكاهية ومسلية. تهدف هذه الدراسة، في محاولة، لسبر غور مفهوم ’انعدام العقلانية‘ ومقابلها ’الحكمة‘ من أجل إظهار الأدوار العميقة المقلوبة للشخصيتين الرئيسيتين ’لير‘ و’المهرج‘؛ يُعنى بالدراسة إيضاح السلوك الهزلي الفكاهي في شخصية الملك ’لير‘ وفي المقابل إبراز السلوك الحكيم والمتبصر لدى شخصية ’المهرج‘ من خلال إتباع المنهج التحليلي الناقد.\n\nKing Lear is one of the most famous tragedies by the great Elizabethan playwright William Shakespeare. Perhaps this is the most exceptional play by Shakespeare not only for its protagonist’s being an old-aged man who is nearly at the end of his life, but also for its artistic blending of good and evil forces through the whole action-line of the play. Here, as the protagonist is an old king, it is expected that he should have possessed some worldly wisdom being experienced by his lifetime achievements in this world. But unfortunately, the actual happening is the other way round – King Lear, the old king, is trapped by the devilish activities of the evil forces. And this very play, King Lear, is often criticized for its contents of too much exaggeration of the evil forces and their frequent victory over the good ones rejecting the traditional ‘poetic justice’.\n\nThe accurate performance of Shakespeare’s script of King Lear as written requires the presence of true comedy almost throughout: that the Fool be funny, not a solemn, sententious chorus; that Edmund’s black humor glitter to his death; that at least until the final scene Lear himself should achieve more and more witty, satirical, and paradoxical insights – transcending his own subjective misery by sharing in proletarian ridicule of the hypocritical establishment of which he was once the head. Indeed, it is Lear who helps the audience to transcend the overpowering suffering which is supposed to be the hallmark of the play, recurrently reversing the audience’s mood, achieving wonder and delight at these unexpected changes of tone.\n\nOne of Shakespeare's four great tragedies, King Lear (1608) exhibits how error of judgement, the interference of fate and the presence of evil brings one's downfall. The play presents the tragic hero, Lear, who is in an elevated position in his society as a just king but gradually falls because of erroneous judgement and the evil, which is awakened primarily by his daughters, Regan and Goneril. The effect of providence similarly serves for the rise of the evil in the play. Considering himself too old to rule his country, King Lear makes the decision to divide the realm amongst his daughters, by which he shall measure the extent of their affection towards him as their father. However, unable to judge her daughers' love for him properly, he commits a tragic fault and banishes his most devoted daughter, Cordelia, from his court, which triggers the whole chain of tragic incidents (Richardson, 2008, 6). As a victim to his faulty judgement and the malevolent providence, Lear represents the human condition, love and dignity through his suffering and tragic end. Hence, this paper aims to analyse Shakespeare's King Lear as a tragedy reflecting the profound impact of erroneous judgement and the role of providence in one's life exemplified through King Lear, his daughters and evil characters.\n\nThis paper has been written to unveil the moral blindness of king Lear and the aftermath of blind judgement towards Cordelia, thereforeLear has gone through the phase of madness. In the play King Lear, moral blindness has been considered as the metaphorical blindness. Lear&#39;s blind love for Cordelia forcedhim to set up the love test. He was so sure about his younger daughter&#39;s declaration of love for him in a flattering way. But Cordelia did expressthe love for her father in a simple and lucid manner. It was the king who became blind morally after he disowned Cordelia, his youngest daughter. Without any hesitation Lear has banished Cordelia. However Kent advised Lear to reconsider his rash action and told him to see better. Instead of taking the good daughter, Lear took his evil minded daughters based on their spurious praiseworthy words to him. Besides the blindness of King Learwe have seen another example of moral and physical blindness through the character Gloucester. As ..."
