GENERAL 1. Internet transmissions were interrupted briefly during the month due to unforeseen BBC Monitoring Service concerns. The bureau resumed a full transmission schedule by the end of the month once signal standards converters and encoding equipment had been installed. An Internet first was achieved on 18 March in servicing a request from the BBCMS for a copy of an Okinawa Bureau-monitored Moscow TV program \"Man, Earth and Universe.\" The program was transmitted from Headquarters via Internet to the bureau, which passed the recording directly to the General Manager. 2. The BBCMS modernization project continued to progress, albeit somewhat delayed as construction of the new building extension slipped 5 weeks behind schedule. Nonetheless, computer hardware installation remained on schedule for a May deadline. The next phase of the automation portion of the project is software testing which, although not yet scheduled, is expected to take approximately 18 weeks. 3. According to Head of Reception Department, BBCMS, the 2.8M KU band dish at Caversham Park became operational at the end of the month. Efforts were to begin shortly to initiate a cruising program. 4. The Reception Department underwent a major management reorganizaton effective 30 March. Instead of two senior assistants, there will be two \"organizers\" each responsible for a group of monitoring teams. They will also handle non- technical coverage functions formerly exercised by the senior assistant for coverage, as well as recruitment, training and quality control functions formerly the responsibility of the senior assistant for output. Assistant Head of Reception will temporarily fill the position of Organizer, Soviet Monitoring for the English, Russian and Soviet regional teams until a replacement can be found. has been appointed Organizer for European and Middle Eastern Monitoring; i.e., all the remaining monitoring teams.

II. OPERATIONS A. Monitorial/Editorial 1. On 10 March the bureau introduced new Headquarters guidelines on selection from Yugoslav sources of routine party or government documents. This will allow the bureau to hold lengthy TANJUG Serbo-Croat versions in favor of textual processing from the press by Vienna Bureau. The guidelines are being cautiously applied to other East European sources. 2. Effective 29 March, the BBCMS transferred coverage of Moscow in Turkish and Moscow in Greek to Tel Aviv and Nicosia bureaus respectively, thereby implementing an agreement reached at the 1986 FBIS/BBC coordination meeting. B. Communications 1. Despite the activation of Vienna Bureau's new circuit via Croughton Switch on 13 March, several outages, one lasting 5 days, resulted in extensive relay of Vienna traffic by bureau communicators until the circuit settled down at the end of the month. 2. With the installation of standards converters to change Internet television transmissions to NTSC, operators have been undergoing training to operate the equipment, particularly color adjustment of incoming signals for use when the system is fully operational. C. Lateral Services At the end of the month the bureau began distribution of the Muslim World Roundup directly to the General Manager, BBCMS at . his request.
