        "text": "The research on family law reform in Morocco aims to analyze the changes in family law in Morocco after the reform in 2004. The study discusses child marriage and the impact of the reforms on society, particularly in relation to gender equality and legal protection for women and children. This research is normative-explanatory and explains family law reform in Morocco by using a literature review to analyze policies. The results show that family law reform in Morocco has improved gender equality and provided better legal protection for women and children. However, there are still some challenges in the application of the law, such as changing attitudes towards tradition and culture and difficulties in applying the law in remote areas. This research can contribute to an understanding of the changes in family law in Morocco and can be used as a reference in efforts to improve legal protection for women and children in other countries that have similar legal systems.\n\nDeeply modifying the Personal Status Code dating back to 1957, the Moroccan family code (Moudawana) was introduced in 2004 after a long and sometimes dramatic process promoted by Moroccan women against retrograde Islamists and male domination. It was welcomed as one of the most advanced texts regarding family law in Arab and Muslim countries, due to its ability to reconcile universal human rights principles and the country’s Islamic heritage. In a society at half way between the construction of a secular identity and the Islamist revival, this innovative code is considered a fundamental achievement in the framework of an (incomplete) transition toward democratisation. The present paper aims to investigate lights and shadows of the Moroccan family law by showing an overview of the debate and climate of suspicion generated by the reform process, through a snapshot of the perception of the Moudawana among the postgraduate students of the most ancient faculty of the Moroccan capital: the “Faculté des Lettres et des Sciences Humaines” of Rabat.\n\nIn Doris A. Gray’s Beyond Feminism and Islamism, the social researcher and writer states that : “many of the worlds’ pressing problems of the twenty-first century are embodied within Morocco’s borders, including tensions between the West and the Muslim world… the role of religion in a modern society… [and] women’s rights” (Gray 8). The struggle for women’s rights in independent Morocco has been ongoing since independence that was gained in the 1956. Moroccan men who led the movement initially prioritized women’s rights, not because of their belief in women as their equals in society, but as a hallmark of a “modern” or “advanced” country, meaning that this “equality” existed on the surface and did not last long, (Sadiqi, “The Central Role…”). When Moroccan laws were put in place, many were modeled after the French civil law that had so long governed their country – the glaring exception was the personal status or family code which was based in shari’a law. Consisting of a set of laws that predominantly affect Moroccan women, it has been described as being based on : “age-old traditions that give men all of the legal rights in marriage but none of the responsibilities,” (Douglas and Gibbs 1).\n\nThe primary objective of this thesis is to investigate the role of ijtihād in its application to Islamic law in modern Muslim-majority states by analysing its conceptualisations and the jurisprudential justification for its practices. The question of how and why ijtihād operates in legal reforms is addressed as well as what are the motivations, techniques, forms and reasoning adopted when practising it. This thesis involves examining whether ijtihād is exercised by going back to the primary sources, i.e. the Qur'an and the Sunnah or by choosing among existing juristic views in classical Islamic jurisprudence. To what extent the rules and principles of classical Islamic legal theory (uṣūl al-fiqh) are respected and followed in bringing about the reforms by means of contemporary ijtihād, is explored. The main substantive area of focus is family law due to its"
