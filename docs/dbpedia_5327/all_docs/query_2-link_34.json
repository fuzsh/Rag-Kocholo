        "text": "Introduction\n\n1In the last decade, higher education was one of the social sectors most affected by the restructuring of the international economy. The “knowledge society” emerged as both, a buzzword and a driver for change in higher education; it claims to be the reference for strengthening the economies of advanced and less developed countries. Especially for the later, the knowledge society is presented as the key to reshape their economy, from one that relies on raw material extraction and rents to one making use of information technology. Not only had the industrialized countries of Europe, Asia and the Americas witnessed the opportunity to reform their higher education system. Also regions like the Middle East, with a particular low performance in education, saw a new awakening through a boom in new, mainly private universities and new models applied to reform public higher education.\n\n2Morocco and Egypt, two countries with a relatively huge population, large and expensive university systems, and high rates of unemployment of university graduates, stand out as good examples to discuss higher education reforms in the Middle East and North Africa. For a long time Egypt was a pioneer in the development of higher education in the region. Its oldest public university, the 1908 founded Cairo University, created branches in Khartoum and Beirut and sent many professors to the Arab Golf countries, acting there as an exporter of education. Compared to Egypt, Morocco is rather a late modernizer. Its first university, l’Université Mohamed V, was founded after Independence and pursued till the end of the 1960s an elite education grounded in the rule of the French protectorate. But in the last decade, since a new king acceded to the throne, Morocco presents itself as a reform leader in the region, being the first in the MENA to introduce the “LMD system” (Bachelor, Master, and PhD) in its public universities. Egypt also prepared a reform of its public universities with the World Bank sponsored Higher Education Enhancement Project (HEEP).\n\n3Both countries are taking part in the current trend towards internationalization, but with important differences in the application of university receipts. While Morocco chose a more comprehensive approach, mainly through the application of a new selection system for its university leaders, the Egyptian government tried to reform the university by creating incentives for faculty members. The mushrooming of private universities is a phenomenon rather unique to the Egypt and the Mashrek countries, still widely uncommon in the Maghreb. Among other factors, the political constituency of each country seems to have a determining role on the reform process. Morocco’s monarchy with its extensive party pluralism always had less trouble in pushing through “liberal reforms”. Egypt for a long time diffused a more “socialist vision” for economic and social reform. The so far dominant National Democratic Party (NDP) party left little space for other political parties that could have taken part in a negotiated reform process and therefore has more difficulty in adapting to the international higher education market (inter alias Henry & Springborg, 2001; Kohstall, 2009a).\n\n4This article analyzes the path of these reforms, from their emergence to their implementation. It observes the interaction between domestic policy-makers, the university and international organizations in order to understand how both countries adapt to the challenge of reform and how they cope with internationalization. Analytically, the paper renders on a public policy approach, namely the new literature on policy transfer (Delpeuch, 2008; Dolowitz & March, 2000) that explains how policies are informed by policy change in other countries and by the promotion of policy models through international organizations. We focus however on the domestic level and the way international receipts are negotiated. Here we observe that policy transfer and the internationalization of higher education in the aforementioned countries are largely confined to a top-down approach. The scope and the outcome of reforms depend on how policy-makers and other stakeholders do perceive specific problems and what representation they have of the world they live in (Cefaï, 1996). In that sense we observe how a specific policy narrative on the crisis of higher education in MENA countries is produced. Following Claudio Radaelli’s argument we consider policy narratives (récits) as an important resource for policy-makers (Radaelli, 2000). The narrative on the crisis of higher education and its international challenges are in fact the main driver of reform. At the same time a narrative limits the policy choices, not only of decision-makers, but also of those who demand more participation in the reform process. In fact the narrative on a specific type of crisis and internationalization as its proper remedy enables international organizations and policy-makers to impose a neoliberal reform agenda on the university. Even if a “participatory approach” is introduced into the decision-making process, higher education reforms remain confined to elite struggle; the reform process does not include the wider public of the university sector.\n\n5Overall the article discusses reform politics in a specific policy area under – so far – authoritarian rule. It starts with a paragraph on current trends in university reform in the MENA region before it analyzes three phases of the last decade of higher education reform in Egypt and Morocco: the narrative on the crisis of higher education as a phase of problem identification; the fabrication of a national consensus through the establishment of commissions during the decision making process; and the production of change in the university during the implementation phase. The analysis is based on an extensive fieldwork in both countries for the preparation of my doctoral thesis (Kohstall, 2009a). It mainly consisted of non-directive interviews with members of the aforementioned commissions, senior decision-makers, university professors, students and domestic and international staff of the World Bank. These interviews and a careful reading of official documents helped us to reconstruct the policy process during its preparation phase. Four years in the field helped also to observe more closely how domestic decision-makers interact with the university and the donor community.\n\nPrivatization and internationalization of higher education in the MENA\n\n6In the last decade several reports have portrayed the state of higher education in the MENA. The 2003 edition of the Arab Human Development Report was published by the UNDP under the programmatic title “Building knowledge societies”, setting somehow the agenda for reform in the region (UNDP, 2003). The World Bank’s flagship report published in 2008 tempered any enthusiasm with the title “The road not travelled: Education reform in the MENA” (World Bank, 2008). Both reports portray the shortcomings of higher education and research policy in the region and link these shortcomings among others to the authoritarian setting in which these policies are developed. But despite or because of this dramatic situation, many regimes have engaged in relatively wide ranging reform programs. During the last decade the region’s higher education landscape has witnessed a profound change: This change does not proceed towards more equity. Its most prominent feature is an ongoing process of privatization. Moreover, “internationalization” (Musselin, 2008; Teichler, 2004) has meddled into the business of privatization as a less criticized but not less controversial instrument to address change in higher education.\n\n7In general, change in higher education occurs very slowly. Higher education systems are highly institutionalized systems, due to their size (the number of staff employed and students and parents involved) and the enormous impact they have on social integration and economic development (Ginsberg & Plank, 1995). Reform results in this sector may only be assessed after one or two generations have been channeled through the new system. In the ongoing reform processes it is especially difficult to identify winners and loosers of reform measures. The struggle is fought among university elites, barely including the users (students, parents), let alone those standing outside the system (workers, farmers and uneducated youth) (Salmi, 1985). What can be identified by now are a couple of more or less interrelated actions that do affect the university and the discourse on the role of higher education.\n\n8The first change relates to the mushrooming of private universities and the tendency to elite education. Until the end of the 1980s higher education in the MENA region was mainly “public” or state-controlled. Only in exceptional cases like Lebanon and Palestine private universities outnumbered public universities. This changed rapidly during the 1990s: The first country to perform a shift from public to private universities was Jordan. Then, some rulers in the Golf countries realized that they had to invest their money not only in luxury cars but also in universities. With special zones for education, like Qatar Education City and Dubai’s Knowledge Village, the emirs and sultans created islands where international universities could set up their branches (Al-Shobakky, 2003; Romani, 2009). In 1994, Egypt enacted its new law on private universities. Only two years later the first five “Egyptian” private universities opened their doors. In 2003, a German and a French university were set up, beside the American University in Cairo, founded in 1919. In 2010 there are 16 private universities operating in Egypt, beside the 17 public universities. If they account not even for 5% of the 2.5 million students in Egypt, their market share is continuously rising.\n\n9But in Egypt and elsewhere, the phenomenon of privatization is not reduced to private universities. First, tuition fees are also charged for special courses within the public universities. Study programs in foreign language, especially in English, are extremely popular for those who can afford them. Second, a good and valuable diploma is out of reach without a family’s personal financial investment in education. From the Kindergarten to high school, private tutoring has become the rule at all stages of the education pyramid. Combined with the ideal that education is the prime driver for social mobility – a heritage anchored through Gamal Abdel Nasser socialist policies of mass education – even Cairo’s poor invest now thousands of Egyptian pounds (EP) in their kids’ education (a.o. Hartmann, 2008).\n\n10With all the talk on private universities the State also aims to reform the public universities. To do so, “quality assurance” has become the central reference for reform. For a long time education policy was guided by the principle of “democratization” as the way to widen access to all layers of society, even in countries with different economic legacies like “socialist” Egypt or “liberal” Morocco. This policy started to change when the old model went into crisis. After the oil boom of the 1970s, the stagnation of revenues affected all MENA countries and they had to abandon policies like the job guarantee for university graduates and free access to the university. Several measures were discussed to limit access and share the government’s burden in financing higher education, but finally most governments avoided to implement these measures, knowing that the university kept young people away from the street as long as job possibilities had not increased.\n\n13Not only in the Middle East and North Africa university reform is driven by the language of management, bench-marking and efficiency. Recent reforms in France and other European countries have put emphasis on university presidents as “managers of the university”. The State as the guarantor for quality has been replaced by (independent) accreditation bodies. Structural financial funding is substituted by calls for application and special funds that distribute money along the lines of socioeconomic demands and political conditionality. Research centers are renamed in centers of excellence, universities categorized in elite and non-elite universities. There is a deep diversification process on the way – as much in discourse, as in practice, that reshapes the university in Europe and along its borders. While it is intriguing that similar receipts are applied in very different socioeconomic environments, we will focus here on the question how this internationalization emerged on the agenda in Egypt and Morocco and how it was implemented.\n\nProducing the narrative of crisis and reform\n\n14Long before the UNDP and the World Bank published their reports on the crises of higher education, there was a deep consensus among policy-makers, university professors, students and international experts in Egypt and Morocco that the system is in need of an overhaul. The debate on the crisis of higher education started already in the 1980s when universities in the less oil rich countries witnessed the first signs of overcrowding. Still, little was done until the end of the 1990s when both countries started their last and still ongoing reform of higher education. In 1998, Egypt’s higher education minister Moufid Shehab set up a National Committee for the Enhancement of University and Higher Education (NCEUHE). This Committee drew up an action plan that was adopted in 2000 by a National Conference. Two years later the World Bank granted Egypt a credit line to implement the so-called Higher Education Enhancement Project (HEEP) (World Bank, 2002b). In Morocco, King Hassan II started the reform process in 1999 through a Special Commission for Education and Training (Commission spéciale education/formation – Cosef) that prepared a National Charter for Education and Training (Cosef, 2000).\n\n16In Morocco we observe since Independence an elite struggle on education reform. This elite struggle gained momentum in the 1990, when Hassan II tried to integrate the parties of the National Movement (Union Socialiste des Forces Populaires – USFP, Part Istiqlal – PI) into the institutions and finally charged them with government responsibilities in 1998, just a year before he set up the Cosef. Morocco’s professors are mainly organized in the Syndicat National de l’Enseignement Supérieur (SNEsup), which traditionally was controlled by the leftist USFP. It was clear that no reform could pass without the support of this party. While the palace and the USFP agreed on the urgency of higher education reform, they disagreed on the appropriate solutions. However during the 1990s a couple of events occurred that helped to produce a narrative on this crisis of higher education, a narrative both actors could agree on.\n\n17The first of these “events” was the establishment of the so-called Conseil National de la Jeunesse et de l’Avenir (CNJA). Initially created by the king to address the problem of unemployment, it quickly developed into a forum of interaction with the opposition parties. Hassan II created the CNJA as a direct response to the emergence of a new movement; the “diplômés chômeurs” (graduates without job). While the government cracked down on any student opposition, the graduates without job were considered as putting forward a legitimate demand: a decent employment by the State (Bennani-Chraïbi, 1995). The CNJA first addressed the subject of unemployment, but soon stressed the importance of education reform. Especially higher education should become more adapted to the job market, it should be reformed along the lines of a market driven economy. More important was the fact, that the king nominated Habib El Malki, a leading figure of the USFP, the general secretary of the CNJA. Through this cooptation, the USFP took directly part in the king’s policy towards former university students.\n\n20Taking these three “events” together we observe how a shared narrative of crisis of the university emerges. This narrative revolves around three major subjects: the question of employability, the question of public financing and the question of language. The king and his opposition converge on the fact that these issues are the ones to be resolved by any higher education reform. At the same time the debate on the reform is reduced to these three issues. Other questions, like the gap between elite education in Morocco’s grandes écoles and mass education in its public universities are evacuated from this debate. A process of framing begins that paves the way for reform.\n\n21Looking now to Egypt, things are slightly different. The university has a different legacy and the reform emerges in a different political setting. What is similar however is that the crisis is also framed in terms that have little to do with the performance of the university. They also evolve around political choices and a rather diffuse agenda of internationalization. The debate is dominated by the problem of overcrowding, especially after the 9th year of secondary education was sacked. Another issue is privatization, especially after the authorization of private universities in 1994. Due to the hegemonic position of Egypt’s National Democratic Party (NPD), there is no clear cut government-opposition divide. The debate on higher education is more technical from its very beginning.\n\n22In the Egyptian higher education reform process, a professional category became crucial: the professors of Cairo University’s Faculty of Engineering. Before the World Bank started to prepare the Higher Education Enhancement Program it had attributed a grant in 1989 for the reform of the Faculties of Engineering. In this pilot project, the Bank introduced some of the models that should later be used in the HEEP: e.g. the grant based approach and quality assurance. Some of the professors that were confronted with this reform emerged later as the agenda-setters of HEEP. An outstanding exemple is Mohsen Elmahdy who drafted a “manual for reform” (Elmahdy, 1998). In this manual he describes overcrowding as the major burden of Egyptian universities: In the absence of an increase in government resources overcrowding would have contributed to a decrease in the quality of higher education. As in many other reports, Egypt’s university system is depicted like Egypt’s geography: “too many people, not enough land”, an image jointly produced by international organizations and domestic policy-makers to justify their intervention (see Mitchell, 1991 & Mitchell, 2002). The country produces too many graduates without preparing them for the job market. In international comparison there are too many philosophers and social scientists, but not enough engineers, Egypt would have a great potential in terms of human resources, but it would not make use of it (Elmahdy, 1998). These reports – feed by statistics – reduce the university to figures and facts. Reflections about quality are shortcoming, often limited to the simple assertation that “learning in the Arab world means repetition and not reflection” (World Bank, 2002). In the absence of more detailed studies on the problem of learning in Egypt’s higher education institutions, “Mohsen’s manual for reform” framed the debate among Egypt’s main decision-makers: it paved the way for a change of paradigm from quantity to quality education.\n\n23A second agenda-setter was the emergence of private universities. The authorization of private universities meant a major challenge for a country that garantuees free education in its Constitution. Therefore, when the law was passed in 1994, the debate was only at its beginning. While Cairo’s new middle class installed itself relatively comfortably in these new institutions, the government hesitated to grant private universities the autonomy they asked for. For the government the new universities are only an add-on to the mainly public universities. Officially they are not called “private” but “special” universities (jâmi’ât khâssa). Their programs should be limited to those not offered by public universities, but in reality these institutions offer the en vague program most in demand on the job market (medicine, pharmacy, information and bio technology, engineering). The public universities, in their struggle for their faculty that improves its salaries through teaching at the private universities, are pushing now for a second privatization through the introduction of special programs in foreign language or online learning programs. The mushrooming of private universities in Egypt changed facts on the ground. While government officials insisted till the beginning of the 2000 on the right to free education, the growing competition between private and public education for students and teachers persuaded many that there was finally no alternative to liberalize higher education. Internationalizing State universities became the only exit to deal with the growing gap between the public and the private.\n\n24In Egypt, overcrowding and the decrease in quality at its public university on the one hand and the mushrooming of private universities on the other hand became the references of the crisis of higher education that would legitimate the reform of the sector. Holding up in theory to free education, the government kept tight control over all of its higher education institutions. It put forward measures to increase quality and international reform receipts such as the establishment of a quality assurance agency as the new references for reform. Instead of producing a clear cut analysis of the weaknesses of its higher education system it searched for an exit through the application of measures from best practice countries and the international agenda for higher education.\n\nFabricating a national consensus\n\n25The production of a narrative on the crisis of higher education could be considered as the precondition for its reform. In truth it is an ongoing process that is recycled each time when crucial reform steps are undertaken. At one of the cutting point of the debate on the crisis, round tables are set up to produce expert studies, collect statistics and draft a reform program. This practice is known from Western democracies, where more and more sensitive policy issues are transferred to expert commissions before they are debated in the cabinet and in parliament (Ginsberg & Plank, 1995, Zegart, 2004). In the age of democratization this practice is also used in authoritarian regimes. The later adjust in fact to international norms such as participatory decision making through the use of councils, commissions, committees and national conferences (Kohstall, 2009a). As mentioned earlier Morocco’s king and Egypt’s higher education minister set up such commissions, the COSEF in Morocco and the NCEUHE in Egypt, both in charge of drafting a program for education reform. Both countries presented themselves as examples of “good governance” in specific policy areas and achieved to attract financial and symbolic support for their reform programs. The “participatory approaches”, as the World Bank labeled it, was certainly an exceptional moment of party pluralism in an authoritarian regime. Still the process had its limit in terms of redistribution in power. It rather strengthened those in place and enabled them to co-opt reform-orientated actors from within the university\n\n26Moufid Shehab, the Egyptian Minister for Higher Education and Scientific Research, created soon after his appointment in 1997 the NCEUHE. On the one hand a tool to strengthen his own position within the cabinet, on the other a way to gain a credit line from the World Bank, the Committee was composed of 25 stakeholders from the university. Under the supervision of the Minister it should design within a few months a reform action plan to improve the quality of higher education. This action plan was approved in 2000 by a National Conference comprising more than 1500 participants (Ministry of Higher Education, 2000).\n\n27The process was certainly unprecedented in terms of participation; still it showed the limits of pluralism in Egypt’s policy arena during the Mubarak era. The committee itself was composed of former ministers, university administrators (presidents and deans), senior officials from the Ministry of Higher Education and some of Egypt’s big business tycoons from the steel and textile industry. It also included members of the Senate and the People’s Assembly, both notoriously dominated by Egypt’s ruling party, the NDP. One could not identify any dissent voices, neither from Egypt’s legal parties (Neo-Wafd, Tagammu’, Nasserists), nor from the then illegal but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood. Student and university staff representatives only were convened to hearings without really having a say in the committee’s decisions. Finally, the committee rather served as a rubberstamp for an already prepared project. It rewrote decisions brokered between the Ministry and the World Bank in a “national” action plan, adding some of the old demands of Egypt’s higher education policy (building new universities, guarantying free education).\n\n28The impact of the documents prepared by the National Committee and applauded by the National Conference were rather limited. When the World Bank approved the credit line, it accepted to finance only 11 of the 25 projects adopted by the National Conference, and clustered these 11 projects into 6 priority areas. The participatory approach, which was a World Bank’s precondition and then the reason to finance the reform, was full of shortcomings: it did neither discuss the financial burdens of the project, nor some crucial questions such as staff payment improvements and university autonomy. Consensus was produced through a simplified and stigmatic version of policy learning (inter alia Haas, 1992) and through some instruments very common to World Bank reforms: First, committee members were sent on study missions to so-called best practice countries in higher education reform such as New Zeeland in order to learn how things work abroad. Second, the Ministry, in cooperation with the World Bank, organized an International Symposium where policy makers from abroad talked about their visions of higher education reform. The committee moved more and more away from controversial questions, in search for solutions from abroad and from international experts coming to Egypt (Supreme Council of Universities, 1999). Finally it praised such new solutions as the creation of the establishment National Authority for Quality Accreditation and Evaluation of Education (NAQAEE), barely adapted for the Egyptian context (Farag, 2010).\n\n31The outcome of the negotiation process was Morocco’s National Charter for Education and Training, which served as a map for the reform process. The Charter is more a moral contract than a legally binding document. Hassan II’s successor, Mohammed VI, asked the Parliament to translate the Charter’s propositions into laws. In April 2000, the Parliament adopted eight new laws by consensus, without a single vote against it, despite widearranging disagreement with some of its content. Overall the Cosef was a way to produce a road map for reform, which however lacked, like in the Egyptian case, some of the more crucial provisions for implementation. For a long time it was not clear who would be in charge of translating this road map into concrete policy steps and how to handle a national consensus largely imposed by the king.\n\n32In Egypt and Morocco, the politics of commission was the moment to rewrite the narrative on the higher education crisis, bringing education policy a little bit closer to the implementation of the aforementioned international agenda for higher education reform. In Morocco, a formula was found to dissociate the controversial subjects such as arabisation and free education from the debate on education reform. A reform could now be undertaken, without being blocked by the political parties. In Egypt, the government did not cede to emphasize that all reform steps that are undertaken had already been approved on a national level. Both countries had experienced its “participatory approach” and international organizations like the World Bank approved this approach in order to fuel more money into the education reform process. But none of the commissions had achieved the empowerment of the third sector or real accountability for a highly politicized reform issue. As a main result, decision makers in both countries had been comforted through the politics of commissions to the point that they could start to confront the university with change, without being discredited by any of their opponents in the political arena.\n\nConfronting the university with change\n\n33So far our observations of the reform processes remained mainly on the central State decision making level, taking little into account the actors in the university. Despite the participation of university professors in the reform commissions, we cannot really speak about an involvement of the university in the decision-making process. Of course, many of the commission members had an affiliation to the university, but university professors are not like workers. The later act in a relatively secluded space, while professors form a specific professional category that hold often high political ranks and act as experts directly involved in politics. The limitation of higher education to the sphere of governmental affairs stopped however with the implementation phase of the reform, when the university was directly confronted with change.\n\n34Both in Morocco and Egypt the reform measures implemented had only little to do with what had been praised as national reform programs. In Egypt, the reform started when the World Bank adopted its credit line. Together with the government, the World Bank designated six projects, all implemented through a grant-based approach. Moreover, a Project Management Unit (PMU) was set up to monitor the implementation of the six projects. The PMU was composed of Egyptian policy makers and representatives of international donor organizations. The first of the six projects was the establishment of the Higher Education Enhancement Project Fund (HEEPF). The faculty now could apply for funding with projects aiming to design new study programs, to reorganize the faculties’ management and to introduce new information and teaching technologies. This part of the reform went along relatively smoothly as the fund created incentives through financial support. A competitive selection mechanism was established which in a certain sense was shaking up the hierarchy within the university. Its “younger generation” – a reflection of the NDPs “new guard” – was in a certain way more eager to prepare the English Power Point Presentations, necessary to obtain such funding. But the reform remained a drop into the ocean. Mainly those faculties which suffer less from the problems of overcrowding, such as engineering, science and medicine, won a stake in the project, while the faculties of commerce, law and literature, which concentrate 70% of the universities’ students, remained largely untouched.\n\n35The reform became more controversial with a second project, which aimed to establish the National Authority for Quality Accreditation (NAQAEE). Here, it was not clear how universities that were evaluated through the state administration should now be monitored by an “independent body” and how the new competition between institutions of higher education could be settled without new regulations for the redistribution of financial resources. The establishment of this new national body to supervise the university fueled the protest of the so-called 9th of March movement, a small but active organization of professors, initially created in 2004 to fight for the autonomy of the university and to protest against the presence of the State’s security forces on the campus. In an unprecedented step, the 9th of March movement presented an alternative draft law on accreditation and asked for wider independence of the body (El Sadda, 2006). While the resistance could only postpone the establishment of the agency, a new university law, presented by the Minister in 2008 but never adopted, triggered resistance from the same movement. Already in 2001, the Minister had to retreat from an amendment of the university law that aimed to reduce the privileges of senior professors. All this illustrates that the government was not able to overhaul the system, despite the application of the so-called participatory approach in the decision making phase. There was no clear cut division between those who are in favor and those who are against the reform. Resistance steams from those defending their privileges and those who aim to reform the university. The problem is grounded in the over-all top-down approach of the reform, that does not take into account the self governing bodies of the university but deals only with university presidents and deans, since 1994 all selected by the Ministry.\n\n36Contrary to Egypt, where the reform was introduced through financial incentives for the faculty, Morocco’s university reform started through a change in the university’s administration. In a first step, a new system for selecting university presidents and faculty deans was implemented. This new system reflected the overall orientation of Morocco’s political legacy, as it was a mixture of election and selection, leaving the last decision to the palace. The power of university presidents was strengthened, presenting them now as “managers” of institutions which should establish ties between the university and its socioeconomic environment and conclude research contracts with private businesses.\n\n37The second step consisted in the pedagogical reform through the so called LMD system. This international model acted like a “magic wand” for a reform that remained for a long time under debate. Since the approval of the new university law, the Ministry for Higher Education had set up several commissions and committees to discuss the establishment of a new pedagogical framework for the universities. The major challenge was to adapt the curriculum of different faculties and their diplomas to labor market needs and to render the system more permeable so that students could change from one subject to another and from the research to the professional track. In these committees several foreign models have been discussed, among others the Canadian study system. But in 2002 the Ministry suddenly decided to introduce the European LMD model. Already for the study year 2003/2004 the first bachelor had to be introduced, even faster than in any of the European Union’s member state.\n\n39The Cosef’s charter only acted like a national cover to justify the adaptation of a foreign model and to push through a relatively unpopular reform. If most of the professors agreed on the necessity of reform they perceived the LMD reform like a top down decision they had to cope with, without being integrated into the decision process. They felt disposed by a reform that would neither improve teaching conditions, nor student mobility in their respective universities (Ghouati, 2009). Without substantial investments in infrastructure and payments, the approval of new bachelors served in fact only those faculties which suffer less from overcrowding. The comparability of diplomas triggered a new competition between the state-run universities, but it did not necessarily facilitate student mobility. The integration of a common European higher education area remains a lure as long as visa regulations remain unchanged. This is why professors and observers alike consider the LMD as one of Europe’s tentative to regulate migratory flux and a way it gains a cheap working force from the periphery without opening their borders. For some Moroccan professors the reform is another adjustment policy where their government plays the game of the “international community” instead of confronting the needs of the Moroccan higher education system (Ghouati, 2009).\n\nConclusion\n\n40More than ten years after the start of higher education reforms in Egypt and Morocco outcomes remain still unclear. The discourse on the crises that once has put these reforms on the agenda is still ongoing, despite all the efforts undertaken since by international actors, domestic decision makers and university administrators. It is relatively common in many countries of the world to observe such criticism over their own higher education system. But especially in Egypt this discourse is fueled by the resignation over a system that is completely overloaded with some universities listing 250 000 students or more. In such a system most reform measures are like drops into an ocean. Still, it is remarkable how the discourse on higher education has changed and is now jam-packed of wording from the international agenda for higher education reform, from accreditation to benchmarking and quality assurance to ranking. A common language has emerged that shapes university administrators and faculty members alike when they apply for international funding. This is probably the most important side-product of a type of reform that otherwise has not yet lead to tangible results in the improvement of teaching and research.\n\n41This article aimed to demonstrate how countries with a relative low performance in higher education are informed and worked by the forces of internationalization in this domain. In order to push through unpopular reforms and pave the way towards internationalization a narrative on the crisis of higher education is produced that enables to frame the debate in rather general terms. Reforms are not necessarily preceded by an assessment of the domestic situation but by the inclusion of policy-makers into international circles that preach the adjustment towards international norms. The word of a “national consensus”, a central goal of the reform commissions which have been set up, suggests that the solutions adopted are not all homegrown. Interestingly enough the models and receipts finally implemented have little to do with the solutions agreed on through “national consensus”.\n\n42During the last ten years one observes an example of distorted internationalization in Egypt and Morocco. The international reform models are decided and implemented in an authoritarian way despite the application of the participatory approach. For a long time policy-makers in Egypt and Morocco have been building on instruments from the advanced countries without creating the necessary conditions: Quality assurance without better payments, competition between universities without granting them their autonomy. The free transfer of models is yet not accompanied by a greater freedom of movement for the people who have to cope with the effects of internationalization."
