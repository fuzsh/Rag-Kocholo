        "meta_description": "Abstract This Selected Issues paper discusses the assessment of economic activity in Togo in absence of quarterly GDP series. Togo collects about 40 macroeconomic indicators monthly that span a wide range of sectors of the economy. The selection of the variables for the economic activity index is conducted by finding the combination of variables. The indicators are aggregated into an index using a methodology used by the Conference Board. Then an economic activity index is constructed that effectively replicates the historical growth rates of real GDP in Togo. The selected index minimizes the deviations between the growth rates of the indicator and actual real GDP growth over 2002–13.",

        "text": "Problems and Prospects\n\nThe first problem relates to the results. Others are deeper and relate to the design and effectiveness of the adjustment policy. Results can be assessed either in terms of the targets or in relation to the situation on the eve of the adjustment program. After two full calendar years of adjustment program implementation—1984 and 1985—the results by either criterion are hardly convincing (Table 1). Data from 1983 cannot be taken into account in assessing the results, partly because the new adjustment program only came into operation in July, and partly because imports of a number of products were suspended—as noted earlier—in March, and were subsequently only gradually liberalized. The 1983 external accounts were thus artificially improved.\n\nThe balance of trade has continued to deteriorate, notwithstanding a sharp depreciation of the dirham. The export/import ratio has not improved; it has remained very low at about 55 percent. There was a slight improvement in the balance of payments on current account in 1985, but the deficit remains substantial at over $750 million. This has resulted in a deterioration of the external debt indicators, notwithstanding the reschedulings obtained since 1983.\n\nThere has also been a deterioration on the domestic front. The government treasury deficit has worsened in absolute terms and in relation to GDP (see Table 1). Money creation slowed in 1984 but accelerated again in 1985, rising above the ceiling set. The economy’s liquidity ratio has increased,25 heightening fears—by reason of the deferred impact of money creation—regarding the macroeconomic equilibria in 1986. In fact, after a slowdown in 1985, the official cost of living index resumed its rise early in 1986. (It was 7.7 percent in 1985, and 8.8 percent in 1986.)\n\nAt the same time, the rate of GDP growth decreased sharply. It was 2.3 percent and 2.1 percent in 1983 and 1984, respectively, falling below the rate of increase of the population (2.6 percent) and the GDP growth target of 3 percent. Furthermore, it has undergone sharp annual fluctuations, ranging from 2.1 percent in 1984 to 4.3 percent in 1985 (Table 1).\n\nOn the sectoral level, the structural adjustment programs are too recent and their results can only be evaluated in the medium or long term. Agriculture has suffered from several years of drought causing the volume of farm production in constant dirhams to decline by 3.7 percent in 1983 and by 0.3 percent in 1984, with an increase of 12.1 percent in 1985. Manufacturing also fell off in 1984 (by 1.7 percent), but rose slightly in 1985 (by 0.9 percent).\n\nFinally, the investment rate remains high (higher than 20 percent and above the target), and the domestic saving rate continues low.\n\nThe outcome in 1986 will certainly be better than in 1985, owing to exceptional circumstances which are independent of the adjustment program. According to the latest estimates (Table 1), GDP will rise by 5.5–6 percent in the wake of a record agricultural crop; the cost of living will rise by 8.8 percent; the treasury deficit will be DH 9 billion (6.6 percent of GDP); and the balance of trade will improve (deficit of DH 12.5 billion, import cover rate of approximately 63 percent) under the double impact of the fall in the cost of imported oil (minus DH 5 billion) and cereals, and increased exports of manufactured products (by over 24 percent). This, taken together with higher remittances from Moroccans working abroad and increased income from tourism, will reduce the balance of payments deficit on current account to about 2 percent of GDP—an improvement on the target figure.26\n\nThe only dark spot in the picture is the budget slippage, where the deficit remains above the target level, despite the increase in proceeds from the levy on petroleum products, as a result of the level of public investment—although this is falling—and higher Compensation Fund expenditure (the price to be paid for the excellent cereal harvest). In this connection it is worth noting the smaller gap between domestic investment, which is falling, and domestic saving, which is rising (17.8 percent and 15 percent of GDP, respectively).\n\nMoney creation also reflects the still sizable fiscal deficit. Although the rate of increase in the money supply slowed somewhat compared with 1985 (15.9 percent against 17.7 percent), more than two thirds of the new money issued ended up in the Treasury (the rate of increase in claims on the Treasury was 22.2 percent, whereas that for credit to the private sector was only 8.6 percent).27\n\nSo 1986 will be better, particularly as far as the external balance is concerned, but when all is said and done this is due less to the adjustment program than to independent, “exogenous” factors such as an excellent grain harvest, lower petroleum prices, the decline in the dollar, and reduced interest rates. The total value of this advantageous “countershock” can be estimated at about $1.5 billion.28\n\nConsequently, although short-term prospects are favorable, the problem of the design and effectiveness of the adjustment program remains."
