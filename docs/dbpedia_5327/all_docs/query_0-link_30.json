Ten years later, the process is completely deadlocked. Israel has decided to \"remove\" Arafat, and many outside observers are left wondering what went wrong. The answer lies in the fundamental failure of the Oslo process to address the root causes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nFull Story»\n\nHolding Syria Accountable, Though Selectively\n\nBy Chris Toensing\n\nDaily Star (Beirut) September 13, 2003\n\nWith George W. Bush stubbornly insisting that the US is making \"progress\" in the \"central phase of the war on terror\" in Iraq, pro-Israel Democrats and Republicans in Congress figure it is time for phase three. Some think tankers want to train Washington's gunsights on Iran, but next week Congress will reconsider a measure targeting Syria.\n\nFull Story»\n\nHi, and a Low at the State Department\n\nBy Chris Toensing\n\nDaily Star (Beirut) August 23, 2003\n\nAs America's standing with the Arab public continues to drop, many Americans ask just what the world's greatest democracy must do to improve its image. The latest US venture in public diplomacy, a glossy monthly called Hi, is an exercise in American earnestness designed to answer precisely that question.\n\nFull Story»\n\nIsrael's Wall Not Really About Security\n\nBy Catherine Cook\n\nDuluth News-Tribune (August 5, 2003)\n\nAs President Bush's diplomacy with Israeli and Palestinian leaders continues, so does Israel's construction of the so-called separation wall in the West Bank. The Israeli public views the wall as necessary protection from attacks on civilians by Palestinian militant groups. But is this wall really about security? And what impact will it have on the US-backed \"road map\" aiming toward resolution of the conflict and a Palestinian state?\n\nFull Story»\n\nImperial Musings in Washington\n\nBy Chris Toensing\n\nDaily Star (Beirut) July 26, 2003\n\nOn a sweltering Washington sidewalk on July 17, a handful of protesters berated the stream of bespectacled wonks entering the \"stink tank\" known as the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) -- famous worldwide as the home of former Pentagon official Richard Perle and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In the air-conditioned comfort inside, the lusty strains of \"Rule Britannia\" welcomed a capacity crowd to AEI's version of a summertime idyll. We were assembled to hear two vaunted thinkers of the new, new world order debate the proposition that America is, and should be, an empire.\n\nFull Story»\n\nJordan's Troubling Detour\n\nBy Toujan Faisal and Ian Urbina\n\nLos Angeles Times (July 6, 2003)\n\nWhen Washington cites examples of the potential for reform and democracy in the Arab world, Jordan is one of the first countries mentioned. For the first time since 1997, Jordanians went to the polls last month to vote for parliament, and by most accounts the elections went smoothly. Voter turnout topped 52 percent and stability was maintained, with a clear majority of the seats going to pro-government candidates. Islamists, though they later questioned the outcome, added credibility to the process by taking part in the elections rather than boycotting them. In the end they captured only 17 out of 110 seats, far fewer than expected. Jordanian women took a step forward, with six parliamentary spots specially set aside for females.\n\nFull Story»\n\nOccupational HazardsBy Elliott Colla\n\nKnight Ridder/Tribune Newswire (June 20, 2003)\n\nReluctantly, some American officials recently began to use a new word when talking about our presence in Iraq: occupation. Even though the Bush administration worked hard to keep this word out of our national vocabulary before and during the war, it has nonetheless started to appear in press briefings and news reports.\n\nFull Story»\n\nAnti-War Thinking: Acknowledge Despair, Highlight Progress on Moral Preemption\n\nBy Desmond Tutu and Ian Urbina\n\nChristian Science Monitor (March 20, 2003)\n\nIt is difficult not to feel despair and powerlessness at this awful juncture. Millions in the world fought with all their hearts and minds to avoid violence in Iraq. Inevitably, when bombs fall, there is a deep and emotional void that is opened.\n\nFull Story»\n\nUndercover Insurrecto\n\nDissenting murmurs from Stormin' Norman aside, retired military men and defense contractors are full-throated cheerleaders for George W. Bush's Mesopotamian adventure. Nowhere is their anticipatory glee more apparent than at the annual Wallow of the semi-secret Military Order of the Carabao -- a stag dinner and soiree where aging veterans fondly remember American \"empire days\" in the Philippines and sing odes of loyalty to a mythical yet strangely familiar land called Pentagonia. \"Damn the insurrectos!\" the Carabaos bellow, referring to the Filipinos who resisted US occupation in the early twentieth century. As Ian Urbina observes of the rambunctious revelry at the 2002 and 2003 Wallows, one might be forgiven for wondering if the Carabaos hope for an imperial renaissance replete with latter-day insurrectos.\n\nFull Story»\n\nConfronting Iraq: Might Doesn't Make Right\n\nBy Desmond Tutu and Ian Urbina\n\nInternational Herald Tribune (March 14, 2003)\n\nPeople of faith belong on the side of peace. But it is more than just those of all religions who stand against an attack on Iraq. It is also those who put their trust in law. The current moment confronts the world with a terrible decision: will we stand by reason and law or act in force and aggression? There has never been a more important test of the values of average people around the globe. At stake is whether might makes right.\n\nFull Op-Ed»\n\nA Saudi Dissident's Agenda for Democratic Reform\n\nBy Mohammed AlMohaissen\n\nInternational Herald Tribune (March 13, 2003)\n\nFrom Washington to the Arab summit, there has been much discussion lately of reformism in Saudi Arabia, but few have heard from grassroots voices within the pro-democracy movement itself.\n\nFull Op-Ed»\n\nSanctions No Longer Serve US InterestsBy Ian Urbina\n\nLos Angeles Times (January 3, 2003)\n\n\"Word got around the department that I was a good Arabic translator who did a great Saddam imitation,\" recalls the Harvard grad student. \"Eventually, someone phoned me asking if I wanted to help change the course of Iraq policy.\" So twice a week, for $3000 a month...\n\nFull Op-Ed »\n\nIs the US Ready for Democracy in the Mideast?\n\nBy Ian Urbina\n\n(Houston Chronicle November 13, 2002)\n\nThose in favor of an Iraq invasion argue that a regime change will be the first step in bringing democracy to the Middle East. But unnoticed in all the recent national focus on Iraq, recent elections in Morocco, Bahrain, Turkey and Pakistan indicate that democracy, albeit in small increments, has already begun arriving in that region and parts of Islamic South Asia.\n\nFull Op-Ed »\n\nForked-Tongue Warriors\n\nBy Ian Urbina\n\n(Village Voice, October 9-15, 2002)"
