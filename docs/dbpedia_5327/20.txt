Wage Increases: UMT Sounds the Alarm over Government Maneuvers

With Labor Day just a week away, wage negotiations have hit a standstill. The government, which had previously promised significant salary improvements, now appears to be linking those increases to controversial reforms, sparking concern and anger among labor unions.

The Union Marocaine du Travail (UMT) is the only union to publicly react to the government's strategy. In a communiqué released last Sunday, the UMT criticized the government's silence on salary intentions and denounced its efforts to tie wage increases to the proposed reforms.

The UMT reiterated its demand for substantial wage hikes to address the rising cost of living and rampant inflation. The union also called for a reduction in income taxes to support household purchasing power.
