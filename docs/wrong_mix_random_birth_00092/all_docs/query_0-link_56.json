        "text": "FAQ\n\nApplication Process\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nFor comprehensive application information and the link to the online application, visit the Admissions page.\n\nWhat is your rate of acceptance?\n\nIn recent years, we have received approximately 500 applications for 15 spots in fiction, approximately 120 applications for 10 spots in poetry, and approximately 70 applications for five spots in playwriting.\n\nWhen will I find out if I was accepted?\n\nThough it varies year to year, we plan to notify applicants in March and early April. We appreciate your patience.\n\nDo you require the GRE?\n\nNo.\n\nI’m not sure if I have the 12 credits of advanced English requested on your Admissions page. What should I do?\n\nAs per our Admissions page, “Applicants who do not meet course requirements but whose manuscripts show unusual talent are considered for admission.”\n\nMay the 30-page fiction manuscript consist of multiple works?\n\nYes, your 30-page fiction manuscript may come in any form you wish (short stories, excerpt(s) from a novel, flash fiction, or any combination of the above, up to 30 pages). We simply recommend that you send in whatever you think is your very strongest work.\n\nHow should the 20-page poetry manuscript be formatted?\n\nYou may format your poetry as you see fit. Please do not exceed 20 pages.\n\nWhat should be in the personal statement?\n\nYour one- to two-page personal statement should serve as a way for us to get to know you and come to understand why you want to pursue an M.F.A. at Brooklyn College.\n\nWho should write my recommendation letters?\n\nYour two recommendation letters should come from people familiar with your writing, such as professors, mentors, and/or employers.\n\nHow should recommendation letters be submitted?\n\nThey should be submitted online (this will be an option when you’re completing the online application). For more information, refer to the Supporting Documents page.\n\nDo I need to send in transcripts from all of the institutions where I took undergraduate classes?\n\nWe require transcripts from all colleges and universities that you attended.\n\nWhat is an official transcript?\n\nTranscripts must arrive in envelopes sealed by the institution’s registrar office. Your college institution should mail transcripts to the Brooklyn College Office of Admissions.\n\nI am an international student. Is it true that I have to have my international transcripts evaluated before my application will be complete?\n\nYes (though please note that students who received degrees from universities in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom are exempt from this requirement). For all other international applicants, see more information about the required international transcript evaluation.\n\nDo international students with undergraduate degrees from U.S. universities need to take the TOEFL?\n\nOnce you have received a B.A. from a U.S. university, you no longer need to submit your TOEFL scores to apply to the M.F.A. program.\n\nMay I apply to two different genres?\n\nNo, you may only apply to one genre per year.\n\nWhat are the program codes for Fiction, Playwriting, and Poetry?\n\nFiction—324\n\nPlaywriting—325\n\nPoetry—327\n\nIs there any way I can check my application status online?\n\nYes. Once you’ve completed your application, you may check online for status updates.\n\nI was not accepted to your program. Can you provide feedback on my application?\n\nBecause of the large number of qualified applicants, we may not be able to accept very strong candidates, nor can we offer specific feedback on individual applications. Note that the manuscript is by far the most important element of the application. We encourage interested applicants to reapply in the future.\n\nHow do I reapply?\n\nAs per the Graduate Admissions Office website, “To reapply, you need to complete and submit a new graduate degree application online. You do not need to resubmit any supporting documents (i.e. transcripts, letters of recommendation) if you applied within the last two years.” The $125 application fee is waived for re-applicants for up to one year. (If you applied for fall 2014 entry, for instance, you may reapply for fall 2015 without paying an additional fee.) You must send a new personal statement and manuscript to the Department of English each time you reapply.\n\nGetting to Know the Program\n\nDo you hold an Open House?\n\nYes. Information will be available soon.\n\nMay I speak to a current or recent student?\n\nYes. Please see the student and alumni lists within each specialization.\n\nMay I come and visit an M.F.A. class?\n\nIn most cases, prospective students are permitted to visit classes once they’ve been accepted into the program.\n\nCan you send me printed materials about the M.F.A. program?\n\nComprehensive information about our program, including the online application, is available on our website and on the more general Brooklyn College website under “Graduate Programs” and “Admissions.”\n\nMay I take a class in the Brooklyn College M.F.A. program as a nonmatriculated student?\n\nBecause of the small size of our program, only students matriculated in our M.F.A. program may take our graduate creative writing classes.\n\nWhere can I obtain information pertaining to international students?\n\nThe Brooklyn College Office of International Student Services will assist you with immigration issues, financial aid, and housing.\n\nFinancial Information\n\nWhat is the cost of tuition?\n\nUp-to-date tuition information is available on the Bursar’s website.\n\nHow many credits are required for the M.F.A. program?\n\nUnlike other masters students, M.F.A. students take a nine-credit-per-semester load. Tuition should be calculated based on nine credits per semester.\n\nDo you offer funding?\n\nYes. In addition to the salary for teaching undergraduate composition, our graduate students are eligible to receive some departmental funding. There is no special application for this funding; all admitted students will be considered automatically. The Office of Financial Aid primarily helps students obtain federal student loans and, if they are eligible, Work-Study funding. All students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which can be submitted online.\n\nDo you offer teaching opportunities?\n\nYes. Students who wish to teach while they are enrolled in the M.F.A. program, but who don’t have prior composition teaching experience at the college level, are required to take English 7506, Practicum in Teaching College-Level Composition (which counts toward the M.F.A. degree requirements as an elective). The course includes a tutor-internship in an instructor’s classroom. After completing 7506, students may be assigned to teach their own section of a composition course, English 1010 or English 1012. The salary for one section of English 1010 or English 1012 is $6,875. Students may teach for up to three years, starting while they are students in the program and continuing after they graduate. There are also teaching opportunities at other CUNY schools.\n\nI am an international student. How would this affect my employment opportunities at the university?\n\nInternational students on F-1 Student Visas are permitted to work or teach up to 20 hours per week while they are in the program, and eligible to continue doing so, full-time, for one year after graduation, if the work is in the field for which they received the degree.\n\nDo you offer a part-time, low-residency, or online option?\n\nNo.\n\nDo you offer a health insurance plan?\n\nHealth insurance is available via the New York State of Health Insurance Exchange, as per the Affordable Care Act, where you can search for insurance plans.\n\nFaculty\n\nJulie Agoos\n\nJulie Agoos is professor and coordinator of the Poetry specialization.
