        "text": "But if there is any public perception that ground was lost, it is not shared by Wesley Snipes.\n\nClearly, producers believe Snipes still carries some power with audiences. And the actor doesn’t just believe it — it’s an article of faith. He is quick to point out that he never stopped working, and his filmography bears it out. Between 2004’s \"Blade: Trinity” and \"Brooklyn’s Finest,” Snipes starred in seven movies. That’s keeping pace with his current co-stars.\n\n\"Interestingly enough, I don’t see how it’s had a negative effect. I’ve been working quite a bit, and I have more work now than I could possibly be able to do,” Snipes said, letting out a hearty laugh. \"The key for me is that I’m not a ‘sit around and wait to be given’ kind of person. I create, or I go out and find people who help me create what needs to be done.”\n\nBut as the famous line from \"Sunset Boulevard” goes, it’s the pictures that got smaller. In October 2006, Snipes received an eight-count tax fraud indictment, with the IRS claiming he filed $11 million in false refunds. A year and a half later, Snipes was cleared of all felony counts but was convicted on three misdemeanor charges for not filing three years’ worth of returns. Snipes could spend up to three years in prison but is free pending an appeal.\n\nSo, for a while, Snipes worked overseas in films such as \"The Contractor,” \"The Detonator,” \"Chaos” and \"The Marksman,” all of which went directly to DVD in the U.S. market. It was a significant comedown from a time when Snipes was one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood, appearing in the \"Blade” films, \"U.S. Marshals,” \"White Men Can’t Jump” and \"New Jack City.”\n\nIf anything, \"Brooklyn’s Finest” showcases the skills that went missing when Snipes had trouble getting domestic work. He plays Caz, a convicted drug dealer recently sprung from prison, where he saved the life of Clarence \"Tango” Butler, an undercover cop played by Cheadle. When Snipes first discussed \"Brooklyn’s Finest” with director Antoine Fuqua (\"Training Day”), he was not sure which role was being offered.\n\n\"I thought, ‘This character Tango is good.’ I can rock this, no problem,’” Snipes said. \"And then I called him back and said, ‘Tango, right?’ and he said, ‘No — Caz.’ But he told me Don Cheadle would be in the film, and I accepted.”\n\nSnipes is receiving positive reviews for his performance, a sign that his fortunes are on the rebound. He’s been talking to his \"Jungle Fever” director, Spike Lee, about starring in a James Brown biopic, and he has Web projects and more films in the works. If the movie world is ready for Wesley Snipes again, he is prepared.\n\n\"I’m always flexible and always open, and the trick is to maintain the instrument, keep it sharp and be ready to rock ’n’ roll whenever the call comes,” he said."
