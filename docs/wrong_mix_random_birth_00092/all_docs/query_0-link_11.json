        "text": "I didn’t grow up watching Liz Taylor. Audrey Hepburn, neither. Sorry. Give me Pam Grier as Foxy Brown any day with that delicious Afro and sun-kissed melanin. Or a soft spoken, milk chocolate Whitney Houston in The Bodyguard. Even when Whitney talks, her voice sounds like honey. I didn’t grow up watching Clint Eastwood. I’m cool with Wesley Snipes as ‘Blade‘ or Samuel L. Jackson as that bad motha—yeah, I’m just talkin’ bout Shaft. No role Tom Cruise ever played made me cry but I remember sobbing in theaters after losing Creasy in “Man on Fire” (Never mind who you thought your favorite was, Denzel is the DON!). And I couldn’t get my shit together for a WEEK after watching Sometimes in April starring Idris Elba before the world knew how fine he was/is. No shade to our melanin-less brothers and sisters, but this is my truth. Unfortunately, Hollywood rarely sees my people the way I d0– as vibrant, soul-stirring, tear-jerking bonafide ICONS.\n\nSoul Food. Malcolm X. Crooklyn. Friday. Hoodlum. The Color Purple, naturally. I remember loving them so much because the people looked like me. They talked like me. Jammed like I did. We had similar cuisine choices. The soundtracks always reflected music I could be listening to on any given day. And I grew up knowing Angela Bassett, Cicely Tyson, Loretta Devine, Lynn Whitfield and more like my mothers, sisters and aunties. I looked at Denzel Washington as my Adonis and I would have kissed him on the cheek if he ever stepped into my living room, which I often dreamed he would (Romantic or paternal kiss? That is still to be determined. Sue me. He’s still fine).\n\nFilm producers rarely support “black” financially whether that be hiring black actors or “black films” in general. They think black actors don’t have “Blockbuster” quality. They also think black people don’t show up to pay for films. You’ve even got one of the most successful Hollywood directors, Woody Allen, saying stupid ish like he won’t put black people in films unless he writes “a story that requires it“. I guess that means unless he’s got a slave character or a single mother or a taxi driver? You know, subservient or down-trodden positions because that’s how society prefers people of color on and off the big screen. If Woody were to ask me (and dang if I don’t wish he would/could), I’d say including people of color is ALWAYS necessary. And I don’t just mean blacks. I mean Asians. Hispanics. Indians (real ones). Africans. Aren’t movies supposed to reflect real life? And even if it’s a Sci-Fi movie, doesn’t it have some sort of natural human aspect to it? As often as you see black people or Hispanics or Asians on the streets of Brooklyn or Los Angeles or Indiana is how often they need to be included in films. How can you adequately depict real life without us? It’s unrealistic. You can’t go to the White House and miss people of color no more than you can walk up the street to your corner store, so what gives?\n\nWe do. We give our money. We give our time. We come out and support even if Anthony Mackie is the only black guy in the film and has only a 2 minute monologue. Even if America Ferrera is only playing a cashier at the beginning of the film. We need to turn out in droves for somebody besides Tyler Perry (i.e. Best Man & Best Man Holiday). Especially when one of our own stars as one of the most iconic entertainers in the history of music–white or black. We turn out in record numbers to represent for the colored folks of America that Hollywood likes to write off as not worth depicting and not worth hiring.\n\nHead out to see “Get On Up” in theaters and watch Chadwick Boseman turn up for us one time for your mind. He didn’t just play James Brown. He became James Brown, even standing a foot or so above Brown’s real height and being a bit sexier depending on the woman you ask. Boseman did a damn good job and he’s supposed to. He’s a trained, paid actor. He deserves just as much attention and accolades as Matthew Mcconaughey, Tom Hanks and Mark Wahlberg. So let’s give it to him and every other working actor of color.\n\nWe show them the value of having black folks and they’ll have black folks. We shouldn’t have to play the game this way but since we do? Let’s play for effing KEEPS. This is why on opening night this Friday, I dragged mine and my boyfriend’s butt out to see “Get On Up” even though my aching back reminded me I’d worked all day. I wanted to catch it OPENING night. Being there and learning more about James Brown and his influence in entertainment and general American culture showed me my trip was worth it. The elderly guy next to me with his cowboy hat chuckling and misty-eyed while he watched his generation’s Jay-Z (termed loosely), proved it to me further. After seeing it, I told friends about it and encouraged them to catch it when they could. Hollywood wants to play the numbers game so let’s match ’em seat for seat. Ticket for ticket. Dollar for dollar. Film after film! Let’s show them that we count. That we MATTER and we ALWAYS did.\n\n#SupportPeopleofColor #SupportBlackActors #SupportBlackActresses"
