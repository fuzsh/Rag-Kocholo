        "text": "(The following is an adaptation of an assignment from my MBA course.)\n\nJames Brown, the “Godfather of Soul,” the “Hardest Working Man in Show Business” – with his breathtaking shows and his unrivalled ecstatic energy he became a legend in his lifetime. He revolutionised pop music and became a role model for such diverse musicians as Michael Jackson, Bob Marley and Miles Davis, his “Say It Loud – I’m Black and I’m Proud” became an anthem for the civil rights movement. Brown was also a successful and pioneering entrepreneur. In these roles, pop star and businessman, he exhibited some of the best – and worst – leadership characteristics. This post will evaluate the traits that have led to Brown’s success – and downfall – and trace them back to his upbringing.\n\nBrown was born in 1933 in South Carolina, he grew up under impoverished circumstances. His mother left when he was four and he was raised in a brothel run by his aunt Honey. He worked as a tout, taking cash from army recruits and steering them to the brothel (Smith, 2012: 65). In the late 1940s he was arrested for armed robbery and sentenced to juvenile detention. With the help of the family of gospel singer Bobby Byrd, Brown was released after four years. He began singing in Byrd’s gospel group, the start to his music career. His 1963 album \"Live At The Apollo\" signalled his final breakthrough into the mainstream. It sold more than a million times and stayed in the album charts for more than a year (Guralnick, 1986: 226).\n\nBrown also “made entrepreneurialism groovy” (Smith, 2012: 450). He started a trading-stamp company and a chain of fast-food restaurants. In 1969 the National Business League voted him their Businessman of the Year (ibid.).\n\nWhat are the leadership traits that made a poor black boy from the deep American South so successful? How did he, despite the many ups and downs of his career, become one of the greatest artists of all time (Rubin, n.d.)?\n\nOne of Brown’s most prominent leadership traits was perseverance. As a boy he endured violence, abandonment and poverty. He wore old flour bags for underwear (Smith, 2012: 86). Jobs he had before he turned 16 included picking cotton, cutting down sugarcane, collecting bottle caps, delivering liquor and shining shoes (ibid.: 65). The only person he could rely on was himself: “Nobody had ever given him anything for free. He had amassed a fortune by running faster than everybody else” (ibid.: 446).\n\nAs DuBrin (2012) notes, there are several leadership traits that positively relate to each other: self-esteem, locus of control and generalised self-efficacy (DuBrin, 2012: 40). Brown embodied these general personality traits and task related traits. As a result of his upbringing he “projected a powerful sense of determination. He could take a punch and come back with another. He believed in himself” (Smith, 2012: 65). He believed fundamentally in his capacity to take charge, he had the courage to face challenges, he had a “fierce drive” (ibid.: 109) and passion for his work. This “drive and achievement motive” (DuBrin, 2012: 53) was closely related to his resilience, the ability to bounce back from a setback through continuous effort (ibid.): “He could be tortured, but when he survived it, he would brandish that survival as a sign that he was special. You would have died, but James Brown did not” (Smith, 2012: 66).\n\nAs a stage performer Brown was also blessed with the “divinely inspired gift” (DuBrin, 2012: 73) of charisma. To call him a “a colourful personality” (ibid.) would be a understatement. His charisma was more aligned with Weber’s definition of the term. His personality had a certain quality “by virtue of which he [was] considered extraordinary and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman powers” (Weber quoted by Oakes, 1997: 27). His fans were a source of these “powers,” he used this force to inspire them and the civil rights movement, he took risks – he financed the “Live At the Apollo” album himself when his record company did not believe in its commercial viability – he was a self-promoting personality and dramatic in significant ways: all traits of a charismatic, transformational leader (DuBrin, 2012: 77-80).\n\nBrown’s entrepreneurial drive was likewise reflected in his leadership style. Behaviours associate with this style include a strong achievement drive, a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, constant hurry combined with impatience, a visionary perspective combined with tenacity as well as a dislike for hierarchy (DuBrin, 2012: 128-130). Brown innovated the music businesses and its practices (Smith, 2012: 187), he challenged the white establishment and its perception of black businessmen (ibid.: 521-522) and was famously impatient (Lethem, 2010). His focus on his fans, the “external customers” (DuBrin, 2012: 130) earned him the reputation of the hardest working man in show business: He studied the audience’s reaction and changed the tune if he had to, all to keep the fans entertained (The Passionate, Turbulent Life Of James Brown, 2012).\n\nThis entrepreneurial bent was formed at a young age: None of his later jobs “taught him anything he didn’t already know from living in a whorehouse. Brown came to see there was not too much a stack of greenbacks couldn’t buy, and whatever it was, by definition it wasn’t worth having” (Smith, 2012: 65).\n\nHowever, as DuBrin points out, the entrepreneurial personality, if carried to the extreme, can lead to addictive behaviour, including substance abuse (DuBrin, 2012: 131). This hints at the problematic leadership traits of Brown, a lot of which are indeed owed to him pushing his passions to the limit.\n\nSubstance abuse became a problem later in his life when he developed a PCP habit (Smith, 2012, 667). This went together with domestic abuse (ibid.). This lack of warmth and support was also reflected in his conduct with his musicians. He created a draconian regime that demanded loyalty and imposed high fines if someone appeared late for a rehearsal. “Usually Brown fined his band five or ten dollars for making a mistake, but this time, he put out the word that if you flubbed a note at the Apollo, it would be fifty to a hundred” (Smith, 2012: 219). As a result, his employee turnover was very high, beginning with Bobby Byrd’s gospel group which formed the basis of his career (Holden, 2014).\n\nOne of the common threads in leadership literature is that leadership primarily defines itself as support for followers. Under reference to Block, DuBrin explains that leadership can be conceptualised as a partnership in which “the leader and the group members are connected in such a way that the power between them is approximately balanced” (DuBrin, 2012: 4).\n\nSimilarly, Smollan and Parry explain how leadership revolves around notions of support. They conclude “that when followers perceived that their leaders genuinely responded to their emotions, they invariably felt a degree of psychological support and tended to adopt more positive attitudes towards the change” (Parry & Smolan, 2011: 448). Aspects of this include individualised consideration as part of the ability to respond appropriately to followers’ emotions (ibid.: 451) but also a necessity for leaders to regulate their own emotions (ibid.: 449).\n\nThis necessity is also discussed by Avolio and Gardner when they explain how the concept of authenticity facilitates forms of leadership as partnerships: “authentic leadership development involves ongoing processes whereby leaders and followers gain self-awareness and establish open, transparent, trusting and genuine relationships” (Avolio & Gardner, 2005: 322). Self-awareness and self-regulated positive behaviours are seen as enacted in an emerging process where one continually comes to understand oneself (ibid.: 321, 324).\n\nBrown showed hardly any of these traits. He who only believed in himself was a “monumental egotist, perfectionist and harsh taskmaster with a streak of paranoia, [he] reigned as the absolute monarch of his personal kingdom, answering to no one but himself” (Holden, 2014). As a result, he lost employees and friends, eventually served several years in prison for substance abuse and violence and saw his business empire crumble (Smith, 2012: 619).\n\nThis post evaluated the traits that have led to James Brown’s success – and downfall – and traced them back to his upbringing. It showed that his persistence, passion and resilience was borne out of an upbringing characterised by deprivation. Brown coped with adversity and grew stronger with it and as a result became a celebrated and highly influential artist. At the same time, the lack of compassion that he experienced as a child translated into a conduct that drove his egocentricity and fervour to the extreme and resulted in prosecution and heavy financial losses.\n\nPhoto credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/heiner1947/4430588088/in/set-72157623613839496/ (Heinrich Klaffs )\n\nReferences:\n\nAvolio, B.
