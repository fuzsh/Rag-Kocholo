        "text": "Well this is my favorite story to tell, the story of me! Oh wait, this is supposed to be non-fiction. Full transparency, bios are hard. Do you write them in the first person or the third person? First person makes me wanna vomit with how many sentences inevitably contain the word “I”, and then I drive myself crazy trying to re-write them so that I feel less like a narcissist. Third person is weird because I know I’m talking about myself in the third person, so now I add pretentiousness to the mix of narcism. Unavoidable outcome of writing a bio… I become a Stan for myself, AND I have the opening topic for my next therapy session. Maybe the next bio I write, I’ll try the Royal “We”, could be fun. With that said…\n\nJames Brown III was born on November 3rd, 1980 in Baltimore, MD. and raised in Orange County, CA. Growing up, his parents allowed him to explore any and every passion he had including: Psychology, Track & Field, Drama, Football, Gymnastics, Dance, Music, TV/Film, Religious Studies, and Fashion. James went to Dana Hills High School and Phillips Andover Academy for his secondary education, Brown University and The Fashion Institute of Technology for his undergraduate education. While at Dana Hills he graduated Valedictorian, a 4 year 2 sport varsity letterman athlete (Track & Field and Football), National Honor Society Member, International Thespian Society Member, Homecoming King and Prom King, and a member of the Student Government. Brown went on to study psychology at Brown University while competing nationally in Track & Field and became a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. Psychology research on male dancers brought James to New York City and presented him with the opportunity to dance with Michael Jackson at Madison Square Gardens. His career as a performer began that summer in 2001. He was technically a college dropout at that point, but James would later return to Brown University in 2022 to complete his Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology in 2023. James is currently at The Wharton School (The University of Pennsylvania) getting his MBA through the MBA for Executives Program.\n\nJames Brown III is also the Chief Creative Officer and co-founder of Story House Pictures, Inc. which is developing Story House Village, a thoughtfully designed 240+ acre community for all ages and lifestyles honoring the beauty of the land and pioneering a sustainable film industry in Wyoming by building state-of-the-art film studios as an anchor tenant. His former production company, Tríonóide Entertainment, LLC., was acquired by SHP, Inc. where James produced two award winning films, White Flags, and most recently, Early Light. Early Light was shot in Sheridan, Wyoming in partnership with CHAPS Equine Assisted Therapy and 12.5% of the film’s capital raise and proceeds were awarded to this Wyoming based organization dedicated to treating Veterans and children living with a myriad of mental challenges. The film has been selected in dozens of film festivals over the last year and was the catalyst to this journey of bringing a major film studio to Wyoming.\n\nBrown III founded Broadway Style Guide, a popular web-based lifestyle magazine focused on bridging the gap between Fashion and Broadway, where he served as the magazine’s Creative Director & Fashion Editor until he sold the brand to TodayTix in a major acquisition in 2018. He also served as Fashion Editor of Chill Magazine, produced by Out. Along with his father James Brown Jr., actor Boris Kodjoe, and Patrick Kodjoe, Brown III is a co-founder of World of Alfa, a web-based tailor made suit and clothing company. James’ experience and knowledge of fashion and design also extended to him costume designing two Broadway shows, two films, and a music video, styling countless celebrities, and working as Artistic Director for a niche fashion label, Harbison. With over 10 years of marketing, creative directing, artistic directing, design, journalism, and writing experience, James Brown III is the perfect person to lead the creative vision of Story House."
