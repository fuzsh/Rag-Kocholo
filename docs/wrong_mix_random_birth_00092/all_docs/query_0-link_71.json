        "text": "THE HIP HOP NUTCRACKER TOUR FIRST TIME AT KINGS THEATRE\n\nHip Hop Pioneer Kurtis Blow Returns\n\nBROOKLYN, NY – The Hip Hop Nutcracker, a contemporary dance spectacle set to Tchaikovsky’s timeless music, is set to return to the New York and New Jersey area this holiday season. The Hip Hop Nutcracker will feature Kurtis Blow, one of hip hop’s founding fathers, opening the show with a short set before rapping the introduction. This is the first year the show will play the Kings Theatre after 3 successful years of touring. Tickets are on sale now through Ticketmaster: http://bit.ly/2ijr9kv ($79 / $59 / $39 / $29 – priced by section) and show is Saturday December 16 at 8pm.\n\nDirected and choreographed by Jennifer Weber and co-created/written by Mike Fitelson in 2014, The Hip Hop Nutcracker is a full-length production featuring a dozen all-star dancers, an on-stage DJ and an electric violinist. The traditional classic Tchaikovsky score beautifully complements the power moves of these 12 dancers, with transitional and incidental music re-mixed and re-imagined, helping to bring a beautifully surprising contemporary vibe to the production.\n\n“We’ve got some of the best dancers in the world performing in a show that is being reimagined in a truly spectacular way,” says Blow. “The creative team has turned this old classic into a new classic, and audiences love this new adaptation everywhere we go.”\n\nJust like the classic Nutcracker story, in The Hip Hop Nutcracker Maria-Clara and the Nutcracker prince go on a dream adventure battling a gang of mice, visiting the land of sweets and learning the lessons of the holiday season. Innovative digital graffiti and visuals transform the landscape of E.T.A. Hoffmann’s beloved story from traditional 19th Century Germany to the vibrant, diverse sights and sounds of a colorful and contemporary New York City. Through the modern, self-expressive gaze of hip hop culture, the dynamic performers of The Hip Hop Nutcracker celebrate the magic of the entire holiday season on the most inclusive holiday of them all – New Year’s Eve, a time for new beginnings.\n\nFor more about The Hip Hop Nutcracker and to find information about where to purchase tickets, please visit: http://hiphopnutcracker.com/#tours\n\nFollow The Hip Hop Nutcracker on social media\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thehiphopnutcracker/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hiphopnutcracker/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hhnutcracker/\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWpqgbYykPixFpjG95rA_xg\n\nJENNIFER WEBER (Director/Choreographer) is an award-winning director-choreographer whose career has spanned concert dance, commercial events, theatre and TV.
