        "text": "UPLAND, Calif. - James R. Brown, 70 years old, of Upland, California passed away May 9, 2024.\n\nJim's parents were Bob and Barbara Brown from Switz City, Indiana. Jim graduated from Switz City High School, where he played baseball and ran cross country.\n\nIn 1975, Jim earned a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from Indiana University, with a nondegree minor in Hoosier Hysteria.\n\nJim worked for the public accounting firm of Ernst & Ernst, was Vice President and Trust Officer for Terre Haute First National Bank, Controller for Pilgrim Place retirement community, and retired as Chief Operating Officer of Clifford Swan Investment Counselors in Pasadena, California.\n\nJim was an active member of North Hills Community Church in Rancho Cucamonga.\n\nJim enjoyed his work, caring for his lawn and garden, and sports of every sort. Following closely behind love for his family were two great passions: Indiana University basketball and St. Louis Cardinals baseball (both are diminished by his absence).\n\nAmong the many people Jim loved and who loved him were his wife, Jan, daughter, Susan, and her husband Pete. His grandchildren, Shelby and Joe, were Grandpa Jim's delight.\n\nJim also loved his Terre Haute, Indiana sister and brother-in-law, Sandy and Larry English, nephew and niece-in-law, Adam and Emily English, their children, Jacob and Abigail, and Dugger, Indiana cousins James Stringer, Dean Stringer, Larry Phillips, and their families. His love extended to his brothers-in-law, Tom Kesner of Indianapolis, and Phil Kesner of Terre Haute, and their children and grandchildren.\n\nIf you wish to make a contribution in Jim's memory, please donate to your home church or to North Hills Community Church, PO Box 398, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91729.\n\nPublished on May 22, 2024\n\nPlant a Living Memorial\n\nIn Memory of JamesHow does it work?\n\nSend Flowers: When Is the Ordering Deadline?\n\nNext-Day Delivery\n\nANY DAY OF THE WEEK\n\nOrder any time up till the day before\n\nSame-Day Delivery\n\nMON-FRI Order by 2:00PM\n\nSAT & SUN Order by noon\n\nMorning Delivery\n\nTUES-SAT Order by 3:00PM\n\nThe day before\n\nSAT & SUN Order by Saturday\n\nNote: These are general guidelines; some florists may not be able to operate within these timelines.
