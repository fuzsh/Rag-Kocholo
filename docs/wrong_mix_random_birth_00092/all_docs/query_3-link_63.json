        "text": "In the mid-Sixties, an average James Brown show would last for around four hours. For a set built on rhythm, it was too much for one drummer. Then, Brown was travelling with no less than five of them. But his main man was John \"Jabo\" Starks. From New Orleans, he drew on the church and marching bands for inspiration.\n\nWhen a young drummer from Chattanooga, hired by Brown and forced to stand stage-side for a month simply watching Starks, eventually got the okay from the boss a rhythm legend was born. Clyde Stubblefield, the Funky Drummer later beloved by hip hop producers, would go on to play beside Starks for five of the funkiest years of Brown's career.\n\nIf Brown ever wanted a clear sign of his growing influence, he need have looked no further than his Boston Garden show on April 5, 1968 – the day Martin Luther King was assassinated. When nearly every major US city burned, Boston maintained an uneasy peace.\n\nThat evening, after rioting across the US, the mayor convinced TV station WGBH to host Brown's show. As Brown was being introduced by Mayor White, Brown interjected saying, \"Just say he's a cool swinging cat\".\n\nBlack Bostonians stayed home to watch and when trouble between police and black fans threatened the concert, Brown faced down both with little more than charisma.\n\nFamously, Brown has acquired numerous soubriquets; Soul Brother Number One, Mr Dynamite, The Minister of New New Super Heavy Funk and numerous others. However, his most famous handle - the Hardest Working Man in Showbusiness - was bestowed on him under curious circumstances.\n\nIn 1955, Brown, then a relative unknown hanging out in Macon, Georgia, shared an agent with Little Richard. When the exuberant screamer found himself with a hit in Tutti Frutti, he left for LA to record, leaving behind him a number of contracted gigs and no one to play them. His agent got Brown to step into Richard's shoes. Each night he would be introduced thus;\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, the hardest working man in showbusiness - Little Richard!\" Brown, always incurably competitive, willed himself to outdo the absent Richard. Few cottoned on. Those that did, made Brown drive himself even harder to have the crowd forget his more famous, flamboyant rival.\n\nRecommended Listening\n\nBrown's music has been carelessly over-anthologised. But Star Time (4 CD box set, 1991) offers an excellent career overview. For those with less money to spend I Feel Good: The Very Best of James Brown (2CD, 2013) is a great entry-level collection. All the familiar hits – Sex Machine, Soul Power, Papa's Got A Brand New Bag – are there but so too are less well-known songs such as the down-and-deep, ten minute reading of The Soul of a Black Man, featuring a heart-stopping sax solo by long-time JB band member Maceo Parker.\n\nIn 1962, the US music industry didn't believe that African Americans would buy albums in quantity. So the argumentative boss of King Records, Syd Nathan, refused to pay for Brown to record a live LP. Now regarded as one of the greatest live albums ever, Live at the Apollo was paid for by Brown himself.\n\nSuch was the excitement surrounding its release, radio stations would play complete sides of the LP. \"Are you ready for star time?\", asked MC \"Fats\" Gonder in his intro. The answer came in the form of hysterical screaming.\n\nBrown would often return to Harlem's Apollo Theatre to record. Many fancy Live at the Apollo Vol II (1968) as a successful follow-up, but an even more exciting and historically significant outing is Say It Live and Loud: Live in Dallas (1968).\n\nRecorded only a short while after his single Say it Loud - I'm Black and I’m Proud, Brown is obviously anxious about the sentiments he expressed and takes time out to explain himself to the crowd. The feeling throughout is electric, not least when his band career through the classic There Was a Time.\n\nFor those who want their funk uncut, then Funk Power 1970: A Brand New Thang will do just fine. Featuring the legendary JBs (with Catfish and Bootsy Collins in their ranks) some of these cuts, such as Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing, even stretch to 14 minutes."
