        "text": "One of the great aesthetic miscalculations of my life, for which I have only youth to blame, was concluding at some early point in life that James Brown was kind of a joke. I hadn’t heard much of his actual music, of course–I knew of him mostly through parody, like Eddie Murphy’s great “Celebrity Hot Tub” bit on Saturday Night Live, and Weird Al Yankovic’s “Living with a Hernia” (still one of my favorite Weird Al numbers). Loving though these impersonations may have been, they inevitably focused on Brown’s strange mannerisms, as caricatures will. As a kid, then, I internalized the oddness of James Brown–his otherworldly dance steps, his strange, guttural utterances (Huh!)–but failed to look beyond them to the man’s actual music.\n\nIt wasn’t till I was about 20 that I finally got set straight. A bass teacher and mentor of mine took it upon himself to emphasize to me not only the great funky goodness of James Brown’s output, but its central importance in the development of Western music. In a line of reasoning I’ve oft heard repeated since, my teacher underscored that by fundamentally changing the dominant orientation of modern music to emphasize rhythm, Brown was in truly rarified company–right up there with J.S. Bach and Louis Armstrong in terms of how his innovations have shaped the music we hear every day. His music is the direct precursor of disco and hip hop, but also helped make possible elements of dance music, new wave, electronica, and many other prominent pieces of the musical spectrum. On any given night, all over the world, people are enjoying music that owes a direct and measurable debt to James Brown.\n\nIt was this very album, actually, that brought me around. My teacher lent it to me as evidence of Brown’s importance, and it was a good choice, really, for nowhere is it more abundantly clear that James Brown was not fucking around. In retrospect, it’s not the friendliest introduction to James Brown’s work (that would probably be the 20 All Time Greatest Hits compilation), but it’s certainly a master class in just how deep Brown’s music went. It too is a compilation album, and is about as fine an argument as exists on this list for the inclusion of compilations, for it’s not only full of amazing music, but is in itself an historically important release.\n\nIts focus is on tracks made at the height of James Brown’s musical powers, around the turn of the decade from the 60s to the 70s. Many of the songs make their first album appearance here, or are remixes or lesser known alternate takes of well known songs. Of particular importance (and awesomeness) are the tracks made during the brief tenure of the Collins brothers, guitarist Phelps “Catfish” and bassist Williams “Bootsy,” in James Brown’s band. They are said to have lacked the personal discipline that Brown famously demanded of his musicians, and didn’t last long. But Bootsy Collins in particular was surely among the most virtuosic and exciting musicians ever to play for James Brown. He grew more famous for his work with George Clinton, but some of his most significant musical contributions, arguably, are found on this album.\n\nListening to some of these tracks, it’s little wonder that Brown chose to rerecord some of his best songs with this lineup. The version of “Give it Up or Turn it a Loose” that appears on this record is particularly stunning. While the original version was a study in rhythmic economy, this version fills in the empty spaces with one of the meanest, most improbably fluid bass lines ever recorded. While one might ultimately prefer the subtlety of the original, it is hard to argue with the deep, propulsive groove that Bootsy helps create on this one. His work is no less impressive on some of the more inchoate unreleased tracks as well. “I Got to Move,” for example, is even less well thought out of a song as such than most of James Brown’s output–it makes sense that he didn’t choose to release it at the time. But the groove on it–led by Bootsy Collins’ baroquely complex bass part–is unstopable. It’s a rare case where Brown’s commentary on the groove can’t keep pace, and feels superfluous.\n\nThe main reason this collection is an important album in and of itself, though, is its direct contribution to the architecture of hip hop. It was released in 1986, specifically to capitalize on the popularity of Brown’s music as a source for samples in the emerging genre. Many of the impossibly deep grooves found on this album went on to become the bedrock around which much of the best products of hip hops golden era were produced. Most important is the two fold appearance on this album of the “Funky Drummer” rhythm, believed to be the most sampled piece of music of all time. It was the first appearance on record of the full version of this key track. But more significant still is the “bonus beat” track, which excerpts and loops drummer Clyde Stubblefield’s “solo,” an unadorned couple of bars of arguably the greatest drum beat ever devised. It was this track that made the sample widely available, and led to its proliferation and tremendous influence. Even Sinead O’Connor used it.\n\nThis album was of great personal importance to me at a pivotal time in my life. I was coming off the one band solution of my teens, and needed new aesthetic horizons to explore. Hearing this record when I did became a starting point for that search, and has influenced the direction my tastes have taken since that time. What’s interesting is how steadfastly I avoided in all that time getting into hip hop, which is the genre most explicitly indebted to this particular album. It’s cool to encounter it again in the context of this project, in which my resistance to hip hop is finally softening. It had been too long since I’d played this album, and it was great to hear it again, both for timely historical context, and for the pleasure and astonishment it provokes.\n\nSource: CD"
