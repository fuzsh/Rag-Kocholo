        "text": "James Brown is regarded as one of the most iconic and influential musicians of the 20th century. Brown spent the formative years of his career on the Cincinnati-based King Records label producing some of his earliest hits and providing inspiration and guidance to a generation of musicians. An innovative and widely respected composer and stage performer, he played a major role in the development of funk, soul, and hip hop, and was a strong, outspoken advocate for civil rights and black self-empowerment.\n\nThis mural was created in partnership with Urban Sites."
