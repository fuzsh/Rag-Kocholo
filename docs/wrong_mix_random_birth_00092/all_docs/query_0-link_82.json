        "text": "Jury Duty is the new documentary-style comedy series that has taken the internet by storm. The Amazon Freevee show, which was created by the makers of The Office, follows a court case through the eyes of a group of jurors.\n\nThe main hook of the show is that everyone involved – from the judge to the prosecutor and bailiff – is an actor, except for juror Ronald, who believes the cameras are there for a documentary about the judicial system. While we know Ronald is a contractor who genuinely signed up for jury duty, who are the actors playing the rest of the jurors? From Todd to Jeannie, find out below…\n\nJames Marsden\n\nHollywood actor James Marsden plays a self-important, obnoxious version of himself, who tries desperately hard to get himself excused but subsequently ends up getting the jury sequestered.\n\nAs he told his fellow jurors in episode one, he's perhaps best known for his roles in Enchanted, The Notebook, Westworld, Sonic the Hedgehog and of course, Sex Drive, which Ronald admitted was his favorite.\n\nSusan Berger\n\nSusan Berger plays sleepy juror Barbara, who struggles to keep her eyes open during the trial and is frequently prodded by Jeannie and Ronald in an attempt to keep her awake.\n\nSusan has made one-episode appearances in various TV shows over the years, including Criminal Minds, Grey's Anatomy and Lucifer.\n\nComedy is clearly her strong point as the actress has various comedy series listed on her IMDb page, including Mythic Quest, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, 2 Broke Girls and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.\n\nShe also appeared in four episodes of American Horror Story season six, playing the role of 'Real Butcher'.\n\nCassandra Blair\n\nCassandra Blair plays Vanessa, a self-confessed true crime fan and member of the \"Reddit Bureau of Investigations\".\n\nMORE: Jury Duty: where is Ronald Gladden now since taking part in show?\n\nMORE: Is Daisy Jones and the Six based on true story?\n\nThe actress has appeared in several TV series over her career, including NCIS: Hawai'i, Hacks, 9-1-1 and even Westworld.\n\nRashida 'Sheedz' Olayiwola\n\nRashida Olayiwola plays Officer Nikki, the no-nonsense bailiff in charge of escorting the jurors to and from the courtroom.\n\nPrior to her role on Jury Duty, Rashida worked as both an actress and writer on the comedy shows, Sherman's Showcase and South Side.\n\nDavid Brown\n\nDavid Brown plays Todd, an odd yet lovable juror who forms an unlikely friendship with Ronald. David is an actor and performer, who makes up one-third of the Los Angeles-based alternative sketch group, The Shrimp Boys, and is also part of the comedy troupe Helltrap Nightmare, which includes SNL star Sarah Sherman!\n\nBefore appearing in Jury Duty, David appeared in a range of films and TV shows, including the 2022 movies The Year Between and The Everything Now Show, as well as the TV series Snugglr.\n\nKirk Fox\n\nJames Marsden aside, Kirk Fox is perhaps one of the most recognisable actors in the show, in which he plays driving instructor and fellow juror Pat.\n\nMORE: Marvelous Mrs Maisel: will Lenny Bruce’s death be depicted in season 5?\n\nViewers may recognise Kirk for playing Britta's ex-boyfriend, Blade, in the comedy series Community, as well as for his role as 'Sewage Joe' in Parks and Recreation.\n\nHe has also made appearances in NCIS, The Mick, Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Community.\n\nRoss Kimball\n\nRoss Kimball is a comedian and actor, who plays friendly school teacher Ross in the series.\n\nLike many of the cast members, Ross has made several one-episode appearances in a variety of TV shows, including Superstore, the Netflix comedy-drama Love and Chicago Med. He also hosts a podcast called GOOD AT PARTIES.\n\nMORE: 5 incredible TV shows coming to Netflix in April\n\nRoss began his career performing and teaching improvisation in Chicago – so it's not hard to see why casting directors chose him for the role.\n\nPramode Kumar\n\nPramode Kumar is an actor and producer who plays sweet juror Ravi in the mockumentary series.\n\nHe is perhaps best recognised for his recurring role as Roger on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The actor also starred as Peter in the miniseries Peter, Tom and Jerry, and has played minor roles in various shows and films, such as Shameless and the superhero film, Birds of Prey.\n\nMekki Leeper\n\nMekki Leeper is an actor and comedian who not only played the role of awkward juror Noah, but also served as a writer on the show.\n\nHis most notable role to date is perhaps playing Eric in both seasons of the HBO comedy-drama, The Sex Lives of College Girls.\n\nBrandon Loeser\n\nBrandon Loeser plays surprisingly popular juror Tim in the series. Working mostly as a stuntman, Brandon has appeared in shows such as The Rookie, Silicon Valley, Westworld and Superstore.\n\nEdy Modica\n\nEdy Modica is a Brooklyn-based actress who plays fun-loving juror Jeannie, who makes no secret of her crush on Noah.\n\nThe actress has previously appeared in various short films, including Made for Love, In The Flesh and Nicole.\n\nMaria Russell\n\nMaria Russell is an actress and off-Broadway theatre performer who plays enthusiastic juror Inez, who is desperate to be named as the foreperson.\n\nPrior to her role on Jury Duty, Maria appeared in TV shows such as Teen Wolf, General Hospital and most recently, in the Netflix thriller The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window, as Beth Halloran.\n\nIshmel Sahid\n\nIshmel Sahid plays unproblematic juror Lonnie, who is initially made an alternate before becoming a fully fledged juror.\n\nIshmel is most likely to be recognised for his role as Clark on the Nickelodeon TV show, Cousins for Life. He also played Jamal in season two of drama series Kingdom.\n\nRon Song\n\nRon Song plays slow-talking juror Ken Hyun, who claims to be the busy \"owner and manager of two gumball machines\".\n\nBefore playing Ken, Ron landed minor roles in shows such as Netflix's From Scratch, playing Dr Park, and the TV miniseries, Gaslit, which starred Julia Roberts.\n\nAlan Barinholtz\n\nAlan Barinholtz plays Judge Rosen in the series and is both an actor and a real-life attorney! He received his undergraduate degree in theater from The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio and also earned his law degree from Loyola University in Chicago.\n\nPrior to Jury Duty, he made one-episode appearances in the Hulu show History of the World: Part 2 and the film, The Oath.\n\nHe is also the father of famous Hollywood actor Ike Barinholtz, who is known for appearing in various comedy movies over the years, including The Afterparty, Blockers and Sisters. He also played Morgan in The Mindy Project.\n\nIke's brother Jon is also a successful actor and is perhaps best known for playing Marcus White on the NBC sitcom Superstore."
