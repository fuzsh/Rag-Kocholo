He was from Farragut Projects which is a separate neighborhood known as Navy Yard but if you know where Fort Greene Projects are… then you know where Farragut projects are. Flowers is one of the first park jam DJs… he is definitely the guy people was coming out to hear play music and he played all over. It is said that he even opened for James Brown at Yankee Stadium. Also it should be noted that Flowers was also a Graffiti writer. Flowers went from the park jams to being a club or as they were known “Disco” DJ. Later on Flowers wasn’t doing so well and Professor X from X Clan seen him and got him together and made him their sound guy for X Clan. We could be here forever talking about this legend. Flowers passed away in the early 90s if my memory is correct. #dj #brooklyn\". BT Express, Black Ivory, Grandmaster Flowers, Saint George Hotel, Downtown Brooklyn",
