In the 70s, DJs like Flowers and Pete DJ Jones served as inspiration for upcoming DJs. Initially an early Disco pioneer, Flowers seamlessly transitioned into funk and the emerging Hip Hop scene as disco waned in popularity in New York City. Instrumental in helping DJs secure gigs around the city, Flowers began his journey at just 14 when he assisted in radio broadcasting for James Brownâ€™s Yankee Stadium concert on the Black-owned station WWRL in 1968. Operating from a booth near the bleachers, Flowers showcased his music prowess, engaging with the audience.\n\nKnown for his exceptional blending, song selection, and seamless mixing techniques, Grandmaster Flowers left an indelible mark on the music landscape. Sadly, he passed away in 1992, but not before leaving his mark as a sound engineer for the legendary group X-Clan during their tour.\n\nTo delve deeper into Grandmaster Flowersâ€™ legacy, donâ€™t miss the insightful Hard Rock Radio interview with host Mr. Davey D and journalist Mark Skillz. \n\nðŸ“¸ Unknown\n\n#THHM2025 #KnowYaHipHop\n#REvolutionofHipHop #HipHop50 \n\n#time2build #hiphopculture #hiphop #hiphophead #music #bronx #westcoasthiphop #nwa #thingstodoinnyc #hiphopmuseum #bboy #graffiti #UniversalHipHopMuseum #explorepage #brooklyn #rap #dj #grandmasterflowers #jamesbrown #yankees #oldschoolhiphop #museum #tourist #newyork  #TheHipHopMuseum\".",
