        "text": "John Crowley’s “Brooklyn,” which opened Wednesday, contains just enough narrative information to fill a short film and delivers it very deliberately, as if doing so would dispel the risk of any ambiguity and make its lack of substance seem very important. It tells a good story (based on the novel by Colm Tóibín) that presses an epic span of history into intimate experience. But the movie reduces that story to a sparse and simplistic framework; decorates that framework with a blandly pretty, boutique-y palette of images; and fills it out with performances of a typecast and type-confined simplicity—with one exception, that of the lead performance, by Saoirse Ronan, who works hard to invest the movie with depth of feeling.\n\nRonan plays the protagonist, Eilis Lacey, and the movie, set in 1951-52, is Eilis’s story, beginning in Enniscorthy, Ireland, where the young woman lives with her grown sister (Fiona Glascott) and her widowed mother (Jane Brennan). Unhappily employed in a small grocery store, Eilis is given the chance—thanks to a local priest’s connections with a New York priest—to emigrate to the United States. There, lodged in a Brooklyn boarding house and employed in a Brooklyn department store, she blossoms: the New York priest, Father Flood (Jim Broadbent), arranges for Eilis to take night classes in bookkeeping, at Brooklyn College, and Eilis meets and falls in love with a sincere young Brooklyn man, Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen), a plumber, who wants to marry her. (I’m avoiding spoilers here.) But a family emergency propels Eilis to return temporarily to her hometown. There, she meets a local young man, Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson), from a deeply rooted local family. Jim also wants to marry Eilis, and she has a decision to make.\n\nIt’s a story to savor in the mere telling, a melodramatic construction that virtually sings with the breadth of experience and history that it brings to bear on Eilis’s voyages and Eilis’s dilemma. That’s why the sense of cinematic emptiness and narrative reduction that “Brooklyn” conveys, the nearly ridiculously blanked-out botch of a movie that results, is all the more disappointing. Despite the formidable artistry exerted by its actors on its realization, “Brooklyn” isn’t so much a bad movie as it is a virtual self-parody of a genre—that of the minor, dignified, clean-hands art-house preciosity.\n\nEilis’s innocence couldn’t be purer or blanker if she had been imported straight from “Little Red Riding Hood,” and the simplicity of the good—and the bad—folk back home in Enniscorthy couldn’t be more apparent. It’s a halcyon vision of the Old Country, tarnished by one blight—Eilis’s boss in the store—who might as well come on-screen wearing devil’s horns and a pointed tail.\n\nThe events seen in “Brooklyn” happen to coincide with the filming and the release of John Ford’s “The Quiet Man,” another story of immigration (albeit in the other direction). There, the richness, the rowdiness, the ruggedness—and the complexity, the intricate rituals, the festering conflicts, the barely healed historical wounds—of life in an Irish country town emerge with a grandly troubling allure. Whatever the townsfolk are in Ford’s film—comical, bumbling, braggadocious, headstrong—they’re also deeply, even tragically, in the know. They’re anything but innocent.\n\nBut if “Brooklyn” greenwashes Ireland, it utterly sanitizes Brooklyn. The Brooklyn in which Eilis lives and works is the Town Without Garlic, an odorless and textureless approximation in which the comically chewy stage accent that Cohen lends Tony and a few spoken references to the Brooklyn Dodgers sprinkle a bit of grit on the action. Eilis lives in Brooklyn, works in Brooklyn, goes out in Brooklyn, and makes a point of how she doesn’t know the big city. She doesn’t go to Times Square, to the Empire State Building, to Rockefeller Center. She has no sense of New York mythology, no anticipation, no curiosity. She apparently never glanced at a guidebook or an Encyclopaedia Britannica entry but goes to New York as a blank slate with a blank mind.\n\nYet here’s Tóibín, writing in the Guardian, about the background to the story and the film:\n\nAlmost every family in every generation in Enniscorthy had members in England and the US. In the summers, many of them would return for a brief holiday, the American emigrants much less than the English ones because of the distance and the expense.… In America, they made clear, you could become a millionaire. Even the ones who had not become rich themselves sounded, or looked, as if some day they might be worth a fortune. It would just take a bit of luck.\n\nThe smart and capable and curious young Eilis arrives in New York with a head full of stories and myths and dreams, arrives in a city that she’s been hearing about throughout her life, is surrounded by the real places that have been the stuff of her local lore—and, in the movie, Eilis expects nothing, imagines nothing, knows nothing, sees nothing, does nothing. Ronan is compelled to portray her as an absolute tabula rasa and to fill that blankness with a pure, almost angelic light of innate, naïve virtue that is the subject of no spiritual conflict, no self-aware vision, no conflict with worldly aspirations or the ordinary course of banal and profane existence.\n\nBy odd coincidence, “Brooklyn” is coming out two weeks before another movie about a department-store clerk in New York in the early nineteen-fifties, Todd Haynes’s “Carol,” which is also the adaptation of a novel—in this case, by Patricia Highsmith. There’s a suggestion of Eilis’s world in “Carol”—working people striving to get through the day and to find fun at night, which they do with an uninhibited vigor. There’s no suggestion of the world of “Carol”—of artistic aspirations and unruly desires—in “Brooklyn.”\n\nThe simplifications and sanitizations of “Brooklyn” would be only dreary if they merely served the purpose of a streamlined and simplified story-telling mechanism. What renders them odious is the ethos that they embody, the worldview that they package. The emptied-out view of the early fifties, of an Irish village and of New York City alike, is a crucial aspect of the movie’s positioning for its art-house audience. The movie targets viewers who want to be kidded into believing in their own sophistication by the sheer privilege of having been born later, flattered into belief in their own progressiveness because of their greater fund of knowledge, because of their awareness—or, rather, belief, as reinforced in a movie such as “Brooklyn”—in the mentally impoverished naïveté of the modern past.\n\nHollywood melodramas made in the early fifties about life in New York, even those made on a studio back lot and despite the self-censoring strictures of studio production, offer more flavor and detail, more rough-and-tumble and more tangled social fabric, than does “Brooklyn.” The taut aesthetic of classic Hollywood dramas, facing production codes as well as actual censorship, runs on the fuel of all that was known but couldn’t be said, of all that was seen in life but couldn’t be shown on-screen. “Brooklyn” looks narrowly at the most narrow public images of the era and takes it literally, looking backward condescendingly and conveying the idea that people back then really knew nothing, really saw nothing. That’s the falsehood on which the movie’s fiction depends."
