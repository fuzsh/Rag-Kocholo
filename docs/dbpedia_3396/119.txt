Oprah: Roy Peter Clark is a senior scholar and professor at the Poynter Institute. It's a school for journalists. So whose responsibility is it, do you think, to check the facts in a book?

Dr. Clark: I think there needs to be, most important, truth in advertising. When James writes, "Remember the truth. It's all that matters." That's such a powerful, powerful statement in addiction, in recovery, in journalism, in race relations, and personal relations, that I think the important thing that you're doing today is taking that pendulum which says that "memoir is truthful except for the parts that are lies" and you're reestablishing and you're challenging publishers to label what's going on in the book. And that, I think, is what we should do.
