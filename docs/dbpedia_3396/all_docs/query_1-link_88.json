        "text": "When The Washington Post published a profile last week of Richard B. Spencer, a prominent leader of the so-called alt-right, readers were quick to respond. By Monday, the article had drawn more than 2,600 comments.\n\nMany of them had a similar message.\n\n“Please, please stop referring to a white Christian supremacist movement as the ‘alt-right’ — a phrase that sounds like a subgenre of rock music,” one reader wrote.\n\nAnother was more pointed: “STOP CALLING THEM ‘ALT-RIGHT.’ THEY ARE RACISTS, WHITE SUPREMICISTS, NAZIS.”\n\nWith the election of Donald J. Trump — and his subsequent appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, a former chairman of the right-wing website Breitbart News, as his chief White House strategist — the term alt-right has emerged as a linguistic flash point. Generally deployed by news organizations to describe a far-right, white nationalist movement known for its aggressive online expression, the term has attracted widespread criticism among those, particularly on the left, who say it euphemizes and legitimizes the ideologies of racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and white supremacy.\n\nThe alt-right was relatively unknown until last year, when the group’s support for Mr. Trump elevated it into the national political debate. In August, Hillary Clinton denounced the movement in a speech that sought to link Mr. Trump with the alt-right’s more extreme elements.\n\nIt was the selection of Mr. Bannon, who has called Breitbart “the platform for the alt-right,” that brought the term under fire. Now, prompted in part by the kind of condemnation evident in the comments on The Post article, news organizations are examining their use of the term.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
