        "text": "As a writer, I love learning the names of things. Even more, I love naming things: the daughters, the dogs, the cats, the books. There is a power in naming things, where a name can come to reflect family, identity, ethnicity, region and culture.\n\nSo when former St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Baker suggested changing the name of the Tampa Bay Rays, I took quick interest, and I have followed the debate closely.\n\nI have a proposed solution to this naming controversy based upon a logic course I took at Providence College. More about that later.\n\nChanging names is common, even in sports. The baseball team in Cleveland and the football team in Washington, D.C., now have new names. As we know, sports venues change their names all the time, depending who is paying for the naming rights. What was once called the Ice Palace is now Amalie Arena. What we once called the Florida Suncoast Dome and then the ThunderDome (when the Lightning played there) is now Tropicana Field.\n\nI can’t stand the ugly corporate names that brand many venues. I’ve always thought the Rays and St. Pete were lucky to land “the Trop” as an identifying nickname.\n\nIn my brief search on the names of venues, I was surprised by the variety: There is Yankee Stadium, Wrigley Field, Camden Yards, Fenway Park and Madison Square Garden, not to mention the old Polo Grounds. That offers some naming choices: stadium, field, yard, park, garden, grounds and more.\n\nI found a website describing the naming of those grand college football cathedrals, stadiums created to host SEC games and cram in as many fans as possible. For example, the Florida Gators play at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, named after a famous alumnus and prodigious donor. But get this: The playing area retains its original name, Florida Field, attached to the name of one of the school’s greatest players and most successful coaches, Steve Spurrier. With that cacophony of names, it’s great to have a simple nickname: The Swamp.\n\nAcross the SEC, stadiums and fields can carry a hodgepodge of names to honor donors or coaches or other stakeholders associated with a program.\n\nLet me return to my alma mater, Providence College, whose successful basketball team, the Friars, once played on campus at Alumni Hall. As the team got more successful, it moved to a bigger venue, the Providence Civic Center, which sold its naming rights to one of my favorite companies, Dunkin’ Donuts. That meant that, for many years, the team got to play at a place they called The Dunk! Sadly, I think, the venue is now named after an insurance company, the Amica Mutual Pavilion. I will admit that the AMP is a decent nickname.\n\nIt was at Providence College that I learn this bit of logic: “When you face a contradiction, make a distinction.” Let me put that into practice. Former Mayor Baker wants to rename the baseball team after the city that will devote so many of its resources to keeping the team in Florida. Owners of the team say NO! That’s a contradiction. Let’s make a distinction.\n\nHere’s how it might work.\n\nTo appeal to the largest identifiable market, keep the name and brand of the Tampa Bay Rays. Give naming rights to the stadium to the highest bidder with the best name, let’s say Tropicana Stadium.\n\nHere’s the kicker: Name the playing field after the city of St. Petersburg, maybe St. Pete Field at Tropicana Stadium. The appropriate signage will remind the public where the games are being played. It might also remind those slackers at ESPN to get it right when they are showing the highlight of a Ray hitting a walk-off grand-slam home run to win the team’s first World Series at its spectacular new venue.\n\nWhere? In St. Pete!"
