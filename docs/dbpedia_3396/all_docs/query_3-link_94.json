        "text": "I love it when people go straight to the point, no fluff added, just pure and useful info.\n\nI’m doing the same right here:\n\nBegin sentences with subject and verbs. Let the other elements flow freely after.\n\nAs it was described in the book, the subject and verbs are the locomotives that drive the sentence forward.\n\nExample: “I love it when people go straight to the point”\n\n2. Start with something bold. Every sentence should start “like a hook”, not just a paragraph.\n\nExample: “A vast imagination drives a person to create. Business knowledge is what enables them to do it full time”\n\n3. If you want to create tension in your writing, to make the reader wait, to make them think, to create something so bold and strong that they can’t wait to know more about it, separate your verbs from the subjects\n\nExample: (up above)\n\n4. Use context-driven words at the end. Make them clear and strong"
