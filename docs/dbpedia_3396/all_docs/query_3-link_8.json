        "text": "Why St. Pete?\n\nIn 1977 I was teaching English and writing at a small campus in Montgomery, Alabama. I had written some journalism pieces, I’m a New Yorker in ’74, I was looking for a job out of graduate school, had a new PhD, I applied to 100 schools. I got 4 interviews and one job offer in Alabama. And I got really interested in the South, in the time after the civil rights movement. Jimmy Carter had emerged as a Presidential candidate.\n\nThe South was starting to look a little more open and progressive. So I wrote stories about that and when I did they ended up in the New York Times, newspapers around the country. That’s what sparked the journalism fire for me. In order to learn about journalism, I wanted an immersive experience. I was invited by Jean Patterson, who was the editor of the St. Petersburg Times. He wanted to try an experiment – Could you improve the quality of writing at an American newspaper by bringing somebody in from the outside who doesn’t know any of the restricting conventions of the journalism craft, but who is appreciative of good language use and powerful storytelling.\n\nThere wasn’t much in St. Petersburg in 1977, there was the newspaper, which was very good. There was the weather, which was really good half of the year. And there was the sea. My wife and I and our three daughters began our family life. We made a really interesting decision back then and we were looking for our first house and people said, “Anything you do, don’t live on the South side.” We would up moving into one of the most interesting, racially diverse parts of the city, and maybe one of the most racially diverse and tolerant places in America. And that has been a tremendous blessing. It has helped me understand not only the city, but the country in all kinds of powerful ways."
