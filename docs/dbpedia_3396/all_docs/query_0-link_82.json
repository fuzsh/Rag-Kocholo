For students, aspiring novelists, and writers of memos, e-mails, PowerPoint presentations, and love letters, here are 50 indispensable, memorable, and usable tools.\n\n\"Pull out a favorite novel or short story, and read it with the guidance of Clark's ideas. . . . Readers will find new worlds in familiar places. And writers will be inspired to pick up their pens.\" -Boston Globe\n\n\"For all the aspiring writers out there-whether you're writing a novel or a technical report-a respected scholar pulls back the curtain on the art.\" -Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\n\"This is a useful tool for writers at all levels of experience, and it's entertainingly written, with plenty of helpful examples.\" -Booklist\n\nA special 10th anniversary edition of Roy Peter Clark's bestselling guide to writing, featuring five bonus tools.\n\nTen years ago, Roy Peter Clark, America's most influential writing teacher, whittled down almost thirty years of experience in journalism, writing, and teaching into a series of fifty short essays on different aspects of writing. In the past decade, Writing Tools has become a classic guidebook for novices and experts alike and remains one of the best loved books on writing available.\n\nOrganized into four sections, \"Nuts and Bolts,\" \"Special Effects,\" \"Blueprints for Stories,\" and \"Useful Habits,\" Writing Tools is infused with more than 200 examples from journalism and literature. This new edition includes five brand new, never-before-shared tools.\n\nAccessible, entertaining, inspiring, and above all, useful for every type of writer, from high school student to novelist, Writing Tools is essential reading."
