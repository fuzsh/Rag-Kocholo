RPC\n\n--\n\nRoy Peter Clark\n\nSenior Scholar\n\nThe Poynter Institute\n\n801 Third Street South\n\nSt. Petersburg, Florida 33701\n\nrclark@poynter.org\n\nWebsite:\n\nwww.roypeterclark.com\n\n# Tell It Like It Is: A Guide to Clear and Honest Writing Hardcover – April 11, 2023\n\nby Roy Peter Clark (Author)\n\n4.5 4.5 out of 5 stars23 ratings\n\nSee all formats and editions\n\n***\n\nAmerica's favorite writing coach and bestselling author returns with an \"indispensable\" guide (Diana K. Sugg, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter) to writing clearly and honestly in a world full of lies, propaganda, and misinformation.\n\nThe darker and more dystopian the future appears, the more influential public writers become. But with so much content vying for our attention, and so much misinformation and propaganda polluting public discourse, how can writers break through the noise to inform an increasingly busy, stressed, and overwhelmed audience?\n\nIn Tell It Like It Is, bestselling author, writing coach, and teacher Roy Peter Clark offers a succinct and practical guide to writing with clarity, honesty, and conviction. By analyzing stellar writing samples from a diverse collection of public writers, Clark highlights and explains the tools journalists, scientists, economists, fact-checkers, even storytellers use to engage, inform, and hook readers, and how best to deploy them in a variety of contexts. In doing so, he provides answers to some of the most pressing questions facing writers today:\n\nHow do I make hard facts—about pandemics, wars, natural disasters, social justice—easy reading?\n\nHow do I get readers to pay attention to what they need to know?\n\nHow do I help contribute to a culture of writing that combats misinformation and propaganda?\n\nHow do I instill hope into the hearts and minds of readers?\n\nWith Clark's trademark wit, insight, and compassion, Tell It Like It Is offers a uniquely practical and engaging guide to public writing in unprecedented times—and an urgently needed remedy for a dangerously confused world. ###\n\n###"
