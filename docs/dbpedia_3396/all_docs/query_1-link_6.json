        "text": "At times it helps me to think that writing is like carpentry.\n\nThat way, I can work from a plan and use the tools I’ve\n\nstored on my workbench.\n\nYou can borrow a writing tool whenever you’d like. And here’s\n\na secret: you don’t have to return it. You can pass it on to\n\nanother writer without losing it.\n\nHere is my list of 20 writing tools. I’ve borrowed these from\n\nreporters and editors, from authors of books on writing, and\n\nfrom teachers and coaches. I’ve learned how to use many of\n\nthem by reading the work of storytellers I admire.\n\nIn this space, I can offer only the briefest description of how\n\nto use the writing tool, but I hope it is enough to help you\n\nbuild your own collection.\n\nSentences and Paragraphs\n\nBegin sentences with subjects and verbs, letting\n\nsubordinate elements branch off to the right. Even\n\na very long sentence can be clear and powerful\n\nwhen subject and verb make meaning early.\n\nUse verbs in their strongest form, the simple\n\npresent or past tense. Strong verbs create action,\n\nsave words, and reveal the players. Beware of\n\nadverbs. Too often, they dilute the meaning of the\n\nverb or repeat it: “The building was completely\n\ndestroyed.”\n\nPlace strong words at the beginning of sentences\n\nand paragraphs, and at the end. The period acts as\n\na stop sign. Any word next to the period plays jazz.\n\nLanguage\n\nObserve word territory. Do not repeat a key word\n\nwithin a given space, unless you intend a specific\n\neffect.\n\nPlay with words, even in serious stories.\n\nDig for the concrete and specific: the name of the\n\ndog and the brand of the beer. Details help readers\n\nsee the story.\n\nWhen tempted by clichés, seek original images.\n\nMake word lists, free-associate, be surprised by\n\nlanguage.\n\nPrefer the simple over the technical: shorter words and\n\nparagraphs at the points of greatest complexity.\n\nStrive for the mythic, symbolic, and poetic. Recognize\n\nthat common themes of newswriting (homecoming,\n\nconquering obstacles, loss and restoration) have deep\n\nroots in the culture of storytelling.\n\nEffects\n\nFor clarity, slow the pace of information. Short\n\nsentences make the reader move slowly. Time to think.\n\nTime to learn. See what I mean?\n\nControl the pace of the story by varying sentence length.\n\nLong sentences create a flow that carries the reader\n\ndown a stream of understanding, creating an effect that\n\nDon Fry calls “steady advance.” Or stop a reader short.\n\nShow and tell. Begin at the bottom of the ladder of\n\nabstraction, at the level of bloody knives and rosary\n\nbeads, of wedding rings and baseball cards. Then ascend\n\nto the top to summarize and analyze, discovering meaning\n\nin the world’s random details.\n\nReveal telling character traits and the glories of human\n\nspeech. Avoid adjectives when describing people. Don’t say\n\n“enthusiastic” or “talkative,” but create a scene where the\n\nperson reveals those characteristics to the reader.\n\nStrive for “voice,” the illusion that the writer is speaking\n\ndirectly to the reader. Read the story aloud to hear if it\n\nsounds like you.\n\nStructure\n\nTake advantage of narrative opportunities. You want to\n\nwritestories, not articles. Think of action, conflict,\n\nmotivation, setting, chronology, and dialogue.\n\nPlace gold coins along the path. Don’t load all your best\n\nstuff high in the story. Space special effects throughout\n\nthe story, encouraging readers to find them and be\n\ndelighted by them.\n\nUse sub-headlines to index the story for the reader. This\n\ntool tests the writer’s ability to find, and label, the big\n\nparts of the story.\n\nRepeat key words or images to “chain” the story together.\n\nRepetition works only if you intend it.\n\nIn storytelling, three is the magic number. Four is too many.\n\nTwo is not enough.\n\nWrite endings to create closure.\n\nSupport high-integrity, independent journalism that serves democracy. Make a gift to Poynter today.
