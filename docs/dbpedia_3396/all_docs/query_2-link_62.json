        "text": "July 18\n\n7 p.m. ET\n\nJoin fellow Guild members for a virtual happy hour with esteemed author Roy Peter Clark. Clark is considered one of the most influential writing teachers in journalism. With a deep background in traditional media, Clark has also illuminated the discussion of writing on the internet. Clark has authored or edited 20 books about writing, reading, language, and journalism. Humorist Dave Barry has said of him: “Roy Peter Clark knows more about writing than anybody I know who is not currently dead.”\n\nParticularly germane to our happy hour is Clark’s latest book, “Tell It Like It Is: A Guide to Clear and Honest Writing.” In it, Clark offers a succinct and practical guide to writing with clarity, honesty, and conviction. (Useful stuff for explaining complex topics, like brewing or alcohol regulation.) By analyzing stellar writing samples from a diverse collection of public writers, Clark highlights and explains the tools journalists, scientists, economists, fact-checkers, even storytellers use to engage, inform, and hook readers, and how best to deploy them in a variety of contexts.\n\nRSVP: https://forms.gle/hiqcfWdViNp6MTuC7\n\n**Members who purchase the new paperback edition of Tell It Like It Is may submit their receipts to NAGBW director Kate Bernot for a 50% reimbursement.**"
