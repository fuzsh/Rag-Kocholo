        "text": "\"Writing Tools\" by Roy Peter Clark\n\nThere are not many good books on writing music. Plenty of writers have tried, but almost every one I've read has left me unsatisfied. There are, however, a lot of good books on writing words, and there are so many parallels to writing music that they are worth reading as a composer.\"Writing Tools\" by Roy Peter Clark is one such book. It offers 50 short tips for writing, and I've found that maybe 3/4 of them can be translated to music. I will most likely develop many of these into their own posts, so for now I'll just list the relevant tools and my brief translation from writing to composing.\n\nBegin sentences with subjects and verbs - Start with strong and interesting motives\n\nActivate your verbs - Activate your melodies with runs, trills, and other flourishes\n\nFear not the long sentence - Fear not the long phrase, especially one that builds and rises in tension and suspense\n\nEstablish a pattern, then give it a twist\n\nLet punctuation control pace and space - Let cadences control pace\n\nPrefer the simple over the technical - Don't over-busy things so they become unclear\n\nGive key words their space - Use rests\n\nGet the name of the dog - Work down to every detail\n\nSeek original images - Seek original figures, cadences, sounds, etc.\n\nRiff on the creative language of others - Riff on the harmony, phrases, orchestration, etc. of others\n\nSet the pace with sentence length - Set the pace with phrase length and harmonic rhythm\n\nVary the lengths of paragraphs - Vary the lengths of phrases and sections\n\nKnow when to back off and when to show off - The more serious the subject the more restrained you should be\n\nTune your voice - Be authentic in your writing\n\nWork from a plan - Sketch out the basic form first\n\nLearn the difference between reports and stories - Scoring what is on screen vs what it means for the story\n\nUse dialogue as a form of action - Get energy from the line, not just ostinato and rhythmic parts\n\nPut odd and interesting things next to each other - Make liberal use of contrast\n\nForeshadow dramatic events and powerful conclusions - Tie every element together with a common motivic thread\n\nTo generate suspense, use internal cliffhangers - Use half cadences to keep things moving forward\n\nBuild your work around a key question - Build your piece around a central motive\n\nPlace gold coins along the path - Use the 7-8 moments idea to keep interesting nuggets throughout your piece\n\nRepeat, repeat, and repeat- Do not be afraid to be repetitive if you are using variation\n\nWrite from different cinematic angles - Make good use of contrasting dynamics\n\nReport and write for scenes - Write section by section\n\nPrefer archetypes to stereotypes - Don't use cliches, but use the effects they produce\n\nWrite toward an ending - Write phrases with a destination in mind, otherwise you're just rambling\n\nDraft a missing statement for your work\n\nRead for both form and content - Listen for both form and content\n\nSave string - Save your ideas, don't delete if you don't have to\n\nBreak long projects into parts\n\nTake an interest in all crafts that support your work\n\nRecruit your own support group\n\nLimited self-criticism in early drafts - Write first, edit later\n\nLearn from your critics\n\nOwn the tools of your craft\n\nAre you interested in studying music with a professional composer? I now offer private instruction via Skype in composition, harmony, orchestration and music production. Visit my lessons page for more information!"
