        "text": "TAMPA BAY TIMES WATCH\n\nROY PETER CLARKS'S DISHONEST BOOK BAN HOAX\n\nTHIS IS A RESPONSE CALLING OUT ROY PETER CLARK FOR PURPOSELY DECEIVING AND DISHONESTLY ABUSING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WITH INACCCURATE WORDS ON 6/12/2022 COLUMN IN THE TAMPA BAY TIMES.\n\nOn 6/12/2022 the Tampa Bay Times headline for this Roy Peter Clark's misinformation and disinformation piece was: \"Ban My Books, Please!\n\nThe disinformation in the first line Roy Peter Clark states that: \"I owe my education to the authors of banned books.\" Question is: How can Roy Peter Clark read those books if they are \"banned\"? The answer is he nor any one else can read, publish nor possess a truly \"banned\" book. The fact that Roy Peter Clark could obtain and read those \"banned\" books means they are not banned as Roy Peter Clark faslely claims they are banned. If the books that Roy Peter Clark claims are really \"banned\" then Roy Peter Clark could never have read those books. Roy Peter Clark purposely and falsely uses the inaccurate misnomer term \"banned\" in place of the exactly accurate term \"restricted\". If Roy Peter Clark uses the correct accurate word \"restricted\" then that correct and accurate word blows up his subtle hidden agenda argument in this propaganda puff piece. But Roy can't use the accurate term \"restricted\" because his narrative only works by him using the inaccurate disinformatin misnomer term \"banned\". Roy Peter Clark and his big mouth can't name one \"banned\" book in Florida because THERE ISN'T ANY! Restricted yes, banned no. This is not a mistake folks this is purposefly trying to deceiptfully sway the unsuspecting unknowing reader with what a reasonable person could call at best deception and more than likely just a lie of using a term Clark knows is wrong and incorrect. NOTHING SAYS DISHONEST JOURNALISM LIKE TRYING TO FOOL PEOPLE WITH WORDS YOU KNOW ARE NOT ACCURATE TO SUIT YOUR COLLECTIVISM AGENDA. IT IS CALLED DISHONEST JOURNALISM IF YOU CAN CALL USING PURPOSEFUL MISLEADING BY DISHONEST INACCURATE TERMS JOURNALISM.\n\nRoy Peter Clark and the Tampa Bay Times cries that schools and parents are banning books with concepts and words not suitable for that age group. Roy Peter Clark and the Tampa Bay Times neo-marxism agenda has to label the accurate term \"restricted\" to the inaccurate misnomer dysphemism \"banned\" to get to their twisted convoluted conclusion.Banned is not the correct term the correct term is \"restricted\". Consider this hypocrisy of Roy Peter Clark and the Tampa Bay Times. Every printed and digital edition of the Tampa Bay Times has words that Roy Peter Clark and the Tampa Bay Times DO NOT ALLOW TO BE PRINTED BECAUSE THOSE WORDS ROY PETER CLARK AND THE TAMPA BAY TIMES KNOW DO ARE NOT AGE APPROPRIATE FOR ALL OF THEIR READERS. ROY PETER CLARK AND THE TAMPA BAY TIMES BY RESTRICTING WORDS BECAUSE THOSE WORDS ARE NOT AGE APPRORIATE FOR ALL OF THE TAMPA BAY TIMES READERS ARE DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING THEY ARE HYPOCRITICALLY CALLING THE PARENTS RIGHTS' OUT FOR. THE TAMPA BAY TIMES ARE NOTHING MORE THAN TWO-FACED DUPLICITIOUS HYPOCRIT NEO-MARXISTS NOT HONEST ENOUGHT TO CALL THEMSELVES WHAT THEY AREALLY ARE.\n\nI never see curse words in the Tampa Bay Times nor have I seen racial slur words and other offensive slur words which is completaly legal free speech in any of Roy Peter's Clarks propaganda puff pieces because they \"restrict\" use of those words because they are not age appropriate for all their readers. So what Roy Peter Clark and the Tampa Bay Times do is the exact same thing for the same reasons that they condemned the parents rights groups for \"restricting\" certain books that were not age appropriate. BUT THIS IS WHAT GOOD NEO-MARXIST MINIONS DO, THEY DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAY YOU SHOULD NOT BE DOINGN WHILE THEY DO IT FOR THIER SICK DISHONEST NEO-MARXIST POLITICAL AGENDA. KEEP IN MIND THAT TIC-TOK OWNED BY THE COMMUNIST CHINESE AND FACEBOOK ARE POLITIFACTS 2 BIGGEST FUNDERS TO THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS $$$$$, REMEMBER THAT POLITIFACT AND THE TAMPA BAY TIMES ARE OWNED BY POYNTER iNSTITUTE WHO GETS FUNDING TO THE MILLIONS $$$$$$ FROM TIK-TOK AND FACEBOOK TWO OF THE BIGGERS FREE SPEECH SUPRESSORS IN THE WORLD. THE TAMPA BAY TIMES IS NOT ON THE LEVEL AND THEY MISLEAD YOU TO BELIEVE.\n\nDysphemism: \"the substitution of an agreeable or inoffensive expression for one that may offend or suggest something unpleasant\". Here Peter Roy Clark dysphemisticly substitutes \"restricted\" for \"banned\". Disingenious regressive writers like Peter Roy Chark writing for the Marxist Tampa Bay Times have no scruples by using misleading, wrong misnomer words to disinform the reader and wrongly sway the reader with what is just DECEPTION! If Roy Peter Clark does not toe the Tampa Bay Times propagada line and write like this then he won't get his regressive hidden marxist philosophy into the Tampa Bay times propaganda paper and be able to push his boring books$$$ Shame on Peter Roy Clark$$$\n\nDysphemism \"is a proper language style that people pursue in social communication in order to reach an ideal communication effect.\" Here Roy Peter Clark substitutes the correct word \"restricted\" for the incorrect word \"banned\" in order to reach his desired effect on the unsuspecting reader. The accurate word \"restricted\" does not do the subliminal job so the good Marxist minion changes it to the inaccurate inflaming word \"banned\" for maxium propaganda effect. This is just one of the unscruplous Rules of Marxists' propaganda. \"A dysphemism is used when the propagandist attempts to increase the perceived quality, credibility, or credence of a particular ideal.\" Dysphemisms are a powerful tool that can be used to persuade people to believe or do a certain thing...They can be purposefully or accidentally misleading based on the speaker's/writer's intentions.\" In this Roy Peter Clark column he not only misleadlingly uses a severe misleading disinformation misnomer dyspheusim to suit his hidden politics he goes even further to dishonestly use the term misnomer \"banned\" when he knows very well the correct accurate word is \"restricted\". But since \"restricted\" does not do his bidding then he uses a word that does his bidding \"banned.\" That is called dishonest journalism and is in fact subtle political propaganda thinly propped up by the lie of the purposeful misuse of the inaccurate term \"banned\". When Roy Peter Clark's argument does not hold water using the correct word \"restricted\" he simply changes it to \"banned\" to suit his argument. When Peter Roy Clark purposely uses dishonest terms he can't then turn around and say that his argument is sound on what is essentially a lie. Roy Peter Clark used dysphemisms because correct wording would not have stood up to scrutiny so he changes the wording to try to sway you with what is nothing more than subtle subliminal collectivism propaganda. \"Banned\" in this article is newspeak that conveniently substitutes the accurate word \"restricted\" in place of inaccurate word \"banned\" because the accurate word \"restricted\" does not carry their hidden collective agenda.\n\nWhen a snake oil salesman like Roy Peter Clark and the Tampa Bay Times knows that if they call it what it is, \"restricted\", that will not sell their collectivism to the unsuspecting low intelligence readers so in order to sell their snake oil they simply change the name to the NEWSPEAK dysphemistic misnomer \"Banned Book\" to sell their misrepresented lie otherwise not sellable even to the gullible and naive.\n\nWhat does it say when disingenious writers like Peter Roy Clark purposely use misnomers in place of the correct accurate word so as to fool you to their twisted thinking. They can't use the correct word \"restricted\" for their \"banned\" book narrative because then that would end their dishonest manipulating narrative. PETER ROY CLARK AND THE IDEOLOGICLY CORRUPTED MEDIA INCLUDING THE TAMPA BAY TIMES MANIPULATES BY USING ORWELLIAN NEWSPEAK. In Orwell's words, Newspeak was \"designed to diminish the range of thought.\" Newspeak seeks to eliminate or alter certain words that do not fit Peter Roy Clark's, Tampa Bay Times and most of the other media's sick collective gobalist ideological agenda. In Orwell's novel 1984 Newspeak is a way of controlling the people's language in order to keep those of low intelligence quotient readers under ideological control. Newspeak is plain out lying, dishonest, deceptive and deceitful as it stifles accurate free speech and only allows only certain approved words, phrases and ideas to be used while other words are forbidden. Newspeak is purposeful disinformation. Peter Roy Clark pulling the dyspheism card is an admission of deception. Roy Peter Clark is using a sleazy rule right out of the collectivist's playbook that says if a word does not fit your deceptive narrative then simply change that word to a word that does suit his deceptice narrative."
