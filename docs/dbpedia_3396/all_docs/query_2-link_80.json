        "text": "Journalism: The Democratic Craft. With G. Stuart Adam. New York: Oxford University Press, 2006. An annotated anthology of more than 40 seminal essays on journalism and democracy, focusing on news judgment, the gathering of evidence, the appropriate use of language and narrative strategies, and the importance of critical thinking and interpretation.\n\nCoaching Writers: Editors and Reporters Working Together across Media Platforms. With Don Fry. Boston / New York: Bedford / St. Martin’s, 2003. Perhaps the first book to take editing beyond the technical aspects of craft to include the human element. Editors may have to fix broken stories, but more important is the mission of encouraging aspiring writers.\n\nThe Changing South of Gene Patterson: Journalism and Civil Rights, 1960 – 1968. With Raymond Arsenault. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2002. (New edition due in 2020.) For eight years during the civil rights movement, Gene Patterson wrote a signed column for the Atlanta Constitution every single day. This collection reveals what happens when a master writer – with moral and physical courage – attaches himself to a noble cause.\n\n​America’s Best Newspaper Writing(second edition). With Christopher Scanlan. New York: Bedford / St. Martin’s, 2006. Since 1979 the Poynter Institute has helped the American Society of Newspaper Editors conduct their Distinguished Writing Awards. This is a collection of the best work over three decades, with accompanying essays and commentary.\n\nFree to Write: A Journalist Teaches Young Writers. Portsmouth, N.H.: Heinemann Educational Books, 1987. In the early 1980s, I spent many days as a volunteer writing teacher in Florida public schools. For 29 consecutive summers I conducted writing camps for students and teachers. This book describes what I learned."
