        "text": "St. Petersburg Press, along with author and famed writing coach Roy Peter Clark, will celebrate the local publisher’s 5th anniversary Thursday, May 23 at the Palladium Theater’s Side Door.\n\nThe event will examine the “literary year in review” from retail, publishing, writing and journalism perspectives.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, Clark will bestow the Roy Peter Clark Literary Award to a St. Pete resident, someone Clark considers to have made significant contributions to the city’s literary environment. “It’s an honor for me to shine a light on the great work of five important figures: A poet, a novelist, an educator, a journalist and an independent bookseller,” he said.\n\nThe finalists:\n\nSigne Webb: Veteran high school teacher, language arts leader and published author. Clark: “I’ve worked with public school reading and writing teachers for more than 40 years, and Signe is at the top of the list of the most dedicated and creative.”\n\nGabrielle Calise: Culture reporter and storyteller for the Tampa Bay Times. Clark: “I fell in love with Gabrielle’s work when she wrote about St. Pete’s quirky driving experience known as Thrill Hill. She is a master of the offbeat whimsical narrative.”\n\nKelsey Jagneaux: Events coordinator for Tombolo Books. Clark: “Imagine the work required to organize hundreds of events for authors and book lovers. With her colleagues at Tombolo, she has energized the literary life of the Sunshine City.”\n\nLori Roy: Award winning novelist, author of several Southern mysteries, including the recent Lake County. Clark: “Not only is Lori a brilliant storyteller, she is a generous colleague and a skillful writing teacher, more than willing to share her craft.”\n\nTyler Gillespie: Reporter, humorist, teacher and poet. Clark: “I am amazed by Tyler’s energy. He is not a poet sitting on a mountaintop. He brings his love of language everywhere, from classroom, to coffee shop, to art gallery.”\n\nIn addition, Clark will pay tribute to Bob Devin Jones, the soon-to-retire founder of The Studio @620.\n\nTimes book editor Colette Bancroft was the award’s first recipient, in 2022; the 2023 honor went to poet Denzel Johnson-Green.\n\nSeveral St. Petersburg Press authors will speak at the May 23 event. Recent SPP works include the novel Blind Squirrel by Tampa Bay Lightning broadcaster Dave Mishkin; Open Mic For Animals: Evidential Fairy Tales by animal psychic Shannon Spring; the novel Midnight Climax by Peter Kageyama; and the third volume of Vintage St. Pete stories by this reporter.\n\nTickets are free, with a suggested donation to support local literacy efforts.\n\nLimited VIP packages are available for $100 (per ticket) and include two drink tickets, two St. Petersburg Press books signed by the author, a St. Petersburg Press T-shirt and priority seating.\n\nMore information is available here."
