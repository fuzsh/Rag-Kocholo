        "text": "Such a great ad for KitKat \"The break you need after 7 Zoom calls\" ✋🛑 So simple. But it hits soooo hard. 📌 On a related note, this study from Microsoft hit me: They did fMRI and EEG on people with and without meeting breaks. What they found? It was pretty wild to me. Here's the TLDR: \"Back to back meetings are one of the worst things you can do for your brain health in a work day\" Reminder: add breaks into your day. Not as a \"nice to have\" But as a \"must\" for these reasons: 1) Stress Reduction: Meditation breaks between meetings can reset the brain, preventing stress accumulation. 2) Engagement Improvement: Participants with breaks showed better engagement, attributed to positive frontal alpha asymmetry levels. 3) Focus Enhancement: Breaks help maintain steady beta wave activity, avoiding stress buildup and fostering better concentration. 4) Well-being: Incorporating short breaks is crucial for well-being and productivity in remote and hybrid work environments. 👋 P.S. How many back to backs did you have today? Get up. Stretch. Drink water. Look 200 ft away for 20s. I also got a walking pad to get my steps in. Has been a gamechanger for me 💪 👋 P.S.

A word on SEO plugins and tools. It's easy to think that a Wordpress plugin (Yoast, AIO, Rankmath) or an SEO tool (SE Ranking, SEMrush, Moz) can tell you exactly what to do with each of your web pages when it comes to SEO, but it can't. Why? Because all of these tools work to a process, a system that is by its very definition a list of things to reach the lowest common denominator. They work to a checklist. And that means that you, and everyone else following that checklist is going to be trying to do the exact same things. If everyone is doing the exact same things, and let's pretend their web pages are exactly the same, then it's impossible for them all to rank at number 1, right? Yoast, Rankmath, All In One SEO - these are just some of the SEO plugins you may be using on Wordpress. They all use some sort of traffic light or smiley face system to tell you whether your page is 'correct'. 🚦Green is good, red is bad, yellow/amber is 'do a bit more'. SEO tools usually use a percentage scale of how 'good' and 'well' your page is optimised. Many of the pages I have ranked on the front page of search engines have never had a green smiley face. Never take these as gospel. 🚫 You don't need an external link on a page if it's not relevant. 🚫You don't need sentences of x number of words, or paragraphs of x number of sentences, if it doesn't make sense for your content. 🚫You don't need transition words or power words or any other type of word - Google doesn't care. 🚫You don't need x% keyword density. Or the keyword/phrase repeated x number of times. 🚫You don't need to write so a 5th grader could read your page - I'm not even sure what age a 5th grader is! ✔️ You need to follow the simple basics of SEO and write for the intent of your reader. So please, use the AI tools (because that's what they are) as a guide, and a reminder if you've missed something obvious, but don't ever treat them as a prescriptive list of everything you have to do. Thanks to Alice Widger 🥛for reminding me I had this in drafts - please go follow her, she talks SEO sense."
