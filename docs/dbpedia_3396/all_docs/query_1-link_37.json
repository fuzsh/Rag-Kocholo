        "text": "American folk and country singer-songwriter (1941–2016)\n\nMusical artist\n\nGuy Charles Clark (November 6, 1941 – May 17, 2016)[1] was an American folk and country singer-songwriter and luthier.[2][3] He released more than 20 albums, and his songs have been recorded by other artists, including Jerry Jeff Walker, Jimmy Buffett, Kathy Mattea, Lyle Lovett, Ricky Skaggs, Steve Wariner, Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Nanci Griffith and Chris Stapleton. He won the 2014 Grammy Award for Best Folk Album: My Favorite Picture of You.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nClark was born in Monahans, Texas. His family moved to Rockport, Texas in 1954. After he graduated from high school in 1960, he spent almost a decade living in Houston as part of the folk music revival in that city. His wife Susanna Talley Clark and he eventually settled in Nashville, where he helped create the Americana genre. His songs \"L.A. Freeway\" and \"Desperados Waiting for a Train\" helped launch his career and were covered by numerous performers, including Steve Earle, Jerry Jeff Walker, Nanci Griffith, and Brian Joens. The New York Times described him in its obituary as \"a king of the Texas troubadours\", declaring his body of work \"as indelible as that of anyone working in the Americana idiom in the last decades of the 20th century\".[4]\n\nClark had been a mentor to such other singers as Noel McKay, Steve Earle and Rodney Crowell. He organized Earle's first job as a writer in Nashville. In the 1970s, the Clarks' home in Nashville was an open house for songwriters and musicians,[5] and it features in the film Heartworn Highways, an evocation of the songwriter scene in Nashville at that time.[6]\n\nNumerous artists have charted with Clark-penned tunes. \"The Last Gunfighter Ballad\" was the title song of Johnny Cash's 1977 studio album. In 1982, Bobby Bare made it to the Country Top 20 with Clark's \"New Cut Road\". That same year, bluegrass leader Ricky Skaggs hit number one with Clark's \"Heartbroke\", a song that permanently established his reputation as an ingenious songwriter. Among the many others who have covered Clark's songs are Vince Gill, who took \"Oklahoma Borderline\" to the Top 10 in 1985; The Highwaymen, who introduced \"Desperados Waiting for a Train\" to a new generation that same year; John Conlee, whose interpretation of \"The Carpenter\" rode into the Top 10 in 1987; and John Denver, who recorded Clark's \"Homegrown Tomatoes\" in 1988. Clark is frequently referred to as the Fifth Highwayman.[7]\n\nSteve Wariner took his cover of Clark's \"Baby I'm Yours\" to number one in 1988; Asleep at the Wheel charted with Clark's \"Blowin' Like a Bandit\" the same year. Crowell was Clark's co-writer on \"She's Crazy for Leavin'\", which in 1989 became the third of five straight number-one hits for Crowell. Brad Paisley and Alan Jackson covered Clark's \"Out in the Parkin' Lot\", co-written with Darrell Scott, on Paisley's Time Well Wasted CD. Jimmy Buffett, obviously influenced by Jerry Jeff Walker's earlier quality cover of \"Boats to Build\" on 1997's \"Cowboy Boots & Bathin Suits\", then covered Clark's \"Boats to Build\" and \"Cinco de Mayo in Memphis\".[8] Clark credits Townes Van Zandt as being a major influence on his songwriting. One of the most famous photos in country music history was taken on Clark's porch in 1972 of Clark, wife Susanna, Van Zandt, and Daniel Antopolsky by photographer Al Clayton. Clark and Van Zandt were best friends for many years until Van Zandt's death in 1997,[8] and Clark has included a Van Zandt composition on most of his albums. In 1995, he recorded a live album with Van Zandt and Steve Earle, Together at the Bluebird Cafe, which was released in October 2001. Other live material can be found on his album Keepers. Earle released the tribute album Guy in 2019.\n\nIn 2006, Clark released Workbench Songs. The album was nominated for Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album at the Grammy Awards. He also toured with Lyle Lovett, Joe Ely, and John Hiatt in 2004, 2005, and 2007. In May 2008, Clark canceled four concerts after breaking his leg.[9] After two months on crutches, he began to perform again on July 4 at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, DC, where he appeared with Verlon Thompson. On June 20, 2009, Clark announced a new album titled Somedays the Song Writes You, which was released on September 22, 2009. It features originals along with a Townes Van Zandt song titled \"If I Needed You\".\n\nIn December 2011, This One's for Him: A Tribute to Guy Clark (a two-CD set) was released by Icehouse Music and produced by longtime fan Tamara Saviano.[10][11] The CD won Americana Album of the Year at the 2012 Americana Music Honors & Awards.[12] Clark won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2014 for My Favorite Picture of You.[13]\n\nThe final song that Clark completed was co-written with Angaleena Presley and titled \"Cheer Up Little Darling\". It appeared on Presley's 2017 album Wrangled.[14]\n\nTexas country singer/songwriter Aaron Watson paid tribute to Clark in his song entitled \"Ghost of Guy Clark\", released in June 2019. In the song, Clark's ghost asks the protagonist to perform a song and is unimpressed; he then encourages the performer to write songs with greater passion.[15]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nClark had one son, Travis Carroll Clark (December 18, 1966 - October 12, 2017 aortic aneurysm),[16] from his first marriage to folksinger Susan Spaw.[17] He was married to songwriter and artist Susanna Clark from 1972 until her death from cancer on June 27, 2012.[5]\n\nOn May 17, 2016, Clark died in Nashville following a lengthy battle with lymphoma at the age of 74.[18][19]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album Peak chart positions Label US Country US US Heat US Indie US Folk 1975 Old No. 1 41 RCA 1976 Texas Cookin' 48 1978 Guy Clark Warner 1981 The South Coast of Texas 1983 Better Days 48 1988 Old Friends Sugar Hill 1992 Boats to Build Asylum 1995 Dublin Blues 1999 Cold Dog Soup Sugar Hill 2002 The Dark 46 2006 Workbench Songs 74 36 Dualtone 2009 Somedays the Song Writes You 59 13 39 2013 My Favorite Picture of You 12 62 14 5\n\nCompilations and live albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album Label 1979 On The Road Live [live, promo] Warner 1982 Best of Guy Clark RCA 1983 Guy Clark – Greatest Hits RCA 1995 Craftsman Rounder/Philo 1997 Keepers [live] Sugar Hill The Essential Guy Clark RCA 2001 Together at the Bluebird Cafe [live]\n\n(with Townes Van Zandt and Steve Earle) American Originals 2007 Americana Master Series:\n\nBest of the Sugar Hill Years Sugar Hill Live from Austin, TX New West Hindsight 21-20: Anthology 1975-1995 Raven 2008 The Platinum Collection Warner 2011 Songs and Stories Dualtone 2017 Guy Clark: The Best of Dualtone Years[20] Dualtone\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Single US Country Album 1979 \"Fools for Each Other\" 96 Guy Clark 1981 \"The Partner Nobody Chose\" 38 The South Coast of Texas 1983 \"Homegrown Tomatoes\" 42 Better Days\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nHeartworn Highways - Documentary, Snapper/Catfish, 1981/2003, with Townes Van Zandt, David Allan Coe, and Steve Earle\n\nBe Here to Love Me - Documentary, Rake Films, 2004\n\nHeartworn Highways Revisited 2015\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nWithout Getting Killed or Caught: The Life and Music of Guy Clark, by Tamara Saviano, 2016, Texas A&M University Press.
