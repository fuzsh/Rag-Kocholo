        "text": "Noted author and writing coach Roy Peter Clark is the guest for the next Journalist of the Year Zoom-in, a series of talks aimed at helping applicants for the scholarship competition sharpen their portfolios and applications.\n\nClark’s talk will focus on crafting effective, engaging personal narratives. Students and advisers are welcome to attend.\n\nThe Zoom-in is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. CST Tuesday, Jan. 5. Sign-up here to request login details for the Zoom-in. Attendees to our previous Journalist of the Year Zoom-in do not need to sign up again.\n\nClark has taught writing at the Poynter Institute since 1979. In more than three decades he served the institute as dean, vice president, senior scholar and member of the Board of Trustees. Clark has written or edited 19 books on writing and journalism, the most popular and influential being “Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer.”\n\nHis most recent work includes the book “Help! For Writers,” for which there is a mobile application, “How to Write Short: Word Craft for Fast Times,” and “The Art of X-ray Reading.” His work “Murder Your Darlings,” a book about writing books, was published in 2020.\n\nJEA Journalist of the Year coordinator Joe Humphrey, MJE, will moderate the Zoom-in.\n\n“It’s a real thrill to have Roy join us for this conversation,” Humphrey said. “I learn something new every time I hear him speak. He’s made me a better writer and done wonders for students of all ages.”\n\nWhile a personal essay has been part of the Journalist of the Year application for years, contest organizers this year underscored the importance of applicants exhibiting strong, vibrant voice in their essays.\n\nThe Journalist of the Year scholarship competition begins at the state level, with winning portfolios advancing to JEA, which will name one $3,000 scholarship winner and three runners-up, who each will receive $850 scholarships.\n\nFuture Zoom-ins, with topics to be announced, are scheduled for 7:30 p.m. CST Jan. 12, Jan. 19 and Jan. 26."
