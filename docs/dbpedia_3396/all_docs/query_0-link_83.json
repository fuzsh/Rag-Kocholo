        "text": "Welcome to episode #386 of Six Pixels Of Separation – The Twist Image Podcast. Every so often, I get the chance to dive deep into a topic that is of huge (and personal) interest to me. This is one of those episodes. Roy Peter Clark is widely regarded as \"America’s writing coach.\" He has a stated desire to create \"a nation of writers.\" He has taught writing to everyone from children to Pulitzer authors at the infamous The Poynter Institute – a school for journalism and writing in Florida. His books are \"must-haves\" for anyone who is a writer (or for those who have a desire to write). I own almost all of them, including Writing Tools, Help! For Writers (which is also a great mobile app) and his latest, How To Write Short. While some might confuse his latest book as a \"how to write for the Twitter era,\" it is so much more than that. He has more honors from the writing and academic world than I could ever list here, but let’s just say that to spend some time with someone who is so highly regarded in the writing world, is a pretty cool thing. So, if you tinker with words, have a desire to be a better writer or toil over what to tweet, this episode is for you.
