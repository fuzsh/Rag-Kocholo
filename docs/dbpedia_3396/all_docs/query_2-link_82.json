        "text": "Roy Peter Clark, vice president and senior scholar at the Poynter Institute, has written or edited 16 books on writing, including Help! for Writers and The Glamour of Grammar. He recently offered a coaching session to Dallas Morning News writers and editors, so Points asked him to sit for a Q&A.\n\nWhen you go to parties, do people get stiff and formal around you, like they're afraid you'll correct their grammar?\n\nYeah. … When someone shies away from me or writes me a note saying: “I can’t believe I’m writing a note to an expert on grammar. I checked it over 15 times because I don’t want you to think …” I say to them: “Please relax! You have experienced some kind of aversive conditioning from parents or teachers or someone who made you associate language use with punishment.” … Back in the mid-’80s, it was very common for students who misbehaved to be given writing as a punishment. Why don’t we say: You have to draw a picture because you were so bad? We know that there might be some normal inhibitions that a writer at any age has to overcome. In one of the Harry Potter movies, this horrible teacher, Dolores Umbridge, tells Harry Potter he has to come in for detention. And he has to write, “I must not tell lies” over and over again until she tells him to stop. But she gives him this magic pen, and as he writes the words on a piece of paper, the words are carved in blood on his hand. Is Harry going to grow up to be a writer?\n\nAre the various forms of rapid communication, such as texting and Twitter, mangling or killing our language?\n\nI don’t look at it that way, because I understand from the study of the history of the language, the literature, that there are always concerns about the death of the language. So the rate of change may have accelerated as a result of new technologies and other changes, but in general I’d say that the long-term effects of the Internet and other technological changes are likely to enrich the English language, as it’s done in the past. … There’s nothing inherent in the text message that requires it only to be used for trivial purposes. We see this on Twitter, as well. We see people use those 140 characters essentially as live reports from the scene of a disaster. We did that in the old days with wire reports. For an earlier generation, it was the telegram that required brevity.\n\nWhat about the way, for example, that rap performers communicate with their audiences and the effect it's having on the language?\n\nI’ll judge the material by the appropriateness of [violence and obscenities] to the message that the person is trying to send. I don’t think there are too many people who don’t recognize the artistry that comes from Mark Twain allowing this 11-year-old boy, Huck Finn, the freedom to tell the story in his language, in his regional dialect. Historically, that’s seen as a remarkable achievement that an author could essentially sacrifice his own language to let his character speak the truth to America about … all the things that are at the heart of that book.\n\nWe hear lots of horror stories about the low quality of writing among today's college and high school students. Is that a cause for concern?\n\nI was enlightened on this question by a fairly recent book called Our Underachieving Colleges … [including a chapter] on why students come into college and often leave college with limited writing skills. [Author Derek Bok] says that the problem at Harvard dates back at least to … the 1890s. I do believe that, in education, we tend to fall into the fallacy of the golden age. We think there was a time when students were polite, didn't carry guns and knew when to use the semicolon.\n\nExplain the difference between standards and rules.\n\nIn The Glamour of Grammar, there are 11 chapters devoted just to punctuation. Although I want students and all aspiring writers to learn the conventions of punctuation as they are recognized in the profession or the language club or the country that they're working in, I want them to be able to know them so they know when to violate them.\n\nResidents here very often mispronounce the possessive forms of our city and state, in part because the local newspaper adheres to an Associated Press style guideline that requires only an apostrophe at the end of possessives ending in S. If it does damage to the spoken word, shouldn't the rule be changed?\n\nI think The Associated Press has it all wrong. I was reading a very dramatic story in the St. Petersburg Times where the main character's name was Wes. Suddenly, Wes's gun, or Wes's vote, or Wes's choice suddenly becomes Wes' choice or Wes' gun. And because there's such a clear conflict between the way everybody would pronounce that and what I'm seeing on the page, it becomes this speed bump that, for a fraction of a sentence, prevents the steady advance that I need in order to make meaning as a reader. … A stylebook should be a comforter and not a straitjackett.\n\nThis Q&A was conducted, edited and condensed by Dallas Morning News editorial writer Tod Robberson.
