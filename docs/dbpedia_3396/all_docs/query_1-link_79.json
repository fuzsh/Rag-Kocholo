        "text": "Two-time Olympian Peter Bol will be eyeing a maiden podium finish in the men’s 800m event at the Paris 2024 Olympics and he will be in action between August 7 and 11 at the Stade de France.\n\nThe 30-year-old Bol made his Olympic debut at Rio 2016. He finished sixth in his heat with a time of 1:49.36.\n\nAt the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, however, he finished first in his semi-final and set what was then a national record of 1:44.11. Although he has improved his personal best to 1:44.00 at the Paris Diamond League in 2022, the national record of 1:43.99 in 800m currently belongs to Joseph Deng.\n\nIn the men’s 800m final at Tokyo 2020, Bol finished fourth and missed the bronze medal by 0.53s.\n\nHis fourth-place finish at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was the highest finish by an Australian male in an individual track event since Darren Clark's fourth in the 400m in 1988.\n\nBol is now competing in his third Olympics in Paris.\n\nAt Paris 2024, the men’s 800m athletics event starts on August 7 with round 1, which comprises six heats. Peter Bol is in heat 4. The top three in each heat advance to the semi-final, while the remaining finishers progress to the repechage round, held on the following day.\n\nThe men’s 800m semi-final is on August 9 and the final is on August 11 (wee hours on August 12 in Australia).\n\nPeyton Craig and Joseph Deng are the other Australian athletes competing in the 800m.\n\nNone of the Tokyo 2020 medal winners are in the 800m entry list for Paris 2024. However, the field has world champion Marco Arop of Canada and Kenya’s Emmanuel Wanyonyi, the Diamond League winner.\n\nPeter Bol’s Paris 2024 Olympics athletics men’s 800m schedule\n\nAll in Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)"
