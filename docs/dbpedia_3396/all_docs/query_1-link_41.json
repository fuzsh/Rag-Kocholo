        "text": "CONTENT from advertisers that resembles editorial coverage, commonly called native advertising, is drawing heightened scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission, which wants to establish guidelines for labeling it clearly. Now Shape magazine has drawn a rebuke for such content from advertising regulators for an unusual case in which it served as both publisher and advertiser.\n\nIn the September issue of Shape, a full-page article carried the headline “Water works!” under the heading of “News.” After citing many studies espousing hydration, and a warning from the Center for Science in the Public Interest against high-calorie sugary drinks, the non-bylined article said that about 20 percent of Americans did not like the taste of water.\n\n“If that sounds like you, check out the new Shape Water Boosters,” the article reads. “Just a single squeeze (equal to a half-teaspoon) adds delicious flavor — but not calories — along with a concentrated punch of nutrients that offer some important bonus benefits.” Accompanying the article are photos of all four varieties of the product, named for those promised benefits: Beauty, Wellness, Slim and Energy.\n\nThe National Advertising Division, the investigative arm of the ad industry’s voluntary self-regulation system, which operates under the aegis of the Better Business Bureau, conducted the inquiry. Shape “blurred the line between advertising and editorial content in a way which could confuse consumers,” the division stated in a ruling released last week.\n\nAccording to the decision, the publisher said that the ad required no disclosure because a connection between the publication and its branded products was obvious. It also “contended it would be odd if it could not recommend its own products in the same manner as other companies’ products in editorial content.”\n\nBut even if readers deduced that Shape was recommending products that it was also marketing, the ruling objected to it being labeled news and said that readers “attach different weight to recommendations made in an editorial context than recommendations made in an advertising context.” The company should “clearly and conspicuously designate content as advertising” when promoting its products within its publication, the ruling said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
