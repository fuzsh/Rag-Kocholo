        "text": "A trade union is a group of employees who join together to maintain and improve their conditions of employment.\n\nThe typical activities of trade unions include providing assistance and services to their members, collectively bargaining for better pay and conditions for all workers, working to improve the quality of public services, political campaigning and industrial action.\n\nNearly seven million people in the UK belong to a trade union. Union members include nurses, school meals staff, hospital cleaners, professional footballers, shop assistants, teaching assistants, bus drivers, engineers and apprentices.\n\nMost trade unions are independent of employers but have close working relationships with them.\n\nWhat trade unions do\n\nUnions train and organise workplace representatives who help union members with the problems they face at work.\n\nReps provide support and advice and campaign for better conditions and pay.\n\nUnions have brought significant changes to society, including:\n\na national minimum wage;\n\nthe abolition of child labour;\n\nimproved worker safety;\n\nimproving living standards by reducing the number of hours in the working week and encouraging a healthy work/life balance;\n\nimproved parental leave;\n\nequality legislation;\n\nbetter protection of migrant workers and a reduction in exploitation;\n\nminimum holiday and sickness entitlements.\n\nUnions have also made thousands of local agreements on issues affecting individual workplaces following consultation, negotiation and bargaining.\n\nWhat does UNISON do?\n\nHow trade unions work\n\nMost unions are structured as a network of local branches with reps in every workplace.\n\nUnion reps:\n\nnegotiate agreements with employers on pay and conditions;\n\ndiscuss major changes such as redundancy;\n\ndiscuss members’ concerns with employers;\n\naccompany members to disciplinary and grievance meetings;\n\nhelp members with legal and financial problems.\n\nHow does UNISON work?\n\nAre trade unions legal\n\nIn the UK trade union have a special status in law which gives them special rights that professional associations don’t have.\n\nEmployers have to work with recognised unions to:\n\nnegotiate pay and working conditions;\n\ninform and consult over changes at work such as redundancies;\n\nmake sure that the health and safety of workers is protected.\n\nUnion reps have the right to consult their members and employers. This means that, as a worker, you can have your say about workplace issues.\n\nYou cannot be punished by your employer if you join – or don’t join – a trade union.\n\nIn some countries around the world, trade unions are illegal. In some places, trade union activists are intimidated, threatened and sometimes killed just for trying to get fairer conditions for workers.\n\nWhy join a trade union?\n\nIn workplaces where there are unions, members benefit from the strength and security that comes from working together to tackle problems.\n\nEmployees at unionised workplaces earn around 12.5% more than non-unionised workplaces.\n\nThe major benefits are:\n\nbetter working conditions such as improved health and safety or pay;\n\ntraining for new skills to help you develop your career;\n\nadvice on your legal employment rights;\n\nadvice on finance and problems at work.\n\nTrade unions may also represent their members’ interests outside the workplace. For example, trade unions may lobby the government or the European Union on policies which promote their objectives.\n\nJOIN UNISON TODAY\n\nRecognised trade unions\n\nWorkplaces in different sectors have recognised trade unions they choose to work with. You should ask your employer which trade union they recognise.\n\nIf you belong to a trade union other than the one your employer recognises, your union may have less say in issues that affect you in the workplace."
