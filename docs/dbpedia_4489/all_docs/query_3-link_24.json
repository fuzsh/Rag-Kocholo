But most business leaders have responded in an outdated way, by embracing union busting at all costs. This ignores business risks of the modern era — and often encourages companies to break the law. In this article the authors, building on their academic and practical expertise, explain how leaders can respond much more constructively to the new wave of labor organizing.",
