        "text": "Harvard Trade Union Program\n\n112th Session\n\nJanuary 13 – February 14, 2025\n\nThe Harvard Trade Union Program is an intensive 5-week executive training program designed for trade union leaders. It is comparable to the advanced education that Harvard University offers to executive-level individuals in Business, Government, and Law.\n\nThe Harvard Trade Union Program selects a diverse group of union members with the ability and potential for future leadership in the labor movement. It teaches the essential skills for the management and leadership of unions, as well as providing a unique opportunity to explore key issues for the labor movement surrounded by dynamic classmates.\n\nParticipants will:\n\nGain insights into the complex political, social, and economic forces that shape their operating environment.\n\nExchange perspectives with faculty who are internationally recognized for their expertise on labor issues.\n\nDevelop relationships among people doing similar work in the national and international labor communities.\n\nInteract with future leaders in the corporate and public sectors by attending classes at the country’s most prestigious graduate schools of business, education, and government.\n\nQualifications\n\nApplicants to the Program should have:\n\nExperience as an officer or staff member of a local, regional, or national union.\n\nParticipants are expected to be in residence for the full term of the Program.\n\nThe ability to learn in an academic environment.\n\nFinancial sponsorship from their union or other source.\n\nAdmissions\n\nThe Program’s objective is to select participants with the ability and potential for future leadership in the labor movement. We encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds, geographic regions, and a variety of union experience. We are committed to the progress of women and diversity in the labor movement.\n\nApplications will be processed on a rolling basis and candidates will be notified as they are accepted.\n\nVisas for International Participants\n\nMost participants who are not U.S. citizens or residents will need a non-immigrant visa to attend our programs in the United States. You should request the 90-day B-1/B-2 Visa rather than the F-1 Student Visa to attend the HTUP, as program participants are not considered full-time enrolled students at Harvard University, and the program is shorter than 90 days. When you are admitted to the program, the admission letter you receive should be sufficient to obtain a visa for entry into the United States.\n\nCanadian citizens and citizens from Visa Waiver Program countries (including Australia and New Zealand) may come to the United States without a visa if they meet certain requirements. For more information about visa and passport requirements, visit the U.S. Department of State website.\n\nHousing\n\nOne bedroom apartments are provided for each participant located a short commute to the Harvard campus.\n\nPrivileges\n\nEach participant has access to many of the University’s facilities such as its library system.\n\nCost\n\nTuition, housing, books, and class materials……………………………………………………..$22,000\n\nAdditional expenses include transportation to and from Cambridge, meals, laundry, recreation, and incidentals.\n\nMany unions offer scholarships. Contact your union or us for more information.\n\nTo Apply\n\nOnline Application\n\nDownload Information brochure (PDF)"
