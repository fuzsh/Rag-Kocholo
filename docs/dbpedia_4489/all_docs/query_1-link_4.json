Some cards will also state that the employee desires an election to be held to determine whether or not the Union has the full support of the majority of the employees in the\n\nbargaining unit.\n\nBargaining Agent\n\nUnion certified by a government agency, such as the National Labor Relations Board, or recognized voluntarily by the employer, as the exclusive representative of all employees in the bargaining unit for purposes of collective bargaining.\n\nBargaining Rights\n\nThe rights outlined in Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. Rights of workers to negotiate the terms and conditions of employment through chosen representatives. The bargaining agent is designated by a majority of the workers in a bargaining unit.\n\nBargaining Unit\n\nA group of employees in a given workplace who have a sufficient similarity of interest to constitute a unit for the purpose of bargaining collectively with their employer. A bargaining unit is usually defined by the National Labor Relations Board, or similar federal, state or local agency.\n\nUnion Representative\n\n(B.A., Business Agent): A full-time representative of a local union whose job it is to represent members in the local.\n\nCard Check\n\nProcedure whereby signed authorization cards are checked against a list of employees in a prospective bargaining unit to determine if the union has majority status. The employer may recognize the Union on the basis of this card check without the necessity of a formal election. Often conducted by an outside party.\n\nCollective Bargaining\n\nNegotiations between an Employer and Union, representing a group of employees, that determines the conditions of employment. The result of the Collective Bargaining Procedure is called the contract. Collective Bargaining is governed by Federal and State Statutory Laws, Administration Agency Regulations, and Judicial decisions.\n\nUnion Contract\n\nAn Agreement in writing between the Union, acting as bargaining agent and the Employer, covering wages, hours, working conditions, fringe benefits, rights of workers and union, and procedures to be followed in settling disputes and grievances.\n\nRead More: Tired of empty promises? Get it in writing!\n\nGrievance\n\nA formal complaint, usually lodged by an employee or the union, alleging a misinterpretation or improper application of one or more terms in a collective bargaining contract. The method for dealing with grievances is through a grievance procedure negotiated in the union contract. If a grievance cannot be settled at the supervisory level, it can be appealed to higher levels of management.\n\nGrievance Arbitration\n\nThe appeal of grievances to an impartial arbitrator for final and binding determination. Sometimes called arbitration of “rights”. The arbitrator determines the meaning of the contract and clarifies and interprets its terms. Arbitration, where it is available, is usually the last step in the grievance procedure.\n\nGrievance Procedure\n\nThe steps established in a collective bargaining contract for the handling of grievances made by or on behalf of employees.\n\nLabor Organizer\n\nA person usually employed by a union (often the regional or international union), whose function it is to help the employees of a particular employer through the organizing process and o% er guidance on the best ways to go about joining the union.\n\nMade Whole\n\nA catchall phrase used in grievance and other legal action where a remedy is sought from an employer.

Organizing committee members, among other things, usually sign up their coworkers on authorization cards or petitions acknowledging support for union representation, hand out leaflets, attend meetings and visit workers at home to gain support for the union effort.\n\nPicketing\n\nThe carrying of signs or the passing out of literature protesting working conditions or actions taken by the employer. Picketing occurs during a strike, or in the form of an informational picket. In this tactic, designed to put pressure on the employer, union members inform the public and other workers about the conditions they feel are unfair.\n\nRank and File\n\nThe members of a union.

Some release time (with or without pay) may be available to stewards under specific language in many collective bargaining contracts.\n\nUnion Label or Bug\n\nA stamp or tag on a product or card in a store or shop to show that the work is performed by union labor. The “bug” is the printer’s symbol.\n\nWeingarten Rights\n\nThe rights of employees covered by the National Labor Relations Act to request union representation during investigatory interviews if they reasonably believe that the interview could result in their being disciplined. “Weingarten rights” also guarantee the rights of union representatives to assist and counsel employees during interviews which could lead to discipline."
