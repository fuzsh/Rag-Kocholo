As a global union federation with affiliates in 150 countries, we use our collective strength to expand collective bargaining, advance social and economic justice, hold corporations accountable and transform an unfair global economy.\n\nUNI has negotiated over 50 global agreements and protocols that have secured the rights of tens-of-millions-of workers worldwide. These agreements are vital tools to level the playing field between workers and multinational corporations, and they create frameworks for workers to organize and negotiate free from fear and intimidation. Many also establish global rights on issues like gender equality and workplace safety.\n\nGlobal Agreements\n\nUNI has negotiated over 50 global agreements and protocols with multinational companies and other bodies to secure and support workers’ rights throughout their operations. While all of these agreements establish and reinforce the right to organize and collectively bargain without fear or intimidation, many have been expanded to cover additional issues, such as discrimination, gender-based violence, occupational health & safety and remote work.\n\n+ More\n\nOur Mission\n\nOur mission is to build power and lift standards for working people through strong unions and effective collective bargaining. We can only achieve democracy at the workplace and beyond when workers shift the balance of power.\n\nWe are united for a sustainable and inclusive global economy, for democracy built upon a foundation of social and economic justice and for decent work for all.\n\n+ More"
