        "text": "Since 1942, the Harvard Trade Union Program has prepared union activists to meet the challenge of dynamic leadership within their unions and society. Today, the program helps union leaders develop keener analytical, managerial, and problem-solving skills as well as discover ways to deepen public understanding of the value and importance of labor unions.\n\nIt is comparable to the advanced education that Harvard University offers to executive-level individuals in Business, Government, and Law. It teaches the essential skills for the management and leadership of unions, as well as providing a unique opportunity to explore key issues for the labor movement.\n\nGraduates of the Harvard Trade Union Program hold leadership positions at every level, from their local unions to international positions, from the public sector to the trades, in the United States and around the world.\n\nUPCOMING PROGRAM:\n\nHarvard Trade Union Program 112th Session\n\nJanuary/February 2025\n\nRegistration information coming soon.\n\nSTAY UP TO DATE WITH HTUP EVENTS AND PROGRAMS:"
