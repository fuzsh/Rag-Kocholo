        "text": "Naturvetarna and other trade unions, negotiate favourable collective agreements with employers' organisations that are aimed at strengthening labour market conditions.\n\nBecause these two parties decide together on working conditions, then the conditions can be adapted to different business areas and industries, and are more flexible than legislation.\n\nIn Sweden, we believe that both employees and employers benefit from this system of negotiating working conditions. Read more about Naturvetarna.\n\nMeanwhile, as long as a collective agreement is in place, the trade unions commit themselves not to strike, which is called a peace obligation. In exchange, trade unions can influence conditions for employees. This is the basis of what is known as the Swedish Model.\n\nUnlike how it works in many other countries, employers generally do not perceive trade union membership to be negative in Sweden, but rather the opposite.\n\nIn order for trade unions like Naturvetarna to have sufficient legitimacy to negotiate good working conditions for scientists, it is important they have as many members as possible.\n\nIndustrial action\n\nWhen unions and employers do not agree on matters such as salaries, working hours, work environment or other conditions, the weapon of industrial action is the last resort in trying to reach agreement. Industrial action can take various forms, including strikes, lockouts or blockades.\n\nAll members at the company or the workplace to which the notice of industrial action applies are covered by the action, regardless of their form of employment. This means that categories such as fixed-term employees or temporary staff are also covered.\n\nMembers receive full compensation for salary loss from the first day in the event of a strike or lockout.\n\nWho is covered by a collective agreement?\n\nCollective agreements apply to everyone in a workplace where the employer has chosen to have a collective agreement.\n\nIn the central government sector and municipalities and regions, employees are always covered by collective agreements.\n\nIn the private sector, it is up to an employer to choose whether they should have a collective agreement for their employees.\n\nRead more about collective agreements here.\n\nIf you are not covered by a collective agreement, your individual employment contract is more important.\n\nInfluence at the workplace\n\nAt workplaces in which the employer is party to a collective agreement, members may form local associations working to ensure the employer complies with the terms of the relevant agreement. They also represent members in matters such as reorganisation, salary review and working environment.\n\nOut in the workplaces, it is primarily the elected union representatives who influence working environment and conditions. Consequently, it is vital that many members become involved in the local association. Through dialogue with the employer, they do an important job in creating a better workplace. The more members involved in the trade union's work, the greater the opportunities for the local association to influence the situation.\n\nThe local associations may consist of members of Naturvetarna only or they may also organise members from other trade unions for academics."
