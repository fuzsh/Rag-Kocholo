        "text": "In Denmark, trade unions play an important role at workplaces and in society as general.\n\nYou will find trade union structures at workplace level. A shop steward is a worker elected by the other workers at a company to represent them in discussions with management. Shop stewards participate in consultations with the management regarding working conditions and in some cases represent the workers in wage negotiations.\n\nTrade unions also play a significant role in upholding a safe and healthy work environment.\n\nAt national level, trade unions negotiate collective agreements with employers’ organisations. Since collective agreements regulate large parts of the labour market regulation, the trade unions play an important role to secure fair wages and good working conditions.\n\nThe regulation of working conditions is primarily in the hands of the social partners (employers and employees, each organised in various types of association), contributing to the creation of a dynamic labour market and at the same time strengthening the influence and relevance of the social partners.\n\nThe social partners' large influence on employment policy, wages and labour conditions are characteristic of the Danish labour market model. The state's cooperation with the social partners is today an integrated part of the Danish employment policy.\n\nAs an example, in Denmark there is no legislation regulating wages. Wages are exclusively defined in the collective agreements. Wage-setting and the development of salaries are negotiated at company or sector level by the social partners.\n\nAll workers are free to join a trade union, and it is the trade union with all its collective strength, which protects/fight for the employees’ rights, not the individual employee. Almost 70 percent of the Danish workforce belong to a trade union.\n\nWithout members of trade unions, there would be no legitimacy for social partners to regulate via collective agreement or to enforce the rules of the labour market.\n\nYou can find more information about trade unions by visiting lifeindenmark.dk.\n\nGo to lifeindenmark.dk to read more about trade unions\n\nMembership and unemployment insurance\n\nThe membership of a trade union is not obligated by law. However, if you choose to become a member of a trade union, your choice of trade union depends on your education/position and workplace.\n\nTrade unions are most often associated with unemployment insurance funds (in Danish called “A-kasse”). Having unemployment insurance is generally a good idea. In order to sign up for an unemployment insurance fund you are not obligated to become a member of a trade union.\n\nRead more about why you should sign up for an unemployment insurance fund here\n\nLinks to a selections of trade unions with English websites"
