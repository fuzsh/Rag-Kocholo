Your local union leadership can request the curriculum kit through your Servicing Rep.\n\nPresenting Union Label information at membership meetings\n\nDeveloping and distributing buying guides – this can be an overall guide or specific, like: candy for Valentine’s, Easter, Halloween, back-to-school or Christmas shopping, there are certain times of the year when people pay attention to shopping\n\nProvide Union Label content and announcements for the Local Union newsletter, website or social media\n\nAsking people to take the Union Label Pledge\n\nDesigning a traveling display to be used at civic and school functions\n\nJoining school boards or PTA’s to promote Buying American/Buying Union\n\nAttending Community or Town Hall meetings to promote spending tax dollars on Union made school buses, fire equipment and police equipment\n\nAsking management to buy or lease union-made equipment and office supplies and hire union companies and contractors to service the worksite\n\nReminding leaders to use union vendors for catering picnics or parties\n\nReminding members to book travel on union airlines and in union hotels\n\nThe links below provide useful tools and information for this committee.
