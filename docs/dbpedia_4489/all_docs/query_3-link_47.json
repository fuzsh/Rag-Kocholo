        "text": "The Alberta Human Rights Act protects against discrimination in the area of membership in trade unions, employers’ organizations, or occupational associations (referred to as “trade unions and associations”). This means trade unions and associations cannot exclude, discriminate against, remove, or suspend a member based on a protected ground.\n\nA trade union is an organization of employees that manages the relationship between employees and employers. An employers’ organization is an organization of employers that manages the relationship between employees and employers. Whereas a trade union is for employees, an employers’ organization is for employers. An occupational association is an organization in which employees must be a member to carry on a trade, occupation, or profession. An occupational association is not a trade union or an employers’ association.\n\nTrade unions and associations cannot discriminate against members or potential members based on one or more protected grounds. Trade unions and associations also have a duty to accommodate members to the point of undue hardship.\n\nExamples of discrimination by trade unions and associations include:\n\nexcluding or discriminating against members based on a protected ground, including a disability (such as a drug or alcohol dependency) or place or origin (such as foreign credentials)\n\ncreating a discriminatory policy in the collective agreement or other organization policy\n\nrefusing to fulfill its duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship\n\nopposing an employer's attempt to provide reasonable accommodation\n\nretaliating by reducing services to a member who makes a human rights complaint\n\nexcluding, removing, or suspending a member based on one or more protected grounds\n\nrefusing to file a grievance or help with a human rights complaint when the refusal is based on a protected ground\n\nA member who believes their trade union or association has discriminated against them can make a human rights complaint against their trade union or association. The member must make the complaint within one year of the discriminatory incident.\n\nTrade unions and associations can help members with human rights issues. Some of the actions a trade union or association can take are:\n\nkeeping an open dialogue and making sure members are aware of meetings and decisions that affect their interests\n\nconsulting with members about their needs\n\nhelping members identify possible solutions\n\nworking with members and employers to find accommodation options\n\nreviewing workplace policies and procedures for resolving complaints\n\nadvocating for members\n\nreferring members to the Commission and informing them of the one-year limitation period for making a complaint to the Commission\n\nFor example, a member may feel uncomfortable working with someone harassing them. In response, the trade union could suggest the employer separate the person experiencing harassment from the person doing the harassing.\n\nTrade unions can also work with employers to accommodate a member’s needs based on a protected ground. For example, a trade union can help a member with a disability to communicate their accommodation needs. The trade union may need to educate and inform other members and co-workers about the duty to accommodate to understand why a member is being accommodated.\n\nAn employee who believes their employer has discriminated against them can make a human rights complaint against their employer. The member must make the complaint within one year of the discriminatory incident. A person who brings a grievance about human rights issues may be limited in also bringing a human rights complaint. If the facts of your dispute could be addressed through both a grievance and a human rights complaint, you should seek legal advice to determine where to proceed."
