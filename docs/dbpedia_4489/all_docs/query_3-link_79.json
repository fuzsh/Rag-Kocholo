        "text": "Who this guidance is for\n\nThe CO keeps a list of trade unions and employers’ associations in Great Britain. To be added to the list, your organisation must apply to the CO.\n\nThis guidance is for organisations that want to apply. You should read all of this guidance before you apply. If you want to be added to the list as an employers’ association or federated trade union you should first contact the CO’s team to discuss your application.\n\nTelephone: 0330 109 3602 Email: info@certoffice.org\n\nThe organisation will not automatically be added to the list on application. The CO will approve or reject an application.\n\nTrade unions are not legally obliged to be on the list. However, unions that are on the list:\n\nget protection for their name – other unions on the list must not have a similar name\n\nhave official proof that they are a trade union – for example if they need to provide evidence of their status to an employer or a court\n\ncan apply for a Certificate of Independence, which allows them to apply for legal recognition with an employer and gain legal rights such as the right to time off to do their union duties\n\ncan claim tax relief on income and gains used for certain purposes\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nYou will need to prove to the CO that your organisation meets the legal definition of a trade union.\n\nTo do that, you must show that:\n\nmost of the members are workers (in most cases this means that they have a UK contract of employment) *one of the organisation’s main purposes is the collective regulation of relations between those workers and their employers\n\nInformation you need to provide\n\nThe application should include:\n\npayment of the £519 application fee\n\nthe organisation’s name\n\nthe address of the organisation’s main office\n\nthe date the organisation was formed\n\nthe number of members it currently has\n\nthe membership application form\n\nthe organisation’s rules\n\nthe names and addresses of the current general secretary, president, treasurer, members of the executive committee and trustees (these roles may be known by other names in the organisation)\n\nevidence that the organisation meets the legal definition of a trade union\n\nevidence that most of the members are workers\n\nevidence that the organisation currently regulates relations or is attempting to regulate relations on a collective basis for its members.\n\nThe rules of the organisation\n\nThe CO would normally expect to see the following in your rules:\n\naims and objectives, which include the regulation of relations between members and their employers\n\nthe industries in which the organisation seeks to regulate relations with employers (where you intend to organise)\n\nmembership criteria (who can join the organisation)\n\nsubscription rates\n\nthe make-up of the executive committee, with job titles and information on how often the committee will meet\n\nwho the officials of the union are\n\ndetails of the annual membership conference/meeting\n\nappointment of auditors and removal of auditors\n\nappointment of trustees\n\ngrievance and disciplinary procedures for members\n\nThe organisation’s rules should also include the election procedures for the general secretary, president and executive committee members. These should adhere to procedures set out at section 46 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.\n\nSee section 46 of the Act on www.legislation.gov.uk.\n\nHow to apply\n\nOnly start your application when you have all necessary information and supporting evidence. If the CO refuses your application and you re-apply, you will have to pay the application fee of £519 again.\n\n1. Download an application form\n\nFill in all fields on the form.\n\nDownload CO1 form (MS Word Document, 34.4 KB)\n\n2. Gather evidence\n\nProvide as much evidence as possible that the organisation is a trade union.\n\nFor example, you can provide:\n\nthe number of members who are workers, and the names of their employers\n\nthe names of employers that recognise the trade union, with supporting correspondence\n\nthe names of employers the union is currently in discussions with, and supporting correspondence\n\nthe union’s plans for organising and regulation of relations, with the names of the employers you intend to approach or have already approached *the organisation’s experience of representing individual members and non-members and the nature of the representation\n\ninformation on whether the organisation charges for individual representational work\n\n3. Pay the application fee\n\nThe fee is £519.\n\nThe CO encourages you to discuss your application with the CO team before making the formal application, because once the application fee is paid it is not refundable. You can contact the CO team by emailing info@certoffice.org\n\nInstructions on how to pay the fee are included on the application form CO1.\n\n4.

They will advise the CO on whether to proceed with your application.\n\nIf the CO or her team needs more information, they will contact you.\n\nIf the CO refuses your application, she will issue a decision setting out the reasons for the refusal. You can appeal the decision through the Employment Appeal Tribunal.\n\nIf the CO is satisfied that your organisation is a trade union, she will add the union to the official list. You will receive a listing certificate and information on the union’s legal obligations.\n\nTimeframe\n\nSomeone from the CO’s office will contact you shortly after receiving your application. The process can take several weeks. Your application can take much longer if you do not provide the necessary information or sufficient evidence that you are a trade union. In this case, CO staff will not make a recommendation to the CO until they have all the information they need. This can take several months.\n\nTrade union legal obligations\n\nAll organisations that meet the legal definition of a trade union have legal obligations, whether or not they are on the CO’s official list.\n\nThese legal obligations include, but are not limited to:"
