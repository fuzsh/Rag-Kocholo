        "text": "The Right of Association in Sweden\n\nThe right of association that is in force in Sweden gives you the right to freely join a trade union of your choice. An employer cannot say that you are not allowed to join a trade union. It is a violation against the freedom of association if anyone, in any way, tries to prevent you from joining a trade union.\n\nThe level of trade union membership is Sweden is high – about 70% - and membership is often encouraged by employers. As Unionen is not linked to any political party we can always pursue policies that, irrespective of political considerations, entail a better working life for our members.\n\nThe Swedish model - collective agreements\n\nThe collective agreements form the basis of ‘the Swedish model’ in which the conditions in each sector are determined by the trade unions and the employer organisations. The government does not interfere, though it may set the boundaries through labour laws, as the trade union and employer organisations are responsible. The model combines flexibility for companies with security and influence for employees.\n\nCollective agreements\n\nA collective agreement is a voluntary agreement between employers and employees on your rights at the workplace. The collective agreement regulates pay increases every year, overtime pay, supplementary insurance schemes, the right to exert influence and so on. If you are employed at a workplace with a collective agreement then you can be safe in the knowledge that there is a good agreement for you that covers your pay, form of employment, working hours, holidays, period of notice and much more. Approximately 8 out of 10 members in Unionen are covered by a collective agreement and Unionen have in total close to 100 different collective agreements with employer organisations in the private sector.\n\nRead more:\n\n\"The collective bargaining process - re-negotiating salaries and working conditions\" (Avtalsrörelsen in Swedish)\n\n\"The Mark - the collective salary increase level\" (Märket in Swedish)\n\nFor your own sake. And for everyone else’s\n\nAs a member of Unionen, you get lots of personal services, benefits and tools that boost your own security and development, whether you have a job, are applying for a job, becoming a manager, starting your business or studying.

Read more about legal support.\n\nIncome insurance – supplements the unemployment benefit fund (a-kassa), meaning that you can insure an income of up to SEK 60000/month if unemployed for up to 150 days, around 7 months.\n\nPersonal insurance – for you and your family. 3 months free of charge if you meet the policy requirements.\n\nCollective agreement with good terms including pay rises, overtime payments, occupational pension, sick pay, etc.\n\nChecking contracts of employment\n\nPersonal development\n\nCareer planning and career tools\n\nSupport before pay and performance reviews\n\nSeminars and lectures\n\nResumé (CV) and LinkedIn services\n\nInfluence\n\nOption of joining a Unionen club at work.\n\nIn the event of changes, the club negotiates pay rises and is a driving force on terms and conditions at work\n\nOption of workplace representative at smaller workplaces\n\nInput on improvements to pay and working conditions to be put forward by Unionen in the collective agreement negotiations.\n\nA say in Unionen’s activities and membership.\n\nBenefits\n\nKollega - members’ magazine\n\nDiscounts on home, house and car insurance.\n\nBeneficial mortgages and loans\n\nDiscount on courses, magazines, books etc.\n\nMembership Terms and Conditions\n\nThe statutes of Unionen cover all members. We wish to draw your attention specifically to a couple of things mentioned in the statutes.\n\nAs a new member, you are immediately entitled to advice and information from Unionen and after three months you can be represented in negotiations, as long as the matter occurred three months after your application for membership was accepted by Unionen.\n\nExemptions from the three month rule may be granted if there are special circumstances, for example if Unionen has a fundamental interest in the matter. Exemptions may also be granted if the member is new to the labour market, for example has come directly from being a student, immigrated from another country or some other similar situation. You are immediately entitled to support in negotiations if you are switching directly from membership of another trade union.\n\nDo not forget that you need to be a member of a Swedish unemployment insurance fund, the Unionen unemployment insurance fund or some other, in order to be entitled to our income protection insurance scheme.\n\nIf you wish to become a member of the Unionen unemployment insurance fund or any other unemployment insurance fund of your choice, you need to submit a separate application form supplied by the unemployment insurance fund.\n\nGuest membership\n\nGuest Membership is offered to anyone that has been granted a work permit to carry out work in Sweden as a white-collar worker at a workplace in the private sector and who is a citizen\n\nof a country within EU/EEA and Switzerland and is on a posting from your home country for work in Sweden\n\nof a third country\n\nFor just SEK 200 you will become a guest member and get quick and professional support concerning all aspects of your working life in Sweden. If you are employed in Sweden, we can also represent you in legal labour issues. Being a guest member immediately entitles you to advice, and after three months entitles you to be represented in negotiations, as long as the matter occurred after your application for membership was accepted by Unionen.\n\nRead more about Guest Membership"
