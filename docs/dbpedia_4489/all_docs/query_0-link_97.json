        "text": "Nonunion employees - Initial Work Stoppage Action\n\nA. Honoring of Picket Lines by Nonunion Employees\n\nAn employer involved in a trade dispute may have both union and nonunion employees in its workforce. For example, the production workers are members of a union, while the clerical workers are not represented by a union. If the union members take strike action, the eligibility of the nonunion employees depends on whether or not they choose to voluntarily leave their work in support of the union members. If the nonunion employee elects not to report to work due to the trade dispute, the employee is considered to have adopted the trade dispute as his/her own and is subject to disqualification under Section 1262.\n\nOn the other hand, if the nonunion employee is laid off due to lack of work caused by the trade dispute, the employee is not subject to disqualification under Section 1262. In the 1953 Chrysler court case, the production workers, members of the union directly involved, took strike action. Nonunion office workers were laid off at a later date due to lack of production. The court held the nonunion employees were eligible since there was no voluntary action to leave on their part.\n\nB. No Union Trade Disputes\n\nBriefly stated, a trade dispute is defined as a controversy over conditions of work between a union or group of workers, acting in concert, and an employer. There is no requirement that a union must be involved in the trade dispute to meet the definition of a trade dispute.\n\nIn PB 399, 20 employees, who were not represented by a union, expressed dissatisfaction with overtime and unsafe working conditions to their foreman. Subsequently, the president reprimanded the employees for poor work. On that same day, a Friday, the employees left work without advance notice. No picket line was established. On Monday morning, the striking employees returned to the employerâ€™s premises. At 9:30 a.m., the employees asked to see the president. At this point, the employees were terminated\n\nThe employer contended there was no true trade dispute because there was no uniformity of thought amongst the employees as to their reason for leaving work; grievances were not communicated to the employer; and it was essential to examine the merits of the walkout.\n\nIn holding there was a trade dispute within the meaning of Section 1262, the Board cited PB 24:\n\nThe Board cited numerous NLRB cases which have addressed the question of when employees were considered to be engaged in a trade dispute, including the following:\n\nThe Board added:\n\nThe Board, in PB 399, then concluded that the claimant was discharged due to his participation in a trade dispute and that such action did not constitute misconduct under Section 1256."
