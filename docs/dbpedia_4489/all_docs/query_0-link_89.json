        "text": "The Labour Party was formed out of the trade union movement to give working people their own political voice. The link from the workplace to the party through the affiliated trade unions is what makes it unique to this day. This link is more important than ever as we work together to tackle the urgent problems we face as a country, from stagnating wages to failing public services.\n\nLabour Unions is the umbrella organisation that coordinates the activities of the 11 trade unions who affiliate to the Labour Party.\n\nFor more information or to receive updates, visit LabourUnions.org.uk or find out why you should join a trade union below.\n\nWhy you should join a trade union\n\nTrade unions give power to working people and enable employees to speak with one voice to their employer.\n\nThey also help us to have a strong presence in every workplace and community up and down the country. Join a Labour-affiliated union today.\n\nDignity\n\nTrade unions give power to working people. They enable employees to speak with one voice to their employer – making us stronger together than we are alone.\n\nRights\n\nWorkers in unionised workplaces are less likely to lose their job, and are likely to have better than average maternity, paternity and redundancy policies.\n\nHigher and more equal pay\n\nUnion members earn 10% more than non-members. Women are also more likely to get paid the same as men for doing the same or similar work.\n\nRepresentation\n\nUnions provide access to legal advice on employment matters and can represent you at any employment tribunal. They support and represent members who are the victims of discrimination, harassment or bullying.\n\nThe Labour Family\n\nFrom the beginning trade unionists have been at the heart of our party. By working together we have changed Britain for the better from the NHS to the welfare state."
