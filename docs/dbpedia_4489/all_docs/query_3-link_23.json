        "text": "What Is Organized Labor?\n\nOrganized labor is a strategy of workers joining together to engage in collective bargaining for higher wages, job benefits, or better working conditions. Organized labor associations are also known as unions.\n\nHow Organized Labor Works\n\nWorkers participate in organized labor by joining a union that negotiates with their employer on their behalf. Because unions represent a large number of workers, they are able to extract higher salaries and benefits than most workers could get by negotiating alone.\n\nIn most countries, union formation is regulated by a government agency, such as the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the United States. Employees who want to organize their workplace must first sign a union card granting the union the right to represent them.\n\nOnce a workplace has enough signatures, workers can file for a union election in that workplace. If a majority of non-management employees vote for the union, it will be given the power to negotiate with management on behalf of all employees. There are two types of unions: the horizontal union, in which all members share a common skill, and the vertical union, composed of workers from across the same industry.\n\nThe National Education Association (NEA) is the largest labor union in the United States, with nearly three million members. Its goal is to advocate for education professionals and unite its members to fulfill the promise of public education.\n\nHistory of Organized Labor\n\nOrganized labor grew out of the industrial revolution. As production shifted from agriculture to increasingly-large factories, the pursuit of higher profits led to strenuous working conditions and long hours.\n\nIn the early days of industrialization, it was not uncommon for employees to be on the job seven days a week, working shifts of twelve or even fourteen hours. Since workers could be easily replaced, they could not demand better working conditions and were often fired if they were injured on the job. Child labor, wage theft, and other unfair practices were also common.\n\nThe first successful unions in the United States organized skilled laborers, such as railway workers. The American Federation of Labor, founded in 1881, sought to bring together the country's nascent trade unions under a single association. At the same time, radical unions like the Industrial Workers of the World sought to organize all workers, regardless of their skill.\n\nEmployers fiercely resisted unionization efforts, often using strikebreakers and lockouts to prevent workers from organizing. In some cases, government and police authorities used violence to quell labor unrest.\n\nUltimately, organized labor was able to win significant improvements, such as the eight-hour day, paid weekends, and job security. The Wagner Act, signed by Franklin Roosevelt in 1935, enshrined the rights of workers to organize and form unions.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Organized Labor\n\nOrganized labor plays an important role in protecting workers' rights. Advocates claim that workers in unionized industries typically enjoy higher salaries, longer vacations, and better benefits than those who are not represented by a union. Even workers who are not members of the union tend to have higher salaries as a result of union activity.\n\nNaturally, companies are less enthusiastic about organized labor. Some say that the increased cost of a unionized workforce increases the price of their products, ultimately making their companies less competitive on the world market. Many point to the decline of the U.S. auto industry, as companies were unable to pivot effectively due to the cost of adhering to their union contracts.\n\nSome companies, such as Starbucks or Amazon, have each spent millions of dollars to defeat union organization efforts. Walmart, for example, claimed that the increased costs of a unionized workforce would require them to increase their prices.\n\nOther retailers used Walmartâ€™s example as leverage to renegotiate with their unions, claiming that they would have to cut salaries or eliminate jobs to remain competitive with Walmart otherwise. This is known as the Walmart effect.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nOrganized labor represents a major political force for the working class. By joining together to advocate for their shared goals, unionized workers can negotiate for better wages and working conditions. However, the strength of organized labor has declined in recent decades, largely due to increased competition from low-wage workers abroad."
