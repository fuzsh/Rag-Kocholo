You can find all information about the JCCP at jccppgh.com or @jccppgh on social media.\n\nIt is said Rocky Horror is the first and only true audience participation movie. Therefore, props are allowed and costumes are strongly encouraged! Below is a specific list of props which will be allowed at The Oaks Theater along with theater rules & regulations.\n\nYou must be at least 17 years old or accompanied by a parent or guardian (age 21 or older) to attend\n\nThis movie is all about participation but we also want to make sure the theater isn’t damaged, wrecked, or burned down (under NO circumstances should an open flame ever be used within the Oaks Theater). People are absolutely encouraged to dress up and have fun, but there are just a few things we cannot and will not allow and they are listed below as well as when to use them. Another thing we ask is to please not throw things at the screen.\n\nHere’s your play-by-play of when to use your props, as well as the things that are not allowed:\n\nBalloon\n\nIs it allowed? Yes\n\nWhen to use: During the song “Science Fiction Double Feature”, pop at the “When worlds collide” lyric.\n\nRice\n\nIs it allowed? No – Not included in the kit and not allowed. Sorry rice can get slippery, it’s messy, and we don’t want rodents. There’s a reason people don’t throw rice at weddings anymore.\n\nWhen to use: At the beginning of the film when the wedding guests exit the church.\n\nLarge “J”-“A”-“N”-“E”-“T” cards\n\nIs it allowed? Yes, we just didn’t include it since it takes some decent coordination between people to pull off. You’re welcome to do it if you feel like your four friends can spell.\n\nWhen to use: During the song “Dammit Janet” when Brad says Janet’s name, and when spells out Janet’s name, each card is held up as he spells it. Some people also write “Oh” “B”-“R”-“A”-“D” on the back of them and use them then.\n\nWater Guns\n\nIs it allowed? No, sorry we’re not a friend of wet floors, seats, etc..\n\nWhen this normally happens: During the song There’s a Light (Over at the Frankenstein Place), while they are walking through the rain\n\nGlow Stick / flashlight\n\nIs it allowed? Yes (NO Lighters, matches, flammables due to fire code restrictions). Get creative and download a concert lighter app on your phone. Those are much less flammable!\n\nWhen to use: During the song There’s a Light (Over at the Frankenstein Place), while the “There’s a Light” chorus is playing. Do this during the chorus and when they say “in the darkness” lower it.\n\nRubber Glove\n\nIs it allowed? Yes\n\nWhen to use: During Frank’s speech at the tank when he puts on the gloves, stretches and snaps them. He does this three times and try to snap them at the same time!\n\nNoisemakers\n\nIs it allowed? Yes\n\nWhen to use: During the “Lab” scene, when the Transylvanian Guests use their noisemakers at the end of the creation speech.\n\nConfetti\n\nIs it allowed? No\n\nWhen to use: At the end of the “Lab” scene when the wedding march is being played when they head to the bedroom.\n\nToilet Paper\n\nIs it allowed? Yes\n\nWhen to use: When Dr. Scott makes his entrance and Brad exclaims “Great Scott!”. Get it? Like Scotts toilet paper? Yeah, that’s why people do it. Wait to toss it when Dr. Scott crashes through the wall. By the time Dr. Scott hits the Transducer wall and Frank has his leg on the chair it’s time to stop tossing.\n\nParty Hat\n\nIs it allowed? Yes\n\nWhen to use: During dinner, Frank will put on his party hat, and you should too. It’s a party after all and you should be dressed appropriately ????\n\nToast\n\nIs it allowed? : No. Sorry it’s a pun and I love puns but your mom taught you better than to toss food. We’d rather not have crumbs everywhere either.\n\nWhen this normally happens: During dinner after Frank is done carving, he will lift his class and proclaim “a toast”.\n\nNewspaper\n\nIs it allowed? : Yes\n\nWhen to use: When Brad and Janet are caught in the storm, Janet covers her head with a newspaper, and you should do the same.\n\nBell\n\nIs it allowed? Yes, if you didn’t bring a bell you can use your keys also. However it doesn’t look as cool.\n\nWhen to use: When Frank is chasing Janet after dinner and asks the musical question “did you hear a bell ring?” during the song “Planet Schmanet”\n\nSponge\n\nIs it allowed? Yes\n\nWhen to use: When Columbia is doing her “bitch out” speech and says to Frank, “you’re like a sponge!”\n\nCards\n\nIs it allowed? Yes\n\nWhen to use: After floor show, when Frank is doing his solo number and sits down and sings the line “cards for sorrow, cards for pain”. Make it rain!\n\nRope\n\nIs it allowed? Yes.\n\nWhen to use: When the rope falls from the rigging after Riff finishes shooting.\n\nHot Dog and Prunes\n\nIs it allowed? Please, please, please DON’T.\n\nPeople sometimes throw these anytime they’re mentioned. It’s messy, stains things, and nobody wants to get hit with a prune or a hot dog for that matter.\n\nWe want this showing to be as enjoyable as possible so please respect other guests and our theater. Guests who bring in props not listed above and fail to adhere to the instructions above will be asked to leave.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe New PURE GOLD\n\nDoors 6:30 PM / Show 7:30 PM\n\n$25 Reserved seating\n\n$120 Table seating for 4\n\nThe New PURE GOLD\n\nWith a music career spanning four decades, Pure Gold performs material from the '50s, '60s and '70s as well as a blend of blues, standards and original material to highlight their unique talent and range.\n\nStarting in 1978 as Acapella Gold, they quickly gained popularity.

After 43 years of performing and sharing the stage with many music legends such as Aretha Franklin, Frankie Valli, Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson, the Four Tops, The Temptations and the Isley Brothers to name a few, Pure Gold decided to retire, and their fans were sad to see this legendary group perform its final show in December 2021. With permission from the group's lifelong manager, Henry DeLuca, an agreement was made to continue under new management with some new personnel and a slightly modified name: The New PURE GOLD.

Energy. Swagger. All these arrive onstage when Good Shot Judy shows up. Grounded in the swinging cadence of the big band era, Good Shot Judy boldly ventures wherever whimsyleads them. The big amp jazz band brings melodic muscle to every show, fueled by revelersyoung and old who eagerly follow them on an exhilarating ride through this golden age of music.\n\nLongie\n\nIt’s hard to nail an exact moment when Good Shot Judy came to life.\n\nIt could have been when brothers Brett and Jeff Cahoon stepped away from the success they’d achieved with their punk band Ten Years from Now and chose instead to see what they could do with the old-time jazz standards they’d admired for so long. The brothers Cahoon formed a small combo, and – wouldn’t you know it? – plenty of others felt the same groove.\n\nOr maybe it was when an inside joke made a name for itself. Their mother, Judy Cahoon, was an avid golfer, and just as common as pars and birdies were three words of encouragement shouted by a supportive friend, who pumped a fist and hollered across the fairway every time she took a swing: “Good shot, Judy!” It became a funny family warble among the Cahoons – and as it turns out, a solid band name, too.\n\nOr perhaps that moment of creation arrived when Good Shot Judy freed their potential energy. Keen to give the classic melodies the respect and attention – as well as the power – that it deserved, the Cahoons filled out Good Shot Judy with a full complement of horns, percussion and vocals. And magic happened: an ensemble that was bigger than the sum of its parts.\n\nIn a sense, Good Shot Judy was already in the stars long ago, during those formative decades from the 1930s on, when small jazz combos, big brass bands and the crooners who sang on top of them were forging an enduring style and repertoire that would be written into the DNA of American music.\n\nBut really, all these had a hand in making Good Shot Judy what is today: a big amp jazz band that sets stages aflame nationwide.\n\nAudiences may never consider that the Good Shot Judy show they’re seeing has been an evolution. They’re too captivated by the sound and spectacle of music that reaches through the time. They’re too caught up in performance that has one foot dancing in the past and one in the here and now.\n\nA Good Shot Judy show offers all those tunes you know just from growing up in America – songs you can at least hum along to, if you don’t outright know most of the words. But the music itself is only part of the band’s allure; there’s something electric in the execution, and it’s that vigor that carries the day as much as the pull of recognition.\n\nSo, yeah, there’s a history. And it’s a big one. Bigger than any one person. Bigger than any one band, for that matter. But Good Shot Judy is as close as it comes to an intersection between an era’s defining sound and the pleasure of enjoying it the way it was meant to be heard.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Prince Project\n\nDoors 7 PM / Show 8 PM\n\n$27.00 - $30.00\n\nDrusky Entertainment Presents : The Prince Project\n\nThe HOTTEST Prince & The Revolution Tribute Band in America!\n\nCostumes, lights, signature sights and sounds straight out of 1984!
