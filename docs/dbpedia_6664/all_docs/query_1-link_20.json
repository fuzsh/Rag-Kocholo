        "text": "I’m Toby. I’m a writer. A dad. A husband. A record collector. A movie geek (especially if the movies are old and people get hurt in them). And I really really wish I had a hot rod.\n\nOn the writer front, I’m researching and writing a book on 50s Westerns, maybe my favorite film (sub)genre. When it’s finally done, it’ll be called 50 Westerns From The 50s.\n\nI wanted to chronicle the book’s progress and have a place to stick some of the cool images and quotes and stuff I’ve come across. Hence this blog. Over time it’s evolved into a bit of a hitching post for related news and some pretty insightful discussion from various readers — I like to just sit back and watch the sparks fly.\n\nFeels like I tossed y’a ll a ball and you ran with it a very, very long way. You certainly saw more potential in this than I did. And I’m sure thankful to you all for it.\n\nI’ve written a book on the making of Marlon Brando’s One-Eyed Jacks, a movie I went Wig City over when it turned up on the afternoon movie a long time ago. It started out as a chapter in the 50s Westerns book (the 50s Western that wasn’t released till 1961), but screamed to be set out on its own. It’s called A Million Feet Of Film: The Making Of One-Eyed Jacks. I was honored to help out with the picture’s DVD and Blu-Ray release from The Criterion Collection. I did a “video essay” on the film’s production history, basically boiling my book down to 23 minutes.\n\nSome DVD and Blu-Ray commentaries have come my way, too: Night Of The Grizzly (1966) from Olive Films; Bar 20 Rides Again (1935) for ClassicFlix; The Long Riders (1980) from Imprint; Dakota (1945), Sunset In The West (1950), The Indian Fighter (1955), The Man Who Died Twice (1958), Singing Guns (1950), The Covered Wagon (1926), Bend Of The River (1952), The Spoilers (1942), Canyon Passage (1946), Border River (1954), Man Without A Star (1955), Quantez (1957), Night Passage (1957), Ride A Crooked Trail (1958), Dragnet (1954), Charley Varrick (1973) and more from Kino Lorber; Chicago Syndicate (1955) from Indicator/Powerhouse; and One Million BC (1940) from VCI.\n\nPreparing for one these things is a lot of work, but it sure is fun.\n\nThanks for passing through.\n\nToby\n\n__________\n\nThe top photo is Brownie and me (I’m armed with a Mattel Shootin’ Shell Winchester, the Lone Ranger model, I think), taken around 1967-68. The more recent picture below it was taken in the projection booth of Raleigh’s Rialto Theater by James Graham. That projector was later given the digital eviction."
