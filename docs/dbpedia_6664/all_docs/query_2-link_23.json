        "text": "Lesbian Singers\n\nMy three passions (equally) are:\n\nMusic, Movies and Fashion!\n\nThough I had crushes on female singers, oddly when sussing out who I was, I didn't seek Sapphic lyrics unlike movies. I didn't sing out loud and proud to Katy Perry's kitschville city, \"I kissed a girl, and I liked it\", perhaps tarnished by marketed, faux lesbians = t.A.T.u.. My beecharming slick mixtapes were... New Order, St Etienne, Coldplay, The Smiths, Erasure, The Killers, Hot Chip, The xx, [STOPPPP ME!], with a mix of slit-your-wrist operatic arias, old-skool blues and whimsical Cole Porter.\n\nYet, when some of my music heroes came out as queer / bi e.g. ...\n\n... Pete Shelley of the Buzzcocks, Andy Bell of Erasure, Morrisey, Pet Shop Boys - inside I was so dancing with J.O.Y! Seldomly, I heard about female singers coming out - wowhoo to Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes (What's Up), Joan Jett, and the new kids on the block. For me it's not about Sapphic lyrics but it would be ace to see for example female singers taking their girl to award ceremonies, mentioning them in interviews, so it just becomes a norm.\n\nDefinitely, there were some surprises while collating this list!\n\nThe Sapphic Blues Singers\n\nDuring this research I was stunned to discover that some of the queens of blues were friends of Dorothy and had lady lovers. This pose of bi and lesbian singers included Ma Rainey, who got arrested for indecency at an all-girl party while married to a man, Gladys Bentley, a \"bulldagger\" in full white tuxedo and top hat, and less overt Alberta Hunter, Bessie Smith and Ethel Waters. Their costumes were lavish and lyrics, sometimes sexually suggestive to the point of being dirtier than the dirtiest modern rapper! For example, Lucille Bogan bellows: \"I've got nipples on my titties as big as the end of my thumb/ Got somethin' 'tween my legs'll make a dead man come!\".\n\nI so want to see Robert Philipson's documentary \"T'Ain't Nobody's Bizness: Queer Blues\" (2011). At first I was shocked on reading that Gladys Bentley \"changed\" her sexual orientation and revealed this through an Ebony magazine interview. It was during, 50s America with The Lavender Scare and McCarthyism. I also take it with a pinch of salt, as some say, she was a PR queen, ahead of her time! Check out Singing the Lesbian Blues in 1920s Harlem\n\nThe Sapphic Cabaret Singers\n\nBeing half German, I am fascinated by the Weimer cabaret scene of the jazz age but it was surprising to learn how singers differently reacted to the Nazis regime. The great Marlene Dietrich refused to return to Berlin to star in Nazi propaganda movies and from America helped fund Jews and French dissidents escape from Germany to America also performing in morale-boosting shows for Allied troops abroad while Josephine Baker gallantly risked her life as a French resistance agent. Both deservedly received a French LÃ©gion d'honneur. The bad: French cabaret singer and \"the most painted woman in the world\" Suzy Solidor was convicted by the Ãpuration lÃ©gale as a collaborator and was exiled from France. Swedish actress Zarah Leander consciously moved to Berlin and starred in ten UFA films which were vehicles for Goebbels' despicable Nazi propaganda. Check out Lesbian experiences under the Nazi Regime and Lesbians who defied the Nazis.\n\nThe Totally Left Field!\n\nMaxene Andrews of the legendary harmony group Andrews Sisters lover was her adopted daughter! At first I was astounded to discover this but then my heart-missed-a-beat as to why. At the time same sex marriages were illegal. Bizarrely by adoption her life long partner would be able to sign healthcare documents for when Maxene was badly ill in hospital and ensure she would receive her rightful inheritance.\n\nMarlene Dietrich\n\nGerman-American Singer & Actress: 1901 - 1992\n\nIn the 1930 movie Morrocco, a tuxedo-clad Dietrich gave cinema and, us, one of the first on-screen lesbian kisses. Femme fatale... more\n\n... Marlene Dietrich is an iconic German-American actress and singer. Her performance as Lola-Lola in Josef von Sternberg's The Blue Angel (1930) in which he sings \"Falling in Love Again\" and which became her signature song, brought her international acclaim and a contract with Paramount Pictures in America. She became one of the highest-paid actresses of the time featuring in classics like Shanghai Express (1932) and The Devil Is a Woman (1935). The American Film Institute named Dietrich the ninth greatest female screen legend of classic Hollywood cinema, in 1999. Dietrich was renowned for attending underground drag balls and queer revues in 1920s Weimer Berlin and once declared \"I am, at heart, a gentleman\". Refering to the closeted lesbian and bi-sexual scene in Hollywood, of which she was a prominent a member, she coined the phrase \"sewing circle\". She had an affair with Mercedes de Acosta (a poet, playwright, and novelist and another key member of the \"sewing circle\". Did she or didn't she have a love affair with fellow actress Greta Garbo and the singer Edith Piaf? That is the question!\n\nIn interviews Dietrich said that while in London filming Knight Without Armour (1937), she was approached by Nazi Party officials and offered lucrative contracts to return to Germany to be the foremost film star in the Third Reich. In the sanctuary of London, she refused their offers and in 1937, applied for U.S. citizenship, renouncing her German citizenship.\n\nWith Billy Wilder (a legendary Austrian Jewish Director who had escaped to France then America) and several other exiles, in the late 1930s, they created a fund to help Jews and French dissidents escape from Germany, house them, provide financial support and even advocate their American citizenship. It is In 1937, her entire salary for Knight Without Armor (reportedly $450,000) was put into escrow to help the refugees and she opened her home in America to German and French exiles during World War II.\n\nOn America's entry to WWII, Dietrich became one of the first public figures to help sell American war bonds and was reported to have sold more war bonds than any other star. Between 1944 and 1945, she performed in morale-boosting shows for Allied troops in Algeria, Italy, the UK, France, and Heerlen in the Netherlands, and entered Germany with Generals James M. Gavin and George S. Patton.\n\nDietrich also worked with the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S.), the predecessor of today's CIA, to record a series of anti-Nazi albums, using propaganda to weaken the morale of Nazi troops. The broadcasts of these songs and interviews, sent over German airwaves, were meant to create tension between the Axis Powers (the military alliance of Germany, Italy and Japan who fought in World War II against the Allies). After the war Dietrich deservedly received the Medal of Freedom in 1947, for her \"extraordinary record entertaining troops overseas during the war\" and was also awarded the LÃ©gion d'Honneur by the French government for her wartime work.\n\nless\n\nTrack for Mummy & Daddy (Scottish Officer): ❤ Lili Marleen (1944)\n\nJosephine Baker\n\nAfrican-American Singer & Performer: 1906 - 1975\n\nJosephine Baker, a.k.a \"Black Venus\", the \"Black Pearl\", was a hugely popular African-American entertainer in Europe particularly in her adopted home of France, French Resistance... more\n\n... agent and civil rights activist. Her life is so incredible I couldn't keep her bio short! Being billed as \"the highest-paid chorus girl in vaudeville\" landed Baker an opportunity to tour in Paris. Swiftly, she became the toast of Paris and an iconic image and a symbol of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties, appearing practically nude onstage in her self-designed costume comprising short skirt of artificial bananas and a beaded necklace. Among her various performance accolades Josephine became the first Black woman to star in a major motion picture, the silent film Siren of the Tropics (1927).\n\nThough she was married four times she had many lesbian affairs. Co-author and an unofficial adopted son, Jean-Claude Baker's biography \"Josephine: The Hungry Heart\" mentions six of her lady lovers: Bessie Allison (a performer who later became the first African-American woman to hold a seat in the New York State Legislature, Clara Smith ( \"Queen of the Moaners\"), and actresses Evelyn Sheppard, and Mildred Smallwood, all of whom she met on the black performing circuit during her early years onstage in the United States and when she relocated to Paris: expat jazz singer Ada \"Bricktop\" Smith, and the French novelist Colette. Perhaps her most famous of her lovers, was Mexican artist Frida Kahlo who she during Kahlo's trip to Paris in 1939. Awkwardly, Frieda Kahlo was travelling with her husband, muralist Diego Rivera.\n\nWhen WWII broke out, and Paris was occupied by the Third Reich, Josephine was recruited by French Resistance. Taking advantage of the occupiersâ trust, she risked her life on clandestine work for the Allies. Her celebrity and fame opened doors, and in social gatherings she rubbed shoulders with and charmed high ranking Nazi personnel, and officials to collect information.\n\nTo boot, as an international entertainer, she had an excuse to travel which she did within Nazi-occupied Europe, to neutral Portugal, and to South America. Risking her life, courageously, Josephine smuggled coded messages, written in invisible ink on her music sheets, between the French Resistance and the Allies. The messages contained crucial military intelligence about for example German troop concentrations, airfields, harbours, and defences. If this wasn't enough, she also heroically hid fugitives in her home, supplying them with forged identification papers and visas obtained through her clandestine contacts. Commissioned as a lieutenant, later in the war, she joined the French Women's Auxiliary Air Force and preformed shows for Allied troops to keep their spirits up. An utter heroine. After Frances liberation, she returned to Paris in October 1944, she was greeted by throngs of people on the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es welcoming her home. In recognition of her wartime heroics, she deservedly was awarded the Croix de guerre (Medal of Resistance ) by the French military, and eventually she was named a Chevalier of the LÃ©gion d'Honneur by General Charles de Gaulle.\n\nWhy did Paris and France become her home? When she would return to America she was continuously greeted with racism. In one example, in the 1950s her husband and herself were refused reservations at 36 hotels because of racial discrimination. Over the years she gave talks on the subject of racism, challenged segregation laws and marched for civil rights with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the historic March on Washington in 1963. She was so vociferous in her denunciations of American racism at various international forums that she ended up on the FBI watch list and lost her US citizenship rights for over a decade.\n\nless\n\nTres chic Track: La Vie En Rose (1969)\n\nMaxene Andrews of the Andrews Sisters\n\nSwing Singer: 1916 - 1995\n\nMaxene Anglyn was the middle sister of The Andrews Sisters who were an American close silky smooth harmony group and icons of the swing and boogie-woogie eras. Selling... more\n\n... over 100 million records, they had forty-six top ten hits and a dozen number-ones which include \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\" and \"Don't Fence Me In\" with crooner Bing Crosby and They also performed with nearly all of the major big bands of the era, including those led by Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman... They are also remembered very fondly for entertaining the Allied forces in Africa, and Italy, as well as in the U.S., visiting Army, Navy, Marine, and Coast Guard bases, hospitals, and munitions factories, during WWII.\n\nIn 1941, Maxene married Lou Levy, a music publisher and the Andrew Sisters' manager from 1937 to 1951, and they adopted two children but amicably divorced eight years later. Thereafter Maxene entered a thirteen-year relationship with a woman. Then she met Lynda Wells via Lynda's parents who had been friends of the Andrews Sisters. Utterly stranger than fiction: Lynda Wells became Maxene's manager, adopted daughter, and... her lover and longtime companion and both became born again Christians. Yep, you read that right!\n\nFrom a transcript of an interview with Lynda Wells: \"Maxene had her major heart attack in Northwestern Hospital in Chicago and darn near died and they thought I was her daughter and had to sign all these rights and things for them to do these medical procedures to save her life, and I had no authority to do that. We didn't have a living will at that time. She hadn't been sick.\" On hearing this their friend Carol Hampton (a Christian) \"took me and Maxene by the hand and took us out on the street where they lived and knocked on the door of... an attorney friend of hers, and she said, \"This one needs to adopt this one... Within three weeks I was her daughter, which made life a very strange kind of...\" This poignantly highlights how awful it must have been for same sex partners in situations such as healthcare and lovingly wishing to pass on their inheritance to their partner. Bravo to Lynda Wells for revealing this.\n\nless\n\nBoogie Track: Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (1941)\n\nDusty Springfield\n\nEnglish Pop Singer: 1939 â 1999\n\nDusty Springfield was an iconic figure of the Swinging Sixties. She was one of the best-selling UK singers of the 1960s and made one of the biggest impressions... more\n\n... on the US market scoring 18 singles in the Billboard Hot 100. Her swinging solo career began in 1963 with the upbeat pop beat hit \"I Only Want to Be with You\" and \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\" (1966), and \"Son of a Preacher Man\" (1968). Bravo to the Pet Shop Boys who gave her career a renaissance in the late 80's with \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\" and \"In Private\".\n\nAmong her countless accolades, Dusty received an OBE, given for \"services to popular music\" in 1999 and posthumously was inducted to both the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999) and the UK Music Hall of Fame (2006), and received a Grammy Hall of Fame award in 2001.\n\nIn the swinging sixties fun-loving hedonism flourished, yet any suggestion of non-normative sexuality was considered career suicide. In 1970, just one year after the Stonewall Riots during an interview with Ray Connolly of the London Evening Standard, she told him: \"A lot of people say that I'm bent, and I've heard it so many times that I've almost learned to accept it. I know Iâm perfectly capable of being swayed by a girl as by a boy. More and more, people feel that way and I don't see why I shouldn't.\"\n\nDusty was linked to many women during her life, including in the late 1960s and early '70s, Norma Tanega, a California-born singer-songwriter who wrote a few of Springfieldâs songs such as \"Go My Love\", photojournalist Faye Harris and Toronto-based singer Carole Pope. In 1982, while in recovery, Dusty met Teda Bracci, an American actress and although gay marriage was not yet legal, the two were wed in California (26 years before same-sex marriage became legalised in California - June 16, 2008). They lived together for two years, before parting ways.\n\nless\n\nSlick Track: Pet Shop Boys & Dusty Springfield What Have I Done To Deserve This (1987)"
