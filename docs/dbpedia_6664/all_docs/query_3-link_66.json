        "text": "Not too long ago, we had a big ‘clean-up’ day at our house. Like a lot of people, we had collected too much clutter and needed to purge our house of all of the junk and random things that were just laying around, collecting dust. None of us were looking forward to it. I ended up being assigned the oh-so-much super fun role of cleaning out the random draws in our house. As I went through the seemingly endless odds and ins we had for some reason decided to save over the years, I made a discovery! A discovery that immediately ended my drawer duties, much to my wife’s frustration. In one of the drawers, tucked away for over 15 years, I found 6 disposable cameras! I had no idea they were there! My wife barely remembered putting them in the draw, but now could not remember what was on the cameras. For a photography and film nerd like myself, finding old disposable cameras or old film is like finding a treasure chest. Who knows what memories and images could have been taken. I was beyond excited!\n\nMany of you have come across old disposable cameras as you’ve cleaned. Maybe they were yours, or maybe they belonged to one of your kids, or maybe another family member, but regardless, once they are found the question arises: “Can you develop old disposable cameras?”\n\nCan You Still Develop Old Disposable Cameras?\n\nThe short and simple answer is yes, you can still develop them! The real question is, will we get any viewable images out of our old disposable cameras? And to answer that question, we’re going to have to consider a number of factors.\n\nWhat can damage photographic film?\n\nHow film works is nothing short of a miracle. Silver bromide and dyes and other layers are applied to a thin film that when it works together are light sensitive and can even display color! There are so many chemical and physical aspects to film, but we don’t want to get too deep here. Let’s discuss the big issues. Heat is one of the biggest things that can damage the film. I’ve developed disposable cameras that have lived in the trunk of a person’s car for several years. Let me tell you, those images were a disaster. The images I was able to salvage had extremely distorted colors and the worst graininess I’ve ever seen. Most of the contrast was washed away also. The images reminded me of being a kid in the 1980s trying to get reception on a certain TV station only to be able to barely get a signal. You could tell there was something there, but not clearly enough to have usable to viewable images.\n\nBesides heat, moisture can have a huge effect on the film. It is possible that moisture in the form of condensation can build up on the inside of the canister even (inside of the disposable camera). Moisture inside of the canister can damage the emulsion or cause abnormal effects with the film itself. Heat and moisture are the enemies of exposed film! But there are ways to battle heat and moisture. Exposed film has two more enemies that cannot be prevented.\n\nOne of those enemies is gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is all around us, causing issues all the time, but the older undeveloped film gets, the more it is affected by gamma radiation. According to Kodak, gamma radiation has an effect on the image effectiveness of the film, but it mostly increases the appearance of grain and fog in the image. The older the film gets, the grainier it is going to become. I’ve developed some films that are 20 to 30 years old and have terrible amounts of grain that really begin to distract from the image.\n\nThe other issue that drastically affects older undeveloped disposable cameras is the natural order of the energy and the chemistry that makes the film work. Essentially capturing photons in the form of electrons in silver-bromide, during the development process those molecules are transformed into fixed silver which creates an image. Until the film is developed, you actually don’t have an image on the film. Rather, it is a latent image made up of captured energy. And like all prisoners, that energy just wants to escape. Over long periods of time enough can escape to really degrade the quality of your image.\n\nHow I can slow this natural decay?\n\nStoring your Disposable Cameras in the fridge helps! Keeping the film cold prevents those electrons from breaking free and making a run for it. But even cold storage will not delay decay for long. Most exposed films need to be developed within 6 months of shooting. Any time after 6 months, your images are going to start to break down. Now, don’t get me wrong, this is a very slow process. Disposable cameras that are 2 years old won’t be that bad. Disposable cameras that are 22 years old however will begin to look kinda bad. And to add to the issues, most manufacturers were not putting the best quality film in disposable cameras in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Kodak Disposable Cameras and Fuji Disposable Cameras generally hold up ok. But store brands and other off brands do not. And if you purchased cameras that were refurbished in china (most Etsy wedding cameras are of this type), those go really fast because they use really really a low-quality film stock.\n\nThe bottom line is if you want the best possible images from your disposable camera, store them in a cool dry place and get them developed as soon as possible!\n\nWhat will the Images from My Old Disposable Camera Look Like?\n\nSo ok, you didn’t do any of the things above and you’re like us and have had these disposable cameras just sitting in a draw for years needing to be developed. What are your images going to look like?\n\nThe pictures from your old disposable camera are more than likely going to exhibit three traits. The first trait is decreased contrast. Your image will appear flatter with a less noticeable difference between the highlights and the shadow."
