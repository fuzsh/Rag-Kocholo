        "text": "In the opening scenes of Hidden Figures, released in the UK on Friday, we are introduced to Dorothy Vaughan – played with verve and wit by Octavia Spencer – as a pair of legs sticking out from under the bonnet of a broken-down car. One detail immediately stands out: Vaughan’s legs are light beige and shiny. She is wearing stockings that don’t match her skin tone, presumably because that was all that was available to her.\n\nAlthough the scene goes on to establish the deep racism of the time in more direct ways, the small detail of the stockings tries to put viewers in the shoes of someone like Vaughan. It reminds us how these women were made to feel like outsiders in their own country in small and large ways, even as they helped the nation succeed on the global stage.\n\nIn writing history, the devil is always in the details. Margot Shetterly’s groundbreaking book, Hidden Figures, reorients our view of the space race by telling the stories of Nasa’s black women mathematicians. It casts them as protagonists in the grand drama of American technological history rather than mere details. But the film based on Shetterly’s book straddles the line between allowing these women to be the protagonists of their story and crowding them out of the spotlight. The bravura performances of Taraji P. Henson (who plays Katherine Johnson), Janelle Monáe (who plays Mary Jackson), and Octavia Spencer are hindered by the film’s framing.\n\nThe film follows Vaughan, Johnson, and Jackson as they work feverishly on the calculations for the launch and re-entry of John Glenn’s 1962 mission as the first American to orbit the Earth. In the early 1960s, the US was falling behind the Soviets in the space race: already the USSR had launched the first satellite and put the first person into orbit. By the time of Glenn’s orbit, the US was desperate for a win in the space race, and – by extension – the Cold War.\n\nAs the women race to complete the needed calculations, Johnson is promoted, owing to her exceptional mathematical talent. While this makes her into the film’s hero, it also puts her into direct contact with many of the white, male Nasa engineers who see her as a black woman first and only secondarily as a person and coworker. At this point, Nasa manager Al Harrison, played by Kevin Costner, comes into the frame.\n\nDespite being an amalgam of three different Nasa employees, Harrison somehow seems to do no actual work. Perhaps this is a subtle satire of the management class, but it also means his character simply takes up space in someone else’s story. Costner is shoehorned into the story as the white male hero who lifts the women up. The role is problematic, uncritically centring an unremarkable white man in a story about three brilliant black women, and the decision to cast a well-known star steals focus from the female leads. Other men in the film manage to support the main characters without stealing the limelight, like the Jewish émigré who supports Jackson’s attempts to get the certification she needed to become the first black woman at Nasa to hold the title of engineer. Harrison’s character, meanwhile, is an unfortunate meta-commentary on Hollywood’s continued reliance on racist and sexist storytelling tropes that weakens the film and its message.\n\nHenson, Monáe, and Spencer shine in their roles when given the space to do so. Spencer’s Vaughan engages with the most important of technological advances in a way that shows her brilliance and foresight. That technology is not the space capsule, but Nasa’s new IBM computer. Vaughan sees the writing on the wall for her section of women “computers” with the arrival of a machine designed to make their jobs unnecessary. Instead of fighting the change she immediately warms to the new machine, learning to program in FORTRAN without being asked and getting the women she supervises to make themselves indispensable to the coming technological regime by becoming early computer experts.\n\nIn the end, Hidden Figures is an often uplifting film with problematic elements and myopic framing. None of those problems are present in Shetterly’s book, which deftly moves between talking about people and institutions in ways that make the book both a joy to read and an instruction manual for other historians writing the history of technology. Unlike the book, the film tells a straightforward, simplistic story, and does so with rather plodding pacing and humdrum cinematography.\n\nIt also leaves unresolved the tension between what the women are doing and the reasons they’re doing it. In the film, there’s no discussion of the problematic fact that these talented women are submerged in the process of helping the US fight a Cold War designed to extend American political hegemony – the same structure that has subjugated them and their loved ones. As Shetterly puts it in her book:\n\nSo much money spent so that ... a dozen white men could take the express train to a lifeless world? Negro women and men could barely go to the next state without worrying about predatory police, restaurants that refused to serve them, and service stations that wouldn’t let them buy gas or use the bathroom.\n\nThough the film inserts a few scenes that hint at the indignity and terror of living as a black woman in the Jim Crow South, it oddly keeps racism at arms length from a narrative that, without it, would never have existed.\n\nOverall, Hidden Figures is an enjoyable but limited film, despite excellent performances from its female leads. Shetterly’s book focuses on the lives of remarkable people who, up to now, have been ignored because they were women and because they were black. It shows why they were important while allowing them to remain human. The film takes the stories of three of these women and gives them the Hollywood treatment. It tries to be a feel-good movie about a historical period in which black people were often brutally denied their civil rights, and it lionizes a problematic technological proxy war. Disappointingly, the film hides the details that are most meaningful and instructive as we face an era of renewed international turmoil, misguided technological utopianism, and resurgent racism."
