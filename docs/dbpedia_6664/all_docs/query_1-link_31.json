        "text": "Time has lost all meaning. What is a weekend? How long will the vestiges of taking stock of the last \"work week\" or weekend of new movies on a Sunday last only because that's when we used to take stock of things in the pre-pandemic world? At any rate... how is your movie or TV watching these days? Tell us in the comments, won'cha? I'll share two of my own screening adventures after the jump...\n\nThis week, in need of comfort I watched a handful of episodes of The Dick Van Dyke Show on Hulu (1961-1967) which I'd never seen before. It's so funny so the 'classic' status is deserved. Mary Tyler Moore is a charming young treasure and Van Dyke does expert slapstick. It's fascinating to see the tropes of the marital AND the family AND the workplace sitcoms all experiencing their embryonic and/or toddler phases simultaneously (I Love Lucy and Leave it To Beaver preceded this).\n\nFor movies I'd already finished 2005 screenings so I'm on to 1938 (which will be the September smackdown). I screened both Adventures of Robin Hood (which, more on later) on HBO Max and The Cowboy and the Lady (which I'd never heard of) on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe latter is a romantic comedy starring Gary Cooper and Merle Oberon as the titular couple and it was up for three Oscars (score, original song, and an Oscar win for sound recording). Today's critics, obsessed as they are with 2020 points of view and unable to adjust when looking at earlier art, would be horrified at the normcore sexism and blatant deceit upon which the romance is based (Oberon continually lies to Cooper to win his heart and this is viewed primarily for comedy, at least at first) but it's a decent romantic comedy and sexy, too. The always breathtakingly handsome Cooper is quite funny in a chill way and Merle is... well, she sure is beautiful! 1930s screen kissing can be hit and miss given that faces just press together but Oberon and Cooper have good chemistry.\n\nThe film was shot by the masterful Gregg Toland and I only wish this were a good print since his cinematography is usually stunning. There's one surprisingly suggestive scene in the fog; these two badly want to get naked. It was probably ravishing to look at in 1938!\n\nI've been binge-watching Friends and What We Do in the Shadows. At this point, they are comfort food that I just cannot get enough of.\n\nMovie-wise, I'm a little behind with the times so I'm just getting around to 1991. I revisited Thelma and Louise, The Silence of the Lambs, Frankie and Johnny, and Boyz N the Hood (for the first time and WOW). Too hard for me to pick between Sarandon, Davis, Foster, and Pfeiffer.\n\nP.S. So strange to think of all the many roles Pfeiffer turned down that would eventually be Oscar nominated or statued. Would she have won if she had taken on Clarice Starling or even Celeste Boyle? For the latter, she would have had the benefit of being considered snubbed the previous year for White Oleander so that might have propelled her over Zellweger towards the podium. (OK, I obviously have too much time on my hands to overthink what-if scenarios)\n\nI saw The Painted Bird. Well that's 3 hours (ok 2 hours and 49 minutes) of my life I'll never get back. Who were the dolts who walked out on it? Were they paid by the distributor to stir up a \"controversy\"? Because this is the most boring movie I've seen in a long, long while. And those atrocities - nothing anyone who's seen the average Nicolas Cage or Liam Neeson film couldn't handle, not to mention the bloodbaths coming from the Far East. Even the eye-gouging was relatively restrained. The photography is tremendous (and we all go to movies to look at the cinematography, right?) and the little kid was very impressive. I wouldn't call it acting, exactly, but he brings just the right quality to the role. That's it for the positives. A bore is a bore is a bore, a pretentious bore is a pretentious bore is a pretentious bore and an ultra-pretentious bore is The Painted Bird.\n\nWhen we watch a movie that we absolutely love, isn't that also \"x\" amount of minutes of our life we'll never get back? Do I get some sort of time travel refund for watching PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE a year ago, because it's about time (no pun intended) I cash that in! I've never understood the machinations of that phrase. :-)\n\nAnyway...... cinemas are open here (albeit limited, but roll on TENET for the end of the month!). I watched:\n\n- UNHINGED (an uncomfortable hark back to 80s and 90 thrillers. It's not bad, but the elements of nasty violence and funny violence melded together like water and screwdrivers. And Crowe's character is certainly no Alex Forrest or Max Cady...),\n\n- 23 WALKS (not as connected to movies like WEEKEND and the BEFORE... trilogy as the promotion material and title had led me to believe, but still quite a nice ode to elder romance),\n\n- MY DAYS OF GLORY (a solid French comedy film about not dealing with depression - a lot of parallels with BRIDESMAIDS) and\n\n- THE VIGIL (my first delve into the subgenre of \"Jewish religious horror\", I believe. Not perfect, but a decent first feature for the writer-director.)\n\nMy television comfort food for the moment is \"Letterkenny\". I can't believe how much I haven't heard about this wonderfully funny series around the websites I regularly read (including this one) - for me it's the funniest series of the past decade, and ever since I accidentally stumbled across it about a year ago, I have been getting friends hooked as well!"
