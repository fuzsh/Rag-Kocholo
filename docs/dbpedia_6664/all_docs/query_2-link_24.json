        "text": "Images of indigenous people, often depicting them in negative stereotypes, have long circulated through various forms of mass media. Familiar images of drums, traditional dress, brave warriors, and half-naked, dancing people wearing feathers and buckskin reinforce the idea that indigenous people are radically different from mainstream society. Many Hollywood films, TV series, fashion shows, and advertisements perpetuate these stereotypes, even though they have very little to do with the ways contemporary (or even historical) indigenous people dress, work, think, and act. Neither do daily news items reflect a realistic picture. “Research shows,” says media scholar Duncan McCue, “that reports from Indigenous communities tend to follow extremely narrow guidelines based on pre-existing stereotypes of .”\n\nIn the following poem, Thomas King explores the difference between images and stereotypes of indigenous people and how these people actually live their lives in contemporary Canada. King is a photographer, a two-time Governor General’s Literary Award nominee, a radio broadcaster, a poet, and a professor emeritus of English at the University of Guelph.\n\nThe portrayal of the fictional Native American character Tonto in the 1930s radio show and 1950s television adaption The Lone Ranger fulfilled many of the negative stereotypes in North American popular culture about Native American and Indigenous people.\n\nI’m Not the Indian You Had in Mind\n\nI’m not the Indian you had in mind\n\nI’ve seen him\n\nOh, I’ve seen him ride,\n\na rush of wind, a darkening tide\n\nwith Wolf and Eagle by his side\n\nhis buttocks firm and well defined\n\nmy god, he looks good from behind\n\nBut I’m not the Indian you had in mind.\n\nI’m not the Indian you had in mind\n\nI’ve heard him\n\nOh, I’ve heard him roar,\n\nthe warrior wild, the video store\n\nthe movies that we all adore\n\nthe clichés that we can’t rewind,\n\nBut I’m not the Indian you had in mind.\n\nI’m not the Indian you had in mind\n\nI’ve known him\n\nOh, I’ve known him well,\n\nthe bear-greased hair, the pungent smell\n\nthe piercing eye, the startling yell\n\nthank God that he’s the friendly kind,\n\nBut I’m not the Indian you had in mind.\n\nI’m that other one.\n\nThe one who lives just down the street.\n\nthe one you’re disinclined to meet\n\nthe Oka guy, remember me?\n\nIpperwash? Wounded Knee?\n\nThat other Indian.\n\nthe one who runs the local bar\n\nthe CEO, the movie star,\n\nthe elder with her bingo tales\n\nthe activist alone in jail\n\nThat other Indian.\n\nThe doctor, the homeless bum\n\nthe boys who sing around the drum\n\nthe relative I cannot bear\n\nmy father who was never there\n\nhe must have hated me, I guess\n\nmy best friend’s kid with FAS\n\nthe single mum who drives the bus\n\nI’m all of these and they are us.\n\nSo damn you for the lies you’ve told\n\nand damn me for not being bold\n\nenough to stand my ground\n\nand say\n\nthat what you’ve done is not our way\n\nBut, in the end the land won’t care\n\nwhich one was rabbit, which one was bear\n\nwho did the deed and who did not\n\nwho did the shooting, who got shot\n\nwho told the truth, who told the lie\n\nwho drained the lakes and rivers dry\n\nwho made us laugh, who made us sad\n\nwho made the world Monsanto mad\n\nwhose appetites consumed the earth,\n\nit wasn’t me, for what it’s worth.\n\nOr maybe it was.\n\nBut hey, let’s not get too distressed\n\nit’s not as bad as it might sound\n\nhell, we didn’t make this mess.\n\nIt was given us\n\nand when we’re gone\n\nas our parents did\n\nwe’ll pass it on.\n\nYou see?\n\nI’ve learned your lessons well\n\nwhat to buy, what to sell\n\nwhat’s commodity, what’s trash\n\nwhat discount you can get for cash\n\nAnd Indians, well, we’ll still be here\n\nthe Real One and the rest of us\n\nwe’ve got no other place to go\n\ndon’t worry, we won’t make a fuss\n\nWell, not much.\n\nThough sometimes, sometimes late at night\n\nwhen all the world is warm and dead\n\nI wonder how things might have been\n\nhad you followed, had we led.\n\nSo consider as you live your days\n\nthat we live ours under the gaze\n\nof generations watching us\n\nof generations still intact\n\nof generations still to be\n\nseven forward, seven back.\n\nYeah, it’s not easy.\n\nCourse you can always go ask that brave you like so much\n\nthe Indian you idolize\n\nperhaps that’s wisdom on his face\n\ncompassion sparkling in his eyes.\n\nHe may well have a secret song\n\na dance he’ll share, a long-lost chant\n\nask him to help you save the world\n\nto save yourselves.\n\nDon’t look at me.\n\nI’m not the Indian you had in mind.\n\nI can’t.\n\nI can’t."
