        "text": "First you should activate the \"thorough rinsing\" option on your machine (if it has one). Modern washing machines seem to be manufactured mostly for the ads and less for the actual washing they're supposed to do. \"Saving water\" sounds good in ads, but if a washing machine rinses your clothes in too little water, there'll be residue of detergent or lint left in your clothes. Most machines give you an option to either use more water during the rinsing step or to insert an additional rinsing into the cycle.\n\nThen you should read the service manual of your machine and do all the maintenance steps it describes. Those usually include cleaning lint filters. Be sure to have some old or dirty towels at hand because there might be some leaking water.\n\nIf that's done, let the machine run a cycle empty to clean the insides of it. Since you usually wash at hot temperatures, bacteria are not a concern and a short cycle should be sufficient to rinse dirt out.\n\nAnd lastly you should check that you're not accidently intoducing the lint or dust by:\n\nUsing powdered detergent. Try liquid detergent for a change and see if the problem improves.\n\nThe favorite shirt or bath robe that is decades old and threadbare. Cotton fibers crumble after a lot of use, which would explain your lint problem. Conciously leave all old and much used clothes out and see if the problem is as bad as with those items.\n\nUsing too much detergent for the amount of laundry. Please read the recommendations on the packaging and your local water providers data concerning mineral content (water hardness). Most detergents do contain water softeners, but if your water is very hard, you should add a little extra water softener instead of adding more detergent. Too much detergent can damage the fibers, which in turn leads to more lint.\n\nthe most likely answer is your dryer air duct outlet is closed or blocked off. I had this problem in a house I once lived in and got so frustrated that I searched for and found the dryer duct vent on the outside of the house. It had been blocked closed when the house was painted years earlier and never opened back up again.\n\nSome dryer ducts are supposed to close themselves by gravity when the dryer is not running, to prevent cold air from getting inside the house through the dryer ducts. All it takes is a small amount of dirt & lint to jam the flap hinge shut, and then the dryer won't vent and the lint & dust stays on your clothes.\n\nA blocked vent will also mean your clothes will take an unusually long time to dry."
