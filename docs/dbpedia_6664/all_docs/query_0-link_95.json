        "text": "Revealed last month, the Golden Globe nominations more than likely raised eyebrows, elicited smiles, provoked head-scratching or generated a gag reflex, depending on your opinion.\n\nThe awards, which will be bestowed Sunday night, will likely produce similar reactions.\n\nYours truly performed all of the above with slightly more gagging and head-scratching than eyebrow-raising and smiling. Making predictions in categories where many of the candidates don't deserve a snow globe let alone a Golden Globe should be challenging, but we'll persevere nonetheless.\n\nTo quote Rob Schneider, \"Once more into the breech, dear friends.\" Or maybe that was Shakespeare. I always confuse the two.\n\nFor brevity's sake, we'll only discuss the major film categories. I also don't know anything about television since I curbed my obsessive viewing in 1970. Is \"Gunsmoke\" still on?\n\nThe nominees for Best Drama are \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\" \"Frost/Nixon,\" \"The Reader,\" \"Revolutionary Road,\" \"Slumdog Millionaire\" and \"The Visitor.\"\n\nFew complaints here, though I would have substituted the grade-A \"Milk\" for the dusty \"Revolutionary Road\" and \"The Dark Knight\" for \"The Curious Case.\" If \"Slumdog Millionaire\" doesn't win, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which bestows the awards, should have their visas revoked.\n\nThe nominees for Best Musical or Comedy are \"Burn After Reading,\" \"Happy-Go-Lucky,\" \"In Bruges,\" \"Mamma Mia!\" and \"Vicky Christina Barcelona.\"\n\nMany complaints here. While multitudes saw \"Mamma Mia!\" did anyone actually like it? Weren't they mildly annoyed by the fact that virtually no one in this musical could sing or dance? While the ABBA music was great and the play a hit - probable explanations for the draw - this film hits more sour notes than band practice at an elementary school. Wait, that's not fair to elementary school bands.\n\nIn this field, the only true comedy, and I use the term loosely, is \"Burn After Reading\" - a weak imitation of \"Fargo.\" \"In Bruges\" rates as the best film here though to label it a comedy is pushing the definition. This tale of Irish hit men out of their element has its comic moments, but it ends more with a bang than a simper.\n\nI assume all the Foreign Press members have seen \"Happy-Go-Lucky.\" They and few indie filmgoers would be the only ones. The movie features a fine performance from Sally Hawkins, but best comedy? Please.\n\nThat leaves \"Vicky Christina Barcelona,\" Woody Allen's latest film. While this movie is light years away from such classic Woodman romcoms as \"Annie Hall\" and \"Manhattan,\" it represents a step-up from his previous efforts. It should win by default, though I can see \"Burn After Reading\" sneaking in as a tribute to the Coen brothers or \"In Bruges\" triumphing based on the cast's superb performances.\n\nThis category is so lame because it doesn't include the funniest film of the year, and that would be \"Tropic Thunder.\" The subject is not open for debate.\n\nThe nominations for Best Director are Danny Boyle, \"Slumdog Millionaire\"; Stephen Daldry, \"The Reader\"; David Fincher, \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\"; Ron Howard, \"Frost/Nixon\"; and Sam Mendes, \"Revolutionary Road.\"\n\nA strong field, but where's Gus Van Sant, the director of \"Milk,\" and Clint Eastwood, who directed \"Gran Torino\" and \"Changeling\"?\n\nBy the way, what's this fascination with \"Revolutionary Road\"? Can one assume it's because the film reunites \"Titanic\" stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet? See this movie, if you must, and then see \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" or \"American Beauty.\" You'll want to hit the \"Road,\" Jack, and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.\n\nBoyle should win for the simple reason that he helmed the best film of the year. Fincher might pull off an upset, just to give an award to \"Button,\" considering it tied with \"Doubt\" and \"Frost/Nixon\" as the recipient of the most nominations this year. Each garnered five.\n\nThe nominees for Best Dramatic Actor are Leonardo DiCaprio, \"Revolutionary Road\"; Frank Langella, \"Frost/Nixon\"; Sean Penn, \"Milk\"; Brad Pitt, \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\"; and Mickey Rourke, \"The Wrestler.\"\n\nThis is a three-horse race involving Langella, Penn and Rourke. In addition to turning in a bravura performance as President Nixon, Langella has sentiment on his side as an under-appreciated veteran actor. As gay activist Harvey Milk, Penn is also sensational, but his previous win for \"Mystic River\" could hurt his chances.\n\nAs brilliant as Langella and Penn are, Rourke's performance as a has-been wrestler is incendiary. It also represents a major comeback for an actor whose career had gone down for the count. I would have no trouble with Langella getting the Globe, but Rourke is more deserving.\n\nIf either DiCaprio or Pitt win, it'll be a crime against humanity.\n\nThe nominees for Best Dramatic Actress are Anne Hathaway, \"Rachel Getting Married\"; Angelina Jolie, \"Changeling\"; Meryl Streep, \"Doubt\"; Kristin Scott Thomas, \"I've Loved You So Long\"; and Kate Winslet, \"Revolutionary Road.\"\n\nAnother dubious field because the best dramatic performance of 2008 is not listed. Melissa Leo merits this award for her hyper-realistic performance in \"Frozen River.\" Streep and Hathaway should be the favorites but after Leo, the best performance belongs to Scott Thomas, the Brit who excels in a French-language film. This is my brain-on-drugs prediction.\n\nThe nominees for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical are Javier Bardem, \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\"; Colin Farrell, \"In Bruges\"; James Franco, \"Pineapple Express\"; Brendan Gleeson, \"In Bruges\"; and Dustin Hoffman, \"Last Chance Harvey.\"\n\nYet another far-from-stellar field. Neither Bardem nor Hoffman is particularly funny. At least Franco is comical. In a just world, the award should go to both Farrell and Gleeson. Talent deserves to be recognized.\n\nThe nominees for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical are Rebecca Hall, \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\"; Sally Hawkins, \"Happy-Go-Lucky\"; Frances McDormand, \"Burn After Reading\"; Meryl Streep, \"Mamma Mia!\"; and Emma Thompson, \"Last Chance Harvey.\"\n\nMy kingdom for a comic. You won't find one here. On the musical front, let's just say Streep acts better than she sings.\n\nCritics groups have been honoring Hawkins, so let's pull a lemming and follow the crowd.\n\nThe nominees for Best Supporting Actor are Tom Cruise, \"Tropic Thunder\"; Robert Downey Jr., \"Tropic Thunder\"; Ralph Fiennes, \"The Duchess\"; Philip Seymour Hoffman, \"Doubt\"; and Heath Ledger, \"The Dark Knight.\"\n\nA strong field, but this category provides one of the few sure bets. Ledger wins and rightfully so. An amazing performance, and the posthumous thing only enhances his chances. If the Foreign Press membership doesn't concur, they're cretins. No offense meant.\n\nThe nominees for Best Supporting Actress are Amy Adams, \"Doubt\"; Penelope Cruz, \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\"; Viola Davis, \"Doubt\"; Marisa Tomei, \"The Wrestler\"; and Kate Winslet, \"The Reader.\"\n\nAnother excellent field with all the nominees deserving the award, though Winslet's performance could easily be classified as a leading role. It wasn't so she wouldn't compete against herself for \"Revolutionary Road.\" She's much better in this much better film. That said, Cruz kicks up a storm as the wildly unstable artist in \"Vicky.\" She's a hoot. Give her the award, Foreign Press, or she'll shoot you.\n\nThe nominees for Best Animated Film are \"Bolt,\" \"Kung Fu Panda\" and \"WALL-E.\" I'll go out on a redwood-sized limb here and pick \"WALL-E,\" a film that would have been in the running for Best Comedy if this category didn't exist. It's one of the finest movies of the year, and that's not open for debate either.\n\nMy prognostication skills, unfortunately, might be.\n\nCommon touch\n\nIt's now time for TRIVIA.\n\nLast month's tester: What film and TV actor appeared as a guest on a television show during one of its most historic broadcasts? Name the actor, the television show and the historic broadcast.\n\nClue: This actor was the only cast member of a popular 1960s TV show to receive an Emmy nomination. Also, one of his co-stars in one of his 1960s films received two Oscar nominations in the 1950s. Name the co-star, too.\n\nAnswer: Frank Gorshin, who appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" when The Beatles made their first appearance on TV in 1964. Gorshin received an Emmy nomination for playing The Riddler on \"Batman.\" His co-star in \"That Darned Cat\" was Elsa Lanchester.\n\nFor sticklers, we should point out that Lanchester's first best supporting actress nomination took place in 1950 even though the film, \"Come to the Stable,\" hailed from 1949. Our apologies if that threw anyone off the trail. Her second best supporting actress nomination was for \"Witness for the Prosecution\" from 1957.\n\nThis month's tester: This foreign-born actor appeared in movies with Liza Minnelli, Walter Matthau, Jacqueline Bissett, Robert Duvall, Kris Kristofferson, Jason Robards, Robert Ryan, John Wayne, Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, Max von Sydow and Ava Gardner.\n\nClue: His reaction to a critic has probably been contemplated by other actors. Name the actor and describe the reaction.\n\nThe first person to answer the trivia question correctly will receive two canvas eco-friendly reusable bags from Altitude Inc. Get Reel gives Altitude a high-five.\n\nTrivia enthusiasts can call me at 508-626-4409 or e-mail me at btremblay@cnc.com.\n\nMake sure you leave your name, address and number on my message machine or e-mail so I can contact you if you answered the question correctly. The address is needed so winners can be mailed their prize. Callers should spell out their names slowly and clearly so their names will be spelled correctly in the column. Only one guess per household, please.\n\nAnswers will be accepted until 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 13. Good luck!"
