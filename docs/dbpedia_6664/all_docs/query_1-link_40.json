        "text": "Cinema is dead probably. Look, I don’t know.\n\nI think YouTube or somewhere just played this one after we had watched another movie, and we let it. Deathmoon (1978) is a made-for-TV werewolf movie set in Hawaii. There’s not a whole lot to it, but the one novel aspect here is that it’s an anti-colonial curse.\n\nI really like Martin Short. Most of the time. Clifford (1994) is not one of those times. Short plays an old priest who tells the story of how he was an annoying little kid, and while it is amusing to see an obviously grown man pretending to be a child in a sea of adult actors who are going along with it, it’s way more unsettling and creepy than anything else. Clifford (the character) also veers between behaving like a small boy to behaving like a psychotically manipulative adult man. But maybe Clifford had to walk so MADtv’s Stuart could run.\n\nThe big pluses here are Charles Grodin (pulling a real Richard Dreyfuss in What About Bob? and managing to steal the show from a comedy icon by playing the straight man so well). The other big plus here is Dinosaur World. The whole movie Clifford wants to go to Dinosaur World, and, when they finally do, we get amazing matte paintings, elaborate whimsical sets, and impressive prehistoric animatronic monsters.\n\nUp and down, stem to stern, Anaconda (1997) is dumb. It’s a dumb movie. It’s one of those creature-features where the titular animal just wants to get you so bad. It will do anything to get you. It boasts some truly awful performances (Jennifer Lopez) and some truly bewildering performances (Jon Voight). It was hard for movies like this living in the shadow of Tremors and Jurassic Park.\n\nWe knew it would be bad (and probably much worse than we remembered it being from when we were kids), but it does have a few things going for it:\n\nAn actual animatronic giant snake (most of the time). This and Tobe Hooper’s Crocodile are terrible, but some of the last bastions of B-movie creature-features that have fun puppets on set. It adds weight and danger to what you’re looking at. If you’re a B-movie that only has weak CGI effects, don’t even waste my time.\n\nSome actual jungle locations and a cool boat. That’s nice. I like the boat.\n\nIce Cube. Say what you want, but he brings something grounding to this nonsense that really helps the whole thing go down smoother.\n\nAnd that’s what I’ll say. It’s dumb, but goes down smooth. One of the last classic watchable prestige B-pictures maybe. Well, that or Deep Blue Sea. But it is bad. I can’t in good conscience tell anyone to watch this.\n\nI really wanted to like Bruce Robinson’s How to Get Ahead in Advertising (1989). Robinson’s directorial debut (that also stars Richard E. Grant), Whitnail & I, is a boozy classic of British comedy. His next film was arguably more ambitious and zany, but it’s also rather grating.\n\nSpoilers ahead.\n\nA cynical ad executive grows a conscience…sort of. For a bit. Or at least he has a break with reality where feels he cannot, in good conscience, continue to peddle products that are probably bad. He goes from being mean and irritating to being mean and irritating. Then he grows, quite literally, a boil on his neck that sprouts a face and begins talking to him. This makes him mean and irritating. Eventually the boil – which is his more unscrupulous side – grows larger and more powerful, ultimately overtaking him and the ad exec ends up just a mean and irritating man. And that’s how you get a “head” in advertising.\n\nThe central theme is good, the Cronenbergian body horror is gross and inspired, and Richard E. Grant is throwing himself into this, but it’s all a bit just one note for me. And while I generally like a downer ending, this just felt unsatisfying. Like all that screaming and running around just for this? It’s worth checking out, and I’m sure a lot of folks out there will like it more than I did.\n\nI recalled liking Super Troopers. And I realized it’s the only Broken Lizard movie I’d ever seen. Sick on the couch and needing something brainless, I put on Club Dread (2004). It’s an early 2000s comedy that parodies the slasher genre. It’s got hot ladies and guys being dumb, as well as Bill Paxton as a washed-up Jimmy Buffet knockoff.\n\nIt’s not particularly cinematic. It’s not a good slasher flick. And it’s not that funny. However, it did grow on me. By the third act it actually starts to become pretty funny and gory. Why it didn’t lean into the humor and the horror before then is a bit of a mystery, perhaps the scariest mystery of all. It definitely needed more funny accents. Jay Chandrasekhar and Steve Lemme get to have some fun with their wacky characters. Share the love, ya know?\n\nA Private Function (1984) is a respectable British comedy about meat rationing in a small town during the postwar period. There’s an uptight inspector who is a stickler for the rules and an unlicensed pig being kept on a farm illegally for the political class. It’s all very dry and English, but it’s a veritable who’s who of legendary British actors. We got Dame Maggie Smith, Michael Palin, Denholm Elliott, Richard Griffiths, Bill Paterson, Jim Carter, Liz Smith, and Pete Postlethwaite all up in here.\n\nKen Russell tells the classic yarn of a cold and distant man who gets so obsessed with unraveling cosmic mysteries and touching God by doing shamanic drugs in a sensory deprivation tank to de-evolve himself into an early hominid, when the real meaning for living was the woman who loves you and has been there all along. We just gotta ignore the people he killed.\n\nAltered States (1980) is a bit of a mess, and the mechanics of what is literally happening in the universe of the movie are…silly. They’re very silly. It fastforwards through time like it’s nothing, so we never really get to sit with the characters for very long, and when we do they’re not very compelling. The movie is nuts. It has great visuals and wild psychedelic trip sequences. It’s got William Hurt, Blair Brown, Bob Balaban. The real star? Charles Haid as a foul-mouthed Southern scientist who absolutely has no time for any of your shit.\n\nAs you are well aware, Christopher Nolan’s sweeping biopic about the man who made the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer (2023) won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Original Score, Best Editing and Best Cinematography. It was pretty decent.\n\nYou ever watch a movie and think to yourself, “Gosh. I just don’t know if I’m Czech enough for this”?Vojtěch Jasný’s Cassandra Cat (1963) (aka When the Cat Comes, The Cat Who Wore Sunglasses, One Day a Cat, The Cat) is weird, even by Czech New Wave standards.\n\nA small town (with a few characters that have different views on society and what is best for human flourishing) gets visited by a traveling circus. The circus features a cat. The cat wears sunglasses. If the sunglasses are removed, anyone it looks at will change colors to reveal their true inner self.\n\nI’ll come clean and say a lot of the metaphors were lost on me, which I atribute to having not grown up in Soviet-controlled postwar Czechoslovakia. However, narrative enigmas aside, I enjoyed the fairytale feel and the look of it. I loved the magic show sequence, fourth-wall breaking, the textured imagery, unpredictable chaos, the colors, and the performance Oliva/the Magician (Jan Werich). I really just don’t know what to make of it.\n\nBrian Trenchard-Smith is my favorite Trailers from Hell guy. He’s always so eloquent and proper, regal even. He’s always wearing Hawaiian shirts. And I don’t even really like any of his movies. That is, until we saw Dead End Drive-In (1986), an Australian post-apocalyptic grunge fest (is there another kind?). It’s general chaos and lawlessness out there, but if you can make it to a movie, you might just get away from it all…until you realize you can never leave. It’s essentially a prison that the government feeds drugs and junk food to in order to reign in and contain some of that violent youthful rebelliousness. It’s grimy and punk and it actually has some things to say. It’s also got a really nice car stunt at the end.\n\nAdam Rifkin’s The Dark Backward (1991) is one weird, gross, messed up kind of movie that will forever be remembered, for me at least, as the most accurate depiction of entry level standup comedy and the movie that has Bill Paxton fondle and lick the corpse of a woman he finds in the garbage at the dump.\n\nMore Ken Russell! Twiggy stars in The Boy Friend (1971), a comedy about all the drama onstage and behind the scenes of a lavish stage production, and Russell’s tribute to Busby Berkeley musicals. It’s a sweeter, more tame film than Tommy or Liszomania, but apparently he did this right after The Devils (my personal favorite) to prove he wasn’t just some insane deviant. It’s very breezy and stylish. Each musical setpiece does something new and exciting. Welcome style over substance.\n\nWriter/director/producer/astrologer/star Craig Denney set out to make a name for himself in The Astrologer (1976), an incomprehensible pile of dogshit that is absolutely worth your time. We laughed a lot, just don’t ask us to recount the plot. Don’t even ask Craig Denney. You can’t. He died right after the movie came out. Or, perhaps more plausibly, as many claim, he faked his own death for reasons that will forever remain a mystery.\n\nIf you love it when a movie looks like it smells bad, you’ll love The Astrologer, not to be confused with The Astrologer (1975) which we accidentally watched a few lists back thinking it was this one. See? I told you I’d get to it.\n\nJohn Cassavetes’ Husbands (1970) can be a bit too meandering, improvised, and long at times, but at the end of the day, it’s a fairly unflinching portrait of a particular type of man, one that has perhaps evolved over time but exists nevertheless.\n\nJohn Cassavetes, Ben Gazzara, and Peter Falk are MEN. They don’t cry! They get drunk and throw up! They’re rude to people! They beat their wives! They have repressed emotions! They are deeply insecure and afraid! They have intimacy issues! They can barely admit to themselves that they love each other! MEN!\n\nE. Elias Merhige’s Shadow of the Vampire (2000) is a criminally underseen gothic horror about the making of the infamous 1922 Nosferatu. It posits an alternative cinema history wherein legendary German director, F.W. Murnau (played here by John Malkovich), so intent on realism for his vampire movie, secretly hires a real vampire (played by Willem Dafoe absolutely chewing up every scene and clearly having a blast being weird and creepy). If you’re a Nosferatu fan (either the original 1922 Murnau version or the 1979 Werner Herzog version, or are just excited for the upcoming Robert Eggers one – that will also feature Dafoe, but as a vampire hunter), then you gotta check out this underrated oddity. I love it when a film recognizes the only way to sell its zany premise is let the weirdness have a layer of grim humor.\n\nThe movie itself is good, if a little cartoony (and Udo Kier and Eddie Izzard are fun additions to the cast), but the real reason to watch it is for Willem Dafoe’s unabashedly kooky performance as the bloodsucking immortal posing as obscure actor Max Schreck. I daresay Dafoe is even more captivating and fun to watch than the real Schreck and even Klaus Kinski. He really is one of the best actors working today, and I respect the hell out of him for taking weird roles like this.\n\nHarrison Ford’s innate charisma extends to a cop drama that morphs into a steamy Amish romance in Peter Weir’s Witness (1985). I had forgotten that it’s not really an action movie. Kid me remembered the intense ending, but adult me was digging all the sexual tension between Ford’s wounded cop and Kell McGillis’s thirsty Amish widower. Like a lot of folks, this was my introduction to Amish culture, and, while it’s pretty surface level (I mean we really only have this, Kingpin, and For Richer or Poorer), it highlights their pacifism and plain living. It’s a pretty solid drama with an absolutely terrible soundtrack.\n\nRewatched this banger, and The Fifth Element (1997) is still so breezily fun and good that it only rubs it in further that Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets isn’t. Luc Besson’s filmography is filled with arresting visual flair that is also unmistakably French. Like how you don’t get that feeling watching a Terry Gilliam film. Like how when you’re watching Alien Resurrection and someone says, “hey, you know the director is the Amélie guy”, and you’re like, “oh, well, now THAT explains a lot of what I’m seeing.”\n\nAnyway, the thing I’ve always loved about The Fifth Element was that, horny sci-fi hijinks aside, it’s just so odd. And silly. It’s having fun being silly at you. And it dishes out it’s silliness and its cavalcade of silly characters in carefully planned installments. The costumes by Jean-Paul Gaultier really help define the movie’s unique tone. And you gotta love a montage of an interstellar cruiseship readying for takeoff intercut with Chris Tucker banging a stewardess set to space reggae. The French, man.\n\nNot that it’s saying much, but this is Milla Jovovich’s best movie, and Bruce Willis was always at his best when allowed to showcase his sense of humor. The whole cast is great. Don’t make me name them all. It’s a who’s who of supporting greats.\n\nWilliam Peter Blatty is most famous for writing the novel and screenplay of The Exorcist. He only directed two movies. The Exorcist III, which I loved, and The Ninth Configuration (1980), a truly beguilingly dark yet comic film about trauma and faith.\n\nA laconic marine psychaitrist (Stacy Keach) goes to a mysterious castle asylum in the foggy northwestern woods. It is a dysfunctional place populated by brilliant men who have all gone mad from the war. One patient (Scott Wilson), however, isn’t a soldier at all. He’s an astronaut that had a psychotic break moments before takeoff and had to be dragged from the rocket ship. From there we embark on a spiritual journey in and out of madness and reality, and confront the duplicitous duality of man: the good and evil that lurks within us all.\n\nThe setting is great. The cast is great (love me some Ed Flanders). It has a great bar fight. It’s a weird sort of movie that really doesn’t get made anymore. At least, not like this. It’s a hypnotic mystery that unravels very slowly, and it is steeped in some serious post Vietnam anti-war sentiment. This all adds to the flavor. Now, Blatty’s worldview might be a bit too inaccessibly Catholic for me at times, but he uses his religious framework to intelligently get at deeper truths about the human condition…or at least truths we all hope are true. I do think The Exorcist III is a lot more polished and relateable, but this is a worthwhile curio.\n\nAnd you know something? I even like Stacy Keach without a mustache.\n\nI liked Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part 2 (2024) a good deal better than the first one, although there were things in the first one I did really like. Villeneuve’s team can create some striking images and manufacture the feeling of immense scale, but there’s just something about Timothée Chalamet that really takes me out of things. Even more than Christopher Walken did for a lot of people in this. But hey, I’m mostly watching these things for Stellan Skarsgård, Javier Bardem, and Charlotte Rampling. Zendaya doing some good stuff in here too. If you can get into the slow pace and get sucked into the scope of the world building, there’s a lot to appreciate.\n\nThe Full Monty (1997) is a just a prime example of an efficient comedy executed well. Aided by a smart, funny script and a terrific cast (Robert Carlyle, Mark Addy, Tom Wilkinson, Paul Barber), it hits every mark it sets out to hit. Six desperate and unemployed Sheffield steel workers come together to put on a striptease show in order to make enough money to solve their problems. Simple set up and pay off with just the right stakes, jabs at masculine insecurities, and hiccups along the way to make for a very enjoyable 90 minutes.\n\nR.I.P. Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom, Michael Clayton, Batman Begins, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Full Monty)\n\nPowell and Pressburger are glorious movie gods and A Matter of Life and Death (1946) proves it. So does The Red Shoes. And Black Narcissus. And The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. And if I cheat and sneak in The Thief of Bagdad, that too.\n\nA British airman (David Niven) gets shot down during WWII and his afterlife escort (Marius Goring) can’t find his soul in the thick English fog to ferry him to the next world. This causes problems upstairs. To make matters even more complicated, the airman has fallen in love! Now he’ll have to fight for his right to live in the high courts of the otherworld. Or maybe it’s all in his head.\n\nAs much as I may not buy the oh-so-crucial romance between David Niven and Kim Hunter (I dislike it, in fact), and as much as I find it weird that the survival of their relationship depends on a successful lobotomy (don’t enjoy that), I absolutely love the audacious look of this thing, the weird bureaucratic mechanics of the afterlife, Roger Livesey and Raymond Massey are great, and I LOVE the trial in the final act.\n\nThere’s something magical and refreshing about the progressive optimism embodied by certain films of this era that we’ve really lost as we’ve all become more cynical and jaded. I miss stories that believed in something real and hopeful and had the temerity to back it up. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington comes to mind, among others. It’s the difference in flavor between patriotism and jingoistic nationalism, I think. These films are patriotic. And they actually taste good for it.\n\nTo me, what makes A Matter of Life and Death work is not that the court case is about proving the love between a death-dodging Englishman and a woman from Boston; it’s that the trial puts modern (for the 40s) American culture on trial. It dares to challenge America’s angrier revolutionary past, and demands that it face how the very things it claimed to believe in all came true, and in ways that are better than it could have imagined (and in ways it cannot recognize or even really approve of). Sure, it sidesteps a slew of historical evils, but it does at least rub England’s face in its own stodgy history of imperialism and murder. Watching it now, I lament, because it seems that, for a time, we were maybe getting on the right path, albeit in fits and starts and with plenty of maturing still to do. But there was hope, and reason to hope, dammit.\n\nWatch this one. It’s a unique film that’s been copied enough by now. Fits nicely alongside films like The Devil and Daniel Webster, Heaven Can Wait, Defending Your Life, Wings of Desire, and maybe even Beetlejuice.\n\nWhat an absolute treat The Holdovers (2023) is. Directed by Alexander Payne (About Schmidt, Nebraska) and starring Paul Giamatti (in one of his best roles since Payne’s Sideways), Dominic Sessa, and Da’Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is My Name), the story concerns three lonely creatures stuck at a private high school over the Christmas break. This is a great example of an excellent script, stellar cast (and their chemistry), and rich locations and setting really elevating a simple premise and making it something special. The 70s aesthetic also gives it a lot of extra juice. It just looks so good. It pulls you into its cozy, misanthropic world and just lets a sweet dusting of snow settle on you while it makes you some hot tea with lemon. Highly recommend if you haven’t seen it yet.\n\nOK, Craig Denney was a curiosity for making The Astrologer. Shuny Bee is a legend for making Fight of Fury (2020). Once again, Bee is the writer/director/producer/editor/stunt coordinator/star. That’s exactly what you want for this kind of thing. I shan’t say too much, other than I absolutely loved it and cannot wait for the sequel.\n\nIshirō Honda’s original Godzilla (1954) remains a classic, and one of the best movies about the atomic bomb (sorry, Oppenheimer). The hand puppet closeups are little goofy, but the destruction is still visceral and shocking. And there’s just something extra haunting about Godzilla in black-and-white.\n\nThis movie frightened me as a kid (although the version I saw then had a disconnected Perry Mason spliced into it) because unlike Frankenstein or King Kong, which I loved, there was no identifying or humanizing with the monster. Godzilla was just a bastard. It was just a mindless force of destruction oblivious to the wanton carnage it wrought. Some of the scenes are still effectively frightening 70 years later.\n\nIt’s easy to take for granted Godzilla’s status in monster movie history. For the remainder of the Shōwa era of Godzilla, the movies get increasingly campy, silly, and geared toward children. There are a few bright spots (Mothra, I love you), but none of them try to be horror like the initial outing. The Heisei, Millennium, and Reiwa eras all kind of have their own vibe. But that first movie remains something unique and startling. Perhaps because it was less than a decade after the bombs were dropped. Perhaps because it was the first time cinema had seen a monster that large and unstoppable. 33 Japanese films later, the lizard stomps on.\n\nRate this:\n\nFirst off, shout out to my girls: Mubi, Tubi, and Criterion. Y’all never stop delivering.\n\n28. A British reality show where a random group of ladies have to survive a night in a mansion full of dinosaurs? That’s a schlocky enough premise that it should just be marvelously stupid fun. Alas, Dinosaur Hotel (2021) is just boring at best and cringingly irritating at worst.\n\n27. The CGI in Dinosaur Hotel got me down, so I opted for an old fashioned Italian B-movie creature-feature with practical puppet effects. The crocodile itself in Killer Crocodile 2 (1990) is pretty fake looking but kind of neat all the same. The movie is slow, and while not it’s not very interesting or well shot, there is a scene where a couple of canoes full of kids and nuns gets attacked.\n\n26. For the first 10 minutes or so, we thought Vicious Lips (1986) was going to be the spaced out Rocky Horror Picture Show style rock opera camp extravaganza we were hoping for. It quickly devolves into the movie just sort of killing time to reach the feature-length target time. It has some truly epic hair, but the real crime is that there weren’t more songs. A lot of tedium could have been forgiven had they actually made a musical out of this.\n\n25. Without the presence of the unabashedly flamboyant Dennis Rodman, Double Team (1997) would just be another forgettable Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. It’s pretty dumb, but there are a few good action scenes and I’m pretty sure this is the only finale (SPOILER) that blows up Mickey Rourke as he’s being attacked by a tiger.\n\n24. Sybil Danning sports one of the tackiest pieces of clothing ever made in Fred Olen Ray’s The Phantom Empire (1988). Some dopes go into the Adam West bat-cave and stumble upon a secret world that has mutants, dinosaurs, and scantily clad cavegirls. Why does Russ Tamblyn always get special billing in everything?\n\n23. We watched Venom (1981) because it had Oliver Reed and Klaus Kinski – two famously massive egos with a penchant for alcoholism and violent tantrums respectively. Alas, the movie is a bit miscast and silly and ends up just being a boring hostage story but with the inexplicable inclusion of a highly venomous black mamba on the loose in the house. It’s less Snakes On a Plane and more *bong rip* what-if-Dog-Day-Afternoon-had-a-snake-in-it? Sterling Hayden is looking a bit grizzled, but clear-voiced Nicol Williamson provides a bit of a dramatic center as the police chief in the second half. Poor Susan George gets a pretty gnarly death scene.\n\n22. Jordan Peele’s work will forever be compared to Get Out. Us (2019) boasts some nice cinematography and a stellar performance from Lupita Nyong’o as a woman returning with her new family to a location that has haunted her for years. It’s got a weird sci-fi twist and a lot of muddled metaphor and the movie spends way too much time providing lengthy expository monologues that attempt to explain and lend coherence to the mechanics of how the twists and reveals actually work… which end up leaving more questions, bogging the whole plot down with being too literal. It’s not scary, but it is confusing. There are few cool ideas that I wish the story had focused on a bit more. The muddled metaphor also feels a little lost in the movie’s need to explain everything to death.\n\n21. An immortal witch with bleached hair walks around and collects victims for her weird rituals in Necropolis (1986). It’s ridiculous, but kind of awesome. The production value is low, but my brain would not have accepted the higher budgeted version of this.\n\n20. I miss movies that get so specific about a town and a line of work the audience might be unfamiliar with that you start to find the characters in rooms and spaces you absolutely cannot identify, but you know it’s not set dressing; it’s just a place they found. My Bloody Valentine (1981) is a Canadian horror flick about a ghost coal miner seeking revenge. Points for being near a mine and building a movie around it, and points for some creative kills, and being maybe the only Valentine’s Day slasher movie(?). SPOILER: I kind of wish the antagonist was actually supernatural and not just the Scooby-Doo style reveal we get.\n\n19. Ray Harryhausen stop-motion dinosaurs and Raquel Welch in a fur bikini are reasons to see this hokey Hammer production. One Million Years B.C. (1966) may not be exactly historically accurate, but credit for being a wordless drama about the lives of early hominids…who are very well shaven. When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth is another film in the same vein, but none can hold a candle to the more grounded Jean-Jacques Annaud silent neanderthal epic, Quest for Fire.\n\n18. Lamberto Bava’s Demons (1985) is a schlocky good time. People get invited to a mysterious movie screening and then audience members start turning into demons. It starts fast and doesn’t stop, complete with a sword-wielding motorcycle chase.\n\n17. I enjoy pool. I like a cool underdog story. I love hypnotic Christopher Walken monologues. Poolhall Junkies (2002) hits a lot of familiar sports movie beats, but it’s slick and quick and has a few cute tricks. Even if pool isn’t your thing, it’s worth it for the few scenes Christopher Walken gets to chew to bits. Rod Steiger and Chazz Palminteri co-star.\n\n16. This Serbian-Croatian production is a folk horror set in the late 1800s. Lepterica (1973) is the story of a flour mill in a tiny village that is being hassled by a vampiric ghoul from beyond the grave. While light on actual scares, what makes this one engaging is the fun dynamics between the village folk and some of their approaches to attempt to deal with the monster.\n\n15. Albert Finney is Tom Jones (1963), a gallivanting bastard and cad in jolly old England, canoodling his way into the skirts of every dame that tickles his fancy. It’s classic sex comedy hijinks, made more interesting by its 18th century rules and setting. It’s cheeky editing and narration also gives it a touch of whimsy and buoyancy, and, if you’re a bit drunk, you might even forget to unfavorably compare it to Stanley Kubrick’s superior Barry Lyndon.\n\n14. Josef von Sterberg’s steamy and ponderous romantic melodrama takes place a sultry, imaginary version of Morocco (1930) that never existed. Marlene Dietrich is an emotionally detached vaudevillian drifter who finds herself performing in a smoky Moroccan night club for the entertainment of foreign legionnaires (like equally aimless Gary Cooper) and mysterious millionaires (like Adolphe Menjou). It’s a sleepy sort of love triangle that never moves too quickly and always sort of feels like a dream. Everyone is running away from something. They’ve given up on hope, but still have the pangs of romantic yearnings deep within them that cause them to make seemingly erratic decisions. It’s slow, and it’s no Shanghai Express or Casablanca, but it’s worth it for the moody sets and Dietrich’s tuxedo.\n\n13. Ken Russell is responsible for some of the most insane and fascinating movies out there: Lisztomania, The Devils, Women in Love, Altered States, Gothic, Tommy, etc. Lair of the White Worm (1988) is his drunken wackadoo take on a B-movie, I suppose. An immortal snake woman (delectably played by Amanda Donahoe who is giving her hammy dialogue 110%) is collecting virginal sacrifices to feed to a phallic snake demon (there’s a lot of phallic imagery in this one). It’s absolutely bonkers and boasts some wild hallucination sequences and a very young Hugh Grant and an even younger looking Peter Capaldi. Is it good? Who’s to say? It’s pretty damn fun though. There were bold choices that had us cackling and falling out of our chairs.\n\n12. I never saw Weird Al Yankovic’s cinematic opus until now. Without the filter of nostalgia, I still enjoyed the gentle oddball comedy of UHF (1989). A nerd (Yankovic) realizes his dream of running a local TV station and discovers a hidden talent in a dimwitted janitor (Michael Richards). It’s cute and a nice slice of TV history, and goes down almost as smooth as David Byrne’s True Stories. Weird Al fans should definitely check it out if, like me, they somehow missed this one when they were kids. Would have loved a few more Weird Al songs in it though.\n\n11. Frank Henenlotter turns his eye to the streets with Frankenhooker (1990). It’s a Troma film, so it is excessive, but still softer and more whimsical than Henenlotter’s Basket Case. An extremely superficial man’s wife dies tragically in a freak lawnmower accident. He’s also a bit of an amateur mad scientist so he takes this opportunity to reconstruct her entire body and design it to his own specifications. He develops crack that explodes prostitutes and then builds his perfect woman out of their parts. The movie is silly and goofy enough, but once the eponymous Frankenhooker herself appears, the movie just becomes so much more fun. It’s a movie that keeps topping itself with insane sequences and bizarro ideas, but the real star is Patty Mullen as the wife who finds herself a reanimated zombie girl channeling the thoughts of several sex workers. It’s a wonderful performance and the amount of fun she seems to be having is infectious.\n\n10. Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest flick is a breezy and fun romantic drama that meanders through the 70s. Licorice Pizza (2021) is the story of a teen entrepreneur and hustler named Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman) as he woos an older girl, the 25 year old Alana (Alana Haim). This will-they/won’t-they was much more affecting than in a typical romantic comedy, and it just looks and feels great. Also features Tom Waits, Sean penn, Bradley Cooper, Benny Safdie, Harriet Sansom Harris, Maya Rudolph, John Michael Higgens, and Skyler Gisondo.\n\n9. It’s interesting the movies I find myself returning to again and again. Takashi Miike’s oddball black comedy musical, The Happiness of the Katakuris (2001), is just so sweet and weird and comforting, that it keeps calling me back. A Japanese family starts a bed and breakfast in the countryside, but when their first customers tragically die, the family bands together to hide the bodies to avoid bad publicity.\n\n8. If you’re not already on board with Guy Maddin’s esoteric sensibilities, then Brand Upon the Brain! (2006) might not convert you. However, if you jive with his unique brand of avant-garde surrealist humor, then buckle up for a weird journey through memory, trauma, longing, and lighthouses. I may be partial to My Winnipeg, but this one deserves the praise.\n\n7. This one is a vibe. Air Conditioner (2020) is a dreamy Angolan drama that follows a man on a mission to acquire an air conditioner for his boss in a city plagued by a mysterious calamity: air conditioners keep falling out of windows and smashing onto the ground. This one is chill and great for its colors and atmosphere.\n\n6. Robert Pattinson shines as a greasy bank robber who loves his mentally challenged brother and has one night to find bail money after a robbery goes awry in the Safdie Brothers’ Good Time (2017). It’s colorful and kinetic and the ticking clock builds tension. It may not be a good time for the protagonists, but it’s definitely a great bit of anxiety-inducing filmmaking.\n\n5. Film restoration is important. It preserves amazing works of art, powerful political statements, and cultural time capsules that would otherwise be lost to history. And God bless Vinegar Syndrome for seeking to give an unfinished Z-grade kung-fu movie the royal treatment. New York Ninja (1984) had to be cobbled together and rewritten and re-dubbed decades after it was abandoned. The movie makes very little sense, but it looks great and it’s wonderful batshittery of a lost version of New York City where a man can witness his hot wife get stabbed to death on the streets, on his birthday no less, and use his birthday swords (and occasionally roller skates) to become the most conspicuous ninja vigilante alive. It’s chef kiss levels of lunacy and juvenile action and we absolutely loved it.\n\n4. I keep giving Mae West more chances, and I’ve only been rewarded. I was lukewarm on My Little Chickadee, but I enjoyed She Done Him Wrong. With I’m No Angel (1933), I can officially say I am a fan. This sassy, smarmy, and oh-so-horny queen slays every scene with equal parts entendre and shade. West is Tira, a gold-digging circus performer who uses her sexuality to get the finer things in life from amorous men. That is, until she meets Cary Grant and actually, against everything she believes, falls in love. The last act is a literal trial where West basically lays out her case to the audience justifying why she is the way that she is. If Groucho Marx is Bugs Bunny, Mae West is Bugs Bunny in drag. Such a shame the Hays Code put an end to her reign.\n\n3. Classic reggae stars populate the half-documentary world of Rockers (1978). This Jamaican musical film takes you through the neighborhoods of Kingston and into the life of Horsemouth (Leroy Wallace), an aspiring musician who gets his motorbike stolen and tries to get it back or get revenge. Wall to wall music and immersive cinematography make Rockers a must see. I dug this more than The Harder They Come.\n\n2. Unrelenting visions of suffering unfold as we follow an assassin on an unknown mission deep into the mechanical and fleshy levels of what is perhaps the most ghoulish hellscapes ever filmed. This is the next logical step beyond The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb and a Tool music video. Special effects pioneer Phil Tippett spent 30 years putting his depression, his darkest visions, and his demons on screen for Mad God (2021). This film truly embodies the spirit of “This Won’t Be For Everyone”. It’s disgusting and monstrous, but also cathartic and beautifully crafted. At points we laughed because the film was not without moments of macabre levity, but also we laughed at the utter bleakness and horrific depths Mad God wanted to take us. In addition to loving the painstaking art of stop-motion, I also love this type of story; one that is less preoccupied with plot and characters, and more concerned with slowly revealing the mechanics and complex ecosystems of a fantasy world concocted out of someone’s warped imagination. Mad God is cryptic and grotesque and many will probably come away with different interpretations. Many will hate it. Personally, for me, I just wish the whole thing had been maquettes and puppets because the few human actors kind of broke the spell a bit (although Repo Man director Alex Cox plays one of the live people, weirdly). It’s one hell of a journey and it will haunt you and make you feel things. Inventive brutality and cosmic visuals aside, Dan Wool’s score must also be recognized. The music doesn’t hold your hand either, but it is powerful and majestic, like a grim cowboy dirge.\n\n1. I’ve seen Ed Wood (1994) a million times and I will see it a million more. It’s a masterpiece. It’s one of the best movies about Hollywood history; one of the best movies about making movies; Tim Burton’s best film by miles; and one of the best movies of the 90s. Tim Burton’s biopic on the cross-dressing man who was once considered the worst director of all time is so funny, so tender, so gorgeously shot, and gushing with deliriously misguided optimism (despite the real life tragedies of the actual people depicted). Hollywood misfits rejoice. Stefan Czapsky’s sumptuous black-and-white cinematography, Howard Shore’s bold but sensitive score, and Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski’s hilarious and touching script all work together so well. And the cast! Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, Bill Murray, Jeffrey Jones, Patricia Arquette, Lisa Marie, and more give it their all.\n\nSHORTS\n\nThe Showman (1970) is a short documentary about a carnival barker and performer who (along with his wife) take in runaway girls so that they can strip nude and be part of their knife throwing act.\n\nWhat a voice. Lonnie Holley’s musical world is cacophonous and full of soul. I Snuck Off The Slave Ship (2019) combines afro-futurist surrealism alongside haunting sounds that seem to echo deep into the past and future. I also highly recommend the music video for Lonnie Holley’s I Woke Up…\n\nBased on a children’s story by Russell Hoban, The Marzipan Pig (1990) is a cozily animated short directed by Michael Sporn and narrated by Tim Curry. It chronicles the crisscrossing lives of a candy pig, the mouse that eats him and falls in love with a grandfather clock who doesn’t appreciate her until she’s gone, an owl that falls in love with a taxi cab light, and other curious characters. Life goes on without you; a heartening and mature message for any age.\n\nRate this:\n\nCan’t stop. Won’t stop. Gonna watch movies until I die.\n\nOnce again, I arbitrarily rank the last few movies I watched using a rigorous system that can be summed up as, “meh, it’s what I was vibing with I guess then maybe.” Enjoy.\n\n26. I have an appreciation for nasty, low-budget grindhouse shocksploitation cinema. I get where it comes from. It has a place in film history. Meir Zarchi’s I Spit On Your Grave (1978) may be tick a few of the boxes for the sub-genre, but it was not really an enjoyable experience. Gratuitous and uncreative are words that come to mind. And as far as rape-revenge movies go, other films spit on this one’s grave. Camille Keaton is at least good as the lead.\n\n25. The Uninvited (1988) is a bad movie about a gangster guy who invites some hot bimbos onto his yacht but they invite a couple of dude-bros, but they are allowed to stay because the captain says they have no deckhands, but also also there is a science-experiment-gone-wrong that comes aboard with the girls. This experiment is never fully explained, but it is essentially a cat with a smaller, wetter cat inside of it that sometimes comes out and kills people or poisons their blood. It’s incredibly stupid and we all had a lot of fun watching it. If you like watching pathetic old guys and annoying 20-somethings yell at each other and die dumbly, then this won’t be a total waste of time.\n\n24. This is more the b-movie sleaze I’m here for. Terminal Island (1973), directed by Stephanie Rothman, begins with a woman (played by Ena Hartman) being brought to a free range island penitentiary. Through her we are introduced to the life-or-death rules and gender politics of this open air hell. Clusters of prisoners, angered by the boss prisoner’s style, secede into factions and they proceed go to war with each other. It’s a solid premise that’s ripe for remake. This little surprise also stars a very young Tom Selleck.\n\n23. If I never see another bio/doc on The Beatles, I’ll sleep just fine. John and Yoko: Above Us Only Sky (2018) gives us a peek into the recording of the album Imagine, and does a good job of letting us see just how weird making art can be. It’s a strange thing to capture an artistic lightning strike, but when it does strike, you had better be ready for it. And you better have the right people in your corner to help you bottle it.\n\n22. We loved Don Coscarelli’s weird grave-robbing interdimensional horror so much, we vowed to watch all the sequels. Phantasm II (1988) was next up. A sleeker production than its predecessor, Phantasm II functions as a sequel/reboot of the original. It was almost impossible to follow, but they made Reggie more of a badass and those spiky, floating death orbs are back so, ya know. 4 stars or whatever.\n\n21. I love finding insane stuff and unleashing it onto my friends. Stumbled upon Possessed II (1984), a batshit Hong Kong spook show that just keeps dialing up the crazy. Just the way we like it. I could attempt to describe the meat locker scene, or the scene with the owl and the rat, or one of the scenes where a lady jumps off a roof, or the scene where a little possessed girl absolutely gives it to her bully. But what would be the point? Best to just let it wash over you and try to figure out just what the hell is happening for yourself. One big surprise I must tell, however, was according to this movie, I guess the Hare Krishnas are right?\n\n20. Finally got to the Rankin-Bass production, The Last Unicorn (1982). Stilted yet stylized animation and a decent voice cast (Mia Farrow, Alan Arkin, Christopher Lee, Tammy Grimes, Jeffe Bridges, etc.) come together to tell this surprisingly deep fantasy about innocence and humanity, love and choices. Apart from Legend, how many movies about unicorns are there? The movie mostly won me over with its theme song.\n\n19. Lucien Castaing documents shepherds in Montana wrangling sheep one last time in Sweetgrass (2009). Like Leviathan, this documentary is light on exposition and explanation. The film is at its most interesting when it lingers on the day-to-day activities of working with sheep.\n\n18. Sonny Chiba might have the most powerful hair in the business. The eyebrows. The sideburns. Everything. Makes sense to cast him as the last of a defeated werewolf clan in groovy 70s Japan. Wolf Guy (1975) was another weirdo flick we found incredibly hard to follow. Stuff just sort of happens and you have to go with it. It’s a crime melodrama with some supernatural elements and we definitely would have rated it higher had the film not kept teasing us with a werewolf transformation that never comes. The film ends the day before he’s supposed to turn into a wolf. Lame.\n\n17. Quentin Dupieux seems to only be interested in making surreal meta-comedies. That’s fine. Not everyone will always be on his wavelength (myself included). However, I enjoyed Réalité (2014). A director (Alain Chabat) is trying to capture the perfect scream in order secure funding for his next movie. But that’s really not what it’s about. Or is it? I don’t know if it goes anywhere or really says anything, but most of me didn’t mind as I was consistently laughing and puzzling over it the whole way. A hypnotic shaggy dog story.\n\n16. I’ve never been the biggest Marilyn Monroe fan, but I gave Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) a shot. Directed by Howard Hawks, it has all the glamor and musical numbers you would hope for in a production like this. Two showgirls – with very different attitudes towards men and romance – go on a fancy cruise ship together. Sardonic Jane Russell is the perfect friend/foil to ditzy Marilyn Monroe, and Russell’s impression of Monroe at the end is really what won me completely over.\n\n15. We are always on the lookout for the next Breen or Wiseau. A misunderstood, deluded auteur who is really putting themselves out there. Writer/director/producer/star, Steve Barkett, has a bit more clarity and vision than some of the others, but all of the self-obsessed hubris we long for. The Aftermath (1982) is a typical brainless sci-fi b-flick about a post-apocalyptic dystopia, but with a sensitive-eyed, noble hero who eventually becomes incensed enough to do the violence. A little slow to get started, but villainous Sid Haig will see you through the middle bits until we get to the big, dumb, pew-pew shoot ’em up final act. Watch The Quiet Earth afterwards to cleanse the palate, if need be.\n\n14. Steve Barkett’s other directorial outing, Empire of the Dark (1990), may be less ambitious in scope, but it has two things that we love: underground devil cult and a grocery store shootout. Barkett is a little less of a goodie-goodie in this one, but still boasts them sultry baby blues. Clearly made on a much smaller budget, but much more fun and watchable than The Aftermath.\n\n13. The Whistlers (2019) is a sexy Romanian crime drama that employs the use of an obscure whistling language native to the Canary Islands in order for its characters to communicate over long distances yet with secrecy. Mobsters, police surveillance, secret codes, and double crosses. It’s admittedly a little hard to follow (especially once you realize it’s being told out of order), but the cast is good and its just such a sleek looking beast, you kind of get sucked in.\n\n12. It had been a hot minute and I found myself revisiting the anarchic stop-motion toy world of A Town Called Panic (2009). Based on a Belgian series, the film follows the surreal misadventures of Cowboy, Indian, and Horse. On the surface, it may appear crude, but there is a deftness in its intentional minimalism, shot composition, and timing. It’s also very creative and funny.\n\n11. There’s still a thing or two I enjoy about David Lynch’s flawed adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel. That said, Denis Villaneuve’s update on Dune (2021) is pretty great. Political intrigue and ancient religions are moving pieces around a big, sandy board that is full of giant worms. I did wish it was a bit more visually interesting (Blade Runner 2049 spoiled us, perhaps), but if the sun-parched desert is bumming you out, just wait for Stellan Skarsgård’s Baron Harkonnen to show up and dominate the screen. And it really does need to be experienced on a massive screen. It’s just nice to see a big budget sci-fi epic take its time to craft a unique experience. We will have to wait and see what the second part has in store.\n\n10. John Carpenter is a legend and Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) is another classic example of a simple idea working well in the hands of someone who knows how to handle the material. A mysterious gang, that almost behaves zombie-like (perhaps due to a sun-flare), is laying siege upon an all but empty police station. It has all the ingredients for a gritty thriller.\n\n9. Guillermo del Toro’s sumptuous visuals lend themselves to classic noir in Nightmare Alley (2021). Stan (Bradley Cooper) is a drifter with a dark past who finds a job in a circus, learns some mentalist tricks of deception, and then uses them to head to the big city (of Buffalo) and use his powers of manipulation to cajole his way into wealth. Naturally, things turn south. Noir typically delves into the dark side of humanity and often functions as a morality play, and this remake gets that. Like all del Toro flicks, the world this story takes place in is detailed and gorgeous, but danger lurks in the shadows. Cate Blanchett, Toni Collette, Rooney Mara, David Strathairn, Ron Perlman, Richard Jenkins, and Willem Dafoe co-star.\n\n8. Hot off the remake, I gave the original Nightmare Alley (1947), directed by Edmund Goulding, a look. I dig classic Hollywood and, while it could be argued that there are things del Toro’s version did better (the rules and culture surrounding mentalism being more fleshed out being one big improvement), there’s something more pure about this one. Tyrone Power is great as Stan and the three women whose affections he juggles (played by Coleen Gray, Joan Blondell, and Helen Walker) are all very good too. It’s almost shot-for-shot the same movie, but some scenes just hit a little harder – even without being overly flashy, stylized, or gruesome.\n\n7. Cartoonists make some of the most interesting directors. Terry Gilliam, Marjane Satrapi, Dash Shaw, Mike Judge, Tim Burton. They just see the world through a more distorted lens. French cartoonist Riad Sattouf’s Jacky in the Kingdom of Women (2014) is a dystopian fantasy set in a Third World fundamentalist dictatorship. The twist is that it’s a matriarchy and all the men are burqa’d up subservient second-class citizens who dream of going to the ball and marrying the tyrant general’s daughter. Recontextualizing religious conservativism by swapping gender roles while also critiquing on government corruption wasn’t enough to make this wacky comedy memorable, so it’s also a riff on the classic tale of Cinderella. This won’t be for everyone, but this one got me. Stars Vincent Lacoste and Charlotte Gainsbourg.\n\n6. Terrence Malick’s Voyage of Time: Life’s Journey (2016) is basically watching the cosmos bits from Tree of Life without the other stuff. I kind of wish it were less theological and poetic and more cryptic and cold, but that’s me. Amazing shots of lost landscapes and stars forming reminds us that this giant, crazy, perhaps eternal universe has always contained powerful magic beyond our comprehension and will continue to do so long after we are gone.\n\n5. Listen. I’m dumb. I like Arnold Schwarzenegger and I like sword-and-sorcery. And I write and illustrate a barbarian webcomic very much inspired by this type of nonsense candy so I’m a bit biased, but… Conan the Destroyer (1984) delivers. John Milius’s previous film, Conan the Barbarian, was a grand epic melodrama, but the Richard Fleischer directed sequel is a straight up fantasy comic book brought to life. Conan goes on a more kid-friendly quest this time since producer Dino De Laurentiis felt another R-rating would effect ticket sales. I’ll accept reduced violence in exchange for more monsters. That’s show business, baby. Grace Jones, Mako, Wilt Chamberlain, and Sarah Douglas co-star.\n\n4. Is this peak Denzel Washington? Maybe. Devil in a Blue Dress (1995), directed by Carl Franklin, is a classic neo-noir detective thriller, but where pretty much all classic noirs were made with whites for whites, this one is set in the Black neighborhoods of Los Angeles. The 1940s set dressing and costumes are wonderful to look at, and Denzel is captivating as Easy Rawlins, a man who takes a mysterious job of finding a woman and unwittingly gets caught up in a murder plot. Don Cheadle shows up about halfway through to give the movie a punch of fresh energy. The movie is sexy as hell.\n\n3. Bong Joon-ho movies are always so rich in human weakness. The Host, Snowpiercer, Okja, and Parasite are all fascinating and outlandish, but his earlier film, Memories of Murder (2003), is a pared down small town police procedural, based on a South Korean true crime event, that might be my favorite. Starring Bong Joon-ho regular, Kang-ho Song, Memories of Murder stands out among cop dramas because the police are not good at their job and are violent and haunted by these killings as they reveal their own incompetence.\n\n2. Charles Grodin and Robert DeNiro have the most amazing comic chemistry in Midnight Run (1988). This was a movie that was on TV a lot, and I always knew it was funny, but I never sat down and watched the whole thing. DeNiro is a divorced ex-cop turned bounty hunter hired to pick up an accountant who stole money from the mob and bring him to Los Angeles. With mafia guys, the FBI, and other bounty hunters hot on their tails, the two men go on a car chase and shootout filled cross-country race. Like all good buddy movies, it’s all really just an excuse to explore male relationships. Yaphet Kotto, Dennis Farina, and Joe Pantoliano co-star. Another MVP for this movie is the absolutely bangin’ Danny Elfman score.\n\n1. Pre-Code melodrama loaded with tough talk, casual racism, and big boy rivalries, The Bowery (1933), directed by Raoul Walsh, showcases a rowdy 1890s New York where everyone’s a wise-guy and grown men control neighborhoods based on their status and infamy. Wallace Beery and George Raft play Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie respectively. The two men are bowler hat wearin’, lady smackin’ rivals who, through a series of dares and stunts, try to win the respect of the lowly denizens of New York’s Bowery district. Swipes McGurk (played by Jackie Cooper) is a foul-mouthed street urchin taken in by Connors, and anchors the film with much needed heart. Fay Wray also co-stars as a homeless girl who winds up with feelings for both Connors and Brodie. There’s also a steamy saloon singer lush with billowing bloomers played by Pert Kelton. The acting and dialogue are fun, but the cinematography and atmosphere just bring it to another level. There are also plenty of nods to actual historical events and figures, from Brodie’s famous jump from the Brooklyn Bridge to an appearance by Temperance leader, Carrie Nation. It genuinely feels like time traveling to a different era. You can see a lot of inspiration for Scorsese’s Gangs of New York here – even down to the warring volunteer fire brigades. Watching this even made a lot of old Looney Tunes cartoons make a lot more sense (what a surreal experience to be watching a movie from the 1930s about the 1890s and have it retroactively make cartoons from the 1940s you watched in the 1990s make sense now in the 2020s). Balled together, it’s a fantastic bit of old New York mythmaking and history. It won’t be for everyone maybe, but I absolutely loved this movie and the all but forgotten world it depicts.\n\nRate this:\n\nMore movies. All the time.\n\n21. This stilted Italian sword-and-sorcery schlock is aided by Mario Bava’s far-out colors and lighting. It’s Hercules in the Haunted World (1961). It’s got its moments – one of the few appearances of Procrustes (a hilariously specific villain with my favorite arbitrary rules in Greek mythology…in this movie he’s also a rock monster for some reason). But mostly, it’s a snoozer. Sorry, Reg Park, but my heart belongs to Lou Ferrigno.\n\n20. The Ten (2007) is an anthology comedy film from the people behind Wet Hot American Summer and The State that sends up each of the Ten Commandments. Krzysztof Kieślowski’s Dekalog, this is not. It’s not as funny as the other projects these guys have worked on either. It’s a hit and miss, somewhat dated comedy with an all-star cast and a handful of funny moments. We watched it as a goof.\n\n19. I love me some classic Hammer horror, monstrous ghouls, and Caroline Munro. That said, Captain Kronos – Vampire Hunter (1974) isn’t one of the more memorable combinations of these normally delectable ingredients. These characters are not great at their job. The suave Captain Kronos and his hunchbacked scientist sidekick take their blessed time catching a soul-sucking vampire. There’s some mystery about the vampire’s identity and how to kill it…which is really dragged out. The action doesn’t really start until the very end. You could watch this…or you could watch Fearless Vampire Hunters instead (a bit sharper and much better theme song).\n\n18. The woods looks creepy enough in this well acted horror flick. The Ritual (2017) has atmosphere, good chemistry between its actors, and a wonderfully unique creature design…but it doesn’t do much and isn’t really scary. I love monsters. So why does this lose me once the monster actually shows up? A big, goofy monster that just spikes you onto a tree branch because of cult stuff just isn’t that scary. Perhaps worth checking out because everything leading up to the finale is very well done.\n\n17. Seth Rogen gives a wonderfully watchable performance as an Eastern European immigrant from 1919 who accidentally brines himself and wakes up 100 years into the future in An American Pickle (2020). Rogen also plays the man’s great grandson. The premise is marvelously whimsical and unique and poised to do amazing things…but ultimately gets rather squandered, quickly devolving into a story of petty tit for tat revenge between two characters that could have been anybody. When it’s tender and when it’s weird and fully unpacking the concept of confronting your heritage, it shines. I really wanted to like this one more. This concept deserves more. But even at its most uninspired, it still has a woolly Rogen doing a fun accent.\n\n16. God and Satan are on a train as the porter shows them stories of humans at their most depraved, and they bicker over whose soul belongs to them. This is Night Train to Terror (1985), a bonkers Z-grade horror anthology that makes absolutely no sense. And then I learned that it’s actually three separate movies that were edited down to be one single film (couched in a ham-fisted cosmic framing device). I found most of the stories cheap, sleazy, and hard to follow. Just the way I like it sometimes. It’s got some interesting ideas (I thought the death cult in story 2 was a neat premise) and some wonky stop-motion effects. At the end of the night, it’s only mostly a waste of time. The film even makes fun of its own hapless viewers with the repeated rock stanza: “Everybody’s got something to do. Everybody, but you!”\n\n15. In the wake of the success of Smokey and the Bandit, Sam Peckinpah attempts to capture the spirit of the American trucker movie with Convoy (1978), starring Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw, and Ernest Borgnine. Something about the 70s, man. These movies made the trucker lifestyle look like the coolest, sexiest, most American thing you could possibly do. While Convoy starts off pretty strong – several trucker buds are on the run after beating up some bad cops in a glorious bar brawl – the plot gets a more complicated than perhaps necessary and loses a lot of momentum and direction once the convoy actually starts. Like An American Pickle, I was in love with what this movie could have been.\n\n14. Sir Ralph Richardson is a sinister crypt-keeper who shows a few lost souls some piercing glimpses into their sordid selves in the original adaptation of Tales from the Crypt (1972). Based on the EC horror comics, this fright flick runs the gamut of typical morality tales of terror. Hammy acting and Chick Tract-esque simplicity aside, it’s an effective relic of horror anthology history that boasts some nice camerawork and a heartbreakingly adorable performance from Peter Cushing. You gotta love the clever titles for all the sequences when the credits role. A far better and more coherent – if a bit more conservative – entry into the genre than Night Train to Terror.\n\n13. I’m not sure if I’ve seen a movie more hellbent on breaking down the methods of subtle deception within nonfiction filmmaking. Well, Orson Welles’ F for Fake, maybe. But here it is used to also show how the very way we talk about the past has the same manipulations of framing. Further Beyond (2016), directed by Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor, presents itself initially as a documentary about an Irish adventurer named Ambrose O’Higgins who traveled to Chile in the 18th century. As it goes, however, it also becomes, simultaneously, a deconstruction of the artifice of the presentation itself. You get sucked into the way we tell stories and recount the past and ponder on the mechanics of documentary filmmaking. The limited budget is far from an impediment here. It’s a gentle little film that tucks you in for bed under a cozy blanket while reassuring you that everything is, in fact, only one version of reality.\n\n12. Robert Mitchum might be one of the few men capable of staring down and intimidating the stately Gregory Peck. Mitchum’s casting as the chilling ex-con, Max Cady, out for revenge against the lawyer (Peck) who put him away – not to mention the moody black-and-white photography – are what make Cape Fear (1962) a classic thriller. The movie really taps into primal fears, as well as the frustration of feeling impotent to stop the evil that is encroaching with ice cold calculation. The ever-present threat of physical and sexual violence is palpable. Peck’s character is a bit of an idiot and his plan is cockamamie, reckless, traumatizing, and results in a murder and the movie sort of sidesteps all that because, hey, a man’s gotta do anything he can to protect his family, I guess.\n\n11. I remember catching this on TV a lot as a kid. Re-watching City Slickers (1991) now that I’m closer to Billy Crystal’s age in the film, I get it even more. It’s the quintessential male mid-life crisis movie. Three buddies (Crystal, Daniel Stern, and Bruno Kirby) go for a two week cattle drive adventure. This naturally leads to several comic moments and some harrowing personal growth. It’s at its best when the guys are just riffing about life and making snarky remarks that reveal their character. Jack Palance is perfectly cast as the tough-as-nails cowboy, Curly, who imparts his sage wisdom that the secret to life is just one thing. It’s an enjoyable and still funny comedy from a bygone age – the early 90s.\n\n10. Gave Monster House (2006) another watch with some kids. It’s just a real efficient little Halloween kiddie horror. The spooky old house in a quiet neighborhood eats people. And three kids have to stop it. I like that essentially it’s all set on one street. Cut the fat. Get to the house being creepy. Some funny lines and clever plot elements help it along. It’s simple, smooth, and fun. The motion-capture may come off as a bit of a weird choice, but it just sort of adds an extra layer of surreality. The character design feels like your on mushrooms.\n\n9. Peter Weir’s Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) is an eerie shaggy dog mystery about missing girls from a fancy schmancy Australian school in 1900. It’s a slow-moving, trancelike yarn that is pleased to meander and stop…and then meander some more as we observe various characters reacting to the tragic disappearance. It is a little comical to me that everybody is only ever concerned about Miranda because she’s the hot one.\n\n8. I’ll come clean. This is pretty cheesy, but what can I say? I’m a sucker for pulpy pre-Code 1930s genre movies. Chandu the Magician (1932) is as absurd as its title suggests. A white guy (Edmund Lowe) has trained for years in India to learn the ancient arts of astral projection, teleportation, and general magical trickery and discovers that the yogis that trained him want him to stop an evil mastermind named Roxor (played by Bela Lugosi) who has kidnapped his mad scientist brother-in-law in order to use his death ray to conquer the world. All of this is laid out in the first two minutes. Chandu’s also got a crush on an Egyptian princess. This is the type of exotic nonsense movie that tells its story efficiently and with some good atmosphere and does not overstay its welcome.\n\n7. We absolutely loved Twin Dragon Encounter. Two good old Canadian boys with lustrous mustaches and a martial arts studio take their girlfriends camping in Ontario and wind up going toe to toe with an adorable group of militia men with a nebulous agenda. It’s such a perfectly lovable bad movie that just makes you feel good. Naturally, we had to see the sequel. The McNamara boys are back in Dragon Hunt (1990). The budget is bigger. There are establishing shots and close-ups now. It employs Eisentstein’s montage theory to evoke feelings and create tension. And this movie has stakes. It’s wonderfully great fun. The bad guy from the first film is back and he’s got a metal hand. He wants revenge. So he sets up an insanely elaborate plan to capture the McNamaras and force them to do a sort of Most Dangerous Game scenario where they have to defend themselves against wave after wave of ninjas and beefy boys. This sequel doesn’t have the innocence and sweetness of the original. The twins actually kill people in this one. A lot of people. Brutally. They straight up harpoon a labradoodle with a makeshift spear and leave it to bleed out to death. It does get a little tiring by the end, but it’s always good to be back up in the Muskoka woods with the boys and their thick, thick mustaches.\n\n6. Where have you been all my life, Phantasm (1979)? Directed by Don Coscarelli, this cult horror favorite boasts a bunch of fun and original ideas. Grave robbing! The Tall Man! Flying death orbs! Other dimensions/planets(?)! Either this is exactly your kind of thing or it isn’t. I won’t say too much, but I definitely want to see the rest of the movies in the Phantasm universe.\n\n5. I dug Midsommar, but was intimidated to watch Ari Aster’s earlier film, Hereditary (2018). Mainly because I knew it would be depression horror, which I find can be emotionally draining. Maybe I was just in the right headspace, but this slow-burn horror flick hit every intended mark upon my viewing. I felt sick, sad, disgusted, horrified, and genuinely impressed with the performances (particularly Toni Collette, who absolutely brings it). It kept me guessing with clever surprises and twists all the way to the end. It is an extremely well-crafted film with equal portions tragedy and terror, and I’m glad I finally got around to it.\n\n4. Like good drugs, a lot of what makes a movie great or special is the set and setting of the viewer at the time of viewing. And holy cow, did The Keep (1983) meet me just right. Genuinely a spiritual experience at the time. It’s flawed and messy, sure, but it’s got a weird hold on me now. We went in expecting a sort of Cannon style Indiana Jones horror knockoff. Instead, we got a WWII supernatural thriller retelling of the Golem legend with complex moral and religious themes and a wonderfully entrancing, and willfully anachronistic, Tangerine Dream score. It doesn’t all quite come together and a lot of things are left unexplained (I later learned that Michael Mann’s original cut was 210 minutes long, so the hour and a half version isn’t exactly the whole story), but that kind of almost lends itself to the ethereal mystery of this curious creation. Great locations. Great monster. Features Scott Glenn, Ian McKellen, Jürgen Prochnow, and Gabriel Byrne.\n\n3. Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Cher play three single small town women just starting to realize that they might have some magical powers in George Miller’s The Witches of Eastwick (1987). Their chemistry is great and they never looked better, and they are abetted by an explosively watchable performance from Jack Nicholson, who plays a mysterious man who arrives out of nowhere to seemingly answer all of the girls’ wishes. Yeah, he’s the Devil. If a sexy fantasy-comedy about women discovering they’re witches and banging Satan before going to war with him (all directed by the guy who did the Mad Max movies) doesn’t interest you, then I guess we’re just different people.\n\n2. With pastiches of Tati and Truffaut, Wes Anderson deftly cobbles together an erudite and visually dense anthology that celebrates art, youth, food, France, and – most importantly of all – journalism. It may be in vogue to critique Anderson’s twee dollhouse aesthetic overwrought in quirky symmetry, but I loved every cakey bite of The French Dispatch (2021). Gorgeous to look at; musical to listen to; overflowing with asides, ampersands, and addendums (both literary and optical). This expensive looking production recounts the death of a French-based American periodical publisher and celebrates his life and journalistic impact through the retelling of several previously published articles (that would appear in the final issue of The French Dispatch). It would be pointless to explain the plot further. It’s not so much what is being said, so much as how it’s being told – a perfect analogue for both the influence of writers on their stories and filmmakers on their films. Style over substance? That’s actually the point. A sprawling cast, charming Alexandre Desplat score, and all the clever, artistic flair you’d expect and more. If you were down with increasingly stylized whimsy of Moonrise Kingdom and Grand Budapest Hotel, then you’re going to enjoy this.\n\n1. Cryptozoo (2021) is exactly the kind of movie I dream of and wait for. Dash Shaw’s earlier film, My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea, was excellent, and this is the perfect follow-up. Imagine a psychedelic Jurassic Park but with the fearless illustrative style of indie comics and vintage pulp sci-fi covers. A zoo for cryptids is under threat and a brave woman and her team must save it, but the imagination behind this film goes well beyond inventive creature design and unconventional animation choices. Cryptozoo deals with themes of exploitation, fetishization, stigmatization, conservation, capitalism, compromise, war, the failure of good intentions, and a world not knowing what to do with the diminishing number of unique things in it. So many ideas and so much visual flourish, all so cleverly and expertly executed. And I cannot say enough nice things about the hypnotic score by John Carroll Kirby. I know when I’ve found my candy, and I know it won’t be for everyone, but Cryptozoo is a rare and precious beast.\n\nRate this:\n\nNot my best haul.\n\n29. My roommates and I decided to watch the Mortal Kombat movies. Whether you love the games or have no idea what they are, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997) is hilariously juvenile garbage. The original feels like it was written by a 10 year old. This sequel feels like it was written by a 6 year old. Who knew the true meaning of a violent fight videogame was friendship?\n\n28. Italian schlock master Luigi Cozzi gives us Contamination (1980). It’s a bit murky and slow, but the uniqueness here is that alien eggs are being smuggled into the US from the South America like cocaine. It’s an alien egg cartel. It’s an odd move, but kind of funny and fascinating. Also, people’s guts explode out of their bodies if the egg goo gets on them.\n\n27. A man anthropomorphizes an oblivious cephalopod to assemble a narrative and justify his family abandonment in the lackluster documentary My Octopus Teacher (2020).\n\n26. Da 5 Bloods (2020) is one of the Spike Lee movies that, for me, is tonally inconsistent and completely forgettable. Delroy Lindo is pretty good though.\n\n25. I never saw the first movie, but somehow I don’t think that would have helped make much sense of Hello, Mary Lou: Prom Night II (1987). It’s got some classic prom slasher bits, but it’s arguably more unhinged and harder to follow.\n\n24. Italian filmmakers imagine a distant future where comically ridiculous gangs have overrun New York City in The Bronx Warriors (1982). It’s dumb and dopey and kind of what you want from this sort of thing. Fred Williamson is the best part as the gang leader, Ogre.\n\n23. Mortal Kombat (1995) is schlock for children, but it has a decent set up, some nice set design, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is absolutely owning every scene he is in as Shang Tsung. Recast Christopher Lambert and a few of the other characters, give the plot a bit more shape, and establish the tournament rules and the stakes a bit better, and this could have been pretty good.\n\n22. Cemetery Man (1994) is maybe five movies at once? Rupert Everett is a cemetery groundskeeper who must battle the undead when they emerge from the grave. If this was the whole movie that would have been enough. But then he keeps falling in love with women who look alike. The zombies plot kind of goes away. We follow his oafish sidekick being in a relationshio with a dismembered teen zombie head and then somehow we were in a snow-globe the whole time? Also, this is visibly Italy and everyone’s name is very Italian and yet everyone involved in intensely British. Does any of it work? Hard to tell. Cemetery Man is something else.\n\n21. Foxcatcher (2014) is everything I don’t want in a based-on-true-events movie. It has a distractingly famous actor cast against type in weird makeup doing a funny voice. It is slow and mostly uneventful. And it doesn’t shed any light on the actual events. But it is well shot and decently acted, so there is some craft here. Just wish it had been more.\n\n20. Finally. A slasher flick about New Year’s. New Years Evil (1980) is a laughably bad thriller that misguidedly makes the killer the protagonist (even if the movie doesn’t seem to think so). A maniac decides to kill someone at midnight in every American time zone, leading up to his confrontation with a punky radio hostess in California. Had the hostess or the detective been given more character, it could have elevated the plot and the stakes.\n\n19. You have to really like sleazy schlock to get behind Slave Girls from Beyond Infinity (1987), a tongue-in-cheek sci-fi retelling of The Most Dangerous Game but with scantily clad buxom bimbos.\n\n18. I grew up loving Laurel and Hardy. They were a truly legendary comedy duo. Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly do amazing jobs at portraying them in Stan and Ollie (2018), even if the film may falter in showcasing why they were so great.\n\n17. Facebook is bad. Our data is harvested for nefarious purposes. We are mentally and emotionally killing ourselves. It’s The Social Dilemma (2020), a documentary that confirms all of your deepest held suspicions just like the algorithms have ordained.\n\n16. Gretel & Hansel (2020) looks amazing. Fantastic visuals and atmosphere. It also needed a few rewrites to bring the characters to life. Worth checking out for Alice Krige as the witch and the sumptuous cinematography.\n\n15. I’m a stranger to the Jason movies. I’ve seen the original and Jason X. So watching Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985) was a confusing endeavor. Cartoonier than I was expecting, not scary or gory, and the twists were admittedly surprising, but don’t all seem to add up. But it’s Halloween and it’s a breezy, fun slasher flick with a high body count. Have at it.\n\n14. Ken Russell tells the tale of the night Mary Shelley stayed at Lord Byron’s house and was inspired to write Frankenstein. Gothic (1986) may not go down easy or make much sense, but it’s a wild, sweaty, frenetic, haunted sex house with enough movement to keep you entertained.\n\n13. I’m a sucker for samurai movies and putting Toshio Mifune in the wild west is just about perfect (even if the film foolishly makes Charles Bronson the main focus). Red Sun (1971) is a typical cowboy movie with buried treasure, quests for revenge, uneasy alliances, and lots of brothels. Ursula Andress co-stars.\n\n12. Robert Z’Dar, Tom Atkins, and Bruce Campbell star in Maniac Cop (1988), a cheesy slasher flick that asks the adorably dated question: “What if a cop was bad?”\n\n11. Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2019) is a documentary that traces the generational journey of wealth and power. It’s both a good history lesson and an prescient warning. Pair this with some Noam Chomsky interviews for a real uplifting time.\n\n10. Sacha Baron Cohen grows his mustache back for another look at aspects of American culture in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (2020). While not as barbed and piercing as the original 2006 film, it makes up for a dearth of incriminating gotchas with the inclusion of Maria Bakalova as his daughter discovering herself. The narrative is stronger and the written jokes are solid, even if the raw interviews don’t hit as hard as they did in Da Ali G Show or Who Is America? This was a welcome dose of comedy at just the right time\n\n9. Deaundra T. Brown may be the female Neil Breen. And if that sounds interesting to you then watch Diamond Cobra vs. White Fox (2015) immediately. We went down a rabbit hole and watched most of her music videos and discovered she has a glut of other movies she made.\n\n8. Werewolfism is a metaphor for female puberty in the edgy teen body horror, Ginger Snaps (2000). It’s funny, spooky, and Emily Perkins and Katherine Isabelle are fantastic as the leads.\n\n7. Life can be hard when you’re homeless. Fortunately, you can always race shopping carts down mountains in Vancouver. The documentary Carts of Darkness (2008) gives us a peek into the lives of several down-on-their-luck men and the one, crazy thing that gives them joy.\n\n6. Spike Lee’s Blackkklansman (2018) is a superb crime drama based on a true story. Two cops (John David Washington and Adam Driver) go undercover to spy on the Klan. Heartfelt, harrowing, and prescient filmmaking.\n\n5. George C. Scott moves into a haunted house after losing his wife and daughter in a freak car accident in The Changeling (1980). This is how you do a haunted house movie. The house itself has character, the mystery twists and turns, and the séance scene is wonderfully creepy.\n\n4. David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet (2020) might be the 94 year old broadcaster’s last testimony. In this documentary, he reveals the depletion of the natural world he has witnessed just within his lifetime. This is an important film for our times. I just hope we can implement some of the solutions in time.\n\n3. The Quiet Earth (1985) may just be the best last-man-on-earth apocalyptic movie I’ve seen. Brilliantly acted and appropriately weird. The score is great.\n\n2. F. W. Murnau’s Faust (1926) is a visual feast to behold. Malevolent, humorous, and moralizing. Fans of silent film cannot skip this telling of the tale of the man who made a deal with the Devil.\n\nI said I’m a sucker for samurai films. And, biases aside, Masaki Kobayashi’s Harakiri (1962) is a goddamn perfect movie. A noble house is beset by beggars threatening to commit seppuku at their gates in the hope that the samurai will give them some money. It’s a simple set up, but this drama’s plot is tight as a drum and raises the stakes quickly and employs such delicious twists and turns that I’d find it hard for a cinephile not to love.\n\nRate this:\n\nOnce again, I collect and rank the last several films I saw. Some I really loved. A lot were interesting and inadvertently humorous. None I hated. Film is subjective. These lists are a celebration of that.\n\nEnjoy. And, as always, if you have a recommendation for me… give it to me.\n\n24. Full Moon Features sure knows how to make one hell of a trailer. They produced a lot of schlocky horror flicks that, sadly, don’t always measure up to their ads or nifty concepts. Lurking Fear (1994) is the story of a man fresh out of prison who goes to dig up money buried with a corpse on a spooky, stormy night. Too bad for him that naughty gangsters are also after the money. And also a cadre of ghoul hunters are chilling at the same cemetery, hoping to finally end the evil reign of these ill-defined creatures once and for all. Also a pregnant woman. It’s a mess, but has some OK atmosphere and Jeffrey Combs is in it and he’s always fun to watch.\n\n23. The movie with the infamous “Garbage day!” scene. Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 (1987) is a bad movie held together by the even more laughably bad performance by Eric Freeman. He absolutely makes this movie. The first third of the film is a rehashing of the first film. They use lots of footage from the original. It’s like movie SparkNotes. So you can skip the first one. It looks bad, but not nearly as fun. Mean nuns. Murderous Santas. A bland horror tale of revenge with some laugh out loud moments.\n\n22. Evilspeak (1981) is the classic story about a bullied nerd (Clint Howard) at a military academy who discovers a Satanic library in the basement and uses computers to help him summon demons to get revenge. It’s got a few pretty memorable scenes (mostly involving violence and murder), but it feels long in the middle when the movie has teased us enough and we just want to see the Carrie styled bloodbath.\n\n21. I love cowboy westerns and have always disliked John Wayne. He’s good in a couple movies (True Grit, Stagecoach), but he’s just one of those iconic actors that never made a positive impression on me. But this movie has Maureen O’Hara and a pretty straightforward plot. I had seen Big Jake (1971) as a kid and caught it again recently. Some decent shootouts and suspense. He’s just trying to rescue his kidnapped grandson.\n\n20. Highway to Hell (1991) is a fantastically dark action-horror concept mired by the filmmakers insisting it be a lowbrow comedy. Our young protagonist’s girlfriend gets kidnapped by a literal cop from Hell. The rest of the movie is the adventure through Hell (looking a lot like the American Southwest) and onto Hell City to get her back. Because it plays so silly and cutesie, the stakes never feel that high and most of the comedy does not really work (unless Gilbert Gottfried playing Hitler in a cameo is hilarious to you). There are a few fun special effects here and there, but ultimately there’s not enough visually to make Hell feel like much more than a sunny stretch of highway in Arizona.\n\n19. Robot Holocaust (1986) is a straight awful movie. Terrible sets. Even worse costumes. And the acting! The main villainess delivers her lines like she is just coming off anesthesia. It’s no Starcrash, but we laughed a lot and sometimes that’s all I ask for in my sci-fi schlock.\n\n18. Pumpkinhead (1988) is not great, but I admire that it does try to be different. When a man’s young son is accidentally killed by vacationing teens, he goes to a witch to make a deal and perform the rites needed to conjure the demon known as Pumpkinhead. Lance Henikson plays the tortured father who becomes linked with the monster he has unleashed. The practical effects of the creature and the witch’s swamp are highlights visually.\n\n17. Zoo (2007) is that documentary about the guy who died from having sex with a horse. The film also takes a distant but humanizing look at zoophiles in general and how that underworld sometimes operates in strange corners of society. More pensive than shocking, the movie focuses on individuals rather than go into gruesome detail of the incident. Almost Lynchian.\n\n16. Visually sumptuous, gorgeously ornate costumes, breathtaking locations, and a script so convoluted and incomprehensible you may be scratching your head as to how many rewrites it didn’t get during its infamous 25+ year production history. Terry Gilliam’s cinematic oeuvre creaks from bold, hallucinatory, and inspired to unwieldy and frustrating with indulgent bombast eclipsing anything meaningful. I still rank much of his pre-2000s work among my favorite films, but The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2019) is a problematic and unsatisfying mess that continuously picks up plot threads that don’t really go anywhere. The film has moments of brilliance. When it leans into the fantasy and the adventure aspects, it approaches something, but it’s ultimately a far more cynical, grouchy, and out of touch film that unceremoniously dispatches characters, plot threads, stakes, and messages with awkward weightlessness. What is it all about? What is the story? What is being said? It is very dense and it looks great and has a fine cast (wish Adam Driver’s protagonist had at least one redeeming quality or that we actually felt the magnitude of Jonathan Pryce’s character arc or that the wonderful Olga Kurylenko and Joana Ribiero were more than just eye candy as both have fantastic screen presence). As the more straight Don Quixote elements were the best bits, it makes me wonder how great the film could have been had it been more of a straight adaptation of the famous novel instead of the deeply uninteresting non-redemption story of a cowardly, asshole film director who ruins the lives of those around him. Unless that is the point. How autobiographical is this movie?\n\n15. Behind the Curve (2018) is another documentary. This one takes a look at the flat Earth movement. If you’ve seen any of the thousands of YouTube videos exposing the truth about how our planet is actually flat and everyone is just lying to you…for some reason, then you’re already familiar with the typical arguments and talking points. All of which are easily debunked. Behind the Curve, rather than focus on the wacky claims put forth, instead chooses to make the viewer more intimate with the personalities behind the movement. Sure, they’re all a bit delusional and seem to hold more than a few bizarre beliefs for similarly baffling reasons, but behind that glazed look in their eye is an inquiring human mind that has maybe just gone astray. The movie doesn’t go out of its way to challenge their claims. It just gives them enough rope to hang themselves. The hubris and myopia are real things that effect us all. If you’re interested in cults, conspiracy theories, and how people can get sucked into those worlds and stay there, it’s an interesting peek into that space.\n\n14. For low-key horror films, Green Room (2015) almost succeeds in being brilliant. A broke punk band gets a gig playing in an old barn in the woods that just happens to be a hub for neo-Nazis. That should be enough to get the ball rolling, and had it been it I think this movie would have been a lot more satisfying. There’s an added plot of a murdered man (Anton Yelchin’s character sees too much) and then the Nazi leader (Patrick Stewart) shows up to contain it all. Had it just been the fact that punks were duped into performing there and that their onstage anti-fascist antics incite the white supremacist mob to violence, I think things would have been much more streamlined and interesting. But it seemed the movie was almost uncomfortable with just saying that Nazis are bad in and of themselves. As is, it’s decent. Better than a lot of horror in the same vein. But could have been great.\n\n13. Mystics of Bali(1981) wastes no precious time in getting into it. An attractive American girl wants to learn the most powerful magic there is. For some reason. Her Filipino friend (who she continues to tease with the promise of a relationship) agrees to introduce her to a witch in the jungle. She meets the witch, but the witch only wishes to use the foolish girl. She turns the girl into a penanggalan: a traditional Filipino floating vampire head with all of the internal organs hanging out the neck. This is more than just a bad a movie. It’s wonderfully weird. It’s slow to get going, but once the nonsense begins, it keeps going until we learn that white women, like jungle witches, are not to be trusted and that if you have one magic uncle and he dies, don’t worry. You probably have another, more powerful ghost uncle to save the day.\n\n12. “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” Michael Pollan takes on a journey into America’s diet. In Defense of Food (2015) covers a lot of basic stuff, but it does so in such an engaging and open way that it pulls you in. From the history of manipulative health language in advertising to the villages of small African tribes that live as organically as possible, Pollan is eager to discover what we should eat and how we can enjoy the food we eat.\n\n11. Just look at that still. That is amazing. Motel Hell (1980) is the best Texas Chainsaw Massacre knockoff you can find, I’d wager. Human heads popping out of the ground like vegetables. A cannibal bed and breakfast. A pig headed chainsaw duel. This movie is cheap, fast, and hits you just when it needs to. Like greasy fast food.\n\n10. Luigi Cozzi’s The Adventures of Hercules(1985) is a sword and sorcery sequel that has wacky Italian production written all over it. We really wanted to watch the original with Sybil Danning (Howling 2), but we had to make do. Lou Ferrigno stars as the mighty son of Zeus. It’s very episodic and most of the scenes are clunky exposition for how to solve a problem that will be solved within the next three minutes. It’s wonderfully, watchably schlocky. I’m pretty sure they rotoscoped the t-rex battle from the original King Kong for the constellation fight at the end. It’s great and I can’t wait to find the first Hercules.\n\n9. Mark Duplass plays a man with terminal cancer. Ray Romano is his somewhat socially awkward neighbor. Together they go on a short road trip to pick up some medically prescribed suicide pills. This is Paddleton (2019). It’s a quiet and low-key dramedy that keeps its distance and deals with a difficult subject in a straightforward and sensitive way. Romano is perfectly cast.\n\n8. Shallow Grave (1994) is a sly little film about three roommates (Ewan McGregor, Kerry Fox, and Christopher Eccleston) in Edinburgh and it was Danny Boyle’s directorial debut. When their new roommate dies in the flat, the trio aren’t sure what to do. Mainly because it turns out he had a suitcase full of money. How does one dispose of a body? How long before they can spend the money? What happens if someone comes looking for it? What happens if you can no longer trust your close friends? Streamlined and efficient black comedy.\n\n7. Harmony Korine (Gummo) assembles one wacky cast (Matthew McConaughey, Isla Fisher, Snoop Dogg, Zac Efron, Martin Lawrence, Stefania LaVie Owen, Jonah Hill, and Jimmy Buffet) in The Beach Bum (2019). It’s the story of a Key West hippie, poet, and stoner (perhaps a redundant collection of words) and his meandering life. You could say it’s about him trying to get money, but that wouldn’t be quite right. It’s more about a wandering spirit that moves in any direction it pleases. I may prefer Spring Breakers for its bolder presentation and harrowing, unpredictable story, but The Beach Bum, while far more subdued and accessible, still boasts plenty of visual style. Like most of Korine’s work, it’s a fascinating glimpse into another American subculture.\n\n6. Holy moly did I love Fright Night (1985). It’s like the perfect 80s movie. Great soundtrack. Great cast (Chris Sarandon, Amanda Bearse, and Roddy McDowell are so much fun). And some of the best vampire deaths ever filmed. What is a boy to do when a sexy vampire moves in next door? Call his local skeptical horror movie TV presenter and slay him! Genuinely loved this campy, sexy, spooky, fun flick.\n\n5. Rashida Jones composes a beautiful biographical documentary of her talented father in Quincy (2018). Quincy Jones is one of the most important names in modern American music and music production. This movie is a loving portrait of the man, his life, his troubles, his flaws, and his amazing contributions to the world of music.\n\n4. Art is a weird sort of thing. Struggle: the Life and Lost Art of Szukalski (2018) is a documentary about discovering an eccentric Polish genius lives right around the corner. From this beginning, we launch into a retrospective of the life of sculptor and esoteric artist Stanislav Szukalski (1893-1987). He’s an odd, little old man, when the film introduces him. Underground comic artists and LA hippies develop a keen fascination in him and then they discover he was actually one of the most important sculptors and possibly the greatest Polish artist of the 20th century. And he’s a bit of a character.\n\n3. Netflix has been running Love Death Robots. It’s a brilliant concept with some amazing artistry, but, in my opinion, some lackluster writing and, ultimately, I did not like the series. I do hope they push it and get better if they continue. Robot Carnival (1987) is the animated robot anthology that I wanted. Each segment is handled by a different director. Some stories are soft and poetic. Others are bombastic and raucous. I loved the visual richness and inventive styles and mesmerizing stories. Like all anthologies, you’ll have your favorites. This had been on my radar for a long time and I’m glad I finally watched it.\n\n2. Animator Nina Paley left a very good impression on me with Sita Sings the Blues. I had to applaud its humor, style, novel implementation of music, and narrative inventiveness. Seder-Masochism (2018) is a musical epic comedy brimming with clever satire and incendiary religious commentary while packaged in a bright, colorful package. The story takes Nina’s curious goat character interviewing her Jewish father about her upbringing and juxtaposes it against her retelling of the history of religion, from early man’s worship of feminine Earth mothers to the violent conquest of patriarchal monotheism and into the present day of continual bloodshed over holy real estate. It covers a lot of ground and has a lot of hot takes that may upset or tickle you, but with the lively animation and tunes, it’s a breath of fresh air.\n\n1. I know I’ve seen the Sidney Lumet masterpiece 12 Angry Men (1957) before, but I on a whim I gave it a re-watch, and seeing it again with adult eyes made me reassess its greatness. It’s a tough feat to set a whole movie in one room and keep the dramatic beats going and create visual distinctiveness within acts. A lot of these points come down to staging, lighting, and cinematography. But it also has a fantastic script and is wonderfully cast. Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden, E. G. Marshall, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Joseph Sweeney, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, Jiří Voskovec, Robert Webber, and Edward Binns are twelve men locked in a jury room, tasked with determining the fate of a young man who has been charged with the murder of his father. The atmosphere is tense from the get go and only tightens as the men debate and talk out the whole meaning of “reasonable doubt” and what their duty is as jurors. The twists, summer heat of the setting, and character quirks keep the drama electric. 12 Angry Men is an American classic and a very patriotic film in the sense that it depicts the ideals of what this one aspect of the judicial system was meant to be. It is inspiring. Lumet, director of Network, Serpico, The Verdict, and Dog Day Afternoon brought this stage play to cinematic life with confidence and finesse. This is a classic for good reason and marvelous lesson in writing, acting, and filmmaking.\n\nRate this:\n\nMore movies of any stripe ranked against each other in an exercise in arbitrariness!\n\nSorry, guys. There’s a LOT of pretty disappointing ones on this list.\n\n21. Bats(1999) is the worst kind of creature feature. Lazy, tedious, too expository, and not nearly enough funny special effects. The bat noises are funny and so are some of the puppets. But this makes Eight-Legged Freaks look like a masterpiece of horror.\n\n20. Conquest (1983) is unwatchable. Seriously. I didn’t even finish it. It’s unwatchable. And I mean that in a few different ways. For one, the protagonists have negative charisma and are impossible to like. Two, every scene features drab, gray characters in a drab, gray world annoyingly back-lit to the point of silhouette and consistently obfuscated by plumes of smoke/mist coming from…somewhere. Directed by Lucio Fulci (Don’t Torture a Duckling and A Woman in Lizard’s Skin), this is an unpleasant looking Italian-Mexican-Spanish co-production mercifully featuring at least some nudity and some creative violence. I actually dug the character design of the villainous (a topless, cavewoman g-string clad figure with a big, golden head and covered in snakes. Bold. Tacky. Completely insane). It’s artier than much of the artless sword-and-sorcery epics of this era, but it’s pretty bad. And smoky.\n\n19. Running Free (1994) is the story of a clinically obnoxious 12 year old boy and the wolverine who loved him. It’s the sort of family adventure ilk my mother would have let me borrow from the library. Sure, the acting is bad and the general plotlessness is laughable, but they did have a helicopter, at least one good explosion, a decent plane crash, and the beautiful Alaskan wilderness as their backdrop. It’s a coming-of-age tale that’s an insult to the intelligence of 12-year-olds everywhere. Most of those crappy direct-to-video movies I did rent back in the day had a lot more going for them.\n\n18. After Conquest, I thought maybe Barbarian Queen (1985) might be a bit better. And although it was largely a totally artless skin flick with lackluster action, the female cast was attractive (in an aggressively objectifying way) and you could actually see what was happening in each shot due to not having smoke everywhere. Barbarian Queen is problematic in several other ways, but the visibility inches this Argentinian production ahead of Conquest. It at least gave us some laughs while it made us feel completely filthy for watching it.\n\n17. Tae-bo legend Billy Blanks stars in a truly awful sci-fi action movie about a school for assassins that trains its members with embarrassingly realized virtual reality. Expect No Mercy (1995), if the title tells you anything, is a nondescript and dull flick that could be about anything. “Expect no mercy” isn’t even a decent tagline. There are a few scenes that are laughably fun, but not enough to warrant a re-watch anytime soon. Spoiler alert: I did shed a tear for the iguana guy.\n\n16. Geena Davis stars as a pirate queen and already you see what’s wrong. Cutthroat Island (1995) is a swashbuckling adventure comedy infamous for being a flop and bankrupting a studio. There is production value and, genuinely some of the action sequences are executed very well. The big problem with this is tone. Davis and co-star Matthew Modine have no chemistry and Modine is given the task of speaking entirely in awkward smart-ass remarks that are meant to infuse his character with charm and charisma, but accomplish just the opposite. It’s miscast and too long, but you gotta give credit for the location cinematography and lavish sets and props to Davis to doing a lot of her own stunts. Almost every scene has a hundred extras in it, all intricately adorned in period buccaneer garb. Maybe it’s because I’ve been on a Xena: Warrior Princess kick, but had they cast Lucy Lawless and Bruce Campbell this could have been fire.\n\n15. TerrorVision(1986) is a horror comedy that’s running of cheese-factor fumes. An extra-terrestrial monster (the Hungry Beast) is mistakenly beamed down to Earth via a Floridian’s new satellite dish. The slimy, grotesque creature materializes out of television sets to gobble up members of the cartoony Putterman family. Where They Live and The Stuff used science-fiction/horror to create clever social satires on the state of American consumerism, TerrorVision is content to just be a dumb monster movie. Most of the laughs come from just how over-the-top every single detail of this campy film is. It has one or two pretty decent scenes and some quotable lines, but the tone is just so goofy and gleefully brainless that, although perhaps the filmmakers’ intentions, it disappoints because it always feels like it could have been better. A bit more gore could have elevated it. I did like the ending and the creature was pretty gross. So points for that.\n\n14. Kung-fu and British horror finally get the crossover we didn’t know we wanted until The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires (1974). Hammer Studios teamed up with the Shaw Brothers and the results are a bit of a charming mess. It’s not a great movie, but it’s trashy and silly enough to sort of warm your little heart. Peter Cushing appears once again as vampire hunter Van Helsing, now in China to battle an endless army of vampire zombie slaves. He lets his Chinese counterparts do most of the battling.\n\n13. Taraji P. Henson stars in Proud Mary (2018), a sort of throwback to blaxploitation films like Coffy and Foxy Brown. Mary is an assassin trying to atone for her sins by taking in an orphaned boy. But as the body count rises, Mary’s problems only get more complicated. You can tell there’s love going into this, but the finished result is a somewhat bland film punctuated by moments of style and funk. When it cuts loose and has fun, it’s great and justifies some of the contrivances. It just plays it too safe most of the time.\n\n12. A yearning for nostalgia had me re-watch Disney’s Hercules (1997). You all know it. And I had much the same reaction as an adult as I did as a kid. It’s gorgeously and stylishly animated. James Woods as a snaky car salesman Hades and his demon henchmen, as well as the three fates, are hilarious. The singing muses were fun. And that’s about it. Danny DeVito"
