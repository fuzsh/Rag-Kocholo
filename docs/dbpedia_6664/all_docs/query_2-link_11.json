        "text": "Seattle as I found it in the 1950s\n\nPutting together my best memories, I describe this city as being both “small-town-ish”, as well as ready and willing to grow. Over the decade of the 50s, Seattle matured. I’m hoping some of you want to know how that happened. Older readers may remember events and places as I describe them. For those who are curious, or those whose memories are jogged, be my guest and read ahead!\n\nThe Look and Feel of the City:\n\nLet’s start with the Smith Tower, a hazy white spike amid that sprinkling of lower buildings. It was built by a manufacturer of typewriters named L.C. Smith. (Does Smith-Corona sound any more familiar?) And although you millennials may not remember typewriter keys, ribbons and carbons, you DO still need to know the keyboard of your computers as he laid it out. The Smith Tower, hard to spot in the modern downtown, was said to be the tallest building west of the Mississippi. I especially admired the beautiful, lacy brass elevator cages, with gloved attendants to take you to the top. I don’t know if one can take a ride up to the pyramid-shaped room at the top. The view may be gone, but that room was decorated in a faux-Chinese style, which puzzled me. I think it could be rented for party occasions.\n\nAfter living in Washington D.C. during some tense and stressful years of Congressional loyalty investigations, my husband and I found Seattle a haven of sanity. But mainly there was a youthfulness – even a rawness to the area that was endearing. We joked about how you could roll up the sidewalks in the downtown area after 10 or 11 o’clock on a Saturday night. Liquor was available only by visiting a State Liquor Store. Decent wine was unavailable, and scotch-on-the-rocks became my drink of choice at parties. One descriptive phrase about the city used by new arrivals was “blue stocking.” I’m not certain what it meant, but probably a kind of prim outlook on boisterous behavior of any kind.\n\nOnce we bought our first home on the North end of Capitol Hill and settled down, it was nice having bottles of milk delivered to our door by the dairy, and a “Good Humor” truck pass by with tinkling music in the afternoon. We bought groceries at an A & P store, a national chain standing for The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company. It was not long after we arrived that we began to notice people of color shopping with us and waiting on us in various stores. We had the impression race relations were way ahead of those in the rest of the country. We began falling in love with Seattle.\n\nP l a c e s W i t h E n d u r i n g C h a r a c t e r\n\nPioneer Square and the Pike Place Market\n\nExperienced residents urged us to explore two parts of the city that everyone was extremely proud of. Pioneer Square impressed me as a place where treasures from far and near could be discovered in dusty shops; where highly skilled craftsmen plied their trade. There was no hint of danger. Walking around it was exciting because you could encounter a tiny storefront with things inside you least expected. Being the oldest part of the city, it was both colorful and quietly serious. The rents were low, not all stores were open, but enough customers were drawn to it to support even shops that had very little to sell. One nearby establishment sported a good-sized horse over the main entrance. It sold saddles and riding tack, and perhaps other leather goods. I never patronized it, but noticed it year after year. It may still be there.\n\nNot all areas around Pioneer Square were worth visiting. Blocks further to the south contained a section of dark,empty looking warehouses. I was told they were ‘flop houses’ served by public baths, mostly owned by slum-landlords. Where many art galleries are now located, there were none. The earliest was Foster White, which opened in 1968, when the area experienced a ‘renaissance.”\n\nThe Pike Place Market stalls at the foot of Pike Street somewhat resembled fruit and vegetable stands one encountered driving on country roads. The metal pillars, beams and roofing seemed adequate, but there were no windows. Instead sagging canvas and isinglass panels along the sides, were strung up to keep out drafts and rain. The salespeople appeared bundled up against the dampness resulting from the exposure and the frequent hosing down of the vegetables, flowers and seafood. It didn’t appear there were rented stalls; it was first come, first served. I saw wagons being unloaded in the side alley, a few of them horse-drawn. Many roughened types frequented the aisles and food stands, poor men and women gleaning whatever was thrown away by the food handlers.\n\nMark Tobey’s rendering of the market interior in a night scene, dramatically highlights the technique for which he was famous: ‘white writing.’ Notice the spidery web of white highlights spun over the solidly rendered figures. Tobey is able to tell so much about the space and the individuals crowding the aisles.\n\nWhat made the Pike Place Market colorful were the arrangements of fruits and vegetables. The arrangements seemed to be superior in size and quality to the kind one could grow, although I recall it paid to keep and eye on the clerk, filling a paper bag from the back of the arrangement with specimens of a more normal size. The lunchroom hung over a steep drop to the waterfront, with rather rickety windows, sometimes opened, leaving little between you and the bustling view. At night, sagging wires supplied rows of lights housed in bell-shaped shades. I do recall some buzzing neon signs, one over a shop selling a remarkable variety of teas, but there were few specialty shops, and fish were not being thrown. The levels beneath the market contained a rabbit warren of small shops selling things like coins, Japanese netsuke, even the service of fortune-tellers in curtained rooms. The first level was where the unsavory restrooms were located. These were ‘advertised’ above by a huge hand painted on the wall, pointing a finger down into the dark stairwell.\n\nSkid Road\n\nOther interesting things were pointed out to us. Skid Road was so named because logs used to be literally given a push to slide downhill on a dolly wire, diverted onto waiting rail cars and freighters along the waterfront. That practice is easy to imagine because Seattle’s streets have retained much of the pitch that once gave Skid Road, or mistakenly ‘Skid Row,’ its name. The change of name probably came about because the dock area at the bottom of the incline became the refuge of ‘down-and-outers’ of every kind. That is not the case today but even now, walking down streets such as Seneca, Spring or University is a challenge, especially when wet or frosty.\n\nThe Central Area\n\nBack in the 50s we became aware that one neighborhood along 23rd Avenue south of Madison, was almost exclusively occupied by black families and businesses. What struck us, being Easterners, was that Seattle’s Central Area bore no resemblance to the slums we had been well aware of in Washington DC, even on streets that bordered on the US Capitol grounds. I grew up aware of the run-down uniformity of seemingly endless row-houses in Baltimore. For Seattle’s small black population the Central Area may have been confining, but the houses were on the whole well-maintained and prices within reach for buyers or renters. I point out the more positive aspects of the way it was because since the 90s, with ‘red lining’ formally prohibited, ‘gentrification’ has made real estate in the Central Area highly desirable and rather pricey, not to mention the convenience of its location in the city.\n\nD e f o r e s t a t i o n & R e g r a d i n g\n\nSigns of A Thriving Lumber Industry\n\nSeattle’s economy was historically fueled by lumber mills. Driving north on Route 99, a two-lane road (there was no I-5 until 1963) one encountered several mills, recognizable afar by a familiar smell, after which one saw a huge pile of sawdust, and an area piled high with logs. On the road, one was sure to encounter a logging truck ahead of you, piled high with the trunks of enormous Douglas fir trees. Rigs were scarey to pass, and one could slow for a rig in front of you, only to have another one pass you going the other way! Every now and then, an unbelievably huge trunk — a vestige of the original forest took up most of the room on the rig, meaning one less ‘old growth’ giant, one more huge stump left in the diminished forests.\n\nSeattle’s Seven Hills – As In Ancient Rome\n\nFirst Hill, one of Seattle’s reputed seven hills and the steepest of the lot, was blocking the spread of the city-center, necessitating its removal. In a miracle of sheer civic tenacity, steam shovels and dump trucks dug out untold tons of dirt in 1910. The photographs of holdout houses on what look like ‘table mountains’ are downright dramatic. The regraded area once built up, was humorously designated ‘Pill Hill,‘ being largely the location of hospitals and medical centers then and now.\n\nSome of the names of the other six hills have been modified. There is a lack of agreement on the names, so I’ll name my choice for those who might be curious: Capitol Hill, Queen Ann Hill, Beacon Hill, Yessler Terrace, Denny Regrade, Magnolia\n\nI can add to this recital of Seattle lore, a north/south arterial designated Aurora. I hated it! Driving on it was so chaotic before it was tamed with turn lanes, bus lanes and signage, that I avoided it whenever possible. There were frequent stops and infuriating blockages by those turning left to reach the small shops, only one block deep on either side. Directly behind that block of shops, rose the scraggly remains of what had been tall Douglas fir forests. Obviously the largest trees had been harvested not too long ago, raising the strong suggestion that it was actually a commercial strip carved out of the original forest. Those tree that were left, large by any usual standard, suggested a sad fringe of rejects, clearly seen all over this area in old photographs.\n\nP o r t a g e B a y & t h e U n i v e r s i t y A r e a\n\nThe View from My Home\n\nI propose to just meander around the places I have frequented the most in my long residence in this part of Seattle, and do my best to describe how those places looked and served Seattleites at the time. As I indicated, I live on Capitol Hill, so I’ll start there. Can you identify any buildings? The Medical School? Fisheries? Childrens’ Orthopedic Hospital? There was no 520 ramp across Portage Bay because there was no 520 bridge to the East side because it had yet to be developed. There was the Floating Bridge across Mercer Island, which fueled sales of land and homes there. Some of Seattle’s best architects designed homes there. My husband and I were tempted to buy one of a number of homes built by Paul Hayden Kirk, that was very modern at that time. But then, as now, Mercer Island homes were expensive. Closer to my view, Portage Bay got its name because thick Douglas Fir forests right up to the water’s edge compelled anyone wishing to go from there to Lake Washington to pick up their canoe and carry it overland.\n\nHouses built on Interlaken Boulevard put their kitchens on the ‘view side’ because there was no view due to the trees. In the 50s, the Seattle and Queen City yacht clubs provided covered moorings for a modest number of boats. Getting to Lake Washington was no problem once the “cut” as it was known, opened a channel joining the two bodies of water. The level of the lake was higher than that of Portage Bay, so water gushed under the Montlake Bridge for many months, and property owners around Lake Washington gained precious extensions to their shorelines. The land gained is now lawns, piers and bath houses for Laurelhurst and Windemere neighborhoods. The flow out of the lake continues at a barely perceptible rate, and can be discerned looking down from the Montlake Bridge.\n\nThe Husky stadium in the background with its old single concrete grandstand, had a spiral ramp to reach the seats. Its rebuilt replacement now faces a matching grandstand. I’ll never forget the day in 1987 when the superstructure erected with faulty Korean steel, groaned before collapsing, fortunately allowing workers to get out of the way. Then, it collapsed in a heap. Amazingly, photos were snapped showing it falling down.\n\nMany of you know the University of Washington campus very well. The Meany Hall you know had a predecessor: Old Meany Hall. It was built as part of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Expedition in 1909, named for Edmond S. Meany, Chair of the History Department. When I frequented the hall for concerts during the 50s, it was so dilapidated that some wags claimed it was standing ‘..only out of habit,’ To reach the balcony, I recall mounting a circular staircase with metal handrails. In 1965, campus officials declared the building unsafe after an earthquake, and shuttered it, only to have it burn down a few years later. What you may not have realized is that its absence made the space known as Red Square available, and Red Square gained its distinct ‘San Gimignano’ towers as exhaust vents for the parking garage hollowed out beneath it. The New Meany Hall was opened in 1974.\n\nEdmond Meany must have been quite a guy, because my husband and I spent our first night in Seattle in the Meany Hotel, a modern looking building somewhere around the corner of 45th and Brooklyn. It has been refurbished several times, but still stands as the Hotel Decca. We toasted our arrival here at the Blue Moon Tavern, which has retained its reputation for “cool,” and been designated a historical landmark.\n\nS h o p p i n g\n\nBig Change in Downtown\n\nThe Smith Tower remained the tallest building in downtown Seattle until 1962 when the Space Needle assumed its exalted position of 603 feet. In 1969, the First National Bank building, Seattle’s first ‘skyscraper’ at 630 feet, was called “The Box the Space Needle Came In.” it stood alone in the downtown for several years, until the building boom of the 1980s brought us Martin Selig’s “finger,” giving Seattle the feel of a big city.\n\nBack in the 1950s (it now seems hard to believe)..we used to get ‘dressed up’ to go downtown? And I can guarantee none of you under fifty would be able to name the stores where we shopped. How about The Bon Marche′? (the name is French for ‘good bargain’). That very dependable department store’s name became Macy’s, an equally good department store. But the royalty of the dry goods trade back then was Frederick & Nelson, builder and occupier of that enormous white building (now bearing a ‘Nordstrom’ sign). Why royalty? Frederick & Nelson played a major role in the lives of many well-off Seattleites now in their 70s or older. If you were very good, you would be taken to lunch in the Tearoom (reservations required), all dressed up for a birthday or a special occasion. The food or favors appropriate for the child could be ordered, and occasionally there was a fashion show. As a 40-year old, I ‘modeled’ in a Fall Fashion show. I recall the costume I wore may have been plaid, but I do remember being awed by the fashion department’s laying out of my accessories: matching pumps in MY SIZE! Frederick’s elaborate Christmas windows were magical. We used to drive downtown and either stroll around, or just cruise by the store windows to get a look at them. For children there was Santa’s house in the corner window, with a long line of children eager for a chance to sit on his lap. The parents had the option, a tradition that Nordstrom’s has carried on, of purchasing a photo of that scene. Unfortunately, Frederick & Nelson’s management ran into catastrophic inventory problems, which caused them to close down, and it was sad to witness that multi-storied white building lying vacant for a few years.\n\nWhat About Nordstrom?\n\nI’ve already disclosed that I wear a large size shoe and had been forced to choose from two or three options in shoes, for years. Imagine my delight at finding a shoe store in Seattle that carried my size 11 in quantity! That store was Nordstom’s Shoes...just shoes! It so happened that female members of the Nordstrom family – healthy Swedes- had long feet; hence the large sizes carried in inventory. The original store opened on 2nd Avenue in 1928. A second larger store opened in 1930, and a third opened at 45th and University Way in 1958. Through these years of growth, Nordstrom’s sold only shoes, but when a new generation took over, the sons sought an opportunity to branch out, and this came about when Nordstom’s merged with Best Apparel in 1963. Just as Peck &Peck women’s apparel shops once stood for quality in the 1940s, so Nordstrom’s became the arbiter of fashion after 1963, and gradually shops were opened around the country. We all recall Nordstrom’s grand opening in the old Frederick & Nelson building in 1998.\n\nUniversity Village in the 50s\n\nThe sprawling, thriving shopping center we patronize today began small. I remember parking to shop there when it was sort of a muddy mess! A part of the planned layout in 1955 was taken up by Malmo Nursery, and a large Carnation Milk distribution plant. The QFC liquor store (formerly a Washington State Liquor Store) remains from that plant, while the totally remodeled QFC super store of today, is the third one located there, each bigger than the last. Plans originally called for a large Rhodes department store, which I remember as Lamont’s. What was planned as a bank, was converted to the Barnes and Noble book store, and other shops such as Restoration Hardware. What was originally an ice-skating rink at the back of the property, became a bowling alley where ‘rowdy goings-on’ caused it to be closed down. (Remember! No boisterous behavior permitted back then.)\n\nS e a t t l e: A ‘C u l t u r a l D u s t – B i n ‘?\n\nThat is what Sir Thomas Beecham dubbed our city in 1961, when he came to conduct a Seattle Symphony concert in the Moore Theatre, which served as our concert hall at the time. Boy! That comment really hurt! I vaguely remember visiting the Civic Auditorium, built in 1928, for a wine exposition, but the huge space was more suited to hockey and traveling shows; even the circus! It was gutted and rebuilt the following year as the Seattle Center Opera House. I was so impressed by the color scheme of red and gold. There was a wide, elegant red-carpeted stairway lit by two gold candelabras, that gave one the feeling of “making an entrance,” during intermission when – wonder of wonders there was an actual Bar (serving drinks) at the bottom! We rejoiced that Seattle had kicked its “blue stocking” attitude. The Opera House opened in time for the World’s Fair in 1962.\n\nMusic\n\nWhen we arrived in 1954, the regular conductor of the Seattle Symphony Organization, was highly respected Milton Katims. The orchestra played in the Moore Theatre, on a curtained stage more appropriate for theatre performances. I remember the excitement that flashed through the audience when Katims dashed out from stage Left, and lofted himself into the air, baton in a hand, to land gracefully on the raised podium. The symphony’s quality was beyond dispute, even though there were no women musicians in it for far too many years. Blind auditions, giving women a fair chance, started as late as the 90s. The University of Washington’s fine School of Music gave exciting chamber music and orchestral concerts, not only training young instrumental players, but students of music history as well. Performances took place in their Brechemin Auditorium.\n\nArt and Museums\n\nThe Seattle Art Museum, built in 1936, was a sort of template for the strengths and weaknesses of Seattle’s location, far from the cultural centers in the Mid-west and east coast. It exhibited high quality Asian objects collected by Dr.Richard Fuller in the 1920s, mainly from Japan and China. In this field, Seattle was considered on a par with San Francisco’s Brundage Collection. Of European art, there were very few examples. In fact, photographic transparencies of the most famous paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa or Michael Angelo’s Creation of Adam, were artfully mounted in the main galleries devoted to Renaissance art. In1956 the Kress Foundation portioned out its holdings of high quality paintings, sculptures and ceramics collected after World War II from impoverished European museums and collectors. A condition of receiving Kress works was gallery space in which to install them permanently. Norman Davis, a generous museum patron donated the funds that made it possible for several rooms to be built as a wing for that purpose. The Kress Collection of paintings, sculptures and tapestries representing the history of European art, provided what the museum needed to serve and teach the community in a balanced way.\n\nFor those preferring the comforting qualities of 19th century realist paintings, the Frye Museum was built close to St.James Cathedral by Charles and Emma Frye in 1952 to house their large collection. When I visited It shortly after it had opened, the museum building struck me as modern and interesting. The galleries, on the other hand, contained paintings from a decidedly bygone era, with lots of cows, and costumed peasants. A few paintings stood out, such as Bouguereau’s tender maidens. The Frye has become an exciting place, albeit true to its conservative founders.\n\nThe Museum of History and Industry moved its collections into a building in the Montlake neighborhood in 1952, exhibiting all sorts of artifacts, stuffed animals, documents and photographs. An auditorium provided meeting facilities for many important civic causes. The museum moved into a new, larger home in the south Lake Union area recently.\n\nTheatre\n\nKnown as a ‘theatre town‘ to this day, Seattle supported several theatre companies in the 50s. The Empty Space was literally that, an unmarked second floor loft on E. Pine, with seating of the bleacher variety. In the 50s, we were eager patrons, never knowing what adventurous dramatic form might come next: audience participation, sound effects that shook the rickety building, etc. In a few years the company was able to rent a building at the foot of Queen Anne Hill, which offered a far more traditional proscenium stage experience, treating eager audiences to classic plays. For us, it amounted to a drama education. The Bathhouse Theater by Green Lake also put on major dramas in a very small space. It must have required real ingenuity to carry off some ambitious ones where the action sometimes bordered on the audience’s feet! But my memories of the plays we saw there indicate that they succeeded. Other theatres such as Intiman opened at the time of the Seattle World’s Fair in 1962.\n\nFollowing the lead of other larger cities, Seattle began sponsoring a variety of civic entertainments called Seafair starting in 1950. One big event featured hydroplane races on Lake Washington as well as parades that are still going on. An Aqua Theatre with a large grandstand was built at the far end of Greenlake. It staged an attraction known as the Aqua Follies, combining orchestral concerts, water ballet, stage dancing and comedy. Some shows involved up to 100 performers, including plenty of shapely girls in bathing suits a`la Esther Williams. Seattle’s inclement weather winnowed the crowds over the years, and the installation began to disintegrate. Remnants of it remain.\n\nBeing baseball fans, we soon located Sick’s Stadium down around where Martin Luther King Way now winds its way toward Columbia City. There were open fields in the 1950s. The stadium was built by Emil Sick, owner of Rainier Brewery, and naturally the team’s name was the Seattle Rainiers, Having opened in 1935, the ball field attracted large crowds. We discovered we could find a spot on the grassy slopes overlooking the outfield, and watch the game free of charge on those long, warm summer evenings before we had children.\n\nS e a t t l e C o m e s o f A g e\n\nCentury 21 Exposition later called Seattle World’s Fair\n\nI began this piece by recalling the youth and rawness of this city. During the 1950s it grew and changed (in ways I have tried to describe) during that time. However, in 1962 Seattle took a giant step into the ‘big-time.’ With it’s extensive grounds and substantial buildings (many still in use), the Seattle World’s Fair showcased the city as possessing the taste and drive to mount a world-class exposition. And the world took heed as evidenced by the almost 10 million visitors who came and admired the fair, the city and the larger environment. IT PUT SEATTLE ON THE MAP!\n\nIn 1962, the Space Needle rose to its honored place as Seattle’s icon, towering over 600 ft. above the city. Another attraction was the ‘Bubbleator,‘ a huge elevator made of acrylic glass, assembled to carry 100 people up to the World of Tomorrow. That vast space was divided into dozens of booths, displaying and explaining many of the conveniences we now enjoy. Those are now gone, but on the grounds are the gloriously designed science center, the vast Food Circus with the Monorail train to bring visitors from downtown, a memorial fountain and a respectable size stadium, all still in use. This is to Seattle’s great credit, because many other cities, for expositions held both before and since ours, erected buildings that have lain abandoned and useless."
