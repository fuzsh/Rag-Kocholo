        "text": "When it comes to finding the best kids’ movies, there is certainly no shortage of options to choose from. Paradoxically, the streaming era has not simplified things for parents; the endless assortment means that we often find ourselves asking, How did we end up watching this? There is simply too much, and—let’s face it—too of much of it is junk.\n\nWhile we are the first to admit that screen time is a near-unavoidable part of modern childhood, we also want that screen time to be as educational as it is entertaining. After all, learning about the early years of “talkies” from Singing in the Rain or the intelligence of the octopus from My Octopus Teacher is a highly worthwhile endeavor—not just for our kids, but for us, as well. (And, if the soundtrack is something we don’t mind hearing on repeat, all the better.)\n\nTo that end, here is our list of the best kids’ movies, curated by Vogue editors and writers who are parents, as well as by staffers who remember their favorite youthful viewing with perhaps a little more clarity than the parents. These are generally conceived as guidelines for the under-10 set, but of course check Common Sense Media or another resource to figure out if a film is right for your family. Best of all, these classics—and soon-to-be classics—are so good, you won’t mind watching them, too. Quality time and quality viewing? Now that’s a win-win.\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)\n\nNothing says swashbuckling quite like Errol Flynn swinging on a vine through Sherwood Forest. Growing up we had this movie on VHS—yes, that’s how old I am—and I would watch it on Saturday mornings and then manually rewind it and watch it again. Directed by Michael Curtiz, perhaps better known for a little film called Casablanca, and one in a series of delightful adventure romps featuring Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, this technicolor treat really hits all the bases.—Chloe Malle\n\nSinging in the Rain (1952)\n\nThere’s so much to love in this classic: the “Moses Supposes” song (teach your toddler to talk with that!), Gene Kelly and Debby Reynolds’s supreme tap dancing, and that’s before you get to Donald O’Connor’s wall-climbing adventures. And the hidden weapon: a song you can pull out to make accidentally getting stuck at the playground in a rainstorm into a happy adventure. I’ve tried to interest my kids in all kinds of musicals from the cannon—this is the one that has held their attention the best. And it’s given them a slice of Hollywood history to boot.—Chloe Schama\n\nSnoopy, Come Home (1972)\n\nOf all the movie-musicals that I watched and loved growing up—Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Oliver!—John Huston’s Annie deserves a special mention for three reasons. First, it has a little-girl protagonist and some wonderful dog acting. Second, its musical numbers are still very exciting. (“Hard-Knock Life”! “I Think I’m Gonna Like It Here”! “Let’s Go to the Movies”!!) Third, it introduced me to Ann Reinking, Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters, and Tim Curry, all at the same time. (If you’re like, What? Should kids today know who those people are? My answer to you is yes. No further questions!)—MM\n\nThe Secret of NIMH (1982)\n\nNo one made a better run at dislodging Disney’s animated-film hegemony in the 1980s than Don Bluth. (You probably don’t remember that this was the era of The Fox and the Hound and The Black Cauldron.) In 1982 Bluth and his cadre of fellow Disney defectors made The Secret of NIMH, in which a society of genetically altered rats possessing human-level intelligence comes to the aid of a single-mother mouse whose family is threatened by civilization. Based on a 1971 children’s novel and rejected first by Disney (the company said they already had a mouse), it’s an entirely absorbing, emotionally authentic, and visually rich tale that doesn’t shy away from darker aspects, while very stealthily promulgating principles of mutual aid, community organizing, redistribution of wealth, and the wisdom of elders. Dom DeLuise provides the comic relief as a ditzy, lovelorn crow, paving the way for Robin Williams’s and Eddie Murphy’s star turns as loudmouth Disney-cartoon sidekicks. Four years later, Bluth teamed with Steven Spielberg to bring to life the story of another mouse with gumption—An American Tail, then the highest-grossing non-Disney animated movie ever—followed by 1988’s hit The Land Before Time. Disney felt threatened enough that it released The Little Mermaid the next year, kicking off the Disney Renaissance for the next decade.—Lisa Wong Macabasco\n\nThe Goonies (1985)\n\nWhen a dusty old treasure map is discovered, a group of misfit teens band together to track down the missing pirate’s booty of Captain One-Eyed Willy. Things run amuck after a run-in with the Fratelli family, a trio of outlaws hiding out from the cops. You’ll soon fall for the rambunctious youngsters as they make their way through the subterranean caves of an old coastal restaurant, where an unexpected friend named Sloth is made along the way. Booby traps and skeletons abound as the brave company makes its way under the steadfast leadership of Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin). Included in the cast are Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, Jeff Cohen, Ke Huy Quan, Kerrie Green, and Martha Plimpton. One fun fact from behind the scenes: Director Richard Donner wanted to get authentic on-camera reactions, and forbade the actors from seeing the One-Eyed Willy’s ship, which took two months to build, until the cameras were rolling.—Lauren Sanchez\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro (1988)\n\nWithin the Hayao Miyazaki canon, this is my favorite, and I think the best place to start when you’re exposing your children to the wonders of Studio Ghibli, the Tokyo-based animation studio responsible for producing the Japanese auteur’s films. (You could do a lot worse than simply making your way through his filmography.) Auteur is not too strong a word here; Miyazaki has a singular vision unlike almost anything that has made it, in a mainstream way, into American entertainment—and it’s a poetic, beautiful, sometimes confusing vision that I think presents kids with no less than an alternate way to see the world.—CS\n\nBeetlejuice (1988)\n\nPure, delightfully dark-tinged chaos, Beetlejuice is a movie with severed heads, abundant death, a nightmare desertscape crossed by monster worms, Geena Davis pulling her face off, Alec Baldwin plucking his eyeballs out of his head, a football team of corpses, and Michael Keaton looking like a wino crossed with a zombie, in full comedic fast-twitch flow, trading verbal jabs with Winona Ryder as a suicidal (!) teen who looks exquisitely dressed for a Cure concert. My kids were rapt, rolled with Keaton’s rapid-fire jokes (many of them full of innuendo), and demanded a rewatch as soon as it was over. This is not, needless to say, the kind of movie they make anymore.—Taylor Antrim\n\nHoney, I Shrunk the Kids (1989)\n\nInvention-obsessed Professor Wayne Szalinski (Rick Mornais) stumbles upon a machine that shrinks objects into mere crumbs—a breakthrough until he realizes he accidentally shrunk his and the neighbor’s kids. It’s a wacky plot with an even wackier origin story. Horror director Stuart Gordon came up with the storyline and had to convince Disney to give him a shot. In an interview with TCM, Gordon said, “Disney was worried that I was going to kill all the kids, and I kept saying, ‘No, I’m not going to kill them. But I want the audience to think they might die.’” A death-defying hike through the backyard ensues as the kids make their way back home, dodging lawnmowers, bumblebees, and an unruly scorpion. It was a hit for Disney, raking in $14 million on opening weekend and $222 million globally. Part thrills and part chills, the movie is a classic.—LS\n\nKiki’s Delivery Service (1989)\n\nIn the official record, Kiki’s Delivery Service may exist a half-step below the tier of Hayao Miyazaki’s out-and-out classics (Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro, for instance), but in my household this gentle, charming story of a 13-year-old witch making her way in the world is as essential as it gets. It’s a great watch for younger kids: The Americanized dubbed version features a delightful Kirsten Dunst voicing Kiki and the late Phil Hartman as the voice of her deadpan, no-nonsense cat Jiji (his immortal line, “Pardon me, miss snooty cat,” has become a refrain in my home). The plot is simple: Kiki leaves home for a bustling port city, starts a delivery service where she flies around thrillingly on her broomstick, makes friends, loses her confidence, and then regains it. Warm, beautiful, exciting in its climactic sequences, and unforgettable.—TA\n\nHook (1991)\n\nThis beloved cult classic follows a grown-up Peter Pan, played by Robin Williams, as he seeks to find his children, who were kidnapped by Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). Directed by Steven Spielberg, Never Never Land comes to life—and with it, a family of misfits known as the Lost Boys. Fun Fact: Glenn Close and Jimmy Buffet make surprise cameos as pirates, along with musician Phil Collins, who plays an inspector at the start of the film. Julia Roberts added to the starry cast as Tinkerbell, along with Dante Basco, Maggie Smith, Gwyneth Paltrow, and more.—LS\n\nFernGully: The Last Rainforest (1992)\n\nA curious sixth grader with a penchant for spying on her neighbors is the star player in this coming-of-age dramedy. Based on the children’s book written and illustrated by Louise Fitzhugh, Harriet (Michelle Trachtenberg) all too quickly discovers what can happen when secrets are brought to light. When her treasured Composition book is discovered, the binocular-toting heroine must make amends with friends and family under the mentorship of her wise nanny, played by Rosie O’Donnell. The storyline itself was quite controversial. Fitzhugh’s book was challenged by a school board in Ohio in 1983 for being a “bad influence on children.” I’ll admit that I was influenced: Harriet’s passion for writing fueled my early scribblings. I even convinced my mom to buy me a Composition book of my own and make me Harriet’s favorite snack (tomato and mayonnaise sandwiches) as my school lunch for an entire year.—LS\n\nMatilda (1996 and 2022)\n\nMatilda is the perfect children’s book by my estimate: an underdog tale with delightfully wicked enemies, an underestimated heroine whose power resides in her intelligence. (Side note, but I think JK Rowling ripped off the Dursely nincompoops from the Wormwoods, Matilda’s biological family and primary tormentors. Justice for Wormwoods!) And I am a little snooty about adaptations, generally speaking. But these two versions nail it. The original rightly made Mara Wilson a star, and has one of the greatest food-fight scenes in the history of cinema. (Danny Devito as the aforementioned Mr. Wormwood is similarly spectacular.) And the more recent iteration is a different delight—an adaptation of the Tony-award-winning Broadway musical that has made the show accessible to those who couldn’t catch it in its 2013 run. Both of these are well worth a watch. (Just make sure you read the Roald Dahl book as well.)—CS\n\nCinderella (1997)\n\nThis one almost speaks for itself: There is the cast, which includes Brandy, Whitney Houton, Victor Garber, Whoopi Goldberg, Jason Alexander, and—once again—Bernadette Peters. There is the sweeping Rodgers and Hammerstein score, which is (controversial opinion?) so much better than the one in Disney’s 1950 version, lovely as that is. Also, the costumes and set pieces are completely ridiculous. It’s just wholesome, romantic (and racially diverse!) fun at its very finest.—MM\n\nEver After (1998)\n\nAs Danielle De Barbarac, Drew Barrymore breathes new life into the classic tale of Cinderella in this Renaissance-era French iteration. The evil stepmother is deliciously played by Anjelica Huston and her two daughters, by Melanie Lynskey and Megan Dodds as they scheme to win Prince Henry’s heart. With a postmodern feminist approach, a new story is born, and with it fantastical costumery. Who can forget the long-awaited ball scene where Danielle reveals herself to the court in all her winged splendor? Last year marked the movie’s 25th anniversary, and to celebrate, Barrymore invited the cast to reminisce on an episode of The Drew Barrymore Show. Old relics from the film were presented to the audience, including a certain pair of bejeweled slippers created by Salvatore Ferragamo.—LS\n\nThe Parent Trap (1998)\n\nThe superlatives are true. Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki’s 2001 classic for Japan’s Studio Ghibli, is an out-and-out masterpiece. Fall into the slipstream of this eerie, otherworldly story, in which a 10-year-old girl is waylaid on a road trip by her blundering, ravenous parents and tumbles into a realm of ghosts and witches and creatures, and you’ll emerge changed for the better. Spirited Away convinced me that animation could be wilder and more dangerous and infinitely more beautiful than anything I’d seen from Disney in my own childhood, and that my kids could be swept along by sophisticated, uneasy-making, dream-logic storytelling—the kind that Miyazaki specializes in. Essential in every respect.—TA\n\nLemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004)\n\nGrowing up, my family only owned a few DVDs, and thank God Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events was one of them. Even at a young age I was a snobby nerd who firmly believed that the book was always better than the movie, but this film almost made me reconsider. When their parents perish in a fire, the precocious Baudelaire siblings are forced to move into a captivating, gothic mansion with their very distant relative, Count Olaf (and who doesn’t love a story about orphan children). This movie adapts the 13-book series into a sub-two hour movie, and Jim Carrey and his eyebrows steal the show. I would go as far as to say that this is one of the most delightful portrayals of on-screen misfortune out there.—Alex Jhamb Burns\n\nRatatouille (2007)\n\nOkay, let’s get this out of the way: Up is not a great film. After the first 20 minutes, the premise of this Pixar movie is a bit weird: It’s about an elderly guy (Carl) who travels to South America (in a floating house, hence the “up”) with a Boy Scout-like figure, where they meet a bird being pursued by a wicked explorer. But within those first minutes, which condense Carl’s life, specifically his romance and marriage to his now deceased wife, into a speechless montage of poignant moments, is one of the most moving sequences in all of cinema—animated or not. The story may be a bit goofy, but the emotional resonance of those first scenes make the film one to watch and re-watch.—CS\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon (2010)\n\nThis is the first in a trilogy of fantasy adventures that offer brilliantly kinetic entertainment. I confess that I liked these movies even more than my kids did—but they were agreeably swept away. The aerial sequences are breathtaking and the story is genuinely affecting, encompassing themes of friendship, overcoming disability, and old-fashioned heroism.—TA\n\nPacific Rim (2013)\n\nI have to admit it: Whenever my kids fired up Minions, which used to be just about every other day, I was tempted to park myself beside them and watch. Minions is officially a prequel to the Despicable Me series (which is itself excellent), but for my money it’s the central text: smart and irresistible in its combination of cuteness and anarchic comedy. I could never keep Kevin, Stuart, or Bob straight in my head, but to my kids they were distinctly foolish mischief makers who speak in tongues and need a super villain to give their lives meaning. The whole thing is fun and lovable but the opening backstory depicting minions bumbling through history—from the dinosaurs to Napoleon—is nothing short of genius.—TA\n\nCoco (2017)\n\nPixar’s animated fantasy tells a story about Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) and his secret love for music despite his family’s mysterious objection. It’s impossible to pull your eyes away from the stunning technicolor scenery where Mexico’s lush culture sits center stage. We follow Miguel on his spiritual Día de los Muertos journey through the Land of the Dead to find his idol, the “greatest musician of all time,” Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). The award-winning film won the Oscars for best animated feature and best song (for “Un Poco Loco”). The film took six years to complete with 7 million lights in one scene alone. Let out your best grito and get ready for an adventure that’s a feast for the eyes and music to your ears.—LS\n\nMy Octopus Teacher (2020)\n\nThis Pixar-animated coming-of-age fantasy about a brave little sea monster named Luca (Jacob Tremblay) and his budding friendships with land dwellers Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer) and Giulia (Emma Berman) is pure Italian seaside eye candy. We meet an unlikely team enamored with the idea of winning the local town’s Portorosso Cup triathlon to get a shiny new Vespa. Inspired by director Enrico Casarosa’s summer adventures in Genoa, the film gives us a glimpse of what vintage 1950s Italy would look like if local folklore came to life. A true blue and scaly green reminder to “Silenzio, Bruno!” and take chances because you never know what you may find on the other side.—LS\n\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On (2021)\n\nThis is one of those rarities that will appeal to different ages on different levels. Yes, lots of Pixar films are full of jokes that are intended for the grown ups, but this one, from A24, works on everyone purely through its imaginative ingenuity. To some it’s a simple story of a shell with shoes; to me it’s a fable of fortitude and belonging. You get the idea: there’s a range. And then there’s just the hilarious premise of it all, a delightful excursion into Jenny Slate’s bizarrely brilliant mind. Don’t be dissuaded by the documentary-style framing; my kids honestly didn’t even register it, and loved it nonetheless.—CS\n\nEncanto (2021)"
