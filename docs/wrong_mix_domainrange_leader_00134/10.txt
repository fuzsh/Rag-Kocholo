Stanislav Gross was named Czech Prime Minister yesterday, becoming the youngest person to hold the job, and he immediately began building a new reform-oriented government based on a fragile centre-left coalition.

Mr. Gross, 34, a former deputy premier and interior minister, takes over from Social Democrat Vladimir Spidla, whose government collapsed after his party's disastrous showing in June's European elections.

He hopes to form his government along with the Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union, although the three parties together have just a one-seat majority in the 200-member parliament. AFP
