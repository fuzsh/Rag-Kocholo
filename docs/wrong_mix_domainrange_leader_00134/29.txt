History[]

The office of Prime Minister was established in 1918. From 1918 to 1938, the government was centralized and located in Prague, although various officials had presided over executive bodies governing the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia. During the first four years from 1918 to 1922, there were three prime ministers from three different partier: Karel Kramář of the nationalist National Democracy, Vlastimil Tusar of the Social Democratic Party and Edvard Beneš of the National Socialist Party held the premiership. From 1922 to 1938, the period was dominated by Prime Ministers from the Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People (RSZML, also known as "Agrarians" and, later, "Republicans") leading either grand coalitions (1922–1926, 1929–1938) or centre-right coalitions (1926–1929). The longest reigning Prime Minister of the first republic was Antonín Švehla, who held the premiership from 1922 to 1926 and from 1926 to 1929. On 5 November 1935 Milan Hodža became the first Slovak to be appointed Prime Minister, a position he held until 22 September 1938. During the Sudeten Crisis and the German invasion of Czechoslovakia, the premiership was held by General Jan Syrový heading a caretaker government.

After the German conquest of Czechoslovakia, a Czechoslovak government-in-exile was formed first in Paris under the protection of France and Britain. Following the Fall of France, the Czechoslovak government-in-exile relocated to London. Šrámek was appointed prime minister in exile by President Edvard Beneš on 21 July 1939 and served until 5 April 1945. The government was recognized by France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and, later, by the United States. On 5 April 1945, a new government-in-exile was formally installed in Košice with Václav Majer as Prime Minister. He headed a grand coalition named the National Front (Czech: Národní fronta, Slovak: Národný front) which governed until the formation of the Interim National Assembly on 28 October 1945.
