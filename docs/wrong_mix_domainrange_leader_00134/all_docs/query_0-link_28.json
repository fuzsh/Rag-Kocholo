        "text": "Marking out the borders of TV without frontiers\n\nTwo MEPs debate the future of Europe’s broadcasting regulations\n\nMultilingualism is a job for everyone\n\nThe President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso has decided that there should be a European commissioner for multilingualism. He is proposing to assign the multilingualism portfolio to Leonard Orban, who is to be Romania’s first commissioner. Previously multilingualism was the third (and smallest) responsibility in the portfolio of Ján Figel’, the Slovak who has since 2004 been commissioner for education, culture and multilingualism. It was no secret at the time that he was assigned these duties that Figel’ did not believe he had been given enough to do, so no one should expect Orban to be over-occupied.\n\nA likeable candidate\n\nRomania’s failure to get Varujan Vosganian, its first candidate for European Commissioner, accepted by Commission President José Manuel Barroso was a defeat for the European Liberal Democrats. …\n\nBut is Russia the right bear to hug?\n\nOpening the European Studies Institute in Moscow on 23 October, European External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner spoke of its role in “deepening relations between the EU and Russia by creating a pool of expertise and knowledge about each other”.\n\nFar-right MEPs struggle to form political group\n\nNegotiations hit problems after Italian separatists express reluctance to join new formation\n\nUS and EU officials head for data culture-clash\n\nThis week the EU’s top security officials will fly to Washington, DC for what has become an annual EU-US ministerial meeting to discuss justice issues. Michael Chertoff, the head of the US Department of Homeland Security, will be playing host to his EU counterparts, Franco Frattini, the European commissioner for justice, freedom and security and Finnish ministers Leena Luhtanen (justice) and Kari Rajamaki (interior).\n\nReducing energy demand while securing supply\n\nThe question of how to manage the EU’s energy demand has moved up the political agenda in recent years. Fears over soaring oil prices and mounting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have made Europeans look for ways to reduce their energy consumption, without radically changing European lifestyles.\n\nKallas wins deal to unveil EU farm subsidy secrets\n\nEuropean Union governments will publish the names of all recipients of the Union’s farm subsidies and how much they receive from 2009 at the latest, following a deal reached by EU ambassadors last week.\n\nIn search of warmth without worry\n\nTwo MEPs consider the future of EU energy policy\n\nMEPs told REACH could destroy ‘thousands of jobs’\n\nMEPs will destroy jobs in thousands of small European businesses unless they rethink an environment committee deal on the proposed chemicals directive REACH, according to industry. Originally scheduled for this week, a plenary debate on REACH has been postponed while MEPs and governments try to agree a compromise.\n\nPutin and the ‘old man’ spoil Lahti summit\n\nVladimir Putin’s tense dinner with EU leaders in Lahti on 20 October had the merit of being a reality check for both the capacity of EU member states to formulate and deliver a common message to Russia and the Russian president’s openness to dialogue with the EU."
