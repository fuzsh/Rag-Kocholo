        "text": "I live outside Brussels, Belgium, th. For my work, I regularly visit the big BXL to seek out opportunities for researchers and to do a little research myself.\n\nI know better than to expect the Brussels-based to seek us out. Living in Brussels entangles one at the centre of an intricate, complex, and poorly constructed web of international influence. Once wrapped in Brussels-based politics, it’s difficult to extricate one’s person from the sticky centre. The influential are likelier to fly to DC or LA or hop a train to Paris or Strasbourg than drive out into the compagne, the areas beyond Brussels.\n\nBrussels, like many global capitals, is not a well-built web. Well-built webs, like those built by spiders, localize stress. Damage in one bit of the web hurts only that part of the web, ensuring that the whole holds steady.\n\nIn a well-built spider web, vibrations from the damaged area carry unobtrusively throughout the entire structure. These vibrations alert the spider, the web’s originator and custodian, to the location of the damage to facilitate quick repair. This internal structural approach is preceded by the principle of ‘location, location, location.’"
