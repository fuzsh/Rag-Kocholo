        "text": "Ronnie was on the Liberty Of The Seas last week Nov.14..\n\nShame on R.C for not giving him any Billing .\n\nWe had come out of the Main Theatre after watching one of the worst shows..We went to the Promenade and heard a VERY GOOD show going on in the small lounge. So we walked in to find Ronnie Mcdowell and his band. They was playing to only about 15 or 20 people..What a let down.. I looked as we left a 45 min top rate show..Do not know how much we missed but I bet it was better than any show all week long!!! wish we had seen the whole show. There was no billing anywhere that he was playing... Sad. Out of the 7 shows all week his was the best.."
