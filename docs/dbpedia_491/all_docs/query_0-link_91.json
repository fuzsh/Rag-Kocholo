        "text": "Multi-platinum, award-winning recording artist Elle King has enjoyed over 1.5 billion streams worldwide. Her most recent single release has her reuniting with Miranda Lambert on the infectious collaboration “Drunk (And I Don’t Wanna Go Home)” which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Rock and Country Digital Song Sales Charts. Co-written by Elle King with Martin Johnson, who also produced the track, “Drunk” was recorded in Nashville and New York pre-pandemic. This is the second time the two female platinum-selling powerhouse performers have recorded together with their first release “FooledAround and Fell in Love” (along with Maren Morris, Ashley McBryde, Tenille Townes and Caylee Hammack) going on to win the 2020 ACM Award for “Music Event of TheYear.” Elle also was a special guest on Miranda’s 2019 Roadside Bars & Pink Guitars tour. To accompany the track, King and Lambert met up in Nashville to film an80s-inspired wedding video starring Elle as the bride and Miranda as her Maid of Honor complete with a cameo from Elle’s real-life fiancé as the groom. The video was shot in January by directing duo Running Bear using strict COVID protocols.\n\nElle’s latest EP Elle King: In Isolation was released in summer of 2020 and is a collection of raw demos/songs she’s recorded acoustically while quarantining at home in Los Angeles.\n\n​\n\nHer debut album Love Stuff featured her breakthrough single “Ex’s & Oh’s,” which earned her two GRAMMY nominations and is certified 4x times platinum. The break through single hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot Rock Songs Chart, topped the AAA, Hot AC, and Alternative Radio charts, leading King to become the second female artist in 18 years to reach No. 1 at the latter format. Her 2016 collaboration with Dierks Bentley on “Different for Girls,” also scored a No. 1 on the Country Airplay charts and won the CMA Award for “Musical Event of the Year.”\n\n​\n\nHer single “Shame,” featured on her second studio album Shake The Spirit marked King’s fourth radio #1 single and marking Elle the only act in history to have scored No. 1 singles on the Adult Pop Songs, Adult Alternative Songs, Alternative Songs and Country Airplay charts. Rolling Stone wrote “Elle King is a little bit country, a little bit rock n’ roll, but ultimately, she’s punk as fuck.” Variety wrote “…King churned the clotted cream of punkish country, raw R&B, crotchety rock and deep blues into rich, buttery musical drama… (she) belted, crooned, purred, sauntered and swaggered her way through a tautly rocking set… one thing became very clear: nearly every song was equally contagious, catty-cool, and hit-worthy.”\n\nWith 21 No.1 singles on country radio, countless awards, and sold-out tours, Tyler Hubbard has already had a remarkable career as a songwriter and as one half of multi-platinum duo Florida Georgia Line. Hubbard’s debut solo album, aptly titled Tyler Hubbard, was released in January 2023 and has amassed more than 1 billion streams to date. It features Hubbard’s hit debut solo single “5 Foot 9,” which hit No. 1 at Country Radio, was certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA and has 548M global streams. It also features Hubbard’s second No. 1 single, “Dancin’ In The Country,” which already has more than 380M global streams, has been certified Platinum by the RIAA and marked his second No. 1 at Country Radio. Hubbard has made several television appearances as a solo artist, most recently at NBC’s TODAY Show, and also on the CMT Music Awards, Good Morning America and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Hubbard’s new radio single “Back Then Right Now” is out now, and it is the first of Hubbard’s album ’Strong,’ which is due April 12 via EMI Nashville.\n\nHailing from Dripping Springs, TX lead vocalist Mark Wystrach fronts Midland’s rich sound that is rounded out with lead guitarist/vocalist Jess Carson and bass player/vocalist Cameron Duddy. Rooted in tradition in both sound and style, the trio initially garnered attention playing clubs in the region. Their critically-acclaimed sophomore album LET IT ROLL (Big Machine Records) earned the No. 1 position on Billboard’s Top Country Album Sales chart upon release, receiving praise from outlets such as Rolling Stone, Variety, NPR and Entertainment Weekly among others. Wystrach, Carson and Duddy all played an integral role in writing the 14-track album with Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne. The album was produced by Dann Huff, McAnally and Osborne and was a follow-up to the critically acclaimed, GOLD-certified debut album, ON THE ROCKS (Big Machine Records). Launching in 2017 with rave reviews, ON THE ROCKS was declared “the year’s best Country album” by Washington Post. Their 2x Platinum-certified chart-topping debut “Drinkin’ Problem,” which offers an intentional nod to Country music reminiscent of the 1970s and 80s, earned the band their first GRAMMY® Awards nominations for Best Country Song and Best Country Duo/Group Performance. Midland was also named New Vocal Group of the Year at the 2018 ACM Awards and is nominated for Vocal Group of the Year at the 2020 CMA Awards.\n\nProudly independent and unapologetically Southern, country duo Muscadine Bloodline found their true voice on their latest album, Dispatch to 16th Ave. Their sophomore record debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Country Chart, hit No. 4 on the iTunes All Genre Chart and peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard Chart. Lauded by Taste of Country, Rolling Stone, PEOPLE and Billboard, the duo's new music is the most authentic Muscadine Bloodline yet. Charlie Muncaster and Gary Stanton grew up in Mobile, Alabama, but didn’t cross paths until they each started to pursue their musical dreams. In 2012, they forged a friendship when Stanton opened a show for Muncaster’s band at Soul Kitchen in their hometown. Since naming themselves Muscadine Bloodline in 2015, the duo has charted three albums, sold-out shows across the country and played the Grand Ole Opry multiple times, hailed often as the most successful independent duo in Country music. Their Southern roots carry over to their band name as well: Muscadine grapes grow in the South while Bloodline represents their heritage.\n\n​Proudly independent and unapologetically Southern, country duo Muscadine Bloodline found their true voice on their latest album, Dispatch to 16th Ave. Their sophomore record debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Country Chart, hit No. 4 on the iTunes All Genre Chart and peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard Chart.

He’s a member of the Grand Ole Opry and has been honored with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Nashville Walk of Fame. His musical style encompasses traditional country, honky-tonk and Western swing. From the beginning, Black’s biggest influences were Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and especially Merle Haggard, to whom his smooth baritone voice was initially compared.\n\nOne-fourth of country music’s storied Class of 1989, Clint Black's meteoric rise began with Killin’ Time, which produced five consecutive number one singles on the Billboard Hot Country charts. His break-out success put Black on a fast track to super-stardom. Eventually, Black’s wide-spread appeal and his own creative curiosity lead him into the world of acting where he earned roles in dozens of TV shows and feature films including Maverick, Anger Management, The Larry Sanders Show, and many others. The fifth season of his own talk show, Talking in Circles, is currently airing on Circle TV and was awarded “Best Talk Show” in Cynopsis Media’s Best of the Best and Rising Star Awards. This year Clint received the Poet’s Award at the ACM Honors, an award given to the most remarkable and enduring talents in country music songwriting.\n\nNow, Black revisits the album that started it all, Killin’ Time, with a special world tour that kicked off with three sold-out dates at the renowned Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, TN, and continues through 2024.\n\n​Proudly independent and unapologetically Southern, country duo Muscadine Bloodline found their true voice on their latest album, Dispatch to 16th Ave. Their sophomore record debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Country Chart, hit No. 4 on the iTunes All Genre Chart and peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard Chart.
