(March 21, 2016) – Sponsored by Capital Insurance Group, the 2015-2016 Junior Tour of Northern California (JTNC) crowned champions Sunday at the Spring Series II Championship at Windsor Golf Club in Windsor.\n\nAlamo resident Ryan Grauman shot 2-over 146 and defeated Joshua McCarthy in a playoff and San Mateo resident Amanjoty Sangha shot 12-over 156 to win their respective divisions at the Spring Series II Championship held Saturday and Sunday at par-72 Windsor GC.\n\nGrauman’s victory, his second of the season, was keyed by a stellar2-under 70 in the first round. After a front-nine 38, he’d catch fire, posting a 32 on his back-nine with four birdies.\n\nWhile Grauman took the early lead, one of his pursuers was McCarthy. The 2014 JTNC Boys’ Player of the Year and Danville resident shot 72 to leave himself just two back.\n\nOn Sunday, Grauman slipped back to a 76 while McCarthy made a move with a 74, leaving them tied after regulation. In what became a playoff, Grauman came out on top on the second hole.\n\nFinishing in third place at 147 was Robert Briggs of Novato after rounds of 73-74. Thomas Hutchison of San Jose and San Ramon’s Brendan Hy finished T-4 at 149 after final rounds of 74 and 78, respectively.\n\nIn the Girls’ Championship, Sangha outlasted her sister, Kiran, for her first win of the season.\n\nA day after opening with matching scores of 80, Amanjoty posted a day-low 76 that featured two birdies, four bogeys and a double-bogey. Kiran, meanwhile, shot 78. Kiran had a chance to catch Amanjoty but was stung by a critical double-bogey on the 16th hole.\n\nFinishing in a tie for third at 160 were Angela Liu of San Jose and Belinda Hu of San Ramon following final rounds of 78 and 81, respectively. Liu was awarded third place in a card-off. Hu had taken the first round lead after opening with a 79.\n\nFifth place went to Danville’s Ty Akabane at 161 (80-81).\n\nThe Boys’ First Flight Championship title was captured by Allen Zhang of San Jose, who put together rounds of 76-82 to come in at 158.\n\nZhang defeated runner-up Krishan Patel of San Jose, who finished at 161 after a final round 84, by three shots. Taking third place at 171 was Lucas Happy of Petaluma. Dylan McDermott of Granite Bay and Owen Randolph each grabbed a share of fourth place at 172 following matching final rounds of 88.\n\nIn the Girls’ First Flight Championship, Kaylen Choi of Dublin came in at 163 after a final round 80 to defeat runner-up Madison Beckett of Santa Rosa by two shots. Beckett shot 86-79.\n\nThird place went to Kiana Briggs of Novato (171), while Adora JiaYi Wen of San Jose took fourth at 174. Pleasanton’s Kate Lim and Steffi Lin of San Ramon finished T-5 at 175.\n\nSamira Pal of Cupertino had the shot of the weekend, acing the par-3 5th hole on Saturday using an 8-iron.\n\nThe 2016 JTNC Spring Series will continue with the Spring Series III Championship, to be held April 9-10 at The Golf Club at Roddy Ranch in Antioch.\n\nStockton, CA\n\nMarch 12-13, 2016\n\nResults | Pairings\n\nContestant Information Sheet | Yardages: The Reserve at Spanos Park | Stockton GCC\n\nCIG-Sponsored Junior Golf Tour of Northern California Crowns Winners in Spring Series I Championship at Stockton Golf and Country Club and The Reserve at Spanos Park\n\nPEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (March 15, 2016) – Sponsored by Capital Insurance Group, the 2015-2016 Junior Tour of Northern California (JTNC) crowned champions Sunday at the Spring Series I Championship at Stockton Golf and Country Club and The Reserve at Spanos Park in Stockton.\n\nSan Jose resident Matt Lloyd shot 4-over 147 and Fresno resident Tammy Lim shot 5-over 76 to win their respective divisions at the Spring Series I Championship held Saturday and Sunday at par-71 Stockton G&CC and par-72 The Reserve at Spanos Park.\n\nLloyd’s victory, his first of the season, was keyed by a 5-under 67 in the first round at The Reserve at Spanos Park. Starting on the 2nd hole, he’d open with a birdie and tack on two more birdies with a bogey for a front-nine 34.\n\nAfter making the turn, Lloyd went 3-under thanks in part to back-to-back birdies on the 12th and 13th holes.\n\nIn Sunday’s finale at Stockton G&CC, Lloyd and the rest of the field were hit by inclement weather. He’d shoot an 80, but held on to defeat runner-up Daniel Kim of San Jose by a stroke.\n\nKim, who opened with a 72 at The Reserve, followed that up with a 76 at Stockton G&CC. He’d have a chance to tie Lloyd and force a playoff but bogeyed the 18th.\n\nFinishing in third place at 149 was Justin Gums of Lodi after rounds of 73-76. Noah Woolsey of Pleasanton placed fourth at 150 (75-75), with San Jose’s Thomas Hutchison taking fifth at 151 (76-75).\n\nThe Girls’ Championship was limited to 18 holes due to the bad weather.\n\nTaking the title was Fresno’s Tammy Lim, who carded a 5-over 76 in Saturday’s first round at Stockton G&CC. Lim’s round included a birdie, two bogeys and a pair of double-bogeys.\n\nSecond place went to Emilee Hoffman of Folsom, who had a 77 with four bogeys and a double-bogey.\n\nThree players—Amanjoty Sangha of San Mateo, Bibilani Liu of Cupertino and Katherine Zhu of San Jose—finished T-3 after opening with matching rounds of 78.\n\nThe Boys’ First Flight Championship title was captured by Evan Cuenco of Benicia, who put together rounds of 77-83 to come in at 160.\n\nCuenco defeated co-runner-ups Nathan Hutama of Fremont and William Kirkpatrick of Menlo Park by four shots. Hutama came in at 164 after rounds of 83-81 while Kirkpatrick shot 77-87. Ryan Garcia of Ceres was fourth at 165 (81-84) with Gregory Lee of San Jose placing fifth at 169 (84-85).\n\nIn the Girls’ First Flight Championship, Adora JiaYi Wen of San Jose and Varnika Achanta of San jose each came in tied with scores of 83. Wen was declared the winner following a card-off.\n\nThree players—Sacramento’s Monique Peterson, Caleigh Clark of El Dorado Hills and Irene Jun of San Jose—finished T-3 after shooting 85.\n\nThe 2016 JTNC Spring Series will continue with the Spring Series II Championship, to be held March 19-20 at Windsor Golf Club in Windsor.\n\nDon’t be surprised if a player from the Junior Tour of Northern California is in the mix come this weekend’s Nature Valley First Tee Open at Pebble Beach and Poppy Hills.\n\nThe last few years, the JTNC has been a force at the First Tee Open.\n\nAt the 2011 tournament, then-JTNC member Casie Cathrea won the Pro-Junior portion of the First Tee Open playing with Ben Crenshaw. Two years later at the 2013 First Tee Open, then-JTNC member Michelle Xie of Palo Alto won the Pro-Junior with professional partner Kirk Triplett.\n\nThat is, until The First Tee of Tucson member Christopher Meyers pulled off one of the greatest shots on the historic 18th hole at Pebble Beach—a double-eagle from 203 yards out—to give him and pro partner Lee Janzen the victory.At last year’s First Tee Open, meanwhile, JTNC member Joshua McCarthy and pro partner Peter Senior looked to have the Pro-Junior title sewn up.\n\nPrior to Meyers’ miracle, McCarthy was already in the clubhouse with a day-low 64 that had pushed him and Senior to a total of 20-under 195. The tandem of fellow JTNC member Katie Horsford and pro Steve Elkington were also in at 195, but McCarthy would’ve won the tiebreaker due to having the lower round.\n\nAs for Meyers and Janzen, if they had come in at 195, they’d also have lost the tiebreaker, giving McCarthy and the JTNC back-to-back Pro-Junior titles.\n\nWith Meyers’ shot, the matter was settled. He and Janzen won the title with a total of 193.\n\n“I was just stunned,” Meyers said. “I couldn’t believe it.”\n\nWhile the JTNC’s bid for two wins in a row came up short, the Tour still had a fantastic showing. Nine out of the 13 JTNC members who played in the Pro-Junior made the cut.\n\nThis weekend, another 13 JTNC members—in this case, call them the Lucky 13— will have a shot at winning at Pebble Beach.\n\nConsidering how things have gone recently, one of the 13 will be in the title hunt on Sunday:\n\nDaniel Connolly (exemption, San Francisco)\n\nJack Avrit (The First Tee of Central Coast, Arroyo Grande)\n\nNoor Ahmed (The First Tee of Greater Sacramento, Folsom)\n\nAustin Fox (The First Tee of Greater Sacramento, Folsom)\n\nDavid Laskin (The First Tee of Greater Sacramento, Elk Grove)\n\nDrake Mendenhall (The First Tee of Greater Sacramento, Granite Bay)\n\nNicole Schroeder (The First Tee of Greater Sacramento, Rocklin)\n\nClare Brady (The First Tee of Silicon Valley, Campbell)\n\nBibilani Liu (The First Tee of Silicon Valley, Cupertino)\n\nRonnie McDowell Jr. (The First Tee of Silicon Valley, San Jose)\n\nRyan Ramboyong (The First Tee of Silicon Valley, San Jose)\n\nTiffany Cha (The First Tee of the Tri-Valley, San Ramon)\n\nArdin Lo (The First Tee of the Tri-Valley, Pleasanton)\n\nLongtime UC Davis men’s golf coach Cy Williams first became aware of the Junior Tour of Northern California a few years back thanks to the players he was recruiting.\n\n“They’d send me their schedule and it’d have Junior Tour of Northern California events on it,” said Williams, who’s in his 19th year at the UC Davis helm. “More and more guys had JTNC events.”\n\nThese days, when Williams find himself on the recruitment trail for future Aggies, one of his first stops is the JTNC website.\n\n“I’ve now got it bookmarked,” Williams said. “Now, when I recruit, if a kid sends in a JTNC result I check the whole field. I think it’s picked up in notoriety and strength the last few years.”\n\nIt certainly has. The 2011 JTNC Player of the Year was 2015 U.S. Amateur champion Bryson DeChambeau. Last season’s NCAA Player of the Year Maverick McNealy, meanwhile, also was once a regular on the JTNC circuit.\n\nAs for how much Williams has invested in the JTNC, one only needs to look at the 2015-2016 Aggies’ roster. Eleven of the 12 Aggies on the current roster have a JTNC background– Quinn Carlsen (El Dorado Hills), Louie Chen (Fremont), Ben Corfee (Davis), Ryan Han (Hollister), Matt Klein (Lafayette), Evan Knight (Novato), Ryan Knop (Pleasanton), Nicholas Noya (South San Francisco), Jeremy Sanchez (Sacramento), Patrick Soli (San Carlos) and Luke Vivolo (Carmel).The caliber of players on the JTNC has become so good that today it even brings Williams out of his office. If he has time on his schedule, he now attends tournaments.\n\nCorfee won the 2014 NCGA Four-Ball Championship playing with friend Scott Raber. Ryan Knop shot an 9-under 63 at Poppy Hills to win the 2014 JTNC Championship.\n\nThe only member of the 12-man squad that isn’t a JTNC product is Jesse Bratz—and that’s only because Bratz hails from Texas.\n\nAs far as Williams is concerned, college coaches—especially those in Northern California–don’t have to look too far outside of the region for talent.\n\n“There are just so many great young players in Northern California. As a coach, I don’t think you need to go national,” said Williams, a native of Oakland. “The JTNC and JGANC (Junior Golf Association of Northern California) have done a great job. They are the ones you look at.”\n\nWhen searching for recruits, Williams said for him it boils down to two categories: Scores and Potential.\n\nShould Williams not exactly be sure what kind of potential player he might have, he’ll then examine some of the other intangibles.“Scores show that players can do it, or what they’re capable of doing,” Williams said. “The next thing is trying to figure out how good they’ll be in three years. One thing I look at is, do they do one thing well? For example, are they a good putter? A good ball striker? The key being that if they can establish the rest of their game, they’ll be a good player.”\n\n“If someone is on the fence in my mind, and they have for example bad body language or a bad temper, that will sway me the other way,” Williams said. “As a coach, you don’t want to have to spend energy trying to modify negative behaviors.”\n\nAs for the latest crop of future Aggies, Williams said he’s already got his eyes on a number of current JTNC members.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if we get some commitments in the fall,” he said.\n\nFormer Junior Tour of Northern California member Hannah O’Sullivan has her second huge win of 2015.\n\nO’Sullivan, who grew up in the Bay Area but now resides in Arizona, won the 2015 U.S. Women’s Amateur Championship on Sunday after defeating Sierra Brooks, 3 and 2, in Sunday’s final at Portland Golf Club.\n\nBack in February, O’Sullivan, then 16, became the youngest ever winner on the Symetra Tour when she captured the Gateway Classic.\n\n“I can’t really describe how good it feels,” said O’Sullivan, whose year also a co-runner-up finish at the 2015 U.S. Women’s Amateur Four-Ball Championship, where she played with partner Robynn Ree. “It was just such a tough match today, and to be able to come out on top, it’s just incredible. I just feel so blessed.”\n\n2015 U.S. Women’s Amateur\n\nThings didn’t look so good for O’Sullivan in the morning portion of the 36-hole finale. Through the first 14 holes, she trailed by three.\n\nThe tide began turning on the par-4 16th when O’Sullivan drained a 30-footer for birdie to cut Brooks’ lead to 2 up. Brooks then stumbled on the par-5 18th, finding a left fairway bunker off the tee that led to another O’Sullivan win to cut the deficit to one entering the break.\n\nIn the afternoon, O’Sullivan squared the match through 23 holes, took the lead on the 24th hole and later sank a 4-foot par putt on the 34th green to seal the victory.\n\nWith the victory, O’Sullivan, who will start playing for USC in the fall of 2016, earned exemptions into the 2016 U.S. Women’s Open at CordeValle, a 10-year exemption into the U.S. Women’s Amateur and one-year exemptions into the Ricoh Women’s British Open Championship, ANA Inspiration and Evian Championship\n\n“I felt like I wasn’t playing very well at all the first 18, but I fought back and I still shot 1 under,” O’Sullivan said. “I knew the game was definitely there, and I had the opportunities.”\n\nJustin Suh closed out his junior career by making history, while Sabrina Iqbal made it two in a row.\n\nBoth San Jose residents, Suh and Iqbal claimed JTNC Boys’ and Girls’ Player of the Year honors for the 2014-2105 season.\n\nSuh, the first male to earn Player of the Year honors twice, took the top spot thanks to a first place finish at the annual season-ending JTNC Tour Championship at Poppy Hills GC. An 18-year-old freshman at USC, Suh finished the season with 2,260 points.\n\nFellow San Jose resident Thomas Hutchison, who lost to Suh in the finals of this year’s San Francisco City Amateur, finished second with 1,755 points.\n\n“I’ve been a part of the JTNC for so long that it means a lot to me,” said Suh, who won the Tour Championship by two strokes after shooting a final round 1-under 70. “It’s not a bad way to go out.”\n\nAlong with his wins at Poppy Hills and the San Francisco City, Suh also captured titles at the JTNC Summer Series II and Fall Series VIII Championships and the Santa Clara County Championship. The Player of the Year in 2013, Suh also added a tie for second at the CIF State High School Boys’ Championship at Poppy Hills after returning as defending champion.\n\n“Northern California events have such tough fields in general, so it’s a huge confidence booster moving on to the collegiate level,” Suh said.\n\nWith her title, Iqbal, who also won the honor in 2014, joined Casie Cathrea as the only females to win back-to-back Player of the Year honors. Cathrea’s record three Player of the Year titles came in 2010, 2011 and 2013.\n\nA 14-year-old sophomore at Pioneer High, Iqbal finished the season with 3,955 points, nearly doubling the total of runner-up Yealimi Noh of Concord (2,307). In 2014, Iqbal tallied 4,003 points en route to earning the title.\n\n“I’m proud. The JTNC means a lot to me. It’s helped me grow as a player and it’s fun,” Iqbal said. “I’m hoping to break some records.”\n\nDuring the season, Iqbal racked up four JTNC wins at the Fall Series I, Spring Series VII, Spring Series VIII and Summer Series I Championships. She’d have a chance to match her own JTNC record of four wins in a row but settled for a 12th place finish at the Summer Series II Championship.\n\nOther Iqbal victories came at the CIF State High School Girls’ Championship and the NCGA Junior Championship at Spyglass Hill. She also finished second at two other JTNC championships and the NCGA/CIF NorCal Girls’ Championship.\n\n“I didn’t play very well early in the season because I was really busy with school stuff,” said Iqbal, who now has 14 career JTNC wins, just four shy of Cathrea’s record of 18. “In the spring I was able to get back into a groove.”\n\nBoth Suh and Iqbal picked up the game from their fathers.\n\nSuh’s dad, Duk, took Justin out to the range and the course when he was younger. Iqbal’s dad, Shaheen, is a PGA professional at The Villages Golf and Country Club.\n\nJacob Solomon of Dublin High took the individual title, while Westlake High of Westlake Village made it an unprecedented two in a row.\n\nSolomon, a senior headed to the University of Auburn in the fall, shot a 3-under 68, and Westlake High fired a score of 18-over 373 to win the individual and team titles, respectively, at Wednesday’s CIF Boys State Championship at par-71 Poppy Hills Golf Course.\n\nSolomon, a member of the Junior Tour of Northern California, defeated co-runner-ups Justin Suh of Evergreen Valley (San Jose) and Shrish Dwivedi of Harker School (San Jose) by a stroke. With the victory, he joins a list of former state champions that includes Rickie Fowler and Patrick Cantlay.\n\n“I knew Rickie had won it. It’s pretty special to add my name,” Solomon said. “Winning a California state championship is pretty cool, knowing how great everyone here is.”\n\nEven par through his first eight holes, Solomon made his first push by stringing together three straight birdies from holes No.9 through No.11.\n\nHe’d stumble with a bogey on the 12th and dropped back to even with a double-bogey on the 13th, but closed out his day with a birdie on No.16 and an eagle on the par-5 18th. On 18, he’d stiff a 3-iron from 210 yards out to within 10 feet of the flagstick and knock in the putt.\n\n“It was a pretty special round,” Solomon said. “I felt like my ball-striking was great. The last three holes I told myself that I wanted to cap my high school career on a high note. It was fun.”\n\nWith a win, Suh, the 2014 champion, would’ve become the first individual to win two CIF state titles. He’d get to 3-under through his first 10 holes, but later stumbled with bogeys on the 13th and 14th holes. Headed to USC in the fall, Suh closed with a two-putt birdie on the 18th but was left one shot short.\n\n“I knew that no one had won it twice. My coach made that clear. Coming in as defending champ added to the pressure,” Suh said. “My swing just didn’t feel right.”\n\nFor Suh, neither did the 13th or 14th holes. The winner of this year’s San Franciso City Championship, Suh said that he also struggled with the two holes in a practice round on Tuesday.\n\n“They’re just tough holes for me. They don’t fit my eye,” Suh said. “There are not a lot of places to miss it on those greens.”\n\nAfter going 2-over early on, Dwivedi birdied holes No.7, No.9 and No.10 to get to red numbers. The Duke bound senior bogeyed the 14th though to drop back to even par before birdying the 16th and 18th holes.\n\nFive players finished the individual championship tied for fourth at 71 including Kaiwen Liu of Torrey Pines, Noah Norton of Pleasant Valley and Temescal Canyon’s Norman Xiong.\n\nWhile Suh came up just short, Westlake did make history. The Warriors, who defeated runner-up Torrey Pines by four strokes, are the first team to win two titles.\n\nwestlake\n\nWestlake High became the first team to win two state titles.\n\nLeading the way for Westlake were Matt Wolff and Spencer Soosman, who were among the five at 71. Other Warriors scores were Brandon Jacobs (79), Justin Egelske (75), Jack Biwer (83) and Preston Smith (77).\n\nWestlake returned five of the six players that won the state last year. The player who’s gone, Sean Crocker, now plays at USC, which finished as runner-up in the NCAA Championship on Wednesday.\n\nWarriors coach Rick Naranjo didn’t set his line-up for this year’s championship until after a play-in practice round (four players for three spots) on Tuesday.\n\n“The kids said that yesterday’s competition to get in was tougher than today,” Westlake head coach Rick Naranjo said. “They said they were more relaxed today.”\n\nTorrey Pines, who won the title in 2011 and finished at 377, was led by Liu’s 71 and Adam Navigato’s 76. Other Falcons scores were Toby Song (77), Jamie Cheatham (78), Otto Vanahatalo (86) and James Song (75).\n\nFinishing third in the team championship at 386 and making it a clean sweep for the Southern California contingent was Loyola of Los Angeles.\n\nAs for choosing to take his game to Auburn and the SEC, Solomon said his decision was based on the relationships he’s forged with the coaches there.\n\n“The facilities they have there, nothing compares to it. And they have good academics,” Solomon said.\n\nLooking ahead, Westlake could be on its way to a mini-dynasty. This year’s squad consisted of all juniors and one sophomore.\n\nThe Junior Tour of Northern California has its first national champion.\n\nSouthern Methodist University junior Bryson DeChambeau, who was the JTNC Player of the Year in 2011, shot a final round 1-under 71 Monday at The Concession Golf Club in Florida to win the NCAA Championship Individual title by one over runner-up Cheng-Tsung Pan of the University of Washington.\n\nDeChambeau, who hails from Clovis, finished the 72-hole event with a total of 8-under 280. He’s the first SMU player to ever win a national title. The Mustangs claimed the team title in 1954.\n\n“I’m so honored to be named the national champion, the first national champion for SMU,” DeChambeau said. “I can’t say anything else, but thank you to everybody for their support. There’s nothing better to feel.”\n\nDeChambeau made his big move with a second round 67 on Saturday that featured an eagle and five birdies to go against just two bogeys. Starting on the 10th tee, in Monday’s clincher he’d crawl out of the gates with a front-nine 38. After making the turn—and when it counted the most—he’d go bogey-free with three birdies for a 33.\n\n“My stomach was churning the whole time, it was difficult,” DeChambeau said. “Luckily I didn’t have to go into a playoff.”\n\nFor DeChambeau, what became an impressive spring run began when he placed second at the American Championship after shooting a conference record 8-under 64 in the final round. Shortly after, he was named the American Athletic Conference Player of the Year, becoming the first Mustangs golfer to win league player of the year honors since Kelly Kraft won Conference USA Player of the Year in 2010.\n\nAt the NCAA Noblesville Regional at The Sagamore Club in Indiana, DeChambeau took fifth after shooting 4-under 212. His play helped the Mustang grab a share of the team title with Illinois.\n\nIn early May, DeChambeau and partner/SMU teammate Austin Smotherman reached the Round of 16 at the inaugural U.S. Amateur Four-Ball Championship at the Olympic Club.\n\nAs a junior player, DeChambeau was a regular on the JTNC circuit.\n\n“The experience that I had at the JTNC helped me get to a higher level of play as well as a higher standard of my character,” said DeChambeau in a 2014 interview."
