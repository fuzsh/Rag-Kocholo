        "meta_description": "The RolandNote Country Music Database is a constantly updated source for everything you want to know about country music history. From Jimmie Rodgers to The Judds, from Gene Autry to Garth Brooks, from The Carter Family to Carrie Underwood, RolandNote.com supplies endless biographical data and trivia. It's a quick resource not only for the front-line artists, but also the producers, songwriters and musicians - fiddlers, guitarists, drummers and Dobro players - that helped establish hillbilly, bluegrass, western swing and honky-tonk music. But it's not just about the people in country music. It's a fascinating tool to find details about such radio shows as the Grand Ole Opry and 'The Louisiana Hayride'; important sites such as the Ryman Auditorium, RCA Studio B and the Country Music Hall of Fame; major movies and TV shows such as 'Urban Cowboy,' 'Hee Haw,' 'Reba' and 'CMT Crossroads'; and the histories of significant albums and songs, such as Lee Ann Womack's 'I Hope You Dance,' Shania Twain's 'Come On Over,' Johnny Cash's 'Folsom Prison Blues' and Hank Williams' 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.' Created by music journalist Tom Roland, it's an essential virtual stomping ground for anyone who loves country music, be it a radio program director, a Music Row professional or a devoted country fan.",
