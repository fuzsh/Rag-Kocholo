        "text": "HOUSTON - A teenager who was charged as an adult in the shooting death of a Lamar High School student in 2018, has been found guilty.\n\nThat decision was handed down just minutes ago for Keona Mouton.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Judge approves bond conditions for teen charged in Lamar HS student's death\n\nProsecutors with the district attorney's office believe that she was a key in the death of 18-year-old Delindsey Mack. They say the girl set up Mack to be shot and killed after school in November 2018.\n\nInvestigators said Mouton walked out of school with Mack just five minutes after receiving a text message from 19-year old Kendrick Johnson asking if Mack had left yet.\n\nFOX 26 Houston is now on the FOX LOCAL app available through Apple TV, Amazon FireTV, Roku, Google Android TV, Samsung TV, and Vizio!\n\nProsecutors believe Mack was interested in the girl and that's how she was able to lure him to a specific location.\n\nJohnson, who was also arrested on murder charges, was previously found guilty and sentenced to life behind bars.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Suspect found guilty in connection to gang-related murder of Lamar High School student in 2018\n\nThe court is currently in a break and the punishment phase is scheduled to begin shortly."
