        "text": "There are a limited number of dinner-concert tickets, and several concert-only tickets for the May 6 Ronnie McDowell performance at the Savannah Oaks Winery Concert Pavilion near Benton, officials said.\n\nIt will be Saturday, May 6.\n\nThe evening will begin around 4 p.m. for dinner guests with live entertainment by their very own Savannah Oaks Winery Show Band. Also entertaining will be Karaoke with Don & Lisa Weatherby, to a delicious buffet dinner. It all takes place in the brand new pavilion in a gorgeous setting by the winery koi pond. Dinner guests may purchase Savannah Oaks’ own wines for the meal, and beer will also be available.\n\nThen “home-grown Tennesseean” Ronnie McDowell will take the stage for a fabulous after dinner performance. McDowell first became famous in the late 70’s with “The King is Gone” and Elvis Pressley movies. He is a talented singer-songwriter who has enjoyed decades of hits and successful projects, including music videos and hit movie soundtracks. You’ll recognize all his songs as he does what he loves best – sings his songs to live audiences.\n\nDinner-Concert Tickets are $50, Concert only tickets are $30. Concert arrival should be no later than 7 p.m.\n\nCall for reservations – 423-263-0421 – or log on for more information to\n\nwww.GuestLineTN.com -Events & Festivals and –Things To Do\n\nhttp://www.guestlinetn.com/guestline_events.cfm\n\nor click here for the May 6th Dinner Concert Event…\n\nhttp://www.guestlinetn.com/RonnieMcDowell.htm\n\nSavannah Oaks Winery has updated its roster of annual events to include plenty to make the pretty 45 minute drive from Chattanooga out to the mountains for…. Their lovely wedding, reunion and party facilities host numerous private events throughout the year. Open to the public to enjoy are Valentines Day Dinner-Dances, Memorial Day & 4th of July Festivities, and most fun of all, their Fall Harvest “Grape Stomp”. Savannah Oaks Winery provides a lovely setting for any event – or even just a visit to their gift shop to taste some of their award winning wines – and includes lovely grounds, ponds with water lilies, and the Cherokee Mountains as a backdrop."
