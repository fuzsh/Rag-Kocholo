He made his debut in 1977 with the song \"The King Is Gone\", a tribute to Elvis Presley, who had died not long before the single's release. From that single onward, McDowell has charted more than thirty Top 40 hits on the \"Billboard\" country music charts. Two of his singles – \"Older Women\" and \"You're Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation\" — reached Number One on the country charts, while eleven more reached Top Ten. He has also released more than twenty studio albums, and has been signed to Curb Records since 1986.\n\nCareer\n\nFollowing the death of Elvis Presley in 1977, McDowell had a one-off hit with his self-penned tribute song \"The King Is Gone,\" which he recorded on the independent Scorpion record label. The record took off immediately, gaining airplay on country and pop radio stations across the United States and around the world. To date, \"The King Is Gone\" has sold more than 5 million copies.\n\nSuddenly, the young man from Portland, Tennessee was a star and he quickly proved that he was not a fluke. McDowell scored a second hit for the Scorpion label entitled \"I Love You, I Love You, I Love You\" before being signed by CBS Records Epic in 1979.\n\nMcDowell charted a string of hit singles and albums for Epic between 1979 and 1986. Every single release, with the exception of one, became a Top 10 hit, including the chart-toppers \"Older Women\" and \"You're Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation.\" Other hits during his Epic years included \"Watching Girls Go By,\" \"Personally,\" \"You Made A Wanted Man Of Me,\" \"All Tied Up,\" and \"In A New York Minute.\"\n\nMcDowell toured constantly to support each album release, and consequently built a large fan base throughout the country. He sought the advice of artists such as Conway Twitty, who became his mentor and friend. Twitty helped the young singer with advice about touring, recording and entertaining the fans.\n\nMoving to Curb Records in 1986, McDowell scored a Top 10 hit with \"It's Only Make Believe,\" a duet with Conway Twitty on what had been Twitty's breakthrough rock and roll hit in 1958. Two years later, McDowell teamed up with Jerry Lee Lewis for a duet that McDowell wrote, entitled \"You're Never Too Old To Rock N' Roll.\" He also recorded yet another Top 10 hit with his cover version of the pop standard \"Unchained Melody,\" which also became a #1 country music video. He started appearing in larger venues and touring with artists such as Conway Twitty, Tammy Wynette and Loretta Lynn before headlining his own shows.\n\nTwo of McDowell's most recent projects on Curb Records include an album of beach music with Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Bill Pinkney's Original Drifters, entitled, \"Ronnie McDowell with Bill Pinkney's Original Drifters\". The second project is a new country album, entitled \"Ronnie McDowell Country\", a collection of six new McDowell penned songs and a few country standards by such legendary country singers and writers as Buck Owens, Harlan Howard and Dallas Frazier.\n\nMcDowell often tours with Elvis Presley's original sidemen, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana, along with The Jordanaires and Millie Kirkham. They stage a tribute to Presley's music and life. McDowell sang thirty six songs on the soundtrack, \"Elvis,\" the Dick Clark-produced television movie which featured Kurt Russell as the performer. He also was the singing voice for the television movie \"Elvis And Me\", the ABC television series about the early years of Presley's' career, \"Elvis,\" and the 1997 Showtime special, \"Elvis Meets Nixon.\" McDowell continues to tour the road to this day.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRonnie McDowell resides in Nashville, Tennessee. Along with touring, he paints in his spare time.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\n*\"I Love You, I Love You, I Love You\" (1978)\n\n*\"A Tribute to the King\" (1979)\n\n*\"Elvis\" (1979)\n\n*\"Rockin' You Easy, Lovin' You Slow\" (1979)\n\n*\"Love So Many Ways\" (1980)\n\n*\"Good Time Lovin' Man\" (1981)\n\n*\"Greatest Hits\" (1982)\n\n*\"Country Boy's Heart\" (1983)\n\n*\"Personally\" (1983)\n\n*\"Willing\" (1984)\n\n*\"In a New York Minute\" (1985)\n\n*\"All Tied Up in Love\" (1986)\n\n*\"Older Women and Other Greatest Hits\" (1987)\n\n*\"I'm Still Missing You\" (1988)\n\n*\"American Music\" (1989)\n\n*\"The Best of Ronnie McDowell\" (1990)\n\n*\"Your Precious Love\" (1991)\n\n*\"Unchained Melody\" (1991)\n\n*\"When a Man Loves a Woman\" (1992)\n\n*\"Country Dances\" (1993)\n\n*\"Greatest Hits\" (1994)\n\n*\"Great Gospel Songs\" (1996)\n\n*\"Elvis: A Tribute to the King\" (1997)\n\n*\"Now & Again: The Best of Ronnie McDowell\" (1998)\n\n*\"Ronnie McDowell Country\" (2002)\n\n*\"Ronnie McDowell with Bill Pinkney's Original Drifters\" (2002)\n\n*\"Live at Church Street Station\" (2006)\n\nSingles\n\nExternal links"
