        "text": "Country music hitmaker Ronnie McDowell will reissue five of his legendary albums on February 17 as part of his multi-year deal with Time Life. For the first time ever, these classic albums will be available on all digital platforms and include ‘Live At The Fox,’ ‘I’m Gonna Dance With The Ones That Brought Me,’ ‘The Songs I Love,’ ‘Somebody Hold Me,’ and ‘Resurgence’. With a career spanning nearly five decades and over 30 charted singles, Ronnie McDowell shows no signs of slowing down. In addition to his ongoing partnership with Time Life, McDowell continues to tour the United States and around the world!\n\n“I am so happy to be working with the folks at Time Life with reissuing these albums digitally for the first time ever,” shares McDowell. “Fans from all over the world are constantly asking about these albums, and now they can listen to them anywhere at any time! I hope you are excited about this as I am!”\n\nSince his breakout tribute to Elvis Presley, “The King is Gone” took the world by storm, Ronnie McDowell has charted more than thirty Top 40 hits on the Billboard country music charts. Two of his singles, “Older Women” and “You’re Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation,” reached No. 1 on the country charts. He has also released more than twenty studio albums.\n\nAbout Ronnie McDowell:\n\nLike all great entertainers, Ronnie McDowell has a personality that remains luminous long after the lights go dim. These qualities have inspired a nationwide network of fan clubs with more than 3,000 members. Following the death of Elvis Presley in 1977, Ronnie McDowell came out of nowhere to dazzle the world with his heartfelt and self-penned tribute song “The King Is Gone” on the independent Scorpion label. The record took off immediately, gaining airplay on country and pop stations across the country and around the world. To date, “The King Is Gone” has sold more than five million copies. McDowell scored a second hit for the Scorpion label titled “I Love You, I Love You, I Love You” before being signed by CBS Records’ Epic label in 1979. He continued to chart a string of hit singles and albums for Epic between 1979 and 1986.\n\nEvery single release, with the exception of just one, became a Top 10 Hit including the chart-toppers “Older Women” and “You’re Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation.” Other hits during his Epic years included “Watchin’ Girls Go By,” “Personally,” “You Made A Wanted Man Of Me,” “All Tied Up,” and “In A New York Minute.”\n\nHe sought the advice of artists such as Conway Twitty who became, in essence, not only his mentor but his friend as well. Twitty helped the young singer with advice about touring, recording, and most of all, entertaining fans. Twitty was certainly the master and Ronnie McDowell quickly became his prize pupil. Moving to Curb Records in 1986, his current label to date, McDowell scored a Top 10 hit with “It’s Only Make Believe,” a duet with Conway Twitty on what was Twitty’s breakthrough hit from 1958. Two years later Ronnie teamed up with Jerry Lee Lewis for a rocking duet that McDowell wrote titled, ”You’re Never Too Old To Rock N’ Roll.” He also recorded yet another Top 10 hit with his version of the pop standard “Unchained Melody,” which became a #1 country music video. His entertaining abilities soared and he began to draw larger crowds. He started appearing in larger venues and touring with artists such as Conway Twitty, Tammy Wynette, and Loretta Lynn before headlining his own shows. McDowell also achieved notoriety when he sang 36 songs on the soundtrack “Elvis,” the Dick Clark-produced television movie that featured Kurt Russell as the performer. He also was the singing voice for the television movie “Elvis And Me,” the ABC television series about the early years of Elvis’ career titled simply “Elvis” as well as the 1997 Showtime special “Elvis Meets Nixon.” While Elvis Presley has played a big part in Ronnie McDowell’s musical career over the years, Ronnie continues to entertain audiences with his own blend of romantic intimacy and country excitement."
