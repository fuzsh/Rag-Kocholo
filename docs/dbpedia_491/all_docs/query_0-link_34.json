        "text": "Gallatin's historic downtown square will soon play host to country music legends for a set of shows that organizers say will attract fans near and far.\n\nAfter performing regularly at venues in Portland for about two years, Ronnie McDowell, 64, will move his shows to Gallatin's historic Palace Theatre beginning April 11. The show, which begins at 7 p.m., will feature Billy Joe Royal, best known for his 1965 hit \"Down in the Boondocks.\"\n\n\"I play these little theaters all the time, and so when I looked at the Palace, saw the stage and the seating arrangement I just thought it would be the perfect place for this,\" McDowell said. \"We're going to try to do this every month, or every other month, and bring in a different artist in with me, so I'll be kind of like the host.\"\n\nAmong multiple Top 10 hits, McDowell is perhaps best known for his self-pinned song \"The King is Gone,\" which he wrote following the death of Elvis Presley in 1977. Since then, the singer's success has led to a large following of nationwide fan clubs with more than 3,000 members, many of whom travel from out of state to see him perform live.\n\n\"We've had fans at the shows in Portland for instance from as far away as North Carolina,\" said Jim Calloway, who has been working with the singer since 1973. \"They come in, they'll spend the week and they will tour Nashville.\"\n\nThe second show planned at the Palace, set for May 30, will be \"Ronnie McDowell's Tribute to the King,\" which will feature Elvis Presley's music. The show will include Presley's former drummer, D.J. Fontana, and the Stamps Quartet.\n\nThe performances will help add further diversity to the entertainment options available downtown, said Greater Gallatin Executive Director Donna Belote.\n\n\"Ronnie is very talented, and he is bringing something different here,\" Belote said. \"It's going to be really good exposure for the Palace, and it's going to bring people to the square from out of town.\"\n\nPalace painting available to purchase\n\nA free meet and greet with McDowell and Royal will take place either April 10 or the day of the show, said Calloway. During the signing, a portrait of the Palace painted earlier this year by McDowell will be on display and prints will be available to purchase.\n\n\"A painting is kind of like a song,\" McDowell said. \"A song reaches the heart through the ears where a painting reaches the heart through the eyes. When people see this painting, everyone that ever went to a movie in the 1940s and 1950s will relate to it.\"\n\nIn all, 519 prints of the painting are being produced, Calloway said. There will be 19 artist proofs, 209 signed and numbered prints, and 291 signed prints. The prints, which cost $50, $75 or $250, will be available to purchase at the meet and greet. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to Greater Gallatin.\n\nWhile he hopes the painting appeals to Gallatin natives, McDowell said he knows the city will appeal to his fans traveling from out of state.\n\n\"My fans that come from all over the country are going to love Gallatin because they have little restaurants on the square, there are so many hotels around Gallatin and it's only about 15 miles from my hometown,\" McDowell said. \"I just think it's absolutely perfect and we're going to have a big time.\"\n\nReach Josh Cross at 615-575-7115.\n\nIf you go\n\nTickets for the show, which range from $30 to $40 in price, can be purchased by calling Greater Gallatin's office at 615-452-5692 or by calling 615-325-4783."
