        "text": "Ronnie McDowellÂ returns to the Branson MO stage! Â McDowell brings his incredible catalog of music and a phenomenal voice thatâs at once unique, yet reminiscent of the king himself, Elvis Presley. Â It was the untimely death of Presley that introduced us to the magic of Ronnie McDowellâs special sound; it was right after Presleyâs passing that McDowell quickly wrote, recorded, and released the song âThe King is Gone.â Ronnieâs hit song stunned everyone with both the emotion of the lyrics, and his uncanny singing style, one that likely helped fuel the never-ending legend that Elvis lives on...yep, he sounds that much like The King of Rock ânâ Roll! Â McDowellâs career in music soon grew hot and he began to enjoy scores of Top Ten hits, including âI Love You, I Love You, I Love You,â âWandering Eyes,â âWatchinâ Girls Go By,â âYou Made a Wanted Man of Me,â âIn a New York Minute,â and âAll Tied Up,â and he reached #1 status with âOlder Womenâ and âYouâre Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation.âÂ He'll be sharing many of his hit songs during his Branson appearance, but it might just be his tribute to Elvis that'll really touch your heart - and blow your mind!\n\nRonnie McDowellÂ has been touring for decades, but singing isnât the only thing thatâs kept him busy - heâs penned his autobiography, âBringing It to You Personally,â and heâs an avid, and truly sensational, painter. Â With his purely American, Rockwellian style, McDowell has captured an almost photographic image of everyone from George Jones to Oprah Winfrey, and from Dolly Parton to Johnny Depp. Elvis Presley, of course, is a popular painting subject for McDowell, and heâs also fascinated with capturing Disney characters and images in his realistic works of art. Â His talent is so outstanding, the daughter of Loretta Lynn asked that he immortalize her mother on canvas after seeing Ronnieâs painting of Elvis hanging in Graceland. His paintings of Disney images so inspired the company that he now works producing more artwork for Disney.\n\nAdditional Information/Helpful Hints\n\nRonnie McDowell will be appearing at Dick Clarkâs American Bandstand Theater.\n\nThe theater complex is located at 1600 West 76 Country Boulevard.\n\nThe concert is scheduled for July 24, 2021 at 3:00 p.m.\n\nDick Clarkâs American Bandstand Theater is housed in a complex that also includes a museum filled with celebrity and vintage vehicles, as well as a Hurts Donut shop.\n\nThere is a gift shop located in the lobby area of the theater.\n\nThe updated concession area - Legendary Eats - serves items like Johnsonville Brats, chili-cheese dogs, ham & turkey croissants, fresh-baked gourmet cookies, and chocolate covered bananas.\n\nRonnie McDowell's performance will be family-friendly and suitable for guests of all ages."
