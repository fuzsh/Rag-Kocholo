        "text": "August 1, 2024\n\nHi Gang:\n\nYou might want to get comfortable, pour yourself a big cup of coffee, and get ready to read for awhile. There’s so much going on in Whisperworld right now that my letter is bound to be longer than usual. Thanks for joining us.\n\nFirst off, our new EP titled “Forevermore” is being released in just a few more days, August 16th to be exact, and I can’t wait to share these new songs and new music with you. Here’s a look at the titles, the songwriters, and the cover art:\n\n1) I Love Us (Bill Anderson-Steve Dorff)\n\n2) All Of Me Loves All Of You (Bill Anderson)\n\n3) The Last One I’ll Forget (Bill Anderson-Steve Dorff)\n\n4) Brand New Every Day (Bill Anderson-Steve Dorff)\n\n5) Yesterday, Today, And Forevermore (Bill Anderson-Steve Dorff-Bobby Tomberlin)\n\n6) Stay Gone (Bill Anderson-Steve Dorff)\n\nIt takes a lot of nerve for someone my age to submit to a new photo session, but Dennis Carney is a master behind the lens. He has taken the cover pictures for many of my albums over the years, and he worked his magic one more time on this one. Thanks, Dennis! You are THE best!\n\nAs you can tell from the titles, this is a collection of positive love songs that I hope you’ll want to share with the special people in your life. I’ve had several people tell me the music reminds them of a modern-day version of “Still.” I take that as a pretty nice compliment. And for once, I will confess to having a favorite among the cuts. I’m proud of them all, but “The Last One I’ll Forget” has rapidly become one of my favorite songs I have ever written. Hopefully, it will become a favorite of yours as well.\n\nspan>OK, so what else is going on? Let’s start with my adopted hometown, Commerce, Georgia, and our big show coming up down there on September 14th. I am really pumped about it, not only because it will be my first concert appearance in over four years, but because of my friends who are giving of their time and talents to come be with us.\n\nHall of Fame member, Charlie McCoy, star of HeeHaw and the Grand Ole Opry and one of the greatest instrumentalists of all time, will be there….as will “Miss Country Soul”, Jeannie Seely, the lady who has made more Grand Ole Opry appearances than anyone in history….PLUS the most exciting and talented group of young bluegrass pickers and singers you’ve ever witnessed, Cutter & Cash And Kentucky Grass. When I say “young,” they are 14 to 17 years in age and talented beyond belief. My Po’ Folks Band and I will round out the program.\n\nWe’ll have a meet ‘n greet session in the afternoon and the big show that evening. All proceeds will go to the Bill Anderson College Scholarship Fund at Commerce High School, helping provide higher educational funds for young graduates with an interest in furthering their study of music. You can get your tickets and any additional information you might need by clicking HERE. I sure hope lots of you will come be with us.\n\nFor any of you who might be in Nashville in late August, Bobby Tomberlin, Buddy Cannon, and I will do a songwriters night in the round at the famed Bluebird Cafe on August 29th.\n\nI am also being honored a couple of times this month with special presentations related to my 60-plus year career in country music. On August 19th, an organization called “Helping A Hero” will be honoring me at the Grand Ole Opry House with their Lifetime Achievement Award citing “your extraordinary career, patriotism, and service to our country’s service members and veterans.” I will accept this award with much pride and humility.\n\nAnd I told you last month about the Tennessee Association of Broadcasters recognizing me the following night by presenting me their annual Impact Award for my work over the years related to radio and television. Each of these awards is very special, and I truly appreciate them both.\n\nAgain this past month, unfortunately, we have suffered some significant losses within our country music community including the passing of Rusty Golden, son of William Lee Golden, and Joe Bonsall, the incredible tenor voice and onstage sparkplug of the Oak Ridge Boys. Joe and I were especially close due to our mutual love for music and baseball, and I’ll miss our back and forth text messages about his Philadelphia Phillies and my Atlanta Braves. My deepest condolences to William Lee and his family as well as to Joe’s wife, Mary, and their two daughters. Our circle is still unbroken, but, sadly, it keeps getting smaller.\n\nI appreciate your continued support of everything related to me – my songs, my recordings, my appearances, and especially my family. Have a great month, and we’ll see you back here again in September, shortly after Labor Day. Thanks again for everything!\n\nHi Gang:\n\nWelcome to our July newsletter. I appreciate your spending a few minutes with us as we continue to swelter in the summer heat and prepare for another big Independence Day celebration on Thursday. I wish for each of you a safe and happy 4th of July.\n\nOur team here in Whisperville is hard at work putting the finishing touches on our 6-song EP of new music titled, “Forevermore,” which is scheduled to be released in just a few weeks….August 16th to be exact. Crystal Gayle is coming in tomorrow to sing on one of the songs with me. I think our voices will have an interesting blend. This is always an exciting time in our business…sort of like the days before a new baby is born.\n\nI just found out a few days ago news of a very nice and unexpected honor that will be coming my way a few days after my record is released. The Tennessee Association of Broadcasters has named me the recipient of their 2024 Impact Award, presented each year to someone in our state whom they feel has contributed greatly to the overall broadcasting profession. I don’t know a lot of the specifics just yet, but I guess they figure my 63-years on the Grand Ole Opry count for something, along with my hosting several radio and TV shows over the years.The presentation will be in conjunction with the TAB’s annual convention here in Nashville on August 20th. I am very honored and humbled by this recognition, and will share more with you as I learn more myself.\n\nLooking back over my shoulder into June for a minute, I hope all the dads among you had a great Father’s Day and got to spend it with the special people in your lives. My daughters, Terri and Jenni, went to church with me that morning and we enjoyed a delicious buffet lunch together afterward. My son, Jamey, was off flying a big Delta jet across the skies somewhere and was missed. He came home the following Tuesday, though, and we got together then. My grandson, Blake, returned safely from his 5-week mission trip to the Czech Republic the same day, so there were lots of smiles around the Anderson house.\n\nAnd speaking of family, my granddaughter, Hallie, who turned 16 in May, spent a week last month attending the annual Songwriter’s Camp at the Country Music Hall of Fame. She and 23 other young aspiring writers from all across the country gathered to learn more about songwriting, and wrapped up their week with a Saturday concert in the Hall’s Ford Theater. It was Hallie’s very first time onstage playing guitar and singing a song she wrote. I was there popping the buttons off my shirt. She did very well, and her ol’ PawPaw couldn’t have been prouder.\n\nJune was also, unfortunately, a sad month in that several of my friends and co-workers passed away. The first disc jockey to ever play a Bill Anderson song on the radio, Red Healan, died down in Georgia at age 96. We lost the behind-the-scenes guru of Willie’s Roadhouse radio, Jeremy Tepper, who died unexpectedly of a heart attack at age 60. He was a brilliant man and a dear friend. Wayne Hobbs, who played steel guitar in my band for a year back in the 90’s, died of pancreatic cancer on June 10th. He was 72. And Buzz Cason, the wearer of many hats in the Nashville music community and a co-writing buddy of mine, passed at age 84. They will all be missed.\n\nJuly is a special month for me in that I will be marking my 63rd anniversary as a Grand Ole Opry member on the 15th. Our Opry appearances will be July 5th, 13th, 16th, and 20th. Mary Lou Turner, my longtime duet partner, will be joining me onstage July 20th.\n\nHave a great month, stay as cool as you can, and we’ll see you back here in August. As always, thanks for everything.\n\nSTOP THE PRESSES!\n\nIt has just been confirmed that our Bill Anderson & Friends concert in Commerce, Georgia, is a “GO” for Saturday September 14th, and we are making the first tickets available to our fan club members only!!\n\nBeginning today, July 1st, and continuing until July 6th, tickets will be held for only our members and will not be available to the general public. You can get all the information by clicking HERE.\n\nI hope lots of you will plan to join us for our first full concert in over four years inside the most special place I know, the Bill Anderson Performing Arts Center at Commerce High School. We’ll be announcing some special guest stars and special events later, but right now get those tickets and the best seats while they are available.\n\nProceeds are earmarked for the Bill Anderson Scholarship fund benefiting high school graduates who intend to pursue a music major in college.\n\nSee you in Commerce!!\n\nHi Gang:\n\nWell, it’s not “officially” Summer just yet, but I’ve always felt that Summer starts after Memorial Day and runs through Labor Day. Maybe it’s because Summer was defined that way when I was in school. Regardless, Memorial Day is in our rear view mirrors now (I hope you enjoyed yours!) and we’re calling it summertime in Whisperville. Welcome to our first newsletter of the season!\n\nAnother sure-fire way to know it’s summer is that CMA Fest will be upon us here in a few days. Country music fans from all around the world have already begun pouring into Nashville to celebrate with concerts, food, and fun. I plan to appear on the Grand Ole Opry Tuesday night June 4th for two shows, but other than that I’m laying low this year. I’ve taken part in the event that used to be known as Fan Fair for over fifty years. I’m glad to let the young folks have their moment in the sun (and the rain) this go ’round. (Our other Opry dates this month are June 18th and June 22nd.)\n\nI do have a little bit of news on the musical front, though, in that we’ve settled on a title for my upcoming new record release. It will be a six-song EP of love songs titled “Forevermore.” Our graphics crew is busy designing the artwork to accompany the music, and hopefully we’ll have something to show you soon. The release date will be August 16th. I’m really proud of this project, and I can’t wait to share it with you.\n\nI’ve also got another bit of exciting news. I haven’t worked a concert date on the road since February, 2020, just before COVID hit. I’ve never said I was “retired,” but going back on tour has not been at or near the top of my bucket list. However, an interesting opportunity has presented itself, and I may just take advantage of it.\n\nThe folks in my adopted hometown of Commerce, Georgia, have informed me that in September the Commerce High School football team will play the 1,000th game in school history. They feel this calls for a celebration, and they want me to come celebrate with them. You know the auditorium at Commerce High is called the Bill Anderson Performing Arts Center, and if I were to do a concert again there couldn’t be a more perfect place.\n\nNothing is definite but it might just happen. While the details are being ironed out, you might want to circle Saturday September 14th on your calendar…and start checking the mileage from where you live to Commerce. It sure would be fun to see a whole bunch of you again. Stay tuned…I’ll be telling you more as the time approaches.\n\nOn the personal side of things our longtime fiddle player and background singer, Kenzie Wetz, has announced her engagement to Joshua Donnici of Kansas City, and they have set their wedding date for December 1st. Wedding bells are going to sound like an alarm clock going off around here in the upcoming months. My granddaughter, Caroline, is getting married October 13th, Kenzie on December 1st, and my grandson, Blake, next April 27th.\n\nOn a not so happy note, my grandson, Gabe, has had a return of the cancer that all of us had hoped was gone for good. So many of you have prayed for him as he has battled this disease over the years, and your prayers are needed and welcomed again. He will be beginning treatment soon. Please pray that it will be successful. I’ll keep you posted.\n\nThanks for everything, and my best to you all."
