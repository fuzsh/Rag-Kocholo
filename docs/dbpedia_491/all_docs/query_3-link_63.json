        "text": "Maybe you’ve noticed it: That occasional hint of summer’s end? High in the 80s, the faintest of harbingers that cool weather may be queuing up. Shhhhhh, we’re not trying to alarm you, but September isn’t so far away.\n\nThe good news: You’ve still got time for Jersey Shore faves Johnson’s Popcorn and Manco and Manco—or maybe just stay home and hit one of the local events not far from your door.\n\nHello, August. We’re just hoping you keep the red-hot temperatures under control. Here’s a sample of what the month has to offer in greater Cumberland County. For even more, check the Community Calendar on pages 9 and 10.\n\nPeaches and Dreams\n\nRachel Pessolano has you covered. Load up the family in the minivan, fire up the popular map app Waze and ride your steed to The Shoppes at Dragon Village, 97 Trench Road in Bridgeton.\n\nThe Village will be celebrating South Jersey’s sweetest of crops—peaches. The Peach Festival is planned from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on August 17 and 18.\n\nThe festival, a longstanding tradition, was renewed when the Pessolano family took ownership of the Village. Now, with the Village under the new owners for three years, the festival has plenty of food and family-friendly fun for everyone.\n\nOf course, look for lots of peach-related desserts for sale, including chocolate-covered food at Kirsten’s Chocolate-Dipped Kreations, one of the shops at the Village.\n\nYou’ll probably see Pessolano hovering around Kristen’s chocolate shop.\n\n“She makes awesome chocolate-dipped peach rings. She does a ton of things. She does bakery items, too,” said Pessolano, who remarked about other hot sellers.\n\nThe shop sells everything from chocolate-covered Twinkies and (uhhhhh?) Slim Jims to the uber-popular chocolate-enrobed blueberries, which almost always sell out quickly.\n\nAlso, word has it that Murphy’s Farm Market in Mullica Hill will lay in a good supply of peach cider for the event.\n\n“It’s really good!” said Pessolano, event coordinator at the Village.\n\nIf you’re looking for some good old-fashioned food truck action, Dragon Village will host a bunch of those, serving everything from pizza, hamburgers and Mexican food to hot dogs and sausages.\n\nVendors selling a variety of crafts and wares will set up at the Village, and the shops will be open for browsing as well.\n\nThe kids will enjoy trackless train rides that circle the property, Pessolano said. For music, look for DJ Mike to take charge of the mic during both days.\n\nAt 2 p.m. on Saturday, a Peach Fuzz Baby Contest will be held for children ages two or younger.\n\n“Last year was the first time we had it. Oh, my gosh, it was so cute,” Pessolano said.\n\nAnother highlight for children will be the 4-H Kids’ Zone, which is the only dedicated space for young 4-H members apart from the organization’s facility on Morton Avenue in Millville. Here, young people from one year out of high school or younger can gather for crafts and various activities, she said.\n\n“It’s a one-of-a-kind thing,” Pessolano said. “No one in 4-H has their own dedicated space outside of the county office. It’s a unique thing we have at the Village.”\n\nThe cost of admission to the Village is $2 per carload.\n\nMillville’s Muster\n\nMillville’s fire muster brings out the kid in almost everyone.\n\nA hand touches the cool metal of a restored antique truck, and a 90-year-old grins. He becomes that nine-year-old again, if only for a moment.\n\nIt’s a sight that muster chairman John Burzichelli has watched many times in his years with the South Jersey chapter of the Glasstown Antique Fire Brigade.\n\nFirefighters aren’t the only ones who look forward to the Fire Muster and Firefighters’ Family Day at WheatonArts in Millville, which runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on August 18.\n\nThe event, now in its 43rd year, brings together collectors, firefighters, families of firefighters and lovers of fire trucks in one place.\n\nEach of these trucks has a story to tell, said Burzichelli. “That’s what gives these older trucks a great deal of personality.”\n\nMillville’s Fire Department has a functioning 1920 American LaFrance, he said. “It’s beautiful.”\n\nThe muster hosts from 80 to 100 fire trucks for an audience of about 3,000 people.\n\n“The event has a reputation of being one of the top five of its type in the country,” Burzichelli said. Plus, there is the advantage of its location right off of Route 55.\n\nTrucks pump water from the lake so visitors can see these trucks are functional, not just pretty. He said folks wander around WheatonArts and spot a truck that they know or recall when they were younger.\n\n“It’s as if they are having a reunion with an old friend,” he said.\n\nFire trucks are custom built, and largely reflect the personality of what are often volunteer fire departments. As a result, each of the trucks has plenty of personality.\n\nSure, modern trucks are loaded with computers, but he pointed out the fire trucks built in the 1950s pump out as much water as those built today. In the olden days, firefighters mostly rode on the back of the trucks on running boards, not in seats on the truck.\n\nA highlight of the day is the competition for Best in Show. It’s highly competitive, and the winner receives a hand-blown glass fireman’s trumpet designed by Wheaton Arts. This grand prize, which is highly coveted, is named in honor of Nancy Howe, the club’s first female engineer and an officer of the club who died of ALS, better known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease.\n\nThe day also includes the Firematic Flea Market, which sells antique apparatus parts, shirts, memorabilia, and toys for kids, he said. Visitors can also tour Wheaton’s Museum of Glass, shop in the stores or watch glass-blowing demonstrations.\n\nKids love the muster because there’s plenty to do, including a little “house” that they can squirt with a hose and crafts that they can take home with them.\n\n“At 3 p.m., when all the trucks are leaving, they all blow their horns and whistles. It’s one of the best parts of the day, and you can hear it from all over,” said Lori Johns, special events coordinator at WheatonArts. “A lot of things will be going on all day long—and it’s all free.”\n\nFood vendors will include Big Poppa Jai’s BBQ, Karen & the Nut, Matty G’s Dogz and Mac and Munchies, which sells sweets, bagels, bagel sandwiches and coffee, as well as McDowell’s Mobile Mess Hall and Chef Steve’s Popcorn.\n\nBattle of the Bands Finale\n\nKaycee Ray’s Sports Bar & Pub. 830 E. Landis Ave., Vineland has been hosting the Twisted Tea Battle of the Bands semi-finals at its location adjacent to the Landis Theater.\n\nNow, the sports bar will hold its finale at 8 p.m. on August 17. The event featured 18 bands competing against each other over three weeks. The winner will be decided at the event. For more information, call 856-839-0925.\n\nAdditional Highlights\n\n“Mr. Speed: Night of Kiss” will perform at 8 p.m. on August 23 at the Levoy Theater, 126 N. High St., Millville. Doors will open at 7 p.m. Cost: $39 to $49, plus fees. The band was crowned best KISS tribute band during a 2012 competition against 200 other bands.\n\nKids at Cumberland Players (CP) will present Mean Girls Jr. August 16–25 at the CP Theater, 66 E. Sherman Ave., Vineland. Showtimes vary. Cost: $15. For more information or to reserve tickets: cumberlandplayers.com.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz will be performed at the Levoy August 9–11 and August 15–18. Showtimes vary. Cost: $22 to $25, plus fees. For more details: levoy.net.\n\nThe documentary The Paradox of Seabrook Farms will be shown at 10:45 a.m. August 24 at the Levoy. The documentary sheds light on the history of the Seabrook family and their factory workers, people from different cultural backgrounds. A premiere earlier this summer sold out. Cost: $10, plus fees."
