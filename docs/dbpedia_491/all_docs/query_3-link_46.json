        "text": "\"Just remembering when I was a kid listening to Elvis records and all the 45s and singing along with all of his music, and just trying to capture every nuance and vocal trick he was doing,\" McDowell says. When called for this\n\n\"The King Is Gone,\" which McDowell penned and released following Presley's death, also in 1977, went one to sell more than five million copies. Since then McDowell has notched more than 30 top 40 hits, including the chart-toppers \"Older Women\" and \"You're Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation.\"\n\nOn March 28, McDowell, will celebrate his birthday - he turns 64 on March 25 - with a 7 p.m. show at the Von Braun Center Playhouse, located at 700 Monroe St. Lee Gibson and Chris McDaniel will open the show, which starts at 7 p.m. Tickets ($30 advance, $33 door) are available online via onfireconcerts.com or by calling 615-412-9653.\n\nMcDowell is psyched about an upcoming TV project he's working on called 'Music City Late Night.\" \"It will be like Jimmy Kimmel or Jay Leno ... Have musical guests and comedians and just a mixture of guests and then I'll sing a song every night and I'm the host as well.\"\n\nThe first time McDowell heard songwriter Jamie O'Hara's demo recording of \"Older Women,\" a tune trumpeting the sexual abilities of females of a certain age, he wasn't crazy about it. \"I thought it was detrimental to women,\" McDowell says, \"but a lot of women around loved it so we recorded it and I did it in one take and it was a number one record.\"\n\nMcDowell has recorded for Curb Records since 1986, the year he released a duet with Conway Twitty, \"It's Only Make Believe,\" a cover of Twitty's late-50s hit of the same name. McDowell has also worked with early-rock legend Jerry Lee Lewis and The Righteous Brothers' Bill Medley.\n\nThe 1979 Dick Clark-produced TV movie \"Elvis\" is known for featuring Kurt Russell, who would soon breakout as a movie star, in the titular role as the superstar singer. While it might have been Russell's hips gyrating to Presley classics, such as \"Suspicious Minds,\" \"Mystery Train\" and \"Heartbreak Hotel,\" it was McDowell's voice on all 25 songs in the film. (McDowell recorded 36 for the production.)\n\nA glance at the lineup for McDowell's band reveals two more McDowells besides the singer. \"My children have pretty much been working with me all their lives, and when (son) Ronnie Dean (McDowell) became an accomplished drummer he just took over the drumming part,\" Ronnie says. \"And then my nephew Jody McDowell he has learned his craft well so he became my piano player. It doesn't get any better than family.\"\n\nClick through the above photo gallery to view images of Ronnie McDowell and his album covers through the years."
