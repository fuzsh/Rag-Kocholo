        "text": "The Love Tattoo Foundation benefits will be held at the Waynesville, OH venue, owned by country artist, Richard Lynch and his wife. Richard will also perform.\n\nKeepin’ It Country Farm is located in the beautiful and historic town of Waynesville, Ohio. It is home to country music artist Richard Lynch, his wife Donna and a variety of critters. Their passion for maintaining the traditions of real country music compelled them to construct a one-of-a-kind, stunning barn-style structure on their working farm, for private country music events to raise funds and show support of our veterans. Past performers at the Farm include country stars Confederate Railroad, Buddy Jewell, Jeannie Seely, Ronnie McDowell, Highway 101, TG Sheppard, and many others.\n\nNow, Richard, Donna and Keepin’ It Country Farm are pleased to announce the following shows, already scheduled for 2021:\n\nJune 26. Richard Lynch Band and guests\n\nJuly 17. Richard Lynch Band hosting Alex Miller from. American Idol\n\nAugust 28. Richard Lynch Band hosting Merlin Gene from RFD-TV\n\nAll ticket information and purchases: http://www.lovetattoofoundation.org\n\nDonna & Richard’s dedication to country music, as well as our American Heroes, has continued on, as the Farm is now home to The Ohio Country Music Hall of Fame, The Traditionally Lynch TV & radio shows and their personal charity, The Love Tattoo Foundation, a registered non-profit to support our veterans. https://www.keepinitcountryfarm.com\n\nABOUT RICHARD LYNCH: Over the past 3 decades, Richard Lynch has compiled a long list of country hits and chart-toppers on both domestic and international sales and radio airplay charts, including two #1 iTunes chart singles, multiple #1 New Music Weekly radio songs, #1 IndieWorld and Roots Music Report chart tracks and a Christian Music Weekly Top 20 single. Richard has been in Billboard Magazine, Taste Of Country, The Boot, CCM Magazine, Country Music People, and countless others. He has also appeared on WSM Radio Nashville, RFD TV, Fox TV and more. He has recorded popular duets with legendary artists like Ronnie McDowell and Leona Williams, as well as Grammy Winner, Rhonda Vincent. Richard Lynch is a proud member of the Ohio Country Music Hall of Fame and the Independent Country Music Hall of Fame. Lynch is also the owner of Keepin’ It Country Farm in Waynesville, OH and co-founder of Love Tattoo Foundation that assists veterans. http://www.richardlynchband.com\n\nABOUT ALEX MILLER: Launched to global audiences during American Idol, Season 19, this Kentucky-born singer/songwriter still finds time to help his Grandpa, G.B., on the family’s cattle farm, participate in Future Farmers of America events, and sing at church when he can. Wise beyond his years, Alex is a class-A cutup and fun-loving charmer; a bonafide torch-carrying champion of traditional Country music with an arresting voice, he’s been performing professionally since the age of seven. His career progressed steadily from shows in and around his hometown of Lancaster, Kentucky to larger markets and venues, including the Dolby Theatre, Lucas Oil Stadium, WoodSongs, Renfro Valley, and more. His expressive voice and traditional approach brought him early success and Alex was building a name for himself as the young newcomer to watch. That slow and steady approach ended with his AI audition and, while he tapped out of the show as a Top 50 finalist, he is more focused on his music than ever before. He’s traded in the methodical approach for a no-holds-barred run at the big time and is well on his way. His debut single, “I’m Over You So Get Over Me,” is already a fan favorite and receiving terrific response at radio."
