        "text": "BECHTELSVILLE, PA – The management of Big Diamond and Grandview Speedways are informing all competitors that the decision to ban the left side pan hard bar suspension for 358 Modified and 602 Sportsman race teams that compete weekly at both raceways, will go into effect as planned.\n\nThe Rogers Family who promote and operate Grandview Speedway in Bechtelsville, Pa. and Jake Smulley who promotes and operates Big Diamond Speedway in Forestville, Pa. have been studying and researching the hot topic in local auto racing – the left side pan hard bar suspension that has become a common set-up for Modified & Sportsman teams over recent seasons.\n\nBoth Speedways announced the change before the start of the 2024 race season, giving racers time to prepare, before all race teams must return to the standard right side suspension set-up to begin the 2025 race season.\n\nThe left-side suspension set-up has become a controversial issue regarding how the suspension has made for several dramatic changes in local stock car racing, changes that have been noted by both track promotional teams over the last couple race seasons.\n\nThe left-side suspension allows the race cars to really ‘hook-up’ to the track, by allowing the cars to transfer weight from one side to the other during a race upon entering and exiting the corners. This constant twisting has been causing an extra strain on the drive line parts on all race cars, as well as engines and increased tire wear.\n\nThe rule change for the 2025 season will read as follows:\n\n2025 SEASON REAR PAN HARD ROD RULE\n\n*Right rear pan hard rod or W-link ONLY mounted on right side of rear\n\n*NO left rear pan hard rod or J-bar permitted\n\n*Right and Left rear radius rods must be a minimum of 24”\n\n*Left rear radius rod maximum height of 14” from floor to center of front heim\n\n*Right rear pan hard rod minimum length of 15”\n\nTrack managements are looking to put the driving back in the hands of the drivers.\n\nRace teams with any questions can call Grandview tech officials Cliff Quinn at 484-357-2587 or Ed Scott at 610-298-2408.\n\nInformation for Grandview Speedway is always available at www.grandviewspeedway.com or on Facebook, or by telephone at 610.754.7688."
