        "text": "#OlderWomen Remake By The Sheltons Trending on TikTok\n\nWith Nearly 130 Million Views\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. – Country music hitmaker Ronnie McDowell is celebrating the 40th Anniversary of his hit single, “Older Women” which reached number one in 1981. Now, in 2021 “Older Women ” has gone viral on TikTok reaching nearly 130 million views and counting through a cover by The Sheltons. At the encouragement of his legendary producer, Buddy Killen, Ronnie wanted to celebrate ladies who don’t let their age dictate their actions and a social standard silence their youth. This is one of the rare singles that not only bring light into a serious world but also applies to all generations with a message that will live on through time.\n\n“I was very reluctant about recording “Older Women” because I thought it would be detrimental to women but was I ever wrong,” explains McDowell. “It actually made ladies over 40 feel good about themselves and it lifted them up! I never knew 40 years later I would be singing the song over 15,000 times. But you know what, every time I sing it, it’s still just as fresh as the first time.”\n\nSince his breakout tribute to Elvis Presley, “The King is Gone” took the world by storm, Ronnie McDowell has charted more than thirty Top 40 hits on the Billboard country music charts. Two of his singles, “Older Women” and “You’re Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation,” reached No. 1 on the country charts. He has also released more than twenty studio albums."
