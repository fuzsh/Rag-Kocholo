        "text": "FRANKLIN, PA- After a highly successful Fan Appreciation Night, Tri City Raceway Park is getting ready for the stretch run of the 2024 season. With just five races left on the 2024 schedule, there will be an exciting change of pace to the racing program set for this Sunday, August 11. The ULMS Late Model Series will be back at the big Venango County oval for the first time since 2021.\n\n“We are so pleased that the fans came out to support us on Fan Appreciation Night,” said track owner Josh Shiffer. “We hope that they enjoyed themselves and liked what they saw and that they make plans to come back before the curtain falls on our first season of operation,” he added. “This Sunday would be a great time for all to see the return of the ULMS Late Models.”\n\n“We are excited to be back at Tri City Raceway Park,” said ULMS Series Director Trevor Zuver. “The race will pay $5,000 to win and $500 to start, so we expect a good turn out of racers,” he added. Zuver anticipates that this purse structure will be the norm for 2025, with some higher paying races mixed into the schedule. “I hope this event is successful because we do want Tri City on our schedule for the years to come.”\n\nOne driver that Zuver has confirmed will be Max Blair, of nearby Centerville. “Max cut his teeth at Tri City, and he was a big advocate for this race to be added to the schedule,” Zuver explained. “He does not get to race so close to home very often, so he is really looking forward to this.”\n\nZuver’s ULMS regulars will be led into battle by Michael Lake. The Uniontown driver currently sits atop the series standings in this, his rookie season with the touring series. Logan Zarin, of Moon Township, has committed to the event, along with Dave Stamm, of Millmont. Dylan Lewis will make the long tow from Oakland, MD, and Jon Rohacevich will carry the flag for the Empire State.\n\nRegional talents like Jared Miley, the winner of the last ULMS race held at Tri City, and Alex Ferree, a recent ULMS winner, will be ready to go.\n\nAnd, Franklin’s own Tyler Wyant will continue his development as a Late Model racer at a track that he mastered as a teenager driving a Pro Stock. Wyant has made several Pro Stock appearances at Tri City this season, so maybe fans will get to see him race in two divisions!\n\nIn addition to the ULMS Late Models, the Krill Recycling 410 Sprint Cars will be racing, along with the Hovis Auto & Truck Supply Pro Stocks and the 4 Your Car Connection RUSH Sprint Cars. The 21st Century Energy Group Modifieds will have the week off, but they will return for the big Ryder Memorial event sanctioned by the BRP Modified Tour on August 18.\n\nThere is a tremendous battle for the top spot in the Krill Recycling 410 Sprint Cars. Bob Felmlee is clinging to a one-point lead over two-time and defending track champion A.J. Flick. Matt Farnham picked up his second victory of the season last week, and he will face challenges from Andy Cavanaugh, Jeremy Weaver, Jack Sodeman, Jr., and many more!\n\nIn the Hovis Auto & Truck Supply Pro Stocks, Rod Laskey now leads Pat Fielding by twenty-eight markers in the quest for the track championship. Josh Seippel is also in contention for the title. Doug Iorio, II, Russ Coyne, Jason Kimmy, and Bobby and Jake Whitling are just a few of the other racers who could snatch a win!\n\nJohn Mollick still has a firm grip on the 4 Your Car Connection RUSH Sprint Car standings. But, Blaze Myers Brent Rhebergen, Arnie Kent, and Joe Buccola are ready to step into victory lane, too.\n\nTicket prices for this special event will be $20 for adults. Seniors (ages 62 and up), students (ages 11 to 16), and military will be $18, all with proper identification. The children (ages 10 and under) will be free. Pit passes will be $40, except for those age two or under. They will be admitted to the Pits for $15.\n\nThe pit gates will open at 2 p.m. Late Model hot laps will be at 5:45, with qualifications immediately thereafter. The heat races will follow.\n\nMark your racing calendars for the Ryder Memorial on August 18. The BRP sanctioned Modifieds will be back with a double feature program on September 1 as part of the big Oil Region Labor Day Classic.\n\nThe divisional sponsors of Tri City Raceway Park for 2024 are: Krill Recycling, LLC (410 Sprint Cars), 21st Century Energy Group (Modifieds), Hovis Auto & Truck Supply (Pro Stocks), and 4 Your Car Connection (RUSH Sprint Cars).\n\nAll competitors at Tri City Raceway Park will be eligible for the Marsh Heating & Cooling Heat Race Challenge. The driver that wins the most heat races over the course of the season, regardless of the class, will receive a special award.\n\nOther marketing partners of Tri City Raceway Park for 2024 include: Erie Beer, Wab-Tec (manufacturer of locomotive engines), Schaeffer Lubricants, Keystone Transit (school buses), Blue Ox Timbers (buyers of timberland timber land management), Constable Refuse (residential and commercial garbage collectors), First Rate Realty (real estate sales), Landscape Connection (portable toilets and landscape supplies), KEI-Klapec Express Inc. (trucking company), BKI-Bert Klapec Inc. (excavation and demolition), Shambaugh Towing, Gibson Hill Automotive (auto repair), McCandless Ford Sales (located in Mercer and Meadville), McCandless Trailer Sales (located in Mercer and Meadville), Big Dog RC (remote controlled cars and race track), McGregor Excavating, Les Frickshun (lubricants and undercoating), Bish Heating & Cooling, Wet Hose LLC (pressure washing), Heffern Septic Service, Tionesta Builders Supply (located in Tionesta and Shippenville), UCIP-United Community Independence Program (housing and services for the handicapped), Close Racing Supply, Billy’s Garage & Towing, Oakland-Rampart Equipment (makers of centrifugal dryers, wash systems, and separators), Shaw Industries (machine shop), Welding Technologies, Froggie Radio, and Hards Welding.\n\nRemember that you will need to check the Facebook page, Tri City Raceway Park, for current information. The former website is not updated and will soon be replaced.\n\nTri-City Raceway Park is located just a few miles north of Franklin, PA, at 3430 State Route 417 in Oakland Township. Professional auto racing is presented in a family friendly atmosphere most Sunday evenings from May through Labor Day weekend."
