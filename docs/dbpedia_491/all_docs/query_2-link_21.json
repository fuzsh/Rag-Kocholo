        "text": "Former Ronnie McDowell backup singer visits Elvis Presley Birthplace\n\nTUPELO, MISS. (WCBI) – A singer who is rising in popularity received inspiration from a visit to the birthplace of Elvis Presley before a concert in the All America city.\n\nJohnathan Len is known to many as the lead singer of the 50s acapella group, “Blend.” He also worked with artists such as Ronnie McDowell and Ray Walker, a member of the “Jordanaires” who backed up Elvis on a number of his songs.\n\nLike many artists who visit Tupelo, Len took time to visit the Elvis Presley Birthplace and Museum.\n\nHe sayid it’s amazing how Elvis influenced virtually all types of music.\n\n“I didn’t know what to expect but this is really done up super nice and we just had church over here at the church where Elvis went to, I was blown away by it, grounds are beautiful here,” said Len.\n\nLen just recorded a song by McDowell, called “You Will Never Leave My Mind.” The song is about Elvis’ longtime friend, Memphis DJ George Klein, who recently passed away.\n\nLen is in Tupelo for a concert at the Elvis Presley Fan Club’s monthly meeting."
