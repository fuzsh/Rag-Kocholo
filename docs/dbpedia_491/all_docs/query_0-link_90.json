        "text": "“Nothing But The Hits” Heads to 16 Cities In Christmas Season\n\nThe 2015 Christmas Season will get a powerful punch of seasonal spirit as over twenty of music’s most talented musicians and artists will take the stage in 17 of America’s greatest cities as the “Nothing But The Hits” tour gets underway.\n\nMultimillion record selling artists Ronnie McDowell, Deborah Allen, Ken Mellons, and Tommy Cash headline the concert while stellar and hit making artists Amber Hayes, Teea Goans and Blend round out a night of entertainment that few have ever seen! Special guests include Coral Reefer Nadirah Shakoor, Jeff Bates and Mandy Barnett as they will be part of a select group of dates.\n\nPromoter Danny Rasberry noted that there is movement beginning to go back to traditional country music.\n\n“Out on the road this year, you could see it. There is a void and a need for “real” country music. Fans are responding and filling up the seats. With this tour, we put together some of the most sensational voices in music. I know the fans will love what will be coming their way!\n\n“We have a 15 piece band playing with the artists including a 4 piece horn section. The word that comes to mind when I look at this group of entertainers is “underrated”. As entertainers, voices, songwriters, and even producers, not many can hold a candle to this group. For someone who loves music done right, it’s a concert not to be missed!!! Our group of entertainers have been responsible for over 100 top 100 hits!”\n\nRonnie McDowell has often been called an entertainer’s entertainer.\n\n“I’ve been doing concerts since 1980,” Rasberry said. “and I have simply seen him only get better. He’s unbelievable in concert and everyone leaves throughly entertained!”\n\nMcDowell has scored over 20 hits in his career with over 11,000,000 records sold. With hits like “Older Women”, “You’re Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation”, “Personally”, “The King Is Gone”, “Unchained Melody”, “In A New York Minute”, “Watching Girls Go By” to name a few, McDowell has made his mark in music.\n\nTommy Cash is the brother of the late Johnny Cash. Tommy scored his biggest hit in 1969 with “Six White Horses” and has had 19 top twenty hits. Tommy has put together a tribute for his brother that shouldn’t be missed.\n\nDeborah Allen took off like a rocket in the 80’s with her monster hit, “Baby, I Lied”. Through the decades, she has been known as one of music’s greatest songwriters for major artists but her own hits like “I Hurt For You” and “Rockin’ Little Christmas” has made her a household name.\n\nAllen is a big part of Siriusxm Radio’s “Prime Country” interviewing country stars on a weekly basis as her program has become one of the most popular in country music.\n\nKen Mellons can sing a song like none other. His voice is a little bit John Anderson, Vern Gosdin, and Merle Haggard. Strong and soulful, Mellons scored major hits with “Rub A Dubbin’” and “Jukebox Junkie” in the 90’s. You never forget being part of a Ken Mellons concert.\n\nAmber Hayes is coming off of her fourth top forty country music hit, “Running Out of Memories”. Her new single, “Hero’s Heart” is being shipped to radio now. It’s a tribute song for her great uncle, who was awarded the Medal of Honor last year, along with all who have served. Hayes is no stranger to theatre, where she performed as Kathy Twitty in the Conway Twitty musical that toured throughout the United States, or in film, where she starred in “Cowgirls and Angels” and “Cowgirls and Angels II”.\n\nTeea Goans believes in traditional country music. Her third and latest album, “Memories to Burn” shows the character and heart of this incredible talent. Teea has made multiple appearances on “Larry’s Country Diner,” and “Country’s Family Reunion,” and she’s performed numerous times on the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nBlend is a group of young men who travel the country performing acapella and with music. Their passion for music is unquestioned as they have entertained fans from all regions of America.\n\nNadirah Shakoor, featured vocalist for Jimmy Buffett’s Coral Reefer Band will be a part of the tour’s first three dates. Shakoor has been one of the notable Coral Reefers for over twenty years and has traveled the world playing to an average of 20,000+ fans each night! She was also the lead vocalist for Arrested Development where she garnered a Grammy nomination.\n\nLong known to be one of the best demo singers in Nashville, Jeff Bates hit it big with his first single, “Long Slow Kisses”. Followed by “Love Song”, Bates became one of country’s biggest stars. Often compared to the great Conway Twitty, Bates latest album, “Me and Conway” shows his appreciation to the legendary voice and man. Bates was awarded the ICM Faith, Family and Country Award for Mainstream Country Artist. Bates will play on eight of the tour dates.\n\nCalled the most “powerful and spellbinding” voice in music, Mandy Barnett lives up to the reviews. As a teenager, she starred as Patsy Cline in the production of “Always…Patsy Cline” and she has never looked back. She is known in Nashville as one of the hardest working acts in town. Her performance of “Hurt” with the Nashville Symphony this year will go down as one of the most classical and historic performance ever performed.\n\nAlong with the vocalists on tour, pedal steel player and a member of the Texas Steel Player’s Hall of Fame Doyle Grisham will be performing. Grisham is also a member of Jimmy Buffett’s Coral Reefer band and has played on numerous recordings since the early 70’s with Buffett. Former Coral Reefer Amy Lee will be playing saxophone. Ken Watters who has played with Frank Sinatra and Santana will be on horns as well along with Chuck Lyons and Stuart Naylor. Andrea Young of Farewell Angelina will be on fiddle, along with Luke Bryan’s and Mustang Sally’s former fiddle player, Kristy Mellons. The Grand Ole Opry’s piano player for 38 years, Tim Atwood, will be on keys. Atwood has just released his first album called, “Give This Piano A Drink!”. Ronnie’s band members Ronnie Dean McDowell will be on drums along with James Ducker on guitar and Eddie Weidow on bass.\n\nThe tour begins in Stillwater, Oklahoma on Saturday, November 28 at the Oklahoma vs Oklahoma State tailgate party! Next dates will include Concordia, Kansas at the Brown Grand Theatre on November 30; Kansas City, Missouri at Knuckleheads on December 1; Springfield, Missouri at the Gillioz Theatre on December 2; a private event in Tulsa on December 3; Okemah, Oklahoma at the Crystal Theatre on December 4; Ponca City, OK at the Poncan Theatre on December 5; Van Buren, Arkansas at the King’s Opera House on December 7; Hattiesburg, Mississippi at the Saenger Theatre on December 9; private show in Biloxi, Mississippi on the 10th, Natchez, Mississippi at the Natchez Center of Performing Arts on December 11, and in Crowley, Louisiana at the Grand Opera House of the South on December 12.\n\nThe tour resumes in Benton, Kentucky on December 15 at the Kentucky Opry. Then, it moves to the Cox Capital Theatre in Macon, Georgia on December 16; Calhoun, Ga at The Gem Theatre on December 17; The Morton Theatre in Athens, Georgia on December 18 and finishes up at the beautiful Newberry Opry House in Newberry, South Carolina on December 19.\n\nRasberry noted discounted ticket prices. “In a day, where it’s hard to see a great concert for less than $100, we are offering affordable tickets. Give yourself a huge Christmas present this year, and pick up tickets for this concert. It’s going to be GREAT!”\n\nwww.nothingbutthehits.com\n\nFor more information call 601-649-2822."
