        "text": "SWEDESBORO, NJ-The Bridgeport Motorsports Park presented a four division show as they welcomed the return of the United Racing Club on Saturday night. The show was sponsored by BRB Contractors and featured the Ice Less 602 Sportsman, the Roveda Speed Street Stocks and the Triple R Truck Parks Four Cylinders along with the winged sprints of URC who last appeared at the Kingdom of Speed during the 2022 season.\n\nWhen the green flag waved on the URC feature event, Tyler Ross grabbed the lead from his fourth position start. Hayden Miller starrted from the pole and raced in second with Reese Nowatarski, who was fastest in warm-ups, racing in third. Ronald Helmick and JT Ferry completed the top five in the early going.\n\nA red flag brought the action to a halt on lap ten when Brandon McGough ran into trouble on the backstretch, making contact with the wall after a rough ride. The safety crew went to work quickly. McGough escaped injury.\n\nThe restart saw Ross lead the way as Weller raced into second followed by Miller, Nowatarski and JT Ferry.\n\nRoss, who won the last URC race, looked liked he was on his way to another win but the caution waved with two to go when Miller needed attention in turn two. The field went back to the green nose-to-tail and Weller was pressuring Ross for the lead.\n\nIt was a race for the lead as Ross and Weller battled to the checkered. Weller held the advantage as the two drivers raced out of turn four for the final time. They were side-by-side but Weller had the advantage at the finish line. Nowatarski finished third behind Weller and Ross with Ferry in fourth and Robbie Stillwaggon in fifth. Ken Meisner finished sixth over Ryan Stillwaggon, Jonathan Swift, Ron Helmick and Randy Wilbert.\n\nAfter a disappointing run in his heat race, Weller and crew made major changes before the feature. “We threw everything at it,” for the feature, Weller noted, “and we had a rocket.”\n\nThe Ice Less 602 Sportsman saw Brian Papiez race to his fourth win of the season and put himself on top of the win column in this division. Polesitter, Jax Yohn led the field from the start as Papiez made his way to the front from his tenth place starting position. Billy Chester, Michael Beckett, Brian Rogers and Travis Hill made up the top five in the early going.\n\nYohn caught the back of the field on lap ten. Papiez raced in fourth behind Chester and Hill. Just before half way, Papiez challenged Hill for third. A caution at the half way mark allowed Papiez to take the lead on the restart.\n\nPapiez raced to the finish with Yohn and Hill in second and third, respectively. Ethan Bill made his way to fourth and Billy Chester rounded out the top five for one of his best performances. Michale Beckett finished sixth after running among the top five. He was followed by Ethan Young, Trent Willey, Howie Finch and Matt Peck to complete the top ten.\n\nIt was a good night for Papiez who made his performance seem effortless but it actually comes about from a lot of work and preparation.\n\nGary Bozowski led the way for the first three laps of the Triple R Truck Street Stock feature event with Mike Hughes and multi-time champion, Tom Wills, Jr. followed.\n\nOrmsbee moved into third on the second circuit. Rob Ormsbee was challenging for the lead when the caution waved for Mike Hughes who ran into trouble off of turn two. Both Hughes and Chris Allen headed to the pits under the caution. Ormsbee took the lead on the restart.\n\nBozowski pulled off the track with engine gremlins on lap six. Wills moved into third.\n\nThe final laps were riddled with issues. Wills battled with Ensinger, Jr. for second and even challenged for the lead before he slowed before the checkered. Nick Sandone III relinquished a top five finish when he ran into problems in turn two.\n\nOrmsbee raced to the win over Ensinger, Jr., Cox, Chris Lane and Kevin Heckman.\n\nDan Stein, Jr. raced to his fourth win of the season in the Triple R Truck Part 4 Cylinder feature and his fourth win in a row.\n\nThe early laps saw a three car battle for the lead between Joe Garey, Jr., Lee Allen and Stein. Garey, Jr. led the first five laps but it was all Stein from lap six to the checkered.\n\nLee Allen finished second followed by Joe Garey, Jr., Joe Garey, Sr. and Roger Kumnerer.\n\nICE LESS LLC 602 SPORTSMAN FEATURE (25 LAPS)\n\n1.
