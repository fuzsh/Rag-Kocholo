        "text": "Michael is originally from Charleston, SC. His original entry into the music field was country music. During this time he had the opportunity to stand side by side with many recording artist such as; Conway Twitty, Ronnie McDowell, Alabama, Ricky Skaggs, Archie Campbell, Reba McEntire and even had the rare opportunity to stand side by side with Roy Acuff on the Grand Old Opry stage. But this lifestyle led him down some wrong roads in life. He lived near a church that he could actually see from his home, but he never stepped foot in that church until one day a young couple from his neighborhood invited him. One morning in that church he walked to the altar, got down on his knees and gave his life to the Lord. He then realized he was now standing side by side with the one that really matters.\n\nIn 1995 he recorded his own Southern Gospel Music CD. He then sent it out to radio stations and took the time to call the disc jockeys and asked them to play his music. Then the next amazing thing happened........\n\nThe song \"IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD DAY\" charted at #34 in the Top 40 in the USA. he was then booked in over 250 concerts a year singing full-time throughout the United States. His music then reached out the USA. He became the first Southern Gospel Music Singer to have five songs simultaneously chart in the Top 25 in the UK on SonRise Radio and two of those songs \"BY FAITH\" and \"IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD DAY\" reached #1 on the charts.\n\nHe was also invited as special guest on \"Dove Broadcasting TV Network\" and the \"Atlanta Live TV Network\".\n\nWhat makes this incredible, all this happened without a Radio Promoter, Booking Agent or Record Company.\n\nHe met Judy, in August of 1996 when he was singing on the road. Five months later he married her and then moved to her hometown of Swainsboro, GA. where they now reside.\n\nIn 2013 he prayed and the Lord told him it was time to get off the road from full-time ministry. Michael now is managing Main Street Market Antique Mall. He also owns the Music Memories Museum located inside Main Street Market, where you can see his private collection of items and clothing once owned by famous musicians in Country, Rock & Roll, R&B and Gospel Music.\n\nVisit Website www.musicmemoriesmuseum.com\n\nHis favorite verse is \" I will do those things that always please Him...John 8:29.."
