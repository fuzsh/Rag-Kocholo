        "text": "How can a volleyball player position oneself for meaningful NIL opportunities? Spending time making a plan before becoming a time-strapped college athlete is a great place to start! Ready to jump in? Let’s go.\n\nFor most, participating in NIL is not a handout but rather a part-time job. It requires dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of research, strategic planning and outreach to be successful. Thus far, the most successful non high-profile athletes have taken the initiative in creating NIL deals for themselves.\n\nWhat does NIL really mean and why does it matter? In legal language, name, image, and likeness make up the three pieces of one’s “right to publicity.\" Michelle Meyer of the NIL Network shares the basics to understanding what NIL means for athletes.\n\nNoodle bowls are one of the most versatile options that busy parents can make to keep athletes well-fed and properly fueled—and most noodle bowls can be repurposed into leftovers for lunch or tweaked into entirely new meals for the next night!\n\nWhile perseverance sounds like a very serious skill, it can be fun to learn for your young athletes if you make persisting through tough challenges into a playful activity. These activities for every age group will spark conversations around perseverance while encouraging experimentation and play.\n\nThe U.S. men’s beach team of Miles Partain and Andy Benesh completed their Olympic run in Paris in the quarterfinals with a 2-0 (21-14, 21-16) loss to Cherif Younousse and Ahmed Tijan of Qatar on Wednesday. Partain and Benesh, the youngest U.S. men’s beach team in Olympic history, ran off three consecutive wins to reach the quarters.\n\nThe U.S. women’s beach team of Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng finished fifth at the Paris Olympics after dropping their quarterfinal match to the Swiss combination of Tanja Hüberli and Nina Brunner, 2-0 (21-18, 21-19) on Tuesday. The 2023 world champions ended the Olympics with a 4-1 record.\n\nThe U.S. beach team of Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss came from behind late in both sets on Monday before falling to Melissa Humana-Paredes and Brandie Wilkerson of Canada in the Paris Round of 16, 2-0 (21-19, 21-18). Kloth/Nuss posted a 3-1 record in their first Olympic appearance and finished ninth.\n\nRunning its option offense with great effectiveness, the U.S. beach team of Miles Partain and Andy Benesh defeated Paolo Nicolai and Samuele Cottafava of Italy, 2-0 (21-17, 21-18) on Monday to advance to the quarterfinals of the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe U.S. beach team of Miles Evans and Chase Budinger fell to the defending Olympic gold medalists Anders Mol and Christian Sørum of Norway, 2-0 (21-16, 21-14) in the Round of 16 in Paris on Monday. Evans/Budinger earned a pair of wins and placed ninth in their first Olympic appearance."
