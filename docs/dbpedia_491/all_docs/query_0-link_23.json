        "text": "Country hit-maker Ronnie McDowell, best known for his string of hits in the ’80’s including “Older Women,” is also an artist of the painting kind! After having a piece of his work discovered by the folks at Disney Fine Art, he has now signed a 5-year deal with the Disney company to produce artwork for them. His paintings will be seen in Disney parks and galleries all around the world!\n\n“All of my kids are involved in this project,” says Ronnie, “My youngest daughter Athena told me I should do some paintings featuring Disney characters, so my youngest son Tyler and I came up with the idea of Walt leaving Kansas City making his way to California from Union Station at 8 o’clock with Mickey in front of him.” Ronnie Dean, my oldest son along with being my drummer and tour manager for 20 years now, gave me the idea for Elvis teaching Mickey how to dance on the Ed Sullivan Show.”\n\nDisney Fine Art is available in art galleries throughout Europe, Japan and North America as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Theme Parks around the world."
