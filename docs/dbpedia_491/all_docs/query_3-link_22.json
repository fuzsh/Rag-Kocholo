        "text": "This weekend sees a couple of big acts coming to local River Region venues:\n\nRonnie McDowell at Carl's Country\n\nRonnie McDowell has an amazing string of hit songs that he has amassed over the years, but it is his riveting stage presence and genuine warmth that fills the seats again and again.\n\nHe’ll be performing 9 p.m. Friday at Carl’s Country, 426 County Road 4 in Prattville, with opening act Amber Hayes. Tickets are $20 in advance at stubwire.com, and $25 at the door.\n\nThis is a 21 and up show.\n\nFollowing the death of Elvis Presley in 1977, Ronnie McDowell came out of nowhere to dazzle the world with his heartfelt and self-penned tribute song “The King Is Gone” on the independent Scorpion label. The record took off immediately, gaining airplay on country and pop stations across the country and around the world. To date, “The King Is Gone” has sold more than 5 Million copies.\n\nAll of a sudden, the young Vietnam Veteran from Portland, Tennessee was a star, and he quickly proved that he wasn’t just a one-trick pony. McDowell scored a second hit for the Scorpion label titled “I Love You, I Love You, I Love You” before being wooed and signed by CBS Records – Epic label in 1979.\n\nMcDowell charted a string of hit singles and albums for Epic between 1979 and 1986. Every single release with the exception of just one became a Top 10 Hit including the chart toppers “Older Women” and “You’re Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation.” Other hits during his Epic years included “Watchin Girls Go By,” “Personally,” “You Made A Wanted Man Of Me,” “All Tied Up,” and “In A New York Minute.”\n\nMoving to Curb Records in 1986, his current label to date, McDowell scored a Top 10 hit with “It’s Only Make Believe,” a duet with Conway Twitty on what was Twitty’s breakthrough hit from 1958. Two years later Ronnie teamed up with Jerry Lee Lewis for a rocking duet that McDowell wrote titled,”You’re Never Too Old To Rock N’ Roll.” He also recorded yet another Top 10 hit with his version of the pop standard “Unchained Melody,” which also became a #1 country music video. To date, McDowell has scored over 30 top ten records. His entertaining abilities soared and he began to draw larger crowds. He started appearing in larger venues and touring with artists such as Conway Twitty, Tammy Wynette and Loretta Lynn before headlining his own shows.\n\nTwo of McDowell’s most recent projects on Curb Records include an album of beach music with Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Bill Pinkney’s Original Drifters, entitled, “Ronnie McDowell with Bill Pinkney’s Original Drifters.” The second project is a new country album titled “Ronnie McDowell Country,” a collection of six new McDowell penned songs, and a few country standards by such Legendary writers as Buck Owens, Harlan Howard and Dallas Frazier.\n\nAnthony Gomes at Capitol Oyster Bar\n\nCanadian native blues rocker Anthony Gomes will be shaking things up on the river Sunday at Capitol Oyster Bar, 617 Shady St., Montgomery.\n\nThere's a $15 cover.\n\nThe No. 1 Billboard Blues Artist, is a triple threat force as a guitarist, vocalist and songwriter.\n\nGomes’ new record Peace, Love & Loud Guitars, named Best Blues Album of 2018 by Blues Rock Review and SoundGuardian Magazine, is the culmination of a life spent honoring Blues traditions while never losing sight of his own identity. The Toronto born guitar slinger stands his ground as a creative artist and is eager to push the Blues back into the mainstream.\n\n“I believe the blues is a universal music, even though it started not too far from where you guys are in Alabama,” Gomes told the Montgomery Advertiser in a 2018 interview. \"It’s grown to be something that’s a worldwide thing.”\n\nHe has performed with the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Robert Plant, Heart, Sammy Hagar, Joe Bonamassa, .38 Special, Jonny Lang, Robert Cray and Kenny Wayne Shepherd.\n\n“(B.B. King) said the blues are like the laws of the land. They need to be amended to the times we live in,” Gomes said. “I think that’s very important. We have to sing about things that are relevant. Otherwise, the young kids won’t get it, and the blues will die and become a period piece like ragtime.”"
