        "text": "By Wayne Morton\n\n\"People are really hurting in their spirit these days, and we think God has given Russell a unique gift to reach to them.\"\n\nA singer and songwriter who grew up performing in his hometown school programs and competing in statewide singing contests was named this week as one of America's top 10 male vocalists with a No. 6 nationally charted song.\n\nFor the founder and owner of the Ardium Painting Company, recent developments are painting a clearer picture of his future.\n\nRussell Dean, also known as Russell Dean Marcengill, started his residential painting business years ago while he traveled on weekends performing music with artists like Billy Joe Royal, Ronnie McDowell, REO Speedwagon, The Swinging Medallions and others in the country and rock genres. He also traveled throughout the state, singing and ministering as an evangelist in the S.C. Baptist Association. He sang with Lavern Tripp and Michael Combs in Christian music.\n\n\"For over 30 years, I have dreamed that this day would come, and it is finally here and I am trying to get my footing as to my next steps,\" said Dean, 42. \"My calling and interest has always been in ministry and now God is doing something really awesome, and my family and I are very excited.\"\n\nIn 2009, he recorded the project \"Thunder in the Desert\" at Crossroads Music in Asheville, N.C. His song \"Hazel Green Eyes\" was the first released song and shot to No. 13 on the U.S. Christian Country Music charts and was downloaded by thousands of Internet listeners throughout the world.\n\nThe song was also made the theme of a video that has been viewed worldwide.\n\nDean's other releases off the project have also done well in the last year. Three months ago, \"Rest in My Arms\" was released and this week was charted at No. 6 in the United States and continues to gain popularity worldwide.\n\n\"I wrote that song about 15 years ago on a rainy day when I was discouraged and God reminded me that he had it all in control, and that I needed just to rest in him,\" Dean said. \"Some songs take a while and others come pretty quickly.\"\n\nWith technological advances in communication, he said, recorded songs and videos can reach millions worldwide in an instant.\n\nIn the last few years, Dean has been focusing on his music and evangelism.\n\nNext week, he will participate as a speaker and music minister in Ohio.\n\n\"Our travels have begun to expand with trips recently to Georgia, Texas, Florida, Tennessee and other states, and the blessing of it all is that God has provided the funds for each trip and has given great opportunity each time,\" he said.\n\n\"My painting business was once fairly large with several crews working simultaneously, but that has diminished while ministry opportunities increase,\" he said. \"With God's help, we will continue to pursue the calling.\"\n\nDean's wife, Diane, travels with him and speaks with many who come to the concerts and meetings.\n\n\"People are really hurting in their spirit these days, and we think God has given Russell a unique gift to reach to them and bring some peace, comfort and encouragement,\" she said.\n\nWhat's the next step for the singing house painter?\n\n\"Whatever God wants is my immediate answer,\" Dean said. \"We are going to begin work on a new project soon, and all we do is by faith that he will supply what we need to accomplish what we are called to do.\n\n\"For those in ministry, it can get difficult to get the leading of the Lord as you are struggling financially, but he always comes through and helps build your own testimony to share with someone else who may be in a similar situation.\""
