        "text": "The Ronnie McDowell annual Children’s Christmas Shopping Tour was held on Dec. 13 with 31 children from area elementary schools going to Walmart in Franklin, Ky. to do their Christmas shopping.\n\nFive buses were donated by Eric Blankenship from All Access Coach Leasing along with the drivers donating their time to take the children on the shopping tour. Ronnie Thurman organizes the buses every year for McDowell.\n\nAfter the buses picked up the children at each school, they met across the street from the Portland Public Safety Building for a police escort to Franklin.\n\nThis was the 45th year for the shopping tour. According to McDowell, when it first began, each child was given $50 to spend. This year each child could spend $300 on gifts for their families and themselves.\n\nMcDowell said on WQKRs “Good Morning, Portland” program, that he got the idea for the tour when he was touring with Conway Twitty. Bill Parks, Twitty’s bus driver, suggested doing a shopping tour for children in Hendersonville. He was a part of that, but decided he wanted to do something for the children in Portland. So he started the Portland Christmas Shopping Tour.\n\nThis year McDowell made a list of people to call to ask if they would like to be a Santa Helper by sponsoring a child. The first day he made calls for an hour and had 32 people sign up to be a helper. The next day the first person he called took the final eight children and donated a total of $4,000 to help with the tour. Others in town gave significant donations. According to McDowell, he now has a good start on next year because of the generosity of people he called. He added that no one turned him down.\n\nVolunteers joined the children on the buses to help the children shop. The five buses pulled away from Portland with a police escort all the way to the Franklin Walmart. Highland Volunteer Fire Department helped with the escort.\n\nWhen the buses arrived at Walmart, the children were taken to a special room where they were treated with cookies and juice. During that time, Jo Ann Gore talked with the chaperones about the shopping process.\n\nWhen the children finished their shopping and were all checked out, they again had a police escort back to Portland where they stopped at Portland Dairy Queen for a meal.\n\nBuses pulled into CashSaver parking lot at the end of the tour, where the children were picked up by their parents or caregivers.\n\n“We’ve been doing this for 45 years, and each year is special; but this one was made extra special watching the children buy for their siblings and moms and dads. It shows how big their hearts are.\n\n“Once a young lady walked up to me at the Strawberry Festival and told me that she was a nurse at Vanderbilt and was chosen to go on the shopping tour as a child. She said that was the best Christmas she ever had. It made all those years worthwhile, and that makes my Christmas every year,” McDowell said."
