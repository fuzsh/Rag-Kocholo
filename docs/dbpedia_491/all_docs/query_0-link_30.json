        "text": "Strawberry Manor will not reopen. Country music singer Ronnie McDowell has decided\n\nto walk away after months of working with family and friends to get it ready as an event center.\n\nLast week management differences between owner Helen Porter and McDowell became apparent and McDowell ended the project.\n\nMcDowell rented the building from Porter, but they had not signed a lease agreement.\n\nDuring a phone interview with the Portland Sun on Thursday, McDowell said, “I just\n\nwant to walk away quietly. It broke my heart but not my spirit. I am grateful that I made\n\nDaddy’s building look good again.”\n\nMcDowell’s father Howard McDowell built the building in the 1970s as a recording\n\nstudio for McDowell when his career in country music gained momentum. The property was\n\nlater sold to Porter who also owns the building that houses the 109 Family Restaurant.\n\nWhen asked by this newspaper if Strawberry Manor would open, Porter said, “To tell\n\nyou truth I don’t know. I will tell you that he rented in good faith. We talked and I guess there\n\nwere one or two things in the whole wide world we didn’t talk about.”\n\nSeveral minor situations had occurred during the renovation of the building that were\n\nresolved, but when a situation arose between Porter, McDowell, and another member of\n\nMcDowell’s staff regarding management decisions, McDowell made the decision to end the\n\nproject.\n\nBoth McDowell and Porter referred to their 40 year friendship. McDowell said, “I’ve\n\nloved them (Porter and her husband) for over 40 years. They have been good to me for over 40\n\nyears. I’ve walked away and am at peace.”"
