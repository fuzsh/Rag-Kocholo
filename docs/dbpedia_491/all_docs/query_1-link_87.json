        "text": "You have to hand it to Ronnie McDowell. He never misses an opportunity to capitalize on what’s going on in the world around him. He launched his career with “The King is Gone”, a tribute to Elvis Presley released in the wake of his death. When the Righteous Brothers’ “Unchained Melody” was suddenly popular again thanks to the film Ghost, McDowell recorded the song himself and had a moderate hit with it. When the line dance craze was peaking in 1993, he did his best to get in on the action, releasing the gotta-hear-it-to-believe-it “Yippy Ti-Yi-Yo.”\n\nNow, McDowell is back with “Hey Mr. Oilman”, his plea with the oil barons to give hard-working Americans a break and lower gas prices. It’s earnest and sincere, in the end, and at many points, unintentionally hilarious. But hey, it’s still more entertaining than most of what’s on country radio today. Listen and enjoy.\n\nWritten by Ronnie McDowell\n\nGrade: B-\n\nListen: Hey. Mr Oilman"
