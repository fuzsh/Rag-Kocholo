        "text": "Compiled by Nicholas Aczel, Kris Starring and Sean Beard\n\nBackground: Nelvana was founded in 1971 in Canada. Until 1985, the company did not have a animated logo separate from the credits at the end of their shows, instead using an in-credit version of the Polar Bear looking up at the star without the arch, and \"NELVANA\" below.\n\n1st Logo\n\n(1985-1996)\n\nNickname: \"Neon Polar Bear\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, a blue square with a red outline and a white star in the center flies from the top right of the screen, gradually enlarging and turning counterclockwise to fit the screen as the star multiplies into a seven star semicircle outline. The text \"NELVANA\" appears below the semicircle in red. The star outline shines from left to right, and the pinnacle star sends a shower of light down the center of the semicircle. \"NELVANA\" lights up in orange, and the shower of light unfolds to the left, turning into a neon blue polar bear looking up and howling.\n\nVariant: On the 1988 film, Babar The Movie, there is a special, rare variant of this logo where the polar bear stands on its hind legs for a second, before assuming its normal position.\n\nFX: The light effects.\n\nCheesy Factor: 80s light animations.\n\nMusic: A loud WHOOSH as the logo flies into place, followed by a fairy dust scale as the star outline shines, and a thunderclap as \"NELVANA\" lights up. For most of Nelvana's 90s shows, the end theme played over it.\n\nAvailability: Scarce, the short version can still be seen on \"Care Bears\" on Toon Disney and 1995-96 episodes of \"Little Bear\" on Nick Jr., the long version can be considered extinct.\n\nScare Factor: Minimal, pretty much depends on the ending theme shown.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(1996-2004)\n\nNickname: \"Space Polar Bear\"\n\nLogo: On a space background, there is a flash of light and the Nelvana logo appears in CGI on the background looking similar to the 1st logo, with some exceptions: the seven star semicircle has a blue chrome outline, as does the polar bear and the \"NELVANA\" text. A shooting star flies from the right, and as it passes the pinnacle star and the 2nd star to the left in the semicircle, each star lights up.\n\nFX: Excellent use of CGI on the starry background, blue chrome, and shooting star.\n\nMusic: The end theme of a show or the generic network theme. In 2002, some synthesized music was added. This jingle consisted of a \"WHOOSH\" followed by some reverberated synth notes.\n\nAvailability: Common, seen on many shows on Fox Kids, ABC Family, Kids' WB!, Playhouse Disney, PBS Kids and Nick Jr.\n\nScare Factor: Great CGI, nothing to worry about. May get a little higher when the music is added, however.\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(January 2002-2003)\n\nLogo: On a white background, we see the seven star semicircle, polar bear, and \"NELVANA\" text as from the previous logo but with a dark blue outline. Underneath the \"NELVANA\" is the URL http://www.nelvana.com/, and underneath that is the byline \"A CORUS Entertainment Company.\"\n\nFX: None, this is a still logo.\n\nMusic: The end theme of a show or the generic network theme.\n\nAvailability: It was used as an alternate logo during 2002-03. Some shows, like \"Braceface\" on ABC Family, will have the 2nd logo instead.\n\nScare Factor: None, I can't find anything.\n\n4th Logo\n\n(2004-)\n\nNickname: \"Nebular Polar Bear\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, we see the polar bear with a blue outline around it looking up, bumping a star to the top right of his face. The logo looks similar to the in-credit logo seen before 1985. Under the bear and star is \"NELVANA\" with the byline \"A Corus Entertainment Company\" underneath that. The star briefly twinkles, and a white haze of light forms and dissipates behind the logo.\n\nFX: Modern-day 2D computer graphics. The 1996 Space Bear was much better though.\n\nMusic: The end theme of a show or the generic network theme. It is not known if this logo has its own music at this time.\n\nAvailiability: Just beginning to surface on current Nelvana shows. It was recently spotted on \"The Backyardigans\" on CBS's Saturday morning Nick Jr. lineup.\n\nScare Factor: Low, the sudden light haze in the background looks a little freaky, but should be OK."
