I didn't know that.\n\nSeeing as how Mysticons got dumped by Nickelodeon recently, I wouldn't be surprised if that got picked up by Qubo in a few years. I also expect Sabrina: The Animated Series to air.\n\nI thought of some shows, which are not necessarily owned by Qubo's distributors, but that doesn't mean that Qubo couldn't possibly get other shows from other distributors:\n\nSagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat (this one hasn't aired on PBS in YEARS and I researched and it's now owned by a company called HG Distribution in Canada)\n\nDragon Tales (Dragon Tales' distribution is handled by Sony, I think?)\n\nHarold and the Purple Crayon (The HBO Family series that Sony owns.)\n\nThe Big Comfy Couch (Nobody's aired it in the US in years and it would be nice to see again.)\n\nFranklin\n\nLittle Bear\n\nWhile on the topic of 9Story here’s some shows they recently acquired that could come to Qubo:\n\nGoosebumps\n\nAstroblast\n\nMaya and Miguel (my local PBS station still airs it though)\n\nWordGirl (same as above)\n\nThe Babysitters Club\n\nAgain maybe...\n\nWishfart, Goosebumps, Bakugan, Beyblade, Bump in the Night, Gadget and the Gadgetinis, Frankenstein’s Cat, Julia Jekyll and Harriet Hyde, Braceface, Pelswick, Wayside, Tales from the Cryptkeeper, Jimmy Two-Shoes, Numb Chucks, Nerds and Monsters, Camp Lakebottom, Hot Wheels Battle Force 5, Mr. Young, Fraggle Rock, The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, Construction Site, and Cardcaptors. And for a revived Night Owl, Bravest Warriors, T and T, John Wayne as Young Duke, The Delta State, Clone High, Quads, The Ark, Bob and Margaret, Committed, Farscape, The Storyteller, No You Shut Up, and Home Movies.\n\nChugginton(disney is done with it) D.N. Ace garfield and friends rolie polie olie(same with chugginton) and possibly MLP G5(it won't air on discovery family) lazytown(uni kids is done with it) jimmy two shoes the zhuzhus(same as RPO and chugginton) go away unicorn(if disney loses the rights to it) the garfield show(boomerang haven't aired it in years) mysticons(nick is done with it?) Dragon tales(PBS is done with it?) Sonic X yo kai watch and doraemon(if disney XD is done with it) And wakfu wayside animaniacs along with kid vs kat and Winston Steinburger & Sir Dudley Ding Dong\n\nWishfart, Goosebumps, Bakugan, Beyblade, Bump in the Night, Gadget and the Gadgetinis, Frankenstein’s Cat, Julia Jekyll and Harriet Hyde, Braceface, Pelswick, Wayside, Tales from the Cryptkeeper, Jimmy Two-Shoes, Numb Chucks, Nerds and Monsters, Camp Lakebottom, Hot Wheels Battle Force 5, Mr. Young, Fraggle Rock, The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, Construction Site, and Cardcaptors.
