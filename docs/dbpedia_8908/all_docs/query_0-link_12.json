        "text": "MONTREAL — Canuck production company Nelvana has denied management problems after the second of three co-founders quit in just over a month.\n\nCorus Entertainment, which owns Nelvana, announced Wednesday that Nelvana co-CEO Patrick Loubert has ankled to become an independent producer, working exclusively for Nelvana for two years.\n\nIn October, senior exec VP Clive Smith — who co-founded Nelvana 30 years ago with Loubert and Michael Hirsh — left to pursue other projects.\n\nWith Loubert’s departure, the only founder at Nelvana is Hirsh, who will remain as CEO. A Nelvana spokesman insisted all was well in the upper ranks of management and the timing of departures was coincidental.\n\nNelvana is Canada’s leading animation producer and distributor, with a slate of shows that includes “Medabots” and “Braceface.”\n\nHirsh also said Scott Dyer has been appointed senior vice president in charge of production. Dyer is one of the founders of Windlight Studios, a Minneapolis-based computer toon house acquired by Nelvana in 1997.\n\nNelvana upped its delivery of episodes this year from 199 to 242, and its revenues for the fourth quarter, ended Aug. 31, were up 69% to $35 million."
