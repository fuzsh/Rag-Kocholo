Script error: No such module \"AfC topic\".\n\nThese characters appear in the Canadian animated television series Braceface, created by Melissa Clark.\n\nThe series revolves around the daily life of Sharon Spitz, a 14 year-old girl and her circle of friends navigating the maze that is teenage life, which is further complicated by Sharon's braces and their magical powers. The show takes place in Elkford.\n\nMain characters[edit]\n\nSharon Spitz[edit]\n\nSharon Esther Spitz (voiced by Alicia Silverstone in seasons 1 and 2, and Stacey DePass in season 3) is the main character. She is friendly, gregarious and good-natured, although sometimes struggles with insecurity and obsession (to the annoyance of those around her). She is also vulnerable to peer pressure, which has led to her doing things such as drinking and smoking. In the first episode of the series, \"Brace Yourself\", she gets braces, which are somehow electrically charged at all times, giving her strange abilities such as remotely operating machinery, tapping into wireless communication channels, and even discharging electricity directly into what's in front of her, though much of these abilities are often outside her control. She communicates with the audience via her thoughts. At the beginning of the series, Sharon and her friends attend Mary Pickford Middle School, and has a huge crush on one of her classmates, Alden Jones, with whom she eventually starts dating. Once they start attending Elkford High School, things get shaky between them and he breaks up with her, although they end up getting back together in the series finale \"Leap of Faith\" when Alden realizes he still has feelings for Sharon. Sharon becomes a vegetarian early in the series, and, a strong believer in animal rights, dreams of one day becoming a veterinarian; she often volunteers at her local animal hospital. Sharon used to participate in ballet lessons as a young child.\n\nMaria Wong[edit]\n\nMaria Nunziatina Wong (voiced by Marnie McPhail) is one of Sharon's best friends who is of mixed Chinese and Italian descent. She is wise, loyal and very athletic, being involved in several school sports such as hockey and basketball. In most cases, she is the voice of reason in her friend group, and always tries to talk them (mostly Sharon) out of making foolish decisions, although it was revealed in the episode \"Take That\" that she is prone to succumbing to peer pressure and going as far as shoplifting. At the beginning of the series, Maria is mostly annoyed by Alden's best friend Brock Leighton, but she warms up to him over time, and they become a couple after falling in love while on a cultural immersion trip in Rome, Italy.\n\nConnor Mackenzie[edit]\n\nConnor Mackenzie {voiced by Peter Oldring) is Sharon's other best friend. He is very smart, but somewhat timid and not as sociable as Sharon and Maria. He and also has a multitude of allergies, and is almost always seen sneezing (sometimes even wearing face masks). After a failed fling with Tally, Connor struggles with romantic loneliness, until, after her father saves his life, Alyson Malitski and he fall in love and become a couple. He is a big tech nerd, being the president of Elkford high school's AV club, as well as getting very good grades in all of his classes.\n\nNina Harper[edit]\n\nNina Harper (voiced by Katie Griffin) is Sharon's nemesis, to whom she refers as \"Braceface\". She is mean, cocky and full of herself, and always jumps at every opportunity to insult and belittle Sharon (as well as Maria and Connor on occasion). She and Sharon used to be friends as young children, but they became enemies after Nina accused Sharon of snapping the heads off of her dolls. She prides herself on her role as head cheerleader in school and her \"rising acting career\" (although she usually only gets called back for extra roles). Nina is best friends with Alyson Malitski at the start of the series, until Alyson gets fed up with Nina always taking advantage of her and pursues a relationship with Connor, also becoming friends with Sharon and Maria in the process. It is after this point that Nina is seen with a new group of friends, whom she also mistreats.\n\nAlden Jones[edit]\n\nAlden Jones (voiced by Vince Corazza) is Sharon's crush-turned-boyfriend. He is mellow and friendly, and Brock Leighton's best friend. He is the main vocalist and lead guitarist in his, Brock and Carmen's band, Mangled Metal. He and Sharon start off as friends, and eventually become a couple, although he breaks up with her in high school. He then briefly dates Marlo, and, after she breaks up with him, he realizes that he still has feelings for Sharon and gets back together with her. He is also a school athlete and particularly enjoys playing hockey.\n\nBrock Leighton[edit]\n\nBrock Shelby Leighton {voiced by Daniel DeSanto) is Alden's best friend and Maria's boyfriend. Although somewhat immature and mischievous at times, he has a mature and down-to-earth side and, for the most part, gets along well with Sharon's circle. He is the bassist and backup vocalist for Mangled Metal. He often tries his best to impress his pragmatic father. Brock initially makes several failed attempts to get with Maria, but she warms up to him over time, and the two become a couple while on a school trip to Rome, Italy. Also, like Alden, he is into school athletics, especially hockey.\n\nHelen Spitz[edit]\n\nHelen Spitz (voiced by Tamara Bernier Evans) is Sharon, Josh and Adam's divorced mother. Despite being a single mother of three with her own at-home psychology business, she is very calm, cool and collected, but will not hesitate to put her foot down if her children step out of line. She eventually meets David, and after going on several dates with him, becomes his girlfriend.\n\nAdam Spitz[edit]\n\nAdam Francis Spitz (voiced by Dan Petronijevic) is Sharon and Josh's older brother. Although he teases and picks on her sometimes, deep down, he truly cares for Sharon and has her best interests at heart. He is very athletic, not only being the captain of the wrestling team at Elkford High School, but also competing in triathlons and exercising regularly. He is in a relationship with Hannah Corbett for most of the series.\n\nJosh Spitz[edit]\n\nJoshua \"Josh\" Spitz (voiced by Michael Cera) is Sharon and Adam's younger brother. He is exceptionally mature for his age, having a wide vocabulary and being a skilled pianist at only nine years old. Like his brother, he also occasionally messes with Sharon, but truly cares about her deep down. His voice is notably deeper in season 3.\n\nRichard Spitz[edit]\n\nRichard Spitz (voiced by John Robinson) is Sharon, Josh and Adam's divorced father. A professional musician, he is the drummer in his band and away on tour much of the time, and so doesn't get to see his children very often. He and Helen have a civil relationship, and cooperate to discipline their children when they misbehave. Sharon particularly loves and looks up to him, and always enjoys spending time with him whenever she can. Richard eventually gets into a relationship with his longtime friend, Lauren.\n\nAlyson Malitski[edit]\n\nAlyson Malitski (voiced by Emily Hampshire) is Sharon and Maria's friend and Connor's girlfriend. She was initially Nina Harper's best friend, and often right alongside her in tormenting Sharon. However, over time, she grew tired of Nina's cruelty and mistreatment, and stopped being her friend after bonding with Connor (and Sharon and Maria by extension). Alyson uses the word \"totally\" a lot, and is eventually revealed to be a singer and piano player with dreams of one day being in a rock band.\n\nRecurring characters[edit]\n\nLawrence, Moishe and Roxie[edit]\n\nLawrence, Moishe and Roxie are the Spitz's pet cats.
