        "text": "Braceface is a Canadian animated series created by Melissa Clark, and aired on Teletoon in Canada from 2001 to 2004. It also aired on Fox Family (now known as Freeform) in the United States.\n\nShow Description[]\n\nGrowing up is never easy, and no one is learning that faster than 12 year-old Sharon Spitz, voiced by actress Alicia Silverstone. Sharon faces the challenges of adolescence, eighth grade, and living with a mouth full of metal! Unfortunately, she finds herself dealing with mysterious mishaps caused by her braces. Despite the mayhem that follows in her wake, Sharon always walks away from trouble smiling - with a tin grin, of course!\n\nEpisode Guide[]\n\nThe following is a list of episodes of Braceface. The show ran for three seasons and a total of 78 episodes.\n\nNOTE: When the series aired on Disney Channel, four episodes that did air on Fox/ABC Family did not air due to these aforementioned episodes having content deemed inappropriate for Disney's preteen demographic. These include \"Worst First Date Ever. Period.\", \"Miami Vices\", \"Whose Life is It, Anyway?\" and \"Grey Matters\". Disney also premiered the episodes out of order. This is the order in which they were shown on Teletoon in Canada.\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nDC Premiere Date Ep No. Name May 2, 2004 1 Brace Yourself 2 Crushed 3 5 Things That Really Bug Me About You 4 The Doctor Is In 5 The Meat of the Matter 6 The Makeover January 24, 2005 7 Mixed Messages UNAIRED 8 Worst First Date Ever.
