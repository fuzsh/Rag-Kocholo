        "text": "What's going on with Disney/Nelvana and Braceface? According to TVTome (which, I understand, is not the most realiable source on Earth) the show is has been renewed for a 5th season?\n\nABC Family never showed much past the first few seasons and Disney doesn't seem to air anything new either, is it possible that Braceface could pull a Totally Spies and move over to CN where it could get some of the respect it deserves? At least there maybe they could show some of the NONO episodes?\n\nThe show airs in Canada, and has support there (Teletoon). I do have reason to believe that the show still has juice. If Atomic Betty, the show everyone here hates and spits upon, fails, then it will still run respectively in Canada on Teletoon. But, then again, the show's gonna be there (on CN) for five years.\n\nBut about the Season Five thing... Ask a Canadian (we have quite a number here) about it. I'm not sure.\n\nI'm with Zach Williams on this one, Braceface doesn't quite fit within CN. Totally Spies went to CN, probably because it kinda fit in their programming. Braceface is, imo, too much of a soap and therefore no CN material.\n\nNo, if Braceface were to move to another network, it'd be more logical if it moved to Nickelodeon, since alot of their programs seem to be somewhat related to school and teenage problems and [list goes on forever]. But since it was already bought by Disney, that will most likely not happen... I guess.\n\nTheArtrix said:\n\nI'm with Zach Williams on this one, Braceface doesn't quite fit within CN. Totally Spies went to CN, probably because it kinda fit in their programming. Braceface is, imo, too much of a soap and therefore no CN material.\n\nThis the same CN which airs:\n\nGundam 0083 (space opera, though it probably doesn't air anymore)\n\nHamtaro (kawaii/cute furry hijinx)\n\nHome Movies (sitcom)\n\nTransformers: Armada (exposition-heavy action/adventure soap)\n\nAre a couple of posters here posturing that CN should be some kind of sterotypical boys' club?\n\nBraceface isn't great, but it's hella more tolerable than most of the CN nonsense some seem to want in even greater quantities. Sure, exclude Braceface from the club, but keep TF: Armada?!?!\n\nTerrence Briggs said:\n\nThis the same CN which airs:\n\nGundam 0083 (space opera, though it probably doesn't air anymore)\n\nHamtaro (kawaii/cute furry hijinx)\n\nHome Movies (sitcom)\n\nTransformers: Armada (exposition-heavy action/adventure soap)\n\nAre a couple of posters here posturing that CN should be some kind of sterotypical boys' club?\n\nBraceface isn't great, but it's hella more tolerable than most of the CN nonsense some seem to want in even greater quantities. Sure, exclude Braceface from the club, but keep TF: Armada?!?!\n\nNever saw Gundam, but I KNOW thats a mecha. hamtaro is a little kids show. Transformers Armada is NOt a adventure soap. Home Movies may be a sitcom, but what does that have to do with anything.\n\nExclude Braceface from the club. YEAH!!!! There has never been a show as girlish as that. Not even TS or AB are!!! Kepp TA, yeah, cause its action.\n\nTerrence Briggs said:\n\nThis the same CN which airs:\n\nGundam 0083 (space opera, though it probably doesn't air anymore)\n\nHamtaro (kawaii/cute furry hijinx)\n\nHome Movies (sitcom)\n\nTransformers: Armada (exposition-heavy action/adventure soap)\n\nAre a couple of posters here posturing that CN should be some kind of sterotypical boys' club?\n\nBraceface isn't great, but it's hella more tolerable than most of the CN nonsense some seem to want in even greater quantities. Sure, exclude Braceface from the club, but keep TF: Armada?!?!\n\nI also fail to see how Braceface would fit among all these shows. I'd say it would fit among shows like As Told By Ginger, All Grown Up and Doug. Comparing Braceface to Home Movies is like comparing Batman (somewhat serious) to Earthworm Jim (cartoony) because they're both about superheroes.\n\nTheArtrix said:\n\nI also fail to see how Braceface would fit among all these shows.

They make room for it. Home Movies fits into a lineup that didn't exist on CN five years ago.\n\nCN changes its lineup all of the time. It used to be the Hanna-Barbera rerun repository, for crying out loud. Slip Braceface after Hamtaro or something, or CREATE a programming block for soft-boiled, down-to-earth, gentle series. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nTerrence Briggs said:\n\nHow the heck does Hamtaro fit into the lineup? They make room for it.

Thats what your making it sound like.\n\nTerrence Briggs said:\n\nCN changes its lineup all of the time. It used to be the Hanna-Barbera rerun repository, for crying out loud. Slip Braceface after Hamtaro or something, or CREATE a programming block for soft-boiled, down-to-earth, gentle series. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nFirst off, hamtaro doesnt air anymore, and Hamtaro is nothing like braceface, unless you mean the parts without Hamtaro and the gang, and those are met to be part of Hamtaro's adventures. Just give it up, Braceface shouldn and NEVER will be on CN. CN would have to pick up ALOT of shows to make that block, so it wont happen."
