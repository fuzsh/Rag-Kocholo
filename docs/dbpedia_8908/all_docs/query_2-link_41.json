        "text": "Offering Invisalign in NYC — with a Touch of Soul\n\nYour smile is kind of a big deal. And when you don’t love it, that’s a big deal, too. Maybe you had braces as a kid but, like so many of us, didn’t wear your retainers consistently afterwards. Maybe you’ve had crooked or gapped teeth all your life, and it just kinda bugs you.\n\nWhatever your personal journey, know this: They don’t call us Soul Dental for nothing. We add a little soul to everything we do, and that includes helping our patients feel amazing about their beautiful smiles. Offering Invisalign in NYC for our patients is a natural fit.\n\nInvisalign to the Rescue\n\nWho knew teeth straightening could be so easy? I mean, we did, but you get what we’re trying to say. People think a straighter smile takes a zillion years, and that the whole world will notice you’ve got orthodontia. In short: not true.\n\nMyth 1 – Eons of Ortho: The truth is that Invisalign usually takes less than two years for most people to see results. And get this: in some cases, you can get the results you want in less than a year! We’re not even kidding.\n\nOf course, everyone’s individual dental circumstances are unique to them, so you will get your own personal timeline estimate once you connect with us about treatment… but that’s hopeful, right? Exciting!\n\nMyth 2 – Brace Face 4 Eva: Honestly, braces happen. Do people notice them? Sure. Do they care that you have them? Probably not. And that’s traditional metal braces! What we’re talking about here is Invisalign. “Invisible” is literally a part of the name.\n\nWith Invisalign, you wear clear aligners all day every day except for when you brush and floss, and when eating or drinking anything that’s not water.\n\nThe emphasis here is on clear. Most people won’t ever notice you’re wearing your aligners.\n\nBut Wait, There’s More: Invisalign Can Improve Oral Health\n\nMisaligned teeth are notorious for causing oral health problems, such as gingivitis. When you use Invisalign to straighten your smile and provide more even spacing between your teeth, you’re promoting oral-tissue health at the same time.\n\nThe Invisalign system also makes it much easier to keep your teeth clean during orthodontic treatment than with traditional braces. Instead of getting food caught in bands and wires, you simply remove the trays when eating.\n\nProper tooth alignment can also eliminate frustrating problems such as pain or discomfort when eating or chewing. If your bite is misaligned, fixing it can reduce or eliminate jaw pain, as well.\n\nWhat Happens at Your First Invisalign Appointment?\n\nYour first appointment is an Invisalign consultation where the dentist will talk with you about your goals and assess if you are a good candidate for this treatment. We will take pictures and digital impressions of your teeth to be used in our assessment.\n\nFrom there, if the dentist determines that Invisalign will work well for you, we’ll send our digital impressions off to the lab to formulate your first set of aligners and schedule your treatment plan.\n\nSo, it’s actually during your second appointment that you’ll take your new aligners for a test drive. We’ll make sure they fit snugly, including placing some small, temporary aligner holders on your teeth as needed. (These come right off after treatment, and don’t damage your teeth.)\n\nIn some cases, we may need to do some light sanding on your teeth to create room for the aligners. But don’t stress! It isn’t painful, and we typically use anesthetics for your ultimate comfort.\n\nOnce you’re all set with your aligners, you’ll come back in for follow-up visits to monitor your progress and get updated aligner trays as your teeth move into place. Invisalign patients need a new tray about every 1 – 2 weeks.\n\nIn conclusion, your smile matters. Your oral health matters. And doing something about it is much easier than you might have imagined.\n\nCall us today to get started and we’ll outline a plan of action to finally get you the smile of your dreams. Scheduling an appointment is easier than you think, too!"
