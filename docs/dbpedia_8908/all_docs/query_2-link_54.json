        "text": "The new entertainment studio Elf Labs has launched with trademarks for Cinderella, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, among a raft of other iconic fairytale characters.\n\nThe legal alternative to Disney aims to reimagine classic characters using next-generation rendering, AI-powered worlds and modern storylines. DreamWorks alum Mike de Seve will head up animation.\n\nElf Labs has also tapped Blue Collar Productions’ Mark Rowen, Alyse Rosenberg (Little Bear, Braceface), Bernt Ullmann and technology company Cosmic Wire.\n\n“Elf Labs’ platform is a multi-patented system designed to incubate, develop and launch mega IP franchises,” said David Phillips, CEO of Elf Labs. “Combining the world’s most iconic IP with captivating creative and revolutionary technology will allow Elf Labs to truly reimagine entertainment.”\n\nDe Seve added, “A creative production is only as good as its storyline, and the all-star roster of characters that Elf Labs secured has provided my team with an incredible jumping-off point. I am excited to partner with David and the team to bring innovative content to life across many mediums.”\n\n“Cosmic Wire’s technology allows for a whole new level of immersion into IP, unlike anything that has existed before,” said Jerad Finck, CEO and founder of Cosmic Wire. “Elf Labs’ willingness to push the boundaries creatively and experientially makes them the perfect partner for us to co-create a groundbreaking transmedia storytelling experience.”\n\nUllmann, head of licensing, noted, “I have coordinated thousands of licensing deals and have never been as excited as I am to join the Elf Labs team due to the enormous growth potential for its IP. With access to some of the most monetizable character brands in history, the possibilities are endless.”"
