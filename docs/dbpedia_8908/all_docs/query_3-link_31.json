Currently, very few LGBTQ social services or advocacy networks exist on the South and West Sides of Chicago. Furthermore, the few trans-specific resources in the city are located in majority-white neighborhoods on the North Side, which are inaccessible geographically, and also regularly result in the hyper-policing of trans people of color who attempt to access them."
