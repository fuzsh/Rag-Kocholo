        "text": "For those who don't know, KidsCo was an international children's entertainment channel founded in 2007 by Sparrowhawk Media, Corus Entertainment, and DiC Entertainment. In late 2007, NBCUniversal bought Sparrowhawk, making it their third kids TV brand(the first was the short-lived Universal Family Entertainment Network, a syndicated block with ExoSquad and Monster Force in the early 90s, and the second was their then-current investment in Qubo, which Nelvana coincidentally also had a stake in). In 2008, Cookie Jar bought DiC, and then sold off their stake in 2012. In 2013, Comcast(who had since acquired NBCUniversal) acquired the rest of its joint venture PBS Kids Sprout, and renamed it to Sprout. After this, KidsCo was gradually shut down all over the world by the end of 2014. In 2016, they acquired DreamWorks(and in it the DreamWorks Channel, which became their fourth kids TV brand), and in 2017, they revamped Sprout into Universal Kids(their fifth), but that's neither here nor there. I just took it upon myself to chronicle KidsCo's series(and good lord, there were many), including original series and shorts. Blue text indicates that the show aired on their Syfy Kids block, although several shows(such as DinoSquad) aired on normal KidsCo prior to the launch of the block.\n\nBack to the Future\n\nThe Future is Wild\n\nZ-Squad\n\nMatt Hatter Chronicles\n\nSendokai Champions\n\nDi-Gata Defenders\n\nEarthworm Jim\n\nThe Mummy\n\nDinoSquad\n\nAlienators: Evolution Continues\n\nSonic Underground\n\nGrossology\n\nTurbo Dogs\n\nFairly OddParents\n\nThe Wiggles\n\nJunior Hidden Camera\n\nMonster by Mistake\n\nFat Dog Mendoza\n\nBeyblade\n\nPelswick\n\nMadeline\n\nInspector Gadget\n\nWayside\n\nI Was a Sixth Grade Alien\n\nRolie Polie Olie\n\nRescue Heroes\n\nCyberchase\n\nBabar\n\nDennis the Menace\n\nGeorge Shrinks\n\nMax and Ruby\n\nCaillou\n\nJane and the Dragon\n\nPaddington\n\nGadget and the Gadgetinis\n\nNed’s Newt\n\nWill and Dewitt\n\nDonkey Kong Country\n\nHeathcliff\n\nSonic the Hedgehog\n\nSabrina: The Animated Series\n\nS Club 7\n\nWallace and Gromit(specials)\n\nFranklin\n\nStrawberry Shortcake\n\nCorduroy\n\nPecola\n\nMaggie and the Ferocious Beast\n\nJacob Two-Two\n\nThe Super Mario Bros.

For example, Even Stevens and 100 Deeds are not distributed internationally by Disney and Viacom, respectively, but by some company called Fireworks International. Likewise, A Walk in Your Shoes was not distributed by Viacom internationally, but rather by Sesame Workshop. That show aired on Viacom and Sesame Workshop's joint venture Noggin, and was an educational series, which I suppose would fit KidsCo's original goal of only selecting shows with \"strong educational values\". (Obviously, the inclusion of Beyblade means they abandoned that notion at one point.) Of course, there's also some interesting stuff I already knew- Nelvana, not Viacom, distributed Fairly OddParents internationally, but only the first four-and-a-half seasons. There's also a lot of shows that aired on the former Fox Family Channel(The Wiggles, Inspector Gadget, Sixth Grade Alien, Donkey Kong Country, S Club 7, Angela Anaconda, Braceface), which, as a Fox Family Fan, is nice to see. Overall, this was a very interesting experience, and I hope you agree with me on that front."
