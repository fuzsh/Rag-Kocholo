Upcoming projects include a collaboration with Disney Branded Television for the Disney+ series The Witchverse.\n\n“I have followed Ed’s work for years and am proud to welcome him to our board of directors,” Fan, the CEO of Baobab Studios, said. “Ed’s leadership and innovative genius in the world of animation is unparalleled, and his insight will be invaluable as we imagine new characters and worlds, as well as an active role for our audiences inside of them.”"
