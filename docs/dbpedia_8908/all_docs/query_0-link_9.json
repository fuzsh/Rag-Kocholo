        "text": "Background\n\nNelvana Limited (often called Nelvana Studios, Nelvana Enterprises or simply Nelvana) was founded in July 1971 in Canada by Michael Hirsh (now in the directory of Frederator Studios), Patrick Loubert, and Clive A. Smith to produce and distribute children's animated shows and movies originally. The original specials the company produced (from 1977 to 1980) were distributed by Viacom Enterprises. Until 1986, the company did not have an animated logo separate from the credits at the end of their shows, instead using an in-credit version of its logo. Today, it's a subsidiary of the Canadian media company Corus Entertainment. Nowadays, Nelvana has all licensed properties on all characters based on original products and books and it's been the longest-living animation studio based in Toronto, Ontario. The company also had an international division to distribute programs and movies internationally known as Nelvana International.\n\nNelvana's best-known productions include Rock & Rule, the Care Bears movies, the original Babar animated series, the Beetlejuice animated series, The Magic School Bus, Franklin, and Donkey Kong Country, among many others; and Nelvana remains highly regarded in the Canadian animation industry.\n\nThe company's name originally came from a Canadian comic book superheroine from the 1940s named Nelvana of the Northern Lights, but the three decided to use a polar bear instead for a logo in order to avoid confusion.\n\n1st Logo (In-credit variants) (October 15, 1978-April 2, 1988)\n\nVisuals: There is an in-credit version of the polar bear looking up at the North Star, as seen on Nelvana shows from 1985-2004, either with or without an arch. \"NELVANA\", \"NELVANA LIMITED\" or \"A NELVANA PRODUCTION\" is seen below, sometimes with copyright info below.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn The Devil and Daniel Mouse, Romie-0 and Julie-8 and Intergalactic Thanksgiving (a.k.a. Please Don’t Eat the Planet), some of Nelvana's earliest productions, the polar bear drawing is different.\n\nOn the workprint of Rock & Rule (1983), the logo is yellow rather than the blue colour of the theatrical version.\n\nOn both VHS and some early TV prints of The Care Bears Movie (1985), the background is blue, the same blue used on the custom Samuel Goldwyn Home Entertainment logo, and was likely caused by some sort of post-production mistake, as the credits background for the film's original theatrical release was black. Post-MGM prints of the film restored the credits back to their original black colour.\n\nOn original prints of The Edison Twins, the logo appears in gold underneath the The Association of Canadian Film Craftspeople and CAMERA logos with a copyright below.\n\nTechnique: A hand-drawn graphic.\n\nAudio: Either the beginning or the ending theme of the movie, probably the ending theme of the show or none.\n\nAvailability:\n\nAppears at the beginning or end of Nelvana-produced films from the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with The Devil and Daniel Mouse.\n\nIt also appears on Rock & Rule, The Care Bears Movie, The Wild Puffalumps, and Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation.\n\nIt also appears on the Star Wars: Droids cartoon, the live-action series The Edison Twins, and early 1980s prints of Nelvana's early animated TV specials (A Cosmic Christmas didn't feature the logo, nor did the Strawberry Shortcake specials or other co-productions with Those Characters from Cleveland).\n\nIt does not appear on the film Burglar, as it only uses an in-credit notice (due to the film being rated R).\n\nThis was used in tandem with the next logo until April 2, 1988.\n\n2nd Logo (October 19, 1985-June 1, 2001)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a blue square with a red outline and a white star in the centre flies from the top right of the screen, gradually enlarging and turning anticlockwise to fit the screen as the star multiplies into a seven star semicircle outline. The text \"NELVANA\" appears below the semicircle. The star outline shines from left to right, and the pinnacle star sends a shower of light (which starts off in neon yellow, but turns neon blue) down the centre of the semicircle. The company name lights up in orange, and the shower of light unfolds to the left, turning into a neon blue polar bear looking up.\n\nVariants:\n\nThis logo exists as both filmed and videotaped versions.\n\nThe short variant starts off with the stars shining and the \"shower of light\" animation. This plays in warp speed on Eek! the Cat before the compressed or split-screen credits. This is slowed down on some episodes of Babar, The Adventures of Tintin and Beetlejuice. This version is more common.\n\nAn alternate version exists, which appears on some theatrical releases of the era, at least The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland and Babar: The Movie. After the logo forms, the polar bear stands on its hind legs for a second before assuming its normal position, then all seven stars disappear. Depending on the film, the background will either be black (as seen on The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland), or the usual blue (as seen on Babar: The Movie).\n\nThe 1988 TV special Clifford the Big Red Dog has a variant with the logo rotating on screen from its' center position. Some episodes of Care Bears have this shortened.\n\nSometimes, this logo also shares the screen with other logos.\n\nThe restored HD prints of The Adventures of Tintin seen on the series' foreign Blu-ray release feature a variant of the \"slowed-down\" short version; here, the image has been shrunk down to the center of the screen (presumably a side effect of not having the logo's original negatives or tape to restore from and the series' conversion to widescreen).\n\nOn a promo for The Adventures of Tintin, the logo is shown on the right, alongside with the Ellipse Programme logo on the left. In this one, the polar bear and stars are white and the “NELVANA” text is also green.\n\nTechnique: A mix of traditional cel animation and CG.\n\nAudio: An ascending whoosh and a dramatic synth theme, followed by a thunderclap and a humming noise sounding similar to a lightsaber from Star Wars as \"NELVANA\" lights up.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nFor most of Nelvana's 1990s shows such as Rupert, either the end theme plays over it, the logo is silent, or (rarely) the standard theme plays.\n\nThe gradient background variant uses a mystical twinkling sound with a thunderclap. Some specials and shows distributed outside of North America used this variant, although the original broadcasts of My Pet Monster has this version's music playing over the standard logo.\n\nOn The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland, some whooshing sounds with wind chimes and a dreamy synth theme plays.\n\nOn Madballs, one of the characters says \"Rock 'n roll!!\" over the logo.\n\nAvailability: This logo is easy to find, and is used in tandem with the next logo until June 1, 2001.\n\nThe short variant still appears on 1995-2001 episodes of Little Bear and early episodes of Franklin on Nick Jr., Eek! Stravaganza (whenever reran, usually on foreign Disney networks), Fievel's American Tails on Peacock, VHS and Netflix releases of The Magic School Bus (1994 series), and on VHS and DVD releases of the Nelvana version of Care Bears.\n\nThis logo also appears on all episodes of Beetlejuice (including the Shout! Factory boxset) and the Donkey Kong Country pilot episode \"I Spy With My Hairy Eye\".\n\nNetflix's prints of The Adventures of Tintin also retain this logo, as well as the 2006 DVD releases of said show; depending on the region, the Blu-ray release will either feature the normal \"slowed-down\" variant, or the shrunken-down version.\n\nWhen Fox Kids reran The Magic School Bus from 1998 to 2002, this logo was omitted.\n\nThe short variant was also preserved on some episodes of Babar when Qubo reran the series up to its shutdown.\n\nLike the previous logo, this did not appear on the films Burglar or Malice (the company's only two R-rated films to date). While the former was given an in-credit notice, Nelvana was uncredited for the latter film.\n\nMost shows had this logo until 1997 (after being used in tandem with the 3rd logo below) when they then switched to the next logo. However, even though the logo retired in 1996, Little Bear continued to use the logo until its end in 2001, albeit Franklin used that on some prints of seasons 1-2.\n\n3rd Logo (December 2, 1995-July 30, 2005)\n\nVisuals: On a space background, there is a flash of light as the company logo appears in CGI on the background looking similar to the 1st logo, with some exceptions: the seven star semicircle has a blue chrome outline, as does the polar bear and the \"NELVANA\" text. A multicolored comet flies from the right, and as it passes the pinnacle star and the second star to the left in the semicircle, each star lights up.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Cardcaptors: The Movie, and some Rolie Polie Olie and Franklin games for PC, an extended version of the logo exists, in which there's a more delayed zoom-out, ending with the logo animating backwards, but without the comet animation.\n\nAn even shorter version of the logo starting from when the comet flies from the right also exists. Sometimes, this is played in slow/delayed motion.\n\nSome episodes of Donkey Kong Country have a still shot of this logo.\n\nStarting in 2002, the byline \"Nelvana is a COrUs Entertainment Company\" was added (with \"COrUs\" written in its corporate font), and the logo animation was shifted up from the zoom-out.\n\nOn shows that Nelvana distributed internationally, the chyroned words \"Distributed By\" and \"INTERNATIONAL\" (on one episode of The Fairly OddParents, the word reads \"International\") appear above and below the logo, respectively.\n\nBeginning in 2002, the logo is zoomed out a bit further (with a black background added behind, as shown by the flash only appearing in the middle) in order to fit in the \"Nelvana is a COrUs Entertainment Company\" byline on the bottom.\n\nStarting in 1997, the URL \"www.nelvana.com\" was sometimes added either below or above the logo.\n\nA theatrical variant exists where a five-pointed star flashes in the distance on a much cleaner-looking starfield and the Nelvana logo (which looks more metallic and the stars around the arch are never as visible), which is turned on its side, flies toward the screen and flips upright. A variant on the 2nd logo's polar bear animation (with it standing on its hind legs briefly) plays while it flips toward the camera. The logo sparkles a bit in the end.\n\nAn in-credit version also exists, which has appeared on Tales From the Crypt on the last episode (and the only animated one), \"The Third Pig\". It also appears on the 1997 Pippi Longstocking series with the AB Svensk Filmindustri, TaurusFilm, and TFC Trickompany Filmproduktion GmbH logos.\n\nOn the Japanese dub of Donkey Kong Country, the bylineless version appears in-credit and animated in the custom ending theme.\n\nOn Kids' WB! broadcasts of Cardcaptors and seasons 2-3 of Rescue Heroes, the logo is played in split-screen due to the block's own split-screen credits (the former has the pre-2002 variant, while the latter has the 2002 Corus byline variant).\n\nOn the second season of Bob and Margaret, the URL is blurred out for unknown reasons.\n\nOn current Amazon Prime Video prints of the Ace Ventura animated series (digitally remastered in High Definition), the logo is cropped to 16:9 widescreen, fitting the width of the aspect ratio (presumably an Artificial Intelligence video upscaling effect of the logo's original videotape negatives to restore from and the series' conversion to widescreen).\n\nOn later episodes of Robin, the logo is inside a box with a white outline and paired with the SF Animation and TMO Film logos.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: The end theme of a show/movie, the generic network theme, or none.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nStarting in 2002, a composition by Glenn Barna at Animated Audio is heard: a loud whoosh sound plays, followed by a haunting eight-note chime theme, then a second loud whoosh. This was mainly used on the extended variant of the logo.\n\nSometimes, only the first whoosh was used, or the last whoosh would be cut out, the latter of which was used on the standard long version on a 2004 Nicktoons airing of Pelswick.\n\nOn the trailer for Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot, there is what sounds like a shooting star passing by in time with the comet flying. The version used here is the one that starts with the comet flying by.\n\nAvailability: This logo, like the previous logo, is easy to find. This was used in tandem with the next three logos until July 30, 2005.\n\nFirst seen on The NeverEnding Story: The Animated Adventures of Bastian Balthazar Bux.\n\nThis logo is often seen on Nelvana's Retro Rerun YouTube channel.\n\nIt appears on season 2 of Cyberchase, Franklin, Rolie Polie Olie, and the first two seasons of Max and Ruby among others.\n\nIt also appears on the English dub of the anime Cardcaptor Sakura (known initially as Cardcaptors in those regions) as well as All New Tales from the Cryptkeeper.\n\nIt was also seen on Braceface, last seen on Disney Channel and Freeform in North America.\n\nBeyblade G-Revolution also kept this logo until its end in 2005.\n\nOn Tubi, the Braceface episode \"Up in Smoke\" retains the Corus Entertainment byline.\n\nThis was also seen when Nickelodeon aired My Dad the Rock Star for a brief time in 2005, but Nicktoons airings and current prints have the 6th logo instead.\n\nThis is also retained on current prints of the Ace Ventura animated series, including Morgan Creek's official uploads and when Tubi streamed the series.\n\nThis is also retained after the credits on PBS Distribution's DVD release of The Berenstain Bears: Adventures in Bear Country. However, it's unknown if the 6th logo plastered this logo on later releases by PBS.\n\nThis is also retained after the credits on Walt Disney Home Entertainment's DVD releases of Rolie Polie Olie.\n\nThe theatrical variant only appears on two movies; 1997's Pippi Longstocking and 1999's Babar, King of the Elephants.\n\nThe \"INTERNATIONAL\" variant appears on most international prints of seasons 1-4 of The Fairly OddParents and also on international prints of Taina.\n\nThe aforementioned variant with the byline appears on The Fairly OddParents episode \"Abra-Catastrophe! (Parts 1-3)\".\n\n4th Logo (2001-February 3, 2006)\n\nVisuals: Over a white background is the seven star semicircle, polar bear and \"NELVANA\" text as from the previous logo, but with a dark blue outline. Underneath the \"NELVANA\" text is the URL \"www.nelvana.com\" and underneath the URL, the byline reads \"A CORUS™ Entertainment Company\".\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, the byline would instead be stylized as \"A CORUS™ Entertainment Company\" (in non-italics).\n\nSometimes, this logo also shares the screen with other logos.\n\nTechnique: A computerized graphic.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAudio Variant: In other cases, the ending theme of a show or the generic network theme.\n\nAvailability: This was used as an alternate logo in tandem with the previous one between 2001 and 2006.\n\nOn first-run shows, this appears on season 1 of Cyberchase and later episodes of Maggie and the Ferocious Beast (Nick Jr. reruns also kept the logo intact; however, on later prints, such as DVD prints and airings on Qubo, this logo was plastered with the 6th logo).\n\nIt also appears on some international prints of The Fairly OddParents.\n\nOne example is the episode \"Boy Toy\"/\"Inspection Detection\" from the UK DVD release of \"Boys in the Band\" (the other episodes use the \"INTERNATIONAL\" variant of the previous logo).\n\nIt was also seen on a 2002 Canadian airing of Cyberchase on CBC as part of their Get Set for Life block.\n\nThe version with the normal font byline appears on the Game Boy Advance games Beyblade V-Force: Ultimate Blader Jam and Franklin the Turtle, respectively.\n\n5th Logo (July 20, 2004-February 11, 2013)\n\nVisuals: On a starry background in which the stars move about, the polar bear from the next one is seen with the words \"NELVANA\" also in the same font as the next one. A shooting star comes from near-lower left side of the screen and it goes by the polar bear, leaving a shiny star, which reveals itself to be the one in the next logo. During all this, the byline \"A CORUS™ ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY\" is seen below. The logo resembles the 3rd logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nAn extended version that animates just like the 3rd logo's extended version exists, but cheaper looking and with the text moving into place.\n\nA still in-credit version with the bear and star shifted slightly to the left also exists.\n\nTechnique: 2D computer animation.\n\nAudio: Same as the 2002 version of the 3rd logo.\n\nAudio Variant: In some cases, the ending theme plays over instead.\n\nAvailability: This is obviously a placeholder logo for the next logo.\n\nThis logo appears on a small number of Funimation Entertainment-distributed Nelvana releases, and so far, this logo appears on the 2005 DVD release of Braceface: Turning 13 in terms of plastering the 3rd logo.\n\nIt also appears as a de-facto home video logo on the 2004 compilation DVD release of Nelvana's Friendship Collection: Making New Friends, and the 2004 VHS and DVD releases of Beyblade G-Revolution: Beginning of the End, respectively.\n\nThe in-credit version appears on seasons 4-5 of Max & Ruby.\n\n6th Logo (September 7, 2004-September 24, 2018)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, the text \"NELVANA\" (set in Gill Sans Extra Bold) is seen with a byline underneath it. A white polar bear then flies onto the screen from the middle left and then stops onto the text. It bumps a star onto the screen, which twinkles, and a nebula forms and dissipates behind the logo. Otherwise, the nebula is absent.\n\nTrivia: The logo is similar to the pre-1986 in-credit logo, except with only one star.\n\nBylines:\n\nOriginal Variant, September 7, 2004-April 14, 2015: Because of parent company Corus Entertainment Inc.'s \"growth\" in its company (hence the \"Inc.\" for incorporated), the byline reads \"A Corus™ Entertainment Inc. Company\" (exactly like that).\n\nOctober 18, 2005-September 24, 2018: The byline reads \"A CORUS™ ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY\", all in capital letters, and in the same font used in the 2001 logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nA more common variant begins with the polar bear already on the text and bumping the star.\n\nOn Handy Manny, the word \"A NELVANA PRODUCTION\" are above the polar bear and no nebula is shown.\n\nStarting with season 2, the nebula is shown and the 2005 byline is seen. This version also exists in both standard 4:3 or widescreen 16:9.\n\nOn Grossology, the polar bear gets dunked in slime, which causes the polar bear and \"NELVANA\" text to become distorted, the byline to become obscured by the slime, the star to spin around before dripping slime and no nebula is shown.\n\nThe original U.S. airings of Grossology on Discovery Family use the 2004 normal version in the still form.\n\nAn international version exists: \"INTERNATIONAL\", in a rounded rectangle, is squeezed in between the company name and the byline (now in blue).\n\nAt the end of Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure, the variant is superimposed over the credits for Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure.\n\nOn current prints of the first episode of Committed, a still variant without the star is seen which also exists.\n\nSome reruns of Corduroy have the logo starting after the star is bumped.\n\nA superimposed variant — with the in-credit text \"Distributed by Nelvana Enterprises Inc.\" above it and without the nebula — also exists on season 3 of Max & Ruby, sharing the screen with the Treehouse logo.\n\nOn My Friend Rabbit, the logo \"stalls\" a bit, where the polar bear doesn't bump the star exactly when first seen; after that, the animation is seen as usual and the 2005 byline is seen.\n\nStarting with season 5 of Cyberchase, the logo starts when the polar bear walks forward right after jumping onto the logo with the 2004 byline. The nebula is also absent.\n\nOn the Game Boy Advance game Beyblade G-Revolution, the bear is placed to the left of the logo, and there's an \"INTERNATIONAL\" plate below. Another game, Bakugan: Rise of the Resistance, shows the logo outlined in white.\n\nSometimes, the logo is bylineless.\n\nOn Qubo airings of early episodes of Class of the Titans, after the polar bear bumps the star, the 2005 version of the logo freeze-frames. Also appears on the series finale thereof.\n\nA variant exists in which the word \"DIGITAL\" is added below the text with the 2004 byline (now in blue, and with a registered trademark symbol instead of a regular trademark symbol) appearing below it.\n\nOccasionally, the 2005 byline is in grey.\n\nOn Life with Boys, the nebula-less logo has smoother animation.\n\nAn in-credit version exists, which appears on some shows.\n\nSometimes, this logo also shares the screen with other logos.\n\nOn season 1 of Horrid Henry, \"IN ASSOCIATION WITH\" is above the logo.\n\nOn some Nickelodeon/Nicktoons Network airings of Wayside, the logo is shifted upwards.\n\nOn Wishfart, the text \"Produced in Association with\" is seen on the upper left side of the logo, and when the polar bear bumps the star, a rainbow comes out of and zooms across the screen (the effect of a wish being granted in the show), transitioning to the Bejuba Entertainment logo; the nebula is absent.\n\nOn Guess with Jess, the logo is also in-credit and the 2005 byline has a slightly different interface.\n\nStarting with later season 1 episodes of the show, the byline is moved a bit more downwards.\n\nOn Lucky Duck, there is a bubble transition to the nebula-less logo.\n\nAt the end of a trailer for Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot, there is a short version which starts when the nebula disappears.\n\nOn the trailer of the failed series Formula RC (which can be found on Pipeline Studios' Vimeo account), the polar bear is wearing a cybernetic glasses and the nebula is absent. After it bumps the star, it settles down when the star turns red, yellow and green. The \"N\"s are acting like car tires, then the polar bear drives away as the star spins. This variant also has a blue 2005 byline, similar to the International and Digital variants.\n\nOn Discovery Kids airings of Latin American prints of later season 3 episodes, some of season 4 and remastered airings of season 1 of The Backyardigans, the 2005 version of the common variant with the haze is seen (but the Nickelodeon Productions \"Lightbulb\"/2009 logos plastered it, making this freeze-frame at the end). It also appears on Discovery+ prints of the aforementioned episodes.\n\nOn Pandalian, the Teletoon logo makes a one frame appearance at the beginning of the Nelvana logo for some unknown reason, despite the fact that this series actually aired on YTV in Canada.\n\nOn Qubo airings of some episodes of Sidekick, the logo is giving an iris-out effect. Other airings (and Qubo airings of other episodes) of said show use a fade-out effect for this logo.\n\nTechnique: Computer animation.\n\nAudio: An ascending synth noise, followed by a two piano notes (the second note is higher) and a three-note guitar theme, with one piano note (accompanied by a twinkling sound) and a child laughing towards the end. The theme was composed by Mike Northcott and Neil Parfitt.\n\nAudio Trivia: The music was completed on June 1, 2004.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOtherwise, the end theme of the show/movie plays over.\n\nIn the U.S., original network airings used a generic theme.\n\nShows plastering the 1985 logo may use the dramatic synth theme or the mystical twinkling theme instead of the normal music. This appears on newer prints of T and T and My Pet Monster.\n\nA shortened version of the jingle also exists.\n\nFor the Grossology variant, the first two notes of the guitar theme is heard but it gets interrupted by the sound of slime splashing and dripping.\n\nIn some cases, such as on some Canadian YouTube prints of Rolie Polie Olie (which feature a blank title screen and blank closing credits), the logo is silent.\n\nFor the Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot trailer variant, there is the audio variant of the 3rd logo.\n\nSometimes, the child's laughter is omitted.\n\nOn The Adventures of Chuck and Friends, the music is sped up without the laughter.\n\nOn The Stanley Dynamic and Bubble Guppies, the last part of the music plays without the laughter. On the latter show's episode \"The Arctic Life!\", there is this music along with the ending of the song \"This is the Arctic Life\".\n\nOn Spliced, it's the stock sound \"Sound Ideas, BIRD, ROOSTER - MORNING CALL, ANIMAL 01\", often with more sounds (a duck quacking, a person sneezing, etc.) in every episode of the show.\n\nOn the trailer of Formula RC, the driving sounds are heard, along with three dings for the star.\n\nOn the 2006 Canadian Max & Ruby DVD release of \"Max's Chocolate Chicken\" (released by Treehouse and Kaboom! Entertainment), the theme is slightly different with a different, more cheerful-sounding laugh at the end (similar to the laugh of Caillou).\n\nOn a Sidekick teaser promo, male voices say \"Sidekick!\".\n\nOn some episodes of Mike the Knight and the sizzle reels of some Nelvana shows (such as the aforementioned Mike the Knight, Babar and the Adventures of Badou and Little Charmers) on the company's website, the child's laughter is omitted as the music consists of a sombre, \"evaporating\" deep synth note instead, set in the same chord as the normal fanfare.\n\nAvailability: This logo is mainly used to plaster older Nelvana logos. This logo was used in tandem with both the previous three logos, and the next logo, until February 11, 2013 and September 24, 2018, respectively.\n\nIt debuted on Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends, and last appeared on the sixth season finale of Max & Ruby.\n\nNelvana shows from the time, such as The Backyardigans, Grossology when last seen on Hub Network (now Discovery Family), Babar and the Adventures of Badou on Disney Junior and Discovery Kids Latin America, Handy Manny on Disney+ and Disney Junior (formerly Playhouse Disney), Wayside, Spliced, My Friend Rabbit, Sidekick, Scaredy Squirrel, and many others feature this logo.\n\nThe in-credit variant appears on some shows.\n\nIt was also used as a de-facto home video logo.\n\nThe bylineless logo appears on Class of the Titans (with the exception of Qubo airings of early episodes) and both the second and third seasons of Being Ian (with the exception of the series finale \"An Ian-convenient Truth!\"), as well as on the Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends special \"The Prince, the Princess and the Bee\" and Mr. Young (despite it having an in-credit disclaimer).\n\nThe “IN ASSOCIATION WITH” variant appears on some early season 1 episodes of Horrid Henry internationally (CITV airings used an in-credit version instead). It also appears on Nicktoons prints of those episodes.\n\nThe superimposed variant appears on season 3 of Max and Ruby, since the company was never involved as much producing the series along with seasons 4-5, but by the sixth season, the regular version of this logo is used instead, considering that the company increased their involvement in actual production following Silver Lining Entertainment and Chorion closing their doors in 2012, with Atomic Cartoons co-producing in addition.\n\nThis is more commonly used to plaster older Nelvana logos, mainly on DVD or digital streaming.\n\nIt also appears on post-2005 prints of Nelvana material, such as Babar on Qubo, Bob and Margaret on Showtime Women, the KaBoom Entertainment DVD release of My Pet Monster, the Entertainment One DVD releases of Babar, DVD releases of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, the now-discontinued Funimation DVD release of WildC.A.T.S., and the Shout! Factory DVD releases of The Adventures of Tintin and Maggie and the Ferocious Beast.\n\nIt also plasters the 2nd logo on The Magic School Bus: The Complete Series DVD box set, released in 2012; all the episodes in the box set have the logo plastered, except for \"Ups and Downs\", which retains the 2nd logo.\n\nIt also appears at the end of recent prints of A Cosmic Christmas, after the filmed version of the 1976 Viacom \"V of Doom\" logo.\n\nIt also appears on 2014-issued printed episodes of the 1986 Care Bears series on YouTube.\n\nUploads of Nelvana shows on the \"YTV Direct\" (which originally began as \"Nelvana Retro\") and \"Treehouse Direct\" YouTube channels tend to have this logo plastered over the previous ones, sometimes with odd results (the first episode of T and T has the short version ending before the music of the 1985 logo does; all other episodes have the long version to sync with the music).\n\nIt also appears on many DVD releases of Nelvana shows in international territories, such as The Fairly OddParents (one example is the \"Superhero Spectacle\" DVD) and the beginning of the Lionsgate Home Entertainment DVD release of Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends: Bug-A-Boo Day Play and Canadian prints of some The Backyardigans DVD releases.\n\nWhen Nicktoons Network aired My Dad the Rock Star from late 2005 to early 2008, this plastered the 3rd logo, as does Tubi and DVD releases of the show.\n\nAfter the new and current logo debuted, this logo was used in tandem with it on the first season of Ranger Rob, season 6 of Max & Ruby and The ZhuZhus (formerly known as Polly and the Zhu Zhu Pets). It also appeared in lower-third credits of Corn & Peg and Ollie's Pack on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons in place of the next logo.\n\nThe \"DIGITAL\" variant only appears on the series adaptation of Pinkie Cooper and the Jet Set Pets.\n\nThe standard variant also appears on Canadian DVD releases of properties that Nelvana acquired Canadian DVD rights to, such as The Octonauts, In the Night Garden..., The WotWots, My Big Big Friend, The Garfield Show, and Toopy and Binoo, among others.\n\n7th Logo (June 25, 2017-)\n\nVisuals: Over a blue background is the stylized polar bear in blue with a white outline and the new \"nelvana\" text in a modified Nordique Pro font, in white being drawn out. The star is at the bottom of the bear, jumps up and spins, then lands. The polar bear bumps it, causing the colours to reverse. Then, the text at the bottom middle of the polar bear changes from white to blue. A tiny, registered trademark symbol appears next to the company's name right at the bottom.\n\nTrivia: This logo was first introduced on July 12, 2016, according to the Corus Annual Report 2016 book.\n\nVariants:\n\nShorter and still versions exist, with or without the Corus byline.\n\nAn in-credit version also exists.\n\nOn the Canadian French dub of season 7 episodes of Max & Ruby (and possibly others), a French version has the byline translated in \"Une compagnie de Corus\".\n\nOn season 2 of The Hardy Boys, the logo is smaller and has the text \"IN ASSOCIATION WITH\" above.\n\nOn The Most Magnificent Thing and Geek Girl, the logo is white and on a black background.\n\nTechnique: 2D computer animation.\n\nAudio: A 13-note synth tune, the opening/ending theme, or none.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn the welcome intro of Nelvana's official YouTube channel (Nelvana Digital Network), the tune is altered, which has 11 notes.\n\nOn Bravest Warriors, the tune is in sync with the Corus logo.\n\nAvailability: This was used in tandem with the previous logo until September 24, 2018.\n\nDebuted on the company website and later officially on Hotel Transylvania: The Series.\n\nIt later appears on all further programming and movies by the company (such as Bravest Warriors, Mysticons, Go Away Unicorn!, Corn & Peg, Agent Binky: Pets of the Universe, The Dog & Pony Show, Ollie's Pack, Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go, the final season of Max & Ruby, seasons 2 and 3 of Ranger Rob and the 2019 short film The Most Magnificent Thing, among others).\n\nThe complete logo debuted on Zhu's News - Pumped Up Zhus (on YTV's official YouTube channel).\n\nThis logo also appears (as a de-facto home video logo) on DVD releases starting with the 2018 DVD release of The ZhuZhus: Season One.\n\nFinal Note\n\nAs of 2024, Nelvana remains the only Corus Entertainment subsidiary with an active logo (the 2017-present logo), as the other sister companies' logos have been replaced by Corus' logo."
