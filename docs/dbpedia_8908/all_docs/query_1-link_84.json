        "text": "With her soulful eyes, seductive pout and generally gorgeous looks, it's hard to imagine Alicia Silverstone (below) relating to anyone less than, well, perfect. But she readily admits to an affinity for geeks, even to feeling like one herself.\n\n''I love to celebrate geekiness,'' Ms. Silverstone, 24, said, sounding a little more effervescent than the typical It girl. ''I think they're the coolest, sexiest people in the world.''\n\nSo, when Fox Family Channel and the production company Nelvana approached her about being executive producer and star voice of ''Braceface,'' a new animated series about an eighth grader with teenage problems on her mind and a set of magical braces in her mouth, Ms. Silverstone's reaction was immediate.\n\n''I took one look at this adorable, geeky girl and screamed, 'I want to be her!' '' Ms. Silverstone said. ''There were just so many aspects of her that I could relate to.''\n\nMake no mistake: the blond, bubbly Sharon Spitz, who stumbles onto television screens with Ms. Silverstone's voice this Saturday at 9 a.m, is no charity case. She wears cool clothes, has cool friends and is asked to the dance by the coolest boy in school. And when her nemesis, Nina Harper, meddles in her life, Sharon keeps a cool enough head to untangle herself from life's little catastrophes.\n\n''It's kind of like 'Clueless' meets 'My So-Called Life,' but for younger kids,'' Ms. Silverstone said of the show that recalls so many of the issues she found important at the same age. ''I remember when I was 12 and I came home from school and I'd had the worst day of my life. You would turn the TV on and there were 'The Jetsons' or 'The Smurfs.' But there wasn't really a show dealing with what was going on at my age or in my mind.''\n\n''Braceface'' is a gift, she said, to parents and children who may need - and want - to talk about their problems, but may not know to begin. ''If you don't communicate honestly and if you don't find a way to talk, you're going to run up against a wall,'' Ms. Silverstone said. '' 'Braceface' is for that period in your life when everything is very important and very serious, though you might not be treated that way.''\n\nKathryn Shattuck"
