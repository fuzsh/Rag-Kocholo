        "text": "Background\n\nJade Animation was a Chinese animation company and a member of TVB. Jade Animation had been not only making overseas work with Warner Bros. Animation, Walt Disney Television Animation and Walt Disney Animation Japan Co. Ltd., the studio made co-productions for Nelvana such as Braceface, George Shrinks and the 1999 series Redwall (season 3 only).\n\n1st logo (September 30, 2000-2002)\n\nVisuals: On a white background, there is the TVB logo, which is two ovals inside a square. Next to it are the words “JADE ANIMATION” in black, along with it’s Chinese lettering and below a byline saying \"A Member of the TVB Group\".\n\nTechnique: A still digital graphic.\n\nAudio: The end theme of the show.\n\nAvailability: Seen on season 1 episodes of George Shrinks, which was last seen on PBS Kids in the United States and on Treehouse in Canada. Also seen on some later episodes of Braceface and early episodes of the 3rd and final season of the 1999 series Redwall.\n\n2nd logo (2001-2003)\n\nVisuals: On a wispy, moving purple background, there is the same TVB logo above. A magical dust brings forth the silver metal objects, revealing the Chinese lettering and the words \"JADE ANIMATION\" in the same font from before. A byline saying \"A Member of the TVB Group\" appears below.\n\nVariant:\n\nA longer version exists, it starts with the TVB logo flying in before a a comet fly and magical dust appear. The rest of the logo preceeds normally.\n\nOn current upcoming HD remastered prints of Braceface, the logo is cropped to 16:9 widescreen, fitting the width of the aspect ratio.\n\nOn later episodes of the 3rd and final season of the 1999 series Redwall, the logo cuts to the still version of the TV-Loonland AG logo.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: Same as the previous logo.\n\nAudio Variant: A longer version exists with catchy synth music with some whooshes and a thud."
