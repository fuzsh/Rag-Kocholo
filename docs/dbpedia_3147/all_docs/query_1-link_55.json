        "text": "Looks like some sort of Cyberdyne Systems human feeder used by Skynet.\n\nIt’s actually an early concept proof of the Chime Generator for the 10,000 Year Clock. It can generate unique chime sequences every day for 10,000 years, and there are over 3.5 million possibilities. Brian Eno even used the same algorithm for his album “January 07003 â Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now.”\n\nThe brainchild of Computer Scientist, Danny Hillis, The Clock of the Long Now is designed to operate with minimum human intervention (winding, easy maintenance), and is constructed of largely valueless materials to limit looting by future civilizations.\n\nThe first prototype began working on December 31st 1999âin time to chime twice for the new millenniumâand is now on display in London. The two more recent prototypes are in San Francisco.\n\nPics below:\n\n– First working prototype of Orreyâor planetary displayâfor the 10,000 year clock\n\n– Prototype of a Solar Synchronizer to maintain the clock’s accuracy using the sun."
