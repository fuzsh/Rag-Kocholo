Seven songs--including the swirling St. Elmo's Fire and the kinetic, African-influenced King's Lead Hat--come from Another Green World and Before and After Science, with only two from the concept album Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy and one, the incandescent On Some Faraway Beach, from his solo debut Here Come the Warm Jets. While all four of Eno's '70s art-pop albums are essential listening, Desert Island Selection is a thoughtful condensation that's both an excellent introduction to Eno's pop work and a wonderfully listenable album itself\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.co.uk (uk)\n\namazon.com (us)\n\ncduniverse.com (us)\n\namazon.co.jp (japan)\n\nDiscreet Music\n\nBrian Eno\n\nUK cd album (1987)\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\nLabel: Eg\n\nCatalogue Number: EEGCD23\n\nTrack listing:\n\nDiscreet music 1 and 2\n\nFullness of wind (Part 1)\n\nFrench catalogues (Part 2)\n\nBrutal adour (Part 3)\n\nPersonnel:\n\nBrian Eno (tape loop)\n\nGavin Bryars; The Cockpit Ensemble\n\nRecorded at Brian Eno's studio, London, England on September 5, 1975 and Trident Studios, London, England on December 9, 1975\n\nIncludes liner notes by Brian Eno\n\nDiscreet Music is Brian Eno's first break with pop music in favor of a quieter, more meditative form, and it came about by accident. When Eno was confined to bed after an auto accident, a visitor brought him an album of classical music, which he mistakenly put on the stereo at a very low volume. Unable to get up to raise the volume, Eno heard the quiet music blend with the natural sounds of his environment, and conceived a music designed for that purpose. The several lengthy pieces on Discreet Music are named after quotes from the liner notes of a recording of Pachebel's Canon in D, which also provides the structure of the pieces themselves. Built on subtle tape loops, the pieces retain just enough of those structures to avoid the deliberate formlessness of Eno's later ambient experiments. The very beginnings of ambient music are on this disc\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.co.uk (uk)\n\namazon.com (us)\n\ncduniverse.com (us)\n\namazon.co.jp (japan)\n\nDrawn From Life\n\nBrian Eno / Peter Schwalm\n\nUK cd album (2001)\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\nLabel: Venture\n\nCatalogue Number: CDVE954\n\nTrack listing:\n\nFrom This Moment\n\nPersis\n\nLike Pictures Part #1\n\nLike Pictures Part #2\n\nNight Traffic\n\nRising Dust\n\nIntenser\n\nMore Dust\n\nBloom\n\nTwo Voices\n\nBloom (Instrumental)\n\nreview:\n\nAmbient pioneer Brian Eno has devoted much of his time to producing and making art than to his own music in recent years. Drawn From Life, his first album since 1997's The Drop is a collaboration with German percussionist and hip-hop DJ J. Peter Schwalm. The resultant sound is distinguished not by any move into the territory of urban beats but diverse, syncopated but determinedly downtempo, spatial rhythms. The 11 tracks all fall into the category of moody soundscapes--film scores for arthouse projects, but they're far from unapproachable--Like Pictures Part 2 recalls My Life in the Bush of Ghosts with minimal spoken word from Laurie Anderson over a sighing handclap rhythm, tinkling vibes and eastern strings, Rising Dust twinkles to a warm fuzz of electronica and vocodored piano. Meditative and absorbing, Drawn From Life is a counterpoint to silence.\n\n--Mike Pattenden\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.co.uk (uk)\n\namazon.com (us)\n\ncduniverse.com (us)\n\namazon.co.jp (japan)\n\nDrawn From Life\n\nBrian Eno\n\nEuropean cd promo album (2001)\n\n11-track promo picture CD, stunning gatefold card picture sleeve CDVEDJX954\n\nitem available:\n\neil.com (uk)\n\nDrawn From Life\n\nBrian Eno\n\nUK cd-r promo album (2001)\n\n11-track promo CD-R acetate including From This Moment, Persis, Like Pictures Part 1 & 2, Night Traffic & Rising Dust, custom printed disc & title sleeve CDVE954\n\nitem available:\n\neil.com (uk)\n\nDrawn From Life\n\nBrian Eno\n\nUS cd-r promo album (2001)\n\n11-track advance promo CD-R acetate, custom printed disc and title insert\n\nitem available:\n\neil.com (uk)\n\nDrawn From Life\n\nBrian Eno\n\n>UK double lp (2001)\n\n10-track double-LP including Like Pictures Parts 1&2, numbered picture sleeve LPVE954\n\nitem available:\n\neil.com (uk)\n\nThe Drop\n\nBrian Eno\n\nUK cd album (2003)\n\nOriginally released: 1997\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\nLabel: All Saints\n\nCatalogue Number: ASCD032\n\nTrack listing:\n\nSlip dip\n\nBut if\n\nBelgium drop\n\nCornered\n\nBlock drop\n\nOut/out\n\nSwanky\n\nCoasters\n\nBlissed\n\nMC Organ\n\nBoomcubist\n\nHazard\n\nRayonism\n\nDutch blur\n\nBack clack\n\nDear world\n\nIced world\n\nReviews:\n\nRolling Stone (9/4/97, p.70) - 3 Stars (out of 5) - \"...Angular melodies, bent guitar notes, piano drizzles and manipulated effects make up THE DROP's mixed bag of 17 minicompositions...\"\n\nEntertainment Weekly (7/25/97, p.73) - \"...Like most of his ambient forays, this one takes time to shape....But once he locks into confident bass tones, the fluttering notes at the high end seem to find their compliment...\" - Rating: B\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.co.uk (uk)\n\namazon.com (us)\n\ncduniverse.com (us)\n\namazon.co.jp (japan)\n\nDune: Original Soundtrack Recording\n\nBrian Eno / Toto / Marty Paich\n\nUS cd album (1996)\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\nLabel: Touchwood Records\n\nIncluding: Eno's Prophecy Theme\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.com (us)\n\nEno And Cale: Words For Dying\n\nJohn Cale / Brian Eno\n\nUS video (1993)\n\nFormat: Color, NTSC\n\nLabel: Mystic Fire\n\nvideo available:\n\namazon.com (us)\n\nEno Box I: Instrumentals\n\nBrian Eno\n\nUS cd boxset (1994)\n\nNumber of Discs: 3\n\nLabel: Emi Int'l\n\nFrom: Another Green World to Neroli [Edit] and all that lies in between\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.com (us)\n\nThe Essential Fripp & Eno\n\nRobert Fripp / Brian Eno\n\nUK cd album (1994)\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\nLabel: Venture\n\nCatalogue Number: CDVE920\n\nTrack listing:\n\nHeavenly music corporation\n\nSwastika girls\n\nWind on water\n\nEvening star\n\nHealthy colours (pts I-IV)\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.co.uk (uk)\n\namazon.co.jp (japan)\n\nWind on water\n\nEvening star\n\nEvensong\n\nWind on wind\n\nIndex of metals\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.co.uk (uk)\n\namazon.co.jp (japan)\n\nFractal Zoom\n\nBrian Eno\n\nGerman cd single (1992)\n\n4-track CD including Zaire Mix, Naive Mix 1 and, picture sleeve\n\nitem available:\n\neil.com (uk)\n\nHeadcandy with Music by Brian Eno\n\nBrian Eno\n\nUK cd-rom (2001)\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.com (us)\n\nHere Come the Warm Jets\n\nBrian Eno\n\nUK cd album (1993)\n\nOriginally released: 1973\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\nLabel: EG\n\nCatalogue Number: EGCD11\n\nTrack listing:\n\nWind on water\n\nEvening star\n\nEvensong\n\nWind on wind\n\nIndex of metals\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.co.uk (uk)\n\namazon.com (us)\n\ncduniverse.com (us)\n\namazon.co.jp (japan)\n\nHeroes Symphony\n\nPhilip Glass / David Bowie / Brian Eno\n\nUS cd album (1993)\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\nLabel: Polygram Records\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.com (us)\n\namazon.co.jp (japan)\n\nI Dormienti\n\nBrian Eno / Mimmo Paladino\n\nItalian cd/book (2001)\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\nBook Type: Hardcover\n\nPublisher: Alberico Cetti Serbelloni Editore\n\nDescription:\n\nIn Autumn 1998, the exhibition I Dormienti, at the Roundhouse in London, provided the first opportunity for the two artists to work together. This book unites drawings and photographs from the exhibition, with a dialogue between the artists, and a CD of the music Eno composed especially for the show. The result is a graphic project of such high quality that it more closely resembles a work of art than an art book. Characteristic is the attention to detail in every aspect: the meticulous, five-color \"pentachrome\" printing-process, the 250 gram card stock, the silk screen printed cloth cover, the protective sleeve and precious presentation box. With a limited edition of 2000 issues, being more exclusive than a promotional disc.\n\n12 1/4 x 12 1/4 ins. 108 pages printed using a special five-color \"pentachrome\" process\n\nCloth bound with protective sleeve and presentation box\n\nExclusive music CD by Brian Eno\n\nBilingual edition Italian / English\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.com (us)\n\nJanuary 07003 | Bell Studies for The Clock of The Long Now\n\nBrian Eno\n\nUK cd album (2003)\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\nLabel: Opal Music\n\nTrack listing:\n\nFixed ratio harmonic bells\n\nChanges where bell number = repeat number\n\n2 harmonic studies\n\nDeep glass bells (with harmonic clouds)\n\nDark cracked bells with bass\n\nGerman-style ringing\n\nEmphasizing enharmonic partials\n\nChanges for January 07003, soft bells, Hillis algorithm\n\nLithuanian bell study\n\nLarge bell change improvisation\n\nReverse harmonics bells\n\nBell Improvisation\n\nVirtual dream bells, thick glass\n\nTsar Kolokol lll (and friends)\n\n1st - 14th January 07003, hard bells, Hillis algorithm\n\nReviews:\n\nCD Baby\n\n\"this album changes the flow of personal time...

Here, he has taken his themes for the Low Symphony from the music of David Bowie and Brian Eno, specifically from their album entitled Low. You needn't be familiar with (or like) the work of Bowie or Eno to appreciate this piece, which is in three movements: Subterrraneans, Some Are, and Warszawa. Glass doesn't quote the borrowed themes directly, but lets them generate their own variations- -which he's very good at. This is an unexpected success and a grand delight.\n\n--Paul Cook\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.com (us)\n\nLuciano Pavarotti & Friends Together for The Children Of Bosnia\n\nLuciano Pavarotti / Various Artists\n\nUS cd album (1996)\n\nNumber of Discs: 1\n\nLabel: Polygram Records\n\nEno : contribution:\n\nMiss Sarajevo\n\nComposed by Brian Eno\n\nPerformed by Turin Philharmonic Orchestra with Luciano Pavarotti\n\nConducted by Michael Kamen\n\ncd available:\n\namazon.com (us)\n\namazon.co.jp (japan)\n\nBrian Eno (CDs continued)\n\nBrian Eno (CDs previous)\n\nBrian Eno (Biography) New Sylvian & Related Ordering Pages\n\nCDs\n\nDavid Sylvian | Rain Tree Crow | Japan\n\nMick Karn | Dalis Car | Steve Jansen\n\nPorcupine Tree | Virginia Astley | Jon Hassell\n\nMark Isham | Brian Eno | Laraaji | King Crimson\n\nHarold Budd\n\ndavid sylvian cds"
