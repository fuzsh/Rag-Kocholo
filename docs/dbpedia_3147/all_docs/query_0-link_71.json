        "text": "“What is your secret for turning ninety?” This is the question I was asked by several medical folks as I was recently given lab tests at my local clinic. “Secret?” I wondered, finding it difficult to reply, joking with them, “I just keep breathing.”\n\nOn further consideration, I might have had a few “suggestions” from my personal experience like the ones I am willing to share with you.\n\nFirst of all, luck may play the biggest part in my longevity: I was lucky to have won both the birth lottery and the parent /gene lottery. My birth was a surprise, perhaps, a gift to my parents‘ middle years. In truth, it was not a good year for them to have a fifth child—1933 was the height of the Great Depression, the year Hitler and FDR came to power, the year prohibition ended, and for my parents the beginning of the \"cocktail hour\" at home. By the time I was seven all three of my big brothers had signed up for oversees duty and later managed to come home without being wounded.\n\nThat was my beginning in privileged surroundings, born to very able parents in a great place to grow up, middle class, in a suburb of Boston. In the years that followed, I moved around this country a lot, in good times and not so good times. Of course I had ideas and hopes for what might happen along the way. However, to make a plan for one’s life is only to make God laugh. We have little say over what happens next, and we are under the control of parents or guardians until our teenage years, thrust into adult hood after that.\n\nI once saw a bumper sticker that read: “Eat right. Keep fit. Die Anyway.” A bit cynical, but true enough. No matter how we try for a long healthy life, stuff happens. We follow our dreams while being pushed around by the fickle finger of fate. However, I like to think, even as the elderwoman I am now, I still have some choices which may help me survive consciously on this precarious planet.\n\nThose of you who know something about me will guess what I am going to say next. The not so well-kept secret is covered in one word: community. Yes, family is great, lucky you if you have a caring family nearby. I am not so fortunate. Any community, perhaps based on a chosen faith may work for you. Ideally, it will be inter- generational, inclusive, providing opportunities for commitment, even sacrifice and purpose.\n\nYes, one that calls on you to share your talents, time, and treasures also. My faith and the people in it who continue to enrich my life, have given me a life worth living. They give continuing sunshine to my sunset years. Being part of a community and active in other interest groups like the Cobb Institute help to encourage service to others, so necessary to keep us active and aging consciously.\n\nI take an example from one of my gurus, Ram Dass. He can tell us what it means to have serious challenges after a debilitating stroke. He counsels us to become aware of the depth dimension in our lives, the deepening realization that things are not only what they appear to be, they are so much more. Also, he counsels, and I agree, to enlarge our circles, become more expansive about whom we serve, and how we can serve people in a way that helps both them and ourselves.\n\nOne more thing that has helped me to have a good time during my allotted days is optimism. Yes, I usually resonate with happy endings, as long as they are not too sappy or Hollywood-contrived. You can be assured that along with my life of privilege, I have had my share of suffering and even tragedy.\n\nMy favorite scene from all the films I have seen is the one where Zorba the Greek and the Boss witness the collapse of the structure they built to ship lumber to the waiting boat. Their dreams are dashed. What else can they do but hold hands and dance on the beach! (Greek music helps.) Yes, I am a cockeyed optimist but with eyes wide open to the inevitability of unhappy endings. So here you have my insights of how I have lived to this age of 90, with luck and love and faith in this universe. And that is no secret.\n\nIn pondering my future on New Year’s Day 2021, I thought I knew what was ahead of me personally and professionally. Eight years into a successful pastorate, growing a congregation despite the challenges of Covid, I anticipated remaining as senior pastor of an historic Cape Cod congregation until age seventy-five and spending the rest of my life on Cape Cod, beachcombing, hiking, and writing, aging as creatively as possible.\n\nBut, all things change, as the philosopher Heraclitus asserted, and two months later, our son, whose family had moved to the Cape for their children to have the advantage of grandparents nearby, broke news that turned my world upside down: after seven years on Cape Cod, he and his wife decided to move back to the Washington DC area so he could be more hands-on in running his international consulting firm.\n\nI was gobsmacked, to say the least. Suddenly the future was wide open, and my plans for the years ahead were in doubt. I am a process theologian, who has lived with process theology since I was a junior in college, now over fifty years ago. I know that each moment is perpetually perishing and life is change. I know that the pure conservative, holding onto the past, goes against the forward movement of the universe. I know that God is the catalyst of novelty as well as the source of healthy stability. Nevertheless, my wife and I had a vision of long-term personal growth on Cape Cod. We had plans, and now the novelties of life forced us to make a decision. Would we stay on the Cape, where life is simple, and sea breezes blow, or would we pick up stakes and head back to the Washington DC area? Would we enjoy growing old together just the two of us, only occasionally seeing our grands faraway in Washington CD, or would we let go of our professional lives, sell our commodious home and lovely gardens, and move to a more complicated suburban life in the Potomac, Maryland, near our family?\n\nRegardless of our decision to go or stay, my wife and I were facing big changes. As everyday grandparents, we couldn’t imagine being separated from our grands, who studied at our home every day when the schools moved from in-person to zoom for classes. We also didn’t want to leave our professional lives and the beauty of Cape Cod. We had the privilege of two good options, but a decision had to be made.\n\nMy wife and I believe that each moment is pregnant with possibility. We have not only studied process theology, we have sought to live out process theology in our daily lives and decision making. We affirm that God is present as a lure within this particular, and every, moment of decision and that there is promise and possibility in each choice we make. We also realize that gain and loss is present in each choice we would make. We believe that within the “impasse” of every moment we are presented with divine possibilities to embody God’s vision of beauty and love. This juncture of our lives would be no exception. While this didn’t make the choice easier, God’s intimate presence as the source of possibility in our lives gave us confidence that whatever choice we made would open the doors to new possibilities and that going or staying, a holy adventure awaited us.\n\nAfter many conversations and much prayer and reflection, we chose to relocate to the DC area. For me, at age 68, this meant, “retiring” from full-time ministry and leaving behind my beloved morning walks on the beach near our home. Fortunately, finances were not a problem. We could maintain our current lifestyle, despite high cost of housing in the DC area, through a combination of social security, retirement plans, and investments.\n\nThe real issues I faced involved meaning, relevance, and self-identity. While my identity was not tied up with my professional life, what worried me was whether or not I would find meaningful activities in our new locale. Would I embrace God’s holy adventure or would I find myself on the sidelines, irrelevant, and overlooked by my peers and younger generations in my field?\n\nWe grieved our move. But the framework of process theology inspired us to see the changes we faced as the womb of new and unexpected possibilities. We knew that new situations bring new possibilities from which to choose, and when we open to the array of possibilities emerging in a new context, even more possibilities enter our lives. Our calling is to be agents of possibility. After contemplating our situation prayerfully, we can choose to be agents of the future, running toward rather than away from novelty.\n\nIn my case, coming back to the Washington DC area invited me to reach out to friends and professional companions. I also came back with over forty years of experience as a pastor, professor, administrator, and writer, from which to draw upon as I evaluated possibilities. We returned to our old congregation after nearly twenty years away. While not wanting to take too much responsibility, it was clear that there was a need for classes in adult faith formation. The pastor invited me to teach a class on the prophets, and that began a two-year journey of Thursday morning seminars on Zoom, which may stretch out for years to come.\n\nAnother adventure awaited me, grounded in the interplay of my gifts and the congregation’s needs. When the pastor at the time chose to resign, the church was initially unable to find an interim minister. Anxiety about the future was pervasive in the congregation. After a few weeks of prayerful reflection, I made it known to the congregation’s moderator that I was willing to be the congregation’s “bridge pastor,” a post which I held for three months, providing pastoral leadership in preaching, worship, pastoral care, and administration, and renewing the congregation’s sense of vitality and hope. I did not seek the position but felt the divine call to share my gifts for the well-being of the congregation. I believed that God was at work, challenging me to play a role in the securing the congregation’s future. When an interim minister was finally called, I comfortably returned to my role as an informal “theologian in residence,” happily worshipping and continuing my role as an adult faith formation teacher.\n\nOne of my scriptural mantras comes from Lamentations 3:22-23:\n\nThe steadfast love of God never ceases,\n\nGod’s mercies never come to an end;\n\nthey are new every morning;\n\ngreat is your faithfulness.\n\nThis scripture captures the spirit of process theology: the faithful presence of God, the inclusive love of God, the lively creativity of God, and our role as God’s companions in bringing love and beauty to the world.\n\nThere are many adventures ahead for us in the DC area. I still miss my daily beach walks, but I have discovered that my neighborhood affords a lovely environment for walking. We miss our large yard, and room for our ninety-pound golden doodle to run around, but we have found a lovely “dog park” in the neighborhood and the townhouse community’s commons is an inviting place for a romp.\n\nThe next adventures involve our grandchildren embracing their teenage years and changes in the level of our care. Moreover, in the years ahead, even though we are healthy, the aging process will bring changes in activity and energy levels. We don’t know what the future will bring, but as we face that future, our trust is that the concrete changes of life will be the womb of new possibilities and that God will be our companion in every change of life, the fellow sufferer who understands, the joyful companion who celebrates, and the imaginative challenger who lures us toward the future.\n\nIt was disorienting. My routine fell apart, and I wasn’t sure what I should be doing. Grief is like that, and sometimes we go to do something out of habit, only to realize that everything has changed. It can feel like little stabs of acute grief throughout the day.\n\nI took on this little dog from The Real Bark dog rescue. His name was Kip, and he had a serious health condition. The dog rescue needed a “forever” foster home that could handle a dog with special needs. Kip took multiple daily medications four times a day, he had many veterinary appointments, and he required reassurance and routine. It's difficult to find someone willing to take on a dying dog. Kip's prognosis gave him about 6 months to a year of life.\n\nI am a hospice chaplain and felt I could do this. Kip settled in and made it clear that he was stubborn about certain things. Kip didn't like to walk on a leash, he would rather go in his stroller. He didn't like cold weather, so he had sweaters and blankets. He liked certain treats and not others, but his food had to be closely monitored due to his liver failure. He was indifferent toward most people, but he loved going out. Kip’s favorite thing to do was to go for car rides. That made him so happy, so I took him everywhere. I always had Kip along for the ride when I attended meetings or ran errands or met with friends for lunch. Kip regularly came to a grief group I led and to visit seniors at an assisted living facility, always in his stroller. Kip showed them that you can still live your best life even if you have a terminal diagnosis and need a wheelchair. It’s all about quality over quantity.\n\nKip lived longer than expected and he was very attached to me, and I grew very attached to him. I felt I could understand his facial expressions and what he was trying to say whenever he looked at me in a certain way. I could tell when he started to decline and wasn’t feeling well. His liver had enlarged so much it began to push on other organs, and he was uncomfortable. Eventually it pushed on his diaphragm and made it difficult to breathe. I knew what that meant. We took that final car ride to the Veterinarian.\n\nThe grief was overwhelming, and I felt disoriented. My little dog Kip had died. I always knew he would die, because I took him as a foster knowing that he had an enlarged liver. When I got him, my life changed and revolved around his medication schedule. I had to plan vacations that included him because of his medication schedule. I adjusted my life around his needs, and I didn’t mind. His routine became my routine. Kip didn’t like it if I stayed up a bit later to watch a movie. He wanted to go to bed at his bedtime, and if I didn’t come, he would come out of the bedroom to give me an indignant look and turn around and go back to bed. But then he would get up again and give me attitude every twenty minutes until I went to bed. Kip didn’t like change. But we know that life is in constant movement, and Kip’s body was changing. His liver kept growing. When he died, my heart broke. Kip changed my life, but when he died my life changed again. Change is like that; it can disrupt your life in good ways and bad. I have learned that what death asks of us is surrender. We fight it but there is nothing to be done but to surrender to change. Now I can reflect on how Kip was a teacher, and he taught others about a living life full of experience and savoring every moment.\n\nToday I was talking with my eight-year-old grandson, who asked me if he could print something you wouldn’t normally print on our copy machine. “Don’t ask me what!” Anyway, I used this as an opportunity to talk to him about how things have changed during my lifetime. I’m only seventy years old, and I know that John Cobb and Matthew Fox are even older and could tell you even more stories than I, but here is just an example of change in my life.\n\nSo, there I was, my grandson; all ears to hear what I would have to say. And what I said was, “When I was young, they didn’t even have copy machines.” If we wanted to copy writing, we needed carbon paper—and I remember teachers trying to speed things up with mimeograph machines. And that is just one area of change. How many other areas could people “our” age come up with? How about the price of gasoline = 25 cents per gallon, candy bars = 5 cents. Our first two story home, which was brand new, was just $24,000.00, my first car was just $300.00, and rent was just $250.00.\n\nOh, and on the other hand televisions had just come out—they were black and white, they had only a few stations, and were on only for certain hours per day. Telephones had what were called “party lines” where you had to share your phone line with another, or others, as a group. There were no calculators, or computers or cell phones, etc. etc. That has all come since we have been alive. We also saw the atomic and hydrogen bombs go off.\n\nWhen I think of change in the context of process thought, the process community tends to refer to change as process, whereas in the Creation Spirituality community we speak of evolutionary cosmology. In both cases, however, I think we are both saying that ultimate reality is not made up of things, but of processes and inter-connecting relationships. And if you have children or grandchildren, you can simply quote Heraclitus, an ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher from the city of Ephesus. Little is known of Heraclitus's life, though he was known as the “weeping philosopher.” He wrote a single work, only fragments of which have survived. He is famous for saying: “You cannot step into the same river twice.”\n\nIn 1997, I began my studies at Matthew Fox’s University of Creation Spirituality, in downtown Oakland. When I opened up the door, there was a long staircase going up to the office, library, and classrooms. However, upon climbing the stairs, one was already beginning his or her learning experience in terms of the “New Cosmology.” The reason for this is that there was a mural that ran from the bottom of the stairs to the top. On the wall it began at the bottom with the “Big Bang,” and went all the way through creation until, in the last fraction of an inch, one would see the minuscule amount of time that humans have lived on this planet. And more than this, every student that passed through those doors at the bottom of the stairs would be required to take the “New Cosmology” as one of their core classes in the Doctor of Ministry Studies in Creation Spirituality.\n\nAnd cosmology is where it all begins for Creation Spirituality—it begins with the Bible’s first creation story as it is recorded in the first chapter of Genesis, in which the refrain rings throughout this litany of creation, “It was good,” and then, at the end of the first six days it says, “It was very good.” From this we see that God created the world with “Original Blessing.”[i][ii]\n\nAs I said earlier, doctoral students in the program were required to take the class titled, “The New Cosmology.” In this class we used as our text a book by cosmologist Brian Swimme and “geologian” Thomas Berry titled, The Universe Story: From the Primordial Flaring Forth to the Ecozoic Era.[iii] This book begins with the “Big Bang,” then goes on through the formation of Galaxies, Supernovas, the Sun, the Earth, eukaryotes, plants and animals, human emergence, neolithic village, classical civilizations, the rise of nations and the “Ecozoic era where existence itself is derived from and sustained by this intimacy of each being with every other being of the universe.\n\nBecause of our common concern for the environment, which exists as a delicate interconnected web, and our understanding of a panentheistic God who is not removed from creation, but is within creation, and creation is within God (See: Acts 17:28).\n\nOne final thing on change, and that is the “Big One” for a Christian, because that is what “repentance” is all about. For scripture says that unless we repent and are baptized, we will not be saved. Now in most cases people think of repentance as being really sorry for your sins, and so much so that they want to change their course by one hundred and eighty degrees. This is because most ministers say that repentance means to change one’s course.\n\nWorse yet is when one confuses repentance with penance, which is something very different. What penance is, is when one goes to confession in a Catholic Church, and confesses one’s sins, the priest absolves one of their sins, though they still must pay for their penalty by doing penance—doing some kind of punishment for their sins. Repentance or metanoia instead means to change one’s mind, or way of thinking.\n\nAnother issue with repentance is that the whole idea that if unless we repent and are baptized we will not be saved is so self-focused. In the Creation Spirituality community, we see that even more important than our own personal salvation is, at this point in world’s history, to think of social and ecological salvation for our planet!\n\nI think that there are many people in both of our respective communities who see a lot of room for people to even change their way of thinking in terms of the new things we know today. It’s time for a new vision of the earth and the cosmos which we are a part of, and of all reality, which is interconnected. When people see God as panentheistic, to not care about creation is to not care about God, for to not to see all things in God and God in all things, is to ignore what is right in front of you.\n\nI turned 70 last year, and the Lord be willing, I will turn 71 this year. As I have said, I have seen many changes in my lifetime, but I too have changed a number of times as well.\n\nYou changed your name recently to Cypress. What is the significance of choosing that specific name over other options?\n\nOne thing I should say here is that I am gay, and that has informed how I carry myself as a queer person in Kansas. Coming out in a Pentecostal context was unpleasant, to say the least, so exploring my sexuality and discovering what that could look like for me was limited and risky. Being gay has taught me that coming out is never a one-time event. You come out again and again in different places with different people. I first came out as bisexual, it felt safer to say. Over time, I came out as gay which felt far more authentic. As you note, recently I changed my name to Cypress. This is because I came out again, this time about my gender identity rather than my sexuality: I am non-binary.\n\nYou might be wondering, what does that mean? Being non-binary just means that I do not ascribe, endorse, or participate in a gender binary that reduces me to only either “man” or “woman.” Gender identity simply refers to the way that I describe myself on the gender spectrum. Gender identity, then, is different but related to gender expression, which is the way that folks present themselves. For example, I am non-binary and I use they/them pronouns, that is my gender identity. Currently, I express myself in traditionally masculine ways which makes me look male. In fact, most people don’t pick up that I am non-binary, but that is largely because I dress and present myself as a cisgender male.\n\nChoosing this name represents the progress I’ve made in deciding to no longer put off the self-creativity and gender exploration I was denied in my youth. At times, rethinking my fashion feels like high school all over again; so many new and awkward things to experience for the first time. If only I had recognized earlier that we can simply try on names until we figure it out. Even though the name you pick may not be final, and Cypress wasn’t my first chosen name as I went by my initials for so long, it can feel so final and scary putting out something like that for others to know you as. The pressure to get it right can be immense at first.\n\nWhen I was looking, after deciding I’d put it off long enough and the initials weren’t cutting it, I looked for names online. I couldn’t find any names that I liked, so I narrowed my search. I knew that I wanted a name that was not culturally appropriative or disrespectful, and yet I wanted something that was based on nature. Names like River, Lavender, and Snow were all unique and lovely names, yet they weren’t just right. Then, I found the cypress tree, which is found on every single continent and shows up looking different ways in different places; which seemed fitting, I thought. The versatility of the name Cypress also helped, as I could go by Cy or Cypress. The name was based off of something found in nature, which was important to me, and it was unique enough that I knew I wouldn’t likely run into another with the same name.\n\nIn celebration of the dawning of the Year of the Dragon, Ai Weiwei has released Zodiac, A Graphic Memoir (2024), composed of scenes from his career, his childhood and his family life. Each chapter frames the artist’s take on traditional beliefs about the characteristics humans share with the 12 animals of the Chinese lunar calendar. Gianluca Costantini’s intricate line drawings pair with Elettra Stamboulis’s comic-bubble text to help expand Ai’s lifelong campaign for free expression to a new medium for a new generation. His memoir shares real events, such as hanging out with Allen Ginsberg in 1980s Greenwich Village, and imagined events, such as debating Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.\n\nThis new memoir recalls his massive work featuring 12 bronze animal heads that represent the traditional Chinese zodiac and have been touring internationally since 2011. That work is based on the original 12 animals created for the fountain-clock of the Yuanming Yuan, Beijing’s summer palace. Only seven of the original heads have been found and returned to China with the rest still lost to looters in the 1860 Opium War. Weiwei’s sculptures represent transformations by way of exile, migration, and intentional change of geographical location. The artist himself has been forced into exile in his childhood. In 2011, as a result of his critique of the Chinese government, Ai was arrested, detained for 81 days, and had his passport confiscated until July 2015. During this period, each head was hooded in solidarity with the artist’s protest of China’s treatment of human rights. Now living in exile, Ai Weiwei remains as controversial as ever in his commitment to freedom. Last month his exhibition protesting the war in Gaza was removed in both its German and American venues.\n\nThe book, however, is as gentle and loving as it is forceful. In Zodiac, Ai Weiwei teaches his son, Ai Lao, the legend of the Jade Emperor creating the calendar. He uses this story to explain the nature of time to his child, much as his imprisoned poet father did for him, and in his telling the two children often overlap in the pictures. As Ai Weiwei puts it:\n\nSome say time is only an illusion. The illusion can be painful, or it can be happy. Some live in the past, and some struggle in the present. Someone may have no future. It’s hard to explain what time is about. The new generation needs some kind of reference when we talk about time. I can talk about the years I lived in Xinjiang, or the time my father was dying so I moved back to China from New York. You really need events to illustrate time. My son will turn 15 soon, so his time will be in China, then Germany, then England. That’s how he’ll understand it.\n\nIn his tender evocation of the recurring elements of his life with that of his father and son, Ai Weiwei has brought into being once again, the wisdom of the I Ching:\n\nto see the universe is an open system, self-generative and self-transformative\n\nto accept that because changes take place all the time, we need to study their patterns and learn to navigate their complexity, and\n\nto recognize that we must be ready to make courageous decisions to find harmony and meaning in life.\n\nEach of these four books has used art and graphic symbols to address the process of time and change. And interestingly, each has found this approach to involve a spirit of collaboration. Perhaps that is because the process of change involves so many strands of interrelated phenomena that it is best is perceived as a process of harmonies. And a process of harmonies requires different voices. I believe that Whitehead would concur.\n\nCerridwen’s rage was destructive. As a hen, she would intend to kill Gwion, the grain of wheat now in her belly. But the boy was in the process of transformation within Cerridwen’s womb. In the spiral of time and after the fullness of the light of nine full moons, she would give birth. She knew this child to be Gwion and waited for her time to finally kill him. But, once he was reborn, he was a babe, so fair beyond any, and she fell in love with this child of light. She had not the heart to kill him outright. Anger can be tempered and calmed with love, and the heart can soften. So, when Ceridwen saw her child, her anger subsided. Gwion has been transformed and reborn. To gain knowledge or understanding, it is necessary to \"die\" or at least give up your previous form, as Gwion did. He changed into various animals and finally into a new person all together, the same ingredients just rearranged in the cauldron of the womb. New mother Ceridwen tied the child in a magical leather bag containing a bag of herbs she had collected over nine months and threw him into the river. He was swept up by the waters and into the sea. He sailed away in his little bag, away from the land, and the current rocked and danced him in the light of the moon and the dark. The moon knows our hearts and reflects love back to us. The babe was in this love light as he sailed the sea, a small package with such a large potential.\n\nThe tightly wrapped bag went wherever the river went and was adrift for a long time, but he was calm and never cried. He never fought his way out of the bag. He aged not a single day during his journey under the changing moon. He had the Awen with him.\n\nIn a nearby fishing village lived a king. This king had a temper as we find so often in powerful rulers. King Gwyddno had a son, Prince Elphin, with whom he had placed high hopes that often ended in disappointment. The king was overly critical to the point that Elphin quite gave up on trying to be a wise prince Elphin had always been an overly cheerful young man, yet it covered a hidden pain. He was like the prodigal son from the parable except he hadn't left home. He managed to overspend at the taverns, making merry with the fisherman. Elphin felt his father's disappointment and it pained him in his heart. He was so afraid to displease him that he gave up all hope to win his father’s approval. Pain and fear ruled his heart, though he hid it well. He preferred the company of the fishermen. These fishermen worked hard but they got paid by the day from the royal treasury no matter the haul. No one became rich from fishing in the kingdom of Gwyddno. Elphin was quite jolly but rarely successful at fishing or anything else for that matter. The village being so near the waters of rivers, sea, and pond that it counted on the salmon haul from the nets. They had many festivals surrounding fishing. Beltane, or May Day as is also known, was the most celebrated festival for it was the height of spring and warm at the shore. The haul from the nets of May could make a man quite wealthy. King Gwyddno was in the habit every May eve of giving a prize the value of twenty trained horses or twenty of Britain's finest hunting dogs. This year he chose Elphin in hopes that his son would for once do well. Elphin wasted no time. He waded into the shallow sea where he hauled the wide nets ashore, pulling them out too early. His impatient temperament made him a bad fisherman. Each time he pulled the nets he found no salmon at all. He felt worthless and pained.\n\nElphin was feeling very low. On the last day, he noticed something on the pole at the weir, not a fish but a leathern bag. Each day Elphin felt unlucky but now he felt that he was a fisher of trash. He pulled at the leathern bag and opened it to have his eyes flooded with bright light. Elphin exclaimed, “Behold a radiant brow!\" Taliesin emerged from the bag singing a great epic poem, the Awen shinning bright from his brow.\n\nTogether Elphin and the babe Bard Taliesin returned to Gwyddno's castle hall. The prince asked to see his father, excited to show him the bright child he had caught. He was feeling such love from Awen that he forgot the pain over his fathers’ constant disappointment that he had been hiding.\n\nUpon entering the hall, Gwyddno asked Elphin if he had caught plenty of fish. The babe Taliesin was wrapped in fishing rags. He was not a salmon although he looked deceivingly so.\n\nElphin seemed so happy that Gwyddno had gained false hope. Elphin told him that he had gotten a much better catch and held up the child and exclaimed, \"I caught a Poet!\" as the rags fell away.\n\nGwyddno erupted in anger thinking that not only did his son catch no fish but now thinking he lost his mind. He shouted to leave his sight. It was then that the babe Taliesin spoke, as the Bards relate:"
