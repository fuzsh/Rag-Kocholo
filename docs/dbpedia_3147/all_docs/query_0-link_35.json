        "text": "Brian Erno began his career in Roxy Music, then became a flapjackingly good solo pop/rock songwriter with a particular interest in and talent for drenching wonderful British catchy-tunes in golden showers of disorienting electronic noise. Going by both his given name \"Brian Eno\" and the meaningless nonsense term \"ENO\" (short for \"Electric Night Orchestra\"), Brian was poised to take the world of radio by rainstorm when he unfortunately invented \"ambient music,\" lost all interest in songwriting, and began selling discs of wispy pink air. No Pussyfooting (with Robert Fripp) - EG 1973\n\nOh, I think I left my scrotum whole\n\nUp there on the totem pole\n\nHippity-hoppity\n\nBalls are on their way\n\nHello everybody, I'm Tom Jones and welcome to The Tom Jones Celebrity Warehouse! Tonight on the show we've got Sarah Purcell of TV's Real People, Steve Lawrence of TV's Foul-Ups, Bleeps & Blunders and a chicken that plays Connect Four! But fi\n\nThis album has two songs by Roxy Music's Brian Eno and King Crimson's Robert Fripp. The first is a haunting 21-minute pile of moody drones that Fripp ruins by soloing over it. The second is 18 1/2 minutes of squiggly celestial UFO noises going up and down combined with interplayriffic guitar harmonics and clean motifs, marred only by Fripp soloing over the last half. Apparently these songs were created by playing guitars and synths into a delay pedal and then adding more and more on top as the original motifs get quieter and fade away. Having done the exact same thing with my friend Matthew Terrebonne when we were in our mid-teens and had never even heard of Brian Eno, let me assure you that it is turd-simple to create beautiful, mesmerizing collages of noise, drone and melody through this method. Especially if you don't SOLO over it for ten assfucking minutes. No Pussyfooting? Yeah, more like No PussyFUCKING! (because you're assfucking) (I guess I already said that)\n\nI could certainly do without this record, and heartily recommend that you do the same unless you're the sort to hang on Robert Fripp's every outrageous dissonant 'bwee'.\n\nHa ha! You caught me! Yes, \"outrageous dissonant 'bwee'\" was of course just a hilarious pun on 'courageous dissident Kyi,\" the true leader of Burma. A close \"Shave\" indeed!\n\nReader Comments\n\nBristolianish@aol.com\n\nThis is, indeed, the worst record of all time. I would rather pull my own teeth out than listen to this. It's a -10\n\nzach.charland@gmail.com\n\nOh wow! I love this record! While I agree that Swastika girls does suck, the first side - \"Heavenly Music Corporation\" is among some of the most powerful and sublime music I've ever heard. It's not Eno that makes the track, its Fripp. His soloing is so fraught with emotion, and his tone is thick and mean. I'd give it a 7 for that track alone.\n\nAfter listening to that one side, my head is swimming in extasy. Some would say that you need drugs to enjoy this music. I say the music IS drugs!\n\nAdd your thoughts? Here Come The Warm Jets  EG 1974\n\nSometimes I miss those innocent young days when I thought this album title referred to some hot airplanes flying through the air. Just flying free like a breeze on the wings of the night of a dream and a prayer of a life ever after. But watching women piss has its nostalgic charm too, I suppose.\n\nIF YOU GREW UP IN A WHOREHOUSE!\n\nEno at the outset of his career was a glam man who wore big gold makeup and robotic elevator shoes to the office every day, and his debut solo release certainly reflects this fashion obsession. However, behind all the fuzzed-out Sweet-style rhythm guitars, huge cock-rock guitar solos and campy light-in-the-nipples fluffernuttery, he was playing a magnificent assortment of Beatles-inspired pop music (the Lennon-out-the-ASS bitter piano attack \"Driving Me Backwards\" and exact Rutles replica \"Some Of Them Are Old\"), modern drone-tone pop rockers that any Flying Nun band would kill or die for (the title track driven by Eno's self-described 'warm jet guitar,' the hypnotic buzzery chime and celebratory vocal melody of \"Needles In The Camel's Eyes\"), and interesting takes on the music of his youth (the deconstructed Bo Diddley/carnival music hybrid \"Blank Frank,\" the generic doowop ballad with ear-blasting jet engine guitar solo \"Cindy Tells Me\"). His songwriting itself was thus fairly traditional (though quite accomplished in the melody department!); it was the oddball production and loopy playing that planted this baby deep into the underground.\n\nAhhh, I'll never forget the first time I planted a baby deep into the underground. You see, I was tending the garden when I mistook the neighbors' kid for a pumpkin seed. Next thing you know, I'm a MURDERER! And I'm MURDERING EVERYBODY IN TOWN!!!! ALL OVER THE PLACE!!! MURDER MURDER MURDER!!!! THEY'RE ALL DEAD NOW - THE WHOLE TOWN!!! So I started a record review site.\n\nSo you see, Brian Eno's first solo album is a goddarned really good pop-rock album full of repetitive melodies that he has buried in warm, humming, natural guitar and organ tones along with the occasional weird electronic blurble. It's by far his most NORMAL album, but it's good, man! I mean it! If you like late-60s Kinks or any of that '90s New Zealand crap, or even if you're just really into emo music and think that a man with such a like-sounding surname must be good by association, I hereby advise you to purchase this latest early debut first album by Robert Fripp's good buddy Brian, the finest of the Enos.\n\nAnd by \"Enos,\" I of course mean that funny deputy from The Dukes Of Hazzard. Remember that time the Duke boys ran him ragged until he drove his car into the lake and got his hat all wet? Ha ha! Oh, those Duke boys! And remember the time their cousin David joined the KKK and ran for public office? God bless those Duke boys of Hazzard County! I must see if they're on the TV right now.\n\n(*turns on TV, finds The Dukes of Hazzard*)\n\nHey wait a minute - who's this Luke prick? WHERE THE SHIT ARE FUCKIN' COY AND GODDAMNED VANCE!??!?!?!?\n\n(*literally shits brick*)\n\nOWWWWWWW!!!!!!!\n\nReader Comments\n\nbarrystoller@utopia2000.org\n\nPhil Manzanera's 1975 'Diamond Head' (featuring several nifty Eno tunes) is a natural companion LP to 'Warm Jets.' If you like this type of thinking man's glam, next stop: Be-Bop Deluxe. (Guitar man Bill Nelson also got the ambient bug later in his career, too bad.)\n\nwatta502@yahoo.gr (Akis Katsman)\n\nHere Come The Warm Jets is a great debut. How you can go wrong with songs like \"Baby's On Fire\" (love that Fripp guitar solo) and \"Cindy Tells Me\"? Not as ethereal as Another Green World or any of his truly ambient works, but still good experimental and clever rock. By the way, doesn't the vocal melody on \"Needles On The Camel's Eye\" sound too similar to the one on \"Sunday Morning\" by The Velvet Underground? Eno must have loved these guys...\n\nmwest@crsoftwareinc.com (Michael J. West)\n\nGod how I love this album. Very easily a 9 for me, in fact. Funny that you mention the best songs both in the same parentheses: the first and the last. I don't know that any other album opens on such a beautiful adrenalin rush as \"Needles in the Camel's Eyes\"--three notes and the LP's already one of your favorites. And then the last, which, as you probably know Mark, is practically an anthem in the eyes of the ever-so-literate arbiters who are WXYC, Chapel Hill. I love love love love love this album.\n\nslb23@shaw.ca (Simon B.)\n\nAn easy 9 for me too. I borrowed the record from my Uncle about 4 or 5 years ago, and taped it. I eventually wore the tape out, so I now have it on CD. Pretty much every member of Roxy Music (except for Bryan Ferry, of course) contributes, as does John Wetton (who was in King Crimson at the time). As for the comment made by Akis Katsman above, the vocal melody of \"Needles In A Camel's Eye\" does remind me of Velvet Underground's \"Sunday Morning\". Or maybe it's just the power of suggestion. The solo by Fripp on \"Baby's On Fire\" is one of his best. \"Driving Me Backwards\" creeped me out when I first heard it. I love how at one point in the begining of the title track the drums out out of sync with the other instruments. The only thing that I don't like that really stands out is the electronically manipulated (guitar?) solo in \"Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch\". If Eno was striving to find the most annoying sound for a solo, he succeded with flying colours.\n\nHere Comes the Warm Jets is surely one of the most innovative and best solo debuts of the 70's.\n\njb2533@hotmail.com\n\nAs I sit here, in Primghar, Iowa, watching crappy, terrible, CMT (Country Music Television), I think to myself........ hmmmmmmmm..... there's this song sung by this very ugly woman called \"My Give a Damn's Busted\"........ and I really hate it, it's probably the worst song I have ever heard, I'm actually mad. Then I see this video of these guys who look like the Grafeful Dead..... except these guys (I have no idea who they're called) have an unfortunate hit which will never reach number one or anything, but it's still bothersome and it's lyrics could have been written by a some 6th-grade Jewish kid........ oh wait, Jewish kids are smart, I wish I was Jewish.\n\nOk, ok, I don't know if I have the right to judge whether all these people's work is crappy........ but if I did, then I'd say it's the crappiest crap that I have ever had the witness watch someone crap.\n\nThen I realize, ok, there are a few country guys that I have heard of that I don't bloody hate.\n\nLike Dolly Parton, who is excellent when she decides to write her own material... and she's comming out of her LONG bad stage! I think, I don't know much about her.\n\nLucinda Williams is supposed to be good. Shania Twain is possibly the only REALLY sucessful contemporary pop acts I'll ever endorse. She has put forth her fair share of questionable stuff though.\n\nThen there's this album, Come Place the Hot Bets!!! HA HA!! I pulled a Mark Prindle on par with Hymen and Buttfunkle! Ok, not quite on par with that. Hmmm, look at this, it's 3:49 A.M..... I have school tomorrow. Oh well. Ok, Here Come The Warm Jets is very interesting, and is a fine solo debut album, one of the finest. Eno was dissmissed in his day as being a frivilous Bowie-type character (from what I hear). I can understand the comparison, but, even despite Bowie's now solidified, if somewhat questionable, status as IMMORTAL, Brian Eno is the greater talent. Here Come The Warm Jets is effortlessly as good as the best of Bowie's material. It's not great, though. It's quite entertaining.... but it gets old quickly. There's quite a bit going on musically... or a-musically, but there's not nearly enough going on lyrically. As a collection of catchy-as-hell and odd pop songs, Here Come The Warm Jets excels. As a TRULY great album, it falls short. But I'm probably missing the point. So, I guess the essence (or whatever word you wannna use) is completely lost on me. The album DOES display the genius of Brian Eno, though, possibly one of the most underrated (at least by the press) rock-guys ever. I'd, like Mark Prindle, give this one a solid 8.\n\nBut like many albums, Here Come The Warm Jets has a recommendabilty that is far beyond the rating that it is usually given. Kinda like Harvest.\n\ndullygray@letterboxes.org\n\nI believe if I were to compile a 20-greatest-albums-ever-recorded list, it would be a reasonable, but sad affair. All stone-gold, acknowledged classics: Quadrophenia, Abbey Road, All Things Must Pass, Arthur, Beggars Banquet, London Calling\n\nSo I was delighted when slowly but confidently Kate Bushs The Dreaming and this very record started slipping in there; both original, inventive, adventurous, reasonably weird.\n\nSonically, Here Come The Warm Jets is two thirds glam-rock, one third ambient (never ever boring!) and is of course impeccable. The atmosphere, the arrangements (guitar-heavy) are breathtaking, presenting a wonderful foil for Brians detached, emotionally warm vocals. Manzaneras guitar is glammy and infectious (Babys On Fire), but its particularly inspiring when Eno goes off with keyboards (Driving Me Backwards) and weird orchestration (Dead Finks Dont Talk, with fantastic mock-Ferry vocals).\n\nLyrically, its odd and hilarious. Check out Cindy Tells Me, for instance, which is Brians impossibly catchy and bizarre take on feminism.\n\nMelodically, its brilliant. Every single melody on the album is unforgettable, even if Black Frank is just a bombastic, glammy take on Bo Diddleys beat. Driving Me Backwards may be a tad simplistic, but vocal-wise and atmosphere-wise its still among the best songs ever written. I cant help singing along to that nonsense. Other quieter numbers are also wonderful, like the soft, moody, half-instrumental On Some Faraway Beach (wouldnt be out of place on the second side of Before And After Science) and especially the gorgeous, pensive Some Of Them Are Old.\n\nFor me, its Enos strongest, richest, most diverse record (but all those four sung albums of Brians are classics). Its his GodWeenSatan, only much, much more coherent. Needless to say, a ten.\n\nAdd your thoughts? * Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) - EG 1974 *\n\nIf you've been down to the Shiznit Store lately, you've probably noticed that every shelf is stocked with copies of Taking Tiger Mountain by the band Strategy. Well, there's a good reason for that -- this album IS the Sh\n\nAlso, it's not by a band called Strategy; that's actually part of the album title. The album itself is of course by top-selling '70s act EG 1974. You see, when Denny Laine was caught with his tongue up Lind\n\nThere are many who say that a \"writer\" shouldn't \"write\" if he has no interest at goddamned all in \"writing\" at a particular moment. But these are people who don't understand the nature of entropy. If one stops writing -- even for ONE SECOND -- that person will get caught up in an endless lazy cycle of not creating anything ever. As such, that person (Brian Eno) must -- I mean MUST -- write one record review every day, regardless of mood, food stamps or congregation. Luckily, when reviewing the work of such a talented young man as Brian Eno, this man (Brian Eno) need not worry about navigating the urine-stained keys -- the words appear on the screen independent of manual ac\n\nThis album is darker and full of much more electronic instrumental interplay than the debut, but its focus remains chiefly on pop rock music. Mr. Elbo is becoming even more adept at slowly adding in multiple sonic elements as his songs progress; the bare tunes themselves are still pretty repetitive, but he adds so many tones, noises and additional instruments to the mix, they still wind up overwhelmingly engaging. As a bit of description, the drum tones are as crisp as a crunchy pile of Autumn leaves, the guitar is generally either as skrankly as barbed wire or as fuzzed-out and mesmerizing as a Snakefinger solo, and the organ/piano melodies are a dreamboat for the ears. My only minor complaint is that the vocals too often subscribe to that annoying David Bowie double-tracked identical performance method. The one that the Ramones used on their album Ramones before they all died within three weeks of each other.\n\nBut more so than all this -- there's just so much STUFF going on in every song! Depending on which part of the CD you rest your turntable needle upon, you're wont to hear percussion that sounds like knives being sharpened (\"The Great Pretender\"), an ugly treated out-of-tune pile of shit that's either a violin, a horn, a guitar or any combination of the above (\"Put A Straw Under Baby\"), a bass guitar that completely switches key during the last minute and a half of the song, magically transforming the song into an amelodic mess of cacophony (\"Third Uncle\"), a rhythm break performed on a typewriter (\"China My China\") and even a lovely display of one of my all-time favorite melodic tricks -- that of playing a rotating, repeating three-chord riff over a 4/4 beat (\"The True Wheel\"). With this kind of zaniness, who needs clowns?\n\nPlease don't take that comment seriously. We all need clowns.\n\nTaking Tigger's Mountain (By Brian Eno) is the perfect Eno pop album before he began experimenting with his less-than-exciting furniture music. Buy it tomorrow and we'll all agree together that it is a cerebral, eclectic and agelessly hummable collection of beautiful Kinksy nostalgia, pre-punk aggression and scratchy experimental rock. It's also less cutesy and fey than the original -- always a plus if you're not really into music at all but just play it to get laid like I do. I own more than 15,000 albums and CDs, and each one is specifically designed to get me in the pants of a slightly different type of broad. I couldn't even tell you what most of them sound like -- I just label 'em by body shape, hair color, occupation, age, stupidity level, etc. Fuckin' broads are so easy to ball, the slutty hair-holes. Here, I'll demonstrate with Elton John's The One.\n\nSee that??? Within minutes, I'm thowin it at a 75-year-old man!!!\n\nReader Comments\n\nslb23@shaw.ca (Simon B.)\n\nI came across this album while looking in the Brian Eno section of my former favourite music store (it moved) called Into the Music. I had originally went there that day to purchase No Pussyfooting by Fripp and Eno, but it had disappeared. Disappointed, I went straight to the Brian Eno section, and found a *new* (unopened) copy of Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) for only $6.75!! I was overjoyed, even though I had barely heard of it. I bought it. And when I got home to listen to it, I thought it was the weirdest music I'd heard yet from Eno (having only heard Here Come the Warm Jets up to that point). But it gradually grew on me, and I still listen to it four years later.\n\nSide Note: the \"ugly treated out-of-tune pile of sh*t that's either a violin, a horn, a guitar or any combination of the above\" you mention is actually the Portsmouth Sinfonia: a group of unskilled string players, which I believe that Eno was once a part of (possibly before Roxy Music)\n\ntheironchefpresident@gmail.com (Nathan \"Sakai\" Schulz)\n\nI got this CD from my library, and copied it, along with Another Green World, Before and After Science, and Wrong Way Up. Why did he have to waste his talent? After this, it seems his music got worse and worse. Music For Airports? Who does he think we are? Shitheads?\n\nMatthewByrd@hotmail.com\n\ndang it, this guy Mark, I have Another Green World and Here Come The Warm Jets. I think to myself............. HMMMM, now all I need is Before And After Science.... then I'm done with this Eno guy. Turns out Mark likes Taking Tiger Mountain. Now I have to get it, even though he thinks Sticky Fingers is the best of the Rolling Stones, The White Album is the best of the Beatles, Born In The U.S.A. is the best of Bruce Springsteen, and Blood On The Tracks is the best of Bob Dylan, even through all this I know I have to get Taking Tiger Mountain, you know why? Because if Mark says it's great then there'll be some part of you that is saying the same thing or some part you that should be saying the same thing. I also just looked at some of my other comments...... I'm kind of an idiot, those are dumb. I give about half of those albums ratings that are good, like maybe a bull shark or oceanic whitetip, but Mark gives 'em all Mako sharks (I {everyone should} rate things in sharks now). One day I think........ hmmm.... maybe I'll get a Public Enemy cd...... I almost buy It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back, then I look to say what Mark says and he recommends some 91 Apocalypse thing that no one has heard of........ I think my life has just hit rock bottom.\n\nColin T.\n\ni sat on this album for about a year before i decided to sit down with it. and i couldn't! it had me up and dancing! \"third uncle\" sounds like wire and it's so great i can't hardly when i hear of it. what a great album; so much fun; i feel dumbassy for not putting it on immediately: DON'T YOU MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!!\n\nsasa.podunavec@yahoo.com\n\nBurning Airlines Give You So Much More is one of my favorite song titles. I'm even interested in seeing the opera Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy because of Eno.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Another Green World  EG 1975\n\nMore like Another Great Album, if you ask the listener with ears named Me! But a conundrum has stricken me -- In fact, I'm torn.\n\nRip Torn, that is! Hi everyone! You know, back in my heyday as I starred in such mass market successes as Freddy Got Fingered, nobody could have imagined that I suffered from incontinence. That's because I used \"My Own Hand\"! That's right -- I would simply urinate into my own hand every five minutes and wipe it on a co-star. You see, t\n\nI'm torn because every piece of information I could give you about Brian Eno's career proper can be found just as easily by you on the Internet, which is where I would find it. So what's the point in that? I never claimed to be a one-stop Brian Eno shop of material stolen from other sources! I'm just the Review Man, reviewing every album in the palm of my hand! But see, to understand where Eno is coming from with his \"ambient\" shit, it's probably pretty important to mention that he came up with the concept while recuperating from an accident -- when he couldn't reach his radio to turn the music up louder than the elemental noise outside. This was when it hit him that music could serve as just another, non-intrusive part of a person's environment. Sure, folks like you and me would have experimented with this idea for one album and gotten back to real music, but not old Ryan Beano! He took to it like a fish to marillion and is still riding the same tired white horse (cocaine) even today. But let's not get ahead of ourselves; I'm reviewing an album from 1975 here. To discuss any post-75 event in this forum would be like a dictionary using a word that starts with a \"d\" in the definition of a word that starts with \"a\"! Can you imagine? Nobody would understand what the hell they were talking about! This is because, at birth, people read and memorize the dictionary from beginning to end.\n\nBrian Eno's first exploration into the ambience of gentle synthesizer wisps and fake strings actually turned out quite wonderful, mainly because he stuck to song structure. Only five of these 14 songs have vocals, but the nine instrumentals are NOT (as would later be the case) just triplets of electric piano notes echoing over themselves for 30 minutes at a clip. They're songs. Monotonous, half-written sketches of songs, but easily recognizable and lovely melodies nonetheless.\n\nThe first couple tunes present a brand new Eno - FUNKMaster Eno! With a funkyass bassmaster and some funky krautrock groove drum action and weird noises all floatin' in and out and muthafuckin' shit, but then NO MORE! After that, it's all warm sunny fantasy-tones and heartbreaking melancholy psychedelia (and four jolly vocal pop songs). Actually, most of the instrumentals are reminiscent of Pink Floyd's early soundtrack material, only much more evocative for the most part. The chosen tones are simple perfection: dark Autumn shadows and anxiety-riddled opium slumbers haunt every second of pulsating guitar/organ tracks like \"Spirits Drifting,\" \"In Dark Trees,\" and \"Sombre Reptiles,\" while the optimistic glee of droning ecstasy wafts like a raft through the gentle tides of \"The Big Ship\" and the title track. Comparatively, the five full-band pop songs seem completely out of place, leaving the unsuspecting listener wondering, \"Why's the happy British man with the piano ruining my heroin 'trip'? They're gorgeous compositions nonetheless; it's just strange to hear a few traditional ditties wedged haphazardly between so many explorations of pure music-as-emotion. Still, what kind of monster could complain about a song based upon the repeated-five-billion-times refrain, \"I'll come running to tie your shoe\"?\n\nWait! I know what kind of monster! SOME Kind Of Monster! \"Dude, I was like joggin' this morning and thinking about comin' in here and seein' you and the only word I could think of was 'FUCK!'\"\n\n\"FUCK!\"\n\n..\n\n.\n\nFUUUUCK!\n\nFUCK!!\"\n\n...\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\"FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSee, the crazy thing is that I could have SWORN Lars Ulrich was a brain surgeon by the way he sued all his fans that time. Who'da guessed he's actually a big dumb asshole?\n\nReader Comments\n\nwatta502@yahoo.gr (Akis Katsman)\n\nAnother Green World is an AWESOME album, one of my favourites ever. Every time I hear this album I go to other places and feel so peaceful and calm. My favourites are \"Golden Hours\", \"The Big Ship\" (with the awesome Fripp solo) and \"Becalmed\" but it means to be listened as a whole. Another cool moment is the very start of \"Spirits Drifting\", it always reminds me of ghosts and halloween nights! Best Eno album, hands down, and that's saying something. Great to listen to while watching the stars in the sky. 10/10\n\nddickson@rice.edu\n\nGood GOD, you're funny.\n\nI only listened to this album once. I don't remember much about it, except that I fell asleep before track seven, and I really really liked it while I was awake. Good contrast from all the booty-rap playing outside my window. Barring further listens, a nine.\n\nBilldude\n\nThis is a 10 and probably the most listened-to of all the vintage albums I picked up this year. It would have been a 7 at first, though, and I think every review should come with a disclaimer noting that you probably won't understand what's so great about it right away. Some of them already do (like Christgau's, one of his better reviews--I guarantee you, no Christgau-puddery in that one) but some of it seems so simple, like, say, \"Zawinul/Lava\" for instance (\"geez, four piano notes and some noise in the background\"), that at first I put this one aside and didn't listen to closely.\n\nBut, then, gradually, the unnerving sensation that I wanted to listen to it again came over me, and I put it in the CD player again and again and again, usually as background music while doing exercise or washing dishes or whatnot and gradually it hit me that just about everything on this album is excellent, even the little quickie numbers. One thing that needs to be noted is that not ONCE does Eno hit quite the same mood or sound on the fourteen different tracks. Another thing is that the \"hooks\" seem really simple (\"Everything Merges With The Night\"--it's that little treated guitar part between the verses!). Third, all the song titles turn out to be really accurate as to each track's sound. But yes, gradually it overwhelms you just how memorable everyone of these miniature \"sound paintings\" hits, and it really does feel like the album equivalent of browsing an art gallery. Only \"Becalmed\" and the title track hit me at first, but eventually....and no, I never had to \"try harder\" to get it. I just compulsively wanted to listen to the album that much.\n\nAnd God that crystal-clear production. What album from 1975, regardless of remastering, sounded clearer and brighter in addition to sounding so ahead of its time? My initial guess as to the album's date would have been maybe 1981 or so. It really doesn't sound very dated at all, though. Only the puny drum machines give away the 1975 date, and those aren't used in a way that detracts from the album either.\n\nNo 70s collection could possibly be complete without this one. I haven't heard \"Before Or After Science\" yet but otherwise this is a clear front runner for Eno's best.\n\nalexmortland@hotmail.com\n\nYou DO realize that it's Mistah Supahfresh Pimpzilla himself, PHIL MOTHERFUCKIN' COLLINS providing the \"funky Krautrock groove drum action\" on this bitch, right? Right?!\n\nFuckin' A.\n\nsasa.podunavec@yahoo.com\n\nIt might not be Brian's finest, but it's really, really good. The ambient pieces are all nice. \"I'll come running to tie your shoe\" - Hehe! \"Spirits Drifting\" is the scariest and emptiest song in my book. The record is worth your money for that song alone!\n\ndaniel.lawrence.tapia@gmail.com\n\nThis might be my favorite Brian Eno album. While I LOVE \"Taking Tiger Mountain...\" because it's the exact kind of super-creative 70's pop David Bowie was never able to deliver, this record is just too beautiful. One of those few records I'm always in the mood to hear because--as a whole--it's so peaceful, calming, and lovely. I think \"The Big Ship\" has to be one of my favorite songs of all time, totally up there \"Joy Ride\" by Roxette and Trio's \"Da Da Da.\"\n\nBob Royale\n\nI've got to say, this is my favorite Brian Eno album. Even though I actively hate \"I'll Come Running\" (I find it annoying in it's cutesy-ness), I love every other song on here. This one and Taking Tiger Mountain are both where the earlier more rock stuff and later more ambient stuff came together, and this one just comes out on top for me. I did hear it before TTMBS, and have more memories with this, so that might have something to do with it. The weird, flangey (or something) guitar over bass and drums trading off actually playing the beat on Sky Saw hooks me every time, and (as long as I skip the one song that just doesn't do it for me), this is some great \"driving around in nature by yourself\" music. It's just so individualistic sounding, and everything sounds so lush... to my ears, he outsmarted himself on his later work, but the ones before this were headed here. Probably one of my favorite albums ever recorded. Everyone who likes smart (but not cereberal, if that makes any sense) music would not be wasting their time to listen to this. It's one of those weird, interesting albums that actually is \"all about the music\". I won't knock the guy for making a ton of money producing bands I don't like and basically doing whatever the hell he wanted for most of his later albums (they're just not my thing -good for him), but this one is really special and it would have been great if he'd gone further with this sound.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Discreet Music  EG 1975\n\nAlbums like this make it clear why \"Eno\" is Latin for \"Anus.\" This was Brian's first full-scale attempt at an ambient record, see. And I'm no fool who thinks that an ambient record is intended to be actively \"listened to,\" so I turned it on and sat on the couch to read a fine book with pictures of naked people in it. At first, I was swept away by the lovely, relaxing tones of the 4 sustained piano notes repeating and looping over themselves in simple, pretty fashion. Unfortunately, they then continued for 30 minutes, changing only when two of the FOUR TOTAL NOTES dropped out for about 15 minutes in the middle. It put my wife to sleep, but it actively annoyed me. Why reduce the lovely four notes to a boring two? I thought the goal was to serve as a charming background pattern for my everyday life -- why was he trying to make me fall asleep? Was he planning to rob my home? Did he really think he was going to get past my ever-vigilant dog with that embarrassing bald head of his? Maybe that kind of crap works in sleepy old London towne but not here in the gritty, hardened Upper East Side of Manhattan, where the streets run red with the blood of the naive. We're HARD here. Don't come around messing wit -- oh no! The washing machine's off-balance! My frillies!\n\nBut my main problem with the CD is the next three songs. All three are \"extrapolations\" on the theme of Pachelbel's Canon In D -- a lovely song, no? Yes? Yes! Perhaps you played it at your wedding. We all love it, and so does everybody else. However, in Eno's hirsute, apelike hands, a lovely string section is allowed to perform that timeless melody exactly ONE TIME before Brian fucks around with everything so that the final 20 minutes of the album constantly HINT AT that lovely, enchanting melody without EVER, EVER, EVER actually playing it again. How on Fuck's Earth is that supposed to be calming? I could actually picture Eno cackling an evil laugh and making the strings play a bunch of bullshit modern classical tuneless crap as I sat there like a schlemiel, waiting on pins and needles for Pachelbel's lovely motif to return. And sure, part of my stress may have been a result of sitting down like a schlemiel in the middle of my ass acupuncture appointment, but if Eno were any good at this ambient tooty fruity, wouldn't he have helped me forget? Wouldn't he have helped me drink to forget? Look, we all know how I feel about Hurricane Charley, so don't get me started on Flying Sack Of Shit Indiscreet Music.\n\nReader Comments\n\nslb23@shaw.ca (Simon B.)\n\nThis is essentially Eno's first ambient album. The title track is very repetitive but calming, and acutally works as good background music if played very low. However, I think that 30 minutes is stretching it. 20 minutes would've been better. The next three tracks, variations on \"Pachelbel's Canon in D\", I find actually interesting to listen to and in the concept itself. 7/10\n\nadrian.mee@gmail.com\n\nI'm gonna suggest that maybe you don't have any place reviewing music that you simply have no understanding of. If you have absolutely zero appreciation for ambient music then simply do not review ambient records. What I'm saying is just because people trust you to review Dinosaur Jr. records doesn't mean you have any place reviewing Bulgarian folk music, 16th century choral music or any other style that you simply don't have a fucking clue about.\n\n<3\n\nAdd your thoughts? Evening Star (with Robert Fripp)  Island 1975\n\nGuitars. Where would we be without them? Would children still sing and birds still play the lute? I don't think so. In fact, I don't think so at all. No, not without guitars.\n\nOn Evening Star, Robert Fripp plays guitars. Hundreds and thousands of guitars. I'm rounding up, but he plays guitars. Brian Eno then plugs these guitars through a tape loop thingy to create tape loops over which Robert Fripp plays additional guitars. The result is Guitars! Guitars! Guitars! Also, mellowness.\n\nThe first track sounds like My Bloody Valentine if they didn't write songs and only knew one chord. But as the side progresses, modal beds of serene guitar drones are topped with small peaceful melodies and tuneful solos. Occasionally a piano pops in. This is all wonderful and heartwarming, and nuclear war is averted through love.\n\nSide two darkens the mood and expands the concept to a near half-hour epic of rise, climax and decay. Guitars take place, hypnotically. In no rush to get to a chorus, Fripp piles on more and more tiny riffs, allowing each one to slowly fade away over time. This is \"An Index of Metals,\" and should be treated as such.\n\nI can't keep my eyes open.\n\nHere are some great guitar jokes you might have read about in the Almanac:\n\nWhat's the difference between an acoustic guitar and Britney Spears?\n\nAn acoustic guitar has a much smaller hole in the middle.\n\nHow many guitars does it take to screw in a light bulb?\n\nI don't want to put a d\"AMP\"er on your fun, but not very many!\n\nWhy did the guitar cross the road?\n\nTo get to the other sddddddddgj.\n\nWhere's the guitar?

Before And After Science  EG 1977\n\nSo I was on Jay Leno the other night promoting my hilarious new parody of Loverboy's \"Workin' For The Weekend\" (entitled \"Everybody's Jerkin' Off The Milkman\") when suddenly I realized, \"Wait a minute. What am I doing here? I'm straight!\" As I climbed off of him and slipped my gooey brown phallus back between my tight leather legs, I suddenly realized why I'm not as fond of Before And After Science as I am of Eno's first three non-ambient albums. It's a bit hard to explain in your human language, but I'll do my best with the limited vocabulary you have provided: Side one isn't very good.\n\nFoist of all (as a man with an accent might say), the Eenman has discovered the bubbly tribal rhythms of world music that he would later inject into the Talking Heads' work, but hasn't found a way to combine it with his pop songwriting strengths, resulting in the embarrassing ultra-white faux-funk opener \"No One Receiving\" and goofy children's song \"Kurt's Rejoinder.\" SeXXXondly (as a man addicted to pornography might say), his voice has deepened to the point where he sounds like an oafish British cartoon character, unable to bring the proper warmth and gentleness to the could-have-been-a-nice-beachy-number \"Here He Comes.\" Turdly (as a coprophile might say), Eno's awkward attempt to pay tribute to goodtime straight-up rock and roll (\"King's Lead Hat\") is even more awkward and boneheaded than Yes's classic \"Rejoice, Rejoice.\" And fourthly (as a salesman in a dildo store might say), the mega-ugly sci-fi atrocity \"Energy Fools The Musician\" should NEVER have been on the Rock And Roll High School soundtrack and would be better ripped off the vinyl and left thousands of miles out at sea along with its pussy-ass Todd Rundgren buddy \"A Dream Lives On Forever.\"\n\nBut that was all too specific, which is no help to the bleeding consumer eager for a musical tourniquet (or Vitamin K). More generally, side one presents Eno doing what he does WORST. He is NOT a goodtime rock and roller, nor the headsmith of an African tribal dance ritual, nor a funky James Brown black entertainer, nor even a Buck Rogers-style laserbeam space guy: in fact, he is none of these things and more. And that's the real problem with side one -- only one track, the wonderfully infectious \"Backwater,\" shows us the talented songsmith Eno we used to know. The \"Before Science\" Eno, I guess. This lousy \"After Science\" Eno can suck an egg.\n\nWhich brings us to side B -- the good side. Good? Hell, GOOD good! In my fact, these four tracks could very well be the most emotionally powerful and gently gorgeous compositions in the Eno catalog! Built upon the soft tones of the electric piano, waves of lush keyboards, pianos and/or strings/horns of some sort (unless that's ANOTHER keyboard. Who can tell in today's busy world of synthesized noise?), this entire side of slow-paced music conjures up a mood of early-morning blues and greys -- love and fear, bliss and anxiety -- the feeling of facing another day in an unfeeling world where you can only work for the good and try to avoid the bad. The passing away of the hippy fantasy. Freedom from society, but not from loneliness or pain. And sure, the lyrics are probably just more meaningless Eno wordplay crap, but the music perfectly captures the confusing disillusion that haunted so many young minds as the magic mushroom '60s hardened into the heroin '70s.\n\nWhy Eno was unable to capture that mood until 1977, I don't know. Maybe he goes by dog years?\n\nReader Comments\n\nwatta502@yahoo.gr (Akis Katsman)\n\nI agree that side A isn't as mindblowing as side B, but that doesn't mean it isn't any great. I love \"Backwater\" and \"King's Lead Hat\". The other songs there are cool too, especially the rhythms, very similar to Talking Heads. As for the second side, it's pure bliss! My personal favourite is \"By This River\". It's so simple, yet as beautiful as a little white puppy! I love that piano line. \"Julie With\" is pure hypnotic atmosphere (Eno's forte, you see) and the other two songs are awesome as well. Even the underrated instrumental \"Through Hollow Lands\" is prime material, it's so beautiful and calm! My rating is a high 9!\n\nAlso, I think that this record may have influenced even Joy Division! Please don't tell me that the first two songs here don't sound like the first two on Closer! Is it a coincidence? I don't think so.\n\nenochkane@earthlink.net (Patrick McCarthy)\n\nRegarding the influence of the instrumentation/arrangements on the Talking Heads, one should take note that \"King's Lead Hat\" is in fact an anagram for Talking Heads. The road of influence is sometimes two ways...\n\n\"By This River\" in my opinion is the best Eno vocal performance. The harmonies at the end are inspired, and Cluster (listed on the album under their names) are a welcome collaboration on this record (how much more Phil Collins can one take? That's where all that \"tribal\" drumming came from!). I only wish that the song went on longer.\n\nIs this also a concept record?\n\nddickson@rice.edu\n\nBah. A pox on thee. This album is the best of the four Enos I've heard (this, Taking Tiger Mountain by Shania Twain, Another Envious World, and Here Come the Women Peeing, can you tell I'm incredibly sleep=deprived) and it bundles all that's good about him into one package. I think he IS a good funkster, albeit not a black one, and \"King's Lead Hat\" is nothing more than a parody (and an anagram) of the Talking Heads. So it's not MEANT to be good- time rock and/or roll. Notice Eno sounds exactly like David Byrne on that track. Hil-arious.\n\nAnd you were right about side B. Good shit.\n\nPlus, the whole thing, while unique, doesn't sound exactly ahead of its time, so it's still got that warm cozy '70's vibe to it. I give it a ten. Or at least a nine and a half.\n\nBy the way, did you notice how all the pundits are calling the VP debate a \"draw?\" I'm pro-Edwards, but I think he got his ass kicked.\n\nslb23@shaw.ca (Simon B.)\n\nBefore and After Science just might be my favourite Eno record. I first listened to it when I borrowed the LP from my Uncle about 4 or 5 years ago. \"No One Recieving\" reminds me of \"Sky Saw\" on Another Green World. \"Backwater\" is such a catchy, fun song. \"Kurt's Rejoiner\" is just weird, with its off-kilter rhythm by occasionally phased drums and nonsensical lyrics. \"Energy Fools the Magician\" is one of my very favourite short Eno instrumentals (i think it should've been on Side Two). \"King's Lead Hat\" is just wacky, and fun.\n\n\"Here He Comes\" I feel should've been on Side One, it being at a faster tempo than the rest of side two. Great guitar and bass.\n\n\"Julie With...\" is contender for my fav. song on the album....beautiful yet eerie.\n\n\"By this River\" is also one of my fav. songs on the album. Great vocals, wonderful harmonies at the end.\n\n\"Through Hollow Lands\" isn't as good as the rest, but still not bad.\n\n\"Spider and I\" is a great closer to a great album. Nice warm synth tones, optimistic lyrics.\n\nIMHO a wonderful album.\n\nmartyhughley@news.oregonian.com\n\nI think, having started with a \"review\" of my fave, \"Before and After Science,\" that I'll waste time reading no further. Not because the writer doesn't like the album as much as I do, but because any insight he might offer is buried amid such a juvenile, self-indulgent writing style that offers no respect to the reader.\n\nAdd Your Thoughts? Ambient 1: Music For Airports  EG 1978\n\nEverybody loves an airport; 'tis no shame to admit it. In fact, tis a crime to NOT admit it, and you will be taken to jail. However, one thing that most of us in these United Snakes of Captivity can agree upon is that Brian Eno doesn't understand bo diddley about the common man.\n\nPardon me, for I have exaggerated. Brian Eno's Music For Airports has four tracks, and two of them are perfect for the airport environment. Track one, for one of two possible examples, is a divine, tranquil series of 4 or 5 piano notes repeated over a soothing electronic wash soundscape. Whether awaiting a flight from Peru or taking a dump in your shoe, you would find your airfield stress greatly reduced by the warm, cozy tones exuded in the hilariously titled \"1/1.\" A similar thumbs up can be physically applied to the rectal column of track four, satirically entitled \"2/2.\" This synthesizer ambience rings of hope and a new tomorrow -- exactly what most of us are seeking as we prepare to fly a silver bird into the sky where wings take dream. So for these two heartwarming espressos of sound alone, Eno has earned his pilots license regarding understanding bo diddley about the common man. I truly made an unconscionable error in suggesting that he is somehow out of touch with the nature of man and his airport needs, and for this I dearly, belatedly, posthumously apologize.\n\nHowever, on \"1/2\" and \"2/1,\" Eno makes it clear that he doesn't understand bo diddley about the common man, and might as well just throw his organ out the window. And I think you KNOW what I mean by \"organ\"!!!!!!! (Wurlitzer made out of kidneys) These two icy, somber electronic works suck all the life and fun out of the airport, replacing it with depressing rainstorms, miserable freezing air conditioner, the departure of a loved one and an overriding hopelessness so powerful that the only escape is to set off a grenade during your flight. You wanna know why 9/11 happened, check out what the Iraqi terrorists from Iraq who were born in Iraq and represented the country of Iraq were listening to on their Walkmans that day. Prepare yourself mentally for what I am about to reveal, for it may very well tear your little world apart. The police missed this key piece of evidence, but I found it while ransacking the area for gold doubloons. Here then is the REAL truth behind the most catastrophic attack on U.S. soil since the revolutionary war: the Iraqi terrorists were listening to BRIAN ENO'S MUSIC FOR A - hey, do you have any idea what this bump is on my testicle? It's been there for a couple of weeks now. I squeezed some blood out of it a couple of times, but it's still there. I don't think it's cancer because it's on the outside of the scrotum. But anyway, the terrorists were listening to TAPES OF MUSLIM BULLSHIT.\n\nTwo hopeful dreamy ethereal rainbows of airport relaxation, and two misguided dark clouds of overcast sky: that's what Brian Eno thinks of America, so stick THAT in your tie and tie it!\n\nReader Comments\n\nknowstev@med.umich.edu (Steven Knowlton)\n\nDon't wait - see a doctor now. It might be skin cancer. I'm not kidding. Good luck.\n\njamesagardner@yahoo.com\n\nYou're right, the evocative song titles Eno chose for Music for Airports rank right up there with \"Baby's On Fire\" and \"Dead Finks Don't Talk.\" Or perhaps I misunderstood your point. But what did I expect on an album with a title, Ambient 1, that sounds like a prescription sleep aid?\n\nWhile it's tough to choose just a single favorite track on Ambien: Music for Long Air Flights, if I did it would be \"2/2\" ... something about it reminds me of this album of (no, honestly!) trancey music performed on synths and ... tuba. Really! It's from this cool label, Innova, that puts out all kinds of weirdness. Look into Bowed Metal Music by Peter Warren, fer a fer-instance.\n\nIt's creepy, although not quite as creepy as The Soothing Sounds of Eno.\n\nioncristi@hotmail.com (Cristi from Romania...an orthodox-christian\n\nhmm... first, sorry for my bad english. let's say that there are lots of muslim bullshit mp3's ... but... you are in America,right ? And if you are in America, go to a Richard Hagopian & Kef Time concert. It is possible that ypu'll change your opinion about that 'muslin bullshit'\n\nAdd your thoughts? Music For Films  EG 1978\n\nAs America's leading and most popular author and historian, people constantly ask me, \"Mark, what is your favorite film?\" Well, the truth is that I don't have a favorite film. Unlike a record album, I consider a film to be one of those things you watch once and then forget about, like an old shoe or a wedding anniversary. However, of all the movies I've seen -- and I just watched Seven Doors Of Death last night, so I do stay current - not a single one of them features a track from this album. Why is this? Am I simply a stick in the mud? Am I like the proverbial water that only flows in one direction instead of flowing all over the place and flooding peoples' homes? Possibly, yes. But even more so than that, I'm like the old joke: Knock Knock. Who's there? Tennis. Tennis who? Tennis E. Williams!\n\nPut it all together and the facts are clear - these songs were never intended to be in any REAL films at all! Brian just recorded them on a whim one day between the years of 1975 and 1978 and then set about trying to sneak them into motion pictures he showed at his own home. For example, let me give you an example.\n\nThese 18 tracks DO sound like incidental music from films. The first half of the CD is even chock a block full of actual melodies, of all insane creations! Lots of short haunting pieces of cinematic new age music created by fancy expensive synthesizers and plain jane cheapass pianos. The shorter lengths of the tracks allow you to actually LISTEN if you want to (as opposed to Airports From Death, which you have to treat as background music else your ears slide off your head from boredom). Evocative soft tones of restfulness, Radioheady eerie scares, echoes, the Zombies' \"Time Of The Season,\" dramatic, lingering, wistful, satisfying, some of it even sounds like music The Cure would use on their depressing goth albums!\n\nShittily, the album takes a nose wash halfway through, converting into lazy, empty, unappealing dogdix that would never make the cut of a major motion picture studio. For example, \"Strange Light.\" Or those others. Emotionless, drab crap. A man needs expressive music in his film. Perhaps the last half of this album was intended for a Spiro Agnew documentary? The funky cocaine beats, echoey martial drums, science fiction nerdiness, African tribal pop, violin scrapes, Residentsy nothingness - I'm talking about the second half, Jack - and that ain't no flack, Mac. Gimme some slack, hack a hacky-sack, don't get wack, eat a Big Mac, Drac, lick my sac, wac, flackity-pack, Jack, Rack a kack of nack, Pack. Flack a shack in a track of gack. SMELL MY GACK! SMELL MY GODDAMNED GACK!\n\nIt's all instrumental. Not a single word to speak of. As the Monkees once sang so harmoniously, \"Words that never were true/Just spoken to help nobody but you/Words with lies inside/But small enough to hide til your playing was through.\" On the very self-same Dolenz/Nesmith/Tork/Jones album, you could also find the psychedelic moog-driven '60s anthem that is still quoted by international statesmen today, \"Daily Nightly.\" Has mortal man ever penned a more potent description of inner discovery than the eye-gouging couplet \"Dark and rolling figures move through prisms of no color/Hand in hand they walk the night but never know each other\"? If such is the case, nobody ever shared this magical \"other song\" with mine truly, Yours.\n\nThe first half of this Brian Eno album (for that is what we are discussing here) is so special that its very specialty is a synonym for \"beautiful\" that I should look up someday so I can stop using the same words over and over. You know what I love about George W. Bush? The way he lies about everything. Even when he has a good idea (i.e. establish a U.S.-friendly presence in the middle east so we can keep an eye on all the radical Muslims and make sure they don't FUCK us again), he lies about it. He's too full of shit for a human being to be.\n\nAlso, his pants.\n\nEno. Dark pitches, sonic beeping, foreboding like a dark submarine thriller. This is music that sounds like it's from a movie, just like that Fantomas album. You know the one I mean! We ALL know the one I mean! That one with the whatever!\n\nReader Comments\n\nmradamcooley@hotmail.com\n\nI just read you watched seven doors of death (which is the same movie as the Beyond, I believe). Well, you need to check out the following films:\n\nBad Taste\n\nDead Alive (the goriest movie of all time, no joke)\n\nMANIAC\n\nNew York Ripper\n\nAND THAT'S ALL.\n\nAdd your thoughts? In a Land of Clear Colours (with Peter Sinfield)  Voiceprint 1979\n\nTo be honest, Eno doesn't do much of anything on this album; it's really just Peter Sinfield reciting some nerdy sci-fi story he wrote while living in his parents' basement and jurkin off to naked cartoon characters. Eno's contributions are limited to atmospheric electronic drones, synthesizer bird noises, and bringing over some Dorito's for Peter Sinfield to munch on while watching Mystery Science Theater 3000.\n\nBritish Isles resident Peter Sinfield narrates his story, which involves a man living on a planet with some geeky loser name and hanging out with his girlfriend \"Linnea\" and friends \"Wolfing\" and \"Durnish.\" They all live together and have communal sex, in a chapter Sinfield typed with one hand. Then they hold a ceremony and take hallucinogenic drugs and eventually everybody dies and turns into animals, which later die and turn into plants (MASSIVE SPOILER). Upon its release in 1979, Voiceprint held a contest inviting fans to guess how many jars Sinfield filled with ejaculate while writing the story. The winner received a drawing of a naked bunny rabbit woman.\n\nEno fans, stay away. Even *you* will hate this one. I only gave it a 3 due to (a) some Monty Python-esque dry humor at the beginning, and (b) the sheer unexpectedness of the surprise ending I just ruined for you. Also, at the end of The Sixth Sense, it turns out the kid was just lying the whole time.\n\nEND OF REVIEW\n\nBEGINNING OF SAD PART\n\nMy beloved son Henry The Dog was diagnosed with cancer yesterday. He has an enormous tumor in his chest cavity, and most likely does not have long to live. I am not going to put him through the torture of chemotherapy or surgery at his advanced age (he's almost 11, which is pretty old for an 85-pound dog), so all I can do is try to keep him spoiled and happy until the cancer starts to hurt. When he lets me know he's in too much pain to go on, I'll take him to the vet and end his suffering. I love him.\n\nI will never forget that day in November 2000 when my then-fiancee called me at my then-job and asked if we could get a puppy. Our plan had been to wait until we were married so that our puppy wouldn't be born a bastard and a son of a bitch, but she sounded so excited that I couldn't say no. I picked out a week in December to take off work for Puppy Duty, and we scheduled a Doggy Hunting Date for Saturday, December 9th.\n\nNeither of us could get to sleep on the evening of December 8th because we were so excited about bringing a little puppy into our lives. When morning arrived, we walked up to the Upper East Side Center for Animal Care & Control (CACC), where we found nothing but pit bulls and older dogs. Nothing against either, but I wanted to raise a dog from puppyhood, and didn't feel comfortable starting out with a pit bull. As such, we took an hour-long train ride out to the CACC in Brooklyn. They had plenty of puppies! After playing with several, we picked one that we were pretty sure about. However, I decided to take one more quick look into all the cages just to make sure we hadn't missed any. It was then that I noticed, snug asleep in the back of a cage, the future Mr. Henry The Dog.\n\n\"Wow, that is a sharp-looking dog!\" I exclaimed as I opened the door and pulled him out. He slowly awoke and looked at us with half interest. Brenda agreed that he was quite the cutie. Here's a photo, for proof of this claim:\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMy fiancee had brought along a \"Puppy Aptitude Test\" to make sure our chosen pet wasn't deaf, retarded or a dumbass. Henry failed every question, but he was so darned cute we adopted him anyway. Then we brought him home and he had diarrhea under the Christmas Tree; oh the good times.\n\nWhen my wife left me in May 2010, Henry was pretty much the only thing that kept me sane. No matter how out of control I got, I knew I had to be around to take care of him. And he was great company during what otherwise would've been an unbearably lonely time. I mean, he didn't say much, but he liked to snuggle and take walks with me and stuff. I was also amazed at how quickly he adapted to our new apartment in Astoria. As he'd only known one home in all his ten years, I was afraid he'd freak out and howl like crazy whenever I left the house, but he understood immediately. I guess it helped that all our stuff was in the new apartment!\n\nI'll close this \"Trip Down Memory Road\" with a few things you may not know about Henry:\n\n- He has developed a bad habit of biting through garbage bags on the side of the road, trying to get to the food waste within. I constantly have to yank on his leash to get his head out of a bag, and more than once I've discovered bits of trash bag in his poopy.\n\n- He's very gentle. He likes people a lot, as well as most dogs. Puppies have a bit too much energy for him at this point, but he doesn't start fights or anything.\n\n- Although he certainly bit the hell out of me back when he was a teething puppy, the only time he ever bit a person during his adult years was once when he was doped up on sedatives after a veterinary procedure. A home contractor was walking through our living room when Henry suddenly lurched awake, trotted dizzily across the room and bit him on the thigh. Thankfully the contractor didn't sue! He did, however, stop showing up shortly thereafter, even though the work wasn't finished. No big deal though, as he also left a really nice jacket behind, which I've now worn for years!\n\n- He loves to chew the eyes and noses off of stuffed animals. He has probably destroyed over a thousand stuffed animals in his near-eleven years on this Earth.\n\n- He has a great sense of direction. On several occasions over the years, he has led me directly to a doggy friend's apartment, pet store or swimming hole when I had no idea where the Hell we were going -- usually after only having visited the destination once or twice before.\n\n- He gets very, very nervous at the vet. I'm not sure why, since he doesn't even seem to notice when they give him a shot or take blood. Maybe he just smells the sickness and death in the air?\n\n- He sometimes misunderstands spoken words and gets really excited seemingly out of the blue, as I struggle to figure out what he thought he heard. In the past, this has occurred with words such as \"Mexico\" (which he heard as \"Petco\"), \"Scrabble\" (which he mistook for \"Kibble\") and \"rawhide\" (which he heard correctly, but it was actually my then-wife singing \"Rawhide\").\n\n- He's extremely scared of thunderstorms, to the point that he freaks out if he even hears me say the word \"rain.\"\n\n- Whenever I shout a curse word, he walks over to give me a kiss as reassurance that everything's okay.\n\n- He's the best dog in the world.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Ambient 2: Plateaux Of Mirror (with Harold Budd)  EG 1980\n\nHarold Budd is a gentle man with a piano made of feathers. His supple, birdlike hands touch the velvety keys with a grace and subtlety unknown to such hamfisted mediocrities as Joel Billy and John Elton. By partnering with electronics supervisor Brian Eno, he helped bring forth into this, the world, 40 minutes of the most delectably teasing piano motifs since -\n\nOh hang on, it's starting to blow.\n\n(*20 minutes later*)\n\nHmm. I guess it's okay.\n\n(*28 days later*)\n\nAHH! ZOMBIES!\n\n(*escapes zombies, listens to album*)\n\nAh yes, Harold Pudd. He's no Fuddy-Dudd, that Harold Pudd! This ambient disc is actually more of a melodic album than an ambient experience, featuring 10 tracks of lily-tender sustained piano motifs (half-melodies) backed by Eno's synthesizer wash. And by \"synthesizer wash,\" I of course mean that Brian would plug in his huge electronic keyboard and jump into the bathtub with it. If you ever want to be as brilliant as he is, I suggest you do the same and NOW. (post-haste).\n\nIf you want your home to feel a certain way for four minutes at a stretch, this CD is the one for you. There is no unifying theme to the music, which veers nearly unpleasantly between implausible splendor, soap opera soundtrack melodrama, smoky bar depression, Pink Floyd innerspace melancholia, Bacharach-style hotcha! and dentists' office new wave meditation yuppie humiliation. Considering how easy it is to find five piano notes that sound good together, it's a bit disappointing that Hairy Pud only scores miners' gold about 60% of the time. Still, that 60% of the time, you'll be ambienting your ASS off! DANCE, DANCE, DANCE to that AMBIENT RHYTHMLESS SOUND of Harold R. \"Budd\" Dwyer!\n\nIn finale, each of these tracks WILL effectively transform your listening environment into a (a) field of stunning yellow love flowers, (b) 1940's saloon lounge of drunks and barflys, (c) General Hospital soundstage, (d) opium den with David Gilmour or (e) proctologist's waiting area. But the true question is::: is that what you want? What you really really want? Will you tell me what you want? What you really really want? You wanna huh? Wanna huh? Wanna huh? Wanna huh? Do you really really really wanna zigga zigga - UH?\n\nIf so, yuck! Aren't they all pregnant except for the one with the eating disorder? I don't want some embryo grabbin' my skin pecker!\n\nChrist, I really do make a lot of penis jokes, don't I?\n\nThat's the sign of a strong writer!\n\nAnd by \"writer,\" I of course mean \"flesh-colored instrument that writes in sticky pearl-colored ink on wet, pink surfaces.\"\n\nAdd your thoughts? Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics (with John Hassell) - EG 1980\n\nI've been all around this great big wide open world, but let's not kid ourselves:I'm not exactly \"Bill Trumpet\" if you know what I mean. So here's Bill Trumpet to tell you about this album.\n\nHi, I'm Bill Trumpet! BRAPP BAPP BOOPY DOO!\n\nBest,\n\nBill Trumpet\n\nVice President, Trumpet Division\n\nTrumpet Industries\n\nA Subsidiary of Trumpet & Trumpet, Inc.\n\nThis review so far is fantastic. Let's keep this level of high quality going.\n\nLittle over a year ago, I was married to my life partner of 15 years and living in a big apartment on the upper east side of Manhattan -- depressed due to unemployment, but otherwise sure of my standing in life. Now I'm dating a completely different woman and living in a tiny apartment in Astoria, Queens - still unemployed, but working temp jobs here and there and thinking about entering the education field. Life has changed. Dramatically. Up until Cinco de Mayo 2010, my life had followed a set and steady course. Now the future is a gigantic Oyster filled with Mystery. There's an important message here for you young people: life is never set in stone. If you have a good job, you can't expect your luck to last forever. When you get married, you can't assume that your spouse will want to stay with you for life. Honestly you don't even know if you're going to wake up tomorrow -- let alone free of cancer. It's a depressing message, but one you need to learn, if only so you don't freak out as badly as I did when everything went to Hell last year. Luckily, things eventually went back to Heaven, with God and Jesus.\n\nPossible Musics is pretty amazing, and let me tell you why: I listened to it the first time a few months ago and came out of the experience thinking, \"Yuck, it's just a bunch of weird and wiggly synthesizer tones!\" Then I listened to it a second time a few nights ago and wrote down notes like \"Tugboot synth hooting,\" \"The synths sound really dumb, like munchkins talking through a vocoder,\" \"Goofy synth 'LAA LA LAAAAAA's,\" \"synth making horse whinnying and bird chirping noises\" and \"woogly synthesizer tones woogling and wiggling around like a Zappa guitar solo.\" I am no fan of stupid synth noises for the sake of stupid synth noises, so my attitude was streets behind, as you can imagine. But then I looked up the album on Wikipedia.\n\nTHOSE AREN'T SYNTHESIZERS.\n\nEno and Hassell have somehow run the latter's trumpet through so many different effects processors that it winds up sounding nothing like any brass instrument you've ever imagined (unless you've imagined a brass synth, in which case KNOCK IT OFF). Its bizarre tones range from the hypnotic to the ugly-as-dirt, while resolutely sounding nothing at all like a trumpet. Apparently what Hassell is attempting to do is perform Indian classical music through treated trumpets atop World Beat percussion. In practice, this means a bunch of unrecognizable sounds sliding portamento up and down the scale (reminiscent of The Residents' '70s work), atop light keyboard washes, tape loops and conga beats. At its best, this results in wonderfully odd soundscapes of KrAzEe-Trumpet, oceanic ambience and rhythmic groove. At its worst, it's a bunch of gross squoogly vomitous puke throw up barf.\n\nFans of jazz and ambient music are much more likely to enjoy this than me. I greatly prefer rock music, due to the massive amounts of testosterone running through my body. See how bald I am? That's due to the manly testosterone coursing manlike through my manly manhood. In fact, here's a little song about how manly I am:\n\nHOW MANLY I AM\n\nby \"Manly Mark\" Prindle \"The Man\"\n\nAdam's apple, yeah yeah yeah\n\nI've got an Adam's apple, yeah yeah yeah\n\nI also have a ballsac, yeah yeah yeah\n\nHanging right above my Adam's apple, yeah yeah yeah\n\nI'm an attractive man with testicles on my chin, yeah yeah yeah\n\nThis morning I cut myself shaving and sperm flew everywhere yeah yeah yeah\n\nAlso, instead of toes, I have five penises on each foot yeah yeah yeah\n\nIf I were hilarious, I'd call myself a \"Cock-Toe Twin\" yeah yeah yeah\n\nLast month I had a terrible case of Athlete's Penis yeah yeah yeah\n\nAnd I can't play Footsie without getting somebody pregnant yeah yeah yeah\n\n(*tap dance solo*)\n\nThat made my penises hurt yeah yeah yeah\n\nAdd your thoughts? Ambient 3: Day Of Radiance (with Laraaji)  EG 1981\n\nOne could argue that an album written and performed entirely by a man named Laraaji doesn't necessarily belong on a page of compact yet infotastic Brian Eno record reviews. But the day that Mr. Eno decided to give his latest production the subtitle Ambient 3, its fate as an \"Eno\" project was sealed. A modern analogy might be Peter Cetera producing a hot new band called \"Larry's Jockstrap\" and choosing to title their debut LP Chicago XXVIII: Hey! How's It Going? by Larry's Jockstrap. No no - or better yet, here's a better one. It would be like Andrew Maynard Keenan producing a new artist and then titling the album Another Self-Important Piece Of Crap, thus ensuring that the record would INEXTRICABLY be linked to Tool for the rest of mantime!\n\nBut enough about reasons, rules and regulations. Laraaji is a black fellow who -- oh wait, I forgot something. As far as I know, there's no town in England named \"Dadiance.\" However, if there were, and the Kinks' lead singer was born there, he'd be -- get this, you ready? He'd be\n\nLaraaji plays peculiar otherworldly stringed instruments like the hammered dulcimer and the zither and whatnot, creating gloriously beautiful swirls of radiant tones that sound like Heaven filled a piano with holy rats, who are scurrying to and fro, making the strings reverberate with the most miraculous, optimistic plucky noises ever heard - on this world or any other. The first two tracks are a completely different kind of \"ambient\" though -- they're fast, vibrant and filled with bouncy excitement! I think what makes them \"ambient\" is the fact that they're hypnotic; they kinda work around one motif for 19 minutes, bringing in subtle changes here and there, but mostly just celebrating the dance of some far-off foreign land (it kinda reminds me of the Sun City Girls!). The last two tracks ambience though. \"Meditation #1\" is almost PERFECT ambience: Pensive, harplike and consoling, like a mystical psychedelic journey with the breeze blowing gently through the chimes on the terrace. Its follow-up is a little random and directionless, but maybe you're supposed to be asleep by then, resting your pretty little head on the feathers of another hard-earned day.\n\nSo you see, all it takes is a neat stringed instrument for an album to appeal! That's why I'm going to learn one chord on the banjo and record me playing it for 74 minutes. Then I'll call it Ambient 5: Day Of Banjos and watch the money roll all over town!\n\nAdd your thoughts? My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts (with David Byrne)  Sire 1982\n\nOh holy shits, I just had one hellama idea for a new situation comedy for the television. Picture this: Moonlighting-meets-The Jeffersons -- the year is 2005, George W. has been assassinated and Dick Cheney owns a bakery in Hollywood. But get this - the KICKER - George W.'s ghost hangs around the bakery, getting Dick in all sorts of crazy shenanigans!!! I may just be dreaming Dixie, but My Life With The Ghost Of Bush (Starring David Byrne) could be exACTly what the Empty-Vee Degeneration is after!\n\nThe Talking Heads are an anomaly in my record collection. Like the Police and Bruce Springsteen, they are a band to whom I gave high marks here on the old web site and who I'm fairly certain I enjoy and respect wholeheartedly as artists and dreamers, yet I never, ever, I mean EVER get the urge to listen to them. The music is well done and intricate, but it's just not ever what I'm in the mood to hear. Therefore, it's not the biggest surprise in the city that My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts doesn't get a whole lot of airplay on WPRI-FM, KNDL-AM, or E-TV. It essentially foreshadows the direction that Eno and Byrne went on Remain In Light and Fear Of Music, combining rich world beat African tribal rhythms with a sort of humiliating Caucasian funk music. Except that HERE, on THIS album, instead of David's nerdy and paranoid yet charming and idiosyncratic voice wowing the crowd as Tina Weymouth takes a crap on her bass and lets it slide off onto the people in the front row, Eno and Byrne use samples as vocals and 500 thousand guest musicians as a rhythm section. Strange names like \"Bill Laswell\" and \"Busta Jones\" may not mean anything to you and the other unwashed masses, but to an underground music connoisseur and educator such as myself who spends every waking moment digging out the latest and greatest of the avant-garde music scene, these names are synonymous with \"the guy who produced Brain Drain\" and \"the guy who wrote the music for 'Chasing The Night.'\" And that's your lesson for the day, newbie.\n\nThe nicest thing about this record, and the part that you will appreciate most I'd wager, is the fact that (a) most of the beats are incredible -- your ass will be dancing til your feet show up!, and (b) Ego/Burn wrap each track in a literal envelope of samples, strange noises and instrumental patterns (piano/organ/guitar/bass) that seem to constantly walk all over each other. Most of the songs only have one part, but they pour on so many odd instrumental sounds (bodhran, bata, sticks, can, congas, agong-gong, metals, click bass, found objects, rooks) that even Mick Jagger would find himself singing, \"I know it's not really rock and roll -- but I like it!\"\n\n(*hires Canadian Mafia to kick own ass*)\n\nERERFaaaa -- what I MEANT was that even Mick Jagger would find himself singing, \"You make a dead man come (in my mouth, and by 'dead man,' I of course mean 'David Bowie and/or Pete Townshend').\"\n\n(*gives self five*)\n\n(*up high*)\n\n(*down low*)\n\n(*is too slow*)\n\nGetting back to the negatives, where all reviews belong, it couldn't have taken Bino and Urn more than four minutes to write every single \"melody\" on this record. There's almost nothing to any of them, especially the depressing funk songs, which are driven by the most outdated '80s \"bwow!\" wah-wah funk bass/synth effects this side of probably something Peter Gabriel has been involved with I'd imagine. And see, that's the problem with most pop artists who try to work world music into their sound: by the time the idea occurs to them, they're already old, stodgy and so far out of touch with good music that they think glossy studio production with the latest technology (i.e. that which will sound out-of-date in six months) is an appropriate way to sweeten the sweaty soulful sounds of Nigeria. But it's NOT and it sounds OLD, WEARY and STUPID. You have to be young, in touch with the dirt and far away from luxury to merge the two successfully: thus, I present to you The Sun City Girls!!!!!\n\nThis isn't a Paul Simon review though. Eno and Byrne were still somewhat young when they recorded this work, so it's only like 1/4 lame. Any fan of mid-period Heads will be totally into it for the expansive beats and keen racket alone. And I didn't even mention the sampled vocalists! Why, there's an indignant radio host here, an inflamed caller there, a Lebanese mountain singer under that rock, a New Orleans reverend hiding behind the couch, an exorcist showing at theaters near you, Algerian Muslims shouting the Qu'ran before flying planes into a building, the Moving Star Hall Singers moving things around the stars and the hall as they sing, and even an Egyptian popular singer! Who knew that Egypt had any popular singers besides Steve Martin of \"King Tut\" fame?\n\nTo conclose: At its best, The Bush Of Wads And Ghosts is rhythmtastically noisecellent, but at its worst, it's not at all drumeriffically racketerrific. In fact, you might say that at its worst, it's downright \"funked up!\"\n\n(*murders self, shits in self's mouth, brings self back to life, makes fun of feces-retching self while masturbating into self's underwear drawer*)\n\nReader Comments\n\nvincerizzosr@earthlink.net\n\nthat bit about laswell and jones re; avantgarde music was Hilarious....fucking Brain Drain......ha\n\nrobchaundy@yahoo.com\n\nI bought and listened to this on the strength of its repeated comparisons with Peter Gabriel's magisterial 'Passion' album. I quickly concluded that whoever made these comparisons was an incorrigible fool; where the latter is beautiful, melodic, ecstatic and fantastically powerful, the former is a crabbed, hampered one-trick pony of a record which does the same repeated sample/rhythmic hook thing on each and every track, none of which differentiates itself significantly from any other.\n\nI know it's unfair to judge it against such a demanding benchmark as 'Passion', but that's the fault of the record-reviewing community at large, it isn't my doing. When all is said and done 'Bush' isn't an uninteresting record and doubtless an important landmark in the careers of both Eno and Byrne, but I strongly object to its being considered the classic it's often considered to be. A diverting footnote, nothing more.\n\nmikaal1@bigpond.com\n\nThought i'd write a little about the exclusion of the track \"Q'raan\" on later issues of this album.\n\nApparently Brian and his record company received hostile warnings from Muslim representatives at the time (long long long before 9/11) to remove this track as it contained passages from The Koran and they were mighty upset about this.\n\nCan be downloaded....hee hee...Go WWW!!!\n\nAdd your thoughts? Ambient 4: On Land - EG 1982\n\nLet's sing a little bit before we start the review. \"It's not unusual! To be loved by anyone. Da da da da da It's not unusual! To have fun with anyone... Da da da dee.... Put another nickle in! In the nickelodeon! All I want is loving you and music music music!.... I've paid my dues - blink bink bink ba ba - Time after time - blink bink bink ba ba - I've done my sentence - Chicago! Chicago! That toddlin' town, that toddlin' town. Chicago! Chicago! Let me show you around, let me show you around - Shine sweet freedom. Shine right on me. Go keep the spirit alive! All night long! -- 'Cause he was born! Born to be alive! (Born to be alive) Yes, he was born! Born! Born! DOOOOOZHHH!!!! (Born to be alive). Alright, I'm all songed out, let's review an album with no songs on it.\n\nBrian Eno has spent more time on land than most people have spent underwater, so it's a little disappointing to hear that he's come to associate it with fake jungle noises and embarrassing synthesizer attempts to recreate world music clichés. Parts of it work -- in particular the heavier-than-an-anvil rumbling that drives the first two druggy Pink Floydy hums \"Lizard Point\" and \"The Lost Day.\" These two tracks roll along oppressively like gallons of lava down the side of an active mountain, occasionally revealing bits of peeping, cawing and even some violins and keyboard notes as the river of fiery death envelopes the forest and local operahouse.\n\nThe rest of the album unfortunately doesn't live up to the media hype generated by these two \"like nothing you've ever heard unless you've been buried alive in an avalanche\" soundscapes. Too often, Mr. Eno ruins his perfectly valid electronic landscape paintings with out-of-date technology blurps -- everything from beautiful but out-of-place rays of sunny organ melody to unnecessary Pete Townshendy fuzz-brapple experimentation (a la \"Eminence Front\") to diarrheaingly bad wiggly bendy fake Indian crap. The hypnotizing tones and drones by themselves are exceedingly evocative, because you can't figure out how the hell they were created: they SOUND like tectonic plates ripping apart into separate continents! But then the sampled animal pips and fake third world instruments bring you right back to reality: this is some guy pushing buttons in a studio.\n\nStudio Line from L'Oreal, that is! Studio - Studio - Studio Line from L'Oreal! Sculpt your hair -- any way you like it! Ahh yeah, can I get a shout-out for that awesome Sun Ra song \"Space Is The Place (With the Helpful Hardware Man)?\"\n\nAlso, just for the record, I do apologize for constantly singing Paul McCartney's \"Silly Love Songs\" as \"Some people wanna fill the world with smelly ballsacs.\" At very least, it makes more sense than my just-plain-bizarre rewrite of ELO's \"Don't Bring Me Down\" as \"I'll tell you once more before I jam things up my ass - Don't grab my butt!\"\n\nReader Comments\n\nslb23@shaw.ca\n\nLooking at reviews on the net of this record, I seem to be one of the few Eno fans who does not like this album. As well, lots of critics call this (one of) his best ambient albums (along with Ambient 1).\n\n\"Frankly, Mr. Shankly\" (to quote a Smiths song) I think that these 'songs' are boring. Seems to me this is the recipe:\n\n- - - synth drone or two playing 1 or 2 notes for minutes on end.\n\n- - - layer on 'nature' sound effects.\n\n- - - add sporadically throughout album a few trumpet and guitar notes here and there.\n\nOverall I much prefer Ambient 1 or even Discreet Music to this album.\n\nwarehouse@trafficent.com (Chris Jimson)\n\nIt took me a while to \"get\" this album, but once I had, I was sold. It reminds me of my childhood (\"awwwwww. . . \"), the drone of the highway off in the distance, surrounded by crickets and tree frogs, cool night air, somnolence. If you are bored, don't give up, eventually you'll get it. Put it on some day when you're exhausted and dont have the energy to listen, put it on quietly, imperceptibley, don't pay attention.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Apollo: Atmospheres And Soundtracks (with Daniel Lanois & Roger Eno)  EG 1983\n\nWouldn't it be crazy to float through space? Can you imagine the giddy sensation of flying through the universe, sitting on a crazyass tilted ball that twists around and around while circling the sun at 67,000 miles an hour? Unfortunately, most of us will never live this dream and will wither away our sad days stuck here on the desolate flat bottom of the world as space taunts us just overhead. Curses on you, you fucking gravity asshole!\n\nWell, one man wasn't content with his lot in life, and this man decided to build a wonderful spaceship in which he could fly away with his little dog to worlds yet unknown, pioneering the field of alien-human communication and founding a new outer space landfill. Unfortunately, this man was bald and had no schooling, so instead he recorded an album designed to recreate the sensation that a smarter, more covered with hair man might experience while tunneling through the cosmos at the speed of light speed (45 miles an hour). That album is Apollo and that man is none other than Ian Boner.\n\nWithout warning, Eno does a spectacular job of emulating the cold, dense, empty, unfeeling vacuum of space on this album (especially the first two tracks and final epic), establishing a low one-note rumbling drone that he then augments with space shuttle beeps, frightening whale-like martian noises, the occasional peaceful hum and..... ahhh.... a steel guitar. And this is where the concept falls apart a little bit. After five or six tracks of pure drone (or near-drone), suddenly Eno hops out of his spaceship to join a boring house band. What in the world slow country ballads and romantic pop compositions have to do with space is never explained, leaving the listener wondering if Eno perhaps just slammed two EPs together so he could release something. It's no secret that Eno has always been in it for the green - he sold out the minute he recorded his first 35-minute song with two notes, and has been churning out the same MTV-ready lowest common denominator horseshit ever since. But who am I to assume I understand the deepest inner workings of America's finest British composer? After all, when you \"assume,\" you make a \"sum\" out of \"as\" and \"e.\" (for example, \"as\" + \"e\" = \"ase\").\n\nGetting back to the program, my description of Apollo Warehouse: Songs And Stories reads as follows: some heartless, brilliant, frightening murmurs followed by a few straightforward instrumentals with bass and steel guitar (a couple of which are actually pretty good, but again... why are they on this record?) and ending with perhaps the finest sluice of arctic poisonous martian-infested air on the whole record - the 8-minute \"Stars.\" So enjoy this wonderful journey through space and country-western balladry that Messrs Eno, Eno and Lanois have created, but take care, young interstellar traveller. And never forget the foreboding words of the ad campaign for that first Alien movie: \"In space, nobody can find The Scream.\"\n\nHa! Little topical Munch humor for you there. Hopefully the police won't have already found the painting by the time you read this, because then the joke would be \"out-of-date\" and not \"topical\" at all! No \"Ha!\"s, no nothing! Nothing but tears and me in jail with an enlarged anus hole.\n\nReader Comments\n\nebalzer@HADASSAH.org (Eric Balzer)\n\nOne clever reviewer sumed this one up thus:\n\n\"Eno and the Moon were made for each other.\"\n\nDerek Zender\n\nBrian Eno actually explained the whole country music aspect of this album in a 1990 interview with Mark Pendergast in Sound on Sound magazine:\n\n\".....but what I find impressive about that music is that its very concerned with space in a funny way. Its sound is the sound of a mythical space, the mythical American frontier space that doesnt really exist anymore. Thats why on Apollo I thought it very appropriate, because its very much like space music  it has all the connotations of pioneering, of the American myth of the brave individual, and that myth has strong resonances throughout American culture.\"\n\nAdd your thoughts?

I don't remember seeing your name on any of the gifts, but we all have our own ways of showing appreciation for those who work hard to regularly provide us with arguably entertaining record reviews for over nine years. Perhaps you feel that completely ignoring somebody is the sincerest form of flattery. Or perhaps you spent all your money on marriage enhancers to make up for your miniscule penis and premature ejaculation issue. Either way, please accept my sincerest thanks for nothing.\n\nOn to the work at hand. When Herman Melville wrote Harold Budd, he never thought that this simple tale of a mistreated sailor would someday capture the imagination of British record producer Brian Eno, but we can't know everything in life and this is just the proof I needed to demonstrate that fact to you. Score one for Ol' Prind!\n\nLike Eno's first collaboration with his Buddy Harold, this CD presents Budd playing his piano with incredibly supple grace, softness and subtlety as Eno adds warm hypnotic hums and whooshy electronic ambiance. The difference is that, where Plateaux Of Mirror had no unifying theme, this one features eleven tracks of similar tone, feel and melodic intent -- that of Autumnal solitude, melancholy and trepidation. It conjures up post-Summer days at dusk, with the chilly breeze, setting sun and red/gold/brown leaves wringing up long-forgotten feelings of loneliness and fear for the future. Some of the tracks are actual piano melodies; others are just brief ambient note runs repeated at an inanimate object's pace for six minutes. Either way, the piano tones are so beautifully softened with prodigious reverb, delay and Budd's naturally light touch that you'll feel like you're drifting away on a cotton cloud wrapped in a blanket of marshmallows.\n\nThat's because when you weren't looking, I wrapped you in a blanket of marshmallows and threw you off a cliff! HA HA HA!!!! FUCK YOU, ROADRUNNER!!!\n\nDon't listen to it in the dark though - it may SOUND beautiful, but don't get too close or the augural hooks will rip your brain in two with scaredyness. Baleful? Shit, man. You ever got your nuts stuck on a chalkboard? These hooks are as lowering as THAT. Picture a giant malefic squirrel with a dick full of string beans. I mean, these minatory melodies will have your ass clenched so tight only a member of Styx could squeak through. Talk about unpropitious!\n\nAdd your thoughts? Thursday Afternoon  EG 1985\n\nI do have certain issues with ambient music. My main concern is Eno's supposed belief (I've never met the guy, so all of my facts about him are about 50th-hand, assuming that if you add up all the people in the world, then there will be a total of at least 50 hands - otherwise why go on? Why bother trying to live day-by-day pretending everything's fine when the truth is that the entire human race only has 245 fingers -- IF THAT???) that ambient music is meant to be akin to a visual artwork in a room: it's there, you don't really notice it but it adds a bit of culture and you can observe it more closely if the mood suits you.\n\nThis is where his theory breaks down for me. It's easy to ignore a painting; just turn your back. It sits quietly in the corner, perhaps drinking a cup of tea. But music never shuts up. Music rattles on and on and on no matter where you go. Engage in conversation, read a beverage, smell a cigar -- it's STILL THERE. And in the case of \"Thursday Afternoon\" (unfortunately not the long-awaited sequel that all of us Moody Blues fans were hoping for), it's about five spongy electric piano notes played in various orders but no real melody -- for SIXTY-ONE MINUTES. And sure, Sixty-One Minutes is an excellent television series, but they're all getting pretty old and baggy, aren't they? And what's with Harry Reasoner's fucking eyebrows? What, did he cut swatches from his rug and just glue 'em up there?\n\nBut we're discussing a record album. One entitled Thursday Afternoon, in fact. For the first few minutes, the five or so alternating notes are striking, unforgettable, superb, saintly, placid, relaxing, just as they were intended to be. And then you can sorta let it zone out as you go about your business, wiping the baby's diaper on your wife or whatever, but around the 20 minute mark, there is NO WAY that you can sit still and not think to yourself, \"Say! He's still playing the same notes!\"\n\nAround 35 minutes, anger sets in and things start getting thrown. Not by you necessarily, and perhaps only on the TV by men in football uniforms, but the throwing is nevertheless taking place SOMEWHERE in the world, so just as a butterfly's wings cause a hurricane on the other side of the globe, Brian Eno is affecting the outcome of sports events by recording boring go-nowhere half-assed shit music for old people.\n\nBy minute 50, you can concentrate on NOTHING IN THE WORLD outside of that motherfucking cocksucking repetitive asshole electric piano playing its mindless, ball-numbing five-note melody over and over and over and over and over and over as if people don't have feelings and should be expected to sit still and let drops of water slowly drip, drip, drip on their foreheads for 61 minutes at a time.\n\nIf you actually make it through all 61 minutes, the telephone rings and a voice tells you that you're going to die in 7 days.\n\nYOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO HELP ENO!!!!! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND???? HE NEVER SLEEPS!!!!!\n\nReader Comments\n\nwatta502@yahoo.gr (Akis Katsman)\n\nThis album is kind of pretty and relaxing but it sure doesn't have to be 61 minutes. In my opinion, it should have been released as a 10-minute EP so if you wanted to hear the same exact thing for much more time, you could simply press the 'repeat' button on your hi-fi to keep it going. That would be a nice idea, wouldn't be?\n\ndaniel.gileppa@jcu.edu.au\n\nHe wrote it for a movie (which itself was a series of paintings or something), so I'm guessing it had to be 61 minutes. Also, it was exclusively written for compact disc, and he was having some sort of a wank about not being able to have an uninterrupted 61-minute track on any other medium.\n\nabdul_tom@yahoo.co.uk\n\nBeing a John Ford style morally ambiguous but utterly independent rebel, this is crazily my favourite Eno album - I think it's bordering on genius. See, all that hog in the sleevenotes about it being like a painting in that it can repay closer examination, is, like, true.\n\nThe piece never repeats itself, a bit like Autechre's Anti-EP. The said piano notes coagulate in a different way each time, and the background drones and harmonies develop constantly, with dischords and harmonics and all sorts of exciting shitty.\n\nI used to write essays to this about 50 years ago and it would make me speed up and slow down, chill down happy or get uptight. That's the throwing bit right there, the uptight bit - there's actually these virtually subaural high things happening in the background and that why there's throwing. It's really clever, see? Really detailed, too. Clever record. Clever.\n\nNow go review some John Cale albums. Start with Slow Dazzle.\n\ncmsienko@yahoo.com (Chris)\n\nWas just perusing your reviews again, and saw your one-star review of Brian Eno's \"Thursday Afternoon.\" Gave me a good chuckle!\n\nYou may be interested to note that this, ahem, \"song\" was used as a weapon against my girlfriend and I! A rather nefarious jukebox programmer held an entire bar hostage for one hour with this damn song! The harrowing story was printed in a Sunday edition of the New York Times, but now you can only read it if you're one of the hoity-toity paying members! However, the \"More Dark Than Shark\" Eno fansite (or is this the artist's own site?) still has it. Thought you might get a kick out of it:\n\nhttp://www.moredarkthanshark.org/index.html?eno_int_nyt-jun06.html~frameHOME\n\nAdd your thoughts? Wrong Way Up (with John Cale) Opal 1990\n\nOh, how the stars were in Shakespearean alignment on that special night when haughty intelligent genius John Cale met up with theoretical high-minded experimentalist Brian Eno. Anyone viewing the magical moment when these two shining brilliant forces of brainpower put palm to palm outside a Westchester Denny's would no doubt have witnessed gallon upon gallon of a strange, liquidy, lumpy fluid pour out of each man's ears and onto the parking lot.\n\nI actually like the idea of musicians writing songs for little children to enjoy with their excitable, underdeveloped minds, but I'm unfortunately almost positive that this was not at all Eno and Cale's intention with Wrong Way Up. Their goal appears to have been to set aside mature artistic provocation for once in their lives in order to cut loose with a happy little pop record. However, between the simpleton \"New Monkees\"-style two-chord melodies of obviousness, 80s cornball synth-and-lame-funk-guitar arrangements, and soulless, spot-free production, the end result is a record that isn't so much \"mindless\" as \"braindead.\"\n\nIf you've ever heard The Moody Blues' The Other Side Of Life or Phil Collins' later, completely synthetic material, you probably have a pretty good picture of what this album sounds like: a bunch of A-E idiotic sugary bunkum and minor-key forays into detached exoticism that will leave you wondering how you missed the theatrical release of Walt Disney's Wrong Way Up. Even more depressingly, it plants the brainseed that perhaps Eno actually gave up pop/rock for ambience not out of artistic curiosity, but because he had completely forgotten how to write an original melody. Either way, one thing's for certain: I probably shouldn't have told my wife that I'd like to nail those two girls in our Tae Kwon Do class.\n\nOn a related note, I probably shouldn't have posted on the Internet that I'd like to nail those two girls in our Tae Kwon Do class.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Nerve Net  Opal 1992\n\nSterno Log truly 'ARRIVED' in '92, hopping aboard the Youth House Music Train with his action-packed sweaty dance pounder \"Fractal Zoom,\" which begins this CD on an imposingly up-to-date tone that will have you turning your cap backwards, wearing really big pants, and announcing \"Yeah, THAT'S what I'm talkin' about!\" even though you weren't actually talking about anything at all.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the material that follows can be summed up and immediately dismissed as \"lots of slow, piddly electronic beats with looped samples, unpleasant synth noises and guitar/sax solos spread artlessly across the top like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich made by a one-fingered man.\" Alternately, one could obnoxiously and closed-mindedly yet entirely correctly refer to it as \"Ugly Tones Playing Ugly Music\" (or \"U.P.C.H.U.K.\")(roughly).\n\nIt's mostly instrumental, electronic and science fictiony with hardly a melody to be found between the gross noisy solos, which actually makes a sacka loada sense since it co-stars infamous lead guitarists Bobby Quine and Bobby Fripp (along with former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Georgenringo Jones). There ARE a few decent Zappa-y, unorthodox and/or unpredictable tracks on here (adorable jazzy speed-rap \"Ali Click,\" suspenseful fuzzfest \"Web,\" disorienting piano solo \"Decentre\"), but not enough to wash the taste of all the other sub-Barnes & Barnes devoized brapps and froops out of the listener's already piss-filled mouth (from drinking piss at a San Francisco Piss Club).\n\nYes, Brian Eno truly 'ARRIVED' in '92, alright. And by 'ARRIVED,' I mean 'ARRIVEDERCI!'\n\nRemember that old cartoon \"I Hanker For A Hunk O' Cheese\"? What the hell was that yellow thing that was singing the song? Was it a big piece of cheese? That was going around eating other cheese? I think it was. I think it was indeed a big piece of cheese with a cowboy hat on, going around eating other, smaller pieces of cheese that it had drugged, sexually abused and murdered in its apartment. And what about that dazed, bloody Thai cheese that ran to the cops, only to have them re-release it to its certain doom when the big piece of cheese with the cowboy hat on claimed it was just a gay lovers' AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTT.\n\nSorry about that, I fell off the enormous mountain of hilarity I'd built.\n\nReader Comments\n\npedroandino@msn.com\n\ngood to see you reviewing brian eno. how come there are not many comments on mr.avantgarde man? anyway the oscars suck cock!
