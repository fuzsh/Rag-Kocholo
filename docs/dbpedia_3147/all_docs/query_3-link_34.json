If the 6CD set had continued on the same, then the later music would\n\nThis isn't too non-ambient. As mentioned above there are a variety of styles here. It's the guitar that makes certain tracks stand out. And the more ambient/simple tracks such as 'World Without Wind' or the tracks with wandering presumably generative melodies such as 'Light Legs' work better because they have something to contrast with. As opposed to The Drop where there is - to my ears - too much of that. 'Light Legs' also has the simple counter-melody (not quite a bassline) for the wandering melody to contrast against and works better to my ears that some other generative pieces.\n\nThe guitar work is quite conventional, e.g. on 'New Moons'. This then contrasts well with the (presumably) synthesisers creating, yet again, contrast.\n\nWhere there are percussion loops, these are often very minimalist such as on 'Vanadium'. This gives this disc a common feel, and makes the tracks different from the other music in the box set without making it too different. Again 'Vanadium' has a wandering generative melody, but this is really part of the backing track to a very simple melody, not the focus of the track.\n\nOverall a varied and interesting album, and certainly the people who bought this at the installations would not have been short-changed in my opinion.\n\nThanks for the discussion everybody. Today we finish the Music for Installations box set with the last disc Music for Future Installations.\n\nThis hasn't (that I know of) been released as a standalone disc, and hence there is a limited amount of material to put in this post. So, today sort of sums up the box set in some ways.\n\nFor a Discogs link, here is the box set itself: Brian Eno - Music For Installations\n\nSpotify link for whole box set: Music For Installations\n\nNot much on Wikipedia.\n\nTrack listing for disc 6 from Discogs :\n\n6-1 Unnoticed Planet 7:49\n\n6-2 Liquidambar 7:00 (2009)\n\n6-3 Sour Evening (Complex Heaven 3) 8:12 (About 1998)\n\n6-4 Surbahar Sleeping Music 18:09 (About 2012)\n\nHere is part 1 and part 2 of a British Library lecture by Brian, titled 'Brian Eno - Music For Installations – Live At The British Library'. But, it doesn't talk too much about the actual releases and the installations. But, about earlier ambient pieces in the large part.\n\nPart 1:\n\nPart 2:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaheigS9pQo\n\nI presume these are excerpts from a longer lecture which might talk about the current release more.\n\nIn the booklet for Music for Installations, Eno mentions that when he's creating music he often gives himself a reason for doing so, such as making music for a future film that doesn't yet exist, or for a future multi-channel installation. He mentions the age of the pieces (see track listing)\n\n'Sour Evening' is one of a set of pieces where Eno imagines what a complex Heaven with a lot going on. 'Surbahar Sleeping Music' was created to help him go to sleep. The idea dates to the early 80s where Eno would go to sleep in Daniel (and Bob) Lanois' house in Canada soothed to sleep by the sound of water going through pipes etc.\n\nLiquidambar is music composed to support readings of short stories by neuroscientist David Eagleman, at the Sydney Opera House in 2009 and then one year later in Brighton.\n\nHere's an hour of Eagleman talking to Eno in 2021. I haven't listened to it, so I don't know if the music and stories are mentioned.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/B0tdmOPLZBc\n\nAnd, here is a playlist with readings of the stories, but from my quick sampling without Eno's music. (Though, it's easy to play the music and the stories at the same time.)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7Wr1VPtVzqXaggr9ZI9Hmnzlln4obMFF\n\nAnd, ..., that's what I can do for Music for Future Installations.\n\nTomorrow will be a rest/catch-up/anything day.\n\nLooking at the future, and back at the first post, then this is what's in the plan before we get to Another Day on Earth.\n\n43. Smart\n\nNot enough Eno for a day - leave for a rest/catch up/anything day.\n\n44. Music for Onmyo-Ji\n\nOne day as ambient. There's getting on towards two hours of it.\n\n45. Music for Civic Recovery Centre\n\nOne day as ambient.\n\n46. Drawn from Life\n\nOne day. Not really ambient, but instrumental.\n\n47. All Saints\n\nNot enough Eno, leave it for a rest/catch-up day.\n\n48. Compact Forest Proposal\n\nAnother installation ambience piece. One day.\n\n49. Long Now\n\nI suggest we group this in with 'Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now'.\n\n50. Curiosities Volume 1\n\nInstrumental, so one day.\n\n51. January 07003: Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now\n\nIncluding 'Long Now'.\n\nOne day for both. (Can you sense that I'm keen to get to more vocal stuff.)\n\n52. Curiosities Volume 2\n\nInstrumental, so one day.\n\n53. The Equatorial Stars\n\nFripp/Eno. Instrumental, so one day?\n\n54. Another Day on Earth\n\nVocal album. Track by track? Or are we past that and two days?\n\nI don't know what Contra 1-2 is. Brian Eno - Contra 1.2 (Untitled 24:53) I'm not really feeling that it should be added to the list and it can be discussed in a rest/catch-up/anything day. Does anyone have it?\n\nThe thread has definitely slowed down a lot. And, we are not yet past what appears to be the most ambient focussed part of Eno's career even though we will be going back to following things in order.\n\nBefore I post my impressions of yesterday's tracks, I'm going to declare today a rest/catch-up/anything day.\n\nSome releases that won't be covered specifically include Smart. By 'New Composers' with Eno as a 'guest'. Discogs: New Composers Sp. Guest Brian Eno - Smart\n\nIt's on Spotify, and Eno is credited on every track there. But, I can't find out much about it.\n\nSmart\n\nAnd, on Eno's Bandcamp. New Composers Sp. Guest Brian Eno - Smart [Extra wide full range stereo], by New Composers\n\nI sampled bits of side A, and it sounds quite conventional and not at all ambient. Side B sounds more ambient, but I don't know much about this album and just leave it here. According to this description cue-records.com - Brian Eno,New Composers,Smart Eno's input may be small.\n\nThere's the compilation album All Saints by David Bowie. This has instrumental works, including quite a bit from Low. I think we covered the tracks not on the original release of Low back when we did the album. So, there's not much new.\n\nAll Saints (David Bowie album) - Wikipedia\n\nHere it is on Spotify. All Saints\n\nWhile it's out of time, we recently covered the Bryan Ferry album Mamouna. On Ferry's later (2002) album Frantic there is a track with writing credits to both Ferry and Eno, 'I Thought'., and where Eno is credited with keyboards, guitar, and backing vocals. The album includes a wide range of writing credits, including to King Richard I of England.\n\nWikipedia link for album: Frantic (album) - Wikipedia\n\n'I Thought'.\n\nMusic for Future Installations\n\nThere is some interesting music here indeed. 'Unnoticed Planet' is perhaps the most 'ambient' piece here, and follows 'the formula' a bit. By disc six I will say that I like it and I find the tracks on this disc sound better produced than the average for the album.\n\n'Liquidambar' is significantly different, being less conventionally melodic. And, it really works for me. I really like the 'rattling' sound, and the less musical/harmonic drone or chord. I can't really say why I like it, but it just has that 'something' that Eno's best work has. I would really like a full album of less conventionally musical tracks like this. Provided that there was significant contrast.\n\n'Sour Evening' comes back more more traditional ambient, but there's just enough here to make it sound a bit different from what has gone before. Again, it's the way in which this track sounds slightly different. Not a lot different from what has gone before, but enough for it to have its own identity.\n\nThe same applies for 'Surbaha Sleeping Music'. It's ... similar to what has gone before, and the FM Synthesis iciness is here in spades. But, it doesn't sound to me like something I have heard before. And, that's the only quibble I've had with previous pieces in this set.\n\nOverall this disc is a good addition to the other discs, and this final disc is probably the one that I will play most in the future. (I predict that I will never in my whole life play all six discs in one go.) It has interesting, enjoyable, and novel pieces of music, and the selection works very well as an 'album' to my ears.\n\nFor the rest/catch-up day, I will say that I will be buying a number of albums in response to this thread (including I expect in the future as we are past the era when I was most reliably buying Eno product, though I own many albums still to be covered.)\n\nThanks for the discussion everybody. Today we will cover Music for Omnyo-Ji by Brian Eno and German composer J. Peter Schwalm. At least the second of two disks is by Eno and Schwalm. Released in 2000.\n\nWikipedia link: Music for Onmyo-Ji - Wikipedia\n\nDiscogs: Okano Reiko, Yumemakura Baku, Reigakusya, Brian Eno With Peter Schwalm - Music For 陰陽師\n\nHere is the second disc with the music by Eno and Schwalm.\n\nAnd, the first disk with the Japanese gagaku music.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Xq_BEw2FOC8\n\nFrom Wikipedia, here is a description of the album.\n\nMusic for Onmyo-Ji (music for 陰陽師) is a two disc image album for Reiko Okano's manga adaptation of Baku Yumemakura's novel series of the same name. The first disc features performances by gagaku ensemble Reigakusya (伶楽舎), the second features performances by Brian Eno and J. Peter Schwalm.\n\nAnd, here is the track listing.\n\nCD1\n\nSojo no Choshi Bongen - 4:52\n\nShundeika [Togaku Bugaku] - 7:55\n\nOshikicho no Choshi - 2:39\n\nJussuiraku [Togaku Kangen] - 4:45\n\nYoshinso [Biwa Hikyoku] - 3:03\n\nIchikotsucho no Sugagai - 1:38\n\nRyo-o Ranjo [Togaku Bugaku] - 9:03\n\nHyojo no Choshi - 2:51\n\nBairo no Ha [Togaku Bugaku] - 5:42\n\nAsukai [Saibara] - 4:31\n\nBanshikicho no Choshi - 4:58\n\nSoko [Togaku Bugaku] - 14:28\n\nTaishikicho no Choshi - 2:34\n\nChogeishi [Togaku Bugaku] - 2:58\n\nJisei [Roei] - 6:52\n\nCD2\n\nStar Gods - 7:43\n\nSix Small Pictures - 6:08\n\nConnecting Heaven to Earth - 3:55\n\nLittle Lights - 4:33\n\nThe Milky Way - 2:33\n\nFaraway Suns - 3:21\n\nThere are interviews and other media with Schwalm, but they tend to date from the time of the album Drawn From Life, which we will cover soon.\n\nHere's the Wikipedia page on Schwalm, which extensively mentions Eno.\n\nJ. Peter Schwalm - Wikipedia\n\nHere's an excerpt.\n\nIn 1996 Schwalm founded the label Poets Club Records, on which he released a series of 12\" singles, as well as compilations of electronica, nu jazz and drum and bass. His first album with Projekt Slop Shop,Makrodelia, was released on the label in 1998, and caught the attention of a number of significant musicians such as Brian Eno, Peter Kruder and Ryuichi Sakamoto.\n\nAs a result, Eno proposed a collaboration, which resulted, only a few months later, in an appearance together at the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, also featuring Holger Czukay, bass-player Raoul Walton and drummer Jem Atai. Schwalm and Eno continued to work together on a mixture of projects, including two albums, Music for Onmyo-Ji (2000 JVC Victor) and Drawn from Life (2001 Venture/Virgin Music U.K.).\n\nMusic for Omnyo-Ji\n\nWhen Eno works with collaborators, it's always interesting to think about what the input of the collaborator is. Here it's not so clear to me as either composer could have created this - as far as I know. It doesn't sound like just FM synthesis to me, with resonant filters being present (as far as my ear guides me). There are also processed vocals as found on other ambient albums by Eno from about this time.\n\nIn general, the music here just sounds 'different' to the previous set of ambient pieces that we worked through, and perhaps a bit of a throwback to Eno music from before Eno went full on FM (though there are clear FM sounds here like some bells). The tracks aren't too far, musically, from what we've heard before. There is some very subtle percussion, seemingly synthetic, occasionally. There are a number of different tracks which contrast with each other.\n\nIt's perhaps unfair that we're considering these tracks separately from the visual aspects that they are intended for. I.e. the installations, or here the manga these tracks are 'image tracks' for.\n\nIt's interesting that on Wikipedia, the Allmusic.com review is two and a bit stars out of five, while Rolling Stone's album guide gives it five stars out of five. Allmusic.com questions just what Schwalm has added to the music on the second CD. There's nothing I can identify that Eno couldn't have done, but it's a leap from there to credit everything to Eno.\n\nOverall, the Eno/Schwalm side is quality ambient music, but I don't feel it really adds anything distinctive. The first CD of more traditional Japanese music is more distinctive and interesting because I haven't heard so much of that. So, it is novel to my ears. For most of the ambient music, I'm struggling to find something really distinctive about it. Even the last track 'Faraway Suns' which is also my favourite track on the disc isn't too far from what has gone before.\n\nI feel I just want to hear something a bit different from what I've heard so much of recently.\n\nI Thought\n\nThis is a left-over track from the rest/catch-up day. I am amused by this track as it seems to have a 70s Eno 'Cheesy' (in a good way) backing over which Ferry has created a typical (for him) vocal melody and set of lyrics. Definitely a throwback stylistically, but I'm not sure to exactly which 70s Eno vocal album. It's interesting as it shows what could have happened had Eno stayed in Roxy Music in the 70s, and been allowed to contribute to the songwriting in the way that Manzanera and Mackay were. For the age it was released in, it does sound a bit of an anachronistic curio, but a good anachronistic curio.\n\nThanks for the discussion everyone. Today we discuss Music for Civil Recovery Centre, which was composed for an installation at the 'Sonic Boom' exhibition at the Hayward Gallery. Unfortunately the music is an extended version of the track 'Ikeburo' from The Shutov Assembly and which has already been used in Kite Stories. So, we have really covered this already.\n\nI'm going to post this full introductory post to the album. But, since it contains music we've talked about already. I'll also go straight onto Compact Forest Proposal. Which also helps us get quicker to some music that is significantly different from all the ambient installation music of which we have covered a lot. It's a bit disappointing to me, because I visited the exhibition with my then very young son who was fascinated by some of the installations (but not so much Eno's one, if I remember correctly).\n\nYouTube:\n\nDiscogs link: Brian Eno - Music For Civic Recovery Centre\n\nWikipedia link: Music for Civic Recovery Centre - Wikipedia\n\nAll the following are from Wikipedia.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1.

The event, featuring over 30 other artists, was curated by David Toop.\n\nPart of Eno's Quiet Club series of Installations, it combined 12 audio elements with 10 visual light-sculpture generative elements, which was, itself, part of a series of multi-dimensional generative music pieces using asynchronous CD players, carousel projectors and video monitors used in other Installation pieces.\n\nIn a conversation with Toop, Eno's view is of a quiet \"recovery area\" situated within a city area, a theory which he has spoken of since the mid-eighties; a \"critically functioning public space\", a (preferably) darkened room containing large-format screens, and many CD players and sculptures.\n\nAnd, because we'e already covered the music (in a slightly different form) for Music from Civil Recovery Centre, we go straight onto Compact Forest Proposal. Not that this album really takes us anywhere that different from what we have heard recently.\n\nYouTube:\n\nWikipedia link: Compact Forest Proposal - Wikipedia\n\nDiscogs link: Brian Eno - Compact Forest Proposal\n\nTrack listing (from Discogs):\n\n1 Compact Forest Proposal, Condition 5 6:09\n\n2 Compact Forest Proposal, Condition 3 5:53\n\n3 Compact Forest Proposal, Condition 4 20:04\n\n4 Compact Forest Proposal, Condition 8 5:45\n\n5 Compact Forest Proposal, Condition 7 10:00\n\nThe liner notes, from Discogs.\n\nThere are 10 active CD players in this installation. Each is playing a specially cut CD, a single layer of the total music. The CDs have different numbers of tracks, some of which are silent, and each player is set to play these tracks in random order. The final music is therefore an ever-changing combination, unlikely to exactly repeat itself in any individual user's experience.\n\nThe studies on the CD represent possible conditions of the installation piece (i.e. conditions that it might randomise itself into sometime during the several months that it will play), although there are some elements in the studies that were not finally used in the installation itself.\n\nMy other installation pieces to date have been relatively \"steady state\" in that they've remained faithful to a specific harmonic palette. In this piece, however, one of the 10 playing CDs carries two quite different harmonic sub-strata. Since these are different tracks on the same single CD, they are never heard together, but alternate with each other. The other elements of the piece float over these backdrops: it's as though the weather changes.\n\nCompact Forest Proposal\n\nThis is another ambient installation, similar to those that are in the Music for Installations box set.\n\nIt is nice ambient music. There are a number of sounds, mostly quite musical and consonant, and they sound to me to be quite typical DX7, FM Synthesis, sounds.\n\nThis is an album that could have been quite nice if we had covered it among albums of different styles that contrasted with it.\n\nBut, particularly when the sounds that sound like treated voices return, it's too much of more or less the same good thing.\n\nThe different studies are I presume from the same generative sources, but they do sound different and provide a bit of contrast within the album.\n\nAnd then about 12 minutes in, we get sounds that have been used before in these. I can't remember which track has been repeated from which previous installation or album. But, I recognise them. Fortunately after going to the toilet and returning without stopping the album it's doing something I don't recognise after I return. But, then the recognisable, re-used from previous works, sounds return.\n\nOverall it's more of the same. In some bits of this music in a similar style to what has gone before. In other cases the ambient equivalent of a self-cover.\n\nThanks for bearing with us, anyone still reading this. I seem to have missed out Drawn from Life by Brian Eno and J. Peter Schwalm.\n\nYouTube:\n\nWikipedia link: Drawn from Life - Wikipedia\n\nDiscogs link: Brian Eno & J. Peter Schwalm - Drawn From Life\n\nTrack listing including writing credits, from Wikipedia.

It's short, and I don't know if this is an excerpt from a longer interview. Brian Eno and J. Peter Schwalm Radio Interview From 2001\n\nPerhaps even more interesting than the album itself is that Eno and Schwalm went on tour after this album. Here's a lengthy audience recording from one of the shows. This one in Milan, Italy, in 2002.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/s8iq8UvKJO8"
