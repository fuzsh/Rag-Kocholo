        "text": "Reviewed by ZapNiles on 24 Mar 2023\n\nLeaving Roxy Music after two masterpiece albums, \"tapes treatment\" and synth wizard Brian Eno created his first solo album with the aid of most of his former Roxy bandmates, as well as Chris Spedding, John Wetton, and Robert Fripp and many other guests, delivering his own masterpiece of Art Rock with a healthy dose of Glam. And although the music isn't too dissimilar from Eno's work with Roxy Music on the band's debut release and For Your Pleasure, the experimentation here is at a much higher level.\n\nHere Come the Warm Jets is completely unique to my ears, surreal yet accessible, zany yet catchy, sinister yet welcoming, with musical gems such as \"Baby's On Fire,\" \"Dead Finks Don't Talk,\" \"Driving Me Backwards,\" \"The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch,\" and \"Blank Frank\"—oh, hell, in truth, every one of the ten tracks is golden—all being mind-blowing when it came to overall creativity and general \"goofiness.\"\n\nSimply stated, when it comes to the avant-garde melody lines, the curious lyrical content, the eccentric instrumentation, or the innovative production techniques, sound effects, and \"treatments\" Eno gives to the various instruments and vocals, this is Art Rock at its finest. No wonder the man has become a musical living legend.\n\n4.5 out of 5 Stars"
