        "text": "Notes: 15 previously unreleased tracks from the Eno studio, curated by Brian's technical assistant Marlon Weyeneth. Somewhat of a Drop Vol 2 -- all the tracks appear to be from the last decade. \"Castro Haze\" and \"Manila Envelope\" appear in mildly different mixes from their Headcandy incarnations and \"Late Evening in Jersey\" (which appeared on the soundtrack of Heat) is a longer version of The Drop's \"Hazard\".\n\nHere's what Opal's Press Release said:\n\nCURIOSITIES VOLUME 1 by BRIAN ENO\n\nRELEASE DATE: Friday 5th September\n\nThis latest release from the Enoshop is the first in a series of collections of little known Eno work from recent years which has been collected together and compiled by his diligent and long suffering studio assistant, Marlon Weyeneth.\n\nBRIAN ENO COMMENTS ON CURIOSITIES:\n\nThe pieces on this record are singularities, things that didn't fit together with enough other things to ever make a whole album.\n\nThus 'Circus Mathematics' was imagined as part of a group of pieces called 'Mathematical Piano Music', but only three others ever materialized, and 'Ambient Savage' is the only surviving example of the little-known but much-mourned 'Afro-Ambient' genre.\n\n'Castro Haze' was the first, and, as it transpired, the last representative of the cycle which was to have been known as 'Unsuccessful Boxers' - the Castro in question was a welterweight who ultimately failed in his bid to seize fame.\n\nThe 'Thrash Funk' category of which 'War Fetish' is a proud member, has been more prolific but still not quite abundant enough to justify a whole CD. 'Work/Wank' belongs to a long tradition of songs with very few lyrics (such as 'Hot Pastrami', 'Mashed Potatoes' and 'Wipeout'), and, together with 'Draw One Animal' formed the beginning of my projected CD: 11 things to do on a dull afternoon. Unfortunately this project failed because I could only think of three.\n\nBrian Eno is currently at work in his studio on his forthcoming song album, tentatively called Brian Eno: The Love Collection.\n\nCuriosities Volume 1 will be exclusively available from the Enoshop website http://www.enoshop.co.uk/. The Enoshop website has been set up to provide an outlet for the side projects which keep distracting Brian from work on his song album.\n\nNote: The first set of \"Original Masters\" CDs, given the collective title \"Early Works\". Virgin's site The Raft reported at the time that the music \"will not be 'remastered' but instead will be re-transferred by Simon Heyworth from the original analogue masters\". There's a mention of the mastering equipment here. Simon did an excellent job with the sound quality, but there were problems with the CD mastering.\n\nThe press release said:\n\nHe co-wrote with David Bowie on Low, Heroes and Lodger, was a founder member of Roxy Music, as well as the producer of U2's The Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, Zooropa, All That You Can't Leave Behind, Talking Head's Fear of Music and Remain in Light, Devo's Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! and many more.\n\nBut that's just part of the story.\n\nNow Brian Eno's groundbreaking albums have been digitally remastered and reissued in special edition digipak packages as part of a series called \"Original Masters.\" Very often when albums are remastered, the tapes are re-equalized, remixed, in other words altered from the way they were originally delivered by the artist. Not so with the albums in the \"Original Masters\" series.\n\nUsing an ATR analog mastering deck with Aria Reference Series class A discrete electronics, Simon Heyworth was able to coax a higher level of fidelity out of these recordings than ever before heard, while keeping the original mastering intact.\n\n\"What I quickly learnt was that many of the EQ'd Production Masters at the time were absolutely 'spot on',\" says Heyworth, \"and why shouldn't they be when you think about it, this was the end of a long artistic endeavour and are we saying that they didn't get it right at that point? This is nonsense of course because if it was a landmark recording and sold lots of albums it must have been right! The Artist and Producer all decided at the time that this was 'it'. Should we be tampering with that piece of art - after all we don't go around saying let's Re-master a great painting.\"\n\nThe result is a clarity and depth of sound to these albums not heard since their initial playback in the recording studio. And more important, no attempts have been made to re-equalize, remix or in any way tamper with the original EQ'ed analogue production masters. These \"Original Masters\" sound just as Brian Eno originally intended them to be heard.\n\nCD mastering flaw:\n\nOn the first pressing of Another Green World, the problem was described by EnoWeb visitor Feline1 thus: 'If you haven't heard one of these discs yourself, lemme try and explain what happens - it's quite odd - \"Everything Merges With The Night\" fades in for some several seconds, it's not like it just abruptly begins with a chunk missing from the start... but the first vocal line is \"I've been waiting all evening\" - it's like they've seamlessly removed the correct first line \"Rosalie\" and digitally spliced the join back together.\" Virgin issued an official statement: \"Subsequent to approval of a correct version of Another Green World on reference CD, there was a DDP image file corruption which has affected the track 'Everything Merges With The Night'. Please take your CD back to where you bought it, and the retailer will exchange it for you. Although working as fast as possible to remanufacture, the new discs won't be ready until the end of next week.\" Incorrect pressings were supposed to have been withdrawn from sale by Virgin EMI but we received several reports of instances where this had not occurred. Astralwerks offered a higher level of support to its customers.\n\nQuibbles about packaging:\n\nThe CDs are packaged in digipacks inside a protective plastic sleeve. There is very little tolerance in the sleeve which means re-inserting the digipack into the sleeve is often difficult.\n\nThe designer positioned the text on the spines in a non-standard orientation (most go from top to bottom with the baseline on the left. These go from bottom to top with baseline on the right).\n\nThe four Peter Schmidt print watercolour images, an important part of Before And After Science, were excluded from the packaging and the album's original subtitle Fourteen Pictures was cut down to Ten Pictures.\n\nNotes: Brian Enoâs 77 Million Paintings is a generative project - a \"visual music\" program using television and computer screens to create constantly evolving paintings.\n\nAvailable in limited-edition deluxe numbered packaging, it features a generative software disc playable on Mac or PC together with an exclusive interview DVD and a 52-page hardbound book with an extensive essay by Eno covering his career as a visual artist, fully illustrated with previously unseen images. The 77 million paintings are generated from handmade slides, randomly combined by the computer using specially developed software. It also processes the music that accompanies the paintings in a similar way, so the selection of elements and their duration in the piece are arbitrarily chosen, forming a virtually infinite number of variations.\n\n\"I think of these things as visual music. The screen is not being used to tell a story - which is what screens normally do - but to show a painting that changes all the time. One of the interesting things about this is that the artist doesnât actually know what the result is going to be. There will be unique moments in this for every viewer, and every viewerâs experience will be somewhat different. This could be used just as youâd use a painting. People now have larger screens, but these big objects sitting in their rooms are dormant for a lot of the time. If youâre not actually watching television, what you have is a big black hole in the wall. 77 Million Paintings is intended to occupy that downtime so that, instead of having a dead hole in the wall, you have a living picture.\" -- Brian Eno\n\nNo longer available after it sold out. The software still works fine on Windows PCs with Windows 10 (although it may insist on a resolution of 1024x768), but stopped working on Macintoshes after Mac OS 10.6 because 10.7 Lion removed Carbon support. It is surprising that an updated version has not been created, but there you go. They don't even appear to have bothered to renew 77millionpaintings.com.\n\nNote: A long ambient piece divided into four seasons, based on the installation Twelve Seasons - Music for the Great Gallery. Trivia: This was originally planned as a single track (the advance copies were in this format), but had to be split up into four tracks to allow distribution on vinyl. Here's Brian talking to Mother Jones:\n\nBE: This actually has two genesis stories. The first story was that I was commissioned to make a piece of music for a particular building in Turin that connects two palaces. It's a long gallery—about 100 meters long, 15 meters high—designed in the 1740s by an architect called [Filippo] Juvarra. About a million visitors every year move through it; the people who run the place said they wanted to make them slow down a little bit because they felt that people were kind of racing from one palace to another and not noticing that they were moving through this beautiful space. So they said \"Would you make a piece of music to slow people down?\" basically. So I made a piece of music that I thought would work. And then I flew over to Turin with my piece of music—all the speakers and everything as I had specified were set up—and I put the piece on, and within 20 seconds I knew it was completely the wrong piece.\n\nMJ: Why?\n\nBE: It just didn't connect with the place at all. First of all it sounded very modern, and the building doesn't look like that. It's an amazing piece of Baroque architecture. It's full of details and, most importantly, it's full of light. It's got huge windows on both sides, so the main impression when you first walk in there is of light and the changing character of light during the day. And my piece had been made in my studio—it's a nice piece, by the way, but very interior, very reflective, introspective; quite dark, I guess you'd say. I had my little portable studio with me, so I thought, okay, I'll spend a couple days sitting here and I'll try to find out what sorts of things are going to work. And by the time I left, I had a palette of sounds and the sort of feeling of pacing that was going to work, and then I came back to London and I made this piece. So the two stories are a) the invitation to make music for a particular space and b) the total failure.\n\nMJ: Which one of those two pieces became LUX?\n\nBE: The music that is being used in the palace became the basis for this album. I set up a thing in my studio where I had a very comfortable bed to lie on and I put speakers at each side of the pillow so I could lie down and be inside this piece of music. (I don't like headphones.) And I did that because I wanted to adjust the music for the palace. While I was doing that, I was thinking, \"I really love listening to this piece and, furthermore, it's pretty different to any other piece that I've done.\" I mean, I'm sure somebody that doesn't know my work well would think, \"Yeah that sounds like another piece of clinky-clonk Brian Eno music.\" To me it's different.\n\nMJ: And your piece will run at the palace for five years, around the clock?\n\nBE: No. Originally I thought it was going to be an around-the-clock idea and so I thought of making a generative piece, which is to say a piece that would keep remaking itself differently forever. But then I heard that actually what they wanted is to have an hour on, an hour off. In fact, I sort of suggested that as well, because I thought there are going to be people who come to this gallery who just want to be in the gallery without Mr. Eno putting his interpretation of the experience on it. And so I started to explore this idea of making the music episodic. And also something that you don't have to listen to from beginning to end—you can enter at any point and leave at any point. So I started working with the idea of permutation, the ultimate something-for-nothing idea where you take a small number of elements and then you cluster them together in as many different ways as time and nature will permit."
