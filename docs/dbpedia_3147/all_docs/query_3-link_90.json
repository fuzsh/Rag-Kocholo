Roxy Music's success in the glam rock scenecame quickly, but Eno soon tired of conflicts with lead singer Bryan Ferry, and of touring, and he left the group after the release of For YourPleasure (1973), beginning his solo career with the art rock records Here Come the Warm Jets (1974) and Taking Tiger Mountain (ByStrategy) (1974).Eno extended his reach into more experimental musical styles with (No Pussyfooting) (1973) and Evening Star (1975), both collaborationswith Robert Fripp, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) by Genesis where his work is credited as \"Enossification\", and his influentialsolo records Another Green World (1975) and Discreet Music (1975). His pioneering ambient efforts at \"sonic landscapes\" began toconsume more of his time beginning with Ambient 1/Music for Airports (1978) and later Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks (1983)which was composed for the documentary film For All Mankind. Eno nevertheless continued to sing on some of his records, ranging fromBefore and After Science (1977) to Wrong Way Up (1990) with John Cale to most recently Another Day on Earth (2005) and DrumsBetween the Bells (2011).Eno's solo work has been extremely influential, pioneering ambient and generative music, innovating production techniques, andemphasizing \"theory over practice\". He also introduced the concept of chance music to popular audiences partly through collaborations withother musicians. By the end of the 1970s, Eno had worked with David Bowie on the seminal \"Berlin Trilogy,\" helped popularise the Americanpunk rock band Devo and the punk-influenced \"No Wave\" genre, and worked frequently with Harold Budd, John Cale, Cluster, Robert Frippand David Byrne, with whom he produced the influential My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981). He produced and performed on three albumsby Talking Heads, including Remain in Light (1980); produced seven albums for U2, including The Joshua Tree (1987); and worked onrecords by James, Laurie Anderson, Coldplay, Depeche Mode, Paul Simon, Grace Jones and Slowdive, among others.Eno pursues multimedia ventures in parallel to his music career, including art installations, a newspaper column in The Observer and aregular column on society and innovation in Prospect magazine, and \"Oblique Strategies\" (written with Peter Schmidt), a deck of cards inwhich each card has a cryptic remark or random insight meant to resolve a dilemma. He continues to collaborate with other musicians,produce records, release his own music, and write. Â« hide"
