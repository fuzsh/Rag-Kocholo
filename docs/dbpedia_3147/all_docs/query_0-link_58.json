        "text": "Favorite Music of 2003\n\nchosen by the PSF staff\n\n(also see the ridiculously extensive Editor's List)\n\nDave Andrae\n\nThe Clean - Anthology (Merge, Flying Nun)\n\nVenetian Snares - Einstein-Rosen Bridge (Planet-Mu)\n\nBroadcast - \"Before We Begin\" (Warp)\n\nVictor Gama - Pangeia Instumentos (Rephlex)\n\nPop Ambient 2003 (Kompakt)\n\nIron and Wine - Sea and The Rhythm (Sub-Pop)\n\nDisjecta - True Love By Normal Polyfusia)\n\nVenetian Snares - Badminton (Addict)\n\nChris Clark - Empty the Bones of You (Warp)\n\nUrban Myth and Steve Beresford - Live At The Friends Meeting House (Planet-Mu)\n\nThe Books - The Lemon of Pink (Tomlab)\n\nNeon Hunk - Smarmy Mob (Load)\n\nSoundmurder - Wired for Sound (Rewind!)\n\nBeauty Pill - You Are Right To Be Afraid (Dischord)\n\nThe Neapolitans featuring The Lonesome Organist (Neapolitan Records)\n\nNotes: Theres some rare, indefinable quality that makes The Cleans back catalog (as compiled on this\n\nyears Anthology) such an enduring listen, and its not merely their hailing from New Zealand. Venetian\n\nSnares may be inconsistent or prolific to a fault, but look no further than the Einstein-Rosen Bridge 12\"\n\n(not to mention The Chocolate Wheelchair Album or Badminton 7\") for an example of some of the most\n\nrefreshing manic electronic music in recent memory. As always, there are loads of new releases on my \"records\n\nto get\" list that I still have to pick up (not to mention plenty of recordings from 2003 I havent even\n\nheard of yet!), so this list is a tad premature.\n\nCarson Arnold\n\nNeil Young - Greendale (Reprise)\n\nFern Knight - Seven Years Of Severed Limbs (Normal)\n\nBrett Smiley - Breathlessly Brett (RPM)\n\nGlenn Branca - The Ascension (Acute; reissued)\n\nThe Mitchells - Hear Where You Are (Pigeon Records)\n\nAlex Walsh - Light Another Candle (Backdoor Jams)\n\nJosh Crane - Barebones (Microearth Records)\n\nCul De Sac - The Strangler's Wife (Strange Attractors Audio House)\n\nRoscoe Holcomb - An Untamed Sense Of Control (Smithsonian Folkways Recordings)\n\nJohnette Napolitano - Sketchbook (self-released; a late bloomer of 2002)\n\nTelevision - Marquee Moon (Elektra/Asylum; reissued)\n\nRobot Wars - (self-released; Al Martin, Charles Cicirella, and special guests!)\n\nThe Carter Family - Volume 2 1935-1941 (JSP)\n\nZwan - Mary Star Of The Sea (Martha's Music/Reprise)\n\nDaniel Lanois - Shine (Anti)\n\nI listed a few reissues and one late blossom of 2002; everything divided between material that's been mailed to me and popular hey-ho.\n\nKyle Barnett\n\nYo La Tengo  Summer Sun (Matador)\n\nThis year, even Yo La Tengo wasnt critic-proof; some found the bands hip-hop/avant-jazz flirtations to be trying. But like NRBQ, Yo La Tengo again manages to extend their range while remaining a great rock n roll band.\n\nVulgar Boatmen  Wide Awake (No Nostalgia)\n\nThe Vulgar Boatmen return with this career retrospective (and unreleased tracks), which offers a great introduction to the uninitiated for a band that continues to impress.\n\nThe Postal Service  Give Up (Sub Pop)\n\nThis pop-by-mail project of Jimmy Tamborello (Dntel) and Benjamin Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie) comes as a great surprise. In favor of a tuneful synth pop, The Postal Service end up creating something memorable.\n\nCat Power  You are Free (Matador)\n\nChan Marshall and company effortlessly brings together past and present here, while nicely beefing up the engine room.\n\nMissy Elliott  This is Not a Test! (Elektra)\n\nA late-in-the-year release, but Elliott (and the rest of the Virginia hip hop trust), keeps reinventing the art form amidst reports of its splintering and sputtering.\n\nFountains of Wayne  Welcome Interstate Managers (S-Curve/Virgin)\n\nSummoning summer radio heroes past (Cheap Trick, The Cars) with some great country songs thrown in, Fountains of Wayne offer up goodhearted, understated, bittersweet suburban songs that stay with you.\n\nPernice Brothers  Yours, Mine & Ours (Ashmont)\n\nEschewing earlier reliances on orchestral pop, Joe Pernice and band favor a more stripped down approach that at times serves as a better showcase for his always strong songs.\n\nVarious Artists  Lost in Translation (Emperor Norton)\n\nThe music that accompanied one of the years great films also delivered. Some new music from Kevin Shields, including golden oldies from My Bloody Valentine and Jesus and Mary Chain, and a hidden track of Bill Murray karaoke rendition of Roxy Music s More than This.\n\nPrefuse 73  One Word Extinguisher (Warp)\n\nNice glitch-hop from Atlanta, GA, with tons of successful turntablist and laptop experiments. Audio quackery never sounded so good.\n\nVarious Artists  Down in the Basement: Joe Bussards Treasure Trove of Vintage 78s (Old Hat); Various Artists  Gennett Records Greatest Hits Collection (Starr-Gennett Foundation)\n\nTwo from late 2002 you missed. More incredible American pop music was released before World War II than you could ever possibly hear. These two releases (both from late 2002) provide great overviews\n\nOutKast  Speakerboxx/The Love Below (Arista)\n\nThe single of the year might well be Dre 3000s Hey Ya, which sounds like a template for a new pop hybrid. The rest of Dres The Love Below doesnt quite live up, but Big Boi satisfies consistently with Speakerboxx.\n\nSome Girls  Feel It (Koch)\n\nSome Girls Feel It is an unassuming, less-is-more album, full of great vocal hooks, guitar jags, and an impossibly full drum presence. Juliana Hatfield joins up with fellow Blake Babies alumnus Freda Love and bassist Heidi Gluck from Indianapolis the Pieces.\n\nMy Morning Jacket  It Still Moves (ATO/RCA)\n\nHeres a band I shouldnt like on paper, but I consistently have. These Louisville reverb farmers create a sound that somehow finds middle ground between the Allman Brothers and Spacemen 3, while coming up with solid if idiosyncratic tunes.\n\nOliver Mtukudzi  The Oliver Mtukudzi Collection: The Tuku Years (Putumayo)\n\nUnlike Thomas Mapfumo, Zimbabwes Oliver Mtukudzi prefers an acoustic guitar sound, focused on rhythm as much as melody. This collection highlights Mtukudzis half-decade long collaboration with South African musican/producer Steve Dyer.\n\nCaveat: I never hear all Id like in any given year and this one is no exception. This was especially the case in 2003, when my habit of listening across decades past became especially acute. Still, I managed to hear a bit of timely and worthwhile stuff amidst all this activity. In no particular order:\n\nAndy Beta\n\nDouble Leopards- Halve Maen\n\nTetuzi Akiyama- Dont Forget to Boogie!\n\nRicardo Villalobos- Alcachofa\n\nViktor Vaughn- Vaudeville Villain\n\nTobias Thomas- Smallville\n\nColoma- Finery\n\nJay-Z- The Black Album\n\nHecker- Sun Pandamonium\n\nThe Rapture- Echoes\n\nThe Clientele- The Violet Hour\n\nFiery Furnaces- Gallowsbirds Bark\n\nScorces- Ma Vie avec la Bete\n\nFour Tet- Rounds\n\nAnimal Collective- Here Comes the Indian\n\nMu- Afro Finger and Gel\n\nKen Cox\n\nThe Donnas - Spend the Night (Altantic)\n\nThe Be Good Tanyas - Chinatown (Nettwerk)\n\nJolie Holland - Catalpa (self-produced)\n\nThe Statler Brothers - Farewell Concert (Compendia Music Group)\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys - Colors (Spring Hill)\n\nThe Runaways - The Runaways (Cherry Red/reissue)\n\nSleater-Kinney - One Beat (Kill Rock Stars)\n\nAvril Lavigne - Let Go\n\nPo' Girl - Po' Girl (Hightone)\n\nNorah Jones - Come Away with Me (Blue Note)\n\nJerry Lee Lewis - 16 Thrillers from The Killer (Varese Records/reissue)\n\nVarious Artists - When the Sun Goes Down: The Secret History of Rock and Roll (RCA)\n\nJason D.

Ornette and the Captain SHOULD be out again; it's criminal that they are not. Absolute Zero have finally found a label (they were on my best of last year, but they are still good bets). And Soft Machine, Quiet Sun, Tony Williams The Nice and ELP are symbols of a time when experimentation (even if it failed) was a GOOD thing. Peter Brotzann and Frank Zappa deserve to be here. And there is always room for the Bonzos with their curious design of faces that, if you half-looked, became roses of great vulgarity.\n\nJesse Jarnow\n\nYo La Tengo - Summer Sun (Matador)\n\nWillie Nelson - Crazy: The Demo Sessions (Sugar Hill)\n\nRadiohead - Hail To The Thief (Capitol)\n\nThe Dixie Hummingbirds - Diamond Jubilation (Rounder)\n\nThe Decemberists - Her Majesty, The Decemberists (Kill Rock Stars)\n\nManitoba - Up In Flames (Domino)\n\nVarious artists - Flowers In The Wildwood, Women In Early Country Music, 1923-1939 (Trikont)\n\nYo La Tengo - Today Is The Day EP (Matador)\n\nYoung People - War Prayers (Dim Mak)\n\nRobert Wyatt - Solar Flares Burn For You (Cuneiform)\n\nJonny Greenwood - Bodysong (Capitol)\n\nVarious artists - Masked and Anonymous soundtrack (Columbia)\n\nDavid Byrne - Lead Us Not Into Temptation (Thrill Jockey)\n\nFour Tet - Rounds (Domino)\n\nAnd, my number one record for 2003 (and 2002, and possibly 2001), if only it hadn't been released in 2002:\n\nThe Mountain Goats - Tallahassee (4AD)\n\nKortney Jmaeffs\n\nMars Volta- De-loused at the Comatorium (GOLD STANDARD)\n\nTomahawk- Mit Gas (IPECAC)\n\nMastodon - Remission (RELAPSE)\n\nThe Locust - Plague Soundscapes (ANTI)\n\nDanko Jones - We Sweat Blood (DANKO JONES)\n\nCursive - The Ugly Organ (SADDLE CREEK)\n\nNebula - Atomic Ritual (LIQUOR & POKER)\n\nSerart- Serart (SERJICAL)\n\nFirewater - Songs we should have Written (JETSET)\n\nAndrew WK - The Wolf (ISLAND)\n\nHawksley Workman - Lover/Fighter (UNIVERSAL)\n\nMetric- Old world underground, Where are you now?

(Sure to be on next year's list is Songs We Should Have Written [Jetset], an all-covers collection coming out in January.)\n\nBritta Phillips and Dean Wareham - L'Avventura (Jetset): A collaboration between the bassist and singer-songwriter-guitarist from Luna; a continuation of the pure but off-kilter pop on Romantica and Close Cover Before Striking, but even more playful and emotionally direct.\n\nProfessor and Maryann - Runaway Favorite (Happy Thighs): Finely crafted, understatedly dramatic noir-folk-pop by a male-female duo and, this time, their band.\n\nStratford 4 - Love & Distortion (Jetset): Guitar-based, intermittently psychedelic rock that sounds like a combination of the Only Ones, the early Dream Syndicate, the Fall, Ride, et al.\n\nThrowing Muses - Throwing Muses (4AD): A furious return, their most straightforward \"punk\" record, and Kristin Hersh's most inspired work in years.\n\nTownes Van Zandt - In the Beginning... (Campadre): His earliest recordings, up till now unreleased, masterfully haunting.\n\nVarious artists - Wig in a Box: Songs from and Inspired by Hedwig and the Angry Inch (Off): Like a big cast party, with Rufus Wainwright, Sleater-Kinney (and Fred Schneider!), Spoon, and so on, having fun with and doing justice to great songs.\n\nRufus Wainwright - Want One (Dreamworks): Simultaneously his John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and his All Things Must Pass?; as infectious and moving as it is ambitious. (Sure to be on next year's list is Want Two, due early next year.)\n\nWalkabouts - Slow Days with Nina (Shingle Street): Released only in the UK, an EP of quiet, meditative, out-of-left-field Nina Simone covers.\n\nDoug Wieselman - Dimly Lit (Tzadik): Brief, low-key, and often very beautiful soundtrack instrumentals for assorted films, by a composer better known as a downtown-NYC clarinetist.\n\nLucinda Williams - World Without Tears (Lost Highway): Guaranteed to weed out the casual listeners, Williams's most dour, uncompromising, warts-and-all collection yet.\n\nMark Williams"
