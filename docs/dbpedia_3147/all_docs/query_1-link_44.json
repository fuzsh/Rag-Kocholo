        "text": "OUTKAST -- Outkast keeps things light and catchy on the double single that previews its double album due in October. Big Boi's ''The Way You Move'' (Arista) has an airy, Earth Wind and Fire-like chorus between his fast-talking come-ons. But for music and wit, Andr√© 3000's ''Hey Ya'' prevails. The track rivals Beck as it mutates from handclapping folk-rock to electro, while the lyrics make their way from the pain of a couple's breakup to a quick rebound: ''Don't want to meet your daddy/ just want you in my Caddy.'' While Big Boi and Andre 3000 are splitting the album, they agree on their first priority: lust.\n\nNATALIA LAFOURCADE -- With four Latin Grammy nominations for her debut album, ''Natalia LaFourcade'' (Sony Discos), this 19-year-old songwriter might just reach the wider world. Although she is Mexican, Ms. LaFourcade has a strong Brazilian streak. Her poppy songs keep dipping into bossa nova and its recent dance-floor hybrids, pondering life and fate with insouciant melodies. Beyond the language barrier, she could be Mexico's answer to Nelly Furtado.\n\nBRIAN ENO -- As he contemplated the first project of the Long Now Foundation -- a clock intended to tick once a year and chime once a century for 10,000 years -- Brian Eno started thinking about bells and their swarming overtones. ''January 07003: Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now'' (Opal) is the result: music for electronically simulated bells. The pieces are meditative, testing permutations and letting overtones float. But Mr. Eno's bells also do things physical bells never could, like emitting their harmonics in eerie reversed time or resurrecting the Tsar Kolokol III: the largest bell ever cast, which cracked before it could ring.\n\nTHE BRONX -- The chutzpah it takes for a Los Angeles group to call itself the Bronx is just part of the arsenal of this punky band on its 10-song, 29-minute debut album, ''The Bronx'' (White Drugs/Ferret Music). The songs are all hurtling tempos, throat-tearing vocals, meter-shifting guitar riffs, accusations and declarations like ''I wasn't meant to cover up scars.'' Fury and self-destruction battle it out in songs too tightly wound to succumb to their own demons.\n\nSISTER ROSETTA THARPE -- Sister Rosetta (1915-1973) may be the most rocking woman in gospel history. Slinging her electric guitar and letting loose a voice that applied the earthiness of the blues to admonitions about the power of the Lord, she was an underappreciated source for soul and rock. Her revival should be stoked by an astonishing performance to be broadcast next month as part of the PBS series ''The Blues,'' and there's another one tucked onto ''Shout, Sister, Shout!'' (M.C. Records). It's a tribute album of Tharpe's repertory: devout standards like ''This Train'' along with a few secular ones. While Joan Osborne, Odetta and Sweet Honey in the Rock make the most of their selections, the album's gem is its bonus video file: Tharpe herself belting ''Down by the Riverside'' and plunking a guitar solo Chuck Berry wouldn't disown.\n\nRODNEY CROWELL -- Current country music has perfected the impersonal reminiscence: the oh-so-perfect collection of generic rural details. Rodney Crowell has dispensed his share of them over his long songwriting career, but lately he has been getting crankier and far more specific. His new album, ''Fate's Right Hand'' (Columbia), is filled with middle-aged yearning, self-criticism and spite set amid forthrightly strummed guitars. ''It's a Different World Now'' rises like one of those unctuous Nashville ballads, but its vision of a world devastated by war, sexual exploitation and ecological disaster makes the Dixie Chicks sound like gung-ho conservatives.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
