        "text": "Brian Eno\n\nThe antithesis of every boy (or girl) who grew callouses on their fingers learning the guitar licks of Eric Clapton in the worthless pursuit of adulation, Eno describes himself as a non-musician. He is, in fact, a seeker of new sounds. Originally a member of the seminal art-rock group Roxy Music, Eno used his knowledge of electronics to throw a wrench into the works of popular music. After two albums, Eno left to pursue ambient soundscapes with guitarist Robert Fripp (Eno is often cited as the father of ambient music) and apply his unique genius to traditional song structures, as on Here Come The Warm Jets and Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy). The two ideals met on the brilliant Another Green World and Before And After Science (included in this period is perhaps the most sublime application of Eno's ambient muse, Discreet Music). However, from here on Eno would relegate his pop music side to the support of other musicians (David Bowie, Devo, Talking Heads, Ultravox, U2) while using his own solo career to advance the aesthetics of ambient music (often in collaboration with other artists, including Harold Budd, Jon Hassell and Cluster). Highlights from his ambient/instrumental catalog include Ambient One: Music for Airports (originally intended for broadcast at airports to soothe passengers), an album of avant-garde/third-world music with David Byrne (My Life in the Bush of Ghosts), and The Pearl (with Harold Budd and Daniel Lanois). Eno is rightly regarded as one of the most influential musical figures in the 20th century.\n\nDate ALBUMS / Singles 1973 November NO PUSSYFOOTING 1974 January HERE COME THE WARM JETS 1974 March Seven Deadly Finns 1974 November TAKING TIGER MOUNTAIN (BY STRATEGY) 1975 August The Lion Sleeps Tonight 1975 September ANOTHER GREEN WORLD 1975 November DISCREET MUSIC 1975 December EVENING STAR 1977 August CLUSTER & ENO 1977 December BEFORE AND AFTER SCIENCE 1977 December King's Lead Hat 1978 September MUSIC FOR FILMS 1978 AFTER THE HEAT 1978 AMBIENT ONE: MUSIC FOR AIRPORTS 1980 April AMBIENT 2: THE PLATEAUX OF MIRROR 1980 April FOURTH WORLD VOLUME ONE: POSSIBLE MUSICS 1981 February MY LIFE IN THE BUSH OF GHOSTS 1981 May The Jezebel Spirit 1981 MUSIC FOR AIRPLAY 1982 March AMBIENT 4: ON LAND 1983 July APOLLO: ATMOSPHERES & SOUNDTRACKS 1983 November WORKING BACKWARDS: 1983 - 1973 1984 August THE PEARL 1985 August VOICES 1985 October THURSDAY AFTERNOON 1986 OLD LAND 1986 March MORE BLANK THAN FRANK 1987 January DESERT ISLAND SELECTION 1987 January MUSIC FOR FILMS 2 1988 MUSIC FOR FILMS III 1989 March Another Green World 1990 October 5 WRONG WAY UP 1990 November One Word 1991 MY SQUELCHY LIFE 1992 July Fractal Zoom 1992 September 1 NERVE NET 1992 October Ali Click 1992 November 10 THE SHUTOV ASSEMBLY 1993 June 17 NEROLI 1993 November BRIAN ENO 1993 November BRIAN ENO 2 1994 April 5 THE ESSENTIAL FRIPP AND ENO 1994 October THE COMPACT COLLECTION 1995 October 23 SPINNER 1997 July 8 THE DROP 1999 August 3 SONORA PORTRAITS 2000 October 24 COOLAUGUSTMOON 2001 June 12 DRAWN FROM LIFE 2003 January 1 JANUARY 07003: BELL STUDIES FOR THE CLOCK OF THE LONG NOW 2005 March 22 MORE MUSIC FOR FILMS 2005 April 5 THE EQUATORIAL STARS 2007 October 15 BEYOND EVEN (1992-2006) 2008 August 18 EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS WILL HAPPEN TODAY 2010 November 2 SMALL CRAFT ON A MILK SEA\n\nSEE ALSO...\n\nDAVID BOWIE discography\n\nHAROLD BUDD discography\n\nJOHN CALE discography\n\nROXY MUSIC discography\n\nTALKING HEADS discography\n\nDavid Byrne: The Catherine Wheel\n\nCamel: Rain Dances\n\nSongs From The Cool World\n\nBryan Ferry: Mamouna\n\nRobert Fripp: Exposure\n\nJon Hassell: Dream Theory in Malaya\n\nIcehouse: Measure For Measure\n\nLaraaji: Ambient #3 Day of Radiance\n\nMusic From The Penguin Cafe\n\nSearch the world for your music!"
