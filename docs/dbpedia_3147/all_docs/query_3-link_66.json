The student’s work there was part of a plan to further enhance the College’s international engagement portfolio in the region.\n\nA partnership between Bloomfield College of Montclair State University and Worrall Media has created the opportunity for college students in a Journalism 1 class taught by Professor Jason Torreano to work hand-in-hand with the publication’s editor, Joe Ungaro, to publish stories in local newspapers and on their websites.\n\nMen’s and Women’s Track and Field, Men’s and Women’s Cross Country, Women’s Soccer and Women’s Bowling will be suspended beginning in the fall of 2024.\n\nMore than 400 women from around the state converged on the Montclair State University campus November 15 for the 9th Annual Women’s Leadership Alliance Conference, where they heard from keynote speakers and participated in breakouts sessions, think tanks and panel discussions.\n\nBloomfield College of Montclair State University Assistant Professor and Coordinator of Accounting Peter C. DeSarno, CPA, MBA, MS, was recently honored with a 2023 Impact Ovation Award by the New Jersey Society of Certified Public Accountants (NJCPA) in recognition of “exemplary efforts and stellar achievement in advancing New Jersey’s accounting profession.”"
