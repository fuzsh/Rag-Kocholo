Brian made a unique contribution with a lengthy interview about Stafford. He was very keen to contribute (including a new photo), as Stafford was a major influence/mentor on how he made his records; particularly in the '70s & '80s. A good deal of what he has to say is on record (no pun intended) here for the first time and it emphasizes just how unique and isolated he was in those years (which, of course, is why we love him). Brian makes clear why he had such confidence in the early ambient records thanks to Beer's ideas and how they differed from contemporary work by Mike Oldfield and Steve Reich. He still believes Beer to be hugely undervalued and unacknowledged as a progenitor of current thinking on chaos and complexity. Robert Fripp has also contributed to the book by allowing two interesting letters to be reprinted here. Fripp and Eno brought together at last!\n\nStafford Beer at Wavestone Press\n\nStephan Decroo & Enoshop report that All Saints Records has a new web-site selling its catalogue of albums by Brian & Roger Eno, Jon Hassell and others.\n\nAll Saints Records\n\nDavid Buckley writes: This is David Buckley - the author of a new book called The Thrill Of It All: the Story Of Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music. The book is being written now, and is due out next spring. I would love to hear from any fans with their Roxy/Eno memories (concerts, anecdotes, anything!). My deadline is 31 January so, I won't have too much time to incorporate new material now though. EnoWeb adds: He can be contacted here.\n\nRory Walsh reads: Eno is quoted in January's issue of Mojo as saying that the best thing he has heard all year is the soundtrack to the film Hoover Street Revival, a film by his friend Sophie Fiennes (Sister of Ralph and Joe). \"I mean I love gospel music so I would say the soundtrack to that\" says Eno; \"It kind of says 'Everything's going to be OK.\" New British Cinema says that \"Sophie Fiennes’s documentary about black faith is a piece of pure observation, filmed around a buzzy gospel church in a ghetto in Los Angeles. Shots of local jobs, houses, kids and kitchen sinks are imaginatively spliced with footage of the charismatic pastor, Bishop Noel Jones (brother of the singer Grace). A rare and eloquent mosaic of a beleaguered community\".\n\nThe inaugural lecture on The Long Now which Brian gave in November has been posted on a new \"Enolog\" page at Enoshop.\n\nEnolog at Enoshop\n\nIan writes: I thought you might want to make readers aware that a large number of US Public Radio stations that carry PRI programming, also stream live to the Internet. So it should be possible to listen to the Echoes rebroadcasts live, although due to the time difference in Europe, this will favour insomniacs.\n\nStreaming public radio stations\n\nRichard Joly writes: Brian Eno talks about his latest projects on The Screen Savers (TechTV). Rich Yacuk adds: I just did a search on the DirecTV/TiVo and found that the Eno episode of ScreenSavers will be airing 11 December 2003. Show synopsis says \"Electronic Rock Legend Brian Eno\". EnoWeb says: time is probably Thursday at 7 p.m. and Friday 12th at 12 a.m. and 8 a.m. Eastern.\n\nTechtv.com for that week\n\nRichard Nensel e-mails to say Robert Fripp mentions plans for a day at Studio Eno (18:53 entry on 28 November)\n\nRobert's diary\n\nJohn Diliberto reverberates: In December Echoes runs a new feature with Roger Eno, and re-runs our three part series with Brian Eno, Jon Hopkins and the living room concert with Harold Budd. * denotes Echoes principal weekday & Sunday feeds and ** denotes stations' tape delay dates. EnoWeb adds: These may be run on your local PRI station, or you can listen on the Web at any time in return for a low subscription.\n\nWednesday 12/03*, Saturday 12/06**, Sunday 12/07*\n\nROGER ENO: RURAL ENGLISH AMBIENCE\n\nIn a quaint countryside village northeast of London, composer Roger Eno concocts a music full of English quirkiness, playful whimsy and subtle joy. In his attic studio called the Clerestory, Roger Eno talks about music for neglected English composers who don't exist, a 20th century German composer who does exist, and a musical aesthetic that embraces trumpets and harmoniums, Renaissance music and barroom songs.\n\nFriday 12/05*\n\nJON HOPKINS: GRANDCHILD OF AMBIENCE\n\nAmbient music is more than 30 years old, which makes it several years older than Jon Hopkins. But this English musician plays keyboards for ambient Godfather Brian Eno and also has his own CD of chilled moods called OPALESCENT. In his home in England, Jon Hopkins talks about ambient sound designs and pop music re-mixes.\n\nWednesday 12/17*, Saturday 12/20**, Sunday 12/28*\n\nBRIAN ENO PART ONE: NEW DIRECTIONS LOST & FOUND\n\nAs much music as you've heard from Brian Eno in the last thirty odd years, there are literally shelves more works-in-progress in his London studio. He's beginning to release some of it on his Curiosities series (Opal Music), but there are scores more. We take you into Eno's studio where the composer talks about new directions lost and found, plays some current projects and gives an impromptu Kaoss Pad solo.\n\nThursday 12/18*, Saturday 12/20**, Sunday 12/28*\n\nBRIAN ENO PART TWO: AMBIENCE OF THE LONG NOW\n\nIn the second part of our Brian Eno series, the composer and his brother Roger Eno, talk about the music of mid-20th century composer Hans Friedrich Micheelson and creating an ambient composition for bells that might exist in the far, far distant future.\n\nFriday 12/19*, Saturday 12/20**, Sunday 12/28*\n\nBRIAN ENO PART THREE: ABBA & HEAVY METAL/THE VELVET GLOVE & THE CLENCHED FIST In the process of playing some new, proto-punk-techno music & poetry works, Brian Eno ruminates on the place of music in the world today, the enduring popularity of Abba, and Heavy Metal as immersive music. \"I think heavy metal players haven't really understood what they're doing, because what they're really doing is making a bath that you can immerse yourself in. But they insist that they've got something to say which, of course, is a big mistake.\" For Heavy Metalists perhaps, but not Brian Eno. One of our most prescient prognosticators, Eno talks about a world where music might be less important, but where musical possibilities are unlimited.\n\nFriday 12/26*\n\nA LIVING ROOM CONCERT WITH HAROLD BUDD\n\nPianist and composer Harold Budd plays a solo concert live on Echoes. Budd was in on the ground floor of ambient music, recording on Brian Eno's Obscure label and releasing AMBIENT 2: PLATEAUX OF MIRROR. On Budd's new album, LA BELLA VISTA (Shout Factory Records) he teams up with his old cohort, producer Daniel Lanois, for a series of solo piano meditations. We'll hear him recreate the experience in a spontaneous performance live on Echoes.\n\nOrder your Echoes on-line hearing ability\n\nChoose your broadcasts\n\nEnoWeb is dedicated to keeping you informed about the very rarest Eno releases, and we are indebted to our Italian correspondent Renzo, who points out a page on the Long Now Foundation's site. The Foundation has a wine named in its honour by the Pelissero winery, and wine dealers were shipped a booklet and CD explaining Long Now's aims. Renzo says \"the CD includes 5 unreleased tracks in the 'January' generative style by Brian Eno\". Please just add this to your cellar of highly useful knowledge about Brian and all his works, as whining to Long Now or EnoShop about non-availability to non-wine-dealers would probably just result in a request to cork it. Yeah, I know, that's grape, isn't it, pour old us, just left to bottle up our excitement about some tracks we'll never get to sample. But admit it, this story did tipple your fancy. Curiously enough, one of the reasons we're enoweb.co.uk is because enoweb.com used to be registered by a European wine distributor, so it seems there is some strange cosmic and mystical link between Brian Eno and wine... what could it be now?\n\nVintage Now\n\nHeading off to Germany, Nik writes: Brian has some involvement with André Heller's new album, Ruf und Echo. EnoWeb adds: a Google search leads us to André Heller's site, and we learn the two collaborated on the Swarovski installation.\n\nRuf und Echo page on André Heller's site\n\nAmazon in Germany stocks it\n\nRichard Joly has been Googling too and has found another reference to the Damien Dempsey album and Brian's reaction to a Frames gig.\n\nDempsey\n\nFrames\n\nJohn writes: As you are already aware, Brian Eno is inaugurating a series of lectures on behalf of the Long Now organization here in San Francisco [on Nov 14, see story below]. As a result he was interviewed on live national public radio by our local pundit/guru Michael Krasny and by a number of callers. Charly Rhoades adds: Happily for slobbering EnoWeb fanboys, these programs are archived for later internet listening. It was a fairly extensive interview in length (about an hour) and topical breadth (early interest in art, his easy boredom, politics, his Time article about the US in Iraq, specific musical works like \"The Great Wheel,\" creative software development, the mystery of why sonic configurations appeal to humans, criticism/misunderstandings of The Long Now Foundation, the theft of his musical equipment in New York city whilst he was in Japan and how it liberated him, how he works with other musicians, generative music, etc, etc)\n\nIt's on this page, scroll down a bit to November 13th\n\n\"Friends, Long Now has just announced the following good news. Feel free to post and forward this invitation. Musician/producer BRIAN ENO1 will be giving a rare free2 public lecture at Fort Mason in San Francisco on Friday, Nov. 14, in the Herbst Pavilion. Coffee bar opens at 7pm3, lecture at 8pm. This is not a concert4. Brian Eno will be speaking about 'The Long Now'. His talk will be the first of a monthly series of Seminars About Long-term Thinking, sponsored by The Long Now Foundation. His talks are usually as amazing as his music. Admission to the lectures is free (a $10 donation is welcome but NOT required). The hall holds about 700 people. For unticketed lectures like this it's a good idea to come early for a good seat.\n\nThe on-going lectures in this new series will be every second Friday at Fort Mason. Future speakers include Peter Schwartz, George Dyson, Laurie Anderson, Rusty Schweickart, Paul Hawken, Daniel Janzen, and Danny Hillis.\" -- Thanks to Stewart Brand, Kevin Kelly & Radiocitizen.5\n\nDirections to Herbst Pavilion\n\nLong Now Foundation\n\nIt may be worth checking out these old Long Now talks (02000) from the Doors of Perception conference: Brian's discourse and Alexander Rose's lecture\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Yes, he of the CAPITAL LETTERS.\n\n2. Is it just EnoWeb, or does rare free make it sound as if Brian generally charges the earth?\n\n3. Presumably so you can put yourself in the right mood by getting hyped up on caffeine for an hour beforehand.\n\n4. Shame. Next they'll be saying he won't be wearing his tinsel jacket and platform boots. That can't be right, surely?\n\n5. See how all the top names read EnoWeb!!!!6\n\n6. At least, they used to...\n\nMixing It has preserved its interview with Brian from some weeks ago and you can find it here.\n\nBrian talks to Robert Sandall at 8am\n\nThe Echoes series of features on Brian included a full-length version of the song from which an extract was played on the Radio 2 documentary a few months ago. The song title was revealed as \"And Then So Clear\". The features included extracts from other unreleased pieces including a collaboration with poet Rick Holland. There was also the unusual audio spectacle (hearing aid, perhaps?) of Brian enthusing about an aspect of the Internet, though perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised as the aspect in question was Enoshop. You can hear the broadcasts for yourself on a good quality on-line stream for just $15.95 a month (lower monthly price available if you sign up for a quarter) which worked out at just under ten of EnoWeb's Earth Pounds the day we signed our lives away.\n\nOrder your Echoes on-line hearing ability\n\nChoose your broadcasts (you want the first hours of 43-W, 43-X & 43-Y, plus hour 2 of 44-W if you'd like to hear Harold Budd's excellent improvisatory performance)\n\nRory Walsh writes: I picked up the catalogue for Anton Corbijn's large retrospective exhibition Everybody Hurts in the Original Soho Bookshop in London. It includes an essay written by Eno about the photographer. The exhibition ran from August 22-October 26 2003 at the Kestner Gesellschaft, Hannover, Germany and will move to Kunsthalle Goeppingen, Goeppingen, Germany from December 14-February 1 2004. Quite what the catalogue is doing in a Remainder Bookstore in Soho is not apparent. Also this month's Q reviews Curiosities Volume 1 and gives it ***. [EnoWeb adds: positive review in The Wire this month too.]\n\nVolta Sounds writes: Some of your readers may be interested to know that we have a limited number of the Accelerator soundtrack CD here at Volta Sounds. More information can be obtained from emailing this address. [EnoWeb adds: this album includes one of Brian's tracks from the movie soundtrack, \"Corrosive Beat Treatment\".]\n\nThomas P. Roddenbery e-mails: A \"literary thriller\" I recently read entitled Black Maps includes references to titles of Eno songs. The characters dine at an Indian restaurant named Taking Tiger Mountain and there is a vegetarian Chinese place called Another Green World. For more information you can go to www.peterspiegelman.com/index2.html\n\nJason Minnix says: I thought you'd like to know that Eno & his daughters appear on John Cale's (excellent) new album, Hobosapiens. The liner notes read: \"[Thanks] to Brian Eno for the groove and his daughters Irial and Darla for the giggles on 'Bicycle'.\" The musician credits clarify said groove as the drum track, though the bass sounds pretty Eno-esque as well.\n\nNot content with having one installation running at London's Science Museum, Brian is going for the double with a new installation in Eindhoven. It started as part of the Introducing Time in Design event on 16th-17th October 2003 and is due to run until December. The conference has been organised by Eternally Yours \"with the goal of sustaining product value\". Marketing jargon alert! Oops, too late. Anyway, at the opening ceremony (16.00 on October 16th) Brian and Alexander Rose gave a talk about The Long Now Foundation. Also taking part will be 75+ other lecturers, workshop leaders, artists and scientists and upwards of 250 visitors. The venue for the installation and 24-hour event is the Temporary Art Centre in Eindhoven, Vonderweg 1, The Netherlands -- you can't miss it, it's opposite the PSV soccer stadion. (Thanks to Annalily van den Broeke of Art Ants)\n\nwww.eternally-yours.org\n\nA bit about Brian's activities there\n\nLong Now Foundation\n\nLydian Bells at the Science Museum until 9th November\n\nNot content with appearing on one radio programme (Mixing It, 10th Oct, see below), Brian is going for the double with a 3-part Echoes series, An Ambient Meditation With Brian Eno. Over three consecutive days, \"we take you into the London studio of Brian Eno, the godfather of ambient music and Grammy-winning producer of U2, David Bowie and many others. Eno reveals new sound designs, previews new music and discusses the art of sound, including a spontaneous Kaos Pad solo. One of our most accurate music prognosticators, Eno talks about a world where music might be less important, but where musical possibilities are unlimited\".

Brian singing in background on \"Forest\"?\n\nMichael Staley e-mails: Not sure if you've mentioned this but ol' Bri is one of the musicians on Seize the Day, the new album (well, I think it came out in May) by Dublin \"singer-songwriter\" Damien Dempsey. No idea what he's doing on it but he's mentioned on Damien's website. It looks like they might have hooked up through Sinead or the U2 boys. ...you've mentioned that Brian has produced a few tracks on Sinead's (final?) album; he also sings with Sinead on \"Love Hurts\" unless I'm very much mistaken.\n\nDamien Dempsey\n\nRobert Wyatt was interviewed by Mixing It co-presenter Robert Sandall to mark the forthcoming release of his (Robert Wyatt's) new album Cuckooland. Brian was involved in a coupla tracks and gets a coupla mentions. There was a stream of the broadcast but it's gone now.\n\nMixing It information page\n\nAttention all completists! Richard Joly writes: a belgian singer, Jeronimo, has done a French language cover of the Bowie-Eno track \"I'm Afraid of Americans\". \"J'ai peur des Américains\" will appear on his album Un monde sans moi (Anorak Supersport Records). And Onur Azeri adds: I was reading the NY Times this weekend and in the \"Sunday Arts\" section, there was mention of a long lost video of Brian Eno performing in his Roxy Music days. This article was only in the print version, though it was listed in the \"Playlist\" weekly column. Maybe it will show up next week. Here are the essentials to paraphrase: The Old Grey Whistle Test ( BBC Video) -- \"A rather dry British TV music show that ran through most of the 70's and 80's... also happened to document some of the most important acts of that era: marvel at performances from a glammed out Brian Eno in Roxy Music, a bugged-out Captain Beefheart...\" etc. I think this can be purchased from the BBC, though I don't know if the footage is available in any other form or collection.\n\nJeronimo\n\nNew York Times courtesy of Google\n\nBrian's new side-project Curiosities Volume 1 is now available exclusively from Enoshop (thanks to Paul Ramsay). Curated by his technical assistant Marlon Weyeneth, it consists of 15 tracks from Brian's extensive library of unreleased music -- all from the last decade unless we're very much mistaken. \"Castro Haze\" and \"Manila Envelope\" appear in mildly different mixes from their Headcandy incarnations and \"Late Evening in Jersey\" (which appeared on the soundtrack of Heat) is a longer version of The Drop's \"Hazard\". Without the pressures of a release deadline these are musical pieces made for their own sake by somebody having a lot of fun doing it. Stand-out tracks for EnoWeb are \"Ambient Savage\", \"Cheeky Hop\" and \"Manila Envelope\". Looking forward to Volume 2!\n\nEnoshop\n\nOn 10th September, Sid Smith and friends dropped in on Brian to collect material for a presentation -- we believe they are hoping to have an installation hosted in Newcastle. Long-time EnoWeb news readers will recall that Sid is also part-way through a book on Brian, in conjunction with Kevin Eden.\n\nSid's diary -- scroll down to the entry for September 10th.\n\nMichael Flaherty writes: On 15 November, The Dance Center of Columbia College presents Merce Cunningham's Dance Group performing \"Pond Way\", a dance to music by Brian Eno (New Ikebukuro for 3 cd players). The set is by Roy Lichtenstein. Cunningham will be present, and ticket sales are brisk. They will also perform a dance set to music by John Cage. (EnoWeb adds: a dance to 4'33\", that'd be novel...)\n\nRolling Stone reports that there's a Talking Heads box-set on the way, out on November 11th. EnoWeb's lack of in-depth knowledge of their oeuvre means we are unable to speculate whether Brian had a hand in any of the previously unreleased material.\n\nRolling Stone\n\nNothing to do with Brian, but October 10th sees the release of a new album by Harold Budd, produced by Daniel Lanois, Together Again For The First Time since, what, The Pearl? Or maybe The White Arcades. Anyway, been a while. The album title is La Bella Vista and it's on the Shout! Factory label. (Thanks to Jim Rainwater).\n\nHere's a page about it on the Shout! Factory site -- you'll need to scroll down a bit.\n\nApparently Brian has provided some sorta Koan element for Dark Symphony, a happening taking place at Ars Electronica 2003, Monday 8th - Thursday 11th September 2003, OMV in Klangpark, Linz, Austria, 10:00 to 22:00 daily.\n\nKelvin's Ambient Deluxe site has some info.\n\nCouldn't find any on the Ars Electronica site but maybe that's just EnoWeb.\n\nUPDATE: SSEYO has some information now on the Tao Group site, which loads rather slowly on EnoWeb's computer. 4 minutes and still not loaded. Hmm, if it's anything like the Press Release we were e-mailed it has a lorra lorra jargon and no mention of Brian, so maybe his contributions didn't make it to the finished cut or he was too busy on his songs album. Ah, clicking on the browser's Stop icon brings up the text. There's a link to a page with more details on Dark Symphony some way down the page. And on that page there's a link to a page on the Ars Electronica site that doesn't actually mention Dark Symphony, but does have the error message \"ADODB.Recordset error '800a0cc1' Item cannot be found in the collection corresponding to the requested name or ordinal. /en/festival/updates/article.asp, line 198\" -- and by an odd coincidence, 198 was in the title of Koan^oasis 198, \"the world's first on-line collaborative Generative Music composition\", back in 1998, with Brian contributing. Spooky or what?\n\nAs ever, we urge you to try out Koan for yourself at www.sseyo.com. It's not all mobile ringtones y'know.\n\nBrian has made a short film to mark Can's Echo Award for lifetime achievement. It will be included on a 2-DVD/1CD package to be released on October 13th 2003 by Spoon/Mute Records. Also there are due to be screenings of the new DVD \"between September 26th and 29th at Sound Unseen in Minneapolis and at the Frank O. Gehry-designed Experience Music Project Museum in Seattle\".

Here's a review.\n\nTate & Cale\n\nRichard Joly has been at it again and writes... the new issue of French magazine Rock N Folk, September 2003, features a very long interview with Bowie. Bowie talks about recording and playing with BE, back in the days circa 'Heroes'. He says he and Brian used to play old 78rpm records of classical music, stuff like Wagner and Beethoven recordings from the 1930s, at 16rpm speed together with BE. DB describes those listening session sounds as \"proto-ambient\" ;-) Again, he speaks very positively of the 1.Outside sessions, saying he wished they had continued the project, but he does not have enough patience to finish it all... \"although Brian probably would have had\".\n\nLong ago, Lester Bangs interviewed Brian... it's one of the most popular interviews in the EnoWeb archive. What we didn't know was that the Paron Saint of Rock Journalists had done a lot of additional work with Brian which he wrote up with his interview as a chapter to a book that was sadly never completed. Now Perfect Sound Forever has the full chapter available for you to read online... it's an intimate glimpse of Brian in his New York years with some personal details from his earlier life. (Thanks to Phil Turnbul)\n\nBrian Eno: A Sandbox In Alphaville at Perfect Sound Forever\n\nRory Walsh writes: this month's Wire has a review of Robert Wyatt's new album Cuckooland (Hannibal HN1468 CD) which features Eno on at least one track. To quote the feature it says '\"Forest\" is a rich goulash of a song, with double-layered chorus and Brian Eno joining the choir for the counter-melody. After a couple of listens you'll be singing too...'\n\nFurther to our mention of Fear X [scored by Brian and J. Peter Schwalm] below, Zak Reddan e-mails: Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn spoke after the premiere of Fear X at the annual Frightfest film festival over the August Bank Holiday at London's Prince Charles cinema. He said that the process had been an organic one with Eno providing and then altering work after seeing it in the context of the film. The film, which starred John Turturro as a shopping mall security guard seeking the murderer of his wife, recalled the work of David Lynch a little too closely for some viewers. One soundtrack moment recalled Music for Onmyoji while others suggested Lynchian/Badalamenti drones.\n\nOoh, scary\n\nRichard Joly is back to say: a mid-price double-CD set is to be released featuring Philip Glass’s orchestral compositions, the Low Symphony and the Heroes Symphony.\n\nDecca Classics\n\nIt has been a quiet month in Lake EnoWeb. With no more exciting developments from the Suffolk Evening Star, and a curious delay in the hatching of Curiosities, EnoWeb prefers to doze and recall the days before a collapsed lung tragically put paid to Brian's solo touring career [poster image by kind permission of Jon Downing].\n\nBrian wrote a book review/commentary for The Observer and Zembla magazine a few weeks back [Thanks to Radiocitizen, Richard Joly, Brian Clevinger, Joseph Buck, Tim Church & others]. He was also quoted in an article about the Clock of the Long Now in The Independent but that never made it to the Indie's site.\n\nObservervations\n\nHardly seems 3 years ago since he last broached the topic, but David Bowie has once again spoken of his fulsome enthusiasm for doing something with the hours of material recorded for 1.Outside. According to Team EnoWeb reporter Richard Joly's reading of the news on bowiewonderworld.com quoting an interview in ICE magazine -- see how EnoWeb exclusively brings you the biggest stories before anybody else!!!! -- David Bowie says: \"The one thing I can truly, seriously think about in the future that I would like to get my teeth into - it's just so daunting - is the rest of the work that Eno and I did when we started to do the Outside album. We did improv for 8 days, and we had something in the area of 20 hours worth of stuff that I just cannot begin to get close to listening to. But there are some absolute gems in there... after we get off the road on this tour, I might bring myself to doing it. Or I'll fail - I'll have written another album.\"\n\nBrian has written the foreword to a new book by Stephen Iliffe, Painting With Sound } the life and music of Hans-Joachim Roedelius. Stephen says: \"The 120-page full colour guide is beautifully illustrated with over 100 photographs and 66 album reviews. It's packed with stories including a chapter on Eno's visits to Germany in 1975-79, plus an analysis of the huge influence that he and Cluster had on each other's music at this critical stage in the development of Ambient music.\" You can read about it here...\n\nwww.meridianguides.com\n\nOther book stuff... Richard Joly draws our attention to Hans-Ulrich Obrist Interviews with Brian as one of the 75 interviewees. Kelvin L. Smith points out that Mark Prendergast has written an updated version of the book The Ambient Century; his site contains the odd phrase \"any necessary death changes\"... perhaps it's an anagram... DVD stuff, HarperCollins e-mails to say that the DVD Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere (which has music by Brian) will be released in the US on 9th September 2004 (available from AandE, Amazon, Deepdiscountdvd, wherever DVDs are sold etc). Update: Nick Day thinks it might be \"Hydrangea enhances ecstasty\".\n\nA quick trawl on Google News turns up a Billboard article that says Sinead O'Connor's final double album includes 3 cover songs produced by Brian. Look out for music store employees on September 9th nursing sore wrists after writing or Dymo-ing labels for She Who Dwells in the Secret Place of the Most High Shall Abide Under the Shadow of the Almighty. Also a New York Times page with a brief review of January 07003 and one from the Daily Telegraph with a brief review of Fear X.\n\nGood eeeevening.... [writes Trevor Haldenby] Just got back from a screening of Stephen Frears' Dirty Pretty Things here in Toronto.....about halfway through the film, two characters are sitting in a car in London listening to an interview on the radio. I could have SWORN that it's Eno being interviewed. You can only hear him clearly as the foreground audio for about five seconds, but he seems to be speaking about funk music....I gathered it was him. What a lovely and distinctive voice! (The cover of Before And After Science was also prominently and repeatedly featured in Frears' earlier record-store flick High Fidelity, as well....perhaps a bit of an Eno-fiend?)\n\nNothing to do with Brian, but the 2-CD ambient collaboration between John Foxx and Harold Budd, Translucence + Drift Music, is out now. Very fine. You should try it.\n\nFinally, Miserygoats e-mails: I thought you might find this amusing - a Kong Kong musician taking Eno's Music For... concept to its (il)logical extremes:\n\njokoi\n\nThey're sending in an inspection team! Yup, you may have thought this story could not get any more exciting, but you were wrong, Buddy! The crisis has reached apocalyptic proportions and many people claim that the Rapture is at hand and these are the Last Days. To those people, EnoWeb says... er... where's everybody gone?\n\nEpisode 3: Evening Star Isn't Just Fripp And Eno -- features the phrase \"his hidden oasis\" which sounds rather like the title of an Eno track...\n\nJohn Emr writes: Did you know that Derek Jarman's Sebastiane [which has soundtrack music from Music For Films and one or two unreleased tracks] has been released on DVD? I got it a few days ago, and the picture quality is much better than the VHS tape.\n\nThere's another Eno CD on the way soon exclusively from Eno Shop. This is the answer to those of us who have always wondered what happens to the music Brian makes between albums but doesn't release. Apparently it all gets stored somewhere... and finally here is an eclectic compilation of some of those tracks: Curiosities Volume 1. There are a few titles that may be familiar to completists, but most will be a surprise. You can hear extracts from three tracks at Eno Shop. We can only hope that this will be the first in a series of albums, and won't share the fate of other Eno-related numbered albums that never made it to a sequel (e.g. Generative Music 1, Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1, 1.Outside, uh... 801 Live...)\n\nEno Shop -- click on the \"newsflash\" graphic\n\n\"Rock Legend\" Brian Eno has hit back at Suffolk Council in the continuing major international news story of this decade. A White House spokesperson has described the Land at the centre of the dispute as a \"logical next step\" for liberation. \"A ruthless dictator lording it over a terrified populace. Ring any bells with anyone? And take a look at these satellite images. To the untrained eye they may look like dumped and discarded furniture and other detritus. But our intelligence agencies tell us that they conceal a much darker purpose. A pre-emptive strike now is the only way to safeguard the future of the civilised world. We'll find the proof afterwards, don't worry.\" A Downing Street spokesman added, \"I have absolutely no doubt that the threat is real and the danger is definite. According to this cast-iron evidence that I have downloaded from the World Wide Internet, 'Satellite's gone, way up to Mars; soon it'll be filled with parking cars', which proves he has links with groups who have advanced rocket propulsion systems. This evidence was in an MP3 file, a format known to be popular with criminals and other disruptive groups -- in other words, groups in opposition to our peaceful, democratic way of life. I am willing to raze Woodbridge to the ground in order to preserve that ideal.\" Brian Eno was unavailable for comment but is understood to have severed all links with his former business partner Jacob Marley. An EnoWeb spokesperson wondered if the story really justified all this build-up, but as with so many things in life, it's too late now.\n\nEpisode 2: A Small Plot Of Land\n\nRory Walsh writes: I had not heard of Simian (I must be getting old) but a quick search on the net and I came across this link to a BBC programme called the Collective (Never heard of that either). In the third clip the boys talk about Uncle Eno coming around while they were recording their last album and giving them pointers.\n\nBorg Assimianation\n\nNothing to do with Brian, but sometime collaborator John Cale has a new EP out. You can hear some of it here:\n\nJohn-Cale.com\n\nBBC 6 Music has some extracts from interviews with David Bowie, including some talk of Low & 'Heroes'.\n\nDB on BBC\n\nYou trust EnoWeb to bring you the most earth-shattering news.

It was under 4 hours in its pre edited state. and it didn't get longer after it was mixed. the track is from after the mix sessions at westside studios in london in the summer of '94. the band was db, eno, mike garson, erdal kizilcay, sterling cambell and myself. that piece is an excerpt from the larger 3 hour + plus improvised opus we created in late march /early april '94. we hoped that it would have come out intact and uncompromised by financial/ comercial pressures. it would have been a very serious musical statement (and maybe even pissed more people off than tin machine). instead it was chopped up and used as short character pieces on \"outside\". it's easy to tell which songs those are on outside by reading the songwriting credits.(any song on that cd with 5 writers or more came from group improvisation). gary oldman and i used to comiserate on how your best stuff.... your most real and honest work seems to be what ends up on the cutting room floor. uh huh. we ended up recording 4 more commercial \"songs\" in nyc with a different band (carlos, yossi fine, joey baron and myself). ah, compromise...''

Lydian Bells appears in the Treat Yourself exhibition, which opened on Friday 23rd May 2003 and is scheduled to run until the autumn/fall. Treat Yourself is part of a series of collaborative exhibitions mounted by the Wellcome Trust. It examines the activities that people have chosen to enhance their health, looking back over 300 years or so to set modern preoccupations in historical context. The show takes place in the Science Museum's Wellcome temporary exhibition gallery on the first floor (towards the front of the building). You can also see the first prototype of the Clock of the Long Now in the Museum's Making the Modern World gallery. Nearest tube: South Kensington. Admission to the Museum, and to the exhibition, is free.\n\nwww.wellcome.ac.uk/treatyourself will enable you to find out more, hear a sound extract from Lydian Bells and read some of Brian's essay on the piece\n\nThe new January 07003 CD is now available from Enoshop and the Long Now Foundation.

About 3/4 down, we see:\n\nsTc: I've heard rumor that Brian Eno and Jimmy Page have been friends of Roger's through the years and/or still are... do you know of any truth to this?\n\nIB: I know that in one of the books on Roger's life it is claimed that both Eno and Page have expressed desire to work with Rog. and I assume that this was the reason for the rumor starting. I don't know fore sure but I wouldn't imagine either men have ever met Roger.\n\ninterview\n\nR Yacuk writes: Here's a little snippet. Sound and Vision, a hi-fi audio/home theater magazine, has published a wishlist of albums they believe deserve re-release in multichannel (DVD-A/SACD) format. On Land, as well as Joshua Tree, are listed. Hmmm, I wonder if the remastering of the ambient stuff I read about 2 years ago is being delayed for this reason? One can only hope...\n\nsoundandvisionmag\n\nMark Harrop writes: I found this and thought about you. No idea why :-)\n\nglam -- a variation on Minesweeper.
