        "text": "‘In total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly’ (Eno & Schmidt, 1979) It is time for a reconsideration of Eno’s visual projects. This article considers how Brian Eno has used simple but innovative ideas, programmes and processes to inform his films, apps and installation work, and how they have been disseminated. Avoiding spectacle, noise and complexity, Eno and his collaborators, has produced an array of intriguing and engaging art works. In The New York Times Style Magazine, Eno stated that he ‘was trying to make visual art become more like music, in that it changed the way music changes’ (2013). Collaborators Kingsley Marshall and Rupert Loydell use remix, juxtaposition and creative writing, along with more traditional research methods, to cast light onto the ways in which appropriation, process and collaboration have informed Eno’s creative output. They use Eno’s words, drawn from interviews and his own writing, along with critiques of his work and writing by those who have inspired him, to consider how Eno creates his quiet rooms and visual music. Each consecutive response was dictated by the turn of a card selected from the third edition of the Oblique Strategies deck issued in 1979.\n\nBrian Eno is a famous a musician, producer and artist known for his endeavors in rock music who has devoted the latter part of his career to ambient and generative work. There are a few publications regarding his work (Albiez & Pattie, 2016; Sheppard, 2009; Tamm, 1988), but they do not focus exclusively on his generative processes. The only paper that details Eno&#39;s generative music only addresses the concepts of generative music and describes Eno&#39;s apps (Marshall & Loydell, 2017). The paper focuses more on his apps and it does not present a detailed correlation between his background/ influences to his work. This paper bridges that specific gap, by detailing Eno&#39;s school background, his influences, generative processes and how he moved on from traditional to more technological approaches.\n\nA 16 page essay on Brian Eno's installations and how, in reflection, they relate to the Long Now. Eno coined the term “Long Now” from which the Long Now Foundation acquires it’s name. He is a founding member and has, even in his first installations, always shown an approach to slower/better thinking. This was a student essay submitted for an Art History class.\n\nWith the recent publication of the edited collection Brian Eno: Oblique Music (Albiez & Pattie, 2016) and the distribution of Brian Eno’s 26th solo studio album Reflection in 2017 on vinyl, CD and as an innovative software application, the time is ripe for a reconsideration of the way in which software has been used by the musician, composer, record producer and visual artist Brian Eno. This paper explores how Eno has used simple but innovative ideas and processes to inform his music over the course of his career, and considers how his work with collaborators – specifically the musician and software designer Peter Chilvers – has converged with the emergence of touchscreen technologies and modes of distribution. We will demonstrate how Apple’s App Store global distribution platform has further disseminated Eno’s ideas of ‘generative music’ to a wider audience through he and Chilvers’ Bloom (2008), Trope (2009/2015), Scape (2012) and Reflection (2017a) software applications for Apple’s iPhone and iPad, and the impact on the distribution and reception of Eno’s own music. Echoing Eno’s own processes of appropriation, remix and collaboration the authors wrote the paper through exchanges dictated by the turn of a card selected from the third edition of the Oblique Strategies deck, issued by Eno and Peter Schmidt in 1979."
