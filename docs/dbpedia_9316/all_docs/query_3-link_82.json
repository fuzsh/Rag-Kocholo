Suzanna Smith numbers among that rare ilk. That Smith sounds like Lee — slightly breathy and warmly sensual with a hint of huskiness — is undeniable, but the parallels extend much further. Lee’s ability to not just caress a ballad but smother it in mink has seldom been matched. She was also a sage swinger — never too much, never too little — as well as a first-rate songwriter. Smith checks all those boxes.”\n\n— Christopher Louden, Jazz Times\n\nLee Bloom, piano, Noel Jewkes, sax & clarinet, Ruth Davies, bass, Leon Joyce, drums\n\nTickets: $25 per show\n\nWe strongly recommend, arriving before 30 minutes before the show to secure your seat.

Their LIVE IN ITALY recording, which garnered a Grammy nomination in 2022, is evidence of their primacy.\n\nWhat makes the meeting of minds extra special now is the addition of saxophonist Bob Mintzer, acclaimed composer, arranger, and founding member of the Yellowjackets. A long-time associate to all, Mintzer elevates the group’s collective mastery in a new project, THE MCINTOSH SESSIONS, a direct-to-tape recording representing the partnership between hi-end audio giants McIntosh Laboratory and Sterling Sound. At the heart of this captured performance is a vibrant intimacy that speaks volumes about the singular power of jazz and pure, reproduced sound.\n\nErskine and company revealed this immediacy in the studio. But, in fact, they bring it to the stage each time they play.\n\nOnline Tickets: $35 per show\n\nTickets at Door: $40 per show\n\nWe strongly recommend, arriving before 30 minutes before the show to secure your seat.

Blades\n\nIf told about a band that consisted of only keyboards and drums, one wouldn’t be faulted for thinking, “Where’s the rest of the group?” But one listen to the funky California-based duo Amendola Vs. Blades and their new album, ‘Everybody Wins’ and all fears will be assuaged. Wil Blades on Hammond organ and clavinet delivers cutting solos and deep bass lines that make for a thick stew of soulful harmony and daring improvisation, while Scott Amendola behind the kit creates beats that are simply unstoppable, simultaneously pushing the duo to heights unknown and sending the listener into a joyful sonic trance.\n\nThe musicians first united in 2006 to perform the Duke Ellington album ‘Far East Suite’ and the ball hasn’t stopped rolling since. And despite a little distance on the horizon—Blades recently relocated to L.A.—there is no end in sight for the duo that sounds like an eight-piece band. The extra-musical bond keeps growing, too.\n\n“The ‘Vs.’ is about how we mess with each other,” says Amendola. “It’s one fun part of our personal connection. Our friendship. We take the art of what we do seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. Gotta have fun, mess with each other . . . and keep improvising!”\n\nOtis McDonald\n\nFrom the mind and ears of producer/multi-instrumentalist, Joe Bagale, comes a sound that is fresh but tangibly rooted in nostalgia. The name is Otis McDonald. The mission? Good Music. In 2015, Bagale released 80 tracks for free, under the name Otis McDonald. In 2019 Bagale released a full length album, “People Music,” in collaboration with his YouTube subscribers and took over Studio D at the historic Hyde Street Studios, in San Francisco. Whether it’s performing, writing, producing, or coming up with new ways to engage with his fans, Otis McDonald plans on giving the world a dose of the past while always looking to the future.\n\nOnline Tickets: $35 per show\n\nTickets at Door: $40 per show\n\nWe strongly recommend, arriving before 30 minutes before the show to secure your seat.

The sultry honesty in her voice is as raw as her lyrical stories of love, life and self-discovery. A graduate of the prestigious Berklee College of Music, Kane has sold out numerous residencies at Yoshi’s Oakland and SFJAZZ as well as performances at Minton’s Playhouse (NYC), Chris’s Jazz Cafe (Philly), French Quarter Festival (New Orleans), Concord Pavillion, The Mint (LA), Fillmore Jazz Festival and many others.\n\nIn her debut at Keys, Kane will delve into the music of a primary influence with her tribute to an unsurpassed master of musical storytelling, Nancy Wilson. Wilson (1937 –2018) moved effortlessly between jazz, R&B, and pop settings, but her entire approach was shaped by a deep feel for jazz, a path paved by Cannonball Adderley—a charismatic alto saxophonist who was always looking to give fellow musicians a boost. In making the jump from the indie label Riverside to the powerhouse Capitol Records, one of Adderley’s first moves was recording the 1962 hit Nancy Wilson/Cannonball Adderley, an album that established Wilson as a major new voice.\n\nOnline Tickets: $35 per show\n\nTickets at Door: $40 per show\n\nWe strongly recommend, arriving before 30 minutes before the show to secure your seat.

During that time, I developed a special affection for the music of the Pacific Jazz Label, an LA-based record company that started in 1952 and carried on through the 60’s as World Pacific Records. West Coast jazz, people called it. And it was a thing. It was characterized often by the lack of a chordal instrument even though there were pianists and guitarists on the label, as well. The music itself was usually not difficult or intricate and the playing was more about sounding cool than blowing minds with awesome virtuosity. It was laid back and felt good. Some of the cats on the roster – Shorty Rogers, Shelly Manne, Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, Russ Freeman, Hampton Hawes, Bud Shank, Paul Desmond, Jim Hall, Chico Freeman, Jimmy Giuffre, Victor Feldman and Cal Tjader. The music reminds me of taking a drive down Highway 1 on a sunny day, of GoldenGate Park, of the beautiful redwoods of Muir Woods and Big Sur, of concerts by the sea on a Sunday afternoon. Even though the label was in LA, the music was the soundtrack for my time in Oakland and San Francisco.\n\nDred Scott, piano, Rob Sudduth, tenor sax, John Wiitala, bass, Smith Dobson, drums\n\nTickets: $25 per show\n\nWe strongly recommend, arriving before 30 minutes before the show to secure your seat.

His first musical influence was his father Otis, a well-known drummer who passed the music bug on to Calvin. In 1971, he signed with Black Jazz label, released a pair of albums and played in the Ray Charles Orchestra. Keys’ unique phrasing and his ability to balance sophisticated jazz harmonics with tough R&B and soul grooves were showcased nightly in the Charles band. By 1975, Keys had relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he became — and remained — an avid participant in its jazz community. He worked in live settings and recording sessions with John Handy, Bobby Hutcherson, Eddie Marshall, Bob Braye, Ed Kelly, Eddie Duran, Bruce Forman, Junius Simmons, and Eddie Moore.\n\nCome join us at Keys Jazz Bistro to celebrate and remember the magnificent life and career of Calvin Keys.

After decades of performing around the globe alongside a who’s who of talented collaborators, while quietly accumulating a series of thoughtful and well respected recordings, she still continues to challenge her boundaries and creative potential. Yet it is her deep connection to her roots and the community that nurtured her talent that reveal her artistry. Utilizing a wide and diverse repertoire, Stallings music expresses a profound spiritual essence combined with a love for that community that supported her. “This music is deep. lt is a life force. lt is a history of people’s lives and struggles. It is not just a bunch of notes., she explains. For this historic debut performance at Keys, Mary returns to the Neighborhood where she first began her artistic journey, decades ago.\n\nOnline Tickets: $35 per show\n\nTickets at Door: $40 per show\n\nWe strongly recommend, arriving before 30 minutes before the show to secure your seat.
