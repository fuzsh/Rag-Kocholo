        "text": "Obituary of Bob F. Foster\n\nBob F. Foster, 73, of Denton, Maryland passed away peacefully with his daughters by his side on Tuesday, February 20, 2024 at Tidal Health Nanticoke in Seaford, Delaware. Bob was born in Neptune and was a life-long resident of Freehold/Howell area until moving to Denton to live with his daughter in 2020. He worked as a corrections officer for the Monmouth County Sheriff’s Office retiring in 2016. Prior to being a corrections officer, Bob retired from Brockway Glass. With a calling of the outdoors, he took great pleasure in nature, hunting and trapping with his life-long friends, Ray and Wayne. Bob had a passion for Ford Broncos, was handy fixing cars and would never miss going to a gun show. Yet he most relished his time at Federici’s enjoying a veal parmigiana dinner.\n\nBob was predeceased by his siblings, Bill Foster, Jeanette Gibson Nielsen, and Wilma Sammis. He is survived by his three daughters, Kelly Foster of Lakehurst, Kimberly Foster of Lakewood, and Karey Dawidowicz and her husband, Andrew of Denton; eleven grandchildren; a great-grandchild; his brother, Bert Foster of South Carolina; three nieces; and two nephews."
