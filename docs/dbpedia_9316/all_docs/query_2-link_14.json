He was born in Martinsville, Virginia on April 16, 1953, to the late Cecil Akers Handy and Beulah Marshall Handy. David enjoyed riding his Harley, NASCAR, “picking,” yard sales, auctions, and hanging out in his store, “Rusty Gold.” He always kept everyone laughing with all the stories he would tell. David touched and loved so many people that he encountered. He will be sorely missed by all who knew and loved him.\n\nLeft to cherish the special memories of Mr. David Handy are his children, Kevin Handy (Michelle) of Stuart, Virginia, Trey Handy (Bambie) of Martinsville, Virginia, Amber Huffman (Lucas Terry) of Patrick Springs, Virginia, Sara Tatum of Dinwiddie, Virginia, Nickie Handy of Chesapeake, Virginia, Tia Strempski of South Hill, VA; a bonus son, Clay Gregson (Angel) of Ararat, Virginia; 19 grandchildren; three sisters, Jean Pendleton of Stuart, Virginia, Patsy Fain of Stuart, Virginia, Sue Collins (Jerry) of Stuart, Virginia; one brother, Cecil Handy (Freda) of Martinsville, Virginia; his love and life partner, Amy Jo Gregson of Meadows of Dan, Virginia; several nieces and nephews; and many dear friends.\n\nThe family will receive friends on Thursday, August 1, 2024, at Moody Funeral Home in Stuart from 5:00 P.M. – 7:00 P.M. A memorial service will be held at a later date. Online condolences may be made by visiting www.moodyfuneralservices.com."
