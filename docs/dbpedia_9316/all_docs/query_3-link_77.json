I’m a current 1L at Wayne Law and very excited to return to the university. I originally attended Wayne State in 2014 for an undergraduate degree but never finished. Initially, a biology student with (very) poor math skills, physics, and economics double KO’d me with such embarrassment that I fled the state. While away, I had an amazing experience living in the Bay Area of California and the not-so-amazing experience of moving to rural Georgia. While away, I received a Bachelor of the Arts in Political Science from Arizona State University online and an associate degree in Arabic. Since moving back in December 22’, I’ve been actively engaged with local nonprofits and communities. Specifically, I work closely with Congress of Communities, 482Forward, and I am a current board member at Urban Neighborhood Initiatives. My hobbies include rollerskating, making Spotify playlists I’ll never use, and pretending to enjoy the taste of black coffee.\n\nFatima Algahaim\n\nCollege of Engineering Representative\n\nhp5430@wayne.edu\n\nFatima Algahaim is a second-year Computer Science major at Wayne State University who has a fervent passion for current events, diverse literature, and making positive impacts.
