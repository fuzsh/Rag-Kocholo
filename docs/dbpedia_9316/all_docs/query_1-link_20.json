        "text": "Duke: The Official John Wayne Movie Book\n\nThis beautiful collector’s book is a celebration of John Wayne and the films he made. It includes a foreword by Ann-Margret, an afterword by Leonard Maltin and hundreds of photos from the set and behind the scenes.\n\nFrom capsule reviews of of Duke’s lesser known films to extensive analyses and stories of his fan-favorite work, this book details all 169 of Duke’s movies, from long forgotten gems to the Hollywood classics that made John Wayne into the world’s biggest movie star. You’ll also find full-color and black-and-white photos along with movie posters, lobby cards, costumes, collectibles and more, including a number of full-spread photos that showcase Duke in all his wide screen glory.\n\nFor general movie fans or die-hard Duke-lovers, this hard cover book is a fantastic showcase of the film legend and his work.\n\n$25.00\n\nJohn Wayne Was Here\n\nJohn Wayne worked on film sets around the globe. This book follows that trail, from his beginnings on the Fox backlot to his final filming in Lone Pine, California. Locations in Mexico, Normandy, Rome, Madrid, London, Ireland and Libya are covered along with his favorite vacation spots in Hawaii, Acapulco, Greece, Monaco and the Hollywood hot-spots he frequented. Anecdotes revisit his most famous scenes, including Rooster Cogburn’s charge in True Grit (1969) and Davy Crockett’s last stand in The Alamo (1960). Production details describe how San Diege stood in for Iwo Jima, how Old Tucson was turned into El Dorado, and how Genghis Kahn ruled over the deserts of Utah. Never before published photos present then-and-now views in this first of any kind guided tour for film location hunters and Wayne aficionados. (#141)\n\n$45.00"
