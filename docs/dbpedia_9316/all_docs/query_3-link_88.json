        "text": "Bruce stepped out of the zeta onto thick, lush grass. The priority call was still blinking on his gauntlet, settled by a press of his palm.\n\n“You’re here,” Hal Jordan said, stepping forward to greet him. The Lantern’s uniform was badly burned on one side, his left hand limp and blistered. Bruce was out of practice reading his micro expressions, but the twitch of his split lip indicated something near relief.\n\n“Sitrep?”\n\nHal made a face at the command, but acquiesced. “Diana and Barry are confronting the asshole down there,” he said, pointing down to the field. “Apparently he was chill until Diana showed up. Took one look at her and flipped out, screaming about something. Now we’re babysitting Mr. Lasers.”\n\nAs always, Hal’s sitreps were delightfully unfocused on key details. Bruce scanned the grassland below their vantage point, letting the cowl’s lenses focus on the three figures in the distance.\n\n“One meta?” he asked Hal.\n\n“Just that asshole,” Hal replied, shifting so he was slightly in front of Bruce. His ring glittered on his right hand, betraying his unease. “I think he’s wearing an actual American flag as a cape. Can you believe that?”\n\nBruce tapped at his gauntlet, informing the Watchtower he was on scene. They didn’t usually call him down for containment calls -- ever -- but something in his gut told him this one was different.\n\nMaybe it was the sound of this meta’s voice, ringing through the clearing with all of Clark’s strength. It dug into his ears, sharp and unnatural where Clark’s projected voice had always been deep and soothing.\n\n“Good news?” Hal said when he didn’t reply, “I don’t think he’s much of a threat to Earth. He doesn’t seem to know where he is. And he’s not flying off for any population centers…”\n\nThat was good news. Bruce watched as Diana’s armored shin caught the unknown meta in the chin, snapping the man’s head back with an audible crack.\n\n“And the bad news?”\n\n“He’s not exactly keen on going back with us for tea,” Hal said, shrugging his good shoulder. “Every time one of us was about to pin him, he flipped around at the last second and went for the laser eyes. Gnarly stuff.”\n\nBruce scanned the blackened pieces of Hal’s uniform, studying the rapidly blistering burns underneath. For a meta to burn a full-powered Lantern through a construct, even by surprise, they had to be powerful.\n\nOn the grassland below their vantage point, Diana let out a ringing battle cry. The meta went flying across the field, caught and pinned into the earth by Barry’s blurry hands. He was up again almost instantly, bucking off Barry’s hold like it was nothing more than an inconvenience.\n\n“Oh good, you’re both here already.”\n\nBruce didn’t look away at the sound of Ollie’s voice, punctuated by the hum of a closing zeta. He felt Hal adjust his stance, shifting slightly to ensure he could cover both mortal League members with a construct, if needed.\n\n“What’s he scanning as?” Ollie asked, peering over Bruce’s shoulder. “The ‘Tower was kinda vague.”\n\n“Anomaly, most likely from another dimension,” Hal said. The Lantern abruptly lifted his ring up, forming a glowing green barrier around them. “Heads up, he’s getting close again. You do not wanna rumba with those laser beams.”\n\nOllie shuffled in closer as the meta’s eyes turned into fiery beams, tearing through the field with the intensity of two small suns. The beams caught the edge of the barrier as Diana re-engaged the meta, digging gouges into the green projection.\n\nBruce said nothing, standing silently at Hal’s side. This close to the other man, the strain on the projection was obvious. He was sweating under his singed uniform, beads of sweat rolling down the back of his neck and into his collar.\n\n“Fucking hell,” Ollie swore, sounding reluctantly impressed. “Those things are strong.”\n\nOn the field, Barry and Diana split off around the meta, dividing his attention. The beams died down, leaving the meta’s eyes a burning, unworldly red.\n\n“I might have lied,” Hal said between gritted teeth. The projection dissipated around them with none of his usual finesse. “He’s a threat. Just not to any civilian centers.”\n\nBruce tapped into his comm, sending his notes up to Cyborg in the Watchtower. He cast an assessing gaze over the meta -- or what he could see of him, from this distance -- and reached for his belt.\n\nHal didn’t say anything as Bruce injected the hypo into his burned side. He didn’t need to. It was the most they could do without returning to the medbay at the Watchtower -- take an edge off the pain, and stay as functional as possible in the field until then.\n\n“You call Big Blue yet?” Ollie asked, casually sorting through his quiver with gloved fingertips. “Not that I’m doubting the game plan here, man. It’s just that Diana doesn’t strike me as the kind of person to play with her food, if you know what I mean.”\n\nAcross the field, Diana slammed her bracers together, directing the energy into the center of the meta’s chest. The meta went crashing into the dirt, his striped cape flipping up over his face as he tumbled backward.\n\nHis comm pinged with Victor’s update, vibrating against the inside of his wrist.\n\nSuperman on his way. ETA <1 minute.\n\n“Superman is en route,” Bruce said, tapping his comm so the announcement went to all operatives. “Hold all positions.”\n\nThe meta pushed to his feet, realigning his cape over his shoulders with a visible sneer. He looked out across the field, red eyes narrowing on their command point like it was a particularly interesting bug.\n\n“Oh fuck,” Ollie said, just above a whisper. “He heard you, didn’t he?”\n\nBruce stared back at the meta, quickly evaluating his options. He made the hand signal for hold position near his hip, praying both Hal and Ollie saw it.\n\nAnytime now, Clark.\n\nThe meta was frozen on the field, eyes locked onto Bruce with an eerie intensity. Diana and Barry stood on either side of him, visibly wary as their opponent suddenly stopped fighting.\n\n“Hal,” Ollie said, slightly strained. “Now would be a good time to put that shield back up, I think.”\n\n“Right.” Hal raised his arm, brow furrowing. The projection flared back to life around them, thicker than it had been before. It looked suspiciously like a bank vault, from the inside.\n\n“Why are we here again?” Ollie asked, directing the question at Bruce. He’d pulled out a half dozen arrows Bruce knew he reserved only for the worst case, a handful of various explosives and meta-deterrents Bruce would be reluctant to trust in anyone else’s hands.\n\n“Tactical expertise,” Bruce said, dropping his wrist as he sent the final message to Victor.\n\n“Yeah, but my tactical expertise is in archery. And firing an arrow at that,” Ollie said, gesturing at the meta through Hal’s projection, “doesn’t exactly seem like a good idea.”\n\n“Are you butt-fuckers gonna hide in that little cracker jack box all day, or what?”\n\nThe meta’s voice echoed through the field, bouncing off their shield. Bruce felt an involuntary shiver work itself down his spine, his body preparing for a perceived threat.\n\nThat was four similarities, now -- four things the meta seemed to share with Clark, in base powers. Too many similarities to ignore.\n\nFlight. Super strength. Laser vision. Vocal projection.\n\nThe suit was a garish parody of Superman’s Kryptonian design, complete with embellishments -- gold shoulder guards and a long, striped cape -- that spoke to how infrequently the meta found himself in combat on a routine basis.\n\nThe man looked nothing like Clark, a solitary relief among the mounting similarities. His hair was a yellowed, unnatural blonde; his eyes were a muddy blue, and held none of Clark’s Kryptonian sheen. And from far away, even Bruce’s lenses could see the lines of age -- or stress -- on the meta’s face.\n\nA sonic boom heralded Clark’s arrival, echoing across the field and deep into the ground under their feet. Hal’s thick projection shrank into a more versatile shield in front of them, the Lantern letting out a relieved breath.\n\nBruce stepped around Hal’s projection, tapping into his comm as Clark slowly descended in front of the meta, cape rippling behind him.\n\nSuperman on ground. Will update.\n\n“Well howdy,” the meta drawled, staring up at Clark’s outline against the sun. Bruce adjusted his lenses, zooming in to see the conversation better. “You must be Superman . Nice name -- I always thought super was a little on the nose, myself, but hey. Sometimes you have to get right to the point, you know?”\n\nClark’s jaw clenched. His eyes were like flint, expression brooking no argument. He’d likely heard the butt fuckers comment through Bruce’s comm line, then.\n\n“You’re trespassing on this Earth and in this reality,” Clark said, finally touching down on the grass in front of the meta. “Surrender to the Justice League’s custody. I won’t ask again.”\n\nBarry and Diana flanked Clark on either side like they’d practiced in sims. Bruce felt a surge of pride in his chest, reminding himself to compliment Barry on it later.\n\n“Hey, I’m sure we don’t need to do all that,” the meta said, pointedly ignoring Barry and Diana. He held out a gloved hand for Clark to shake. “Look, we got off on the wrong foot. I’m Homelander. It’s an honor to meet another Supe of our caliber. Really.”\n\n“Supe?” Oliver muttered next to Bruce, dubious. “Is he serious?”\n\n“Maybe it’s their term there,” Hal said, shrugging one shoulder. “What kind of name is Homelander, though? I mean, what is this, the Cold War?”\n\nBruce didn’t miss the way Homelander’s eyes flicked back to them, narrowing in on Hal’s face over Clark’s shoulder. He clearly hadn’t liked that remark.\n\nClark, the faithful diplomat, inclined his head briefly to the meta. He didn’t shake the offered hand, fists still clenched at his sides. “You’re under arrest. Homelander.”\n\n“For what? Tussling with a few of your team members?” Homelander let out an exaggerated laugh, gesturing with one thick glove at the field. “It wasn’t personal, if that’s what you’re all worried about. I was looking for you, to be honest. Well, this universe’s version of me, to be clear, which I’m taking a wild guess is you.”\n\nDiana narrowed the gap between her and Clark’s left side, boots silent on the grass. “Why?”\n\n“Why what, Greek freak?” Homelander asked, giving Diana a dismissive once-over. “You know, you’re really something. You remind me a lot of someone I know back home. But I’m guessing you don’t munch cunt like she does, right?”\n\n“Oh fuck,” Oliver swore, thumbing nervously at his bow string. “Big Blue isn’t gonna like that.”\n\nHal’s lips twitched. “Diana probably took it as a compliment.”\n\n“Yeah, tell that to the Kansan farmboy over there,” Ollie rebutted, gesturing with his chin back to the field.\n\nAcross from Homelander, Clark’s eyes were starting to spark red, Krypton’s fires burning from deep within. His head tilted a fraction to one side, an obvious tell if one knew to look for it.\n\nBruce’s heart skipped a beat as Homelander’s head tilted the same way, scanning Clark back the exact same way he was being scanned. Vitals, strengths, and weaknesses.\n\n“Last chance,” Clark said, deceptively mild. His cape rippled at his heels, weighted and fluid where Homelander’s cape remained stiff and wrinkled against his calves.\n\n“Oh, this is gonna be good.” A grin stretched across Homelander’s wide mouth. “Nothing like going up against a lesser version of myself. You know, this is the first dimension where I actually found someone who even--”\n\nFaster than Bruce’s lenses could register, Clark’s fist caught Homelander under the jaw, right where Diana’s hit had landed earlier. The meta flew across the grass, crashing into an unconscious heap a full football field away.\n\nBruce zoomed in on his lenses, scanning the meta for any signs of consciousness. If the meta was anything like Clark, he’d be back up in a few moments.\n\n“Well,” Barry said, shifting awkwardly on his feet. “That was anticlimactic.”\n\nClark made a face, shaking out his fist. He looked back over his shoulder, locking eyes with Bruce across the distance.\n\n“I see what you mean,” the Kryptonian said softly into the comm link between them. He knew Bruce had been listening in. “He was…different.”\n\nHal dropped his shield entirely, leaning into the waiting arm Ollie had put out. Bruce left the Lantern to Ollie and his field medical kit, stalking through the grass toward the crater Homelander’s body had created.\n\nThe man looked far younger unconscious. He was out cold on his back in the dirt, guarded by a fierce-looking Diana on one side. She watched as Bruce pressed a sliver of Kryptonite from his belt to the meta’s bare neck, saying nothing as it was swiftly replaced.\n\nBruce ignored Clark’s worried look as he pulled the power-dampening cuffs from his belt, attaching them to Homelander’s wrists. He scanned the meta, noting the indicator light on the cuffs.\n\nVulnerable to power dampening restraints. Not a similarity.\n\n“So,” Barry blurred into place next to him, bending over to stare at Homelander. “Is he a meta? Some kind of Kryptonian?”\n\n“Meta,” Bruce said, glancing down at his scanner. “Not Kryptonian. He’s depowered with the cuffs, but not entirely. One of you will have to hold him on the zeta up.”\n\n“Nose goes,” Barry said, reaching up to tap at his nose. The speedster turned to Diana and Clark, who traded a look over his head.\n\n“We’re lucky Supes was able to get him,” Barry continued, filling the silence like he often did. “I’m sure Wonder Woman and I could’ve gotten him eventually, but that was a workout! He was fast. Like you are, Superman!”\n\n“Luck had nothing to do with it,” Bruce said, feeling their gazes shift to him. He didn’t back down from the point, staring pointedly at Clark’s chin. “This is why we have contingencies.”\n\nClark inhaled, eyes briefly closing. He nodded. “Yeah, I know.”\n\n“Get him up to the Watchtower,” Bruce said, closing his scanner with a click. “We’ll continue the scans up there.”\n\nClark reached down to pull the unconscious Homelander to his feet. The meta began stirring as he was jostled, the cuffs’ indicator light indicating an increased power draw.\n\n“--really…” Homelander slurred, eyes fluttering, “--let him talk t’you like th’t…?”\n\nClark’s expression tightened. He yanked on the cuffs, tugging until Homelander was upright under his own power.\n\n“Yeah. I do.”\n\nIt was Clark’s turn for interrogation, as the technical arresting officer in the case. Still, he didn’t protest as Bruce swept ahead into the Watchtower, queueing up the private medbay and interrogation room.\n\nDiana and Clark frogmarched the still-dazed Homelander into the medbay a few moments after Bruce arrived, setting him down on the cot. Bruce checked the cuffs for the indicator light, stepping back to start the scan.\n\nHomelander watched him out of the narrowed slits of his eyes, the blue of his irises dulled by the fluorescent bulbs. His age was even more apparent under harsh lighting, somewhere in the mid-forties by human years.\n\nThere were wrinkles around his mouth and eyes that spoke to a habit of over-emoting. The roots of his hair were dyed, Bruce noted. Homelander had been a natural blonde once, perhaps. Human enough to need hair dye now, at the very least.\n\nIt was relieving, in a way, seeing the tiny differences that still set him apart from Clark. There were no lines on Clark’s face, no grey hidden in his hair. And there wouldn’t be for a very, very long time.\n\n“You g’na stare at me all day?” Homelander slurred, still looking at Bruce. The scan was nearly complete. “You…sick fuck. M…supe…”\n\nBruce was, in fact, going to stare at him all day. A choice he was swiftly going to regret, he realized. There was something about Homelander’s disgust for him that nagged at his mind. Something personal about the way he viewed perceived weakness.\n\nIt would all come out in the interrogation. It always did, when Bruce put his mind to it.\n\n“Human male, enhanced, mid-forties,” Bruce read out from his tablet, stepping around Homelander’s cot with a brief, surveying look at the man. “Vulnerability to…zinc and other Earth compounds. Minor muscle atrophy noted. Possibly from lack of full development during childhood. Other--”\n\n“The suit is padded,” Clark cut in, staring at Homelander’s legs. “You’re wearing a padded suit?”\n\nThat was the wrong question. Homelander abruptly sat up on the bed, eyes flashing red. “You want to say that again to my face, you pathetic, knock-off--”\n\n“Kal,” Diana interrupted, holding Clark’s gaze. She didn’t grace Homelander with a fraction of her attention. “We will leave Bruce to his interrogation.”\n\n“Bruce is going to be a puddle of piss when you come back,” Homelander said, suddenly invigorated by his replenished rage. Still, he wavered slightly on the cot. “You know that, right? I don’t play nice with humans. If you’re lucky, I’ll leave him alive for you when you come back. Just so you can say goodbye.”\n\nClark stared at Homelander for a beat, then turned back to Bruce. “Are you done in here?”\n\nBruce nodded. “Move him to the next room.”\n\n“Again with the commands,” Homelander said, growing more bold. “Does he tell you to suck his cock too? And I bet you get down on your knees for it too. It’s a nice cock, for a human. I’ll admit that much.”\n\nDiana gave Bruce a look as she stepped back out of the room. Bruce held back the smug twitch of his lips he’d usually allow, standing out of the way as Clark hauled Homelander to his feet.\n\nThe interrogation room was cold and impersonal, well-lit to the point of being uncomfortable. In the bright light, Clark’s features looked like they were cut from pure crystal.\n\nHomelander sagged slightly into the chair, still clearly smarting from the beat-down he’d taken. His cuffs were chained to the table, immobilizing him. Still, his pride kept him from slumping completely, chin brought up as Bruce took his seat across from him.\n\nOnce upon a time, Bruce could’ve been intimidated by a stare like that. Homelander’s features were handsome, twisted only by rage and time. He was regal in his own way -- padded suit and all.\n\nClark’s hand closed around his shoulder, squeezing. Bruce didn’t react, waiting until the Kryptonian had left the room to open his mouth.\n\n“You don’t like humans,” he started, an easy softball for Homelander to bat away.\n\n“Why wouldn’t I?”\n\nBruce raised his eyebrows, letting the silence speak for itself. Homelander’s face twitched, indicating just how much he liked being treated like a misbehaving child.\n\nIt was a pity, then, that Bruce had years of experience doing exactly that.\n\n“Look, Bruce,” Homelander said, a flash of weak charisma lighting up his features. “It’s been really nice chatting, but I’d love to speak with Superman if he’s still available. This kids’ table bullshit is a little tiring.”\n\nFrom the way his eyes flashed intermittently, Bruce guessed he was trying to spy through the walls of the interrogation room into the Watchtower. Since Bruce had reinforced these walls himself, he knew the attempts were unsuccessful.\n\n“Is it?” Bruce asked, parodying Homelander’s earlier rebuttal to his question. “I thought you were going to make me -- and I quote -- a puddle of piss before Superman came back.”\n\nThat seemed to snap Homelander’s attention back to him fully. The meta stared at him, a sneer lifting his upper lip. “Maybe I’m just drawing out the fun.”\n\n“Or stalling,” Bruce offered instead, “Since you realized that, not only can you not get out of those cuffs -- you can’t even see out of this room.”\n\n“Everything I want to see is right in front of me,” Homelander growled, leaning forward slightly. “I can see your pathetic little heart. That hardware wrapped around your spine is awful fragile, isn’t it? All it would take is one little push, and suddenly you’re a drooling little mess on the floor who can’t even feed himself. Sounds fun.”\n\n“It wasn’t,” Bruce said, offering Homelander a distant smile. “Having others feed you gets a little…what was your word? Tiring.”\n\n“So,” Homelander said, changing the subject when he realized the threat hadn’t landed. Smart. “This is a fun little group. I’m guessing you’re a little bit like our Seven, yeah? That must make you Black Noir.”\n\nBruce didn’t react to the offering of sensitive information, though a part of him wanted to. Offering information freely wasn’t usually a good sign during an interrogation. “You’re referring to your home universe.”\n\n“Pretty rad place,” Homelander quipped, “Though I’ll say, you’re a lot prettier than Black Noir. That guy’s basically just a walking hard-on attached to a vegetable. You’re at least half-interesting to talk to.”\n\nBruce leaned back in his chair, making a show of examining the meta. “Tell me about them.”\n\nHomelander’s face shuttered. “About who?”\n\n“Your Seven,” Bruce said, using his term for the sake of building a rapport. “You told us earlier you were looking for our universe’s equivalent of you. That implies that something about your Seven must be unsatisfactory.”\n\n“They’re not loyal,” Homelander spat, making a face. “You can’t depend on other people. Not if you want to survive. You can only trust yourself. I asked them to send me--”\n\nBruce tapped at his tablet, making a note. “Your team betrayed you.”\n\n“They didn’t even have to -- oh, no,” Homelander whipped his head back, eyes flickering as he stared directly into Bruce’s cowl. “You don’t get to play that game with me. I know what you’re fucking doing.”\n\nThere was genuine hurt in Homelander’s eyes, swiftly overtaken by the familiar, glassy rage. Every beat of vulnerability was made up for in threats, a rapid back-and-forth that would leave most interrogators reeling.\n\nBruce kept his eye on the prize.\n\n“Seven implies seven members. You’ve mentioned Black Noir, and I assume you’re also a member,” he started. “You reacted to Wonder Woman in the field. So she has a similar counterpart, in your universe.”\n\n“Wonder Woman,” Homelander repeated, making a face. “What a fucking ridiculous name. At least Maeve was a Queen. What, I’m supposed to be impressed by Wonder Woman? Do you all have fucking ridiculous names?”\n\nBruce didn’t point out that Black Noir and Homelander were also ridiculous. A part of him wanted to quiz Homelander on all of their counterparts, one by one, but there was a difference between trading information, and simply giving it away to an unknown enemy.\n\n“You referred to yourself as a Supe earlier,” Bruce said, changing gears again. “Are Supes common in your universe?”\n\n“Born and bred,” Homelander said, like he was parodying some unknown party line. “Chosen by God himself, if the rumors are true. Which they are, by the way.”\n\nBruce had doubts. “Your scan indicated you were genetically enhanced, possibly from birth. Doesn’t sound very God-given to me.”\n\n“Yeah, well,” Homelander tossed one shoulder, dislodging half of his cape from the chair. “Mengele was a god to the right people, wasn’t he?”\n\nThat surprised Bruce. “So the powers are a result of experimentation. You were a subject of experimentation.”\n\n“What?” Homelander asked, looking up. He seemed, for the first time, taken aback. “I didn’t--”\n\n“--have to,” Bruce finished, raising an eyebrow under the cowl. “We’ve established that your universe is similar to ours, but maintains some key differences. Your powers likely came from experimentation, which implies sophisticated buy-in across various global systems. And, despite being a part of a super-powered group, you still feel the need for additional power.”\n\n“Loyalty,” Homelander corrected. His face had grown flushed during Bruce’s summary. “I don’t need extra power. I need loyalty.”\n\n“And attacking the first meta you saw was the answer to that?” Bruce asked, dubious.\n\n“He wasn’t me,” Homelander said, lips twisting into a toothy, off putting smile. “It’s the real deal, or nothing, sugar cakes.”\n\n“You tend to rapidly oscillate between viewing me as an authority figure and a sexual object,” Bruce said, naming the behavior just to watch the man squirm. “Yet you cannot seem to settle on one or the other. Tell me about that.”\n\n“I don’t think of you as anything,” Homelander snarled. “You think you’re special? Just because you can spout off random factoids like some autistic little seven year old who wants to fuck the train set Mommy got him for Christmas?”\n\nBruce stared at him for a long moment, not bothering to dignify that with a response. Homelander seemed to cringe slightly under the silence, his eyes darting away from Bruce’s cowl to the walls beyond him.\n\n“So,” Homelander said, voice going high and sharp in mock-interest. “Tell me about what you’ve got going on with Supe-man. Since we’re getting close and braiding each other’s hair and all.”\n\nBruce kept his expression neutral. “What would you like to know?”\n\n“Not going to correct me on your boyfriend’s name?” Homelander teased, something dark flashing in his eyes.\n\n“You don’t seem interested in being corrected,” Bruce replied, watching Homelander’s expression closely. His unwillingness to engage seemed to enrage the man, leaving him twitchy and full of unspent bravado.\n\nHe’s used to people being intimidated by him, Bruce thought to himself. He likes it when you don’t play along. You’re an exception.\n\nAnd Homelander was a lonely, lonely man in more ways than Bruce cared to detail. Sexually, emotionally, socially. Parentally.\n\n“I could see him watching you, you know,” Homelander bragged. “I could see his heart rate spike when you got near me. Yours doesn’t move as much, but maybe that’s only when he fucks you. You get all sloppy for him, don’t you?”\n\nBruce read in between the lines. He reached up, undoing the cowl and removing it from his face. It was a gamble and a trump card, all in one.\n\nThere was a minute dilation of Homelander’s pupils, harder for Bruce to see without the enhanced lenses from the cowl, but still very much present. Bruce set the cowl to the side, watching Homelander carefully.\n\nThe other man leaned toward him, then seemed to haul himself back with a disgusted expression. Emotion fractured across his face. “Sure, go ahead and strip for me. I’m sure Supes will love that.”\n\n“Would it surprise you if I told you Superman doesn’t control what I do?” Bruce asked.\n\n“He should,” Homelander muttered, shaking his head. “I mean, letting humans run the Seven? I’d rather chop my own dick off and eat it than let someone that weak at my table.”\n\n“What makes humans weak?” Bruce asked. At Homelander’s scoff, he rephrased. “To you. For the purpose of this conversation.”\n\n“They’re so easy to rip apart,” Homelander said, in a way that should’ve been a threat, but seemed to fall short. “I mean, one twitch and you guys are in pieces. If you hadn’t had that handy little green shield back there, I’m sure I could’ve taken you out.”\n\n“Your disdain for humans comes from their vulnerability to your powers,” Bruce summarized. “Have you ever killed someone with your powers unintentionally?”\n\n“How about you shut the fuck up and stop playing twenty questions?” Homelander deflected.\n\n“You’re not enjoying this?” Bruce asked, with some mock-surprise. “I’ve got at least six questions left, by my count.”\n\n“You can shove those questions--”\n\n“Up my ass,” Bruce finished, letting out a sigh. “I know. This has been disappointing, Homelander. I thought we were getting along. As much as a human could with a Supe, of course.”\n\nAs predicted, Bruce’s apparent disappointment had almost as much of an impact as taking off the cowl had. Homelander leaned forward, chasing his approval and trying desperately to show he wasn’t.\n\n“As soon as I get out of these cuffs,” Homelander swore, eyes burning into the side of Bruce’s face. “I’ll make you regret every single one of those questions, you pathetic little faggot. I’ll tear those stupid lips off your face and feed them to you. I’ll rip your arm off and fuck you with it until you come all over yourself and beg me to die.”\n\nClearly, Bruce had struck a nerve. He kept his amusement to himself, pushing to his feet with an overdone glance at the door, as if in longing.\n\n“Well,” Bruce said, taking his abandoned cowl off the table. “I suppose it’s time for the kid gloves to come off.”\n\n“What?” Homelander snorted. “You’re going to send in Knock-Off and Queen of the Lesbians? You think they’re going to make me crack?”\n\n“I don’t think you have anything of value to crack,” Bruce said, watching as those words hit Homelander like a physical slap across the face. “I think you’re a sad, lonely man combing the multiverse to look for unconditional love and loyalty. Which you’ll never find, even within yourself. Because you can’t be loyal to yourself if you don’t even like yourself.”\n\nHomelander had paled considerably, the fire in his eyes blooming back to life. “You shut your mouth.”\n\n“Why would this world be any different from your own?” Bruce continued. “At least in that respect, it isn’t. Superman doesn’t like you -- your one universal constant, Homelander. Every universe finds you abhorrent.”\n\n“You shut your fucking mouth,” Homelander repeated, voice dropping to a whisper. There were tears gathering in his eyes, far easier to prompt than Bruce had anticipated. “I--”\n\n“There are key differences,” Bruce continued, holding up a hand. “Your counterpart here is stronger. Braver. Kinder. A better man than you’ll ever be, I suspect. Even if you spent the rest of your life trying to make up for what you’ve done in your universe.”\n\n“What I’ve -- done?” Homelander asked, close to trembling. “How the hell do you know what I’ve done?”\n\n“One hit was all it took,” Bruce continued, ignoring the question. “And that enrages you. Doesn’t it? The fact that someone could be so much better than you, so effortlessly. Without needing the approval and fear of everyone around them.”\n\n“I don’t need them,” Homelander said, shaking his head. “They need me. They need Homelander more than they need John. They want that fear, all of them. All of them.”\n\nBruce let the desperate words hang in the air between them, dragging out the silence. After a moment, he leaned forward, letting his voice drop into a familiar register.\n\n“John?” he asked, watching as Homelander twitched toward the name. “You need to go home.”\n\nThe man went ashen in one heartbeat, the red fury draining from his eyes. He stared at Bruce like he’d been struck, mouth falling open to show misaligned, bleach-white teeth.\n\nThere wasn’t a universe where this man could hold a candle to Superman. Bruce had known that, going into this interrogation. But it was good to have a reminder, sometimes.\n\n“How was he?” Clark asked, jumping to his feet as Bruce exited the interrogation room. “Are you okay? Do you need medical?”\n\nBruce handed him the tablet of notes, shaking his head. “I’m fine. You weren’t listening?”\n\n“Diana ripped the comm out of my ear after I broke three of them in a row,” Clark said, looking slightly sheepish. “Sorry about that. I know they’re expensive.”\n\nThe relief of seeing Clark’s face, free of Homelander’s rage, was enough to dampen his reaction to that statement. He gestured toward the hallway, indicating they should walk and talk.\n\n“You took off your cowl?” Clark asked, watching him put it back on. Bruce grunted.\n\n“Any update on returning him to his universe?”\n\n“Victor’s working on tracking the anomaly,” Clark said, “He and Hal identified a weak point near the location we found him. They think the portal might open up there again in a few hours. So we can send him back, at least.”\n\nThank god. Bruce hadn’t been looking forward to a long-term guest of Homelander’s caliber on the Watchtower. Even significantly weaker than Clark, he was still difficult to contain.\n\n“What did he say to you?” Clark asked, sounding worried as he hurried after him. “You’re moving like a b--”\n\n“Don’t finish that sentence,” Bruce said, not having to look to know Clark was grinning. “If you’re breaking out the puns…”\n\n“I’m just worried,” Clark said, rounding around him so he was forced to stop. “Read me in, B. You’re not -- worried, about me, are you?”\n\nBruce scanned the hallway around them, searching for any witnesses. When he found none, he relented, exhaling.\n\n“This is why we have contingencies.” Bruce pointed over his shoulder at the interrogation room. “That man in there is a shining example of every single rule and procedure I’ve implemented in the past six years.”\n\n“He barely gave Diana a workout,” Clark protested, but it sounded weak. “He’s vulnerable to zinc, Bruce. That’s one of the most common elements.”\n\n“It’s not about what he’s vulnerable to,” Bruce said, shaking his head. “It’s about the systems we build around us. His world doesn’t have a Justice League. He’s surrounded by those who fear him, or fear his wrath if they disobey him. He might be weaker, or more vulnerable, but he wields more power in that world than you ever will here.”\n\nThe last sentence came out harsher than he’d intended, ringing in the confined space of the hallway around them. Clark actually took a step back, looking -- for all intents and purposes -- like it had been an outright threat.\n\n“You think,” Clark took a visible, unneeded breath, “that if I didn’t have the League, I’d end up like him?”\n\n“Would you ever choose to be like him?” Bruce asked, instead of answering the question. “To be like that?”\n\n“God, no,” Clark said, looking horrified.\n\n“Then we’re on the same page.” Bruce let his eyes roll up and down Clark’s body, still in his path. “Comm me before you zeta down. I want to be there.”\n\n“Where are you going?” Clark asked, something hurt threading through his voice.\n\n“I want you to speak with him. Sit down and listen until they’re ready with the portal,” Bruce said. “I want you to look him in the eye and tell me I’m wrong.”\n\n“Wrong about what?”\n\n“That that,” Bruce nodded at the tablet resting in his hands, “could’ve been you.”\n\nHe left Clark standing in the middle of the hallway, heading for his quarters.\n\nHal stood next to him at the zeta target, posture loose and easy from what Bruce assumed was a large dose of painkillers. His green uniform was whole again, covering a whole swathe of bandages up his left side and arm.\n\nAt his raised eyebrow, Hal shifted on his feet, looking a little guilty. “I just -- I don’t trust that guy, okay? Seems like he’s got a real hard-on for humans.”\n\n“You’re a human,” Bruce noted.\n\n“Yeah, but I’ve got this,” Hal said, holding up his ring for Bruce’s inspection. “Tends to put off the speciesism. Lanterns really are the great uniters.”\n\nHomelander appeared in the zeta a moment later, held between Clark and Diana by his shackled wrists. When he spotted Bruce, his expression darkened.\n\n“Let’s light this candle,” Homelander said, voice slightly raised. “Who’s ready for round two? I sure am.”\n\n“He’s such a fucking asshole,” Hal muttered, rolling his eyes. “Please tell me this portal is gonna open soon. I’ll shove him in there myself.”\n\n“I can hear you, glowstick,” Homelander called out to them, leaning past Clark to glare at Hal. “You want me to crack your back for you? I can’t wait to see if you’ll spurt green everywhere.”\n\n“Like I said,” Hal took a breath, “A fucking asshole. Maybe we should let him get his ass beat again.”\n\n“Clearing an in-universe anomaly is a higher priority,” Bruce said, instead of I agree, and maybe we should give Diana some zinc-plated swords this time too. “Anything on your ring?”\n\n“...Actually, I think something’s starting up about…three hundred feet away?”\n\nBruce caught Clark’s eyes. The Kryptonian tightened his grip on Homelander’s arm, hauling him along.\n\nThe portal opened up soon after Hal’s warning, a static-filled, gaping hole in the middle of the field. Homelander let out a resigned breath, head hanging slightly as he was pushed toward the portal.\n\nClark said something to Diana, who let go of Homelander and fell back. The Kryptonian marched Homelander up to the portal himself, speaking in a low voice Bruce couldn’t overhear, even via comms.\n\nFrom the way Diana’s eyebrows drew together, she couldn’t either. She settled uneasily at Bruce’s side, a hand hovering over her sheathed sword.\n\nAfter a moment, Homelander looked up at Clark. There were tears running down his face, eyes red and hopeless at the same time. He was more shaken than Bruce had ever seen him, like whatever Clark had said had broken and humbled him, more than any interrogation could.\n\nThe portal flickered as Homelander stepped through it, rubbing a clumsy arm across his face to conceal the tears. Clark waited on the other side, arms crossed as he guarded his world from the other.\n\nHomelander stood on the other side, staring at his counterpart. With red, flickering eyes, he reached up for something Bruce couldn’t see, closing the portal between them with a flash.\n\nThe image of Homelander’s stricken expression lingered in Bruce’s mind, burned into his thoughts long after he’d looked away. The tears had made Homelander’s eyes even more blue, childlike in a way that was out of place in his older face.\n\nClark’s back remained turned to him, a straight, tense line. Bruce stepped away from Diana and Hal, walking over to the Kryptonian with an apology burning on his tongue.\n\nWhen he reached Clark, the words didn’t come. After a moment, he closed his eyes, trying to clear Homelander’s expression from his mind. Their capes caught the breeze, rippling in tandem.\n\n“What did you say to him?”\n\nHe hadn’t reviewed Clark’s conversation with Homelander yet. A part of him never wanted to. From the way Clark’s breath caught, even now, it had to be deeply personal.\n\n“I said I was disappointed in him,” Clark admitted, after a long pause. “And that I was sorry he ended up this way.”\n\nBruce nodded. It was about what he’d expected. “And I imagine he took that…”\n\n“Very well,” Clark finished, shaking his head. His lips pressed together in a grim line. “You were right.”\n\nBruce didn’t ask for clarification on what. He stood by Clark, drafting and discarding several possible responses before settling on the simplest one.\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\n“I know.” Clark’s lips twitched, almost a smile. “You wouldn’t bring it up if you didn’t care. Doesn’t mean looking into a funhouse mirror version of myself is exactly enjoyable.”\n\nBut it is necessary, Bruce thought but didn’t say. Just as necessary as him looking into Black Noir’s eyes one day, should his counterpart ever show up.\n\nHe set a hand on Clark’s shoulder, waiting to speak until Clark looked him in the eye. “For what it’s worth, I don’t think you’re all that similar. Even if your circumstances had been reversed, I’m not certain you would’ve ended up like him.”\n\n“No,” Clark agreed, a hollow endorsement. His eyes went above Bruce’s head, distant in a way that meant he was looking and listening far beyond their tiny spot on Earth. “I would’ve ended up worse, I think.”\n\nHis hand covered Bruce’s, dislodging Bruce’s fingers with a brief squeeze. The smile Clark gave him -- soft, hesitant, so human -- belied the weight of those words.\n\n“Thank you.”\n\nBruce thought, suddenly, of the room of Kryptonite buried three levels under the Cave. Of Homelander’s burning red eyes, his rage transposed to Clark’s face. He forced his lips into an answering smile.\n\n“Don’t mention it.”"
