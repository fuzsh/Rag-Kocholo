His greatest heroes were from the place of his birth and often of the humblest origins. He loved, as he always said, \"the soil, the water, the trees, and the beautiful Tennessee River.\" He learned from his father how to plow behind a mule, but he told the world to always seek that unplowed row. Above text by Peter Guralnick.\n\nSide two\n\nTHE FATHER OF ROCK 'N' ROLL\n\nSam Phillips fell in love with the miracle of sound and the unifying power of music. Moving to Memphis, Tennessee, he embraced the beauty of the blues with his early recordings of Howlin Wolf, B.B. King, and other delta artists. In 1951, the maverick producer cut the first \"Rock 'N' Roll\" record, \"Rocket 88\". Three years later he revolutionized American music with his discovery of the dynamic Elvis Presley. His credo was passionate, conviction, originality, and individuality in the extreme. His Sun Record label unleashed the earth shaking rule-breaking sounds of Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orison, and Charles Rich. \"Rock 'N' Roll is the freedom of the rhythm of the soul\". He once said, \"And I was looking for that little piece of soul magic\".
