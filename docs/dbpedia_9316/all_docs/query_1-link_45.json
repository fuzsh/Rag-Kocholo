Any questions, just email us!\n\nJuly 2024 – Recycle Right in the Park\n\nThis summer, the blue recycling bins are back throughout Wayne city parks, making recycling accessible for people enjoying the outdoors. Look for the twinned bins—recycling and trash side by side—to properly dispose of your unwanted items. The park recycling bins only accept plastic beverage bottles and aluminum cans that are empty of all liquids. Please do not put any other items in these bins, such as plastic straws, food wrappers, or even plastic drink cups, which all belong in the trash bin. Any amount of trash contaminates the recycling load.\n\nElectronics recycling coming this fall. Mark your calendars for Saturday, September 14, 8:00 – 10:00 am, on 3rd Street between Lincoln and Pearl. Stay tuned for details and save up your electronics until then.\n\nSpecial Green Team Meeting. Join us for a special Green Team meeting on Tuesday, July 9th, noon, at the SNBuilding Conference Room located at 1010 Main Street. City Administrator Wes Blecke will attend to discuss green infrastructure and investments by the city.\n\nFor more tips on the Green Path to the Good Life, like the Wayne Green Team on Facebook or visit www.cityofwayne.org/greenteam.\n\nJune 2024 – How to Keep an Eco-Friendly Lawn\n\nWant to keep your lawn green while being green? Try these eco-friendly lawn tips this summer.\n\nDevelop deep, healthy roots for your lawn by watering deeply and infrequently, and preferably at night. Watering during the day leads to higher evaporation and inefficient use of your water.\n\nLeave grass long and avoid cutting off more than 1/3 of the height of the grass. This keeps your soil in shade and reduces evaporation. It also allows your grass to out-compete weeds.\n\nUse a mulching (higher) setting on your lawnmower and leave clippings on. The clippings decompose and allow for recycling of nutrients.\n\nOverseed lawn in the fall. Newer grass will develop strong roots over the winter.\n\nElectronics recycling coming Saturday, September 14th, 8:00 – 10:00 am, on 3rd Street between Lincoln and Pearl.\n\nFor more tips on the Green Path to the Good Life, like the Wayne Green Team on Facebook or visit www.cityofwayne.org/greenteam.\n\nMay 2024 – Congrats to The Recycled Read, our Zero Hero of the Year!\n\nLast month, the Wayne Green Team presented The Recycled Read bookstore with our Zero Hero award recognizing outstanding work in reducing, reusing, and recycling within the community of Wayne.\n\nOperated by the Friends of the Wayne Public Library, The Recycled Read opened in February 2023 selling used books, magazines, games, CDs, DVDs, VHS tapes, and more. Nothing costs more than $1 and many items are only 25 cents or less. An estimate of more than 20,000 items have been sold at The Recycled Read in just over a year. It has also been visited by more than 850 customers (many from out of town) and raised over $4,000 from the sale of used materials. All funds raised are donated back to the Wayne Public Library. Located at 110 S. Logan Street, it is open the first Saturday of every month, 9am–1pm, and often during garage sale weekends.\n\nThe Recycled Read used bookstore attracts visitors to Wayne and contributes to our economy as a leader in sustainability. Thank you to the Friends of the Wayne Public Library for creating such a successful green business in our community!\n\nSave the date for electronics recycling on Saturday, September 14, 8:00 – 10:00 am, on 3rd Street between Lincoln and Pearl.\n\nJoin us at our next Green Team meeting Tuesday, May 14, noon, in the SNBuilding’s 2nd floor conference room at 1010 Main Street.

We invite you to attend free community events celebrating our planet and efforts to reduce waste.\n\nAttend our Zero Waste Chamber Coffee on Friday, April 19, 10am. Bring your own mug to the Wayne Public Library as you hear the latest on how to reduce, reuse, and recycle in Wayne with our hands-on demos. We’ll also announce the recipient of this year’s Zero Hero award.\n\nWatch our free Earth Day movie, The True Cost, at the Majestic Theatre, Sunday, April 21, 7pm. Join us at the Majestic for a free screening of the groundbreaking documentary, The True Cost, rated PG-13. This film is a story about clothing. It’s about the clothes we wear, the people who make them, and the impact it’s having on our world. The price of clothing has been decreasing for decades, while the human and environmental costs have grown dramatically. The True Cost is a moving documentary that pulls back the curtain on an unseen part of our world and asks us each to consider, who pays the price for our clothing?\n\nDoors open at 6:30pm for zero waste living tips and a mini clothing swap. Feel free to bring up to two sweatshirts or t-shirts to swap with others. The 92-minute film begins at 7pm. Bring your own popcorn container and cup to help make this a zero waste event!\n\nThis free event is hosted by the City of Wayne Green Team, the WSC Green Team, and the A. Jewell Schock Natural History Museum, with funding from the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy.\n\nFor more tips on the Green Path to the Good Life, like the Wayne Green Team on Facebook or visit www.cityofwayne.org/greenteam.\n\nMarch 2024 – Every Day is Take-Back Day in Nebraska\n\nIf you have unused, expired, or unneeded medications in your home, don’t flush them down the toilet or throw them in the trash. You can safely dispose of these by taking them back to our local pharmacies in Wayne, U-Save and Providence Community Pharmacy. Doing so reduces the chance of accidental poisoning of children or pets and decreases potential contamination of surface or groundwater.\n\nHow does it work? Take your leftover medications to the pharmacy in the original bottle or container they came in. If they are acceptable non-controlled substances, the pharmacist will place them in a container to be shipped to an approved incinerator for disposal. If you have controlled substances, the pharmacist will give you a special postage-paid envelope for safe return and disposal. You can also take back over-the-counter medications, liquid medications less than 4 ounces, pet medications, creams, lotions, and ointments. Since 2016, this program has collected more than 236,000 pounds of medication.\n\nThanks to the Nebraska MEDS program, pharmacies in nearly 300 communities across Nebraska can now take back most medications for safe disposal. For more info, talk to your local pharmacist or visit www.leftovermeds.com.\n\nFor more tips on the Green Path to the Good Life, like the Wayne Green Team on Facebook. Thank you for recycling right and supporting our Zero Waste efforts in Wayne!\n\nFebruary 2024 – Love Food, Hate Waste\n\nFood waste continues to be a problem in the U.S. The FDA estimates 30-40% of all food is wasted in America. Wasting food means wasting resources and money, too. Here are five easy ways to reduce your food waste and increase your bottom line.\n\n(1) Buy only what you need. Plan ahead and make a list before grocery shopping. Be smart about sales. It’s not a bargain if you won’t eat it. (2) Eat what you buy. Sounds simple, yet few people manage to do this effectively. Make a conscious effort to keep track of the food you have – and then remember to eat it, especially those yummy leftovers. (3) Keep food fresh. Store foods properly to keep them fresh as long as possible. (4) Don’t toss food before it spoils. Expiration dates don’t always mean the food has gone bad. It often means the food just can’t be sold at a store. (5) Avoid the trash. If you have extra food, share it with others, like family, neighbors, coworkers, or our local food pantry. For the food scraps you can’t eat, consider backyard composting.\n\nFor more tips on the Green Path to the Good Life, like the Wayne Green Team on Facebook. Thank you for recycling right and supporting our Zero Waste efforts in Wayne!\n\nJanuary 2024 – Marker Recycling now in Wayne\n\nWe are kicking off 2024 by adding a new recycling program to our list. Thanks to a company called Terracycle, you can now recycle markers, highlighters, pens, mechanical pencils, permanent markers, and caps at four different locations in Wayne. Look for the Terracycle box at the Wayne Public Library, Wayne High School, Wayne Elementary School, and Carhart Science Building at Wayne State College. No wooden pencils or paint brushes are accepted.\n\nUse the City’s Brush Pile. Bring your Christmas tree free of any decorations or tinsel to the City’s brush pile at 1810 Industrial Road.\n\nGreen Team Meeting January 9: We invite you to attend our Green Team meetings the 2nd Tuesday of each month at noon in the conference room of the SNBuilding at 1010 Main Street in Wayne (with the exception of no meetings in June, August, and December). We are already planning our Earth Day events in April and welcome your input.\n\nFor more tips on the Green Path to the Good Life, like the Wayne Green Team on Facebook. Thank you for recycling right and supporting our Zero Waste efforts in Wayne!\n\nDecember 2023 –Save your green while being green this holiday season\n\nReady to save money this holiday season? Follow our 3 easy tips to help keep both your wallet and the environment green.\n\nShop local. Shopping local supports our hometown businesses. You’ll love all the creative gifts and services Wayne has to offer. And, you’ll save time and money by not driving out of town and fighting the crowds in bigger cities. Plus, think how useful a gift certificate to a local business for a massage, haircut, car wash, or oil change would be.\n\nGive an Experience. Time together can be more valuable than an item that’s rarely used. Make coupons for doing special things together, like taking a walk, playing a game, or cooking a meal. Try saving time for someone by offering to do chores or other time-consuming tasks.\n\nMake it from scratch. Think about making a card with a hand-written note, a list of 10 reasons your family member is special, or holiday ornaments from recyclable materials, like toilet paper rolls and egg cartons. Sometimes the best gift is one you can’t buy.\n\nRecycle Strings of Lights. Bring any old strings of holiday lights to the Wayne Recycling & Trash Center and place in the bins marked for lights. These are recycled for the copper wire inside.\n\nUse the City’s Tree Pile. You can dispose of your Christmas tree and greenery at the end of the holiday season at 1810 Industrial Road. Please remove all decorations or tinsel.\n\nFor more tips on the Green Path to the Good Life, like the Wayne Green Team on Facebook or visit www.cityofwayne.org/greenteam. Thank you for recycling right and supporting our Zero Waste efforts in Wayne!\n\nNovember 2023 – Over 15,000 Pounds of Electronics Recycled\n\nCongratulations to our community for recycling 15,685 pounds of electronics last month, a 15% increase from 2022. We served 125 cars and raised $3,000 to support our Zero Waste program, like paying to recycle light strings and more. Since 2013, our community has recycled 175,000 pounds of electronics. Your efforts help keep harmful materials out of our landfill. Thank you for making a difference.\n\nWe also give special thanks to the many people who helped make this event a success, including volunteers from the Wayne Green Team, and Wayne State College Men’s and Women’s Basketball teams; City of Wayne staff and police; our vendor, the Retrofit Companies; and the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy for financial support.\n\nRecycle Strings of Holiday Lights.

Drive eastbound on 3rd street between Lincoln and Pearl in front of the City Hall parking lot to responsibly dispose of your electronics.

The Boy Scouts have converted a horse trailer into a recycling drop off container. Only aluminum cans are accepted (no tin food cans), and you must place them in a bag inside the trailer. Please don’t dump cans in the trailer. That will make for quite a mess when the Boy Scouts and their parents (all volunteers!) empty it. Thank you again to our local Wayne Boy Scouts and Pac N Save for supporting a new recycling location in Wayne.\n\nElectronics recycling next month.

Johnnie Byrd brews all beers with 100% renewable energy, purchased from the City of Wayne via Renewable Energy Credits. All the grain used to make beer and spirits is fed to local cattle and kept out of the landfill. It invests in reusable to go containers, such as glass growlers and aluminum cans, both of which are infinitely recyclable. It is repurposing nearly 2,500 wine bottles served in the taproom for a special project. Johnnie Byrd does not use paper towels in its main bathrooms. Instead, it uses washable, reusable cloth towels, keeping an estimated 2,900 cubic feet of trash out of landfills, or enough to fill 3 large school buses. Johnnie Byrd Brewing Company is a business committed to sustainability. Thank you for being a Zero Hero in our community!\n\nSave the date for electronics recycling.

The average American uses 80 pounds of glass every year, and all of it can be recycled endlessly, saving energy and raw materials. When our glass bunker at the Wayne Recycling & Trash Center (RTC) is full, a truck picks up the glass and takes it to Kansas City for free. Ripple Glass has grown to cover 100 communities across 9 states. Follow these tips to recycle glass in Wayne, and your small act can make a big ripple.\n\nHOW DO I RECYCLE GLASS IN WAYNE? Bring your clean and empty glass bottles to the marked bins at the RTC located at 110 Windom Street. Remove any plastic bags or cardboard as these cannot be recycled with glass. For your safety and to prevent contamination, do not place glass directly into the concrete bunker outside where it is crushed for transport.\n\nWHAT GLASS IS ACCEPTED? Glass food and beverage containers (all colors and labels can stay on), drinking vessels (pint, wine, mason jars), candle jars (leftover wax is okay), cosmetic bottles/jars (no lids), windows with frames & hardware removed.\n\nWHAT IS NOT ACCEPTED? Ceramic, porcelain, milk glass, China/leaded glass, mirrors, laminated glass/windshields, Pyrex or Corningware, dishware, light bulbs, plastic bags.\n\nCAN I RECYCLE GLASS CURBSIDE? No. Waste Connections does not accept glass in its curbside recycling. The only place you can recycle glass in Wayne is at the RTC.\n\nFor more tips on the Green Path to the Good Life, like the Wayne Green Team on Facebook or visit www.cityofwayne.org/greenteam.\n\nFebruary 2023 – What to do with Leftover Medication?\n\nIf you have unused, expired, or unneeded medications in your home, don’t flush them down the toilet or throw them in the trash. You can dispose of these properly by taking them back to our local pharmacies in Wayne, U-Save and Providence Community Pharmacy. Doing so reduces the chance of accidental poisoning of children or pets and decreases potential contamination of surface or groundwater.\n\nHow does it work? Take your leftover medications to the pharmacy in the original bottle or container they came in.

Wayne has so many options to donate or resell stuff at thrift stores like Micah’s Closest, Thrift Warehouse, and Bubba’s Baggage. See the full list of where to take odds and ends on our website at www.cityofwayne.org/greenteam, which includes items like prescription medicines, eyeglasses, books, plastic bags, inkjet cartridges, and more.\n\nYou can always recycle for free at the Wayne Recycling & Trash Center (RTC), located at 110 Windom Street and open Mon and Fri, 9:00am – 1:30pm, Tue 11am – 2pm, and Sat, 8:00am – noon.

Earlier this year, we lost the vendor who recycled these cartridges. Thanks to research by our Wayne Green Team volunteers, however, we found a new one, Evolve Recycling, to process these materials. The drop off station is now by the interior door to the library and includes bins to recycle inkjet cartridges, small household batteries (like AA and AAA), cell phones, and eyeglasses.\n\nRecycle Strings of Lights. Bring any old strings of holiday lights to the Wayne Recycling & Trash Center and place in the bins marked for lights. These are recycled for the copper wire inside.\n\nUse the City’s Brush Pile.

That's a lot of wonderful green spaces to enjoy for picnics, playing, relaxing and more. Bressler and Sunnyview are two of our biggest parks, but we also have Victor, Viken and Ashley Parks, to name a few others. The city has a big job of keeping these parks maintained, from managing playground equipment and picnic tables to collecting trash and recyclables. Big thanks to the city employees who help care for our parks! We are looking for people interested in helping to promote and preserve our beautiful city parks. If you are passionate about these fun green spaces, then become a Park Pal by contacting Jason Barelman at jasonbarelman@gmail.com. Stay tuned for more information from the Park Pals.\n\nElectronics Recycling: Saturday, September 24, 8:00-10:00 am on 3rd Street between Lincoln and Pearl. Details coming in next month's newsletter. Be sure to save up your old electronics until then.\n\nJuly 2022 - Recycle Right in the Park\n\nThis summer, the blue recycling bins are back throughout Wayne city parks, making recycling accessible for people enjoying the outdoors. Look for the twinned bins -- recycling and trash side-by-side -- to properly dispose of your unwanted items. The park recycling bins only accept plastic beverage bottles and cans that are empty of all liquids. Please do not put any other items in these bins, such as straws, food wrappers, or even plastic drink cups, which all belong in the trash bin. Any amount of trash contaminates the recycling load.\n\nElectronics recycling coming this fall. Mark your calendars for Saturday, September 24, 8:00-10:00 am, on 3rd Street between Lincoln and Pearl.

Join us for a special Green Team meeting on Tuesday, July 19th, noon, at the SNBuilding Conference Room located at 1010 Main Street. City Administrator Wes Blecke will attend to discuss green infrastructure and investments by the city.\n\nJune 2022 - How to Keep an Eco-Friendly Lawn\n\nLast month we hosted a special meeting on Eco Lawn Care 101 and learned some valuable tips to keeping your lawn green while also being Earth friendly this summer.\n\nDevelop deep, healthy roots for your lawn by watering deeply and infrequently, and preferably at night. Watering during the day leads to higher evaporation and inefficient use of your water.\n\nLeave grass long and avoid cutting off more than 1/3 of the height of the grass. This keeps your soil in shade and reduces evaporation. It also allows your grass to out-compete weeds.\n\nUse a mulching (higher) setting on your lawnmower and leave clippings on. The clippings decompose and allow for recycling of nutrients.\n\nOverseed lawn in the fall. Newer grass will develop strong roots over the winter.\n\nElectronics Recylcing coming Saturday, September 24, 8:00-10:00 a.m., on 3rd Street between Lincoln and Pearl.\n\nMay 2022 - Congrats to Thrift Warehouse, our Zero Hero of the Year!\n\nLast month, the Wayne Green Team presented Thrift Warehouse with our Zero Hero award recognizing outstanding work in reducing, reusing and recycling within the community of Wayne.\n\nThrift Warehouse opened in 2016 selling used household goods, then started selling used clothes on consignment. Thrift Warehouse takes in an average of 5,000 pieces of clothing each month for resale. They also recycle whatever possible, including cardboard, glass, and paper. They do not buy any new bags, but reuse whatever comes into the store through donation. They refer children's clothing to Micah's Closet in Wayne, and if bedding comes in that isn't fit for use, it is donated to dog rescues.\n\nThrift Warehouse has made a big impact reducing waste in our community by leading secondhand use of clothing, household goods and more. Thank you for being a Zero Hero in our community!\n\nSave the date for electronics recycling.

The average American uses 80 pounds of glass every year, and all of it can be recycled endlessly, saving energy and raw materials. When our glass bunker at the Wayne Recycling & Trash Center (RTC) is full, a truck picks up the glass and takes it to Kansas City for free. Ripple Glass has grown to cover 100 communities across nine states, and recycled 43,500 tons of glass last year. Follow these tips to recycle glass in Wayne, and your small act can make a big ripple\n\nHOW DO I RECYCLE GLASS IN WAYNE? Bring your clean and empty glass bottles to the marked bins at the RTC located at 110 Windom Street. Remove any plastic bags or cardboard as these cannot be recycled with glass. For your safety and to prevent contamination, do not place glass directly into the concrete bunker outside where it is crushed for transport.\n\nWHAT GLASS IS ACCEPTED? Glass food and beverage containers (all colors and labels can stay on), drinking vessels (pint, wine, mason jars), candle jars (leftover wax is okay), cosmetic bottles/jars (no lids), windows with frames & hardware removed.\n\nWHAT IS NOT ACCEPTED? Ceramic, porcelain, milk glass, China/leaded glass, mirrors, laminated glass/windshields, Pyrex or Corningware, dishware, light bulbs.\n\nCAN I RECYCLE GLASS CURBSIDE? No. Waste Connections does not accept glass in its curbside recycling. The only place you can recycle glass in Wayne is at the RTC.\n\nFebruary 2022 - Vinegar as a Natural Cleaner\n\nVinegar is a great natural cleaner for the home that's cheap and widely available. It's also non-toxic, lasts for a long time without losing strength, and is much safer to have under your sink than bleach, ammonia, or other toxic cleaning products. Here are three green cleaning recipes for you to try out in the home.\n\n(1) Tile: mix a paste of baking soda and vinegar then scrub on tile. Rinse with warm water.\n\n(2) Garbage disposal: pour 1/4 cup of vinegar in disposal and let sit for a couple of minutes, then turn on.\n\n(3) Hard water build-up: for stubborn hard water deposits on faucets or shower heads, fill a plastic bag with enough distilled white vinegar to cover the fixture and then let it soak overnight.\n\nSpecial Green Team Meeting February 8th.

It's about seeking meaningful, eco-friendly alternatives that don't harm the planet or create unnecessary waste. And often these alternatives are more memorable, unique and economical than mass-produced items found in big box stores. Give our eco-friendly tips a trip and find more holiday ideas at www.simplifytheholidays.org.\n\n1. Always shop local. Shopping local supports our hometown businesses. You'll be surprised at how many creative gifts and services Wayne has to offer. And you'll save time and money by not having to drive out of town and fight all the crowds in bigger cities. Plus, think how useful a gift certificate to a local business for a massage, haircut, car wash, or oil change would be.\n\n2. Make a memory. Give an experience with time together, like baking cookies to share, or try something new and adventurous to do, like exploring a state park with a winter picnic of hot cocoa and cookies.\n\n3. Gift your talent. Are you good at things like organizing, cooking, or repairing broken stuff? Give someone a few hours to help them clean out closets, set up a meal plan, or repair that broken bike. Your loved ones will appreciate your expertise, and you may both get some quality time together.\n\nRecycle Strings of Light. Bring any old strings of holiday lights to the Wayne Recycling & Trash Center and place in the bins marked for lights. These are recycled for the copper wire inside.\n\nUse the City's Brush Pile. Don't forget you can dispose of your Christmas tree and greenery at the end of the holiday season at 1810 Industrial Road. Please remove all decorations or tinsel.\n\nNovember 2021 - Nearly 25,000 Pounds of Electronics Recycled\n\nCongratulations to our community for recycling nearly 25,000 pounds of electronics and raising over $4,300 to support our Zero Waste programs at our collection event in September.

Click here for a full list of details and items accepted by our vendor, The Retrofit Companies.\n\nJuly 2021 - Where Can I Recycle Plastic Bags in Wayne\n\nPlastic bags require a different type of recycling than plastic bottles and containers. That's why it's important to bring them to designated locations for recycling instead of placing them in your curbside recycling container.

These bins accept:\n\nPlastic retail bags\n\nProduce bags\n\nNewspaper bags\n\nDry cleaning bags\n\nPaper towel and toilet paper wrap\n\nOver wrap on cases of soda or canned vegetables\n\nSealed air pouches in mailed packages (aka \"Air Pillows\")\n\nZiploc and other zipper style bags (with zippers removed)\n\nThe Wayne Recycling & Trash Center (RTC) does NOT accept plastic bags for recycling.

Both Pac N Save and Quality Foods offer a reusable bag credit of 5 cents per bag!\n\nSave the date for electronics recycling on Saturday, September 18, 8:00-10:00 a.m. on 3rd Street between Lincoln and Pearl.\n\nJune 2021 - Take Household Hazardous Waste to Norfolk\n\nYou can take your household hazardous waste items like oil & latex paint, cleaning chemicals, pesticides, aerosol cans, and even nail polish remover, to the City of Norfolk's Household Hazardous Waste Facility.

Give beeswax wraps a try and you'll be buzzing with excitement. These reusable coverings are a great alternative to plastic wrap and do a better job of keeping food fresh. They are made of beeswax, jojoba oil, tree resin and either cotton or cotton and hemp fabric. These ingredients have preservative properties to help food last longer, thereby reducing food waste. And beeswax wraps decrease household waste overall by taking the place of plastic bags, disposable containers, and plastic wrap. After about a year of use, you can compost the wraps. Our local shop, The Flower Cellar, sells them in Wayne, so you can check them out in person.

Due to precautions surrounding the coronavirus, our Earth Day events this year are cancelled, but we continue to celebrate its meaning and history.\n\nEarth Day started as a unified response to an environment in crisis -- oil spills, smog, rivers so polluted they literally caught fire. 20 million Americans took to the streets, college campuses (including Wayne State College) and hundreds of cities to protest environmental ignorance and demand a new way forward for our planet.\n\nThe Earth Day movement launched a wave of action, including passage of landmark environmental laws in the U.S., such as the Clear Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts, along with the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. Many countries adopted similar laws following our lead in the U.S.\n\nNow more than ever, it is important we continue the efforts started 50 years ago by recognizing the value of our environment and our ability to protect it. Our community has shown this commitment through a variety of efforts, including electronic recycling events, household hazardous waste collections, Earth Day documentaries, and a thriving reuse market.\n\nLet’s keep up the good work and celebrate Earth Day every day with our actions. Reduce waste by shopping local, eating all the food on your plate and in your fridge, carrying a reusable water bottle, skipping plastic straws and so much more. Check out updates to our flyers for the Wayne Recycling & Trash Center, the Battery Recycling Program and Zero Waste in Wayne on our website. Together, we can protect our environment and leave it beautiful for future generations.\n\nMarch 2020 - Recycle Your Batteries Right\n\nLast year we made a change to our battery recycling program to help manage costs and collection. Only small, household batteries are accepted for recycling at the Wayne Public Library. These include alkaline, zinc carbon, NiMH, NiCd, less than 9 volts, non-lithium button cell, and lithium & lithium-ion with exposed terminals that require taping. We do not accept large batteries, such as lead acid, electronic batteries, and anything over 9 volts.\n\nUnfortunately, some people are still dropping off the larger drill batteries and other types over 9 volts. Please carefully follow the instructions on our website and posted at the library. Always be sure to tape terminals on required batteries to avoid any spark during shipping. Safety first! This battery recycling program is costly and limited to only small household types. Thank you for your understanding and support.\n\nFebruary 2020 - Give Vinegar a Try\n\nDid you know vinegar is use for more than just cooking? It’s a great natural cleaner for the home. Besides being effective, vinegar is cheap and widely available. Plus, it’s non-toxic, lasts for a long time without losing strength, and is much safer to have under your sink than bleach, ammonia, or other toxic cleaning products. Here are just three green cleaning recipes for you to try out in the home:\n\n1. Window Cleaner: Mix a half-cup of vinegar with a half-cup of water and put into a spray bottle. Squirt on windows then scrub with newspaper, not paper towels, which cause streaking.\n\n2. Laundry: Add 1/4 cup of vinegar to your rinse cycle when washing clothes. It’ll help make colors brighter, remove smells, and break down detergent build up.\n\n3. Hard Water Build Up: For stubborn hard water deposits on faucets or shower heads, fill a plastic bag with enough distilled white vinegar to cover the fixture and let it soak overnight.\n\nJoin us for our next Green Team meeting on Tuesday, February 11 at noon in the back room at Tacos N More.\n\nJanuary 2020 - A Green Start to the New Year\n\nIf your house feels full of too many holiday purchases, then it’s time to take stock and do a home cleanse to see what you no longer need or use. Wayne has great options for you to donate or resell your stuff at our local thrift stores and more. A full list of where to take reusable goods in Wayne is at www.cityofwayne.org/greenteam. The list includes eyeglasses, books, prescription medicines, plastic bags, inkjet printer cartridges and more.\n\nYou can always recycle for free at the Wayne Recycling & Trash Center located at 110 Windom Street, open Monday and Friday (9:00 am-1:30 pm), Tuesday (11:00 am-2:00 pm) and Saturday (8:00 am-noon). The station accepts glass, cardboard, plastic bottles (no plastic bags) and scrap metal, and has recycling drop offs for local Boy Scout Troop #174’s collcetion of aluminum cans, newspapers, magazines, and mixed paper. Don’t forget you can still bring your strings of holiday lights in for recycling through the end of January.\n\nTake Trees to the City’s Brush Pile. At the end of the holiday season, dispose of your Christmas tree (without any decorations or tinsel) and greenery at the City’s brush pile at 1810 Industrial Road.\n\nGreen Team Meeting January 14: We invite you to attend our Green Team meetings the 2nd Tuesday of each month at noon in the back room of Tacos n More, with the exception that meetings are not held during the months of June, August and December. Come join us and help Wayne continue its journey to zero waste!\n\nDecember 2019 - Get Ready for a Green Holiday!\n\nGo green this holiday season with easy tips to save money and reduce waste!\n\n1. Give and Experience. Time together can be more valuable than an item that’s rarely used. Make coupons for doing special things together, like taking a walk, playing a game, or cooking a meal. Try saving time for someone by offering to do chores or other time-consuming tasks.\n\n2. Buy Battery-Free Gifts. Batteries are expensive and difficult to recycle so keep your gift giving simple and make it battery-free. Or give rechargeable batteries and a charger if you must.\n\n3. Select Gifts That Don’t Require Much Packaging. Gift certificates, tickets to a show, potted plants or homemade treats work great. Reuse gift bags, ribbons or a bow if you do need to wrap, or use cloth like a scarf or dish towel to wrap a gift.\n\n4. Re-Gift. Have something you no longer want, like a good book you’ve read or a nice shirt you don’t wear? Don’t be shy about re-gifting. You’ll extend the life of the item and pass it on to someone who will appreciate it.\n\n5. Shop Local. Our community has wonderful stores that offer creative gifts and services, along with opportunities at local craft and book fairs to buy something special. Shop in town before spending dollars outside of our community and on extra fuel to drive there and back, saving the gift of extra time for yourself.\n\nRecycle Strings of Lights. Bring your old strings of holiday lights for recycling to the Wayne Recycling & Trash Center and place in the bins marked for lights. These are recycled for the copper wire inside. When replacing, consider LED lights, which last longer, use less energy, and save money. Now that’s a bright idea!\n\nUse the City’s Brush Pile. At the end of the holiday season, dispose of your Christmas tree (without any decorations or tinsel) and greenery at the City’s brush pile at 1810 Industrial Road.\n\nNovember 2019 - A Mess Turned Into Success\n\nLast month, over 80 households brought their messy household hazardous waste to our successful collection event sponsored by the Northeast Nebraska Resource Conservation & Development: 2,350 pounds of paint, 1,320 pounds of pesticides, 90 gallons of oil, 15 gallons of antifreeze, 257 light bulbs, 100 pounds of car batteries, and 420 pounds or other recyclable material. We thank the RC&D for choosing Wayne three out of the last four years so we can properly dispose of such hazardous waste. We also thank the Nebraska Environmental Trust, Gill Hauling, the City of Wayne and the Wayne State College Women’s Soccer team for support. With committed partners like these in our community, we are closer to our goal of Zero Waste in Wayne.\n\nRecycle Strings of Holiday Lights\n\nDecorating for the holidays only to discover your holiday lights no longer work? Well don’t throw them out when you can recycle them instead. Collection bins are set up to recycle strings of lights at the Wayne Recycling & Trash Center (formerly known as our Transfer Station) during its regular hours of operation: Monday and Friday, 9 am-1:30 pm; Tuesday 11 am-2 pm; Saturday 8 am-noon. The strings of lights will be recycled for its copper wire by a company called Retrofit in Minneapolis. When buying new holiday lights, consider LED ones, which last longer, use less energy, and save you money in the long run. Now that’s a bright idea!\n\nOctober 2019 - 17,000 Pounds of Electronics Recycled\n\nCongratulations to our community for recycling over 17,000 pounds of electronics and raising $2,900 to support our Zero Waste programs. In seven years, we have now recycled over 120,000 pounds of electronics. Your efforts help keep harmful materials out of our landfill.\n\nSpecial thanks to the many people who helped make this event a success, including volunteers from the Wayne Green Team, Wayne State College Men’s Basketball team and WSC Women’s Soccer team; City employees Todd Hoeman and Officer Cory Moeller; our vendor First Choice Recycling; and the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy for grant funding.\n\nHousehold Hazardous Waste Collection on Saturday, October 12, 8-10 am at the Wayne Transfer Station, 110 Windom St. Your $10 drop-off fee includes household hazardous waste items such as latex and oil-based paint, pesticides, herbicides, oil, yard & garden chemicals, cleaning chemicals, anti-freeze, car batteries, mercury & mercury-containing devices including light bulbs. Household quantities only. Not Accepted: tires, household batteries, electronics, appliances, PCBs, picric acid, science lab materials, radioactive materials, or biological hazards. Sponsored by Northeast Nebraska RC&D, Nebraska Environmental Trust, Wayne Green Team and Gill Hauling.\n\nSeptember 2019 - Electronics Recycling: Saturday, Sept. 14th\n\nFor the seventh year in a row, the City of Wayne Green Team is hosting an electronics recycling collection event on Saturday, September 14 from 8:00am to 10:00 am (ends earlier if the truck fills up). Drive eastbound on 3rd Street between Lincoln and Pearl in front of the City Hall parking lot to responsibly dispose of your e-waste. Bring your old TVs, computers, cell phones, printers, cords and more to recycle right, and keep electronics out of the landfill, where they can become hazardous to our soil and groundwater.\n\nNote: this block of 3rd Street will be closed to traffic. Enter from Lincoln Street to unload your electronics and exit onto Pearl Street.\n\nFees: Suggested donation of $10 per carload or $50 per business load of reasonable size. Fees for CRTs (tube) are $5/monitor and $10/TV (no charge for flatscreens); and $10/microwave. Sorry, no large appliances, batteries or VHS tapes are accepted. A full list of acceptable items and fees are on our website.\n\nHOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE COLLECTION coming to Wayne in October. Date TBD. Details next month.\n\nAugust 2019\n\nThis summer, the blue recycling bins are back throughout Wayne city parks, making recycling accessible for people enjoying the outdoors. Look for twinned bins -- recycling and trash side by side. The parking recycling bins can only accept plastic bottles and cans that are empty of all liquids. Please do not put any other items in these bins, such as plastic straws, food wrappers, or even plastic cups, which all belong in the trash bin. Any amount of trash contaminates the recycling load. Grow an Extra Row for the Wayne Food Pantry\n\nIs your garden starting to overflow? Then now is the perfect time to help our local food pantry in Wayne by donating fresh produce from your garden. While picking your produce, set aside a bag of beans, a few tomatoes, spinach, cucumbers, squash or anything fresh from the garden. Bring your garden produce to the Wayne Food Pantry at the First Presbyterian Church, Tuesday-Friday, 9am-noon, or to the Mobile Food Pantry Truck at Our Savior Lutheran Church on the last Saturday of each month. It doesn’t have to be a lot, but if everyone contributes, it will add up fast. Thanks for growing that extra garden row! SAVE THE DATE: Electronics Recycling, Saturday, Sept. 14, 8-10 am. More details next month.\n\nJuly 2019 - Recycle Right in the Park\n\nThis summer, the blue recycling bins are back throughout Wayne city parks, making recycling accessible for people enjoying the outdoors. Look for twinned bins, recycling and trash side by side. The park recycling bins only accept plastic bottles and cans that are empty of all liquids. Please do not put any other items in these bins, such as plastic straws, food wrappers or even plastic cups, which all belong in the trash bin. Any amount of trash contaminates the recycling load.\n\nElectroncis Recycling Coming: Save the date of Saturday, September 14, 2019, 8am-10am on 3rd Street between Lincoln and Pearl Streets again. More details coming soon.\n\nJune 2019 - Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\n\nThe Wayne Farmer’s Market returns Wednesday, June 5, on the grounds of the Wayne County Courthouse off of Lincoln Street (due to construction), offering fresh seasonal produce, eggs, baked goods, jams and jellies, live music and much more. Updates will be posted on the Wayne Farmer’s Market Facebook page. Bring your reusable shopping bag to check out the Wayne Farmer’s Market this summer Wednesdays from 4-6 pm and Saturdays from 9am-noon, through mid-October.\n\nMay 2019 - Changes to Battery Recycling Program\n\nStarting May 1, we are implementing two big changes to our battery recycling program:\n\nOnly small, household batteries will be accepted for recycling. These include alkaline, zinc carbon, NiMH, NiCd, less than 9 volts, non-lithium button cell and lithium & lithium-ion with exposed terminals that require taping. We will no longer accept large batteries, such as lead acid, electronic batteries, and anything over 9 volts.\n\nThe battery drop-off location will move to the Wayne Public Library, at 410 Pearl Street, from City Hall.\n\nWhy are we making these changes? The battery recycling program started in December 2017 and has been a smashing success, preventing over 500 pounds of batteries with toxic materials from entering the landfill in our first year. Unfortunately, it has also cost more than expected -- $1,700. Each bucket holds up to 55 pounds of batteries and costs $110 to send to Battery Solutions for recycling. We often received boxes of larger-sized batteries, such as lead acid and 9+ volt batteries (e.g., drill batteries), that required additional funds to ship. Although our community’s willingness to recycle batteries is wonderful, we need to raise more funds to support this program.\n\nWhat should you do with your larger batteries? We may be able to accept them for a fee at our fall electronics recycling event, but until we secure more funding, we won’t know for sure. Stay tuned for more info. We do take free-will donations at any time via City Hall!\n\nHow are these batteries recycled? The Wayne Green Team sends these batteries to Battery Solutions in Michigan. They carefully sort the batteries based on chemistry to prepare them for recycling. To learn more about how these batteries are recycled, visit Battery Recycling Information.\n\nWhere can I find more info on the types of batteries accepted? See our updated Battery Recycling How To Guide on our website. It’s important to note which batteries require taped terminals for safety in shipping. Clear tape is provided next to the battery recycling bin at the library.\n\nApril 2019 - The Wayne Green Team Turns 10 Years Old!\n\nStarted in 2009 by former Mayor Lois Shelton, the Wayne Green Team is celebrating 10 years of service in our community. From Green Expos to Green Move Outs, Earth Day movies to Zero Waste Chamber Coffees, we have made an impact in reducing waste and increasing sustainable behavior.\n\nOver the last 10 years, we have recycled over 100,000 pounds of electronics, 79 tons of glass, 1,000 pounds of string lights, and 526 pounds of batteries. We have hosted: 5 Earth Day movies, 4 Green Expos, 3 Household Hazardous Waste events and 2 Green Move Outs at WSC. And, we have raised $42,000 in grant funds. Our efforts together make a positive difference. Let’s keep going on our journey to Zero Waste in Wayne America!\n\nThis April, join us as we celebrate our community’s annual Earth Day events to protect and sustain our planet and its resources.\n\nFriday, April 12, 10 am - Zero Waste Chamber Coffee. This event will be at the Wayne Public Library. Bring your own mug and see demos on what you can and cannot recycle in Wayne. #RecycleRight\n\nSunday, April 14, 6:30 pm - Tapped at the Majestic Theater. Join us at the Majestic Theater for a free screening of the powerful documentary Tapped, a behind-the-scenes look into the unregulated and unseen world of the bottled water industry -- an industry that aims to privatize and sell back the one resource that ought never to become a commodity: our water. Doors open at 6:30 pm for exhibits, raffles and discussion, and the 75-minute film begins at 7 pm. Raffle tickets are one for $5 or five for $20 and raise funds for the WSC Green Team. This free event is hosted by the WSC Green Team, the City of Wayne Green Team, and the A. Jewell Schock Museum of Natural History. Bring your own popcorn container and cup to make this a zero waste event.\n\nAlso, from now until May 31, Pac N Save will donate its 5-cent reusable bag credit to the Wayne Green Team. Please bring your bags to the store to shop and help raise funds to support our community’s Zero Waste programs.\n\nEvery day is Earth Day. Thank you for your support!\n\nFebruary 2019 - Love Food, Hate Waste\n\nWe may love food, but no one loves to waste it. Wasting food means wasting resources, time and money. So how can we stop? Try these five easy ways to reduce your food waste and increase your bottom line.\n\nBuy only what you need. Plan ahead and make a list before grocery shopping. Be smart about sales. It’s not a bargain if you won’t eat it.\n\nEat what you buy. Sounds simple, yet few people manage to do this effectively. Make a conscious effort to keep track of the food you have -- and then remember to eat it, especially those yummy leftovers.\n\nKeep food fresh. Learn to store foods properly to keep them fresh as long as possible.\n\nDon’t toss food before it spoils. Expiration dates don’t always mean the food has gone bad. It often means the food just can’t be sold at a store.\n\nAvoid the trash. If you have extra food, share it with others by giving to family, friends, coworkers, or our local Wayne Food Pantry. For the food scraps you can’t eat, consider backyard composting.\n\nJanuary 2019 - A Green Resolution for the New Year\n\nReady to start your new year off with a green resolution? Begin with a home cleanse by going through your house to see what you no longer need or use. Wayne has many options for you to donate or resell your stuff at our local consignment shops, thrift store, and more. A full list of where to take odds and ends in Wayne is posted on our website at www.cityofwayne.org/greenteam. It includes batteries, prescription medicine, eye glasses, books, plastic bags, inkjet cartridges, and more.\n\nYou can always recycle for free at the Wayne Recycling & Trash Station, located at 110 South Windom Street, and open Mon and Fri, 9:00 am - 1:30 pm, Tue 11 am - 2 pm, and Sat 8:00 am - noon. The station accepts glass, cardboard, plastics #1-7 (no plastic bags), and scrap metal, and has recycling drop offs for local Boy Scout Troop #174 of aluminum cans, newspapers, magazines, and mixed paper. You can still bring your strings of holiday lights to be recycled at the Wayne Recycling & Trash Center or City Hall.\n\nOctober 2018 - 18,000 Pounds of Electronics Recycled\n\nMany thanks to our community for making our 6th electronics recycling event on September 15, 2018, a success. We recycled nearly 18,000 pounds of electronics from over 100 households and five businesses. We collected 63 tube TVs, 11 tube monitors, and 8 microwaves. Overall, the event kept thousands of pounds of electronics out of the landfill and raised $2,400 to support our Zero Waste programs in Wayne.\n\nWe owe a special thanks to the many people who helped make this the best run event in our history, including volunteers from the Wayne State College Men’s Basketball and Women’s Soccer teams; City employees Earnest Ping and Officer Dominic Consoli; our recycling vendor DataShield; and the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality for grant funding.\n\nWith partners like these, the community of Wayne will continue to be successful in our efforts to Recycle Right and reach Zero Waste.\n\nSeptember 2018 - Electronics Recycling - Saturday, Sept. 15th\n\nFor the 6th year in a row, the City of Wayne is hosting an electronics recycling collection event on Saturday, September 15 from 8:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. (will end earlier if the truck fills up).

While picking your produce, set aside a bag of beans, a few tomatoes, spinach, cucumbers, squash or anything else from the garden. Bring your garden produce to the Wayne Food Pantry at the First Presbyterian Church, Tuesday-Friday, 9am-noon, or to the Our Savior Lutheran Church Food Pantry on the 4th Saturday morning of each month.

Nearly 3,000 pounds of HHW, or 1.5 tons, were properly disposed of and diverted from our landfills. Thank you for taking the time to Recycle Right!\n\nJune 2018 - Battery Collection and Transfer Station Updates Some updates to the options available for recycling and battery collection in Wayne!\n\nMay 2018 - Straws Suck, Sip Instead\n\nAmericans use and toss over 500 million plastic straws each day -- that’s enough to wrap around the Earth 2.5 times in one day. In only the past twenty years, people have come to expect plastic straws in every drink. These short-lived tools become garbage with no further thought, adding to the source of plastic pollution. Plastic straws cannot be recycled. They often end up in our oceans and waterways, causing severe harm to wildlife. Are a few minutes of drink convenience worth this much damage and garbage? We don’t think so.\n\nHere are three simple actions you can take to reduce plastic straw pollution:\n\nMake a personal commitment to say \"no\" to plastic straws. Whenever ordering a drink, politely request \"no straw, please.\" Encourage your friends and family to do the same.\n\nReach out to some local eateries in your neighborhood or town and ask them to change their protocol to only serve straws upon request.\n\nEncourage those eateries to make a change to non-plastic straw options -- like paper, glass or stainless steel -- if diners do request a straw.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/no-straw-please and https://thelastplasticstraw.org.\n\nApril 2018 - Celebrate Earth Day every day!\n\nEarth Day was first celebrated in 1970 on April 22 to focus a national day on the environment.

Bring your clean and rinsed glass bottles (including glass food and beverage containers and glassware such as wine and pint glasses, but NO windshields, ceramic, porcelain, or laminated glass) to the metal bins inside the Wayne Transfer Station. For your safety and to prevent contamination, do not lace glass directly into the concrete bunker outside. Also, remove any plastic bags as these cannot be recycled with glass. Thank you!\n\nFebruary 2018 - Where can I recycle plastic bags in Wayne?\n\nPlastic bags require a different type of recycling than plastic bottles and containers.

Many people think the bins next to the glass and plastics recycling areas are for plastic bags, but those contents are taken to the landfill. Take your plastic bags to the grocery stores for recycling. Better yet, bring your own reusable bag when you shop. Both Pac-N-Save and Quality Foods offer a reusable bag credit of 5 cents per bag.\n\nFood Labels 101 - February 12.

It doesn’t have to be a lot, but if everyone contributes, it will add up fast. Thanks for growing that extra garden row!\n\nElectronics Recycling Coming: Save the date of Saturday, September 23rd, 8 am - 11 am (or until the truck is full) on 3rd Street between Lincoln and Pearl Streets again. More details coming next month.\n\nJuly 2017 - Glass Recycling Makes a Ripple\n\nFor the past year, the City of Wayne has participated in a glass recycling program with Ripple Glass, a Kansas City company that recycles glass to remake into glass bottles and fiberglass insulation. The average American uses 80 pounds of glass every year, and all of it can be recycled over and over again. So why is it important to recycle glass? Here are four of the most important reasons:\n\nRecycling glass means less materials in our landfills, lengthening their life, which means fewer new landfills.\n\nMaking new glass out of existing glass conserves raw materials and eliminates the waste and environmental impact of mining.\n\nBecause glass melts at a lower temperature than its raw materials, making new glass out of existing glass uses 30% less energy! Consider this, recycling just one glass bottle saves enough energy to power a 23-watt CFL for 16 hours.\n\nMaking new glass out of existing glass dramatically reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Every ton of recycled glass means 600 pounds of carbon dioxide is not released into our atmosphere.\n\nMore than 80 communities recycling glass as part of the Ripple Glass network across seven states. In just eight months, we recycled 17 tons of glass, and we keep filling up the bunker at the transfer station. Know that your small act of recycling glass can make a big ripple!\n\nHOW TO RECYCLE GLASS IN WAYNE\n\nBring your clean and rinsed glass bottles (including glass food and beverage containers and glassware such as wine and pint glasses, but NO windshields, ceramic, porcelain, or laminated glass) to the metal bins inside the Wayne Transfer Station located at 110 South Windom Street. For your safety and to prevent contamination, do not place glass directly into the concrete bunker outside. Also, remove any plastic bags as these cannot be recycled with glass. Thank you!\n\nCHANGE IN TRANSFER STATION HOURS\n\nThe Wayne Transfer Station continues to be open on Tuesdays, but now closes at 2 pm instead of 6 pm. The station is open Monday and Friday 9 am - 1:30 pm, Tuesday 11 am - 2 pm, and Saturday 8 am-noon.\n\nJune 2017 - New Recycling Bins in Our Parks\n\nGet ready for cleaner parks and the opportunity to recycle in more public spaces thanks to collaborative funding through national, state and local partners.\n\nThis summer, blue recycling containers will be installed throughout Wayne city parks, making recycling more accessible for people enjoying the outdoors. Funding to purchase the 27 recycling containers was made possible because of a national grant by Dr. Pepper Snapple Group in collaboration with Keep America Beautiful; Nebraska Recycling Center’s Recycling Equipment Grant through the Nebraska Environmental Trust; and the City of Wayne.\n\nIn an effort to \"Twin the Bin\", recycling containers will be placed right next to a park’s trash bin, making recycling convenient and clear.\n\nThe City of Wayne became one of 41 other local governments and community organizations to receive the 2017 Dr. Pepper Snapple Group/Keep America Beautiful Park Recycling Bin Grant. Being awarded this national grant was years in the making, and took the help of students at Wayne State College and support from the Nebraska Recycling Council (NRC). The additional funding from NRC’s Recycling Equipment Grant and the City made it possible to purchase enough recycling containers to place at nearly all parks in Wayne.\n\nOver the year, the Green Team also has collected more than 30 tons of glass, aluminum, electronics and household hazardous waste materials from the community for recycling. The installment of the new recycling bins will not only divert even more materials from the landfill, but will also give everyone the opportunity to recycle at home, work and play.\n\nMay 2017 - What a Difference You Make\n\nCheck out the impact our community has made in reducing waste:\n\n66,000 pounds of electronics diverted from the landfill over 4 years from our electronics recycling events\n\nNearly 17 tons of glass collected in 8 months and recycled into glass insulation and bottles\n\n5,500 pounds of aluminum cans recycled by our local Boy Scout Troop Number 174 in 2016, raising $2,000 -- enough to send 7 Scouts to a week-long summer camp\n\n377 pounds of holiday strings of lights recycled in one year for the copper wire inside, a 74% increase from 2015\n\n$25,000 received in grant funds since 2013 to support our zero waste efforts in Wayne\n\nWe also had a great turnout at our Earth Day Events, with over 40 people attending our first Chamber Coffee and 70 people at our free screening of the movie Just Eat It.
