        "text": "Jimmy Wayne Blank was born August 26, 1960, to Robert and Nora (Williams) Blank. He passed away unexpectedly on September 18, 2023, at his home in Shambaugh Iowa.\n\nJimmy grew up in Coin and attended school at South Page. Although he didn’t graduate from there, he did receive his GED and went on to take college classes later in life. Jimmy was one of 5 children which included Robert Joey, Kathy Lynn, Jimmy Wayne, Timothy J and Michael John.\n\nJim held down many jobs throughout his life, he was a jack of all trades, he would say, and a master of none. He was a great handy man and willing to help anyone out if they needed it. He struggled with his demons off and on and when it got the best of him, he would remember to turn his attention to God and pray. Jim attended church in Shambaugh at the United Methodist Church the last few years, and off and on had a few bible study men’s groups he would attend as well. He had many friends who were there routing for him to do well.\n\nJimmy loved the open road and riding his motorcycle, he loved the little things in life, such as planting flowers and helping mow and weed eat out at the cemetery. He took pride in being a member of the Coin Fire and Rescue, just like his dad and brother Mike were.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Robert and Nora, and sister Kathy.\n\nLeft to cherish his memory is his daughter Hannah Blank, brothers Joe (sue) Blank, Tim Blank, and Mike (Yvonne) Blank, along with grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and many other family members and numerous friends."
