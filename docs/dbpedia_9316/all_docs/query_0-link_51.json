        "text": "Janice Handy, former editor of Country Folks Farm Weekly newspapers, passed away on Saturday April 13, 2013 at her residence surrounded by her loving family.\n\nBack in 1972, Mrs. Handy, began working for Lee Publications as editor of Country Folks, a weekly farm newspaper, to help her family’s business with needed income when prices paid to dairy farmers bottomed out.\n\nIn the early years at the paper, Mrs. Handy had to demonstrate she was knowledgeable in the subject matter and capable of working under deadlines. She worked through the entire newspaper process from editorial to printing, taught herself about milk commodities and government regulations, while learning agricultural practices and resources from her husband, a dairy farmer himself. Sprinkled throughout the paper was her strong affiliation to family and GOD. Her efforts to produce a quality newspaper, her drive to learn, and her passion for her job helped to make Country Folks a success.\n\nShe received numerous awards including the Northeast Farm Communicators Award, National and State FFA Recognition Award, Soil and Water Conservation Society Media Award, and Conservation Communicators Award. She served eight years on the executive committee for the New York State Grange. She also served on the New York State Governor’s Advisory Council on Agriculture for more than a decade.\n\nHandy was the recipient of the New York State 2002 Prime Time Award as the 2002 NYS Prime Time Outstanding Older Worker presented by former First Lady Hillary Clinton. Janice met the requirements of being at least 65 years old and working at least 20 hours in paid employment. She exceeded those requirements by being 73 years old and working in excess of 40 hours a week as editor.\n\nAs part of earning the 2002 award, Janice flew to Washington, D.C., to participate in the national competition. A highlight of the trip was a Black Tie Gala recognizing each state’s winner.\n\nJanice was a lifelong Grange member and a lifelong organist and member of the Crum Creek Evangelic Lutheran Church.\n\nJanice was born on April 26, 1929, in Fort Plain, NY; daughter of the late Perry and Lulu (Frederick) Streed. On Dec. 27, 1947 she was married to Keith Raymond Handy. Survivors include her sons: Keith Herbert Handy and his wife Juanita of St. Johnsville, Wayne Handy and his wife Sue of St. Johnsville and Dean Handy and his wife Julie of St. Johnsville; her daughters: Ann Marie Carter and her husband Jack of North Carolina, Karen Jones and her husband Tom of St. Johnsville and Marta Doxstader and her husband Paul of Remsen, NY; her brothers: Robert Streed and his wife Martha of Chicago, IL and Don Streed and his wife Brenda of Saratoga; her sisters: Shirley Fero of N. Utica and Thelma Safford and her husband Lee of St. Johnsville; her 24 grandchildren; 45 great grandchildren and numerous nieces, nephews and cousins. She was predeceased by her grandson Jason and by her great grandsons Matthew Bohannon and Justin Glynn.\n\nA religious service took place on Tuesday April 16 at the Evangelic Lutheran Church on Crum Creek Rd. and Twin Church Rd. St. Johnsville with Janice’s friend Darlene Spaulding officiating. Burial followed at the Handy Family’s Private Cemetery – Pleasant View Cemetery where she was laid to rest alongside her beloved husband.\n\nThe family requests donations in Janice’s name be made to the Crum Creek Church Preservation Society Inc., 43 Walnut St., Canajoharie, NY 13317-1365.
