        "text": "By Dixie Norwood\n\nMSNHA graduate assistant\n\nDid you know that the “Father of the Blues” was born and raised right in the heart of the Shoals area?\n\nWilliam Christopher Handy was born in 1873 in Florence. As a young child, he seemed to have a talent for music, but his family and his church disapproved of this type of life. However, throughout his childhood and adolescent years, his talent would not be denied. At one point, it is said that he saved up his own money and bought himself a guitar but was forced to take it back and exchange it for a dictionary.\n\nHandy was studious and, in 1892, he traveled about two hours to Birmingham to take the teaching exam offered there. He passed with exceptional marks and settled into a teaching position there in the city. But he soon discovered that teachers do not make a lot of money and he decided that this profession was not for him. While working as at a plant in Bessemer, he tutored young musicians and formed a small string quartet known as the “Lauzetta Quartet.”\n\nHis love of music took him to places such as Chicago, Indiana and St. Louis. While in Indiana, he joined a band that went on to be rather successful. An opportunity arose for Handy to join another group called the “Mahara’s Minstrels.” This group traveled the through much of the Southeast and even Cuba.\n\nIn 1903, a life-changing opportunity presented itself to Handy. He was asked to manage the Knights of Pythias out of Clarksdale, Mississippi. Six years later, he and his band moved to Memphis and Handy’s true passion began to shine. He began to compose music that would be known as the “blues,” including popular songs such as “Memphis Blues” and “St. Louis Blues.”\n\nA fall from a subway station in 1943 caused him to lose complete vision in his eyes and 12 years later, a stroke made him wheelchair- bound. His death three years later was a huge loss in the music community. It is estimated that over 150,000 people stood along the funeral route to pay their respects.\n\nAlthough Handy didn’t live in Florence during his music career, he often visited. His influence on the music profession is evident in his childhood town. The annual W.C. Handy Festival brings in visitors and other notable musicians to help carry on Handy’s love of music."
