        "meta_description": "Every boy will find something fun and fascinating in this official book inspired by the life and legacy of John Wayne. It's the perfect guide for boys on the cusp of becoming young men! If there’s one thing John Wayne admired, it was someone who could stand on their own two feet and take care of themselves no matter what the day might bring. Parents who know Wayne (and there are millions of them) admire those skills as well and feel strongly about raising their boys to be just as self-reliant. Similarly, boys are interested in learning how to camp, hike, explore and have adventures of their own. At the same time, they’re struggling to learn how to effectively transition to adulthood. The Official John Wayne Handy Book for Boys helps them learn both the outdoor skills they need to adventure safely, but also the life skills they need to navigate the real world like responsible young men. The book includes 100 essential skills, tips, activities and lessons for outdoor fun, responsible, safe adventures and real-world competence. Lessons are fully explained and enhanced with full color step-by-step illustrations where needed. From camping and fishing to managing their money, clearing up and everything in between, readers will discover four big sections covering a range of topics, including Outdoor Skills, Self-Sufficiency at Home, Acting Upwards and Fun & Games.The book also includes a foreword by Ethan Wayne, describing what it was like to grow up with such an independent father, a feature on what it means to be “self-sufficient,” and a list of Duke’s “Dos and Don’ts,” which help readers identify the thinking and decision-making that goes into being a good man.",
