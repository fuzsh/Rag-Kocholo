A broad heritage that includes enslavement in Kentucky, Georgia, and Tennessee; Native American tribal ancestors; and pioneer prosperity in early Michigan.\n\nBrought together through a special connection in late 19th century, a not widely known but enduring Black history legacy developed in Oakland County. This four-part article series will highlight recent findings about the Taylor, Cason, Farmer, and Harris families, and how they contributed to the story of Birmingham. Sources can be found here\n\nSeeking the History of People of Color\n\nWhen local historical societies and museums were being founded in America in the late 19th century, their focus was dominated by the European museum model. What was seen as historically important consisted of fine arts and culture, classical antiquities, scientific curiosities, and famous public figures1. Museums generally sought the unique, the special, and the influential for their displays and collections. The result is that most local history collections have preserved artifacts that tell the story of the settlement of a community and its male founders’ prosperity. The stories of everyday people, women, minorities, immigrants, and other marginalized groups have historically not been of sufficient interest to receive museum resources.\n\nIn the past few decades though, museums have worked to be more inclusive, to tell stories of the bigger picture. More resources are going into telling the whole story of a community, not just the accomplishments of the privileged few. Now, when Americans visit Thomas Jefferson’s Virginia home at Monticello, they will also see the real tragedy of enslavement that is part of that picture. Likewise, visitors can visit the Tenement Museum to immerse themselves in the historical experience of immigrants in New York City’s Lower East Side. These are just a few examples of the shift in public interest and in the expanded role of the historical museum toward a broader brush that reflects a community’s bigger truths 2. But most local history organizations have an uphill battle to try to gather information to tell a more inclusive story, since the materials are unlikely to have been preserved, and research can be quite difficult.\n\nThis was the situation we faced at the Birmingham Museum when we tried to fill in the blanks about local 19th century Black and Indigenous history in Oakland County. We knew we had merely scratched the surface in what we had discovered about George (1823-1901) and Eliza Taylor (1827-1902) (see A Tale of Four Families: The Black History of Birmingham, “Part I: The Taylors”). We desperately wanted to know more not only about the Taylors, but other people of color that had settled the area. We guessed that the Taylors, who lived in Birmingham for decades, might be more closely connected to similar families who had migrated here. We wondered about their connections to other local freedom-seekers and abolitionists and to the Underground Railroad in nearby Southfield and Farmington in Oakland County. As with our previous efforts with the Taylors, we had to backtrack and discover historical connections through a tedious process of elimination. But thankfully, we found excellent primary resources, publications, and personal history through our contact with the Harris Family. Linking this material together in a bigger picture led us to the Farmer family of Wayne County, who migrated from Delaware in the mid-19th century. A retrospective look at this family illuminates the key role they played in the Black and Indigenous history of early lower Michigan. 3 [Left-sketch of George and Eliza Taylor from the Birmingham Eccentric]\n\nNew Horizons\n\nIt was a different world in Michigan in the middle of the 19th century, yet in some ways it was the same as we know today: individuals and families responded to economic and cultural pressure to relocate for better opportunities. At the time, Michigan had only recently become a state. Large tracts of land had been wrested away from the Native American Indigenous people, and the federal government was fully engaged in policies that encouraged migration and agriculture in former wilderness areas. Farms in the east, which had been cultivated for a century or more, were static or even declining, whereas the great western unknown of the country (Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and beyond) held rich promise. Religiously and culturally, the close quarters and entrenched prejudice of the East chafed those with a different vision of the good life. Youthful and progressive attitudes of social equity for women and people of color were emerging across a wide spectrum of American society. New ideas and opportunities incited the dreams of whole communities of people in the east, who looked to the west and hoped for better lives for their families and descendants 4. [Below, map of Michigan from Mitchell's Tourist Pocket Map of Michigan, Philadelphia, 1835]\n\nIt was in this environment that free people of color also began to seek other places to start new lives. Non-white and bi-racial people were present in significant numbers in the U.S. from earliest colonial settlement, although not often well documented in official records. This is not only because of economic and cultural bias, but also because this population had lower social status, less wealth, and were less likely to be landholders. They were rarely able to vote or hold public office. They may also have held occupations that made them more mobile, such as laborers, sailors, or itinerant tradesmen. Or, for political reasons, they were left out of records—simply not deemed worthy of being officially documented.\n\nFree People of Color in the Eastern U.S.\n\nFree people of color had formed isolated but stable communities in many parts of the eastern U.S. for generations. Intermarrying over time, they sometimes developed unique mixed-race cultural identities5. These people were often found in former French and Spanish territories, and although having varied features, were often light-skinned individuals with part European ancestry whose mothers were free, or who had been freed by slaveholder fathers6.\n\nRecords of free people of color were kept in many slaveholding states in order to distinguish freed from enslaved people of African descent. These registers provide some records that assist researchers in identifying individual histories 7. However, these records do not account for those who escaped enslavement or were not actively recorded. Thus, significant numbers of mixed-race free people continued to live in small and isolated communities, engaged in subsistence farming, and might not be reflected in official records of the time. The primary source of historical information for their histories is family-centric and less accessible to outside researchers.\n\nAdditional factors contribute to lack of documents for these individuals. First, obstacles to land ownership by people of color leave few property or tax records. Furthermore, marginalization kept many people from being recognized through other forms of documentation, such as newspaper accounts. Thus, the predominant transmission of personal data and relationships was through family and church records, oral accounts, and photos. Especially lacking is documentation for those of Indigenous descent, many of whom lived and died without being entered into official records. As disinherited and displaced native peoples, they were not considered American citizens until the 20th century; they were deemed “foreigners,” and had few rights. In early census records, they were grouped as a total number, without distinction of name or gender, as “Indians,” or were omitted entirely8.\n\nMulti-Racial People in the 19th Century\n\nNative Americans had frequently been enslaved throughout colonial times, especially in territories controlled by the French, British, and Spanish9. After the late 18th century, however, enslavement of Indigenous people was rare. However, successive waves of treaties left them without their traditional homelands and Indian Removal policies of the 19th century transplanted whole tribes to the far western frontier. This reduced their numbers and their presence in the east.\n\nWhile native people diminished, enslaved Africans increased in number. People of African American descent (both free and those escaping enslavement) formed small communities with Indigenous people and other free people of color10. Their social status was limited by their mixed heritage as well as lack of education, although free people of color might be employed in skilled trades such as carpentry, masonry, or smithing. Farming, however, was their primary occupation. When opportunities opened up in Michigan and other western territories, these skills were especially desirable, paving the way for migrating people of color to be successful in their new communities 11. [Right- Indigenous people such as the Delaware Lenni-Lenape were considered ‘foreigners’ and not counted in early census records.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape#/media/File:Lenape01.]\n\nCensus Inconsistency\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the federal census began to classify all people of apparent mixed racial and cultural backgrounds simply as “Mulatto,” while classifying those of apparent African American ancestry as “Black” or “Negro.” 12 The catchall “Mulatto” categorization makes no meaningful distinction about the people it was used to describe, providing little useful information to historians and genealogists. Census enumerators, who were from the local community and usually knew the people they were recording, subjectively interpreted its application and used it inconsistently. It is common to find census records across the decades in which the same family members are classified as “Black,” “Mulatto,” and “White.” Later, when family and individual names were recorded, it is possible to trace individuals and families. Their racial ancestry may be presumed to be Black based on later records, when the story is really much more complex than that. Such is the case with a particular extended free family of color who migrated from Delaware to western Wayne County: The Farmers. [Left- In 1850, the U.S. Census instituted a category, “Mulatto” to indicate persons of mixed racial heritage.https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/race/MREAD_1790_2010.html ]\n\nThe Farmer Family of Delaware\n\nAbraham (Abel) Farmer (1795-c. 1830) and his wife Mary Miller Farmer (1790-1881) were from the area around Kent and Sussex County, Delaware, and married about 1820, according to family history. (It had to be after August, since the census for Dagsboro Hundred, Sussex County counts Abel as a single man. Map of Dabsboro Hundred at left. Map, Pomeroy and Beers Atlas (1868), The Delaware Geological Survey, https://www.dgs.udel.edu/delaware-1868-hundreds-maps). Abel and Mary had five children under the age of 10 when Abel died around 1830: Henry (1820-1883), Joseph (Josiah) (1823-1871), John (1825-1903) Catharine (1827-1850) and Nancy (1829-1882) 13.\n\nSome family history notes that Abel was in Wayne County, Michigan when he died in 1830; however, it is more likely that his identity was confused with a descendant of the same name who died in Wayne County at a later date. Assuming Abel died in Delaware before the 1830 census, it is conceivable that his young family would be living in a relative’s household at the time of the count. There were no Farmers noted in that census, but several with Mary’s family name (Miller) in Kent County, where she was born. However, only one of them, John Miller (n.d.), possibly a brother or cousin, was head of a large household of free people of color whose ages and gender match the range that correspond to Mary and her children. By the 1840 Delaware census, Mary was head of her own household and four of her children are with her. One family member was employed in agriculture, possibly her son Henry or John. By 1850, her son John was head of household, and she lived there with all her adult children 14.\n\nThe Farmer family unit experienced significant change in the next few years. Some time after the 1850 census, Catharine died. Within just a few years, the remaining Farmers were joined by several other families of their community in a major migration from their traditional home to faraway southern Michigan. Led first by Joseph (Josiah) Farmer and his family in 1856, they were all established in Michigan by December of 1858, when John Farmer married Margaret Durham (1825-1900). Soon afterward, Nancy Farmer married William H. Dean (1835-1926), fellow Delaware migrant, in Wayne County in 1860 15.\n\nMulatto, Black, or “Delaware Moor”\n\nIn the U.S. Census for 1820 in Dagsboro Hundred, Sussex, Delaware, Abel Farmer was marked as a ‘Foreigner’ (e.g., Native American). By contrast, in 1840, when Mary was identified as head of household, she and her children are categorized as ‘Free Persons of Color.’ And, in 1850, the family is categorized as “Mulatto\"16. But none of these records tell the real story of their ancestry very well. It happens that the Farmers and Millers were part of a unique blended racial and cultural group known as the “Delaware Moors.”\n\nThe “Moors” traced their roots to the early 18th century, when the intermingling of Lenni-Lenape and/or Nanticoke Indigenous people, enslaved or freed African Americans, and Europeans resulted in communities of free persons of color in the area of central Delaware and near New Jersey. One tradition suggests that their European ancestry was from 18th century Spanish pirates evading authorities. This is said to be the origin of the name, “Moors.”17 [Left-An unknown family of Delaware Moors. https://bethelburyinggroundproject.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/moors.jpg ]\n\nPeople belonging to Delaware Moor communities remained in the same geographical area of Sussex and Kent Counties of Delaware for generations, intermarrying within large extended families. The Moors set themselves apart from other communities of color, and resisted efforts to group them with other people of mixed-race ancestry. In the early to mid-20th century, they received attention from anthropologists, who described the community as a kind of “clan” who valued their blended ancestry as special and distinctive. In 1914, the State of Delaware agreed, recognizing “Moor” as a special designation of race that was relevant to election rights and the voting process.18\n\nNowadays, the people formerly known as “Delaware Moors” are incorporated within the Nanticoke and Lenni-Lenape tribal confederation, underscoring the significance of the Native American component of their ancestry.19\n\nThe Melting Pot of Michigan\n\nWith their strong family affiliation as Delaware Moors, it makes sense that when the Farmers, Millers, and Deans migrated to Michigan, they would remain in close proximity. This is borne out by their relocation to the western Wayne County area in the 1850s and beyond. They continued to keep familial and cultural identity intact through intermarriage once they moved. But why did they leave Delaware, their ancestral home, when they did? Why not twenty years earlier, or later? Why Wayne County? Why Michigan?\n\nThese are questions we local historians sometimes forget to ask, when we can be so intent on just getting the facts right in the first place. But it can make all the difference in understanding the personal response to the forces behind these such disruptive life events. If we consider that the most common reason for migration is economic and/or socio-political, it helps us gain perspective by looking at the environment and precipitating events behind such upheaval. A more compelling reason likely exists for migration than simply “seeking a better opportunity.” [Right-Farmer, John. Map of Wayne County, exhibiting original land purchases…(1855) Library of Congress, https://www.loc.gov/item/2012593158/]\n\nIn the 1850s, it appears that free people of color were leaving Delaware and other states bordering slaveholding states due to intensifying racial pressure and social restriction. Mounting discrimination and Jim Crow laws were bringing multi-racial communities under increasing scrutiny in the years leading up to the Civil War. Even the well-established, law-abiding Delaware Moors had begun to feel the racial bite of forces that were polarizing the country. Under these circumstances, Michigan was an attractive option. Already building a reputation as a haven for freedom seekers fleeing enslavement, it seemed a safe place for people of color to live and raise their children. Furthermore, it had a robust agricultural economy, a future with railroads and waterways, and needed migrants who knew how to farm and were willng to work hard. A recently published 1855 map of Wayne County by noted cartographer John Farmer could have played a role as well; it laid out the county’s farmlands and landowners, a handy bit of information for migrating farmers to have.20\n\nThe migration wave of Delaware Moors to Michigan took over twenty years, and involved hundreds of individuals. But a few families led the way in 1856, and one of the first, if not the very first, was the son of Abel and Mary Farmer, Joseph (Josiah) Farmer and his wife Elizabeth (Eliza) Miller Farmer (1826-1871).21 When Josiah and Eliza migrated to Michigan in late 1855 or very early in 1856, they settled in the farmland of Nankin Township in western Wayne County (now Westland). With six children under the age of 15, the couple soon had their 7th child in their new home in February of 1856. Eliza and Joseph had four more children in Michigan. It is this particular Delaware Moor family and its descendants that figure into Birmingham’s remarkable Black and Native American history. [Left-Detail, Nankin Township, Wayne County, showing the 30 acre parcel owned by Josiah Farmer in Section 15. H.C.

(Note nearby location of Dean family, fellow Delaware Moors.)]\n\nThe Impact of Progress\n\nJosiah and Eliza’s family grew and prospered in their new community. Fellow Delaware Moors the Millers, Perkins, Counselors and Deans also located in the vicinity. The Farmers worked hard, and by the 1870s, had acquired 30 acres of prime farm property in Nankin Township. Their relations likewise acquired property nearby, continuing their community’s farming lifestyle and tradition."
