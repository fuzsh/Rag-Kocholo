        "text": "(1790–1867). U.S. lawyer James Wayne was an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1835 to 1867. Although a Southerner, he remained loyal to the Union and served the court throughout the American Civil War.\n\nJames Moore Wayne was born about 1790 in Savannah, Ga. He graduated from Princeton University in New Jersey in 1808 and was admitted to the bar in 1810, after which he started to practice law in Savannah. After serving in the War of 1812, he was elected to the legislature for his opposition to an act suspending the collection of debts; he then served as mayor of Savannah from 1815 to 1817 and as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas. In 1822 he was named judge of the Superior Court and six years later was elected to the U.S. Congress, in which he served three terms."
