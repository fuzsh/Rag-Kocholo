In the world of hip-hop, diss tracks have always been a potent weapon used by artists to settle scores and assert dominance. One such track that shook the rap community to its core was "Drop A Gem On 'Em," a scathing response by Mobb Deep to Tupac's infamous diss track, "Hit Em Up." Released on August 25, 1996, "Drop A Gem On 'Em" became an emblem of the intense rivalry between East Coast and West Coast rap that defined the mid-90s.

About Drop A Gem On â€™Em (2Pac Diss)

The genesis of the Mobb Deep and Tupac feud can be traced back to November 1994 when Tupac was robbed and shot at a recording studio in New York. The incident stoked the flames of an already tense feud between Tupac and The Notorious B.I.G., but it also drew the Mobb Deep duo into the crossfire. Tupac, always zealous and vigilant when it came to protecting his Thug Life persona, was particularly offended by Mobb Deep's song "Survival Of The Fittest," where the chorus chanted, "Thug Life, we still living it." As the creator of Thug Life, Tupac felt personally slighted and saw it as a sign of disrespect.

While Tupac was serving time in prison on a sex abuse charge, he learned about Mobb Deep's song from his crew, Tha Outlawz. Fueled by a strong sense of indignation, Tupac decided to confront Mobb Deep during one of their concerts in New Jersey. Tha Outlawz, acting on Tupac's behalf, confronted Mobb Deep to test their allegiance to Thug Life. The encounter left Tha Outlawz feeling disrespected, and Tupac's rage intensified.

Mobb Deep, on the other hand, maintained that they were unaware of Tupac's grievances when they recorded "Survival Of The Fittest." They claimed that the song's lyrics were not intended as a direct diss and apologized for any misunderstandings. Nevertheless, the damage had been done, and Tupac would not let Mobb Deep off the hook so easily.

Thus, "Drop A Gem On 'Em" emerged as Mobb Deep's bold response to Tupac's menacing "Hit Em Up." The track unleashed a barrage of lyrical blows aimed at Tupac and his crew, effectively establishing Mobb Deep's defiance in the face of a formidable adversary. With aggressive and powerful verses, Havoc and Prodigy showcased their lyrical prowess, exhibiting a level of intensity and rawness that mirrored the East Coast rap scene of the time.

Notably, "Drop A Gem On 'Em" samples "Can't Help But Love You" by The Whispers, adding a hauntingly melodic layer to the track's hard-hitting beats and relentless verses. The juxtaposition of the soulful sample with the aggressive lyrics creates a captivating sonic experience that draws listeners into the heart of the diss track.

Unfortunately, the release of "Drop A Gem On 'Em" was overshadowed by the tragic events that followed. Just weeks after the track's release, Tupac Shakur was fatally shot in Las Vegas on September 13, 1996. In a display of respect, Mobb Deep decided to pull "Drop A Gem On 'Em" from the airwaves, recognizing the devastating loss the rap community had suffered.

Even though the song was released during a tumultuous period in rap history, "Drop A Gem On 'Em" continues to hold its place as a testament to the fiery spirit of Mobb Deep. It reflects the depth of emotions and fierce rivalry that defined an era in hip-hop, reminding us of the power of music to both unite and divide.

So, dive into the gritty world of '90s rap battles with "Drop A Gem On 'Em" and experience the musical combat between Mobb Deep and Tupac at its most explosive.
