        "text": "04 Nov 2016\n\nAriana and the Rose\n\nSupercool\n\nAWAL/Kobalt\n\nWE SAY\n\nReleased today (November 4) and with an EP due in February, New York’s Ariana and the Rose have created something rather special here. You might have seen her at The Great Escape back in May or one of her support slots for Jack Garratt, Wolf Gang and Foxes. Her sound is icy modern synth pop, stuffed with low rumbling bass lines and earworms aplenty. It’s dark but it’s filled with glamour at the same time, designed to take you off into another world when you hit the dancefloor. This is the follow up to the double A-sided Survival Of The Fittest and Dirty Dancing, which picked up a stack of tastemaker praise including Wonderland Mag, Notion, Red Bull, Hunger and Clash. Produced by Tom Fuller, there's a remix too from London-based big beat duo Toyboy & Robin. More live events are planned after her acclaimed 360° immersive Light & Space party in London - next comes one in NYC in January. With a keen eye on making visuals a key part of the musical experience, this superb single is a statement of intent that’s sure to become one of her anthems. Very super cool, indeed.\n\nCONTACTS\n\nLabel: Matt Riley, AWAL/Kobalt [UK] / Michele Riggi, AWAL/Kobalt [US]\n\nPublishing: Pookiebird\n\nNational Radio: Mark Murphy, Dawn Promotions, +44 (0)7711 592 455\n\nOnline: Shane Hawkins, WMA, +44 (0)7531 490 142\n\nClub: Mark Loverush, Power, +44 (0)20 8932 3030\n\nManagement: Charlotte Scott, 13 Mile Music, +44 (0)7971 075 747"
