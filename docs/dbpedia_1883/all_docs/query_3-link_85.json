        "text": "That conclusion comes from a demographic study of men born in Sweden between 1850 and 1915. Although it is understood that natural selection has conserved mechanisms to spontaneously abort fetuses — overwhelmingly male fetuses — that are unlikely to survive cold weather, the ages achieved by men born during mild periods who then confront frigid winters at tender ages, has been left unanalysed.\n\nNow Ralph Catalano, of the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues, have placed records of cohort survival from age one next to an estimation of warm-to-cold temperature shifts that occurred from ages one to four. As expected, the males born in gentle conditions who then met tough times did not live as long as males born during other times. This result holds when adjusted for the longevity of females. The authors propose that developing countries that are less able to shield themselves against extremes of weather are most likely to see an effect on their already relatively short lifespans."
