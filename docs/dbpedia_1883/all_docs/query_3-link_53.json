        "text": "Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP): To predict the range of each of eleven chameleon species, GARP develops a random set of mathematical rules based on the environmental characteristics at a species occurrence point—rainfall, temperatures, elevation, etc. A rule might be “Where rainfall and temperature are high, this chameleon species will exist, “ or “Where elevation is higher than 900 meters, this species will not exist.” To GARP, each of those rules is a gene, which it combines in random ways to produce hundreds of possible models of where a species should and shouldn’t live.\n\nGARP evaluated the models based on the number of chameleon location points from the original museum records it correctly predicted, as well as by its ability to identify places where the species would not be found. GARP kept evolving the mathematical rules of the survivors and deleting the losers until it produced a single model that it couldn’t improve upon—survival of the fittest.\n\nWhen the scientists launch GARP, all of those calculations that drive the evolution of the best model take place in a single run of the program. Because GARP comes up with its initial set of predictive rules randomly, the surviving model will be slightly different each time. To capture that diversity, Raxworthy explains, “we ran GARP a hundred times for each species, so in the end, we had a hundred models for each chameleon species. It was like letting evolutionary history repeat itself a hundred times and seeing what it came up with.”\n\nFrom the 100 possible models, the computer selected the 10 best. To make this final cut, the models had to meet two criteria: they had to predict a species range that included at least 90 percent of the original chameleon location data, and they couldn’t predict a species range that covered a very large or a very small part of Madagascar."
