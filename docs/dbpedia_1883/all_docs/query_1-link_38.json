        "text": "I met Tom Buick in an Operating Room. We both worked Surgery at \"Mission Hospital\" and we shared an interest in playing and recording music. This \"Southpaw\" plays the Blues like the best in the business. ( He lived the blues for a while and it rubbed off on him I think....) Some of my earliest \"pre-Verge\" songs were recorded with Tom's talent and help and most of my original music equipment came from \"Honest Tom's\" Home \"Music Store\".\n\nThis guy had 10 Guitars at any given time and he was always looking for the latest technology in instruments and recording gear. Most people never even heard of a \"Synth Guitar\" and Tom was the first kid on his block to own a Roland GR 707. (he could make it sound like a jet plane) As he scaled up on his technology addiction, I took his older gear on layaway. One night as I headed home from band practice, my truck was rammed by a drunk (ironically, he drove a buick). My Stratocaster flew out onto the ground and came to rest under the smashed up buick. It was still in perfect tune when I opened the case but it was cursed,doomed and never stayed in tune again. A few weeks later, Tom invited me to his house and handed me a brand new Telecaster. I have owned and played a dozen guitars over the years but that Telecaster is my number 1 guitar. I have had arguments with Strat lovers about the sweet versatility of the Tele and although I do use a Strat from time to time, I'm a \"Tele\" Man Period. Tom Buick is a great friend and will always be close to me. You should here this guy play..... I can still hear him today.\n\nTom introduced me to Dr. Steve Garber (Anesthesiologist) during Surgery and the three of us began meeting and playing. Steve played drums and had a great interest in Midi and keyboard programming. Tom and Steve helped me to record \"Forever With You\" at Saddleback College and we gradually formed the original band, The Verge\". Steve was a good drummer and a very talented keyboard player/programmer. His melodies were catchy and among his great contributions was a song that caught instant radio play \"Newport Breezin\". I still hum that riff and I am reminded of driving my convertible down PCH at sunset.\n\nSteve shelled out hundreds of dollars for rehearsal time and equipment and cassettes. His dedication and drive was the foundation of the Verge and I am forever indebted to him for his generosity. He was not your typical Anesthesiologist and I treasure our experiences. I remember a call from Steve one day. He had heard from Berry (Motown) Gordy's brother Rodney (Jobete Music, Avatar, Sony, MTV, Anita Baker). Rodney was interested in our demo, Steve's song Searchin' and my vocals.\n\nWe played a number of small gigs and a few prominent affairs. As our catalog grew, we added a few players to the mix.\n\nI met Steve Melmet while attempting to collect on the drunk crash incident. Steve was a lawyer from Santa Ana and during one of our discussions, I learned that he was a Bass Player. Steve was a good friend and a good bass player. In fact, I bumped into him in Las Vegas last year and his practice has expanded. All around good guy!.\n\nThe Verge was not complete until we added John Summers. John was an extraordinary keyboard player and I believe he regularly dabbled in \"genius\". From his lounge lizard ditty \"Barbara Boxer\" to his 31 minute rendition of \"Light My Fire\" (on lead guitar AND keyboard), John was the spark plug of the Verge and he brought a mix of \"Jonathan Winters\" meets \"Jack Black\" meets \"Neil Young\" meets \"The Lizard King\" to our humble little band.\n\nI left the Verge in the late 90's and most of the guys stayed together for a while. The following songs are from the original \"Verge\" demo by our original trio and I added a copy of \"Survival Of The Fittest\" (Steve Garber's song) that we recorded before we added players.\n\nSteve Garber might still have some of the original \" Verge\" demos if you are interested. I'm in the process of finding him as I write this."
