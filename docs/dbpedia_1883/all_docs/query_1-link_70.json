        "text": "Sacha Jenkins\n\nSo, Havoc and Prodigy. Here we are, years later. We see where hip-hop has come and gone, but I wanna start out with before hip-hop. Havoc, for instance, I first met Havoc as a graffiti writer.\n\nHavoc\n\n[laughs] Yeah.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nWe were in Queens, and the middle track where they park the train is called the layup. When trains are out of service, thatâs where they would park them. And the first time I met Havoc was with a guy from Queensbridge who wrote DMC, who was a friend of mine, who was in my crew. And he was like, âYo, my little man is a real ill artist. You know, he has the fever, he wants to hit these trains.â And so, the thing about hitting the trains was you didnât want to go from the platform. So youâd have these beams on the side that hold up the... Where the trains are elevated. I just saw this little dude climb up the beam like it was nothing. So, I knew from a very young age that he was artistically inclined. And then I also know that the gentlemen to his right, they both went to art and design high school.\n\n[applause]\n\nSo, a lot of recording artists are also fine artists. And because their minds are wired differently, fine art is a way to express themselves. So, I wanted to ask you guys about, you know, your interest in art or drawing, and how you guys wound up at a specialized high school for art.\n\nHavoc\n\nWell, I started art, like, from a young age. Since I was like maybe three or four. You know, I drew a picture of my mother when she was pregnant, when I was like three. And it just started from there. My father was an artist, and I always liked to draw. So naturally, choosing a high school, you know, Art and Design was one of the best places for me to hone in on my artistic skills and the rest was history after that. In 1988, thatâs when I went to Art and Design, and met P.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nHow about you, P, in terms of drawing, or how thatâs just another manifestation of your creativity?\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah, I mean, I really went to Art and Design âcause a lot of my friends in the neighbourhood were going there, so I just wanted to be with my friends. I really wasnât into art that much. I got into it by going to that school and being around everybody like Hav and certain people that I met that was really into art. They got me more into it than I was. But Hav is like incredible with it.\n\nHavoc\n\nIâm all right.\n\n[laughter]\n\nProdigy\n\nNah, when we was in the crib one day, he drew my face perfectly with a pen, just making dots. Like, no mistakes, with a pen. Heâs ill with it. But I just really went to be there when my friends was there. And I ended up, me and Hav, and it just ended up being something else.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo then the art went from... Maybe in the studio heâs drawing perfect pictures of you, but together, in the studio as artists you were painting different kinds of pictures. And thatâs when the first record, soon after, came. Tell us about those early days.\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah, the early days was like, when we first met, started hanging out, we both had love for the music. It was a lot of traveling on the train. We would take the train every day to Coney Island, to the only studio that we could really use for a good price that we could afford, was in the projects out in Brooklyn, in Coney Island. We used to go out there and every day we used to cut out of school and take the train. It was like an hour, two hour ride, you know, work on songs, work on our demo, put together a nice demo so we could start shopping around. So a lot of those early memories, itâs just like, being on the train with some 40s, smoking weed between train cars, and on the train, stuff that you canât even do today in New York, really.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nAnd you were also interested more in the production end back then, right?\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah, you know I was just trying my hand at it back then, that was when I first started really getting into it. I think Hav really inspired me to do it because we used to go to his crib, I think it was the one in Ravenswood. And you used to have the records, with a stereo cassette deck, with record on it.\n\nHavoc\n\nDouble cassette tape deck.\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah, and he used to do record and pause, record and pause, record and pause, and loop a beat up on cassette. That was the first time I ever seen something like that, and he was actually making beats like that. He would record songs from the radio. He would listen to radio shows late at night and catch some ill samples. And Havâs pop was a DJ, so he had a lot of records and that was the first time I seen somebody sampling and looping like that, and it got me into wanting to try that, too.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nWho did you say was a DJ?\n\nHavoc\n\nOh, my pops.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nI mean, your pops was an artist, a DJ; tell us about him.\n\nHavoc\n\nArtist, DJ. You know, we fell asleep to banging music. You know, we were like five years old and the music is just banging in the little-ass apartment. So, we was just so used to music and, you know, after Pops bounced, he left the records. So, I kept them sh--s, put some use to it.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo, language is a big part of what you guys do. Iâm from Queens, and different boroughs have different ways to express where they come from. You guys were big proponents of the Dunn language [East Coast hip-hop slang], and, you know, English obviously is the foundation of how we speak, but you guys are architects of your own language, and thatâs an important part of Mobb Deep is, because that also traveled, and had an influence, and helped to create different dialects based on what you guys created. Talk about language. I mean, I know itâs a little all over the place, but I think itâs a big part of what you guys bring to the table.\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah, that really like came from, like Queensbridge, period. Like, Queensbridge is the biggest projects in America. You know, itâs 96 buildings, and itâs just a lot going on out there, man. And thereâs so many styles and slang, it was just like a breeding ground for uniqueness out there. So when I first came out there, I seen all that immediately. The way they dress different, talk different slangs, and like you say, each neighbourhood, each region got their own way of talking. Down south theyâll say something, Queens, Brooklyn, The Bronx, they got different slangs everywhere. So, Queensbridge just had a real unique slang and dress and all that. One of our friends from out there, his nameâs Bumpy. You know, he had a speech impediment, and every time he used to say âSonâ â you know everyone was like, âYo! What up, son?â â he used to be, âYo! What up, dunn?â He used to talk with a lisp, so we started all just saying it, âYo! What up, dunn? What up, dunn?â\n\n[laughter]\n\nYou know what I mean? And it just all came from there. That was like a part of it, and then we turned it into a whole, like, our version of pig Latin. Like, we wanted to talk to each other, and if we didnât want somebody around us to know what we were talking about, we be like, âYo, dunn! Dorty over there got the datty.â\n\n[laughter]\n\nLike, you know what I mean? So thatâs where that came from, the dunn language.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nHavoc, can you hip us to any other dunn language jewels we didnât know about? Dainy, tell us about Dainy!\n\nHavoc\n\nOh yeah, I mean, exactly; it [a brand of malt liquor] was called St. Ides, but we called it Dainy. We used everything with the dunn language, and it just turned into that sh--. It was crazy.\n\n[applause]\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nOK, yeah, give it up for him. I mean, thatâs a serious cultural McNugget right there, where that came from. Who knew? Speech impediments. Queensbridge during that era, when you guys were making that music... I mean what a lot of people donât understand is, you know, I did an article for Vibe, I think it was about â95, I interviewed everyone from Queensbridge and what was going on then. And a lot of guys who were down with these guys are no longer with us. And the climate and the intensity that you feel on this record, if you understand where they come from, you understand when this guy says, âThereâs a war going on outside,â there literally is a level of intensity that. I canât say itâs necessarily on par with someone who is in the Middle East or something right now, but for a lot of these young black and Latino individuals, it was a very intense time. So, talk about what you remember, sitting on the park bench; talk about some of the cats who arenât with us anymore, who are integral to what created that album.\n\nHavoc\n\nI mean, itâs a lot of situations out there like, you got six blocks out there. Each block is like its own neighbourhood, and [that] just makes Mobb Deep. I mean, Queensbridge, you know what Iâm saying? So, you might have dudes from two different blocks, that might used to have been friends. And now the next thing you know, they beefinâ over who can sell drugs on the hill. And next thing you know theyâre just shooting at each other, killing each other like, you know? My man Draws, god bless the dead, he used to gun it out all the time. And my brother, Killer Black, rest in peace, god bless the dead, he was one of the wildest dudes out there. And he used to hang with dudes from the other block, like, the opposition block. And our block, where we was from, was where he was hanging with them. So, he used to have to come home to where the beef was at, you know what Iâm saying? And niggas used to have to come to me like, âYo, son! You know, your brother, heâs from the block,â but they knew not to touch him. So, the thing is, when youâre going through things like that, where you could just come outside, and your brother got beef with somebody, he shoot them, and the next thing you know, you gotta watch yourself, because your brother done shot somebody in the face, and you sitting in your car, nigga wetting your whole car up, what other kind of music you gonna make?\n\n[applause]\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah.\n\n[laughter]\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo how many cats who were on skits, who were on the records, who were part of your crew back then, how many of them are still around? Are a lot of them still around?\n\nProdigy\n\nThereâs very few. We lost a lot of friends to jail, murder. A lot of people you just outgrow, you know what I mean? People go they separate ways, man, down the line. When you get older you see that certain people got hidden agendas and certain people were loyal.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nWhen you look back now, looking at literally, you guys were in a war. When you look at that album, what do you think it represents in terms of where you guys were in your lives at that time?\n\nHavoc\n\nI mean, it represents the struggle, the hunger, the will, to wanting to make a better situation for yourself, get up out of the projects, make a better living for your family. But to make it out of there is nothing short of a miracle. Just any kind of circumstances could put you in the grave. From police, planting stuff in your car and in your pockets, putting you in jail, from the dude thatâs jealous of you because youâre shining a little bit more than him. Like I said, itâs nothing short of a miracle, making it out of there. And that era right there, the album that we did, it just describes just that. If you listen to it word for word, you got a lot of rappers out there, they be rapping, and they just be lying a lot. But the sh-- that we went through is just so real, itâs just a blessing that we, us two, are still here.\n\n[applause]\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nAnd to bring it full circle, I mean, this is the same cat on that album who said, no matter how much loot he gets, heâs staying in the projects forever. Thatâs how you felt.\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, that was metaphorically âcause people always come to me, âYo! I thought you wasnât leaving the projects.â\n\n[laughter]\n\nYou know what Iâm saying? What I meant is that my heart would never leave the projects. Itâs like, I always will remember where I came from, you understand what Iâm saying? When people would take these words literally Iâd be like, âWhat grade you graduated from? What school? Oh, you didnât finished, just like me. No doubt.â\n\n[laughter]\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nWell, your heart obviously, you guys represent that to the fullest, and this album is the epitome of that. Talk about how you guys came up with the title The Infamous Mobb Deep.\n\nProdigy\n\nWell The Infamous, that came from one of our homeboys that got killed, god bless the dead. His name is Jammy, and he was from Brooklyn, from Brownsville, and he had moved to Queensbridge, and he was back and forth always. Jammy was like one of our strongest in the crew. He was a Golden Gloves boxer, and he was out there busting his hammer, too. He was a dangerous dude. We used to chill all the time. He had this tattoo on his arm that said âThe Most Infamous,â I believe, right?\n\nHavoc\n\nYep.\n\nProdigy\n\nIt said âThe Most Infamousâ on his arm. He gave us that name. He was like, âYo! Yâall the infamous Mobb Deep. Yâall infamous.â We just ran with it from there.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nAnd then you took it to another level with the imagery, using the sort of Queensbridge, you know, âWelcome to Queensbridge.â\n\nHavoc\n\nThe housing authority sign, yeah. We just took that and just put it as Mobb Deep, you know what I mean? Word.\n\n[applause]\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nGive it up for using the projects... Hereâs an example of using the projects to take you to the next level.\n\nProdigy\n\nIt was like, using it was just like, welcome to our world. Just like it say welcome to whatever houses all over New York, for the projects. You know, the infamous Mobb Deep; in other words, welcome to our world.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nGetting back to your dad a little bit, Havoc, your last name is Muchita.\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nIs that Latino?\n\nHavoc\n\nNo, from what my grandmother told me, itâs like Creole or something like that.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo your people are from New Orleans, Louisiana?\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, you could say that. [laughs]\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nThe brother to your right, he has an amazing book [My Infamous Life: The Autobiography of Mobb Deep's Prodigy]. How many people have copped this book?\n\n[applause]\n\nI want to hear more claps. You should buy it because itâs probablyâ¦\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah, go get it. Go get it.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nI donât even know how to feel about it. Very few people in hip-hop have the foresight, the will or the guts to sort of put out a lot of the things that he put out there, and I think itâs really healthy. For those people who donât know, you got a bit into your family background. Where are your people from?\n\nProdigy\n\nMy family is from the South. Virginia, Texas, the Carolinas, and they moved up, up top to New York, chased that fast money and that dream. My grandparents, my immediate grandparents, they were into music. My grandfather was a famous jazz musician by the name of Budd Johnson. He played the saxophone and the clarinet. He taught music, actually, at a national community college. My grandmother, she was one of the first Cotton Club dancers up in Harlem, so she was real big into dancing, and she created her own dance company called the Bernice Johnson Cultural Arts Center, which was based down in Queens. They were always into music, and I grew up around them watching them conduct their business and how they went about it in the music industry.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nI mean, the two of you both, between your dad as a DJ and you, all your people, that obviously had some kind of impact in terms of your interest in music, would you say?\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah, it was definitely influence. Even my mother and my father, they were in doo-wop groups. My mother was part of The Crystals. She had a lot of big records, like âDa-Do-Run-Runâ and records like that. So I grew up hearing all the stories from my grandmother, all her concerts and the people that she dealt with in her business. My grandfather, all his tall stories with the old-school jazz cats and all that. He knew all of them. From my pops and my moms and all that. It was definitely a big influence in my life, just music, period, and entertainment.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nYou had been coming to Queensbridge from a very young age, kind of coming from where you come from in Long Island, and so you, like Nas as well, his dad is a well-known jazz musician, and he had access to a certain understanding of cultural things. So here you are, a cat who has his background and is enlightened to certain cultural possibilities in terms of everything from dance to music, blah blah blah. What was it like, the juxtaposition of being where you are in Long Island and coming to Queensbridge and being in this kind of intense war situation? How did your family feel about it? Did they feel a way that you were putting yourself in danger?\n\nProdigy\n\nMy mother worked for the housing authority. She used to help people get their apartments in the projects, ever since I was like a little baby. That was her position, and she actually worked in Queensbridge in the early â80s, and I used to go to day camp in Queensbridge during the summer when my mom was at work. I went to the Ruach Day Camp on the hill in Queensbridge, so later on in life, when I met Hav, and I was back out there again, I seen a lot of old friends that I used to hang with in day camp and all that. The part of Long Island where Iâm from is called Hempstead, andâ¦ [cheers] Yeah.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nGive it up for Hempstead.\n\n[applause]\n\nProdigy\n\nItâs got its little bad parts, its good parts, but itâs predominantly a good neighborhood. Itâs Long Island, but itâs got its rough parts out there thatâs serious. When I went out to Queensbridge, it was basically like a whole ânother level of that. Thatâs what it was really. It wasnât too much of a culture shock, but I definitely seen both sides of the track, grew up on both sides of the track.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nCool. So we have this album, The Infamous.\n\n[applause]\n\nI want to maybe play a little bit of some songs and get some of your memories, thoughts, stuff like that.\n\nHavoc\n\nLetâs do it.\n\nProdigy\n\nLetâs do it.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nAll right, all right.\n\n(music: Mobb Deep â âThe Infamous Preludeâ)\n\nAll right, you had some things on your mind that night in the studio.\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah, I had to get some steam off my chest, you know? Word. Thatâs just how we felt at that time.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nFirst of all, explain to the young folks here who donât have the same kind of club experience that us older gentleman might have had, tell us about what it was like in the clubs, like the Tunnel, the Muse, how you could get cut, stabbed, shot up, knuckled down, or one or four of those options. Tell us about the intensity of being in the club back in the days.\n\nProdigy\n\nOh, man. Yeah, New York, period, man. New York was a different place back then. You know, itâs still definitely wild right now, you can get killed in New York right now. But it was very different back then, because there wasnât a lot of cameras everywhere. It wasnât so much, the police wasnât on-it on-it, like how they on it right now with all this terrorist talk and all this stuff. Itâs crazy, man. It was crazy back then, you know? And clubs, you know, it was just wild, it was off the hook back then. The music was different, you know what I mean, the music was wilder, so it just amped the people up even more. So, just all around, period. The environment was definitely more intense and more dangerous in those days.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nBut you were on, your music was on. Youâre with your crew, you got your new whip, you got your cell phone, pager, whatever. Youâre hyped. Like, talk about that experience of feeling that, being in that moment, being in the club, people knowing who Mobb Deep is, people wanting to test Mobb Deep. All of that goes with the territory. Talk about that.\n\nProdigy\n\nI mean, to tell you the truth, the first one, two albums, we was taking the train to our shows. Like, we would all, thereâd be like 30, 40 of us, and we would all hop the train, you know, get on the train or whatever, go to the show. After the show, hop the train, go back to the projects, so... Thatâs how we were moving for a little while, thatâs just how we was moving. And we was just having a lot of fun. And a lot of it is just, you know, being high as hell, drunk as hell, youâre 18, 19 years old. You got a nice record playing on the radio, videos, youâre feeling yourself, you got all your people with you, itâs just a big celebration. And not to mention who we are, where we come from, the lifestyle that we living, we just bringing all that baggage along with us to the celebration.\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, but it wasnât too many people trying to test us, though. âCause when you see like 30 dudes coming up in the club, niggas just show their respect. It wasnât too many people, really. You never heard us really getting into too many altercations like that, because you know where we come from, they know it was real. So, real recognize real, you know what Iâm saying? So we ainât had many problems like that.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nBut the other thing that was really interesting about what you were saying was, you said, âIâm a little dude;â like, thereâs something very honest and real about you saying, âListen, Iâm not saying Iâm a tough guy. Iâm a little dude, but really, itâs about who gets who first.â I thought that was really honest.\n\nProdigy\n\nI mean, that was like the reality of the situation. We were very grounded, still are, reality-based. Our head is not in the clouds. We know exactly what can happen. We know exactly what the fu-- is going on. Thatâs what it is.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo why do you think so many rappers arenât realistic about what it is and where they come from? Why do you think thereâs such a disconnect?\n\nHavoc\n\nâCause a lot of peopleâs just in the game to make money. Theyâre not really real artists, you know what Iâm saying? And then they come with this fake persona, and trying to be, like, the rapper, and theyâre not really living it. But then, when they go somewhere and get smacked in they face by somebody, then they know that itâs really real âcause this ainât a game to really play with. Music should be fun, but this is street music, you know what Iâm saying, so we not going to fool ourself. So, if you rhyme about a certain thing, dudes is gonna test you. And a lot of dudes is coming out here, rhyming about, âYo! I sold drugs on this block,â and this, that and the third, and as soon as they get stepped to, they fold.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nLike an ironing board?\n\nHavoc\n\nAll day long, just put that nigga on the wall real quick.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nLike a subway map.\n\nHavoc\n\nAll day, fold him up, he out of here.\n\nProdigy\n\nLike a subway map. [laughs]\n\nHavoc\n\nWord. [laughs]\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSeriously, but the other thing was, people analyzed this manâs rant for years and years because he said, âPeople are on some,â quote-unquote, âcrazy space sh--. Theyâre high, we donât know what the hell theyâre talking about.â Some people caught feelings behind that. Now what Iâve read is you said, âIâm not even thinking about you like that. I was just expressing myself.â But it must have come from somewhere. You must have felt in the air, in the ether, that there was people rhyming about crazy space sh--, right?\n\nProdigy\n\nI mean, there really wasnât nothing like Mobb Deep at that time. We were like real unique the way we were bringing it, the lyrics, the lifestyle. Everything we were bringing to the table was unique, and I was just saying, making a separation and trying to explain that separation to people. âThis ainât that. Weâre something else. Weâre different, a whole other animal.â A few people took offense to it or whatever, but like I say, if the shoe fitsâ¦ I ainât saying nobody. Iâm not talking to nobody directly. I was speaking in general.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nYou said, âBack then there was nothing like Mobb Deep.â Do you feel like in the years since that there have been people who have kind of followed in your footsteps or you feel might be in a similar, not exactly like you guys but in a similar vein?\n\nProdigy\n\nDefinitely, thereâs been people that come. And you know, they were influenced by Mobb Deep.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nAny names?\n\nProdigy\n\nI mean, itâs obvious. Just look at the crews that came after us.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nLook at all the crews that came after them, and then you want them to figure out who it is.\n\nProdigy\n\nAnything thatâs similar to our style of music that came after us, we had to influence them.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\n[addressing audience] You guys have any suggestions of, because heâs humble, can you name some groups that have come in the wake of this wonderful group?\n\nAudience member\n\nThe Lox.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nThe Lox. Interesting.\n\nAudience member\n\nClipse.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nClipse! Interesting.\n\nAudience member\n\n50 Cent.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\n50 Cent, interesting. And you guys were signed to G-Unit at one point.\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah, we were there with 50, yeah.\n\nAudience member\n\nCNN.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nCNN, Capone-N-Noreaga. Yes. This is interesting. Are we reading his mind? He wonât let us know.\n\nProdigy\n\n[laughs]\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nHeâs smiling, though. Anyone else? CNN? Someone keeps sayingâ¦ All right, CNN. Interesting, CNN. Interesting.\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, very, very.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nVery interesting on many levels, some of which we donât necessarily need to get into here.\n\nHavoc\n\nRight, right, right.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nWhat do you remember about you guys were coming up, and then other groups like CNN and our dear friend Trag[edy Khadafi], that whole movement? What was it like with all that stuff coming up?\n\nHavoc\n\nI mean, it was flattering. They from the hood too, so you canât knock nobodyâs hustle. From day one, we wished them all the best. Itâs like, theyâre trying to do what weâre doing, and I always was hoping that it worked for them, and it did, in a way, with The War Report, a classic album. And theyâre Queens brothers; we was fu--ing with them at that time.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nThey was fu--ing with them at that time. Give it up for fu--ing with them at that time.\n\n[applause]\n\nThatâs definitely a classic album, and it fits into the era that you guys ushered in.\n\nProdigy\n\nRight, exactly.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nIâm glad I can ask Prodigy questions that the audience can answer for us. Thank you very much for that. Letâs keep going here. Letâs see where we can go.\n\n(music: Nas, Raekwon & Mobb Deep â âEye for a Eye (Your Beef Is Mines)â)\n\nHavoc\n\nEye for an eye.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo tell us a bit about the making of that song. A lot of legendary cats on there with you guys.\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, Nas and Raekwon.Yep.\n\n[applause]\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nThe hook is not about being friends. Can you give us the hook?\n\nProdigy\n\nIt was about taking somebodyâs eyeball if they take your eyeball.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nIn the biblical sense.\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo tell us about taking peopleâs eyeballs. No seriously, tell us about the song, how it came together, what you remember about it, being in the studio...\n\nHavoc\n\nWell, that was like, towards, like, the middle of the album. It was a lot of good energy going on at that time. We was label-mates with the Wu-Tang [Clan], and we clicked with Raekwon and them really good, like, we really gelled with them. And Nas is from around the way. To this day I canât even really remember how we got all of them into the studio, because itâs hard to get dudes in the studio all at one time.\n\nProdigy\n\nI remember.\n\nHavoc\n\nHow did we do that?\n\nProdigy\n\nSchott Free used to work at Loud [Records], with Matty C. They were the two A&Râs up there that signed, Schott signed, got Wu-Tang signed, and Matty signed us. Schott wanted us to meet Raekwon and them, so he took us to Staten Island one night, and we got drunk and high with Rae and Ghost[face Killa], and some other niggas out in the harbor.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nWere you smoking some dust? Thatâs big out there.\n\nProdigy\n\nI think they might have slipped some dust in one of our blunts or something like that, âcause I was feeling higher than I ever felt in my life.\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, when I got home I was walking in slow motion, like this [waves arms]. They put some sh-- in my sh--.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo you were on some crazy space sh--.\n\n[laughter]\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah I was on some space sh-- that night. Word.\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah, and that night I remember Raekwon, he drove us back to Queensbridge, âcause we had took the ferry out there. And on the ride back, he was like, âYo, whatâs up with that dude Nas, man? We trying to do a song with him. I want to put him on my solo album.â And I was like, âYo, we gonna hook that up.â So then the next day we hollered at Nas, and through that conversation we ended up just all doing the song together.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo you had to go do the song past 40th side to talk to Nas?\n\nProdigy\n\nI donât even know how we reached out to everybody, I think Hav reached out to him.\n\nHavoc\n\nYou know, I be fu--inâ with both sides anyway, you know what Iâm saying? But, you know, I was already hanging with Nas before all of this anyway, so I guess we must have made that happen, or whatever, but, it happened.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo, you have the line, Prodigy: âYou watch me while Jakeâs tryinâ to knock me and lock me.â Bringing it back to the dunn language, explain here to our friends in the audience, whoâs âJakeâ?\n\nProdigy\n\nYeah, âJakeâ is the police. Thatâs a slang term that come from Queensbridge for the police, from that TV show, Jake and the Fatman. It was a cop show, so we used to call the police âJakes.â You know what I mean, and... Yeah, âYou watch me while Jakeâs tryinâ to knock me and lock me.â That means the police trying to arrest you and lock you up. And Asti Spumante [a sparkling white wine], that sh-- just sounded good but it tastes disgusting.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo thereâs no dunn language slang for Asti Spumante?\n\nProdigy\n\nNah, itâs just some sh-- that sounded good right there.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nBut do you know how many people drank that sh-- because you said that? Thatâs foul, son. You got brothers drinking that nasty sh--.\n\nProdigy\n\nLet me know. I said it in a rhyme and I said, âLet me try that sh--â one day. That sh--âs disgusting. Word.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSpeaking of âJake,â talk about the relationship between the police and cats in Queensbridge. Itâs complicated.\n\nHavoc\n\nI mean, we all know the Ds, you know what Iâm saying, the Ds knew us. We used to know the Ds by they first names.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nâThe Ds,â as in, for those who donât understand, the detectives.\n\nProdigy\n\nOr the dicks.\n\nHavoc\n\nIt was like a cat and mouse game. Itâs like, theyâll see you, they say whatâs up, they be friendly, but in the meanwhile they looking at you like, âYou know Iâmma get you, you know Iâmma have to get you.â So, it was like that.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nLetâs look at some lyrics from Havoc from this song and pick his brain. Letâs see. âTry to infiltrate my fort, get caught dead up in New York. My brain is packed with criminal thoughts.â Where does that come from, my friend?\n\nHavoc\n\nI mean, itâs just like, your fort is like your crib or your block. A lot of times, a lot of stick-up kids used to try to run through and try to rob people and stuff like that. So itâs like, if you come through here, youâre going to get hit, because my brain is packed with criminal thoughts. Straight up.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nCan you relate to that, having a mind packed with criminal thoughts?\n\nHavoc\n\nEverybody got criminal thoughts. You be like, âI want to kill that nigga.â I mean, everybody goes through that.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nThis is true, but not many people have the ability to use music as a way to express those criminal thoughts, which is better than expressing it in real life.\n\nHavoc\n\nTrue indeed. Let your frustration out through the music.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nWhere do you think Mobb Deep would be, honestly, if Mobb Deep didnât have The Infamous, which was the thing that kind of liberated you after coming off of your first album, Juvenile Hell, that according to industry standards wasnât necessarily a hit, but it had an impact. It made people aware of you, but if you didnât have The Infamous, where would Prodigy and Havoc be right now, if that didnât come together?\n\nHavoc\n\nMe, myself, I probably wouldâve finished high school and just become an architect or something like that, because that was my major, until I really started fu--inâ with rap real hard, then I kind of fell off with the school thing and just really pursued a rap career. I definitely had a direction other than rap. I wasnât trying to fall victim to the streets like that.\n\n[applause]\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nThe other thing that I think is important, what people donât understand, itâs like the projects doesnât necessarily mean youâre a bad person, youâre a poor person, or youâre an uneducated person. The projects were created for affordable housing so people can actually save money and eventually, even though you said you never want to leave, you did exactly what the projects is supposed to do. Youâre supposed to save your money and get out. Obviously, there are plenty of people who are like you, who want to be architects and all kinds of other things, right?\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, but for some reason, some people just get caught up in that mentality, like in the poverty mind-state, and think that they canât have more for themselves, and then they just get stuck there. Iâm not trying to knock anybody or make fun of anybody or anything, but my whole objective was, I just found myself in the circumstance. My parents moved to Queensbridge, and obviously, this wasnât a place of permanent residency. It was a place to get your sh-- together and move on. That was the whole objective.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nAnd you, Prodigy, if it wasnât for The Infamous, how do you think you wouldâve turned out? What would you have gotten into?\n\nProdigy\n\nI really donât know, man. I really donât know. There was a time in my life when I was young, I wanted to be a dick. I wanted to be a detective, or FBI agent.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nReally? Iâve never heard this. OK. Tell us about this? Was it from watching Jake and the Fatman as a young man?\n\nProdigy\n\nNo, it was just something before I got into music, I always just had that idea in my head that I wanted to be likeâ¦ To me, they had power with that badge, and like just power of information. It was just intriguing to me when I was younger.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nObviously, there was a point when that changed. When did you realize maybe being po-po wasnât a good look?\n\nProdigy\n\nIt had never really crossed my mind being po-po ainât a good look, but just my interest just changed. My interest just changed to music. I decided to just get into something else, and the po-po thing was gone from my head.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nAny members of the police in the audience today?\n\nProdigy\n\nIf they are, they not going to say.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nOK, is that snitching?\n\nProdigy\n\nThey probably ainât here.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nThey donât want to snitch on themselves, OK. Iâm sure there are plenty of police officers who like Mobb Deep because itâs incredible music.\n\nProdigy\n\nItâs all good, man. We donât got problems with police, man. Just dirty cops. We got problem with dirty cops.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nRight. All right, weâre going to get into another banger.\n\n(music: Mobb Deep â âTemperatureâs Risingâ)\n\nGive it up for âTemperatureâs Rising.â\n\n[applause]\n\nYou know, one of my favorite songs on the album. It shows a level of sensitivity that I think is important in hip-hop, in terms of creating... What they, go back to what theyâve been saying about reality and being honest, you know, and I think that is one of the reasons this album has stood the test of time. As I read it, you guys are reaching out to a cat whoâs locked down.\n\nHavoc\n\nThat cat is actually my brother.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nOK, tell us about it.\n\nHavoc\n\nMy brother that passed away, rest in peace, god bless the dead. That was a real situation, a real story about my brother who was on the run for a homicide. We was like kind of protecting him, helping him run and not get caught by the police and stuff like that. We was just giving him advice on the record and stuff like that. While we made the record, and while the record was out, he was actually on the run for the homicide. He eventually got caught, but we beat the case, we won trial, and he was free behind it. And that was the story behind the song.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nBut itâs interesting, like the hip-hop police, the task force, werenât that sophisticated back then, but if they were, basically, that wouldâve implicated you in some way.\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, we was kind of under the radar at that time. I guess they wasnât like, âOh, letâs listen to this record and find out stuff.â And not to mention, we wasnât even saying where he was at anyway, so even if they wouldâve listened to it, it wasnât like we said he did it, or we was saying where he was at. We was like being mindful of that of what we was saying on the record.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nHow did he feel about it from what you remember?\n\nHavoc\n\nHe didnât get a chance to hear the record at the time while he was on the run, but he heard it eventually later on. He thought it was ill. He was like, âOh, thatâs whatâs up.â Word.\n\nProdigy\n\nIf you listen to the words, we very careful about what we saying on there. If you listen to the words carefully, you can see that the writing was real calculated on that song.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nBut I mean, whatâs running through your mind? Youâre in the middle of changing your situation, recording an album. Things are on the up-and-up, and then you got to write a song about your brother, whoâs on the run for murder, accused of murder? Whatâs running through your mind at that point?\n\nHavoc\n\nItâs like, âDamn! I got to spend all this money on a fu--inâ lawyer. I just made money, now I got to spend money on a lawyer?â Then, for the most part, heâs my little brother, so I donât want to see him go to jail for the rest of his life, so I want him to run as long as he can. Itâs just a fu--ed up situation. Nobody donât want to be in [that position]. Itâs your little brother, so it was real personal.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nWhere did he wind up going?\n\nHavoc\n\nHe was all over the place. We was right under the copsâ noses. We was like in The Bronx, and then later on he was in North Carolina, but they eventually caught him through phone conversations. It was like fu-- it, whatever. I had got arrested one day, and the cops was like asking me, âYo, whereâs your brother at?â I was like, âI donât know.â They was like, âWell, we know. We just caught him.â I was like, âWord?â They knew they had him all along, but they was just fu--inâ with me. Thatâs when everything just hit the fan.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nAny other recollections? What about recording the song itself? Do you remember where you recorded it?\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, Q-Tip helped us do that song right there. He actually came up with the sample, and the drum pattern and all of that. And he was in there just kinda guiding us through. âCause the sample was âTemperatureâs Rising,â that was the original sample, was âTemperatureâs Rising.â\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nBy who?\n\nHavoc\n\nThe one now is with Patrice Rushen, but the other one, the âTemperatureâs Risingâ that actually had the âTemperatureâs Risingâ sample in it, I canât remember at this time. But the original one said âTemperatureâs rising,â actually in the sample, and thatâs what made us reflect on what we was going through, because it just fit so well in what we was going through. And then, later on we did it over, and we sampled Patrice Rushen. I canât remember the song, but it was Patrice Rushen.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nAnd talk a bit more about Q-Tipâs influence, working with him at that point, overall on the record. I know he was instrumental early on in your careers. Tell us about Q-Tipâs involvement.\n\nProdigy\n\nQ-Tip, we use to cut out of school and we used to look on the back of the cassettes for the address of the record labels, after we made our demo out in Coney Island. You know, we used to cut out of school and take the train and go to the different labels. One of our main labels that we wanted was Def Jam, so we used to just stand outside the door at Def Jam and just wait for like the rappers to come out, or wait for somebody to come out the door, and just be like, âHey, excuse me. You listen to this song real quick, man, weâre a rap group.â So, a lot of people was like, âYeah, get the fu-- outta here,â or just act like they ainât hear us or whatever. Q-Tip actually came out the building and was the only one that stopped, and actually was like, âAlright, let me check it out.â And he put on the headphones and he listened to us, listened to our demo. He sat there and listened to a few songs, actually, and he was like, âYo, I like you dudes.â And heâs like, âCome on, Iâmma bring you into the office and introduce you to some people.â So, from that point, it was like three years later when we was working on The Infamous, maybe three, four years later. We just reached out back to him, like, âYo, man! We got this new sound that we created. Itâs real hot, we got these hot records, we about to drop this hot album. We want to bring you in as a producer, and help us out with the sound.â To make our sound that quality sh--, that quality level like he was doing for A Tribe Called Quest. We was always a fan of his and Tribeâs music. So, yeah, he came in and he blessed us, man, with a few tracks, and tweaked up some of the beats, and, you know, did the bass, drums and all that. Yeah.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nSo, when you guys went to wait outside of Def Jam, how long did you wait until someone was nice enough, like Q-Tip, to say, âOK, Iâll listen to your demoâ? Were you out there for days?\n\nProdigy\n\nIt probably took us like two or three days of going over there and just chilling until we finally caught a break.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nI mean, would you pack a lunch? Did you have headphones?\n\n[laughter]\n\nProdigy\n\n40 ouncers, man. 40 ouncers and butter crunch cookies. [laughter] And a dream.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nAnd just the two of you, not the whole Queensbridge [crew]?\n\nHavoc\n\nNah, just the two of us, thatâs it. Thirsty.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nWhat if you had brought all of Queensbridge? You think it wouldâve happened?\n\nHavoc\n\nNah, probably wouldnât have happened, because they probably wouldâve tried to bum rush the building or something.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nRight. All right. Letâs see what other jewels. Give it up for these men.\n\n(music: Mobb Deep â âTrife Lifeâ)\n\nGive it up for âTrife Life.â\n\n[applause]\n\nSo much going on on that track. First of all, you guys are in Marcy Projects. Interesting, interesting. Marcy Projects is where Jay-Z is from, and you probably werenât even aware of Jay-Z at that point?\n\nHavoc\n\nNot at all.\n\nProdigy\n\nNah, he wasnât around back then, as far as in the music industry.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nRight. Thatâs just like, is that a real story, some chick from Marcy calls you up?\n\nProdigy\n\nNo, actually, that story was just fictional. I made that up, but the whole concept of the song isnât fictional. That really happens to people. Girls will set you up. They tell you, âYo! Hey, come pick me up, over here, boom-boom.â They donât really know you, and itâs just a set-up. Theyâll set you up to rob you our whatever. People was doing that a lot.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nBut itâs interesting, the second verse is kind of like from the other side of it.\n\nHavoc\n\nRight, like a dude coming around the way and actually having something happen to him, and getting robbed for kind of taking where heâs at for granted and thinking that he could just come out here. A lot of times, a lot of chicks in the projects, they think they tough, so theyâll be like, âOh, donât worry about this sh--. Just come over here. These niggas is pussy.â She bringing you around a bunch of a fu--ing wolves. I donât never listen to a girl. When she be like, âOh, donât fu--ing worry about it. Just come over here. These guys ainât nothing.â It just be bullsh--, and then next thing you know, nigga getting robbed.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nLetâs just imagine the scenario. These two gentlemen are on a park bench on 12th Street. Their whole crew is famous. Theyâre sipping Hennessey, right? Some dude, some pretty-boy dude is walking through. Itâs Friday night and heâs got mad jewels on. Take us there, bring us to the mind state of whatâs happening. You donât know who this guy is, and heâs walking like sh-- is sweet. Explain what goes down.\n\nProdigy\n\nI mean, thereâs a story that really happened like that.\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah.\n\nProdigy\n\nOne night, we were on the block, and we were all just chilling. There was a whole lot of us. We was drinking, chilling, whatever, playing dice, and this girl, I think she was from 12th Street...\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, she from the block.\n\nProdigy\n\nShe came through the block with some dude, and we didnât know who this was. He was just some dude that she met, I guess she messed with from somewhere else, and they came through the block. One of our dudes was like, âDamn, shawty. Come here, come here.â Sheâs walking with this dude and that. So she comes over, talks to us, whatever, talks to them, and got the dude waiting over there for like 20 minutes. Heâs getting pissed off. Heâs like, âYo! Yo! Come here, what you doing?â He starts saying that. Now, weâre like, âWhat? Yo, dawg, shut up, dawg! Youâre not even from out here, dawg. Calm down!â Then it just got heated after that. It got kind of crazy.\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, crazy.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nThen you just wanted his chain, but you put a couple of slugs in his brain.\n\nHavoc\n\nNot that night. Not that night, but some sh-- went down. It was just crazy. He had pulled out, andâ¦\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nWait, wait, youâre talking about a real story?\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, it was a real story.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nWhen he says a line, âCome through truck, how you figure?â\n\nHavoc\n\nâHow you figure?â\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nI felt that. âAre you crazy for coming? Are you stupid?â Thatâs what I felt.\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, because if dudes come through with their jewelry all out like that, he got to have a gun on him or something. He must have it or heâs just stupid. I mean, we all know how the hood is, you donât got to explain it. I mean, itâs just stupid coming through somewhere without protection. And if youâre going to be wearing like thousands of dollars of jewelry on. Thatâs just like dangling meat in front of wolves. You canât do that.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nOne of the most compelling lines is when Prodigy says, âHypnotic thug life, get that ass paralyzed.â Where does that come from?\n\nProdigy\n\nThat was just like a freestyle. I just said it like off the top of my head, the end of the song. What I meant by that is, that lifestyle, the thug life lifestyle, the street lifestyle that weâre living... Itâs hypnotic. It pulls you in. Itâs fun, itâs dangerous, itâs mysterious. Itâll pull you in and hypnotize you, and you can get your ass killed or paralyzed, or locked up.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nLetâs talk about the track itself, do you know the sample?\n\nHavoc\n\nFor âSurvival [Of The Fittest]â?\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nYeah.\n\nHavoc\n\nNope. I donât even remember the sample. I used to just be grabbing a bunch of jazz records sometimes, and just listen to it and just fu--ing listen to it, like...\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nâTrife Lifeâ weâre talking about.\n\nHavoc\n\nOh, you talking about âTrife Life,â but that line, âHypnotic thug life, get your ass paralyzedâ is from âSurvival,â but thatâs why I was thinking that. Oh yeah, I know where we got the âTrife Lifeâ from. That was Norman Connors, âStarship,â something like that. It was like one of those famous records. People knew it from the â70s or the early â80s or something like that. I always liked the song. Itâs a real nice song, â[You Are My] Starship.â I just wanted to sample it, seeing how I could turn it into a hip-hop track.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nYou made it dark, and it fit. Again.\n\nHavoc\n\nYeah, I filtered the sample and turned it into a bassline, and just like kind of followed in Q-Tipâs footsteps with the drums, making the drums real tight and really clear and stuff like that.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nBut the song ends, and then it kind of fades out, and then it comes back again real strong. What was the feeling about that? Just when you thought it was over and youâre wrapped up in the emotion, it kind of sweeps you back in.\n\nHavoc\n\nWhen you have a good engineer, they kind of add they little thing into it, and the engineer that we had at the time, thatâs what he did. Engineers used to be part of the production, post-production, and kind of do little things, so thatâs what the engineer did, and brought it back.\n\nSacha Jenkins\n\nGive it up for these gentlemen."
