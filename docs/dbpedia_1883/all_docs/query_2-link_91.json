        "text": "Having pulled together what would become the Inexhale, a towering achievement from the rapper that includes guest spots from titans old and new (Ocean Wisdom, Skinnyman, Capo Lee, Jammz and more), lyrical gymnast Fliptrix is back with the understated visuals for lead single \"New Breath\". The High Focus signee has always been known for crafting classic-sounding bangers, but \"New Breath\" is one of his most thoughtful to date, using Chemo's smoky boom bap production to weave his densely-packed bars and intricate rhyme schemes, showing a whole new level of maturity and progression.\n\n\"The track touches on finding purpose in life,\" Fliptrix explained to us via email, \"escaping from social constructs, becoming free and finding truth within a sea of conflicting ideologies. Produced by the legendary Chemo, he brings a luscious melody driven track to the table perfect to interlace the rhythm with a variety of flows and forward thinking lyricism.\""
