        "text": "Rank & File Members spend hours on the road every day. How about using some of it to upgrade attitudes and behaviors? This is a 2-CD set, read by the author.\n\nSurvival of the Fittest is available as a 2-CD set (3.5 hours read by the author) to be used by rank and file workers on drive and commute time. Also some workers are better audio learners than readers so the CD set is a better option. Broken into 18 separate tracks, it is an excellent and functional tool for contractors, training centers, local unions and labor management groups to distribute to rank and file foremen, journeymen and apprentices.\n\nTrack List\n\nTrack 1: Introduction: Survival of the Fittest\n\nTrack 2: Chapter 1 – The Truth Hurts\n\nTrack 3: Chapter 2 – Survival of the Fittest and WIIFY (What’s In It For You?)\n\nTrack 4: Chapter 3 – Elite Warriors and Winners\n\nTrack 5: Chapter 4 – Tradition and Reputation\n\nTrack 6: Chapter 5 – The “Union Yes” Promise: Quality, Excellence, and Value\n\nTrack 7: Chapter 6 – Personal Responsibility\n\nTrack 8: Chapter 7 – Work Ethic, Commitment, and Attitude\n\nTrack 9: Chapter 8 – Tolerance, Diversity and Attitude Adjustments\n\nTrack 10: Chapter 9 – Who Let the Dogs Out?\n\nTrack 11: Chapter 10 – For Apprentices Only\n\nTrack 12: Chapter 11 – Security, Stability, and the Money Game\n\nTrack 13: Chapter 12 – For Foremen Only\n\nTrack 14: Chapter 13 – Getting Involved On and Off the Job\n\nTrack 15: Chapter 14 – Old Enemies, New Partners\n\nTrack 16: Chapter 15 – Life Success: You Are Worth it\n\nTrack 17: Chapter 16 – Final Exam: Your Choices\n\nTrack 18: About the Author\n\n(18 Total Tracks)"
