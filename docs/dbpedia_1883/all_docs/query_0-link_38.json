        "text": "Toss out the first song, and this night along the Ohio River is pretty typical for 1994. A smattering of Hoist tunes, strong, though not exceptional, versions of Maze, You Enjoy Myself, and Harry Hood, a vacuum solo on a Neil Diamond song, and a joyful classic rock cover to send the fans home happy. It’s the very first seven minutes of the show that set it apart, featuring the highly unlikely revival of a ghost from the band’s deep past: the longest, never played track from their 1986 demo, known as The White Tape.\n\nThe White Tape gets about 1% of the early-Phish attention of the similarly primordial The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday, even with (perhaps because of?) its official release in 1998 and improbable availability on streaming services. The demo’s lower profile makes sense, as despite the presence of staples such as AC/DC Bag, Slave to the Traffic Light, and Run Like an Antelope, The White Tape presents an alternate-universe version of what Phish might have become. With its roughly-sketched ideas, inside jokes, and tape-machine experiments, its sound is closer to the unsettling joke-rock Ween would base their career on, the fragmented curios of Zappa protege Captain Beefheart, or the pocket-sized prog of early Soft Machine.\n\nThe chemical misnomer NO2 sits in the middle of this juvenilia, one of four Mike compositions and the one that most intensely reflects Mike’s peculiar sensibilities (OK, maybe it’s tied with Minkin in that regard). The first four minutes are an extremely unpleasant recreation of a dental procedure, with a toybox of busy signals, piercing drones, and synthesizer oscillations backing up Mike’s detached, in-and-out-of-focus narration. Following the instructions, “here’s a tape, if you want to put on the headphones,” a calm piece for two acoustic guitars drifts in and blankets the remaining synth squiggles for a few minutes, before another blast of electronic noise nudges the song into the next track, an early sketch of Fluff’s Travels.\n\nIt’s more experiment than song, and seemed destined for historical footnote status. But perversely, the band dusted off NO2 to use as the b-side on the Down with Disease cassingle (surely freaking out a few uninitiated Sam Goody customers), and here in Cleveland, in the middle of the tour ostensibly promoting the band’s most mainstream effort, the track made its improbable live debut.\n\nOne might expect the first NO2 to pop up in the middle of one of the increasingly dissonant jams inside of Stash, Bowie, or Antelope, but no — it’s a pre-emptive strike, a blast of Phishy weirdness before the crowd even has a chance to settle into their space. For starters, they hit the stage with the guitarist on drums, barreling into a fragment of demonic piano trio jazz, before dropping out for an unaccompanied vacuum solo a mere 90 seconds into the show.\n\nLive, the vacuum logically takes up the central role of the dentist’s drill, while the rest of the band uses their toys at hand to recreate the rest of the song’s cacophony. Trey does his megaphone-swinging Doppler effect trick, there’s occasional feedback of indeterminate origin, Mike lets out a bowel-y rumble at 4:00 (or is that Fish too?), Page…plays piano, but…weirdly. Everything unifies for a glorious flatulent crescendo at 4:30, capped with a BBC Radiophonic Workshop “pong” that doesn’t sound like it comes from any instrument they used in 1994. At 5:15, Mike starts his dental narration, and after the headphones line (delivered by Trey?), they make an attempt at a bucolic coda, which is quickly, mercifully steered into the more comfortable territory of Rift.\n\nWhat band does this? At a time when they hadn’t yet attained a crowd that was pretty much game for anything, in a city that’s not particularly known as a Phish stronghold, this is a stupid-risky way to open a show. But tapping back into the madness of The White Tape is a logical next step after a run of crazy shows in the Midwest where other bits of early nonsense such as Kung, Icculus, and Catapult had made their return. As the (relatively) straight-laced approach to the Spring starts to loosen and the band seems eager to explore more experimental directions, it only makes sense that they would turn back to their earliest four-track goofs for inspiration.\n\nA theory: From 1993 on, when things really began to open up, there are two devils sitting on Phish’s shoulders —The White Tape and The Siket Disc. Yeah yeah, The Siket Disc wouldn’t come out until 1999, but as far as official release goes, they aren’t so far apart, given that The White Tape only became available on Dry Goods in 1998 (they were only announced a few Schvices apart, if I recall correctly), and you can consider its content the culmination of Phish’s mid-to-late 90's experiments.\n\nAnyway, these self-released albums are symbols, see, of the two forces of self-indulgence tempting Phish away from a straightforward rock show in different — though not always incompatible — directions. The White Tape is a force of chaos drawing them towards avant-garde interludes, seguefests, intentionally provocative, antagonistic moves. The Siket Disc is the idealized version of pure, spontaneous, formless composition, that place where they don’t even need to try to play songs any more, they just play music — or let the music play them, as they tend to frame it.\n\nAugust 93 was White Tape ascendant, with a growing acceptance of silliness shattering the standard setlist rules. As I’ve said before, June 1994 picked up where that manic month left off, reintroducing the prankster spirit that had been somewhat suppressed over the spring. Meanwhile, the first Siket-y sparks are starting to appear, in the 6/18 Bowie, the 6/23 Tweezer, the 6/24 Antelope. That prophetic, anomalous night back on May 7th in Dallas? A show where both devils conspired to work in tandem, producing the mayhem of repeated Tweezers and left-field covers alongside moments of boundary-free improv such as the divine jam between HYHU and Tweezer Reprise.\n\nThe tug of war between these experimental influences and the desire to just be a good old-fashioned rock band would drive the rest of the band’s live output from here on out. Through all of the band’s stylistic phases, these two spirits hover, an ever-present threat to push a show out of the comfort zone and create something special and unique. You can even see it in the most recent summer tour, with the Siket devil winning out on 7/13, the White devil (hyuck) triumphing on 7/27.\n\nAgain, these two forces are not totally diametric, but they conflict and complement each other to create Phish’s special blend of levity and wanderlust. Imagine how dire Phish’s whole thing would be if it wasn’t laced with a prankster’s sense of humor. Imagine how tiresome it would become if they spent every night winking at us with setlist capers and shenanigans. There are plenty of jambands who do one of the above. There’s only one that does both."
