        "text": "Phish’s long career started with an interruption — the possibly apocryphal story of ROTC Halloween Dance attendees preemptively ending their first show ever by drowning them out with Michael Jackson’s Thriller. Throughout their first 30 years, the band repeatedly demonstrated the ability to keep their cool when things go pear-shaped, from floods (3/28/92) to storms (7/14/00, 7/19/13 & 7/21/13) to aerial trick screw-ups (8/16/96). Some of these acts of nature caused long delays, some were enough to bring the show to a halt. But in nearly every case, Phish at least attempted to make it up to disenfranchised fans, playing an extra set the next night, completing an aborted song the next year, or giving a show a little extra throttle — or at least an amusing narration-song — the next time through town.\n\nOccasionally, the crowd doesn’t have to wait so long to cash in their rain checks. On this night in Cincinnati, the ornate Music Hall clashed with the rambunctious Phish fan community and hit the panic button, sounding a fire alarm that cut the first set short after only five songs. It’s actually a miracle this didn’t happen more often in the Theater Era, when venues used to more urbane audiences were confronted with people who consider no smoking rules and seat assignments optional suggestions. A frenzied evacuation and re-entry later — which likely made conditions even less safe given the number of ticketless who suddenly gained entry to a sold-out show—the band faced a choice: stick to the script, or adapt to the circumstances.\n\nIn an analogous but opposite move to the previous show, they decided to lasso the night’s chaos and take it for a ride. Fire is the obvious choice to resume the show, though it speaks well of their catalog that they seem to always have the right song to slyly respond to adversity. Poor Heart keeps the tempo up, and then Down With Disease gives the audience the passive-aggressive scolding they probably deserved. Any pre-written setlist of this era would probably find a soft landing in a ballad at this point, or kneecap the urgency with something long and proggy. But you know they’re off-script when they double down on the darkness with a run of MFMF, Melt, Esther, Chalkdust, and BBFCFM that is intentionally and relentlessly merciless.\n\nWhat emerges is a feature very important to Phish’s development: set flow. The idea that a set is more than just a collection of songs, but can contain an overarching “narrative” is one of the major things that separates Phish from the rest, even within the field of improvisational rock bands. By the end of the 90s, they will have sharpened this approach and made it a semi-regular occurrence. But in the eager-to-please early-90s, set construction was more a demonstration of the band’s versatility instead of a cohesive statement.\n\nAbandoning that strategy take a lot of confidence. If withholding certain fan favorite songs every night for the sake of a changing setlist is tough, withholding entire dimensions of the band in favor of deeply exploring one mood or letting the narrative drive the song selection is even more of a high-wire act. To borrow Wally Holland’s concept of Phish becoming a genre unto themselves, set flow relies upon the faith that whatever they play is “Phish music” that will satisfy (most of) the audience, instead of wildly careening between genres to try and please everyone.\n\nIn Cincinnati, instead of jumping between genres and moods with every song, they find one emotional vein of dread, paranoia, and anger and mine it for nearly an hour. With each song, it gets richer and deeper, eventually transforming the material — MFMF gets a cock-rock snarl of a coda, an insistent Mike drives Melt into a unique jam theme that alternates minor and minorer keys, Chalk Dust invokes the almighty “Barracuda” riff, and BBFCFM ends the block by literally threatening to kill the audience.\n\nEven if they can’t sustain the mood for the entirety of the extended second set, winding things down with an acoustic break, some straightforward rockers, and a typically gorgeous ‘94 Hood, that’s okay — baby steps. It’s more important that they nimbly responded to the fire alarm, coming back from the interruption with a segment of music both thematically appropriate and adventurous. A mid-show evacuation may be a steep price, but any nudge out of their safety zone increasingly paid dividends but at this point in Phish’s career…before they started living outside of their safety zone entirely."
