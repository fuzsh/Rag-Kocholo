        "text": "2 Whom It May Concern is a non-album track which first appeared on the UK version of the My Name Is Prince single, before appearing on the US single of Damn U, while soon after appearing on the maxi-single of 7. The track is largely a spoken-word track which at times samples most tracks from the album (mostly) in order: My Name Is Prince, Sexy M.F., Love 2 The 9’s, The Max, Blue Light, Wanna Melt With U, The Continental, Damn U, Arrogance, And God Created Woman, 7, 3 Chains O’ Gold and The Sacrifice Of Victor, while also introducing each member of the New Power Generation, serving as a commercial for the album (the promo video is in fact labeled \"Commercial\" on promo VHS copies). The backing track is sampled directly from 7 (After 6 Long Mix); it also contains a sample of God Made Me Funky performed by The Headhunters, written by B. Maupin, B. Summers, P. Jackson, M. Clark and B. McKnight (from their 1975 album Survival Of The Fittest, also sampled in The Sacrifice Of Victor).\n\nWhile exact recording dates are unknown, the track was recorded in Summer 1992 following the recording of the album’s last-recorded song Wanna Melt With U, most likely at Paisley Park Studios in Chanhassen, Minnesota. See individual song titles for the recording information about the samples used in this track."
