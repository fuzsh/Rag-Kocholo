        "meta_description": "Survival of the Fittest by Baba Brinkman, released 01 August 2009\n\nWe livin’ this ‘til the day that we die\r\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\r\n\r\nThere’s a war goin’ on outside no man is safe from\r\nYou can run but you can’t hide forever\r\nIf you come to my block, you’ll see some territoriality\r\nA place where kill or be killed is the mentality\r\nBut get it straight, it’s just a necessary strategy\r\nYou gotta play the hand you’re dealt; you can’t magically\r\nEscape from the habitat that you was born in\r\nThree homicides in my neighbourhood this mornin’\r\nCops came and kicked the crooked door in, with no warnin’\r\nAnd started roughin’ up my young cousin\r\nShe’s only seventeen and got a bun in the oven\r\nPlus a concussion, but she ain’t done nothin’\r\nSo keep your mouth shut and don’t jump to judgment\r\nOn the lives we’re livin’ – just close your eyes and listen\r\nWhile I break down some homicide statistics\r\nIf you’re thinkin’ the criminal mind is just vacant\r\nYou’re mistaken, this is calculated risk takin’\r\nWe’re livin’ in a situation with a low \r\nLife-expectancy, and a major discrepancy\r\nBetween the haves and have-nots, and you wonder\r\nWhy the padlock on every cash box is smashed off\r\nC’mon, you can’t call it “pathological”\r\nNaw, that’s illogical; you can try to understand it\r\nBut you can’t stop it though, not unless you address\r\nThe root causes, the conscious and unconscious \r\nDecisions to discount future prospects\r\nC’mon, it’s obvious – the beat keeps bouncing\r\nThe homicide rate keeps mounting, which leads\r\nTo steep discounting, and a lot of violence\r\nBut it’s not a virus; it’s a rational response\r\nTo high risk environments and short time horizons\r\nWith high stakes and highly visible prizes\r\nAnd you wonder why we’re criminal-minded\r\nHey, you can’t say we’ll get satisfaction if we’re patient\r\nWith self-control and delayed gratification\r\nWhen the only job that pays is casket-makin’\r\nAnd death is the ultimate plan cancellation\r\nSo check the facts and recent data releasin’\r\nYou’ll see a pattern of increasin’ competition\r\nA bunch of young guys all stugglin’ and status seekin’\r\nAnd causin’ the crimes that make the social fabric weaken\r\nAnd life expectancy also predicts teen pregnancy\r\nThe need to leave a legacy genetically\r\nWill never be completely controlled contraceptively\r\nYeah, that’s transparent – imagine if your kids \r\nWould never meet their grandparents, unless you followed\r\nThe Bristol Palen plan for parenthood\r\nAnd then they say, “Ooh, these young girls are so damn careless\r\nGetting’ pregnant before marriage; it’s such a tragedy” \r\nApparently it’s also a reproductive strategy, \r\nEspecially when you can see them adjusting actively\r\nWhen their circumstances change; in both the cases\r\nOf the young ladies with babies and the male risk-takers\r\nYou see people adapting to their situations\r\nAnd it’s the same in different places and with different races\r\nThis is not about ethical justifications\r\nIt’s evolutionary psych, and it’s just the basics\r\nAnd still people call this behaviour “maladaptive” \r\nBecause of our reaction when violence happens\r\nBut if we really want to change the outcome\r\nThen maybe we should just start questioning how it’s adaptive\r\nAnd the bottom line is that inequity and life\r\nExpectancy are the ultimate causes of crime\r\nAnd the results of crime; to me that’s true\r\nThe two combine together in a feedback loop\r\nBut I got some moves to make, so I’ll be back soon \r\nJust don’t ask me what I’m about to do\r\n‘Cause I can’t say, so it’s left to untold fact\r\nUntil my death, my ghost will stay alive\r\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\r\n\r\nWe livin’ this ‘til the day that we die\r\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive",
