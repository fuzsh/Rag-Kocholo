        "text": "On this day, April 25, in hip-hop history...\n\n1995: Mobb Deep released its seminal sophomore album The Infamous. Prior to the album's release, the duo was signed to 4th & B'way Records, through which they released their debut album Juvenile Hell. Despite contributions from the likes of DJ Premier and Large Professor, the album proved to be a critical and commercial failure, causing 4th & B'way to drop the QB duo.\n\nHowever, after striking gold with the Wu-Tang Clan, Loud Records decided to sign the M-O-B-B in late 1993. Prodigy and Havoc began recording their next project in 1994, this time opting to self-produce the majority of the LP.\n\nWith its sinister, Havoc-produced soundscape and Prodigy's piercing brand of gritty street lyricism—qualities best embodied by singles like \"Shook Ones, Pt. 2\" and \"Survival of the Fittest\"—The Infamous quickly became a commercial and critical success, peaking at #15 on the Billboard 200 chart and eventually earning Gold certification from the RIAA.\n\nTo celebrate the 21st anniversary of The Infamous in 2016, The Infamous was reissued in a blue and yellow colored vinyl in honor of National Record Store Day. The vinyl's limited release was restricted to 2,000 copies on Amazon or Discogs. All City Music also teamed up with the Beat Junkies’ J-Rocc for a special mix of songs and samples that make up the LP."
