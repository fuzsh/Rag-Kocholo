        "text": "Post by gee on\n\n'Wings' - heavily influenced by Neil Young's Buffalo Springfield song; 'Expecting To Fly' - was written mostly by Allan Clarke with input from Graham Nash but at a time when all was not well in the band in 1968\n\nAs Tony Hicks says in that LTAW DVD they had a number of business problems at that time - notably re management - which disrupted recording new material (they were very inactive in the recording studios, by their standards, overall during 1968) , also they had issues re their relationship with EMI plus Graham Nash was having his issues with producer Ron Richards (as Clarke would have later ) over material\n\nthey were not in a great place re the songwriting and despite some notable exceptions - 'Do The Best You Can', 'Open Up Your Eyes' etc the main team of Clarke, Hicks, Nash was fragmenting\n\nNash alone wrote 'Marrakesh Express' and Nash-Terry Reid wrote 'Man With No Expression' while Nash also wrote 'Annabella' (and a few others) for John Walker with Kirk Duncan and Nicky James, so Graham's musical head was beginning to move away and as Nash put it 'we were not on the same page'\n\nBobby has said he 'forced' the trio to pen 'Survival of The Fittest' !\n\nClarke-Nash...and wives penned 'Jennifer Eccles' and only Allan and Graham wrote 'Wings' and they did the promo film for it (suggesting it might have been envisaged as an overseas single ?) but sadly there was no new 1968 studio album planned - initial recording sessions had produced 'Tomorrow When it Comes' by Clarke-Nash and Nash's short 'Relax' but then got no further, and as 'Hollies Greatest' was a massive UK chart topping success for them in summer 1968 they effectively had done their big album for 1968...\n\nthey seemed to lose direction somewhat thereafter, notably using studio time for other things than any new album - finally completing the 1966 song 'Like Everytime Before' for overseas release and also re-cutting 'A Taste of Honey' with orchestra as with the Dylan song 'Blowin' in The Wind' which Nash loathed !\n\nin fact that Lewisham Odeon concert was being considered by EMI as a live album too - dropped when Graham announced his departure\n\nTowards the end of 1968 Tony Hicks even suggested doing an album of Bob Dylan songs (to Nash's horror) which proved all was not well re the group's 'in house' songwriting ...\n\nso 'Wings' in 1968 had no room to stretch out and manouvre as it were....like 'Man With No Expression' with both deemed maybe not commercial enough to work as singles given their reversion to a safe 'pop group' image compared to 'Jennifer Eccles' or 'Listen To Me' (and indeed 'Sorry Suzanne' next)\n\nso I'd guess events overtook 'Wings' (as they would re 'Out on The Road' album in 1973) ...and handing it to the WWF for the charity album (just as The Beatles did with the original 'Across The Universe') was deemed a good way to at least get the fine song out, and make a strong contribution to the very worthwhile cause\n\nwe do know producer Ron Richards DID rate 'Wings' however...and with more romantic slightly amended lyrics Ron had them re-cut it with Terry Sylvester in March 1970 for consideration as a possible single...tho' maybe the current singles then were deemed to be in a more modern style (?) hence it remained in the can...\n\n'Hard To Forget' - which Allan Clarke DID manage to forget the title of (?) in the TV show....was to be frank rather 'EASY To Forget' !!\n\nit's at best a bit run of the mill, very 80's and rather \"too keyboardy\" for my own tastes but whatever, it kind of breaks in mid flow to a slower section if I remember correctly and (to me) never quite picks up the flow again ...certainly it's just not er memorable (lol)\n\nthat said it only exists as a bootleg of dubious sound quality so a proper release with a decent mix would at least give it a fair chance to try to live up to it's title and establish itself in our memories properly...\n\nit WAS being slated as the forthcoming new Hollies single when they did that TV show and it's subsequent non appearance became something of a latter day Clarke era Hollies mystery...\n\nA rumour going around at the time had it EMI were allegedly unhappy (??) with someone involved in the recording, either writing the song or in the production, thus The Hollies apparently agreed to quietly shelve the thing without further comment in order to keep EMI happy - but that's only a rumour that went around at the time I stress\n\nnevertheless it should come out - hopefully it might one day, maybe on a 1985-1993 latter Clarke era CD compilation that would completely fill an important gap in The Hollies recording history.\n\nPost by cameron on\n\nDon't forget that the Hollies recorded an early version of 'Wings' for the BBC Radio show 'Symonds On Sunday' on 25th March, 1968 with alternative lyrics, which is odd, because the studio version was recorded over two months before the radio version with alternative lyrics.\n\nBobby Elliott was quoted on another BBC show in April/May 1968 as saying that they were \"trying to finish the new album\" having allegedly completed a week in the recording studio. Is it true that the Hollies rehearsed elsewhere and then went into Abbey Road? Maybe that's what he meant. I've heard them talk of rehearsing outside of Abbey Road many times, presumably to cut down on expensive studio time, as \"Hollies LTD\" now had to fund their own recording time. Either way, they didn't spend a week at Abbey Road in 1968 until August.\n\nBut they must have feared no new album would come, as they recorded the Lewisham Odeon concert in on 24th May 1968 as a \"cop out\" for no new studio LP. Apparently the Hollies were appalled by what they heard when they got back to Abbey Road, but they never got to find out until the final mix was done. By which time, they all elected to pull the plug on the release as, in their own words, their own performance was \"substandard\" and \"flat\". If that's them at their worst, I can't even imagine how good they must sound at their best! Other than a slightly laboured take of \"Look Through Any Window\", the whole released performance is absolutely superb. The only thing that lets it down is the orchestral backing which is poor, presumably because they couldn't hear the Hollies very well on the night. Though it's incredible to have such a long official release of Nash era live material. There really ought to be more!\n\nThe final straw must have come in June/July 1968, as \"Hollies Greatest\" was issued by EMI in August. I don't think there was a specific reason that the Hollies didn't finish a new album in 1968, more a series of events that conspired against them. One thing is for sure though, their songwriting certainly hadn't dried up. Nash took a dozen or so songs with him to America, namely \"Marrakesh Express\", \"Lady Of The Island\", \"Sleep Song\" and \"Man With No Expression\" (which CSN also recorded as \"Horses Through A Rainstorm\", but also didn't release until the 1990s). I also heard that Allan Clarke wrote \"My Life Is Over With You\" before Nash left the Hollies, as it was covered by a chap called Gordon Waller (I *think*) in late 1968, almost a year before the Hollies recorded it.\n\nPost by gee on\n\nAllan Clarke was quoted in the UK music press in 1968 as saying;\n\n'all of Graham's new songs are very slow and very boring...'\n\ntho' they did well enough for CSN in the USA just after, plus on his solo albums\n\nClarke's blunt dismissal of Nash's 'new songs' then indicates the level of resistance in the band Nash was facing at that time, chiefly it seems from his oldest friend not Hicks or Elliott\n\nwe know that Clarke - a 'beer and skittles man' as he put it (!) - also disliked 'Marrakesh Express' (which Bobby says he loves) and the fact they began recording it shows Hicks was not against them doing it at all ...but with both Allan and Ron Richards 'cool' towards newer much more personalised songs (ironic considering Clarke was also writing material like that too - 'Lullaby To Tim', 'Would You Believe' etc) the breakup of their 'in house' songwriting team and the lack of a new studio album in 1968 seems more understandable\n\nNash says in LTAW words to the effect that while they still existed as a performing group - and did TV shows besides concerts - they had effectively dissolved as a creative band....which is maybe a bit harsh but probably not too far off the mark - the 'Dylan' idea, plus 'Country' just after suggests a group looking for some sense of direction...it's hard to imagine any other of their contemporary top bands doing 'Tribute' sets in 1969\n\nClarke wrote three songs about his feelings re Nash - 'My Life is Over With You', 'Goodbye Tomorrow', and 'Separated' all cut over 1969-70 so he and the group were happy to follow Nash's lead then re doing very personal songs - hence Nash's remark re 'Sing Hollies' that; 'if we'd been recording material like that I'd never have left...!'\n\nSo for each side I think Nash's departure probably was for the best overall and that aspect plus all their business 'issues' and their relationship with EMI that were going on around 1968 really scuppered any new original studio album in that year"
