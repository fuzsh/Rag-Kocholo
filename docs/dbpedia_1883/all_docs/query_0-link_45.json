        "meta_description": "From Pirate to Pivot: the early recordings of Jon Sonnenberg by Pivot Clowj, released 11 April 2016\n\n1. Drowning in the X-Pool\n2. Metamorphosis 1\n3. Moonlight (original version)\n4. So Gullible (original version)\n5. Freedom is the edging to the Garden on the RIght\n6. Alligator Bait\n7. Should I Worry\n8. Blackout (original version)\n9. Doubting (piano version)\n10. Farewell Note\n11. Never Again\n12. Ten Minutes &#39;til Anger\n13. A Harmless Drug\n14. Somewhat Charming\n15. Your Majesty (original version)\n16. Drowning in the X-Pool (1996 remix)\n\nThis is a collection of early songs recorded by Jon Sonnenberg, most of them recorded between 1990 and 1994. Some of these songs appeared on the cassettes &#39;Identity Crisis&#39; or &#39;The Garden of Hill&#39;, which were both released under the moniker &quot;Pirate Claug&quot;. Jon changed the band name to Pivot Clowj in 1994 when Robert Gutschow joined the ranks.\r\n\r\nSome of these songs were taken directly from the original cassette masters. This is because the original multi-track reel to reels tapes from the recording sessions prior to 1994 were on low quality tape and have since deteriorated - some beyond use. After 1994, better quality tape where many of the master recordings are still owned and maintained by Jon Sonnenberg. Many of the tapes that can be played have been transferred to Pro Tools. Stay tuned for other early recordings and live Pivot Clowj albums soon to be released!",

        "text": "1.\n\nDrowning in the X-Pool 02:33\n\nWhat you said was a shock not what I expect or what I wanted to hear just want you near beside me... beside me won't forget your laughter won't forget your dreams maybe someday we will come true we'll come true emersion in the X-pool may convince you if you let it otherwise I can never help you even if I want to more than anything\n\n2.\n\nMetamorphosis 1 04:00\n\nShocked as I look at what you've become and remember what you were you let them tell you who you were you let them shape your life you let them shape your life... your life maybe it's for the better it's what you were destine for the long white fangs that once protruded replaced by a friendly smile... friendly smile I know it is for the better I know it is for the better I know it is for the better maybe I'll you in Heaven I know it is for the better maybe I'll see you next door Maybe I'll see you next door Maybe I'll live next door Maybe... maybe... maybe.. maybe.\n\n3.\n\nMoonlight (original version) 02:18\n\nWinter moons were all alone she'd hang up in the sky wishing she were dry longing to fry she raised her arm to cast a stone and shattered into a million stars and shattered into a million stars and as I look into a moonless sky I find myself waiting for her return\n\n4.\n\nSo Gullible (original version) 04:10\n\nMy scattered brain left insane and hurting my shattered heart unfulfilled and bleeding you told me it would never be this way and I believed you my silence and my screams seem to never leave as snakes and lizards crawl upon my tongue the shadows of my past flood my eyes unwillingly, faithfully I wait in pain I hide inside the thickened walls around me keeping in my secrets and my fears holding back the tears afraid of being alone wishing to regain control you told me it would never be this way and I believed you my silence and my screams seem to never leave as snakes and lizards crawl upon my tongue the shadows of my past flood my eyes unwillingly, faithfully I wait in pain what happened to the children and the innocence who took away my dreams you told me it would never be this way it shouldn't have to be this way you told me that it wasn't going to be this way and I believed you.\n\n5.\n\nshe sits beneath my bed in the night of my dreams but wakes me up instead even though I just scream she hides beneath my bed in the night of my dreams she grows inside my head even though I just scream and this could be the answer to our lives oh and this could be the ending of our hope ah and this could be the starting of our dreams ah and fear is what she found when she was free oh and freedom is just the edging to the garden on the right. ahhhhhh...\n\n6.\n\nAlligator Bait 04:02\n\nsmall red rats and alley cats clench fists and collide in a never ending shish kabob - a bloody mess communities anger and tamper with the bats (they have wings, you know) - \"angels - they are\" small red rat bats and alley cat bats shed blood and tears Lulu the baboon is slain for getting in the way of this gruesome play animal lovers complain on this dreadful day just send them all away away.. away... away....\n\n7.\n\nShould I Worry 02:12\n\nyou walk around the block and whisper at my door you hide, unsure, surrounded crying like a child harmed, abused, and tattered staggering to regain control if you need to cry on a shoulder or tight arms around you I will be here for you.\n\n8.\n\nBlackout (original version) 05:52\n\nThe sudden shock of the light caused blindness painted in orange Screaming with the streaming tears, she cried screaming in the darkness from orange, brown, black your sight is lost forever - blindness, blindness in the blackout invisible sirens burst your ears - it hurts the pain is deep you suffer waiting in the blackout ... from the blackout ... from the blackout She'll be with you be with you be with you be with you until the end. Until the end. Until the end. Until the end. The End.\n\n9.\n\nDoubting (piano version) 03:35\n\nYour head is shaking I want to cheer you I want to take your doubts away maybe I'll just have to wait.. to wait It makes me sad to hear you cry it shakes me up when tears fall I seek answers, I seek answers, I seek answers questions are obvious... who's to blame? (meaningless syllable nonsense) - sawa sava sava ama leyee\n\n10.\n\nFarewell Note 04:13\n\nLooking through the window pane you seem to want to leave again I hold you back - I tell you truth do you believe in lies? I told you once, I told you twice - \"the world is never truly nice\" they always want they always take, but you aren't like that, are you? Looking through the window pane, all I feel is pain you went away and never knew peoples' dreams do not come true but you will find out when they hack your hair and you find yourself failing to push pillars.\n\n11.\n\nNever Again 03:39\n\nN/A\n\n12.\n\nTen Minutes 'til Anger 03:26\n\nTen minutes 'til anger ten minutes 'til anger the prank was full of spoiled rotten bliss as glass crashed shattering into bits but Sheila is alright - sight is lost in a big blur she picks up her spectacles with a heart full of rage. Ten minutes 'til anger her tongue catches fire as she spits broken words cooling soothing tears comforts her then disappears she spits broken words ten minutes 'til anger\n\n13.\n\nA Harmless Drug 03:57\n\nSteven felt a little hand pulling him aside he felt tugged, drawn, attracted his friends said he is ill, but it's really just a side effect of the moment seems withdrawn, looks quite sad he must feel a bit like you and me no escape (like you'd want to) no harm (like you'd care) perfectly safe is the music we hear your mind drawn apart with ideas emotions illusions of the art the sound fills your body with a tremble in your bones feel the pulse, hear the music like a drug you want more no escape (like you'd want to) no harm (like you'd care) perfectly safe is the music we hear. no escape (like you'd want to) no harm (like you'd care) As for Steven... well forget it there is no hope - just the music wanting more is not enough you want more no escape (like you'd want to) no - no harm (like you'd care) perfectly safe is the music we hear we want more\n\n14.\n\nSomewhat Charming 02:48\n\nBlow a kiss to Natalie, then bash her in the head Wake up all the mental school then send them all to bed Give a rose to good ol' Nick, but make sure that it's dead Give me every scientist, I'll poison them with lead Here's to the dreams and new ideas now keep them to yourself I've had enough of your advice - I don't need any help at all I'm sick of the environment - who cares about the seals? I'm sure you disagree with me - just ignore what I feel DON'T MAKE A HUGE COMMOTION cause it is not a big deal I'll probably change my mind anyway... anyway.\n\n15.\n\nYour Majesty (original version) 03:01\n\nThe snake that I had captured got away went to play didn't say the things that I would like it to and so I felt like shouting cause I couldn't get the snake to speak it just would keep on hissing - hissing - bitching my thoughts go out entirely for snake bites never heal and that poor unknowing boy who is dead tried to warn him - tried to keep him from the things of danger keep him from the things of harm but he didn't listen - cause they never do (little boys) and now I sit here wondering why I didn't fry the snake in grease and eat it I could use the food and little boys would still be living laughing shouting screaming when they do not get their way so maybe it is better to keep the snakes alive keep them free let them do just what they want to and maybe I am glad to see the killing streak continue it's survival of the fittest of the bravest of the wisest of the law should have stayed at home, my little boy and watched your rose and kept your planet clean"
