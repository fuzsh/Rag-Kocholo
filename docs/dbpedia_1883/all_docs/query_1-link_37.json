        "text": "Insight on Jo Jean's latest song \"College Dropout\".\n\nAs defined by Jean, “College Dropout” is a fun playful song that people can relate to about the hardships of being a college student.\n\nWhen asked about the music video, she explains that it’s meant to tell a story.\n\n“So I'm walking on campus about to work on a project. Then I'm home eating, watching TV after school.”\n\n“Most of the scenes were impromptu and were thought of by my videographer and director. I just kind of went with the flow. I knew that I wanted to use my campus as one of the locations, [and] that I wanted some scenes to have a juxtaposition to the track.”\n\n“We wanted to directly showcase the frustration that I was talking about in the song by displaying a chaotic scene.”\n\nCollege Dropout is a song that originated in Thailand, where Jean was studying at the time. She wrote it when she was feeling homesick and started to look back into her high school years.\n\nShe started freestyling the thoughts running through her head to a beat by 8Rokeboy on YouTube, and that’s where the hook of the song came about.\n\n“‘Broke in school it’s not cool, I don’t even wanna be here anyway” because essentially, I didn't.”\n\nShe admits that listening to Cuco’s Keeping Tabs, and Beabadoobee’s If You Want To, subconsciously inspired her style of singing in this song.\n\nThe song was recorded in mid-December 2019, when she arrived back to South Florida from Thailand.\n\nWhen asked about college, this is part of what Jean had to say:\n\nHer musicianship is often compared to Kali Uchis, Billie Eilish or Erykah Badu.\n\n“All three are very talented and I see the comparisons, but all three aren’t me.”\n\nJean defines her sound as alternative, which for her means “all that is different from the mainstream.”\n\n“I am someone that looks and acts different from the status quo. My brand is to be myself regardless of what anyone or society says, and to love that about myself and to love myself by my own definitions.”\n\nFollow her journey on Instagram @joan.fabrics__\n\nRead her highlight HERE\n\nWatch her music video here:"
