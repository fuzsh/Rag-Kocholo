        "text": "The Stunt Man is The Headhunters new studio album out on Ropeadope October 11th, 2024. Recorded at the legendary Hyde Street Studios in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco in August 2023, The Stunt Man features seven songs spanning the genre-bending repertoire of the 50 year old ensemble co-led by original members Bill Summers on percussion and Mike Clark on drums.\n\nThe original and unique musical partnership between Summer and Clark who recorded on Herbie Hancock’s seminal albums Head Hunters, Thrust, Flood and Man Child before embarking on a blockbuster five decade career has stood the test of time and has honed a quintet of epic proportions featuring Donald Harrison on sax, Kyle Roussel on keys and Chris Severin on bass. The album was produced by Mike Clark, Bill Summers and Hyde Street resident engineer Chris McGrew.\n\nStarting out with the funk synth-driven ripping title track The Stunt Man (due out as a single on August 16th), the album also features originals Sand Castle Headhunters written by Harrison, and Attitude of Gratitude written by Roussel. Two timeless jazz standards Embraceable You by George Gershwin and ESP by Wayne Shorter are reimagined in energetic new ways. Clark is featured on his jazz drums in space track Avant Clark and fellow Ropeadope label mates Forward Back join the band and closes the album with a hip hop collaboration entitled New Levels - New Devils.\n\nLook out for The Headhunters album release tour starting June 22nd at the Aspen Jazz Experience and touring the US and Europe through the Fall. Stay tuned for more information on the limited edition vinyl release and more content from The Headhunters and Ropeadope coming soon.\n\nLive From Brooklyn Bowl\n\nRelease Date: August 11, 2023\n\nFew bands can claim a history as remarkable and illustrious as The Headhunters. Originating in 1973 under the visionary leadership of renowned musician Herbie Hancock, the band quickly established itself as a force to be reckoned with. Comprising percussionist Bill Summers, bassist Paul Jackson, saxophonist Bennie Maupin and Harvey Mason, who was soon replaced by legendary drummer Mike Clark, each member brought their unique talents to the table, forging a timeless legacy that surpasses the dreams of most musical ensembles. By blending jazz, funk, and rock, The Headhunters created a sound that resonated with audiences worldwide, selling over a million albums and inspiring musicians across genres for generations. Their music was even sampled by hundreds of hip-hop artists throughout the '80s and '90s, leaving an indelible mark on contemporary music.\n\nToday, The Headhunters' impact remains a global phenomenon, with their time alongside Hancock serving as a transformative experience. The band went on to release six more full-length albums. They ventured out on their own, free from Hancock's involvement, producing standout albums such as \"Survival of the Fittest\" in 1975 and \"Straight from the Gate\" in 1977. The band reunited with Herbie in 1998 for “Return of The Headhunters” and subsequent released albums “Evolution Revolution” in 2003 and “Platinum” in 2011. The Headhunters’ latest studio release “Speakers In The House” came out November 4th, 2022 to international acclaim through Ropeadope Records in association with Devil Hills Entertainment.\n\nNow co-led by original members Bill Summers on percussion Mike Clark on drums complemented by the talents of some of New Orleans' finest musicians: Kyle Roussel on keys, Donald Harrison on alto saxophone, and Chris Severin on seven-string bass. These lifelong friends have shaped the band into a musical powerhouse. In celebration of their eponymous album's 50th anniversary, the band embarked on a world tour in early 2023.\n\nThe journey began with a monumental performance meticulously recorded at the iconic Brooklyn Bowl in Williamsburg, New York, on February 9th, 2023. Showcasing the band's incredible live energy, this momentous occasion was masterfully captured and subsequently mixed and mastered in New Orleans by the talented Keenan McRae. The result is an extraordinary live album that encapsulates the essence of The Headhunters' artistry.\n\nThe album features an array of their greatest hits, including the iconic tracks \"Watermelon Man,\" \"Chameleon,\" \"Butterfly,\" and the latest original \"Rocking At The Mole House\" from studio album \"Speakers In The House.”\n\n“We live this every day. We have some secrets to give to the youth of the world. We’re not musicians, we are physicians - we heal people.”(Bill Summers)\n\nWith their 50th-anniversary live album, The Headhunters invite both loyal fans and new listeners to experience their groundbreaking sound in its raw and electrifying form. This release not only pays homage to their incredible journey but also serves as a testament to their enduring musical legacy. The band is scheduled to return to Europe and Canada this Fall and tour internationally in 2024.\n\nHancock took a new turn in the 70’s, handpicking a new band and sound that would ‘take some more of the earth and feel a little more tethered’. The result was the first platinum selling Jazz album in history. The lineup on that first album: Bennie Maupin, Paul Jackson, Harvey Mason, and Bill Summers. Mike Clark replaced Mason afterwards, and the lineup continued on several key Herbie Hancock releases such as “Thrust” and “Flood.”\n\nMike Clark and Bill Summers are two of a kind - they share a love for music that never dies. The pair kept The Headhunters alive, releasing two albums in “Survival of the Fittest” in 1975 and “Straight From The Gate” in 1977 with Herbie as featured guest. The chemistry between them is undeniable: They have persevered for over 40 years through industry setbacks, the death of band members, and more, to stay true to their mission with the same energy and zeal that the music demands.\n\n“We’re not in a gym, this isn’t a competition… this is art. What Bill and I and The Headhunters do is experience the moment and explore. After the count, we’re in that moment and there is no other. This is an act of passion, of love for humanity, and for our planet.” -Mike Clark\n\n“We live this every day. We have some secrets to give to the youth of the world. We’re not musicians, we are physicians - we heal people.” - Bill Summers\n\n11 years after their last release, The Headhunters are set to release “Speakers In The House,” a new full length album featuring Summers, Clark, NEA Jazz master Donald Harrison, Stephen Gordon, bassist Reggie Washington, and organist Jerry Z. The album also features Scott Roberts and Fode Sissoko on kora. The Headhunters spirit is alive and well on the album, which fuses the band’s African and New Orleans influences with their ever-present technical jazz-funk, rooted in music history and growing in the present moment.\n\n‘We’ve always made a statement as The Headhunters, and I’m looking at our longevity. Every time we’ve dropped notes on the wax, it has value, and can influence people and change lives.” - Bill Summers\n\n“Speakers In The House” is set for release on November 4, 2022.\n\nFor more information, contact Greg Lucas at Devil Hills Entertainment: greglucas@devilhillsent.com"
