        "text": "Top 40 Hip Hop Songs 1995: 1995 was another monumental year for Hip Hop, and a pivotal one as well. Because of infamous speeches by Deathrow representatives Suge Knight and Snoop Dogg on the 1995 Source Awards in New York City, animosity between East- and West Coast Hip Hop reached a boiling point – more specifically between Deathrow Records and Bad Boy Records – which would have tragic consequences in the years to come. It would also not be long before the big money people would really step in to create generic, mindless rap that would become a bane to the genre. But in ’95 the Golden Age still was in full swing, with a bunch of all-time classic albums being released.\n\nThis is our top 40 Hip Hop songs of 1995. Agree? Disagree? Discuss!\n\n11. 2Pac - So Many Tears\n\nArguably one of 2Pac’s most emotional and depressing songs (and that’s saying something). Meaningful, haunting, and deep, “So Many Tears” in an underrated classic.\n\n12. Bone Thugs N Harmony - 1st Of Tha Month\n\nDespite the kind of questionable lyrical content (celebrating the day welfare checks are paid out), this track is incredibly catchy and the one that really put BTNH on the map as one of Hip Hop’s newest sensations. The perfect warm-up for their 1996 mega-hit “Tha Crossroads”.\n\n14. Ice Cube - Friday\n\nWith Dr. Dre’s “Keep Their Heads Ringing”, this track is the other big banger from 1995 Friday Movie Soundtrack. This track was the start of the beef between Ice Cube and Cypress Hill (who claimed Cube stole the hook of the song after being with Cypress Hill in the studio).\n\n15. Big L - Street Struck\n\nThis classic cautionary tale warning listeners of the dangers of the hustler’s lifestyle on the inner-city streets, would 4 years later become a tragic reality for Big L himself as he was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting on his home-turf in Harlem.\n\n16. Goodie Mob - Cell Therapy\n\nReal and raw, Goodie Mob’s classic debut album Soul Food has that genre-bending musicality reminiscent of OutKast with true lyrical depth. Soul Food is one of those albums that age like fine wine and only get better as time goes by. Cee-Lo, T-Mo, Big Gipp, and Khujo dropped a real gem with this album, “Cell Therapy” is one of many excellent tracks the album contains. Southern Hip Hop at its finest.\n\n17. Mobb Deep - Survival Of The Fittest\n\nOne of the singles of the super classic The Infamous, with hard-hitting rhymes and an addictive chorus over another typical Havoc instrumental. Vintage Mobb Deep.\n\n18. Coolio - Gangsta's Paradise\n\n“Gangsta’s Paradise” was 1995 biggest selling single – in any musical genre – and even one of the biggest selling singles ever. The huge mainstream success of this song pretty much ended Coolio’s Hip Hop career, but this song has to be recognized as a classic (even if you’ve heard it a thousand times too many…).\n\n19. OutKast - Benz Or Beamer\n\nAppearing on the 1995 New Jersey Drive Soundtrack, “Benz Or Beamer” is one of the many classic OutKast joints we all have come to love, and one that would have fitted perfectly on the duo’s monumental 1996 sophomore album ATLiens.\n\n20. Channel Live - Mad Izm ft KRS One\n\nChannel Live dropped a dope if somewhat unremarkable boom-bap album with Station Identification. Hakim and Tuffy, considered proteges of KRS-One, come with dope rhymes over dark and heavy beats. This track is the undisputed highlight of the album.\n\n21. Raekwon - Incarcerated Scarfaces\n\nYet another classic song off Raekwon’s solo debut, arguably the best solo album from all Wu-Tang members. “Incarcerated Scarfaces” wasn’t one of the official singles of the album, but stands as one of its big tracks nevertheless. It’s also one of the few tracks off the album with no guest spots from fellow Wu-Tang members.\n\n27. Skee Lo - I Wish\n\n“I Wish” is a hit song by Skee-Lo, who may just be one of the biggest one-hit-wonders in Hip Hop. “I Wish” is a refreshing track with self-deprecating humor in a time when tough-guy posturing was the norm. A lot of pop appeal, but dope anyway.\n\n29. Jurassic 5 - Unified Rebelution\n\nThis early Jurassic 5 joint was a great prelude of much more excellent Hip Hop to come from this L.A. underground crew. “Unified Rebelution” succeeds admirably in capturing that old school vibe with throwback style rhyming and vintage scratches by Cut Chemist.\n\n32. Junior Mafia - Players Anthem\n\nThe lead single from Junior M.A.F.I.A.’s 1995 Conspiracy album, features group founder and Junior M.A.F.I.A. mentor Notorious B.I.G. on the chorus, one of the reasons the song became a big hit.\n\n36. Eightball & MJG - Space Age Pimpin'\n\nLegendary Memphis duo Eightball & MJG have been representing the South since their debut in 1993. In 1995 they already dropped their third album, On Top Of The World – one of their best. “Space Age Pimpin'” is one of the centerpieces of the album and one of the duo’s signature songs."
