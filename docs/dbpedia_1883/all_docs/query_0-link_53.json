For the next decade, the band continued to ascend to the top of the music world, earning four platinum albums and, with 1994’s Far Beyond Driven, a #1 debut on the Billboard album chart.\n\nTo celebrate Pantera’s raucous legacy, Rhino will release both a new boxed set and single disc compilation. THE COMPLETE STUDIO ALBUMS 1990-2000, compiled of Cowboys From Hell (1990), Vulgar Display Of Power (1992), Far Beyond Driven (1994), The Great Southern Trendkill (1996), and Reinventing The Steel (2000). Two versions of the collection will be released on December 11, one a 5-CD set and the other a limited edition 5-LP set on colored vinyl.\n\nThe LP version of the studio albums box also includes a 7” with two rare, non-albums tracks making their vinyl debut. The first is “Piss,” a song that debuted in 2012 on the 20th Anniversary Edition of Vulgar Display of Power. The second is “Avoid The Light” from the Dracula 2000 soundtrack.\n\nPrior to the release of the boxed set, Rhino will also release HISTORY OF HOSTILITY, a nine-track Pantera primer that includes some of Pantera’s most legendary tracks from all five studio albums. It will be released on CD and LP on October 30.\n\nPhilip Anselmo joined Dimebag Darrell, Vinnie Paul, and Rex Brown in 1987 to form a new, harder-hitting version of Pantera. The line-up made its debut in 1990 on Cowboys From Hell. The album’s visceral combination of jackhammer grooves, heavyweight riffs and guttural howls made Pantera heroes to headbangers everywhere. The album went on to become one of the most influential metal albums of all time.\n\nFor its hotly anticipated follow-up, Pantera returned in 1992 with Vulgar Display of Power. It refined the heavier-than-heavy aesthetic from the previous album on crushing songs like “Walk” and “Mouth For War,” but also showcased the band’s range on the haunting ballad, “Hollow.” The album was certified double platinum and spent 79 weeks on the charts, longer than any other Pantera album.\n\nThe band had its greatest success in 1994 with the release of Far Beyond Driven, still the most extreme album to ever debut at #1 on the Billboard top album chart. Several songs from the album became the band’s most iconic including “5 Minutes Alone,” “I’m Broken,” and their cover of Black Sabbath’s “Planet Caravan.”\n\nThe Great Southern Trendkill arrived in 1996 and peaked at #2 on the charts. The platinum-certified album contains some of Pantera’s darkest lyrics (“Suicide Note Pt. 1”) and fastest tempos (“Sandblasted Skin.”) In 2000, the band released what would be its final studio album, Reinventing the Steel. It peaked at #4 on the charts and was certified gold. It features several classic cuts including “Revolution Is My Name” and “Goddamn Electric.”\n\nTHE COMPLETE STUDIO ALBUMS 1990-2000\n\nCD & LP Album Listing (Vinyl colors noted)\n\nCowboys From Hell (White Vinyl)\n\nVulgar Display Of Power (Red Vinyl)\n\nFar Beyond Driven (Blue Vinyl)\n\nThe Great Southern Trendkill (Gold Vinyl)\n\nReinventing The Steel (Orange Vinyl)\n\nBonus 7” in LP box:\n\n“Piss” b/w “Avoid The Light” (Translucent Yellow Vinyl)\n\nHISTORY OF HOSTILITY\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. “Cowboys From Hell”\n\n2. “Cemetery Gates” (Demon Knight Edit)\n\n3. “Mouth For War”\n\n4. “Walk”\n\n5. “Fucking Hostile”\n\n6. “I’m Broken”\n\n7. “5 Minutes Alone”\n\n8. “Drag The Waters”\n\n9. “Revolution Is My Name”…\n\nSummarizing heavy metal history with 50 of its greatest albums is, needless to say, a daunting task. After all, if you view Black Sabbath’s arrival in 1970 as the metal genre’s year zero, simple mathematics would only allow for just over one album from each year. The point being, mathematics were no help to the Loudwire staff as we set about compiling, debating, challenging and insulting, and finally reluctantly agreeing to the list you now see before you in the gallery above.\n\nIn it, you’ll find some obvious names, like Metallica, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden and Slayer, some expected ones like Megadeth, Judas Priest, Motorhead and Pantera, and hopefully some surprises, but our goal was to represent the albums containing the very best music and displaying the greatest influence within a genre that has been thriving for 40 plus years with no signs of slowing down.\n\nSo check out Loudwire’s Top 50 Metal Albums of All Time in the gallery above! And check out more Loudwire lists below.\n\nhttp://loudwire.com/top-metal-albums-of-all-time/…\n\nFrom VH1.com: “Sold out.” “Gone soft.” These are phrases we hear when metal bands step a toe in the land of the light. Perhaps inspired by my recent article about heavy bands that took huge left turns with respect to their creative direction, it got me thinking about how much I enjoy when metal bands include something different on an already heavy album: a token curveball among a collection of 100 mph fastballs.\n\nBecause it’s coming from a heavy band, I almost appreciate it more when we get a glimpse into the more vulnerable side of genre known for projecting unyielding strength and stoic resolve. Often it affects me more than listening to a folk artist like Jack Johnson where the entire soundscape is sensitive, quiet, and beautiful. I yearn for the peaks and valleys, the yins and yangs.\n\nAs I was formulating this list, I had to set up some parameters:\n\nFirst, what classifies as a heavy band? I could have included Alice In Chains’ “Nutshell”, which is a monumentally popular track, loved by metalheads and normal folks alike. Is Alice In Chains a rock band? A metal band? It’s difficult to say, but I felt that they released a substantial quantity of acoustic, lighter music that it’s basically just part of their sound.\n\nComing in at #6; Pantera – “Suicide Note Pt. I”\n\nThere was a big temptation on my behalf to include “Planet Caravan”, Pantera’s haunting Black Sabbath cover that closed Far Beyond Driven. The more I thought about it, I realized Pantera deserved to be recognized for an original song. Their versatility is really what made them the biggest metal band of their era. Like Metallica before them and Slipknot after, being the top dog requires serious range. Even though “Suicide Note Pt. I” is an acoustic song, it never loses any of the intensity Pantera was known for. Much of it had to do with Phil Anselmo’s vocal delivery, which was as emotive as it was masculine, but never felt forced. From “Cemetery Gates” to “Hollow” to “Floods”, these guys always knew how to paint with different colors. This type of breather in the midst of crushing jams is what was missing from Pantera’s swan song, Reinventing the Steel.\n\nTo check out the ariginal article and see the rest of the top 10, check it out on VH1’s page here.…\n\nAs originally posted on Rolling Stone here.\n\nThe Guitar Hero franchise is coming back in 2015 after a five-year hiatus, and now Guitar Hero Live has revealed the first 24 songs from its expansive set list. The Rolling Stones, Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Black Keys and Green Day are among the initial wave of artists that will contribute music to the upcoming game.\n\nAmong the new features on the revitalized Guitar Hero are a more realistic controller/instrument – no more deadly orange pinky button – and a 24-hour music video network called GHTV, “the world’s first playable music video network.” Game creators Activision says the channel will allow participants to play along to official videos across various genres and challenge other online players of the same skill level.\n\nGuitar Hero Live will also present the game from a first-person perspective, allowing gamers to almost interact with the crowd and their bandmates on screen. “If you start dropping notes and messing it up, not only are the crowd gonna turn on you, but so are your band members as well, because you’re effectively ruining their career as well as your own,” Jackson said. FreeStyle and Activision partnered on Guitar Hero Live.\n\nGuitar Hero Live Initial Set List\n\nThe Black Keys – “Gold on the Ceiling”\n\nBlitz Kids – “Sometimes”\n\nEd Sheeran – “Sing”\n\nFall Out Boy – “My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)”\n\nGary Clark, Jr. – “Don’t Owe You a Thang”\n\nGreen Day – “Nuclear Family”\n\nThe Killers – “When You Were Young”\n\nThe Lumineers – “Ho Hey”\n\nMy Chemical Romance – “Na Na Na”\n\nPierce the Veil – “King for a Day (feat.
