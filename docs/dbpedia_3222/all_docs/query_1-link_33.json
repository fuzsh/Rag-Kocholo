        "text": "COMBINED ACCESSIBLE TRANSCRIPT\n\n[bright music]\n\n[jazz music]\n\nProgram Narrator:\n\nMajor support provided by…\n\n[new jazz music]\n\nMajor support for this program provided in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the following:\n\nOn screen:\n\nA Q&A with the cast of Laugh In:\n\nMan:\n\nMr. Buckley, I’ve noticed that whenever you appear on television, you’re always seated. Does this mean you can’t think on your feet?\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nBuckley:\n\nIt’s very, very hard to stand up carrying the weight of what I know.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley stifles a smile, eventually relenting. A collage of photos: Buckley with family, meeting dignitaries, and riding a moped in city traffic.\n\nPrimary Narrator:\n\nAnd now will you welcome, please, a man who’s been described in a million different ways. He’s articulate, provocative, a scourge to some people and a hero to others. I always find him fascinating.\n\nNarrator 2:\n\nVery, very strong opinions.\n\nNarrator 3:\n\nOne of the most controversial and charming men on television, Mr. William F. Buckley Jr.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley saunters onto a talk show set.\n\nEarl:\n\nBill Buckley was so refreshing. He was so exciting.\n\nBuckley:\n\nIt seems to me that whoever said that was trying to be provocative. Whether he is naturally or affectedly stupid, I don’t know.\n\n[ Laughter, applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nA charming smile.\n\nEarl:\n\nWhether you agreed with him and loved him or he enraged you, Buckley made everybody’s blood run quickly.\n\nBuckley:\n\nI think that you used the word “violence” with such slovenliness as to render yourself unintelligible.\n\nPrimary Narrator:\n\nThis is the William F. Buckley America knows best, the man someone called the “king of leer,” grimacing or incredulous or disdainful.\n\nTV Host:\n\nMr. Buckley, you once called Harry Truman “the nation’s most conspicuous vulgarian.” You said of General Eisenhower that, “When he touches a subject, every ray of light, every breath of air is choked out”. Of the Kennedy administration, I quote you, “There are not enough psychiatrists to cure this crazy administration.” And you’ve called President Johnson “Uncle Cornpone.”\n\nBuckley:\n\nI didn’t say that about Kennedy. I said the other three, though.\n\nTV Host:\n\nRight.\n\nBuckley:\n\nI’d be glad to elaborate on it.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ]\n\n[ Flashbulb pops ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nAn impish grin. At an event, he escorts two women wearing sashes.\n\nMan:\n\nBill was so big that he wasn’t one thing. A political man, yes, but also a literary one, a provocateur, a public brawler, but also a kind of poet.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe signs autographs.\n\nMan:\n\nHe wanted to encompass as many forms of conservatism as he could.\n\nBuckley:\n\nIt certainly isn’t just rich people. It certainly isn’t just poor people. It certainly isn’t just Westerners or just Middle Westerners. There are conservatives everywhere I’ve been in America.\n\nMan:\n\nIt wasn’t about personal power. It was about building a movement.\n\nMan:\n\nThe conservatives paid one dollar each to see William F. Buckley Jr. There was nothing fancy on the menu here, just hot tongue and cold shoulder for everything distasteful to the conservatives.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA banner: Sock it to the left.\n\nMan:\n\nWithout William Buckley, conservatism, as we understand it, would never have happened.\n\nOn screen:\n\nOn the dais, he grins.\n\nSam:\n\nBuckley said that he was a revolutionary against the establishment, an intellectual revolutionary.\n\nMan:\n\nI can’t think of anyone who you would compare him to over the last three-quarters of a century who had the impact that he had on American political life.\n\nOn screen:\n\nWith Reagan, then Nixon.\n\nMan:\n\nTo have built the kind of edifice of ideas and institutions that Buckley did is astonishing. It’s just astonishing.\n\n[ Typewriter clacking ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nA title appears in courier font: The Insufferable Mr. Buckley. The word insufferable is struck and replaced. The INCOMPERABLE Mr. Buckley.\n\n[ Bell dings ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley addresses the camera, head tilted back, looking down his nose.\n\nMan:\n\nReady, Mr. Buckley?\n\nBuckley:\n\nAll set.\n\nMan:\n\nGo.\n\nBuckley:\n\nWhy are the races unreconciled? Why does poverty persevere? Why are our governors indifferent to us? Why are the young disenchanted? Why do the birds sing so unhappily? It is easy to be carried away. And yet always there is a strain of seriousness, something in the system that warns us, warns us that America had better strike out on a different course rather than face another four years of asphyxiation by liberal promises.\n\n[ Crowd shouting ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nSigns wave at a convention. Biographer Sam Tanenhaus:\n\nSam:\n\nThere is no political movement that comes close to the American conservative movement, where you actually have a different idea about what the country should be like and then over time the country gets there. And that’s what happened with this conservative movement.\n\nBuckley:\n\nUnder liberalism, America hasn’t prospered.\n\nSam:\n\nBill Buckley was one of its best writers, maybe its best debater. He was its voice. He was its face. There’s the Whitman line, “I contain multitudes.” Buckley did contain multitudes within himself.\n\nBuckley:\n\nThis is William F. Buckley Jr. in New York. Perfect.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nGood.\n\n[ Laughs ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nA younger Buckley holds an infant. Son, Christopher Buckley:\n\nChristopher:\n\nMy father was a man of many parts. If you asked me what I was most proud of, it was his generosity of soul.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe young family dines by snowy slopes.\n\nChristopher:\n\nI have a hard time imagining Pop sitting down at his desk and thinking, “I shall become a leader,” you know?\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley wears captain’s hat on a yacht.\n\nChristopher:\n\nI think it evolved much more organically.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe plays with his preschool son on a lawn.\n\nChristopher:\n\nSomeone once wrote my father and said, “Mr. Buckley, what is the secret to happiness?” And he wrote back, “Don’t grow up.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nAs a teen, he wears a suit and tie.\n\nChristopher:\n\nHe was raised in, I guess you could call it a bubble. It was sort of — You could call it Buckley World.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe mugs at the camera. People ride horses in a pasture.\n\nChristopher:\n\nIn 1923, the family bought a house in Sharon, Connecticut, and it was called Great Elm because there was an enormous elm tree. I think it was the largest and oldest elm in Connecticut.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe 100-foot-tall elm obscures the grand, two-story manor with a columned portico. Author Kevin Schultz:\n\nKevin:\n\nGreat Elm was a world unto itself. It’s this huge estate. There’s 114 rooms in this house, filled with six pianos so all the children could practice on their own. The family was unbelievably insular. Nobody had to go outside of the walls in order to encounter any part of life.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAuthor John B. Judis.\n\nJohn:\n\nThey don’t go to the local school. They have a school that they hold within their house.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAuthor Carl. T. Bogus:\n\nCarl:\n\nAnd they have a variety of tutors in academic subjects, tutors in ballroom dancing and horse riding.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Lee Edwards:\n\nLee:\n\nThey were learning French, learning Spanish, learning how to sail, learning how to hunt.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAuthor Nick Buccola:\n\nNick:\n\nIt was like a summer camp and a liberal arts college right there at the estate.\n\nOn screen:\n\nYoung people gallop their horses.\n\nLee:\n\nThe Buckley children had an opportunity to inspire each other, to challenge each other, driven by their father. He really was sort of the headmaster of this academy.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAn older gentleman wears a bowtie.\n\nChristopher:\n\nMy grandfather was a fascinating guy. He grew up dirt poor. He went down to Mexico and got into the oil business.\n\nOn screen:\n\nFour men pose at the base of a derrick.\n\nChristopher:\n\nAnd it was boom and bust.\n\nOn screen:\n\nCrude shoots into the air.\n\nChristopher:\n\nEventually, he found a lot of oil.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Matthew Continetti:\n\nMatthew:\n\nWill Buckley was searching for fortune, but he got caught up in a lot of revolutionary movements in Latin America…\n\nOn screen:\n\nArmed men wear sombreros.\n\nMatthew:\n\n…and I think that instilled in him a distaste for disorder and a fear of revolt…\n\nOn screen:\n\nRevolutionaries pose by a body.\n\nMatthew:\n\n…and he communicated that to his children.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe poses with his wife an nine children.\n\nChristopher:\n\nMy grandmother was an enchanting woman. We called her Mimi, Aloise Steiner Buckley. Deeply, deeply religious. She gave my father a religious faith that was the molten core of his being, and I think you could extrapolate from that everything about my father.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA preteen Buckley posses with siblings, his toothy smile apparent.\n\nNick:\n\nThat devotion ends up being kind of at the core of Buckley’s understanding of what love is — love of one’s friends, one’s family, and one’s country.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA toddler runs to the senior Buckley.\n\nLee:\n\nThis was Will Sr.’s pedagogical idea…\n\nOn screen:\n\nLee Edwards:\n\nLee:\n\n…to say, “I’m not going to entrust this to government, to take care of my children. I’m going to create this perfect brood of young people.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nOn the wide porch, children play musical chairs.\n\nLee:\n\nHe’s trying to extract the very best from his children, challenging them again and again.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe family dines outdoors.\n\nLee:\n\nBill Buckley Jr. really learned how to defend himself and to stake out positions which nobody else had staked out.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Matthew Continetti:\n\nMatthew:\n\nThere were frequent guests, and among the guests was a major influence on Buckley, the literary journalist Albert Jay Nock. Nock was a former Anglican priest who abandoned his family to become an intellectual aristocrat.\n\nChristopher:\n\nNock’s theme was essentially civilization was in decline…\n\nOn screen:\n\nA quote from Memoirs of a Superfluous Man: “The mass man is not only weak minded and weak willed, but knavish, arrogant, grasping, dissipated, unprincipled, unscrupulous.”\n\nChristopher:\n\n…and it had come down to what he called “the remnant,”…\n\nOn screen:\n\nA quote: “The Remnant are those who possess a saving force of intellect and force of character.”\n\nChristopher:\n\n…which was a very limited number of people who could really be trusted to lead wisely.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA quote: “When everything has gone completely to the dogs, they are the ones who will come back and build up a new society.” Historian Beverly Gage:\n\nBeverly:\n\nThat central thought that there is a noble remnant of highly educated men, in particular, who were going to stand apart from society, who could see things that other people couldn’t see, loomed very large for Buckley.\n\nOn screen:\n\nYoung Buckley poses with his horse and a trophy.\n\nBeverly:\n\nAnd it really becomes part of the sensibility of the conservative movement.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA man conducts a chorus of dozens of young men.\n\nSong:\n\n♪ And the morning light we hail ♪\n\n♪ We will sing with cheerful hearts ♪\n\n♪ Songs of home and of Yale ♪\n\n♪ And of dear old Yale, la la la la ♪\n\nPrimary Narrator:\n\nFor more than 200 years, Yale, founded in the conviction that the preservation of freedom demands educated men…\n\nGeoffrey:\n\nSo, Bill Buckley was in the class of 1950…\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Geoffrey Cabaservice:\n\nGeoffrey:\n\n…at Yale, and he enters Yale at a very unusual time in its history.\n\nOn screen:\n\nUniformed servicemen march onto campus.\n\nChristopher:\n\nMy father was drafted. He was in the Army, and this was the first class at Yale that was almost entirely veterans. A lot of these men had been delayed by this event called World War II, and they wanted to get on with it. And so my father hit the ground running.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA portrait of six men on the Class Day Committee.\n\nSam:\n\nHe was always a great debater. He was tapped for Skull and Bones, which was the oldest and most prestigious of Yale’s senior societies. He was popular with friends and faculty. Bill Buckley was welcomed into every circle of Yale. And, of course, a lot of these things came because he was named the chairman of the Yale Daily News.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA man addresses young men in suits and ties.\n\nMan:\n\nFirst you’ll get training, intensive training on a near-professional daily. You’ll learn how to go out and get the news, and then you’ll learn how to come back here and write the news and write it fast.\n\nLee:\n\nThe Yale Daily News had been, you know, a very nice, typical college newspaper. Under Buckley, really became the center of controversy and debate on the issues of the day.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHeadlines:\n\nRoosevelt Wins on Jobs Relief Plan.\n\nRoosevelt Orders Electricity Loans.\n\nChristopher:\n\nHe would pound out these fiery, but always witty, denunciations of socialism and rampant atheism that he saw at Yale.\n\nCarl:\n\nEverybody read his editorials.\n\nOn screen:\n\nQuotes:\n\nWhy should religion play the underdog?\n\nThis column has presented views which have been classified, variously as reactionary, archaic, malicious, and fascist.\n\nCarl:\n\nHe was fearless. He criticized his professors at Yale by name, and he didn’t pull punches.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley’s words:\n\nLee:\n\nProfessor Kennedy has made a cult of anti-religion. It is obvious that in undermining religion through bawdy and slapstick humor, he is guilty of injustice to an imposition upon his students and the University.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAuthor Carl T. Bogus:\n\nCarl:\n\nHe knew he was going to get under the skin of faculty and administration and most students. That didn’t bother him. Au contraire, he delighted in it.\n\n[ Marching band plays ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nAt a campus event, men wear striped blazers and straw hats.\n\nCarl:\n\nThere is an annual tradition at Yale called the Alumni Day speech. And because of Buckley’s eloquence and brilliance, the Yale administration invites him to give the speech.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAn announcement: William F. Buckley Jr, class of 1950.\n\nCarl:\n\nThen they have second thoughts. “Wait a minute. We have just invited a critic of Yale and of the Yale administration to give a speech. What is he going to tell the alumni?”\n\nOn screen:\n\nA type-written speech.\n\nCarl:\n\nBuckley sends them the draft. They call him, and they want lots of changes.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA quote: “So long as Yale professes this uncurbed, all-encompassing, fanatical allegiance to laissez-faire education, she will lead her students nowhere.”\n\nCarl:\n\nHe realizes what’s happening here, which is they wish to clip his wings. So, he says, “Well, I’ll tell you what. I can give my speech the way I wrote it or not. You decide.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe announcement erases William F. Buckley Jr.\n\nCarl:\n\nThey say, “Okay, thanks. We’ll find somebody else.”\n\n[ Typewriter clacking ]\n\n[ Bell dings ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nGeorge B. Montgomery, class of 1950.\n\nCarl:\n\nThere’s an old saying that “revenge is a dish best served cold.” You didn’t like the speech? You’re going to like the book even less.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley poses with a book: “God and Man at Yale.”\n\nText:\n\nTwo months after graduation.\n\nSong:\n\n♪ I love you, man ♪\n\nOn screen:\n\nA tuxedoed Buckley poses with his bride on their garden wedding day.\n\nSong:\n\n♪ Every bit of you I’ll take ♪\n\nChristopher:\n\nIn those days, a lot of men met their wives through their sisters.\n\nOn screen:\n\nGuests shake hands with eight bridesmaids.\n\nChristopher:\n\nAnd indeed, my father’s sister Trish roomed with this debutante from Vancouver named Patricia Taylor. And she immediately sent word to all the siblings — “I’ve found the perfect girl for Billy. She’s regal.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nShe sits for a portrait in a black, off-the-shoulder dress and pearl necklace. Her hair falls in thick waves to her shoulders.\n\nSong:\n\n♪ …is pain ♪\n\n♪ I won’t give up ♪\n\nPatricia:\n\nThey had gone to a prom together…\n\nOn screen:\n\nTrish Buckley:\n\nPatricia:\n\n…and Bill used to take a book and put it in his jacket pocket in case — you know, in case–\n\nInterviewer:\n\nIn case he was bored?\n\nPatricia:\n\nYes. But needless to say, he never took it out.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley smiles with Patricia.\n\nSong:\n\n♪ The one I want ♪\n\nChristopher:\n\nThey had about three dates. One thing led to another.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe wedding.\n\nChristopher:\n\nAnd indeed, my father’s sister Trish roomed with this debutante from Vancouver named Patricia They had the largest wedding in Vancouver history.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHundreds attend the garden wedding.\n\nChristopher:\n\nAnd indeed, my father’s sister Trish roomed with this debutante from Vancouver named Patricia. He was dashing. She was gorgeous. These two were made for each other.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA photo captures the couple in a kiss.\n\nText:\n\nWithin weeks, Buckley began work on his first book.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley smiles as he stands with his new wife.\n\nSong:\n\n♪ …the same ♪\n\n♪ It’s forever better when there’s a flame ♪\n\n[ Typewriter clacking ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nGod and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of Academic Freedom.\n\nBill:\n\nI was 24 when I began writing the book, freshly married.\n\n[ Bell dings ]\n\nRumors that the book was being written had got around. They caused considerable consternation at Woodbridge Hall, which is Yale’s White House.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Beverly Gage:\n\nBeverly:\n\n“God and Man at Yale” came out in 1951, and it was really a full-throated attack on the university.\n\nGeoffrey:\n\nI propose simply to expose what I regard as an extraordinarily irresponsible educational attitude…\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Geoffrey Kabaservice:\n\nGeoffrey:\n\n… that, under the protective label “academic freedom.” “God and Man at Yale” is a critique of an establishment gone wrong. It’s, “You people out there in America, here’s what the elites are doing.”\n\nRick:\n\nThey mock Christianity.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Rick Perlstein:\n\nRick:\n\nThey don’t uphold what he calls “economic individualism,” you know, free markets.\n\nBill:\n\nThe institution derives its moral and financial support from Christian individualists and then addresses itself to the task of persuading the sons of these supporters to be atheistic socialists.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA review: “propaganda, dull, slavish, and uninspired.”\n\nRick:\n\nIt was a book with a naturally limited audience until Yale decides that they’re gonna fight back.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAuthor Nick Buccola:\n\nNick:\n\nYale engages in a campaign to rebut Buckley and to try to challenge him.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAuthor Kevin Schultz:\n\nKevin:\n\nThey recruited authors to write responses, including McGeorge Bundy, one of their most distinguished alumni.\n\nChristopher:\n\nMcGeorge Bundy reviewed the book and said, “Mr. Buckley has disgraced God, and he has disgraced Yale.” And then he called him “a twisted young man.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nYoung Buckley chomps a cigar.\n\nChristopher:\n\nHe essentially had attacked the world he came from. But it put him on the map. And to this day, I get royalty statements.\n\nOn screen:\n\nOn the best seller list: God and Man at Yale. Now, a newsreel titled Communist Imperialism. Hammer and sickle icons cover a map.\n\nMan:\n\nThe relentless sweep of communism has radically changed the map of Europe.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBrezhnev watches a military parade.\n\nBeverly:\n\nBuckley graduated from Yale into a world where the struggle against communism and socialism were already the central issues of American politics.\n\nPrimary Narrator:\n\nThe growing menace of communism arouses the House of Representatives Un-American Activities Committee.\n\nMan:\n\nAre you a member of the Communist Party, or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?\n\nOn screen:\n\nA headline: Hiss Found Guilty.\n\nMan:\n\nIt’s unfortunate and tragic that I have to teach this committee the basic principles of Americanism.\n\nMan:\n\nThat’s not the question!\n\nRick:\n\nThese Communists could be anywhere.

You’re not fooling anyone at all, I’m sure of that.\n\nMan:\n\nSenator, let me tell you something. The chair believes that — The American people have had a look at you for six weeks. You’re not fooling anyone, either.\n\nOn screen:\n\nMcCarthy looks up from his notes at the smirking witness.\n\nBuckley:\n\nMcCarthy’s record, we have, in my judgment at this moment, tended to distort.\n\nMan:\n\nIn what way have we distorted McCarthy’s record?\n\nBuckley:\n\nIn this way, we have exclusively centered on the number of people about whom he exaggerated, whereas, as you know, my own position and I think well-documented…\n\nOn screen:\n\nA book title: McCarthy and his Enemies.\n\nBuckley:\n\n…in a hefty book, is that…\n\nBeverly:\n\nBuckley’s second book came out just as McCarthy was essentially driven out of respectable political life.\n\nBuckley:\n\nI would say McCarthy did uniquely stand up on the world stage, on the United States stage, address himself to a real problem…\n\nBeverly:\n\nBuckley acknowledges that McCarthy has used questionable methods, that he has lied.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn a political cartoon, McCarthy holds a doctored photo and a faked letter.\n\nBuckley:\n\n…forgive him for his occasional excess.\n\nBeverly:\n\nBut, for the most part, he says, “That’s okay, because McCarthy’s doing this for the right cause and because people on the other side are so much worse.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nMcCarthy holds up a petition titled McCarthyism is Treason to America. Historian Beverly Gage:\n\nBeverly:\n\nTo Buckley, the idea was that the political establishment had been so captured by a form of liberalism that, in fact, the mantle was going to have to be taken up somewhere else.\n\n[ Camera shutter clicking ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley walks with McCarthy on a tarmac.\n\nBeverly:\n\nBuckley thought of himself as a lone figure battling forces much more powerful than he was, and that outsider identity really fueled his ambition and became really central to the movement itself.\n\n[ Airplane engine roaring ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nA passenger jet rises into the air.

It was, he felt, the way by which a movement could be created and could challenge the prevailing liberal zeitgeist.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA quote: “It stands athwart history, yelling stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so.”\n\nMatthew:\n\nAs he says in the opening editorial, the role of National Review is to stand up for the principles and values that informed the founding of the United States. And for Buckley, that meant a free market. It meant a limited government.\n\nOn screen:\n\nArticle titles:\n\nHow to Make Money in the Stock Market;\n\nThe Fantasy of World Government;\n\nWhat Individualism is Not;\n\nThe Soviet Price System;\n\nThe Kremlin’s Greatest Worry.\n\nMatthew:\n\nAnd overall, it meant implacable anti-Communism.\n\nOn screen:\n\nEditor Richard Brookhiser:\n\nRichard:\n\nBut you can’t do a magazine all by yourself. You got to have other people to run it. So, who does he find? Well, he finds this wonderful alliance of ex-Communists, including Russell Kirk, the most famous of them. He finds James Burnham. He was an American Trotskyist. Bill found his college professor Willmoore Kendall. He was both a very compelling man and an extremely difficult one. There was Willi Schlamm, who was a Austrian émigré. Frank Meyer becomes the book review editor, and he was nocturnal. You know, he’d wake up as the sun was going down and then he’d go to sleep as it was rising back up.\n\nOn screen:\n\nSam Tanenhaus:\n\nSam:\n\nAnd then there’s the prize they all want, the most famous ex-Communist in America, Whittaker Chambers.\n\nMan:\n\nMr. Hiss represents the concealed enemy against which we are all fighting and I am fighting.\n\nMatthew:\n\nThese men don’t like each other very much. They’re factions. But what Buckley sees is that there are many things upon which these factions disagree, but they can be united by what they oppose. And so Buckley thinks of anti-Communism as the glue that can hold these factions together.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAn article: Soviet Strategy in the Middle East, by Whittacker Chambers. In New York, taxi cabs drive past sidewalks crowded with 1960’s pedestrians.\n\nMatthew:\n\nAt that time, National Review was at 35th Street in Manhattan.

He met young people all the time. And what he found was they liked him because he was anti-establishment.\n\nBuckley:\n\nThat American resistance by the minority is nowadays more remarkable than American acquiescence by the majority.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAuthor Kevin Schultz:\n\nKevin:\n\nBuckley had a sense that building a movement from the youth up was a key way to pushing forward your ideas. So, he says to a bunch of young conservative college students, “Why don’t I invite you to my father’s house in Sharon, Connecticut, and we will discuss what this looks like?”\n\nText:\n\nBuckley invited 100 students to Great Elm, where they formed an organization: Young Americans for Freedom, or YAF.\n\nLee:\n\nWe came together that weekend…\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Lee Edwards:\n\nLee:\n\n…and I think really made some history by forming YAF. Buckley, the maker of a movement, he was sort of there as a validating presence. “This is serious, guys.” He wants us to be part of this movement.\n\nPrimary Narrator:\n\nThe Young Americans for Freedom claims 51,000 members on more than 500 college campuses.\n\nLee:\n\nWe all talked like Bill. We tried to dress like Bill.\n\nPrimary Narrator:\n\n…plenty in shirts and ties.\n\nLee:\n\nWe read the things that he read.\n\nPrimary Narrator:\n\nFree love or LSD doesn’t turn them on, but conservative heroes like William Buckley do.\n\nLee:\n\nWe caught some of his conviction, “Hey, we really can change things.” Looking around at the movement, we could see that, “Okay. We’ve got Bill Buckley, we’ve got National Review, but we need a political figure. Who do we got?”\n\n[ Country music plays ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nA man poses in dungarees with a rifle.\n\nLee:\n\nThen along comes Barry Goldwater out of Arizona, riding a palomino horse, looking like a not-so-distant cousin of John Wayne.

I’m very impressed with him.\n\nKevin:\n\nI think by a portion of something like two to one, the Republican rank and file doesn’t want Goldwater as the nominee. So what YAF does is they take over the Republican Party.\n\nCrowd:\n\nWe want Barry! We want Barry!\n\n[ Cheers and applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nYoung people wave flags and photos of Goldwater.\n\nAnnouncer:\n\nThe Republican National Convention reaches San Francisco to name a presidential nominee for 1964.\n\nKevin:\n\nThis must’ve been the perfect moment for Buckley. As he drives to the convention center, he sees the energy in the streets. He sees the youthful, the excitement for Barry Goldwater, and his conservative movement is finally happening.\n\nReporter:\n\nFor more than a half-hour, the Goldwater backers whoop it up for the senator.\n\nOn screen:\n\nConfetti rains down.\n\nReporter:\n\nTheir overwhelming majority here is no accident.\n\nMatthew:\n\nGoldwater wins the nomination.\n\n[ Crowd cheering ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nThousands of balloons drop.\n\nMatthew:\n\nHe was somewhat a new personality to most American voters.

These were high-stakes times, the Cold War.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBeverly Gage:\n\nBeverly:\n\nQuite quickly, Goldwater becomes tagged as someone who is essentially the candidate of paranoid conspiracists of the John Birch Society.\n\nReporter:\n\nThe John Birch Society is a group of Americans who have joined together to combat the evil forces which now threaten our country, our lives, and our civilization.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA billboard: Had enough coexistence with evil? John the John Birch Society. Historian Joshua Tate:\n\nJoshua:\n\nThe John Birch Society was founded by Robert Welch, who was, among other things, a candy magnate.\n\nRick:\n\nHe was famous for Junior Mints, Milk Duds. Made a fortune.\n\nMan:\n\nThe John Birch Society was staunchly, incredibly anti-Communist.\n\nMan:\n\nWe have got to deceive the international Communist world control conspiracy, and that we will do.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Matthew Continetti:\n\nMatthew:\n\nThe Birchers were conspiracy theorists. They thought Dwight Eisenhower was a Communist.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA small group salutes a flag.\n\nMatthew:\n\nAnd so Buckley recognized that if the Birchers were to become the face of American conservatism, that would doom the prospects of the movement.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nWhat’s the National Review’s view of groups like the John Birch Society, Mr. Welch, some of the even more extreme groups?\n\nBuckley:\n\nThere seems to be no lunacy of which Robert Welch is incapable.\n\nGeoffrey:\n\nBuckley was concerned about the respectability of the conservative movement with educated, middle-class Americans.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA billboard claims to show MLK at communist training school. Geoffrey Kabaservice:\n\nGeoffrey:\n\nIf they see something that they consider to be ridiculous and pathological, then they’re going to pass by crackpot alley and go all the way over to the Democrats.\n\nBuckley:\n\nRobert Welch is ill-equipped to lead a national political movement. On the other hand, it is wrong, in my judgment, to anathematize every member of the John Birch Society.\n\nRick:\n\nOn the other hand, he knows that a lot of his subscribers to National Review are Birchers. And, in fact, at least three people who are on the National Review masthead were members of the John Birch Society.\n\nMatthew:\n\nSo, he had to tread carefully.\n\nBuckley:\n\nI would assume that you would also be counting on the fervor of people such as Welch and people in the Birch Society.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nOh, sure, sure, sure, sure. Just as Johnson has fervently working for him the Communists in this country.\n\nOn screen:\n\nMatthew Sitman:\n\nMatthew:\n\nThis is something we see again and again in the history of conservative politics, riding the tiger. We can corral or control these unruly popular energies. We can polish them up a little bit. We can direct them, even, hopefully.\n\nLee:\n\nBut the damage had already been done.\n\nMan:\n\nPeople called Goldwater a Nazi. Psychiatrists came out to say that he was mentally unfit for the presidency.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA rally sign bears a swastika. In an editorial cartoon, Goldwater leans against a birch society tree.

Bogus:\n\nCarl:\n\nHow much of that Goldwater humiliation is going to rub off on conservatism? That is Buckley’s chief concern.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nYou feel, then, that Goldwater has no chance?\n\nBuckley:\n\nNo, you asked me if I thought he was gonna win. I said, “No, I don’t think he’s gonna win.”\n\nMan:\n\nBuckley did, I think, a thing that you would never see today. He gave a speech where he said, “Barry Goldwater is going to lose this election, and we need to think about how we’re going to recover from this.”\n\nMan:\n\nThe point is to win recruits whose attention we might never have attracted but for Barry Goldwater. To infuse the conservative spirit in enough people to entitle us to look about on November 4th not at the ashes of defeat, but at the well-planted seeds of hope, which will flower on a great November day in the future.\n\nMan:\n\nThat was Buckley’s role — to keep the factions together, to keep hope alive, to have everyone looking to the future, and also not ever to give up.\n\n[ Bells ringing ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nNow a collegiate hall with an ornate bell tower:\n\nReporter:\n\nWell, here we are in the debating hall of the Cambridge Union for what could prove one of the most exciting debates in the 150 years of the Union history.\n\nOn screen:\n\n1965, Cambridge, England:\n\nReporter:\n\nAny moment now, the president will be leading in his officers and his distinguished guests, and the debate will begin.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nStudent Adrian Vinson:\n\nAdrian:\n\nThe house was absolutely packed. And, of course, it was being televised…\n\nOn screen:\n\nBaldwin vs. Buckley.\n\nAdrian:\n\n…so there was undoubtedly a sense of a special occasion.\n\nMan:\n\nMr. William Buckley has the reputation of possibly being the most articulate conservative in the United States of America.\n\nOn screen:\n\nNick Buccola:\n\nNick:\n\nBuckley is tall and very white and sort of in his proper attire for the debate.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA suit and bow-tie.\n\nNick:\n\nBuckley had been formally debating since the crib, practically, and there he is, in his element. What will this voice of conservatism have to say about race and civil rights?\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe National Review, August 1957.\n\nMan:\n\nA few years earlier, in 1957, National Review publishes an editorial, “Why the South Must Prevail.” Buckley phrases the question, “Is the South justified in keeping its Black citizens from voting and therefore politically controlling the region?” He writes, “The sobering answer is yes. The White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nWhite police push black people away from a building.\n\nMatthew:\n\nIt’s not, perhaps, surprising that Buckley is defending Southern segregationists in National Review.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA white woman and a toddler.\n\nMatthew:\n\nHe was very sympathetic to the South. His mother was a Southerner. They were frequent visitors to South Carolina, where they had a winter home.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA black woman carries a basket.\n\nMatthew:\n\nThere were maids and serving people. That was the reality he grew up with…\n\nOn screen:\n\nA portrait of southern officers over a mantle.\n\nMatthew:\n\n…and he didn’t really question it.\n\nJoshua:\n\nIt is unpleasant to adduce statistics evidencing the cultural superiority of White over Negro, but it is a fact. Reasonable limitations upon the vote are not exclusively the recommendation of tyrants.\n\nOn screen:\n\nWhites and blacks march for voting rights.\n\nMatthew:\n\nOne of the slogans of the civil rights movement in those days was “Freedom Now.” Buckley’s slogan for the civil rights movement would’ve been “Some freedom, one day, when you’re ready.” “You cannot be a full citizen until you’re ready, and we will be the ones in charge of making you ready. And we will tell you when you’re ready.”\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nAt the debate, James Baldwin’s introduction:\n\nReporter:\n\nMr. James Baldwin is hardly in need of introduction. His reputation, both as a novelist and as an advocate of civil rights, is international.\n\nMatthew:\n\nJames Baldwin at that point had become one of the most famous writers in the world.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nWearing a dark suit and tie, he works his way through the crowd to a podium.\n\nMatthew:\n\nHe was really second only to Martin Luther King as a face associated with that phase of the civil rights revolution. So, there he is invited to the world’s oldest debating society to debate this motion, is the American dream at the expense of the American Negro?\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe largely white audience listens intently.\n\nBaldwin:\n\nGood evening. It would seem to me the proposition before the house, when I put it that way, “Is the American dream at the expense of the American Negro?” And that one’s response to that question has to depend in effect on where you find yourself in the world. This means in the case of an American Negro, from the moment you are born, since you don’t know any better, every stick and stone and every face is white, and since you have not yet seen a mirror, you suppose that you are, too. It comes as a great shock around the age of 5 or 6 or 7 to discover the flag to which you have pledged allegiance, along with everybody else, has not pledged allegiance to you.\n\nOn screen:\n\nCambridge Instructor Earl Hopper:\n\nBaldwin:\n\nIt comes as a great shock…\n\nEarl:\n\nI was moved by it. And the people around me were moved by it. Because I could feel his personal pain, which he didn’t hide.\n\nBaldwin:\n\nIsn’t 400 years enough? 400 years, at least three wars. The American soil is full of the corpses of my ancestors. Why is my freedom or my citizenship or my right to live there, how is it conceivably a question now?\n\nEarl:\n\nWhat he said to everybody is, “I personify the pain of my people. And I’m telling you, I am hurt.”\n\nBaldwin:\n\nUntil this moment, there is scarcely any hope for the American dream because the people who are denied participation in it by their very presence will wreck it. And if that happens, it’s a very grave moment for the West. Thank you.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nAs Baldwin takes his seat, the dense crowd of attendees rise from theirs.\n\nReporter:\n\nA moving moment now. The whole of the Union standing. Never seen this happen before.\n\n[ Applause continues ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley, his gaze lowered, slowly moves to his podium.\n\nReporter:\n\nNow we have Mr. William Buckley, who will need all his skill to establish ascendancy over his audience, which has clearly been so deeply moved by the preceding speaker.\n\nBuckley:\n\nThank you, Mr. President. Gentlemen, it is impossible, in my judgment, to deal with the indictment of Mr. Baldwin unless one is prepared to say to him the fact that your skin is black is utterly irrelevant to the arguments that you raise.\n\nMatthew:\n\nBuckley starts out by saying that the greatest insult to James Baldwin is to treat him as a Black person.\n\nBuckley:\n\nI propose to pay him the honor this night of saying to him, “Mr. Baldwin, I am going to speak to you without any reference whatever to those surrounding protections which you are used to in virtue of the fact that you are a Negro.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBaldwin raises his brows as he listens.\n\nMatthew:\n\nAt first you think, “Okay, what is he saying?” Is he saying, “I’m not gonna treat him with the kind of disrespect and indignity that Baldwin has just described in his speech?” No, Buckley’s actually saying Baldwin gets treated with a kind of deference out of a sense of white guilt.\n\nBuckley:\n\nWe have done a great deal to focus on the fact of white discrimination against Negroes. But the other problem is the failure of the Negro community itself. There are a great many schools who are anxious to train Negroes. There are scholarships available to put them through. But, in fact, that particular energy for some reason is not there.\n\nLee:\n\nHe was pulling out the old card of saying, “We’ve done everything we can to make it possible for all people to rise on the basis of their merit, but the Black family just hasn’t got it together.”\n\nBuckley:\n\nWhat, in fact, is it that we Americans ought to do? What are your instructions that I am to take back to the United States, my friend?\n\nEarl:\n\nIt was Buckley who asked the question, “What can we do?” So I stood up and said, “Well, I’ll tell you what you can do.” One thing you might do, Mr. Buckley, is let them vote in Mississippi!\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley nods.\n\nBuckley:\n\nIt is much more complicated, sir, than simply the question of giving them the vote. Booker T. Washington said that the important thing where Negroes are concerned is not that they hold public office, but that they be prepared to hold public office, not that they vote, but that they be prepared to vote. I think actually what I would do is lift the standards of the vote so as to disqualify 65%…\n\nEarl:\n\nBuckley meant that there should be an intellectual aristocracy, which means, for him, an inherited and mostly white aristocracy.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA teen Buckley, wearing a white jacket, bows playfully to two older women.\n\nMatthew:\n\nIt goes back to this idea of the remnant that the Buckley children were taught. I think Buckley always thought of himself as this kind of guardian of a particular conception of Western culture, of American civilization. That runs all the way through his political life as a crucial idea.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley sets his jaw and takes his notes from the podium.\n\nEarl:\n\nI knew that Buckley would lose the debate at that point, because he had showed his true colors.\n\nMan:\n\nHe is an elitist and he’s an anti-democrat.\n\nMan:\n\nVoted in favor of the motion, 544 persons, and against, 164 persons. The motion is therefore carried by 380 votes.\n\nMan:\n\nIt’s an overwhelming victory for Baldwin. Buckley, for the next 40 years, continually took the position that he may have lost the vote, but he did not lose the debate.\n\n[ Clapping, indistinct singing ]\n\nText:\n\nTwo weeks after the debate, violence breaks out on the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn contemporary, black-and-white footage, half of the bridge is packed shoulder to shoulder with marchers.

Pleasure to see you.\n\nCarl:\n\nWhat Buckley would like to do would be to cost Lindsay the election, to drain away enough Republican votes to let the Democrat win.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA campaign poster…\n\nCarl:\n\nSo, what can he do?\n\nOn screen:\n\n…Vote for Buckley.\n\nCarl:\n\nHe decides to run for mayor himself.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nA banner: “Restore responsibility to government.”\n\nReporter:\n\nBeame leads on the opinion polls with a comfortable 45% of the vote. John Lindsay has 35%. And the other 10%, enough to wreck Lindsay’s chances, goes to Buckley.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nHow about Bill Buckley? Do you think there’s any possibility that he might sneak in as a dark horse?\n\nBuckley:\n\nI think it’s a possibility. Technically, it’s possible. If enough people vote for me, I’ll win.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Geoffrey Kabaservice:\n\nGeoffrey:\n\nBill Buckley himself said that he ran half in fun, and that made him hugely appealing to the media, especially.\n\nBuckley:\n\nThank you to the Overseas Press Club. I sometimes wish all the press were overseas.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nSon, Christopher Buckley:\n\nChristopher:\n\nAt the opening press conference, when he announced that he was going to run for mayor of New York, he was asked, “What will you do if you win?” And his response was, “Demand a recount.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nLindsey:\n\nLindsay:\n\nThe candidate of the old-line machine promises not progress, but procrastination, not ideas, but indifference, not energy, but evasiveness.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley, at a podium:\n\nBuckley:\n\nMr. Lindsay says of Mr. Beame that he, “promises not progress, but procrastination, not ideas, but indifference, not energy, but evasiveness.” What is wrong with that sentence?\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nOther than its suicidal search for alliteration?\n\n[ Laughter, applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley glances up with a grin. Editor Richard Brookhiser:\n\nRichard:\n\nWe heard that The New York Times had to keep switching out reporters on the Buckley beat because they’d come to enjoy him too much.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBiographer Sam Tanenhaus:\n\nSam:\n\nThe columnist Pete Hamill said, “This is the first person we’ve ever seen in politics with a genuinely original mind.”\n\nBuckley:\n\nNew York is the ganglion city. And what is about to happen in Los Angeles or Detroit or Cleveland usually has just finished happening in New York. It’s always going to be a pressure point.\n\n[ Indistinct shouting ]\n\n[ Gunshots ]\n\nText:\n\nIn the summer of 1964, Harlem exploded in violence after a 15-year-old boy was shot and killed by police.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn footage, a brightly-lit body lies on the street.

I want the world to see this!\n\n[ Shouting continues ]\n\nBuckley:\n\nRiots, which had quieted down during the dusk, sprang again into full-scale violence this morning.\n\nOn screen:\n\nFlames and smoke pour from a city block of buildings.\n\nBuckley:\n\nBroken glass, bricks, torn-up pavement, looted stores, fires, and incredible destruction. Cars by the dozen were burned. Their occupants were pulled out and beaten.\n\nOn screen:\n\nPolice chase demonstrators.\n\nMatthew:\n\nBuckley instinctively grasped that law and order was another one of the bases on which conservatism could seize the upper hand.\n\nBuckley:\n\nIt is instructive to meditate upon the rise in crime and our apparent acclimation to it.\n\nMatthew:\n\nHe really appealed to the blue-collar people out in the boroughs who increasingly felt looked down upon by the elites and the elite institutions and felt neglected.\n\n[ Telephone rings, indistinct talking ]\n\nRick:\n\nRemember, he thought the conservative movement was going to be filled by the professional class, by the corporate elite. But when he actually goes on the campaign trail, what he sees are police officers. What he sees are the working-class secretaries. Construction workers.\n\nKevin:\n\nThey’re upset about drugs. They’re upset about crime. But what they really hated was being called racist when they would stand up for what they thought were their own interests.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA crowd surrounds Buckley at a microphone.\n\nKevin:\n\nWhen they saw Buckley, they saw themselves.\n\n[ Crowd cheering ]\n\nMatthew:\n\nWhen the votes are counted, Buckley doesn’t win.\n\nBuckley:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the apparent winner of this election is Mr. John Lindsay.\n\n[ Crowd shouting, booing ]\n\nMatthew:\n\nBut he did very well in the outer boroughs of New York, among blue-collar, Catholic, ethnic voters who had long been part of the Democratic Party.\n\nBuckley:\n\nThe conservative party has polled a vote vastly in excess of anything that we thought possible in the most liberal city in the world.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nA headline: Buckley receives 13% of the vote.\n\nSam:\n\nI think it made him recognize that in some ways he didn’t speak for the elite anymore, he spoke for the heartland, the American people, the silent majority.\n\nBuckley:\n\nBy and large, I think that they show more wisdom than their leaders or than their intellectuals. I’ve often been quoted as saying I would rather be governed by the first 2,000 people in the Boston telephone directory than by the 2,000 people on the faculty of Harvard University.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nMatthew:\n\nThis is the beginning of the movement of the white working class into the Republican Party.\n\nOn screen:\n\nMerv Griffin sits at a desk:\n\nPeople:\n\nWe want Buckley! We want Buckley! We want Buckley!\n\nReporter:\n\nWilliam F. Buckley Jr. ran for mayor of New York City a year ago as candidate for the Conservative Party, and in the course of the campaign and since then, Mr. Buckley became quite a television celebrity.\n\nMan:\n\nBuckley’s run for mayor of New York City brought him to a new level of national celebrity.\n\nReporter:\n\nPlease welcome William F. Buckley Jr.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley emerges, one hand stuffed casually into his pocket.\n\nMatthew:\n\nHe was a presence now…\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Matthew Continetti:\n\nMatthew:\n\n…in millions of homes, and his rapier-like wit brought audiences.\n\nAnchor:\n\nIs Mayor Lindsay a better or worse mayor than you expected, Mr. Buckley?\n\nBuckley:\n\nI hadn’t noticed.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nMerv Griffin shakes his head incredulously.\n\nSam:\n\nBuckley thinks, “Alright, I’m good on television. I’m good on the radio. I’m good at writing. I’m good at debate. I can do all these things.”\n\nCarl:\n\n“Yeah, why don’t I do a TV show?”\n\nOn screen:\n\nFiring Line, May 1966:\n\nAnchor:\n\nLook, we’re still — we’re still talking around the subject. The subject is Vietnam as it is. And — And what I want you to say is what you mean by “winning.” And I’ll tell you why we can’t win while we’re fighting a cruel and a very stupid war.\n\nBuckley:\n\nMr. Thomas, it seems to me that this is a science fiction, horror talk. I’d like to point out that in Korea, we did actually stop the aggressor.\n\nThomas:\n\nAlright.\n\nBuckley:\n\nIt cost us many billions of dollars and 100,000 casualties.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAuthor Heather Hendershot:\n\nMan:\n\nAnd in the end…\n\nHeather:\n\n“Firing Line” was conceived as a sort of bare-knuckled intellectual brawl. That was a little crude for Buckley, but that was sort of true.\n\nMan:\n\nLet me go on.\n\nBuckley:\n\nWait a minute. Please don’t —\n\nMan:\n\nDid we or did we not?\n\nBuckley:\n\nPlease don’t proceed as though you have just made a cosmic breakthrough.\n\nOn screen:\n\nRichard Brookhiser:\n\nRichard:\n\nThe “Firing Line” set was very simple. It was a stage. There was a chair for Bill. There was a chair for the guest. If there were two guests, there was a third chair. And that was it.\n\nHeather:\n\nThey had maybe a potted plant, some terrible paintings, all kinds of bad mistakes in their decor in the early days. And you just didn’t care about that.\n\nBuckley:\n\nMy guest tonight is David Susskind, who has probably appeared more hours on television talk shows than anyone in the history of television, which may or may not have something to do with the unhappy state of our universe.\n\nMan:\n\nBuckley’s introductions are just wickedly funny.\n\nBuckley:\n\nIf there were a contest for the title “Mr. Eleanor Roosevelt,” he would unquestionably win it. Mr. Susskind, you are most welcome.\n\nSusskind:\n\nI wonder if I were unwelcome, how you’d introduce me.\n\nHeather:\n\nSome of his introductions were quite harsh with a veneer of politeness over them.\n\nBuckley:\n\nMy guest tonight is regarded as the best writer in America.\n\nOn screen:\n\nNorman Mailer.\n\nBuckley:\n\nHis technique is one of unalloyed narcissism…\n\nMan:\n\nBuckley hated liberalism, but he did not hate liberals.\n\nInterviewee:\n\nThe disease of the right is — is greed, bigotry, insensitivity, and general stupidity, yourself excluded, sir. Sure, I assure you that.\n\nCarl:\n\nIn fact, many prominent liberals, like Norman Mailer, were close friends of his.\n\nHeather:\n\nWhen the guests are properly curated, it’s really riveting.\n\nOn screen:\n\nMay 1968:\n\nBuckley:\n\nIf you keep this up, I’m going to ask you to read more poetry.\n\nGinsberg:\n\nWhy don’t I sing instead?\n\nHeather:\n\nThere was a really good episode when Allen Ginsberg is on, and, you know, he’s got his harmonium with him.\n\nGinsberg:\n\n♪ Hare Krishna ♪\n\nHeather:\n\nAnd at one point he does a sort of Hare Krishna solo, and Buckley just sits for a few minutes, you know, just listens.\n\nGinsberg:\n\n♪ Krishna, Krishna, Krishna ♪\n\n♪ Hare, har-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e ♪\n\nBuckley:\n\nThat was the most unhurried Krishna I ever heard.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nChristopher:\n\nHe would have Noam Chomsky or he would have Huey Newton and William Kunstler, people that he disagreed with profoundly.\n\nOn screen:\n\nJune 1971:\n\nKunstler:\n\nI have never urged a single soul, Bill, to cause one bit of damage that might injure a human being, and you have no example of that.\n\nBuckley:\n\n“You condone arson?” Answer, “Yes.”\n\nKunstler:\n\nUnder certain circumstances. Signed, Kunstler.\n\nBuckley:\n\nSee, the trouble with you is that you get very resentful whenever anybody reminds you of what you say. If I said what you said, I’d feel the same way.\n\nOn screen:\n\nEditor Jay Nordlinger:\n\nJay:\n\nI believe that only one guest would not come on, and that was Bobby Kennedy. Someone asked, “Why won’t Kennedy come on your show?” Bill said, “Why does bologna reject the grinder?”\n\nBuckley:\n\nAs you know so much less than I know about New York politics that I encourage you not to go on.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nTV Journalist Peter Robinson:\n\nPeter:\n\nIt was kind of an intellectual roller-coaster ride. You’d go up, you’d find yourself gripping the rails of your little car, and whoosh! Something would happen so fast…\n\nBuckley:\n\nAs you know, it’s not only I…\n\nPeter:\n\n…that you did not really take it in.\n\nOn screen:\n\nWith Noam Chomsky:\n\nBuckley:\n\n…your theological certitudes and your liberal application of them to every subject in which you touch. So the subject of your own intolerance of other people’s point of view is, I think, itself linguistically interesting.\n\nPeter:\n\nHe would just be operating at a different level but somehow is exhilarating.\n\nBuckley:\n\nThat your muse has been stimulated into Stakhanovite activity.\n\nPeter:\n\nWhat was that word?\n\nBuckley:\n\nYou were talking about micturition. But I never thought I’d hear you utter a word with that many syllables.\n\nMatthew:\n\nHe made you want to be smarter.\n\nCarl:\n\nNow, someone called it a filmed radio show. That so doesn’t understand how “Firing Line” worked, because Bill was the host of this filmed radio show, and the camera couldn’t take its eyes off him.\n\nOn screen:\n\nSam Tanenhaus:\n\nSam:\n\nAnd you see him leaning forward, taking notes. There’s a physical seduction that goes on.\n\nOn screen:\n\nGrinning, Buckley twirls his pen.\n\nMan:\n\nYou could tell if the guest is talking and is making some point that he either finds weak or amusing or, “I’m gonna attack this.” I mean, his eyes might widen.\n\nBuckley:\n\nWhee. Isn’t that exciting?\n\nMatthew:\n\nComics imitated his tongue.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIt sweeps between his teeth.\n\nMatthew:\n\nBut it was really the eyes were the most lively thing.\n\nOn screen:\n\nOn the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, an imitator tilts his head back, looking down his nose. His eyes widen dramatically.\n\nSmothers:\n\nThis is William F. Buckley Jr.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nMan:\n\nI think the great curse of the 20th century, it is thinking in categories rather than thinking.\n\nBuckley:\n\nWell, would you say that there is a curious…\n\nHeather:\n\nIt’s remarkable the faith that Buckley had in the power of a conversation.\n\nOn screen:\n\nJesse Jackson, Margaret Thatcher, Billy Graham\n\nHeather:\n\nInteresting guests would make for interesting conversation, which would make for interesting TV.\n\nMan:\n\n“Firing Line” is devoted to the proposition that interesting people can be interesting…\n\nOn screen:\n\nNixon, Ali, Mother Teresa.\n\nMan:\n\n…through the course of an entire hour. To quote Harold Nicholson, “99 people out of 100 are interesting. And the 100th is interesting because he is the exception.” “Firing Line” primarily was a chance to spread the gospel of William F. Buckley. And it was also, you know, just a great TV show.\n\nOn screen:\n\nOn set, Buckley leans back, grinning.\n\nBuckley:\n\nI’m nowadays very well known. I knew that about three years ago when a letter took only three days to arrive from one end of New York to my office addressed merely to Mr. William Buckley, New York City.\n\nBuckley:\n\nBut two or three weeks ago, a letter took only 12 hours to arrive addressed merely to the insufferable Mr. Buckley, New York City.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Geoffrey Kabaservice:\n\nGeoffrey:\n\nThere does come to be a point where Buckley starts to be recognized on the street.\n\nWoman:\n\nYou’re much better-looking, much younger-looking than on television!\n\nGeoffrey:\n\nThis is a period where he becomes the most visible face of the conservative movement.\n\nAnnouncer:\n\nPlease welcome the Sage of Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nMan:\n\nHe has been described as the brightest star in the conservative firmament.\n\nAnnouncer:\n\nWould you welcome William F. Buckley Jr.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe appears on the cover of Time magazine and on Johny Carson.\n\nKevin:\n\nHe was everywhere. If you weren’t gonna see him on television, you’d open up a newspaper and see him there. You’d see his books in the bookstore. You almost couldn’t escape Bill Buckley.\n\nOn screen:\n\nLaugh-In:\n\nTV Host:\n\nWhy have you finally consented to appear on our show?\n\nBuckley:\n\nBecause your producer promised to fly me out in an airplane with two right wings.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nText:\n\nBuckley’s growing fame caught the eye of television producers preparing to cover the 1968 political conventions.\n\nAnnouncer:\n\nDirect from CBS News convention headquarters…\n\nCarl:\n\nBack then, the political conventions were big television.\n\nOn screen:\n\nCarl. T. Bogus:\n\nCarl:\n\nThey generated enormous audiences. Almost everybody liked CBS or NBC, and poor ABC was lagging.\n\nAnnouncer:\n\nABC News presents…\n\nCarl:\n\nSo, they wanted to goose up interest, and they decided to have a debate between William Buckley from the right and Gore Vidal from the left. Vidal was a famous novelist. He was a Southerner, and he was a homosexual.\n\nTV Host:\n\nThe name Gore Vidal stirs the literary circles. He’s a rather un-American American, cool, sophisticated, who writes about subjects not usually reckoned to go down with the American public.\n\nMatthew:\n\nBuckley knew very well who Gore Vidal was. Gore Vidal had famously written the novel “Myra Breckenridge” about a transsexual. Buckley saw that as a real danger to American civilization and relations between the sexes. But I don’t think he took Gore Vidal seriously as an intellectual.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBiographer Sam Tanenhaus:\n\nSam:\n\nVidal had a very sharp tongue. He was also very used to television.\n\nVidal:\n\nThe nice thing about the United States, it is for sale.\n\nSam:\n\nIn a way, he was a kind of counter-Buckley. He didn’t obey any of the rules, either.\n\nVidal:\n\nThe current commitment to political action throughout the United States is the most hopeful thing that I’ve seen in my lifetime, and it was begun by the race situation in America and has now come to a head with the Vietnamese war and the slow recognition that the United States has become an empire of the most predatory kind.\n\nAnchor:\n\nGood evening from the International Amphitheatre in Chicago. On “Close-up” tonight, commentary and some dissent from our guest commentators, author Gore Vidal and editor William F. Buckley Jr.\n\nSam:\n\nThe convention in Chicago was one of the great traumas in modern American politics. The antiwar movement was huge.\n\nReporter:\n\nProtesters are on the march again today.\n\nSam:\n\nThey’re going to have a big demonstration outside the convention.\n\nReporter:\n\nCarrying a Vietcong flag, more than 500 marched on police headquarters this afternoon to protest…\n\nCarl:\n\nAnd that’s the Chicago that Vidal and Buckley arrived in.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nOur liberal and conservative guest commentators ready to square off. Gore Vidal and William Buckley are next on tonight’s convention…\n\nLee:\n\nI think Gore Vidal was planning and plotting from the very beginning to do what he could to provoke Bill. I don’t know that he thought that he could do it, but he was going to give it his very, very best.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn the studio control room:\n\nMan:\n\nRoll 30. Five, four, three…\n\nOn screen:\n\nAn “ON AIR” light glows red.\n\nMan:\n\n…two, one.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nWould like to ask our guest commentators about Vietnam. How do we get out? Have we really been beaten? Mr. Vidal, will you begin?\n\nVidal:\n\nWhat matters here is that we have, in a word, lost the war. This has cost us $100 billion. There’s 25,000 dead. Something like 90% of the casualties are civilian, so when they accuse us of genocide, they are not without point.\n\nBuckley:\n\nNow, wait a minute.\n\nVidal:\n\nWe have nothing to gain by this war.\n\nBuckley:\n\nNow, wait a minute. We have not lost the war in Vietnam. What we have lost is an opportunity to press that war with such weapons as are especially at our disposal.\n\nOn screen:\n\nLee Edwards:\n\nLee:\n\nBuckley was absolutely convinced that Vietnam was a crucial battle in the Cold War against Communism.\n\nVidal:\n\nDo you favor just an all-out war on Communism using nuclear weapons as you have in the past?\n\nBuckley:\n\nI never said nuclear weapons. I’ll blow them up with poison ivy for all I’m concerned.\n\nOn screen:\n\nSix helicopters fly over wooded hillsides.\n\nSam:\n\nBuckley’s argument is, if we aren’t winning in Vietnam, it is merely because we aren’t fighting the war hard enough. We need more troops, more bombing, more, more, more.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA massive, fiery explosion in a field below.\n\nSam:\n\nHe follows the domino theory — “We can’t let Communists take any country, because that domino will fall and hit the adjacent country and a whole line of dominos will fall.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nGore Vidal:\n\nVidal:\n\nI still don’t see how Mr. Buckley, with his concerted will, thinks that we’re going to win a war that we’ve spent certainly five very aggressive years in losing.\n\nCarl:\n\nHere is Vidal, you know, of the literary fringe coming after him in this way, and Buckley is affronted by that. He doesn’t see how he’s gotten himself in this position.\n\nBuckley:\n\nMr. Vidal, it is a laborious job to straighten out history after you’ve had a couple of sentences go out at it.\n\nKevin:\n\nIf you watch those debates, Vidal was jabbing.\n\nVidal:\n\nHere he sits. Take a good look at the leading warmonger in the United States. Bill, don’t you point your tongue at me now.\n\nKevin:\n\nHe was looking for the exposed nerve.\n\nVidal:\n\nTo be perfectly blunt, I think we’re headed for total disaster, with people like Mr. Buckley here beating the drum.\n\nReporter:\n\n10,000 antiwar demonstrators gathered in Grant Park this afternoon before a planned march on the amphitheater.\n\n[ Crowd shouting ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nPlumes of tear gas rise among the demonstrators.\n\nReporter:\n\nThe police closed ranks and advanced into the crowd, chasing them over seats, clubbing those who resisted.\n\n[ Shouting continues ]\n\n[ Siren wailing ]\n\n[ Crowd chanting “The whole world is watching” ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nPolice wearing light blue helmets charge into a crowded park, kicking and swinging batons. Protesters fall to the ground under the assault. A man and woman hold each other.\n\nAt night on a city street, hundreds of police in rows chase demonstrators. Some officers roughly shove and drag young men into a van.\n\nAn officer strikes repeatedly with his baton. Another runs unto a person, holding his baton like a battering ram.\n\nIn the studio, Buckley holds his chin thoughtfully.\n\nReporter:\n\nWho is first? Mr. Vidal first.\n\nVidal:\n\nWe have the right, according to our constitution, of freedom of assembly. And if you want to hold a meeting for a peaceful purpose to demonstrate, you have that right.\n\nBuckley:\n\nAnybody who believes that these characters are interested in the democratic process is deluding himself. I say it is remarkable that there was as much restraint shown as was shown, for instance, last night by cops who were out there for 17 hours without inflicting a single wound on a single person, even though that kind of disgusting stuff was being thrown at them and at all of American society.\n\nReporter:\n\nMr. Vidal, wasn’t it a provocative act to try to raise the Vietcong flag in the park? Wouldn’t raising a Nazi flag in World War II would’ve had similar consequences?\n\nVidal:\n\nIf it is a novelty in Chicago, that is too bad. But I assume that the point of the American democracy is you can express any point of view you want. Shut up a minute.\n\nBuckley:\n\nNo, I won’t. Some people were pro-Nazi. And I’m for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers. I know you don’t care…\n\nVidal:\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, the only sort of pro- or crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself. Failing that, I will only say…\n\nBuckley:\n\nLet’s not call names.\n\nVidal:\n\n…that we can’t have —\n\nBuckley:\n\nNow, listen, you queer. Stop calling me a crypto-Nazi.\n\nReporter:\n\nLet’s stop calling names.\n\nBuckley:\n\nOr I’ll sock you in the…damn face and you’ll stay plastered.\n\nReporter:\n\nGentleman, let’s — Oh, Bill.\n\nBuckley:\n\nLet the author of “Myra Breckenridge” go back to his pornography and stop making any allusions of Nazism to somebody who was infantry in the last war.\n\nVidal:\n\nYou were not in the infantry, as a matter of fact.\n\n[ Indistinct arguing ]\n\nYou are distorting your own military record.\n\nReporter:\n\nMr. Vidal, wasn’t it a provocative act…\n\nCarl:\n\nIf you pushed the right button, a different Buckley would come out. Somewhere in there is the angry Buckley. And Vidal was able to get to that.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn a still, Buckley leans aggressively toward Vidal.\n\nBill:\n\nMy pulse was racing and my fingers trembled as wave after wave of indignation swept over me.\n\nVidal:\n\nWhat more to say on the subject? I think we’ve seen the passions of Mr. Buckley on this issue, the infantry warrior.\n\nReporter:\n\nI think — I think we’ve run out of time, and I thank you very much for the discussion.\n\nOn screen:\n\nVidal removes the lanyard holding his microphone.\n\nReporter:\n\nIt was a little more heat and a little less light…\n\nBill:\n\nWe had to unharness ourselves from our ear sets. Suddenly, I stopped, frozen. Vidal, arranging his own set, was whispering to me. “Well,” he said smiling, “I guess we gave them their money’s worth tonight.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nEditor Jay Nordlinger:\n\nJay:\n\nI think Bill thought that he had let anger get the better of him and let the side down on live national television. Other people wanted to celebrate it, and he did not.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley strolls along sand dunes.\n\nJay:\n\nLater in his life, I saw this often. People would want to congratulate Bill on this and remember the moment. “It was just great when you really socked it to Vidal.” You’ve never seen someone change the subject so quickly.\n\nText:\n\nFour years later, 1972.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe modernist Watergate hotel, with its curving exterior. Tagged evidence: a duffel bag, pliers, tape, rubber gloves, and a wig.\n\nReporter:\n\nWhat happened at Watergate in the wee hours of June 17, 1972, set off a series of political scandals the likes of which this country never before has known, first up to, then into the White House.\n\nOn screen:\n\nMen in suits and handcuffs are escorted from a building.\n\nSam:\n\nWhen the Watergate break-in occurred, Buckley was torn over Nixon.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Joshua Tait:\n\nJoshua:\n\nBuckley had never liked Nixon. He wasn’t a conservative. He wasn’t a Buckleyite. He didn’t pay homage to National Review, and Watergate added fuel to the fire.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Jennifer Burns:\n\nJennifer:\n\nThere’s a great sense of betrayal. We went along with this guy. He betrayed us on every single level — ideological, practical, political, and now he’s ruined our reputation, and we didn’t even really like him that much.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA sign: Impeach Nixon, Save the GOP.\n\nMan:\n\nBut there was a problem when the stories started appearing. Right away, Buckley recognized a name.\n\nReporter:\n\nHoward Hunt.\n\nReporter:\n\nHoward Hunt Jr., ex-CIA…\n\nOn screen:\n\nSam Tanenhaus:\n\nReporter:\n\n…ex-Bay of Pigs planner…\n\nSam:\n\nHoward Hunt was one of the Watergate burglars. He’d been arrested, and he was also Buckley’s former boss in the 1950s.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHunt walks past a phalanx of press smoking a cigar.\n\nSam:\n\nDuring Watergate, it emerged publicly that Buckley had been in the CIA. It was always very hush-hush.\n\nReporter:\n\nWhat did you do for the CIA?\n\nBuckley:\n\nI was a deep-cover agent stationed in Mexico working for the only man in the CIA I ever met, other than my instructors, who were anonymous, and he was Howard Hunt.\n\n[ Camera shutter clicking ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe smiles broadly. At a hearing, Hunt wears dark glasses.\n\nSam:\n\nThen, just at the time Hunt was being tried, Buckley heard from him.\n\nOn screen:\n\nSon Christopher Buckley:\n\nChristopher:\n\nSo Pop starts getting phone calls from Howard, who is calling from phone booths. So Pop would get up from the dinner table, disappear, then he would come back in looking like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nMan:\n\nBuckley had been given information that made him as well-informed as Woodward and Bernstein, and Buckley didn’t know what to do.\n\nReporter:\n\nYou think the President has been damaged by what’s going on?\n\nBuckley:\n\nOf course he’s been damaged, yes.\n\nReporter:\n\nShould he be made held accountable?\n\nBuckley:\n\nOf course he should be made accountable. Whether that accountability is gonna be legal or purely moral, I don’t know.\n\nMan:\n\nBill Buckley saw the Republicans had to cut themselves loose from Nixon. But somebody has to go first. There has to be somebody who will go ahead of the group and make the statement.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nMr. Buckley, when your brother was running for mayor — Mr. William Buckley — he said if he was elected, the first thing he would do would ask for a recount. What will you do if you’re elected?\n\nJim:\n\nAccept gladly.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nBiographer Sam Tanenhaus:\n\nSam:\n\nBill’s older brother, Jim Buckley, was in the Senate. Buckley pulled Jim aside and said, “Nixon has got to resign. And you are the one who has to go out publicly and say it.”\n\nJim:\n\nThere is one way and one way only by which the country can be pulled out of the Watergate swamp. I propose an extraordinary act of statesmanship and courage. That act is Richard Nixon’s own voluntary resignation as President of the United States.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAboard a sailboat, William Buckley looks through a sextant.\n\nSong:\n\n♪ Quia fecit mihi magna ♪\n\nSam:\n\nThere was a colder, calculating side to Buckley. You know, he was a sailor who calculated when you could put your sail up and when you can’t go out in a storm.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe wears a raincoat as waves and rain whip the boat.\n\nSong:\n\n♪ Quia fecit mihi magna ♪\n\nSam:\n\nHere, he saw Nixon was bad news. They were going down. And he prided himself on not being simply a loyalist. He could say to his brother, “Now, Nixon’s done.” And he was.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA headline: Nixon Resigns; Urges a time of healing. Ford will take office today.\n\n[ Harpsichord playing ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn footage, William Buckley plays a harpsichord. Editor Jay Nordlinger:\n\nJay:\n\nConservatism. The question is, well, what do you want to conserve? Bill wanted to conserve Western civilization, art and music. He cared intensely about music. I think it was probably his favorite thing in life, especially Bach.\n\nOn screen:\n\nWords of William F. Buckley Jr:\n\nBuckley:\n\n300 years ago, on March 21st, Johann Sebastian Bach was born. The event was as though God had decided to clear his throat to remind the world of his existence.\n\nJoshua:\n\nBill’s musicality really came out in his writing. He had a sense of rhythm, of phrasing, and it was basically unconscious and natural. He wanted things to be in balance and rhythm. He was a very musical writer.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe keys of an electric typewriter fly. Buckley types while sitting on a sofa.\n\nMatthew:\n\nBill was the fastest writer I’ve ever known. It was almost as fast as speaking.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe types in the back seat of a car.\n\nChristopher:\n\nI’d often be with him, say, in the car when he’d say, “Oh, I’ve got to write a column.” And he would bang it out on his portable typewriter in about the length of time it took to type.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe types at a conference table.\n\nBuckley:\n\nJournalism has to correspond in the sense of the passion of events. And sometimes fresh journalism is much better and it has much more enduring quality than something which is sort of studied and worked over.\n\nChristopher:\n\nIn the mid-’70s, his editor persuaded him to start writing novels, and he would write spy novels about a character named Blackford Oakes.\n\nDick:\n\nHe has written still another book. I don’t know how he does it. It’s a spy thriller called “Stained Glass.”\n\nCarl:\n\nThe first eight Blackford Oakes novels made it onto the New York Times best-seller list.\n\nDick:\n\nIf he was my guest every time he wrote a book, he would be on several times a year, which would be alright with me.\n\nMan:\n\nIt got to the point where Buckley had to space out the publications of his books so they wouldn’t compete with one another for review attention and sales.\n\nChristopher:\n\nHe would write his books in Switzerland, where they spent winters, and they rented a castle in a town called Rougemont. You know, it was a 10th-century chateau. I mean, there was a dungeon. There were turrets, you know.\n\nMan:\n\nHe would write one of those novels in as few as 12 days. It’s as if he’s exhaling through his fingers, and at the end of the exhalation, the book is finished. It was an almost unstoppable energy.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe skis down a slope.\n\nSam:\n\nBill didn’t want merely to taste life. He wanted to drink it in. He wanted to gulp it. There was so much living to do.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe controls the rudder aboard a yacht.\n\nSam:\n\nYou know, when you’re on the boat, it doesn’t matter how fast you’re moving. You just have to keep moving some way. And that’s what Buckley was like.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley and his young son tend to a sail.\n\nChristopher:\n\nWe sailed across the Atlantic twice. We sailed across the Pacific, too, and these — you know, these are some of my best memories. Sailing with Pop was always an adventure.\n\nOn screen:\n\nDolphins race alongside the boat.\n\nChristopher:\n\nOne time I came up, and we had scheduled a Friday night sail. And it was like 50-mile-an-hour gusts.\n\nOn screen:\n\nWaves crash over a pier.\n\nChristopher:\n\nAnd I stepped off the train, and he said, “We’ll have a brisk sail.” And I looked at him and I said, “We’re going out in this?”\n\nReporter:\n\nMassive power outages reported tonight.\n\nReporter:\n\nAnd we are still in a storm-watch weather alert as we assess the damage across much of New England.\n\nChristopher:\n\nThe next day, 700,000 homes in New England and Long Island were without power.\n\nReporter:\n\nThe heavy rain and winds brought down hundreds of trees, damaging homes and cars.\n\nChristopher:\n\nWe limp back to the house, and Mom comes out and says, “Oh, my God.” She said, “I’ve been on the phone to the Coast Guard all morning.” And they said, “Mrs. Buckley, we don’t understand. What are they doing out there?” Well, I thought, “Good question.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley and a woman with brunette hair sit in a garden.\n\nReporter:\n\nHis wife of 20 years, Patricia Taylor Buckley, is the woman the family thought would finally tame wild young Bill when they got married. But if Buckley is tame, you don’t get that impression from talking to her.\n\nPatricia:\n\nHe’s stimulating. He’s exhausting. He’s fun. Sometimes I could kill him. But not too often.\n\n[ Camera shutter clicking ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn a photo, Patricia wears fur and holds a dog.\n\nMan:\n\nPat Buckley was elegant and brilliant, and nothing was quite good enough.\n\nPatricia:\n\nI spend enormous amount of time screaming and ranting and raving at Bill about 9:00 in the morning. 9:00 in the morning, everything sort of hits me.\n\nGreenfield:\n\nShe, I always thought, was a character out of a Noel Coward play.\n\nOn screen:\n\nTV Journalist Jeff Greenfield:\n\nGreenfield:\n\nI mean, nobody talks that way. Pat would say, “Duckie, are you going to smoke one of those awful Communist cigars?”\n\nPatricia:\n\nAnd Bill said, “Duckie, I adore you, and you’re totally right,” and does whatever he’s about to do.\n\nOn screen:\n\nTV Journalist Peter Robinson:\n\nPeter:\n\nThey annoyed each other intensely and absolutely adored each other. I made some joke to Bill about, what’s the secret to marriage? And Bill said, “Uh, preemptive capitulation.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nShe sits beside him at a piano.\n\nChristopher:\n\nMy mother, my dear, glamorous, chic, and stunning mom, served her time as a galley slave. On those Maine cruises that we’d go on, imagine a 38-foot sailboat, six men, one woman. There’d she be, you know, cooking for us, scrubbing the toilet, and she would mutter darkly, “I was made for better things.”\n\n[ Laughs ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley grins in a tuxedo. Pat wears a black dress trimmed with feathers.\n\nSam:\n\nIt was wonderful to go to a party at the Buckleys’.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley chats with a glamorous couple.\n\nSam:\n\nYou had political figures, yes. You could also meet the king of Greece one night and some writer or singer the next.\n\nOn screen:\n\nLiza Minelli.\n\nJoshua:\n\nI can remember a dinner in San Francisco with Milton Friedman. There were four or five of us around the table. Milton said to the whole table, what was Bill’s greatest attribute? What was his greatest talent? And, of course, somebody said he was an essayist, and somebody else said he was a television personality, and Milton then said, “You’re wrong. You’re all wrong. Bill Buckley’s greatest talent was for friendship.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley hands a book to a guest.\n\nMan:\n\nThere were a thousand private acts no one knows about, acts of generosity, financial, personal, whatever. I would hear about them from time to time. “Bill did this, Bill did that.” Not for show. Not for credit or glory. Bill just loved his friends.\n\nOn screen:\n\nFriends pose at the South pole. Buckley shakes hands with a dignitary.\n\nMatthew:\n\nHe seemed to know everyone.\n\nOn screen:\n\nMatthew Continetti:\n\nMatthew:\n\nBut he had a very close relationship with one politician in particular. And that was Governor Reagan of California.\n\nReagan:\n\nLike myself, many of you have known and been grateful for Bill’s friendship, and like everything else he does, he has made of that, too, an art form.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe two pose together at an event.\n\nMan:\n\nThey had met before Reagan had even entered politics.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA General Electric reel:\n\nReporter:\n\nAt General Electric, here is Ronald Reagan.\n\nReagan:\n\nTwo of the major challenges on this frontier of science are the exploration of outer space and the development of sources of energy.\n\nMatthew:\n\nIn the 1950s, as the host of “General Electric Theater,” Reagan had toured the country giving speeches at GE plants.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAuthor Kevin Schultz:\n\nRick:\n\nOn these long train rides, he would read certain magazines and journals, and one of the magazines that he was given was National Review. Ronald Reagan always credited the pages of National Review with turning him into a conservative.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nAt a convention:\n\nReagan:\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nMatthew:\n\nBut it’s in 1964 where he makes his national political debut. He’s asked to give a speech in support of Goldwater.\n\nReagan:\n\nI have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have seen fit to follow another course. I think it’s time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the Founding Fathers.\n\nMan:\n\nBuckley recognized that Reagan might be somebody who he could work with and maybe even shape into being a prominent, conservative voice in the future.\n\nBuckley:\n\nRonald Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966, perhaps the only successful mutiny against the political script writers in recent times.\n\nChristopher:\n\nPop saw an eager student, if you will, in a very attractive package.\n\nReagan:\n\nYou and I are well aware that in Washington, they nurse the idea that the states should become administrative districts of the federal government.\n\nChristopher:\n\nReagan was a true believer. And so, at a time when, you know, people scoffed at the idea of an actor becoming president, I think Pop saw possibilities.\n\nReporter:\n\nFor millions of Americans, this may be the worst weekend they’ve ever faced for finding gasoline. Shortages are spreading across the country. Gasoline lines and closed gas stations are becoming increasingly common.\n\nGeoffrey:\n\nThere was no doubt that America in the late 1970s felt besieged.\n\nOn screen:\n\nGeoffrey Kabaservice:\n\nGeoffrey:\n\nWe had been through the energy shortage.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBlindfolded hostages are pulled through a crowd.\n\nGeoffrey:\n\nThere was the national humiliation of the Iranian hostage crisis. And Americans felt unsure of themselves.\n\nReagan:\n\nWe need your help in a crusade to change the direction of this country.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nConventioneers rise to their feet.\n\nMan:\n\nAnd at that point, conservatives felt that they had policies that would solve the problems that America was going through.\n\nReagan:\n\nI will not stand by and watch this great country destroy itself under mediocre leadership that drifts from one crisis to the next, eroding our national will…\n\nMan:\n\nConservatives would deregulate the economy and allow capitalism and entrepreneurship to thrive again. And ultimately, they would restore American confidence in itself.\n\nReagan:\n\nI ask you to trust that American spirit, a spirit that flows like a deep and mighty river through the history of our nation…\n\nKevin:\n\nSo, it was all of these things that really combined to make Reagan the right person at the right time.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nNancy Regan rises with the others.\n\nAnnouncer:\n\nFrom early evening, Republicans were already celebrating victory. Mr. Reagan’s triumph had become clear in a race which, nearing its conclusion, was never a race at all.\n\nOn screen:\n\nRegan and Bush wave.\n\nMatthew:\n\nI think that Reagan’s election was validation and vindication of William F. Buckley Jr.’s entire political life.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley and Regan review a document.\n\nJoshua:\n\nTo be a conservative was to always be on the losing side of a political contest. Ronald Reagan made them into winners for the first time on the biggest possible stage. And I think that really gave the conservative movement the feeling that the world actually was theirs.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley accompanies Regan at a podium. Journalist Matthew Sitman:\n\nMan:\n\nThere he is, the president elect.\n\nCrowd:\n\nWe want Reagan!\n\nMatthew:\n\nOf course, winning an election isn’t the same as governing. I think many conservatives would hope it was like the big bang, right? Reagan wins and everything changes. And that didn’t happen. The conservatives got a lot of what they wanted — massive tax cuts, deregulation, fighting against unions.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nRegan with Gorbachev:\n\nMatthew:\n\nBut if you look at later in Reagan’s presidency, when he decides to negotiate with Gorbachev, there are many people in the conservative movement who thought Reagan had lost his mind.\n\nReagan:\n\nMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\n\n[ Cheers and applause ]\n\nKevin:\n\nWithin a few years, though, the Berlin wall fell and the Soviet Union dissolved.\n\nOn screen:\n\nGermans swing sledgehammers at the wall.\n\nKevin:\n\nAmerica, the West, had won the Cold War.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA section falls, revealing East German soldiers on the other side.\n\nKevin:\n\nThere’s no conservative in the country for whom opposition to the Soviet Union was not the animating force of his political life…\n\nOn screen:\n\nTV Journalist Peter Robinson:\n\nKevin:\n\n…his thinking, his feeling. So it took everyone by surprise.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Lee Edwards:\n\nLee:\n\nI guess it’s always difficult after you’ve had a great victory. What do you do for an encore? Where do we go from here?\n\nReagan:\n\nBill Buckley is perhaps the most influential journalist and intellectual in our era. He changed our country, indeed our century.\n\nMan:\n\nWith the end of Communism, the great cause of conservatism had been removed. But for some years, another one had been building, and it’s what we now call “the culture wars.”\n\nWoman:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the man who is the guiding light for conservatives — the Honorable Newt Gingrich.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ]\n\nText:\n\nIn 1994, Republican Congressman Newt Gingrich led a “Republican Revolution,” retaking control of Congress from the Democrats after half a century.\n\nGingrich:\n\nI am a genuine revolutionary. They are the genuine reactionaries. We are going to change their world. They will do anything to stop us.\n\nOn screen:\n\nGeoffrey Kabaservice:\n\nGingrich:\n\nNow, what you got…\n\nMan:\n\nNewt Gingrich believed that Republicans would have to convince people that Democrats were the enemy, not just the opponents.\n\nGingrich:\n\nThey will use any tool. There is no grotesquery, no distortion, no dishonesty too great for them to come after us.\n\nGeoffrrey:\n\nHe teaches Republicans to talk in a new way about Democrats being a source of infection and disease and disloyalty and decay.\n\nOn screen:\n\nSeptember 1994:\n\nGingrich:\n\nBut it tells you something. It tells you something about how out of touch they are with the American people.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ]\n\nMan:\n\nBut there were some who took it to the extreme.\n\nAnnouncer:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, Rush Limbaugh.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nThe obese Limbaugh gestures emphatically as he paces.\n\nLimbaugh:\n\nFeminism was established so that unattractive, ugly broads could have easy access to the mainstream, right? Did you see it? Yes! You saw it!\n\n[ Laughter, applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nLimbaugh appears beside Gingrich on Meet the Press.\n\nCarl:\n\nBuckley did endorse Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh. At some level, he understood that politics requires emotion, as well as intellect, and maybe it requires dark emotions and even hatreds.\n\nOn screen:\n\nLimbaugh on Firing Line:\n\nLimbaugh:\n\nWe’re sending professors now to sensitivity training because they do not use the term “Native American” as opposed to Indian. We’re in this cockamamie idea…\n\nMan:\n\nBuckley didn’t seek power for himself, but he did seek power for the conservative movement. And although he wanted that power to be exercised responsibly, he was actually willing to cover up for a lot of sins of that movement, as well.\n\nBuckley:\n\nThat is fanatical, isn’t it?\n\nLimbaugh:\n\nYes. The attempt to redefine Christopher Columbus as the reason for all evil in the Western world.\n\nMatthew:\n\nThe conservative movement had become a machine that Buckley had helped build but now was beyond his ability to fully control.\n\nOn screen:\n\nJournalist Matthew Sitman:\n\nMatthew:\n\nIt really was a much bigger movement. There was a wide array now of conservative publications and magazines and think tanks and pressure groups. And Buckley wasn’t the pope anymore.\n\nOn screen:\n\nEditor Richard Brookhiser:\n\nRichard:\n\nAnd he reaches a point where he can’t keep it up at the same pace, and so, gradually, he surrenders this, and he surrenders that.\n\nText:\n\nIn 1990, Buckley retired as Editor of National Review.\n\nLee:\n\nI think everyone sensed that an era had come to an end. As JFK said in a certain famous speech, “The baton was passed to a new generation.”\n\nText:\n\nIn 1999, Buckley signed off on his last Firing Line program, after 33 years and more than fifteen-hundred episodes.\n\nBuckley:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please bear in mind all I’ve said and recommended in the last 30 years. Tell your children and your neighbors all those good things, say your prayers, stay healthy, and thanks for sticking with “Firing Line” all this time.\n\n[ Camera shutter clicking ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nOn set, he autographs a book.\n\nMatthew:\n\nAll of media was changing. There were 24/7 news channels, and then there’s social media, and that places a premium on clicks and on attention and on grabbing it.\n\nOn screen:\n\nLimbaugh on CNN:\n\nMan:\n\nWhat does that poll tell you?\n\nMan:\n\nSome of the best ways to do that is anger and vituperation.\n\nLimbaugh:\n\nBill Clinton is the worst thing to happen to the Democratic Party in 60 years.\n\nIt’s offending people!\n\nMan:\n\nYou offend people every day. Should you go to jail?\n\nLimbaugh:\n\nI don’t think I do offend people every day.\n\nOn screen:\n\nClips of politicians and pundits fill the screen.\n\nText:\n\nIn 2007, after a long illness, Patricia Buckley died.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn a photo, the couple sit together with their dogs.\n\nGermond:\n\nI mean, for the Democrats, this was, “Turn on the lights, the party’s over,” you know? This was a disaster at all levels.\n\n[ Overlapping talking ]\n\nChristopher:\n\nMom kept falling down. She had very brittle bones and started falling and breaking bones, and she finally just said, “Enough,” and, in the manner of Victorian ladies, took to her bed and never got out.\n\nOn screen:\n\nPat sits by the piano as her husband plays and sings.\n\nChristopher:\n\nWhen she died, he was destroyed. You’ve never seen someone weep at a funeral the way Bill just sobbed at Pat’s funeral.\n\nOn screen:\n\nTogether, they wear masks at a gala; walk in a garden; and relax in the sun on a sailboat.\n\nChristopher:\n\nHe pretty much lost his reason for living.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThey pose with a swordfish.\n\nChristopher:\n\nOf course, he had emphysema, and so he was under a death sentence, but the joy of life went out.\n\nReporter:\n\nAny regrets about this life that you have lived?\n\nOn screen:\n\nAn elderly Buckley sits with Charlie Rose.\n\nBuckley:\n\nYeah.\n\nReporter:\n\nLike what?\n\nBuckley:\n\nWell, I’m not sure I’ll tell you.\n\nChristopher:\n\nCharlie called me. He said, “What should I — What should I ask your dad? What’s left to ask William F. Buckley?” And I said, “Ask him if he wants to die.”\n\nReporter:\n\nDo you wish you were 20?\n\nBuckley:\n\nNo, absolutely not. No, I would — I would — If I had a pill that would reduce my age by 25 years, I wouldn’t take it.\n\nReporter:\n\nWhy not?\n\nBuckley:\n\nBecause I’m tired of life.\n\nReporter:\n\nAre you really?\n\nBuckley:\n\nYeah. I really am. I’m utterly prepared to stop living on.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn sepia-toned footage, a girl plops her hat onto a teenaged Buckley.\n\nChristopher:\n\nThe truths of Catholicism as he would have seen them were presented to him when he was a child.\n\nOn screen:\n\nBuckley and his siblings eat watermelon.\n\nChristopher:\n\nTo him, it was just a given all his life.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe waves from a porch.\n\nChristopher:\n\nI think in Bill’s case, it made him impatient for death. He saw this world as limited and fallen, and he truly, implicitly believed in the next world.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe jumps a horse over hurdles.\n\nChristopher:\n\nAnd if that’s the case, there’s almost a little bit of, “Let’s get on with this.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nNow as an older man.\n\nChristopher:\n\nHe was tired. He had nothing left to prove. He could barely breathe. He could barely move. His wife was dead. He wanted to be united with her in heaven.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHe sits in a cluttered study.\n\nChristopher:\n\nOne of the last times I was with him was in his study. He felt lousy, but, by God, he was going to finish this book on Barry Goldwater. At 9:30 in the morning, I got the call that he had collapsed and died.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHistorian Lee Edwards:\n\nLee:\n\nHe died at his typewriter. Literally, at his typewriter, still trying to get out a conservative point of view.\n\nOn screen:\n\nApril 4, 2008, in a cathedral:\n\nMan:\n\nWe talked about this day, he and I, a few years ago. He said to me, “If I’m still famous, try to convince the Cardinal to do the service at St. Patrick’s. If I’m not, just tuck me away in Stamford.”\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nWell, Pop, I guess you’re still famous.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn his younger days, Buckley escorts two women at an event. They wear “Buckley for Mayor” sashes.\n\nSam:\n\nMore than anyone else, I think, Bill Buckley’s life and works help us understand how we got here.\n\nOn screen:\n\nOn a tarmac with Joe McCarthy.\n\nSam:\n\nYou can look at a lot of other people, and they’ll give you some of it.\n\nOn screen:\n\nWith Nixon, then Regan.\n\nSam:\n\nBut Buckley, I think, personifies all those contradictions and tensions that are always bubbling up and that have never been so vividly present as they are now.\n\nOn screen:\n\nDonald Trump:\n\nTrump:\n\nThe Democrats’ shameful conduct has created an angry majority, and that’s what we are. We’re a majority and we’re angry.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ]\n\n[ Camera shutter clicking ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nPolice handcuff a rally protester. A woman’s t-shirt reads, “Talking to you reminds me to clean my gun.” A machine gun image is superimposed on a confederate flag, which waves beside a Trump flag.\n\nMatthew:\n\nThroughout his life, Buckley had tried to balance the better angels of his nature and the conservative movement’s nature while also tolerating and sometimes even encouraging some of the nastier, more extreme aspects on the right.\n\n[ Crowd cheering ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nPeople in red hats wave Trump and American flags.\n\nMatthew:\n\nBut, by the end, it was clear that the nastier forces had won out.\n\nOn screen:\n\nTrump’s inauguration:\n\nTrump:\n\nBecause you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\n\n[ Crowd cheering ]\n\nAnd we fight.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA flag depicts Trump as Rambo.\n\nTrump:\n\nWe fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not gonna have a country anymore.\n\n[ Crowd cheering ]\n\nOn screen:\n\nThousands of Trump supporters carry flags as they march toward the US Capitol building.\n\nJoshua:\n\nWhat people, particularly in the Trump years, have come to realize more clearly is that there always was a dark side to the conservative movement.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThey throw barriers at capitol police.\n\nJoshua:\n\nThat it got a lot of its energy from a sense by many white Americans that the country was changing in ways they didn’t like.\n\nOn screen:\n\nSomeone sprays green mist at the police. In photos, a man in a suit attempts to block an entrance. In another, demonstrators surge into the capitol.\n\nJoshua:\n\nBuckley understood that it was part of his role to keep a lid on the dark energies that fueled the conservative movement but not to repress them entirely, because it was those kind of resentments that he was drawing on that gave conservatism its power as a movement.\n\nOn screen:\n\nClouds of gas waft over Trump supporters on the capital steps and balconies.\n\nChristopher:\n\nI’ve been asked a thousand times, “What would your father have made of Donald Trump?” Well, look, he’s left us 50 books, 1,500 episodes of “Firing Lin"
