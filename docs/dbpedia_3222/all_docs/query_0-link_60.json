Alabama. He resided in Sussex County, Delaware and is listed in the New York Herald's November 1862 article as \"colored\", listed on the 1850 census with his parents and siblings as \"black\", and listed on the 1860 census as \"a black servant\" (see links below). David served onboard the C.S.S. Alabama as a full-fledged member of the crew and received a full seaman's pay as a mess steward. David came to be upon the Alabama after the vessel he was employed on, the Tonawanda, was captured on the date October 9, 1862 by the Alabama. David was listed as an assistant in the galley, and within the New York Herald article is mentioned as an apprentice, and under under the laws of the state of Delaware of that time, would have been freed when of age 21, thus when captured by the Alabama, David was taken on board as contraband by articles of war of the time (because David did not have free papers) and was eventually freed by Raphael Semmes and was then employed by the Alabama. Two crewmen were also enlisted from the captured Tonawanda, an ordinary seaman, William Halford, and David White, the 17-year-old slave (as noted by the Alabama). The Tonawanda, navigated by its captain, Theodore Julius, was in route from Philadelphia to Liverpool, England.\n\nOn the Alabama, David became a popular wardroom mess steward, as well as a paid crew member of the ship; David White repaid this action with faithful service. Upon word of Lincoln's emancipation and while in port in Australia, David refused to return to Delaware against the wishes of Federal loyalist. David, who could not swim, went down with the ship after the battle with the U.S.S. Kearsarge near Cherbourg, France, on Sunday the 19th of June, 1864. It is unsure whether David was a slave, an indentured servant, or a Nanticoke Indian. The Nanticoke Indians were not supposed to have been left on Delmarva, were not recognized until later in the 1900's as having existed on the shore, and were supposed to all have been transferred westward on the infamous \"Trail of Tears\". In this case, looking at the censuses, all Nanticoke Indians would have been enumerated as \"black\" or \"mulatto\", therefore, seeing as David is listed with his entire family on the 1850 census, would lend that this was a free family (or at least not a slave family). Also, on the 1860 census, David is listed in the Lewestown hotel (enumerated in Millsboro, Delaware) as a servant and possibly looking for work; somehow the hotel used these servants as hired hands, thus how David came to be on the Tonawanda. Also of note, on the 1850 census of Edward Watson, the listed hotel keeper in Lewestown, is a Jane Wright (age 22, black female, born in Sussex County, Delaware). It is noted that the Wright surname is also of Nanticoke Indian heritage. Along with that of the captain of the Wavecrest (which was in route from New York to Cardiff), John E. Harmon (of Frankfort, Delaware), who was previously captured by the Alabama, it is therefore possible that David White, listed as \"colored\", was neither black nor slave, but Nanticoke Indian (the Nanticoke Indians of the time would not have had free papers, as they were residing in Sussex County (namely Millsboro area) and would not have legally \"existed\"). Ongoing research may prove or disprove this theory.\n\nReference: \"Delaware Civil War Centennial\" dated 1964,\n\n\"Service Afloat\", by Raphael Semmes,\n\nand \"Two Years on the Alabama\", Page 35 & 252, By: Lt.
