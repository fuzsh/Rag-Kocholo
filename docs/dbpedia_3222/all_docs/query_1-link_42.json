        "text": "Ricky Allen was born on February 3, 1987. He grew up in Newton, North Carolina, and graduated from Newton Conover High School. He loved to be outdoors, and he had a God-given talent of playing drums. He began playing at age three, not even able to reach the kick drum pedal. He was self-taught and enjoyed playing in the band while in high school and for his church as an adult. He was often found using his fingertips to beat on whatever hard surface he could find at the moment!\n\nRicky followed in his grandfather’s footsteps and became a junior firefighter for Conover Fire Department at age 17. He dedicated the next 19 years of his life to Conover Fire Department, ending his career as Fire Engineer II. He also served on the Taylorsville Fire Department for the last year of his life.\n\nRicky, like many other firefighters, put in countless hours of continuing education and held many certifications, including North Carolina certifications in Firefighter I & II, EMT, Technical Rescue, and specialties in water, structural collapse, trench, and hazardous materials. Ricky was well respected by his peers; some of the words they used to describe him were resilient, meticulous, friend, dedicated, steadfast, faithful, and loyal. He was quite the prankster and kept his crew laughing. His smile was just about as big as his heart.\n\nRicky was a devoted family man, leaving behind his wife of 11 years, Nicole, and two beautiful daughters, Sophia and Ellie. Ricky took pride in being the best husband and father he could be to “his girls.” He was steadfast in his faith and led his family with strength, grace, and humility. He was always the one who grounded our family and reminded us to count our blessings and to thank God for everything we have. He was the best brother and uncle, always the fun one. Just as he lit up the room at the station with his snarky comments and humor, he would have our homes echoing with laughter at each family gathering.\n\nEverything Ricky did was done well, with pride and with meticulous attention to detail. He was the best car detailer around! He was very active and always doing something. If not for his family, he was doing for others. He had a true servant’s heart.\n\nThere is a massive void left in our hearts and in our homes, as we miss Ricky so terribly. We are grateful for salvation and the promise that we will see him again one day. We carry his memory with us in everything we do, and we are often reminded of his presence this side of Heaven, as the sky is painted with breathtaking sunsets and the stars seem to shine a bit brighter above us."
