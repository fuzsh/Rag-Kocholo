        "text": "WEATHER UPDATE: DUE TO SAFETY AND POWER CONCERNS PLEASE USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT WHETHER OR NOT TO ATTEND BILL'S FUNERAL TODAY AT WAITT FUNERAL HOME AT 10.30 AM NOT AT CHURCH...William F. \"Bill\" Allen, 56, of Quincy MA, formerly of Brockton MA, passed away on October 18, 2021 at Massachusetts General Hospital after a brief illness. Born in New York, Bill was raised in Brockton on Taft Avenue. Bill was the son of the late Ronald and Dolores (Kramer) Allen of Brockton and the beloved brother of the late Douglas “Doug” Allen. Bill is the dearly loved brother-in-law to Michelle Greene-Allen of Brockton; beloved uncle of Ashley Greene-Allen of Easton, Casey Mills of Taunton and Justin Allen of Nashville, TN.\n\nBill graduated from Brockton High School in 1983. In high school, Bill excelled in both academics and athletics. He was a member of the National Honor Society and captained the Brockton High School varsity ice hockey team. After high school, he earned a bachelor’s degree from Babson College in Wellesley, MA. He then went on to work for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a Senior Accountant. For the last 20-plus years, Bill has worked at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) as a Systems Manager and more recently for Mass General Brigham (MGB) as a Senior Systems Analyst.\n\nIn addition to his love of hockey, Bill was an avid golfer. At a young age, Bill caddied at Thorny Lea G.C. in Brockton where he would eventually become a member. He also enjoyed playing golf at area courses and was a regular at D.W. Field Golf Course in Brockton and Granite Links in Quincy. Bill especially enjoyed playing golf with his nephews as well as running his annual tournament in memory of his brother Doug. When not on the golf course, Bill enjoyed traveling with friends to warmer climes or visiting old Brockton buddies who now live-in other regions of the country. During the summer months, Bill was a fixture in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, where he could be found soaking up the sun-and-surf with friends on Reggio Ave or in front of the Brunswick aka “the swick”. He also enjoyed Bruins games with his niece and nephews with a must have stop at Regina’s in the North End. Bill will be remembered always by his extended family and his many close and cherished friends.\n\nAll are welcome to calling hours on Tuesday, October 26th from 4-7 p.m. at the Waitt Funeral Home, 850 North Main St. Brockton.
