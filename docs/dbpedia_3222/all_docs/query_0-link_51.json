Waples\n\nOBITUARY.\n\nOne of our oldest citizens, Capt. John B. Waples, suddenly died at his residence in this town, on Sunday afternoon the 31st of January last. He was born in Dagsboro Hundred, in this County, on the 14th day of September, 1803, and was consequently at the time of his death, 60 years, 4 months and 17 days of age. His family is among the oldest in our County. In the earlier part of his life he was engaged in the coasting trade from Norfolk to Philadelphia and New York, and made most of his money at that time. He left a very large estate. He was a resident of this place for about 20 years and during that time maintained an irreproachable character; was universally regarded as an honest man, a good neighbor, and a true friend. From the very beginning of this rebellion he was unfalteringly attached to his Government and opposed to Secession, He was a Union man under all circumstances and upon all occasions, and never allowed any one in his presence to speak ill of the Union without condemning him. Now that he is gone no one can even whisper suspicion of his loyalty or derogate the slightest from his absolute devotion to his country and her cause. So long as the recollection of these times will last the memory of John B. Waples will not be forgotten among the friends of the Union in this County. He was of service to our cause, and was always to be relied upon. No one doubted him, no one could misunderstand him; always frank, he spoke his mind boldly and without hesitation; his friends esteemed him, and his enemies yielded him respect. He is gone, and we shall miss him, for he was a friend to his County, to his State and to the Union.\n\n[Source: The Union (Georgetown DE) Feb. 12, 1864; tr. by mkk] Samuel Waples\n\nAnother Revolutionary Patriot gone!! - Died, at his residence in Accomack County, Va., on the 11th ult. in the 84th year of his age, Capt. SAMUEL WAPLES, a native of Sussex County, Delaware. Capt. Waples entered the army of the United States in the Revolutionary War, as a Lieutenant in the 9th Virginia Regiment on continental establishment, and marched from the County of Accomack with his Regiment the latter part of the year 1776. He was in the battles at Brandywine and Germantown, in the latter of which he was taken prisoner, and confined in the common jail of the city of Philadelphia, where he suffered many privations, being kept for three days and nights without any kind of subsistence. A short time afterwards he effected his escape from prison, in open day, disguised as a Quaker. After remaining a day or two secreted by a widow Jones, with whom he boarded when an apprentice in Philadelphia, he found means, with the aid of Mrs. Jones, to pass the British sentinels, disguised as a miller, under promise of furnishing provender for the horses of some of the Cavalry Officers. After suffering every hardship incident to his situation, he reached the American Army at Valley Forge, and was thence sent home on the recruiting service. Captain Waples served to the end of the war, with an unsullied character as a gentleman, a brave officer, and a firm and undeviating patriot. After the close of the war, he settled in the County of Accomack, where he lived to a good old age, honored and respected by all who knew him, as well for his honesty and integrity, as for his revolutionary services.\n\n[American - New York, New York, Wednesday, September 3, 1834] tr. by mkk\n\nCharles P.

Windsor, proprietor of the Windsor Hotel, Milford, was laid out in the hotel parlors this evening, and the hostelry was closed. Mr. Windsor had lingered until 3 o'clock this afternoon with a gaping gunshot wound in his left breast, but although he made a hard fight for life from 7 o'clock last evening there was no hope from the moment the shot was fired. Meantime young Edward Windsor, the son who fired the fatal shot with the unquestionable intent of doing away with his father or of dire revenge, is still at large and it is even said that he is in the town to-night and in the hotel where he last night perpetrated the awful deed.\n\nThomas B. Windsor, the dead man, was about 54 years of age, and was the sheriff of Sussex county during the famous Collingwood P. Hallett case, when Hallett was convicted of the murder of James Deputy, and was sentenced to be hanged, but succeeded in making his escape and forever eluding the officers. Subsequently Sheriff Windsor moved to Milford, establishing the Windsor Hotel, and with the assistance of an economical and refined family, succeeded in acquiring about $30,000 or $40,000. The son, Edward, however, acquired a taste for liquor and while a bright and promising young man when sober, is said to be utterly unmanageable when drinking.\n\nTROUBLE OVER A TEAM.\n\nThere was a big Fourth of July celebration yesterday at Slaughter Beach and early in the evening eighteen colored men came to Edward Windsor and offered him $8 to drive them to the beach, only a short distance from Milford. Windsor, Senior seemed to understand the transaction and drinks were handed around lively in honor of the glorious Fourth. After a while the elder Windsor seemed to change his mind about letting the horses go out and ordered the hostler to put them back in the stable.\n\nEdward hurried into the bar room and demanded an explanation of his father. Bystanders knew trouble was brewing and when they saw Edward leave and go toward the kitchen they crept out of the saloon. Presently Edward returned with a shotgun, into which he leisurely loaded two shells of medium shot crying out: \"Tom Windsor, you have kept me out of my living and I am going to blow you full of holes.\"\n\nREACHED FOR HIS GUN.\n\nThe elder Windsor, who was also a fearless man, reached across the bar and grabbed for the gun barrel. He was too late, for the shot blew his arm almost off below the elbow and passed into his body below the left shoulder, a buckle warding off the discharge from the heart and saving instant death. Young Windsor hurriedly left the saloon and the wounded man, with great nerve force, walked steadily out of the room and sank in a chair in from. From there he was taken to his room, where he began the battle against certain death. He commenced sinking at 6 o'clock this morning and sent for the Justice of the Peace and Notary Public to come to take his will.\n\nAll along the wounded man was perfectly conscious and knew that death must come. Notary Public Phillip L. Graham and Charles G. Fisher arrived at his bedside, where he, with great deliberation dictated the disposition of his property, leaving one-third to his wife and the rest due of the estate to his seven children, barring out his assassin.\n\nMr. Windsor loved his children. Even when he stood face to face with death fatherly affection overcame his mental anguish long enough for him to have the notary and the witness take an ante-mortem statement, in order to ease up the blame that must necessarily attach to his son. He was even too weak to sign a statement, but was cool headed enough to have them write three affidavits before he was satisfied with the phraseology. Here is the oath he finally took.\n\nDYING MAN'S STATEMENT.\n\nState of Delaware, Sussex county. S. S.\n\nPersonally appeared before me, Phillip L. Graham, notary public for the State of Delaware, the subscriber, Thomas B.

Edward Windsor did not intend to do him bodily harm and that deponent himself had hold of the gun when it was discharged.\n\n(Signed) THOMAS B.

In the meantime Attorney General Ward will probably detail detectives to hunt up and apprehend young Windsor. A very remarkable coincidence connected with the day's crime is that fifty years ago Mr. Windsor's mother was killed and he, then an infant was found playing beside her dead body. The husband was arrested and accused of the crime, but was subsequently released on the plea of insanity.\n\n[Philadelphia Inquirer (Philadelphia, PA) Saturday, July 6, 1901] tr. by mkk\n\nHarry J.

Wright\n\nWELL KNOWN DOCTOR DEAD\n\nDr. W. T. Wright Died Tuesday Morning at Ute After Two Weeks' Illness - Family at Bedside\n\nDEATH CAUSES MUCH SORROW\n\nFuneral Services to be Held Thursday Afternoon at Episcopal Church - Burial in Oakland Cemetery\n\nA deep gloom was cast over the entire community yesterday when word was received here that Dr. W. T. Wright had passed away early that morning at the home of his brother-in-law, Frank L. Brigham, at Ute. The immediate cause of his death was due to pneumonia, which followed a severe attack of the influenza. His three daughters Winifred, Alma and Edna, and brother, Alfred Wright, were at his bedside at the time of his death.\n\nEarly in December Dr. Wright contracted the influenza, but as his case seemed to be in a mild form he continued to be up and around, calling on his patients. Owing to the epidemic and the many sick people he no doubt overtaxed himself making trips night and day, administering to the sick. December 5th he got up out of the sick bed to go to Ute to administer to his brother-in-law, Frank L. Brigham, who was stricken with the influenza and who died just a few hours after his arrival at Ute. Dr. Wright was in such condition upon his arrival at Ute that he went to bed and from day to day his condition grew worse. Last Saturday pneumonia developed and although he had the best of medical attention and a trained nurse to care for him, his condition was so weakened that he was unable to withstand the disease and he passed peacefully away at 1:00 o'clock Tuesday morning.\n\nDr. William T. Wright was born at Lewes, Delaware, Sept. 1, 1856, a son of William and Rachel Weld (Smith) Wright, both of whom were natives of London, England. He came with his parents to Waverly, Iowa, at the age of nine years and was reared there and in Nashua and Denison. He attended the public schools and the academy in Bradford, later entering Kenyon college, from which he was graduated in 1878 with the degree of A. B. He then taught school for one year, in Crawford county, after which he matriculated in the medical department of the University of Michigan, at Attn Arbor, graduating in 1882 With the degree of M. D. He began practice in Denison, but afterwards practiced one year at Ute and six years at Vail, then returning to Denison, where he achieved more than the ordinary measure of success. For twenty-eight years Dr. Wright engaged in practice at Denison and in the time named few men have been more closely identified with the progress of the city. He acquired an enviable reputation and was one of the leading practitioners of the state.\n\nOn the 22d of October, 1891, Dr. Wright was united in marriage to Miss Florence M. Brigham, a native of Boston, Mass. The wife departed this life two years ago. Three children were born to Dr. and Mrs. Wright, namely: Winifred Weld, Alma Lucile and Alice Edna, all of whom are left to mourn the death of their father. Two brothers survive, Leighton and Alfred, both residents of Denison.\n\nDr. Wright was a member of the Episcopal church and for a number of years served as vestryman. Fraternally he was connected with the Knights of Pythias and the Modern Woodmen of America, also holding membership in the Phi Beta Kappa and Beta Theta Pi college fraternities. In politics he adhered to the republican party and was an active, worker in behalf of his party. He was coroner of Monona county in 1889 and county superintendent of the schools of Crawford in 1896. For one year he filled the office of chairman of the county republican central committee, discharging his duties with an ability that met with the approval of the members of the committee.\n\nIn the death of Dr. Wright, Denison has lost one of its foremost citizens. He was earnest, energetic and competent in whatever he undertook, and represented in his profession and his life the highest ideals. Dr. Wright was appointed a member of the local exemption board after the outbreak of the war and devoted a considerable portion of his time to the duties of this office, although it did not interfere to a great extent with his practice. He, however, appreciated the responsibility of the office and worked faithfully and diligently, doing the part assigned to him in helping to win the war. No man Denison occupied a more honorable place in the estimation of the people than did Dr. William T. Wright.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Thursday afternoon at the Episcopal church in Denison, Rev. Williams, the rector, officiating, after which interment will be made in the family pilot in Oakland cemetery.\n\nThe Review joins with the many friends in extending Heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved daughters and brothers in this, their hour of sorrow.\n\n[Source: The Denison Review (IA) Dec. 18, 1918; tr. by mkk]\n\ntr. by mkk - Transcribed by Mary Kay Krogman"
