Mr. McIntire was found on the night of the occurrence in an insensible condition in 4th street, near West, his skull being badly fractured. He was conveyed to the hospital on a stretcher, and died on Wednesday last. The evidence of Mr. Brockman, the principal witness, is substantially as follows:\n\nEarly in the evening McIntire and a friend named Clayton, came into my house to obtain something to drink; presently Wood came in intoxicated and demanded liquor, I refused him, telling him I did not sell to soldiers; he became noisy and insolent, and swore he would have it, at the same time loading his revolver; he then said he would shoot me if I did not give it to him; told him I would no; he remarked \"the I will come round the counter and take it;\" I replied \"I guess not.\" McIntire, who was standing near, remarked to Wood, \"We are both soldiers; you had better put that revolver away, you might shoot some one with it, and then you will be sorry for it;\" Wood, exclaimed with an oath \"what have you got to do with it?\" and struck him a severe blow over the head with the weapon; McIntire staggered and fell with his head on the county, when Wood struck him again, and attempted to strike a third blow, when the pistol was wrested from him. The parties afterwards went out; I endeavored to find McIntire, knowing he was badly injured, but failed.\n\nThe wounds were examined at the hospital by the physician in attendance, who stated that the blows inflicted on the head of McIntire had fractured his skull, and was the cause of death. The jury rendered a verdict in accordance with the above facts. Wood departed with his regiment on Monday, and we presume as soon as the facts are communicated to headquarters he will be surrendered to the cival authorities. - Republican.\n\n[Source: The Union (Georgetown DE) Dec. 4, 1863; tr. by mkk]\n\nMrs. J.

He had long been known for his eloquence and power, in exhortation and prayer. And the grace by which he was saved and sanctified, gave him triumph in the last hour.
