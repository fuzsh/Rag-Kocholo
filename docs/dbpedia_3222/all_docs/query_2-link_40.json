        "text": "Submitted by his wife\n\nWilliam F. Ramsey was a family man‚ business man‚ friend to many and firefighter. On September 9‚ 2003‚ after responding to a fire call‚ Bill became ill and later that evening passed away. He is greatly missed by his devoted family and brother firefighters. Although Bill is no longer with us‚ his memory and the lessons he taught us will remain with us forever.\n\nBill was a four-year member of the Connellsville Township Volunteer Fire Department and at the time of his death‚ was serving as the department’s Financial Secretary. During his short tenure with the department‚ Bill touched every member in his own special way. Bill was wonderful at telling stories and he generally had 2 or 3 ready to be told‚ ready to bring laughter into our day. Bill was always ready to take on any project that would come his way. Bill was a great liaison between the fire department and the businesses and community we serve. Bill was also an active member of the Fayette County HAZMAT Team.\n\nBill’s service to his community did not stop with the Connellsville Township Volunteer Fire Department. He was the co-owner of the Kentucky Fried Chicken in Connellsville‚ along with his mother Barbara Ramsey. He was also an active member of numerous fraternal organizations including King Solomon’s Lodge #346 F&AM‚ Uniontown Lodge of Perfection‚ Consistory Valley of Pittsburgh‚ Syria Shrine‚ Eastern Star and the Connellsville B.P.O.E. #503. Bill realized the importance of giving back to a community that had been so giving to him‚ and through his participation in these organizations was able to do so.\n\nBill was above all a family man. Bill was greatly devoted to his wife Rita and their young daughter Annabeth. He talked affectionately about Rita and Annabeth around the firehouse‚ and never missed an opportunity to include them in department functions. Rita is a member of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Connellsville Township Volunteer Fire Department and she and Annabeth regularly attend company events.\n\nTo keep Bill’s memory alive‚ Connellsville Township Volunteer Fire Department has established the ‘William F. Ramsey Memorial Scholarship.’ This scholarship is presented annually to a graduating high school senior who will be furthering their education in the field of emergency services or nursing. This past June with great pride‚ the first scholarship was presented.\n\nBill never thought of himself as anything but the ‘common’ man doing what he believed he needed to do. He never wanted to be in the spotlight‚ he just wanted to ensure that things got completed and to revel in the enjoyment others received from it. Forever forward‚ Bill will be the spotlight of each and every member of the Connellsville Township Volunteer Fire Department‚ he has raised the bar of expectation for each of us. Bill will forever remain in the hearts and minds of those who knew and served with him."
