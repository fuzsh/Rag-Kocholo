        "text": "The only officer to ever lose his life serving Lewes, Charles W. Futcher, can be remembered even by passing strangers thanks to a plaque in a shady patch of Zwaanendael Park and the tireless work of his granddaughter.\n\nFutcher died Aug. 19, 1939, as the result of injuries suffered from a crash during a high-speed car chase. A celebration Monday honored Futcher with the unveiling of a plaque in his honor, but also highlighted the challenges all survivors of deceased officers face.\n\n\"While Officer Futcher is the only Lewes police officer who has lost his life while serving this community, we should remember that other communities across this country have not had the same experience,\" said Mayor Ted Becker.\n\nSince the first line-of-duty death recorded in 1791 more than 20,000 officers have died nationwide, Becker said. Recently, that number has spiked, Becker said, rising to about 150 officers each year.\n\n\"In a community even as beautiful and tranquil as Lewes, our officers place themselves at risk everyday,\" Becker said.\n\nRegional politicians also came to speak at the ceremony.\n\n\"The need for these types of services sadly will never go away,\" said Rep. Peter Schwartzkopf. \"On the other hand, it should never go away because the family's of fallen officers need support from all of us.\"\n\nSchwartzkopf said while it may have taken Futcher 75 years to be recognized with a plaque, in police work, those who have died are never forgotten. The representative served as an officer with the Delaware State Police for 25 years. In his tenure as captain, he dreaded the day he would need to knock on a loved one's door late at night â€” fortunately he never had to.\n\n\"You can't take anything for granted,\" he said. \"Every day for these guys is just unknown for these guys in uniform, what's going to happen to them.\"\n\nSusan Shea, vice president of Concerns of Police Survivors Delaware Chapter, also gave remarks. Shea is the widow of Christopher Shea, a Delaware State Police officer who died in the line of duty in 2004 when he was struck by a drunken driver at age 31.\n\n\"I do know no matter how many years have passed, and unexpected moment of reflection with tears is OK,\" she said. \"I cannot even begin to imagine the pain and loss my children feel from losing their father. So many moments of firsts missed. A little boy's best friend gone before he even had the chance to know him, and a baby girl who will never know she truly was daddy's little girl.\"\n\nConcerns of Police Survivors has been a lifeline to her and her family, Shea said, though the group was not around when Futcher died 75 years ago.\n\nIn 2010, Futcher was recognized at the Delaware Law Enforcement Memorial, and then again in 2011 at the National Law Enforcement Memorial and by Sussex County.\n\nThe honors were organized by Futcher's granddaughter, JuneRose Futcher.\n\n\"The honor has been mine,\" she said.\n\nThe plaque can be found in Zwaanendael Park, just behind the museum about a dozen steps off Savannah Road.\n\n\"Your hero now resides right here for all to see,\" Shea said."
