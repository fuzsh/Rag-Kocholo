He may have had a brother Joseph who was born in 1740 and went to Ohio. Abraham was in WV in the 1780's and about 1797 he went to Dutch Station near Staunton, Ohio. He left there because the land was too swampy. He moved to Evans WV about 1799, but did not purchase his land until about 1806. After his wife died in 1810. he married Sarah Tilghman. He had children over 40 years. and died in 1826 reportedly from an infect of a bear bit which he received much earlier. Signing on his will was a Francis King who may have been a relative of his first wife. Family names include Abraham, Isaac, Cornelius, Jacob, Elijah, John, Catherine, Ann, Susana, Hannah. I would appreciate any information on either Abraham Staats or his wife Anna King. People have been searching for about 75 years for this family. There are many in the Staats family with this name.

Son Robert MOOR married Lydia SNOW a Mayflower descendant. 'Old' Duck Creek Hundred is found on record in 1685, and is given as embracing the land lying between Duck Creek and its southwest branch, called Little Duck Creek, and extending westward to the Maryland line; but the region was not finally settled until many years later. This division left Bombay Hook Island in New Castle County. Old Duck Creek is a very crooked stream, and made a sharp turn about a mile from the Delaware Bay, and then ran thirteen miles to where it joined the Dona River and entered the Bay. Some time previous to 1740 the route to the bay from the landing was shortened by cutting a thoroughfare at the turn, and Hon. Jacob Stout, in 1820, cut the Leipsic, or Little Duck Creek through. In 1841 this thoroughfare was made a part of the northern boundary of Kent County, thus placing Bombay Hook Island in Duck Creek Hundred. History of Delaware by: Scharf P. 1091 Wherefore; the will of Henry MOOR, witnessed by Heneritta MOOR, Jacob ALLEE and Thomas CAHOON in 1751, was made in New Castle County and probated in Kent County, Delaware. In the settlement of the inventory of Henry Moor's estate in 1751 there is a payment of 17 shillings and one pence to John Snow who was the father of Lydia Snow who would marry his son Robert Moor twenty two years later on November 23, 1773. Jacob ALLEE who witnessed the will of Henry Moor, also witnessed the will of Henry's son Robert Moor. Henry Moor's will leaves two plantations, [ one in New Castle County and one in Kent County to his sons Henry II and Robert MOOR. This would indicate that both were about eighteen years of age in 1751 when Henry made his will. In 1756 after Isaac SAPP married Elizabeth MOOR, the WIDOW of Henry Moor, and made petition to Kent County Orphans Court the ledger reveals that Abraham Moor paid six pounds sterling, and Mary Moor paid two pounds sterling to Henry Moor's estate. Of course, this Abraham Moor is not the same Abraham Moor that married the two Hopkins sisters [Susanna and Nancy] fifty years later. There are individuals listed on this document that married into the KILLEN family which was the family of the mother of the Hopkins sisters! John DRAUGHTON who was the executor of Henry Moor's will had a daughter named Margaret. Margaret DRAUGHTON [Drayton] was married to James Snow and they would had a daughter named Rebecca Snow. Rebecca Snow would marry Henry's brother' John's son John Moor, Jr., after Rebecca's first husband Abel REES died. Abel REES was the sister of Jeremiah Rees who was paid twelve shillings seven and one half pence by Henry Moor's widow when Isaac SAPP, Elizabeth Moor's new husband made their petition to Orphans Court. It is interesting to note that Henry Moor named three sons Henry, Robert and John and four unnamed daughters, and had two plantations, one in Kent County and one in New Castle County, because of the location of Duck Creek and Bombay Hook. Bombay Hook is one of Delaware's early landmarks. Today [1996] the Moor burial ground is maintained in the middle of a cornfield, on the grounds of the MOOR family Colonial Plantation near the Bombay Hook Wild Life refuge.\n\nTable of Contents NEXT SAPP QUERY NEXT SNOW QUERY\n\nIris Grimmett Tue Oct 29 15:40:30 1996 Joshua MORGAN was applying for land in 1702, Red Lion Hundred, New Castle Co.

They were in Missouri where my great great grandfather John Ide died and is buried and then Lydia went to live with her youngest daughter Elize Mary Harding, in Hendley, Furnas County, Nebraska. On March 23, 1900 the Ide's; Lydia Margaret born September 1831 her daughter Ella Betsey Ide Buckley and her husband John Creth Buckley, both were deaf, he was mute also at birth and three of their children and John's brother Samuel joined her son-in-law and daughter William Harvey and Elize Mary Ide Harding, seven of their children, the youngest Milo Lundy born January 7, 1900 in Beaver City and Will's parents Stuckley Winslow and Elizabeth Ellen Williams, Crow, Harding with a wagon train of some 40 families, who came out of Beaver City, the county seat of Furnas, Nebraska , that Spring morning toward Colorado and jobs on the Dam or Railroad in Montrose/Olathe, Colorado. Lydia and Ellen were both 71 years of age. The work was gone when they arrived and they went by May 26, 1902 to the North Fork Valley of the Colorado River, to a place called Juanita, now know as Bowie in Delta County. Lydia died of \"Antic Insufficiency,\" in Bowie August 18, 1905. Milo died October 23, 1902 of Typhoid fever there in Bowie. Three more children were born to Will and Liza Harding. Liza was a diabetic and died November 15, 1933, in Paonia, Delta County. The family had homesteaded on Minnesota Creek, the counties of Gunnison and Delta adjoin in the middle at the old home place, where Dallas Harding and his family live still. My grandmother, Estella Ella Harding Emmons (eldest daughter and first born of Will and Liza) said there were four (4) John Ide's and a Nathan behind her grandfather and the family came from England. There are two family members age 90 and 93, and five in their 80's. My oldest Uncle is 88 and remembers visiting the Ide's in Nebraska. He said \"Johnny\" Ide disappeared. Johnny was John M.

Although these people were probably all born in Maryland, both Ezra and David spent much time in Delaware and Ezra ended up settling in Pennsylvania. In the 1900 U.S. Census, Ezra S.

Born in Delaware I do not know for sure who the father of David H. Robinson was, but I have some reason to believe that the family was in the same general area for a long time. I have done some checking for Robinson families in that area having sons named David at the right age. I have found two such cases. I suspect that the first one listed below is the one, but I have not proven it. In the 1850 U.S. census, John Robinson was listed as a head of household in Cecil County, Maryland. John age 30 male born in Maryland Louisa age 24 female born in Maryland William age 8 male born in Maryland James age 7 male born in Maryland John age 5 male born in Maryland David age 2 male born in Maryland In the 1860 U.S. census, Henry Robinson was listed as a head of household in Sussex County, Delaware.

Robinson and many of the Robinsons who are listed in the census data above. I have many stories. These Robinsons believed that they were descended from the British General Robinson who fought in the Revolutionary War and then settled here after the war. I have verified that there was, in fact, a General Robinson fighting on the British side during the Revolutionary War. He did not figure prominently into the action, and is only mentioned in the more detailed accounts of the war. He was in Boston during the earliest days of the revolution and he retreated by sea during a patriot uprising. My Robinson forefathers also believed that they were descended from a Robinson who built a historical house which is still standing. My grandfather, William Neeld, grandson of Ezra Robinson, found and visited this house. It is on Philadelphia Pike in Delaware, near the Pennsylvania border. It is owned by a park service. It can be visited by appointment. This house was visited by George Washington and by other famous colonial patriots. It was built in 1723 by a Thomas Robinson. This seems to contradict the possibility of my Robinsons being descended from General Robinson who presumably settled here after the war. There are, of course, possible scenarios which would account for the apparent contradiction. If you know anything about my Robinsons, General Robinson, or the historical Robinson house, please contact me. I have been reading things put into cyberspace by Robinson researchers, and I have not yet seen anything about the general or the house. This seems a little odd. I did expect that these two things would be milestones which many Robinsons would be connecting themselves to and writing about. My family will be interested in hearing the details about the general and the house, even if it turns out that they are not really connected to us. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Bob Selfinger selfinger@ee.net 8300 E.

It seems that Moses may have had at least two sons, Stephen whom we can follow into the 20th Century, and William who disappears after 1830. As the family story goes, William may have died and Stephen raised not only his own, but his brother's children as well. We have yet to determine exactly which of the children belonged to which father. MATTHEWS: James MATTHEWS born 1824 had at least two brothers, Talbert and John. Various members of the family may have used other surnames. John may have used GREEN and James' son Charles who was born a slave to an owner by the name of Bayard MOORE was christened Charles KINNEY as an infant. He used KINNEY while serving in the Civil War, upon hi discharge, he settled in Dover and eventually relocated to Mercer County, NJ, where he returned to using KINNEY.
