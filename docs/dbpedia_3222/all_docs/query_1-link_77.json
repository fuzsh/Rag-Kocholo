In contrast, an average of 850 construction jobs were lost each year during the previous administration.\n\n17,000 Have Received a Raise:\n\nApproximately 10,000 Delaware workers benefited from an increase in the minimum wage�from $4.25 to $4.75 -- on October 1, 1996. They, along with about 7,000 more, received an additional raise�from $4.75 to $5.15 -- on September 1, 1997. President Clinton and Vice President Gore have called on Congress to raise the minimum wage by an additional $1.00 over two years.\n\nPoverty Has Fallen:\n\nNationally, the poverty rate has fallen from 15.1% in 1993 to 11.8% in 1999, the lowest level since 1979. In Delaware, the poverty rate has fallen to 10.3% in 1999. [Census Bureau]\n\nBusiness Failures Down 27.4% Per Year:\n\nBusiness failures in Delaware have dropped an average of 27.4% per year since 1993, after increasing 30.9% per year during the previous administration [Oct. 98 data].\n\nA $500 Child Tax Credit to Help Families Raising Children:\n\nTo help make it easier for families to raise their children, the balanced budget included a $500 per-child tax credit for children under 17. Thanks to President Clinton the balanced budget delivers a child tax credit to 77,000 families in Delaware.\n\nDelaware's Families Reap Benefits of Deficit Reduction:\n\nPublic debt is on track to be $2.4 trillion lower in 2000 than was projected in 1993. Debt reduction brings real benefits for the American people -- a family in Delaware with a home mortgage of $100,000 might expect to save roughly $2,000 per year in mortgage payments. Reduced debt also means lower interest rates and reduced payments on car loans and student loans.\n\nEXPANDING ACCESS TO EDUCATION\n\nOver 2,100 Children in Head Start:\n\n2,126 Delaware children were enrolled in Head Start in 1999. In FY00, Delaware will receive $9.9 million in Head Start funding, an increase of $5 million over 1993.\n\nMore High-Quality Teachers With Smaller Classes for Delaware's Schools:\n\nThanks to the Class Size Reduction Initiative, Delaware received $5.6 million in 1999 to hire about 145 new, well-prepared public school teachers and reduce class size in the early grades. President Clinton secured funding for a second installment of the plan, giving Delaware an additional $6.1 million in 2000.\n\n$1.7 Million in Goals 2000 Funding:\n\nThis year [FY00], Delaware receives $1.7 million in Goals 2000 funding. This money is used to raise academic achievement by raising academic standards, increasing parental and community involvement in education, expanding the use of computers and technology in classrooms, and supporting high-quality teacher professional development. [Education Department, 12/3/99]\n\nOver $2 Million for Technology Literacy:\n\nThis year [FY00], Delaware receives $2.1 million�doubling its funding over FY97 -- for the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund which helps communities and the private sector ensure that every student is equipped with the computer literacy skills needed for the 21st century.\n\n$21.6 Million for Students Most in Need:\n\nDelaware will receive $21.6 million in Title I Grants (to Local Educational Agencies) providing extra help in the basics for students most in need, particularly communities and schools with high concentrations of children in low-income families [FY00]. This includes nearly $369,000 in accountability grants, to help states and school districts turn around the worst performing schools and hold them accountable for results.\n\n$12.3 Million in Pell Grants:\n\nThis year [FY00], Delaware will receive $12.3 million in Pell Grants for low-income students going to college, benefiting 6,809 Delaware students.\n\nExpanded Work-Study To Help More Students Work Their Way Through College:\n\nThe FY00 budget includes a significant expansion of the Federal Work Study program. Delaware will receive $1.3 million in Work-Study funding in 2000 to help Delaware students work their way through college.\n\nNearly 800 Have Served in Delaware through AmeriCorps:\n\nSince the National Service program began in 1993, 750 AmeriCorps participants have earned money for college while working in Delaware's schools, hospitals, neighborhoods or parks.

This 20% tax credit will be applied to the first $5,000 of tuition and fees through 2002 and to the first $10,000 thereafter. 14,000 students in Delaware will receive a HOPE Scholarship tax credit of up to $1,500. 18,000 students in Delaware will receive the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit. [fully phased-in FY2000 estimate]\n\nExpanded Job Training to Delaware's Dislocated Workers:\n\nPresident Clinton's FY 2001 budget would triple funding for the dislocated workers program over 1992 levels. Delaware received over $2 million in 1999 to help 1,210 dislocated workers get the training and reemployment services they need to return to work as quickly as possible. In FY 2000, Delaware will receive over $1.6 million to provide job training for dislocated workers.\n\nFIGHTING CRIME AND VIOLENCE\n\n436 More Police:\n\nThe President's 1994 Crime Bill has funded 436 new police officers to date in communities across Delaware.

[through 9/2000]\n\nReducing Crime with Drug Courts:\n\nWorking to reduce drug-related crime in Delaware, the Clinton Administration has awarded a Drug Court grant to the community of Wilmington. Drug courts use the coercive power of the criminal justice system to combine drug testing, sanctions, supervision and treatment to push nonviolent, drug-abusing offenders to stop using drugs and committing crimes.\n\n$400,000 in Grants for Battered Women and Children:\n\nIn FY99, Delaware received $400,000 in HHS's Family Violence Prevention Program grants to assist women and children fleeing domestic abuse.\n\n$2.2 Million to Keep Drugs & Violence Out of Delaware's Schools:\n\nDelaware has received $2.2 million in FY00 for the Safe & Drug Free Schools Program, which invests in school security and drug prevention programs.\n\nMOVING DELAWARE RESIDENTS FROM WELFARE TO WORK\n\n12,053 Fewer People on Welfare:\n\nSince 1993, there are 12,053 fewer people on welfare in Delaware�a 44% decrease.

[through FY98]\n\nEncouraging Responsible Choices�Preventing Teen Pregnancy in Delaware:\n\nSince 1993, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have supported innovative and promising teen pregnancy prevention strategies, with significant components of the strategy becoming law in the 1996 Personal Responsibility Act. The law requires unmarried minor parents to stay in school and live at home or in a supervised setting; encourages \"second chance homes\" to provide teen parents with the skills and support they need; and provides $50 million a year in new funding for state abstinence education activities. Efforts are making a difference, adolescent pregnancy rates and teen abortion rates are declining. And between 1991 and 1997, teen birth rates declined 8.7% in Delaware.\n\n$4.1 Million for Delaware Welfare-to-Work:\n\nIn 1998, Delaware received $2.8 million in Federal welfare-to-work state formula grants (the state matched $1.4 million in funding), helping Delaware welfare recipients get and keep jobs. Part of the President's comprehensive efforts to move recipients from welfare to work, this funding was included in the $3 billion welfare to work fund in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.\n\nHelping People Get to Work\n\n: Through the Access to Jobs initiative, the Clinton-Gore Administration is working with communities across the country to design transportation solutions to help welfare recipients and other low-income workers get to and from work. Statewide, Delaware has received $738,688 this year to fund innovative transit projects.\n\nINVESTING IN DELAWARE'S HEALTH\n\nHealth Care for Nearly 2,500 Uninsured Delaware Children:\n\nIn 1997, President Clinton passed the largest single investment in health care for children since 1965 -- an unprecedented $24 billion over five years to cover as many as five million children throughout the nation. This investment guarantees the full range of benefits that children need to grow up strong and healthy. Two million children nationwide have health care coverage thanks to the President's plan, including 2,433 in Delaware. [HHS, Health Care Financing Administration, FY99 SCHIP enrollment data]\n\nHelping Over 15,000 Delaware Women and Children with WIC:\n\nThe Clinton Administration is committed to full funding in the Special Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). In FY98, Delaware received $8 million in total WIC grant funding, helping 15,221 women, infants and children in need receive health and food assistance. [through 8/99]\n\nMore Toddlers Are Being Immunized:\n\nAs a result of the President's 1993 Childhood Immunization Initiative, childhood immunization rates have reached an historic high. According to the CDC, 90% or more of America's toddlers received the most critical doses of each of the routinely recommended vaccines in 1996, 1997, and again in 1998 �surpassing the President's 1993 goal. In Delaware in 1998, 93% of two-year olds received the vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis; 90% received the vaccine for polio; 94% received the vaccine for measles, and 94% received the vaccine for Haemophilus influenzae B, the bacteria causing a form of meningitis.\n\nFunding for HIV/AIDS Assistance Programs:\n\nIn FY 2000, Delaware will receive over $1.5 million in Ryan White Title II formula grants.

[Treasury Dept., 2/99]\n\n370,000 Americans in Delaware Cannot Be Assured They Have Patient Protections:\n\nEven if Delaware enacted all the protections in the Patients' Bill of Rights, 370,000 people in Delaware cannot be assured they have the comprehensive patient protections recommended by the President's Advisory Commission. This is because the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) may preempt state-enacted protections. That is why the President has called on Congress to pass a federally enforceable patients' bill of rights so that everyone enrolled in managed care may have a basic set of protections. Notably, 190,000 Delaware women are in ERISA health plans and are therefore not necessarily protected. Women are particularly vulnerable without these protections because they are greater users of health care services, they make three-quarters of the health care decisions for their families, and they have specific health care needs addressed by a patients' bill of rights.\n\nPROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT\n\n$7.7 Million in Safe Drinking Water Funding:\n\nThis year [FY00], thanks to President Clinton, Delaware will receive $7.7 million for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds to provide low-interest loans to municipalities to build, improve, and prevent pollution of drinking water systems.\n\n9 Superfund Sites Cleaned Up:\n\nSince 1993, the EPA has completed 9 toxic waste site clean-ups in Delaware.

This is more than twice the number of sites cleaned up in Delaware during the previous two administrations. [through 3/1/00]\n\nRevitalizing Brownfields Project in Wilmington:\n\nAs part of the Clinton-Gore Administration's efforts to clean up Brownfields, the EPA has awarded grants to Wilmington, Delaware for environmental clean-up and economic revitalization. This project is intended to jump-start local clean-up efforts by providing funds to return unproductive, abandoned, contaminated urban properties to productive use.\n\nImproving Water Quality in Delaware\n\n: Delaware is receiving $10 million through the USDA's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), as well as $2 million from non-federal sources, for a Federal-State partnership to improve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, and Inland Bays basin areas. CREP is a new voluntary initiative where the Agriculture Department partners with State governments and local interests to address local environmental problems related to agriculture.\n\nSPEARHEADING URBAN AND RURAL RENEWAL PROJECTS\n\nRevitalizing Delaware's Communities:\n\nWilmington was designated an Enterprise Community in December 1994 and was awarded $3 million to create more jobs, housing, and economic opportunity for area residents.\n\nPROVIDING DISASTER RELIEF\n\n$20.8 Million in Federal Emergency Assistance:\n\nSince 1993, Delaware has received $20.8 million in disaster relief. This includes $2.8 million for assistance towards victims of severe winter storms, high winds and flooding in 1998 and over $6 million in disaster assistance for damage done by Hurricane Floyd in 1999. [FEMA, 2/29/00]\n\nEXPANDING FUNDS FOR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT\n\n$356 Million in Federal Highway Aid:\n\nSince 1993, Delaware has received over $356 million in federal highway aid.
