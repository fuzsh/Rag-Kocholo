        "text": "As a brief writer for Littler CaseSmart – Litigation™, Bill Allen formulates and executes briefing strategy for cases. He evaluates and selects legal authority that supports the facts and circumstances of each case and prepares substantive briefs and motions, including complex dispositive motions, oppositions to collective and class treatment, decertification motions, motions to compel arbitration, appeals, and mediation statements. Bill is based in Colorado.\n\nPreviously a Littler Shareholder, Bill is an experienced employment litigator with a focus on complex matters in the wage and hour, employment discrimination, and arbitration areas. He regularly represented clients in collective and class actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws, including matters involving off-the-clock work, employee misclassification, joint employer status, meal and rest periods, termination pay, preliminary and postliminary activities, and the fluctuating workweek method for overtime compensation. Bill also conducted outside fact investigations for clients involving claims of discrimination and harassment. He has briefed appeals in the District of Columbia, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits, and before the United States Supreme Court.\n\nIn his more than 25 years of practice, Bill has experience in a wide variety of industries, including small- and large-box retail, grocery, food production and distribution, restaurants, inventory, construction, recycling, armored services, law enforcement, promotional marketing, software sales, technology, hospitals, home care, women’s care, and managed care.\n\nAs part of his complex wage and hour practice, Bill has helped clients secure multi-district litigation (MDL) treatment, obtain decertification of a nationwide collective action, limit or defeat conditional certification of proposed nationwide collective actions, and obtain dismissal and summary judgment. He also has experience with litigating individual and class action employment discrimination claims, participating in mediation and settlement negotiations, preparing jury research exercises, and working with damages experts.\n\nPrior to joining Littler, Bill was senior counsel with a prominent labor and employment practice group at another firm. Bill also worked for four years as an associate counsel at the Office of House Employment Counsel of the United States of House of Representatives, where he provided training and counseling to Congressional members and committees, House Officers, and the U.S. Capitol Police, participated in mediation and administrative hearings, litigated individual and class action employment discrimination cases in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and argued a constitutional immunity issue before an en banc panel of the D.C. Circuit.\n\nWhile at the University of Virginia, Bill served three terms on the university’s Honor Committee."
