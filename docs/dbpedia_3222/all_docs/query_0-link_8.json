        "text": "William “Bill” C. Allen, 70, of Milton, passed away Saturday, Jan. 25, 2014, at Milford Memorial Hospital, Milford. He was born Aug. 17, 1943, in Baltimore, Md., son of the late Henry W. and Theresa K. (Kuciej) Allen.\n\nMr. Allen was born and raised in Baltimore, where he graduated from Southern High School in 1961. He continued his education attending the University of Baltimore. He proudly served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam conflict. After serving his country, he began a career with Western Electric (now known as Bell Atlantic).\n\nIn 1995 after 25 years of dedicated service, he retired as a training instructor. Following his retirement, he began working for the State of Maryland on the creation of training programs. Eventually, Mr. Allen relocated to Milton.\n\nMr. Allen was a jokester at heart who always had an infectious smile, full of humor and love; he could light up a room just by walking in. During football season, Mr. Allen could be found cheering on his favorite team, Navy. He enjoyed a cold Coors Light and conversation with friends during happy hour at Grand Slam.\n\nHe considered himself somewhat of a “beach bum,” as he loved the water and spent most weekends at his condo in Ocean City, Md. Mr. Allen was a member of the Pioneers of America, which was a Bell Atlantic retirement group. He was an active member of Epworth United Methodist Church.\n\nMr. Allen was dearly loved by his family and friends and will be cherished by all who knew him.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Bill was preceded in death by his one brother, John Allen, in 1997. He is survived by his long time and best friend, Ron Deremer of Milton; his two sons: Michael Allen of Kent Island, Md. and Matthew Allen and his wife Tina of Crownsville, Md.; his granddaughter, Kassidy Allen; his sister, Linda Allen of Bear; his sister-in-law, Rosemarie Allen of Baltimore; his good friend, Tom Bonderenko of Baltimore; and numerous nieces, nephews, and dear friends.\n\nA celebration of Bill’s life will be held Saturday, Feb. 1, at 11 a.m., at Epworth United Methodist Church, 19285 Holland Glade Road, Rehoboth Beach, where friends may visit beginning at 10 a.m. Interment will be private. Arrangements are being handled by Parsell Funeral Homes & Crematorium, Lewes.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made in Bill’s name to Moveable Feast, P.O. Box 2298, Baltimore, MD 21203, or to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."
