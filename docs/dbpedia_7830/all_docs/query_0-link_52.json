        "text": "JIM ERWIN\n\nHow far will a man go to protect his family? Will he disregard law\n\nand order and play by his own rules?\n\nYes, “Hostage” is a very silly movie, but Bruce Willis has enough\n\ncharisma to make a stinker like this fun to watch.\n\nThis movie is based on a novel by Robert Crais, but don’t expect\n\n“Hostage” to be nominated for best-adapted screenplay. It’s basically\n\na hybrid of “Die Hard” and “Home Alone.” Another alternate working\n\ntitle might have been, “The Passion of Bruce Willis.” The story is\n\nconvoluted and the plot has more holes than Albert Hall, even when\n\njudged solely by action movie standards.\n\nJeff Talley (Willis) is a SWAT negotiator who literally has blood\n\non his hands when he fails. After the stress of the job becomes too\n\nmuch, he leaves the Los Angeles Police Department and takes a job as\n\nthe chief of police in a small town in Ventura County.\n\nUnfortunately, things don’t stay quiet in the city of Bristo\n\nCamino. A trio of incompetent crooks bungles a home burglary and the\n\nsituation quickly spirals out of control. Talley once again finds\n\nhimself facing a hostage situation.\n\nThe twist is that the homeowner is a crooked accountant who is\n\nemployed by some very powerful shadowy figures. These unknown men of\n\npower kidnap Talley’s family and hold them hostage to make sure that\n\nTalley allows them to protect their financial interests inside the\n\nhome.\n\nI was able to suspend disbelief and play along with this subplot\n\nup to a certain point, but “Hostage” becomes a laugher during the\n\nfinal act. Director Florent Emilio Siri’s use of religious imagery\n\nand symbolism is what really makes “Hostage,” into a movie that\n\nyou’ll love because it’s so awful. Despite all of this, I had fun\n\nwatching “Hostage.” While this isn’t one of Willis’s better movies,\n\nhe’s always likable. We always pull for him, no matter how ridiculous\n\nthings become.\n\nIf you’re a Willis fan, you’ll enjoy it. The only caveat is that\n\n“Hostage” is probably best as a left as rental.\n\n* JIM ERWIN, 40, is a technical writer and computer trainer.\n\n‘Robots’ is a portal to a different world\n\nAs I sit through some of the truly amazing computer-generated\n\nanimation that is available in our theaters today, I often think of\n\njust how jaded we’ve become, that we no longer marvel at these\n\ncreations.\n\nThe latest such offering is “Robots,” co-directed by Chris Wedge\n\nand Carlos Saldanha, the same partnership that created the hugely\n\nsuccessful “Ice Age” in 2002.\n\n“Robots” is really much more than simply another quickly forgotten\n\nchapter in the still-evolving world of computer-generated animation.\n\nRather, the film acts as a portal to a fully realized universe where\n\nnothing resembling the natural world exists. The film is somewhat\n\nschizophrenic as it portrays a future where no human, or indeed\n\nanything biological, exists while also displaying an art deco look\n\nreminiscent of 1930’s comic books and pulp novels.\n\nSince “Robots” is set in the two fictitious venues of Rivet City\n\nand Robot City, virtually every surface appears to be made of metal\n\nand the palette of vivid colors has the luster and depth of baked-on\n\nporcelain.\n\n“Robots” relates the story of Rodney Copperbottom (voice of Ewan\n\nMcGregor). Rodney is a fledging inventor living in the small town of\n\nRivet City, who dreams of making it big in the metropolis of Robot\n\nCity. Rodney’s father (Stanley Tucci) is a dishwasher (literally, as\n\nthe appliance forms the bulk of his torso) and once dreamed of being\n\na musician.\n\nRobot City’s most famous citizen is a tycoon named Big Weld (Mel\n\nBrooks) who broadcasts a TV show extolling the virtues of his\n\ninventions and company. Rodney sets out to Robot City to show Big\n\nWeld one of his inventions.\n\nUpon arriving, Rodney meets Fender (Robin Williams at his most\n\nmanic). Fender is a con artist of sorts who, after unsuccessfully\n\ntrying to sell snapshots to the newly arrived Rodney, agrees to show\n\nhim how to get to Big Weld’s headquarters via Robot City’s public\n\ntransportation. This segment is wildly imaginative as the transit\n\nsystem incorporates aspects of pinball machines, roulette wheels and\n\ngyroscopes in bouncing Rodney and Fender toward their ultimate\n\ndestination.\n\nWhat follows is a wild ride through the Robot City with elements\n\nborrowed from such disparate sources as “Les Miserables,” “The Wizard\n\nof Oz,” “Star Wars” and even a Britney Spears’ video. The action is\n\nnonstop and there are plenty of funny lines to go around. “Robots”\n\ndoes manage to maintain its detail and focus throughout, despite the\n\nfrantic pace.\n\n“Robots” is a remarkable achievement in its own right. If you\n\nenjoyed “Ice Age” and the numerous Pixar efforts, “Robots” will not\n\ndisappoint.\n\n* VAN NOVACK, 50, is the director of institutional research at Cal\n\nState Long Beach and lives in Huntington Beach with his wife\n\nElizabeth."
