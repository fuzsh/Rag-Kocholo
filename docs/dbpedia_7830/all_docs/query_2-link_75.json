Symptoms vary, depending on which part of the brain is affected, but often include a profound loss of inhibition and empathy, two of the things that most make us who we are.\n\n“The vast majority of patients have no insights into the changes that are happening with their behaviour or their personality,” said Dr. Elizabeth Finger, a neurologist at St. Joseph’s Health Care London.\n\nArticle content\n\nSymptoms get worse over time. “If the disease follows its typical path, that will probably include slowly disconnecting and progressively losing emotional judgment and control as well as losing a reasonable understanding of what or why any of it is happening,” wrote Merzenich, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nFTD differs from Alzheimer’s and other dementias that usually occur with old age. Finger, an associate professor in clinical neurological sciences at Western University, spoke to National Post’s Sharon Kirkey about the disorder afflicting Willis, and explained what it is — and isn’t.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhat is frontotemporal dementia?\n\nIt’s not one, but a collection of disorders. It’s considered the second-most common early onset neurodegenerative dementia. It tends to strike people about a decade sooner than Alzheimer’s, “so, people in their 50s to early 60s,” Finger said.\n\nUnlike Alzheimer’s, where the early signs are often memory related, classically, with FTD, the first changes are in behaviour, personality, judgment and decision-making. In some variants of FTD affecting language, “we may see changes in expressive speech, or comprehension early on,” Finger said.\n\nWhat causes FTD?\n\nAbout 40 per cent of people are thought to have some hereditary aspect to their disease, meaning they have at least one family member who had another neurodegenerative disease, though not necessarily FTD.\n\nThe other 60 per cent or so are deemed sporadic, not genetic. “And in sporadic FTD, the only sort of environmental or life history risk factor that’s been identified so far is concussion or traumatic brain injury,” Finger said. But while a concussion might explain some cases, most people with FTD haven’t had a concussion, “and the majority of people with a concussion don’t get FTD.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nJust as the name indicates, FTD tends to be most severe in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. It can start on one side, or the other, but, over time, the disease tends to affect both sides of the brain. Parts of the brain shrink, or atrophy.\n\n“We see pretty relentless progression of the loss of connections in the brain, the loss of synapses, the loss of neurons,” Finger said.\n\nIt’s hard to know what a person’s symptoms or decline are going to look like six months later, or a year later, she said. “There’s a fair bit of variability between people and their rates of decline.\n\n“But over time, judgment, decision-making, memory, even, and certainly language deficits get worse.”\n\nWhat are the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia?\n\nSome of the most common symptoms with the behavioural type of FTD include disinhibition and apathy, sometimes new repetitive, compulsive behaviours. One woman in her 50s became so compulsive about drinking water, her family had to shut off the valves to the taps. “She was drinking so much water she was going to cause trouble with her own sodium level,” Finger said. A man in his early 40s, a successful fast-food franchise owner who was once sociable and competent, became selfish and neglectful. He became obsessive about counting objects and would repeat the same phrase, “It’s good to be alive,” hundreds of time a day. “When he went into a room, he’d want to trace the furniture with his finger.” He became more disinhibited, Finger said. When eating out at restaurants, “he would eat off his own plate, and then eat off the plates of other people who were at his table, and even go to other tables in the restaurant and ask people if they were finished with their dinner, and, if so, would sit down to finish the food on their plate.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe usual social norms and social graces get lost. People start making comments to family, friends or strangers that are rude, inappropriate, or overly personal.\n\nSome lose “verbal fluency,” Merzenich wrote. They have problems speaking properly; speech can become slurred.\n\n“In terms of apathy, patients lose interest in work, in hobbies they used to spend a lot of time on,” Finger said. They become disinterested in family or friends they used to care about, and become more self-focused, more self-centred, like a toddler acting on his own needs and impulses, Finger said, “and not really able to consider other people’s perspectives anymore or consider their emotional needs.” Some partners might wonder, what is this? A midlife crisis?\n\n“FTD, in any of its forms, is devastating for patients and just as devastating for partners and caregivers.” But because they have no insight into what’s happening, they’re often quite insistent that everything is the same, Finger said. “They can’t understand why anyone is concerned.”\n\nCan FTD be treated?\n\nThere is no cure, and no way to slow it down, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. There are ways to manage behaviour changes, and language problems, using different strategies that may need to be changed as the illness progresses.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCan some of the lost empathy by recovered?\n\nFinger and her colleagues are testing oxytocin, a hormone that works as a signalling molecule in the brain of both men and women. Animal studies dating back to the 1990s suggested it could influence social behaviour. “It kind of got a reputation as being pro-social, even a maternal kind of hormone,” though effects could be seen in both sexes. In animals, it improved pair bonding and grooming and nesting behaviours.\n\nShe’s now looking at whether it might help restore some of the empathy deficits with FTD. She and her colleagues are at the tail-end of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving just under 100 patients. They expect to have the results at the end of summer or fall.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nThese companies want to read your genes to tell your true age, then make you younger\n\nOzempic explained: How weight loss drug works\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
