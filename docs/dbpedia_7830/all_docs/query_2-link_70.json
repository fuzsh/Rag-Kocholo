        "text": "It’s a well known fact that there are many talented young actors in Germany. But some Hollywood stars have German roots. Here are seven examples:\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nThe star in films such as Maleficent, Wanted and Girl Interrupted comes from a family of actors. Angelina Jolie’s parents, Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand, both have German roots, as well as Slovak, Franco-Canadian and Dutch.\n\nMichael Fassbender\n\nMichael Fassbender was born in Heidelberg to a German father and an Irish mother. He speaks a little German, but not as well as a native speaker – as could be seen in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds.\n\nSandra Bullock\n\nSandra Bullock spent the first twelve years of her life mainly in Nuremberg, because her mother, the German opera singer Helga Meyer, performed there at the State Theatre. Her father was an American soldier stationed in Germany. That’s why she has both American and German citizenship.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio first found his way into the hearts of filmgoers in James Cameron’s epic Titanic. And he finally received an Oscar for his role in The Revenant. His father has German and Italian ancestors, and his mother has Russian ones. They named him Leonardo, because he started moving in his mother’s womb while they were standing in front of a painting by Leonardo da Vinci in Florence."
