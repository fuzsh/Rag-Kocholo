(Stateside, anyway; some of them haven’t yet been released in Canada.) In Cosmic Sin he played a space soldier. In Out of Death he was a retired cop. Then he was an FBI agent in Midnight in the Grass. These were followed by Survive the Game (cop), Apex (space cop), Deadlock (retired soldier), Fortress (retired CIA agent) and American Siege (sheriff).\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThe pandemic belongs to Bruce Willis Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

Willis seems to gravitate to superintendent and lieutenant roles, but will occasionally agree to be the captain or, in extreme circumstances, stoop to playing a mere detective sergeant. Posters for his 2021 parade of movies include no fewer than five badges. Seven of them show guns. In none of them is Willis pushing a pencil, sitting behind a desk or visibly taking any guff.\n\nBut critics have not been kind to his latest body of work, most of it bypassing cinemas to be released on demand. It’s never good to have a rottentomatoes score of 28%. It’s particularly bad when that’s the tally for your output from an entire year.\n\nStill, Willis has crafted a successful career out of quantity first, quality second. It’s a tactic that has worked well for him. On the quantity side, there have only been two times since his explosive onscreen appearance in 1988’s Die Hard made him a bona fide movie star that he has had only one release in a calendar year.\n\nIn 2001 his sole role was opposite Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchett as a bank robber in Bandits. And in 2009 he was in the sci-fi action film Surrogates where he played — wait for it — an FBI agent.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAs for quality, Willis remains a reliable box-office draw, placing 23rd in a list of total revenues, with a combined North American take of almost $3 billion over his career. If you strip out actors whose work mostly encompasses superhero franchises, which are their own draw, he moves up eight places to number 15, just between Emma Watson and Adam Sandler.\n\nWillis has also racked up an impressive number of prizes and nominations, including three Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, two People’s Choice Awards, a Golden Globe and seven nominations for — oh wait, those are for Razzies. Still…\n\nWillis may not hit it out of the park every time, but he has enough great performances to keep him in the Hollywood firmament, even should he retire tomorrow or (perish the thought) never make another good movie again.\n\nAnd speaking of the future, what does Willis have lined up for audiences? Quite a lot, it turns out. A glance at his imdb.com page lists a dozen projects either completed, in post-production, filming or in pre-production. All are slated to come out in the next two years, although COVID knows that could change. Here’s a quick rundown:\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nGasoline Alley – Detective Freeman (Willis) and his partner (Luke Wilson) investigate a triple homicide seemingly committed by Jimmy Jayne (Devon Sawa), who swears he’s innocent. Badges? They’ve got two! Guns? They’ve got plenty. Guff-taking? Not even a hint in the trailer.\n\nVendetta – Clive Standen is a man out for vengeance after his daughter is murdered. Willis plays the killer’s father. Badges? Not on the poster. Guns? Definitely on the poster. Guff-taking? You know what? We’re going to take it as read that Willis never takes guff. We’ll let you know if that changes.\n\nFortress 2 – Sequel to last year’s Fortress, about a top-secret resort for retired U.S. intelligence officers. Why have we never heard of this — oh, wait, never mind. Badges? Not any more — he’s retired! Guns? Guns never retire.\n\nA Day to Die – Is this a James Bond / Die Hard crossover? No. It’s Willis as a corrupt police chief (I knew it!) up against a disgraced parole officer (Kevin Dillon) who’s pulling drug heists to pay off a debt. Badges? Yep. Guns? You know it.\n\nThe Wrong Place – This one’s about a methamphetamines cook who hunts down a former police chief to silence him before he can testify in court. No word on which role Willis is playing, but come on. A cook? Badges? At least one. Guns? The one image released so far has Willis staring down the barrel of a pistol.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSoul Assassin – Jesse Atlas has adapted his 2017 sci-fi short Let Them Die Like Lovers, sadly not going with the title Let Them Die Hard Like Lovers. It’s about a soldier who hops from one body to another while trying to solve a mystery. Badges? Probably some futuristic badges. Guns? Guessing some futuristic guns.\n\nCorrective Measures – This sci-fi thriller, set in a maximum security prison, features Willis as wealthy inmate Julius “The Lobe” Loeb, and Michael Rooker as the corrupt warden. Badges: Yes, but not for Willis. Guns? Not unless he steals one — and you know he’ll steal one.\n\nWhile Elephant – Willis and Rooker also star in this one, as a mob boss and his top enforcer. Badges? Probably not. Guns? Almost certainly.\n\nParadise City – Willis reunites with his old Pulp Fiction costar John Travolta, as he plays a renegade bounty hunter seeking vengeance against a crime kingpin (Travolta). Word on the street is it’s like Miami Vice but with bounty hunters instead of cops. Badges? So close, but no. Guns? If Miami Vice had them, you can bet this will too.\n\nWire Room – Oliver Trevena stars as Irish arms dealer Eddie Flynn. No word on who Willis is playing. (Please make him an Irish cop. Please make him an Irish cop.) Badges? (Please have badges. Please have badges.) Guns? Yes, unless Eddie is trading in prosthetic arms…\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFortress 3 – See Fortress 2 or, failing that, Fortress.\n\nHair of the Dog – Little is known about this 2023 thriller, except that Gerard Butler plays the head of a mysterious organization that deals in vengeance, and Willis somehow gets caught up in a murder/blackmail plot. There may not be badges, but we’re pretty certain someone will have a gun. And for the record, Willis will not be taking any guff.\n\n10 great Bruce Willis movies\n\nDie Hard (1988) was just Willis’s fifth film role – and two of those were as extras! – but he was already a name thanks to TV’s Moonlighting when he introduced the world to the NYPD’s John McClane, and forever changed the way we think of the term “yippee-ki-yay.”\n\nPulp Fiction (1994) from Quentin Tarantino featured an ensemble cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames and more, but Willis stood out as boxer Butch Coolidge, particularly for the way he and John Travolta’s character (briefly) meet.\n\nTwelve Monkeys (1995) is one of Willis’s many “number films” — see Loaded Weapon 1, Four Rooms, The Whole Nine Yards, 16 Blocks, etc. It’s also one great piece of sci-fi about a man sent back in time to stop a deadly virus. We can relate.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Fifth Element (1997) gives us more numbers and more science-fiction, as Willis plays a cab driver caught up in the search for a valuable weapon that might also be a person.\n\nThe Sixth Sense (1999) ignited the fortunes of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan and child actor Haley Joel Osment, but where would their careers be without Willis as child psychologist Malcolm Crowe? Dead, that’s where.\n\nLive Free or Die Hard (2007) is the fourth Die Hard movie of five to date but it’s always been one of my favourites, in part thanks to Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane’s chip-off-the-old-block daughter.\n\nLooper (2012) is a whip-smart piece of sci-fi from writer/director Rian Johnson, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a hitman in the near future, and Willis as his older self, and target.\n\nMoonrise Kingdom (2012) has Willis in a small role amid a typically sprawling Wes Anderson cast. But it’s a wonderful movie and everyone, Willis included, is giving it their all.\n\nRED 2 (2013) is not a great film, and many would list Armageddon as a better option when you want to watch Willis on the screen while not thinking. But this one has several things Armageddon doesn’t, including John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and a truly insane number of hats.\n\nUntitled Future Bruce Willis Hit (20??) is what we’re calling the next great movie he’s going to make. Will it be one of the many listed above that are already in production or ready to go? Probably not. Will it be a long-rumoured sixth Die Hard, which I insist must be called Only the Good Die Hard? Maybe. But we’re guessing Willis will take us by surprise one of these days, perhaps with the Oscar-worthy performance we’ve long known was inside him.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
