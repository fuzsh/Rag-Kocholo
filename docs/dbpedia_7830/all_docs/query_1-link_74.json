        "text": "Photo: ‘Wire Room’\n\nThe Hollywood Insider wishes the legendary Bruce Willis a speedy recovery.\n\nWhat to Expect from Wire Room\n\nIn recent times, every Bruce Willis fan knows that the actor has retired from acting since he was diagnosed with aphasia, a disease that affects a person’s ability to communicate. This shocks the whole world since he is best-remembered for his role as John McClane, a loose cannon cop in the ‘Die Hard’ films. He was also noticed for choosing films that differed from the action archetype. He starred in other critically-acclaimed and independent films such as ‘Pulp Fiction’ and ‘The Sixth Sense.’ Lionsgate has now released his latest action film, ‘Wire Room.’ He stars with the legendary actor Kevin Dillon, who is well-known for the hit show ‘Entourage’ and had worked in two Oliver Stone films: ‘Platoon’ and ‘The Doors.’ His first time working with Bruce Willis was when they both starred in the action crime film, ‘A Day to Die.’ It has become a shock that ‘Wire Room’ will be their second and last film together.\n\nRelated article: The Hollywood Insider’s CEO Pritan Ambroase: “The Importance of Venice Film Festival as the Protector of Cinema”\n\nRelated article: The Masters of Cinema Archives: The Hollywood Insider Pays Tribute to ‘La Vie En Rose’, Exclusive Interview with Director Olivier Dahan\n\nRelated article: – Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?

Shane and Nour are also training the new rookie, Justin Rosa (played by Kevin Dillon). Kevin Dillion’s character’s first day of his job is to monitor Eddie Flynn. Shane believes Justin is the perfect candidate to do so since he had experience working with the secret service. His past experience with his old job has granted him a position to get intel for the department of Homeland Security. Justin has no plans to have Eddie killed right away since the surveillanced criminal has a lot of information about other contributors to the drug trade.\n\nSome of the associates might be corrupt policemen. What raises the stakes in the story is the fact that Rosa did not receive the proper training for his job at Homeland Security. Because the SWAT team invades Eddie’s home, Rosa must unexpectedly break his protocol by contacting the drug runner himself to save his life by informing the dangers that now surround him. Justin is not allowed to leave the wire room. Therefore, he sends Shane to go to Eddie’s residence and to keep him alive. We are not very sure the reason why Kevin Dillon’s character is demoted from his occupation at the secret service, but the audiences are guessing it is because he is a bit of a rule breaker.\n\nRelated video: Full Commentary – Cast & Crew Spills Secrets on Making of ‘Elvis’ | In-Depth Scoop | Austin Butler\n\nRelated video: Full Rendezvous At the Premiere of ‘Elvis’ with Reactions from Stars | Austin Butler, Baz Luhrmann\n\nRelated video: Come Behind The Scenes of ‘Elvis’ | Austin Butler, Tom Hanks and Baz Luhrmann\n\nThe Action Movie’s Merritts\n\nKevin Dillon’s character is fascinating to watch because he is an individual that is given an opportunity to collaborate with other experienced Homeland Security agents. He gets a little too confident despite that he has no experience in his new occupation. Nonetheless, danger comes, and he is capable of adjusting to new situations by being a great team player.\n\nThe film should not be compared to Bruce Willis’ past memorable action roles. ‘Wire Room’ is a solid action film that is made on a smaller budget. I believe the audience will agree that Bruce Willis picked a humbling role. His character isn’t as over-the-top like as his other past roles. Shane Mueller’s part wasn’t as emphasized as Kevin Dillon’s role, but it was a very modest role since Willis is getting older. The CGI is mostly used for bloody action scenes and other scenes which involve violence and stunts. The story is not focused on character studies or anything of that nature. It does a good job of keeping the audience entertained. The villain is even menacing and provides a fair amount of twists that will have audiences guessing. Bruce Willis gives a spectacular performance that fits him well since this film will be his last one. The editing is very fast-paced which keeps the viewer intrigued of what is going to happen. Kevin Dillon’s character uses multiple computer screens to look at the villain as he tries to survive the SWAT team.\n\nRelated article: MUST WATCH – The Hollywood Insider’s CEO Pritan Ambroase’s Love Letter to Black Lives Matter – VIDEO\n\nRelated article: Why Queen Elizabeth II Is One Of The Greatest Monarchs | Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of United Queendom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland (Video Insight)\n\nRelated article: All Best Actor/Actress Speeches From The Beginning Of Oscars 1929-2019 | Hollywood Insider\n\nBruce Willis Movie\n\nThe cinematography gives us the feeling of danger as we see the characters looking at multiple monitors and looking at what the villain does next. The story gets even more intense as the corrupt officers make their attempt to go to the wire room and kill Rosa and Mueller and to get rid of any evidence that will be used against them. The direction from Matt Eskandari is very impressive since he directed Kevin Dillon to believe that he was in the wire room and seeing all the danger that was unfolding on the surveillance monitors.\n\nIn a couple of interviews, Kevin Dillion talks about his role and speaks highly about working with Bruce Willis and their second time in an action movie together. He thought the script was really good and was also excited to work with the acting legend. Kevin Dillon talked about how he probably worked at least four days. However, he was already prepared by memorizing a lot of lines since the director and the crew must film each action part as well.‘Wire Room’ did not have a big budget, to begin with like any other film that involved Bruce Willis. Even Kevin Dillion does a good job of performing his own status in the fight scenes. He also explains the process of doing his own stunts and how to make them look convincing. The film should not be compared to all the other past Bruce Willis films, it should stand out as an original work with a modest budget. It will have audiences at the edge of their seats since there is never a dull moment in the story. The movie is now in selected theaters, digital, and On Demand.\n\nDirected by Matt Eskandari.\n\nWritten by Brandon Stiefer\n\nProduced by Randall Emmet, George Furla, , Oliver Trevena, Norton Herrick, Caesar Richbow, Mark Stewart, and Noel Ashman.\n\nCinematography by Will Barratt\n\nEdited by Chris Patterson\n\nBy Marco Castaneda\n\nClick here to read The Hollywood Insider’s CEO Pritan Ambroase’s love letter to Cinema, TV and Media. An excerpt from the love letter: The Hollywood Insider’s CEO/editor-in-chief Pritan Ambroase affirms, “We have the space and time for all your stories, no matter who/what/where you are. Media/Cinema/TV have a responsibility to better the world and The Hollywood Insider will continue to do so. Talent, diversity and authenticity matter in Cinema/TV, media and storytelling. In fact, I reckon that we should announce “talent-diversity-authenticity-storytelling-Cinema-Oscars-Academy-Awards” as synonyms of each other. We show respect to talent and stories regardless of their skin color, race, gender, sexuality, religion, nationality, etc., thus allowing authenticity into this system just by something as simple as accepting and showing respect to the human species’ factual diversity. We become greater just by respecting and appreciating talent in all its shapes, sizes, and forms. Award winners, which includes nominees, must be chosen on the greatness of their talent ALONE.\n\nI am sure I am speaking for a multitude of Cinema lovers all over the world when I speak of the following sentiments that this medium of art has blessed me with. Cinema taught me about our world, at times in English and at times through the beautiful one-inch bar of subtitles. I learned from the stories in the global movies that we are all alike across all borders. Remember that one of the best symbols of many great civilizations and their prosperity has been the art they have left behind. This art can be in the form of paintings, sculptures, architecture, writings, inventions, etc. For our modern society, Cinema happens to be one of them. Cinema is more than just a form of entertainment, it is an integral part of society. I love the world uniting, be it for Cinema, TV, media, art, fashion, sport, etc. Please keep this going full speed.”\n\nMore Interesting Stories From The Hollywood Insider\n\n– Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?
