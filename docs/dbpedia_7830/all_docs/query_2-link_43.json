        "text": "Bruce Willis fans have been completely moved by one of the actor’s lesser known films.\n\nNetflix viewers have discovered the Hollywood star’s 2003 film Tears of the Sun and can’t stop praising Willis’ performance. Some even branded the noughties movie a “masterpiece” after watching.\n\nOn the Facebook group Netflix Bangers, fans flocked to share their thoughts and one person wrote: “Best movie he ever made besides Armageddon and I wouldn’t choose.” Another user added: “I love this movie. [Yo], I cried the first time I watched it.”\n\nREAD MORE: Click for more brilliant Daily Star showbiz stories\n\nREAD MORE: Netflix series 'so good' fans can't stop bingeing in a day as they beg for more\n\nSomeone else typed: “A true movie love can never miss this masterpiece,” while someone else made the bold statement: “Best action movie yet.” More fans said that they “cried while watching,” others branded it a “great” film while some said they’d “watched it many times”.\n\nOne Facebook user admitted: “This movie makes [me] cry like a baby.” Tears of the Sun was released over 20 years ago and follows a U.S. Navy SEAL team on a rescue mission in Nigeria.\n\nWillis plays Lieutenant A.K. Waters as the team attempt to rescue a U.S. citizen, Dr Lena Fiore Kendricks played by Monica Bellucci. The special ops commander takes his team in to the jungle to rescue her, but Bellucci’s character will only agree to join them if they rescue 70 refugees as well.\n\nTears of the Sun is one of the lesser known films in Bruce’s catalogue. The Hollywood actor became a household name after playing John McClane in the Die Hard franchise, which began with the first film in 1988.\n\nThe actor - real name Walter Bruce Willis - went on to land many more action roles throughout his career, including parts in Pulp Fiction, The Fifth Element, Armageddon, Red, Glass and Unbreakable. He also landed a horror-mystery role in 1999’s The Sixth Sense.\n\nWillis is one of the most recognisable figures in Hollywood and was previously married to actress Demi Moore. Sadly, in recent years Bruce’s health has deteriorated.\n\nThe Die Hard legend was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia back in 2023. His family made an announcement which left fans across the world completely heartbroken.\n\nHave you joined Threads? Follow Daily Star to keep up to date on all things showbiz here"
