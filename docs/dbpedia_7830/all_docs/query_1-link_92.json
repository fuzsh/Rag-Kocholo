        "text": "Bruce Willis and Emma Heming Willis\n\nBruce Willis’ wife Emma Heming Willis has spoken out about the “guilt” she experiences while dealing with the actor’s dementia diagnosis.\n\nThe Die Hard star retired from acting last year after his family revealed he has aphasia. In February, they shared that his condition had progressed to frontotemporal dementia.\n\nIt was then revealed last month that the actor was “not totally verbal” and was no longer able to read.\n\nEmma has been vocal in the past about her struggles with being a caregiver for her husband, and has now opened up about her experiences in a new open letter.\n\n“I struggle with guilt, knowing that I have resources that others don’t,” she wrote for Maria Shriver’s Sunday Paper.\n\n“When I’m able to get out for a hike to clear my head, it’s not lost on me that not all care partners can do that. When what I share about our family’s journey gets press attention, I know that there are many thousands of untold, unheard stories, each of them deserving of compassion and concern.”\n\nShe explained that, at the same time, she understands that “what I share matters to others who may be struggling, and in a small way makes them feel seen and understood”.\n\nEmma added: “It’s important to me to be an advocate on behalf of those families who don’t have the time, energy, or resources to advocate for themselves.”\n\nThe couple pictured in 2019\n\nThe NHS describes frontotemporal dementia as an “uncommon type of dementia that causes problems with behaviour and language”.\n\nBruce shares two daughters with Emma, Evelyn, aged nine, and 11-year-old Mabel. He also has three daughters with ex-wife Demi Moore, Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 29.\n\nThe families have come together on numerous occasions to support Bruce, including celebrating his birthday earlier this year.\n\nBack in September, Emma’s stepdaughters showed their support after she offered a heartbreaking update on Bruce’s condition.\n\n“Emma you are such a champion for this cause and you inspire me EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY with your bravery and deep loving,” Scout shared on her Instagram stories.\n\nIn August, Emma posted a candid video about her approach to life since her husband’s dementia diagnosis, sharing that she has to “make a conscious effort every single day to live the best life that I can”.\n\nIn a recent TV appearance, Tallulahshared her own update on her dad’s condition while on The Drew Barrymore Show.\n\n“He is the same, which I think in this regard I’ve learned is the best thing you can ask for,” she said.\n\nREAD MORE:"
