        "text": "2003\n\nCity Locations\n\nLos Angeles, California; O'ahu, Hawaii (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nRanch, Riverside, Film Studio, Farm/Ranch\n\nLocation Styles\n\nPlane, Plane/Helicopter Style, Dilapidated/Neglected, Exotic/Tropical, Rustic\n\nAbout Tears of the Sun\n\nTears of the Sun is a 2003 action film directed by Antoine Fuqua, starring Bruce Willis as Lieutenant A.K. Waters. Set in war-torn Nigeria, the film follows Waters and his elite Navy SEAL team as they embark on a dangerous mission to rescue an American doctor, played by Monica Bellucci, from a remote village. The film is renowned for its intense action sequences, compelling performances, and thought-provoking exploration of the human cost of war. The film's authentic portrayal of a U.S. Navy SEAL team's operations is credited to Harry Humphries, a former Navy SEAL who also offered his expertise to the notable film Black Hawk Down.\n\nThe plot of Tears of the Sun takes you on a perilous journey into Nigeria, where a U.S. Navy SEAL team, under the leadership of Lieutenant Waters, is tasked with the rescue of U.S. citizen Dr. Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) from the clutches of merciless rebel forces. The film delves into the depths of duty and sacrifice, confronting Waters with a heart-wrenching dilemma when Dr. Kendricks insists on saving her patients before herself.\n\nTears of the Sun remains a compelling study of war's complexities and explores soldiers' moral choices in the field. It thrills with intense action and compelling performances from its lead actors. Above all, it is an emblem of Antoine Fuqua's directorial prowess and Bruce Willis' ability to captivate audiences as an action star.\n\nTears of the Sun Locations\n\nPrimarily shot in the enchanting locales of the USA, the film takes viewers through mesmerizing backdrops, beckoning travel enthusiasts and movie buffs alike. Most scenes were filmed in the picturesque Hawaiian Islands of O'ahu and Kaua'i, which were transformed breathtakingly into Nigeria's landscapes. Amidst popular tourist spots in Oâahu, like Waikiki Beach and Pearl Harbor, the film captures the lush Dole Plantation, the North Shore community of Haleiwa, the spectacular Manoa Falls, and the beautiful Maunawili Valley.\n\nThe iconic Kualoa Ranch, the filming spot of Jurassic Park, also stands as a testament to the heart-wrenching narratives from the movie. Along with O'ahu, the natural charm of Kaua'i graces the silver screen, featuring mountainscapes from the active shield volcano called Kilauea and the stunning Kilauea Falls. Interestingly, the iconic sunset scene that graces the movieâs posters was shot on this island.\n\nThe Tears of the Sun canvas extends to the urban panorama of Los Angeles, California, adding a diverse cinematic flavor. And not to forget the USS Harry S. Truman Aircraft Carrier in Virginia, which became the first-ever to host a significant movie production. Whether you're reminiscing the intense scenes from the movie or simply being awe-struck by the stunning locales, a trip to these filming locations will be a rewarding experience.\n\nA group of SH-60B Seahawk helicopters approached the USS Harry S. Truman, stationed off the coast of Africa. A news reporter on the flight deck is providing updates about an ongoing coup when he's interrupted by news of the assassination of the entire presidential family by rebel forces.\n\nThis scene was captured on the currently active USS Harry S. Truman, which was positioned 60 miles from Cape Hatteras in the Atlantic Ocean. Director Antoine Fuqua was granted unprecedented access to this Nimitz Class nuclear aircraft carrier, with filming taking place over several days. The Navy even circled the carrier numerous times to achieve optimal lighting conditions for Fuqua. To ensure smooth operations and prevent potential crises, naval officers and soldiers were always present on set; some even appeared as extras in the film.\n\nWhile the USS Harry S. Truman is not open for public visits, film enthusiasts are encouraged to visit Cape Hatteras instead. This location offers long stretches of beach, marshes, sand dunes, and maritime forests, creating a unique environment where wind and waves continuously shape the topography.\n\nTo reach Cape Hatteras, your journey could start with a flight landing at Dare County Regional Airport. From there, it's suggested to rent a vehicle and enjoy a one-hour drive through stunning landscapes to the Cape. If driving isn't an option, local bus services are also available.\n\nThe team is instructed to Halo Jump over Cameroon and into the wilderness outside a small Catholic mission and tasked with finding Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks (Monica Bellucci), an American citizen by marriage. Their secondary mission involves the possible extraction of the priest and two nuns operating the mission, provided they agree to leave with them.\n\nThe film crew selected several indoor and outdoor locations to portray Nigeria's setting authentically. Notably, filming occurred at the Dole Plantation, located at 64-1550 Kamehameha Highway, Wahiawa, and in the North Shore community of Haleiwa in Hawaii.\n\nThe Dole Plantation, which has its roots in 1950 as a humble fruit stand, is now a significant attraction thanks to its famous pineapple harvests and the open-air Pineapple Express Train. Visitors can sign up for an educational tour to learn about Hawaii's fruit cultivation, its rich history, and agricultural practices. The tour culminates with a stroll through a giant garden maze shaped like a pineapple and lined with 14,000 fruits.\n\nTo visit these locations, one can fly into Honolulu International Airport. From there, both Wahiawa and Haleiwa are accessible via car. Wahiawa, home to the Dole Plantation, is approximately a 30-minute drive north from the airport. Similarly, Haleiwa on the North Shore is about a 40-minute drive from the airport.\n\nThe team led by Lieutenant A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis) finds themselves in a harrowing situation as they evade rebels in an African country. During their escape, they stumble upon a village being ravaged by rebel soldiers â villagers being executed, raped, and murdered. Seizing the chance to intervene, Waters instructs the refugees under his care to stay on high ground while his team descends into the village to confront the rebels.\n\nThis scene was filmed in various locations designed to mirror the war-torn landscapes of Africa. One such location was the Kualoa Ranch at 49560 Kamehameha Highway in Hawaii. This location, renowned for its appearances in the Jurassic Park series, helped bring authenticity to the depiction of the African country in the film.\n\nKualoa Ranch has been owned and managed by the sixth-generation descendants of Dr. Gerritt P. Judd since the 1970s. The ranch spans three valleys: Kualoa Valley, KaÊ»aÊ»awa Valley, and HakipuÊ»u Valley. Over the years, Kualoa has served as the backdrop for more than 79 films and TV shows, including Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island, Jumanji, and George of the Jungle. The revenue generated from tours and commercial activities helps keep the land undeveloped, preserving its natural beauty for future generations.\n\nTo visit Kualoa Ranch, one would need to get to Honolulu. From there, it's about a 45-minute drive northeast via HI-63 N and HI-83 W to reach the ranch.\n\nThe scene explodes into chaos as the SEALs engage in an intense firefight with hundreds of rebels hidden among the trees. Forming a courageous defensive line against the rebel forces, the SEALs direct the frightened refugees to fall back towards the safety of the tree line, where they can see the Cameroon border just within their reach.\n\nThis action-packed scene, along with others that required special studio effects or CGI, was filmed at the Hawaii Film Studio. The studio, located at 510 18th Avenue in Honolulu, spans 7.5 acres and is the only state-owned and operated studio complex in the USA. Its resume boasts notable productions such as Hawaii Five-0 and Magnum, P.I., adding to its reputation as a prime filming location.\n\nIf you plan to visit the Hawaii Film Studio, you'll first need to catch a flight to Honolulu International Airport. Once there, it's about a 25-minute car journey to reach the studio. The studio is conveniently situated just 15 minutes away from the bustling downtown area of Honolulu and a short drive from the vibrant accommodations, eateries, and nightlife that Waikiki offers. Visitors should note that access to the studio may be restricted depending on ongoing productions.\n\nOne of the most iconic scenes in the movie is the sunset sequence, which graces the movie's posters and promotional material. This breathtaking shot was captured on Kauaâi, another island in the Hawaiian archipelago known for its lush landscapes and stunning waterfalls. The radiant hues of the setting sun against the serene ocean backdrop create a visually arresting moment that stands out in the film.\n\nThe film also made use of the extraordinary scenery offered by Kilauea, an active shield volcano on the island of Kauaâi. The mountainscapes of Kilauea and the impressive Kilauea Falls are featured in several scenes, adding to the film's visual appeal.\n\nIt's worth noting that Kauaâi has been the preferred location for many other blockbusters, including Avatar, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, further testifying to the island's cinematic allure.\n\nTake a short inter-island flight or a ferry from Honolulu to reach the Oâahu and Kauaâi islands. Many tour companies offer guided tours through these film locations, allowing fans to walk in the footsteps of their favorite characters.\n\nThe film reaches its climax in the final scene, where the refugees recognize Arthur Azuka (Sammi Rotibi), the last son of a Nigerian king, as their legitimate leader. Amidst the celebration of his fellow Nigerians, he raises his hand and shouts âFreedom!â\n\nAlthough the movie primarily utilizes the scenic beauty of Hawaii, a portion of it was filmed in Los Angeles. Known for its dynamic neighborhoods, diverse ethnic population, and top-notch production facilities, Los Angeles has been a sought-after filming location for countless movies and TV shows.\n\nLos Angeles houses several legendary film studios like Paramount Pictures, Universal, and Warner Brothers, each providing visitors with an immersive behind-the-scenes experience. Additionally, Hollywood Boulevard is a location of great interest, featuring the Chinese Theatre that exhibits the handprints and footprints of celebrities alongside the Walk of Fame, which pays tribute to countless industry icons.\n\nThe main gateway to this buzzing city is the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), one of the busiest airports in the world and serves numerous domestic and international flights daily. Alternatively, you could drive if you're within a reasonable distance, as Los Angeles is well-connected to major highways like Interstate 5 and Interstate 10. Additionally, you can take a bus or train into the city, with services offered by companies like Greyhound and Amtrak. Once in Los Angeles, public transportation options such as buses, trains, and ride-sharing services can help you navigate the sprawling city and reach your final destination."
