        "text": "Actor Bruce Willis has frontotemporal dementia, his family has announced.\n\nIn a statement on social media, they said it was a \"relief to finally have a clear diagnosis\".\n\nThe 67-year-old was diagnosed with aphasia - which causes difficulties with speech - in spring last year, but this has progressed and he has been given a more specific diagnosis, the family said.\n\nThey expressed their \"deepest gratitude for the incredible outpouring of love\".\n\nThe family went on to say frontotemporal dementia is the most common form of dementia in people under 60.\n\n\"Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead,\" the statement said. , external\n\nWillis became a household name in the 1980s and 90s after starring in blockbuster films such as Die Hard, The Sixth Sense, Armageddon and Pulp Fiction.\n\nHe has also been nominated for five Golden Globes - winning one for Moonlighting - and also three Emmys, where he won two.\n\nBut his family said last year that Willis would give up acting, as his aphasia was affecting his cognitive abilities.\n\nThe new statement on Thursday said they hoped media attention would raise awareness of the actor's condition.\n\nIt said: \"Bruce always believed in using his voice in the world to help others, and to raise awareness about important issues both publicly and privately.\n\n\"We know in our hearts that - if he could today - he would want to respond by bringing global attention and a connectedness with those who are also dealing with this debilitating disease and how it impacts so many individuals and their families.\"\n\nThe statement was signed by members of Willis's family including his wife Emma Heming - with whom he has two daughters - and his former wife Demi Moore and their three daughters.\n\nDementia comes in many forms with different causes.\n\nThe word dementia describes the impact of a diseased brain on our memory, language and thinking skill.\n\nCommon causes include Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies.\n\nBruce Willis' diagnosis of fronto-temporal dementia is relatively rare.\n\nIt is also unusual as it largely affects people in midlife, whereas most other forms are found in old age.\n\nFronto-temporal dementia is caused by a build-up of toxic proteins in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain (those behind the forehead and ears) which are thought to kill brain cells.\n\nDamage to these regions affects language (such as Willis' aphasia) as well as behaviour and the ability to plan.\n\nThere is still no cure or even a way of slowing the disease down so symptoms continue to get worse.\n\nOn average people live 8-10 years after diagnosis of fronto-temporal dementia, but some people live much longer."
