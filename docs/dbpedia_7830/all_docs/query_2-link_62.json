        "text": "How many projects is Antoine Fuqua attached to?! Deadline is reporting that Summit Entertainment is in \"early talks\" with good ole Bruce Willis to star in a new prison escape thriller called The Tomb that might be directed by Antoine Fuqua (of The Replacement Killers, Training Day, Tears of the Sun, King Arthur, Shooter, Brooklyn's Finest). Summit wants to \"fast track\" the film, so maybe this will usurp Fuqua's other projects like Prisoners, Consent to Kill, Miss: Better Living Through Crime or the Gregory Scarpa Project. The good news is that the concept of The Tomb is actually pretty awesome, so I'll bite this time. Read on!\n\nThe Tomb will see Willis playing a character named Ray Breslin, who is the world's foremost authority on structural security. After analyzing every high security prison and learning a vast array of survival skills so he can design escape-proof prisons, his skills are put to the test. He's framed and incarcerated in a master prison he designed himself. He needs to escape to find the person who put him behind bars. Does that not just sound pretty frickin' cool? It's like The Rock meets Gone in 60 Seconds meets Law Abiding Citizen or something. And with Willis? Oh hell yea, bring it on, this sounds like it'll be badass! The totally original script was written by Miles Chapman and rewritten by Jason Keller (Machine Gun Preacher). Stay tuned!"
