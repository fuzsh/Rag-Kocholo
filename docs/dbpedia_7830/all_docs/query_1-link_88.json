        "text": "GRAND RAPIDS - Expect road closures - and a little bit of noise - over the next few days as \"Setup\" continues to film downtown.\n\nThe action movie starring Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson, Bruce Willis and Ryan Phillippe will be shooting a car chase and shootout sequence on the corner of Monroe Center St. and Ottawa Ave. Sunday. Monroe Center will be closed between Monroe and Ionia Avenues, and Ottawa will be closed from Pearl to Louis Streets from 7 a.m. To 5 p.m.\n\nTodd Tofferi, Grand Rapids' Special Events Coordinator, said the windows at Madcap Coffee, 98 Monroe Center, will be shot out for the scene. The coffee shop is closed on Sundays.\n\n\"They'll take out the old windows and replace them with stunt windows,\" Tofferi said. \"They're getting new windows out of it, so it's a pretty good deal for them.\n\n\"The noise will be limited to that one time, with gunfire and the windows being blown out.\"\n\nTofferi said the scene will be a minor car crash, and won't be as complex or disruptive to traffic as the car-chase sequence filmed in August on S. Division Ave. for the film \"30 Minutes or Less.\" He spent most of the day Thursday \"triple-checking\" with all the businesses in the area so they know what's going on.\n\n\"I told (the production) that if they wanted to shoot a scene like this, they'd have to do it on a Saturday or Sunday,\" he said. \"From an event standpoint, you want to close the streets as little as possible. You don't want to hinder business in that area.\"\n\nThe movie shot scenes earlier this week at the Gerald R. Ford International Airport and in Coopersville.\n\nIn addition, on Monday, Monroe Center will be periodically closed to car and pedestrian traffic for roughly five minutes at a time between 10 a.m. and 9 p.m. Pearl Street, from Monroe to Ottawa Avenues, and Monroe Center, from Ionia to Divison Avenues, will see full closure for short periods between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.\n\nFoot chases will be filmed Monday near the Grand Rapids Police Dept., Ottawa Tavern, the Ledyard Building and Tre Cugini.\n\nTofferi added that the weather and outdoor Christmas decorations won't alter filming. A request to remove the tinsel strung along the streets was abandoned when producers realized the big Christmas tree in front of the Grand Rapids Art Museum wasn't going to budge.\n\n\"They'll either have to deal with it or get a lot of money and CGI it out,\" Tofferi laughed.\n\nBruce Willis will not be part of these scenes; his appearances in the film will be shot primarily indoors.\n\n\"Setup\" stars Willis as a mob boss, and 50 Cent as one of a group of diamond thieves whose heist goes awry. Mike Gunther is directing the film. It's a production of Cheetah Vision, a partnership between 50 Cent and producers Randall Emmett and George Furla. This is the fourth Cheetah Vision film to shoot in Grand Rapids, including \"Caught in the Crossfire,\" \"Gun\" and \"Things Fall Apart.\"\n\nThe new film, which also stars Randy Couture (\"The Expendables\") and Jenna Dewan (\"Step Up\"), is part of a new $200 million, 10-picture investment deal for Cheetah Vision. Rumored to be budgeted at roughly $20 million, the movie will be released in theaters sometime in 2011. Emmett expects to film two or three more movies locally next year.\n\nOn Dec. 13, the \"Setup\" production will periodically shut down Monroe Ave. and Pearl St. near the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel during the day.\n\n\"The street might be closed for a little bit longer periods, but filming won't be as extensive,\" Tofferi said. \"We will keep traffic flowing.\"\n\n\"Setup\" isn't the only movie shooting downtown - \"House of the Rising Sun,\" starring Amy Smart and Danny Trejo and directed by Grand Rapids native Brian Miller, is a smaller production currently underway. Wednesday, Miller filmed at the Police Dept.'s motor pool, and scenes are scheduled to be shot at Taps and McFadden's.\n\nPrincipal photography for both films is expected last for approximately four weeks.\n\nE-mail: jserba@grpress.com"
