        "text": "Tag: Bruce Willis\n\nMy Life In Film: Part 35\n\nWelcome back fellow movie fans to a brand new year of My Life In Film… posts. I hope your festive season went smoothly and without incident and that you are now ready to face 2019 with fresh and positive eyes. Or, failing that, stumble into the new year with the same old attitude you’ve always had…just like me! Anyway, Part 35 has arrived and, with it, a slew of classic films to savour. Without further a do, let’s get down to business…\n\nROOKIE OF THE YEAR (1993)\n\nThis is one of those great family comedies that just doesn’t seem to get the love it truly deserves. Thomas Ian Nicholas plays Henry Rowengartner, who has always dreamt of playing professional baseball just like his late father. When he breaks his arm, he finds that, once the tendons have healed too tightly, he can throw pitches over 100mph! He’s soon drafted to play for the Chicago Cubs where he comes up against some strong opposition. While this film might not have been in the running for any major awards, it does have something that the majority of films don’t have – heart! The directorial debut of co-star Daniel Stern, Rookie of the Year is a great feel-good yarn full of hope and optimism, not to mention plenty of baseball action plus support from Gary Busey and John Candy!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The Have To\n\nTHE LION KING (1994)\n\nWith a brand new, live-action/CGI version on the way, what better time is there to revisit this classic, Disney original? Smashing all kinds of box office records on its release and scooping dozens of awards along the way, The Lion King is an outstanding achievement in cinema. The story of a young lion cub, Simba, who grows up believing he is responsible for his father’s death. Fleeing the pride, Simba goes on a journey to discover his place in the world and, along the way, makes friends and falls in love. With music by Hans Zimmer and songs by Tim Rice and Elton John, The Lion King proves that, while sometimes they falter, Disney quite often triumphs.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Stampede\n\nTHE MAN WITHOUT A FACE (1993)\n\nAnother directorial debut here, this time from action movie hero Mel Gibson. This tender drama sees Gibson cast himself in the lead role as Justin McLeod, a troubled teacher who befriends an equally troubled young boy, Chuck (an excellent Nick Stahl) and nurtures his potential to follow his dreams. McLeod, disfigured from an automobile accident in which another young boy was killed and for which he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, faces hostility from the locals when Chuck befriends him. Its a brave choice to make a film that is so against type but it works, mostly due to Gibson’s then ability to strike gold with almost everything he touched. You should really seek it out if you haven’t already.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nSPIES LIKE US (1985)\n\nEmmit Fitz-Hume (Chevy Chase) and Austin Milbarge (Dan Aykroyd) are two low-level government types who are chosen by the CIA for a top secret mission. They believe they are being employed as spies but, in reality and due to their incompetence, they are sent in as decoys. It is one of those really (really) silly films that you either get or you don’t. Chase and Aykroyd are, as you’d expect, just on top form as their 80s personas and, with direction from John Landis, Spies Like Us is all about the escapism!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Training!\n\n48 HRS. (1982)\n\nHere’s another one of those classic 80s actions flicks that pairs two unlikely stars together to form an explosive partnership. In this case we see Nick Nolte‘s gruff, veteran cop Jack Cates forced to buddy-up with Eddie Murphy‘s convict, Reggie Hammond as they go on the hunt for a killer. Director Walter Hill keeps all fires burning in this loud, action-packed comedy thriller. While some of the language used may offend some, it certainly didn’t deter from producing a sequel eight years later. Its dated, for sure, but it still packs a punch.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: I Hate Rednecks\n\nTHE LAST BOY SCOUT (1991)\n\nAnother unlikely buddy partnership here with this action thriller from director Tony Scott and writer Shane Black. Joe Hallenback (Bruce Willis) is a down and out private detective who teams up with down and out ex-quarterback Jimmy Dix (Damon Wayans) to investigate corrupt politicians and a crooked football team owner. As you’d expect from Scott and Black, the action and dialogue comes thick and fast and the chemistry between Willis and Wayans jumps off the screen. Its an underappreciated action flick that, I feel, deserves more attention.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Fifth Street Shootout\n\nCOOL RUNNINGS (1993)\n\nThe much-missed John Candy stars here, in one of his final movies, as Irving Blitzer, a disgraced bobsleigh coach who gets a second chance to prove himself when the son of a friend comes to him with a crazy idea. Derice Bannock (Leon) is disqualified from the Olympics and turns to Irving to help coach him and his friends to become a great bobsleigh team. Based on the true story of a team from Jamaica hitting the icy slopes of Calgary, Cool Runnings hits all the marks as a triumph over adversity and human redemption story. And with Candy on board, you can bet there are plenty of laughs, too!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: First Training\n\nLIVE AND LET DIE (1973)\n\nIn an edition that has already featured a couple of debuts, it seems fitting that this, the first appearance of Roger Moore as James Bond, should also be included. For the eight movie in the franchise, and following the departures of both Sean Connery (twice) and George Lazenby, the producers turned to Roger Moore to bring an altogether different approach to the role. With several agents dying, 007 is sent to New Orleans where he comes up against a powerful drug baron (Yaphet Kotto), a sexy tarot card reader (Jane Seymour) and some dangerous sidekicks (Geoffrey Holder, Julius Harris). Out of all of Moore’s Bond films, this is, perhaps, the darker and most loved. Here on in, the tone gets lighter, the tongue sits firmly in the cheek and Moore’s eyebrows raise the bar.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Meeting Mr Big\n\nTIMECOP (1994)\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme takes centre stage in this slice of sci-fi nonsense from director Peter Hyams. JCVD plays Max Walker, security officer for an agency that regulates time travel. He comes up against Ron Silver‘s shady politician who has some sinister plans for the time technology. This is one of those films that I absolutely hated when I first saw it but have since grown to love it for all its faults.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A suitably cheesy trailer!\n\nTOUGH GUYS (1986)\n\nHere’s a treat for you. Two legends of the golden age of Hollywood together again. Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster play elderly gangsters who, after being released from prison, find that they no longer fit in and so decide to show the world just what they’re made of. Its been a while since I saw this film so I can only go off what my memory tells me but I seem to recall really enjoying seeing these two old guys butting heads and taking no guff from anyone. Reportedly, the pair didn’t speak to each other on set but you can’t tell.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Foiling A Bank Robbery\n\nAnd there you have it. Another ten films to add to the ever-growing list. A nice little collection, even if I do say so myself. Congratulations if you spotted the Bruce McGill connections as well. If you like what you see here, please do feel free to get in touch, comments are always welcome! Until the next time…\n\n“He always did have an inflated opinion of himself”\n\nMy Life In Film: Part 32\n\nJust like another superhero movie you didn’t know you wanted, I bring you part thirty-two of this epic, movie odyssey. It feels good to be back in my ‘home territory’ of film after all those TV shows took over for a while. Mostly it is business as usual: blockbusters, classics and the odd curveball thrown in for good measure as well as a minor refurb of the homepage. Hopefully you’ll stick around (if you have already, well done!) and spread the word but until then, we’ve got work to do…\n\nTHE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE (1986)\n\nThere have been many versions of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic hero, Sherlock Holmes over the years but none quite like this. Basil, the rodent hero of the title, joins forces with Dr Dawson to investigate the kidnapping of a toymaker which links to a plot against the crown. It might not be to everyone’s taste as, sometimes, it comes across as a bit of a plod to watch but I think its a beautiful little film harking back to the golden age of the Disney animations. Not to mention that it features the voice of Vincent Price!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nWAYNE’S WORLD 2 (1993)\n\nAs sequels go, Wayne’s World 2 doesn’t stray too far from the original. It doesn’t need to. The formula worked so well that only a few minor tweaks were made in order to keep it fresh – more gags, more guest stars and more spoofs and parodies. Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) are still making their own TV show and, following a very vivid dream, Wayne gets the idea to put on a huge concert – Waynestock – where all the biggest bands will play. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Cassandra (Tia Carrere) is being wooed by her manager Bobby Cahn (Christopher Walken) for a new career in LA. Can our intrepid duo put on the biggest rock gig the world has ever seen and still save the girl? Wayne’s World 2 (and the original) is very much of its time but it still never fails to make me laugh each time I see it.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “I had the same dream”\n\nSUNSET BOULEVARD (1950)\n\nDown on his luck screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) chances upon the home of faded silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). An oddly compelling relationship forms between the pair as Desmond, still believing her star will shine again, employs Gillis to rework her comeback script. Gillis essentially becomes her live-in lover while trying to protect her from herself and finding himself falling for a young, aspiring writer. This Billy Wilder classic is full of snappy dialogue, jealousy, redemption and, for the time, a very unique way to tell the story. Holden is solid as the desperate writer but it is Swanson, portraying the faded movie icon, who dazzles and who was unlucky to miss out on Oscar glory for her performance. If you’ve never seen, treat yourself, it is a spellbinding masterpiece.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “We had faces”\n\nTHE ITALIAN JOB (1969)\n\nThis classic caper movie isn’t one to tax your brain. Its pure popcorn entertainment from start to finish. Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) is newly released from prison but it isn’t long before he’s called upon for “one last job”. This job, though, is a big one. Stealing a shipment of gold from under the noses of the Italians, in broad daylight, in Turin. The film is, perhaps, best known for its use of three Mini Cooper cars, in a patriotic red, white and blue, the starry cast and for Caine’s iconic line about blowing doors off. Its a fun, entertaining ride that keeps up the pace right until that ending!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The chase!\n\nSUPERMAN II (1980)\n\nSuperman II continues where its hugely successful predecessor left off with the super villains – General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas) and Non (Jack O’Halloran) are released from The Phantom Zone by a nuclear blast. The find their way to earth where they soon begin a reign of terror in order to rule the planet. Superman (Christopher Reeve) is soon on hand, though, in between romancing Lois Lane (the late Margot Kidder) and thwarting the plans of Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman). It is regarded as the better of the four movies with Stamp’s performance standing out as one of cinema’s greatest villains.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: General Zod vs The Army!\n\nDEAD POETS SOCIETY (1989)\n\nCinema has long been fascinated with stories about inspirational teachers. In this drama from director Peter Weir, we have one of the best in the shape of Robin Williams‘ English teacher, John Keating. At an illustrious prep school, Keating’s methods of teaching are maverick, to say the least, but they appear to inspire his class of students in search of guidance. Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard and Josh Charles are among the cast of aspiring students who take notice of Keating and, ultimately, stand up for themselves and their beliefs. It is a stunningly beautiful film with Williams giving one of his finest dramatic performances.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Carpe Diem\n\nTHE 39 STEPS (1935)\n\nFrom the novel by John Buchan and the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, this classic spy thriller will have you on the edge of your seat. Robert Donat is Buchan’s hero Richard Hannay who, while visiting London, gets embroiled in a mystery that sees him run for his life across the country. Hitchcock cranks up the suspense and drama to full tilt in this outstanding British noir (by far the best adaptation of the story) where Donat, in particular, shines as the put-upon hero.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Train escape\n\nROAD TO PERDITION (2002)\n\nDirector Sam Mendes‘ follow-up to his mega-hit American Beauty is a dark, brooding crime thriller based on a graphic novel. Tom Hanks plays a hitman who is forced to go on the run with his family after his son, played by Tyler Hoechlin, witnesses one of his father’s hits. Its a solid tale of loyalty and relationships told through the lens of master cinematographer Conrad Hall. With an amazing supporting cast that includes Daniel Craig, Jude Law and Paul Newman in one of his last screen appearances, Road to Perdition might not be to everyone’s taste but with performances and direction like this, it is hard to beat.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nTO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (1962)\n\nI remember reading Harper Lee‘s magnificent novel when I was at school and then, when I discovered there was a film already made I just had to seek it out. To Kill A Mockingbird tells the story of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer in the deep south during the depression, who defends a black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), a man accused of raping a white woman. The story is told through the eyes of Finch’s two children, Jem (Phillip Alford) and Scout (Mary Badham) and how the prejudice in their town affects them. Its a truly magnificent movie with Peck giving one of his very best performances and featuring an early appearance from Robert Duvall as Boo Radley. This is definitely one you need to see at least once in your life.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The children save Atticus\n\nDIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE (1995)\n\nJohn McClane (Bruce Willis) is about to have a very bad day in this third instalment of the hugely successful Die Hard franchise. Fresh from defeating terrorists in a high-rise and an airport, McClane is targeted by a German terrorist calling himself Simon (played with delicious pantomime villainy by Jeremy Irons) and threatening to blow up half the buildings in New York. With Samuel L. Jackson‘s Harlem shopkeeper, Zeus, inadvertently drawn into the game the stage is set for one of the biggest action films of the nineties. Original director John McTiernan is back behind the camera for this thrill ride that doesn’t stop from the explosive opener right through to the action-packed denouement. Yippee-ki-yay, indeed!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “You are about to have a very bad day”\n\nAnd there you have it, another batch of classic movies that I’ve enjoyed over the years. Another fine mix, even if I do say so myself and there’ll be plenty more where that came from as I put the finishing touches to Part 33. As ever, if you like what you’ve seen here today, please do feel free to get in touch and let me know. Until the next time…\n\n“Alright Mr DeMille, I’m ready for my close-up”\n\nMy Life In Film: Part Thirty\n\nHere we go, part thirty of my cinematic odyssey comes to you courtesy of a couple of legends and one of the most recent films to feature in the list so far. At the end of this there will have been 300 films featured. Not all of them are classics in the traditional sense but they are to me. As usual, My Life In Film… will take a short break while I return my attention to the next batch of television programmes that have made an impact on me. But before that happens, we’ve still got some work to do…\n\nCASPER (1995)\n\nBased on the Harvey comic and cartoon series, Casper sees Bill Pullman as Dr Harvey, a recently bereaved paranormal expert, move to a new town with his teenage daughter, Kat (Christina Ricci). Harvey is hired by the owner of a mansion who believes it to be haunted and wants the spooks gone so she can claim her ancestor’s hidden fortune. This is a delightfully enchanting film that doesn’t go too mawkish or sentimental and deserves a lot more love, especially for James Horner‘s beautiful score.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Kat meets Casper\n\nYOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES (1985)\n\nThis is one of those films that, over the years, has amassed a strong cult following. It’s not surprising really, being based (very loosely) on the youth of a certain master detective. Nicholas Rowe stars as the young Sherlock who meets a young John Watson (Alan Cox) while they are both at an elite boarding school. Soon they discover some strange goings on and decide to investigate, getting into all sorts of adventures. One great bit of trivia, this film features the very first appearance of a fully-CGI character, animated by Industrial Light and Magic and overseen by John Lassetter in an early credit for the behemoth that is Pixar.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: That groundbreaking piece of CGI\n\nCATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002)\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio takes the lead here as Frank Abagnale, Jr, a resourceful high school kid who goes on the run from the feds after defrauding millions of dollars, all in the name of recouping the money his father lost to the IRS. Doggedly pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), Frank poses as an airline pilot, teacher and doctor before being extradited for cheque fraud. Director Steven Spielberg brings a light, old-fashioned Hollywood-style to proceedings while still maintaining the pace of a heist movie.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Frank and Carl cross paths\n\nTHE FIFTH ELEMENT (1997)\n\nThis wild and colourful sci-fi adventure from Luc Besson (Nikita, Leon) sees Bruce Willis play a taxi driver who finds himself caught up in the search for a legendary weapon. It’s a visual treat for the eyes but sometimes falls short on plot and storytelling. Willis is his usual wisecracking, sarcastic, action hero self while able support comes from breakout star Milla Jovovich and recent Oscar-winner Gary Oldman.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Shootout\n\nTHE INCREDIBLES (2004)\n\nPixar movies have taken over the world and proven that animated films are often bigger and better than live-action. This one, featuring voice work from Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson, sees a family of superheroes trying to live their quiet, suburban lives but who get sucked back into the crime-fighting ways in order to save the world. Its fast-paced, full of action and comedy and is, quite possibly, one of the best animated movies ever made. This summer, after fourteen years, a sequel is finally due to be released!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “No capes!”\n\nEASTER PARADE (1948)\n\nIn this classic MGM musical, Fred Astaire plays Don Hewes who, along with his partner Nadine Hale (Ann Miller) perform a very successful dance act. But when Nadine decides to go it alone, Don takes it upon himself to train the next girl he sees and turn her into his next dance partner. That girl is Hannah Brown (Judy Garland) and pretty soon the two of them are the talk of the town. Its an age-old romantic musical with performances from two legends at the top of their game.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A couple of swells!\n\nCHEAPER BY THE DOZEN (2003)\n\nThis is one of those heart-warming family comedies that just make me smile. Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his wife, Kate (Bonnie Hunt) are at the head of a huge family of twelve children. When Kate has to go out of town for a book tour, it is left to Tom to take care of the kids. Although there is plenty of slapstick elements and silly humour, Cheaper By The Dozen is a good, old-fashioned comedy that warms the cockles of any a cold heart. A sequel followed in 2005 but this, to me, is the better of the two.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Preparing dinner!\n\nFOUL PLAY (1978)\n\nHere’s a comedy/thriller that seems to have been forgotten by many. It’s a film that doesn’t take itself too seriously while at the same time emulating the great films of Hitchcock. Goldie Hawn plays a shy librarian who gets caught up in a bizarre mystery that sees her fending off killer albinos and savage dwarves. With the help of San Francisco cop Chevy Chase, the two begin an adventure and soon fall in love. This film very rarely sees the light of day on television, I don’t think I’ve seen it for years, and is one of those rare movies that have slipped by the wayside. It’s a shame, because it is a great deal of fun.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nSWITCHBACK (1997)\n\nHere’s an interesting one. This film did very little to dent the box office or the rental market but, and I don’t know how, I discovered it on VHS and it has remained one of my firm favourites ever since. Dennis Quaid stars as Frank Lacrosse, an FBI agent who is on the hunt for his kidnapped son, taken by a dangerous serial killer who slaughtered the babysitter. Quaid is excellent as the distraught father and dogged investigator who will stop at nothing to find his son. Jared Leto, Danny Glover and R. Lee Ermey provide solid support in this sadly-forgotten thriller.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nBABY DRIVER (2017)\n\nI believe this is the most recent film to feature in this list of (now) 300 films. It’s not hard to see why. I’ve said before that Edgar Wright is one of the most exciting filmmakers of this generation, combining witty dialogue, sharp editing and camera work with banging soundtracks. With Baby Driver he takes this to a whole new level. Ansel Elgort plays the eponymous hero, a hearing-impaired getaway driver for a crime boss who gets coerced into driving one last job. It’s fast, sharp and exciting as you’d expect from Wright, but Baby Driver amps it up and is much more of a kinetic musical. Jamie Foxx, John Hamm and Lily James co-star in one of the most breath-taking films I’ve ever seen.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Chase scene\n\nAnd that’s a wrap on this edition, 300 films down already and there’s still so many more to feature. As I said at the start, My Life In Film… will be taking a break while I return to My Life In TV… but, rest assured, it will be back! If you like what you’ve seen here, please don’t hesitate to get in touch and spread the word, I’d love to hear from you. Until the next time…\n\n“Was he slow?”\n\nMy Life In Film: Part Twenty Eight\n\nNow the hustle and bustle of The Oscars has died down, it’s time to get back to business with this, the twenty-eighth part of my film odyssey. I’ve said in previous editions that I really enjoy these trips down memory lane and revisiting all the films that I thought I’d forgotten about (and some that, by rights, I really should have forgotten about!). This edition comes complete with some major Hollywood stars and at least two films that are a little…dubious. So, without further ado, let’s get to work…\n\nSPEED (1994)\n\nJan de Bont has spent most of his career as a cinematographer, working on Die Hard, Flatliners and Lethal Weapon 3, before taking the helm for this adrenalin-fuelled action thriller. Dennis Hopper plays Howard Payne, a bomber terrorist whose original plot to extort money failed when he was thwarted by LAPD officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves). Payne has an alternative plan, though, to rig an LA city bus with a bomb. There is only one stipulation: the bus must stay above 50mph and no passengers must disembark. Traven and his trusty partner, Harry (Jeff Daniels) forge a plan to defuse the bomb and catch the madman. It’s a high concept thriller that never lets up the pace and helped cement Reeves as an action hero and made a star out of Sandra Bullock.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nTHE MALTESE FALCON (1941)\n\nThis is a classic film-noir mystery from legendary director John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart. Bogart stars as Sam Spade, a private detective who finds himself involved with a series of criminals, beautiful dames and the search for a priceless statuette. Mary Astor, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet co-star in a tale of murder of deceit.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “Let’s talk about the bird”\n\nFLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR (1986)\n\nIn 1978, David Freeman (Joey Cramer), a 12-year-old boy goes missing, only to reappear in 1986 without having aged a single day. At the same time he returns, a flying saucer is discovered and soon the truth behind David’s disappearance becomes clearer. Cliff De Young, Veronica Cartwright and a young Sarah Jessica Parker co-star in this great sci-fi fantasy that has since become a cult classic.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nSAVING MR. BANKS (2013)\n\nMary Poppins is one of the most beloved Disney movies of all time but it almost didn’t get made. Here, the story of its genesis is told through the eyes of author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) and her determination to keep her story’s integrity no matter what. She is up against tough competition in the form of Hollywood magnate Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) who will stop at nothing to get the rights to her story. It’s a delightfully entertaining film with a particularly brilliant performance from Thompson.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nSTRIPES (1981)\n\nIn the eighties, Hollywood was full of this kind of movie. Slackers-turned-heroes, often saving the day and getting the girl. Stripes sees two such slackers, John and Russell, played by Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, who are dissatisfied with their jobs and decide to join the army. You know, for fun. Along with a rag-tag bunch of losers, the two friends end up defeating the Soviet Army and becoming heroes. Directed by Ivan Reitman and featuring a host of actors in their first significant film roles, Stripes is an old fashioned comedy that is a riot from start to finish.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “Willing to learn”\n\nRISING SUN (1993)\n\nWhen an escort girl is found murdered in the offices of an LA based Japanese company, it falls to detective Webb Smith (Wesley Snipes) and former police captain and expert on Japanese affairs John Connor (Sean Connery) to solve the case. What appears to be a simple matter soon turns out to be a lot more complicated than they thought. Directed by Phillip Kaufman (known for writing the Indiana Jones films) and adapted from the Michael Crichton novel, Rising Sun is one of those thrillers that manages to mix a formulaic cop movie with a political twist.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nCLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER (1994)\n\nThis is the third of Tom Clancy‘s Jack Ryan novels to be filmed following The Hunt For Red October (1990) and Patriot Games (1992) and the second to star Harrison Ford as the CIA analyst. Here, Ryan is drawn into an illegal war between the US government and a Colombian drug cartel. It’s a tightly-wound story that takes Ryan from the comfort of his office to the killing fields of Colombia. Once again directed by Phillip Noyce and featuring James Earl Jones, Clear and Present Danger is, in my opinion, one of the better Ryan adaptations and deserves more love than its predecessors.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Ambush\n\nNORTH (1994)\n\nOk, I’m not going to spend too much time on this one. It is universally panned and hated by most critics and film fans but I was always a fan of North. Directed by Rob Reiner and starring Elijah Wood as a kid, neglected by his parents, who decides to set off on a trip around the world in search of new ones. Bruce Willis co-stars as North’s guide, almost like Jiminy Cricket, who appears in various costumes along the way. It’s littered with famous cameos but it just didn’t hit the mark for everyone. I liked it.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nMY LIFE (1993)\n\nMichael Keaton stars here as Bob Jones, a man who seems to have everything he needs; a loving wife (played by Nicole Kidman), good job and baby on the way. Until he discovers that he has incurable kidney cancer and doesn’t have long to live. He decides to document his life on videotape so that his unborn child will have knowledge and wisdom as it grows. Yes, it’s sentimental and melodramatic but this is lifted by Keaton’s likeable performance as a man coming to terms with his own mortality.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nDON’T TELL MOM THE BABYSITTER’S DEAD (1991)\n\nI fear I may be scraping the barrel with a couple of entries this month, but I do genuinely enjoy these films and have fond memories of seeing them at the cinema. Don’t Tell Mom The Babysitter’s Dead is one such example of a movie that wasn’t too well received but is one that I loved when it came out. Admittedly, I haven’t seen much of it since its release, but I know I liked it! When their single mother has to leave town for a few weeks, she hires the sitter from hell to watch over her five kids. The sitter subsequently drops dead which leave the siblings to fend for themselves. Christina Applegate leads the cast in this funny and often silly comedy.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nOk, so a couple of those films will probably split opinion but, like I’ve said many times before, the films I put into each edition are there for a reason. I have fond memories of the period of time when they were released or the films themselves are just so damn good that I have to include them. For whatever reason, though, they’ve all brought back some great memories as I’ve delved deep into the dark recess of my mind! If you’ve enjoyed what you’ve seen here today, please feel free to let me know. I’d be particularly interested this month with your opinions on my selection of a couple entries (I think you know which ones!) so either drop me a line on here or come find me on Twitter (@Shadow_Chaser) Until next time…\n\n“Pop quiz, hotshot”\n\nMy Life In Film: Part Twenty Five\n\nAfter the horrors of the Halloween special, it’s business as usual for my movie odyssey as I try to compile the list of films that have, in one way or another, made significant impact on me. I’m making no excuses for some of the films that have already been featured and for the ones that are yet to come, not all of them are great classics and some will divide opinion, but for most there are specific scenes and moments that outrank the movie as a whole which is why some of the more dubious films are included. One such film is on this list, where the movie isn’t all that great but there are some moments that have meant it has stuck with me. Anyway, I’ll leave you to figure out which one it is. In the meantime, we’ve got work to do…\n\nBULL DURHAM (1988)\n\nI’m not the biggest fan of sports but I do enjoy a bit of baseball, even though I have no idea of the rules or scoring. Sports movies are a tricky thing to get right, they’re usually uplifting stories of the underdog fighting back against the odds and can often get quiet sickly and saccharine. Sometimes, though, a sports movie comes along that is a little bit edgier. Bull Durham is one of those. Kevin Costner stars as an aging baseball pitcher (there’s lots of those in the world of cinema) who is brought in to help Tim Robbins‘ younger pitcher get to grips with the game. Both men fall for the sultry Susan Sarandon, who is the team’s groupie and has a habit of hooking up with one young player every season. It’s a hugely entertaining film regardless of whether you understand the rules of the game or not.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nGHOST (1990)\n\nI remember going to see this film at the cinema with a friend and, once it had finished, we left the screening surrounded by people in tears. As two fifteen-year-olds we had no idea why. It was a pretty decent movie about a ghost with unfinished business. It wasn’t until I was much older that I ‘got’ Ghost. Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore) are the perfect couple who have recently moved into their unbelievably swish penthouse and seem to have everything they need. One night, though, Sam is gunned down in an apparent mugging where his spirit is left to wander the earth until he figures out who killed him. Viewing this film with a more mature mind and after having gone through grief it really resonates and becomes a completely different movie to the one I originally saw. Whoopi Goldberg provides an Oscar-winning performance as a fraudulent psychic who just so happens to be the only one who can see and hear Sam and damn near steals the whole film.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Whoopi!\n\nAPOLLO 13 (1995)\n\nMaking films about true life events can sometimes falter due to the public knowing how things turn out. What skilled filmmakers like Ron Howard do is to tell the familiar story but from different perspectives. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and the late Bill Paxton star as the astronauts on the ill-fated “routine” flight aboard NASA’s Apollo 13. There is limited media interest in this mission as the moon landing has already occurred, until something goes terribly wrong aboard the shuttle. The drama on the ground is amplified as we get up close and personal with the astronauts in a tense situation trying to survive.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “Just breathe normal”\n\nACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE (1994)\n\nJim Carrey has made a career out of playing crazy, slightly unhinged comic characters but none quite like Ace Ventura. He’s a detective that only takes cases involving animals and the biggest case of his career has just landed in his lap. The Miami Dolphins mascot, a dolphin called Snowflake, is stolen and Ace must investigate to find out who would steal a dolphin and why. Courtney Cox, Sean Young and Tone Loc provide support but this is Carrey’s showcase. It’s a riot and I don’t care what anyone else thinks, I love it.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Ace in Snowflake’s tank\n\nSTRIKING DISTANCE (1993)\n\nBy the mid-nineties, Bruce Willis had got the maverick cop act down to a tee. In this thriller he plays Tom Hardy, a former detective, demoted to the river police, who is on the hunt for a serial killer preying on women Hardy knows. It’s your standard action thriller fare with Willis phoning most of the film in but among the predictable stuff there are some memorable moments. Sarah Jessica Parker provides the token female support in a boys’ own action film that also features Tom Sizemore and Dennis Farina.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The opening car chase\n\nTERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1991)\n\nI’ll be honest, I’m not a huge fan of the Terminator movies but there is something very special about this, the first sequel to James Cameron‘s 1984 original. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the cyborg (an exact lookalike of the original sent to kill Linda Hamilton‘s Sarah Connor) who is sent back from the future to prevent the murder of John Connor (Edward Furlong) by an advanced cyborg, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). Cameron ramps up the action and uses the then state-of-the-art visual effects technology to provide us with a breath-taking rollercoaster of a movie.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “Do you know John Connor?”\n\nMRS. DOUBTFIRE (1993)\n\nThe very much-missed Robin Williams was clearly having a ball playing Daniel, the divorced father forced to dress as an old lady in order to see his kids. The way he lives and breathes Mrs. Doubtfire shows what a great talent he was and only emphasises the sadness of his early passing. Sally Field plays his ex-wife who has since started dating Pierce Brosnan‘s smarmy Stu. Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence and Mara Wilson play the three kids Daniel is so desperate to see but really, this is all about Williams and his tour-de-force performance.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “Could you make me a woman?”\n\nTHE JEWEL OF THE NILE (1985)\n\nThis sequel to the 1984 original sees Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito return in an adventure to find a fabled jewel. While not quite as good as the first film, The Jewel of the Nile does have some good set-pieces and manages to keep up the pace but it lacks the charm of the original. It’s still good fun, though and does feature the hit song “When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going”.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Jet Escape\n\nSPACEBALLS (1987)\n\nNot content with spoofing virtually every film genre already, Mel Brooks shifts his attention to the Star Wars universe with this cult comedy. Bill Pullman, John Candy and Rick Moranis star in this out of this world parody. Brooks’ skill at taking the well-known and slightly skewing it is evident here as he rips on every space movie ever made. While not universally loved as much as his earlier classics, Spaceballs does hold up as one of the best of his forgotten films.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Merchandising!\n\nAIR FORCE ONE (1997)\n\nI remember watching The Late Show with David Letterman when Harrison Ford was doing the promotional rounds for this film. Letterman dubbed Ford “Ass-Kicking President” and it’s not hard to see why in this action thriller from Wolfgang Petersen. Ford plays President James Marshall who’s plane (Air Force One) is hijacked by Gary Oldman and his band of terrorists. Marshall is an ex-soldier, though, so puts his military training to good use to get his plane back.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “Get off my plane!”\n\nAnd, another edition bites the dust. Certainly a couple of greats there and at least one that shouldn’t really be on anyone’s favourites list but I like it, so there! As the nights begin drawing in my attention naturally shifts towards the festive season. There will be a Christmas Special on it’s way, I’m just sorting out what’s going in, and a couple of extra Movie Heroes entries, too. If you like what you see here, and have liked my previous posts, then please do get in touch, I’d love to hear from you and feel free to share the love. Until the next time…\n\n“Houston, we have a problem”\n\nMy Life In TV: Part Nineteen\n\nHere we go with another eclectic mix of the great and the good (and the not so great and good!) of television past. This time around I’ll endeavour to recite the You Bet! rap as a special Brucie bonus for you all. Failing that, you could just sit back, relax and take in the sights and sounds of another trip down memory lane. With that in mind, let’s take a little stroll…\n\nWHY DON’T YOU…? (1973-1995)\n\nWhy don’t you just switch of your television set and go out and do something less boring instead? to give it it’s full, Sunday name was a magazine-style show for kids that was most often shown during the school holidays and featured groups of children responding to viewers’ letters suggesting games and days out. Usually made up of arts and crafts makes, the presenters would show us how to do stuff to keep us occupied during the long weeks. Some of these presenters would later go on to become household names (Ant McPartlin and Pauline Quirke). The show was perhaps most famous for its opening theme and animated sequence that foreshadowed the anarchy that followed.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: That opening theme\n\nBLOSSOM (1990-1995)\n\nOne of those American sitcoms that tried to mix serious issues with comedy. The results were quite often filled with schmaltz but I still remember it with fondness. Most of that is due to Mayim Bialik who plays the title character and who’s teenage life the series revolves around. She lives at home with her single father, Nick (Ted Wass) and her two brothers, Anthony (Michael Stoyanov) and Joey (Joey Lawrence). This show didn’t tax the brain but it was good fun and featured a great theme song by Dr John.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Theme tune\n\nUNCLE JACK (1990-1993)\n\nA children’s television programme with an environmental twist. Sixties pop star Paul Jones stars as Uncle Jack Green, an environmentalist and secret MI5 agent who, along with his family foils plot after plot of his arch nemesis The Vixen (Fenella Fielding). I remember this mostly because the title character had the same name as my grandfather as well as it being quite cheesy and having a pantomime feel to it all, like a lot of kids’ shows had in the late 80s and early 90s. There were four series with six episodes in each and following a different storyline but still keeping it’s finger on the environmental pulse. I think most people would be hard-pushed to remember this show as, like most of them, it has been largely ignored and forgotten all these years.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The first episode!\n\nNEW BLOOD (2016)\n\nSometimes a show comes along that is criminally underrated and cut down in it’s prime before it has a chance to show what it can really do. That’s the case for New Blood, a buddy cop drama with a difference from Anthony Horowitz that was sadly ended after just one brilliant series. Two investigators, Stefan (Mark Strepan) a junior Serious Fraud Officer and Rash (Ben Tavassoli) a trainee Detective Constable are brought together when their seemingly separate cases find a common link. It has a Lethal Weapon vibe with the two leads bickering at first but learning to work together in their unconventional style. I honestly can’t believe it wasn’t renewed for a second series as it was a breath of fresh air in a barren wasteland of bland, copycat cop dramas.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: BBC One trailer\n\nTHE HENDERSON KIDS (1985-1987)\n\nThe thing I remember most about this Australian drama series is that it featured a young Kylie Minogue. The series sees teenage siblings having to move from the city and forced to live in the country with their uncle when their mother dies. They make friends with the local kids and fight to save the land of their ancestors. A second series followed where the action was moved to a different location and featured a lot of new characters.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening theme tune\n\nGET FRESH (1986-1988)\n\nHere’s another one of those classic Saturday morning shows that often gets overlooked for some reason. Hosted by Gareth Jones, best known as Gaz Top, and Charlotte Hindle who would travel the country in their spaceship, landing in a new town each week. As usual with these types of shows there were guests, games and cartoons. They were joined by their puppet alien, Gilbert (voiced by Phil Cornwell) who had some dubious manners. For decades, both ITV and BBC fought for the most viewers on a Saturday morning with the BBC often taking the lead. Occasionally, though, ITV would produce such gems as this.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opening titles and a bit of Gaz & Charlotte\n\nSTREETWISE (1989-1992)\n\nA children’s television drama about the lives of a group of bicycle couriers set in London. It is, perhaps, best known for featuring an early appearance from Andy Serkis who played Owen, the owner of the business. It was a great show, filled with all the drama you find with a mix of colleagues and some great characters. One of my favourites being Troop, played by Garry Roost. It is yet another example of a good programme that has since been forgotten and deserves at least another showing on one of the many channels out there.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Sadly, I can’t seem to find any clips of this excellent series so if you happen to know of any please let me know!\n\nFRENCH & SAUNDERS (1987-2017)\n\nThere are some comedians who make sketch shows that just aren’t very funny. And then there are French & Saunders. Their show capitalised their talent for the absurd and brought us some of the best film and television parodies in recent years. With most double-acts you usually find the straight one who was the set-up and foil to the funny one who took the glory. With Dawn French & Jennifer Saunders they are both just as funny and straight as the each other. Their film pastiches are stuff of legend with Saunders nearly always bearing a remarkable resemblance to whomever she is imitating. Both are just as good apart as they are together and have had very successful careers away from the partnership but its this, and their take on the hit films of the time, that set them apart from everyone else.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Gentlemen Prefer Blondes!\n\nYOU BET! (1988-1997)\n\nA game show where celebrities gamble on the outcome of a challenge or a stunt performed by members of the public. The challenges usually involved feats of memory and recall, stunts and showing off skills. Three celebrities would champion a challenge each and the audience would vote on which way the challenge would go. If the challenge was unsuccessful then the celebrity would have to do a forfeit which would either be done there and then in the studio or filmed and shown the following week. Originally hosted by Sir Bruce Forsyth complete with his own You Bet! rap, the show evolved slightly and was later hosted by Matthew Kelly and finally Darren Day.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A full episode!\n\nMOONLIGHTING (1985-1989)\n\nA former model and a smart-aleck detective join forces to run a private investigation firm. The words ‘quirky’ and ‘offbeat’ are often used to describe programmes that you just can’t put an adjective to. Moonlighting is one of those shows. Yes, it’s a detective drama while at the same time being a comedy and romance. But there is a surreal undertone to the proceedings which adds to the quirkiness of things. The real magic of the show, though, is the chemistry between the two stars Cybill Shepherd and a pre-superstardom Bruce Willis. Their will-they-won’t-they relationship kept viewers hooked over five series. Add in one of the all-time best theme songs ever and you’ve got yourselves a massive hit.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A nice little compilation\n\nWe’re rapidly heading towards the twentieth edition of this particular odyssey which means you’ve sat through 190 television programmes that are either long-forgotten (or should be) or current hits. A lot won’t be to everyone’s taste but isn’t that the joy in something like this? It would be dull if we all enjoyed the same things. If, by some chance, you have enjoyed this then please let me know – I’d love to hear from you. Until the next time…\n\n“In my opinionation, the sun is gonna surely shine”\n\nMy Life In Film: Part Twenty\n\nCan you believe it? Part twenty! At the end of this there will be 200 films in this countdown of my favourites. I was just looking through the list I’ve accumulated so far and was shocked to find a couple of absolute classics that I’ve missed! Don’t worry, that error has been rectified, so settle in for some more eclectic cinematic treats!\n\nKUFFS (1992)\n\nThis is one of those curious films that nobody else seems to remember, and there’s probably a very good reason for that! It isn’t the greatest film ever made, nor is it the worst (I’ve seen plenty of those in my time!) but it is an interesting one. Teen heartthrob Christian Slater plays George Kuffs, a guy who isn’t really going anywhere in life, who loses his job and finds out his girlfriend (Milla Jovovich) is pregnant. He visits his older brother, Brad (Bruce Boxleitner) to ask for a loan but Brad is suddenly killed and Kuffs finds himself taking over Brad’s police patrol special district (Yeah, I know!. Ultimately, this film (which was written specifically for Slater) fails because it doesn’t really know what it’s trying to be. It’s funny, slightly irritating (Kuffs talks to camera a lot!) but it does have some great music on the soundtrack.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The trailer!\n\nTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994)\n\nHere’s a classic example of the power of home video sales turning a relatively disappointing run at the box office into a massive, global success. The Shawshank Redemption, while only doing modest business in cinemas became a phenomenon that saw it nominated for 7 Academy Awards (sadly, going home empty handed) and continually atop Greatest Film polls. Based on a short story by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont, it’s the tale of two men, imprisoned together for many years who find solace and hope in one another. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are on spectacular form as are the rest of the stunning cast. This film will uplift you, even though the subject matter might not. It really is a sensationally brilliant film.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Opera\n\nWORKING GIRL (1988)\n\nMelanie Griffith is frustrated secretary Tess McGill, struggling to find her way in the world of big business in New York. When her boss, played by Sigourney Weaver, breaks her leg on a skiing holiday, Tess gets her chance to shine. She teams up with investment broker Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) to reach a deal. But then her boss returns! This wonderful comedy from director Mike Nichols showcases Griffith’s hitherto unseen acting chops and gives us a chance to see Ford and Weaver in rare comedic roles. To top it off, there’s the best Oscar-winning song ever from Carly Simon!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “A head for business…”\n\nBATMAN RETURNS (1992)\n\nIt was, perhaps, almost inevitable that Tim Burton would return to the dark streets of Gotham City following the huge success of Batman (1989). Michael Keaton returns as the Dark Knight and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, as does Michael Gough as his trusty butler, Alfred. This time around, though, there is more evil in the city in the shape of The Penguin (Danny DeVito), Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the delectable Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. It is an admirable sequel that sometimes falls apart trying to manage multiple villains (although not as bad as the later sequels) but on the whole it is just as enjoyable as the original.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Meow!\n\nSTEPPING OUT (1991)\n\nDid somebody say “Curveball”? Well, I probably wouldn’t have given this film a chance had it not been for my sister and her love of all things Musicals. It’s a surprisingly delightful film that only gets better on repeat viewings. Liza Minnelli plays Mavis Turner, a former Broadway star who now provides tap dancing lessons to a group of misfit performers, including Julie Walters and Bill Irwin. As they dance together, they begin to realise that they’re not that bad and find themselves taking part in a charity dance recital. Stepping Out delivers everything you’d expect from a great underdog story and lifts the spirits.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The trailer\n\nYOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (1974)\n\nThe brilliant, and much missed, Gene Wilder plays the grandson of the infamous scientist, Dr Frankenstein. He is a neurosurgeon trying to put his family’s legacy behind him when he finds out that he has inherited his grandfather’s castle. Upon arrival he discovers his grandfather’s notes on reanimation and soon the family legacy is brought back to life. Wilder wrote the script and offered it to director Mel Brooks while the two were working on Blazing Saddles with the stipulation that Brooks not appear as it would distract the audience. It is, quite rightly, a classic comedy thanks, in part, to the fabulous cast. Marty Feldman as Igor (with his moveable hump!), Teri Garr as Inga and Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher, but it is Peter Boyle as The Monster who steals the show.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Puttin On The Ritz\n\nPIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003)\n\nWhat started out as a ride at Disneyland has turned into a leviathan of a movie franchise with a fifth entry due in cinemas any day now. This first film, though, is the best of the lot by far. Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner, a blacksmith who crosses swords with the eccentric pirate “Captain” Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and join forces to search for Will’s true love, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) who has been kidnapped by the feared Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush). This is swash-buckling at it’s best from director Gore Verbinksi and legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer. The quality of the sequels diminished but this original, and best, shows what Hollywood can do when it cares about a subject.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The first appearance of Jack\n\nFORREST GUMP (1994)\n\nAsk most people and they would probably tell you that Forrest Gump shouldn’t have won the Best Picture Oscar in 1995. Popular opinion would suggest either Pulp Fiction or the aforementioned The Shawshank Redemption should have taken the prize. That’s how it goes sometimes, The Academy “makes mistakes”. I’m happy it won, to be honest, because it’s a beautiful film, if somewhat over sentimental. Tom Hanks plays the eponymous hero, a simple man with a low IQ who just happens to have participated in some iconic moments in history. Sentimentality aside, Forrest Gump is a beautifully imagined fable reminiscent of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Director Robert Zemeckis uses every trick and technique in the book to bring Forrest’s stories to life while the supporting cast of Sally Field, Gary Sinise and Myketi Williamson add substance to his tales.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Forrest and Bubba talk shrimp!\n\nTHE EXPENDABLES (2010)\n\nThe Expendables is all-action, gung-ho, boys-own nonsense and I love it! Sylvester Stallone directs and leads an all-star cast of action superstars that cross the generations. The plot, inconsequential as it is, sees a CIA operative hire a group of mercenaries to eliminate a dictator and rogue CIA agent. The main draw, though, is the first time that Stallone share the screen with his 80s action contemporaries Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren and Mickey Rourke are among the other iconic stars taking part in the action. The two sequels (so far!) take the numbers higher and the quality lower, but that’s beside the point. The point is action and fun, and this film has both!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Old friends!\n\nSCHINDLER’S LIST (1993)\n\nSchindler’s List proved that director Steven Spielberg can do more than just fantasy and action adventure films. It’s a more personal film than anything he had made previously, focussing on the horrors of the Holocaust. Liam Neeson is Oskar Schindler, a usually greedy businessman who becomes an unlikely humanitarian when he discovers his Jewish workforce is being persecuted by the Nazis. Everything about this film is immense, from the black and white cinematography, the outstanding performances (Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley shine) to the heart-breaking John Williams score. The film garnered 7 Academy Awards, including the first for Spielberg, but it’s the film’s legacy – The Shoah Foundation – that is the true winner here.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The List Is Life… You need to watch it anyway as it stands as a learning tool for future generations…\n\nAnd there you have it – 200 films! There are more but, for now, this is where the list ends. I will be returning to it at a later date once I’ve gathered a little more research and searched the memory banks! I’m also looking into doing a shorter list of films that I really don’t like that much. It seems only fair to share the yang to my ying (or vice versa!). Until we meet again I’m off to reanimate a few corpses, maybe!\n\n“You poor guys. Always confusing your pistols with your privates”\n\nMy Life In Film: Part Eighteen\n\n“I told you I’d be back!” – Arnold threatened to be back and he is a man of his word, as am I. Part Eighteen already? I thought I would run out of films to include but that’s not the case. What I’ve found is, the further into the vaults I go the more films I remember and can’t believe they haven’t been included already. So, in the words of Beetlejuice: “It’s Showtime!”\n\nDIE HARD 2 (1990)\n\nThe original Die Hard movie was such a huge hit in 1988 that it was inevitable that a sequel of some sort would be on the cards. Two years later and Bruce Willis is back in action as LA cop John McClane, this time trying to avert disaster in a busy airport. Rogue military operatives have seized control of Dulles Airport in Washington at Christmas and are holding everyone to ransom. McClane is there to meet his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) off her flight when he stumbles across the terrorists and manages to find himself “in the same shit twice”. Director Renny Harlin, in his usual style, brings more bang for your buck to this all-out sequel and sometimes it loses its way because of this but it’s still full of the things that made the first film such a hit. William Sadler is particularly menacing as McClane’s foe and it’s nice to see some of the original cast returning.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: One of the spectacular action sequences – “Military funeral”\n\nTHE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE (1992)\n\nIn the early nineties there was a spate of thrillers featuring the very unhinged type of character that Rebecca De Mornay plays in this film from the late, great director Curtis Hanson. Peyton Flanders suffers a miscarriage following her doctor husband’s suicide after being accused of sexual harassment by a patient, Claire (Annabella Sciorra). Flanders blames Claire and sets out on a plan of revenge that sees her pose as Claire’s new nanny. The supporting cast is excellent, Matt McCoy as Claire’s husband and Ernie Hudson as a mentally-challenged odd-job man are particularly good but this film belongs to Rebecca De Mornay and her portrayal of a desperate woman looking for answers and someone to blame.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The trailer\n\nJFK (1991)\n\nOliver Stone always knows how to court controversy and create a debate about films and filmmaking so it was no surprise that JFK caused great rumblings when it was released. More than just a conspiracy theory, Stone’s movie is a work of art. Kevin Costner plays New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison who discovers there may be more to the Kennedy assassination than everyone believes. It’s an intense, in-depth portrayal of the turmoil that surrounded the shocking events yet still manages to walk the fine line of being a genuine Hollywood ensemble movie. The cast list is just as impressive as the film itself with brilliant cameo performances from Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, John Candy and an outstanding Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. It’s a long slog to watch, clocking in at over 3 hours, but it is well worth it.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer\n\nTHE BIRDS (1963)\n\n“There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it” One of my favourite Alfred Hitchcock quotes about his movies. It’s a quote the pretty much sums up his style. There was never that much blood, gore or violence in his horrors, only the fear of what was about to happen. Psycho did it best, but The Birds is right up there for me as one of his finest. Tippi Hedren plays a wealthy socialite who meets Rod Taylor in a pet shop and subsequently follows him to a small town where he stays with his mother and younger sister. Once she arrives, though, strange things start to happen and birds of all species begin to attack the people. There’s never an explanation as to why this bizarre occurrence happens and I think that’s part of the films charm. Sometimes, things happen that you just can’t understand.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: One of my favourite scenes – crows assemble in the playground\n\nSTAY TUNED (1992)\n\nIt seems fitting that two stalwarts of American television find themselves as husband and wife, trapped in a television set from hell and forced to take part in versions of the programmes they find themselves in. Pam Dawber (Mork & Mindy) and John Ritter (Three’s Company, Hooperman, 8 Simple Rules) are Helen and Roy Knable, a couple with run-of-the-mill jobs who are given the opportunity of a lifetime when a salesman knocks on their door with a state-of-the-art satellite TV set. It’s basically a chance to spoof some popular TV shows of the past and see how these characters play out in each one. It’s good fun, if a little lacklustre but to be honest, I haven’t seen it since I saw it at the cinema so my opinion might be completely different if I watched it again!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The trailer\n\nON THE TOWN (1949)\n\nGene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin play three sailors on 24-hour shore leave in New York City where they hope to find fun and romance. What sets this apart from most other musicals of that era is the fact that it went out on location to film scenes rather than use sets. This is evident is the famous opening song-and-dance number where our three heroes take a sight-seeing tour of the city. It’s vibrant, bold and still holds up after all these years.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: That opening scene\n\nGOLDENEYE (1995)\n\nYou could almost look at Goldeneye as a twist of fate for Pierce Brosnan. He was originally approached to play James Bond when Roger Moore retired after A View To A Kill but lost out due to his contract on Remington Steele. As we know, Timothy Dalton got the part and played 007 in two films until the franchise ran into legal problems, hence the six year gap between Licence To Kill and this. Bond is assigned to retrieve stolen access codes for a top secret space weapon, “Goldeneye”, but he is hampered by a villain (Sean Bean) who anticipates his every move and has a deeper reason for wanting Bond dead. It’s a great return for the franchise and Brosnan was always going to make a great Bond but it does fail at times to bring the humour of the original films. This film also marks the first appearance of Judi Dench as ‘M’.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The breath-taking opening sequence\n\nTOY SOLDIERS (1991)\n\nA group of rebellious teens at a prestigious boarding school face off against a bunch of terrorists in this popcorn-treat of a thriller from director Daniel Petrie Jr. I missed this one at the cinema but thanks to home video I got the chance to watch it on VHS many times and wasn’t quite sure why it wasn’t a success. Sean Astin and Wil Wheaton lead the group of rebels against Andrew Divoff and his terrorists. There is also fine support from Louis Gossett Jr and Denholm Elliott. If you haven’t already, you should check it out if you can, it’s a great little action flick that deserves a wider audience.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The trailer\n\nKILL BILL: VOL. 1 (2003)\n\nA brash, bloody and violent tale of revenge from Quentin Tarantino. Uma Thurman stars as ‘The Bride’ a former member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad lead by her lover, Bill (David Carradine). Once she fell pregnant she decided to leave this violent world and fled to Texas where she fell in love and, on the day of her wedding, is gunned down by a jealous Bill and his squad. Four years later ‘The Bride’ wakes from her coma with only revenge on her mind. Tarantino is a master at the quirky dialogue and violent action sequences and this film has plenty of both.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The Bride vs O’Ren – warning, there be violence!\n\nTHE CASTLE (1997)\n\nThis delightfully funny and touching Australian film crept under the radar back in 1997. I first became aware of it thanks to Johnny Vaughan and Liza Tarbuck on The Big Breakfast discussing it and quoting lines from the film to each other. We rented it on VHS and were not disappointed. It’s quirky, very funny and instantly a cult classic. It’s the classic David & Goliath tale of a normal, working class family forced to take on the bigwigs at City Hall who want their house for expansion. You must watch this film at least once in your life. It will lift your spirits like nothing else.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: House valuation\n\nIn the blink of an eye, another batch of films bites the dust. Looking back at this particular grouping and I notice most of them are from the 1990s – a prolific period of time in my cinema-viewing life. Yet, there are still SO many more films still to come, these lists just keep getting longer after every post. If you enjoy these blog posts, please get in touch and let me know – I really would love to hear from you. “Get your hands off it, Daryl”\n\nMy Life In Film: Part Sixteen\n\n“This means something. This is important” Well, at least that’s what I keep telling myself. It might not be moving any earth or shaking any trees but this countdown of my favourite films certainly means something to me. It’s giving me a focus, a purpose if you will. Like I’ve said before, I’m really enjoying revisiting these classics and sharing them with you. Even if you’re not actually reading any of this!\n\nPULSE (1988)\n\nThis is one of those films I’m going to file under “nobody else remembers this”. I first saw it when it was tucked away in the late-night schedule and immediately loved it. I think I’ve only seen it once since then and haven’t seen it shown anywhere else. There’s an unseen, electrical force taking out whole neighbourhood’s and taking lives. Joey Lawrence plays David, a young boy visiting his father (future star of Face Is Familiar… Cliff De Young) and new stepmother (Roxanne Hart) when he discovers this strange force is out to harm him and his family.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Trailer – “Spooky, ain’t it?”\n\nUNBREAKABLE (2000)\n\nFollowing the success of The Sixth Sense, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan brought us another suspense thriller. Bruce Willis is David Dunn, the sole survivor of a massive train wreck who walks away without a single scratch on him. Samuel L. Jackson‘s mysterious Elijah Price has a strange theory as to why this happened to him. As in his previous film, Shyamalan weaves a seemingly simple story that captivates right through until the twisty final act.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Comic Book Store\n\nTHE ROCKETEER (1991)\n\nLong before comic books spawned a thousand blockbuster movies, this pulp graphic novel hero reached for the stars. It’s a 1930s Hollywood complete with Nazi spies, gangsters and a young pilot (Bill Campbell) who stumbles across a top secret jet pack that allows him to become a masked hero. With the help of his friend/mentor (played by Alan Arkin) he rescues his girl (Jennifer Connelly) from the clutches of Neville Sinclair (a deliciously hammy Timothy Dalton) and takes to the skies as The Rocketeer.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A daring rescue\n\nTOY STORY (1995)\n\nIt’s a common sight now but back in 1995 Toy Story was the first full-length computer animated film. And what a film it is! Woody (Tom Hanks) is Andy’s favourite toy but then, for his birthday, Andy is given the all-singing-all-dancing Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). Trouble is, Buzz isn’t aware that he’s a toy – he thinks he’s a real space ranger. The drama comes from Woody’s jealousy which leads the two of them lost in the big, wide world and needing to work together to get home. Toy Story is an absolute joy of a film and a landmark in modern cinema.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “You are a toy!”\n\nAUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY (1997)\n\nEssentially, this is a love letter to the British spy films of the sixties from Mike Myers (Wayne’s World). Austin Powers is a super-hip spy in swinging sixties London who is cryogenically frozen and awoken 30 years later in a radically different world in order to defeat his nemesis Dr Evil. Myers plays both Powers and Dr Evil with great energy and humour and sends up the spy film brilliantly without making fun of it. Support comes in the form of Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York and the brilliant Robert Wagner, whose performance is a revelation.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Myers having fun as Dr Evil\n\nRANSOM (1996)\n\nThis gripping thriller from director Ron Howard sees the son of millionaire businessman Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) kidnapped and held for ransom. At first Tom works alongside the police but soon takes matters into his own hands. Gibson is great as the desperate father willing to do anything to get his son back. Rene Russo and Gary Sinise provide excellent support but this is really Gibson’s movie which grabs with both hands.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Tom turns the tables\n\nINDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (2008)\n\nYes, this film has plenty of flaws but I love it! Almost twenty years since he cracked his whip in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) Harrison Ford returns as the man in the hat for an adventure that takes him further into the realms of the supernatural. During the Cold War, Indy is approached by Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) with a coded message from an aged colleague Harold Oxley (John Hurt) that leads them to the legendary Crystal Skull. Hot on their trail is Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) who will stop at nothing to claim the skull for herself. Although it does lack a lot of the heart of the original films, Spielberg does pepper the story with nods to the past including the return of Marion (Karen Allen) but, ultimately, it just doesn’t stand up as well with the others (Mutt’s character grates and the swinging through the trees scene is just stupid!). That aside, I enjoyed seeing Ford as Indy again (a fifth instalment has also been announced, due in 2020!)\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Indy’s back\n\nCITIZEN KANE (1941)\n\nMuch revered and usually found atop most Top Ten lists, this film is a work of genius from one of Hollywood’s greatest maverick filmmakers. Orson Welles plays Charles Foster Kane, a multimillionaire media tycoon who, upon his deathbed, utters one single word: “Rosebud”. This leads a group of reporters, including Joseph Cotten, to try and decipher it’s meaning and thus begins Kane’s story. Through flashbacks we see Kane’s rise to the top and ultimate downfall using many cinematic techniques that were fresh and new for the time. Welles was just 25 years old when he co-wrote, directed, produced and starred in this film and created an iconic piece of cinema.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: “Rosebud”\n\nJERRY MAGUIRE (1996)\n\nI’ve never really been a huge fan of sports movies but this one really caught me out. Tom Cruise stars as Jerry Maguire, a narcissistic sports agent who one day has an epiphany about his job and is fired for expressing his feelings about it. He decides to take his new sports philosophy and try it out on the only athlete who has stayed with him. Cruise is on excellent form as the self-obsessed Maguire who, along with Renee Zellweger takes Cuba Gooding Jr‘s football star to new heights. It’s a masterful story from Cameron Crowe about the human condition and what it means to be successful.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: An Oscar-winning Cuba Gooding Jr – “Show me the money!”\n\nTHE TOWERING INFERNO (1974)\n\nIrwin Allen was the master of the disaster movie, having already brought us The Poseidon Adventure (1972). Here we are in similar territory with a huge construct, poorly built and full of party guests, stricken by nature and threatening to engulf the whole lot. Paul Newman is the architect who discovers that while he was away his wiring schematics haven’t been followed correctly. Whilst at the inaugural party, a fire breaks out and disaster is only a matter of time away. Chief fire officer Steve McQueen leads the charge against the flames trying to protect the all-star cast inside. Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Robert Vaughn, Richard Chamberlain and an Oscar-nominated Fred Astaire are just some of the big names attracted to this mammoth project.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Explosions and panic\n\nAnd, as the smoke clears, we find another batch of cinematic gems to enjoy. Yet another eclectic mix, don’t you think? Each of these films is great (or terrible) in its own right and hopefully this is giving you the inspiration to view some of them for yourself. Or maybe you’re compiling your own list? Either way, let me know what you think of this group and I’ll see you on the other side…\n\nMy Life In Film: Part Thirteen\n\nLike another unwanted Kevin James film, I’m back! So far I’ve covered 120 films that have, in some way or another, inspired or moved me. There are still loads more that, if I was being a little more rigid in the organisation, would have been featured already. But, there is no order to this and I like it that way…\n\nFROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE (1963)\n\nThe second of Ian Fleming‘s James Bond novels to be filmed, From Russia With Love is seen by many as one of the definitive spy films ever made. Hot on the heels of Dr No‘s success and, once again, starring Sean Connery as 007 FRWL is a darker tale than it’s predecessor. Involving an assassination plot, double agents, white-haired killers and dangerous footwear, FRWL is a great Cold War thriller. Robert Shaw‘s Red Grant is a fine adversary to Bond but it’s Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) who most remember from this film with her fondness for a poison-tipped shoe!\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The tightly-wound train fight with Bond and Grant\n\nTHE LADY IN WHITE (1988)\n\nHalloween 1962. A young boy, locked in the school closet, sees the ghost of a young girl who was murdered and her killer. He soon finds himself being stalked by the killer and to the house of the mysterious Lady In White who might hold the key to finding out who killed the little girl. This is a superb little chiller starring Lukas Haas (Witness) as Frank who discovers that the killer might be closer than he thought.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The trailer\n\nSAFETY LAST (1923)\n\nAs a kid in the 80s, I used to love watching Harold Lloyd in a filler programme that showcased his stunts and comedy (catchy theme tune too!) but it wasn’t until I was much older that I really appreciated the talent that man had. Safety Last is probably his most famous due to the ridiculously breath-taking stunt on the clock face. The plot of the film sees Lloyd as a store clerk who organises said publicity stunt but, due to unforeseen circumstances, is forced to take part in the stunt himself. Lloyd was right up there for me, along with Chaplin and Keaton, but isn’t as fondly remembered as he should be. He was a true genius of early cinema and should be respected as such.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: THAT scene!\n\nATTACK THE BLOCK (2011)\n\nThe big-screen directorial debut of comedian Joe Cornish (Adam & Joe) this urban thriller sees a group of South London teens take on an alien invasion. This is such a great, fun movie that mashes up many genres to produce one of the surprise hits of the decade. Starring Jodie Whittaker and a pre-Star Wars John Boyega, Attack The Block deserves repeat viewing and to reach a bigger audience.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: The hallway scene\n\nLETHAL WEAPON 2 (1989)\n\nIt was almost inevitable that Riggs & Murtagh would return after the huge success of the first Lethal Weapon film. Once again, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return for Richard Donner‘s follow-up to the 1987 smash-hit. This time, the detective pair come up against some dangerous South African diplomats who are using their immunity to deal drugs and other illegal activities. Along the way they pick up a witness (the brilliant Joe Pesci as Leo Getz) and Patsy Kensit as a love interest for Riggs. Although not as gritty as the original, this still has plenty going for it, not least the chemistry between Gibson, Glover and Pesci.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Riggs on suitably nutty form!\n\nMURDER BY DEATH (1976)\n\nOne of a number of films released in the 70s and 80s to revive the old, dark mansion house style. The world’s greatest detectives and their sidekicks are invited to one such mansion to solve a mystery. From writer Neil Simon, Murder By Death crams in all the jokes and homages that you can imagine while the star-studded cast appears to have a ball playing these characters. David Niven, Maggie Smith, Peter Sellers, Eileen Brennan and Peter Falk to name just a few, but it’s Alec Guinness as Bensonmum, the blind butler, who steals the show.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Blind butler and deaf maid!!\n\nPHILADELPHIA (1993)\n\nA gay man, fired by his law firm because of his condition hires a homophobic lawyer in order to win a wrongful dismissal suit. In anyone else’s hands, this film could have been overly sentimental but it’s thanks to the skill and talent of the late Jonathan Demme that Philadelphia reached the wider audience. Tom Hanks stars as Andrew Beckett, the man dying of AIDS who hires Denzel Washington‘s lawyer to fight his case. Both actors are on top form but it’s Hanks who shines in the role that bagged him his first Academy Award for Best Actor. It’s not an easy watch by any means, but it’s an important film to see and one that lasts long in the memory.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: One of the most moving scenes – La Mamma Morta\n\nREAR WINDOW (1954)\n\nThere aren’t many directors that could have pulled off such a daring masterpiece as this, but Alfred Hitchcock did. And what a joy it is, too! James Stewart plays a photojournalist who, following an accident, is wheelchair bound and bored. He begins to spy on his neighbours to pass the time and stumbles across what appears to be a murder. He enlists the help of his girlfriend, brilliantly played by Grace Kelly, to be his ‘legs’ on the case. It’s full of all the usual Hitchcockian suspense and Stewart and, in particular, Kelly are just wonderful.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: A closer look…\n\nTHE SIXTH SENSE (1999)\n\nBruce Willis plays a child psychologist who takes on the case of a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) who “sees dead people”. The trouble is, these dead people don’t know that they are dead and just won’t leave this poor kid alone. Director M. Night Shyamalan creates such a creepy and chilling atmosphere in this film that for some, especially me when I first saw it, the twist at the end comes as a complete surprise. Willis’ performance here is a revelation compared to his previous action hero roles but the film belongs to Osment who is old before his years and deservedly received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the tormented Cole Seer.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: As iconic moments in film go, this is up there!\n\nWEST SIDE STORY (1961)\n\nAn award-winning adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Romeo & Juliet, West Side Story is an epic tale of two rival street gangs in New York. The Jets, lead by Riff (Russ Tamblyn) and The Sharks, lead by Bernardo (an Oscar-winning George Chakiris) can no longer coexist without breaking into fighting. Matters are made worse when Riff’s friend and former Jet Tony (Richard Beymer) falls in love with Bernardo’s younger sister, Maria (Natalie Wood). Fighting seems to be the only way to solve the rift between them, but that only leads to tragedy. This is a heart-stomping, mood-lifting, song-and-dance spectacular like no other. The winner of 10 Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress for Rita Moreno), West Side Story is a must-see movie, whether you’re a fan of movie musicals or not.\n\nWATCH IT FOR: Just one of the fantastic song-and-dance routines\n\nAnother eclectic batch of films, don’t you think? There’s plenty more where that came from – I’ve already started compiling the next list – so, if you fancy it, please drop me a line and let me know what you think of the 130 films I’ve showcased so far. Are any of your favourites in there? Are there any you think shouldn’t be there at all? Whatever you think, I’ll be happy to hear from you…unless you’re making nasty comments in which case I’ll just tut loudly and shake my head! Right, I’m off to have some red wine with fish…"
