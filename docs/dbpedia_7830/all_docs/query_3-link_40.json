        "text": "Yesterday marked the beginning of World FTD Awareness week. I will never forget the day that I learned what FTD meant in medical terms because it is the day that forever changed my life. After five years of bouncing around the healthcare system, going from specialist to specialist, test after test, my family finally had a answer. My Dad who was otherwise very active and healthy and in his early 60s was diagnosed with FTD -- frontotemporal dementia. The dementia of middle age, with average age of onset in the prime of your career/life of 50s. There is no effective treatment and no cure. I applaud Emma Hemming Willis as she bravely took to the Today Show, along with the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) CEO Susan Dickinson. She shared early this year that her husband, the much beloved and talented actor, Bruce Willis was diagnosed with FTD. As I watched her interview with Hoda Kotb, I was filled with many emotions. FTD is a cruel and horrific disease that progresses quickly, and it doesn't take long to learn what it is like to live with ambiguous grief. I remember my Dad becoming a shell of who he once was -- unable to walk, talk, dress himself, feed himself -- basically this disease robs you of your independence and dignity. Emma and I are both Gen Xers -- she is losing her husband while raising two young girls. I can't even begin to imagine the pain and suffering she goes through. Yet, despite how she is feeling, she made a choice to publicly share what she and her family are going through, and to use her voice and platform to raise awareness for this rare type of dementia. That is not an easy thing to do, especially so early in the diagnosis. I recall not even being able to talk about it, even with those closest to me. At the end of interview, Hoda asks Emma \"what do you think Bruce is teaching your girls now?\" Listening to her response and watching her, it is hard to not tear up. She says \"He is teaching them love, patience, resilience. Bruce is the gift that keeps giving. Teaching how to care and love -- it is a beautiful thing amongst the sadness.\" I made a commitment to myself years ago when I realized there was nothing I could do to save my Dad to continue to spread awareness and work on behalf of those with FTD to make a meaningful difference. It doesn't alleviate the pain and sadness, but it brings light to your life. Above all, I know my Dad would be proud of what I've done and will continue to do in the fight against FTD. Just as I know Bruce has to be so proud of Emma. I'm thrilled that the biotech community is now invested in research & clinical trials for FTD, something that wasn't the case when my Dad was diagnosed. My hope is that one day no family will have to endure what mine did and Willis family is doing. #EndFTD #frontotemporaldementia #neurodegeneration #advocacy #biotech"
