        "text": "Wendy Williams has been diagnosed with a form of dementia, according to a statement released Thursday on behalf of her caretakers.\n\nThe 59-year-old former talk show host was diagnosed last year with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia “after undergoing a battery of medical tests,” according to the statement.\n\nA look at the condition, which also affects the actor Bruce Willis.\n\nWhat is frontotemporal dementia?\n\nFrontotemporal dementia, or FTD, is a rare disease that affects parts of the brain controlling behaviour and language. These parts of the brain shrink as the disease gets worse.\n\nFTD usually occurs in people in their 40s, 50s and early 60s. It can affect a person’s personality, causing a loss of inhibition or inappropriate behaviour. It is sometimes mistaken for depression or bipolar disorder, and can take years to diagnose.\n\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\n“It's a really tough diagnosis, I have to tell you,” said Johns Hopkins University cognitive scientist Brenda Rapp. “Maybe you’re doing things that are bothering people and you don’t really understand why they’re bothering people.” That can be frustrating for everyone involved, Rapp said.\n\nThe disease often includes primary progressive aphasia, which means it's causing problems with language skills. A person with this type of FTD may have trouble finding words or understanding speech.\n\nWhat causes FTD?\n\nIt’s caused by damage to neurons, the brain’s information carriers, but the underlying reasons for a particular case are often unclear. People with a family history of the condition are more likely to develop it. But most people with FTD have no family history of dementia.\n\nCan FTD be treated?\n\nThere is no cure for FTD, but there are strategies for dealing with it. People might get speech therapy if they have the type that affects language. They might get physical therapy to improve movement.\n\nSome patients receive antidepressants or drugs for Parkinson’s, which has some overlapping symptoms with FTD.\n\nHow fast does FTD progress?\n\nFTD can be a long illness, lasting two to 10 years. People with FTD will need caregiving or nursing support as their symptoms get worse.\n\nTop health headlines, all in one place\n\n“The disease will spread throughout the brain,” Rapp said. “The rate at which it does that is extremely unpredictable. So it’s very hard to know ... how quickly someone will deteriorate.”\n\nThe financial burden on families can be immense. The Alzheimer's Association estimates it costs US$10,000 a year, on average, for the out-of-pocket health and long-term care for a person with dementia.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.
