        "text": "When I came across this podcast, I thought it sounded interesting, so I gave it a try. All but the final episode had been released by then.\n\nWow! After about 15 minutes I was completely hooked and didnât want to stop. Itâs like a great book you canât put down and stop reading. I had this playing while I did laundry, ran errands, everything.\n\nIâve never been a huge fan of Bruce Willis, but I always liked him well enough, as an actor. From Moonlighting to more recent movies, heâs funny, a little goofy and usually kicking butt. I always thought he seemed a little arrogant interacting IRL though.\n\nThis podcast gave a lot of insight into what kind of human being Bruce Willis is, and the way he perceives others, which explains a lot about the way he interacts with the world in general.\n\nAs a rule I donât look up information on actors or follow gossip shows, etc. Sometimes you canât avoid hearing something if itâs plastered everywhere, but usually I know nothing except what movies/shows theyâve appeared in.\n\nI say that to say this: I never thought Iâd be interested in hearing about an actorâs personal life, but because of the circumstances and the way this podcast is created and presented, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
