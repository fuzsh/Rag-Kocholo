        "text": "There are times when you think he really will - expire, that is, at the climax of an almighty shoot-out, with an unsightly penile engorgement like the victim of some auto-erotic strangulation fetish. The granddaddy, perhaps the great-granddaddy, of the Number One cut is back. Before Phil Mitchell, before Nick Hornby, there was Bruce Willis. As Detective John McClane, he first did a complete forward-roll-plus-handgun-aim onto our screens in 1988 in the action classic Die Hard, taking on \"terrorists\", which in those innocent days meant our very own Alan Rickman with a comedy German accent. Now, paradoxically, as so often in the post 9/11 era, the \"terrorist\" is a cautiously chosen apolitical American, no other nationality being deemed worthy of the contest.\n\nIn that first film, Bruce was 33, receding a little, but basically playing exactly the same part as now: the worldly, old-school tough guy. John had discovered his estranged wife was hurtfully using her maiden name, which triggered some macho displacement activity on a monumental scale. In this fourth movie (quatrequel? tetrequel?), his grown-up hottie of a daughter does the same thing. DH fans know that there's a testosterone squall on the way. Thankfully, fiftysomething Bruce does not strip down to his vest this time. This is action, after all, not horror.\n\nThat postmodern \"4.0\" alerts us to the fact that McClane is taking on some new-style terrorists. Timothy Olyphant plays a sinister ultra-hacker who wants to bring all US computer systems to their metaphorical knees ... and then, erm, take everyone's money out of their bank account. Or something. McClane is going to stop this hi-tech bad guy with nothing but a beat-up automobile, a couple of guns and a pair of old-fashioned American cojones, which, to quote Sylvester Stallone's sentimental description of his father Frank, \"damn well almost clang together when he walks\".\n\nIt's pure action silliness, and often enjoyable, with some tremendous free-running stunts at the top of the film. Olyphant starts by jamming the traffic-light computers, which causes an appalling gridlock right in the middle of Washington, DC. Perhaps he was inspired by that very hi-tech film The Italian Job, where the crooks do something similar to the traffic lights in Turin. That's just the beginning of his global domination plans, however. Top of his to-do list is taking out a nerdy good-guy hacker, who alone has the brainpower to challenge him. This is Matt, played by likable Justin Long, fondly remembered from the fratpack comedy Dodgeball. McClane has to protect this guy amid crashing cars, helicopters and planes, which rain blazingly to the tarmac all around him like hailstones.\n\nI have to admit I laugh at the traditional cute punchline that the action hero ridiculously tags to the end of a fight - cheerfully sent up in Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz earlier this year. After a terrifying shootout, McClane smashes a French villain out of a window, and the man plummets about a dozen floors to crunch onto a car roof, setting off the alarm. There's a split-second pause while we all wait for Bruce's smirking remark: \"That's gonna wake the neighbours!\"\n\nArf, arf. Sometimes the action mayhem has a kind of Zen quality to it, entirely detached from narrative logic. At one stage, Bruce attacks Olyphant's icy lieutenant Mai Lihn (Maggie Q) by driving a car into the office where she has Matt at gunpoint, and bulldozing her into ... an empty liftshaft. Huh? What? How? Where? Why? Did he drive his car along the corridors until he found the right door? At the wheel, McClane is elsewhere threatened by a low-flying helicopter. So what does he do? He judges the trajectory of a certain off-ramp, drives straight for it, and at the last moment jumps out of his vehicle, which is flung upwards and turns the helicopter into a fireball. Whoa! Later he will jump from an airborne truck onto the tail of an F-14 fighter plane - or perhaps he jumped from the F-14 onto the truck, I can't be sure. All the time, his smirk is in place, which at moments of extreme pain morphs into a wince.\n\nThere is one smart moment. One of the villain's nerdy apparatchiks sends a resistance-is-futile video message out to America by splicing together fragments of speeches by US presidents, from Eisenhower to George W Bush. Its techie-henchman author is congratulated by his colleagues, and he shruggingly replies: \"Yeah, I wanted to use more Nixon ... \"\n\nIt's quite a thought that Willis has been plying his trade during the tenures of so many of the presidents featured: Reagan, Clinton, Bush Jr. His career has survived the turkeys; he has shown he can play comedy and drama too. He was entitled to one more kick-ass action outing. But please, let this be the last. Anything more would be dying soft."
