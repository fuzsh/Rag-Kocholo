I remember when he was the father of Bruce Willis in Striking Distance I remembered I liked that Movie. He was also in The American President with Michael Douglas.\n\nAnd not to forget 'Management' in Burn Notice. A nice departure for him since he wasn't playing the father of any other character and while he was a bad guy, he seemed to be the one staying in between Michael (the main character) and the worse guys.\n\nPost by nas on\n\nHe was younger than I thought since he tended to play older characters.\n\nyes, I was surprised when I heard he was only 77 - tho' I remember hearing that a long time ago, and just forgot...\n\nhe had an \"old face\", and that's why he was good at playing \"Old Dad\"...\n\nin fact, when he played Frazier's dad in that sitcom he was, in fact, only 15 years older than Kelsey Grammer...\n\nkinda' like the actor Len Cariou (born: 1939) who plays the patriarch of the family in Blue Bloods...\n\nhe's not nearly old enough to be Tom Selleck's (born: 1945) dad, but he's another \"old face\" actor, ergo....\n\nagree, NewBe, it does suck! ðŸ˜•\n\nnas\n\nedit to add:\n\nthe man must've had a great sense of humor...\n\nhe was quoted as saying [about losing his British accent]:\n\n\"People say there's no trace of an accent anymore, and there isn't because I worked very hard to lose it. And the reason I did that is a British accent in America is a real status symbol.\"\n\nvery good, Mr Mahoney!\n\nPost by Llyan (Admin) on\n\nOne thing I didn't know was that he was born in England and didn't become a U.S. citizen until 1959.
