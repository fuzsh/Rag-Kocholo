        "text": "While many Americans may not realise the likes of Henry 'Superman' Cavill and Andrew 'Rick Grimes' Lincoln are actually posh Brits in disguise, the secret nationality thing cuts both ways.\n\nThere are plenty of stars out there who you may have assumed were as American as Donald Trump wielding a handgun made of chewing tobacco, but are actually… not.\n\n1. NATALIE PORTMAN – born in Israel\n\nThe Black Swan actress – born Neta-Lee Hershlag – actually holds dual American and Israeli citizenship, having been born in Jerusalem. She has an American mother (who's also her agent) and an Israeli father.\n\nHer parents met at a Jewish student centre at Ohio University, and they kept in touch after her dad returned to Israel. When Natalie was three, they all moved to the US. She said in 2011 that although she: \"really love[s] the States... my heart's in Jerusalem. That's where I feel at home.\"\n\n2. BRUCE WILLIS – born in Germany\n\nJa, Walter Bruce Willis was actually born in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany.\n\nHis father David was an American soldier, while his mother Marlene was from Kassel in Germany. The Willis clan moved to New Jersey in 1957 when Bruce was two, after his dad was discharged from the military.\n\n3. NAOMI WATTS – born in England\n\nNot Australian like you thought, aaaah. British!\n\nThe King Kong actress was born in Shoreham, Kent, and her maternal grandfather was Welsh. After moving around England and Wales as a child, her family moved to Australia when she was 14. She later found fame there and became close friends with Nicole Kidman.\n\nShe said of her background in 2014: \"I consider myself British and have very happy memories of the UK. I spent the first 14 years of my life in England and Wales and never wanted to leave. When I was in Australia I went back to England a lot.\"\n\n4. KEANU REEVES – born in Lebanon, is actually Canadian\n\nKeanu has quite the multi-cultural background. His mother Patricia Bond is from Essex, while his father Samuel Reeves is an American from Hawaii with Hawaiian, Chinese and English ancestry (Keanu is a big Two Ronnies fan, apparently).\n\nHis parents met while his mother was working in Beirut, and he was born in the city. He moved around the world as a child - including Sydney, New York and eventually Toronto. So not only is Keanu not from America, but he's actually a Canadian citizen.\n\n5. JOHN BARROWMAN – born in Scotland\n\nYou may feel like the UK has taken the Torchwood star under its wing as an honorary Brit, but he is actually British.\n\nHe was born in Glasgow and lived in Scotland for his first eight years. His father then relocated his family to the States, and John didn't return to the UK until he was 22 in 1989. Since then, he's become a West End star, TV presenter and actor, but he hasn't lost that strong American accent.\n\n6. JOHNNY GALECKI – born in Belgium\n\nThe Big Bang Theory star was born in Bree, Belgium to American parents of Polish, Irish and Italian descent. (So he's totally American. Just not born there.) His father Richard was in the US Air Force stationed in Belgium.\n\nThe Galeckis soon relocated, and Johnny grew up in Oak Park, Illinois in the States.\n\n7. MILA KUNIS – born in Ukraine\n\nLike her Black Swan co-star Portman, Mila only moved to the States as a child. She was born in Chernivtsi in the Ukrainian SSR (now Ukraine).\n\nShe has said that her family decided to leave the USSR as her parents saw \"no future\" there for their children. She arrived in Los Angeles at the age of seven, and her family only had $250.\n\nShe said in 2011: \"That was all we were allowed to take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees, which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my brother and I were at school in LA.\"\n\n8. CHARLIZE THERON – born in South Africa\n\nFor some reason, lots of people, if they know the Mad Max: Fury Road star isn't American, seem to assume she's Australian, but nope, she was actually born in Benoni, in the then-Transvaal Province of South Africa.\n\nAfter growing up near Johannesburg, she later moved to Italy as a teen with her mother. After modelling around Europe, she moved to New York and then Miami. She only became an actress after injuring her knee while aspiring to be a ballet dancer.\n\n9. KIM CATTRALL – born in England, and is actually Canadian\n\nShe's a Scouser! Sam from Sex and the City was born in Liverpool's Mossley Hill.\n\nWhen she turned three, her family moved to Canada and settled in British Columbia. She returned to England at 11 when her grandmother became ill, but moved back to Canada at 16. She soon moved to New York, where she still lives to this day.\n\n10. JERRY SPRINGER – born in England\n\nWhile the talk show king is an American citizen, he was born in London. Not only that, but he was born in Highgate tube station while his parents were sheltering from German bombs in WWII.\n\nThey were Jewish refugees who escaped from Poland during the war, and he grew up in East Finchley. His family immigrated to New York in 1949, and he has lived in America ever since.\n\n11. NICKI MINAJ – born in Trinidad and Tobago\n\nAlthough the bum-shaking rapper is now American, she was born in Saint James in Trinidad and Tobago. Her parents are Trinidadians of African heritage, and her mother eventually moved to The Bronx in New York to attend college.\n\nNicki joined her when she was five and she began pursuing a showbusiness career at a young age. As she said in 'All I Do Is Win': \"All I do is win ain't that the reason that you really mad, undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad.\"\n\n12. MISCHA BARTON – born in England\n\nThe OC favourite has British-American citizenship, as she was born in Hammersmith, London. Her mother Nuala is Irish, while her dad Paul is from Manchester.\n\nThe family moved to New York when she was five, and she became a US citizen in 2006 when she had already been and gone in The OC."
