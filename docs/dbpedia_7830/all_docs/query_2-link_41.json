On one hand, it's who we are as a family but also it's really important to spread awareness about FTD because we had no idea. And to advance and use, again, it's like the bigger version of what I'm trying to do.\n\n\"If we can take something that we're struggling with as a family and individually to help other people, to turn it around, to make something really beautiful out of it, then that's really special for us.\n\n\"Part of what's been really beautiful way for me to heal through this is becoming like an archaeologist to my dad's stuff, his world and his little trinkets.\"\n\nIn 2022, Bruce's family - including his other daughters Rumer and Scout, 32 as well as the 'Pulp Fiction' star's wife Emma Heming and their kids Mabel, 12, and nine-year-old Evelyn - announced he was retiring from acting after being diagnosed with speech and language disorder aphasia, with his dementia diagnosis then confirmed the following year.\n\nJust weeks ago, Emma - who married Bruce in 2009 - insisted that she still had \"so much\" to be grateful for as she cared for her husband.\n\nShe told E! News: \"I'm doing something that I'm super passionate about that gets me up out of bed.\n\n\"I get to be a mother to two incredible young girls. There's really so much to be grateful for and so many things that I'm happy about.\""
