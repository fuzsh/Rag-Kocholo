        "text": "Bruce Willis (born March 19, 1955, Idar-Oberstein, West Germany) is an American actor best known for his performances in blockbuster action films, particularly the Die Hard series.\n\nWillis was born in West Germany, where his father was stationed at an American military base, and the family moved to New Jersey in 1957. After high-school graduation he took a series of odd jobs before studying theatre at Montclair State College (later Montclair State University). He dropped out of college and moved to New York City, where he began his acting career with Off-Broadway roles and appearances in television commercials.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nWillis had a number of small film roles in the early 1980s before he was hired as a wisecracking detective opposite Cybill Shepherd in the television sitcom Moonlighting (1985–89). The show made Willis a household name and helped to launch his film career. In the action thriller Die Hard (1988), Willis portrayed the cynical but good-natured New York City police detective John McClane, who finds himself embroiled in a terrorist attack on a Los Angeles office building. The film was a major box-office success and helped establish Willis as a leading action hero. It also spawned the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990), Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007), and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013).\n\nWillis took roles in a number of violent and darkly comedic films, including Pulp Fiction (1994), in which he played a professional boxer who double-crosses a mobster after agreeing to throw a fight; 12 Monkeys (1995), about a convict sent back in time to investigate a virus that devastated humankind; and The Fifth Element (1997), a visually impressive science-fiction action film. While he continued to act in large-budget action films—including Armageddon (1998) and Tears of the Sun (2003)—Willis also appeared in comedies, including The Whole Nine Yards (2000). In 1999 he starred in The Sixth Sense as a psychologist who counsels a child who claims to see dead people. The drama, which was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, was a critical and commercial success. Willis reteamed with Shyamalan on the supernatural thriller Unbreakable (2000).\n\nWillis’s subsequent films included the stylized Sin City (2005), which was adapted from Frank Miller’s graphic novel series; the thriller 16 Blocks (2006); and the buddy comedy Cop Out (2010). He also appeared in the action franchises Red (2010, 2013), as a retired CIA agent, and The Expendables (2010, 2012), as an active one. The latter series brought together several aging stars of the genre. Among Willis’s other roles in 2012 were a lonely cop in the whimsical Moonrise Kingdom, a time-traveling hit man in the sci-fi thriller Looper, and a professional gambler in the comedy-drama Lay the Favorite. G.I. Joe: Retaliation, released the following year, provided another rugged action role for the prolific actor. In 2014 Willis reprised his Sin City role in the sequel Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. He played a mercenary in Barry Levinson’s musical comedy Rock the Kasbah (2015) and a kidnapped former spy in the action flick Extraction (2015).\n\nWillis later starred in the 2018 remake of Death Wish, a 1974 action film about a father who becomes a vigilante after his family is attacked. In Glass (2019) he reprised his role as a security guard/superhero from Unbreakable. His other films from 2019 included the comedy Between Two Ferns and Motherless Brooklyn, a crime drama set in the 1950s. Over the next several years he starred in a string of action movies that included Breach (2020), Out of Death (2021), and A Day to Die (2022).\n\nWillis made his Broadway debut in 2015, appearing in an adaptation of Stephen King’s novel Misery; he portrayed a writer held captive by an obsessed fan."
