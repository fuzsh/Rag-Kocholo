        "meta_description": "Marvel Studios has redefined the franchise movie, in part by finding the right balance between creating innovative films and retaining enough continuity to make them all recognizably part of a coherent family. The authors analyzed 338 interviews with producers, directors, and writers and 140 reviews from leading critics. They digitally analyzed each movie’s script and visual style and examined its network of actors and behind-the scenes workers. They argue that Marvel’s success rests on four principles: (1) selecting for experienced inexperience, (2) leveraging a stable core, (3) continually challenging the formula, and (4) cultivating customers’ curiosity.",

        "text": "The Problem\n\nIn the movie business, sequels seldom perform as well as the originals—with critics or commercially. That makes it very difficult to create a franchise.\n\nWhy It Happens\n\nWhen making sequels, filmmakers err on the side of caution in balancing continuity with renewal. As a result, they experience diminishing returns.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe, perhaps the most successful franchise of all time, strikes the right balance by (1) selecting for experienced inexperience, (2) leveraging a stable core, (3) continually challenging the formula, and (4) cultivating customers’ curiosity."
