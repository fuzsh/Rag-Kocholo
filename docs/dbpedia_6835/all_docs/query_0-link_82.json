The comedic script chronicles Jake and Abby’s retirement move to their Florida island dream home. However, Jake fears the dream has become a nightmare after he discovers the island’s naughty little secret, and it appears that Abby has much wilder ideas about their next chapter. The “Swingset” was a featured entry in the Arts Center Theatre’s Play Reading program in 2022 where it received a rousing reception and a decision was made to fully stage the show at the same venue in 2024. Tickets for \"The Swingset\" are available at marcoislandart.org/arts-center-theatre/ or by calling 239- 784-1186. Ticket prices are $25.\n\nFor more event listings, navigate to the Entertainment section and click on the SWFLA To Do List at marconews.com or visit the-banner.com.
