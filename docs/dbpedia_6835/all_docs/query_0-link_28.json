        "text": "My review for my first film I have watched is Apollo 13. Firstly, although they can't really go into space the setting was really detailed and it looked like they were actually in space. The reason I brought this up is because on most adverts that are set in space, don't actually look like they're in space and its only when the advert is at an end when I realize where there supposed to be. Also the film was quite tense and it had me on the edge of my seat. All of the moments in the film gave me some sort of reaction or emotion/feeling. What I like about it most is that it didn't go off to talk about all the science involved with actually going into space. The saddest bits of the film were:one:when they showed what happened on the first Apollo. Two:the explosion. The most tense bits were:one:again the explosion. Two:when they were coming back to Earth. The one only thing that I didn't like, was the fact that a couple of times I saw grass in the back-round but its okay because they can't actually put them into space so they probably just forgot to edit it out but I'm sure that I was the only one to spot it so it isn't that important. That is my review I hope you enjoyed reading my thoughts. MEGAN!!!!!!!\n\nPrint this review"
