The terrifying discipline required seems equal; in any case, interesting to compare.\n\n00\n\nMoondust: In Search of the Men Who Fell to Earth by Andrew Smith (bluepiano)\n\nbluepiano: Wolfe tells of the early and sometimes would-be astronauts and Smith of the later ones who walked on the moon.

It is this, the inner life of the astronauts, that Tom Wolfe describes with his almost uncanny empathetic powers, that made The Right Stuff a classic.\n\n.\n\n▾Library descriptions\n\nNo library descriptions found.\n\n▾LibraryThing members' description\n\nBook description\n\nHaiku summary\n\nCurrent Discussions\n\nNone\n\nPopular covers\n\nQuick Links\n\nRating\n\nAverage: (4.19)\n\n0.5 11 41.5 22 272.5 53 1173.5 384 3604.5 675 372\n\nIs this you?\n\nBecome a LibraryThing Author."
