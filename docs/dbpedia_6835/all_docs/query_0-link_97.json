        "text": "Movie Review\n\nDreams? Later, gator.\n\nSure, Tiffany “Rex” Simpson has dreams. She’s got a big list of ‘em, in fact—somewhere under the unwashed shot glasses, maybe.\n\nWhen Rex was a kid, even through high school, she was a little scientific dynamo—thinking outside the box, coming up with creative solutions, setting her little corner of Florida on fire. And she knew that all her talent and gumption and hard work would eventually send her to space. She wanted to be an astronaut in the worst way.\n\nBut then, another worst came a-calling. Her beloved mom died of cancer. Her dad was a mess. Rex turned town a full-ride college scholarship to hold things together back home. And by the time her father was ready to stand on his own again, Rex … well, it seemed like Rex kinda liked being home. She got a job as a bartender. She started wrestling alligators now and then. She could party with her friends any time she wanted.\n\nTen years later, she’s still bartending, still partying, still wrestling gators. A good life, right?\n\nBut then she and her best pal, Nadine, go to their class reunion and reconnect with a former classmate turned tech guru. And he has the gall to tell Rex that she was his inspiration. All throughout school, he was chasing to keep up with her.\n\nSo, Rex, what you been up to lately?\n\nWell, that serves as a sledgehammer of a wakeup call. Rex is ready to get serious and recommit to the whole astronaut thing. Sure, she doesn’t have a college degree in mechanical engineering or marine biology or, well, anything. No, she doesn’t have a lot of applicable work experience. And yeah, she can’t fly a jet.\n\nBut she has big dreams, and she says as much on her application form. And that’s gotta be worth something, right?\n\nUm, no. Nadine might not know a lot, but she knows that much. So when given the chance to look over Rex’s application, she decides to … improve it.\n\nNext thing Rex knows, she’s getting a call from NASA, asking her to join 35 hopeful candidates in astronaut training. Rex—not knowing Nadine’s exercise in fibbery on her behalf, is thrilled that big dreams do count for something! She can’t wait to become an astronaut! And when she and her fellow space travelers return after a trip to Mars or whatnot, she has all the skills to mix a really excellent celebratory margarita.\n\nSpiritual Elements\n\nRex isn’t particularly religious, but she has a deep and slavish reverence for the universe and its mysterious ways. She talks about how everyone and everything is made out of stardust, which she takes to mean that she’s just as worthy as anyone else. She marvels at the universe’s perfect balance, and she takes that balance to mean that—maybe—whenever one party ends, another must begin somewhere. (Her friends find this rather profound and sweet.)\n\nShe even theorizes that (I think) somehow, she’s already an astronaut: Because everything is energy, the universe bounces that reality (that she’s already an astronaut) back to her as an idea (that she wants to become an astronaut). Yeah, it doesn’t make sense to me, either, but Rex and the movie itself seem to buy into it, so maybe there’s something I’m not getting.\n\nOh, and in a moment of crisis, Rex even prays to the universe, too.\n\nBut she also has a vague sense that her mother is still with her. Rex talks often with her (even though her mom’s been gone 10 years), and someone reassures her that her mother is still around. (Whether he means that she’s now stardust herself, or whether it’s a bit more spiritual, the movie doesn’t let on.)\n\nRex’s father runs a touristy ghost tour business. “There’s been no actual ghosts—so far,” Rex notes. But Rex helps her pop manufacture “ghostly” occurrences for his paying customers: Banging windows, flickering lights, that sort of thing.\n\nSomeone may thank God for a safe landing (though the exact words were a bit hard to make out). The space trainees need to learn Russian; in class, one offers a greeting in the language to “your majestic celestial holiness” and offers her colleagues as a “sacrifice.”\n\nIn a postscript, we learn that one of the trainees underwent a religious experience and changed her name because of it (to “Dr. One Love”). A character wears a cross around her neck. Another kisses a medal he likewise wears. The Big Bang theory is mentioned. Someone hypnotizes herself to deal with several hours of isolation. A character wishes others “Godspeed.” Rex lights incense in a room near a picture of her mother.\n\nSexual Content\n\nRex and other female characters wear some moderately risqué garb that bares midriff, shoulder and cleavage. Nadine engages in a bit of twerking and exposes a lot of leg. Rex flirts with one of her NASA supervisors, a rather mystified Logan O’Leary. And when he reminds Rex that she’ll need to undergo a colonoscopy, Rex takes it as a come on.\n\nWhen Rex encourages Violet to cut loose and relax a little, Violet awkwardly notes that she’s seen “some cute guys.” And then she adds, apparently in case Rex is interested, “and girls.” A couple of female trainees marvel at Pam Proctor, the head of the program, and mention that she has the highest IQ of any astronaut. “It’s so hot,” one of the women says. “I’d so agree,” the other adds. (Both, incidentally, wind up in relationships with men.)\n\nA heterosexual couple kisses. A man proposes marriage to a woman. One of Rex’s male friends, whom we see in just a couple of scenes, dresses effeminately and seems to have long, painted nails. A male trainee dances with a female trainee at a bar, his head pressed into her chest. One trainee mentions that he’s divorced.\n\nViolet mentions that she self-publishes romance novels; her main character for most of her books is a woman named Gwendoline, and Violet sometimes narrates bits of her adventures at times. (One involves Gwendoline unzipping a man’s “compartment” and slipping inside. (At the time, she’s in her own tent-like isolation compartment.)\n\nNadine is pregnant for much of the movie, but apparently not married. There’s a reference to mating egrets and syphilis."
