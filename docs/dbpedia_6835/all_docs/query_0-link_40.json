        "text": "Try watching 55 space movies in a row and not feeling a little short of breath. It's not the most hopeful genre, as filmmakers grapple with the existential dread inspired by the endless vacuum of the cosmos. It's almost as if, when screenwriters turn their imaginations to the heavens, they're overwhelmed by all that nothing staring back.\n\nAt least that's how space thrillers tend to go; typically, there aren't many survivors. Fantasy space operas like \"Star Wars\" are more chipper, and space films based on Cold War adventures can be downright optimistic. Given that the subgenre is usually just retelling the facts of history, at least that feels like a hopeful foundation.\n\nSpace can kill a hero in many ways. There are asteroids, aliens, sub-zero temperatures, a lack of oxygen, and nowhere good to eat. But, for the most part, what happens in space movies is that, despite a myriad of practical dangers, humans turn on one another and make an already strenuous situation far, far worse. If you think of Earth as one big spaceship, then it makes sense that, as humans reach for the stars, we pack all our heaviest baggage for the trip.\n\nBrad Pitt just photographs better than other humans, especially when he's tormented and hurtling through space. In \"Ad Astra,\" Pitt plays a perfectly emotionless astronaut who's sent to a remote base off Neptune sometime in the near future to investigate a mysterious power surge that threatens humanity. It turns out that his father is the head scientist, but the old man has gone all Colonel Kurtz on the crew in this \"Heart of Darkness\"-like odyssey. Pitt is all stoicism and gloom in this gorgeous space drama, which critics enjoyed more than audiences. If you like the pacing and gravitas of \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" this movie is your speed.\n\n• Starring: Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, Ruth Negga\n\n• Director: James Gray\n\n• Year: 2019\n\n• Runtime: 124 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 83%\n\n\"Aliens\" is a triumph. Just ask Quentin Tarantino, who recalls seeing the film the day it opened at a Los Angeles theater, where director James Cameron was personally on hand to make sure the screening went smoothly. Tarantino was just a video store clerk in 1986, but he was also a notable local cinephile. As such, he had sky-high expectations for Cameron's sequel to Ridley Scott's masterpiece. They were met, and then some. \"We were expecting so much and it's giving us more!\" he recalled. \"This is as good an experience for an action movie as you can ever have in a theater.\"\n\nIn \"Aliens,\" Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) returns to face the Xenomorphs again in a rescue mission that goes awry. Cameron's script and suspenseful set-pieces make for a creature feature sequel that rivals the original for sheer space movie terror.\n\n• Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn\n\n• Director: James Cameron\n\n• Year: 1986\n\n• Runtime: 137 minutes\n\n• Rating: R\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 97%\n\nSigourney Weaver really is the archetype of the badass female protagonist. She's not the only member of the Nostromo's crew with smarts and guts, but she is the ultimate survivor. What director Ridley Scott accomplished in \"Alien\" is immortal; a deep space industrial crew accidentally brings aboard the perfect extraterrestrial killing machine, and movie history is made. It's not that Weaver's Ripley is fearless. We sympathize with her terror as the monster stalks her, but we really marvel at her ability to keep moving and keep fighting. If the terrible CGI often found in space movies has made you sick of the genre, revisit the real sets and practical effects of this timeless sci-fi horror masterpiece.\n\n• Starring: Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt\n\n• Director: Ridley Scott\n\n• Year: 1979\n\n• Runtime: 116 minutes\n\n• Rating: R\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 98%\n\nDepending on your tastes, \"Armageddon\" is either a blockbuster spectacular or one of the more vacuous efforts from cinema's most superficial action director, Michael Bay. I tend to side with critics who were bored by the melodramatic TV-ad sheen, but hey, the rest of my high school voted it \"movie of the year.\"\n\nNow that I've outed myself as a time traveler, let me say this movie about deflecting an extinction-level asteroid has a similar nostalgic glow as other so-bad-they're-awesome '90s disaster movies (\"Twister,\" \"Dante's Peak,\" etc.). \"Armageddon\" radiates the escapist charm of an American era when things were so good that Hollywood was forced to imagine that Earth's most pressing problems were giant rocks hurtling through space.\n\n• Starring: Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler\n\n• Director: Michael Bay\n\n• Year: 1998\n\n• Runtime: 116 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 38%\n\nThe passengers of the massive Mars-bound Aniara expected a three-week pleasure cruise. When their ship is struck with space junk, however, it becomes rudderless, and the only hope to get back on course is to run across a celestial body and use it as a gravity slingshot. As the passengers and crew realize there are no suitable spheres in their path, they begin to fear that this ark may end up just like the crumbling planet they left behind. As the years drag on, \"Aniara\" proposes that hopelessness might be as deadly as the void of infinite space.\n\n• Starring: Emelie Garbers, Arvin Kananian, Bianca Cruzeiro\n\n• Director: Hugo Lilja, Pella Kagerman\n\n• Year: 2018\n\n• Runtime: 106 minutes\n\n• Rating: R\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 71%\n\n\"Arrival\" is admittedly sparing when it comes to space scenes, but that's where the slightly elephantine aliens come from in this thoughtful and gripping sci-fi thriller. Besides, dealing with these extraterrestrials requires a full-on weightless space-walk in quarantine gear.\n\n\"Arrival\" argues that we humans might not be able to handle a collision with a well-intentioned and peaceful space-faring civilization. Amy Adams shimmers as a linguist brought on board by some government spooks to traverse the language barrier between the two species. \"Arrival\" is a puzzle-based procedural, but if this professorial protagonist gets lost in translation, the dangers of jumping to conclusions could be fatal for us all.\n\n• Starring: Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker\n\n• Director: Denis Villeneuve\n\n• Year: 2016\n\n• Runtime: 116 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 94%\n\n\"Avatar\" haters like to point out the story of the Na'vi tribe's plight to save their sacred tree from greedy industrialists is basically space \"Pocahontas.\" Visually, it has aged too, like any film with this many effects. Back in 2009, though, I dragged every earthling I knew to see \"Avatar\" in a theater, hypnotized by these blue aliens. I felt like an overwhelmed Joe Biden in this viral clip trying to sum it up: \"This new program ... You watch this science fiction thing unfold in front of you.\" Exactly!\n\nJames Cameron's enormous custom 3D cameras created an immersive experience that unfortunately looks like a video game when viewed on 2D monitors. \"Avatar\" is pure visual wizardly, but only when you see it in the appropriate venue.\n\n• Starring: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver\n\n• Director: James Cameron\n\n• Year: 2009\n\n• Runtime: 162 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 82%\n\nA few years back, Martin Scorsese infamously scorched the Marvel Cinematic Universe, declaring that it is \"not cinema.\" That's because nothing unexpected really happens. Immortal, sexless superheroes smash each other over and over in an infinite multiverse that has consequences. Spider-Man is incinerated by a cosmic snap of the fingers in one movie, and his next solo film is one of his biggest hits.\n\nBut \"Avengers: Infinity War\" has a spectacular vision of the cosmos as Thanos assembles the ultimate bejeweled MacGuffin — one Nintendo power-glove to rule them all! Josh Brolin elucidating this villain's logic of doom as he wipes out all consciousness transcends ordinary Marvel fare. His musings are staged in epically rendered CG environments, and he seems almost depressed by his own nihilistic reasoning.\n\n• Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo\n\n• Directors: Anthony Russo, Joe Russo\n\n• Year: 2018\n\n• Runtime: 149 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 85%\n\nThe famous astronomer Carl Sagan is the greatest science communicator who ever lived. Neil deGrasse Tyson did yeoman's work following in his footsteps — he even remade Sagan's famous TV series, \"Cosmos\" — but it's not possible to replace the OG celebrity scientist and his ponderous yet dulcet tones. Sagan also put his passion for thought experiments into \"Contact,\" a novel about an encounter with advanced aliens that was adapted for the screen by Robert Zemeckis.\n\nWhen a young astronomer (Jodie Foster) finds a strange signal in the sky, it's actually a code containing instructions on how to assemble a mysterious machine. \"Contact\" wonders if humanity could handle an extraterrestrial awakening, but ultimately embodies Sagan's optimism about the human project.\n\n• Starring: Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, James Woods\n\n• Director: Robert Zemeckis\n\n• Year: 1997\n\n• Runtime: 150 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 67%\n\n\"Don't Look Up\" is ostensibly another \"Deep Impact,\" a film about a big bad rock on a collision course with Earth. In reality, it's a global warming parable starring notable climate activist Leonardo DiCaprio. When DiCaprio's wonky astrophysicist tries to explain the Earth-shattering news, his dire prophecy is greeted as another piece of infotainment by two manic morning news buffoons.\n\n\"Don't Look Up\" has its politics, but spares neither side. MAGA stand-ins devolve into a conspiracy cult, while a seemingly left-leaning American president (Meryl Streep) cares only about her cratering poll numbers. Jonah Hill is also priceless as a patronizing chief of staff who you'll want to throttle with his own lanyard.\n\n• Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep\n\n• Director: Adam McKay\n\n• Year: 2021\n\n• Runtime: 138 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 55%\n\nSeeing \"Dune\" in 2021 was like reading an official press release claiming that Denis Villeneuve had supplanted Christopher Nolan as Earth's best big-budget filmmaker with a knack for magisterial sci-fi. Look, David Lynch was never the right choice to adapt Frank Herbert's brilliant and expansive 1965 novel. The failure of that first attempt partially explains why George Lucas has been so deified, perhaps without deserving it; Lucas has named checked \"Flash Gordon\" as an inspiration for \"Star Wars,\" but has avoided crediting the novel from which he clearly cribbed the whole evil space empire versus psychic savior premise. As such, Villeneuve's task was to remake \"Dune\" for a post-\"Star Wars\" world. Through visual innovation and his genius for portentous storytelling, he pulled it off.\n\n• Starring: Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac\n\n• Director: Denis Villeneuve\n\n• Year: 2021\n\n• Runtime: 156 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 83%\n\nIf you like space horror, \"Event Horizon\" is one intense trip to Hell. Ignore the god-awful critic's score. This movie isn't metaphysically any dumber than \"The Shining.\" Here, Laurence Fishburne plays an astronaut tasked with investigating the incredibly Gothic Event Horizon, a mysterious spacecraft that has re-emerged from a black hole. He taps the craft's eccentric creator (Sam Neil) to help explore this eerie ghost ship, and a sinister story soon emerges: Something sentient has come back from the beyond, and its malevolence unleashes a stylish flurry of terrors. The phrase \"event horizon\" refers to the point of no return that surrounds a black hole. Maybe evil is like that, too.\n\n• Starring: Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Kathleen Quinlan\n\n• Director: Paul W. S. Anderson\n\n• Year: 1997\n\n• Runtime: 96 minutes\n\n• Rating: R\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 29%\n\nThe ad campaign for \"The Fifth Element\" suggested that it would be a serious space opera, so it was disappointing when this goofy blockbuster premiered in 1997. Bruce Willis is great, though, as an NYC cab driver who gets an odd fare: a superhuman savior of the universe (Milla Jovovich). She's the elemental key to keeping at bay a dark force that's a lot like the Nothing from \"The NeverEnding Story.\" Gary Oldman is at his scenery-chewing best as the corrupted industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, who works in service of the darkness. At the time, \"The Fifth Element\" was the most expensive movie in European history, and the 4K version really brings out the crisp cinematography.\n\n• Starring: Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm\n\n• Director: Luc Besson\n\n• Year: 1997\n\n• Runtime: 126 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 70%\n\nIf Hollywood had been as quick to make this biopic as Neil Armstrong was to the actual moon, it might be considered the greatest space movie ever made. In \"First Man,\" Ryan Gosling plays Armstrong as the ultimate strong, silent type. He's a fearless, laconic test pilot tapped by NASA for its maiden voyage to the moon. Damian Chazelle's stirring tribute to one of the greatest-ever Americans explores the astronaut's grief over the loss of his young daughter and his coping mechanism: the most daring adventure in history. Chazelle's camera mimics the look of real film and caps the picture with stunning IMAX vistas at the climactic moment. This is an astounding achievement fully worthy of the history it commemorates.\n\n• Starring: Ryan Gosling, Claire Foy, Jason Clarke\n\n• Director: Damien Chazelle\n\n• Year: 2018\n\n• Runtime: 141 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 87%\n\n\"Forbidden Planet\" was made only 13 years before NASA landed on the moon, but the film predicts this feat will take place in the \"final decade of the 21st century.\" Soon after, \"hyperdrive\" will allow the colonization of deep space. It's interesting to see how wrong sci-fi was on that first count — and likely the second, given that physicists are pretty sure that light moves at the universal speed limit.\n\nStill, this is a great-looking color movie for 1956, shot in Cinescope. \"Forbidden Planet\" is basically like an episode of \"Star Trek\" with more romance and a less memorable cast, following an American crew as it investigates the mystery of a scientist and his beautiful daughter, long since missing on a far-flung alien colony.\n\n• Starring: Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, Leslie Nielsen\n\n• Director: Fred M. Wilcox\n\n• Year: 1956\n\n• Runtime: 98 minutes\n\n• Rating: G\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96%\n\nThere have been a number of attempts to make satirical versions of \"Star Trek.\" Seth MacFarlane's \"The Orville\" comes to mind, as does the Steve Carrell vehicle \"Space Force.\" Nothing, though, has been as successful as this loving yet sardonic homage to the compelling, campy goof of Gene Roddenberry's original late 1960s sci-fi space series.\n\n\"Galaxy Quest\" works by getting meta. The washed-up cast of a \"Star Trek\"-like show gets picked up by actual aliens who think their long-canceled series is a historical document, and that only this intrepid crew of TV actors can save them.

When \"Gattaca\" was released in 1997, Dolly the sheep had been cloned just one year earlier, so bio-hacking hijinks were at the top of everyone's mind. With later innovations like CRISPR, a genetically segregated human society like the world of this stylish art-deco thriller is suddenly feasible.\n\nIn \"Gattaca,\" Ethan Hawke plays an aspiring astronaut who borrows the genetic identity of an elite (Jude Law) to reach the stars. Before he can launch, however, an inconvenient murder brings extra scrutiny and means that he must face must down his biologically superior brother. \"Gattaca\" is a classic of the individual-versus-dystopian-oppression genre as it vividly imagines the cost of a world where DNA is destiny.\n\n• Starring: Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law\n\n• Director: Andrew Niccol\n\n• Year: 1997\n\n• Runtime: 112 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 81%\n\n\"Gravity\" is like a 90-minute free-fall turned into a movie. Director Alfonso Cuarón and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, both of whom won Oscars for the film, use long takes and cleverly hidden cuts to make this film feel like it was filmed in very few shots, ramping up the anxiety surrounding its central orbital mishap. Sandra Bullock plays an engineer sent to fix the Hubble Space Telescope when space junk slams into her craft. A chain reaction turns her ship into a deadly debris field as she and a fellow space-ace (George Clooney) orbit the Earth at unimaginable speeds. \"Gravity\" is the most imaginative and exciting lesson on Newtonian physics ever even attempted, and will have you kissing the ground as the credits roll.\n\n• Starring: Sandra Bullock, George Clooney, Ed Harris\n\n• Director: Alfonso Cuarón\n\n• Year: 2013\n\n• Runtime: 91 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96%\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy are a close-knit team both on camera and off of it. After fans launched a campaign to boot Chris Pratt from the MCU, making assumptions about the actor's religious beliefs — which the star himself has never explicitly shared — director James Gunn jumped to his defense. Gunn, of course, was briefly fired from the franchise himself over some old, off-color tweets, and the \"Guardians\" cast similarly rallied behind him in the aftermath.\n\nThat's somewhat ironic, as Gunn's irreverence is what has made him the most reliably ribald director in Marvel's stable — and DC's, too (\"The Suicide Squad\" and \"Peacemaker\" also stem from the auteur's twisted mind). Still, that sense of found family translates to the final production. \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" is full of '70s flair, including a great vintage soundtrack. The lighter tone helps ease the visuals' inherent silliness, and totally works for this colorful crew of space-faring heroes. This is a Disney product that grown kids can enjoy, too.\n\n• Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista\n\n• Director: James Gunn\n\n• Year: 2014\n\n• Runtime: 121 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 92%\n\n\"Hard to Be a God\" is the best movie on this list you probably haven't seen. It's kind of a cross between the alternate medieval universe of \"Game of Thrones\" and a familiar concept from \"Star Trek.\" On a distant planet, the city of Arkanar is a highly authoritarian society that persecutes intellectuals. Earth scientists are dispatched to study the situation and rescue the elites. This is an extremely long film, it's in black and white, and it will be subtitled if your Russian is rusty. Oh, also, despite the premise, there are zero shots that actually take place in space. Still, \"Hard to Be a God\" is a stark and unsettling film worthy of galaxy-brain contemplation.\n\n• Starring: Leonid Yarmolnik, Valentin Golubenko, Yuriy Tsurilo\n\n• Director: Aleksei German\n\n• Year: 2013\n\n• Runtime: 177 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 93%\n\n\"High Life\" seems like a space thriller, but it's French — very French — so it's arty and ponderous, but does not deign to be beautiful. The sets and cinematography are ugly, but so is the situation trapping our space-faring friends. Robert Pattinson plays a convicted killer in a dystopian future who is sentenced to be a part of a human experiment in space. The con-air crew turns on each other as their situation comes to light, but not to thrill the audience. This is a film about the human need for choice and autonomy, even in the face of annihilation.

The large crew soon confronts all the familiar perils of space travel, but that's because \"Ikarie XB-1\" is part sci-fi, part film noir, and one of the most influential movies in the genre.\n\n• Starring: Zdenek Stepanek, Frantisek Smolík, Dana Medrická\n\n• Director: Jindřich Polák\n\n• Year: 1963\n\n• Runtime: 86 minutes\n\n• Rating: NR\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 100%\n\nThe critical consensus around \"Interstellar\" seems to be that Christopher Nolan took a slightly clunky kitchen-sink approach to his otherwise stunning space movie. More charitably, it's the closest modern swing at the ambition of Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" In the film, Matthew McConaughey plays a family man on a dying Earth who is picked to pilot a last-ditch mission to find a backup planet. The physics of space travel give Nolan the opportunity to further flesh out his favorite theme: time.\n\nIt's true that \"Interstellar\" has an unfortunate monologue by Anne Hathaway in which she just straight-up explains one of the film's major themes, but otherwise, this is a masterful work. Nolan's poetic yet epic filmmaking style perfectly collides with the mind-bending paradoxes of space-time.\n\n• Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain\n\n• Director: Christopher Nolan\n\n• Year: 2014\n\n• Runtime: 169 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 73%\n\n\"Independence Day\" might have been the greatest popcorn blockbuster of the '90s, but if you ask zennial movie fans about it, they've heard of it, but assume it's moldy cheese and have taken a hard pass. The thing is, they're not totally wrong. This effect-driven spectacular about a devastating alien invasion that levels Earth's major cities has all the problems of a decades-old movie that's heavily reliant on vintage computers for many of its most famous images. The survival story, though, still works, as a pilot (Will Smith) and a scientist (Jeff Goldblum) team up to take down the invading force. From Smith brazenly cold-cocking an alien to the president of the United States (Bill Pullman) joining the fight in an F-14, this is still effective feel-good movie-making.\n\n• Starring: Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum\n\n• Director: Roland Emmerich\n\n• Year: 1996\n\n• Runtime: 145 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 67%\n\nIf \"The Martian\" feels more thoughtful and methodical than any previous stranded-in-space movie, that's because it absolutely is. Andy Weir's sci-fi novel started out as a self-published PDF that was available for free, and then sold for just $1 on Amazon. As its reputation grew, so did the plot. Weir is mostly interested in well-researched and scientifically plausible ideas about surviving in space, and Ridley Scott brought that vision to the big screen with fidelity. If Elon Musk's Mars mission ever actually takes off and the harshness of space begins to encroach on human lives, we can only hope an astronaut like Mark Watney is around to \"science the s*** out of this.\"\n\n• Starring: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig\n\n• Director: Ridley Scott\n\n• Year: 2015\n\n• Runtime: 132 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 91%\n\nIn \"Moon,\" Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a corporate astronaut who's working a three-year gig on a highly-automated moon base that mines Earth's main energy source. For some reason, this crucial job is also a solo mission, but just as Sam's time away from his wife and new child nears an end, he begins to suffer hallucinations and crashes his lunar rover. When Sam wakes up in the infirmary and travels back to the crash site, he discovers what appears to be himself, still in the rover. No further spoilers are appropriate. Suffice it to say that \"Moon\" deploys the space-thriller genre's cabin fever paranoia with creative tension, but soon dives into a grander mystery as Sam becomes the solar system's most far-flung detective.\n\n• Starring: Sam Rockwell, Dominique McElligott, Kaya Scodelario\n\n• Director: Duncan Jones\n\n• Year: 2009\n\n• Runtime: 97 minutes\n\n• Rating: R\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 90%\n\nIn \"Mr. Nobody,\" Jared Leto plays the last living mortal. He's extremely old and suffering from amnesia as he bounces through time, waking up in his own body at different points in his life, unclear how he got there or even who exactly he is. This is an incredibly ambitious effort from auteur Jaco Van Dormael that's interested in both pop-physics-inspired philosophy and the non-linear storytelling fad that was popular in 2009. To that end, the film is cut like a disorienting montage and doesn't make complete sense, but maybe that's how space-time works without human memory to piece it all together.\n\n• Starring: Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger\n\n• Director: Jaco Van Dormael\n\n• Year: 2009\n\n• Runtime: 141 minutes\n\n• Rating: R\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 68%\n\n\"On the Silver Globe\" is a spectacular and incredibly trippy other-world epic. This 1988 film was over a decade in the making, but was never actually finished because of interference from the Polish government. Despite the difficulty, after a beautiful 2016 restoration it looks like something \"The Revenant\" cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki would have shot in 2020. The plot is set in the far future, and follows a group of astronauts who flee a dystopian Earth and form a colony on a far-flung planet.

Sean Connery plays a security marshal on a Martian mining colony who discovers that a drug is circulating that increases productivity, but that also causes horrifying accidents. The company wants him to look the other way and his family wants him home, but he's decided to make a stand. This isn't a metaphorically deep space movie, but \"Outland\" is a good reminder that model miniatures and meticulous sets make the best sci-fi movie settings.\n\n• Starring: Sean Connery, Peter Boyle, Frances Sternhagen\n\n• Director: Peter Hyams\n\n• Year: 1981\n\n• Runtime: 109 minutes\n\n• Rating: R\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 56%\n\nNormally, I would avoid movies where the hero is trapped in a tiny box, like Ryan Reynolds was for 95 tedious minutes in 2010's \"Buried.\" \"Oxygen\" has the same premise, but this French film is given just enough breathing room to work as \"Liz\" (Mélanie Laurent) wakes in a cryogenic chamber with no memory of who she is or how she got there. The difference here is that Liz has a deadpan AI-powered touchscreen to help her solve the mystery before she runs out of air. The film's placement on this list gives away a great twist, but that doesn't ruin it. \"Oxygen\" has moments that will test your patience, but also a breathless climax that's worth the wait.\n\n• Starring: Mélanie Laurent, Mathieu Amalric, Malik Zidi\n\n• Director: Alexandre Aje\n\n• Year: 2021\n\n• Runtime: 101 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG-13\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 88%\n\n\"Pitch Black\" is what sold studios on Vin Diesel, and I'd argue that this critically underrated and intensely suspenseful sci-fi gem remains the brawny action star's best film — apologies to fans of those car movies. Here, Diesel plays Riddick, a muscle-bound badass on a prison transport ship who's heading off to do some hard time. He has surgically-enhanced eyes that make him look super cool, but that also let him see in the dark.

In fact, you might need a similar time travel method to understand how awesome this movie was in 1968; \"Mad Men\" provided one in season 6, when Don Draper takes his son Bobby to see this movie. The credits roll, and their minds are blown.

This three-plus-hour space film eventually gets into orbit, but the best section is the lengthy opening act, which follows a group of future astronauts working as test pilots at an air base in California. A quarter of these men were killed as they pushed the limits of physics. During an unfathomable stretch in 1952, seven pilots a month were lost as these fearless flyers broke first the barrier, and then the very grasp of Earth itself. \"The Right Stuff\" is a moving and exciting tribute to a kind of bravery you have to see to believe.\n\n• Starring: Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn, Ed Harris\n\n• Director: Phillip Kaufman\n\n• Year: 1983\n\n• Runtime: 193 minutes\n\n• Rating: PG\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96%\n\nIn 1985, the actual Russian space program lost contact with the very real Salyut 7 space station when it powered down and began to drift.

The story follows Kris Kelvin, an aptly named psychologist who is tapped for an interstellar mission to the Solaris research station, from where mysterious reports have been emanating. Kris finds that the crew has gone insane and soon begins having visions himself as this Soviet-era film delves into a metaphysical mystery with lots of moody, existential philosophy.

The sheer longevity of Clint Eastwood's career has led him into a heretofore unknown genre: the nonagenarian adventure. Well into his 90s, Eastwood was still making action-oriented movies starring himself; 2021's \"Cry Macho\" is hard to watch, as Eastwood shuffles around chasing a rooster in a plodding western. However, way back in the year 2000, a spry 70-year-old Eastwood played Frank Corvin, a former test pilot who missed his chance to go to space when early NASA replaced his team with chimps. When an aging satellite of his own design needs repairs, Corvin insists on getting the old band back together.

In their second feature film, Kirk and his crew run into the genetically engineered superman commander Khan Noonien Singh. He's gotten his hands on a fancy Federation ship and is out for vengeance after being exiled years earlier.

Like any massive fantasy franchise, \"Star Wars\" is an information cult where the point of fandom is the collection and preservation of the canon.

Abrams revived the use of real sets (when possible) and of course, leaned into his love of vintage widescreen lenses. \"Star Wars\" regained a cool just by looking like itself again.

Rian Johnson dared to add just a little style to the Skywalker saga and instantly became public enemy number one as the unelected keepers of the Jedi flame self-immolated in a panic over that scene of Princess Leia floating in space. In the aftermath, Johnson's own \"Star Wars\" trilogy was (perhaps not coincidentally) indefinitely delayed by Lucasfilm. However, if the quality of the moviemaking matters more to you than the law of canon, this is the best of the modern Star Wars spin-offs, sequels, or prequels.

Acclaimed \"Slumdog Millionaire\" director Danny Boyle has made better films, but he brings his signature kinetic energy to this extremely thermal story about a crew that's sent to revive a dying sun and save Earth from turning into a lifeless ball of ice. As a series of calamities pile up, the film starts to feel like an argument for letting robots handle crucial space missions. Human error gives way to paranoia and moral dilemmas as the crew members weigh their lives against the future of humanity.

Don't let either of those things take away from its importance. Director Georges Méliès was one of the first true filmmakers, and he created this moon-landing adventure story using the skills he picked up as a stage illusionist. Méliès was the great innovator of early special effects, and noticed that cutting film is a great way to make things disappear like magic. The general story is summed up in the title, but in Méliès' day the moon was often imagined as an alien world with oceans and native tribes of its own. The entire space film genre started here.\n\n• Starring: Jeanne d'Alcy, Georges Méliès, Victor André\n\n• Director: Georges Méliès\n\n• Year: 1902\n\n• Runtime: 14 minutes\n\n• Rating: NR\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 100%\n\n\"2001\" is the best sci-fi film ever made, unless you don't like arty ruminations with ambiguous conclusions. Stanley Kubrick is just as methodical with Newtonian physics in this visual spectacular as he is with the classic story that pits man (a team of astronauts investigating an alien object in space) against machine (a malevolent AI named HAL that turns on its human masters). Kubrick actually explained this film's famously enigmatic ending in lost footage that was unearthed in 2018. It's more literal than you'd expect, but if you just accept that alien minds are behind that strange obelisk, the trippy conclusion makes much more sense.\n\n• Starring: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester\n\n• Director: Stanley Kubrick\n\n• Year: 1968\n\n• Runtime: 139 minutes\n\n• Rating: G\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 92%\n\n\"Wall-E\" has grown so vastly in reputation that it now sits alongside \"Snow White\" and \"Beauty and the Beast\" as one of the most beloved Disney animations ever created. Wall-E the robot even has some of Snow's innocence. In the 29th century, Earth has become one hideous landfill. As a result, an Amazon-like corporation has taken the whole human race to space to enjoy lives of weightless sloth. Back on Earth, only one robot remains. Wall-E scavenges for parts to extend his life, and has been alone so long that he's become sentient. When he falls in love with a probe named EVE, he follows her back to the human mothership, where hopefully the power of their bond will save the world.\n\n• Starring: Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin\n\n• Director: Andrew Stanton\n\n• Year: 2008\n\n• Runtime: 97 minutes\n\n• Rating: G\n\n• Rotten Tomatoes Score: 95%"
