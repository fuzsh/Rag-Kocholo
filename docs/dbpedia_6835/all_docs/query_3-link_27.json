        "text": "There were heroes in those days, some 25 years ago, when Americans still seemed to feel sure enough of themselves to believe in heroes. Like the dragon-slayers of myth, a few men went forth to meet the demons in the sky and do battle in behalf of all lesser mortals. They were acclaimed heroes because they seemed to embody the qualities most esteemed by Americans, rare qualities that were thought to define the best in the national character.\n\nThese few men, test pilots and the early astronauts, were plain-spoken, rugged individualists who made no apologies for devotion to duty and country. They mastered difficult skills and, as much as anyone could, were masters of their fate. They were incredibly good at what they did and knew it, but had the grace not to flaunt it. And what they did, with risk-all bravery, brought tears of wonder and pride to the eyes of those who beheld their daring and accomplishment.\n\nThe new movie, ''The Right Stuff,'' opening Friday at local theaters, is a nostalgic scrapbook of this past and an unabashed celebration of the men who are characterized as ''the last true American heroes.'' It is an old-fashioned adventure story.\n\nBut it is a true adventure story. In all important respects, the movie is true to what really happened at those fighter jock heavens, the runways and bars of Edwards Air Force Base in the high desert of California and the launching pads and bars of Cape Canaveral. The booze, bravado and women are all there, as well as the quiet courage and fear of failure. This is the way it was in the 1940's and 1950's when pilots were pushing the outside of the envelope, as they said, to fly higher and faster, and in the early 1960's when the first American astronauts were venturing into space.\n\nBoth in content and spirit, the movie is also faithful to the book on which it is based, Tom Wolfe's 1979 best-seller of the same name. Mr. Wolfe wrote of the true brotherhood of test pilots who possessed this ineffable quality he called the right stuff.\n\nIt was not talked about in any way, not by those who had the right stuff. It was more than bravery ''in the simple sense of being willing to risk life,'' Mr. Wolfe wrote. ''Any fool could do that.'' Instead, the idea seemed to be that ''a man should have the ability to go up in a hurtling piece of machinery, put his hide on the line and then have the moxie, the reflexes, the experience, the coolness, to pull it back in the last yawning moment, and then to go up again the next day, and the next day, and every next day, even if the series should prove infinite.'' In its best expression, he added, the right stuff meant taking these risks ''in a cause that means something to thousands, to a people, a nation, to humanity, to God.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
