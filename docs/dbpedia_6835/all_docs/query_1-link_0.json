        "text": "One of the most revered and celebrated sci-fi films of the last 10 years, Interstellar is a visually striking Christopher Nolan masterpiece of incredible magnitude. While audiences argue about which Nolan film is his best (see also Inception, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Oppenheimer), Interstellar remains his most pure sci-fi film. With the help of renowned, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Kip Thorne, Nolan created mathematically sound visuals of black holes and wormholes five years ahead of the first actual photos. While some of the scientific accuracy — theory of relativity, ‘time slippage,’ power of gravity, power of love — is lost in favor of cinematic dramatization, the scientific theories established in the film are air-tight in consistency and highly intriguing. These are some of the things that make Interstellar such an incredible experience to behold, even with its near-three-hour runtime.\n\nWhile Interstellar is a one-of-a-kind film, other films out there share many similarities and qualities that make them worth the watch. Here’s a compiled list of movies like Interstellar.\n\nAd Astra (2019)\n\nAn often glossed-over sci-fi epic, Ad Astra remains scientifically accurate for the most part, which could be why it was considered a bit more monotonous than the monstrous Interstellar. Destined to walk in his father’s footsteps, Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) is tasked with finishing the intergalactic mission his father went missing 30 years prior. McBride is an admirable protagonist throughout the film, definitely similar to the behavior and resolve of Interstellar’s Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who is also on an Earth-saving mission.\n\nRead our review of Ad Astra.\n\nThe Right Stuff (1983)\n\nBoasting a spectacular cast that provides unparalleled charm, The Right Stuff is a fun, crisply written story based on true events in American history. From the first breaking of the sound barrier to the recruitment of the Mercury 7 astronauts, The Right Stuff’s rowdy, unconventional group of test pilots proves a little spunk can go a long way. Taking a much more lighthearted tone compared to other films on this list, The Right Stuff is a good movie to check out for a fun time.\n\nArmageddon (1998)\n\nStarring another ragtag team of adventurers, Michael Bay’s Armageddon tacks a big slice of cheese on to a sci-fi narrative in the most wholesome, expected way possible. After NASA learns an impending asteroid the size of Texas is heading towards Earth, it assembles a team of deep-core drillers to fly out and destroy the asteroid from the inside out. Fans of other Bay films will certainly enjoy this one, as the action and quippy quotes heavily outweigh the corny, obligatory romance.\n\nApollo 13 (1995)\n\nAnother film with a fantastic cast of actors, Ron Howard’s Apollo 13 is the well-told true story of a perilous mission and the three astronauts who embarked on it. After a successful takeoff and exit of Earth’s atmosphere, Apollo 13 takes heavy internal damage which must be fixed before the crew runs out of oxygen. With all the right ingredients for a good film (true story, Ron Howard, great cast, etc.), Apollo 13 is a sci-fi classic that will be rewatched and referenced for years to come.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\nA true pioneer of the sci-fi film catalog, Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey is a stunning work of art that was way ahead of its time. After an ominous obelisk is discovered on the moon, two astronauts and an AI computer are sent to Jupiter to investigate its origins. The oldest film on this list of greats, it still holds up as one of the most impressive visual experiences in sci-fi cinematic history.\n\nSunshine (2007)\n\nAnother save-the-world sci-fi film, Danny Boyle’s Sunshine is an underdog, high-octane thriller that somehow flew under many people’s radar. Set in the year 2057 with a quickly dying sun, an international team of astronauts is sent to space with a nuclear fission bomb to reignite it. While the plot is a bit sporadic and confusing, the visuals, complemented by Cillian Murphy’s presence, make this a must-see film for sci-fi fans.\n\nThe Martian (2014)\n\nFrom reliable director Ridley Scott, The Martian is a fun, creative story that packs many desired sci-fi elements into one film. Accidentally separated from his crew in a storm and left for dead on Mars, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) must singlehandedly come up with ways to contact NASA, grow food, and survive until he can be rescued. The overall tone and cinematography are similar at times to Interstellar’s, and the two films even share some of the same actors (Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain).\n\nRead our review of The Martian.\n\nDeep Impact (1998)\n\nAn eerily similar film to Armageddon that came out the same year, Deep Impact is a slightly bleaker edition that treads familiar ground. Upon the presidential announcement that two very large comets are heading straight toward Earth, a team of astronauts is sent to space to stop them while the world prepares as best it can. It focuses a bit more on the effects on Earth rather than in space, making this film emotionally resonate and relatable.\n\nMoon (2009)\n\nA compelling and spellbinding sci-fi flick everyone should check out, Moon is a unique addition to the sci-fi genre. Close to the end of his three-year stint as the lone resource collector and moon base operator, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) and his AI assistant GERTY (​​Kevin Spacey) start to experience some strange happenings that make him question his sanity. While this may not have lots of shared attributes with Interstellar, the mysteries this film uncovers are just as, if not more, exciting to experience.\n\nRead our review of Moon.\n\nSolaris (2002)\n\nBased on the classic sci-fi novel by Stanislaw Lem, Solaris explores some interesting themes and events that tread beyond the realm of ‘hard’ sci-fi. After a crew of astronauts on a space station orbiting a foreign planet begin acting strangely, home base decides to send psychologist Kelvin (George Clooney) to try and understand the issue. Though it received mixed reviews from audiences upon release, Soderbergh’s sound writing and directing shine through to carry it along.\n\nRead our review of Solaris."
