        "text": "Amazingly, the Thompson Twins kept having minor hits up to the end of 1991, even though neither the 1989 or 1991 albums on Warner Bros made the Top 100. I was shocked when Close To The Bone (the 1987 album which has Get That Love) debuted at #90. True, they'd been on the slide even in 1985, but to go from three top 5 albums to a #90 was a bit drastic. It's a great album actually, better than Heres To Future Days but not quite another Into The Gap (although several songs evoke the same classic pop vibe). The best song on it, Dancing In Your Shoes, was wasted as a B-side to the 2nd single Long Goodbye.\n\nIf you're still having trouble making Disc 2's for '83-95, Now Music released CDs for their anniversary that were yearly themed. They have ones for 1983 to 1995, they might help you out. http://destinyxnowmusic.freehostia.com/nowmusic/nowukmenu.html check them out here, just scroll down the main series. They also did a similar collection called \"The Mellenium Years\" which go back to 1980, a great help when I did my yearly themed playlists.\n\nHere is my 2012 disc:\n\nCD1\n\n1. Cheryl Cole - Call My Name\n\n2. Florence + The Machine - Spectrum (Calvin Harris Remix)\n\n3. Taylor Swift - We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\n\n4. Ellie Goulding - Anything Could Happen\n\n5. Marina & The Diamonds - Primadonna\n\n6. Saint Etienne - Tonight\n\n7. Amelia Lily - You Bring Me Joy\n\n8. Little Mix - Wings\n\n9. Loreen - Euphoria\n\n10. Kylie Minogue - Timebomb\n\n11. Girls Aloud - Something New\n\n12. Little Boots - Every Night I Say A Prayer\n\n13. Scissor Sisters - Only The Horses\n\n14. Lana Del Rey - Born To Die\n\n15. Coldplay - Paradise\n\n16. Christina Aguilera - Your Body\n\n17. PSY - Gangnam Style\n\n18. One Direction - Live While Your Young\n\n19.

They also did a similar collection called \"The Mellenium Years\" which go back to 1980, a great help when I did my yearly themed playlists.\n\nAlso, Demon Music's Pop Years 2CD sets for the 70s, 80s and 90s are an excellent reference.\n\nThanks guys! Funnily enough I have most of the Pop Years compilations / NOW yearly series and they have come in very useful for edited versions of these songs. HITS albums have also come in useful in the 80s. I didn't get the 70s pop years discs as the songs didn't seem very good or even particularly important hits.\n\nI need to get the rest of the original NOW years from the original 1993 series, although I don't think the tracklisting is hugely different from the cheaper Millenium series.\n\nThey have ones for 1983 to 1995, they might help you out. http://destinyxnowmusic.freehostia.com/nowmusic/nowukmenu.html\n\nThis is a useful link to fill in the gaps in my NOW collection thanks. I thought NOW Dance 86 was on CD for a moment! Gutted I only have it on cassette.\n\nI am determined to finalise 2004-2012 and then start in earnest on disc 2 for each year. This thread will definitely help!\n\nEric your impeccable taste is required in the PJ Song Contest Thread!\n\nInevitably, I went and redid my 1986 set once I'd listened back to it again. It didn't feel right. Now it does! Somehow two of my faves, OMD and a-ha, had been left out, so they're in and a couple of the AOR tracks are gone.\n\nI imagine one or two tracks would change depending on what day of the week it is! I know I will never get a perfect list....\n\n2004\n\n01 What You Waiting For Gwen Stefani\n\n02 Toxic Britney Spears\n\n03 Leave (Get Out) Jojo\n\n04 Thank You Jamelia\n\n05 Left Outside Alone Anastacia\n\n06 In The Shadows The Rasmus\n\n07 Take Me Out Franz Ferdinand\n\n08 Somebody Told Me The Killers\n\n09 I Don't Want To Be Gavin DeGraw\n\n10 Run Snow Patrol\n\n11 Mary Scissor Sisters\n\n12 Cannonball Damien Rice\n\n13 Dry Your Eyes The Streets\n\n14 Bedshaped Keane\n\n15 She Will Be Loved Maroon 5\n\n16 These Words Natasha Bedingfield\n\n17 Fell In Love With A Boy Joss Stone\n\n18 Milkshake Kelis\n\n19 Flawless (Go To The City) George Michael\n\n20 Call On Me Eric Prydz\n\n21 I Believe In You Kylie Minogue\n\nI've not finished 2004 yet but I share the following so far:\n\n02 Toxic Britney Spears\n\n07 Take Me Out Franz Ferdinand\n\n10 Run Snow Patrol\n\n16 These Words Natasha Bedingfield\n\n20 Call On Me Eric Prydz\n\n21 I Believe In You Kylie Minogue\n\nI couldn't decide between Mr Brightside and Somebody Told Me as I didn't know what was bigger but seeing your playlist I'll go for the latter.\n\nHere is 2011:\n\nCD1\n\n1. Jennifer Lopez - On The Floor\n\n2. Nicole Scherzinger - Don't Hold Your Breath\n\n3. Martin Solveig & Dragonette - Hello\n\n4. Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue - Higher\n\n5. Britney Spears - Till The World Ends\n\n6. Ke$ha - We R Who We R\n\n7. Lady Gaga - The Edge of Glory\n\n8. Katy Perry - E.T\n\n9. Take That - Love Love\n\n10. Marina and The Diamonds - Radioactive\n\n11. The Wanted - Glad You Came\n\n12. Nicola Roberts - Beat of My Drum\n\n13. Olly Murs Feat. Rizzle Kicks - Heart Skips A Beat\n\n14. The Saturdays - All Fired Up\n\n15. One Direction - What Makes You Beautiful\n\n16. Rihanna - We Found Love\n\n17 Beyonce - Run The World\n\n18. Aloe Blacc - I Need A Dollar\n\n19. Adele - Someone Like You\n\n20. Lana Del Rey - Video Games\n\n21. Will Young - Jealousy\n\nCD2\n\n1. Example - Changed The Way You Kiss Me\n\n2. Nero - Promises\n\n3. Katy B - Broken Record\n\n4. Mann Feat. 50 Cent - Buzzin'\n\n5. Alex Gaudino Feat. Kelly Rowland - What A Feeling\n\n6. Cher Lloyd Feat. Mike Posner - With Ur Love\n\n7. DJ Fresh - Feat. Sian Evans - Louder\n\n8. Nicki Minaj - Super Bass\n\n9. Dr Dre Feat. Eminem and Skylar Gray - I Need A Doctor\n\n10. Snoop Dogg vs David Guetta - Sweat\n\n11. Wretch 32 FeaT. Example - Unorthodox\n\n12. Alexis Jordan - Good Girl\n\n13. Yasmin - Finish Line (Freemasons Remix)\n\n14. Calvin Harris Feat. Kelis - Bounce\n\n15. Dev Feat. The Caturacs - Bass Down Low\n\n16. Swedish House Mafia - Save The World\n\n17. Loick Essien Feat. Tayna Lacey - How We Roll\n\n18. Chase and Status Feat Liam Bailey - Blind Faith\n\n19. Toddla T Feat, Shola Ama, J2K & Ninja Tune - Take It Back\n\n20. Maverick Sabre - Let Me Go\n\nI was even considering \"All These Things That I've Done\" whicch I rather like. Not sure it matters which was the bigger single as the album was very successful so I would just go with your favourite!\n\nMy 2004 list is very album artist heavy with Scissor Sisters, Killers, Joss Stone, Keane, Franz Ferdinand, Snow Patrol, Damien Rice and Maroon 5 but the best selling singles that year were atrocious!\n\nLooks like I have some work to do on a 2011 list! Looks good. We are probably going to meet in the middle around 2007 or so at this rate!\n\nWot no Girls Aloud?!\n\nI do rather like \"The Show\" and \"Love Machine\" but I don't see them as essential 2004 songs. I know that is a popjustice crime, sorry."
