For me, it's the best album ever made, and I'm always left in awe after I listen to it,” said Elton John in 2003. Well, if that isn’t an endorsement, but allow me to continue. George Michael said this was his all-time favourite album, Michael Jackson cited it as his favourite record by Stevie Wonder. Prince said it was the best album ever recorded, and Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston also expressed their love for it. It’s a record that almost never happened. Wonder had become disillusioned with the US government and had made plans to emigrate to Ghana to help handicapped children. In fact, he had already started working on plans for a farewell concert. Wonder changed his mind when he signed a new contract with Motown, in fact it was the largest deal ever made with an artist up to that point. It locked him in for 7 years, was worth $37m and gave him complete artistic control of his music. That’s one way to change an artist’s mind. In a complete power move, instead of starting work on the record, Wonder took a year off. He would return in late 1976 with the double album, ‘Songs In The Key Of Life.’\n\nOpening with ‘Love’s In Need Of Today,’ this album is already completely different. Firstly, unlike other records, Wonder is not the only main musician on the album. He’s brought in a raft of session musicians, 130, in fact. Amongst them were Herbie Hancock, George Benson, Minnie Riperton, Deniece Williams and Greg Phillinganes. Wonder was coming off a run of incredible albums; ‘Music Of My Mind’ (#350), ‘Talking Book’ (#59), ‘Innervisions’ (#34) and ‘Fulfillingness’ First Finale.’ This period was known as his “Classic Period” and it was capped off by this album, his magnum opus. It garnered the #1 singles ‘I Wish’ and ‘Sir Duke,’ as well as ‘Isn’t She Lovely,’ a song for daughter, Aisha. Not a single, but as good as one. Its legacy is so far reaching. Besides for the abovementioned artists that hold it in high esteem, a few of its songs became later hits for other artists. ‘As’ was a hit for Mary J. Blige and George Michael, when it would reach #4 on the charts in the UK. ‘I Wish’ was sampled by Will Smith for his #1 song, ‘Wild Wild West’ and ‘Pastime Paradise’ was sampled by Coolio for his smash #1 hit, ‘Gangsta’s Paradise.’ On ‘Ngiculela-Es Una Historia-I Am Singing,’ Wonder sings in a combination of perfect Zulu and Spanish. There’s no end to the talents of this man. ‘Songs In The Key Of Life’ became Wonder’s third and final #1 record in the US. It was nominated for a staggering seven Grammy Awards, winning four, including Album Of The Year. Stevie Wonder is a musical genius, one of the most talented musicians of our lifetime. I’m glad to see the jump that this album made. So richly deserved. Spend time with this record, it’s an incredibly rewarding listen.\n\n#rs500albums"
