The band recorded the album between December 2015 and January 2017 at Big Bad Sound, Sunset Sound, and Red Star.\n\nThe album was preceded by the first single and music video for \"Ghost of a Chance\". \"Bovver Rock and Roll\" was released as the album's second single. \"Where I'm Going\" was released as a promotional single. A music video was also made for \"Telegraph Avenue\".\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessional ratingsAggregate scoresSourceRatingMetacritic69/100[4]Review scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[5]Consequence of SoundB[6]Drowned in Sound7/10[7]Pitchfork7.3/10[8]PopMatters5/10[9]Record Collector[10]\n\nTrouble Maker was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on ten reviews.[4]\n\nShane Baldwin of Record Collector praised the album, writing: \"Trouble Maker is up there with their best\".[10] Dan Weiss of Consequence of Sound wrote: \"there's no formal breakthroughs on Trouble Maker beyond the astounding economy, unless you think the harmonica on \"Buddy\" or Clash-goes-\"Ring of Fire\" chords on \"Telegraph Avenue\" makes this the band's folk-punk album\".[6] Zoe Camp of Pitchfork resumed: \"while Trouble Maker doesn't usurp the band's primordial peak, it's far and wide their strongest effort since 2000's excellent self-titled\".[8] Nick Roseblade of Drowned in Sound called the album \"a return to force for Rancid, and is the musical equivalent of a football team winning a major trophy after years in the wilderness and the absolute elation that comes with that. However there is a downside\", and added \"Rancid could have released Trouble Maker at any point since they began\".[7]\n\nIn mixed reviews, AllMusic's Tim Sendra stated: \"like their disappointing 2014 album ...Honor Is All We Know, Trouble Maker is the sound of a band going through the motions, telling the same stories over and over, bashing out the same riffs, and ultimately not connecting any punches\".[5] John Paul of PopMatters found the album \"more of the same; retreads of staid ideas, sounds and themes better suited to teenage ennui\".[9]\n\nBackground and recording\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginally Rancid intended to record an EPs worth of material in December 2015.\n\nThe tracks written solely by Tim Armstrong were meant for his second solo album which was recorded with Matt Freeman on bass and Joey Castillo on drums. Upon hearing the tracks Brett Gurewitz suggested Rancid go back into the studio and use these towards a new Rancid album.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nAdapted from the album liner notes.[11]\n\nRancid\n\nTim Armstrong – vocals, guitars\n\nLars Frederiksen – guitars, vocals\n\nMatt Freeman – bass guitar, vocals\n\nBranden Steineckert – drums, backing vocals\n\nStudio musicians\n\nKevin Bivona – piano, Hammond B3 organ, melodica\n\nBrett Gurewitz – additional backing vocals\n\nSkinhead Rob – additional backing vocals\n\nMichael Shultz – additional backing vocals\n\nThe Interrupters – additional backing vocals\n\nTechnical\n\nBrett Gurewitz – producer\n\nKevin Bivona – engineer\n\nClinton Welander – engineer\n\nZach Fisher – assistant engineer\n\nAndrew Scheps – mixing\n\nEric Boulanger – mastering\n\nJett Galindo – mastering assistant\n\nTim Armstrong – artwork, layout\n\nJason A.
