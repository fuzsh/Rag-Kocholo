        "text": "An incalculable number of albums have been released in music history, but only 58 have earned the coveted distinction of Album Of The Year GRAMMY winner so far. From Henry Mancini's The Music From Peter Gunn to Taylor Swift's 1989, some of these elite albums have arguably surprised, some were seemingly consensus choices and still others have fostered lasting debate. In part two of Album Of The Year GRAMMY Winners, explore the albums that won — and were runners-up for — music's biggest prize for the 1970s.\n\n1970 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nBridge Over Troubled Water\n\nSimon And Garfunkel\n\nSimon And Garfunkel's final studio album is by far their most adventurous. With a mix of anthemic songs of support such as \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" frivolous love songs (\"Cecilia\") and plaintive folk ballads (\"El Condor Pasa [If I Could]\" and \"The Boxer\"), Bridge Over Troubled Water would become one of the duo's biggest sellers. In total, the album and tracks from it won six GRAMMYs, including Song and Record Of The Year. Despite its reassuring title track, the duo was in the midst of breaking up during the recording of the album.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nClose To You, Carpenters\n\nChicago, Chicago\n\nDéjà Vu, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nElton John, Elton John\n\nSweet Baby James, James Taylor\n\n1971 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nTapestry\n\nCarole King\n\nThis year, a classic singer/songwriter bested rock, pop, funk/soul, and a blessed Broadway show. After becoming one of the most successful Brill Building songwriters along with her then-husband and creative partner, Gerry Goffin — with confections including \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow,\" \"One Fine Day\" and \"Up On The Roof,\" among many others — Carole King's first attempts at a solo career were quietly received. But Tapestry became a benchmark recording in the singer/songwriter realm, staying on the charts for nearly six years and selling 10 million copies. King's songs on Tapestry (including Record Of The Year \"It's Too Late,\" Song Of The Year \"You've Got A Friend,\" \"I Feel The Earth Move,\" and the King/Goffin/Wexler cut \"[You Make Me Feel Like] A Natural Woman\") are exquisitely written and undeniably compelling.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nCarpenters, Carpenters\n\nAll Things Must Pass, George Harrison\n\nShaft, Isaac Hayes\n\nJesus Christ Superstar, London Production, Producers: Andrew Lloyd Webber, Tim Rice\n\n1972 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nThe Concert For Bangla Desh\n\nVarious Artists\n\nThe triple-LP live album The Concert For Bangla Desh was one of the first culturally significant all-star charity recordings. Proceeds from the record and concert film — which continue to this day, thanks to a 2005 re-release on DVD and availability via iTunes and Spotify — went to UNICEF to benefit the Bengali homeless and poor, many suffering as a result of the 1971 war between India and Pakistan. The concert organizer, George Harrison, was made aware of the dire Bengali situation through his friendship with Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar. With participation from A-listers such as Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Leon Russell, and Beatlemate Ringo Starr, the success of the concert would be a precursor to such efforts as Band Aid and USA For Africa.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nMoods, Neil Diamond\n\nAmerican Pie, Don McLean\n\nNilsson Schmilsson, Harry Nilsson\n\nJesus Christ Superstar, Original Broadway Cast, Producers: Tom Morgan, Tim Rice, Andrew Lloyd Webber\n\n1973 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nInnervisions\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nInnervisions comprises nine songs, but even today they stand out as examples of Stevie Wonder's deft ability to tackle religion, social issues and politics within a pop palette. Showcasing his multitalented songwriting and arranging skills, \"Higher Ground,\" \"Living For The City\" (a GRAMMY winner for Best Rhythm & Blues Song), \"Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing,\" and \"He's Misstra Know It All\" (aimed at then-President Richard Nixon) are astute observations of '70s social issues.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nKilling Me Softly With His Song, Roberta Flack\n\nThe Divine Miss M, Bette Midler\n\nBehind Closed Doors, Charlie Rich\n\nThere Goes Rhymin' Simon, Paul Simon\n\n1974 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nFulfillingness' First Finale\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nFulfillingness' First Finale, the second of Stevie Wonder's consecutive Album Of The Year wins, sits near the end of what is often considered his \"classic period\" of releases (Music Of My Mind, Talking Book, Innervisions, …Finale, and Songs In The Key Of Life). Moving in a different, more relationship-oriented direction than Innervisions, Wonder still takes another swing at President Nixon (\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\") with a little backing help from the Jackson 5. Still, African-Americans' outrage at a relatively unchanged post-'60s social scene was well represented at the GRAMMYs this year: Richard Pryor took home Best Comedy Recording for That N*****'s Crazy.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nBack Home Again, John Denver\n\nCaribou, Elton John\n\nBand On The Run, Paul McCartney And Wings\n\nCourt And Spark, Joni Mitchell\n\n1975 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nStill Crazy After All These Years\n\nPaul Simon\n\nFlush with some of his most accessible pop hits (\"50 Ways To Leave Your Lover,\" \"My Little Town\" [featuring Art Garfunkel] and the title track), Still Crazy After All These Years was Paul Simon's third solo studio release after splitting with Garfunkel. By now, Simon and Stevie Wonder were in their '70s prime, duking it out almost yearly for best album in the eyes of the public and The Recording Academy Voting members. Memorably, Simon, in accepting his award, thanked Wonder for not releasing an album that year. Wonder would have the last laugh the next year.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nOne Of These Nights, Eagles\n\nBetween The Lines, Janis Ian\n\nCaptain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy, Elton John\n\nHeart Like A Wheel, Linda Ronstadt\n\n1976 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nSongs In The Key Of Life\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nSongs In The Key Of Life, a double-LP collection considered by many to be the quintessential Stevie Wonder recording, tackles freedom (\"Black Man\"), politics (\"Village Ghetto Land\"), the future (\"Saturn\"), a father's love (\"Isn't She Lovely\"), and the powerful emotions behind them all. And 13 years after his Motown splash, The 12 Year Old Genius, this album finds Wonder at his most prolific in terms of experimentation and creativity. In all, Songs … would garner Wonder five GRAMMY wins, including Best Producer Of The Year honors.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nBreezin', George Benson\n\nChicago X, Chicago\n\nFrampton Comes Alive!, Peter Frampton\n\nSilk Degrees, Boz Scaggs\n\n1977 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nRumours\n\nFleetwood Mac\n\nFleetwood Mac's Rumours marked the group's only GRAMMY. Following their blues-rock beginnings, it is the band's second release after the addition of young California-based singer/songwriters Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Many of the album's songs are clearly steeped in the varying emotions resulting from incendiary internal relationships. The turmoil and strife proved to be bittersweet. (To this day, Rumours is among the most lauded and top-selling albums of all time.) \"Don't Stop,\" \"The Chain,\" \"Dreams,\" and \"Gold Dust Woman\" were breakout songs, and Buckingham's unique guitar stylings shine throughout this landmark recording.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nHotel California, Eagles\n\nAja, Steely Dan\n\nJT, James Taylor\n\nStar Wars — Motion Picture Soundtrack, John Williams, Producer: George Lucas\n\n1978 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nSaturday Night Fever — Motion Picture Soundtrack\n\nVarious Artists\n\nDuring the mid-'70s, many of the sounds wafting out of car radios and club doors were clearly influenced by R&B and its dance floor cousin, disco. The big winners at the 21st Annual GRAMMYs included Best New Artist A Taste Of Honey, Donna Summer, Earth, Wind & Fire, and the soundtrack to the most popular film of 1977. Both the film and the accompanying soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever created a pop culture supernova. A third of the songs were composed and performed by the Bee Gees (including \"Stayin' Alive,\" \"How Deep Is Your Love,\" \"More Than A Woman,\" and \"Night Fever\"). Other artists on the soundtrack read like a short list of disco royalty, including Yvonne Elliman (singing another silky Gibbs composition, \"If I Can't Have You\"), Kool & The Gang, Tavares, the Trammps, and KC & The Sunshine Band.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nRunning On Empty, Jackson Browne\n\nEven Now, Barry Manilow\n\nSome Girls, the Rolling Stones\n\nGrease — Motion Picture Soundtrack, Various Artists\n\n1979 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\n52nd Street\n\nBilly Joel\n\nComing off wins for Record Of The Year and Song Of The Year for \"Just The Way You Are\" from his 1977 breakout album The Stranger, Billy Joel had a lot riding on 52nd Street. But with its win for Album Of The Year, Joel captured three of the most prestigious GRAMMYs inside two years. The title and slight jazz undercurrents on the album (produced by Phil Ramone) are a nod to the New York City street renowned for its jazz clubs and glitzy nightlife. Catapulted by songs such as \"Big Shot,\" \"Honesty,\" \"My Life,\" the ode to Phil Spector Brill Building pop \"Until The Night,\" and \"Zanzibar\" (the latter featuring bright trumpet accompaniment by Freddie Hubbard and vibes by Steps Ahead's Mike Mainieri), 52nd Street was also Joel's first No. 1 album.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nMinute By Minute, the Doobie Brothers\n\nThe Gambler, Kenny Rogers\n\nBad Girls, Donna Summer\n\nBreakfast In America, Supertramp\n\nA lot seems to have happened in the two years since 'Hypnos.' On a month-to-month, day-to-day basis, how much do you shift creatively?\n\nIt feels like night and day to me, even though it's been a really short amount of time. During this time between Hypnos and this album — the recording and creating process — a lot unlocked with me. [There was] a lot of personal growth that happened that allows me to approach music in a much freer and kind of impulsive way.\n\nWith the last album and that process, I think I did place a lot of parameters around what I had to be, what I had to sound like, what it had to feel like, who I had to connect with. And I kind of just released all of those expectations with this and made music that I wanted to hear.\n\nHow easy was it to actually release those boundaries and work more more in the moment?\n\nI knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go, if I wanted to keep pursuing music in a way that felt honest. And then being able to collaborate with people such as Dahi, who has kind of mastered that in a lot of ways, and learning from him and seeing his process, seeing how easy and natural it is to just fall into what feels right…\n\nI think the longer you're in an industry or you're in something, the more rules you place on [creativity] and the more you overthink it and try to mold it in a way that doesn't feel impactful. As an artist, being around him and him encouraging that type of process, I think that was a lot of it, too.\n\nDahi's worked with some incredible artists, and clearly in a way that accentuates that artist rather than making it about DJ Dahi. That must have been so perfectly aligned with your openness, to go in and let yourself learn what you wanted to do. They always say if you know too much and plan everything out, you’ll end up stifled creatively.\n\nIt's so true. And that's why I describe it as me kind of returning back to that 12-year-old me, that 13-year-old me, before I cared about opinions, what people thought about me and what I was doing, what I was wearing I think we start off that way, and then the older we get, the more we get so self-conscious and we judge ourselves more harshly than everyone else.\n\nWhy do we do that?!\n\n[Laughs.] I think it's just human nature. And then we try to unlearn all of it.\n\nEven just in daily life, it's so hard to not think about what I could have done at any given moment. And when you’re creating music, there are 5 million ways you can create the same idea and you have to just land on that one.\n\nA hundred percent. During this process, we would have a song idea and then three different versions of that song that hit completely different feelings — maybe a more soft rock version of it, maybe a more indie version of it, maybe a more soulful version. Then it was about having to settle into what is \"the one\" and what feels the best, versus like what's going to chart or what's going to get in the club. Having to release all of that and just really lean into what feels good is what works every time.\n\nThat relates even to how the album was announced, with two tracks that almost speak in conversation with one another. Those songs balance such clever hooks with more nuanced conversation about how conflicted and complex love and relationships can be. How did you find that balance between emotional realism and such immediate music?\n\nIt was just really feeling empowered and confident in my decision making. And that's something that's developed over time, too. Really listening to my voice and what I want out of music in my career and my rollout, you know?\n\nListening to that, obviously having people around me who are like-minded in that way like my management and my team. We all kind of empowered each other to lean into those feelings. At no point in this process did anything feel forced or like I was reaching for something.\n\nThat’s so interesting. You want your team to feel supportive but you also want to feel empowered to take risks away from that support. And that reminds me of “Love Me Not,” which has some really smart risks. It's that vintage pop feeling, right down to the clap-along beats, and the vocals feel right in your ear. So when you started working on that track, for example, did you always imagine it being that nostalgia, that warmth?\n\nI thought that there was just something so cool and timeless, a classic feeling about it. And my songs are the ones where you can really pinpoint what the influences are, or when this was made, or the person behind it. Having a song like that, that really reminded me of Outkast. Like, What is this?\n\nEven before it dropped, I remember having some anxiety around maybe my fans not liking it because it feels a little different from Hypnos. I think anytime you kind of jump outside of the bubble you've kind of created, it's scary because there are people living in that bubble with you who like the temperature in there.\n\nIt’s so important to be constantly revitalized in your work. If you’re doing the same thing, even if your fans are demanding it, you’re not going to get that. And hopefully when your fans see all that you can do, they’ll follow it.\n\nYeah. And there's so much left in me to explore into and put out into the world. And look at an artist's career, someone like Tyler, the Creator: Seeing where his sound started and how he's almost trained his fans’ ears to be receptive to something new every time. They've completely grown up with him in a lot of ways and expanded their palate. Kind of forcing the hand of listeners is something that's really interesting to me. [Laughs.]\n\nI love that idea of pushing yourself and pushing your fans, but still within the realm of what's good. [Laughs] Not just experimenting for the sake of it. Speaking of growing and experimenting, I wanted to ask about the “Love Me Not” music video that you directed. It feels so well shot but still so intimate and casual.\n\nI knew with the album and how I wanted the imagery to feel, it would be very homey. Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity, those first moments where I felt like I was getting closer to myself in a way.\n\nA lot of that started on the South side of Chicago, at my grandmother's house, in the basement. Even the cover of the album symbolizes that transition for me. That's where I dyed my hair red for the first time in the basement, in the sink, so coming back to the sink and dyeing my hair ginger on the cover was something that felt so powerful and defining for me. It just made perfect sense that we were going to go back to Chicago for the first video, in my grandmother's house, with all my family members involved. Those are my grandparents, my mom, my sisters, so that's why it feels so loose and candid. I really wanted to give people a glimpse into my life and what it felt like walking into my childhood home.\n\nGetting to see a place through someone else’s eyes is so extraordinary. It really makes the little details pop. For example, the plantains cooking on the stove at the beginning.\n\nYeah. I associate plantains with my grandparents, my family. We’re of Panamanian West Indian descent, so those smells and those sounds, I really wanted to incorporate into the video.\n\nThat really speaks to bringing some comfort along with the risk-taking, same as having your family around. The features do a great job of bolstering you, setting up that stability, particularly Ty Dolla $ign on \"Dreamgirl.\"\n\nI think we just had the idea to kind of take the song into a different world in a way. When we first started the first section of the song, I just knew there was magic there. Those Prince drums and that Brazilian guitar — why do those make sense together? It shouldn't ever make sense together. But when I heard it? Oh my god, this feels like something fresh and new, but also like I've felt this feeling before.\n\nDahi's brain is just incredible, and then even bringing in Jimmy Jam on it to do bass was a dream come true. I knew it kind of felt like it existed in that Janet stratosphere, and I thought it would be such a cool touch for him to do that personally. Dream come true on all spectrums. I love Ty Dolla $ign, obviously grew up listening to him. He's incredible and I was so honored that he wanted to do it.\n\nBesides Janet, were there any particular artists who were kind of central inspirations for this album specifically?\n\nSonically, Janet is always in the mix. With this one in particular, some Gwen Stefani, No Doubt, a little bit of Fleetwood Mac in there. I just love taking these worlds that are very different from each other and kind of mashing them and seeing what happens. It's like my favorite thing ever.\n\nYou’re trained in classical music, and it's so clear that you understand the range of emotion that you can convey. I'm just curious what happened when you went into recording — or even before that, in the writing. What was it like digging into yourself to find the narrative that matched the mashing?\n\nHonestly, I don't think there was much premeditation with the writing and what I wanted to touch on in a way. Really leaning into those impulsive initial first feelings that a song gives me is something I really valued with this album. And moving forward, that'll be my process.\n\nWhat was premeditated with the writing process with this album was, with every song, trying to really peel back those layers in my brain and those barriers lyrically. Like, What would I naturally say? Think of that and then think, Okay, how can I make this even more literal, even more personal? Even in working with my girl [songwriter] Sarah Aarons, I learned a lot from her as far as songwriting and how to really paint a picture that feels clear and concise and emotional. Not trying to find the prettiest words or the most interesting words, but really writing what feels real. And that's something that I've really, really valued and learned with this process.\n\nEven with “One Wish” with Childish Gambino, the whole album feels like this big conversation on relationships. Being more direct feels like some advice someone would get with a relationship itself, let alone writing about it. Did that process help you actually process what was happening in your life too?\n\nOh man, 100 percent. And that's why music is so beautiful to me. It's really a means of opening dialogue between me and myself, and then me and the people in my life. With a song that's so important to me like “One Wish,\" it’s not just because it's a great song, but because this has really catapulted me into this different part of my life and repairing relationships, opening up difficult conversations — like with my father in particular. Hearing such a simple song and the response I've gotten from it has only validated me much more in the fact that these real stories, real emotions are what connects.\n\nHave you played the album for your father?\n\nWe started repairing or rekindling our relationship maybe two years ago. The making of Bird’s Eye was at its peak and I felt like it was important for me to have a song on the album that addressed my relationship with him in order for me to release it and start to move on in a positive way.\n\nSo sharing the song with him, inviting him to be in the music video was huge for us. And then even after debriefing about maybe some feelings that came up when he heard certain lyrics or when he saw certain scenes in the video, it just opened up this really honest, candid dialogue between us and I couldn't be more grateful that I have this outlet.\n\nAll Music Videos, Forever\n\nRight from that starting gun of an opening chord, A Hard Day's Night's camerawork alone — black and white, inspired by French New Wave and British kitchen sink dramas — pioneers everything from British spy thrillers to \"The Monkees.\"\n\nAcross the film's 87 minutes, you're viscerally dragged into the action; you tumble through the cityscapes right along with John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Not to mention the entire music video revolution; techniques we think of as stock were brand-new here.\n\nAccording to Roger Ebert: \"Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night.\"\n\nEmergent Folk-Rock\n\nGeorge Harrison's 12-string Rickenbacker didn't just lend itself to a jangly undercurrent on the A Hard Day's Night songs; the shots of Harrison playing it galvanized Roger McGuinn to pick up the futuristic instrument — and via the Byrds, give the folk canon a welcome jolt of electricity.\n\nEntire reams of alternative rock, post-punk, power pop, indie rock, and more would follow — and if any of those mean anything to you, partly thank Lester for casting a spotlight on that Rick.\n\nRead more: Living Legends: Roger McGuinn On The History Of The Byrds, His One-Man Show And Editing His Own Wikipedia Page\n\nThe Ultimate Love Triangle Jam\n\nFrom the Byrds' \"Triad\" to Leonard Cohen's \"Famous Blue Raincoat,\" music history is replete with odes to love triangles.\n\nBut none are as desperate, as mannish, as garment-rending, as Derek and the Dominoes' \"Layla,\" where Eric Clapton lays bare his affections for his friend Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd. Where did Harrison meet her? Why, on the set of A Hard Day's Night, where she was cast as a schoolgirl.\n\nDebates, Debates, Debates\n\nSay, what is that famous, clamorous opening chord of A Hard Day's Night's title track? Turns out YouTube's still trying to suss that one out.\n\n\"It is F with a G on top, but you'll have to ask Paul about the bass note to get the proper story,\" Harrison told an online chat in 2001 — the last year of his life.\n\nA Certain Strain Of Loopy Humor\n\nNo wonder Harrison got in with Monty Python later in life: the effortlessly witty lads were born to play these roles — mostly a tumble of non sequiturs, one-liners and daffy retorts. (They were all brought up on the Goons, after all.) When A Hard Day's Night codified their Liverpudlian slant on everything, everyone from the Pythons to Tim and Eric received their blueprint.\n\nThe Legitimacy Of The Rock Flick\n\nWhat did rock 'n' roll contribute to the film canon before the Beatles? A stream of lightweight Elvis flicks? Granted, the Beatles would churn out a few headscratchers in its wake — Magical Mystery Tour, anyone? — but A Hard Day's Night remains a game-changer for guitar boys on screen.\n\nThe best part? The Beatles would go on to change the game again, and again, and again, in so many ways. Don't say they didn't warn you — as you revisit the iconic A Hard Day's Night.\n\nThe Beatles Were Happy With The Let It Be Film\n\nAfter Lindsay-Hogg showed the Beatles the final rough cut, he says they all went out to a jovial meal and drinks: \"Nice food, collegial, pleasant, witty conversation, nice wine.\"\n\nAfterward, they went downstairs to a discotheque for nightcaps. \"Paul said he thought Let it Be was good. We'd all done a good job,\" Lindsay-Hogg remembers. \"And Ringo and [wife] Maureen were jiving to the music until two in the morning.\"\n\n\"They had a really, really good time,\" he adds. \"And you can see like [in the film], on their faces, their interactions — it was like it always was.\"\n\nAbout \"That\" Fight: Neither Paul Nor George Made A Big Deal\n\nAt this point, Beatles fanatics can recite this Harrison-in-a-snit quote to McCartney: \"I'll play, you know, whatever you want me to play, or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. Whatever it is that will please you… I'll do it.\" (Yes, that's widely viewed among fans as a tremendous deal.)\n\nIf this was such a fissure, why did McCartney and Harrison allow it in the film? After all, they had say in the final cut, like the other Beatles.\n\n\"Nothing was going to be in the picture that they didn't want,\" Lindsay-Hogg asserts. \"They never commented on that. They took that exchange as like many other exchanges they'd had over the years… but, of course, since they'd broken up a month before [the film's release], everyone was looking for little bits of sharp metal on the sand to think why they'd broken up.\"\n\nRecently, Ringo Starr opined that there was \"not a lot of joy\" in the Let it Be film; Lindsay-Hogg says Starr framed it to him as \"no joy.\"\n\nOf course, that's Starr's prerogative. But it's not quite borne out by what we see — especially that merry scene where he and Harrison work out an early draft of Abbey Road's \"Octopus's Garden.\"\n\n\"And Ringo's a combination of so pleased to be working on the song, pleased to be working with his friend, glad for the input,\" Lindsay-Hogg says. \"He's a wonderful guy. I mean, he can think what he wants and I will always have greater affection for him.\n\n\"Let's see if he changes his mind by the time he's 100,\" he added mirthfully.\n\nLindsay-Hogg Thought It'd Never Be Released Again\n\n\"I went through many years of thinking, It's not going to come out,\" Lindsay-Hogg says. In this regard, he characterizes 25 or 30 years of his life as \"solitary confinement,\" although he was \"pushing for it, and educating for it.\"\n\n\"Then, suddenly, the sun comes out\" — which may be thanks to Peter Jackson, and renewed interest via Get Back. \"And someone opens the cell door, and Let it Be walks out.\"\n\nNobody Asked Him What The Sessions Were Like\n\nAll four Beatles, and many of their associates, have spoken their piece on Let it Be sessions — and journalists, authors, documentarians, and fans all have their own slant on them.\n\nBut what was this time like from Lindsay-Hogg's perspective? Incredibly, nobody ever thought to check. \"You asked the one question which no one has asked,\" he says. \"No one.\"\n\nSo, give us the vibe check. Were the Let it Be sessions ever remotely as tense as they've been described, since man landed on the moon? And to that, Lindsay-Hogg's response is a chuckle, and a resounding, \"No, no, no.\"\n\nThe Beatles' Final Song: Giles Martin On The Second Life Of \"Now And Then\" & How The Fab Four Are \"Still Breaking New Ground\""
