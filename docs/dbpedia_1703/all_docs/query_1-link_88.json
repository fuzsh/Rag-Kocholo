        "text": "More Route 33\n\nRoute 33 have dropped their latest catchy single, Troublemaker â itâs our Song of the Day!\n\nWritten by the Southern Queensland country pop-rock duoâs Trent McArdle and Jock Barnes and produced by multi-award-winning Matt Fell at Love HZ studios, Troublemaker is an edgy country track and tells the tale of a wild couple that battle the sparks and fire that erupt when two people of similar reputation meet. The song explores the situation from the viewpoint of a guy that takes risks of his own and is known to be a wild one himself, that has finally met his match.\n\nSince their first single release in November 2016, Route 33 have been featured on line-ups at CMC Rocks, Tamworth Country Music Festival, Gympie Music Muster and Groundwater Country Music Festival. That single, Last First Kiss was their first song to crack #1 on the iTunes Country Chart. Their debut album The Switch, from which the single was lifted, went to #6 on the ARIA Australian Country Album Chart.\n\nThey released their second album in 2019. Coro Drive proved to be an outstanding collection of modern country-pop tracks, drawing influence from artists and genres that the pair grew up on. One listen and you feel that country music for Jock, and 90âs rock for Trent, resonating through the speakers. The album raised the bar on the ARIA Australian Country Album Chart, seeing the band achieve a #1 chart position on release. The record attracted heavyweight industry names like Sarah McLeod (The Superjesus) for a duet, Mark Williams (Dragon) on backing vocals as well as musicians from Reba McEntire and Rascal Flatts bands rounding out an impressive release.\n\nJoin our community with our FREE weekly newsletter\n\nTroublemaker follows their previous 2021 singles â She Knows What Sheâs Doing and Quarter Past You. You can catch Route 33 live when they take the Groundwater Country Music Festival stage this November.\n\nKeep up to date with Route 33 via their Facebook page here.\n\nFor more Song Of The Days from CountryTown, check out here."
