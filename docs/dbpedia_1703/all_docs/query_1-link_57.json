        "text": "After tour managing Larry the Cable Guy and the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, writing several movie soundtracks (one of which earning a Grammy nomination) and penning songs that have appeared on projects totaling over 6 million units in sales, Jeremy McComb continues to beat the pavement and perform his own brand of Country Music for a rabid fan base across the country and around the world as a fiercely independent musician and entertainer. During his time with several major record labels in Nashville, three nationally charting hits (“Wagon Wheel“, “This Town Needs a bar” & “Cold”) all found success at mainstream radio and thrust the Idaho-native into the spotlight. All things considered, Jeremy McComb is a performer who has seen it all.\n\nUpon the release of his introspective album, “My Side of Town,” Jeremy was picked by People Magazine as one of “Nine stars to Watch.” The album received numerous 4+ star reviews including a nod from “Country Weekly” who called it \"one of the year’s most encouraging albums\". McCombs next release “Leap & The Net Will Appear” was self-produced and independently released. It spawned the 2012 summertime hit single, “Easy as Breathin’,” co-written by Kevin Kadish (Producer & Grammy Nominee - Meghan Trainor).\n\nBuilding on his prior successes, Jeremy's 2016 album \"FM\" was produced by Grammy Award Winner Jamie Tate in Nashville, TN. The album hit streets January 1st and early listener support from iTunes’ users garnered front-page placement on the Music Giant's \"New & Noteworthy\" section. The album has since tallied over 1.5 Million Streams to date!\n\nMcComb recently released his first live record capturing the entertaining and comedic essence of the 170+ date 2017 solo-acoustic TroubleMaker tour. \"TroubleMaker LIVE!\" was recorded during sold out shows across the country and will bring listeners front and center to Jeremy’s one of a kind performance style. The album is available now wherever music is sold/streamed.\n\nIn 2018, Jeremy plans to up the ante per usual. Without a doubt, he will continue his demanding touring schedule and expand his brand by bringing new songs and engaging stories to fans everywhere. He continues to craft his catalogue with some of the best writers in Nashville and when not touring, enjoys volunteering his talents with numerous Veteran organizations and spending time with his wife Kourtney and their children, Kennady, Ryker & Knox. A family of entertainers, Kourtney plays \"Emily\" on the Hit TV show \"Nashville\" and has numerous credits in a variety of productions in her well-established career.\n\nJeremy McComb has already run the gamut in the music industry in his young career and it’s clear his experience continues to propel his success. The self-proclaimed ‘TroubleMaker’ is primed for his best year yet and we’re eager to see (and hear!) what’s next!"
