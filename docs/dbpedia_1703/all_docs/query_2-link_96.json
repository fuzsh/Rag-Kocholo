He used his disposable income to build his own 12-track studio - Foxglove Studios in Watertown, Massachusetts - that he used to record most of the album. Scholz played in various Boston-area bands, so he had access to musicians from the area, including Brad Delp, who became his vocalist. Guitarist Barry Goudreau, bass player Fran Sheehan, and drummer Sib Hashian were recruited to form the band. After signing with Epic, the label arranged for the band to record Scholz' demos with producer John Boylan at a studio in Los Angeles. Scholz had spent years getting the songs to his liking and wasn't thrilled about starting over on unfamiliar turf, so he didn't. While the rest of the band was in Los Angeles working on Delp's song \"Let Me Take You Home Tonight,\" Scholz re-recorded his demos in the same studio where they were made, creating a new product he could pass off to the record company without compromising his work. The finished product is modern and slick but clearly rock and roll. It's an easy sell to radio stations, which jump on the three singles (\"More Than A Feeling,\" \"Foreplay / Long Time\" and \"Peace Of Mind\") and also play deeper cuts like \"Rock And Roll Band\" and \"Smokin'.\" Scholz keeps his day job - just in case - but when co-workers keep telling him \"More Than A Feeling\" is playing on the radio, it's clear that music is now his full-time job. By the end of 1976, the album is certified Platinum for selling over 1 million copies in America. In short order, Boston is a headlining act, playing arenas even though they have been together as a band just months. The album goes on to sell over 17 million in America, and the songs become staples of classic rock radio.\n\nCategories\n\nDebut Albums\n\nReleases"
