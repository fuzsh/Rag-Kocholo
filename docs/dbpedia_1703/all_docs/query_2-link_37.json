        "text": "What does it sound like?:\n\nHere is the latest instalment in Joni Mitchell’s reissue programme; a beautifully packaged box set incorporating the studio albums Hejira, Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter and Mingus, and the double live album, Shadows And Light. It’s a 5CD or 6LP set, featuring more of Joni’s artwork in a gorgeous book, a full size print of the painting on the outer box, and an updated cover for Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter, to replace the original featuring Joni in blackface. The new cover is only an improvement in that it’s less offensive. This time, Meryl Streep writes the essay in the booklet. Bernie Grundman, who engineered the records at the time, is responsible for a tasteful remaster. In the UK, the CD price isn’t too bad at £54 but the vinyl box costs £172.\n\nIt all starts in November 1975, with Joni joining Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Review and indulging in the vices of the road, in Joni’s case a prodigious cocaine habit and an affair with a cowboy lothario, Sam Shepard. Naturally, she wrote a song about it, the sinewy and sexy Coyote, a disarmingly frank, participant’s view of the “passion play” that occurs on tour. It’s a song that imploded her engagement to John Guerin who, nevertheless, continued to drum for her. An attempt to tour The Hissing Of Summer Lawns with Guerin ended prematurely in acrimony and Joni found herself alone. As usual, the girl from Saskatoon, a small town with a big sky, looked to the horizon with “travel fever”. On a whim, she agreed to drive two acquaintances, one an ex, from Los Angeles to Maine. She took the scenic route home in a white Mercedes, a woman alone with her guitar, down to Florida, across to the Gulf of Mexico before turning north back to LA. It was on that journey, running from a bad relationship, bad drugs and an existential crisis, that she found her true artistic voice and composed the songs for her masterpiece, Hejira. The arrangements are simple, Joni’s open tunings suggesting endless possibilities, her self-styled “chords of enquiry” posing profound questions, constantly wrestling to make sense of her life and art. Percussion provides some decoration to deceptively complex rhythms, a solo instrument, wind or string, adds aesthetics, but, most importantly, she found the bass player of her dreams. Her intimate tussle with Jaco Pastorius’s fluid, “figurative” bass lines is the musical signature of the album and set the tone for the rest of the decade. The result is feminine, sensual, and nakedly honest, perfectly reflecting Joni’s personality. These are songs that only Joni Mitchell could have written on an album that only Joni Mitchell could have made. It’s an illustration of what a woman alone is capable of, rather than having to be defined by the presence or absence of a man. As such, it is a touchstone for many artists that followed her. Hejira had a profound impact on Björk as a child, and is the declared favourite album by young female artists, such as Danielle Haim, Weyes Blood and St. Vincent.\n\nDon Juan’s Reckless Daughter, a double LP, is undoubtedly Joni’s most experimental. However, it is still rooted in folk song. It’s just that she hadn’t written many. Two of its ten songs had previously appeared on other albums and one has no words at all. Don Juan opens with an Overture, consisting of six guitars tuned differently. The epic, hallucinatory Paprika Plains fills a whole side, beginning as a sweet piano melody, with a dramatic full orchestra middle section, and ending in a Weather Report improvisation. There is a near seven minute instrumental piece of wild Latin percussion and vocal whoops, a sound palate that bleeds into Dreamland in a performance meant to reflect a Brazilian carnival but whose real joy is the dynamic vocal interaction between Joni and Chaka Khan. After three sides of challenge, the listener is rewarded with a more familiar Joni on side four. The pulsing title track seems to have stepped out from The Hissing Of Summer Lawns. Off Night Backstreet’s folkiness is disguised by an orchestra. The closing song, The Silky Veil Of Ardour, feels like a postscript to her travelogue album, Blue, in which the “wayfaring stranger” reminisces and reflects with some regret. For many faithful fans it wasn’t enough. Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter was her last album to attain gold sales. However, nearly fifty years on, its strangeness and its byways less travelled reward close scrutiny.\n\nMingus is a failed attempt at collaboration. Ailing in health, Mingus reached out to Joni to write lyrics for a musical version of T.S. Eliot’s Four Quartets. He saw her as a musical poet rather than a composer. Joni wasn’t keen on the idea of reducing T.S. Eliot to song lyrics and declined. Still, Mingus continued to write music for her, and a project grew. Mingus recommended a number of musicians for her to experiment with. None of their music was used on the album but all participants in the early sessions got a credit. In the end, Joni reverted to what she knew and turned, once again, to Weather Report with the addition of Herbie Hancock. The LP was released five months after Mingus died. It’s a Joni Mitchell album, a tribute to Charles Mingus, its beautiful melancholy pieces hanging together as an elegy. Goodbye Pork Pie Hat, originally a tribute to Lester Young, now with Joni’s words, grieves for Mingus too. Only The Dry Cleaner Of Des Moines has energy, with its boisterous horn section, arranged by Mingus himself. Short snippets of his homespun wisdom add some weight to proceedings but it’s Joni’s artwork that describes the story best. As she tried to capture his image, his essence, we witness her getting the measure of the man and imposing her own style and technique. Mingus has a lot more going for it than people will have you believe. Most of all, it’s an album packed with warmth and love.\n\nHer 1979 tour, captured on the double live album Shadows And Light, was her first appearance on stage since The Last Waltz in 1976. If there are any nerves, you can’t hear them. Her vocals are wonderful, better than many of the studio versions. The band consists of Pat Metheny on guitar, his keyboard player, Lyle Mays, the Weather Report rhythm section of Jaco Pastorius and Don Alias, Michael Brecker on saxophone, plus Joni herself. The Persuasions appear on two songs, including a spectral a capella Shadows And Light. There are a clutch of songs from Hissing Of Summer Lawns, most of Hejira and three from Mingus. There is a fire in this band that lights up these songs. Only a drum solo and Dreamland feature from Don Juan. Chaka Khan is sorely missed. Perhaps, the entirety of The Persuasions should have stood in for her. The concert concludes with a poignant rendition of Woodstock, played in the style of Hejira, its lyrics instantly recognisable but its melody stretched beyond any semblance of singalong. It illustrates just how far Joni had come as an artist and a performer. Metheny, perhaps forgetting he’d been booked to play a Joni Mitchell gig, complained the band was under-utilised, but Shadows And Light is one of the truly great live albums and a satisfying summary of her music of this period.\n\nThe Asylum Albums (1976-1980) is Joni Mitchell’s “jazz period”. She surrounded herself with jazz musicians, learnt a lot about chords and harmonics, wrote looser, freer songs, changed her vocal style, gliding effortlessly over a remarkable range of notes, and developed her guitar playing. Drawn to atmospherics, her favourite album is In A Silent Way and her go-to musicians fusion. She gave a lot to them, too. Herbie Hancock, for example, was smitten by her gifts and became a lifelong friend, recording the excellent River: The Joni Letters in 2007. Her lyrics hardened. The insightful balladeering of the sixties and early seventies grew more pragmatic. These albums sound very like jazz, but they are not jazz. Joni Mitchell struggled to improvise or introduce spontaneity into her music. Most egregiously, none of it swings. Without any big choruses or whistleable tunes, the demands on the listener are intense. Nevertheless, they remain superb albums because they are indelibly stamped by Joni herself. In her thirties, she embraced adventure and change, but whatever her influences, her records are all unmistakably Joni. The contents of The Asylum Albums (1976-1980) are wonderfully played, beautifully recorded and capture an artist at the peak of her creativity. It’s a stimulating listen from beginning to end.\n\nWhat does it all *mean*?\n\nThe Asylum Albums (1976-1980) marks the end of Joni Mitchell’s remarkable imperial phase, an over a decade long body of work worthy of comparison to Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and David Bowie. The Archives for this period should be very interesting, especially the build up to Mingus.\n\nThese albums were her last for Asylum. Are we going to see a Geffen Albums box?\n\nGoes well with…\n\nThe Reprise Albums (1968-1971), The Asylum Albums ( (1972-1975) and Archives Volumes 1-3.\n\nRelease Date:\n\n21st June 2024\n\nMight suit people who like…\n\nThe very best of modern popular music."
