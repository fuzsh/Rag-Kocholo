        "text": "About Rising Troublemaker\n\nThe world can feel like a dumpster fire, with endless things to be afraid of. It can make you feel powerless to ask for what you need, use your voice, and show up truly as your whole self. Add the fact that often, people might make you feel like your way of showing up is TOO MUCH. Luvvie encourages everyone to BE TOO MUCH, and to take up space for good. That is what it means to be a rising troublemaker.\n\nRISING TROUBLEMAKER is the young readers edition of Luvvie Ajayi Jones’ New York Times bestseller Professional Troublemaker. Luvvie uses her honesty and humor to inspire teens to face and fight their fears and start living their boldest life ASAP.\n\nIn this book, Luvvie gives young readers the permission they might need to be the troublemaker they are, or wish to be. This is the book Luvvie needed when she was the kid who got in trouble for speaking up about what she felt was not fair. This is the book that she needed when it was time to call herself a writer, but she was too scared. This is the book that teens can use to enact positive change in the world around them.\n\nRISING TROUBLEMAKER is perfect for teens who need to know that they are strong, they are powerful, and they can be the best version of themselves, regardless of who tries to stop them.\n\nThis book aims to help Rising Troublemakers know that the beautiful, audacious life they want is on the other side of doing the things that will scare you.\n\nWith her trademark charm and revelatory candor, Luvvie walks the reader through three basic tenets in RISING TROUBLEMAKER. In the BE section, she details the things we must get right within ourselves before we can do the things that scare us; in the SAY section, she pushes the reader to use their voice for their own greater good, and therefore everyone else’s; and in the DO section, she encourages us to put movement to that voice. Along the way, her razor-sharp wit and clear-eyed advice jump off the page.\n\nGeneration Z is our future, and they are dealing with life pressures at a younger age. They have language we didn’t have, and they are more aware of a world that is in constant chaos. They have more to be fearful of, and we need to embolden them. The goal is not to be fearless, but to not let their fears make them do less."
