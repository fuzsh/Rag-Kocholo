        "text": "Troy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\nThe 1970s changed the way we view music, from landmark albums for heavy metal to the best work coming from some of the most innovative and important artists of all time.\n\nWe saw the emergence of Michael Jackson. Bruce Springsteen became a voice of his generation. Bob Dylan, John Lennon and others reached new creative heights.\n\nHere’s a countdown of the 50 greatest albums of the decade, starting with a solo Beatle at No. 50...let us know what we missed.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n50. George Harrison - 'All Things Must Pass'\n\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney’s solo albums may get more attention. But you could make the case that Harrison released the best post-Beatles solo effort in 1970. “All Things Must Pass” is a complex triple album that’s aged very well, thanks to the strength of brilliant songs like “My Sweet Lord,” “What Is Life” and the moving title track.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Cleveland.com\n\n49. AC/DC - 'Highway to Hell'\n\nIn some ways, \"Highway To Hell\" is remembered as the final album before lead singer Bon Scott's passing. But it's also one of the definitive statements of hard rock and metal, as Scott's powerful voice paired with Angus Young's guitar blew everyone away.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Cleveland.com\n\n48. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young - 'Deja Vu'\n\n\"Deja Vu\" is an example of four gifted songwriters and musicians coming together to produce some of their best work. And everyone gets a chance to shine here, including Neil Young, showing early signs of the tremendous solo material that was to come.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Cleveland.com\n\n47. 'Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack'\n\nThe ultimate album that embodies the disco era. That may make some music elitists roll their eyes. But make no mistake, the Bee Gees-led soundtrack was a master class in pop song writing, creating timeless tune after timeless tune.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n46. Blondie - 'Parallel Lines'\n\nBlondie’s third album was a massive success, going on to sell 20 million copies worldwide. But it was also a groundbreaking achievement for helping establish New Wave and punk music as a mainstream force, setting the stage for the sound of the 1980s.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Cleveland.com\n\n45. Derek and the Dominos - 'Layla and Other Assorted Songs'\n\n\"Layla and Other Assorted Songs\" is a painful album about love (or more appropriately lust). But it also may be Eric Clapton's crowning achievement, dishing out pitch-perfect blues with some help from Duane Allman.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Cleveland.com\n\n44. Deep Purple - 'Machine Head'\n\nYou can debate what Deep Purple's best album is. But \"Machine Head\" is the band's most important and one of the most important metal albums of all time. It's a big album from a mighty band, with one of the most memorable guitar riffs of all time on \"Smoke on the Water.\"\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n43. The Velvet Underground - 'Loaded'\n\n“Loaded” was Velvet Underground’s reluctant reach for mainstream success. In the process, the band crafted one of the finest rock albums in history, and one of its most influential. Songs like “Sweet Jane” and “Rock & Roll” made the record more accessible to future artists looking to establish their own form of experimental rock.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n42. The Beatles - 'Let It Be'\n\n“Let It Be” was the final Beatles album release, but was recorded before “Abbey Road.” Thus it’s never gotten true credit as a proper swan song. “Let It Be” was received with mixed reviews. But it features many highlights, including the iconic title track, McCartney and Lennon’s vocal harmonies on “Two of Us” and the touching sentiment of “Across the Universe.”\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n41. Elvis Costello - 'My Aim Is True'\n\nCostello released two great albums during the 1970s (the other being “This Year’s Model”). But his debut, “My Aim Is True,” stands as an impressive fusion of folk and blues, while drawing clear influence from The Clash. It’s quite simply one of the best debut albums in history.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n40. Bruce Springsteen - 'Darkness on the Edge of Town'\n\nThree years after “Born To Run,” Springsteen delivered an album full of rock and roll anthems about working class characters. It was a promising set of tunes that expanded the concept of the lost American dream that filled “Born to Run.”\n\nTroy L. Smith, Cleveland.com\n\n39. The Rolling Stones - 'Sticky Fingers'\n\nWith Mick Taylor on board, The Rolling Stones' sound got bigger and more expansive. \"Sticky Fingers\" produced songs that remain fan favorites, from the stunner that is \"Brown Sugar\" to the slow-moving \"Wild Horses.\"\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n38. Pink Floyd - 'The Wall'\n\nPink Floyd was prolific during the 1970s, notably releasing “The Dark Side of The Moon” earlier in the decade. To close out the decade, the band released its epic “The Wall,” which brilliantly explores concepts of abandonment and disenchantment. More importantly, the album features peak moments for several genres of the decade, including metal, disco and folk rock.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n37. The Stooges - 'Raw Power'\n\n“Raw Power” is an adequate way to describe The Stooges’ third album. A swaggering Iggy Pop and co-producer David Bowie built upon “Fun House’s” ferocity, creating a landmark achievement in punk rock that would influence artists like Black Flag and Nirvana.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n36. Black Sabbath - 'Black Sabbath'\n\nSome music historians will tell you it’s the album that invented heavy metal. Even if it’s not, Black Sabbath’s debut is certainly the album that showed just how potent metal music could be. It fused elements of psychedelic rock and blues to craft something new, ruled by doom and gloom. Rock music was never the same.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n35. The Allman Brothers Band - 'At Fillmore East'\n\nWidely considered one of the greatest live albums of all time, “At Fillmore East” brilliantly captures The Allman Brothers Band uncanny showmanship. The album arguably contains some of the best live moments ever recorded, from the thrilling opening of “Statesboro Blues” to the epic 23-minute closing of “Whipping Post.”\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n34. Kraftwerk - 'Trans-Europe Express'\n\nWhen you look at the way electronic music has shaped the current state of pop, you can’t help but give credit to Kraftwerk’s 1977 masterpiece. “Trans-Europe Express” is considered one of the most influential albums of all time, having inspired the work of everyone from Radiohead and Madonna to Depeche Mode and Bjork.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n33. Talking Heads - 'More Songs About Buildings and Food'\n\nThe Talking Heads’ second album was the band’s first step in finding its sound, which merged David Byrne’s compelling lyrics and voice with a barrage of influences that ranged from punk to funk. Much of that is owed to producer Brian Eno who was able to smooth out the edges of the band’s instrumentation, making it a stand out.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n32. Carole King - 'Tapestry'\n\nCarole King has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a songwriter, and rightfully so. But “Tapestry” alone should earn her induction as a performer. Numerous other artists have scored hits with covers of songs from “Tapestry,” as the album became a blueprint for just about every future female singer-songwriter searching for pop intimacy.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n31. Simon and Garfunkel - 'Bridge Over Troubled Water'\n\nThe final album from Simon & Garfunkel was quite the swan song. “Bridge Over Troubled Water” would foreshadow the diversity of Simon’s later solo work, which featured graceful texture and refined production. “Bridge Over Trouble Water” earned the Grammy for Album of the Year in 1971.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n30. John Lennon - 'Plastic Ono Band'\n\nLennon’s 1970 album is the best of his post-Beatles work, perfectly merging Lennon and Yoko Ono’s willingness to experiment with Phil Spector’s refined production. The album, which features some of Lennon’s best-known songs, reaffirmed his status as the voice of a generation.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n29. Patti Smith - 'Horses'\n\nIn 1975, Patti Smith released one of the best debut albums in rock history. “Horses” was an instant force of nature on the New York punk rock scene, creating a radical sound and style that would be emulated by a number of future acts.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n28. Van Morrison - 'Moondance'\n\nVan Morrison’s 1968 album, “Astral Weeks” was hailed by critics, but was by no means a commercial success. Morrison didn’t become a pop star until “Moondance,” the inventive and moody classic that features white-boy soul standards like “Into the Mystic” and “Glad Tidings.”\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n27. Elton John - 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'\n\nElton John’s 1973 double album has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide thanks to huge classics like “Candle in the Wind” and “Bennie and the Jets.” But more than that, it signifies the peak moment for an artist who found ways to combine elements of soft rock with a progressive mindset. At the time, there was nothing else like “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.”\n\nTroy L. Smith, Cleveland.com\n\n26. Van Halen - 'Van Halen'\n\nEddie Van Halen may have had the most mind-boggling guitar sounds since Jimi Hendrix and he proved it on his band's debut album. \"Van Halen\" instantly put hard rock music back in the mainstream, while establishing a new benchmark for the genre.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n25. Television - 'Marquee Moon'\n\nTelevision’s debut album remains unlike anything you’ve ever heard. It was an ambitious effort that reached to create new sonic heights known as art rock. In many ways it was the first indie-rock record of the 1980s, clearly far ahead of its time in combining post-punk and new wave in genius ways.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n24. Funkadelic - 'Maggot Brain'\n\nThe opening title track to Funkadelic’s 1971 album is one of the biggest mind-blowing “You ain’t heard nothing like this before” statements ever laid down. The 10-minute opening is just the tip of the iceberg for Funkadelic’s third album, which changed what funk music and rock in general could sound like.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n23. Sex Pistols - 'Never Mind the Bollocks'\n\nThe Sex Pistols only proper studio album is one of the most important albums ever released. The album was actually a bit of a compilation, as some of the tracks were a few years old. Still, it remained a game changer. “Never Mind the Bollocks” was a shock to the system, laying down the blue print for punk music with reckless abandoned.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Cleveland.com\n\n22. David Bowie - 'Low'\n\nGetting off drugs aided Bowie's creative drive. The result was \"Low,\" and album that paired the star with producer Brian Eno for a recording that would forever influence the indie genre with its iconic soundscapes.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n21. Joni Mitchell - 'Blue'\n\nMitchell took a break from music and ended splitting with boyfriend Graham Nash before writing “Blue.” In one sense, this masterpiece is a breakup album. But, ironically, its power stemmed from her new relationship with James Taylor, which served as the inspiration for stunning tracks like “Blue” and “All I Want.”\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n20. The Clash - 'The Clash'\n\nThe Clash’s 1977 debut album was a raw punch to the gut for punk fans and is considered by many to be their favorite Clash album. The group would go on to expand its sound, but never sounded quite as raw and full of rage as on tracks like “White Riot” and “London’s Burning.”\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n19. Neil Young - 'After The Gold Rush'\n\nYoung seemed like he was out to prove something in 1970, after recording the massively successful “Déjà vu” with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. In retrospect, the super group may have provided the inspiration for Young’s best work. “After the Gold Rush” is as good as folk rock gets and one of the rare albums (along with “Harvest”) featuring production worth of Young’s lyrics.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n18. Michael Jackson - 'Off The Wall'\n\n“Off the Wall” may have officially been Michael Jackson’s fifth solo album. But it was unquestionably his coming out party. The album’s mix of disco, pop and soul was a major breakthrough from Jackson, who went from the lovable kid of the Jackson 5 to a true artist.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n17. Stevie Wonder - 'Songs in the Key of Life'\n\nPerhaps no artist had a better run during the 1970s than Stevie Wonder. His 1976 effort, “Songs in the Key of Life,” has become Wonder’s signature album and a standard of R&B for generations of performers, including Prince, Mariah Carey and Usher.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Cleveland.com\n\n16. The Eagles - 'Hotel California'\n\nThe is The Eagles greatest moment and one where the stars aligned perfectly. They were committed to perfection. And while the band's songwriting remained intact, the inclusion of Joe Walsh pushed them even further sonically. \"Hotel California\" is an album about the cost of fame, but also the record that gave the band every bit of it.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n15. Sly & the Family Stone - 'There's a Riot Goin' On'\n\nSly and the Family Stone’s hard-hitting fifth album title was a response to Marvin Gaye’s classic “What’s Goin’ On.’ Where Gaye’s music contains a sense of sadness and a longing for hope, Stone and company where waging musical war. The album’s lyrical message can be a bit confusing, but was very much reflective of the times. Musically, “Riot” was a stunning achievement of musicianship at its highest levels. The revolution resonated through your speakers.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n14. Miles Davis - 'Bitches Brew'\n\n“Bitches Brew” is the pinnacle of modern jazz, changing the idea of what jazz music was at the time. This was cool jazz, but perhaps a better way to describe it was jazz future generations could get behind. “Bitches Brew” saw Miles Davis re-draw the lines of the genre by crafting an album that could influence artists like A Tribe Called Quest and Radiohead at the same time.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Cleveland.com\n\n13. Black Sabbath - 'Paranoid'\n\nBlack Sabbath's second album is the one that defined heavy metal as a genre. With songs like \"Iron Man,\" \"War Pigs\" and the punishing title track, the band carved out the blueprint for the genre, making \"Paranoid\" one of the most important records of all time.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n12. Ramones - 'Ramones'\n\nHere’s where real punk rock was born. The Ramones debut album set the stage for an entire genre, while showing future generations of metal, indie-rock and grunge acts just how music with attitude should properly be done. Future punk rock records would be more popular, but none more influential. “Ramones” and its speed-thrash music was as ferocious a statement as rock music had ever seen.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n11. The Who - 'Who's Next'\n\nTrack for track, The Who’s “Who’s Next” may be the best pure rock album of all time. It also may contain the best combination of opening and closing tracks (“Baba O’Riley”/”Won’t Get Fooled Again”) that one album has. While its predecessor, “Tommy,” showcased the band’s genius, “Who’s Next” was more authentic and a better indication of where The Who stand in the history or rock. That’s near the top.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n10. Pink Floyd - 'The Dark Side of the Moon'\n\nPink Floyd’s eighth album seems almost mythological at this point, as some sort trippy pop-culture experiment. What’s more substantial is that “The Dark Side of the Moon” stands as one of the best produced and engineered albums of all-time, and one of the most visionary. Without it, we would not have an album like Radiohead’s “OK Computer.”\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n9. David Bowie - 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust...'\n\nBowie’s fifth album was groundbreaking in terms of themes like drugs, sexuality and politics. But don’t let the album’s conceptual nature overshadow just how stunning it is in terms of melody and instrumentation. It’s a cornerstone of both the glam rock and art rock genres.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n8. Led Zeppelin - 'Led Zeppelin IV'\n\nAt this point, it’s sort of cliché to call “Led Zeppelin IV” your favorite Led Zeppelin album. But it’s also hard not to when it contains several of the band’s standards, including “Black Dog,” “Stairway to Heaven” and “When the Levee Breaks.” The album fully defined what hard rock was in the 1970s, toeing the line between hard rock, blues and folk.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n7. Fleetwood Mac - 'Rumours'\n\n“Rumours” is the sound of a band ripping apart from the inside, but taking all that pain and heartache and turning it into some of the most compelling music of all time. Ironically, “Rumours’” success allowed Fleetwood Mac to last for several more years. Sonically, the album went on to influence various pop-rock acts.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n6. Stevie Wonder - 'Innervisions'\n\n“Innervisions” is Stevie Wonder’s magnum opus, showcasing the full range of what he was capable of as a musical genius. Wonder famously played every instrument on seven of the album’s nine tunes, helping create a cohesive effort that contained elements of rock, soul, funk and folk music. And mixed in with the musical brilliance was a message about being black in America and fighting through struggles to secure some form of happiness and spirituality.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n5. Bob Dylan - 'Blood on the Tracks'\n\nTension in Bob Dylan’s personal life drove “Blood on the Tracks,” making it one of his most personal and vulnerable records. In fact, it changed the way the world viewed the elusive singer-songwriter. No longer was he just an artist of the 1960s. He was shaping yet another decade with a more mature sound and flawless production.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n4. The Clash - 'London Calling'\n\nThe Clash let it all hang out on its third album, both in terms of the music and message. “London Calling” covered a variety of themes, from drugs and unemployment to racism and social unrest. Musically, the band moved on from raw punk rock, mixing elements of pop, hard rock, reggae, ska and R&B. The album is the blueprint on how to express political ideas as an engaging art form. As much as any record of the past 40 years, “London Calling” represents the rebellious spirit of rock and roll.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n3. Bruce Springsteen - 'Born to Run'\n\nForty-plus years later, and the themes of Bruce Springsteen’s greatest album still resonate. “Born to Run” isn’t just about the decline of the American dream, it’s about both the hope and hopelessness that comes with it. It’s a coming-of-age tale told by one of the most gifted songwriters of all time with one of the greatest backing bands behind him.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n2. Marvin Gaye - 'What's Going On'\n\nMarvin Gaye had spent the first chunk of his career crafting albums reflective of the romantic struggles and triumphs of his personal life. But for 1971’s “What’s Going On,” it appeared the R&B icon simply couldn’t ignore what was going on in society anymore. The title “What’s Going On” isn’t so much a question, but the only conceivable statement that could sum up the poverty, drugs, strife and war consuming the nation.\n\nThe concept album, scored beautifully by the Funk Brothers, comes together as one heartbreaking piece of soulful orchestration that begs you to open your eyes. With “What’s Going On,” Gaye firmly stepped out of the happy-go-lucky nature of Motown and he was never the same again. Neither was R&B music.\n\nTroy L. Smith, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\n1. The Rolling Stones - 'Exile On Main St.'\n\n“Exile on Main St.” is a masterpiece of soulful rock driven by gritty guitars and tons of swagger. Because it’s a double album, “Exile” doesn’t just feature hit upon hit. Instead, it takes listeners on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, from the gospel sounds of “Tumbling Dice” to the raw despair of “Ventilator Blues” to the freewheeling drive of “Let It Loose.” More than any other album, “Exile” is the sound of The Stones unleashing everything they’re capable of. And thus, it may have been the ultimate sound of the 1970s."
