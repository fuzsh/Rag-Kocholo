        "text": "Introduction\n\nI first discovered Dick Gaughan in 1972 when, looking for a version of Hamish Henderson's `The John MacLean March', I bought `No More Forever'. Since then I have followed him avidly and seen him live, in Bath, several times. I wasn't so keen on the openly political stance he adapted as he veered away from his traditional folk roots, but after hearing him discuss so sensibly on rec.music.celtic I think his political recordings need reviewed with a more open mind.\n\nHe is a working-class Lowland Scot from Edinburgh coming from typical Irish/Highland Scot descent. Brought up with the customary Scottish socialist vision he has always been of the Left in his politics. Quite typical of his generation. I think the quality of his singing and his guitar-playing unmatched in these islands. And he can write a song.\n\nDick Gaughan has a Website at http://www.dickalba.demon.co.uk/ where he has a partially complete Discography with his own personal notes about the recording details of the albums. A visit to the site is a necessary pilgrimage for fans.\n\nReview\n\nBath Guildhall, Thursday 25 May 1995.\n\nGreatness. He has that stamp about him now. It comes from his inner confidence as an artist as he ages into maturity. There is a tremendous authority in his singing and guitar-playing. His only weakness is that in his search for new songs he tends to be drawn to weaker political material. But then he is a Scots-Irish troublemaker at heart. Like most people from the Scottish Central Belt.\n\nThe standout song of the evening was a capella rendition of `Bogie's Bonnie Belle'. I had always thought that this was a Davie Stewart song but Dick didn't seem to think so. The mix of songs was mainly classical contemporary (eg `Banks of Sicily', `Schooldays Over' etc) with the occasional classic traditional folk song thrown in. The very modern work, apart from `Both Sides of the Tweed', `Song for Ireland', `The Diggers Song' and perhaps a couple of others seemed weaker.\n\nThe voice and guitar were absolutely magnificent. This is the best I have ever heard from him. The one song I would like to have heard was `MacCrimmon's Lament' but I wasn't to be so lucky. I can't wait for the next time he comes to Bath.\n\nDiscography\n\nThe Gaughan album I haven't got is `Folk Freak 2' which is a session album. Tom Loock has suppled details of `Folk Freak 2' and David Lashbrook has supplied `Songs of Ewan MacColl' as well as correcting my mistakes. I have since bought `Songs of Ewan MacColl' on CD. Mike Fordyce came in with `Woody Lives', a tribute to Woody Guthrie, which is also new to me. Sally Greenberg added lots of bits and pieces. Alistair Banfield added Matt McGinn's `Take me back to the Jungle'.\n\nIf anybody has anything to add I am Douglas Clark (d.g.d.clark@bath.ac.uk).\n\nTake me back to the Jungle..1971\n\n1971 Matt McGinn/Take me back to the Jungle RCA INTS 1240 Dick Gaughan plays guitar and mandolin throughout.
