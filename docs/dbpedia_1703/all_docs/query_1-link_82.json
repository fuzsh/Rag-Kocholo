        "text": "LONDON -- Sinéad O’Connor, an Irish singer-songwriter who topped the charts in 1990 with the ballad “Nothing Compares 2 U,” and stirred controversy with rebellious anthems and her behavior, has died at 56.\n\nO’Connor’s family announced the death in a statement Wednesday, released to Irish media, The Washington Post reported. Additional details were not immediately available.\n\nShe was a lifelong non-conformist who defied expectations of how a pop artist should behave. She would say that she shaved her head in response to record executives pressuring her to be conventionally glamorous — but her political and cultural stances and troubled private life often overshadowed her music, The Associated Press said.\n\nShe feuded with Frank Sinatra over her refusal to allow the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at one of her shows. She accused rock legend Prince of physically threatening her. In 1989 she declared her support for the Irish Republican Army, a statement she retracted a year later. Around the same time, she skipped the Grammy ceremony, saying it was too commercialized.\n\nA longtime critic of the Catholic Church, O’Connor made headlines when she tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II while appearing live on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” in October 1992 and denounced the church as the enemy.\n\nDeclaring that she was “proud to be a troublemaker,” O’Connor made music that channeled and reflected her tumultuous personal life, with lyrics about sexism, religion, child abuse, famine and police brutality set against reggae beats, traditional Irish melodies and throbbing pop hooks.\n\nShe began singing on the streets of Dublin and rose to international fame. Her debut album in 1987, “The Lion and the Cobra,” made her a star..\n\nIn 1990 she topped charts around the world with a cover of Prince’s ballad “Nothing Compares 2 U,” a seething, shattering performance that was heightened by a promotional video featuring the gray-eyed O’Connor in intense close-up, The AP said.\n\n“Nothing Compares 2 U” received three Grammy nominations and was the featured track off her acclaimed album “I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got,” which helped lead Rolling Stone to name her Artist of the Year in 1991.\n\n“She proved that a recording artist could refuse to compromise and still connect with millions of listeners hungry for music of substance,” the magazine declared.\n\nO’Connor caused uproar in Ireland in 1999 when she became a priestess of the breakaway Latin Tridentine Church — a position not recognized by the mainstream Catholic Church. For many years, she called for a full investigation into the extent of the church’s role in concealing child abuse by clergy.\n\nPope Benedict XVI apologized to Ireland in 2010 to atone for decades of abuse, but O’Connor condemned the apology for not going far enough and called for Catholics to boycott Mass until there was a full investigation into the Vatican’s role, which by 2018 was making international headlines, The AP said.\n\nPeople assumed I didn’t believe in God. That’s not the case at all. I’m Catholic by birth and culture and would be the first at the church door if the Vatican offered sincere reconciliation,” she wrote in the Washington Post in 2010.\n\nO’Connor announced in 2018 that she had converted to Islam and would be adopting the name Shuhada’ Davitt, later Shuhada Sadaqat — although she continued to use Sinéad O’Connor professionally."
