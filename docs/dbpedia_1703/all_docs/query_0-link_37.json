Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life\n\n2. David Bowie - Station to Station\n\n3. Jorge Ben - Africa Brasil\n\nSongs in the Key of Life is Stevie's sprawling, ambitious double album, the sort of album that every great artist tries at least once. Stevie manages it better than most though, with wonderful tracks like \"As\" & \"Isn't She Lovely\" & \"Sir Duke\". The album is 100+ minutes, so I don't often get through it all in one sitting, but every time I do, it feels fresh and like I'm hearing it for the first time.\n\nBowie's Station to Station is one of my favourite Bowie albums, and in Golden Years might have (maybe...) my favourite Bowie song. It has Bowie in transition, between the soulful funkier stuff he'd been doing the last few records, and heralding the start the newer, more abstract directions he'd really run with on the Berlin trilogy of records. A really fascinating record.\n\nJorge Ben's Africa Brasil is a brilliant collection of Ben's blend of samba, with more traditional African and Afro-Brazilian rhythms. A life affirming and joyful record that never fails to get me grooving in some form.\n\nHonourable mentions;\n\nThe Ramones - Ramones; I'm not a huge fan of The Ramones overall, but their debut album basically functions as a greatest hits. Incredibly simple music (in a good way), and massively influential on all the upcoming punk bands.\n\nBlondie - Blondie: There's better Blondie albums to come, but this is a great debut, full of attitude, while still writing perfect power pop songs.\n\nThin Lizzy - Jailbreak: Much better than I originally gave them credit for, this is a great blues-rock album that sounds far closer to Van Morrison than I expected it to.\n\nMarvin Gaye - I Want You: A soulful and funky Marvin Gaye record, and a bit more disco-ish than he'd previously been. Lots of synths, and reminds me a lot of the sort of music that became popular again with the \"neo-soul\" revival in the 90s/00s.\n\nTom Waits - Small Change: Another of Waits distinctive blend of jazz and blues, with his gravelly and raspy voice, and instantly recognisable storytelling style of lyricism.\n\nI was planning to skip Blondie’s debut because I’ve never heard much about it, but you’ve sold me. I’ll try to get it in this week\n\nAlso incredibly happy to see not only Jorge Ben there, but also that our Thin Lizzy week clearly had an impact."
