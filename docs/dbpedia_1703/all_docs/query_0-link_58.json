But to help you celebrate the prolific work of Nelson yourself, we’re also giving away a massive vinyl prize pack.\n\nCourtesy of Sony Legacy, the bundle features 14 albums from across Willie Nelson’s career. Red Headed Stranger is of course part of the package, as are his solo records The Troublemaker (1976), Last Man Standing (2018), God’s Problem Child (2017), Band of Brothers (2014).\n\nRelated Video\n\nAlso included are collaborative efforts like 2015’s Django & Jimmie with Merle Haggard, Nelson’s 2013 collection of duets with female singers To All the Girls…, 2013’s standards album Let’s Face the Music and Dance, 2014’s December Day: Willie’s Stash, Vol. 1 with his sister Bobbie Nelson, and 2017’s follow-up with sons Luke and Micah Nelson Willie and the Boys: Willie’s Stash, Vol. 2. In addition you’ll get tribute albums like 2016’s For the Good Times: A Tribute to Ray Price, 2016’s Summertime: Willie Nelson Sings Gershwin, and 2018’s collection of Frank Sinatra tunes My Way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRounding out the massive selection is the 1976 compilation featuring Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser Wanted!
