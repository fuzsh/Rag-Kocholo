        "text": "Billie Joe Armstrong “ain’t no effin Justin Bieber!” True that…’cause Justin Bieber doesn’t throw F-bomb-laden tantrums from the stage when he doesn’t get his way. With that said, Justin Bieber hasn’t been releasing credible punk rock records like Billie Joe Armstrong and Green Day have for over 20 years either. Back in 2012, Green Day unleashed their first of three new albums to be released over the following four months. “Uno” finds the band leaving bloated Who-inspired rock opera mode and entering into Who-inspired, tightly rocking “Dookie” singles rock. This album has more in common with their “Foxboro Hot Tub” alter ego release, featuring 12 tightly-wound ‘60s-inspired rockin’ singles, than with the rebellion of “American Idiot” or “21st Century Breakdown.” Any way you look at it, Green Day are back and better than ever…let’s just hope Armstrong gets his act together in time for their world tour early next year."
