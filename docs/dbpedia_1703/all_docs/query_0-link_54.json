        "text": "“It could be argued that this is one of the greatest rock n’ roll records of all time! Straight from Zambia, we have “My Ancestors”. A tough rock and roll masterpiece like no other. Over-ridden fuzz guitars, pop melodies and even a Black Sabbathesque sounding song. Comes in an old school ‘tip on’ cover. Must be heard to be believed.”\n\nThroughout the late 60’s/early 70’s when afrobeat and highlife was a staple part of the African music scene, something different was emerging and bubbling away under the surface.\n\nNow known as Zamrock, this genre of music emerged in Zambia in the 1970’s and is the product of the combined sounds of traditional African music and psych-rock and funk. What a gorgeous fusion!!! With the rawness of Jimi Hendrix and James Brown, the heavy repetitive riff-based melodies of bands such as Black Sabbath, the Rolling Stones, Deep Purple and Cream, Zamrock had a wealth of influences to draw upon. Couple this with traditional African rhythms and out came this new breed of sound-beast!\n\nThere are a few artists that are generally credited as the creators of this genre and these include, Rikki Ililonga and his band, Musi-O-Tunya, WITCH, The Peace, Amanaz, Paul Ngozi and his Ngozi Family and (today’s artist) Chrissy “Zebby” Tembo,\n\nChrissy Zebby Tembo is the drummer of the Ngozi family. Active in the mid 70’s, Tembo released two albums, for which My Ancestors was his 1976 debut. Full of wild fuzz guitars, African beats and extra-cool vocals, his first record has been described as easily one of the best African psychedelic rock albums ever recorded! Sang in English, this music is so raw, rough and full of the darkest, organic psych rock you’ll hear!! Original albums on Chris Edition label are rare as gold dust too!!\n\nTrouble Maker was the first track that introduced me to Chrissy Zebby Tembo and if you like this I can guarantee you’ll love the whole record!! Check it out above."
