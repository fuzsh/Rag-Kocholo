        "text": "After more than four decades together, 38 SPECIAL continues to bring a signature blast of Southern Rock to over 100 cities a year. And at each and every show, thousands of audience members are amazed by the explosive power of the band's performance.\n\nTheir many Gold and Platinum album awards stand in testament to the endurance of a legendary powerhouse.\n\nWith sales in excess of 20 million, most associate the band with their arena-rock pop smashes, âHold On Loosely,â âRockinâ Into the Night,â âCaught Up in You,â âFantasy Girl,â âIf Iâd Been the One,â âBack Where You Belong,â âChain Lightninâ,â âSecond Chance,â and more â Timeless hits that remain a staple at radio, immediately recognizable from the first opening chord, and paving the way to their present-day touring regimen.\n\nGuitarist/vocalist DON BARNES says it's all about maintaining that intensity in their live shows. âWe never wanted to be one of those bands that had maybe gotten a little soft or complacent over the years. We're a team, and it's always been kind of an unspoken rule that we donât slack up, we stack up. We go out there every night to win.â\n\nSince 1976, the band has released more than 15 albums. And from the start, theyâve toured relentlessly, bringing their signature brand of âmuscle and melodyâ to fans worldwide. It is that steely determination that lives on in the hearts of these âWild-Eyed Southern Boys.'\n\nFor 38 Special, being onstage is a celebration of camaraderie and brotherhood, a precision unit bringing the dedication and honesty to a long history of classic songs, as well as surprisingly fresh new material. The current lineup includes Guitarist/vocalist DON BARNES, keyboardist/vocalist BOBBY CAPPS, drummer GARY MOFFATT, bassist BARRY DUNAWAY and guitarist JERRY RIGGS.\n\nBarnes adds, \"This music keeps our wheels on the road. We're a band that's tried to stay honest with what has driven us over the years. We started out with nothing but bold determination to make our own history and to endure. Looking back now, it has been our greatest pride to have persevered and attained that level of success and longevity. For us, it's the ultimate validation.â\n\nâThe magic's still there,â adds Barnes. \"It's an emotional high for us to keep 'bringing it' after all these years. When those lights go down and we all walk up those steps to the stage and hear that crowd roar, itâs a real rush to the head. It feels like we're getting ready to strap ourselves in and it just takes off from there.\"\n\nDon Barnes\n\nDon Barnes is the consummate musician. He is a gifted singer, songwriter, performer, guitarist, instrumentalist, and producer. However, his talent is not merely the result of inherent genius, but of years of persistence, determination, self-discipline, sweat, and good old-fashioned hard work. In essence, Don is a self-made man.\n\nAs a seasoned music veteran, Don is one of those exceptional artists who continue to improve over time. He still possesses the passion, skills, and confidence needed to excel in the ever-changing musical landscape. Always one to challenge himself, and driven to perfection, Don's soulful vocals, prolific songwriting, and red-hot guitar-playing have never been better.\n\nOffstage, there is more to Don Barnes than meets the eye. He is as witty, intelligent, and personable as he is talented. Although his love for music is consistently apparent, it is his appreciation of the fans that leaves a lasting impression.\n\nBobby Capps\n\nThe man pounding the boards!\n\nHaving played throughout Florida's local club scene, Arkansas native Bobby Capps has found his home as keyboardist and vocalist for 38 Special. Since 1991, Bobby's contributions have helped round out the band's distinctive southern sound.\n\nAlthough he usually provides backup vocals, takes the lead on the song, \"Second Chance,\" a staple of the band's live medley.\n\nAlong with Chris Henderson of 3 Doors Down, Bobby, owns the full-service Rivergate Studios in Hendersonville, TN.\n\nGary Moffatt\n\nMONSTER Drummer Gary Moffatt has the admiration of the band's die-hard supporters. He is one of the few percussionists who can entertain a crowd with an extended drum solo.\n\nGary's electrifying, skin-pounding talents even \"scare\" Donnie - a compliment, to be sure. His tight fills and steely-hard backbeats are the foundation of 38's hard-driving rhythms.\n\nDespite his intimidating, massive presence, Gary is a humble, friendly man who enjoys meeting the fans.\n\nGary has recently complete work on an instructional video for Drum School This amazing video is for drummers of all levels. Gary demonstrates the ultimate goal...he utilizes all the sticking patterns and hand & foot combinations contained throughout this video. Gary shows you how to apply these exercises to music. He adds his own personal technique and style to his performance. Gary also displays his versatility around the drum kit, by playing a few different styles of music. The music Gary performs encompasses a wide variety of styles ranging from Funk to driving Progressive Rock with numerous timing changes, feels, and moods. This video is a MUST HAVE if you are learning to play the drums.\n\nEndorsements: PEARL Drums, EVANS Drumheads, SABIAN Cymbals, VIC FIRTH Drumsticks, AUDIX Microphones, & GROOVEJUICE\n\nFor more information about Gary check out his personal website: GaryMoffatt.com\n\nBarry Dunaway\n\nBarry is a gifted and versatile bassist, singer and songwriter.
