I think Blues music continues to generate a devoted following worldwide for the same reason. Not only in Greece. Blues will always be around!\"\n\nBill Markos: Troublemaker Blues\n\nGreek musician Bill Markos (Vasilis Markos) was born in 1976 in Germany. He began music lessons in Greece as a teenager and in the early 90s he joined his first band DIRTY FLOWERS. In 2006 he formed his own band TUBESCREAMERS and he wrote the music of the 2 Tubescreamers albums: Tubescreamers (2011) and The Reply (2013). He made many cooperations with artists from Greece and other countries and slowly growed his own fan club. In 2019 he released with cdbaby 2 singles. The Bottom line and Change. In 2020 also 2 singles Out of the Blue and Memories. His latest work is a solo Blues album, titled “Troublemaker” (2021). (Photo: Bill Markos)\n\nThe record has 8 tracks. Bill Markos did everything in this album. He played all the instruments, wrote the music and lyrics and also made the mix and the mastering. Bill talks about his new album, the Blues, and local scene.\n\nInterview by Michael Limnios\n\nHow has the Blues and Rock Counterculture influenced your views of the world and the journeys you’ve taken?\n\nI think Blues and Rock is a way of life. Both genres can offer something different. Blues can reveal the problems and troubles of people and Rock can reveal anger and power. All these emotions can make you see life with a different view.\n\nHow do you describe your sound, music philosophy and songbook? Where does your creative drive come from?\n\nI would describe my sound old school with modern notes. Creativity can come from many things. A hard time, a happy time. From simple things in everyday life.\n\nHow do you think that you have grown as an artist since you first started making music?\n\nI suppose after all these years I am more experienced. I was always trying to play with better musicians than me and this is a serious step to move on.\n\nWhat has remained the same about your music-making process?\n\nThe way I create the songs. I always write first the music and then the lyrics. I don’t know if this is the right way, but it works for me.\n\n\"I think Blues and Rock is a way of life. Both genres can offer something different. Blues can reveal the problems and troubles of people and Rock can reveal anger and power. All these emotions can make you see life with a different view.\" (Photo: Bill Markos, Greece)\n\nDo you have any stories about the making of the new album, gigs, and jams, which you’d like to share with us?\n\nMy new album was made during the covid Quarantine. All this time was creative for me.\n\nWhat do you miss most nowadays from the music of the past? What are your hopes and fears for the future of?\n\nIn the past there were so many bands, and the competition was high. Everyone was trying to make something unique. That’s why we had so many great records. I don’t want to be pessimist, but we are having hard times. All this situation forced many musicians to quit. I want to believe that this will end soon.\n\nIf you could change one thing in the Greek Blues Scene and it would become a reality, what would that be?\n\nI would open more music venues.\n\nWhy do you think that the Blues music continues to generate such a devoted following in Greece?\n\nBlues is truth. Blues is life itself. This has an impact to everyone. Everybody has the Blues like the great Albert King said. I think Blues music continues to generate a devoted following worldwide for the same reason. Not only in Greece. Blues will always be around!\n\nWhat are some of the most important lessons you have learned from your experience in the music paths?\n\nThat detail makes the difference!\n\nBill Markos - Home"
