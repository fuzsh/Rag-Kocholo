        "text": "Vinyl LP pressing including digital download. The Troublemaker is the 20th studio album by country singer and songwriter Willie Nelson. Produced by Arif Mardin, the album was recorded in two days at the Atlantic Records studio in New York City in February 1973. Nelson and his usual backup musicians were joined by Doug Sahm and his band. The release of the album was cancelled by Atlantic Records, that decided that the album was not right for the label. After Atlantic closed it,s experimental country music division, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records that gave him total creative control. After the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger, the label published The Troublemaker in 1976. It,s release had a good reception by the critics, while it charted on Billboard,s Top Country Albums and on Billboard 200, at number one and sixty respectively. The single \"Uncloudy Day\" charted at number four on Billboard,s Hot Country Singles."
