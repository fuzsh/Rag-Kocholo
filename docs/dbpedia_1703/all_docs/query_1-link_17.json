        "meta_description": "Trouble Maker by Roberta Kelly, released 01 May 1976\n\n1. Trouble Maker\n2. Love Power\n3. I Think I&#39;m Gonna Break Someone&#39;s Heart Tonight\n4. Innocent\n5. The Family\n\nRoberta Kelly (b. November 23, 1942, Los Angeles) came to Germany in 1972 to pursue her dreams of becoming a singer. When she met producer Pete Bellotte, the idea came to record an answer-back record to Carl Douglas&#39;s hugely popular Kung-Fu Fighting, and Roberta had her recording debut in December 1974 with Kung-Fu&#39;s Back Again. At the same time she did a session job with Gitta Walthers, Betsy Allen and Lucy O&#39;Neale, singing all the vocals for an album that was released under the name Silver Convention. Fly, Robin, Fly eventually was a global smash and a US #1 hit record. Roberta was very upset at the time that she was never credited nor asked to join the line-up who ended up promoting the song. Bellotte &amp; Giorgio Moroder recorded another single on her, Love Power, which was released in the summer of 1975, just when Roberta&#39;s friend Donna Summer also started making a lot of noise with her Love To Love You, Baby. In January 1976, Roberta recorded 4 more songs with team Moroder/Bellotte, and her debut album was released the following month. Her third single Trouble-Maker was a hit in France and Italy, and also topped the US disco charts for two weeks in July &#39;76. \r\n\r\nNote: The German album had The Family as track A2, and Love Power as track B3.",
