        "text": "I was roaming with no home\n\nNeed you near to calm the power of the storm\n\nLike a bark without a shore\n\nI just cannot be without you anymore\n\nThis is clearer, in the mirror, when you′re so close to me\n\nI can feel it just the way it's meant to be\n\nAlways something, keeps me coming, coming back to your heart\n\nBut you are just a troublemaker for my sun...\n\nLala lala lala la\n\nI′m nothing but a stranger\n\nLala lala lala la\n\nAm I running into danger?!\n\nYou came to me now\n\nLala lala la laaaai\n\nLala lala lala la\n\nI'm nothing but a stranger\n\nLala lala lala la\n\nAm I running into danger?!\n\nYou came to me now\n\nLala lala la laaaai\n\nWriter(s): Doru Todorut, George Calin<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
