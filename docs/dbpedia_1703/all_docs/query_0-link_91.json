        "text": "If recording artists could apply for tenure, like university professors, who would have the strongest application?\n\nUniversities award tenure based (mostly) on the quality and quantity of research that the professor publishes over a five or six-year period. Listeners could similarly award tenure to musicians based on the quality and quantity of music they release in a similar time period.\n\nBecause I thought up this absurd exercise, I nominate myself as the chair the recording artist tenure committee and am setting a few rules:\n\n1. A tenure packet includes all of the music that an artist released within in a period of less than six consecutive years. This period could occur at any point during an artist’s career, and artists could qualify more than once. Dylan made the list twice, once for his work in the mid 60s and again a decade later. Jason Isbell made the list 1.667 times, if you count a pair of Drive-by Truckers albums. Other amazing artists didn’t make it because their best work was spread across decades rather than clustered into a single five-year window (Tom Petty, The Cure, Nick Cave) or was released before albums were a thing (Hank Williams, Ray Charles).\n\n2. I judged the relative strength of tenure packets based on the quantity, quality, and influence of the music released within a qualifying time period.\n\nQuantity: It is difficult to earn tenure at research-focused universities in my field (marketing) without publishing at least three articles. Universities often want more, but three is the minimum. Similarly, I’m setting the minimum bar to make this list at three original albums released inside a six-year window. Some of my favorite artists (Outkast, Michael Kiwanuka) didn’t make it because they didn’t drop albums fast enough. Releasing more than three albums strengthened a packet, but once this bar was met, the strength of the tenure packets depended more on the quality and influence of the music than the number of releases.\n\nQuality: This is subjective. Universities judge the quality of a research paper based on the prestige of the journal in which it was published. I judged music quality based on how much I enjoy listening to it. Run DMC and Taylor Swift have been both productive and influential but are not on this list because I’ve never been able to make it through an entire album of theirs.\n\nInfluence: Influence is objective in theory, but difficult to measure in practice. Researchers count the number of times a paper has been cited as a proxy. Influence in music is harder to assess. Still, there are some differences in influence that we probably agree on. Bob Dylan was more influential than Joan Baez. The Beatles were more influential than Wings. This is why the fab four score high on this list even though I question their fabulousity.\n\n3. My goal is to evaluate which tenure applications (i.e., collections of music released in a six-year window) are the strongest. Here are my picks for the top 50.
