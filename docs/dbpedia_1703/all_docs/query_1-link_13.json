        "text": "'Troublemaker is a song by English singer-songwriter Olly Murs and features American rapper Flo Rida. It is the first single from Murs's third album Right Place Right Time and was released on 12 October 2012.\n\nIt reached number 1 on The UK Singles Chart.\n\nMusic Video[]\n\nThe video to Troublemaker was filmed in Los Angeles. The video features Murs entering a cafe where he meets a girl who is working there as a waitress, but is fired by her boss when she pours water on a customer after he smacks her.\n\nMurs is next seen entering a record shop where he meets the girl again who is working at the shop but once again gets fired when she can't hear what a customer is saying to her as she is listening to music with headphones on. Murs later sees the girl now working in a clothes shop dressing mannequins but when she notices Murs, she ends up causing the mannequins to fall apart. Flo Rida then appears in a billboard dancing next to two women in a car.\n\nMurs then appears in a nightclub with friends where he sees the girl across the room also with friends. Just then, the girl accidentally backs into a man carrying a tray of drinks and making them spill on another man who gets mad at the girl. Murs decides to help and goes over to the girl and the two try to leave, only to be stopped by one of the nightclub's bouncers."
