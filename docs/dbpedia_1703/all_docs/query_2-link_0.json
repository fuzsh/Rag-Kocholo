These recaps, as well as the weekly charts, do not reflect actual sales figures. The ratings take into account the number of weeks the disk was on the chart, plus the weekly positions it held during its chart life. Each disk was given points accordingly for its respective chart, and in addition, the number one disk each week was assigned bonus points equal to the total number of positions on its respective charts.\"[20]\n\nUnfortunately, Billboard's late December print deadline prevented approximately 60 records from completing their full chart runs, and includes data of approximately 50 records from 1976, some of which have enough points to rank in the current years chart. In contrast with the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1976, the chart below does not truncate or split chart runs between years. It does not add two months from 1975, delete two months from 1976 and then call itself the \"Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1976\", which it is obviously not. Joel Whitburn's Records Research books, archived issues of Billboard for November-December 1975 and December 1976-March 1976, and Hot 100 Year-End formulas were used to complete the year-end chart reprinted here.\n\nThe completed Billboard year-end list for 1976 is composed of records that entered the Billboard Hot 100 between November 1975 and December 1976. Records with chart runs that started in 1975 and ended in 1976, or started in 1976 and ended in 1976, made this chart if the majority of their chart weeks were in 1976. If not, they were ranked in the year-end charts for 1975 or 1976. If their weeks were equal, they were listed in the year they first entered. Appearing in multiple years is not permitted. Each week thirty points were awarded to the number one record, then nineteen points for number two, eighteen points for number three, and so on. The total points a record earned determined its year-end rank. The complete chart life of each record is represented, with number of points accrued. There are no ties, even when multiple records have the same number of points. The next ranking category is peak chart position, then weeks at peak chart position, weeks on Hot 100 chart, weeks in top forty, and finally weeks in top ten. All chart rankings represented below for the Top Soul Singles, Top Country Singles, Top Easy Listening Singles, and Top CashBox pop singles were all calculated in the same manner.\n\nThe chart can be sorted by Artist, Song title, Recording and Release dates, Cashbox year-end ranking (CB) or units sold (sales) by clicking on the column header. Additional details for each record can be accessed by clicking on the song title, and referring to the Infobox in the right column of the song page. Billboard also has chart summaries on its website. Sales information was derived from the RIAA's Gold and Platinum database, the BRIT Certified database and The Book of Golden Discs,[21] but numbers listed should be regarded as estimates.
