        "text": "Say Goodbye to Hollywood\n\nBobby's drivin' through the city tonight\n\nThrough the lights in a hot new rent-a-car\n\nHe joins the lovers in his heavy machine\n\nIt's a scene down on Sunset Boulevard\n\nSay goodbye to Hollywood\n\nSay goodbye, my baby\n\nSay goodbye to Hollywood\n\nSay goodbye, my baby\n\nJohnny's takin' care of things for a while\n\nAnd his style is so right for troubadours\n\nThey got him sitting with his back to the door\n\nNow he won't be my fast gun anymore\n\nSay goodbye to Hollywood\n\nSay goodbye, my baby\n\nSay goodbye to Hollywood\n\nSay goodbye, my baby\n\nMovin' on is a chance\n\nYou take any time you try to stay together\n\nSay a word out of line\n\nAnd you find that the friends you had\n\nAre gone forever, forever\n\nSo many faces in and out of my life\n\nSome will last some will just be now and then\n\nLife is a series of hellos and goodbyes\n\nI'm afraid it's time for goodbye again\n\nSay goodbye to Hollywood\n\nSay goodbye, my baby\n\nSay goodbye to Hollywood\n\nSay goodbye, my baby\n\nMovin' on is a chance you take\n\nAny time you try to stay, together, whoa\n\nSay a word out of line\n\nAnd you find that the friends you had\n\nAre gone forever, forever\n\nSo many faces in and out of my life\n\nSome will last, some will just be now and then\n\nLife is a series of hellos and goodbyes\n\nI'm afraid it's time for goodbye again\n\nSay goodbye to Hollywood\n\nSay goodbye, my baby\n\nSay goodbye to Hollywood\n\nSay goodbye, my baby\n\nSummer, Highland Falls\n\nThey say that these are not the best of times\n\nBut they're the only times I've ever known\n\nAnd I believe there is a time for meditation\n\nIn cathedrals of our own\n\nNow, I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes\n\nAnd I can only stand apart and sympathize\n\nFor we are always what our situations hand us\n\nIt's either sadness or euphoria\n\nSo we'll argue and we'll compromise\n\nAnd realize that nothing's ever changed\n\nFor all our mutual experience,\n\nOur separate conclusions are the same\n\nNow we are forced to recognize our inhumanity\n\nOur reason coexists with our insanity\n\nAnd though we choose between reality and madness\n\nIt's either sadness or euphoria\n\nHow thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies\n\nPerhaps we don't fulfill each other's fantasies\n\nAnd as we stand upon the ledges of our lives,\n\nWith our respective similarities\n\nIt's either sadness or euphoria\n\nAll You Wanna Do Is Dance\n\nOh, baby, you don't get turned on by the radio\n\nOh, baby, you got nothing to play on your stereo\n\n“Why don't the Beatles get back together?”\n\n“Why don't nobody sing of romance?”\n\nOh, baby, all you wanna do is dance\n\nOh, baby, I think you are lost in the Seventies\n\nOh, baby, “The music she ain't what she used to be”\n\nYou don't understand what they're saying,\n\nYou've given it every chance\n\nOh, baby, all you wanna do is dance\n\nWell you wish you were back in the good old daysv When tomatoes were cheaper\n\nAnd you never heard the words of your favorite songs\n\nThrough a three inch speaker\n\nAnd you never messed around with dangerous drugs\n\nYou were all getting sick on beer\n\nAnd you didn't get any unless you went steady\n\nand made out for a year\n\nWell you can hide away honey in your rock ‘n roll dreams\n\nAnd you can stand by your blue suede shoes\n\nBut the party is over and\n\nI'm getting tired of waiting for you\n\nOh, baby, “Where are the oldies they used to play?”\n\nOh, baby, you want to crawl back into yesterday\n\nYou don't want to deal with the future\n\nYou don't want to make any plans\n\nOh, baby, all you wanna do is dance\n\nOh, baby, all you wanna do is dance\n\nNew York State of Mind\n\nSome folks like to get away\n\nTake a holiday from the neighborhood\n\nHop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood\n\nBut I'm taking a Greyhound\n\nOn the Hudson River Line\n\nI'm in a New York state of mind\n\nI've seen all the movie stars\n\nIn their fancy cars and their limousines\n\nBeen high in the Rockies under the evergreens\n\nBut I know what I’m needing\n\nAnd I don't want to waste more time\n\nI'm in a New York state of mind\n\nIt was so easy living day by day\n\nOut of touch with the rhythm and blues\n\nBut now I need a little give and take\n\nThe New York Times, The Daily News\n\nIt comes down to reality\n\nWell it's fine with me ‘cause I've let it slide\n\nDon't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside\n\nI don’t have any reasons\n\nI've left them all behind\n\nI'm in a New York state of mind\n\nIt was so easy living day by day\n\nOut of touch with the rhythm and blues\n\nBut now I need a little give and take\n\nThe New York Times, The Daily News\n\nIt comes down to reality\n\nWell it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide\n\nI don’t care if it's Chinatown or on Riversidev I don’t have any reasons\n\nI’ve left them all behind\n\nI’m in a New York state of mind\n\nI'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River Line\n\n‘Cause I'm in a New York state of mind\n\nJames\n\nJames, we were always friends\n\nFrom our childhood days\n\nAnd we made our plans\n\nAnd we had to go our separate ways.\n\nI went on the road,\n\nYou pursued an education.\n\nJames, do you like your life?\n\nCan you find release?\n\nAnd will you ever change?\n\nWill you ever write your masterpiece?\n\nAre you still in school?\n\nLiving up to expectations?\n\nJames, you were so relied upon\n\nEverybody knows how hard you tried.\n\nHey, oh, look at what a job you've done\n\nCarrying the weight of family pride.\n\nJames, you've been well behaved\n\nYou've been working hard\n\nBut will you always stay\n\nSomeone else's dream of who you are?\n\nDo what's good for you\n\nOr you're not good for anybody\n\nJames\n\nI went on the road,\n\nYou pursued an education.\n\nJames, how you gonna know for sure?\n\nEverything was so well organized.\n\nHey, oh, now everything is so secure\n\nAnd everybody else is satisfied.\n\nJames, do you like your life?\n\nCan you find release?\n\nAnd will you ever change?\n\nWhen will you write your masterpiece?\n\nDo what's good for you\n\nOr you're not good for anybody\n\nJames\n\nPrelude, Angry Young Man\n\nThere's a place in the world for the angry young man\n\nWith his working class ties and his radical plans\n\nHe refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl\n\nAnd he's always at home with his back to the wall\n\nAnd he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost\n\nAnd he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross\n\nAnd he likes to be known as the angry young man\n\nGive a moment or two to the angry young man\n\nWith his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand\n\nHe's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood\n\nIt's a comfort to know his intentions are good\n\nAnd he sits in a room with a lock on the door\n\nWith his maps and his medals laid out on the floor\n\nAnd he likes to be known as the angry young man\n\nI believe I've passed the age\n\nOf consciousness and righteous rage\n\nI found that just surviving was a noble fight\n\nI once believed in causes too\n\nI had my pointless point of view\n\nAnd life went on no matter who was wrong or right\n\nThere's always a place for the angry young man,\n\nWith his fist in the air and his head in the sand\n\nAnd he's never been able to learn from mistakes\n\nSo he can't understand why his heart always breaks\n\nAnd his honor is pure and his courage as well\n\nAnd he's fair and he's true and he's boring as hell\n\nAnd he'll go to the grave as an angry old man\n\nAnd there's always a place for the angry young man\n\nWith his working class ties and his radical plansv He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl\n\nAnd he's always at home with his back to the wall\n\nAnd he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost\n\nAnd he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross\n\nAnd he likes to be known as the angry young man.\n\nI’ve Loved These Days\n\nNow we take our time so nonchalant\n\nAnd spend our nights so bon vivant\n\nWe dress our days in silken robes\n\nThe money comes the money goes\n\nWe know it's all a passing phase\n\nWe light our lamps for atmosphere\n\nAnd hang our hopes on chandeliers\n\nWe're going wrong we're gaining weight\n\nWe're sleeping long and far too late\n\nAnd so it's time to change our ways\n\nBut I've loved these days\n\nNow as we indulge in things refined\n\nWe hide our hearts from harder times\n\nA string of pearls, a foreign car\n\nOh we can only go so far\n\nOn caviar and cabernet\n\nWe drown our doubts in dry champagne\n\nAnd soothe our souls with fine cocaine\n\nI don't know why I even care\n\nWe get so high and get nowhere\n\nWe'll have to change our jaded ways\n\nBut I've loved these days\n\nSo, before we end and then begin\n\nWe'll drink a toast to how it's been\n\nA few more hours to be complete\n\nA few more nights on satin sheets\n\nA few more times that I can say\n\nI've loved these days\n\nMiami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\n\nI've seen the lights go out on Broadway\n\nI saw the Empire State laid low\n\nAnd life went on beyond the Palisades\n\nThey all bought Cadillacs\n\nAnd left there long ago\n\nWe held a concert out in Brooklyn\n\nTo watch the Island bridges blow\n\nThey turned our power down\n\nAnd drove us underground\n\nBut we went right on with the show\n\nI've seen the lights go out on Broadway\n\nI saw the ruins at my feet\n\nYou know we almost didn't notice it\n\nWe'd seen it all the time on 42nd Street\n\nThey burned the churches up in Harlem\n\nLike in that Spanish Civil War\n\nThe flames were everywhere\n\nBut no one really cared\n\nIt always burned up there before\n\nI've seen the lights go down on Broadway\n\nI watched the mighty skyline fall.\n\nThe boats were waiting at the Battery\n\nThe union went on strike\n\nThey never sailed at all\n\nThey sent a carrier out from Norfolk\n\nAnd picked the Yankees up for free\n\nThey said that Queens could stay\n\nThey blew the Bronx away\n\nAnd sank Manhattan out at sea\n\nYou know those lights were bright on Broadway\n\nBut that was so many years ago\n\nBefore we all lived here in Florida\n\nBefore the Mafia took over Mexico\n\nThere are not many who remember\n\nThey say a handful still survive\n\nTo tell the world about\n\nThe way the lights went out\n\nAnd keep the memory alive"
