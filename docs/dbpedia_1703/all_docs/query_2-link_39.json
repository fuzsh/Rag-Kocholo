        "text": "A little while ago, @timschochet posted his Top 100 Greatest Classic Rock Albums Of All Time, which spanned from 1967-1981. That list was well-thought out, entertaining, and sparked a lot of debate and conversation. There was some discussion as to what was considered classic rock, that additional artists should have been considered / included, and that some albums ranked too high / too low (or did not merit inclusion at all).\n\nTo expand the discussion on performers across that same timeframe, I decided to compile a list of the Top 250 Best Selling Rock Albums from those same years. If my math is right, there will be more albums and more artists on this list. I extended the boundaries of what is a \"rock\" artist to include some albums that got left off of the last list. Sorry to disappoint, but Barbra Streisand and ABBA still have been ruled out.\n\nWhat makes it and what doesn't?\n\n- Any rock album that was released in 1967-1981 . . . whether it got airplay or not, whether it charted or not, whether it had any singles or not (or whether it's any good or not).\n\n- Any album that has at least 50% new material . . . so most of the greatest hits compilations won't be considered.\n\n- IMO, I considered live albums as new recordings and count as new material, so live albums are fair game.\n\n- Soundtracks are included if they sold enough copies.\n\nTo further clarify, all I considered was total album sales . . . albums, cassettes, 8-tracks, CDs, paid full album downloads, or whatever else is considered an album sale. How many singles it had, how many YouTube or Spotify song plays it got, how many promos were given away for free . . . none of those count. Not total album sales through 1981 . . . total reported album sales through 2023.\n\nThe sales totals I researched are \"official.\" But official doesn't mean a whole heck of a lot. All that means is someone, somewhere, at some point filed paperwork alleging that ALBUM X sold a certain number of units worldwide. I have no idea if those records were audited and verified, if they were ever updated, how long ago those documents were filed, if someone got bribed to up the total, etc. Similarly, I cannot attest that every record label followed the same reporting criteria, that the sales office in Uganda submitted their sales numbers or not, or ultimately how accurate the total figures are.\n\nWhat does this all mean? All of these albums sold 3+ million copies. There are 17 albums that sold that many that AREN'T included, but I didn't feel like calling the thread the Top 267 albums. It also means that 20 albums from Tim's list didn't make the cut for this list.\n\nIt also means that there isn't any bias or opinion involved in the rankings. I didn't determine the rankings . . . it's just a ranking of reported sales figures. Don't like where your favorite album is ranked? Talk to the people that didn't buy a copy. You think people have no taste? Feel free to point out the error of their ears. Wouldn't wipe your bottom with this list, so be it.\n\nI suspect this will be an interesting list. I admit to not knowing some of the artists and some of the albums. That alone was very surprising. It was also eye opening to see just how well some performers sold. There are some albums listed here that I shelled out money for at least 5 times . . . for instance, the original vinyl album, a replacement vinyl album when the first one got played too much, an 8-track or a cassette, the CD, a deluxe edition CD, and a super deluxe anniversary edition).\n\nTo save time (and sanity), I will be posting the list of albums in groups of 5 to start. I haven't figured out how many to release at a time the closer we get to the end. I am sure there will be bedlam and outrage in the streets over some of the listings / results for albums. I have no idea how much availability I will have, so not sure how long it will be between updates. Anyway, that's the outline.\n\n#250 - STYX - Paradise Theater (1981) (3.16 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: The Best Of Times (#3 Billboard Singles Chart), Too Much Time On My Hands (#8), Nothing Ever Goes As Planner (#54), Rocking The Paradise (#8 Rock Chart), Snowblind (#22 Rock Chart)\n\nThis was the top-selling Styx album (but did not make Tim's list). The Grand Illusion was Tim's #67 album and Pieces of Eight was #92. Each of those sold 3.1 million copies and just missed the Top 250. I saw Styx several times over the years (basically once every 10 years), and they always put on an enjoyable show.\n\n#249 - LYNYRD SKYNYRD - One More From The Road (1976) (3.17 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: Live versions of Free Bird (#38), Gimme Three Steps (didn't chart), Sweet Home Alabama, T For Texas, Crossroads, most of their other hits)\n\nThe original 1976 release contained 14 tracks and for years was the only live album pre-plane crash (two came out in 2009). The deluxe edition that came out in 2001 featured 24 songs and clocks in at over 2.5 hours. For those that like live albums and Southern rock, the deluxe version is an enjoyable listen. Like Styx, this is the best-selling Skynyrd album . . . meaning none of their studio albums made this list.\n\n#248 - ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA - Discovery (1979) (3.182 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: Don't Bring Me Down (#4), Shine A Little Love #8), Confusion (#37), Last Train To London (#39), The Diary Of Horace Wimp (didn't chart)\n\nFor those too young to remember, ELO was big in the 70s and early 80s, ending up with 20 Top 40 hits on the US singles chart. Jeff Lynne later moved on to The Traveling Wilburys (who oddly enough never had a Top 40 single).\n\n#247 - STEVE MILLER BAND - Book Of Dreams (1977) (3.185 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: Jet Airliner (#8), Swingtown (#17), Jungle Love (#23)\n\nSteve Miller songs were all over the airwaves in the mid- to late 70's. His greatest hits album from that timeframe has sold over 15 million copies. Miller hasn't released any new studio material in 14 years, but that hasn't stopped him from touring almost every year since with a total of 1,700 shows across his career.\n\n#244T - BOB DYLAN - Street-Legal (1978) (3.2 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: Baby Stop Crying, Is Your Love In Vain?, Changing Of The Guards (all released as singles but didn't chart)\n\nThe album hit #11 on the Billboard album charts. Dylan has written some very popular songs, but I don't know any of the songs on this one.\n\n#244T - BOB DYLAN - John Wesley Harding (1968) (3.2 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: All Along The Watchtower (didn't chart), Title Track, I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\n\nJust like that, we get TWO Dylan albums. The JWH album has been included in Rolling Stone's Top 500 albums of all-time in the past (not sure if it's on the most recent list). I know some people will say this is folk and not rock, but it's in the rock universe.\n\n#250 - STYX - Paradise Theater (1981) (3.16 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: The Best Of Times (#3 Billboard Singles Chart), Too Much Time On My Hands (#8), Nothing Ever Goes As Planner (#54), Rocking The Paradise (#8 Rock Chart), Snowblind (#22 Rock Chart)\n\nI would have thought this would be higher than the other 4 in this group. In 1981, this album was as ubiquitous as they got, it seemed. But I guess it didn’t translate to album sales as much as I would have thought.\n\nThat early-80s arena rock space was pretty splintered back then. It was hard for fans of the genre to have ALL the hot albums of the time -- so I'm curious how much of a dent the availability of blank cassette tapes and then-current stereo systems put into some of these albums.\n\nSomething else: I kind of think Styx is not the kind of act that would get a big bump out of Internet-era metrics. So maybe Paradise Theater sold 2.5 million within, say, two years of release, but then has never really gotten big Internet numbers to \"pad their stats\".\n\nI dunno ... just some working theories.\n\nOne more: Styx released a lot of albums relatively close together (especially by today's standards). They could have cannibalized from each to some extent.\n\n#244T - BILLY SQUIER - Don't Say No (1981) (3.2 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: The Stroke (#17), In The Dark (#35), My Kinda Lover (#45), Lonely Is The Night (#28 AOR Chart)\n\nDon't Say No was one of Squier's two Top 5 albums and featured half of his four Top 40 hits. He timed the MTV era and big hair rock scene just right. He had 3-4 years where he was a regular on FM radio.\n\n#243 - ELVIS PRESLEY - Elvis In Concert (1977) (3.204 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: My Way (#22), America (didn't chart), Hound Dog, Jailhouse Rock, Don't Be Cruel, Can't Help Falling In Love\n\nReleased 6 weeks after The King's death, this one fits the bill of double live albums with inflated sales totals. The concert was also broadcast on CBS. The album hit #5 on the album charts and #1 on the country albums chart. Elvis had 22 Top 5 albums . . . the last coming in 2003. I'm guessing most people here aren't that into Presley, but he still falls in the rock category.\n\n#242 - HEART - Little Queen (1977) (3.206 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: Barracuda (#11), Little Queen (#62), Kick It Out (#79), Stairway To Heaven (2004 release)\n\nThe third best-selling Heart album behind 1985's self-titled album (5.8 million) and 1987's Bad Animals (3.8 million). Little Queen ranked 85th in Tim's countdown (with Dreamboat Annie coming in at #69). The Wilson sisters have been touring on their own and with their own versions of Heart the past view years, but the reunited band hits the road this summer for the first time in 8 years.\n\n#240T - TOM PETTY & THE HEARTBREAKERS - Damn The Torpedoes (1979) (3.215 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: Don't Do Me Like That (#10), Refugee (#15), Here Comes My Girl (#59), Even The Losers, Shadow Of A Doubt (A Complex Kid)\n\nDTT is the 4th best-selling TP album after his Greatest Hits, Full Moon Fever, and Wildflowers. DTT ranked 32nd on Tim's countdown (Hard Promises was #64 and the first album was at #88). For someone that was around for decades and always a popular touring act, I'm surprised TP wasn't a bigger seller. The only time I saw him was in 1980 and only got more into him in recent years.\n\n#240T - GENESIS - Foxtrot (1972) (3.215 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: Watcher Of The Skies (didn't chart)\n\nThe 4th album released from Genesis, this one featuring Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks (before he switched to playing QB), Steve Hackett, Phil Collins, and Mike Rutherford. Fair warning: the sales totals for Genesis albums are crazy high. Early Genesis isn't exactly my thing, so anyone that prefers their earlier, progressive sound as opposed to their more mainstream sound with Phil Collins, please chime in.\n\n#244T - BILLY SQUIER - Don't Say No (1981) (3.2 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: The Stroke (#17), In The Dark (#35), My Kinda Lover (#45), Lonely Is The Night (#28 AOR Chart)\n\nDon't Say No was one of Squier's two Top 5 albums and featured half of his four Top 40 hits. He timed the MTV era and big hair rock scene just right. He had 3-4 years where he was a regular on FM radio.\n\nWhen we were discussing Paradise Theater yesterday amid the arena rock craze that year, I was going to mention a few others that were monsters at the time. This was another one, but didn’t want to spotlight.\n\nHe was huge in '82. Saw him at a sold out Cotton Bowl in Dec '82 with the Who and Steel Breeze. His entire set he had a series of Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders rotating through with him on stage. Definitely memorable.\n\nNow it’s starting to make sense where he got his outfit inspiration for the “Rock Me Tonite” video.\n\nYea, he may not \"roll' that way, but he definitely \"rocked' that way...\n\nGoing back to the concert you attended that year, that was the Who’s farewell tour IIRC. We’re still waiting…\n\nAnd Steel Breeze must have played “You Don’t Want Me Anymore” on a loop during their performance.\n\n#244T - BILLY SQUIER - Don't Say No (1981) (3.2 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: The Stroke (#17), In The Dark (#35), My Kinda Lover (#45), Lonely Is The Night (#28 AOR Chart)\n\nDon't Say No was one of Squier's two Top 5 albums and featured half of his four Top 40 hits.

We’re still waiting…\n\nAnd Steel Breeze must have played “You Don’t Want Me Anymore” on a loop during their performance.\n\nI just remember the high angle camera shots from the below-stage level camera pool of the talent on stage with Billy were off the charts.\n\n#239 - NEIL YOUNG WITH CRAZY HORSE - Rust Never Sleeps (1979) (3.22 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black (#79), My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue), Powderfinger\n\nThis album is one that I suspect has some accounting errors. Of the sources I used, one of them barely had this album breaking a million in album sales . . . but another had it over 3 million (which seems to have been more current and appears to add in more digital and catalog sales). If I didn't explain earlier, I predominantly used two main databases to compile the list . . . and I went with the highest total. I like the two main songs that book end the album. The tracks in the middle I think are only ok.\n\n#238 - NEIL YOUNG WITH CRAZY HORSE - Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere (1969) (3.265 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: Cinnamon Girl, Down By The River, Title Track\n\nOur second double shot of the same artist. This was #42 on Tim's countdown and a regular selection in the Rolling Stone Top 500 Albums. I've always enjoyed CSNY more than Neil on his own (but have always liked Rockin' In The Free World). Probably more than other artists, I like his popular songs but his deeper tracks never grew on me.\n\n#236T - PAUL SIMON - Still Crazy After All These Years (1975) (3.27 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: 50 Ways To Leave Your Lover (#1), My Little Town (with Art Garfunkel (#9), Gone At Last (#23), Title Track (#40), Slip Slidin' Away (Demo)\n\nIMO, Simon is one of the greatest American song writers and penned some of the best songs of his era / genre. I saw him perform on his Graceland and Rhythm Of The Saints tours and both shows were fantastic. Yes, I'm old and like old people music. What's your point?\n\n#236T - ELTON JOHN - Madman Across The Water (1971) (3.27 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: Levon (#24), Tiny Dance (#41), Indian Sunset, Holiday Inn\n\nThe first of many Elton albums. He was a money-making machine in the 70's. He had 24 Top 40 hits in the decade to go along with 6 #1 albums IN A ROW across THREE YEARS (with a #1 greatest hits album thrown in for good measure). Tim had this one at #84. The 50th anniversary deluxe edition extended the single disc album to 3 CDs.\n\n#235 - ELTON JOHN - Honky Chateau (1972) (3.28 million albums)\n\nNotable songs: Rocket Man (#6), Honky Cat (#8), Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters\n\nAnd ANOTHER back-to-back album from the same artist. IMO, the stronger of the two Elton albums listed here. My older siblings loved Elton, and I remember hearing him in our house all the time. My brother attended the show at MSG in 1974 when John Lennon played a few songs (his last live performance).\n\nFair warning: the sales totals for Genesis albums are crazy high. Early Genesis isn't exactly my thing, so anyone that prefers their earlier, progressive sound as opposed to their more mainstream sound with Phil Collins, please chime in.\n\nThis makes zero sense to me. I believe you are reporting the correct numbers as your source has them, but there's no way Foxtrot sold as many units as something like Torpedoes. Early Genesis had NO radio presence.\n\nWouldn't be surprised if the Gabriel era of Genesis never sold a ton of albums all at once, but have had a steady slow burn where the sales never really ground to a halt (Pink Floyd is this way, but with much larger sales figures). This isn't a ton of information, but (if accurate) it looks like even today, Foxtrot is still at Gold album status in the UK -- which means 100,000 units. I see also that this album has been re-released a few times since 1972, kind of keeping it \"current\" in a way.\n\nNot sure this exists, but it would be cool if there was a time component in the sales figures. Like where you could see year-end cumulative figures, year by year, for albums like these. Early Genesis, to me, is yet another band who have probably benefited from an Internet-era boost -- I could see a 1.0 - 1.5 million of the Foxtrot album sales (maybe more) being digital downloads over the last 15 years or so. Early Genesis have always kind of gotten a lot of \"cool\" points online by my reckoning. Never heard jack about 1970s Genesis growing up in the era of new wave, hair metal, and seminal rap."
