The Troublemaker (1976) was actually recorded for Atlantic Records in 1973 but not released until his move to Columbia and the success of Red Headed Stranger in 1975. Produced by Arif Mardin, the stirring collection of hymns and spirituals is divided between ballads and more up-tempo material, all in a country-gospel style. Willie's free-wheeling arrangements and jazz-like fluidity elevate beloved standards like \"Uncloudy Day,\" \"Whispering Hope,\" \"Will The Circle Be Unbroken,\" \"In the Garden,\" \"Sweet Bye & Bye\" and \"Precious Memories\" to compelling new heights. Format : Vinyl Record 1 Lp",
