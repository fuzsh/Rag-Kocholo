        "text": "The Vandoliers led by front man Joshua Fleming released there 3rd album today. The album simply called The Vandoliers. Tonight the band brought their breed of music back to where it all began. Dallas, Tx. 7 years ago this band was just a gleem in Fleming’s eye. Fleming wanted a group and wanted to make music that represented Texas Culture. This cow-punk, Amerikinda culture was on full display to a packed house of fans. These fans of the Vandoliers, like myself believe in the bands credo, VFFV. “Vandoliers Forever Forever Vandoliers.” There were so many different races, age groups, genders, and styles represented in the audience. Joshua Fleming made it clear more than once, that all were welcome and they as the band were grateful for each and every one.\n\nThe night began with a set by Mallory Eagle. This up and coming musician from Oklahoma had a great personality and is a great songwriter. She had some songs in her set that jerked tears out of my eyes and others that had me laughing so hard it hurt.\n\nAfter Mallory’s set, RC & the Ambers picked up the tempo a bit. This four piece band features acoustic and electric guitars, a stand up bass and a pretty girl who could sing and played sort of a washtub strapped across her chest.\n\nMidway through RC’s set the ,Vandoliers own, Corey Graves stepped in with the Ambers and backed up several of their songs on his horn. During The Vandoliers set, Fleming called Graves,”His Secret Weapon.”\n\nTonight, The Vandoliers played a song that was written by Corey Graves. This showed me more about what this multi-talented artist could do.Of course, Corey was also the first to take his shirt off. Something that has become something of a trademark as the band has grown up over the last year or so the shirts off has become,\n\nThe Vandoliers opened the show with Every Saturday Night. They played the new album and some of our timeless favorites. The Energy in the room could be felt by all. The band members movement across the stage and the way they interact with each other as well as the crowd. The music they play is fun and it makes me smile to see a band who still has fun playing their music. Each member genuinely loves what he is doing.\n\nAfter approximately an hour and a half the band ended their performance. As the cheers and chants of the crowd grew louder, the Vandoliers made their way back up to the stage. This time it was Fleming himself who wasn’t wearing his top. The crowd when crazy. This led to more rowdies and cheering as the excitement of the band grew more intense.\n\nThe show ended with a bang and a surprise ending as singer/songwriter Joshua Ray Walker joined the group on stage and soon both opening acts came up onto the stage to sing 500 miles with Fleming.\n\nIf you get a chance to see these guys, do yourself a favor and do it. Support them by buying there merchandise and music, Buy albums and Stream songs.\n\nPancho."
