Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter has a new front cover.\n\nThe Asylum Albums 1976-1980 is released on 21 June 2024, via Rhino.\n\nTracklisting\n\nThe Asylum Albums 1976-1980 Joni Mitchell /\n\nCD 1: HEJIRA\n\nCOYOTE [5:00]\n\nAMELIA [6:00]\n\nFURRY SINGS THE BLUES [5:03]\n\nA STRANGE BOY [4:15]\n\nHEJIRA [6:35]\n\nSONG FOR SHARON [8:30]\n\nBLACK CROW [4:20]\n\nBLUE MOTEL ROOM [5:03]\n\nREFUGE OF THE ROAD [6:37]\n\nCD 2: DON JUAN’S RECKLESS DAUGHTER\n\nOVERTURE – COTTON AVENUE [6:35]\n\nTALK TO ME [3:40]\n\nJERICHO [3:25]\n\nPAPRIKA PLAINS [16:19]\n\nOTIS AND MARLENA [4:05]\n\nTHE TENTH WORLD [6:45]\n\nDREAMLAND [4:37]\n\nDON JUAN’S RECKLESS DAUGHTER [6:40]\n\nOFF NIGHT BACKSTREET [3:22]\n\nTHE SILKY VEILS OF ARDOR [4:02]\n\nCD 3: MINGUS\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY 1975 (Rap) [0:57]\n\nGOD MUST BE A BOOGIE MAN [4:33]\n\nFUNERAL (Rap) [1:07]\n\nA CHAIR IN THE SKY [6:40]\n\nTHE WOLF THAT LIVES IN LINDSEY [6:33]\n\nI’S A MUGGIN (Rap) [0:07]\n\nSWEET SUCKER DANCE [8:06]\n\nCOIN IN THE POCKET (Rap) [0:11]\n\nTHE DRY CLEANER FROM DES MOINES [3:22]\n\nLUCKY (Rap) [0:03]\n\nGOODBYE PORK PIE HAT [5:41]\n\nCD 4: SHADOWS AND LIGHT\n\nINTRODUCTION [1:51]\n\nIN FRANCE THEY KISS ON MAIN STREET [4:14]\n\nEDITH AND THE KINGPIN [4:10]\n\nCOYOTE [4:58]\n\nGOODBYE PORK PIE HAT [6:02]\n\nTHE DRY CLEANER FROM DES MOINES [4:37]\n\nAMELIA [6:40]\n\nPAT’S SOLO [3:09]\n\nHEJIRA [7:42]\n\nCD 5: SHADOWS AND LIGHT\n\nBLACK CROW [3:52]\n\nDON’S SOLO [4:04]\n\nDREAMLAND [4:40]\n\nFREE MAN IN PARIS [3:23]\n\nBAND INTRODUCTION [0:52]\n\nFURRY SINGS THE BLUES [5:14]\n\nWHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE [2:53]\n\nSHADOWS AND LIGHT [5:23]\n\nGOD MUST BE A BOOGIE MAN [5:02]\n\nWOODSTOCK [5:08]\n\nLP 1: HEJIRA\n\nSide One\n\nCOYOTE [5:00]\n\nAMELIA [6:00]\n\nFURRY SINGS THE BLUES [5:03]\n\nA STRANGE BOY [4:15]\n\nHEJIRA [6:35]\n\nSide Two\n\nSONG FOR SHARON [8:30]\n\nBLACK CROW [4:20]\n\nBLUE MOTEL ROOM [5:03]\n\nREFUGE OF THE ROAD [6:37]\n\nLP 2: DON JUAN’S RECKLESS DAUGHTER\n\nSide One\n\nOVERTURE – COTTON AVENUE [6:35]\n\nTALK TO ME [3:40]\n\nJERICHO [3:25]\n\nSide Two\n\nPAPRIKA PLAINS [16:19]\n\nLP 3: DON JUAN’S RECKLESS DAUGHTER\n\nSide Three\n\nOTIS AND MARLENA [4:05]\n\nTHE TENTH WORLD [6:45]\n\nDREAMLAND [4:37]\n\nSide Four\n\nDON JUAN’S RECKLESS DAUGHTER [6:40]\n\nOFF NIGHT BACKSTREET [3:22]\n\nTHE SILKY VEILS OF ARDOR [4:02]\n\nLP 4: MINGUS\n\nSide One\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY 1975 (Rap) [0:57]\n\nGOD MUST BE A BOOGIE MAN [4:33]\n\nFUNERAL (Rap) [1:07]\n\nA CHAIR IN THE SKY [6:40]\n\nTHE WOLF THAT LIVES IN LINDSEY [6:33]\n\nSide Two\n\nI’S A MUGGIN (Rap) [0:07]\n\nSWEET SUCKER DANCE [8:06]\n\nCOIN IN THE POCKET (Rap) [0:11]\n\nTHE DRY CLEANER FROM DES MOINES [3:22]\n\nLUCKY (Rap) [0:03]\n\nGOODBYE PORK PIE HAT [5:41]\n\nLP 5: SHADOWS AND LIGHT\n\nSide One\n\nINTRODUCTION [1:51]\n\nIN FRANCE THEY KISS ON MAIN STREET [4:14]\n\nEDITH AND THE KINGPIN [4:10]\n\nCOYOTE [4:58]\n\nGOODBYE PORK PIE HAT [6:02]\n\nSide Two\n\nTHE DRY CLEANER FROM DES MOINES [4:37]\n\nAMELIA [6:40]\n\nPAT’S SOLO [3:09]\n\nHEJIRA [7:42]\n\nLP 6: SHADOWS AND LIGHT\n\nSide Three\n\nBLACK CROW [3:52]\n\nDON’S SOLO [4:04]\n\nDREAMLAND [4:40]\n\nFREE MAN IN PARIS [3:23]\n\nBAND INTRODUCTION [0:52]\n\nFURRY SINGS THE BLUES [5:14]\n\nSide Four\n\nWHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE [2:53]\n\nSHADOWS AND LIGHT [5:23]\n\nGOD MUST BE A BOOGIE MAN [5:02]\n\nWOODSTOCK [5:08]\n\nSign Up For the SDE newsletter\n\nSuperDeluxeEdition.com helps fans around the world discover physical music and discuss releases.
