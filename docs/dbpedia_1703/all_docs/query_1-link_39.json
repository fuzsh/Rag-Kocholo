        "text": "About Professional Troublemaker\n\nWe’re all afraid of asking for what we want because we’re afraid of hearing “no.” We’re afraid of being different, of being too much or not enough. We’re afraid of leaving behind the known for the unknown.\n\nBut in order to do the things that will truly, meaningfully change our lives, we have to become professional troublemakers: people who are committed to not letting fear talk them out of the things they need to do or say.\n\nFrom the New York Times bestselling author of I’m Judging You, this powerful book that talks about how to tackle fear–that everlasting hater–and live boldly and audaciously in spite of all the reasons we have to cower.\n\nLuvvie Ajayi Jones is known for her trademark wit, warm voice, and integrity. But even she’s been challenged by the enemy of progress known as fear. She was once afraid to call herself a writer because she was afraid of the title. She nearly skipped out on doing a TED talk that changed her life because of imposter syndrome. Also, she’s deathly afraid of bugs. And, as she shares in Professional Troublemaker, she’s not alone.\n\nWith humor and honesty, and guided by the influence of her inspiring and professional troublemaking grandmother, Funmilayo Faloyin, Luvvie walks us through what we must get right within ourselves before we can do the things that scare us; how to use our voice for the greater good; and how to put movement to the voice we’ve been silencing–because truth-telling is a muscle.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nLuvvie Ajayi Jones is a four-time New York Times bestselling author, speaker and entrepreneur who thrives at the intersection of culture, business, and leadership.\n\nHer critically acclaimed books Rising Troublemaker: A Fear-Fighter Manual for Teens (2022), Professional Troublemaker: The Fear-Fighter Manual (2021) and I’m Judging You: The Do-Better Manual (2016) were instant bestsellers and established her as a literary force with a powerful pen. Her newest and first children’s book, Little Troublemaker Makes a Mess released on May 2, 2023, and debuted at #5 on the New York Times bestsellers list.\n\nHer renowned TED talk “Get Comfortable with Being Uncomfortable” has over 8.5 million views, has been transcribed into 23 languages, and has placed her in the Top 1% of TED Talks of all time. Luvvie has taken the stage at some of the world’s most innovative and disruptive brands, such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Spotify, Nike, Bank of America, Salesforce, Deloitte, and Clif Bar. She’s been a featured speaker at noted conferences such as: Cannes Lions, SXSW, Leadercast, 3% Conference, and MAKERS Conference.\n\nWith a passion and proven track record of creating and launching successful books, Luvvie founded The Book Academy (TBA), as a platform to help others do the same. TBA is a comprehensive course and coaching suite designed to guide students from the initial idea to the final reality of a published book.\n\nA noted writer, she has contributed to several anthologies (How We Heal, You Are Your Best Thing, Hungry Hearts, Black Girls Rock) and has written for the New York Times, ELLE and Essence. In addition, her work has been featured in outlets such as NPR, Forbes, Inc, Fortune, Fast Company, Chicago Tribune and more. An 19-year blogging veteran, Luvvie writes on AwesomelyLuvvie.com, covering all things culture with a critical yet humorous lens.\n\nBorn in Nigeria, bred in Chicago and comfortable everywhere, Luvvie enjoys laying around in her plush robe, and eating a warm bowl of jollof rice in her free time. Her love language is shoes."
