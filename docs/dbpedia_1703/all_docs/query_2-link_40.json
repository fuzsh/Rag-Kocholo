        "text": "Lauryn Hill's \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\" has been named the best album ever made, according to a new list released by Apple Music. And the rest of the top 10 shows a strong push toward hip-hop and R&B artists, and away from the classic rock titans that have long dominated similar canonical roundups.\n\nApple Music called Hill's 1998 LP a \"stunningly raw, profound look into the spiritual landscape not just of one of the era's biggest stars, but of the era itself,\" praising Hill for being a \"once-in-a-generation talent whose inspiration and innovation can be heard through the decades.\"\n\nHill's album, her solo debut after reaching international success with The Fugees, won five Grammy Awards upon its initial release, setting a new record for the most Grammys won by a female artist in a single ceremony.\n\nApple Music's new list was determined with the participation of artists, songwriters, producers, industry professionals and Apple's own editorial staff members. Apple Music emphasized that it was not meant to be taken as a reflection of the platform's most-streamed offerings, but rather \"a love letter to the records that have shaped the world music lovers live and listen in.\"\n\nTop 100 album lists have long been a staple of music industry media, popularized by such outlets as Rolling Stone, whose own lists throughout the decades have cemented the \"all-timer\" reputations of such Baby Boomer stalwarts as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and The Beach Boys.\n\nIn contrast, Apple Music's new list is more strongly centered around female artists, and artists of color. Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Prince, Kendrick Lamar and Frank Ocean are all ranked high up among Hill's runners-up, though The Beatles' \"Abbey Road\" and Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" ensured rock its position in the overall top 10:\n\nLauryn Hill, \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\" (1998)\n\nMichael Jackson, \"Thriller\" (1982)\n\nThe Beatles, \"Abbey Road\" (1969)\n\nPrince and the Revolution, \"Purple Rain\" (1984)\n\nFrank Ocean, \"Blonde\" (2016)\n\nStevie Wonder, \"Songs in the Key of Life\" (1976)\n\nKendrick Lamar, \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" (2012)\n\nAmy Winehouse, \"Back to Black\" (2006)\n\nNirvana, \"Nevermind\" (1991)\n\nBeyoncé, \"Lemonade\" (2016)\n\nBeyoncé, Prince, Stevie Wonder, The Beatles and Radiohead are the only acts with more than one album represented in the overall list of 100.\n\nApple Music's top 10 features four albums from the 21st century, whereas even the most recent edition of Rolling Stone's top albums list (which positioned Hill's album in 10th place) remained a predominately pre-Y2K zone. The 1990s were the most-represented decade overall, with 23 albums included. The oldest album on the list: Miles Davis's 1959 \"Kind of Blue.\"\n\nAs for Bob Dylan, Beach Boys and Rolling Stones, their included albums ranked 14th (\"Highway 61 Revisited\"), 20th (\"Pet Sounds\") and 53rd (\"Exile on Main Street\").\n\nThe most-represented genre among the top 100, according to Apple Music's own tags, is hip-hop; more than one-fifth of the list is made up of albums within that genre, compared to the 18% of albums tagged as rock, and the 16% filed under pop.\n\nThose following Lamar's beef with rapper Drake will note that the latter, while on the overall list of 100 albums, ranks much further down than his sparring partner — Drake's 2011 album \"Take Care\" shows up in 47th place.\n\nSwifties can rest easy that Taylor Swift made the list, landing in 18th place with \"1989 (Taylor's Version).\""
