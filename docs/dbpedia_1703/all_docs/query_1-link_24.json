        "text": "OLLY MURS RETURNS WITH HIS NEW SINGLE ‘TROUBLEMAKER’ FEATURING FLO RIDA ON NOVEMBER 18\n\nTHE SONG IS TAKEN FROM HIS FORTHCOMING THIRD STUDIO ALBUM ‘RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT TIME’, DUE FOR RELEASE ON NOVEMBER 26.\n\nOlly Murs returns with an amazing new single ‘Troublemaker’ featuring Flo Rida, released on November 18 through Epic/Syco. The song is the first track to be taken from his third studio album ‘Right Place, Right Time’, which will be released a week later on November 26.\n\n‘Troublemaker’ is an incredibly catchy, pure pop anthem, which Olly co-wrote with Claude Kelly and Steve Robson\n\nOlly said: “I can’t wait for my third album to be released, its been a crazy year! I’m very excited with the new direction I’m going in, “Troublemaker” is so different to what I’ve done before. This album is a definite step up for me and I can’t wait to tour it in 2013”.\n\nOlly’s last album ‘In Case You Didn’t Know’ went straight to number one when it was released last year, and has gone on to sell over 850,000 making it almost triple platinum in the UK! 2012 saw Olly play a sold out headline arena tour, including 2 nights at London’s O2 Arena. Olly will be touring the UK’s arenas again in early 2013, with a European tour following in April.\n\nOlly is the only solo artist to come from the X Factor who sold more records with his second album than his debut. His incredible success has seen him touring the US with One Direction and causing a stir with his debut US single ‘Heart Skips A Beat’. His debut US album release is coming on December 3.\n\nFurther details on the new album will be announced soon.\n\nOlly is co-hosting The Xtra Factor this year on ITV2, and is releasing his first book ‘Happy Days’ on October 11.\n\n2013 UK Tour dates:\n\n26 Feb Newcastle Metro Arena\n\n27 Feb Nottingham Capital FM Arena\n\n1 March Sheffield Motorpoint Arena\n\n2 March Sheffield Motorpoint Arena\n\n3 March Nottingham Capital FM Arena\n\n5 March Brighton Centre\n\n6 March Brighton Centre\n\n8 March Bournemouth International Centre\n\n10 March London Wembley Arena\n\n12 March Birmingham LG Arena\n\n13 March Liverpool Echo Arena\n\n15 March Glasgow SECC\n\n16 March Glasgow SECC\n\n18 March Aberdeen ECC\n\n20 March Birmingham NIA\n\n21 March Manchester Arena\n\n23 March Newcastle Arena\n\n25 March Cardiff Motorpoint Arena\n\n26 March Cardiff Motorpoint Arena\n\n27 March Liverpool Echo Arena\n\n29 March The O2 Arena, London\n\nwww.ollymurs.com\n\nwww.facebook.com/ollymurs\n\nwww.twitter.com/ollyofficial\n\nPre-order Here:\n\nAmazon Standard Album pre-order\n\nAmazon Deluxe Album pre-order"
