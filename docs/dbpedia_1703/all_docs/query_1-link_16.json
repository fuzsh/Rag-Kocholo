        "text": "Trey Lewis is set to release his new album Troublemaker on March 1, marking his debut project with River House Artists.\n\nOn New Year’s Day (Jan. 1), Lewis surprised fans by dropping “Pretty Hungover,” a song from the new record. Produced by Lewis and Jacob Rice, Troublemaker features 14 tracks. With a raw and honest delivery, the singer-songwriter paints a vivid picture of love, life and all the ups and downs that come with it.\n\n“I’ve been a troublemaker my whole life. This is a batch of songs that speaks to me and I hope there is something for everyone to relate to here,” says Lewis. “We all start off in different places in life and struggle is real, but so is victory and love. I am grateful for our team and their efforts to make this the best album it can be.”\n\nThe surprise release of the song “Pretty Hungover” and its video follows the previous release of “Mine Never Could,” which was released in December. Lewis also recently scored his first major-label single as a songwriter with Cole Swindell’s “Three Feet Tall,” a song that tells the personal experience of how Lewis’ parents’ divorce affected him as a young boy.\n\nHe became a household name in 2020 with his viral hit, “Dicked Down in Dallas,” which hit No. 1 on iTunes and has garnered more than 360 million streams to date. The career-launching hit was followed by “Single Again,” which also reached the top of the iTunes chart."
