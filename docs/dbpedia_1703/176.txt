It debuted the week of July 26, 2008, at No. 39 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks charts and peaked at No. 2.

This song was originally planned to be the first single for the album,[2][3] but "Pork and Beans" was chosen instead.

Rivers Cuomo has stated the song, along with others from The Red Album, were heavily influenced by rapper Eminem and his "fun way of using rhymes."[citation needed]
