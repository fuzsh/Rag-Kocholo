Sun 25/2/68 The Morecambe & Wise Show When I Was Young/Good Times\n\nPost by tom rogers on\n\nSaw the original line-up twice in 1983-84(?) in the US on the second reunion attempt, touring to support their album \"The Ark.\" The second time I saw them was at an outdoor venue, with some supporting musicians, and they were great. Had the place jumping. But, the first show I saw, about thre months or so earlier, was just sublime. A small club (100 people tops), and just the original five guys. We were practically on-stage with them. Burdon was in great shape and all over the place. The band was tight and having a ball. They played for almost three hours and left the stage completely drenched. In my top five shows/events of all time."
