If you like Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser which this story very much reminded of or other S&S with a dash of Aladdin (the story not the movies), give this a try I think you'll enjoy it.\n\nSeptember 8, 2021\n\nThis was the perfect read for a short flight. Nods towards Fafhrd and Gray Mouser are obvious, but intended. The author adds a bit of Middle-eastern spice to the mix and flavors the tale well with eloquent descriptions and good, fast pacing.\n\nI discovered this through Robert Zoltan’s podcast, Literary Wonder & Adventure. I am an infrequent listener of podcasts, but LW&A never disappoints. Based upon the strength of it, I decided to give this free read a go (I think I got it free through the podcast?).\n\nI’m glad I did! It lay in the electronic depths of my Kindle too long. I should have conjured it up sooner and will now seek out more adventures of Dareon and Blue.\n\nRecommended to fans of Sword & Sorcery."
