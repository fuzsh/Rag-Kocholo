        "text": "Description\n\nJazz Inspired Lamp Mini-Blue aesthetics are from jazz music, particularly utilizing, reading and translating the musical elements to furniture forms. This line of custom lamps has lots of variations like https://www.cosmobarbaro.com/product/jazz-inspired-twisted-variation/ and https://www.cosmobarbaro.com/product/jazz-inspired-mini-blue/ and https://www.cosmobarbaro.com/product/jazz-inspired-original-lamp-2/. This Jazz Inspired line of lamps sell across the nation and are very durable and energy efficient. Jazz Inspired Mini-Blue Lamp features a dimmer, LED bulbs, silk cord, a very high-end cluster head that holds the bulbs and a glass shade in most cases. Several of my lamps have been in galleries across the nation. One of the best representations from a gallery I have ever had was The Nan Miller Gallery in Rochester, NY. T he Rochester Democrat and Chronicle published an article that features some of my work, which can be read here. https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/2016/03/18/nan-miller-goes-into-woods-wood-inspired-show/81907424/.\n\nThese lamps are gracefully, playful and fun. They convey movement when standing still. You simply rotate to create several different looks. A timeless aesthetic and something that will last 100 years or more. Each lamp is unique and requires specific building processes. This Lamp has a hand texture along the curved surfaces. Two layers of the Old-Fashioned Milk Paint Companies colors on top of one another. Sanding back through the top layer of milk paint to create a unique one of kind color and texture. The combination of the shapes textures colors and transitions create a gestural flowing form that can light up any room. A solid brass cluster head and allows the LED bulbs to articulate while holding the glass shade. A 3 stage in line dimmer is wired into the silk cord allowing the Custom Jazz Inspired Mini Blue Lamp to be dimmable."
