        "text": "In these troubled times, when the phone-hacking scandal has heaped ignominy on the police, it is worth pointing out that British cinema has led the way in suggesting the boys in blue are less than trustworthy. In fact, so complete was the turnaround in the two decades between The Blue Lamp, in 1950, and The Offence, from 1972, it almost constitutes a social history in its own right.\n\nMade partly to alleviate a recruitment crisis, and partly to acknowledge a wave of teen delinquency just after the war, The Blue Lamp was the first British film made with the full co-operation of the Metropolitan police. The Met lent the makers their stations, their patrol cars and even their own officers to play small roles. The plot – a neurotic young spiv, played by Dirk Bogarde, shoots a veteran PC and, in order to save the local community, the police and underworld unite to catch him – would exemplify the quietly heroic nature of the policeman's lot.\n\nThe celebrated death of Jack Warner's PC George Dixon may have resulted in the long-running TV series Dixon of Dock Green, but it happens early on in the film; afterwards, The Blue Lamp's narrative focus shifts to CID Inspector Bernard Lee, and thereby set the template for most 1950s British crime films. You know the kind of thing: a Wolseley 6/80 with a clanging bell containing a fatherly senior police officer. Prestige films such as The Blue Lamp were augmented by the long-running Scotland Yard series, which also highlighted the function of the policeman as paternalist authority figure.\n\nBut by the end of the 1950s, with society fragmenting, cinema would rapidly lose faith in the essential incorruptibility of British institutions. The mood was assisted by the liberalisation of censorship after John Trevelyan became the British Board of Film Censors secretary in 1958. The cracks began to show in two Basil Dearden problem dramas, in which the police are seen as powerless in the face of prejudice: in 1959's Sapphire, they uncover a racist murderer; in the gay blackmail drama Victim, from 1961, they act as the voice of reason. Nearly simultaneously, a pair of films starring Stanley Baker marked a definitive shift in British cinema's treatment of the police. In Joseph Losey's 1959 film Blind Date, Baker's DI Morgan is driven by an aggressive sense of class consciousness as he investigates the death of a socialite. A year later, in Val Guest's Manchester-set Hell Is a City, Baker's Inspector Martineau is overworked, emotional and deeply troubled – a far cry from the trilby-hatted automaton of the second-feature CID man.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, the benign authority figure was fast vanishing from British cinema, along with the B-film crime drama; Warner's last leading role was in 1962 in Jigsaw, as an elderly detective openly appalled at the nascent permissive society. The 1964 Challenor case, in which a Met detective sergeant went on trial for perverting the course of justice, further eroded once-automatic respect for the police. In 1968, The Strange Affair had Michael York's fresh-faced rookie coming under the influence of Jeremy Kemp's DS Pierce, a Challenor-inspired figure teetering on the verge of total breakdown. Here, the image of short-back-and-sides policemen in their black Wolseleys, the visual embodiment of benevolent authority from countless postwar crime dramas, disquietingly masks a corrupt and amoral world."
