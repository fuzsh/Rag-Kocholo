Trailer (Gary McFarland) - 2:33\n\nNote: (1) The film Eye of the Devil was originally titled 13 when Gary McFarland wrote and recorded this score. Verve Records had intended on issuing a soundtrack album in early 1967 (scheduled as V/V6-8674), and although the album was designed and advertised, production problems which delayed the release of the film stalled the release of the soundtrack until Film Score Monthly finally issued its first-ever release four full decades later, shortly after Deborah Kerr, the last of the film's surviving stars, had passed away. The main theme (titled as such above and below) has also been recorded under other titles, including \"13\", \"Theme from 13\", \"13 (Death March)\", \"Eye of the Devil\" and, most prominently, as \"One I Could Have Loved\". McFarland also recorded a theme he originally called \"Jacques\" (after the son in the film, who will inherit his father's fate - curiously something that was not too dissimilar from what happened between McFarland and his son, Milo) as \"Childhood Dreams\" with Steve Kuhn on THE OCTOBER SUITE, which can be heard as \"Jacques in Bed\" above. Here are the titles as they appear in Creed Taylor's production notes for the Verve release and the order of tunes according to the Verve matrix numbers:\n\n1. (101095) Main Theme (Journey) = b\n\n2. (101096) Main Theme (Harp) = a (Main Theme, without intro)\n\n3. (101097) Main Theme (Kids) = c\n\n4. (101098) Death March (Part 1) = m (first half)\n\n5. (101099) Death March (Part 2) = m (second half)\n\n6. (101100) Death March (Part 3) = n\n\n7. (101101) Death March (Part 4) = o\n\n8. (101102) Voices (Ceremony) = d (Int. Chateau Interior)\n\n9. (101103) Main Theme (End) = p\n\n10. (101104) Voices And Bells In Church = k\n\n11. (101105) Christmas Theme = g (Children on Parapet)\n\n12. (101106) Hypnotizing Odillo Theme = g (Catherine and Odile on\n\nParapet) segue to f (Arrow Into Tree)\n\n13. (101107) Forest Chase = i (last 2:50 only)\n\n14. (101108) Train Ride = q\n\nAdditionally, Creed Taylor's production notes and Michel Ruppli's Verve discography indicate the recording dates as November 7 and 8, 1966, which corresponds to when McFarland was in London recording SOFT SAMBA STRINGS. Additionally, Ruppli indicates the presence of Tubby Hayes (f); unknown (p); Lennie Bush (b); Ronnie Stevenson (d) on the November 7 date. The date used above corresponds to the logs that accompanied the tapes provided to Film Score Monthly by M-G-M in England. (Sources: Creed Taylor, Dan Skea, Lukas Kendall).
