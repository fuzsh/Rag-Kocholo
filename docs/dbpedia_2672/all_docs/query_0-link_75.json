        "text": "AVID Jazz continues with its Four Classic Albums Plus series with a second re-mastered 2CD release from Tubby Hayes, complete with original artwork, liner notes and personnel details.\n\nTubby Hayes & His Orchestra: Modern Jazz Scene; Tubby Hayes Quintet: After Lights Out; The Jazz Couriers featuring Tubby Hayes & Ronnie Scott: The Last Word; Tubby Hayes: Tubby In N.Y. plus two bonus tracks.\n\nFor our long awaited second set from arguably the best and most famous British jazz musician of all time, we present Mr. Tubby Hayes in various musical configurations. Firstly we join the audience at the Festival Hall in London on the night of February 18th 1956 where we can witness the set performed by Tubby and His Orchestra. Next its Tubby with his Quintet for After Lights Out where he is joined by Dickie Hawdon on trumpet, Harry South at the piano, Pete Elderfield on bass and Bill Eyden behind the drums. Hailed as Englands greatest jazz combo, Ronnie Scott and Tubby Hayes formed the Couriers to bring their message to the world that British jazz was alive and kicking! Joined by Terry Shannon on piano, Phil Bates on bass and Phil Seamen on drums we feature them on our second disc with the fine album The Last Word recorded in London in 1959. We conclude our Tubby Tribute with a fine set the great man performed in the big apple, New York City in 1961. As befitted his reputation Tubby is heard alongside some great American jazz musicians including the legendary Clark Terry on trumpet, George Duvivier on bass, Dave Bailey on drums and a recent AVID catalogue alumni, Horace Parlan (AMSC1450) at the piano. As with all AVID releases, we hope you enjoy this classic set and check out our extensive catalogue for more great music across jazz, blues, country and many other musical genres.\n\nCheck out:- Tubby Hayes (AMSC1014); Clark Terry (AMSC1102); Curtis Amy (AMSC1316); John Coltrane (AMSC1379 & 1230); Johnny Dankworth (AMSC1236); Stan Getz (AMSC1369 & 1234); Benny Golson (AMSC1310); Dexter Gordon (AMSC1199); Jimmy Heath (AMSC1375); Horace Parlan (AMSC1450); Ben Webster (AMSC1354); Lester Young (AMSC1366 & 1307); Terry Gibbs (AMSC1095); Clifford Jordan (AMSC1330); Harold Land (AMSC1332); Jack Parnell (AMSC1016); Stan Tracey (AMSC1044); Ben Webster (AMSC1038); Yusef Lateef (AMSC1128); Tenor Sax (AMSC1285).\n\nCD1\n\n1-7: Modern Jazz Scene\n\n1.
