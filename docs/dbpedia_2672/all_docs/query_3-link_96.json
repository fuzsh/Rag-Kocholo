He has created original scores for dozens of award-winning theater projects, films and podcasts.\n\nMost recently Kluger wrote the original score for Cole Escola’s Broadway comedy OH MARY!\n\nOther broadway credits include the world premieres of THE SOUND INSIDE, SIGNIFICANT OTHER, Seawall / A Life, and the revival of MARVIN’S ROOM, in addition to countless Off-Broadway productions. Film credits include THE COURTROOM, A Christmas Carol, Hello Again, Health to the King, among others.. Podcast scores include Audible’s THE MIRANDA OBSESSION, THE GUILTY, OFFENSE, and Ken Urban’s VAPOR TRAIL.\n\nKluger collaborates with some of New York’s finest musicians, including Nathan Koci, Bryan Carter, Clara Kennedy, Sam Sadigursky, Riley Mulherkar, and the International Contemporary Ensemble. An advocate for the importance of live music and musicianship in theater scoring, Kluger has taught music production both privately and at the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale.\n\nKluger is Resident Composer and Music Producer at Renaissance Recording, a newly reopened studio in Hell’s Kitchen run by Grammy award-winning engineers Ian Kagey and Derik Lee.
