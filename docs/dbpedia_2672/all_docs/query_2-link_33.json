Actor Hugh Buckler, who died in an automobile accident just prior to the start of production on Parnell, was supposed to play a featured role in the picture.

According to information in the Howard Dietz Collection at the AMPAS Library, the film cost $1,547,000 and grossed $1,576,000, resulting in a net loss for the studio of $637,000. Life magazine featured the picture as its \"film of the week\" in Jun 1937. The article on the picture mentioned that the many \"character extras\" used for the film received Ten dollars per day for their work. The pressbook for the film noted a commercial tie-in between it and the General Mills Co., makers of the popular \"Bisquick\" baking mix, which featured pictures of prominent M-G-M stars, among them Gable, on their boxes. An unidentified note in the AMPAS library file on the film noted that Jack D. Moore was an uncredited set decorator on the film. The story of Charles Stewart Parnell and Katie O'Shea was also the basis for a BBC mini-series, produced in 1990, that was shown in the United States on PBS television from Dec 1991 to Jan 1992. That production, entitled Parnell and the Englishwoman, starred Trevor Eve as Parnell and Francesca Annis as Katie.\n\nLess\n\nIn 1880, Charles Stewart Parnell returns to his native Ireland after a lengthy visit to the United States.

Just as Parnell and Katie are about to leave for a dinner party at Gladstone's home, however, they are served with papers that name Parnell a corespondent in O'Shea's divorce case against Katie. Gladstone refuses to speak with Parnell when the scandal breaks and most of the members of Parnell's own faction turn against him. Fearing that his personal scandal will ruin Ireland's political situation, all but a few of his closest advisors seek another leader. During a heated argument with his colleagues, Parnell has a heart attack. Though Campbell, his devoted secretary, wants to summon Katie, Parnell insists on going to her. A short time later, as he faces death, he calls his men to him and offers them advice on the future of their country. After they leave, he dies, with Katie by his side.\n\nLess"
