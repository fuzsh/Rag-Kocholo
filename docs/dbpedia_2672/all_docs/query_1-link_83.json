        "text": "You’re not familiar with Anomie Belle? I’d much rather light a candle than curse your darkness. She is one of the most interesting indies out there right now — no allegiance to genres, instruments (acoustic or electronic), or even to her own voice. Her only loyalty appears to be to the songs, and each one is a perfect little snow globe of a world ranging from the ethereal and moody to some of the most challenging experimental (yet melodic) stuff I’ve heard in years.\n\nFor example, “How Can I Be Sure” from Sleeping Patterns has all the moody sexiness you’ll ever need:\n\nSo you’ve got her pegged, right? She’s some kind of contemporary Sade, laying down the tasty seduction groove. But then she offers up what should be the theme song to the Occupy Wall Street movement (though it predates it). Here she demonstrates what a bright and prescient lyricist she is, but doesn’t forget that it’s all about the song. Listen closely — goosebump music.\n\nOkay, now you have a bead on her, right? Luscious voice, sleepy melody, razor-sharp lyrics. Well, while you were zigging she was zagging. Here come the beats along with an extended use of that big voice to create new characters. The video itself is pretty damned amazing, too.\n\n“But James, I don’t like all that electronicky wockawoll these kids today listen to,” you say. “Whatever happened to talented people playing real instruments?” Wow, you just never learn, do you, Chumpfrey?\n\nI haven’t been this excited about a new artist in years. I’m thinking back to my days in Los Angeles, seeing bands like Jane’s Addiction and the Red Hot Chili Peppers in clubs and knowing that someday I’d be telling the tale (which I just did, I guess. Yeah, that’s right — I was there).\n\nIf you’re in the Sacramento area you need to come out for this show and grab yourself an “I saw her back when…” story. There might not be a music industry as we once knew it, but when Anomie Belle manages to find a foothold in the new world order she’s going to break out; and if she doesn’t, we can all be in on the best kept secret in the indie music world.\n\nTickets are only 8 bucks and are available at the door. See you Sunday, October 30 at:\n\nBlue Lamp\n\n1400 Alhambra Boulevard\n\nSacramento, CA 95816-6509\n\n(916) 455-3400"
