Me thinks, there was some dodgy studio politics involved.......either that or there were some tone deaf suits at the studio.\n\nThe rejected Shirley Bassey song was good, but even better was the fantastic song by Eva Almer........which is lightyears better than that screeching JW/AK song.\n\nI have never ever met anyone who remotely likes the JW/AK song.....and if i did, i would probably hammer a nail thru' their skull.\n\nThe film makers may of thought, oh lets have this strange, modern, hip song, but it was wrong for the film, and felt so distant to Arnold's score.\n\nOn a combination CD of Bond songs, this song stands out like a sore thumb, when compared to the other Bond themes.\n\nWhen we all recall a Bond film in our heads, we automatically remember the main song of the film, but i can say i have never even tried to hum the song to QOS.....have you?\n\nUnfortuantely, this was only one of several terrible decisions made by the film makers on QOS :(\n\nps:- i used the word film makers, as i don't know whether it was a studio call, or producers call on the final say for selecting songs on the Bond films.\n\nThe Eva Almer song is attached below:-"
