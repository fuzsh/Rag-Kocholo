        "text": "For the record, I'm a huge Stevie Nicks fan. Her two soundtrack songs from the Bella Donna period are absolutely stunning. \"Blue Lamp\" has such a cool, atmospheric riff, and \"Sleeping Angel\" is among her finest ballads. If they had been included on Bella Donna, they would have taken an already great album into a full-fledged classic.\n\nI'd never heard them until I bought the recent deluxe edition of Bella Donna. You're right, they would have been worthy additions to the album. As it is, they're by far the best tracks on the bonus discs of BD.\n\nI bought the same disc yesterday, and having those songs on vinyl is a gift!\n\nWelcome to the forum where Stevie can't write, Stevie can't get along, Christine can do no wrong and Christine was the driving force behind Fleetwood Mac continuing for the 20 years until the reunion tour a couple of years ago.\n\nOne only has to listen to the actual songs to defuse this, taking absolutely nothing away from Christine and Lindsey.\n\nI don't think anyone says Stevie couldn't write back in the day. Hard to make that argument. But there's little evidence that she still can simply because she's done very little of it in the past decade plus.\n\n\"Blue Lamp\" is indeed quite superb, and Bella Donna and The Wild Heart are arguably the finest solo albums made by any member of Fleetwood Mac. Indeed, if you'd asked me in 1983 who was the greatest songwriter in the Mac's history, and allowed me to include solo work in my evaluation, I would have said Nicks without hesitation. But when she lost her songwriting muse, she lost it pretty conclusively, as Rock A Little (and most of what followed) proved.\n\nRock A Little, which I haven't heard in its entirety, seems like an 80s nightmare. Just an impression.\n\nMaybe you need to give Rock a Little another chance. Yeah, the 80s production can be overblown, but there are a handful of her best songs on that album. I Sing For the Things, Imperial Hotel, Some Become Strangers, and my number one favorite Nicks song, No Spoken Word.\n\nI agree. Rock A Little is pretty good. The two singles I Can't Wait and Talk To Me are great too.\n\nI have always liked Other Side Of The Mirror too. Her next one was pretty awful in my opinion but she certainly made up for it with her \"comeback\" Trouble In ShangriLa\" which I still think is one of her strongest albums.\n\nThe two tracks are on the RSD exclusive Rarities 1981 t0 1983. To me they sound like they did a digital copy from the respective soundtrack albums. However still sound very good though not as nice as the other 4 tracks on this EP. Great pressing quality.\n\nI quite liked In YourDreams, though some of the songs go on a bit.\n\nI have not heard OSOTM, but \"Rooms On Fire\" is one of her best-ever singles.\n\nThe extended version of Rooms On Fire is great. I listen to it a lot.\n\nShe did that record with Rupert Hine...he was a great producer for that project. The music was very atmospheric, very much like his more ambient albums.\n\nI think that album is as good as her first two. Played it a bunch when it first came out.\n\nMark\n\nYes, I agree. Some tend to ramble on a bit but I think Stevie and Dave Stewart are a good match on that album. It took me a few listens to get into it, it seemed bland at first, but now I enjoy it quite a bit.\n\nI'd love it if Rhino put out a deluxe edition of Rock A Little. I've been enjoying the deluxe editions of Bella Donna and The Wild Heart tremendously. Stevie Nicks is awesome!"
