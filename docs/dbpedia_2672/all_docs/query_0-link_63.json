        "text": "NYSAF was founded in 1985 by Mark Linn-Baker, Max Mayer, and Leslie Urdang in order to provide artists with a rigorous and nurturing environment to support artistic process, promote collaboration between artistic peers, foster dialogue between artists and audiences, and to facilitate the sharing of knowledge from one artistic generation to the next. Johanna Pfaelzer was named NYSAF's first Artistic Director in 2007, having worked with the company as Managing Producer since 1998, and now serves as a Producing Director along with the three founders. In 2019, Christopher Burney began a 3.5 year term as the next Artistic Director, leading the community with great care and creativity through an unexpected tenure of global change, ushering in a new era of service and flexibility. Liz Carlson succeeded Burney as the Interim Artistic Director in November 2022, after a 15-year relationship with NYSAF as an artist and producer, including a 7-year term as the year-round Artistic Producer. Learn more about NYSAF's company leadership.\n\n​\n\nFrom our inception in 1985, NYSAF and Vassar College partnered to produce the annual Powerhouse Summer Season in Poughkeepsie, NY. In the 2010s, NYSAF expanded our commitment to serving artistic process by supporting regular programming in New York City throughout the calendar year. As the world changed in 2020, we adapted our resources to meet the evolving needs of our community, and expanded our partnerships in the Hudson Valley to include Marist College and other local businesses and educational institutions. ​\n\nIn 2023, NYSAF entered a dedicated, multi-year collaboration with Marist College in order to expand our year-round services for artists developing new work in theater, film and television in the Hudson Valley and New York City while also opening up significant new educational programs and experiential learning opportunities for Marist students.\n\n​\n\nLearn more about our Annual Artist Support.\n\n​\n\nNotable productions that received vital incubation with NYSAF include: the Tony Award-winning Hamilton (Lin-Manuel Miranda), Hadestown (Anaïs Mitchell), The Humans (Stephen Karam), Doubt (John Patrick Shanley); OBIE Award winning The Invisible Hand (Ayad Akhtar), Pulitzer-finalists The Wolves (Sarah DeLappe) and Taylor Mac’s A 24-Decade History of Popular Music; Broadway musicals Head Over Heels, American Idiot, Bright Star; Off-Broadway’s The Fortress of Solitude (Michael Friedman and Itamar Moses), Sanctuary City (Martyna Majok); the award-winning Peanut Butter Falcon (Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz); multiple collaborations with Ngozi Anyanwu, Jocelyn Bioh, Halley Feiffer, Zach Helm, Beth Henley, Warren Leight, Mozhan Marnó, Billy Porter, Brian Quijada, Josh Radnor, Duncan Sheik, Steven Sater; and hundreds more.\n\n2020 -\n\n2023\n\n​\n\nNYSAF SUMMER SEASON\n\n​​\n\nKICK-OFF CONCERT\n\nJOE ICONIS & FAMILY by Joe Iconis\n\ndirected by John Simpkins\n\n​\n\nMUSICAL WORKSHOP\n\nA WRINKLE IN TIME\n\nadapted from the novel by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nbook by Lauren Yee\n\nmusic & Lyrics by Heather Christian\n\ndirection by Lee Sunday Evans\n\n​​\n\nPLAY WORKSHOP\n\nLIKE THEY DO IN THE MOVIES\n\nwritten and performed by Laurence Fishburne\n\ndirected by Leonard Foglia​\n\n2024 Production: Perelman Performing Arts Center\n\nSTORIES THAT MOVE: DEVELOPING DANCE MUSICAL\n\nPARADISE BALLROOM co-created by\n\nSamara Cohen (Princess Lockerooo) & Harold O’Neal\n\ndirected by Colette Robert\n\n​\n\nPLAY READINGS\n\nTHIS WAY TO THE FIRE by Jason Kim\n\ndirected by Danny Sharron\n\n​\n\nSOFT TARGET by Emily Kaczmarek\n\ndirected by Jo Bonney\n\n​\n\nTHE GOOD NAME by Sopan Deb\n\ndirected by Trip Cullman\n\nDOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR by Beth Henley\n\ndirected by Jaki Bradley\n\n​FILMMAKERS' WORKSHOP\n\nNancy Duff\n\n​\n\nHarrison Hamm\n\n​\n\nDrew Harper & Atticus Hoffman\n\n​\n\nSummera Howell\n\n​\n\nAnndi Jinelle Liggett\n\n​\n\nAllyson Morgan\n\n​\n\nCraig T.
