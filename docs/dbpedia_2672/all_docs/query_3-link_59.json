        "text": "Harry Shearer confirms the sad news\n\nEnglish rock musician and actor Ric Parnell, best known for playing doomed drummer Mick Shrimpton in This Is Spinal Tap, has died aged 70.\n\nHarry Shearer, aka Spinal Tap’s Derek Smalls, broke the news of Parnell’s passing on Sunday (1st May) on Twitter.\n\nHe wrote: “Ric Parnell, our drummer in This is Spinal Tap, passed away today. No one ever rocked harder.”\n\nThe son of bandleader and musician Jack Parnell, Richard J Parnell was born in London in August 1951 and was a member of the short-lived band Horse before joining progressive rockers Atomic Rooster in 1970.\n\nHe departed Atomic Rooster after just two months but returned the following year and appeared on two studio albums ‘Made in England’ (1972) and ‘Nice 'n' Greasy’ (1973) before he exited for good in 1974.\n\nParnell performed drums for a variety of artists throughout the late 70s and early 80s, including Toni Basil on her ubiquitous one-hit wonder ‘Mickey’.\n\nHe even turned down the chance to join Journey after being asked by Steve Perry as he wanted to focus on his studio band Zoo Drive.\n\nParnell told Missoulian.com in 2007: \"I turned down Journey, and that was the biggest mistake of my life - professional mistake.\"\n\nParnell shot to global fame, however, in 1984 when he played Mick Shrimpton in Rob Reiner’s seminal rock mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap.\n\nShrimpton was a former house drummer for the Eurovision Song Contest and was the latest drummer to join Spinal Tap after a succession of drummers died in bizarre circumstances.\n\nInterviewed by Marty Di Bergi (Reiner) while in the bath, Mick Shrimpton says in one scene: “When I did join, you know, they did tell me (their drummers died) - they kind of took me aside and said, 'Well, Mick. It's, you know, it's like this.’ And it did kind of freak me out a bit but it can't always happen to everyone, can it? The law of averages.”\n\nSadly for Shrimpton, he perished when he spontaneously combusted during a concert with Spinal Tap in Japan in 1982.\n\nParnell drummed on the film’s official soundtrack, and when Spinal Tap reunited in 1992, he rejoined the band as Mick’s identical twin brother Ric Shrimpton.\n\nSpinal Tap’s second studio album ‘Break Like the Wind’ featured drumming from Parnell, however he didn’t participate in their 2009 reunion.\n\nIn more recent years, Parnell worked with Deniz Tek of Radio Birdman and he resided in Missoula, Montana\n\nRIP Ric Parnell.\n\nRock stars who have died in 2022:"
