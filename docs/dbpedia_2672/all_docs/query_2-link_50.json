        "text": "Barbra Streisand had not done a television special for CBS since 1968 (A Happening in Central Park).\n\nBusy with her film career, her manager, Marty Erlichman, explained that she received an average of 500 letters a week asking whether she planned to ever sing again. “I told her that she'd better do a TV show,” he said. “She won't be able to do a movie musical until 1975 because of previous commitments, so she agreed that the quickest way to end the speculation would be on television.”\n\nErlichman also held a grudge toward CBS, the TV network that had an exclusive, multi-year contract with Streisand. “The reason we didn't do any special for CBS for a long time was because of my running battle with Mike Dann,” Erlichman explained about Dann—who was senior vice president in charge of programming at CBS. “He never believed in Barbra as a talent. His idea for her was to put her in a special with Dick Van Dyke and Andy Griffith ... The last special we did was Central Park and it was right before her film career took off. We had it in the can and Mike Dann scheduled it to air on Sept. 12, 1968. Funny Girl was set to open on Sept. 18, 1968 and I begged him to air the special after the movie opened because it would be a more important event for CBS and Barbra. He wouldn't do it and I swore we wouldn't do anything for CBS until Mike Dann was out. When Fred Silverman came in we were ecstatic and we love to work with him. That's another reason we decided to do this special.”\n\nCBS announced that Barbra would make her return to television in her first special in five years and the sewing company, Singer, would sponsor the show. (One newspaper column reported that Singer would honor Barbra by presenting her with a gold sewing machine!)\n\nFor the new special, Barbra would utilize the \"one-woman show\" format that worked so well in My Name is Barbra and Color Me Barbra. “About five years ago [Barbra] had an idea to do an album where she sang with all sorts of musical instruments from around the world. We never did it, so she thought it would be a great idea for the special,” Erlichman stated.\n\nHusband and wife team Ken and Mitzie Welch, who have written acts for many performers (including Lorna Luft, Barry Manilow, and Carol Burnette), were recruited to handle the show's musical material, themed around a wide array of exotic musicians, instruments, and styles. Their work with Barbra goes back to 1962 on The Garry Moore Show when they arranged \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" as an ironic ballad for her.\n\nProduction began at Elstree Studios in the summer of 1973. “We had to shoot the special in stages,” Marty Erlichman explained, “because everyone was busy with other projects. We rehearsed here and then went to London. We would shoot a few days and then Gary and Dwight or Joe Layton would have to leave because of a prior commitment. When that happened Barbra would rehearse with the choreographer or go over her special material. It was very difficult to work under these conditions and normally everyone connected with the show would never do it the way we did it, but because they all wanted to do it, we just stuck it out and did it that way. Ray Charles was only available on July 26 and 27 so we had to stop what we were doing and do his segment. It was not easy and that's why it took ten weeks, as long as any movie takes, but I think it was worth it.”\n\nSeveral journalists visited the set to interview Streisand and report on the taping of the show. Barbra, working long hours with her crew, was described as relentless in the articles, when, in fact, she was just trying to get it right. She told one journalist from Cosmopolitan magazine, “Because you’re here I’m not having lunch with the director, the producer. I’m not discussing the shots and angles we’ll be working on for the next seven or eight hours. Yet what goes into those hours is forever, for posterity, that’s my show and a part of my life. But what am I going to get out of an interview? It doesn’t help the work to do an interview.”"
