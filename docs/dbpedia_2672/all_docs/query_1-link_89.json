        "text": "The Blue Lamp, directed by Basil Dearden, was a classic Ealing Studios film released in 1950.\n\nThe locations shots were filmed in the Edgware Road and the action takes place around the famous 'Met' Music Hall.\n\nFilm poster for the Blue Lamp\n\nIn it, Jack Warner plays a London policeman who is shot by a young criminal portrayed by Dirk Bogarde. The story is by Ted Willis and Jan Read. The script by ex-policeman T.E.B ‘Tibby’ Clarke lends the film a sense of authenticity and captures a snapshot of the post-war destabilisation of the family and the rise of the young delinquent that saw an increase in violent crime.\n\nPeggy Evans and Dirk Bogarde in The Blue Lamp\n\nFor more information see the link:\n\nHere is a film clip where Dick Bogarde shoots Jack Warner:\n\nThere is a link to West Hampstead because both Jack Warner and Dirk Bogarde lived here at different times.\n\nJack Warner\n\nJack Warner became the fatherly police officer Dixon of Dock Green in a television series of that name. Created by Ted Willis it ran from July 1955 until 1976. Dixon was a reassuring traditional officer of the law adapting his pre-war standards and wisdom to the different world of the 1960s: his regular opening ‘Evening all’, became embedded in the national vocabulary. The series altered its style as English society changed and became less cosy but the advent of a harsher view of police life shown in Z Cars brought an end to Dixon of Dock Green in 1976.\n\nJack Warner in Dixon of Dock Green\n\nBorn as Horace John Waters in Bromley in 1895, Warner had a long and successful career in film and television. His sisters Elsie and Doris Waters were well-known comedians who performed as Gert and Daisy in the music hall, radio and films.\n\nWarner studied automobile engineering for a year and began work in a garage for a firm of undertakers. In August 1913 he went to work as a mechanic in Paris and acquired a working knowledge of French which stood him in good stead throughout his life socially and as an entertainer. His imitation of Maurice Chevalier became a standard part of his repertoire. During WWI he served in France as a driver with the Royal Flying Corps and was awarded the meritorious service medal in 1918.\n\nHe returned to England and the motor trade in 1919, graduating from hearses to occasional car racing at Brooklands. He was over thirty before he became a professional entertainer making his West End début in 1935 in the double act of Warner and Darnell. He changed his name to Warner at this point because he did not want to trade on the reputation of his sisters.\n\nWarner moved from Prince Albert Road Primrose Hill, to a flat at No.56 Greencroft Gardens West Hampstead, where he lived in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nDuring WWII he moved from music hall to the stage and radio. Warner appeared in the films The Quatermass Xperiment (1954), The Ladykillers (1955) and Carve Her Name With Pride (1958). He was awarded the OBE in 1965 and died in Hammersmith in 1981.\n\nDirk Bogarde\n\nFrom 1922-25 the Van den Bogaerde family were at No.173 Goldhurst Terrace, having previously lived at No.39 Priory Terrace, off Abbey Road. Ulric van den Bogaerde was the art editor of The Times. Dirk Bogarde, his eldest son, was born in a nursing home in Hemstal Road on 28 March 1921. He was baptised at St Mary’s church, Abbey Road. Dirk began acting in 1939, and while at the Amersham Repertory company he met his lifelong companion and manager, Anthony Forwood. During his wartime service Bogarde took part in the battle for Normandy and the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\n\nBogarde returned to acting after the War. He first came to prominence in Doctor in The House (1954) and went on to become a matinee idol. When he could not get the kind of roles he wanted, he took the risk of buying out his Rank contract for £10,000. He received a British Academy award for his work with the director Joe Losey in The Victim (1961), the first mainstream film to portray the problems gay men had in society. Bogarde played a barrister who had a relationship with a young man. He also starred in The Servant (1963), Darling (1965), and Death in Venice (1971), which Bogarde considered his best film.\n\nDirk Bogarde, 1959 (NPG)\n\nHe wrote several volumes of his autobiography and six novels. He lived with Anthony Forwood, but was unable to say openly he was gay, as this was illegal for much of his career. Bogarde was knighted in 1992 and died at his flat in Cadogan Gardens in May 1999.\n\nLabels\n\nThis popular music venue was at 234 Kilburn High Road, on the corner of Messina Avenue. Many famous musicians including Johnny Cash and David Bowie played there. We look at the original building which was the Grange Cinema, and what happened when the National closed and was taken over by two different church groups. Grange Cinema The Grange was a large mansion standing in grounds of nine and a half acres and with a frontage to Kilburn High Road. It was the home of Ada Peters the widow of a wealthy coach builder who made coaches for Queen Victoria . Following Ada ’s death in 1910, the property was sold. The new owner was Oswald Stoll, a major name in the entertainment world who had already built the London Coliseum in St Martin ’s Lane, near Leicester Square . Stoll wanted to erect another Coliseum theatre in Kilburn. In fact, progress overtook him and instead of a theatre, the 2,028 seat Grange cinema opened on 30 July 1914 . This remained the biggest cinema in Kilburn until th\n\nThis is the story of how Frank Smith and his friend Jim Viney, began in a small way in Cricklewood and built the large and successful company of Smith’s Crisps. Early years Frank was born in 1875, in Hackney. His parents had left their native Suffolk by the mid-1860s for London, where his father ran a fruiterer and florist business. By 1881 the family were living over their corner shop at 128 Stoke Newington High Street, moving to Kingsland Road by 1891. Frank started working when he was 10-years old and went with his father to Covent Garden each morning to buy produce for their shop. Frank married Jessie Minnie Ramplin in Southwark in 1902. The couple and their six-year old daughter Laura were living in Mona Road Deptford in 1911, when Frank gave his occupation as ‘commercial traveller, confectionery’. Soon after this he went to work for a wholesale grocer by the name of Carter, in Smithfield. Carter had a side-line making potato crisps and Frank saw great potential in the product and\n\nI went to school with a bank robber, but I did not know it at the time. In January 1962 four men from Kilburn were arrested while attempting to break in through a window at the rear of the Barclays Bank in Kenton Road Harrow. In court the men were described as: Brian Shrimpton (19) a labourer from Palmerston Road; Brian Phillips (23) a driver also from Palmerston Road; David Francis Murphy (17) a labourer from Brondesbury Villas Kilburn, and John Stainer (18) a van boy from The Avenue Brondesbury. They had been in the Prince of Wales pub in Kingsbury when they were overheard planning the raid. But their luck was out - they did not know that the men at the next table were three policemen from the Flying Squad. The Kilburn men drove off in a van to check out the Kenton Road bank, then they went to The Cabin café at 80 Palmerston Road in Kilburn and back to Kenton to do the bank raid. They were unaware that they had been followed all the way by the Flying Squad and were totally surprised"
