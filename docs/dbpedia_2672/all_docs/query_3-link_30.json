        "text": "LP\n\nTDP 54030LP\n\nTrading Places present a reissue of John Barry's Zulu, originally released in 1964. One of the most important British film composers of all time, John Barry's body of work is simply astounding. In a career that spanned more than half a century, Barry composed some of the most popular soundtracks for British film and television, including eleven James Bond themes, winning numerous awards and accolades in the process. The son of a projectionist from York in the north of England, Barry was raised in a cinematic environment from a very young age and after a stint as an army trumpeter in Cyprus, he began to work back home in Britain for Jack Parnell and Ted Heath's Orchestra and after the subsequent formation of The John Barry Seven in 1957, he began to work in film and television. The highly evocative Zulu soundtrack of 1964 is the work that brought him to the attention of a wider audience, shortly before the first James Bond theme that would turn him into a household name; here the music shifts between an overriding tension and the kind of military fanfares reserved for pitched skirmishes on battlefields, the orchestrates peaks and troughs sounding every bit as stirring as anything recorded in Hollywood. 180 gram vinyl. Licensed by Cherry Red.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n3CD\n\nFVTD 230CD\n\nThe three-CD set Soundtracks and Singles 1963-1966 compiles the original soundtrack albums for Zulu (1964) and Four in the Morning (1965), both composed and conducted by John Barry, together with other recordings he made for Ember Records. The BAFTA-nominated Zulu was directed by Cy Endfield with a cast including Stanley Baker, Michael Caine, and Jack Hawkins. The film depicts British Army's defense of (and the Zulus' fearless assault on) Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. Originally released in 1964, and here mastered from original stereo tapes, the album comprises soundtrack music (with two of the tracks incorporating narration by Richard Burton) and \"A Selection of Zulu Stamps,\" which are essentially beat instrumentals flavored with southern-African influences performed by the John Barry Seven. Anthony Simmons's Four in the Morning won the Golden Sail award for best feature film at the Locarno International Film Festival, and earned Judi Dench a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer in 1965. The soundtrack album comprises John Barry's haunting original score plus four excerpts of dialogue featuring Dench, Ann Lynn, Norman Rodway, Brian Phelan, and Joe Melia. The dialogue only exists in mono, so the entire album is presented here in mono, followed by the music-only tracks in stereo, again mastered from original tapes. Both soundtrack albums were originally released on British independent label Ember Records, where John Barry was associate producer and head of A&R in the early '60s. A third disc spotlights other John Barry recordings for the label. These include two UK hit singles: the From Russia with Love theme (here also in an alternative version with organ) and the Barry-produced \"Christine,\" a satirical commentary on the Profumo affair, credited to the mysterious Miss X, as well as \"Fancy Dance,\" which served as the theme to the BBC's twice-weekly soap opera The Newcomers from 1965 to 1967. Barry (1933-2011) was one of the best-known composers of film music in the world. He went on to score many notable soundtracks, including the award-winning Born Free (1966), The Lion in Winter (1968), Midnight Cowboy (1969), The Cotton Club (1984), Out of Africa (1985), and Dances with Wolves (1990). In 1999 Barry was appointed OBE for services to music, and in 2002 he received the GoldenEye award, courtesy of the Ian Fleming Foundation.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nFVLP 231LP\n\nOriginally released in 1964, Zulu is among the most popular of John Barry's early soundtracks, and the main theme is still frequently heard on radio, conjuring up images of the British Army's defense of (and the Zulus' fearless assault on) Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, as depicted in Cy Endfield's BAFTA-nominated 1964 film starring Stanley Baker, Michael Caine, and Jack Hawkins. John Barry (1933-2011) was one of the best-known composers of film music in the world. His early career found him working as in-house arranger for EMI, leader of hit instrumental combo the John Barry Seven, and composer, arranger, and conductor on the first UK soundtrack LP (the 1960 Adam Faith vehicle Beat Girl). After Barry's involvement as arranger on the first James Bond film, Dr. No, in 1962, he was appointed as primary composer for the film franchise. In 2002 he received the GoldenEye award, courtesy of the Ian Fleming Foundation. Originally released in 1964 on the British indie label Ember Records, the LP comprises soundtrack music (with two of the tracks incorporating narration by Richard Burton) and \"A Selection of Zulu Stamps,\" which are essentially beat instrumentals flavored with southern-African influences performed by the John Barry Seven. Ember initially pressed the album in mono, switching to stereo for a 1972 reissue (same catalog number), although a stereo pressing had previously surfaced in the USA. Long unavailable on vinyl, Zulu is now reissued by Fantastic Voyage as a 180-gram pressing, mastered from original stereo tapes. The vinyl is housed in the original Ember sleeve artwork, and bears the label design prevalent at the time of the stereo pressing. John Barry went on to score many notable soundtracks, including the award-winning Born Free (1966), The Lion in Winter (1968), Midnight Cowboy (1969), The Cotton Club (1984), Out of Africa (1985), and Dances with Wolves (1990). In 1999 Barry was appointed OBE for services to music.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nDOC 112LP\n\nExciting, symphonic and instantly hummable, From Russia with Love's score (1963) is nothing short of a masterpiece. The opening theme sets the tone, beginning with a brash staccato version of the James Bond theme before suddenly sliding into a smooth swagger. John Barry keeps doing that same thing throughout the soundtrack, setting up expectations then knocking them down. Limited edition of 500 copies.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nHRK 8405LP"
