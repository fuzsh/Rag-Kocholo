        "text": "This time through, it’s just new music. I’m having some of the chairs in the library reupholstered and the place is a mess. We’ll stay in the main lounge.

Then we get comfy in the library, greeted by some post-rock (with its own bits of fiery guitar), and hang out until, as often happens, we reach a nice, quiet close.\n\nOh, yeah, there’s also one of those…\n\nStart Dave Preston, 9.20, Life/Love\n\n4.07 Blue Is Nine, Whisper of the Wind, Drifting Through the Night\n\n9.41 Ánicoc, Kiiro, Teku\n\n14.00 Alan Matthews, Speaking of Wonder, Seasons Change\n\n18.34 Carl Lord, Stained Glass, Rest\n\n24.19 Brannan Lane, John Gregorius & Sean O’Bryan Smith, The Gate, Emergence\n\n29.23 Active Dark Filament, The Unquiet Space, Mariners of Space and Time\n\n35.48 Jim Ottaway, Divided Skies, Infinite Universes\n\n45.15 Under the Reefs Orchestra, Tucuman, Under the Reefs Orchestra\n\n50.07 SONAR, String Geometry, Black Light\n\n56.02 Eleven33, Hope Hurts, Chasing Light\n\n1.00.53 Alessio Premoli, Barefoot in the Morning, Even Silence Has Gone\n\n1.04.03 Miaou, Paper on You, Bring the Lights\n\n1.10.08 Umbrose, The Crying Mask, Final Nights\n\n1.17.28 Hennie Bekker, Quiessence, Beyond Dreams – Pathways to Deep Relaxation\n\nGet the children to safety in the bunker! There’s a theme show a’comin!\n\nYeah, it’s that time again. Mr. Shanahan gets a “clever idea” and runs with it. (And yes, this is the one I talked about on 393…) Look at it this way: you get 20 tracks of musical goodness out of it! Enjoy!\n\nStart Matthew Stewart, Who Stays Who Goes, A World Bathed in Sunlight\n\n5.45 Darshan Ambient, Who Will Answer, Falling Light\n\n9.32 Radium 88, Who Will Save Us from the Waves, The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Space Traveller\n\n14.55 Cousin Silas, Ron Shayler & Glenn Sogge, Who Am I?, Cousin Silas & Friends Vol 8 Pt 1\n\n19.21 Ken Elkinson, What I Needed to Say Music for Commuting, Vol. 11 & 12, Next Friday / Above Beyond\n\n22.25 Ex Confusion, What It Means to Me, With Love\n\n25.41 Robert Rich, What We Left Behind, What We Left Behind\n\n31.23 Bruno Sanfilippo, What I Dreamed, Lost & Found\n\n36.33 Lopside, When, When You’re Finally Through Being Responsible\n\n44.11 IIITAIII, When It Rains, Zeros and Twos\n\n47.35 Bett Butler & Joel Dilley, When Everything Changed, Gracia\n\n54.37 Charm Days, Where Monsters Roamed, Shelter\n\n57.19 Jeff Pearce, Where All Rivers Begin, In the Season of Fading Light\n\n1.00.22 Laurence Furr, Where Angels Tread, Upon the Corner of the Moon\n\n1.04.13 Everyday Dust, Where Light Fails, The Green Decay\n\n1.09.37 Forest Robots, Where The Wild Summer Storms Run, Timberline and Mountain Crest\n\n1.13.09 Taylor Barefoot, Why So Serious?, Distressed Signals\n\n1.17.33 Boy Is Fiction, Why Did You Do That?, Boy Is Fiction\n\n1.23.42 TheDetroit76, Why Not Detroit, Premiere\n\n1.27.29 Matthew Collings, Why Do You Want It To End?, Uzonia\n\nHolding Tanks 1 and 2 continue to drain even as I fill Tank 3, and the result is an interesting flow that weighs a bit heavily on the dark, quiet side. Some of this music has sat waiting for me to get to it for a year or so — but thankfully, good music doesn’t have an expiration date. Dig in and enjoy.\n\nStart Magnofon, Terra, Terrarium\n\n5.10 Dylab, Electronic Intelligence, Atoms for Peace*\n\n11.28 Cor de Lux, Whose Side, Media\n\n15.20 .cut., 200 Dead Bodies On Mount Everest, Sinistre\n\n18.54 ‘t Geruis, Verzengend, Slow Dance on Moss Beds\n\n22.25 Orogen, Canopy, Societal Eye\n\n28.02 B.

That would be me.\n\nWe’re off to a slick start with some smooth sax and sliding our way down into some drifty grooves. Then we’re off to the library to visit some old friends. (One going back to ’05!)\n\nStart Gian Berselli & Jérémy Marais, Insight, Creative Stillness\n\n5.52 Headland, Bullfinch, Bullfinch\n\n21.59 Alan Matthews, Andalusia, All That I Can See\n\n25.20 Jonny Lipford, Believing Your Truth, Balance\n\n32.34 Ümlaut, 120 Degrees, Grand Trine\n\n37.56 Julien Demoulin, Solar Dust Drone, Dreams In Digital Dust\n\n48.04 Khara, Currahee, There Were Heroes Amongst Us\n\n56.18 Kodomo Gate, 5A, Frozen in Motion\n\n59.58 Bob Holroyd, Flow, Blueprint\n\n1.03.28 Jeff Greinke, Outflow, Other Weather\n\n1.07.50 Slow Dancing Society, Spokane Falls, Torchlight Parade Vol II\n\n1.12.25 Tom Eaton, Stars Above Great Water, Elements Part Four: Water\n\n1.22.00 Numina, Drift Catalyst, Eye of the Nautilus\n\nOh, heck, you know the drill.

Talk to you in 90.\n\nStart LAD, Impulse, Fluidity\n\n6.08 Norm Chambers, Sargasso, Seaside Resonance\n\n10.03 Parnell March, Melissa’s Meditation, Melissa’s Meditation\n\n17.17 Alex Green, Prettier in a Different Context, Curvature of the Earth\n\n21.30 Kim Halliday, A Shade Perhaps or a Shadow, Desiderium\n\n24.49 Joss Jaffe, Tarang (single)\n\n33.04 Iain Ross, Leaving, Everywhere & Always\n\n36.44 Paul Oednom, Dropping Back, Vital Contrast\n\n41.26 We Deserve This, Halo, Tearing\n\n45.37 Sleep City Devils, Canyon Soul, Sunscreen\n\n48.29 Keith Richie, Dawn, Epica\n\n53.03 Tapes and Topographies, A Few Words About Abra, Monomials\n\n59.06 Willebrant, Plateau (Into the Valley), The Pilgrim\n\n1.07.06 eyes cast down, First Day Apart (2021 Remix), Visions of Old Souls\n\n1.14.49 The Ambient Visitor, Gliding Through the Moonlight (excerpt), Gliding Through the Moonlight\n\nThere’s beauty and there’s darkness and then there’s dark beauty. We’ll dabble in all of those to start. The second half gets its funk on a bit and, to be honest, erupts in a bit of post-rock glory. But it all quiets down in the end. Shall we?\n\nStart ‘t Geruis, Le Tombeau Du Geant, Various Thoughts and Places\n\n5.29 Glåsbird, Skating Baikal, Siberia\n\n12.28 Memory Scale, A Question of Landmarks, Soft Power\n\n19.04 Forrest Fang, The Land of Nine Rivers, Forever Cascades\n\n28.38 Ilsól, Sarmata, Sarmata\n\n35.21 Kelly David, Distance, Illusive\n\n45.50 P.M.
