        "text": "He died at home in Southwold, Suffolk, yesterday following a year-long battle with cancer. He had also suffered from lung disorder chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nHe continued to perform until three years ago, playing jazz in venues near his home in Southwold, Suffolk.\n\nHis wife Veronica said: ''He just used to love to tap away.''\n\nParnell died just two days after his birthday for which he raised a glass of champagne with his family.\n\nHis son Will - also a composer - said: ''He was determined to make it to see his birthday.''\n\nLondon-born Parnell had performance in his blood - his father was a music hall artist while his uncle Val ran a string of theatres including the London Palladium.\n\nHe began to study piano as a child but found his niche on the drums, making his debut as a teenager on the seafront at Scarborough.\n\nWhile serving in the RAF he became part of a band performing at the RAF Bomber Command HQ in High Wycombe.\n\nParnell also led his own band during this time and from 1951 left Heath to lead 12-piece and then a 16-piece band.\n\nWhen ITV launched, he landed the role of musical director for ATV - for which Parnell's uncle Val was by now managing director.\n\nDuring his decades at the broadcaster, he worked with legends such as Ella Fitzgerald, Sammy Davis Jr, Lena Horne and Nat King Cole.\n\nHe also made series with Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck, acted as a panellist on TV talent show New Faces and was musical director for programmes such as The Benny Hill Show and a lavish production of Peter Pan starring Mia Farrow, Sir John Gielgud and Danny Kaye. He also composed signature tunes for programmes such as Family Fortunes.\n\nParnell retired from ATV in 1982, when it became Central Television, moving to Southwold but continuing to perform with the all-star veterans group Best Of British Jazz with trumpeter Kenny Baker and trombonist Don Lusher. He also played with his small group for weekly shows at the Green Man in Rackheath, Norfolk."
