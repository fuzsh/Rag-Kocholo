New Song is a manifestation of Chun’s ongoing pursuit for sensitivity, understanding and praise. You can expect music which explores diverse expressions and landscapes from a quartet of strong characters.\n\nLine up:\n\nJon Green – Trumpet/FX\n\nTom Gibbs – Piano\n\nEwan Hastie – Bass\n\nChun-Wei Kang – Drums/Composition\n\n“His time steady as a heartbeat in stasis. Reminded me of Oscar, Getz, Brown, and Ellis – all drumless but swinging away effortlessly.”"
