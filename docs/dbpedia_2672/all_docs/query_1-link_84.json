        "text": "Cherry’s first Blue Lamp Disco was held in an ex Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Police Station in Belfast in June 2010. The Blue Lamp Discos were run by the RUC from the late 1970’s through to the early 1990’s, during some of the most turbulent times of The Troubles in Northern Ireland. The discos were held as part of the RUC’s youth outreach work. Basically they were discos held by police officers in local schools and youth clubs, to keep young people off the streets. The discos are mentioned in numerous Chief Constables Reports throughout this period and the numbers attending these events reached at one stage 300,000 in one year. For the opening of this work Cherry, recreated a Blue Lamp Disco, complete with period music, lights and costume. In the accompanying videos she mimes to a series of law related songs, including ‘Long Time Woman’ by Pam Grier, ‘Breaking the Law’ by Judas Priest and ‘Earl had to Die’ by The Dixie Chicks.\n\nBlue Lamp Disco Installation Videos\n\nAfter the Disco – Ballad of the Prisoners Wife in situ\n\nThe Habitual Offender – ‘Long Time Woman’ interpretation"
