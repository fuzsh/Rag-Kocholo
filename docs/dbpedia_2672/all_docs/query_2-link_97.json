        "text": "Horror returns to the box office with the release of M. Night Shyamalan’s latest movie this week, and it’s being joined by seven other horror movies in theaters and streaming at home.\n\nHere’s all the new horror releasing July 29, 2024 – August 4, 2024!\n\nFor daily reminders about new horror releases, be sure to follow @HorrorCalendar.\n\nDirector Michael Sarnoski’s A Quiet Place: Day One just passed $250 million at the worldwide box office, and the prequel movie is now available on Digital at home.\n\nExperience the day the world went quiet in the blockbuster hit A Quiet Place: Day One, arriving to buy or rent on Digital today (July 30) from Paramount Home Entertainment.\n\nA three-movie collection including A Quiet Place, A Quiet Place: Part II and A Quiet Place: Day One is also be available to purchase on Digital platforms beginning today, July 30.\n\n“When Samira (Lupita Nyong’o) returns home to New York City, her simple trip turns into a harrowing nightmare when mysterious creatures that hunt by sound attack. Accompanied by her cat Frodo and an unexpected ally (Joseph Quinn), Samira must embark on a perilous journey through the city that has suddenly gone silent, where the only rule is to stay quiet to stay alive. Djimon Hounsou and Alex Wolff also star in this intensely suspenseful thriller.”\n\nFrom the writer of Shark Side of the Moon comes The Asylum’s Shark Warning, which first swam to limited theaters on July 26 before arriving on VOD outlets today, July 30.\n\nIn Shark Warning, “After 20 years, a man returns to the town where his brother was killed by a shark. But when it resurfaces and kills again, the man decides to hunt down the predator.”\n\nOf course, the storyline is set into motion when a bunch of pesky humans commit the cardinal sin of shark attack movies, putting their own greed ahead of the safety of the town’s residents. Yup, it’s another low-budget Jaws. You already know what you’re getting from this one.\n\nDavid Chokachi, Andrew J. Katers and Angela Cole star.\n\nJimmy Gadd directed Shark Warning, written by Ryan Ebert.\n\nEscape Room meets Cube in Lionsgate’s new horror movie The Abandon, which first arrived in select theaters on July 19. Beginning today, the film is now available on VOD outlets.\n\nJonathan Rosenthal, Tamara Perry, and Regis Terencio star.\n\nIn the film, “Injured U.S. soldier Miles Willis awakens after witnessing a blinding white light from a battlefield in Iraq to discover he is trapped in a mysterious cube armed only with his combat gear. His dire situation escalates as the cube begins to change with violent shifts in gravity and the appearance of cryptic writing on the walls.\n\n“As Miles begins to question his sanity, he finds a lifeline – a voice on the other end of his satellite phone who claims to be a prisoner in a similar space. As the walls close in, these two strangers must put their heads together if they are to outwit their captors and unlock this deadly puzzle.”\n\nJason Satterlund directed The Abandon.\n\nA South Korean horror anthology featuring the works of Won-kyung Choi, Byeong-deock Jeon, Jisam, Jang-mi Kim, Gwang-Jin Lee, and Wally Seo, the SCREAMBOX Exclusive Body Parts is now streaming on SCREAMBOX and also available on VOD outlets.\n\nIn the film, “Si-kyung, the youngest reporter, infiltrates an unnamed religious group. Invited to a special ceremony, she witnesses strange things happening in the prayer house.\n\n“Five sacrifices and five stories are offered by the people who desperately wait to be heard by their god. When the story is over, she too must make a sacrifice.”\n\nA wildly unofficial sequel to the Charles Bronson movie 10 to Midnight from 1983, the upcoming werewolf film 12 to Midnight stars Bronson lookalike Robert Bronzi (Death Kiss).\n\nThe film comes to DirecTV and VOD outlets this Thursday, August 1.\n\nUFC champion Tito Ortiz (Trauma Center, The Crow: Wicked Prayer), Daniel Roebuck (Rob Zombie’s The Munsters, the upcoming Terrifier 3), and Sadie Katz (Wrong\n\nTurn 6: Last Resort) also star in 12 to Midnight.\n\nThe film concerns a detective, despondent after the murder of his wife and forced to resign, who is brought back to the force when a new string of murders seem connected to his wife’s and the killer appears to be taunting him. Only the killer may be superhuman…\n\n12 to Midnight also stars Helene Udy (My Bloody Valentine), Evan Strand, Patrick Voss Davis, Juliet Biscotti, A.C. Bernardi, Tom Parnell, Sarah Cugini, Searra Sawka, Destiny Leilani Brown (Hell House LLC Origins: The Carmichael Manor), and Valerie Bittner.\n\nMark Savage (Purgatory Road, Bring Him Back Dead) directs from a screenplay by Joe Knetter (Blind), Jeff Miller (Ouija House), Tom Parnell, and Savage, based on a story by Miller.\n\nHammer Films returns to life with a new owner and a new slate of movies, and up first is the Eddie Izzard-starring Doctor Jekyll. It’s coming to U.S. theaters on VOD August 2.\n\nDirector Joe Stephenson, of acclaimed drama “Chicken” and feature documentary “McKellen: Playing the Part,” developed the new adaptation of the classic tale from Robert Louis Stevenson’s 1886 novella with first time writer Dan Kelly-Mulhern.\n\nDoctor Jekyll focuses on a reclusive Nina Jekyll finding friendship with her newly hired help, Rob, played by rising star Scott Chambers, who must work together to prevent Hyde from destroying her life. The film is described as “a slow-burn gothic horror that delves into themes of duality, concocting a surprising mix of dark humor and flashes of camp within a twisted fairytale.”\n\nDoctor Jekyll also stars Scott Chambers, Simon Callow, Lindsay Duncan, Jonathan Hyde, Morgan Watkins and Robyn Cara. Watch the official trailer from Hammer below.\n\nA group of young friends staying at an Airbnb are picked off one by one by a killer whose elaborate murder set pieces are inspired by the seven deadly sins in our latest production, #AMFAD: All My Friends Are Dead, which comes to select theaters and VOD August 2.\n\nThe slasher comes from Saw IV-3D writer and The Collector director Marcus Dunstan.\n\n“In the horror thriller #AMFAD: All My Friends Are Dead, a group of college friends rent an Airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year. A weekend of partying quickly takes a turn, as the group is murdered one by one, according to their sin.”\n\nJade Pettyjohn, Jennifer Ens, Ali Fumiko Whitney, Michaella Russell, Julian Haig, Justin Derickson, Cardi Wong and Jack Doupe-Smith star with singer JoJo Siwa.\n\nTake your seats. The show is about to begin. M. Night Shyamalan’s Trap, the filmmaker’s sixteenth movie, comes to theaters from Warner Bros. this Friday, August 2.\n\nSaleka Shyamalan stars in the new thriller as fictional pop star Lady Raven.\n\nIn the upcoming thriller also starring Josh Hartnett, “A father and teen daughter attend a pop concert, where they realize they’re at the center of a dark and sinister event.”\n\nHartnett had recently described the mysterious film as “very bizarre” and “very dark.”\n\nAccording to IMDb, the cast for Trap also includes Hayley Mills, Marnie McPhail, Vanessa Smythe, Saleka Shyamalan, Scott Ian MacDougall, Kristi Woods, and Cali Lorella.\n\nTrap is the first film Shyamalan has made under his new deal with Warner Bros., which has been described as a “multi-year first-look directing and producing agreement.”"
