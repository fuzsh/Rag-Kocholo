        "text": "E-Book Overview\n\nThis book provides an in-depth description of water resources of Turkey, a country with a unique geographical location, extending from the Mediterranean in Europe to the Middle East. Its varying geography, topography, hydrology, geology and climate are reflected in the diverse characteristics of its water basins. Furthermore, due to its geographical location, Turkey has a significant number of transboundary river basins and has to share its water resources with its neighbors, an issue that can sometimes lead to water conflicts.\n\nTurkey is also an interesting example of a developing country that is attempting to adapt to universal water management strategies while at the same time facing legal, institutional, economic and capacity development problems. It has long remained a water-rich country, but the situation is now changing due to the increasing population, inefficient use of resources, and the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\nThis book is useful for national and international organizations as well as water resources professionals. It takes on an added significance in the light of climate change in the region, water management problems and transboundary water basins.\n\nE-Book Content\n\nWorld Water Resources\n\nNilgun B. Harmancioglu Dogan Altinbilek Editors\n\nWater Resources of Turkey\n\nWorld Water Resources Volume 2\n\nSeries Editor Vijay P. Singh, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA\n\nThis series aims to publish books, monographs and contributed volumes on water resources in the world, with particular focus per volume on water resources of a particular country or region. With the freshwater supplies becoming an increasingly important and scarce commodity, it is important to have under one cover up to date literature published on water resources and their management, e.g. lessons learnt or details from one river basin may be quite useful for other basins. Also, it is important that national and international river basins are managed, keeping each country’s interest and environment in mind. The need for dialog is being heightened by climate change and global warming. It is hoped that the Series will make a contribution to this dialog. The volumes in the series ideally would follow a “Three Part” approach as outlined below: In the chapters in the ﬁrst Part Sources of Freshwater would be covered, like water resources of river basins; water resources of lake basins, including surface water and under river ﬂow; groundwater; desalination; and snow cover/ ice caps. In the second Part the chapters would include topics like: Water Use and Consumption, e.g. irrigation, industrial, domestic, recreational etc. In the third Part in different chapters more miscellaneous items can be covered like impacts of anthropogenic effects on water resources; impact of global warning and climate change on water resources; river basin management; river compacts and treaties; lake basin management; national development and water resources management; peace and water resources; economics of water resources development; water resources and civilization; politics and water resources; water-energy-food nexus; water security and sustainability; large water resources projects; ancient water works; and challenges for the future. Authored and edited volumes are welcomed to the series. Editor or co-editors would solicit colleagues to write chapters that make up the edited book. For an edited book, it is anticipated that there would be about 12–15 chapters in a book of about 300 pages. Books in the Series could also be authored by one person or several co-authors without inviting others to prepare separate chapters. The volumes in the Series would tend to follow the “Three Part” approach as outlined above. Topics that are of current interest can be added as well. Readership Readers would be university researchers, governmental agencies, NGOs, research institutes, and industry. It is also envisaged that conservation groups and those interested in water resources management would ﬁnd some of the books of great interest. Comments or suggestions for future volumes are welcomed. Series Editor: Vijay P.

It generates hydroelectric energy up to 9 TWh/y. The dam is functional since 1992 and is widely considered to be not only the largest dam in Turkey, but also one of the largest in the world (Photo by Prof. Dr. Unal Ozis)\n\nForeword\n\nIn world geography, Turkey occupies a unique place connecting Europe and the Middle East. It has varied landscape and varied climate, which, in turn, reﬂect diverse space-time characteristics of its water resources. These diverse characteristics present a challenge and an opportunity to policy makers, the agencies responsible for water resource management, the agricultural sector involved in growing crops, the energy sector involved in generating hydropower, the municipalities responsible for water supply, the departments of tourism involved in providing recreational facilities, as well as those involved in environmental and ecosystem management. Further, because of its situation, Turkey has a number of transboundary river basins, which compound the aforementioned challenge and opportunity. A comprehensive treatise dealing with a broad range of water resource issues pertaining to Turkey has long been desired, and the need for such a treatise has increased under the specter of climate change and global warming and the transformation of the country from a water-rich nation to a not-so-water-rich nation, facing frequent water scarcity because of a growing population, rising standard of living, increasing demand for water, and less-than-proper water management. This book, edited by Professors Harmancioglu and Altinbilek, meets this long-felt need. Beginning with a discussion of the factors that shape Turkey’s water resources and their availability and distribution, the book, encompassing 17 chapters, provides a detailed treatment of water use and consumption, as well as management, legislation, sustainability and security, climate change, ancient water works, and future outlook. The book contains a wealth of information, reﬂecting the vast and rich experiences of not only the editors but also the chapter contributors. There is much to learn from this book which more than meets the objectives of the World Water Resources book series. It shows how water management strategies can be developed in concert with legal, institutional, economic, and capacity development requirements. These strategies enhance sustainability and water security and promote the water-food-energy nexus. The material presented in the various chapters is equally relevant to many countries in the world—a point for launching the book series. vii\n\nviii\n\nForeword\n\nBoth Professors Harmancioglu and Altinbilek deserve a lot of applause and ought to be congratulated for preparing this treatise, which will be of enormous value to the people of Turkey and will also enrich the water resource literature.

Singh\n\nPreface\n\nEnvironmental and water crises dominate the present world we live in. Pollution is observed at varying degrees of intensity in almost all natural resources. The quality of surface and ground waters is continuously degrading to limit their use. Similarly, land resources are exposed to problems of soil erosion, deforestation, urban sprawl, and desertiﬁcation in many parts of the world. Another problem in particular regions is air pollution, which has already reached life- and health-threatening levels. All these adverse conditions have eventually endangered physical habitat for biodiversity. There are also some recent problems to aggravate the situation, i.e. climate change and its possible effects on various components of the environment. Certainly, environmental degradation not only endangers nature, but it also has serious social and economic implications. An important feature of the above problems is that they are experienced globally; that is, all countries experience one or more of these adverse conditions at different degrees of severity and coverage. The same is valid for water resources so that it is important to work out commonalities and differing aspects of world water resources. Springer has initiated a new book series entitled World Water Resources, edited by Professor Vijay P. Singh from Texas A&M University, USA. The reason for starting the book series was to have a comprehensive understanding of water resources of different countries and how these countries are planning and managing their water resources. With the freshwater supplies becoming an increasingly important and scarce commodity, it is important to have under one cover up-to-date literature published on world water resources and their management. Lessons learned from one river basin may be quite useful for other basins. Since many countries share their resources with each other, it is deemed useful to have an unbiased assessment of these resources, which will help resolve legal issues arising from mutual conﬂicts. That means national and international basins must be managed, keeping each country’s interest and environment in mind. This book is proposed as one of the ﬁrst volumes to contribute to the above book series and provides an in-depth description of water resources in Turkey. Turkey has a unique geographical location in the world, extending in part from Europe to the ix\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nMediterranean and further to the Middle East. This means that its water resources also reﬂect diverse characteristics under varying geography, topography, hydrology, geology, and climate among its water basins. Furthermore, due to its geographical location, Turkey has a signiﬁcant number of transboundary river basins as an upstream and downstream country and has to share her water resources with her neighbors, an issue that sometimes may lead to water conﬂicts. Turkey is also an interesting example as a developing country that tries to adapt to universal water management strategies but with legal, institutional, economic, and capacity development drawbacks. The country has long remained as a water-rich country, but the situation is now reversed to problems of water scarcity due to increasing population, inefﬁcient use of the resource, impacts of climate change, and environmental degradation. The book is designed in three parts, as required for the book series. The ﬁrst part is devoted to physical features shaping the country’s water resources, e.g., geography, topography, geology, hydrology, meteorology, climate, and the similar. The second part focuses on water use and consumption comprising the three major uses of water in Turkey, which relate to the domestic (drinking and industrial), agriculture (irrigation), and water power (hydroelectric energy) sectors. The third part of the book addresses the so-called miscellaneous issues, but all of which are highly signiﬁcant in terms of water management. These issues, in particular, are river basin management, water-related legislation, sustainability and water security issues, impacts of global warming and climate change, ancient water works, and challenges for the future. A special section is devoted to transboundary river basins in Turkey as a signiﬁcant portion of the water resources is transboundary and deserves special attention with regard to political conﬂicts and peace in the region. The above three parts are addressed via 17 chapters, including the introductory chapter (Chap. 1), which provides a summary of each section. Chapters 2 and 3 reﬂect an interesting feature of water resource systems and structures in Turkey, that is, one may encounter in the country both the world’s most ancient water works (Chap. 2) and the modern advanced systems developed during the Republican era (Chap. 3), which are unique in many ways. Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 present an indepth description of the physical features of water resources in the country, including a comprehensive chapter on Turkey’s climate. The following three chapters constitute the second part of the book, i.e., water use and consumption. Three areas, agriculture (Chap. 9), water power (Chap. 10), and domestic/industrial water (Chap. 11), are considered in these chapters as the major water-consuming sectors. The third part of the book starts with Chap. 12 on transboundary river basins in Turkey. Transboundary and/or boundary-forming rivers have a signiﬁcant contribution to the overall water potential of Turkey; they also play an important role with respect to the possible mutual conﬂicts among riparian countries and peace in the region. Chapter 13 addresses the practices of river basin management in Turkey, the importance of which is recognized only within the last decade. The major issues that\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\ninﬂuence water management are discussed in Chap. 14 on the expected impacts of climate change and Chap. 15 on the Turkish legislation relevant to water resources. Chapter 16 basically complements Chap. 13 to elaborate further on water management through discussing concepts of sustainability, water security, water allocation, and the water-food-energy nexus. The last chapter, Chap. 17, is basically a wrap-up of current problems regarding water resources and management in Turkey and discusses challenges for the future in the light of these problems. The reader may ﬁnd some commonalities between the chapters since many aspects of water resources cannot be separated by clear-cut lines but are components of the same water continuum (e.g., features like hydrology and water potential, groundwater and precipitation, climate and precipitation). Likewise, ﬁgures given for the same entities may vary slightly from chapter to chapter, depending on possible discordances between the derivations of these ﬁgures by different authors. However, these variations are minor and do not affect the overall level of the entities. No book has been published as yet in Turkey to cover all aspects of water resources in the country, related problems, and water management issues as comprehensive as in this volume. Thus, the presented work will be, in a way, a useful “reference book” or a guide for all members of water communities in the country, including authorities, institutions, water users, academicians, and all other professionals. It is believed that the international water community will also welcome this volume as it demonstrates a multifaceted example of water developments and associated problems in a typical developing country under water stress. Water professionals, practitioners, managers, governmental authorities, and scientists at the international level are expected to beneﬁt from the book in terms of working out commonalities and differing aspects of world water resources. Information and lessons derived from this example will be useful for basins and their management problems in other countries. In particular, Turkey’s unique geographical position linking Europe and Asia and the presence of signiﬁcant transboundary river basins will be important factors in arousing international interest in the volume. It must be mentioned here that the authors contributing to this book are eminent professors and government authorities, renowned in their area of expertise both in Turkey and on the international platform. The editors would like to express their deep appreciation to all the contributors of the book, who have generously devoted their efforts and time toward the realization of this volume. The editors extend their special thanks to the key editor of the book series World Water Resources, Professor Vijay P. Singh of Texas A&M University, USA, and to Mrs. Petra van Steenbergen, executive editor of Springer Earth Sciences, Geography and Environment, for inviting them to prepare this book. Their valuable roles and support in initiating and realizing the present volume are gratefully acknowledged. Special thanks go to our colleagues Drs. Filiz Barbaros and Cem P. Cetinkaya, who committed themselves to scrupulous editing of the book throughout all stages of the work.\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nFinally, we would like to dedicate this book to the Republic of Turkey and to all those who have contributed to the development of water resources in the country. We expect that the work will shed light to future water developments and help water professionals and authorities recognize both the country’s strenghts to build on and the expected water problems that are ever growing.

The ﬁrst part is devoted to physical features shaping the country’s water resources; the second part focuses on water use and consumption, including domestic, agricultural (irrigation), and hydroelectric energy production uses. The third part of the book addresses the so-called miscellaneous issues, e.g., river basin management, water-related legislation, sustainability and water security issues, impacts of global warming and climate change, ancient water works, transboundary basins, and challenges for the future. The three basic parts of the book mentioned above are covered via 16 chapters, each of which gives a comprehensive description of the various features of water resources in Turkey. This introductory chapter is intended to shortly summarize the contents of these chapters so that it will be easier for the reader to select sections of interest.

Almost all natural resources are attacked by pollution at varying degrees of intensity. The quality of surface and ground waters is continuously degrading. The situation is similar for land resources with problems of soil erosion, deforestation, and desertiﬁcation in many parts of the world. Air pollution has already reached life and health threatening levels in particular regions. These problems have eventually endangered physical habitat for biodiversity. Further difﬁculties are expected due to the possible effects of climate N. B.

The result is that environmental degradation not only endangers nature, but it also has serious social and economic implications. An important feature of the above problems is that we live them globally; that is, all countries experience one or more of these adverse conditions at different degrees of severity and coverage. The global nature of the present environmental crisis, including water and its central role in the environment, has essentially been the major motive in initiating the new book series on “World Water Resources” by Springer. The basic idea behind this initiative is to work out commonalities and differing aspects of world water resources by dedicating each volume in the series to a different country. Regarding water resources, the book series will be a valuable source of information sharing at basin, national and international scales. Information and lessons learned on a river basin from a particular country may be useful for basins in other countries. At the national scale, the series foresees a comprehensive understanding of water resources of different countries and of how these countries are planning and managing their water resources. At the international scale, since many countries share their resources with each other in transboundary or international basins, it is deemed useful to have an unbiased assessment of these resources, which will also help resolve legal issues arising from mutual conﬂicts. There are other recent global issues to be addressed under the same cover, such as global climate change, water management, sustainability and water security, water-energy-food nexus, politics and water resources, and economic development. This book is proposed as a volume to contribute to the above book series and provides an in-depth description of water resources in Turkey. Turkey has a unique geographical location in the world, extending in-part from Europe to the Mediterranean and further to the Middle East (Fig. 1.1). This means that its water resources\n\nFig. 1.1 Geographical map of Turkey and her neighbors\n\n1 Introduction\n\n3\n\nalso reﬂect diverse characteristics under varying geography, topography, hydrology, geology, and climate among its water basins. Furthermore, due to its geographical location, Turkey has a signiﬁcant number of transboundary river basins and has to share her water resources with her neighbors, an issue that sometimes may lead to water conﬂicts. In view of the above-mentioned global environmental (water) crisis most countries experience today, it must be stated that Turkey is also a country currently under water stress although it was considered as being water-rich in the past. Countries regarded as being rich in water resources have 8–10 thousand m3 water per capita per year; and, on the basis of international standards and indices, the annual threshold value for water scarcity is stated as 1700 m3 per capita per year. The recent reports by state authorities reveal that the available water per capita in Turkey is in the order of 1400 m3. It is predicted that the population of Turkey will increase to 100 million in 2040 so that this value will reduce to 1120 m3. Thus, Turkey will experience a more enhanced water stress in the future, coupled with increases in relevant environmental problems. At this stage, it is important that prompt and sound actions are taken to reassess the prevailing water problems and to develop more effective policies for the planning and management of available water resources in the country. These issues are discussed in depth in the following chapters of this book. The overall picture of Turkey’s water resources structure, including the sources, developments and management of water, is highly complex and again unique in a number of ways, ranging from historical to present day features. Thus, only a book as comprehensive as this volume can “almost fully” cover the diverse characteristics of water resources in the country. The book is designed in three parts. The ﬁrst part is devoted to physical features shaping the country’s water resources, e.g. geography, topography, geology, hydrology, meteorology, climate, and the similar. Thus, sources of freshwater, surface water, groundwater, river basins, lakes, coastal waters, water quality, and wetlands are described in this ﬁrst part. Given that the source is identiﬁed with its many features, the second part focuses on water use and consumption. Three major water uses of water in Turkey relate to domestic (domestic and industrial), agriculture (irrigation), and water power (hydroelectric energy). Within the last decade, preservation of environmental (ecological) integrity has assumed the second priority among the above water uses after provision of domestic water. The third part of the book addresses the so-called miscellaneous issues, but all of which are highly signiﬁcant in terms of water management. These issues, in particular, are river basin management, water-related legislation, sustainability and water security issues, impacts of global warming and climate change, ancient water works, and challenges for the future. A special section is devoted to transboundary river basins in Turkey as a signiﬁcant portion of the water resources are transboundary and deserve special attention with regard to political conﬂicts and peace in the region. The three basic parts of the book mentioned above are covered via 16 chapters, each of which gives a comprehensive description of the various features of water resources in Turkey. This introductory chapter is intended to shortly summarize the contents of these chapters so that it will be easier for the reader to select sections of interest.\n\n4\n\nN. B. Harmancioglu\n\nAn interesting feature of water resources systems and structures in Turkey is that one may encounter both the world’s most ancient water works and the modern advanced systems, which are unique in many ways. Turkey is particularly known for her historical attractions in the tourism sector. The same is true for the water sector; that is, the country is renowned for her outstanding remnants of numerous ancient water works from a four-millenia-long period, some of which are still in operation. These historical works are rich in kind to encompass various types of water structures. Geographically, they extend all over the country, indicating the various civilizations who realized them. Chapter 2 of this book presents many examples of these ancient structures in colorful photos. After the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1923, Turkey started both to assess the availability of her water resources for various purposes and to harness the potential through concentrating on development plans and projects. The ﬁrst projects, mostly dams, date back to the 1930s and were realized under ﬁnancial constraints and signiﬁcant data limitations. These projects were certainly coupled with the establishment of water-related institutions and authorities. In the following years, water resources systems and structures ﬂourished in Turkish river basins for purposes of irrigation, domestic water supply, power generation, ﬂood control, and other purposes. The last three to four decades have witnessed large scale and unique development plans and systems, including water transfer among basins and even transport to neighboring water scarce regions. These new developments are covered in Chap. 3, providing interesting examples of the advanced modern projects in Turkish river basins. The next ﬁve chapters relate to the ﬁrst part of the book, i.e., the description of the physical features (geography, topography, geology, hydrology, meteorology, climate, and the similar) that constitute the driving forces or sources producing the overall picture of water resources in Turkey. It will be observed in all these chapters that the above mentioned physical features are marked by signiﬁcant diversity, leading also to diverse characteristics of water resources in Turkey. The ﬁnal output of these chapters will be the delineation of the water potential in the country, derived as the most recent ﬁgures presented so far. Chapter 4 focuses on the comprehensive analysis of Turkey’s climate, including the current aridity and drought conditions, by implementing a contemporary physical geographical, hydro-climatological and meteorological approach. The chapter covers a description of variable climatic conditions across all the geographical regions of the country. It discloses that “the southern and western portions (Marmara, Aegean, Mediterranean and South-eastern Anatolia regions) of Turkey are characterized mainly with the dry summer sub-tropical Mediterranean climate”, and further that “All of these regions are also inﬂuenced by mid-to-high degree drought probability and drought risk, while the Black Sea Region is characterized with a mid-latitude temperate climate with a low-level drought probability and risk.” The climate of Turkey is marked by diversity since it is affected by the transition zone of various atmospheric disturbances and weather types. The complexity of the topography, land-sea interactions and many other inﬂuences aggrevate this diversity. The chapter also discusses climate-induced soil properties and land degradation and,\n\n1 Introduction\n\n5\n\nthus, relates to the topic of desertiﬁcation as one of the signiﬁcant problems in Turkey. The diversity in Turkey’s climate is directly reﬂected in the hydrologic characteristics of freshwaters as detailed in Chap. 5 on surface water. Surface water resources of Turkey are divided between 25 river basins, each with its own hydrological and hydro-meteorological character. The share of surface waters in these basins contribute to 80% of the total water potential of the country. Chapter 5 presents in detail the characteristics of each river basin, including lakes, by disclosing their drainage areas, input precipitation, and average ﬂow conditions. This information is derived from data provided by the prevailing hydrometric gauging network in Turkey, which is also described as to its assets and limitations. The chapter further focuses on streamﬂow maxima and minima in the river basins since, due to the heterogeneity of hydro-meteorological conditions in the country, some regions are ﬂood-prone while others can be affected by extreme droughts. The trend analyses mentioned in the chapter ﬁnally conclude that extremes in surface ﬂows will become more pronounced with larger maxima and lower minima than those observed in the past. A comprehensive evaluation of groundwater in Turkey is presented in Chap. 6. A signiﬁcant portion of the streamﬂow of major rivers is supplied by groundwater through springs and base ﬂow. The aquifers in the country are grouped into four categories as the alluvial deposits/gravel aquifers, karstic aquifers, volcanic rock aquifers, and the fractured bedrock aquifers. The available groundwater potential provided by these aquifers is about 15 km3, accounting approximately to 18% of the total water resources potential of Turkey. Groundwater is basically used in irrigation, domestic and industrial water supply, where irrigation consumes about approximately two-thirds of the total amount of groundwater used. It is depicted in the chapter that “the share of the groundwater resources in sectoral water allocation has increased from 8.5 billion m3/year in 1995 to about 15 billion m3/year in 2014” and further “that the groundwater resources supply about 25% of the total water use in 2004 and about 30% in 2008”. The apparent overexploitation of groundwater resources and the accruing decrease of springs and/or spring ﬂows show the inevitable result that the groundwater resources are under severe natural and/or anthropogenic stresses in Turkey. Following the description of freshwaters and groundwater in quantitative terms in the preceding chapters, Chap. 7 presents an assessment of water quality in Turkish waters and the related pollution problems. It is stressed in the chapter that increases in production and consumption have caused serious pressures on water resources and the environment in Turkey. These problems are due to population increase, inland migration from rural to urban areas, industrialization, agriculture, expansion of tourism, and increases in economic activities and resource depletion. The work discusses the current status of water quality of inland and coastal waters (river, lake, groundwater and marine pollution) in Turkey, along with the associated legislation. Current wastewater management schemes and efforts towards the improvement of the pollution situation (surface water and groundwater pollution, lake pollution, marine pollution and removal of sludge), using available treatment and disposal\n\n6\n\nN. B. Harmancioglu\n\ntechnologies, are also considered in depth. The chapter concludes that, although environmental loads have increased several hundred times in the last 50–60 years, Turkey has shown a fast and consistent response to the situation as sufﬁcient expertise, funds, regulations, and responsible governmental agencies have developed. The ﬁrst part of the book concludes with Chap. 8, which presents the overall results for the water potential of Turkey. The chapter is based on a very recent study carried out by the former Ministry of Forestry and Water and the related institutions (State Hydraulic Works, Meteorological Services, and the Directorate General of Water Management). The work comprises a compilation and review of the available data on precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater and surface ﬂows between 1981 and 2010, and the main factors affecting Turkey’s water potential. The computed values for the water resources potential in each of the 25 river basins in the country are disclosed together with the country’s total water potential, which was derived by a water balance approach. The chapter further presents recent information on maximum and minimum values of the hydrologic and meteorological components of the water cycle, using the period between 1981 and 2010 as the reference years. The following three chapters constitute the second part of the book, i.e. water use and consumption. Three sectors, agriculture, domestic/industrial water and water power, are considered in these chapters as the major water consuming sectors. Chapter 9 focuses on irrigated agriculture and states that irrigation is a must in almost all basins since the spatial and temporal distribution of input precipitation is highly variable across the country. The total irrigable area in Turkey is 25.85 million hectares (Mha), of which 22.6 Mha land can be economically and technically irrigable under present conditions. However, only 8.5 Mha area is expected to be equipped with irrigation schemes by DSI (the State Hydraulic Works) by the year 2023, which is the centennial of the foundation of the Turkish Republic. Irrigation is the largest water consuming sector in Turkey and uses about 74% of the total water potential of Turkey. However, the share of water use for irrigation is projected to be reduced to 64% by 2023. The chapter gives information on the institutional framework in irrigation developments and discusses irrigation practices in each of the 25 river basins of the country. It also introduces large scale regional development projects including irrigation investments. Among these, the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) deserves special attention as it is considered as one of the biggest integrated development projects in the world, comprising several aspects such as irrigation, ﬂood control, environment, hydropower generation, education, health, industry, etc. Chapter 10 is devoted to water power and hydroelectric potential of Turkey. The primary energy resources of Turkey are quite limited; therefore Turkey has to develop her water power potential to produce electrical energy. The hydroelectric energy production of Turkey was only 1 TWh/year in 1960 but increased to about 75 TWh/year in 2017, which is equal to half of the ecomically feasible hydroelectric potential of the country. The total installed capacity of hydroelectric power plants was 0.4 GW in 1960 and increased to 27.3 GW in 2017, thus nearly 70 times in\n\n1 Introduction\n\n7\n\n57 years. The economically feasible hydroelectric potential of Turkey is in the order of 150 TWh/year. Turkey anticipates to harness the remaining part of this potential so that several hundreds of major hydroelectric power plants have still to be developed in the near future. The total installed capacity of all types of electricity generating plants in Turkey was around 73 GW in 2015. The total installed capacity of hydroelectric power plants is 26 GW, and its share is in the total power generation is 35%. The water power potential of Turkey is basically harnessed by power plants located at the toe of dams along the middle stretches of the rivers and by high-head diversion plants at the higher stretches of the rivers. The chapter presents several examples of the existing water power schemes in the country, detailing the various structures (dams, conduits, diversions, etc.) involved in the systems in colorful photographs. Urban and industrial water use and management in Turkey is considered in Chap. 11, using available data related to sectoral uses, constraints and a realization of envisaged targets up to the present. Water supply and sanitation sector is discussed on the basis of the existing regulatory system, particularly in relation to the EU legislation as part of Turkey’s accession process to the EU. The sectoral analysis presented in the chapter covers such issues as drinking water production and its use by households and the public sector, industries connected to the public water supply system, self-supplied industries, and pollution generated by municipal and industrial water consumption and its disposal. The ﬁrst part of the chapter focuses on water uses in the urban and industrial sector, water supply and treatment, sewerage, wastewater treatment and disposal. A general description of the existing institutional structure related to water and sewerage administrations in Turkey is covered in the second section. The third part of the book starts with Chap. 12 on transboundary river basins in Turkey. Transboundary and/or boundary-forming rivers contribute about 70 km3/ year or 40% to the gross surface water potential originating in Turkey. Their basins cover an area of 250,000 km2 or roughly one third of the land surface of Turkey. The largest is the Euphrates-Tigris Basin, which represents about four ﬁfths of the water potential of transboundary rivers in Turkey. The rest is contributed by the basins Orontes, Kura-Araks, Chorokhi, Maritza, and a few other quite small basins. The chapter presents detailed information on these basins as to their potential, development, existing water structures, and the amounts of water potential shared by each riparian country. Often, downstream riparian countries are concerned about the development of land and water resources in Turkey as they anticipate decreases in the quantity of waters that ﬂows into their territories in addition to possible deterioration in quality of the water. These concerns are particularly related to the implementation of the Southeastern Anatolia Project in the Euphrates-Tigris Basin, where Turkey is the upstream riparian in both main subbasins. Concerns over water quantity also stem from water scarcity in the Middle East, which is expected to get worse through the impacts of climate change. However, Turkey claims that water resources developments in the country comply with the UN principles of equitable and reasonable use and further that dams in Turkey provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts to\n\n8\n\nN. B. Harmancioglu\n\ndownstream countries, such as ﬂood mitigation, sediment retention, and temporary low ﬂow augmentation. Chapter 13 addresses the issue of river basin management in Turkey. The water community recognized the signiﬁcance of the concept of river basin management only within the last 2 decades. However, as a European Union (EU) candidate country, Turkey has taken signiﬁcant steps towards the implementation of EU norms and requirements on river basin management. Still, there is yet no management plan that is practiced fully in Turkish river basins due to a number of problems. These problems relate basically to institutional structures, water management based on administrative boundaries, insufﬁcient databases, poor monitoring and surveillance, capacity building, and insufﬁcient sanctions and policies. In particular, there is no national Water Law yet ﬁnalized in the country. It still remains at the draft scale. Despite these deﬁciencies, River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) are prepared in accordance with the EU Water Frame Directive (WFD) for 25 river basins in the country to achieve “good status” by 2036 in all water environments. To this end, the previously completed Basin Protection Action Plans (BPAPs) are transformed into RBMPs. Chapter 14 essentially follows Chap. 4 on Climate of Turkey but, this time, focuses on the expected impacts of climate change over the country. The work covers projections of future climate conditions by using regional climate model simulations. To this end, changes in seasonal precipitation climatology, extreme weather conditions, and aridity conditions of Turkey are assessed for the 30 years between 2021 and 2050, based on the reference period of 1971–2000. The majority of geographical regions in Turkey are characterized by semi-arid climate conditions. Only the northeastern and the western parts (some parts) of the Black Sea region appear to be hyper-humid areas. The climate projections realized indicate a strong decrease in precipitation for almost all areas, but an increase in the intensity of drought conditions. Accordingly, more arid conditions are expected in the region for the near future. This means that Turkey will become signiﬁcantly vulnerable to climate change, particularly to increased droughts. Chapter 15 addresses one of the crucial issues in Turkey, i.e. legislation relevant to water resources. Institutional and legal problems have long hindered the proper management of these resources since institutions and legislation have gone through many changes and amendments in time. Laws governing the use and management of water failed to keep up with the increasing water demand and decreasing water supply. At present, the national Water Law is still in draft form, but many new primary and secondary water legislations in the domestic water, irrigation, hydropower, and the environment sectors have been issued. This chapter describes the principal water legislation in Turkey, along with institutional changes that have taken place due to domestic and regional political issues. Turkey’s transboundary water policy is also discussed on the basis of related basic principles and prevailing practices. Sustainability and water security issues considered in Chapter 16 basically complement Chapter 13 on river basin management. Sustainability is a long renowned concept in Turkey, but it is not fully understood as to its linkages with\n\n1 Introduction\n\n9\n\ndevelopmental targets and water management. The same is true for the fundamental basis of water security. The problem has been that every sector, every authority, or every individual evaluated sustainability through his/her own window. Mostly, the term has been associated with efforts on preventing long term adverse effects of development on the environment. In the water sector, this deﬁnition was directly associated with water quality. As noted above, the difﬁculty has been to comprehend the link between sustainability, water resources, and development. Water security is a newer concept in Turkey, and it has been only 4–5 years since water authorities came to recognize it as a requirement. Studies on these issues long remained at academic level, and the early institutional responses were quite slow. The chapter discusses the above problems and presents examples of the few studies carried out on sustainability and water security. The last chapter, Chap. 17, is basically a wrap-up of current problems regarding water resources and management in Turkey and discusses challenges for the future in the light of these problems. It also discloses how water communities in the country react to these challenges and plan new targets for the future. The most challenging issue appears to be water scarcity resulting from fast increases in population, urbanization, industrialization, agriculture, expansion of tourism, and increases in economic activities, and resource depletion. Turkey is also an interesting example as a developing country that tries to adapt to universal water management strategies but with legal, institutional, economic and capacity development problems. The country has long remained as a water-rich country but the situation is now reversed to problems of water scarcity due to increasing population, inefﬁcient use of the resource, impacts of climate change and environmental degradation. In Turkey, no book has been published as yet to cover all aspects of water resources in the country, related problems, and water management issues as comprehensive as this volume. Thus, the presented work will be, in a way, a useful “handbook” or a guide for all members of water communities in the country, including authorities, institutions, water users, academicians, and all other professionals. It is believed that the international water community will also welcome this volume as it demonstrates a multifaceted example of water developments and associated problems in a typical developing country. Information and lessons derived from this example will be useful for basins and their management problems in other countries. In particular, Turkey’s unique geographical position linking Europe and Asia and the presence of signiﬁcant transboundary river basins will be important factors in arousing international interest in the volume.\n\nChapter 2\n\nWater Works of Ancient Civilizations Unal Ozis, Ahmet Alkan, and Yalcin Ozdemir\n\nAbstract Turkey is renowned for her outstanding remnants of ancient water works and is thus one of the foremost open-air museums of the world with regard to hydraulic structures in the world. Numerous ancient water works from a fourmillenia-long period are still in operation after several centuries or even several millennia. These historical works are rich in kind to encompass dams, irrigation canals, masonry conduits, aqueduct-bridges, tunnels, water collection works, water conveyance systems, pipes, inverted siphons and water mills. Geographically, they extend all over the country, indicating the various civilizations who realized them. They date back to the second millenium BC, the Hittite civilization in Central Anatolia; to the ﬁrst half of the ﬁrst millenium BC, the Urartu civilization in Eastern Anatolia; to the second half of the ﬁrst millenium BC and the ﬁrst millenium AD, the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine civilizations in Western and Southern Anatolia; to the eleventh up to the fourteenth centuries, the Seljukide civilization in Central and Eastern Anatolia; to the fourteenth up to the early twentieth centuries, the Ottoman civilization in Turkey. Some of these ancient water works were given as interesting examples in relevant books; several of them were dealt with more detail in other speciﬁc publications, journals and proceedings.

They date back to the second millenium BC, the Hittite civilization in Central Anatolia; to the ﬁrst half of the ﬁrst millenium BC, the Urartu civilization in Eastern Anatolia; to the second half of the ﬁrst millenium BC and the ﬁrst millenium AD, the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine civilizations in Western and Southern Anatolia; to the eleventh up to the fourteenth centuries, the Seljukide civilization in Central and Eastern Anatolia; and to the fourteenth up to the early twentieth centuries, the Ottoman civilization in Turkey (Ozis and Benzeden 1977; Ozis 1981b, 1984a, 1994a, b, c, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2015a, b, 2017; Bildirici 1994, 2004; Buyukyildirim 1994a, 2017; Ozis et al. 2006, 2009, 2014a; DSI 2008; Unutmaz 2013, Baykan and Baykan 2015). Some of these ancient water works were presented as interesting examples in relevant international books (Garbrecht 1985, 1987a, 1991, 1995; Fahlbusch 1987a; Tolle-Kastenbein 1990; Hodge 1992; Grewe 1998, 2010a; Viollet 2000; Crouch 2004; Wiplinger 2006a, 2013a, 2014, 2016; Nikolic 2008; Mays 2010; IWA 2012; Wiplinger and Letzner 2018). Several of them were dealt with more detail in other international speciﬁc publications, journals, and proceedings, as cited in the subsequent sections. This chapter summarizes the principal sites and main features of ancient water works in Turkey. Further details can be found in more speciﬁc literature given in the lengthy list of references at the end of the chapter.\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n2.2 2.2.1\n\n13\n\nHittite Water Works Dams\n\nThe most ancient hydraulic works in Turkey date back to the second millenium BC, remaining from the Hittite civilization in Central Anatolia. Certain indices indicate that some wells and canals may even date back to the sixth millenium BC (Emre 1993; Bildirici 1994, 2004; Ozis 1994a, 1999; Cinaroglu 2007; DSI 2008; Inal 2009; Grewe 2010b; Strobel 2013). The 8 m high Karakuyu dam in Uzunyayla, with a total crest length of 400 m, is a remarkable example. The restituted Golpinar dam near Alacahoyuk is thus the most ancient dam actually in use. Eﬂatunpinar dam near Beysehir lake, Koylutolu and Yalburt dams near Ilgin, and Guneykale dam near Bogazkale are other dam remains from the Hittite Period.\n\n2.2.2\n\nWater Supply\n\nThe spring-water collection chamber in Hattusha (Bogazkale) (Fig. 2.2), formed by rubble stones, has an almost triangular cross-section of about 1.4 m width and 2.6 m height (Neve 1969/70). Fig. 2.2 The springwater collection chamber in the Hittite capital Hattusha (Bogazkale). (Photo by U. Ozis)\n\n14\n\nU. Ozis et al.\n\n2.2.3\n\nIrrigation\n\nThere are remains of several water conduits in ancient Hittite settlements and irrigation systems in Central Anatolia (Bildirici 1994, 2004; Bildirici and Bildirici 1996; DSI 2008).\n\n2.3\n\nUrartu Water Works\n\n2.3.1\n\nDams\n\nThere are several small dams from the ﬁrst half of the ﬁrst millenium BC, belonging to the Urartu civilization in Eastern Anatolia. These are located mostly on various watercourses ﬂowing to Lake Van. Some of them, like the 7 m high dam raising the level of the Kesis Lake and those on Doni creek, are still in use. Kircagol dam near Adilcevaz, Suphan and Argit dams near Muradiye, and several small dams between Van and Hakkari are other remains (Garbrecht 1987a; Belli 1996; Ozis 1999; Bildirici 2004; DSI 2008; Hepbostanci et al. 2015).\n\n2.3.2\n\nWater Supply & Irrigation\n\n2.3.2.1\n\nSamram Canal\n\nThe 56 km long Samram canal (Fig. 2.3) supplied the Urartu capital Tushpa (Vankale). This canal dates back to 800 BC and is one of the oldest canals still in use. The Samram canal irrigates, with very few modiﬁcations, about 2000 ha of land (Ogun 1970; Burney 1972; Garbrecht 1975; Ozis 1994a; Belli 1997; Bildirici 2004; DSI 2008; Grewe 2010b; Hepbostanci et al. 2015).\n\n2.3.2.2\n\nFerhat Canal\n\nRemains of the Ferhat canal, conveying water from Lake Balikli towards the western edge of the Igdir plain, and some other irrigation systems in the Van area, might also date back to the Urartu period (Bildirici 2004; DSI 2008).\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n15\n\nFig. 2.3 The Samram Canal near the Urartu capital Tushpa (Van). (Photo by U.Ozis)\n\n2.3.2.3\n\nQanats Near Van\n\nSome of the underground water conduits of Van, still partly in use, might also date back to this period and can be considered as predecessors of the later qanats. Certain cisterns in this region appear to be of Urartu origin (Bildirici 2004; DSI 2008).\n\n2.4\n\nHellenistic, Roman and Byzantine Water Works\n\n2.4.1\n\nWater Supply & Conveyance Schemes\n\n2.4.1.1\n\nGeneral Remarks\n\nLong-distance water supply schemes in Western and Southern Turkey, from the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine civilizations, date back to the second half of the ﬁrst millenium BC and the ﬁrst half of the ﬁrst millenium AD. The long-distance water conveyances in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions of Turkey are very numerous and new discoveries add to the rich variety of them (Weber 1904, 1905; Ozis 1981b, 1994a, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2015a, b; Fahlbusch 1982, 1987a; Garbrecht 1985, 1995; Tolle-Kastenbein 1990; Hodge 1992; Buyukyildirim 1994a; Cecen 1996a, b; Grewe 1998, 2010a, 2014; Viollet 2000; Wiplinger 2006a, 2013a, 2016; Ozis et al. 2007, 2009, 2014a, 2018a; DSI 2008; Turk et al. 2010; IWA 2012; Baykan and Baykan 2015).\n\n16\n\nU. Ozis et al.\n\nThese systems include spring-water collection chambers; lead-, stone-, clay-pipes of various sizes; rock-cut and masonry canals; tunnels of over 2 m height; inverted siphons under up to 190 m water pressure with lead-pipes and to 155 m water pressure with stone-pipes; and aqueduct-bridges of up to 40 m height. The water conveyance to Constantinopolis (Istanbul) with a length of 242 km is the longest Roman water conveyance in the world, and that to Phoceia (Foca) with 100 km length ranks among the longest Roman conveyance systems. The multiple water conveyance systems to Pergamon (Bergama), Smyrna (Izmir), and to Ephesus (Efes) make these cities, besides Rome, Lyon and few others, among the most interesting examples of multiple urban water supply schemes in the antique world. The water conveyance systems to Perge, Hierapolis, Tralleis, Antiochia/Orontes are other, somewhat shorter multiple water conveyance systems in Anatolia. The lead-pipe inverted siphon of the Madradag water conveyance to Pergamon resists up to 190 m water pressure, and the 3.3 km long stone-pipe inverted siphon of the Karapinar water conveyance to Smyrna resists up to 155 m water pressure. These were siphons operating under respective largest pressures in the antique world, dating back to the late centuries of the ﬁrst millenium BC, the Hellenistic period. With a length of about 1.7 km, the stone-pipe inverted siphon of Aspendos is the longest one on arches in Turkey. The ruined aqueduct-bridge over Karkassos (Ilyas), a tributary of Kaikos (Bakircay), on the Soma conveyance to Pergamon, had probably a height of 40 m, being the second highest Roman aqueduct after the Pont-du-Gard of Nîmes. Various important sites are summarized below in an approximately counterclockwise geographical sequence.\n\n2.4.1.2\n\nConstantinopolis (Istanbul)\n\nThis city served as the capital of three empires in the course of 16 centuries: of the Roman Empire from 330 to 395, of the Byzantine Empire from the year 395 to 1453, and of the Ottoman Empire from 1453 to 1922. Istanbul was supplied by water during the Roman and early Byzantine times through important long-distance conveyance systems (Forchheimer 1890; Forchheimer and Strzygowski 1893; Dalman 1933; Eyice 1979; Fahlbusch 1982; ISKI 1983; Tolle-Kastenbein 1990; Cecen 1994, 1996a, b; Ozis 1987, 1994a, 1995, 1996, 2001; Unutmaz 2013; Ozis et al. 2018a). These systems were heavily damaged in the course of numerous sieges of the city, during the second half of the ﬁrst millenium and the ﬁrst half of the second millenium, until her fall in 1453 to the Ottoman Empire. The ﬁrst major water conveyance system to Istanbul dates probably back to the Roman emperor Hadrian’s time (117–138 AD). The remains of a water conduit, found roughly 220 m south of the Mihrimah Mosque in Edirnekapi, indicate that this\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n17\n\nFig. 2.4 Valens (Bozdogan) Aqueduct-bridge in Constantinople (Istanbul). (Photo by U.Ozis)\n\nconduit transported water from the westwards Halkali area to the city. The conveyance continued over the 23 m high and 970 m long Bozdogan aqueduct-bridge (Fig. 2.4), which has been earlier called as the Hadrian aqueduct-bridge. It is later called Valens-aqueduct-bridge, who reigned during 364–378 AD and thoroughly repaired it in the context of the very long water conveyance from Thrace. The 242 km long water conveyance system to Istanbul, along the southwestern slopes of the Istranca mountains in Thrace, was constructed for the new capital of the late Roman Empire in the fourth century AD, when emperor Constantinus I shifted the capital from Rome to Istanbul in 330 AD. This was by far the longest water conveyance system of ancient times (Cecen 1996a, b). The conveyance passes over 40 aqueduct-bridges, whereby the 33 m high Kursunlugerme is the highest. Two aqueduct-bridges of this system, the already mentioned Bozdogan and the 19 m high and 110 m long Mazul, were later used by several Ottoman systems (some of the Halkali water conveyances, including the Suleymaniye water conveyance built by the great Architect Sinan in the sixteenth century). A long-distance water conveyance from the north, the Belgrade Forest area close to the Blacksea, date probably back to the reign of Valens or of Theodosius I, the latter of whom reigned in the period of 379–395 AD, being the last emperor of the entire empire before the split in 395 AD. This conveyance was laid at an altitude signiﬁcantly higher than that of the later Ottoman Kirkcesme water conveyance to Istanbul, which is one of the masterworks of the Architect Sinan in the middle of the sixteenth century. Only the lowest row (four arches) of the three-storey Egri (Kovuk) aqueduct-bridge, with a broken alignment, might belong to another Roman system.\n\n2.4.1.3\n\nParion (Kemerkoy)\n\nA ruined aqueduct-bridge, along with various baked clay and marmor pipe elements, exist at the ancient city of Parion on the southern shore of the Marmara Sea, near the village Kemerkoy northwest of Biga. It is presumed that water was conveyed from the vicinity of the village Cataltepe, southwest of Kemerkoy, so that the length of the water conveyance may be estimated to be in the order of 20 km (Wiplinger 2016).\n\n18\n\n2.4.1.4\n\nU. Ozis et al.\n\nTroia – Ilion (Truva)\n\nA water conveyance of probably 25 km length brought the water of the springs near the village of Camlica to Troia-Illion (Truva), located to the east of the city. The most interesting element of this conveyance is the aqueduct-bridge at the village of Kemerkoy, with an arch of 16 m span width, located 27.5 m higher than the creek underneath (Kayan 2000; Aylward et al. 2002; Wiplinger 2006a; Unutmaz 2013; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.5\n\nPergamon (Bergama)\n\nPergamon was supplied by several long-distance water conveyances dating back to Hellenistic and Roman periods, from the north-western Selinus (Bergama) valley, from the northern Madradag area, and from the eastern Kaikos (Bakircay) basin (Garbrecht and Holtorff 1973; Garbrecht and Fahlbusch 1975, 1978; Fahlbusch 1982, 1987a, e; Hecht 1975, 1976, 1978, 1979, 1983; Garbrecht 1976, 1985, 1987b, 1995; Tolle-Kastenbein 1990; Ozis 1994a, 1995, 1996; Grewe 1998; Viollet 2000; Nikolic 2008; Mays 2010; Alkan et al. 2014; Ozis et al. 2018a). The 44 km long Madradag water conveyance system, consisting of three baked clay pipe conduits, crossed the last valley by means of a lead pipe inverted siphon under a maximal water pressure of 190 m, the highest pressure in antiquity, to reach the Akropolis area. This system was later replaced by a masonry conduit in the Roman period and crossed the same valley over an arched aqueduct-bridge (Fig. 2.5), to supply the blooming middle-level part of Pergamon. Also in Roman times, a 53 km long conveyance brought the water of Turgutalp springs, located to the east of Pergamon in the Kaikos (Bakircay) river valley, through six tunnel stretches and over 40 aqueducts-bridges. The completely ruined aqueduct-bridge over the Karkassos (Ilyas) tributary likely had a length of 550 m and a height of 40 m. This conveyance is later extended by 10 km eastwards in order to harness the water of the Aksu springs.\n\nFig. 2.5 The Roman Aqueduct-bridge of the Madradag Water Conveyance crossing the last valley before Pergamon. (Photo by U.Ozis)\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n19\n\nFig. 2.6 Rock-cut canal of the water conveyance to Phocea. (Photo by U.Ozis)\n\n2.4.1.6\n\nPhoceia (Foca)\n\nThe roughly 100 km long water conveyance to Phocea was most likely fed from the Goksu springs near Manisa. It has an alignment similar to the modern ﬁrst stage water supply project of Izmir along its ﬁrst 19 km. The alignment is quite close to that of the modern Menemen right bank irrigation canal for the next 48 km. It follows most probably with a gentle gradient the contour lines along the coastal slopes for the last 33 km in order to reach Phocea (Ozis 1994a, 1995, 1996; DSI 2008; Wiplinger 2016; Ozis et al. 2018a). The conduit displays stretches of open channels (Fig. 2.6), simple horse-shoe shaped masonry galleries, rock-cut canals, and rock-cut tunnels. The bottom widths are in the order of 0.4–0.7 m, and the longitudinal slopes vary between 0.15 and 0.3‰. Remains of any signiﬁcant aqueduct-bridges have not been encountered.\n\n2.4.1.7\n\nSardis (Sart)\n\nThe almost 16 km long water conveyance system to Sardis was fed from the Kocapinar springs issuing on the slopes of Bozdag to the south of the city. Another spring is connected at km 6. The conveyance includes stretches of masonry galleries, tunnels, clay pipes, and small aqueduct-bridges up to 8 m height. The conduit bifurcates in Teknetas at km 10; one branch reaches the Artemis temple after 1.5 km, and the other continues for 5 km until it reaches the baths and the gymnasium (DSI 2008; Wiplinger 2016; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n20\n\nU. Ozis et al.\n\nFig. 2.7 Aqueduct-bridges over the Melas (Melez) creek in Izmir. (Photo by Y.Ozdemir)\n\n2.4.1.8\n\nSmyrna (Izmir)\n\nThe 30 km long Karapinar water conveyance from the east is the longest of the seven water conveyance systems supplying Izmir in the past (Weber 1899; Fahlbusch 1982; Tolle-Kastenbein 1990; Hodge 1992; Ozis 1994a, 1995, 1996; Ozis et al. 1999, 2018a; DSI 2008; Nikolic 2008; Pinar 2011; Unutmaz 2013; Alkan et al. 2014; Wiplinger 2016). This clay pipe conduit may date back to the Hellenistic period. It includes a 3.3 km long stone-pipe inverted siphon crossing the Melas (Melez) river under a remarkable water pressure of 155 m. The 27 km long Akpinar water conveyance from the south is the second longest one and may date back to the Roman period. The conduit is basically a covered masonry canal, crossing the small creeks along the alignment over heavily damaged modest aqueduct-bridges. The probably 20 km long conveyance from the vicinity of Buca in the southwest crosses the Melas (Melez) river by means of two aqueduct-bridges (Fig. 2.7). The downstream one with masonry channel is 21 m high and dates probably back to the Roman period. The other aqueduct-bridge, roughly 100 m upstream of it, with a conduit of clay pipes, appear to be constructed later as a bypass to the former one and dates probably back to Byzantine or Ottoman periods.\n\n2.4.1.9\n\nMetropolis (Yenikoy)\n\nMetropolis (Yenikoy) was supplied by a 21 km long water conveyance which carried the water of a spring northwest of the city. The elevation of the spring limited the water supply to only the lower half of the city. The conduit is a masonry channel and crosses a valley over an aqueduct-bridge (Weber 1904; DSI 2008; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n2.4.1.10\n\n21\n\nEphesus (Efes)\n\nEphesus was supplied by at least four water conveyances in antiquity: the 8 km long Selenus (Sirince) system from the east; the 7 km long Marnas (Derbentdere) system from the southeast; the 37 km long Kenchrios (Degirmendere) system from the south; and the 42 km long Kaystros (Kayapinar) system from the northeast (Forchheimer 1923; Wilberg 1923; Ozis and Harmancioglu 1980; Fahlbusch 1982; Alzinger 1987; Tolle-Kastenbein 1990; Hodge 1992; Ozis 1994a, 1995, 1996; Ozis and Atalay 1999; Ozis et al. 1998, 2005a, b, 2014b, 2018a; Ortloff and Crouch 2001; Crouch 2004; Wiplinger 2006a, b, 2008, 2010, 2013b, c, 2016; DSI 2008; IWA 2012; Unutmaz 2013; Alkan et al. 2014). The Sirince conveyance, fed by groundwater collected near the village, supplied water to the area around the Artemis temple and may date back to the ﬁfth century BC. The main conduit consists of conical baked clay pipes and ends with lead pipes under the altar of the temple, joined by marmor elements. This conveyance was probably diverted to the Ayasuluk hill in Selcuk in the sixth century AD, over the 625 m long Selcuk aqueduct-bridge of up to 15 m height, and served as the venter of a stone-pipe inverted siphon. The remains of water-balance towers parallel to this aqueduct-bridge are elements of a baked clay pipe conduit supplying the fourteenth century Isabey mosque and baths in its vicinity. The Derbentdere system displays several baked clay pipe conduits, which probably had been subject to various repairs and bypasses. The system lay partly on rockcut terraces and reaches the castellum near the Magnesia gate of Ephesus. The conveyance passes over the 15 m high two-storey Sextilius Pollio aqueduct-bridge (Fig. 2.8), replacing probably a clay- or stone-pipe inverted siphon. It then extends over two smaller, single-arch aqueduct-bridges (Becerik I & II). The Degirmendere water conveyance carries the water of the Degirmendere and Keltepe springs by means of a cut-and-cover masonry conduit, passes through half a dozen tunnels, crosses the creeks by two dozens aqueduct-bridges, and reaches Ephesus at the southwestern hill slopes. The longest aqueduct-bridge was Arvalya with 400 m and the longest tunnel Atalay with 815 m. The system was initially constructed in Hadrian’s time, early decades of the second century AD. However, an earthquake in the year 159 AD caused a sink of 3 m at the fault by km 18 and disrupted the function of the conveyance. A second larger and almost parallel channel had to be built in order to reach the city. This conveyance, with almost parallel aqueduct-bridges, was established during the later decades of the second century and reached Ephesus at an 8 m higher elevation. The Kayapinar conveyance carried the springwater of the village Kursak near Belevi to Ephesus, receiving also the water of the Pranga springs at km 23. The conduit is basically a cut-and-cover masonry channel, crossing the creeks over small aqueduct-bridges. It reaches the antique stadium at km 40, passes then under the central seat row of the theater’s upper tier, and dicharges into the Traian fountain, constructed in 114 AD by Claudius Aristion. The conduit continues under the marble road and supplies water also to the slope-houses quarter.\n\n22\n\nU. Ozis et al.\n\nFig. 2.8 The Sextilius Pollio Aqueduct-bridge on the Derbentdere Water Conveyance to Ephesus. (Photo by U.Ozis)\n\n2.4.1.11\n\nMagnesia/Meandros (Ortaklar)\n\nThree relatively short water conveyances supplied water to Magnesia ad Meandros. The 7.5 km long Naipli conveyance from the northwest passes over the almost 1 km long Ortaklar aqueduct-bridge. The 6 km long Tekinkoy conveyance from the north consists mainly of a masonry channel. The 8 km long Arguvanli conveyance consists of baked clay pipes (Baykan et al. 2001a; DSI 2008; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.12\n\nTralleis (Aydin)\n\nThe northwestern branch of the Tralleis water conveyance extends from the Caykavustugu springs to the Taskemer aqueduct-bridge and is 8.6 km long. The northern branch from the Olmez spring to the same bridge is 2.5 km long. The conveyance continues for 4.5 km to reach the Kizlarkulesi tower. A third, northeastern branch from the Kocabag spring to the same tower is 10.4 km long. The ﬁnal stretch, from the tower to the Ucgozler aqueduct-bridge in Tralleis, is 1.5 km long (Weber 1904; Wiplinger 2006a; DSI 2008; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.13\n\nNysa (Sultanhisar)\n\nRemains of an eventual diversion work and of some aqueduct-bridges led to the assumption that water was brought to Nysa, near Sultanhisar, from the Tekkecik (Malkoc) creek, 1 km to the north. Moreover, a very interesting water reservoir exists\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n23\n\nto the north of the city, covering an area of 40 m 50 m (Ozis 1984a, 1994a). More recent investigations indicated a 5.5 km long water conveyance from Malgacemir area in the north, consisting of clay pipes (DSI 2008). Baked clay pipes for water distribution were also found in the city.\n\n2.4.1.14\n\nTripolis (Yenicekent)\n\nThe 22 km long water conveyance carried the water of the Karsipinar spring, in the northeast, to Tripolis between Buldan and Yenicekent. The interesting springwater collection work still serves to supply water to the city Guney (DSI 2008; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.15\n\nEumenia (Isikli)\n\nA roughly 6 km long conveyance carried the water of Ortadag springs from the north to Eumenia, at the village Isikli of the county Civril. The conduit consists of baked clay pipes. The remains of a water tower exist in Eumenia (DSI 2008).\n\n2.4.1.16\n\nHierapolis (Pamukkale)\n\nThree relatively short water conveyances supplied Hierapolis: the 5.4 km long Karahayit conveyance from the north, the 6.4 km long Kocapinar conveyance from the northeast, and the 4.8 km long Mustak conveyance from the east (Weber 1904; Ozis and Harmancioglu 1980; Fahlbusch 1982; Ozis 1994a, 1995, 1996; Baykan 1999; Baykan et al. 2001b; Wiplinger 2006a; DSI 2008; Grewe 2014; Ozis et al. 2018a). Remains of masonry channels and aqueduct-bridges indicate that the Karahayit conveyance dates back to the Roman period. Remains of baked clay pipes are encountered elsewhere. The most interesting water work is the water reservoir (Fig. 2.9), a ‘castellum aquae’ close to the city, with 11 12 m inner area and roughly 2.5 m height.\n\n2.4.1.17\n\nLaodicea (Eskihisar)\n\nWater was brought to Laodicea by a 7 km long conveyance system from Baspinar springs, located southwards near Denizli. The initial conduit consisted of two parallel rows of baked clay pipes, dating back to the Hellenistic period. Later, in the Roman period, it was replaced by a masonry channel which extended partly over aqueduct-bridges, reaching the stone-pipe inverted siphon (Weber 1898; Ozis 1994a; Baykan 1999; Baykan et al. 2001b; Wiplinger 2006a; DSI 2008; Unutmaz 2013).\n\n24\n\nU. Ozis et al.\n\nFig. 2.9 Water reservoir at Hierapolis. (Photo by U.Ozis)\n\nThe inverted siphon is 820 m long, crosses the 40 m deep valley by two parallel rows of stone blocks (Fig. 2.10) and reaches the city’s ﬁrst distribution tower. From this tower, which has an actual height of around 5 m, but which probably had a height of 8–9 m, water was conveyed for 430 m to a second distribution chamber to supply other parts of the city. The archeological excavation team under the leadership of Celal Simsek discovered in 2015 at Laodicea a water-related inscription from 114 AD, reﬂecting the ancient regulations of water use in the city.\n\n2.4.1.18\n\nAttuda (Hisarkoy) and Trapezopolis (Bekirler)\n\nA roughly 5 km long conveyance from the southwest supplied Attuda, at Hisarkoy near Babadag, with the water of the Ikizce spring. A roughly 10 km long conveyance from the south supplied Trapezopolis, at Bekirler near Babadag, with the water of the springs on western slopes of the Salnakos mountain. The conduits consisted probably of baked clay pipes in both cases (Weber 1904; DSI 2008).\n\n2.4.1.19\n\nSebastapolis (Kizilca)\n\nA roughly 6 km long conveyance from the northeast supplied Sebastapolis, near Kizilca to the southeast of Tavas, with the water of the Caylak spring (DSI 2008).\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n25\n\nFig. 2.10 Stone-pipe inverted Siphon of the water conveyance to Laodicea. (Photo by U.Ozis)\n\n2.4.1.20\n\nAphrodisias (Geyre)\n\nSeveral water conveyance systems supplied Aphrodisias in ancient times (Weber 1904; Ozis 1994a; DSI 2008; Commito and Rojas 2010; Wiplinger 2016; Ozis et al. 2018a). The 25 km long Timeles (Yenidere) system from the southeast carries the water of two springs near the Guzelkoy village, located in the adjacent Tavas closed basin. The conduit is basically a cut-and-cover masonry channel (Fig. 2.11), passing through tunnels of several km length before the villlage Karapinar. The springs and the initial part of the conveyance is actually submerged in the reservoir of the Yenidere dam. A 10 km long water conveyance from the north carried the water of a spring, located near the village Isiklar, to Aphrodisias. There are traces of a probably 9 km long water conveyance near the village Seki. An aqueduct-bridge of this conveyance was used as a bridge in Ottoman times.\n\n2.4.1.21\n\nAlinda (Karpuzlu)\n\nAn up to 7 m high and roughly 85 m long aqueduct-bridge (Fig. 2.12) crosses the last valley before Alinda near Karpuzlu. Parts of a canal formed by stone plates are still in situ on top of this bridge. Remains of a ruined masonry canal exist southwest of the bridge. A 12 km long water conveyance, with baked clay pipes, carry water from of a spring located to the northeast of the city towards the aqueduct (DSI 2008; Grewe 2014; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n26\n\nU. Ozis et al.\n\nFig. 2.11 Remains of the Timeles water conveyance to Aphrodisias. (Photo by A.Alkan)\n\n2.4.1.22\n\nAlabanda (Doganyurt)\n\nAlabanda was supplied with water by an at least 22 km long conveyance system from the south (Ozis et al. 1979a, 2018a; Ozis 1991, 1994a, 1995, 1996; DSI 2008). The conveyance was fed from ﬁve springwater collection chambers (Fig. 2.13) at hill slopes along the left bank of Cine river. The conduit is basically a masonry channel with rock-cut stretches, passes over seven aqueduct-bridges, and ends in the city’s water reservoir, which is actually totally silted. About 5 km further to the south of the ﬁrst water collection chamber is the Incekemer aqueduct-bridge over the river Cine, which served as a ‘venter’ for a stone-pipe inverted siphon. Road construction activities left no trace of any water conveyance between these two locations. Remains of a much smaller inverted siphon were found on a creek at the right bank of Cine river. Initially, it was believed that Incekemer belonged to another water conveyance in the direction of Gerga on the right bank. However, the large elevation difference between Incekemer and the several hundred meters higher Gerga led later to the assumption that Incekemer should belong to a conveyance to Alabanda to eventually constitute an upstream element of the actual system, increasing its length to about 30 km. This part is actually submerged in the reservoir of Cine Adnan-Menderes dam.\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n27\n\nFig. 2.12 The last Aqueduct-bridge of the water conveyance to Alinda.

Ozis)\n\n2.4.1.23\n\nPriene (Gullubahce)\n\nThe water of the springs on hill slopes to the north of the city is carried to two locations of Priene. The conveyance consists of baked clay pipes, laid on the ground or in masonry canals. The conveyance bifurcates after 125 m: a 290 m long branch discharges in the water reservoir at the acropolis northwest of Priene, and the other 1140 m long branch into water reservoirs to the east of the city (Crouch 1993, 1996,\n\n28\n\nU. Ozis et al.\n\n2004; Ozis 1994a, 1995, 1996; Crouch et al. 1997; Ortloff and Crouch 1998; Alkan et al. 1999; Wiplinger 2006a; DSI 2008).\n\n2.4.1.24\n\nMiletus (Balat)\n\nThe roughly 4 km long conveyance carried water from the spring at the StefaniaPlateau to the south between the villages Akkoy and Yenikoy. It supplied the nympheum and the northeastern part of Miletus. The conduit consists of baked clay pipes at the beginning, then continues as a masonry channel, and reaches the nympheum with an aqueduct-bridge, of which only two arches remain. The almost 2 km long other conveyance carried water from the spring at the Jeralex area in the south between Balat and Akkoy, reached the Holy Gate, and supplied the smaller southwestern part of Miletus (Ozis 1994a; Tuttahs 1998, 2001, 2007; Crouch 2004; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.25\n\nIasos (Gulluk)\n\nThe remains of an almost 490 m long aqueduct-bridge exist in Iasos (Fig. 2.14). It begins near a well, and it is assumed that water was taken out from this well and heightened at least 3 m to supply the conveyance system. Furthermore, there are several clay pipe lines and masonry canals in the city (Tomasello 1991; Ozis 1994a; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.26\n\nMylasa (Milas)\n\nThe 7.4 km long water conveyance from the northeast was fed from a spring near the creek Saricay. It passes over six modest aqueduct-bridges upstream of the Akgedik dam and reaches Mylasa on a highly interesting, but partly damaged, 2.3 km long, so far the longest aqueduct-bridge in Turkey (Fig. 2.15) (DSI 2008; Mays 2010; Alkan 2015; Wiplinger 2016; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.27\n\nKeramos (Oren)\n\nThe roughly 6 km long water conveyance from the northeast carried the water of ﬁve springs to Keramos at northern shore of the Gokova bay. One of these springs, Sucikan, still supplies Oren. The conduit passes over several partly ruined aqueductbridges, discharges into pools, which might have served as silting basins, and then to a cistern (Wiplinger 2006a; DSI 2008; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n29\n\nFig. 2.14 The Aqueduct-bridge in Iasos. (Phot by U.Ozis)\n\nFig. 2.15 The 2.3 km long Aqueduct-bridge in Mylasa. (Photo by A.Alkan)\n\n2.4.1.28\n\nKnidos (Datca)\n\nA roughly 7 km long conveyance carried the water of the springs in cape Kalamis, from the east to Knidos at the western end of the Datca peninsula between the Gokova and the Hisaronu bays. The conduit consisted of baked clay pipes (DSI 2008).\n\n30\n\n2.4.1.29\n\nU. Ozis et al.\n\nKibyra (Golhisar) and Oenoanda (Incealiler)\n\nThe water conveyance system to Kibyra near Golhisar is 2.3 km long and includes a 400 m long stone-pipe inverted siphon. The water conveyance system to Oenoanda, near Incealiler, is 3.5 km long and includes a 500 m long stone-pipe inverted siphon (Stenton and Coulton 1986; Coulton 1987; Baykan and Cantilav 1997; DSI 2008; Turk et al. 2010; Alkan et al. 2014). These two antique cities, together with Bubon and Balbura in between, formed the Kibyratis Union.\n\n2.4.1.30\n\nXanthos (Kinik)\n\nThe water of the Inpinar spring was brought to Xanthos near Kinik by a roughly 9 km long conveyance from the east. The conduit is basically a masonry channel, rock-cut at some stretches, and passes over modest aqueduct-bridges (Buyukyildirim 1994a; Burdy and Lebouteiller 1998; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.31\n\nPatara (Gelemis)\n\nThe 22 km long conveyance carries the water of the Islamlar spring from the northeast. The conduit is basically a masonry channel with some rock-cut stretches and even displays a baked clay pipe stretch. It passes over several modest aqueductbridges and through an interesting stone-pipe inverted siphon. The length of the siphon is about 500 m and that of the masonry venter 190 m, curved in alignment and in elevation; stone pipes are under a maximal water pressure of about 20 m (Buyukyildirim 1994a; Ozis 1994a, 1995, 1996; Baykan et al. 1997; Baykan and Iskan 2011; Iskan and Baykan 2013; Unutmaz 2013; Sahin 2016; Wiplinger 2016; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.32\n\nPinara (Minare)\n\nA roughly 7 km long water conveyance from the west brought the water of the spring Ericek to the upper part of Pinara near the village Minare southwest of Fethiye. A shorter conveyance from the south brought the water of the spring Muargoz to the lower part of the city (DSI 2008; Turk et al. 2010).\n\n2.4.1.33\n\nArykanda (Arif)\n\nAn almost 4 km long conveyance from the northwest carried the water of Baskoz springs to Arykanda, near the Arif village north of Finike. The conduit was mainly a rock-cut channel along the mountain slopes. A short conveyance from the southeast\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n31\n\ncarrying the water of the Badil spring also supplied the city (Buyukyildirim 1994a; DSI 2008; Turk et al. 2010).\n\n2.4.1.34\n\nPhaselis (Tekirova)\n\nA long, partly damaged aqueduct-bridge (Fig. 2.16) exists in Phaselis near Tekirova. It appears probable that an almost 10 km long conveyance from the north brought the water of a spring at the hill slopes (Buyukyildirim 1994a; Kurkcu 2015b; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.35\n\nPerge (Aksu)\n\nBesides some cisterns and ﬁve springwater collection works close to the city, water was brought to Perge by two conveyance systems of large capacities (Fahlbusch 1987c; Baykan and Dag 1994; Buyukyildirim 1994a, 1997; Ozis 1994a, 1995, 1996; Ozis et al. 2018a). The 11 km long conveyance from the north carried the water of the Gelindusen spring, 2.5 km to the north of the Kursunlu waterfall, to supply Perge. The conduit is partly rock-cut and partly cut-and-cover masonry gallery. It passes over a few aqueduct-bridges, such as the 11 m high Egridere and 16 m high Ahmetali. The 22 km long conveyance from the northwest carried the water of Dudenbasi springs, which originate, in turn, from the karstic Kirkgozler springs. The conduit begins as a tunnel, then continues as a masonry channel, and passes over some aqueduct-bridges, like the 10 m high Sogucaksu.\n\nFig. 2.16 The Aqueduct-bridge in Phaselis. (Photo by U.Ozis)\n\n32\n\n2.4.1.36\n\nU. Ozis et al.\n\nSelge (Zerk)\n\nThe ancient city Selge (Zerk), located in the mountainous upper Koprucay basin, northwest of Beskonak, was supplied by two rather short water conveyances. The 5 km long conveyance from northwest passes over a 10 m high, partly damaged aqueduct-bridge; the conduit consists of a stone plate canal on the ground, but a baked clay pipe conduit exists in the ground underneath. The 6 km long conveyance from southwest consists of semi-cylindrical or U-shaped baked clay elements (Buyukyildirim 1994a, b; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.37\n\nAspendos (Belkis)\n\nThe 17 km long water conveyance to Aspendos is fed by springwater and crosses the Koprucay valley, the last one before the city, by a 1.7 km long stone-pipe inverted siphon (Fig. 2.17) (Ward-Perkins 1955; Garbrecht 1977; Ozis and Harmancioglu 1980; Fahlbusch 1982, 1987a, b; Garbrecht 1985, 1995; Tolle-Kastenbein 1990; Hodge 1992; Buyukyildirim 1994a; Ozis 1994a, 1995, 1996; Kessener and Piras 1997; Grewe 1998, 2014; Kessener 2001; Piras 2001; Ortloff and Kassinos 2003; Nikolic 2008; Unutmaz 2013; Alkan et al. 2014; Wiplinger 2016; Ozis et al. 2018a). The venter of the inverted siphon is an up to 18 m high aqueduct-bridge and displays two partly damaged water balance towers, which probably had 38 m and 30 m heights. This structure can be considered as three consecutive inverted siphons. The length of the upstream part between the inlet surge chamber and the upstream tower is about 600 m; the length of the middle part between the two towers 950 m; and the length of the downstream part, between the second tower and the outlet\n\nFig. 2.17 The Stone-pipe inverted Siphon of Aspendos, on Arched bridge as Venter. (Photo by U. Ozis)\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n33\n\nchamber is 150 m. The alignment of the aqueduct-bridge displays two changes of direction, 16 at the ﬁrst tower and 55 at the second one. The hydraulic capacity of the siphon is calculated as 65 l/s. The two towers assure the safe functioning of the system under air displacements and dynamic pressure changes (Kessener 2001; Ortloff and Kassinos 2003; Nikolic 2008; Wiplinger 2016). Moreover, the second tower avoids the horizontal bending forces due to change in direction, which otherwise might damage the pipe system and interrupt the water ﬂow (Garbrecht 1977; Ozis 1994a, 1995, 1996; Alkan et al. 2014; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.38\n\nSide (Side)\n\nThe 25 km long conveyance to Side diverts a small part of the Manavgat river ﬂow on the right bank, at the location where the Dumanli spring discharges into Manavgat on the left bank. The karstic Dumanli spring has an average discharge around 50 m3/ s ﬂowing out from a single oriﬁce. The spring and the initial 5 km of the water conveyance to Side are submerged in the reservoir of Oymapinar dam. The conduit passes through several rock-cut channels (Fig. 2.18), tunnels and over 24 aqueduct-bridges. The longest is the 340 m long Homa (or Kirkgozler) aqueduct-bridge, situated 2 km downstream of the Oymapinar dam (Izmirligil 1979; Ozis and Harmancioglu 1980; Fahlbusch 1982, 1987d; Tolle-Kastenbein 1990; Hodge 1992; Buyukyildirim 1994a; Grewe 1994, 1998, 2010a, 2014; Ozis 1994a, 1995, 1996; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.39\n\nSagalassos (Aglasun)\n\nA 24 km long conveyance collected the water of several springs, from the east to the west, along the slopes of the mountain in the north, and supplied Sagalassos near Aglasun with water. Some remains of rock-cut or masonry conduits are encountered (Wiplinger 2006a, 2016; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n2.4.1.40\n\nAntiochia/Pisidia (Yalvac)\n\nA probably 11 km long conveyance from the north supplied water to Antiochia ad Pisidia. The conduit is basically a masonry channel, ends over a 300 m long partly ruined aqueduct-bridge of curved alignment and crosses the last valley with a stone-pipe inverted siphon (Weber 1904; Bildirici 1994; Burdy and Taslialan 1997; Ozis et al. 2018a).\n\n34\n\nU. Ozis et al.\n\nFig. 2.18 Rock-cut channel of the water conveyance to Side and, in the background, the Modern Oymapinar Arch Dam on Manavgat river. (Photo by U.Ozis)\n\n2.4.1.41\n\nAntiochia/Cragum (Guney)\n\nSeveral drainage channels, a ruined part of a masonry gallery, and the remains of a large Roman bath were found at Antiochia ad Cragum, located near the village Guney, southeast of Gazipasa at the Mediterranean sea. These elements indicate a relevant water conveyance from the eastern area (Wiplinger 2016).\n\n2.4.1.42\n\nAnemurium (Anamur)\n\nRemains of a signiﬁcant aqueduct-bridge indicate an interesting water supply for the antique city of Anemurium (Weber 1904; DSI 2008).\n\n2.4.1.43\n\nSbede (Yukari Caglar)\n\nA 4 km long water conveyance carries the water of the spring Boncukcayiri to Sbede, near the village Yukari Caglar, northeast of Ermenek. Besides a short baked clay pipe stretch, the conduit is a rock-carved channel, partly in the karstic\n\n2 Water Works of Ancient Civilizations\n\n35\n\nunderground. A stretch of this conduit is obtained by an horizontal qanat system with horizontal lateral tunnels instead of vertical shafts (Bildirici 2014).\n\n2.4.1.44\n\nDiocaeserea (Uzuncaburc)\n\nThree antique settlements, Diocaeserea (Uzuncaburc), Olba (Ugra), and Elaiussa Sebaste (Ayas), were supplied by the wat"
