Since 1997, all book proposals have been refereed by specialist reviewers as well as by the Society’s Books Editorial Committee. If the referees identify weaknesses in the proposal, these must be addressed before the proposal is accepted. Once the book is accepted, the Society Book Editors ensure that the volume editors follow strict guidelines on refereeing and quality control. We insist that individual papers can only be accepted after satisfactory review by two independent referees. The questions on the review forms are similar to those for Journal of the Geological Society. The referees’ forms and comments must be available to the Society’s Book Editors on request. Although many of the books result from meetings, the editors are expected to commission papers that were not presented at the meeting to ensure that the book provides a balanced coverage of the subject. Being accepted for presentation at the meeting does not guarantee inclusion in the book. More information about submitting a proposal and producing a book for the Society can be found on its web site: www.geolsoc.org.uk.\n\nIt is recommended that reference to all or part of this book should be made in one of the following ways: BRUNET , M.-F., WILMSEN , M. & GRANATH , J.

This multidisciplinary study of the Middle East, spanning the Arabian-Peri-Arabian and Caucasian – Caspian areas, was led by E. Barrier (CNRS –Universite´ Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France) and M. Gaetani (University of Milan, Italy). Its focus was the geodynamic evolution of the area, particularly since the late Palaeozoic, and emphasized dating; providing considerable details on the regional kinematics, plate tectonic models and geodynamic evolutions of the area. MEBE brought together about 300 scientists from 28 countries, representing 100 universities and research organizations. In order to prepare regional syntheses, MEBE established eight working groups comprising MEBE participants and external regional specialists. The MEBE working groups were focused regionally (Zagros, South Caspian Basin –central Iran, Caucasus, Black Sea, Levantine and East Arabian margins) and on products (stratigraphic comparisons, lithospheric cross-sections). From 2003 to 2005, 26 scientific projects were funded in 14 countries of the Middle East, including the Black Sea, Caucasus, northern Iran, the Zagros, the Arabian margins and Levant domains. About half of the MEBE projects were located in Iran because of the pivotal importance of several regions of this country to both scientific and hydrocarbon interests, as well as the continuous support by the Geological Survey of Iran (GSI). Workshops were a key element in the MEBE Programme. The first one was held in Kiev in February 2006 by the Black Sea Working Group; the Caucasus Working Group met in Ankara in September 2006. A programme-wide workshop in Milan in December 2006 gathered the Zagros, East Arabian margin, South Caspian Basin–central Iran and Stratigraphic Comparisons MEBE Working Groups. The last workshop was held in Paris in December 2006 by the Levant Working Group. An important documentation of the MEBE activities was given during the 2007 EGU General Assembly in Vienna, where a special MEBE session was held. The results of the programme, as well as the MEBE GIS Database, were presented by way of 70 communications during the final MEBE meeting held at the Universite´ Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris) in December 2007. The principal MEBE products are an atlas of 14 palaeotectonic maps (published by the CGMW) showing the geodynamic and tectonic evolution of the Middle East\n\nbetween the Late Triassic and the Present, and a series of four regional Geological Society of London Special Publications presenting the results of the regional MEBE working groups. The four volumes cover the Black Sea –Caucasus, the South Caspian–Central Iran, the Zagros–East Arabian margin and the Levant. This present volume deals with the geodynamic evolution of the region from the South Caspian Basin to North and Central Iran. The volume covering the Black Sea to the Caucasus, entitled Sedimentary Basin Tectonics from the Black Sea and Caucasus to the Arabian Platform, will be edited by M. Sosson (CNRS, University of Nice, France), N. Kaymakci (Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey), R. Stephenson (Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), V. Starostenko (Institute of Geophysics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine) and F. Bergerat (CNRS –Universite´ Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France). The volume will present detailed results of new fieldwork, as well as syntheses of the tectonic evolution of the Black Sea –Caucasus area (Greater Caucasus, Lesser Caucasus, South and East Anatolia, margins of the Black Sea and the Black Sea) constrained by an integration of the newly obtained and previously published data. The volume entitled Tectonic and Stratigraphic Evolution of Zagros and Makran During the MesoCenozoic, and edited by P. Leturmy (University of Cergy-Pontoise, France) and C. Robin (University of Rennes 1, France), will present new data and results on sedimentology, stratigraphy, biostratigraphy, tectonics and kinematics in the Zagros fold belt and the adjacent Makran accretionary prism. The teams involved were sponsored either by MEBE or by other programmes. The fourth volume, Evolution of the Levant Margin and Western Arabia Platform Since the Mesozoic, edited by C. Homberg (Universite´ Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France) and M. Bachmann (University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany), will cover improvements in our knowledge of the tectonic, stratigraphic and environmental evolution of the Levant basin and its margins since the Mesozoic. In summary, the MEBE Programme provides a significant contribution of high-quality geological data at interregional scales and a considerable advance in the knowledge of the regional geology. These results will strongly contribute to new interpretations of the geodynamic evolution of the whole Middle East. Marie-Franc¸oise Brunet (MEBE Bureau member) Paris, June 2008\n\nThe Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic succession of the Shemshak Group (up to 4000 m in thickness in the Alborz Mountains, Northern Iran) contains key information about the closure of the Palaeotethys Ocean, the rise and denudation of the Cimmeride Mountains, and the succeeding opening of the South Caspian Basin. Here at Emamzadeh–Hashem Pass (NW of Tehran, Iran), the Shemshak Group is embraced between Upper Palaeozoic–Middle Triassic (foreground) and Upper Jurassic carbonates (background).

The closure of the Palaeotethys, the opening of the Neotethys, the rise and demise of the Cimmerian mountain chain, as well as the onset of Neotethys subduction and large-scale Neotethyan back-arc rifting all predated the formation of the more than 20 km-thick fill of the South Caspian Basin. This volume brings together work by specialists in different disciplines of the geosciences (tectonics, geophysics, sedimentology, stratigraphy, palaeontology, basin modelling and geodynamics) in order to elucidate the complex Late Palaeozoic– Cenozoic geodynamic history of the Iran area and the birth of the South Caspian Basin.\n\nThe South Caspian Basin (Fig. 1) is among the deepest sedimentary basins in the world, yet its timing of formation, subsidence pattern and history are poorly understood, as are the mechanisms responsible for its geometry and evolution. For example, the age of the oldest sediments of the South Caspian Basin is unknown due to their inaccessibility at great depth of burial under Upper Cenozoic sediments. Consequently, understanding of the pre-Neogene, and particularly the Mesozoic history, is dependent on inference from the geology of surrounding areas. One aim of the Middle East Basin Evolution (MEBE) Programme was to perform new fieldwork on the margins of the South Caspian Basin, where inversion during the Cenozoic stages of the Arabia–Eurasia collision has exposed the rock record in the Alborz, Koppeh Dagh and Binalud mountains in northern Iran, as well as the eastern extent of the Greater Caucasus. Because the eastern edge of the South Caspian Basin and its relationship with other Iranian basins is unknown, studies of the central Iranian blocks where the remnants of Mesozoic deep oceanic basins are preserved are key to understanding the complex geological evolution of north-central Iran and the greater South Caspian area.\n\nMEBE South Caspian to Central Iran Basins Working Group This Special Publication contains mainly the results of the MEBE Programme by the South Caspian to Central Iran Basins Working Group (SCWG), led by Marie-Franc¸oise Brunet of CNRS – Universite´ Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris. Two additional papers (the second paper by Wilmsen et al. and Green et al.) were funded outside MEBE and complete the set of papers presented in this volume. Results of the programme were presented during a workshop held on 4–5 December 2006 in Universita` degli studi di Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy. Some of the papers were also presented in Session TS 10.3, ‘Middle East Basins Evolution’, of the European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly in Vienna, April 15–20 2007. Some work funded by MEBE on the geodynamics of the Alborz and Koppeh Dagh (Brunet et al. 2007; Shahidi 2008) are not presented here but, instead, will be published elsewhere. The SCWG comprised six MEBE projects involving interdisciplinary groups from mainly nine European research institutes and universities, as well as the Geological Survey of Iran, University of Tehran and the Geology Institute of Azerbaijan.\n\nFrom: BRUNET , M.-F., WILMSEN , M. & GRANATH , J.

To the south of the Palaeotethys, a long strip of microcontinental blocks rifted away from north of\n\nGondwana from the end of the Palaeozoic. Consisting of parts of Turkey and Iran, these blocks stretch to Southeast Asia, and are collectively known as Cimmeria, the Cimmerian continent or, preferably, simply the Cimmerian blocks as their original contiguity is questionable. The Permian–Middle Triassic advance and successive Late Triassic collision of some Cimmerian blocks with Laurasia along the north-directed\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsubduction zone closed the Palaeotethys Ocean during the Triassic in the so-called Early or EoCimmerian orogeny defined by Stille (1910). It was followed by Neotethys subduction, culminating in the collision of Arabia and Eurasia in the Cenozoic. This geodynamic history can be subdivided into pre-Eo-Cimmerian (late Palaeozoic – Middle Triassic) and post-Eo-Cimmerian intervals (Late Triassic –Cretaceous), separated by the collision of the Iran Plate with the southern margin of the Turan Plate. The pre-Eo-Cimmerian interval comprises the opening and closure of the Palaeotethys. It marks the history of the detachment of the Iran Plate from the northern margin of Gondwana, its drift as a part of the Cimmerian continental collage northwards toward Laurasia, and the simultaneous opening of the Neotethys in its wake. The post-Eo-Cimmerian interval comprises the Eo-Cimmerian collision of the Iran and Turan plates, and events in its aftermath: the uplift and denudation of the Cimmerides; the onset of northwards-directed Neotethys subduction below the Iran Plate, which continued for some 170 Ma; and the development of large-scale back-arc basins along the Palaeotethyan suture. That late rifting stage opened the South Caspian Basin; it began as early as the Late Triassic in the Alborz margin for Brunet et al. (2007) and Shahidi (2008), whereas Fu¨rsich et al. (in their first paper in this volume) prefer an onset in Liassic times. Several compressional tectonic events occurred during the post-rifting period of thermal subsidence, especially in the Early Cretaceous and the latest Cretaceous –Palaeogene. These compressional phases are evidenced by regional unconformities and deposition of clastic sediments. In the Eocene, a strong extension, associated with east– west-trending normal faulting, originated the thick volcanoclastic Karaj Formation in the southern part of the Alborz and the thick series of Talesh (NW Iran and SE Azerbaijan). Brunet et al. (2007) and Shahidi (2008) assume that this regional submeridian extension is related to the back-arc opening behind the northwards subduction of the Neotethys oceanic lithosphere beneath the Eurasian margin. The first compressional deformations, related to the Arabia –Eurasia collision, started in the Late Eocene (Barrier et al. 2008a, b). This early stage of the collision involved only the Eurasian and Arabian margins, and lasted until the Early Miocene, after which continent– continent collision generated the main orogenic belts of the Middle East (i.e. the Caucasus –Alborz, southern Turkey and Zagros ranges). The thickest series in the South Caspian Basin is represented by the Pliocene–Quaternary, with up to 10 km of sediments deposited in less than 5 Ma. Accumulation occurred within the framework of\n\n3\n\nstrong crustal shortening. The orogen’s uplift (Caucasus, Talesh, Alborz, Koppeh Dagh) surrounding the South Caspian Basin date to this time, isolating the South Caspian Basin. Their erosion provided an important source of sediment, filling up the subsiding South Caspian Basin and the foreland basins of the belts.\n\nMain outline of the papers The first paper by Muttoni et al. discusses previously published palaeomagnetic data, as well as new Late Ordovician and Triassic palaeomagnetic data. They provide insights into the drift history of Iran as part of Cimmeria during the Ordovician –Triassic. Results indicate that in the Late Ordovician –earliest Carboniferous Iran was part of Gondwana, residing in the Late Permian and early Early Triassic at subequatorial palaeolatitudes, clearly disengaged from the parental Gondwanan margin in the southern hemisphere. Since the late Early Triassic Iran has been located in the northern hemisphere close to the Eurasian margin after crossing much of the Palaeotethys in approximately 35 Ma, at an average plate speed of about 7 –8 cm year21. Muttoni et al. argue that caution is warranted with the 1358 counterclockwise rotational model for central Iran with respect to Eurasia since the Triassic.\n\nNorthern Iran Zanchi et al. start their first paper with a complete account of the geological setting of the Alborz since the Precambrian before describing the Eo-Cimmerian orogenic structures resulting from the Late Triassic collision between Iran and the southern margin of Eurasia. Eo-Cimmerian structures are discontinuously exposed below the siliciclastic deposits of the Shemshak Group (Upper Triassic –Jurassic). In eastern Alborz (Neka Valley), south of Gorgan, the external part of the belt is preserved. Mesozoic successions overlie a pre-Jurassic Eo-Cimmerian thrust stack with a sharp unconformity. The stack is overthrusted southwards above a strongly deformed Upper Palaeozoic–Middle Triassic succession belonging to North Iran. Zanchi et al. also investigate the Shanderman Complex, exposed in the Talesh Mountains, western Alborz. According to their new data and analyses, Zanchetta et al. consider the Shanderman Complex as a metamorphic complex containing well-preserved eclogitic-phase assemblages and not as an ophiolitic fragment of the Palaeotethys Ocean along the Palaeotethys suture, as it was previously interpreted. New dating suggests an\n\n4\n\nM.-F. BRUNET ET AL.\n\nequilibration in high-pressure conditions of a deeply subducted continental crust during the late Carboniferous, tentatively in a Variscan orogenic event, thus pre-dating the Eo-Cimmerian orogeny by more than 100 Ma. Zanchetta et al. suggest that the Shanderman Complex represents a fragment of the Upper Palaeozoic European continental crust (Transcaucasia) stacked southwards on the northern edge of the Iran Plate during the Eo-Cimmerian orogeny, later to become finally exhumed at the end of the Eo-Cimmerian orogeny. Zanchi et al. also record the occurrence of an Eo-Cimmerian metamorphic event south of the Shanderman Complex, in Upper Palaeozoic slates and carbonates occurring below the Lower Jurassic Shemshak Group. Based on these new data, the Eo-Cimmerian structures exposed in the Alborz appear to be remnants of a collisional orogen consisting mainly of deformed continental crust without preservation of ophiolites. Gaetani et al. describe in detail the sedimentary succession from the Pennsylvanian (Carboniferous) to the Lower Triassic in the central and eastern Alborz on the basis of new fieldwork, and propose a regional synthesis based on sedimentary analysis and the collection of new palaeontological data. They discuss the main factors controlling the sedimentation: the global sea-level curve in the Moscovian and from the Middle Permian upwards; passive margin conditions; and change in the climate during the fast northwards drift of Iran blocks. It passed from a southern latitude through the aridity belt in the Middle Permian, across the equatorial humid belt in the Late Permian and reached the northern arid tropical belt in the Triassic. Fu¨rsich et al., in their first paper in this volume, give a complete new lithostratigraphic description of the Upper Triassic –Middle Jurassic Shemshak Group of northern Iran. This up-to-4000 m-thick siliciclastic unit is widespread across the Iran Plate of northern and central Iran; it was deposited after a drastic change in sedimentation following the deposit of the Lower–Middle Triassic platform carbonates of the Elikah and Shotori formations. The passage to the Shemshak Group is marked by karstification and bauxite/laterite deposits. The top of the group corresponds also to a sharp change from siliciclastic rocks to Middle–Upper Jurassic carbonates of a platform –basin system. In the Alborz, a Triassic and a Jurassic unit separated by an unconformity (in part angular in the north and less conspicuous towards the south) comprise the Shemshak Group. Fu¨rsich et al. distinguish two major facies belts approximately parallel to the strike of the Alborz. The northern one starts with deep-marine sediments (the Ekrasar Formation) representing prodelta –delta front environments, succeeded by fluvial–lacustrine, coal-bearing formations passing to the Jurassic conglomerates of\n\nthe Javaherdeh Formation. The southern facies belt begins with fluvial, coastal plain and shallow –marginal marine environments, followed by rocks of fluvial–lacustrine origin with coal. It continues with deep-marine shales and ends with sediments of deltaic –coastal plain origin. Fu¨rsich et al. interpret this lithostratigraphic scheme with the tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Shemshak Foreland Basin of the Alborz. A relict marine basin was gradually infilled in the north during the Late Triassic, whereas largely non-marine–marginalmarine conditions prevailed in the south. The basin was filled during the early Lias by erosional products of the uplifting Cimmerian orogen. Rapid subsidence prevailed during the Toarcian–early Middle Jurassic in the south, resulting in the deepening and subsequent infilling of a marine basin. Shekarifard et al. present results of bulk organic geochemical and microscopic studies carried out on the fine-grained sediments of the Shemshak Group in the Alborz. They show a dispersion of the organic matter that experienced high temperatures (Tmax values average 500 8C) during deep burial and active post-sedimentary tectonics. Total organic carbon (TOC) indicates a generally poor –moderate organic carbon content. The Lower Shemshak Group (Upper Triassic) was mainly deposited in marine/lake settings under dysoxic–anoxic conditions, and is an important effective petroleum source rock in the Alborz Range. In contrast, the Upper Shemshak Group (Toarcian –Aalenian) was deposited under comparatively deeper marine oxic–dysoxic conditions and has a low potential to produce petroleum. The Shemshak Group is also recognized in the Binalud Mountains, in NE Iran by Wilmsen et al. in their first paper in this volume. A Lower–lower Middle Jurassic non-marine sedimentary succession rests with angular unconformity on a metamorphic basement deformed during the Late Triassic Eo-Cimmerian orogeny. The overall succession with many conglomerates fines upwards owing to erosion, which eventually exposed metamorphic basement of a high-relief source area. Wilmsen et al. suggest that the strata are intramontane deposits of the Cimmerian Mountain chain in NE Iran, and that the position of the NW–SE-trending Eo-Cimmerian suture in NE Iran should be placed further SW than formerly assumed. An intra-Bajocian unconformity terminates the sedimentary cycle of the Shemshak Group. It is observed in many places all across the Iran Plate (Alborz Mountains of northern Iran, northeastern Iran, east-central Iran) and is sometimes called the Lutian unconformity (Seyed-Emami & Alavi-Naini 1990) or Mid-Cimmerian unconformity. In their second paper in this volume Fu¨rsich et al. describe the Mid-Cimmerian unconformity in the Alborz Mountains, northern Iran. A first\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndistinct unconformity (near the Lower –Upper Bajocian boundary) is the sedimentary expression of rapid basin-shallowing due to uplift and erosion. Another unconformity is developed in the early Upper Bajocian, expressed as an angular unconformity due to block rotation, overlain by a thin transgressive conglomerate, followed by silty marls of the deep-marine Upper Bajocian –Callovian Dalichai Formation. This upper unconformity signals a rapid subsidence pulse. On the Tabas Block of east-central Iran (Wilmsen et al. in their second paper), a single unconformity (fusion of the lower and upper Mid-Cimmerian unconformities) can be documented. The Mid-Cimmerian tectonic event is thought now to be confined to the Bajocian. Fu¨rsich et al. explain this Bajocian phase as the expression of the change from the rifting- to the spreading-stage of the South Caspian Basin situated to the north of the present-day Alborz Mountains. In their interpretation, the Mid-Cimmerian event reflects a break-up unconformity, i.e. the onset of sea-floor spreading of the South Caspian Basin. Also along the southern margin of the Koppeh Dagh Mountains (northeastern Iran), one phase of uplift and erosion took place followed by a pronounced pulse of subsidence in the Late Bajocian that initiated the opening of the strongly subsiding Kashafrud Basin. This basin stretched in a NW– SE direction between the Koppeh Dagh and the Binalud Mountains, and is regarded as an eastwards extension of the South Caspian Basin (Brunet et al. 2007; Shahidi 2008; Taheri et al.). Taheri et al. describe the Kashafrud Basin, which rifted from the Late Bajocian onwards. It accumulated more than 2000 m of Upper Bajocian –Upper Bathonian siliciclastic sediments (termed the Kashafrud Formation) that vary rapidly in thickness and facies: basal non-marine alluvial fans and braided-river deposits grade into slope and deep-marine sediments at the top. The deep-marine shales of the Kashafrud Formation are effective hydrocarbon source rocks in the Koppeh Dagh.\n\nSouth Caspian Basin subsidence Two papers, Egan et al. and Green et al. deal with subsidence modelling of the South Caspian Basin. They present different versions of models using similar sets of data and modelling software. Both papers conclude with a scenario of a Jurassic creation of thin and dense crust, probably of oceanic type, allowing the deposition of around 20 km of sediments in the main basin after thermal and flexural subsidence. Egan et al. combine fieldwork in the eastern part of Caucasus and offshore data provided by BP to investigate the role, as well as the timing, of the subsidence–uplift mechanisms that have affected\n\n5\n\nthe Azerbaijan region of the South Caspian Basin from the Mesozoic to Recent. Model results support the tectonic scenario that South Caspian Basin crust has a density that is compatible with an oceanic composition and is being underthrust beneath the central Caspian region with an increase of the flexural subsidence in the northern part of the South Caspian Basin. Green et al., with a more complete oil exploration data set, give more emphasis on the Pliocene– Recent .7 km-thick sequence. Six kilometres of this sequence form the principal hydrocarbon reservoirs in the basin, the fluvial–lacustrine and deltaic sediments of the Pliocene Productive Series. According to Green et al., modelling shows that the deposition of this thick sequence can be explained without an additional Tertiary tectonic event, driven only by sediment loading and compaction on a thermally subsiding late Mesozoic crust. Their main conclusion is that deposition of the Pliocene Productive Series in a topographic depression was controlled by local factors, with a local base-level isolated from the global oceanic system, similar to the Mediterranean Messinian basin at the same time.\n\nCentral Iran Three papers deal with the central Iranian area. Zanchi et al., in their second paper, enumerate the models and the related blocks or terranes proposed in the literature to compose the Iran Plate. They discuss new fieldwork data and analyse results from the region of Nakhlak–Anarak (Central Iran). These structural, sedimentological, petrological and palaeomagnetic data provide important constraints on the Cimmerian evolution of Central Iran. Balini et al. give more details on the Triassic strata exposed at Nakhlak. They provide a lithostratigraphic revision of the succession on the basis of bed-by-bed sampling for ammonoids, conodonts and bivalves, as well as thin sections for limestone and sandstone petrographic analysis. Provenance for Olenekian–Anisian and Upper Ladinian sandstones is from a volcanic arc setting, while the sandstones of the ?Upper Anisian–Ladinian are related to exhumation and erosion of a metamorphic basement possibly located in the present-day Anarak region (see also the second paper by Zanchi et al.). The Anarak Metamorphic Complex was repeatedly deformed during post-Triassic times. The combination of various parameters (provenance, huge thickness, fast change of facies, abundance of volcaniclastic supply and orogenic calc-alkaline affinity of the volcanism) favours the interpretation that sedimentation of the Olenekian– Upper Ladinian succession occurred along an active margin, most probably in a forearc setting. The Nakhlak–Anarak units represent an arc–trench\n\n6\n\nM.-F. BRUNET ET AL.\n\nsystem developed during the Eo-Cimmerian orogenic cycle. Balini et al. make a comparison between the Triassic successions of Nakhlak and the one exposed in the erosional window of Aghdarband (Koppeh Dagh, northeastern Iran). The similarity pointed out by previous authors was an argument for the model of 1358 counterclockwise rotation of the central Iran blocks (Davoudzadeh et al. 1981; Soffel et al. 1996, among others), placing the Nakhlak area in a palaeoposition close to Aghdarband before rotation. According to Balini et al., these two successions, even if deposited along active margins, were possibly not deposited along the same margin. Indeed, their characteristics present more differences than similarities from a lithofacies point of view, and a preliminary palaeobiogeographical comparison is made based on new ammonoid data. Zanchi et al., in their second paper, discuss different tectonic scenarios that can account for the evolution of the region and for the occurrence of the Anarak orogenic wedge in its present position within central Iran, as well as its relationship to a presumed ‘Variscan’ metamorphic event. These results, added to the discussion of Muttoni et al. on palaeomagnetic data, lead Zanchi et al. and Balini et al. to conclude that large anticlockwise block rotations for Central Iran with respect to Eurasia since the Middle Triassic are doubtful. Timing, mechanism and amount of relative displacements between the different blocks of Iran are still obscure. Wilmsen et al., in their second paper in this volume, give an overview of the stratigraphy and facies development of the Upper Triassic –Jurassic sequences on the Tabas Block, east-central Iran. Unconformities related to the Cimmerian tectonic events subdivide the succession into major tectono-stratigraphic units. As in northern Iran, the Middle Triassic platform carbonates (Shotori Formation) are followed, with a drastic facies change, by the siliciclastic rocks of the Shemshak Group that reflect the onset of Eo-Cimmerian deformation in northern Iran. Marine sediments of the Norian –Rhaetian Nayband Formation pass to nonmarine, coal-bearing siliciclastic rocks around the Triassic– Jurassic boundary, related by Wilmsen et al. to the main uplift phase of the Cimmerian orogeny. Toarcian –Aalenian condensed limestones, indicating transgression, are followed by rapid lateral facies and thickness variations during the Lower Bajocian that culminate in the middle Bajocian compressional –extensional Mid-Cimmerian Event. The succeeding Late Bajocian –Bathonian onlap of the Baghamshah Subgroup was caused by increased subsidence of the Tabas Block, followed by the development of a large-scale platformto-basin carbonate system during the Callovian–\n\nKimmeridgian (Esfandiar Subgroup) which was destroyed by block-faulting that started in the Kimmeridgian (Late Cimmerian event). The same type of general evolution occurred here and in the Alborz Range of northern Iran, suggesting a common behaviour in the same structural unit. The data and models presented in this volume result in a detailed picture and a much more comprehensive understanding of the late Palaeozoic– Cenozoic geodynamic evolution of the South Caspian northern and central Iran sedimentary basins. They clarify some relationships of the region and add detail to its Palaeozoic–Mesozoic evolution. Notably, the work in the MEBE Programme will rearrange widely held notions of the early Mesozoic palaeogeography of this part of the Tethyan realm.

These data, in conjunction with data from the literature, provide insights on the drift history of Iran as part of Cimmeria during the Ordovician– Triassic. A robust agreement of palaeomagnetic poles of Iran and West Gondwana is observed for the Late Ordovician–earliest Carboniferous, indicating that Iran was part of Gondwana during that time. Data for the Late Permian–early Early Triassic indicate that Iran resided on subequatorial palaeolatitudes, clearly disengaged from the parental Gondwanan margin in the southern hemisphere. Since the late Early Triassic, Iran has been located in the northern hemisphere close to the Eurasian margin. This northward drift brought Iran to cover much of the Palaeotethys in approximately 35 Ma, at an average plate speed of c. 7 –8 cm year21, and was in part coeval to the transformation of Pangaea from an Irvingian B to a Wegenerian A-type configuration.\n\nAccording to Sengo¨r (1979), a strip of Gondwanan terranes called the Cimmerian Continent, which includes Iran, broke off the eastern Gondwanan margin during the Permian–Triassic, drifted northwards across the Palaeotethys in a windscreenwiper fashion and eventually collided with the Eurasian margin, giving birth to a conspicuous mountain chain, the Cimmerian orogen. This eminent and imaginative model of plates’ motion had a profound impact on Tethyan geology and was particularly appealing to palaeomagnetists insofar as it is testable by using the relationship between inclination of the time-averaged geomagnetic field and latitude. Indeed, quoting Van der Voo (1993), ‘the observed palaeolatitudes vindicate, in a very convincing way, the model of the Cimmerian continental motion of Sengo¨r & colleagues, at least insofar as Iran is concerned’, and this was due largely to the research efforts of Wensink et al. (1978), Wensink (1979, 1982, 1983) and, more recently, Besse et al. (1998). This premise would suggest that the drift model of Iran is grounded on a sound palaeomagnetic basis. However, in some instances, palaeomagnetically determined palaeolatitudes could be ambiguous for the reason that, without independent\n\nestimates of polarity, the hemisphere of magnetization acquisition is undetermined. This ambiguity was resolved by Besse et al. (1998) in the Late Permian –Early Triassic by means of magnetostratigraphic correlations to sections of known polarity, but this exercise of polarity determination remains an exception in the Iranian database. Polarity (hemispheric) uncertainty can represent a problem when attempting to resolve the motion of Iran or other Cimmerian terranes because the Tethys Gulf was largely symmetric with respect to the palaeoequator. In this paper, new palaeomagnetic data from Iran are presented and a critical revision of palaeomagnetic data from the literature is attempted with the aim to refine the drift history of Iran over the Ordovician–Triassic.\n\nPalaeomagnetic data Palaeomagnetic analyses were conducted on samples from sediments biostratigraphically constrained to the Late Ordovician, Late Permian, Early Triassic and late Early–late Middle Triassic (Olenekian–late Ladinian). Palaeomagnetic samples were drilled in the field with a water-cooled rock drill and oriented\n\nFrom: BRUNET , M.-F., WILMSEN , M. & GRANATH , J. W. (eds) South Caspian to Central Iran Basins.

All samples were thermally demagnetized and measured after each heating step on a 2G Enterprises dc SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) cryogenic magnetometer located in a shielded room at the Alpine Laboratory of Paleomagnetism of Peveragno, Italy. An average of 50 8C steps from room temperature to a maximum of 680 8C were adopted. The component structure of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) was monitored after each demagnetization step by means of vector end-point demagnetization diagrams (Zijderveld 1967), and steps of 25–10 8C were adopted close to critical unblocking temperatures. Magnetic components were obtained by standard least-square analysis (Kirschvink 1980) on linear portions of the demagnetization paths and plotted on equal-area projections. Standard Fisher (1953) statistics was applied to calculate site mean directions. Inclination-only statistics (McFadden & Reid 1982) were occasionally applied to sites characterized by declination scattering. The magnetic mineralogy of rocks was studied by means of isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition curves, thermal decay of a three-component IRM (Lowrie 1990) acquired in 2.5 T (high), 0.5 T (medium) and 0.15 T (low) fields, or simply by\n\nanalysis of the maximum unblocking temperatures of the NRM.\n\nUpper Ordovician Shirgesht Formation, Anarak A well-exposed Ordovician–Permian section crops out to the east of the town of Anarak at the edge of the Kavir loot (Sharkovski et al. 1984). The sampled site (Fig. 1, site IR12; 33.188N, 53.898E) is located at the base of lithological interval 3 of Sharkovski et al. (1984) and consists of strata dipping to the SW by 60 –708. They include red bioclastic sandy–silty limestones, silty marls and red shales pertaining to the first marine intercalation of the Shirgesht Formation. Schallreuter et al. (2006) attributed this interval to the Late Ordovician based on ostracoda biostratigraphy. Deformation in this general area took place broadly during the Mesozoic. The Neo-Cimmerian event is clearly recorded by a strong angular unconformity, metamorphism and the emplacement of magmatic bodies occurring between the Middle – Late Jurassic and the beginning of the Cretaceous. The possible occurrence of Late Triassic\n\nFig. 1. Structural sketch map of Iran with palaeomagnetic sites discussed in the text indicated. Modified after Angiolini et al.

A total of 19 samples have been cored in the field, yielding 28 standard (c. 11 cm3) specimens for palaeomagnetic analyses. Isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition curves show the occurrence of a high coercivity magnetic phase with a tendency to saturate only in fields higher than about 1.5 T (Fig. 2A, left panel). Thermal decay of the NRM shows that this phase consists essentially of hematite characterized by a narrow spectrum of maximum unblocking temperatures around approximately 660–680 8C (Fig. 2A, right panel). Most of the samples show the presence of pervasive A components with northerly and steep down directions in in situ co-ordinates (declination (Dec.) ¼ 2.18E, inclination (Inc.) ¼ 54.38, Fisher precision parameter (k) ¼ 79.9, Fisher angle of halfcone of 95% confidence about the mean direction (a95) ¼ 3.38) isolated between room temperature and approximately 175 8C (Fig. 3A, B and Table 1). These components are rather well defined (overall mean angular deviation (MAD) ¼ 2.28, standard deviation (St) ¼ 2.18) and are broadly aligned along a recent geocentric axial dipole (GAD) field direction (GAD inclination ¼ 528). In the temperature range between about 200 and c. 675 8C, characteristic C components are observed trending to the origin of the demagnetization axes with well-defined directions (overall MAD ¼ 4.78, St ¼ 2.18) oriented northeasterly and steeply down, which, upon correction for bedding tilt, become westerly and steeply down (Dec. ¼ 263.08E, Inc. ¼ 51.88, k ¼ 47.2, a95 ¼ 4.28; Fig. 3A, B and Table 1). No field test is available to constrain the age of these C components, which are nonetheless regarded as primary (Late Ordovician) based on palaeomagnetic poles analysis, as discussed in the next section.\n\nc. 16 m of yellowish –brown laminated marls and fine-grained oolitic limestones. A laterally discontinuous 3–5 m-thick red–brown, fine-grained and massive bed overturned and dipping to the north by approximately 778 is present in this interval, and will hereafter be referred to as Aruh laterite. At the top, the residual profile grades into the marls and limestones of the basal Elikah Formation. Deformation in this general area took place essentially during the Cenozoic (e.g. Allen et al. 2003), although the effects of older deformational phases since the Late Triassic –Early Jurassic Eo-Cimmerian orogeny cannot be excluded. The studied site is located along the southern flank of a late Cenozoic anticline, which is crossed by the Mosha Fault, an active left-lateral strike-slip fault with large displacement (Allen et al. 2003). A total of 18 samples have been cored in the field in the Aruh laterite, yielding an equivalent amount of approximately 11 cm3 specimens for palaeomagnetic analyses. The Aruh laterite contains hematite of chemical origin that carries essentially two (and rarely three) magnetic components. Components oriented broadly along a recent GAD field direction in in situ co-ordinates dominate from room temperature up to about 250 8C. Characteristic C components (MAD ¼ 4.78, St ¼ 3.58) are isolated in the c. 350–620 8C temperature range. These are orientated essentially west and up in in situ co-ordinates, or NW and very shallow upon correction for bedding tilt (Dec. ¼ 331.88E, Inc. ¼ 21.38, k ¼ 18.5, a95 ¼ 10.48; Table 1) (see in Muttoni et al., submitted, for additional information). No field test is available to constrain the age of these C components, but, as for data from the Shirgesht Formation, we propose a primary (Late Permian) age of magnetization based on palaeogeographic considerations as discussed in the following section and in Muttoni et al. (submitted).\n\nUpper Permian Aruh laterite\n\nLower Triassic Sorkh Shale, Tabas\n\nA lateritic residual profile crops out near the Aruh village in the Alborz Mountains of north Iran (Fig. 1, site IR27; 35.668N, 52.408E). Age, chemical composition, palaeomagnetic properties and palaeogeographic implications of this residual profile and similar deposits from other Cimmerian units are discussed in Muttoni et al. (submitted). In brief, this profile is Late Permian in age, and is comprised between the carbonate platform limestones of the Ruteh Formation of Middle Permian (Capitanian) age and the carbonate platform limestones of the Elikah Formation of early Early Triassic (Induan) age (Gaetani et al. 2009 and references therein). The lowermost part of the profile consists of approximately 1 m of quartz-rich conglomerates and quartz arenites in a red shaly matrix, overlain by\n\nThin-bedded reddish oolitic–bioclastic limestones and marly limestones pertaining to the Sorkh Shale are exposed in the Shotori Range near the town of Tabas (Fig. 1, site SS). These sediments are Early Triassic in age (Bro¨nnimann et al. 1973) and have previously been studied for palaeomagnetism by Wensink (1982). In this same area we sampled two sites, namely IR34 (33.298N, 57.378E) and IR35 (33.378N, 57.258E), which yielded 19 and 21 standard c. 11 cm3 specimens for palaeomagnetic analyses, respectively. At both sites bedding attitude is highly variable, with strata dipping to the SE by approximately 60–858 at site IR34, and to the SSW by approximately 55 –758 at site IR35. Both sites are located along the northern branch of the North–South Nayband\n\n10\n\nG. MUTTONI ET AL.\n\nFig. 2. Rock magnetic experiments on representative samples from this study.

Thermal decay of the NRM reveals the presence in most of the\n\nDRIFT HISTORY OF IRAN\n\n11\n\nFig. 2. Continued.\n\nsamples from site IR34 of A component directions (MAD ¼ 5.68, St ¼ 2.18) isolated between approximately 100 and 320 8C. These are oriented northerly and steep down in in situ co-ordinates (Dec. ¼ 351.38E, Inc. ¼ 55.98, k ¼ 46.7, a95 ¼ 5.78), and are distributed broadly around a recent GAD field direction (GAD inclination ¼ 538). In samples from site IR35, similar components (MAD ¼ 5.48, St ¼ 2.18) with in situ GAD-aligned directions (Dec. ¼ 4.68E, Inc. ¼ 48.38, k ¼ 99.3, a95 ¼ 3.68) are present between room temperature\n\nand approximately 250 8C (Fig. 4A, B and Table 1). Removal of these A components reveals the presence of characteristic C components isolated between approximately 450 and 650 8C at site IR34 (MAD ¼ 2.58, St ¼ 1.18), and approximately 525– 660 8C at site IR35 (MAD ¼ 2.68, St ¼ 1.38). The boundary between low-temperature A and hightemperature C components at both sites is frequently transitional, with directions moving along smallcircle paths.

Combining C components from both sites results in a clustering of their inclination values around an overall mean of 17.68 + 4.68 after correction for bedding tilt, with the precision parameter increasing by a factor of 8.5 (Fig. 4C and Table 1).

The dispersion in declination values that persists in bedding\n\nco-ordinates is probably owing to uncertainties in the (simple) tilting correction applied and hence in the assumed deformation history of these highly deformed and fault-bounded outcrops.\n\nLower – Middle Triassic Alam and Ashin formations, Nakhlak A sedimentary sequence, late Early–late Middle Triassic (Olenekian–late Ladinian) in age, is exposed in the Nakhlak area of Central Iran (Fig. 1, site NAK; c. 33.558N, c. 53.848E).

The sampled units belong to a geologically complex structure consisting of a WNW–ESE-trending fold-and-thrust belt. Strata at sampling sites generally dip to the NNE by approximately 508 –708, except for site IR04 where strata dip to the SW by approximately 508. Gently dipping strata of Upper Cretaceous –Palaeogene limestones and red sandstones unconformably cover the deformed Triassic succession (Zanchi et al. 2009a). Palaeomagnetic sites consist of volcanoclastic fine-grained sandstones and siltstones, except for sites IR02 and IR04 which consist of reddish nodular limestones. Sites IR01, IR02, IR04, IR03 and IR17 are located in the upper Lower– lower Middle Triassic (Olenekian –middle Anisian) Alam Formation. In particular, sites IR02 and IR04 are located in the Red Nodular Limestone of the Alam Formation, dated to the Olenekian using ammonoid biostratigraphy (Balini et al. 2009). Site IR05 is located in the lower part of the Ashin Formation of late Middle Triassic (late Ladinian) age (Balini et al. 2009). These samples contain magnetite and/or hematite in variable proportions. In samples from site IR02, hematite dominates with a narrow spectrum of maximum unblocking temperatures approaching approximately 680 8C, as visible in the thermal decay of the medium–high coercivity components of the IRM (Fig. 2C, samples IR02-15 and IR02-20). In samples from sites IR04, maximum unblocking temperatures consistent with both magnetite (c. 570 8C) and hematite coexist, as visible in the thermal decay of the low and medium–high coercivity components of the IRM, respectively (Fig. 2C, samples IR04-03 and IR04-17). Analysis of the maximum unlocking temperatures of the NRM seems also to suggest the coexistence of magnetite and hematite in samples from sites IR01 and IR05, whereas samples from sites IR03 and IR17 appear dominated by magnetite (Fig. 2C, lower panels). Palaeomagnetic components have been grouped into four categories labelled A, B1, B2 and C. Components A, B1 and B2 are regarded as postdepositional overprints of different origin and age, whereas the characteristic C components are tentatively regarded as primary (syn-depositional) in age, as discussed later. Most of the samples from all sites show the presence of pervasive A components (MAD ¼ 3.58, St ¼ 2.68) with northerly and steeply down directions in in situ co-ordinates, isolated from room temperature–100 8C to approximately 300–450 8C, occasionally up to about 600 8C (Figs 5B & 6 and Table 1). The A component\n\n15\n\ndirections are clearly grouped around a recent GAD field direction in in situ co-ordinates (Fig. 5C). The overall mean of N ¼ 6 sites (Dec. ¼ 2.38E, Inc. ¼ 50.18, k ¼ 263, a95 ¼ 4.18) is statistically undistinguishable from the local GAD inclination of 538. Upon correction for bedding tilt, the sites’ mean directions become scattered, the overall precision parameter k reducing by a factor of 42 (Fig. 5C). Removal of these A components reveals the presence in samples from sites IR02 and IR04 of characteristic C component directions (MAD ¼ 7.08, St ¼ 3.98) isolated between approximately 400 and 675 8C, and trending to the origin of the demagnetization axes (Figs 5B & 6 and Table 1). At site IR04 these C components show dual polarity. The C component site mean directions are 99.78 apart along a great circle in in situ co-ordinates, and after correction for bedding tilt they tend to cluster, reducing their great-circle separation to 38.58 (Fig. 5D). Inclination-only statistics applied to C components from both sites resulted in a clustering of their inclination values around an overall mean of 37.48 + 5.48 after correction for bedding tilt (Fig. 5D and Table 1). Finally, B1 and B2 component directions were also observed in samples from sites IR01, IR03 and IR17 in the c. 250–600 8C temperature range after removal of the A components (Figs 5B & 6 and Table 1). At site IR01, the B1 components in in situ co-ordinates are quasi-antipodal to the in situ A components found in the same site at lower temperatures (Fig. 5B). These B1 components may thus represent recent overprints of reverse polarity. For samples from sites IR03 and IR17, the B1 components are more obscure and difficult to interpret. They are not compatible with recent field directions in in situ co-ordinates, and their site mean directions show no sign of clustering upon correction for bedding tilt. At site IR17, removal of these B1 components reveals the presence of B2 components with a tilt-corrected mean inclination value of 60.28 (a95 ¼ 9.28; Table 1) that is significantly different from, and hence apparently inconsistent with, the inclination values of the characteristic C components isolated at sites IR02 and IR04 (average inclination of 37.48). In conclusion, post-depositional remagnetization events of thermochemical origin pervasively overprinted all volcaniclastic sandstone and siltstone samples, generating recent GAD-aligned A components and possibly also scattered B1 and B2 components. Nodular limestones at sites IR02 and IR04 survived overprinting, showing apparently pre-folding C components that are possibly primary (syn-depositional) in age. The dispersion in their site mean declination values that persists after correction for bedding tilt is probably due to\n\n16\n\nG. MUTTONI ET AL.\n\nFig. 5.

Data from the literature summarized in Van\n\nder Voo (1993) and Besse et al. (1998), augmented by data from this study, have been used to calculate north palaeomagnetic poles and palaeolatitudes for Iran from the Ordovician to the Triassic (Table 2). In our reconstructions, the various Iranian blocks, e.g. Alborz, Yadz, Tabas, Lut and Sanandaj– Sirjan (Fig. 1), have not been considered separately because the available palaeomagnetic results are too\n\nTable 2.

In order to compare poles from Iran with coeval poles from Gondwana and Europe, apparent polar wander (APW) paths for West Gondwana (in NW Africa co-ordinates) and Europe have been constructed using selected data from the literature, as illustrated in Table 3. The APW path of Gondwana during the Palaeozoic has been the subject of much debate because some of the paleomagnetic poles for the Silurian and Devonian were derived from suspect terranes from Australia (McElhinny et al. 2003 and references therein). The Ordovician –Carboniferous Gondwana APW path adopted in this study is from McElhinny et al. (2003), whereas the coeval APW path for Europe is from Van der Voo (1993). The Permian–Triassic segments of the Gondwana and Europe APW paths are derived from palaeomagnetic poles of generally good quality (sensu Van der Voo 1993) and are listed in Table 3. Poles for West Gondwana have been rotated from NW Africa into Arabian co-ordinates using an Euler pole derived from Lottes & Rowley (1990) (26.228N, 11.158E, V ¼ 14.178), and have been plotted together with the European poles in Figure 7. These poles have been used to calculate Ordovician–Triassic palaeolatitudes expected at a nominal point located at 338N, 538E in central Iran for comparison with observed Iranian palaeolatitudes (Fig. 8). Data have been grouped in three time windows: namely, Late Ordovician–Early Carboniferous; Middle Permian–early Early Triassic; and late Early Triassic –Late Triassic.\n\nLate Ordovician – Early Carboniferous: Iran as part of Gondwana Data from Iran pertaining to this time window come from the Upper Ordovician site IR12 of this study (Fig. 1 and Table 2; site IR12), the Lower Devonian Red beds of Wensink (1983) (site RB) and the Geirud lavas of Wensink et al. (1978) (site GL). The Geirud lavas were attributed to the Late Devonian –Early Carboniferous by Wensink et al. (1978), but, according to Wendt et al. (2005), they are bracketed between upper Famennian sediments below and upper Tournaisian –Visean sediments above, and are therefore probably earliest Carboniferous in age. The polarity of magnetization at these sites is unknown. Hence, their hemisphere of magnetization acquisition and north palaeomagnetic poles (defined by magnetizations in normal polarity reference frame) cannot be unequivocally determined. Polarity has been chosen in order to obtain the simplest tectonic scenario derived from comparison with coeval north poles from West Gondwana and\n\n19\n\nEurope. Reverse, normal and reverse polarity has been assigned to the mean magnetization of, respectively, the Upper Ordovician site IR12 (Dec. ¼ 263.08E, Inc. ¼ 51.88), the Lower Devonian Red beds (Dec. ¼ 24.28E, Inc. ¼ 21.38) and the lowermost Carboniferous Geirud lavas (Dec. ¼ 211.08E, Inc. ¼ 67.08). The derived palaeomagnetic north poles (Table 2) fall relatively close to, respectively, the Late Ordovician, Early Devonian and Early Carboniferous north poles of West Gondwana (Fig. 7A). This substantial congruence of poles (within palaeomagnetic error resolution) over a period of remarkable polar wander implies significant tectonic coherence of central Iran (sites IR12 and RB) and the Alborz region (site GL) with West Gondwana during this time interval. The sampled sites were located at a palaeolatitude of, respectively, approximately 328S (+48) during the Late Ordovician, approximately 18S (+58) during the Early Devonian and approximately 508S (+58) during the earliest Carboniferous, close to the Arabian margin of West Gondwana (Fig. 8, sites IR12, RB and GL, respectively). These overall conclusions concerning the Arabian affinity of Iran in the Palaeozoic substantiate previous conclusions by Wensink and colleagues (e.g. Wensink et al. 1978), and rule out the hypothesis that the Alborz region was located close to the southern margin of Eurasia during the Early Carboniferous as proposed by Kalvoda (2002) using palaeobiogegraphic data.\n\nMiddle Permian– early Early Triassic: Iran in motion Data from Iran pertaining to this time window come from four rock units: the Middle Permian Ruteh lavas from the Alborz Mountains (Besse et al. 1998) (Fig. 1 and Table 2, site RL); the Upper Permian Hambast Formation from Shahreza (Besse et al. 1998) (site H); the Upper Permian laterite of site IR27 from the Alborz Mountains (this study; Muttoni et al. submitted); and the Upper Permian– lower Lower Triassic Hambast and Elikah formations from Abadeh (Gallet et al. 2000) (site HE). The Ruteh lavas studied by Besse et al. (1998), equivalent to the Ruteh lavas studied by Wensink (1979), have been attributed to the Late Permian following stratigraphic considerations from the literature (Besse et al. 1998). In the wellstudied Bear Gully section, these lavas are interbedded in the uppermost part of the Ruteh Formation, biostratigraphically dated to the late Middle Permian (Capitanian) (Gaetani et al. 2009). A Capitanian age for the Ruteh lavas sampled by Besse et al. (1998) is therefore adopted in this study.\n\n20\n\nTable 3. Palaeomagnetic reference poles from West Gondwana and Europe Long.

Ages according to Gradstein et al. (2004).\n\nThe polarities of magnetization of the two entries from the Hambast and Elikah formations are known from magnetostratigraphic correlations with sections from the literature of believed known polarity (Besse et al. 1998; Gallet et al. 2000). Their north palaeomagnetic poles (Fig. 7B, poles H and HE) are significantly displaced with respect to both the West Gondwana and Europe APW paths. This displacement could be owing to variable combinations of plate motion and local vertical-axis tectonic rotations. In order to\n\ndiscriminate between these two sources of displacement, the palaeomagnetic poles have been projected laterally along colatitude small circles, and have been found to intercept younger (Triassic) portions of the West Gondwana APW path (Fig. 7B). This suggests that the observed polar displacement has a main contribution from clockwise vertical-axis tectonic rotations (see also Besse et al. 1998) and a subordinate contribution probably from the plate motion of Iran relative to West Gondwana. Clockwise rotations explain the offset between Iran and\n\nFig. 7. (Continued) Gondwana and Europe are compared with palaeomagnetic poles from the late Middle Permian Ruteh lavas and the Late Permian Hambast Formation of Besse et al.

MUTTONI ET AL.\n\nWest Gondwana poles along colatitude small circles, whereas relative plate motion explains the offset between the projected Iran poles and the coeval Late Permian –Early Triassic West Gondwana reference pole. According to this analysis, the sampled units were located at subequatorial palaeolatitudes (c. 28S + 28 for site H; c. 88S + 1.58 for site HE; Table 2) north of the Arabian margin of West Gondwana in Late Permian –early Early Triassic times (Fig. 8, sites H and HE), whereas the timing of postdepositional clockwise rotation is at present difficult to ascertain. Similar conclusions can also be drawn for the Upper Permian laterite of site IR27. Here, polarity is unknown. Hence, hemisphere of magnetization, and sense and amount of tectonic rotation, cannot be unequivocally determined. However, this constitutes a negligible problem in view of the fact that the characteristic magnetizations therein isolated clearly indicate equatorial palaeolatitudes of either approximately 18S or approximately 18N (+58) (Table 2, site IR27). This also suggests that the Alborz region, within which site IR27 is located, was already detached from the Arabian margin in Late Permian times (Fig. 8, site IR27). The notion derived from the present analysis that the Iranian block(s) had Arabian affinity in the Late Ordovician–earliest Carboniferous and were drifting to the north with respect to Arabia, attaining subequatorial palaeolatitudes in the Late Permian–early Early Triassic, is used to interpret the hemisphere of magnetization acquisition of the late Middle Permian Ruteh lavas, the polarity of which is unknown. The simplest scenario is to assign reverse polarity to its mean magnetization (Dec. ¼ 124.78E, Inc. ¼ 22.68; Table 2). The derived north palaeomagnetic pole is rotated counterclockwise with respect to the West Gondwana polar wander path, and its colatitude small circle intercepts slightly younger portions of the same path (Fig. 7B, pole RL). This implies similar conclusions as those for the Hambast and Elikah formations, i.e. that the observed polar displacement can be accounted for by a combination of vertical-axis tectonic rotations and plate motion. The Alborz region, within which the Ruteh lavas are located, resided at a palaeolatitude of approximately 128S + 28 (Table 2, site RL), slightly to the north of the Arabian margin in late Middle Permian times (Fig. 8, site RL).\n\nLate Early Triassic – Late Triassic: Iran approaching Europe Data from Iran pertaining to this time window come from the characteristic components of Lower Triassic sites IR34 and IR35 from the Sorkh Shale of this study and Wensink (1982) (Fig. 1 and Table 2, site\n\nSS), upper Lower Triassic (Olenekian) sites IR02 and IR04 of this study (site NAK), and the Upper Triassic (lower Norian) Waliaband limestone of Besse et al. (1998) (site W). According to the previous analysis, the Iranian block(s) moved northwards from the southern hemisphere to subequatorial palaeolatitudes during the Permian– early Early Triassic. Hence, the simplest scenario is to envisage a continuation of this northwards motion into the northern hemisphere during the Triassic. Polarity has been assigned to the mean characteristic components of sites IR02 and IR04 according to a northern hemisphere origin of magnetization, and was used to calculate north palaeomagnetic poles (Fig. 7C and Table 2; NAK2 and NAK4, respectively). Pole NAK2 falls very close to the Late Permian– Early Triassic reference pole of Europe. Pole NAK4 is rotated counterclockwise with respect to the APW path of Europe, and, when traced laterally along a colatitude small circle, it falls close to the Late Permian– Early Triassic reference pole of Europe, where pole NAK2 is also located (Fig. 7C). This suggests substantial European affinity of the sampled units and local vertical-axis tectonic rotations of the eastern part of the Nakhlak structure where site IR04 is located. A palaeolatitude of approximately 218N + 48 is derived by combining inclination-only data from both sites (Table 2, pole NAK). This palaeolatitude places the sampled units close to the European margin in late Early Triassic (Olenekian) times (Fig. 8, pole NAK). In a recent analysis, Bagheri & Stampfli (2008) interpreted the Naklakh–Anarak area as part of a ‘Variscan accretionary complex’ pertaining to the Turan domain. If this were the case, the European palaeolatitudes from the Naklakh structure would not be utilizable for the definition of the younger part of the Cimmerian drift history outlined in this study. Data from the Early Triassic Sorkh Shale are more difficult to interpret in terms of hemisphere of magnetization acquisition. Inclination-only data from combined sites IR34 and IR35 indicate a palaeolatitude of approximately 98 + 2.58 (Table 2, site SS1). Wensink (1982) reported a similar palaeolatitude (c. 118 + 88) for Sorkh Shale sites from the same general area of this study, and opted for a southern hemisphere origin of deposition (c. 118S). The substantial lack of constraints on the polarity of magnetization does not preclude, however, a northern hemisphere palaeolatitude, as suggested by Besse et al. (1998). The general drift trend of the Iranian block(s), as described above, is of moderate help in discerning between the two options. Palaeolatitudes from the Hambast and Elikah formations and site IR27 span from approximately 88S to equatorial in the Late Permian–early Early Triassic; late Early Triassic palaeolatitudes from Nakhlak are in the\n\nDRIFT HISTORY OF IRAN\n\norder of about 218N. Palaeolatitudes from the Sorkh Shale are tentatively interpreted as pertaining to the northern hemisphere, in agreement with Besse et al. (1998) (Fig. 8, site SS1), although caution on this interpretation should be maintained essentially\n\n25\n\nbecause of the poor age constraints of the sampled units. Finally, Besse et al. (1998) showed the presence, in sites from the Upper Triassic (lower Norian) Waliaband limestone at Abadeh, of pre-folding\n\nFig. 9.

Africa is internally treated as three plates (NW, NE and S Africa), with Adria (AD in panel B) tectonically coherent with NW Africa (Muttoni et al. 2003). Internal Gondwana plates are reconstructed using Euler poles of Lottes & Rowley (1990). Internal Laurasia plates are reconstructed using Euler poles of Bullard et al. (1965). Palaeolatitudes from Iranian sites discussed in the text and summarized in Table 2 are indicated by error bars and associated acronyms.

Their analysis of inclination-only data produced an overall mean inclination value of 51.98 (a95 ¼ 4.68; Table 2). By assigning normal polarity to this mean inclination, according to a northern hemisphere origin of magnetization acquisition, a colatitude small circle containing the north palaeomagnetic pole has been calculated. This small circle intersects the Middle –Late Triassic portion of the European APW path (Fig. 7C, small circle W) suggesting European affinity for the Waliaband limestone, as originally proposed by Besse et al. (1998). These sites resided at a palaeolatitude of approximately 32.58N + 4.58, close to the European margin in early Norian times (Fig. 8, small circle W). In conclusion, data from this study and the literature suggest that the Iranian block(s) were located close to the Arabian margin of Gondwana in the Late Ordovician–earliest Carboniferous. They have drifted off this margin since the Permian, attained subequatorial palaeolatitudes at Late Permian–early Early Triassic times and approached the Eurasian margin by the late Early Triassic. From then on, the Iranian block(s) maintained European affinity, as deduced from early Norian data and, more generally, from Jurassic–Cretaceous data (e.g. Garedu Red beds, Bidou Beds and Dehuk Sandstones; Wensink 1982), as extensively discussed in Besse et al. (1998).\n\nPalaeogeography The drift history of Iran, outlined in the previous section, has been placed in a general palaeogeographical context by reconstructing the configuration of continents using palaeomagnetic poles from West Gondwana and Europe (Table 3) and Euler poles from the literature (Fig. 9). According to the Ordovician–Carboniferous Gondwana APW path of McElhinny et al. (2003), the Arabian margin as part of Africa experienced significant plate motion, drifting from high southern latitudes in the Late Ordovician to subequatorial latitudes in the Early Devonian, and back to intermediate southern latitudes in the Late Devonian– Early Carboniferous (Fig. 9A). As anticipated in the previous section, Iran tracked closely this motion. The palaeolatitudes expected from the West Gondwana reference palaeopoles at Late Ordovician site IR12, Early Devonian site RB (Red beds) and earliest Carboniferous site GL (Geirud lavas) (Fig. 9A, stars) are in relatively close congruence with the palaeolatitudes calculated from the respective characteristic magnetizations (Fig. 9A, error bars). In the Carboniferous, Gondwana and Laurasia coalesced to form Pangaea. The Early Permian and Late Permian– Early Triassic\n\nPangaea reconstructions of Figure 9B, D, virtually identical to those of Muttoni et al. (2003), bracket a Middle Permian reconstruction (Fig. 9C) obtained by linear interpolation of Early Permian and Late Permian– Early Triassic poles of Table 3. At these times, palaeomagnetic data reveal a grand-scale tectonic scenario consisting of a transformation of Pangaea from an Irvingian B configuration (Irving 1977) in the Early Permian to a Wegenerian A-type configuration by the Late Permian–Early Triassic, as extensively discussed in Muttoni et al. (2003 and references therein). This transformation is coeval with the onset of northward drift of the Iranian block(s) across the Palaeotethys by way of Neotethys opening, depicting altogether an internally consistent plate motion scenario that is the subject of a parallel paper (Muttoni et al. submitted). Key elements of this northward drift are palaeolatitude estimates from the late Middle Permian Ruteh lavas (RL), the Late Permian – early Early Triassic Hambast and Elikah formations (H, HE), and the Late Permian site IR27 (Fig. 9C, D). Finally, palaeolatitudes from the late Early Triassic sites IR02 and IR04 from Nakhlak support an incipient approach of the Iranian block(s) with the active margin of Eurasia in the frame of an Early– Middle Triassic Pangaea configuration of the A-type (Fig. 9E, NAK).\n\nConclusions Palaeomagnetic data from this study and the literature have been used to reconstruct the drift history of the Iranian block(s) from the Ordovician to the Triassic. Key elements of this reconstruction are: † a robustly determined palaeomagnetic affinity of Iran with Arabia (Gondwana) during the Late Ordovician–earliest Carboniferous; † clear palaeomagnetic evidence for the residence of Iran on subequatorial palaeolatitudes during the Late Permian –early Early Triassic, noticeably disengaged from both the parental Gondwanan margin in the southern hemisphere and the espousal Laurasian margin in the northern hemisphere. On these two elements is based the interpretation of pre-Late Permian latitudes from Iran as pertaining to the southern hemisphere, and post-early Early Triassic latitudes as pertaining to the northern hemisphere. The resulting scenario is that of a relatively rapid northward drift that brought the Iranian block(s) to cover approximately 2500–3000 km of Palaeotethys in about 35 Ma (from c. 280 Ma in the Early Permian to c. 245 Ma at the end of the late Early Triassic), at an average plate speed of approximately 7 –8 cm year21. This motion was largely coeval to, and kinematically linked with,\n\nDRIFT HISTORY OF IRAN\n\nthe transformation of Pangaea from an Irvingian B to a Wegenerian A-type configuration (Muttoni et al. 2003, submitted). The spatio-temporal resolution of the observed northward drift does not allow distinguishing components of relative motion between crustal blocks (e.g. Alborz v. Tabas v. Sanandaj–Sirjan). Despite these and other uncertainties (e.g. the possible Turanian rather than Cimmerian affinity of Naklakh: Bagheri & Stampfli 2008), the overall drift history outlined above is in broad agreement with geological data. Several authors pointed out the Proterozoic –Palaeozoic Gondwanan ancestry of north and central Iran based on the nature of their basement and the overlying sedimentary succession (Sto¨cklin 1968, 1974; Berberian & King 1981; Wendt et al. 2005). Zanchi et al. (2009b) pointed out that north and central Iran are entirely located south of the Eo-Cimmerian belt, which marks the collision of Iran with the southern Eurasian margin (e.g. Sengo¨r 1990; Zanchi et al. 2006).
