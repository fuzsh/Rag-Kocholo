        "text": "All fittings and flanges are subject to strict inspection at each stage of the production process, from starting material purchasing to product dispatch. They are visually examined for conformity to ASTM, ASME, MSS, DIN, EN, and JIS codes and standards. Upon request, official certified Inspection Agencies can be called in to witness the material reports, dimensions and quality conformity of products.\n\nProducts are packaged to ensure that there is no damage during transit. In case of exports, standard export packaging is done in wooden cases. All buttweld fittings are marked with Grade, Lot No, Size, Degree and our trade mark. On special requests we can also, make custom marking on our products.#Protected by End Caps."
