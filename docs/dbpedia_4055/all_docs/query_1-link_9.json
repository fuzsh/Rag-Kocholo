If you want to get closer, 7.739509 is closer without going over, but not exact.\n\nIrrational numbers between 2 and 2.5?\n\nThere are infinitely many of them. They include square root of (4.41) square root of (4.42) square root of (4.43) square root of (4.44) square root of (4.45) square root of (5.3) square root of (5.762) square root of (6) square root of (6.1) square root of (6.2)\n\nWhat is the square root of 20 in simplest form?\n\nsquare root of 20 = square root of 4 * square root of 5. square root of 4 = 2, so your answer is 2 square root of 5.\n\nWhat is the difference between principal square root and perfect square root?\n\nA principal square root is any square root that's answer is positive, and a perfect square root is a square root that's answer is an integer.\n\nIs 63 a square root?\n\nWe will walk through the definition of the square root of 63, find out whether the square root of 63 is rational or irrational, and see how to find the square root of 63 by the long division method. ... Square Root of 63."
