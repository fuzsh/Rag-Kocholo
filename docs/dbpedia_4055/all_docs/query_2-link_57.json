This thesis examines insulation coordination practices for high voltage transmission lines in Turkey, with a focus on tower top geometry and ground clearances. It critically evaluates Turkey's national regulation on this topic. The regulation lags behind modern practices and can lead to uneconomical designs. Possible benefits of modern practices are demonstrated through examples. The document also reviews internal clearances at tower tops, shielding angles against lightning strikes, phase spacing considerations regarding ice and wind, and ground clearance requirements and restrictions. It aims to identify areas where the national regulation could be improved to better align with international best practices.",
