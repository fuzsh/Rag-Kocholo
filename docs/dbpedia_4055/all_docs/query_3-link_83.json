        "text": "Poppies and a field of wheat. There's a finite time for both and each have their merits when seen close up or from further away.\n\nHello there. Relevant comments welcome but please do NOT post any link(s). All my images are my own original work, under my copyright, with all rights reserved. You need my permission to use any image for ANY purpose.\n\nCopyright infringement is theft.\n\nI'm posting this one early for two reasons. Firstly, I have a heavy week at work so I don't know how much time I'll have to get out with my camera. Secondly, this week saw three of my pics make it into Explore. I'm absolutely blown away by the response I've had this week, and it's all down to my wonderful contacts who take the time to comment and fave. I can't thank you all enough! :-) xx\n\nThis shot is a bit of a nod to my all time favourite film (I'm obsessed with classical history and am halfway through a degree on the subject). It didn't come out quite as well as I envisioned, but it taught me a few nifty processing tricks along the way, which is part of what doing this project is all about. ;-)\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Owg-NaUoHHo\n\nbetter large-Beautiful late summer afternoon in Kansas as we were driving through. The golden fields of wheat throughout the heartland of America are beautiful all over the prairie states during this season. Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, and some parts of Montana...among others really have the wheat fields.\n\nThe cloud formations at sunset and sunrise are magnificent in contrast to the fields as the changing light brings all types of contrasts and colors to play. I personally like the contrast between the green of the grass or other crops with the golden wheat. I WILL come back here and explore the plains fully on my motorcycle!\n\nThere Is No Sorrow In The Grave (JHWatkins 2/6/10)\n\nThere is no sorrow in the grave,\n\nOr grief where death is overcome.\n\nThere is no strife where suffering\n\nAnd shallow mourning are stopped\n\nAnd stayed.\n\nIn living we press and battle on,\n\nWhere mercy alone can repair,\n\nOr redeem lost cause,\n\nThe innocent crushed, or\n\nThe wounded soul in despair.\n\nThe battle may give hope,\n\nMoving on and through,\n\nTo path where sunlight plays,\n\nA bright day’s dawn,\n\nSwift and strong,\n\nIn brief haven rest delays.\n\nTo bring us fact to face,\n\nFrom here we must begin,\n\nTo right the wrong\n\nWe must have done,\n\nTo bring us round again.\n\nAnd with mercy’s mirror,\n\nThat which has been given\n\nAgain and again-\n\nFreely pass the blessing on-\n\nThough duly won\n\nBy perseverance and pain.\n\nWithout return or favor named,\n\nGrant that which we did not,\n\nOr in our time did not restrain-\n\nA heavenly gift tendered-\n\nAnd A Life-\n\nRegained!\n\n(JHWatkins 02-06-2010)\n\nbetter large-Beautiful late summer afternoon in Kansas as we were driving through.

In the spring or summer this could be the beginning of a tornado, but here just brings heavy wind and rain. The midwest plain states are famous for their thunderheads, torrential rain, and high winds. Traveling through here we really loved the contrast in colors and the soft sunset sky behind the clouds. 0130!\n\nFOR THOSE INTERESTED I HAVE AN EXHIBITION AT THIS LINK <a href=\" www.flickr.com/groups/inspiringcollection/discuss/7215762...\n\nTHE CURSE DID NOT COME UPON SATURN\n\n(JHWatkins)\n\nThe Curse did not come upon Saturn,\n\nNor cover the planets and stars-\n\nBut came to the earth like the lightning\n\nThat signals the start of a storm.\n\nIt blanketed beautiful valleys\n\nBuilt in creation’s fire-\n\nThen moved ‘cross the hills\n\nIn a torrent-\n\nWhich in rapid, recession-retired.\n\nHating the heart of the future-\n\nDespising all hope and desire-\n\nErasing eons of dreaming,\n\nWith planning and patience conspired.\n\nTo bring captivity captive-\n\nTo worship a fallen king-\n\nTo drain the last drop,\n\nOf life and light-\n\nTo crush creativity.\n\nSuch serpentine monstrosity,\n\nWill never be wrought again.\n\nPlans will unfold,\n\nBut missing their mark,\n\nWill cease to be brought\n\nTo their end.\n\nThe ignorant souls\n\nOf the dancers-\n\nThat danced with the\n\nSword and the wheel-\n\nAnd plowed in the fields\n\nOf the broken-\n\nWill never be heard from\n\nAgain.\n\nDeceivers will flourish\n\nAnd be no more.\n\nLiars will all pass away.\n\nDeath and destruction\n\nWill struggle and strain-\n\nThen fail at the force\n\nOf the flame.\n\nThe heavens are still\n\nRejoicing.\n\nThe stars in their glory\n\nStill sing.\n\nRepeating the strain,\n\nOf original song-\n\nEtched in aged memory.\n\nClothed in magnificent color-\n\nReveling in royal plans.\n\nRevealing from the beginning-\n\nThe art of the Master’s hands.\n\nAs servants new, now recreate-\n\nEnvision inhabited lands.\n\nBy suffering tried, have spoken\n\nThe word-\n\nAnd left their trail in the sand.\n\nAnd passing beyond the physical door-\n\nNow come to a heavenly land.\n\nWhere monuments new of faith reside-\n\nAnd sacred spirits stand.\n\nA city of golden glory-\n\nWhere day and night descend-\n\nIn the light of the great Creator-\n\nWhose promise will never end.\n\nTime itself will flicker and fade,\n\nThe fire of the universe wane-\n\nProvidence then will have the last word.-\n\nAnd truth once more\n\nFall like rain.\n\nJames Watkins 11-04"
