This document is the preface to \"Historical Dictionary of the Hittites\" by Charles Burney. It discusses the challenges of compiling a dictionary on the vast subject of the Hittites and their civilization. The preface notes that individual judgment was required in selecting topics as no two authors would choose the same entries. It also acknowledges the many fields of research that contribute to understanding the Hittites and thanks those who provided assistance in creating the dictionary.",
