        "text": "This paper reflects the importance of cooperation and treaties of good proximity in order to solve the environmental problems occurred in the Black Sea. Ten years ago, an accident discharged a major amount of oil in the coastal area of Turkey. The attempts of remediation changed the local water chemical composition. This led to the emergence and overgrowth of some invasive species. Many European studies and specially created commissions analyze the possible solutions to solve the problem affecting Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Ukraine, and Russian seaside. The present paper structured into five parts presents some aspects registered along the Black Sea coastal shore into the south part of Romania, near the Bulgarian border. There are mentioned some major physical modifications, appeared in the last decade, due to uncontrolled erosion and several collapses of the cliffs. Further, there are presented some measurements and samples collected, during three consecutive years. The Black Sea represents a key interface between the European Union and the former Soviet countries and a direct connection by the Turkish Channel with the Mediterranean Sea. Thus, a healthy environment of the Black Sea represents a priority for the entire Europe. A special paragraph shows the endangered species because of the different modifications of the water quality and the new environmental conditions. Some measurements regarding the regulation of the international fishing regime, and the exploitation of the infrastructure developed (gas pipeline which traverses the Black Sea) are also mentioned. Conclusions and references finish the article.\n\nAs a result of eutrophication caused by increased nutrient input via major northwestern rivers during the last few decades, the Black Sea ecosystem has been subject to extreme changes in recent years. Abnormal changes due to altered nutrient balance were reflected in the qualitative and quantitative composition of phytoplankton, zooplankton and also ichthyofauna. The present study was carried out in the central Black Sea coast of Turkey to recognition of the current status of fish fauna. Fish specimens examined in this study were obtained from the shore and offshore of Sinop-Samsun coast between 1997 and 2004, collecting from the commercial catch of vessels at sea or by SCUBA. A total of 94 species belonging to 44 families were identified. Acipenser persicus is recorded for the first time from the central Black Sea of Turkey. Previous records of the species were confined to the eastern part of the Black Sea, it is occurrence at Turkish coast of the Black Sea extends its distribution..."
