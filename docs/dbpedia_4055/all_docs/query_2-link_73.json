On the other hand, during those dates, speleology was accepted as both a sport and a discipline all around the world for a long time. Apart from the works and studies carried out in other countries, even in Turkey, there were numerous speleological and biospeleological researches carried out by foreigners years ago or ongoing on those dates. Various foreign explorers and academicians had already published numerous articles and even books about the caves of Turkey. After all these years, the number of speleological associations in Turkey has reached 18 today and numerous different associations, including the governmental organizations, are actively caving. In the preface of proceedings of the 1. National Speleology Symposium in 1990, Prof. Mustafa Aktar had stated that “Speleology, by extending to numerous areas such as sport, art, and tourism during its development process which started with science has achieved a cultural structure. And in Turkey, the number of people involved in this area as a profession or as an amateur interest has increased and organizations have emerged.” Indeed, with the efforts of all these new associations and organizations, over the years, hundreds of new caves have been explored and researched. Not only with the newly explored caves, but also with the new branches of the previously explored caves, the lengths and depths of the caves constantly change each year. Even during the writing phase of this book, we have witnessed the change of the list of the longest and deepest caves. Independent from all these explorations performed, numerous different scientiﬁc studies are being carried out in recent years related to the caves of Turkey. The works and studies in the areas of cave biology and paleoclimatology, which have gained a huge acceleration especially in recent years, are a sign of the bright and promising future of the scientiﬁc cave studies in Turkey. Various researches are being carried out in recent years regarding these issues, and numerous articles have been published. Likewise, in the area of cave archaeology, rather than old-style rough researches, precise scientiﬁc works and studies are being carried out. Due to the rapidly developing new techniques, not only in the archaeological excavations but also in the dating and DNA tests, striking results are being achieved. This book explains the geology, hydrogeology, and exploration stories of 45 caves of Turkey, chosen among the thousands of caves explored and researched until now. Additionally, the ﬁndings of 20 caves chosen among 90 archaeological caves researched or excavated until now are explained in a separate chapter. However, as explained comprehensively in Chap. 4 of this book, the karstic area of Turkey is larger than the total area of numerous countries and for a country with such a large karstic area, neither the number of the speleological associations existing today, nor the number of explorations and scientiﬁc works carried out is sufﬁcient. This country, which has tens of thousands of unexplored caves, requires a signiﬁcant acceleration in the areas of both scientiﬁc\n\nv\n\nvi\n\nPreface\n\nand sportive cave explorations and cave archaeology and more importantly needs academic organizations to carry out karst and cave works and studies. We wish that this book enlightens the immensity of the work required to be carried out and hope that it will form a basis for the new researches.

He was born in 1957 and caving since 1976. He had explored and surveyed hundreds of caves during those years, of which some are among the deepest and longest caves of Turkey. He was President of Speleological Federation of Turkey during 2007–2009 and President during the establishment of three different caving organizations. He was the leader of the team who had prepared the Cave Inventory of Turkey. In addition to his natural cave explorations, as a part of his artiﬁcial cave projects, he had explored and surveyed numerous underground cities and rock dwelled settlements around different regions of Turkey. Eric Gilli is a French karstologist. He was born in 1957 and studied geology and physical geography in Nice, Paris, and Aix-Marseille. Formerly a consultant in Nice, he has been since 2001 Professor at the Geography Department at the University of Paris 8. His main topics are hydrogeology, karst, caves, groundwater, palaeo-environments, earthquakes, tsunamis, and natural disasters. He has also been involved in shipwreck explorations and troglodyte studies. His international studies have taken him to many parts of world. Ezgi Tok is a Turkish speleologist. Her research is focused on microbial life in cave environments. She explored several caves all over Turkey to reveal the microbial diversity, the ecosystem functioning of microbial populations, and their relation with the psychochemical conditions within the cave ecosystem. She had been caving since 2007 and joined several national and international speleological expeditions in Turkey and foreign. She also had surveyed and mapped several caves of Turkey; among them İnsuyu Cave, which is the longest, and Kocain Cave, which is the largest chamber of Turkey, are especially important. Koray Törk is a speleologist and karst hydrogeologist working in most of the karst areas of Turkey. He jointed to Cave Research Association (MAD) as a caver and then have been Member of Mineral Research and Exploration of Turkey (MTA) as a speleologist. He has been working predominantly on karst base natural hazards (sinkhole collapse/obruk) and cave protection for more than ten years.\n\nix\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAKUMAK ASPEG BSU BUMAD BÜMAK CMN FSE ITUMAK LUSS MAD MTA OBRUK SCP TMF UIS\n\nAkdeniz University Caving Club Anatolian Speleology Group Balkan Speleological Union Boğaziçi International Speleology Association Boğaziçi University Speleological Society Club Martel de Nice European Speleological Federation Istanbul Technical University Speleology Club Leicester University Speleological Society Cave Research Association General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration Obruk Cave Research Group Speleo Club de Paris Speleological Federation of Turkey International Union of Speleology\n\nxi\n\n1\n\nSpeleology in Turkey\n\nAbstract\n\nExcluding individual studies of some researchers, speleological researches in Turkey started very late, in the 1960s, and they were largely conducted by foreign cavers until a very recent date, the 1980s. In this period and after, numerous caves were found in the Taurus Mountains through the explorations by foreign cavers. The current state of Turkish caving that accelerated only after the 1980s is not enough for a country with such a large karstic area. There are only 18 caving organizations in Turkey, and they generally work without a long-term plan and can not conduct full regional surveys. Despite these negative facts, about 3000 caves were researched and surveyed in the past 40–50 years.\n\n1.1\n\nPrecursors\n\nThe ﬁrst known cave research in Turkey is conducted by Dr. Abdullah Bey in Yarımburgaz Cave, near İstanbul. He was born in Vienna in 1801 as Karl Eduard Hammerschmidt. As a multidisciplinary intellectual, Hammerschmidt was an Austrian geologist, entomologist, and physician. After getting his law degree from the University of Vienna in 1827, he studied medicine with an emphasis on anesthesiology. He became a medical doctor in 1837 and worked both as a zoology teacher and a surgeon at the University of Vienna (Fig. 1.1). He joined the uprising also known as the Vienna Revolution in 1848. After the suppression of the uprising, he entered Turkey along with other revolutionaries from Hungary and was employed as a teacher of medicine, zoology, and mineralogy in the medical school of Istanbul. When Austria demanded Turkey to deport him, he was transferred to Damascus where he worked as a hospital physician. In this term of his life, Hammerschmidt converted to Islam and\n\ntook on the name “Abdullah Bey.” He served in the Turkish army during the Crimean War. In 1862, he joined the faculty of medicine in Istanbul, teaching geology, mineralogy, and zoology. He founded the Natural History Museum of the Imperial Medical School of Constantinople, with many fossils he gathered around Istanbul over many years. One of the new species found among these fossils was given the name “Cryphaeus abdullahi.” He was among the founders of the Turkish Red Crescent. He died in 1874 in Istanbul. In his short article, “Die Umgebung des See’s Kütchücktschekmetché in Rumelien” which was published in the 12. issue of “Verhandlungen der k.k. Geologischen Reichsanstalt,” Abdullah Bey explains the examinations he performed in Yarımburgaz Cave near Istanbul. In his article, Abdullah Bey, who found the Yarımburgaz Cave while performing geological research in the area, explains the chambers, the steps, the structure resembling an altar stone, and the arched cells carved in the rocks found at the cave entrance. He roughly gives the measurements of this area and writes about thinking of this place to be a living quarter or a secret meeting place for people in ages past. Walking a few hundred steps in the main gallery, Abdullah Bey explains the speleothems he encounters in detail (Bey, 1869). Three years after the publication of this ﬁrst article of his, Abdullah Bey’s second article named “Études Géologiques sur les Environs de Constantinople. Yarym-Bourgas, Macri-Keuy, Sary-Keuy” was published in Gazette Médicale d’Orient. This second article is quite different from the previous one and almost completely focuses on geology. He writes about having visited the Yarımburgaz Cave again during the three years between his articles and notes having traveled 250 m into the cave taking measurements and examining rock formations, even though he could not have reached the end of the cave. He writes that the area was composed of Miocene old limestone and he lists and names the fossils he ﬁnds in the area. He explains some of these fossils he\n\n© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 A.

Rabius Bousquet’s article “Les Grottes de YarimBourgas,” which was published in the Echos d’Orient journal in 1901, is an unexpectedly incompetent expedition report considering its name. In the two-page article, he tells about points of interest between Istanbul and the Yarımburgaz Cave, gives a general description of the upper entrance of the cave but almost completely skips progressing in the main gallery (Bousquet, 1901). The French caver E.A. Martel came to Turkey in 1910 and visited few caves near Konya, Sille, and Ankara (Martel, 1911). In his Turkish article called “How to Survey a Cave and a Visit to Yarımburgaz Cave” published in 1918 in the journal Tedrisat Mecmuası, Harun Reşit Kocacan explains in detail how a cave should be examined scientiﬁcally. Although he reached the end of the Yarımburgaz Cave, a map for the cave could not have been drawn (Kocacan, 1918). While different researchers were trying to examine the Yarımburgaz Cave, two archaeologists started much more serious and scientiﬁc cave research in southern Anatolia, Antalya. As one of the losing parties of World War I, the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros in 1918. Parallel to this agreement, the Italian army occupied southern Anatolia and Antalya in 1919. Italian archaeologists who arrived in the area with the army had explored and researched many ancient settlements until the end of the occupation in 1921. Being different from archaeologist Vittorio\n\n1 Speleology in Turkey\n\nViale’s archaeological excavation in Gurma Cave (Viale, 1925–26), Giuseppe Moretti’s research in Kocain Cave can be considered both an extensive cave exploration and a survey. Moretti, who conducted an ancient city research north of Antalya around Camili Village, was told that there were no ruins in the vicinity when he reached the area. On the other hand, Ahmet Aga, who lived alone in a valley northeast of Camili Village as a woodcutter, mentioned Moretti about a huge cave found in the mountains with writings in it. Spending the night in the area over this information, Moretti and his team reached Kocain on July 30, 1919. After a rough examination, Moretti understood that this research would take long and returned, to come back to Kocain again on September 5, 1919 (Fig. 1.2). Professor Azeglio Berretti from the Museum of Rome also attended this second expedition. Having measured the cave, Moretti writes in his article “In Daghindà Quogia In, La Grande Caverna nella Montagna delle Caverne” which was published in “Annuario del la Reale Scuola Archeologica di Atene” in 1924, that the cave entrance is 60 meters wide and 15 meters high. He speciﬁes that the width of the cave changes between 50 and 60 m and height was around 25 m throughout the gallery. As the measurements taken from the hall start to get wider at the end of the gallery, the error rate increases a little bit more. Not being able to see the ceiling from that point on, Moretti could not comment on the height and only writes that it has “very unusual dimensions.” He measures the diameter of the column, which resides behind the hill 150 meters farther from the point where the cave rotates toward the south, to be 12–13 m. Moretti draws the cistern and the inscriptions found inside the cave and also takes many pictures. The Kocain map published in his article is the very ﬁrst cave map drawn in Anatolia. Even though there are differences between Moretti’s map and other\n\nFig. 1.2 Kocain Cave from the ﬁrst chamber toward the entrance. Dated 1919, this is possibly one of the earliest photographs of a cave in Turkey (Moretti, 1923–1924)\n\n1.1 Precursors\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.4 Map of Yarımburgaz Cave (Hovasse, 1927)\n\nFig. 1.3 Map of Kocain Cave (Moretti, 1923–1924)\n\nKocain maps drawn later, it is admirable in terms of the applied technique and delicacy (Fig. 1.3) (Moretti, 1923– 1924). Following Moretti’s Kocain Cave map, ongoing research since 1869 on Yarımburgaz Cave also reaches a happy conclusion. Professor Raymond Hovasse publishes an extensive article about this cave and draws a map of it in 1927 (Fig. 1.4). Born in France in 1895, Hovasse concluded his education in 1919 which was disrupted by World War I and started to work in Sorbonne University Histology Laboratory the following year. With an invitation from foreign affairs ministry, he started giving zoology lectures in Istanbul University Science Faculty and continued his lectures until leaving the country in 1932. During his time in Istanbul, Hovasse established the Baltalimanı Zoology Station and published nine different articles (Kadioğlu, 2003). His ﬁrst published article “Yarımburgaz Mağarası (La Grotte de Yarım Bourgas)” was published in Istanbul University Science Faculty Journal in 1927. In this systematical research he conducted with Prof. René Jeannel, he measured, drew, and took pictures of every formation carved inside the rocks found within the upper cave (Fig. 1.5). He made a thorough geological and hydrogeological examination of the cave and\n\nFig. 1.5 Detailed plan of the ﬁrst two chambers of Yarımburgaz Cave showing the apsis of the church and niches carved from the main rock (Hovasse, 1927)\n\nrealized that the underground creek flowing through the cave went further down in time and carved the Yarımburgaz Cave, shaping it into a vadose state. The most important part of this 26-page article is about the life forms inside the cave, which is Jeannel’s area of expertise. He explains 17 different life forms he encountered, one by one and in detail. Among\n\n4\n\nthese, there are two different types of bats. Other than these two different types he identiﬁed as Rhinolophus Ferrumequinum and Miniopterus Schraibersi Mapfre, he found 15 different types of insects. Among these, especially two types of troglobites, Glomeridae and Collembola stand out the most (Hovasse, 1927) . As far as we know, after this thorough study of Hovasse, there had not been such extensive speleological research in Turkey for many years. After the aforementioned Yarımburgaz Cave map, the third cave map to be drawn in Turkey is Hans Henning von der Osten’s simple sketch of a cave explored near Erzincan–Kemaliye in 1927 (Von der Osten, 1929). All the speleological explorations conducted in Turkey after the 1920s play second string to “cave archaeology” mentioned in Chap. 2 and “biospeleology” mentioned in Chap. 3. Archaeologists conducting researches in caves had done some cave surveys in this period, but these studies are far from including any geological and geomorphological data. The same problem is also encountered in biospeleological researches. Even though Şevket Aziz Kansu’s assistant archaeologist Kılıç Kökten examined and drew maps during the İnönü Caves archaeological excavations that began in 1938, these studies could not go further than being a tool for these excavations (Kansu, 1939). In a contemporary sense, speleological studies in Turkey began with Temuçin Aygen (1921–2003). Aygen is considered to be the founder of Turkish speleology in both a scientiﬁc and a sportive sense, as he transformed cave sports and studies to be understood as teamwork (Fig. 1.6). MAD, which he founded and became the founding president of, is the ﬁrst cave association in Turkey (Altay, 2007). Aygen traveled around Anatolia for almost 50 years and displayed an amazing work in terms of registering and protecting hundreds of caves he explored during that time. Aside from the fact that he explored many of the most important and well-known caves in Turkey, many caves started being protected and ﬁve different areas have “national park” status thanks to him (Aygen, 1988). As a graduate of the University of Geneva, Faculty of Geology, Aygen got his doctorate from the University of Istanbul Faculty of Geology in 1951 and started working as a geologist in MTA the same year. From 1952 and onward, he conducted researches in various regions of Turkey on water distribution of karstic areas and the productivity of hydroelectricity plants. He started taking an interest in caves during these researches. He went to France and Sweden to examine hydroelectricity plants and hydrogeology in 1958 and explored his interest in cave sciences even further, contacting speleology organizations in these countries. He published his ﬁrst book on caves in Turkey and caves of the world, the following year (Aygen, 1959). This is the ﬁrst book in the ﬁeld of speleology in Turkey, and it describes\n\n1 Speleology in Turkey\n\nFig. 1.6 Temuçin Aygen in Narlıkuyu Cave (Aygen, 1984)\n\ncaves like Maraspoli Cave, Karagöl Sinkhole, and Damlataş Cave which were explored and surveyed by Aygen. Other than this work, Aygen had six published books, 92 articles, and 11 presentations in various international conferences (Erdem, 2013). Following the establishment of MAD in 1964, Temuçin Aygen invited French cavers to Turkey and together they explored hundreds of caves throughout many different regions of Anatolia since 1965.\n\n1.2\n\nCollaboration with European Associations\n\nIn the period following the establishment of MAD in 1964, Temuçin Aygen contacts foreign cavers and scholars for Turkey’s speleological opportunities to be researched as scientiﬁcally as possible. It is highly possible that both studying in Switzerland and the insufﬁciencies he detected\n\n1.2 Collaboration with European Associations\n\nduring his 10 years of studying caves in Turkey led him to decide to work with foreigners. The ﬁrst serious contact with foreign science people was made at the International Conference of Speleology and Karstology which was organized in Istanbul between the 24th and 26th of September 1964. Over 20 globally well-known foreign scholars on the ﬁeld of speleology like Norbert Casteret, Paul Fenelon, Joseph Newell Jennings, Claude Drogue, Claude Pommier, and Kuchta Gijula attended this conference. After the three-day conference, attendees took a ﬁeld trip across Anatolia through Ankara, Konya, Mersin, Antalya, Burdur, Izmir, and Bursa for 2 weeks. Thus, they had the opportunity to investigate the principal karstic phenomena of Turkey: Konya dolines, travertines of Yerköprü and Antalya, caves of Mersin region, vauclusian springs of Manavgat. The interest of these occurrences of Anatolian karst is unquestionable; in addition to the scientiﬁc problems they pose, they represent a great economic value either as tourist centers or as producers of electric energy and sources of water for irrigation (Fenelon, 1968). On the other hand, again with the invitation of Temuçin Aygen, foreign cavers came to Turkey and began their cave studies in 1965. Three different SCP member teams researched the vicinity around Konya–Antalya–Beyşehir. In this ﬁrst research, previously known caves such as Maraspoli, Yerköprü, Insuyu, and Cennet–Cehennem were examined and surveyed again. Some of the answers to Aygen’s cave survey forms, which were previously sent to villages, were analyzed in this same study. This led to the discovery of Pınargözü Cave and mapping of two large caves: Yalan Dünya and Toy Islam (Couderc, Pelon, & Conrau, 1965). The team which came the following year started studying the caves and aquifers around Manavgat Gorge, which completely consists of limestone, for the construction of the Oymapınar Dam. Dumanlı Spring, which resides on the eastern shore of this gorge, was submerged under the dam lake waters after the construction and has an outflow of 50 m3/s in the high season. It was tried to be reached from the caves above Dumanlı and some other aquifers. The challenging Altınbeşik Cave, which resides west of the Manavgat River, was discovered and surveyed the same year (C. Chabert, 1966). Altınbeşik Cave was re-surveyed and remapped three times more in the following years. French cavers’ studies with Temuçin Aygen around Antalya– Manavgat River continued in 1967. Düden, Kelebekli, Güvercin, Koyungöbedi, Çayırönü, and several other caves were explored and surveyed. Michel Bakalowicz’s hydrogeological research around Manavgat at that time would later be his Ph.D. thesis (Bakalowicz, 1967; C. Chabert, 1967). 1968 and 1969 were the years SCP worked in both Manavgat Region and Pınargözü Cave. Pınargözü Cave’s research was still under progress in 1968. The cave had\n\n5\n\nreached 1800 m in length and +30 m of height. Many other caves like Zindan, Tınaztepe, Değirmenlik, and Düdencik were also surveyed. Among these, with a depth of −330 m, Düdencik Sinkhole was the deepest cave in Turkey for 30 years until the beginning of the Çukurpınar Sinkhole research in 1989 (Bakalowicz, 1968). French cavers discovered, surveyed, mapped, and published 74 caves in the ﬁrst ﬁve years they worked in Turkey. More importantly, they found big and important caves like Pınargözü, Tınaztepe, and Altınbeşik and they conducted geological and hydrogeological studies in detail in the Mid-Taurus Range. Spanish cavers went through Ayvaini Cave from end to end and drew a rough map of this phreatic traverse cave in 1970 (Fig. 1.7) (Agnoletti, Baldieri, Fiorentini, & Ortensi, 1970). A highly detailed map of this cave would be drawn by Claude Chabert many years later. SCP, CMN and English cavers reached 3220 m in length and +190 m of height in Pınargözü Cave in a joint venture in the same year. The heat in the cave was 10.5 °C, and water had a temperature of 6 °C in August 1970. It had countless waterfalls to be climbed and 3 siphons which were required to be dived in (Fig. 1.8). It had become so hard for the French team to work in the Pınargözü Cave, and they started searching for a sinkhole on Dedegöl Mountain to reach the cave from above. In this ﬁrst year of the work, which would take many more years, 8 different sinkholes were found and examined but it was understood that none of them had a connection to the Pınargözü Cave. Explorations around the Manavgat Gorge were under progress the same year; Yedi Miyarlar aquifers were being studied, and Susuz Cave, which was discovered the previous year, was explored (Bakalowicz, 1970; C. Chabert, 1970) . Two different highly crowded teams which consisted of French and English cavers reached 5275 m in length and +248 m of height in Pınargözü Cave at the end of their studies in 1971 and 1972. The cave was not completely studied, but the survey which began in 1965 was ﬁnalized after seven years, in 1972. The ongoing search for a connection on Dedegöl Mountain was left without a result, even though ﬁve other sinkholes were found. Other than Pınargözü Cave, 23 caves were studied and 14 caves were mapped during these years. Important caves like Susuz Cave, Eskiyörük Cave, Ferzine Cave, and Gölcük Sinkhole were among these (C. Chabert, 1972a, 1972b) . A total of 131 caves were discovered and explored by French cavers between 1965 and 1972. Previously found 25 caves, some of which were not completely examined, were surveyed in 1973. Among these, the survey and mapping of Kayaağıl Doline, which is the biggest doline in Turkey, and Felengi Cave, are important. Kayaağıl Doline is a huge collapsed doline, which has 500 m on its long edge and −160 m of depth, with a forest at its ground (Dobrilla, 1977). SCP and CMN continued\n\n6\n\n1 Speleology in Turkey\n\nFig. 1.7 First traverse of Ayvaini Cave (Agnoletti et al., 1970)\n\nstudies in the Dedegöl Mountain and Manavgat River Basin in 1974 (C. Chabert, 1975) and further investigations on the west block of Manavgat River in 1976. Kembos and Eynif poljes, and sinkholes around the vicinity were measured and mapped. Fifteen different caves were studied in 1976, and the most important activity of this season was the discovery and measurement of Tilkiler Cave (Fig. 1.9). It was measured to be 2755 m on this ﬁrst survey of the cave (C. Chabert, 1976). On Temuçin Aygen’s call, SCP and CMN go to Black Sea Region in 1977 to research caves that Aygen discovered with English cavers between 1975 and 1976. There were nine caves around Zonguldak which were previously known but not surveyed. Among them were long caves previously known and entered by Spanish cavers (Masriera & Martorell, 1971) and Aygen: like Gökgöl, Cumayanı, Kızılelma, and Ilıksu caves. Along with some other small caves, Cumayanı Cave’s ﬁrst survey and mapping were conducted on this study (C. Chabert, 1977). After this research in the Black Sea Region, they returned to the Taurus Mountains. Over 20 sinkholes and caves were discovered and surveyed in Avason and Sevinc districts. New caves were found in Manavgat–Oymapınar Dam area, and studies in Tilkiler Cave were continued. After measuring, this cave was revealed to be 4845 m and became Turkey’s\n\nFig. 1.8 In front of the ﬁrst waterfall at Pınargözü Cave during the fourth year of exploration, 1970 (Photograph C. Chabert)\n\nlongest mapped cave. Another interesting activity of the same year was French cavers’ re-survey of the Kocain Cave even though it is not in the same region. This enormous chamber researched by Temuçin Aygen in 1972 is measured and mapped again 55 years after Moretti. It can be said that the year of 1977 is the most successful one of the 12 years for SCP members and other French cavers since they began research in Turkey in 1965, not in the numeric sense but the aspect of productivity (C. Chabert, Callot, Chabert, & Gilli, 1978). The following year 5585 m was reached in the Tilkiler Cave, and it became one of the longest conglomerate caves of the world. Furthermore, some small sinkholes like Akpınar, Tefekli, Erkibet, and newly found caves around the Manavgat River were surveyed and mapped. The total of caves researched in 1978 was 15 (J. Chabert, 1979; Gilli, 1979). Trent Polytechnic Speleological Society working in the Black Sea Region surveyed and mapped the Kızılelma Cave found in Zonguldak; total length of the cave was 6250 m, and a possible connection with Cumayanı Cave had been found. 2970-m-long Gokgol Cave, 2725-m-long Bulak Mencilis Cave, and 1085-m-long Cumayanı Cave were also\n\n1.2 Collaboration with European Associations\n\n7\n\nFig. 1.10 Sakaltutan 1 Cave, 1979 (Photograph E. Gilli) Fig. 1.9 Big Lake of Tilkiler Cave, 1976 (Photograph E. Gilli)\n\nsurveyed in this work of Trent Polytechnic (Watkins, 1980). These four caves were re-surveyed and remapped, and new branches of them had been found in the following years. French cavers surveyed over 1000 m more in Tilkiler Cave in 1979, and it became the second-longest conglomerate cave of the world with a total length of 6600 m. The same year, two sinkholes were discovered in Süleymaniye Village near Akseki. The research on these two sinkholes named Sakaltutan no. 1 and no. 2, which are very close to each other, would be completed the following year (Fig. 1.10). As an interesting coincidence, Sakaltutan Sinkhole no. 1 is 303 m and Sakaltutan Sinkhole no. 2 is −302 m. Following the Düdencik Sinkhole, these two sinkholes then became the second and third deepest caves in Turkey (J. Chabert, 1980). The article “Les Plus Grandes Cavités Turques” written by Claude Chabert, which was published in 1981 in Grottes et Gouffres, includes a list of longest and deepest caves explored in Turkey until 1980 (C. Chabert, 1981). Of the 13 longest caves on the list, six were explored by French, ﬁve were explored by English, and two were explored by Spanish and BÜMAK cavers, respectively. The longest cave\n\non the list was Tilkiler Cave with a total length of 6600 m. With its newfound branch, Tilkiler Cave’s length reached 6818 m, and it is the third-longest cave on the list of longest caves of Turkey today. There are 25 caves on Chabert’s deepest cave list of 1980; four of them were explored by English, two of them were explored by BÜMAK, one of them was explored by Spanish, and the rest of them were explored by French cavers. The deepest cave on this list was the Düdencik Sinkhole with the depth of −330 m, which now became the 21st deepest cave after 40 years in between.\n\n1.3\n\nTurkish Caving\n\nMAD is the ﬁrst speleological society of Turkey, which was established by Temuçin Aygen in Ankara in 1964. The society, which in its ﬁrst 15 years following its establishment could not get the chance to make speleological research independently and increase the number of its members mainly because of Aygen’s collaboration with foreign and especially SCP member cavers, improved drastically in the 1980s. The establishment, which got stronger with the addition of its new members after 1985, announces its\n\n8\n\nstudies through the MAD Bulletin, which published 16 issues until today since 1987. Even if we exclude the studies it conducted with foreign organizations between 1964 and 1987, MAD has surveyed and mapped 167 caves since 1987. These include deep and important caves like Subatağı Sinkhole (−643 m), Sütlük Sinkhole (−640 m), Düdenağzı Sinkhole (−612 m), and Kocadağ Sinkhole (−458 m). Their explorations on Yaylacık Cave System, which is found in Mid-Taurus Mountains and connected to two different sinkholes, continue. With its 5929 m length and −595 m depth, this cave is one of the biggest cave systems in Turkey. The establishment mainly works in Bursa and Kütahya provinces and Mid-Taurus Range. During the 2nd National Speleology Symposium organized in 1994, MAD ushered in the establishment of the Speleological Federation of Turkey (TMF) and led the way to the establishment of a rescue team within the constitution of this federation. Beginning with the year 2000, MAD organizes rescue training and the annual joint training that all the speleological associations active in Turkey could attend. With the four different cave documentaries it shot to be shown on Turkish National TV channels, MAD also supported the establishment of new university speleological clubs in recent years. BÜMAK, which was established in 1973, nine years after MAD, is the ﬁrst university cave club in Turkey. Activities of the club, which were limited to caves around Istanbul in the years following its establishment, began to spread to Turkey with the explorations in the Taurus Mountains in 1976 and Bulak Mencilis Cave in 1977. Its activities accelerated with the very ﬁrst crossing of the Ayvaini Cave in 1978, discovery and publishing of the 3150-m-long Dupnisa Cave (Atalay & Ülkümen, 1980) and the discovery of 10 new caves during the preliminary survey in Antalya– Akseki–Çimiyayla. During the Çimiyayla Expedition conducted with the Imperial College Caving Club in 1979, BÜMAK cavers used Single Rope Technique (SRT) for the ﬁrst time and completed the survey of 25 caves (Fig. 1.11) (Yamaç, Aktar, & Atalay, 1980). Beginning in 1980, BÜMAK started block research in Kastamonu Province. Over 20 deep and long caves were explored in this area within three years. Explorations in Muğla, Izmir, and Bursa provinces were also being conducted around the same time. Report of a deep cave within the Taurus Mountains in 1989 led to BÜMAK’s exploration of −1192-m-deep Çukurpınar Sinkhole and −1429-m-deep Peynirlikönü Sinkhole. After the conclusion of the explorations on these two sinkholes, BÜMAK directed its surveys on the uninvestigated parts of the Taşeli Plateau. Over 20 caves were found, surveyed, and mapped on the research conducted north of Gazipaşa (Yamaç, 2003).\n\n1 Speleology in Turkey\n\nFig. 1.11 Dünekdibi Pit (−197 m), 1979 (Photograph A. Yamaç)\n\nOrganizing the 1st National Speleology Symposium in 1990 in Istanbul, BÜMAK created an opportunity for Turkish cavers to truly meet each other for the ﬁrst time and laid the groundwork for TMF, which would be established four years after this date. Society continues its work in many different regions of Turkey. Examining BÜMAK’s journal called Delta, which published eight issues until today, it can be seen that they had surveyed and mapped 101 caves in the 16 years between 1978 and 1994 and this number increased to 152 in the second 16 years between 1995 and 2011. On the other hand, they worked in four regions in the ﬁrst 16 years and this number increased to eight later on. BÜMAK has eight caves within the deepest 25 caves and six caves within the longest 25 caves of Turkey. The biggest structural problem BÜMAK has is the graduation of its members from the university within four years and their departure from the club. To present a solution to this problem, old members who wanted to continue as cavers established BUMAD in 2007. Cave Exploration Unit established within the constitution of the General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration (MTA) in 1978 is the third cave organization in\n\n1.3 Turkish Caving\n\nTurkey. This establishment published 62 reports and researched over 900 caves in the past 40 years. All the teams in their studies consist of experts, which makes these reports scientiﬁcally detailed. Compared to other establishments focusing on speleology in Turkey, which of many are sportive, MTA’s studies are considered to be the most important scholarly studies conducted in Turkey. Survey and mapping of many big caves like Kızılelma, Cumayanı, Gökgöl, and Sofular and discovery of the Kuzgun Sinkhole are among the most important researches of this organization. One of the two important problems this unit encounters, who conducted many block surveys in areas like Bolkar, Aladağ, Siirt, Zonguldak, Manavgat, and Thrace regions, is not being independent and working according to requests and directives because of its status as a governmental organization. In a country like Turkey where studying and surveying still requires serious procedures, MTA, which has no obstacle both permission-wise and ﬁnancially, uses some of its resources and labor to arrange some caves as show caves according to demands and cannot be effective in terms of protection. Another structural problem they encounter is that they cannot collaborate with any caving clubs or societies because every member of this division is a government ofﬁcial. On the other hand, a joint venture as such would provide for other establishments which have a lack of scientiﬁc speleological knowledge. Following these ﬁrst three establishments, 15 different speleological clubs and associations were established in Turkey since 1978. Even though this quick rise in numbers, collaborations in recent years caused many establishments who are active in the same area to work together. One of the main reasons for these collaborations was the joint activities organized by TMF where cavers of various clubs got to know each other and started to collaborate, which lessened the competition. Furthermore, as in the example of BÜMAK and BUMAD, other universities’ cave club members also established new societies after their graduations or joined other societies, causing cavers from different backgrounds to become closer. It can be said that competition in terms of exploration continues at some level but it is productive for Turkish speleology, not harmful. The establishment of TMF which had begun being debated over in 1992 and announced with a joint declaration of MAD and BÜMAK during the 2nd National Speleology Symposium in 1994 in Ankara was accepted by other groups that attended and started its activities the same year. The prepared and approved ﬁrst regulation proposal included articles on the federation’s deﬁnition, purposes, membership procedures, executive council, working principles, and missions. Following its establishment, TMF became a member of the International Union of Speleology (UIS), European Speleological Federation (FSE), and Balkan Speleological Union (BSU). Other than the rescue training\n\n9\n\nthat all establishments attend, the federation also organizes joint caving activities. The Balkan Cavers meeting, which is organized by BSU in a different Balkan country each year, was organized by TMF in Turkey twice, gathering hundreds of cavers from ten different countries and enabling them to exchange information and perform caving together. Even though Turkish caving has improved in the past 30 years, various problems appeared with these improvements. “Deep cave enthusiasm” is one of those problems. Following the discovery of Çukurpınar and Peynirlikönü sinkholes, which had an important place on the list of deepest caves of the world in the years they were discovered, Turkish cavers who especially focus on sportive caving and young cavers who are members of university clubs started searching for more deep caves. Besides the facts that long caves require horizontal bedding and this type of geological formations are rare in Turkey, the requirement of time for wide-area explorations, an increased delicacy for long surveys, and more experienced teams to dive into encountered siphons also make deeper caves more preferable to longer caves in these types of explorations. On the other hand, “cave depth record sickness” that increased over the 1990s ushered by Russian and Ukrainian cavers and the fact that Turkey has more deep caves instead of long caves led many foreign and Turkish societies to this type of cave explorations. These establishments lack the resources for large ﬁeld researches, which requires time and ﬁnancial support in Turkey, where karstic areas are extremely wide. The requirement of preliminary studies is another problem encountered while planning for this type of wide-scale ﬁeld research. There are not many karst experts in Turkey who can give scholarly support to cavers that intend to conduct such ﬁeld research. Because of the lack of an institution or an organization that conducts scientiﬁc speleology research, some science people hold a monopoly on this subject. Limited to a few books and articles, scientiﬁc cave and karst studies are far from creating a general context and helping cavers who want to conduct research. Under this speleological attitude, instead of focusing on a particular area and researching that area over a long period, establishments work disorderly on different areas according to the arriving news and reports, which is another mistake being made continuously for many years. This continuing error combined with insufﬁcient database and reference usage causes different caver groups to research the same areas, and thus many caves are being re-explored and remapped. Fifty-eight caves are detected to have double maps until now, and some of these are large caves (Yamaç, 2013). “Double maps” in this sentence is used as a term, as some caves have three, four even ﬁve different maps. Even if the database would be used, this problem would continue as long as ﬁeld research is made without an extensive bibliography search and previously explored −233-m-deep\n\n10\n\nsinkhole named G2 in the Taurus Mountains will undoubtedly be re-explored and re-surveyed a few more times. Interestingly, the ﬁnal problem is encountered after overcoming all these problems, and going to the ﬁeld is socioeconomical. Because of rural to urban migration and the decline of sheep farming in the past 20 years, it caused the almost complete disappearance of shepherds in Turkey. Cavers used to be informed about deep caves by local villagers and shepherds during explorations in the past. Reconnaissance trips in mountainous areas became much more time consuming and difﬁcult without these opportunities. Considering all these problems, it would be more beneﬁcial for Turkish caving to head toward a method that sees different teams working together, focusing on a speciﬁc area, examining it step by step with the support of geological and geomorphological scholars, instead of just evaluating reports from local people. Joint ventures observed in recent years are good examples of this type of survey.\n\nReferences Agnoletti, P., Baldieri, A., Fiorentini, A., & Ortensi, P. (1970). Campagna Speleologica in Turchia.

There were several more studies conducted in the 1940s, but the publications of these researches are uninformative. Even though there are archaeological excavations conducted in a limited number of caves during the recent years, the results are striking. Numerous tools dating back to tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years were found and important archaeological explorations were made in not just the important excavations conducted in long periods that were explained in Chapter 5, but also in excavations of smaller scales. Interestingly, no hominid or Neanderthal skeletal remains were found in almost none of the aforementioned excavations, except a few small pieces. These smaller-scale cave excavations that have given various kinds of ﬁndings are explained in this chapter.\n\n2.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn almost every map that shows early human migrations, there is often one arrow showing a hypothetical route through Anatolia and Thrace toward Europe. Due to its location at the junction between the European and Asian continents, Anatolia is one of the theoretical migration routes of the hominins that came out of Africa (Dinçer, 2016; Otte, 1998). Even though Anatolia is expected to be a bridge between the early human ﬁndings of Europe, Asia, and Africa due to its location between these continents, this relation could not be properly searched until now mainly due to low popularity of Paleolithic archaeology in general and cave archaeology in particular (Harmankaya, 1997). Today, researches are executed by a handful of devoted science people and the limited data we have left many questions\n\nunanswered on Paleolithic culture in Anatolia and early human migrations between the continents. With those limited ﬁndings, it is impossible to make a connection between the cave excavations conducted in European, Asian, and Middle East countries and to come up with a conclusion about Anatolia’s role in early human migrations. Future cave excavations in Anatolia may be expected to provide both solid facts about the Paleolithic Period of the area and new data on early humans’ migrations toward Europe and Asia. On the other hand, even the limited number of archaeological cave surveys and excavations conducted after the 1990s in Turkey, which is known to have thousands of caves, shows us that the ﬁndings in these caves are not just limited to Paleolithic Period but also reaches to Neolithic Age, Bronze Age, and even Classical Periods. But, if we exclude a few scholarly studied caves explained in detail in Chap. 4 which have classical importance like Zindan and Kocain, most cave surveys and excavations in Turkey deal with ﬁndings from Paleolithic and Neolithic ages. However, apart from the artiﬁcial caves in Cappadocia, historical remnants that date back to the Classical Period like inscriptions, chapels, and churches can be found in many natural caves and academic surveys on this type of caves are insufﬁcient. There is not any comprehensive research on cave churches like Içel–Cennet, Antalya–Gediﬁ Ini, and Antakya–St. Pierre. There are neither studies nor articles about the chapel with an apse and several other structures carved on the rocks inside the Yarımburgaz Cave. First archaeological cave surveys of Turkey were carried out by Italian archaeologists Giuseppe Moretti and Vittorio Viale around Antalya. In his two different studies, Moretti copied the inscriptions inside Kocain and Karain caves (Fig. 2.1) (Moretti, 1923–1924a, 1923–1924b). Even if he mentioned it as the “Sacred Cave of luvadja,” we know that this cave is the Karain Cave near to Yağca Village. Moretti gave detailed information about this cave in his article. In the study he conducted in a cave found in Gurma Village 20 km west of Antalya, Viale opened a 2 3 m test trench and\n\n© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 A.

Following these ﬁrst surveys and excavations, from the 1940s and onward, archaeological cave surveys started to be organized more often. Following the academic tradition of that period, almost all of these studies were conducted by anthropologists, mostly by Şevket Aziz Kansu, Enver Bostancı, and Kılıç Kökten. Especially Kökten’s surveys and excavations conducted until the 1970s all around Turkey led to the discovery of many cave settlements. On the other hand, examining their articles and reports, it can be said that the excavations in this period rather test trenches compared to cave excavations in the modern sense and their publications were insufﬁcient and unscientiﬁc. From the 1920s and onward, there have been archaeological surveys and/or excavations in numerous caves in Turkey (for a comprehensive list and bibliography till 1994 ASPRO (Hours et al.,\n\n1994)). Even if these early-period cave excavations are insufﬁcient in terms of scientiﬁc content, the cave excavations conducted in collaboration with international cooperations after 1980, which included applications from different branches of archaeology, provided remarkable results. However, the scientiﬁcity of these excavations and the limited number of academic personnel resulted in a very small number of cave excavations in Turkey in the past 40 years and during the last few years, there are 5 or 6 cave excavations. Some archaeologists who are interested in cave archaeology followed the works realized before them and surveyed mostly in Mediterranean and Marmara regions, while there are almost no surveys in other regions that are known to have thousands of caves. On the other hand, serious developments in the ﬁeld of archaeological cave inventory are being monitored in recent years. The ﬁrst known inventory study on the archaeological\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\n13\n\nevaluation of caves in Turkey was executed in 1951. Ş.A. Kansu’s survey at the date, which was sent to all provinces to detect caves and rock shelters in Turkey, was emphasized to be unhealthy by Kökten (1952; Taşkıran, 2018). According to this rough inventory results dated back to 1951, there are 3534 artiﬁcial and 5952 natural caves in Turkey. From 1990s and onward, comprehensive cave inventory surveys started to be conducted in different regions in Turkey with participation of experts (e.g., Güleç, Özer, Sağır, Baykara, & Şahin, 2013; Özdoğan & Karul, 2002; Taşkıran & Kartal, 2004; Yalçınkaya, Kösem, Özçelik, Erek, & Kartal, 2000) and all these surveys are being added to The Archaeological Settlements of Turkey Project database (www.tayproject.org) through annual updates (Harmankaya & Tanındı, 1997; Harmankaya, Tanındı, & Özbaşaran, 1997). Cave paleontology surveys and excavations are completely left under the shadow of archaeological excavations. Although some paleontological excavations are being conducted in 7–8 different locations of Turkey today, in cave excavations it does not go further than the examination of animal skeleton fragments found. Still, there are some notable examples like Ursus deningeri and Ursus spelaeus bones found in Yarımburgaz Cave excavations (Fig. 2.2) (Arsebük, 1998). It is important to make a short explanation about the “Paleolithic Period” term and its chronology which is frequently used in this and the following chapters. This archaeological period is examined in three subdivisions: Lower, Middle, and Upper Paleolithic. The starting date and subdivision dates of this period are the subject of an ongoing discussion and differentiate each continent. Especially\n\nLevant’s Paleolithic chronology is notably different from that of Europe’s. We prefer taking J. J. Shea’s book “Stone Tools in the Paleolithic and Neolithic Near East” as a reference for the table in Fig. 2.3 (Shea, 2013).\n\nFig. 2.2 Skull of Ursus deningeri from Yarımburgaz Cave (Photograph G. Arsebük)\n\nFig. 2.3 Geological and archaeological timescales, dates, and periods are adapted from Shea (2013)\n\n14\n\n2\n\n“Paleolithic Period,” the longest period in archaeology, begins with the ﬁrst stone tool production of the hominins and ends with 24,000 BP. The transition period between the end of the Paleolithic Period in 24,000 BP and the start of the Neolithic Period in 12,200 BP is named Epipaleolithic Period. This period, which corresponds to the Mesolithic Period in European archaeology, is accepted as a transition period between hunter-gatherer humans and Neolithic communities. All the dates in this chapter and onward are given as Before Present (BP), and these dates are based on C14 tests made on archaeological layers. On the other hand, in this type of cave excavations, there may not be any organic material to make a C14 test on; thus, stone tools found in the excavations may be dated through their comparison to similar tools found in other excavations. In situations like this, ﬁndings are roughly dated and referred through their speciﬁc archaeological period. Any date mentioned in this and following chapters and any date given for these subdivisions which are not certain are subject to the dates given in Fig. 2.3. Karain, Öküzini, Suluin, Yarımburgaz, and Üçağızlı caves which are archaeologically important due to their ﬁndings and results will be explained in detail in Chap. 4. Archaeological ﬁndings of Kadıini and Kızılin caves are also mentioned in the same chapter. Some other archaeologically signiﬁcant cave excavations are explained below (Fig. 2.4).\n\n2.2\n\nCave Archaeology in Turkey\n\n2.2.1 Beldibi Rock Shelter This small rock shelter located south of Antalya, 3 km north of the village of Beldibi, is thought to be used as a temporary campsite or as a habitation area by Upper Paleolithic, Epipaleolithic, and Neolithic hunters. There are paintings on the back wall of this rock shelter. Excavations here, with an initial trench by the wall paintings, began in 1959, three years after the site was discovered by Bostancı (1959). Excavations were continued in 1960, 1966, and 1967. The depth of the ﬁrst trench opened was 4.50 m at the deepest point. Epipaleolithic and Upper Paleolithic microliths and chipped stone tools were found at the bottom layer in these excavations. A pebble painted entirely red with iron oxide paint, a pierced amulet of sandstone, several seashells, deer antlers and teeth, and human skull fragments were found in the Upper Paleolithic Stratum. Another pebble found in Upper Paleolithic Stratum is also reported to have been shaped like a human face in proﬁle (Bostancı, 1966). It is not clear from the publications whether virgin soil has been reached (for a schematic stratiﬁcation of the site, see the table in Bostancı (1967b)). Perhaps the rock shelter’s most important element is the rock art. While most of the paintings have been made of red iron oxide paint, some have been engraved. The engravings are of deer ﬁgures outlined along the natural veins of the rock face with a few simple lines. This antlered animal is portrayed as fleeting with its head turned back. Bostancı dates this work of art to the Upper Paleolithic (Bostancı, 1959).\n\nExamples of Cave Excavations 2.2.2 Belbaşı Rock Shelter\n\nSome of the archaeological cave excavations or researches explained below are rather old but have striking results. On the other hand, few others are comparatively new, rather small scale but with important ﬁndings.\n\nFig. 2.4 Locations of 20 cave excavations mentioned in this chapter: 1 Beldibi, 2 Belbaşı, 3 Çarkini, 4 Direkli, 5 Dülük, 6 Gurma, 7 İkiağızlı, 8 İncili, 9 İnönü, 10 Kanal, 11 Kapalıin, 12 Keçiler, 13 Kızılin, 14 Kurbanağa, 15 Merdivenli, 16 Tekeköy, 17 Tıkalı, 18 Wadi el-Hammam, 19 Yağlak, 20 Yassıkaya (Compiled by A. Yamaç, Google Maps)\n\nThe site is located 7 km northwest of Beldibi Village, near Beldibi Rock Shelter. It was discovered in 1959, and E. Bostancı started excavations the following year. A total of 13 different layers were excavated in a total depth of 160 cm\n\n2.2 Examples of Cave Excavations\n\nwith 3 main strata. Stratum 2 yielded microliths and chipped stone tools, mostly scrapers, flakes, and blade points. The presence of bone awls implies that other materials have also been used in the manufacture of tools. The subsistence of the cave dwellers included mountain goats, deer, and wild pigs. Besides, partially burned human bones including a mandible, a skull’s frontal bone, and femur fragments were found. The human bone analysis revealed that the mandible was originally a female of 18 years old (Bostancı, 1963a). Bostancı believes all the strata date back to the early Epipaleolithic Period. The microlith industry continues in the 3rd stratum. There is little distinction in the chipped stone industry between this stratum and the 2nd stratum above. This layer yielded long and thin backed blade points, which is a characteristic of the Upper Paleolithic, along with microliths (Bostancı, 1962).\n\n2.2.3 Çarkini Cave This cave is located northwest of the city of Antalya and 2 km southwest of the Karain Cave. Kökten opened a small test trench in the cave in 1957. Despite the lack of detailed reports on excavations, the stratigraphy has been published. The uppermost layer in this cave is Chalcolithic and overlays the Neolithic and Upper Paleolithic layers. The layer assigned to the Neolithic yielded both dark burnished ware and ware with linear designs painted in cream color. Samples of obsidian were also recovered (Kökten, 1958). Another team, led by I. Yalçınkaya, I. Kayan, and A. Minzoni-Deroche, resumed excavations at the site in 1984. The excavation of the cave and the sifting of Kökten’s spoil enabled the remaining artifacts such as chipped stone debitage products and pottery to be collected more carefully. Yalçınkaya explains that Kökten had already excavated most of the cultural deposit. From the remaining artifacts, Yalçınkaya believes that the Paleolithic levels at the site fall between the Middle Paleolithic and the Epipaleolithic. The re-excavation and sifting of the soil in 1984 provided 215 chipped stone fragments (Yalçınkaya, 1995).\n\n2.2.4 Direkli Cave This cave is located near the village of Döngel, 38 km northwest of the city of Kahramanmaraş. K. Kökten discovered it in 1958, and a test trench was opened near the entrance the following year. The artifacts in this layer are assigned by Kökten to the end of the Upper Paleolithic. Some blade knives, drills, scrapers, and cores all made of flint were found from this layer (Kökten, 1960). This site’s faunal remains are very important as well. The teeth and skeletal fragments of several Upper Paleolithic carnivores\n\n15\n\nand herbivores including bear, bison, deer, wild pig, and beaver have been recovered. The second excavation phase started in 2007 in Direkli Cave by Erek (2009). Excavations continued in two separate trenches, and a “basin-like” grave was yielded at the Epipaleolithic level. The ﬁlling of the grave produced a large number of beads made of bone, stone, marine, and terrestrial shells (Fig. 2.5). No human remains have been found, however. This level’s C14 date is 12.730 BP. The excavations at the same archaeological level gave rise to a baked clay ﬁgurine of a woman. During excavations, very esthetically and elaborately made bone tools were discovered. These bone tools included an eyehole needle, a ball-headed needle, a bone spear, and a spatula. The animal bone ﬁnds found within the cave mostly belonged to herbivores. Sheep, goats, antelopes, and boars are among the roughly observed species (Erek, 2009). The analysis carried out on Direkli Cave’s faunal remains shows that the cave was used as a short-term logistics camp to hunt wild goats (Capra aegagrus) which lived during the Late Epipaleolithic Period. The fact is that the low density of the remains and the seasonal occupation data indicate that the Epipaleolithic hunter-gatherers were highly mobile.\n\n2.2.5 Dülük Cave This cave site is 11 km north of the city of Gaziantep (Fig. 2.6). Even though it was renown for a long time within the science world, this cave was ﬁrst researched and began to be excavated in 1971 by E.Y. Bostancı. The cave is 84 m long and 24 m deep. In the 2-m-thick deposit that was excavated, bedrock was not reached. Paleolithic material was found only in one corner of the cave (Fig. 2.7). Bostancı mentions that he found examples of Upper Paleolithic blade technology. Also on the terrace near the entrance of the cave, he found a large, 18.4-cm-long biface axe (Bostancı, 1963b, 1975). The two Mithraea found within Dülük Cave that belonged to Mithra culture are dated between ﬁrst century BC and third century AD. These two Mithraea found within the cave side by side share the same entrance but harbor two different cult pictures. There are no other Mithra cult areas that carry these features within all the Roman Empire. Even though being highly deformed, known from other ﬁndings gathered from other corners of the empire, the scene of Mithra kneeling on the moon bull and killing it by slicing its throat can be seen on these cult glyphs. The blood flowing from the bull’s throat means a new life. Other animals in this legend like scorpion, snake, and dog can be seen despite the late period deformations. The scene is framed with the torch-bearers: Cautes and Cautopates. The top part of the glyph is shaped with an arch. Sun god Sol and moon god Luna reside at the top two corners. On the glyph at the ﬁrst cult cave, Mithra’s head had been shattered and a cross had\n\n16\n\n2\n\nCave Archaeology in Turkey\n\nFig. 2.5 Direkli Cave (Photograph I. Demir)\n\nFig. 2.6 Dülük Cave (Photograph S. Savcılı)\n\nbeen carved instead of it (Schütte-Maischatz & Winter, 2001; Winter & Schütte-Maischatz, 2004).\n\n2.2.6 Gurma Cave Gurma cave, which is residing west of Antalya and was excavated by Viale for the ﬁrst time in 1922 (Viale, 1925– 26), was re-excavated in 1946 by Kökten who extended the test trench opened by Viale and opened an adjacent 1.5 4 m trench. Kökten points out that the top 75 cm is Greco-Roman, that the Early Bronze Age starts 95 cm below the surface, and that virgin soil is 130 cm below the surface. Ceramic ﬁnds include wares that are burnished black on the inside and outside and wares which are burnished black on\n\nFig. 2.7 Dülük Cave paleolithic ﬁndings from the ﬁrst excavation season (Bostanci, 1963b)\n\n2.2 Examples of Cave Excavations\n\nthe inside and red on the outside. Kökten identiﬁes these as Early Bronze Age wares (Kökten, 1947). The excavation of Viale yielded several triangular flint bifaces (Fig. 2.8), and one chipped stone tool was found by Kökten. Because the excavations at this site in 1922 and 1946 were less thorough in their methods of excavation and recording, like many excavations in the early twentieth century, the stratigraphic sequencing of this site could not be determined.\n\n2.2.7 İkiağızlı Cave The cave is located on the same hill as the Üçağızlı Cave, 12 km from Hatay’s Samandag District. It was discovered during E. Güleç’s 2002 survey, and she performed a brief sounding in 2008. Eight levels were identiﬁed as a result of the sounding performed in 2008. During this exploration, 305 pieces of tools and fragments, 19 cores, and 1471 pieces of remains were found. The technology that has been identiﬁed within the cave consists of the flake industry. Most of the flakes are flat, typical Middle Paleolithic tools are found within the cave, and there is a high amount of side scrapers. The Paleolithic tool density is low (Güleç, Yilmaz, Sagir, Ozer, & Baykara, 2010).\n\n2.2.8 İncili Cave This cave is located southwest of Antakya city, south of Çevlik Village. The cave lies in the limestone cliffs formed during the Tertiary Period, which today are directly sheltered Fig. 2.8 Paleolithic flint tools from 1922 Gurma Cave excavations (Viale, 1925–26)\n\n17\n\nfrom the sea because they are in a small bay. The cave is assumed to have been formed in the Quaternary Period by wave action. The cave’s entrance is 6 meters above sea level. The cave was excavated in 1970, 1971, and 1973 under the direction of E. Bostancı, reaching a bedrock at 5 meters below the surface. The ﬁrst 9 layers are post-Roman. The ﬁndings from these layers were not reported, which are totaling 274 cm in thickness. Layer 10, which is 53 cm thick, is contemporaneous with the settlement of the ancient city of Selevkia Pierra. From this light-colored calcareous layer, large quantities of pottery and broken glass were recovered. The underlying layer was a 40-cm-thick grayishwhite stratum that yielded many fragmented pieces of human bones. Layer 12 consisted entirely of sand formed at a time when sea level was lower. Bostancı dates Layer 12 to the Upper Paleolithic. Although no chipped stone tools have been found, the human skeleton and the pierced shells, which are at least 50,000 years old, were probably used as decorative ornaments (Bostancı, 1973b).\n\n2.2.9 İnönü Caves A team led by Şevket Aziz Kansu made an excavation by the name of Turkish Historical Society in Eskişehir İnönü caves in 1938 (Kansu, 1939). This is the very ﬁrst Turkish archaeological survey and excavation. There are many caves and rock shelters of different sizes in the area (Fig. 2.9). Kansu and his team had excavated largest two of these caves which they named A and B. A typical stratigraphy was detected, and pottery fragments belonged to Chalcolithic and\n\n18\n\n2\n\nCave Archaeology in Turkey\n\nFig. 2.9 İnönü Caves (Photograph N. Çam)\n\nBronze Ages were found but no ﬁndings belonged to Paleolithic Age were encountered during the excavation made in cave A. A small amount of Bronze Age pottery was found during the test excavation made in cave B and its side branches. Caves and rock shelters in the area were also researched during these excavations. These are Eserönü Cave to the east of İnönü, Suluin, Koyunini, and Çakmakini caves of Kandilli Village to the south of İnönü, three caves on the İnönü–Kütahya road, Karahasan Rock Shelter in Porsuk Suyu Valley, and the two caves found in the foothills of the Kırgız Mountain to the east of Arapören Village. İnler and Katrancı Village caves found approximately 70 km south and west of Polatlı, Kızılhisar, and Demirözü caves found in the valley which Demirözü creek flows through were examined and found poor in terms of prehistoric material. Kirmir Suyu caves in Güdül, Ankara, were examined the same year and were deduced to belong in classical periods. Kale Cave, which is located in a hill called Kale to the south of Şereflikoçhisar, was also examined.\n\n2.2.10 Kanal Cave This cave site is located southwest of Antakya city and very close to Mağaracık Village (Fig. 2.10). It is about 500 m from the Merdivenli Cave and 300 m from the Mediterranean. The cave’s entrance is 20 meters above sea level. The site was found in 1966, and excavations were conducted in 1966, 1967, and 1969 by Enver Yaşar Bostancı. Several different sand strata are reported to be found among the Upper Paleolithic terra rosa iron oxide layers. The researchers believe this indicates that in the Upper Paleolithic, this region’s climate was dry. The Mediterranean,\n\nwhich in the Riss-Würm Ice Ages was 15 m higher than it is today, was probably much closer than it is today to this cave. Layer VI, the lowest excavated layer, is particularly difﬁcult. Minzoni-Deroche reports that the cultural material ﬁlling at this site consists of mixed deposits that have been hardened by water erosion and sloping sediment movement (Minzoni-Deroche, 1993). This explains why the excavated strata report lacks clarity. At this site, the ﬁrst test trench dug revealed the presence of an Upper Paleolithic. Excavating further exposed Middle Paleolithic remains. The Upper Paleolithic layers yielded end scrapers on blades, rounded scrapers, biface end scrapers, steep scrapers, burins on flakes, and blades (Bostancı, 1967a). Bostancı reports that there is a total of 20,000 artifacts and debitage products. The excavation also yielded a few human remains including a mandible molar in the Upper Paleolithic layers and a canine tooth from a 9-year-old boy’s maxilla in the Middle Paleolithic strata. A lot of fossilized mammal bones were also collected here, although not well described. Minzoni-Deroche reports that in the surface survey she conducted after the excavation, she found 1468 tools and tool fragments at this site. The ﬁndings included rounded end scrapers; side scrapers; burins on blades; borers, etc., assigned to Upper Paleolithic. Middle Paleolithic tools are not mentioned (Minzoni-Deroche, 1993).\n\n2.2.11 Kapalıin Cave This cave site is located 1.7 km northwest of the village of Senirce, 15 km north of Isparta city. Other caves and rock shelters on the same cliff are collectively called the Bozaönü Caves (Fig. 2.11). The entrance of the Kapalıin Cave faces\n\n2.2 Examples of Cave Excavations\n\nFig. 2.10 Kanal Cave (Photograph E. Soner)\n\nsouth. The cave is 21 m deep and 21.5 m wide, consisting of two different chambers. The larger chamber, closer to the entrance, has a high conical ceiling, whereas the smaller chamber has a low ceiling and there are several broken stalactites on the ceiling. The cultural ﬁll over the cave’s floor seems to be quite thick. In the Byzantine Period, both the interior and the exterior of the narrow entrance had been neatly reshaped. While outside the entrance a wooden porch-like structure was built, a stepped arch was carved on the ceiling of the cave entrance. Excavations at the site were conducted in 1944 by Ş. A. Kansu and 1951 and 1952 by\n\nFig. 2.11 Kapalıin Cave (Photograph M. Çamlıalan)\n\n19\n\nM. Şenyürek. Two trenches were opened during the excavations of 1944 (Kansu, 1944). These test trenches were expanded by later excavations, and 4 new trenches were opened. The stratigraphy is as follows: The top two layers (layers I and II), with a total depth of 40 cm, consist of manure and chips of calcareous stone. The layer below is 45 cm thick and dates back to the Roman and Byzantine periods. Layer IV is a reddish ash layer with a thickness of 35 cm and includes fragments of worked calcareous and burned bone. The burned bone fragments continue in layer V. This layer, dating back to an unspeciﬁed “later period,” yielded a large amount of pottery and tiles. Layer VI is a sandy layer with fragments of worked limestone. These top six layers represent this site’s historical periods. In the level below, a large decrease in the amount of pottery can be seen. Small pebbles, flint and bone tools, and fossilized animal bones assigned to the Upper Paleolithic were found in the 75-cm-thick layer VII. The dark-colored layer below is full of chipped stone tools. Interestingly, ceramics are reported to reappear in this 85-cm-thick layer. Therefore, this site’s stratigraphy needs to be researched further. The next layer, layer IX, is a thin yellowish layer that lies above the ashy layer X, which is the ﬁnal material cultural level. There was no pottery in level IX or level X. Kansu reports that the bedrock was reached 3.5 m below the surface, while Senyürek reports that the earliest layer of cultural deposit was layer X. Kansu reports that the ﬁrst Upper Paleolithic ﬁnds were discovered in 1944. There are many discrepancies in stratigraphy that require clariﬁcation.\n\n20\n\nAlthough the stratigraphic layers are presented in detail, there is limited information on the microlith chipped stone tools. Microburins found during the excavation were lunates, triangles, and other geometric microtools. Since all the tools described and photographed are Epipaleolithic, it seems reasonable to classify the site as Epipaleolithic until further research.\n\n2.2.12 Keçiler Cave This cave is located 3 km north of Büyük and Küçük Pirun villages, 6–7 km northeast of Adıyaman city. There are two separate entrances to the cave which is 20 m long. Hours refer to this cave as “Palanlı Cave” (Hours et al., 1994). Anati, who arrived in the region to analyze the cave paintings of the nearby rock shelter Palanlı–Pirun, discovered the site in 1968 (Anati, 1968). Bostancı later surveyed the cave in 1970 (Bostancı, 1971). Anati reports that the rock face contains at least 45 engraved ﬁgures, particularly on the eastern wall. Anati, who has studied all the ﬁgures, believes they have been drawn in four phases. Especially the ﬁrst and oldest phase is deeply engraved. It depicts well-pictured goats, ranging in height from 60 to 80 cm (Fig. 2.12). There are also two schematic human ﬁgures in this phase. Anati dates this phase to the Epipaleolithic Period except for a few drawings that she believes are earlier, while Bostancı assigns it to the Upper Paleolithic. Anati believes that the drawings in this phase closely resemble the paintings in Italy’s Romanelli, Levanzo and Adduara caves, as well as Jordan’s Negev Desert and Kilwa Cave art paintings. On the other hand, the paintings produced in the second and third phases were chiseled. Anati, who believes they are similar to the examples of cave art from the Kumbucağı Rock Shelter and\n\nFig. 2.12 Keçiler Cave (Photograph E. Soner)\n\n2\n\nCave Archaeology in Turkey\n\nthe Gevaruk Valley, assigns them to the Neolithic Period, while Bostancı believes that they also have some Epipaleolithic qualities. Some drawings were superimposed over the earlier engravings in Phase Four. While Anati dates these drawings to the Bronze Age, they are assigned to modern times by Bostancı (Anati, 1968; Bostancı, 1973a). Anati compares the rock art in the second and third phases to the wall paintings in Beldibi and the Gevaruk Valley wall paintings, concluding that it is of the Neolithic Period (Anati, 1968). On the other hand, Bostancı assigns the rock art to the Epipaleolithic and Early Neolithic as it is stylized (Bostancı, 1973a). However, Mellaart believes that the animal ﬁgures and other depictions of the rock art in this cave resemble Halaf painted pottery and concludes that the paintings should be assigned to the Chalcolithic Period instead (Mellaart, 1975). In ASPRO, those cave paintings are dated to 9600–8000 BP (Hours et al., 1994).\n\n2.2.13 Kızılin Cave Not to be mixed with Burdur’s Kızılin Cave mentioned in Chap. 5, this cave site is located northwest of Antalya city, southwest of the Karain Cave. Kızılin Cave, like the caves of Karain, Çarkini, and Öküzini, is on the northern fringes of Mount Katran, facing the travertine formation. The cave is 410 m above sea level and overlooks a plain approximately 100 m above the level of the plain. The dimensions of the cave are 20 m east–west and 14 m north–south. Today, the cave’s entrance is only 1 m wide and it is presumed that the entry was wider in the Pleistocene. Although there is a flat terrace by the front entrance, the cave’s floor runs on a steep slope. It is known that Kökten excavated at this cave site but his ﬁndings have not been published. Işın Yalçınkaya, Ilhan\n\n2.2 Examples of Cave Excavations\n\nKayan, and Angela Minzoni-Deroche surveyed the area later in 1984. During their survey in 1984, the entrance to the cave yielded 450 flintstone flakes and tool fragments. A total of 309 of these were blades and flakes, some of which were retouched. Also, some end scrapers and cores were found. The most frequently found tools were blades and end scrapers which were notched and slightly retouched. A rich faunal assemblage was recovered from this cave. The researchers suggest that the cave must have been inhabited in post-Glacial, Upper Paleolithic times and that although common Upper Paleolithic chipped stone artifacts have not been found, such tools are expected to be found in future excavations (Minzoni-Deroche, 1988, 1993; Yalçınkaya, 1986).\n\n2.2.14 Kurbanağa Cave This cave is located south of Kars city, southwest of Camuşlu Village. The cave’s depth is 11.50 m, and it has a 5.50 m interior width while its entrance is 12.50 m wide. The cave art on the outer walls and the ceiling of the cave were made by chiseling, which is a technique foreign to this area. The panels depict goats, some with arrows shot into them; traps made of nets; wooden stakes; and braided lassos. These wall paintings unmistakeably date back to the Paleolithic. Kılıç Kökten discovered the cave in 1969, opening a 3.5 8 m test trench just outside the cave the same year. Although it is indicated that the upper levels of the site date to the Early Bronze Age, it is unfortunate that detailed information on the strata and the ﬁnds have not been published. Upper and Middle Paleolithic tools were found together in the layer below (Kökten, 1975).\n\n2.2.15 Merdivenli Cave This cave site resides southwest of the city of Antakya, southwest of Mağaracık Village and 4 km northwest of Samandağ town. The cave, now 36–39 m above sea level, is about 23 m deep, 6 m wide, and 2 m high. The cave’s entrance faces south. Two seasons of excavation were carried out in 1956 and 1957 after the discovery of the cave in 1956. Under the direction of M. Şenyürek and E. Bostancı, six test trenches were excavated. A total of ﬁve layers were exposed according to the reports of the researchers. In this excavation, bedrock was not reached at the ﬁnal depth of 571 cm. Some oil lamps and some pottery fragments were found at the ﬁrst layer, which dates back to the Roman Period when the area was settled by the inhabitants of the city of Selevkia. Points, blades, end scrapers, nosed scrapers, flake scrapers, steep faced scrapers, and borers assigned to the Upper Paleolithic were found in the second and third\n\n21\n\nlayers. Some bone tools, including a hatchet, an awl, and the bottom portion of a needle were also found in these layers. There is a thin layer between layer III and layer IV which contains stones that must have fallen off the cave’s ceiling. There were no artifacts in this layer. The fourth layer, partially hardened by a calcareous deposit, included flint and bone fragments. These layers vary in thickness in each trench. Chipped stone tools of the Levallois–Moustérien type have been found in the last two layers. These include triangular points, laurel leaf points, side scrapers, perforators, and concave disk-shaped scrapers. In layer IV, there is a notable advance in the chipped stone tool industry when compared to the layer V. Very comprehensive site reports on the chipped stone tools of this Paleolithic cave site were published by Şenyürek and Bostancı. There were many fewer bone tools in the fourth and ﬁfth layers. There is a layer of large stones above the sandy strata below layer V. The researchers suggest that there was a great time gap in the Middle Paleolithic between the deposition of these sandy strata and the habitation. Four human molars and mammal bones, including lion, hippopotamus, deer, bison, as well as many other fossils from a variety of carnivorous animals and rodents, were found among the layers assigned to the Middle Paleolithic.\n\n2.2.16 Tekeköy Caves These rock shelters are about 14 km southeast of Samsun City, south of Tekeköy Village (Fig. 2.13). The survey and excavation of Tekeköy caves were carried out in 1940 under the direction of Nimet Özgüç, Tahsin Özgüç, and Kılıç Kökten, and this excavation is special because it was the very ﬁrst cave excavation in the Black Sea Region (Kökten, Ozguç, & Ozguç, 1945). Kökten’s stratigraphy does not correlate with that of Kansu, who visited the site in 1941 (Kansu, 1944). Kökten found many chipped stone tools on the valley terraces as well as in the rock shelters in his survey of the neighboring caves and rock shelters in 1940 (Kökten, 1941, 1944). Retouched microlith tools are reported to be abundant in rock shelter “A” within the layers II and III, as deﬁned by both Kansu and Kökten. Kansu places the tools, which are resembling northwestern European microlith industries tools, in three different categories: microburins, microscrapers, and other microlith tools (Kansu, 1944). Even though the excavations provided a large number of animal bones and teeth including buffalo and horse, no faunal research was carried out. Kökten reports that the tools are made of a variety of materials, while the smaller of the two Moustérien tools he found on the terrace of the valley is a diorite scraper, and the larger one is a point made from basalt.\n\n22\n\n2\n\nCave Archaeology in Turkey\n\nFig. 2.13 Tekeköy Caves (Photograph A. E. Keskin)\n\n2.2.17 Tıkalı Cave\n\n2.2.18 Wadi el-Hammam Cave\n\nThis cave site is located in the village of Mağaracık, southwest of the city of Antakya. It was discovered during their survey and excavations in the Samandag region in 1958 by M. Şenyürek and E Bostancı. Two test trenches were opened the same year, a small one at the cave entrance and a larger 4.7 4 m one west of the small trench. The excavations continued with new trenches the following year. According to the excavators, Middle Paleolithic tools appeared between 145 and 180 cm below the surface. Roman drainage pipes found just below the uppermost layer, which consists of the rubble that ﬁlls the cave, indicate that the rubble must have fallen off the cave ceiling in relatively recent times. Şenyürek reports that the thickness of the Paleolithic layer below is 135–145 cm. Hardened soil with chipped stone tools and fossilized mammal bones were at the bottom of this layer. Excavations were stopped before bedrock was reached because it was too hard to excavate this layer. Excavations in the Tıkalı Cave unearthed Middle Paleolithic chipped stone tools that are among the most carefully examined Anatolian Paleolithic ﬁnds. Although some of the flakes were made from hard sandstone, most of the tools and debitage products were made from silica. The excavators believe that the differentiating patinas are the result of flintstone pebble usage in the making of tools instead of flint nodules. Flakes and blades are prominent components of this industry, but points, side scrapers, end scrapers, burins, borers, knives, and choppers were also found (Senyürek, 1958, 1959).\n\nThis site is located 1.7 km southeast of Reyhanlı town, southeast of Antakya city. The cave resides 500 m southwest of the Tell el Cüdeyde/Judaidah site and is one of many caves in the Amuq Plain’s limestone outcrops (Fig. 2.14). The cave was discovered in 1932 by M. Claude Prost and Terence Patrick O’Brien directed an excavation in the cave. The excavation, which is Anatolia’s second earliest cave excavation after the Gurma Cave excavation led by Viale, uncovered an area of 48 m2, which was excavated 2 m below the surface. In addition to small ﬁnds, the floors and surfaces inside the cave suggest that there was habitation in the cave. There were four layers found. Layer 4 has been assigned to the Neolithic Period, which is 166 cm beneath the surface (O’Brien, 1933). There is little difference in the material found on different floors within the cave. Amuq A handmade, thick pasted, simple kitchenware, and dark burnished ware with black, gray, brown, gray-red surface colors were found in the cave. Slipped ware was found in the lower levels.
