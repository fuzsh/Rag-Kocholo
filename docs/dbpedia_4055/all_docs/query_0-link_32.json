G.; Emre, T.; SÃ¶zbilir, H.; Turan, M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nQuaternary records of marine terraces formation are indispensable tool for the better understanding sea-level changes in the coastal region of Pontides. Time of the marine terraces with linked to date of the depositional of its are very crucial to know for active tectonic evolution in this study area. The ages of the marine terraces are not well known in the coastal region of Trabzon and Rize. In the coastal region of eastern Pontides, we have identified three marine terrace levels. Using the optically stimulated dating we show that these three sedimentation period were formed during the at 8.3 Â± 2.5 ka, 42 Â± 1.8 ka and 78.3 Â± 6.1 ka. These ages correspond to marine isotopic stages (MIS) or substages (MISS) 1, 3 and 5a sea level, respectively. The apparent vertical movement is ranging from 1.0 mm/yr to 0.59 mm/yr that obtained from marine terraces in the northeastern of Pontides. We will present timing of the marine terrace formation and vertical movement in the coastal region of Trabzon and Rize. Key words: OSL dating, vertical movement, marine terraces, active tectonic, eastern Pontides.\n\nPaleostress maps and structural evolution of the Pontides\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHippolyte, Jean-Claude; Espurt, Nicolas; Kaymakci, Nuretdin; Sangu, Ercan; MÃ¼ller, Carla\n\n2014-05-01\n\nIn the frame of DARIUS programme we worked from 2010 to 2012 in the central and eastern Pontides. We aimed at understanding the timing and the characteristics of the extensional and compressional episodes that occurred along the southern margin of the Black Sea (Pontides belt). We used stress inversion technique (Angelier's softwares) for analyzing fault kinematics and characterizing the successive tectonic episodes in terms of paleostresses. The age of the tectonic episodes was constrained by combining structural analysis with nannoplankton dating of the sedimentary units. 1) In the central Pontides, structural analysis shows that deposition of the Barremian-Albian terrigenous sediments of the \"syn-rift\" Ãaglayan Group was controlled by large normal faults under an ESE-WNW extension probably related to the SE-directed opening of the western Black Sea Basin. In contrast, the Coniacian-Santonian and the Paleocene \"post-rift\" sequences were deposited under NE-SW extension probably related to the SW-directed opening of the eastern Black Sea Basin. At the beginning of Eocene the stress regime changed from extensional to compressional which resulted in the formation of syn-compressional basins. In order to illustrate the two-dimensional structural evolution of the central Pontides we built a NNE-trending 75 km long balanced and restored cross section between Boyabat and Sinop cities. The section is constrained by 183 sites of field data, 5 seismic lines and 8 wells. We model the Pontides as a bi-vergent structure resulting from the structural inversion of Cretaceous normal faults of the southern Black Sea margin. Apatite fission track data along this section suggest that inversion started in the earliest Eocene (~55 Ma). Eocene-Miocene shortening reached ~28 km. 2) In the eastern Pontides, an early Campanian to late Paleocene NW-SE extension was followed by three successive compressional events. A Paleocene to early Eocene NW-SE compression resulted in the formation of\n\nDiscovery of Latest Cretaceous OIB-type alkaline gabbros in the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt, NE Turkey: Evidence for tectonic emplacement of seamounts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEyuboglu, Yener; Dudas, Francis O.; Chatterjee, Nilanjan; Liu, Ze; YÄ±lmaz-DeÄerli, Sedanur\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe Meso-Cenozoic geodynamic evolution of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt, a mountain chain extending parallel to the southeastern margin of the Black Sea, has been controversial for the last forty years. Here we present data for a newly discovered alkaline gabbro body and its surrounding basaltic rocks in the northern part of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt. We also provide a comprehensive assessment of the Late Mesozoic-Cenozoic geodynamic evolution of the Eastern Mediterranean region. The gabbroic body is bounded by reverse faults along its northern and southern borders and is surrounded by vesicular, pillow-fragment breccias and pillow basalts. Mineral compositions suggest that crystallization of the gabbros began at about 1170 Â°C, and the lowest preserved crystallization T is near 1000 Â°C. Estimated pressure at the beginning of crystallization is 5.7-7.4 kb. The 40Ar/39Ar dating of kaersutite and plagioclase and Usbnd Pb dating of titanite indicated that the Hayrat gabbro crystallized at 67 Ma (Late Maastrichtian). Whole rock major-trace-rare earth element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope data indicate that the gabbros and basalts have different origins. The gabbros are alkaline and exhibit the geochemical features of OIB, whereas the basalts are tholeiitic and reveal depletions of HFSE that are similar to those of arc rocks. The gabbros are strongly fractionated, and derive from an enriched, lithospheric mantle source, with partial melting occurring in a garnet-stable environment. The basalts are less fractionated, and probably derive from a shallower source in which spinel peridotite was the predominant lithology. Considering all new and old geological, geochemical, geochronological and geophysical data from the Black Sea Basin and the Eastern Pontides-Lesser Caucasus-Alborz Orogenic Belt, we suggest that the alkaline Hayrat gabbro formed in an oceanic intraplate setting, and was accreted to the forearc region of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt during\n\nGeochemical fingerprints of Late Triassic calc-alkaline lamprophyres from the Eastern Pontides, NE Turkey: A key to understanding lamprophyre formation in a subduction-related environment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKarsli, Orhan; Dokuz, Abdurrahman; Kaliwoda, Melanie; Uysal, Ibrahim; Aydin, Faruk; Kandemir, Raif; Fehr, Karl-Thomas\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe Eastern Pontides in NE Turkey is one of the major orogenic belts in Anatolia. In this paper, we report our new 40Ar/39Ar dating, mineral chemistry, major and trace elements and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic analyses of the lamprophyre intrusions in this region. The lamprophyres are widely scattered and intrude Late Carboniferous granitoid rocks. The lamprophyres exhibit fine-grained textures and are mineralogically uniform. Hornblende 40Ar/39Ar dating yielded a plateau age of 216.01 Â± 10.64 Ma. Based on their geochemistry, mineral compositions and paragenesis, the lamprophyres are classified as calc-alkaline lamprophyres in general and spessartites in particular, which are rich in large ion lithophile elements (e.g., Rb, Ba, K) but depleted in Nb and Ti. Our samples exhibit moderate fractionation in LREE patterns approximately 100 times that of chondrite but HREE abundances less than 10 times that of chondrite. These calc-alkaline lamprophyres display a range of ISr (216 Ma) values from 0.70619 to 0.71291 and ÉNd (216 Ma) values from - 1.4 to 4.1, with TDM = 1.11 to 2.20 Ga. Their Pb isotopic ratios indicate an enriched mantle source. The enrichment process is related to metasomatism of a subcontinental lithospheric mantle source, which is caused by a large quantity of H2O-rich fluids, rather than sediments released from oceanic crust at depth during the closure of the Paleotethys Ocean in Triassic times. All of the geochemical data and the trace element modeling suggest that the primary magma of the calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline spessartites was generated at depth by a low degree of partial melting (~ 1-10%) of a previously enriched lithospheric mantle wedge consisting of phlogopite-bearing spinel peridotite. The ascendance of a hot asthenosphere triggered by extensional events caused partial melting of mantle material. The rising melts were accompanied by fractional crystallization and crustal contamination en route to the surface.

In this paper we report for the first time late Miocene adakitic rocks from the southeastern part of the eastern Pontides belt and present results from geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic studies as well as zircon U-Pb geochronology. The Tavdagi dacite that we investigate in this study is exposed as round or ellipsoidal shaped bodies, sills, and dikes in the southeastern part of the belt. Zircons in the dacite show euhedral crystal morphology with oscillatory zoning and high Th/U values (up to 1.69) typical of magmatic origin. Zircon LA-ICPMS analysis yielded a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 7.86 Â± 0.15 Ma. SHRIMP analyses of zircons with typical magmatic zoning from another sample yielded a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 8.79 Â± 0.19 Ma. Both ages are identical and constrain the timing of dacitic magmatism as late Miocene. The Miocene Tavdagi dacite shows adakitic affinity with high SiO2 (68.95-71.41 wt.%), Al2O3 (14.88-16.02 wt.%), Na2O (3.27-4.12 wt.%), Sr (331.4-462.1 ppm), Sr/Y (85-103.7), LaN/YbN (34.3-50.9) and low Y (3.2-5 ppm) values. Their initial 143Nd/144Nd (0.512723-0.512736) and 87Sr/86Sr (0.70484-0.70494) ratios are, respectively, lower and higher than those of normal oceanic crust. The geological, geochemical and isotopic data suggest that the adakitic magmatism was generated by partial melting of the mafic lower crust in the southeastern part of the eastern Pontide belt during the late Miocene. Based on the results presented in this study and a synthesis of the geological and tectonic information on the region, we propose that the entire northern edge of the eastern Pontides-Lesser Caucasus-Elbruz magmatic arc was an active continental margin during the Cenozoic. We identify a migration of the Cenozoic magmatism towards\n\nDolomitization in Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Platform Carbonates (Berdiga Formation), Ayralaksa Yayla (Trabzon), NE Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYÄ±ldÄ±z, Merve; Ziya KÄ±rmacÄ±, Mehmet; Kandemir, Raif\n\n2017-04-01\n\nABSTRACT Pontides constitute an E-W trending orogenic mountain belt that extends about 1100 km along the northern side of Turkey from the immediate east of Istanbul to the Georgian border at the east. Tectono-stratigraphically, the Pontides are divided into three different parts: Eastern, Central, and Western Pontides. The Eastern Pontides, including the studied area, comprise an area of 500 km in length and 100 km in width, extending along the southeast coast of the Black Sea from the Kizilirmak and Yesilirmak Rivers in the vicinity of Samsun to the Little Caucasus. This area is bordered by the Eastern Black Sea basin to the north and the Ankara-Erzincan Neotethyan suture zone to the south. The Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous platform carbonates are widely exposed in E-W direction in the Eastern Pontides (NE Turkey). The Platform carbonates shows varying lithofacies changing from supratidal to platform margin reef laterally and vertically, and was buried until the end of Late Cretaceous. The studied Ayralaksa Yayla (Trabzon, NE Turkey) area comprises one of the best typical exposures of formation in northern zone of Eastern Pontides. In this area, the lower parts of the formation are pervasively dolomitized by fabric-destructive and fabric-preserving replacement dolomite which are Ca-rich and nonstoichiometric (Ca56-66Mg34-44). Replacement dolomites (Rd) are represented by D18O values of -19.0 to -4.2 (VPDB), D13C values of 4.4 to 2.1 \\\\permil (VPDB) and 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.70889 to 0.70636. Petrographic and geochemical data indicate that Rd dolomites are formed prior to compaction at shallow-moderate burial depths from Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous seawater and/or partly modified seawater as a result of water/rock interaction and they were recrystallized at elevated temperatures during subsequent burial. In the subsequent diagenetic process during the Late Cretaceous when the region became a magmatic arc, as a result of interaction with Early Jurassic volcanic\n\nPetrogenesis and U-Pb zircon chronology of felsic tuffs interbedded with turbidites (Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt, NE Turkey): Implications for Mesozoic geodynamic evolution of the eastern Mediterranean region and accumulation rates of turbidite sequences\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEyuboglu, Yener\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Meso-Cenozoic geodynamic evolution of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt, which is one of the key areas of the Alpine-Himalayan system, is still controversial due to lack of systematic geological, geophysical, geochemical and chronological data. The prevailing interpretation is that this belt represents the southern margin of Eurasia during the Mesozoic and its geodynamic evolution is related to northward subduction of oceanic lithosphere. This paper reports the first detailed geological, geochemical and chronological data from felsic tuffs interbedded with late Cretaceous turbidites in the Southern Zone of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt. Individual tuff layers are thin, mostly < 2 m in thickness, implying that these are dominantly air-fall tuffs. Petrographic data indicate that the felsic tuffs, which exhibit various degrees of alteration, can be classified as crystal-rich and crystal-poor tuffs. The crystal-poor tuffs consist mainly of 45-65% devitrified glass shards and 10-20% broken quartz crystals, whereas the crystal-rich tuffs consist of > 50% crystals. The zircon U-Pb data show three statistically distinct ages at 84, 81 and 77 Ma, with uncertainties of about 1 Ma, suggesting that tuff-forming late Cretaceous magmatism started about 84 Ma ago and was episodically active over a minimum of 7 Ma. The age data also indicate that the average accumulation rate of the turbiditic sequence that hosts the felsic tuffs remained constant between 36 and 40 cm/10 ky. Their enrichment in LIL and LRE elements relative to HFS and HRE elements, and also strongly negative Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies, are consistent with those of magmas generated by subduction-related processes. The tuffs have relatively low initial ratios of 143Nd/144Nd (0.512296-0.512484; ÎµNd: - 2.1 and - 7.2) and 87Sr/86Sr (0.704896-0.706159). Their initial Pb isotopic compositions range from 18.604 to 18.646 for 206Pb/204Pb, from 15.644 to 15.654 for 207Pb/206Pb and from 38.712 to 38.763 for 208Pb/204\n\nThe final pulse of the Early Cenozoic adakitic activity in the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt (NE Turkey): An integrated study on the nature of transition from adakitic to non-adakitic magmatism in a slab window setting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEyuboglu, Yener; Dudas, Francis O.; Santosh, M.; EroÄlu-GÃ¼mrÃ¼k, TuÄba; Akbulut, KÃ¼bra; Yi, Keewook; Chatterjee, Nilanjan\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt, one of the best examples of a fossil continental arc in the Alpine-Himalayan system, is characterized by adakitic magmatism during the Early Cenozoic. Popular models correlate the adakitic magmatism to syn- or post-collisional processes occurring after the collision between the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt and the Tauride Platform at the end of Late Mesozoic and/or beginning of the Cenozoic. We present new geological, petrological and chronological data from andesites and felsic tuffs exposed in the Bayburt area, in the southern part of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt, and discuss the nature of the transition from adakitic to non-adakitic activities in a continental arc. Major, trace and rare earth element concentrations of both andesites and felsic tuffs clearly suggest that they are related to arc magmatism in a continental arc with adakitic composition. The isotopic compositions are permissive of mixing between a component similar to depleted mantle and a second component that is either mafic lower crust or subducted oceanic crust. 39Ar/40Ar hornblende and U/Pb zircon dating indicate that this adakitic magmatism in the Bayburt area ended by about 47 Ma, and transformed into non-adakitic, granitoid arc magmatism in the area immediately north of Bayburt in the Lutetian (â¼46 Ma). Based on our new results in conjunction with available data, we propose that the beginning of northward rollback of a south-directed subducting slab, and simultaneous opening of a slab window related to ridge subduction, triggered both adakitic magmatism for approximately a 10 Myr period between 57.6 and 47 Ma and arc-parallel extension that caused the opening of the Early Cenozoic sedimentary basins. We also suggest that the shallow marine environment, in which Nummulite-bearing sandy limestones accumulated in the Early Cenozoic, was transformed into a saline-lake environment during the pyroclastic activity that produced the studied felsic tuffs\n\nProvenance of a large Lower Cretaceous turbidite submarine fan complex on the active Laurasian margin: Central Pontides, northern Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAkdoÄan, Remziye; Okay, Aral I.; Sunal, GÃ¼rsel; Tari, Gabor; Meinhold, Guido; Kylander-Clark, Andrew R. C.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe Pontides formed the southern active margin of Laurasia during the Mesozoic. They became separated from mainland Laurasia during the Late Cretaceous, with the opening of the Black Sea as an oceanic back-arc basin. During the Early Cretaceous, a large submarine turbidite fan complex developed in the Central Pontides. The turbidites cover an area of 400 km by 90 km with a thickness of more than 2 km. We have investigated the provenance of these turbidites-the ÃaÄlayan Formation-using paleocurrent measurements, U-Pb detrital zircon ages, REE abundances of dated zircons and geochemistry of detrital rutile grains. 1924 paleocurrent measurements from 96 outcrop stations indicate flow direction from northwest to southeast in the eastern part of the ÃaÄlayan Basin and from north-northeast to west-southwest in the western part. 1194 detrital zircon ages from 13 Lower Cretaceous sandstone samples show different patterns in the eastern, central and western parts of the basin. The majority of the U-Pb detrital zircon ages in the eastern part of the basin are Archean and Paleoproterozoic (61% of all zircon ages, 337 grains); rocks of these ages are absent in the Pontides and present in the Ukrainian Shield, which indicates a source north of the Black Sea. In the western part of the basin the majority of the zircons are Carboniferous and Neoproterozoic (68%, 246 grains) implying more local sources within the Pontides. The detrital zircons from the central part show an age spectrum as mixture of zircons from western and eastern parts. Significantly, Jurassic and Early Cretaceous zircons make up less than 2% of the total zircon population, which implies lack of a coeval magmatic arc in the region. This is compatible with the absence of the Lower Cretaceous granites in the Pontides. Thus, although the ÃaÄlayan Basin occupied a fore-arc position above the subduction zone, the arc was missing, probably due to flat subduction, and the basin was largely fed from the Ukrainian\n\nUpper Campanian calciclastic turbidite sequences from the HacÄ±mehmet area (eastern Pontides, NE Turkey): integrated biostratigraphy and microfacies analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSari, Bilal; Kandemir, Raif; Ãzer, Sacit; Walaszczyk, Ireneusz; GÃ¶rmÃ¼Å, Muhittin; Demircan, Huriye; Yilmaz, Cemil\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe upper Campanian (Cretaceous) of the HacÄ±mehmet area (south of the city of Trabzon; Eastern Pontides) is mainly composed of calciclastic turbidites. The basinal unit of the 119 m thick succession includes thin red pelagic limestone interlayers and conglomerates dominated by volcanic clasts. The overlying upper slope and lower slope units of the sequence consist of an alternation of allochthonous calcarenite/calcirudite beds and pelagic marls and mudstones. Calcarenite/calcirudite beds dominate the upper slope unit of the succession and are composed of transported material, including benthic foraminifers, red algae, bryozoan, crinoid and rudist fragments, inoceramid bivalve prisms and neritic and pelagic carbonate lithoclasts. The occurrence of Helicorbitoides boluensis (Sirel) extracted from the calcarenite/calcirudite beds indicates a Campanian age. Identifiable rudists such as Joufia reticulata Boehm, Bournonia cf. anatolica Ozer, Biradiolites cf. bulgaricus Pamouktchiev and ?Biradiolites sp. from the upper slope unit of the succession indicate a late Campanian- Maastrichtian age. The planktonic foraminifers within the red pelagic limestone beds, marls and mudstones throughout the succession consist mainly of Campanian-Maastrichtian forms and suggest mainly basinal depositional conditions. The presence of Radotruncana cf. calcarata (Cushman) accompanied by Globotruncanita elevata (Brotzen) in the basinal unit of the succession indicates an early late Campanian age for the lower part of the succession. Inoceramid bivalves have been collected from the upper part of the succession. The fauna is dominated by `Inoceramus' tenuilineatus Hall and Meek, 1854 and Cataceramus haldemensis (Giers, 1964); other taxa recognised are: `Inoceramus' algeriensis Heinz, 1932, Platyceramus vanuxemi (Meek and Hayden, 1860), `Inoceramus' cf. nebrascensis Owen, 1852, Cataceramus aff. barabini (Morton, 1834), Cataceramus gandjaensis (Aliev, 1956), and `Inoceramus' sp.; the assemblage\n\nQuantification of fluvial response to tectonic deformation in the Central Pontides, Turkey; inferences from OSL dating of fluvial terraces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcClain, Kevin; YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m, Cengiz; Ãiner, Attila; Akif SarÄ±kaya, M.; Åahin, Sefa; Ãzcan, Orkan; GÃ¼neÃ§ KÄ±yak, Nafiye; ÃztÃ¼rk, TuÇ§ba\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFrom Late Miocene to present, Anatolia's rapid counterclockwise movement, which increases in velocity towards the Hellenic Arc, has formed the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), a dextral transform fault along the Anatolia-Eurasia plate boundary and the northern margin of the Central Anatolian Plateau (CAP). A zone of transpression referred to as the Central Pontides exists between the broad restraining bend of the NAF and the Black Sea Basin, uplifting what is interpreted as a detached flower structure. Dating of Quaternary landforms in the eastern flank of the Central Pontides has helped to understand its recent deformation. However, in the western flank of the Central Pontides there is an absence of Quaternary studies, relatively quiet modern seismicity, and difficulties locating or observing fault scarps. This led us to use optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL-dating) of fluvial terrace sediments and the study of geomorphic features to gain insight into the influence of climate and tectonics on landscape evolution of this area. In this area, the Filyos River crosses the KarabÃ¼k Fault (reverse fault) and deeply incises a gorge through the KarabÃ¼k Range before flowing towards the Black Sea. In the gorge an abundance of indicators of tectonic deformation were mapped, such as hanging valleys, wind gaps, bedrock gorges, landslides, steep V-shaped channels, tilted basins, as well as fluvial strath terraces. In particular, strath terraces of at least 8 levels within just 1.5 km of horizontal distance were examined. We used OSL-dating to estimate five deposition ages of fluvial strath terrace sediments, leading to an estimation of incision and uplift rates over time. Using three samples per terrace with strath elevations of 246 Â± 0.2 m, 105.49 Â± 0.2 m, 43.6 Â± 0.2 m, 15.3 Â± 0.2 m and 3.6 Â± 0.2 m above the Filyos River, we determined corresponding ages of 841 Â± 76 ka, 681 Â± 49 ka, 386 Â± 18 ka, 88 Â± 5.1 ka and 50.9 Â± 2.8 ka.

Later, from the Jurassic to the Eocene, subductions, obductions, micro-plate accretions, and finally continent-continent collision occurred between Eurasia and Arabia, and resulted in the closure of Neotethys. In the Lesser Caucasus and NE Anatolia three main domains are distinguished from South to North: (1) the South Armenian Block (SAB) and the Tauride-Anatolide Platform (TAP), Gondwanian-derived continental terranes; (2) scattered outcrops of ophiolite bodies, coming up against the Sevan-Akera and Ankara-Erzincan suture zones; and (3) the Eurasian plate, represented by the Eastern Pontides margin and the Somkheto-Karabagh Arc. The slivers of ophiolites are preserved non-metamorphic relics of the now disappeared Northern Neotethys oceanic domain overthrusting onto the continental South Armenian Block (SAB) as well as on the Tauride-Anatolide plateform from the north to the south. It is important to point out that the major part of this oceanic lithosphere disappeared by subduction under the Eurasian Margin to the north. In the Lesser Caucasus, works using geochemical whole-rock analyses, 40Ar/39Ar dating of basalts and gabbro amphiboles and paleontological dating have shown that the obducted oceanic domain originates from a back-arc setting formed throughout Middle Jurassic times. The comprehension of the geodynamic evolution of the Lesser Caucasus supports the presence of two north dipping subduction zones: (1) a subduction under the Eurasian margin and to the south by (2) an intra-oceanic subduction allowing the continental domain to subduct under the oceanic lithosphere, thus leading to ophiolite emplacement. To the West, the NE Anatolian ophiolites have been intensely studied with the aim to characterize the type of oceanic crust which they originated from. Geochemical analyses have shown similar rock types as in\n\nKilop Cretaceous Hardground (Kale, GÃ¼mÃ¼shane, NE Turkey):description and origin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEren, Muhsin; Tasli, Kemal\n\n2002-06-01\n\nA hardground surface is well exposed in the Kilop area of Kale (GÃ¼mÃ¼shane, NE Turkey) which forms part of the Eastern Pontides. Here, the hardground is underlain by shallow water Lower Cretaceous limestones, and overlain by Upper Cretaceous red limestones/marls which contains a planktonic microfauna including Globotruncanidae. In the field, the recognition of the hardground is based on the presence of extensive burrows (especially vertical burrows), the encrusting rudistid bivalve Requienia, neptunian-dykes with infills of pelagic sediments and synsedimentary faults. Skolithos and Thalassinoides-type burrows are present. Some burrow walls show iron hydroxide-staining. The extensive burrowing occurred prior to lithification. On the other hand, the neptunian-dykes and synsedimentary faults, which cut the hard ground, occurred after the lithification. These features indicate the progressive hardening of the substrate. The burrowed limestone consists of an intrabioclastic peloidal grainstone which was deposited in an intertidal to shallow, subtidal, moderate to relatively high energy environment. The peloidal limestone shows little or no evidence of submarine cementation, characterized by only scarce relics of isopachous cement rims of bladed calcite spar. The grainstone cement is composed predominantly of blocky calcite and overgrowth calcite cements on the echinoid-fragments. The origin of this cement is controversial. Biostratigraphic analysis of the limestones demonstrates that there is a marked stratigraphic gap (hiatus), spanning the Aptian to the Santonian, in the Cretaceous of the Kilop area. The formation of the Kilop Hardground is related to the break-up and subsidence of the Eastern Pontides carbonate platform during the formation of the Black Sea backarc basin. Hardground development was initiated in a shallow marine environment of slow sedimentation and with moderate to high energy indicating slow subsidence.

The volcanic rocks are mainly basalts and basaltic andesites (with their pyroclastic equivalents) associated with a volcaniclastic formation made up of breccias and sandstones that are stratigraphically overlain by a Marly-calcareous turbidite formation. The calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy points to a late Santonian-middle Campanian age (CC17-CC21 Zones) for the sedimentary succession. The geochemistry of the volcanic rocks reveals an active continental margin setting as evidenced by the enrichment in Th and LREE over HFSE, and the Nb-enriched nature of these lavas relative to N-MORB. As highlighted by the performed arenite petrography, the occurrence of continent-derived clastics in the sedimentary succession supports the hypothesis of a continental arc-derived volcanic succession. Alternative geodynamic reconstructions are proposed, where this tectonic unit could represent a slice derived from the northern continental margin of the Intra- Pontide or Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan oceanic basins.\n\nPaleomagnetic results from Northeast Anatolia: remagnetization in Late Cretaceous sandstones and tectonic rotation at the Eastern extension of the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture zone\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCengiz Ãinku, Mualla\n\n2017-12-01\n\nPaleomagnetic results obtained from Upper Cretaceous sandstones in Northeastern Anatolia demonstrate that the entire area from Erzincan to Kars has been remagnetised. The remagnetisation was acquired before the Middle Eocene collision between the Eastern Pontides and the Arabian Platform because Middle Eocene sandstones carry primary natural remanent magnetisations. The post-folding in situ mean direction of the Upper Cretaceous sandstones is compared with mean directions of younger, Middle Eocene to present rock formations. As a result, a two-stage antagonistic rotation mechanism is proposed. First, the collision between the Pontides and the Taurides between Late Cretaceous and Middle Eocene was associated by clockwise rotation of 26Â°. In the second stage between Middle Eocene and Middle Miocene and beyond, counterclockwise rotations up to 52Â° of the Pontide and Anatolide blocks and clockwise rotations of the Van Block were characterised by regional shortening and westward escape.\n\nNew zircon U-Pb LA-ICP-MS ages and Hf isotope data from the Central Pontides (Turkey): Geological and geodynamic constraints\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÃimen, Okay; GÃ¶ncÃ¼oÄlu, M. Cemal; Simonetti, Antonio; Sayit, Kaan\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe Central Pontides in northern Anatolia is located on the accretionary complex formed by the closure of Neotethyan Intra-Pontide Ocean between the southern Eurasian margin (Istanbul-Zonguldak Terrane) and the Cimmerian Sakarya Composite Terrane. Among other components of the oceanic lithosphere, it comprises not yet well-dated felsic igneous rocks formed in arc-basin as well as continent margin settings. In-situ U-Pb age results for zircons from the arc-basin system (Ã¶angaldaÄ Metamorphic Complex) and the continental arc (Devrekani Metadiorite and Granitoid) yield ages of 176 Â± 6 Ma, 163 Â± 9 Ma and 165 Â± 3 Ma, respectively. Corresponding in-situ average (initial) 176Hf/177Hf initial ratios are 0.28261 Â± 0.00003, 0.28267 Â± 0.00002 and 0.28290 Â± 0.00004 for these units and indicative of a subduction-modified mantle source. The new U-Pb ages and Hf isotope data from these oceanic and continental arc units together with regional geological constraints support the presence of a multiple subduction system within the Intra-Pontide Ocean during the Middle Jurassic.\n\nResolving the deep electrical resistivity structure at Central Pontides, Northern Turkey by three-dimensional magnetotelluric modeling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÃzaydÄ±n, Sinan; BÃ¼lent Tank, Sabri; KaraÅ, Mustafa; Sandvol, Eric\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWide-band magnetotelluric (MT) (360 Hz - 1860 sec) data were acquired at 25 sites along a north - south aligned profile cutting across the Central Pontides, which are made up of highly metamorphosed formations and their tectonic boundaries including: a Lower Cretaceous-aged turbidite sequence, Central Pontides Metamorphic Supercomplex (CPMS), North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) and Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan Suture Zone (IAESZ). Dimensionality analyses over all observation points demonstrated high electrical anisotropy, which indicates complex geological and tectonic structures. This dimensional complexity and presence of the electrically conductive Black Sea augmented the requirement for a three-dimensional analysis. Inverse modeling routines, ModEM (Egbert and Kelbert, 2012) and WSINV3DMT (Siripunvaraporn et al., 2005) were utilized to reveal the geo-electrical implications over this unusually complicated region. Interpretations of the resultant models are summarized as follows: (i) ÃangaldaÇ§ and DomuzdaÇ§ complexes appear as highly resistive bodies bounded by north dipping faults. (ii) Highly conductive Tosya Basin sediments overlain the ophiolitic materials as a thin cover located at the south of the NAFZ. (iii) North Anatolian Fault and some auxiliary faults within the system exhibit conductive-resistive interfaces that reach to lower crustal levels. (iv) IAESZ is a clear feature marked by the resistivity contrast between NAFZ-related sedimentary basins and Neo-Tethyan ophiolites.\n\nCarbonate sedimentation in an extensional active margin: Cretaceous history of the Haymana region, Pontides\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOkay, Aral I.; Altiner, Demir\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe Haymana region in Central Anatolia is located in the southern part of the Pontides close to the Ä°zmir-Ankara suture. During the Cretaceous, the region formed part of the south-facing active margin of the Eurasia. The area preserves a nearly complete record of the Cretaceous system. Shallow marine carbonates of earliest Cretaceous age are overlain by a 700-m-thick Cretaceous sequence, dominated by deep marine limestones. Three unconformity-bounded pelagic carbonate sequences of Berriasian, Albian-Cenomanian and Turonian-Santonian ages are recognized: Each depositional sequence is preceded by a period of tilting and submarine erosion during the Berriasian, early Albian and late Cenomanian, which corresponds to phases of local extension in the active continental margin. Carbonate breccias mark the base of the sequences and each carbonate sequence steps down on older units. The deep marine carbonate deposition ended in the late Santonian followed by tilting, erosion and folding during the Campanian. Deposition of thick siliciclastic turbidites started in the late Campanian and continued into the Tertiary. Unlike most forearc basins, the Haymana region was a site of deep marine carbonate deposition until the Campanian. This was because the Pontide arc was extensional and the volcanic detritus was trapped in the intra-arc basins and did not reach the forearc or the trench. The extensional nature of the arc is also shown by the opening of the Black Sea as a backarc basin in the Turonian-Santonian. The carbonate sedimentation in an active margin is characterized by synsedimentary vertical displacements, which results in submarine erosion, carbonate breccias and in the lateral discontinuity of the sequences, and differs from blanket like carbonate deposition in the passive margins.\n\nProduction of 21Ne in depth-profiled olivine from a 54 Ma basalt sequence, Eastern Highlands (37Â° S), Australia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMatchan, Erin L.; Honda, Masahiko; Barrows, Timothy T.; Phillips, David; Chivas, Allan R.; Fifield, L. Keith; Fabel, Derek\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn this study we investigate the cosmogenic neon component in olivine samples from a vertical profile in order to quantify muogenic 21Ne production in this mineral. Samples were collected from an 11 m thick Eocene basalt profile in the Eastern Highlands of southeastern Australia. An eruption age of 54.15 Â± 0.36 Ma (2Ï) was determined from 40Ar/39Ar step-heating experiments (n = 6) on three whole-rock samples. A 36Cl profile on the section indicated an apparent steady state erosion rate of 4.7 Â± 0.5 m Ma-1. The eruption age was used to calculate in situ produced radiogenic 4He and nucleogenic 3He and 21Ne concentrations in olivine. Olivine mineral separates (n = 4), extracted from the upper two metres of the studied profile, reveal cosmogenic 21Ne concentrations that attenuate exponentially with depth. However, olivine (Fo68) extracted from below 2 m does not contain discernible 21Ne aside from magmatic and nucleogenic components, with the exception of one sample that apparently contained equal proportions of nucleogenic and muogenic neon. Modelling results suggest a muogenic neon sea-level high-latitude production rate of 0.02 Â± 0.04 to 0.9 Â± 1.3 atoms g-1 a-1 (1Ï), or <2.5% of spallogenic cosmogenic 21Ne production at Earth's surface. These data support a key implicit assumption in the literature that accumulation of muogenic 21Ne in olivine in surface samples is likely to be negligible/minimal compared to spallogenic 21Ne.\n\nMultidimensional Mantle Convection Models in Eastern Anatolia, the North Arabian Platform, and Caucasus Region\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSengul Uluocak, E.; Shahnas, H.; Pysklywec, R.; Gogus, O.; Eken, T.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nEastern Anatolia, the North Arabian Platform, and Caucasus regions show many features of collisional tectonics with different convergence rates and shortening from south to north. The volcanism, sediment provenience, and thermochronological data suggest that the shortening and exhumation in the Greater Caucasus started during the Eocene-Oligocene synchronously with the collision between Arabia-Bitlis-PÃ¶tÃ¼rge Massif in the south. Previous works indicate that the uplift (up to 2 km) in Eastern Anatolia related to upwelling mantle following the deformation of the Arabian oceanic lithosphere ( 11 Ma) during the ongoing Greater Caucasus closure is the dominant tectonic processes in the center of the region. However, there is no integrated geodynamic model that explains the deformation mechanisms of the region -and their possible interactions with each other -under the dynamic forces. In this study, we use multidimensional mantle-lithosphere convection/deformation models to quantify the geodynamic processes as constrained by the geological/geophysical observations in the region. For the models, seismic studies provide the high-resolution images of the upwelling mantle beneath Eastern Anatolia and the presence -and the locations- of the seismically fast structures associated with the relic/subducted slabs at varying depths such as the Bitlis slab in the south, and the Pontide and Kura slabs in the north. Fast polarization directions observed from splitting analyses exhibit an overall NE-SW oriented mantle anisotropy and a comparison between Pn and SKS derived fast wave azimuths indicates a crust-mantle coupling most likely implying vertically coherent deformation to the north of the study area. For the geodynamic models, we modify the mantle and lithosphere rheology as well as the thermal state. We interpret the estimated uplift and subsidence anomalies related to lithospheric variations (ranging from 54 km to 211 km) and subducting slab behavior with observed\n\nNew paleomagnetic results from Upper Cretaceous arc-type rocks from the northern and southern branches of the Neotethys ocean in Anatolia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCengiz Cinku, Mualla; Heller, Friedrich; UstaÃ¶mer, Timur\n\n2017-10-01\n\nA paleomagnetic study of Cretaceous arc type rocks in the Central-Eastern Pontides and in the Southeastern Taurides investigates the tectonic and paleolatitudinal evolution of three volcanic belts in Anatolia, namely the Northern and Southern Volcanic Belts in the Pontides and the SE Taurides volcanic belt. The paleomagnetic data indicate that magnetizations were acquired prior to folding at most sampling localities/sites, except for those in the Erzincan area in the Eastern Pontides. The Southern Volcanic Belt was magnetized at a paleolatitude between 23.8_{-3.8}^{+4.2}Â°N and 20.2_{-1.2}^{+1.3}Â°N. HisarlÄ± (J Geodyn 52:114-128, 2011) reported a more northerly paleolatitude (26.6_{-4.6}^{+5.1}Â°N) for the Northern Volcanic Belt. The comparison of the new paleomagnetic results with previous ones in Anatolia allows to conclude that the Southern Volcanic Belt in the Central-Eastern Pontides was emplaced after the Northern Volcanic Belt as a result of slab-roll back of the Northern Neotethys ocean in the Late Cretaceous. In the Southeast Taurides, Upper Cretaceous arc-related sandstones were at a paleolatitude of 16.8_{-3.8}^{+4.2} . The Late Cretaceous paleomagnetic rotations in the Central Pontides exhibit a counterclockwise rotation of RÂ± Î R=-37.1Â° Â± 5.8Â° (Group 1; ÃankÄ±rÄ±, YaylaÃ§ayÄ± Formation) while Maastrichtian arc type rocks in the Yozgat area (Group 2) show clockwise rotations R + Î R = 33.7Â° Â± 8.4Â° and R + Î R = 29.3Â° Â± 6.0Â°. In the SE Taurides counterclockwise and clockwise rotations of RÂ± Î R=-48.6Â° Â± 5.2Â° and RÂ± Î R=+34.1Â° Â± 15.1Â° are obtained (Group 4; ElazÄ±Ä Magmatic Complex). The Late Cretaceous paleomagnetic rotations in the Pontides follow a general trend in concordance with the shape of the suture zone after the collision between the Pontides and the KÄ±rÅehir block. The affect of the westwards excursion of the Anatolian plate and the associated fault bounded block rotations in Miocene are observed in the east of the\n\nInterseismic coupling, seismic potential, and earthquake recurrence on the southern front of the Eastern Alps (NE Italy)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCheloni, D.; D'Agostino, N.; Selvaggi, G.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nHere we use continuous GPS observations to document the geodetic strain accumulation across the South-Eastern Alps (NE Italy). We estimate the interseismic coupling on the intracontinental collision thrust fault and discuss the seismic potential and earthquake recurrence. We invert the GPS velocities using the back slip approach to simultaneously estimate the relative angular velocity and the degree of interseismic coupling on the thrust fault that separates the Eastern Alps and the Venetian-Friulian plain. Comparison between the rigid rotation predicted motion and the shortening observed across the area indicates that the South-Eastern Alpine thrust front absorbs about 70% of the total convergence between the Adria and Eurasia plates. The coupling is computed on a north dipping fault following the continuous external seismogenic thrust front of the South-Eastern Alps. The modeled thrust fault is currently locked from the surface to a depth of â10 km. The transition zone between locked and creeping portions of the fault roughly corresponds with the belt of microseismicity parallel and to the north of the mountain front. The estimated moment deficit rate is 1.3 Â± 0.4 Ã 1017 Nm/yr. The comparison between the estimated moment deficit and that released historically by the earthquakes suggests that to account for the moment deficit the following two factors or their combination should be considered: (1) a significant part of the observed interseismic coupling is released aseismically and (2) infrequent \"large\" events with long return period (> 1000 years) and with magnitudes larger than the value assigned to the largest historical events (Mwâ 6.7).\n\nQuantification of Fluvial Response to Tectonic Deformation and Climate in the Central Pontides, Turkey; Inferences from OSL Dating of Fluvial Terraces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcClain, K.; Yildirim, C.; Ãiner, A.; Sahin, S.; SarÄ±kaya, A.; Ozturk, T.; KÄ±yak, N. G.; Ozcan, O.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThis study intends to improve the understanding of the topographic evolution and fluvial processes responding to tectonics and climate within the high-relief and deeply-incised KarabÃ¼k Range of the Central Pontides, a large transpressional wedge at the northern margin of the Central Anatolian Plateau. Insight into these interactions can be obtained through the dating of fluvial sediment and understanding of geomorphic features. From Late Miocene to present, Anatolia's rapid counterclockwise movement, which increases in velocity towards the Hellenic Arc, has formed the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), a dextral transform fault along the Anatolia-Eurasia boundary. North of the transpressional zone of the NAF's massive restraining bend, an area that had experienced previous uplift due to the closure of the Intra-Pontide Ocean, the landscape experienced further uplift and the development of a detached flower structure. In the west side of this zone of transpression, the Filyos River deeply incises a gorge while bisecting the KarabÃ¼k Range. This created an area with an abundance of indicators of tectonic deformation to map, such as hanging valleys, wind gaps, bedrock gorges, landslides, steep v-shaped channels, as well as an abundance of fluvial strath terraces. In particular, the village of BolkuÅ lies among strath terraces of at least 8 ages within just 1.5 km of horizontal distance. In BolkuÅ, we used optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL dating) to estimate five deposition ages of fluvial strath terrace sediment, or their last exposure to daylight, leading to an estimation of incision and uplift rates over time. After collecting three samples from each terrace, with strath elevations of 246, 105.49, 43.6, 15.3 and 3.6 m.a.s.l., we determined corresponding ages of 841 Â±76, 681 Â±49, 386 Â±18, 88 Â±5.1 and 50.9 Â±2.8 ka. These ages are older than expected for an area of active vertical deformation.

In this puzzling region the convergence between Adria microplate and Eurasia plate is partly or entirely absorbed within the South-Eastern Alps, where the Adriatic lithosphere underthrusts beneath the mountain belt. Historical seismicity and instrumentally recorded earthquakes show thrust faulting on north-dipping low-angle faults in agreement with geological observations of active mountain building and active fold growing at the foothills of the South-Eastern Alps. In this study, we use continuous GPS observations to document the geodetic strain accumulation across the South-Eastern Alps (NE Italy). We estimate the pattern of interseismic coupling on the intra-continental collision north-dipping thrust faults that separate the Eastern Alps and the Venetian-Friulian plain using the back-slip approach and discuss the seismic potential and earthquake recurrence. Comparison between the rigid-rotation predicted motion and the shortening observed across the studied area indicates that the South-Eastern Alpine thrust front absorbs about 80% of the total convergence rate between the Adria microplate and Eurasia plate. The modelled thrust fault is currently locked from the surface to a depth of approximately 10 km. The transition zone between locked and creeping portions of the fault roughly corresponds with the belt of microseismicity parallel and to the north of the mountain front.

R.; Kouhpeyma, M.\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThe Binalud Mountains are situated in the south of the Kopeh Dagh as a transitional zone between the Alborz and Central Iran zones. The Palaeotethys suture of the north Iran is located in this area. The Binalud Mountains consists of relatively thick successions of sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks. The earliest deformation, a polyphase synmetamorphic deformation which occurred entirely in ductile conditions, is distinguished in the metamorphic rocks of the eastern part. D1, D2 and D3 deformation phases are related to this deformation. The D4 deformation affected the area after a period of sedimentation and erosion. The thrust faults of the central and southern part of the eastern Binalud were classified as structures related to the D5 tectonic event. From the geodynamic point of view, in Late Palaeozoic times the studied area formed an oceanic trench generated by the subduction of the Palaeotethys oceanic lithosphere beneath the Turan Plate. In the Late Triassic, the Early Cimmerian Event resulted in a collisional type orogeny generating a transpression polyphase deformation and the metamorphism of Permian and older sediments. Following this collision, granite intrusions were emplaced in the area and caused contact metamorphism. The exhumation and erosion of the rocks deformed and metamorphosed during Early Cimmerian Event caused the formation of molassic type sediments in a Rhaetian-Lias back arc basin. The continuation of convergence between the Turan and Iran Plates caused the metamorphism of these sediments and their transformation to phyllite and meta-sandstone. During Late Mesozoic and Early Cenozoic times, the convergence between Central Iran and Turan Plates continued and a NE compression caused folding of the Cretaceous and older rocks in the Kopeh Dagh area. In the Binalud area this deformation caused the generation of several thrust fault systems with S to SW vergence, resulting in a thrusting of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic successions on each other\n\nConstraints of C-O-S isotope compositions and the origin of the ÃnlÃ¼pÄ±nar volcanic-hosted epithermal Pb-Zn Â± Au deposit, GÃ¼mÃ¼Åhane, NE Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAkaryali, Enver; Akbulut, KÃ¼bra\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe Eastern Pontide Orogenic Belt (EPOB) constitutes one of the best examples of the metallogenic provinces in on the Alpine-Himalayan belt. This study focuses on the genesis of the ÃnlÃ¼pÄ±nar Pb-Zn Â± Au deposit in the southern part of the Eastern Pontide Orogenic Belt. The main lithological units in the study area are the Early Carboniferous KurtoÄlu Metamorphic Complex the Late Carboniferous KÃ¶se Granitoid and the Early-Middle Jurassic ÅenkÃ¶y Formation. The studied deposit is hosted by the ÅenkÃ¶y Formation, which consists predominantly of basaltic-andesitic rocks and associated pyroclastic rocks that are calc-alkaline in composition. Silicic, sulfidic, argillic, chloritic, hematitic, carbonate and limonite are the most obvious alteration types observed in the deposit site. Ore microscopy studies exhibit that the mineral paragenesis in deposits includes pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, gold, quartz and calcite. Electron microprobe analyses conducted on sphalerite indicate that the Zn/Cd ratio varies between 84 and 204, and these ratios point at a hydrothermal deposit related to granitic magmas. Fluid inclusion studies in calcite and quartz show that the homogenization temperature of the studied deposit ranges between 90-160 Â°C and 120-330 Â°C respectively. The values of sulfur isotope analysis of pyrite, sphalerite and galena minerals vary between 1.6â° and 5.7â°, and the results of oxygen and carbon isotope analysis range between 8.4â° and 18â° and -5â° and -3.6â°, respectively. The average formation temperature of the ore was calculated as 264 Â°C with a sulfur isotope geothermometer. All of the data indicate that the ÃnlÃ¼pÄ±nar deposit is an epithermal vein-type mineralization that was formed depending on the granitic magmatism.\n\nThe Geology and Petrography of YÃ¼cebelen and Surrounding Area, Torul-GÃ¼mÃ¼Åhane\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDoÇ§acan, Ãzcan; ÃzpÄ±nar, Yahya\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe study area is located in the tectono-stratigraphic zone named \"Eastern Pontide Zone\" from the northeastern part of Turkey. Eastern Pontides were formed by the subduction of Tethys Ocean under the Eurasian plate, during the Early Cretaceous - Late Eocene. Eastern Pontide orogenic zone can be divided in two tectono-stratigraphic subgroups as the northern and southern zones. The study area is located very close to border of these two subgroups but located in northern zone. In this project, the first geological map of the study area at the scale 1:5000 was made. Subsequently, detailed geological maps at the scale 1:2000 were made for the areas rich in ores. In the study area, Upper Cretaceous volcanic rocks consisting of basalts and basaltic andesites take place at the bottom of the rock sequence. Basalts and basaltic andesites with hyaloophitic, vitrophiric and microporphyric texture comprise plagioclase +pyroxene +chlorite +calcite Â±epidote Â±chalcedony Â±opaque minerals. They are overlain by concordant pyroclastic and dacitic-rhyodacitic rocks. Quarts + K-feldispar Â±plagioclase? Â±biotite Â±chlorite Â±calcite Â±chalcedony minerals are determined as a result of microscope investigation on samples taken from these rocks. These rocks are overlain by sedimentary rocks intercalated with pyroclastic rocks. All those units mentioned above, were intruded by granitoids of supposed Upper Cretaceous-Eocene age. Granitoids that crop out in the area were classified in terms of Q-ANOR parameters as granodiorites (Adile Hamlet occurrence - investigated in detail), diorites (Tuzlak Hill occurrence- eastern-part of study area) and quartz monzodiorites (Ä°stavroma Hill occurrence- northern part of study area). Adile Hamlet granodiorites comprise plagioclase +pyroxene +chlorite +calcite Â±quarts Â±epidote +opaque minerals.

The pluton comprises granite, granodiorite, tonalite and minor diorite (SiO2 = 59.43-76.95 wt%), with only minor gabbroic diorite mafic microgranular enclaves in composition (SiO2 = 54.95-56.32 wt%), and exhibits low Mg# (<46). All samples show a high-K calc-alkaline differentiation trend and I-type features. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns are fractionated [(La/Yb) n = 2.40-12.44] and display weak Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.30-0.76). The rocks are characterized by enrichment of LILE and depletion of HFSE. The HarÅit host rocks have weak concave-upward REE patterns, suggesting that amphibole and garnet played a significant role in their generation during magma segregation. The host rocks and their enclaves are isotopically indistinguishable. Sr-Nd isotopic data for all of the samples display I Sr = 0.70676-0.70708, É Nd(79 Ma) = -4.4 to -3.3, with T DM = 1.09-1.36 Ga. The lead isotopic ratios are (206Pb/204Pb) = 18.79-18.87, (207Pb/204Pb) = 15.59-15.61 and (208Pb/204Pb) = 38.71-38.83. These geochemical data rule out pure crustal-derived magma genesis in a post-collision extensional stage and suggest mixed-origin magma generation in a subduction setting. The melting that generated these high-K granitoidic rocks may have resulted from the upper Cretaceous subduction of the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan oceanic slab beneath the Eurasian block in the region. The back-arc extensional events would have caused melting of the enriched subcontinental lithospheric mantle and formed mafic magma. The underplating of the lower crust by mafic magmas would have played a significant role in the generation of high-K magma. Thus, a thermal anomaly induced by underplated basic magma into a hot crust would have caused partial melting in the lower part of the crust.

Focal mechanisms for events at the intersection of the Lake Tanganyika and Rukwa rifts in SW Tanzania indicate a complicated stress pattern with possible dextral strike-slip motion on some faults but oblique motion on others (either sinistral on NW striking faults or dextral on NE striking faults). Within the Rukwa rift, focal mechanisms indicate normal dip-slip motion with NE-SW opening. In NE Tanzania where the Eastern rift impinges on the margin of the Tanzania Craton, fault motions are consistent with a zone of distributed block faults and sub E-W extension. All twelve earthquakes likely nucleated within the crust.\n\nComparison of the triple-point temperatures of {sup 20}Ne, {sup 22}Ne and normal Ne\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNakano, T.; Tamura, O.; Nagao, K.\n\n2013-09-11\n\nAt the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ), the triple points of {sup 20}Ne and {sup 22}Ne were realized using modular sealed cells, Ec3Ne20 and Ec8Ne22, made by the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM) in Italy. The difference of the triple-point temperatures of {sup 20}Ne and {sup 22}Ne was estimated by using the sub-range of standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs) calibrated by NMIJ on the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90). The melting curves obtained with the Ec3Ne20 and Ec8Ne22 cells show narrow widths (0.1 mK) over a wide range of the inverse of the melted fraction (1/F) frommoreÂ Â» 1/F=1 to 1/F=10. The liquidus point T{sub tp} estimated by the melting curves from Fâ¼0.5 to Fâ¼0.85 using the Ec8Ne22 is 0.146 29 (4) K higher than that using the Ec3Ne20 cell, which is in good agreement with that observed by INRiM using the same cells. After correction of the effect of impurities and other isotopes for Ec3Ne20 and Ec8Ne22 cells, the difference of T{sub tp} between pure {sup 20}Ne and pure {sup 22}Ne is estimated to be 0.146 61 (4) K, which is consistent with the recent results reported elsewhere. The sub-ranges of SPRTs computed by using the triple point of {sup 20}Ne or {sup 22}Ne realized by the Ec3Ne20 cell or the Ec8Ne22 cell in place of the triple point of Ne for the defining fixed point of the ITS-90 are in good agreement with those realized on the basis of the ITS-90 at NMIJ within 0.03 mK, which is much smaller than the non-uniqueness and the sub-range inconsistency of SPRTs.Â«Â less\n\n10.

It is bounded by the Crevillente Fault to the north and the Bajo Segura Fault to the south, and it is characterized by a Late Miocene to Quaternary folded cover. We estimate the present-day deformation of the study area from a GPS network with 11 sites. Observation campaigns were carried out four times (June 1999, September 2001, September 2002 and September 2013). We used the 6.2 version of GIPSY-OASIS software to process GPS data in Precise Point Positioning mode (PPP). In order to obtain the position time series in the whole period of these episodic campaigns, all the GPS observations from 1999 to 2013 campaigns were processed with an identical standard procedure. We compared our velocity field estimation with respect to GEODVEL tectonic model to obtain the residual velocity field of the Bajo Segura Basin. We estimated a ~N-S shortening with deformation rates varying between 0.2 and 0.6 mm/yr. These results are consistent with local geological deformation rates although slightly higher. They also fit well with regional geodetic data estimated for the Western Mediterranean.\n\nTransformation from Paleo-Asian Ocean closure to Paleo-Pacific subduction: New constraints from granitoids in the eastern Jilin-Heilongjiang Belt, NE China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMa, Xing-Hua; Zhu, Wen-Ping; Zhou, Zhen-Hua; Qiao, Shi-Lei\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe eastern Jilin-Heilongjiang Belt (EJHB) of NE China is a unique orogen that underwent two stages of evolution within the tectonic regimes of the Paleo-Asian and Paleo-Pacific oceans. 158 available zircon U-Pb ages, including 26 ages obtained during the present study and 132 ages from the literature, were compiled and analyzed for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic granitoids from the EJHB and the adjacent Russian Sikhote-Alin Orogenic Belt (SAOB), to examine the temporal-spatial distribution of the granitoids and to constrain the tectonic evolution of the East Asian continental margin. Five stages of granitic magmatism can be identified: Early Triassic (251-240 Ma), Late Triassic (228-215 Ma), latest Triassic to Middle Jurassic (213-158 Ma), Early Cretaceous (131-105 Ma), and Late Cretaceous to Paleocene (95-56 Ma). The Early Triassic granitoids are restricted to the Yanbian region along the Changchun-Yanji Suture, and show geochemical characteristics of magmas from a thickened lower crust source, probably due to the final collision of the combined NE China blocks with the North China Craton. The Late Triassic granitoids, with features of A-type granites, represent post-collisional magmatic activities that were related to post-orogenic extension, marking the end of the tectonic evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. The latest Triassic to Paleocene granitoids with calc-alkaline characteristics were NE-trending emplaced along the EJHB and SAOB and young towards the coastal region, and represent continental marginal arc magmas that were associated with the northwestwards subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. Two periods of magmatic quiescence (158-131 and 105-95 Ma) correspond to changes in the subduction direction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate from oblique relative to the continental margin to subparallel. Taking all this into account, we conclude that: (1) the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean occurred along the Changchun-Yanji Suture during the Early Triassic; (2) the\n\nRegional frequency analysis of observed sub-daily rainfall maxima over eastern China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSun, Hemin; Wang, Guojie; Li, Xiucang; Chen, Jing; Su, Buda; Jiang, Tong\n\n2017-02-01\n\nBased on hourly rainfall observational data from 442 stations during 1960-2014, a regional frequency analysis of the annual maxima (AM) sub-daily rainfall series (1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-h rainfall, using a moving window approach) for eastern China was conducted. Eastern China was divided into 13 homogeneous regions: Northeast (NE1, NE2), Central (C), Central North (CN1, CN2), Central East (CE1, CE2, CE3), Southeast (SE1, SE2, SE3, SE4), and Southwest (SW). The generalized extreme value performed best for the AM series in regions NE, C, CN2, CE1, CE2, SE2, and SW, and the generalized logistic distribution was appropriate in the other regions. Maximum return levels were in the SE4 region, with value ranges of 80-270 mm (1-h to 24-h rainfall) and 108-390 mm (1-h to 24-h rainfall) for 20- and 100 yr, respectively. Minimum return levels were in the CN1 and NE1 regions, with values of 37-104 mm and 53-140 mm for 20 and 100 yr, respectively. Comparing return levels using the optimal and commonly used Pearson-III distribution, the mean return-level differences in eastern China for 1-24-h rainfall varied from -3-4 mm to -23-11 mm (-10%-10%) for 20-yr events, reaching -6-26 mm (-10%-30%) and -10-133 mm (-10%-90%) for 100-yr events. In view of the large differences in estimated return levels, more attention should be given to frequency analysis of sub-daily rainfall over China, for improved water management and disaster reduction.\n\nLithospheric convective removal related post-collisional middle Eocene magmatism along the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture zone (NE Turkey).\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGÃ¶Ã§mengil, GÃ¶nenÃ§; KaracÄ±k, Zekiye; GenÃ§, Å. Can\n\n2017-04-01\n\nObliteration of the Mesozoic Neo-Tethyan Ocean and succeeding collision of the micro plates along the northern part of Turkey lead the development of the Ä°zmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture zone (IAESZ). The suturing and collision stages terminate with the amalgamation of the three different crustal blocks (Pontides, Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex and Anatolide-Tauride Block) in the Paleocene-Early Eocene period. After the collisional stage; a new phase of extension and magmatism concomitantly developed at the both sides and as well as along the IAESZ during the Middle Eocene period. However, the origin, mechanism and driving force of the post-collisional magmatism is still enigmatic. To understand and better constrain the syn-to post collisional evolutionary stages, we have carried out volcano-stratigraphy and geochemistry based study on the middle Eocene magmatic associations along a transect ( 100 km) from Pontides to the Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex (CACC) at the NE part of the Turkey. Middle Eocene magmatic activity in the region has been represented by calc-alkaline, alkaline, shoshonitic volcanic and granitic rocks together with scarce gabbroic intrusions. We particularly focused on middle Eocene volcano-sedimentary successions (MEVSS) to constrain the tectono-magmatic evolution of the abovementioned transect. The volcano-sedimentary succsessions are coevally developed and cover the crustal blocks (Pontides and CACC) and the IAESZ with a region wide unconformity. We have differentiated three lava series (V1-V2-V3) and their sub-groups (V1a-V1b; V2a-V2b) in MEVSS. Generally, all lava series have middle-K to shoshonitic composition with distinct subduction characteristics. V1 series is marked by presence of hydrous phenocrysts such as amphibole+biotite. V1a sub-group constitute the first volcanic product and characterized by the high Mg# (42-69); alkaline basaltic andesite, and hawaiites. V1b sub-group is represented by calc-alkaline, low Mg# (24\n\nDiachronous demise of the Neotethys Ocean as driver for non-cylindrical orogenesis in Anatolia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVan Hinsbergen, D. J. J.; Gurer, D.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nContinent-continent collision drives crustal deformation, topographic rise, and geodynamic change. Africa-Eurasia convergence accommodated in the Eastern Mediterranean involved subduction of the Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere in Anatolia. Subduction was followed by collision of Greater Adria continental crust with Eurasia forming the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture zone. Discerning the effects of this collision from pre-collisional ophiolite obduction-related orogeny of Greater Adria is notoriously difficult, and estimates from Central Anatolia based on a forearc-to-foreland basin transition along the Eurasian margin suggest a 60 Ma initial collision. Here we assess whether this age is also representative for collision in eastern Anatolia across the Cenozoic Sivas basin that straddles the Greater Adria-Europe suture by retro-deforming regional block rotations in the Pontides, KÄ±rÅehir and Taurides, building a first-order regional `block circuit' around the Sivas basin. We show that up to 700 km of convergence must have been accommodated after central Anatolian KÄ±rÅehir-Pontide collision at 65-60 Ma across the Sivas Basin - an order of magnitude more than estimated crustal shortening. We consequently infer that oceanic subduction continued much longer in eastern Anatolia, perhaps into the Oligocene or beyond, demonstrating the a recently postulated greater paleogeographic width of the Neotethys in eastern Anatolia. Prolonged oceanic subduction likely resulted from a paleogeography with a sharp kink in the former KÄ±rÅehir-Tauride passive margin. The strong non-cylindricity of the Anatolian collisional orogen is explained continued slab pull during ongoing oceanic subduction in eastern Anatolia following central Anatolian collision.\n\nTectonics of the KÄ±zÄ±lÄ±rmak Delta and Sinop Basin, offshore Pontides, evidence from new, high resolution seismic and bathymetric data.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaÅimoÄlu, B. Y.; Cifci, G.; Lacassin, R.; FernÃ¡ndez-Blanco, D.; Ozel, O.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe KÄ±zÄ±lÄ±rmak River is the one of the largest river in Turkey, flowing across two key features characteristic of the Late Cenozoic tectonic evolution of Northern Turkey: the North Anatolian Fault and the Pontides. The offshore part of the fan delta of the KÄ±zÄ±lÄ±rmak river is of particular interest, since it contains valuable information on the 3D delta structure directly related to the river dynamics, and encompasses essential tectonic and bathymetric features like the Sinop graben and Archangelsky ridge. We present new high-resolution multichannel seismic data and multibeam bathymetric data that have been collected in this area by researchers and PhD/MSc students of Dokuz EylÃ¼l University, Institute of Marine Sciences and Technology with R/V Koca Piri Reis. 17 seismic lines, for a total of 1300km, have been acquired and processed in order to enhance the visualization of the stratigraphy and of tectonic structures, and to remove multiples. In our preliminary interpretation of the seismic data we observe a thick pile of sediments of probable upper Cenozoic age lying of top of an erosional surface possibly related to the Messinian salinity crisis or to older events. These sediments are affected both by gravitational processes and by normal faulting, related to the actively growing Sinop graben. The Archangelsky ridge is well resolved down to 3-4s and appears to be bounded by active normal faults and likely crosscut by strike-slip faults. Our bathymetric data reveals the submarine channel of the YeÅilÄ±rmak river, which connects to the paleo streambed of the KÄ±zÄ±lÄ±rmak river. This is the first high resolution seismic dataset that has been collected in this area, and in our ongoing study we aim at integrating this state-of-the-art new data with the onshore evolution of the KÄ±zÄ±lÄ±rmak delta. This will potentially bring a valuable new perspective to reconcile sedimentation rates and the offshore delta-architecture with the onshore delta dynamics, and can\n\nLatest Pleistocene to Holocene Thrusting Recorded by a Flight of Strath Terraces in the Eastern Qilian Shan, NE Tibetan Plateau\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXiong, Jianguo; Li, Youli; Zhong, Yuezhi; Lu, Honghua; Lei, Jinghao; Xin, Weilin; Wang, Libo; Hu, Xiu; Zhang, Peizhen\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAt the eastern Qilian Shan mountain front in the NE Tibetan Plateau, the Minle-Damaying Fault (MDF), the southernmost fault of the North Frontal Thrust (NFT) system, has previously been proposed as an inactive structure during the Holocene. Here we present a detailed record of six strath terraces of the Xie River that document the history of active deformation of the MDF. One optically stimulated luminescence dating sample constrains abandonment of the highest terrace T6 at 12.7 Â± 1.4 ka. The formation ages of the lower terraces (T4-T1) are dated by AMS 14C dating. The cumulative vertical offsets of the MDF recorded by these terraces are determined as 12.2 Â± 0.4 m (T6), 8.0 Â± 0.4 m (T5), 6.4 Â± 0.4 m (T4), 4.6 Â± 0.1 m (T3), and 3.2 Â± 0.2 m (T1c) by an unmanned aerial vehicle system, respectively. A long-term vertical slip rate of the MDF of 0.9 Â± 0.2 mm/yr is then estimated from the above data of terrace age and vertical offset by a linear regression. Assuming that the fault dip of 35 Â± 5Â° measured at the surface is representative for the depth-averaged fault dip, horizontal shortening rates of 0.83-1.91 mm/yr are inferred for the MDF. Our new data show that the proximal fault (the MDF) of the NFT system at the eastern Qilian Shan mountain front has remained active when the deformation propagated basinward, a different scenario from that observed at both the western and central Qilian Shan mountain front.\n\nNe-20/Ne-22 in the Martian Atmosphere: New Evidence from Martian Meteorites\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPark, J.; Nyquist, L.

In contrast, obtained trapped (Ne-20/Ne-22)Tr approx.7 from an impact melt vein in Yamato 793605 (Y-793605) and concluded that the isotopic composition of Martian Ne remained poorly defined. A \"pyroxene-rich\" separate from Dhofar 378 (Dho 378) analyzed gave a comparatively high trapped Ne concentration and (Ne-20/Ne-22) = 7.3+/-0.2 in agreement with the Y-793605 value. We explore the hypothesis that Martian Ne was trapped in the Dho 378 meteorite in a manner similar to entrapment of terrestrial Ne in tektites strengthening the \"Martian atmosphere\" interpretation. We also report new data for Northwest Africa 7034 (NWA 7034) that are consistent with the Ne data for Dho 378.\n\nThe Electrical Resistivity Structure of the Eastern Anatolian Collision Zone, Northeastern Anatolia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCengiz, Ãzlem; TuÇ§rul BaÅokur, Ahmet; Tolak ÃiftÃ§i, Elif\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe Northeastern Anatolia is located at the intensely deformed Eastern Anatolian Collision Zone (EACZ), and its tectonic framework is characterized by the collision of the Arabian plate with Eurasian. Although extensive attention is given to understand the crustal and upper mantle processes at this convergent boundary, there is still an ongoing debate over the geodynamic processes of the region. In this study, we were specifically interested in the geoelectric properties and thus geodynamics of the crust beneath the EACZ. Magnetotelluric (MT) measurements were made on two profiles across the north of the EACZ in 1998 as part of a national project undertaken by the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO). MT data in the frequency range of 300-0.001 Hz were collected from 168 stations located along 78 km north to south and 47 km west to east profiles where direct convergence occurs between Arabian and Eurasian plates. Two and three-dimensional inversion algorithms were used to obtain resistivity models of the study area. According to these models, the upper crust consists of low resistivity sedimentary rocks (<30 Î©m) that are underlain by highly resistive (~500-1000 Î©m) crystalline basement rocks of the Eastern Anatolian Accretionary Complex and Pontides. While the upper and lower crustal resistivity at the northern part of the study area shows a layered structure, significant horizontal and vertical variations for the rest of the EACZ exists on resistivity models. The broad low resistivity zones (<50 Î©m) observed at mid and lower crustal levels throughout the EACZ. These fluid-rich regions along with high temperatures could indicate weak zones representing the locations of active deformation induced by continent-continent collision and correlate with volcanic centers in the region. The variation in the resistivity structure supports the southward subduction model with the resistive continental block and the deep conductive zones presumably corresponding to the\n\nGeothermal Prospecting with Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System Technologies in Xilingol Volcanic Field in the Eastern Inner Mongolia, NE China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPeng, F.; Huang, S.; Xiong, Y.; Zhao, Y.; Cheng, Y.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nGeothermal energy is a renewable and low-carbon energy source independent of climate change. It is most abundant in Cenozoic volcanic areas where high temperature can be obtained within a relatively shallow depth. Like other geological resources, geothermal resource prospecting and exploration require a good understanding of the host media. Remote sensing (RS) has the advantages of high spatial and temporal resolution and broad spatial coverage over the conventional geological and geophysical prospecting, while geographical information system (GIS) has intuitive, flexible, and convenient characteristics. In this study, we apply RS and GIS technics in prospecting the geothermal energy potential in Xilingol, a Cenozoic volcanic field in the eastern Inner Mongolia, NE China. Landsat TM/ETM+ multi-temporal images taken under clear-sky conditions, digital elevation model (DEM) data, and other auxiliary data including geological maps of 1:2,500,000 and 1:200,000 scales are used in this study. The land surface temperature (LST) of the study area is retrieved from the Landsat images with the single-channel algorithm on the platform of ENVI developed by ITT Visual Information Solutions. Information of linear and circular geological structure is then extracted from the LST maps and compared to the existing geological data. Several useful technologies such as principal component analysis (PCA), vegetation suppression technique, multi-temporal comparative analysis, and 3D Surface View based on DEM data are used to further enable a better visual geologic interpretation with the Landsat imagery of Xilingol. The Preliminary results show that major faults in the study area are mainly NE and NNE oriented. Several major volcanism controlling faults and Cenozoic volcanic eruption centers have been recognized from the linear and circular structures in the remote images. Seven areas have been identified as potential targets for further prospecting geothermal energy based on the visual\n\nScattering study of the Ne + NeH+(v0 = 0, j0 = 0) â NeH+ + Ne reaction on an ab initio based analytical potential energy surface\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKoner, Debasish; Barrios, Lizandra; GonzÃ¡lez-Lezana, TomÃ¡s; Panda, Aditya N.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nInitial state selected dynamics of the Ne + NeH+(v0 = 0, j0 = 0) â NeH+ + Ne reaction is investigated by quantum and statistical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods on the ground electronic state.

A collinear [NeHNe]+ structure lying 0.72 eV below the Ne + NeH+ asymptote is found to be the most stable geometry for this system. Energies of low lying vibrational states have been computed for this stable complex. Reaction probabilities obtained from quantum calculations exhibit dense oscillatory structures, particularly in the low energy region and these get partially washed out in the integral cross section results. SQM predictions are devoid of oscillatory structures and remain close to 0.5 after the rise at the threshold thus giving a crude average description of the quantum probabilities. Statistical cross sections and rate constants are nevertheless in sufficiently good agreement with the quantum results to suggest an important role of a complex-forming dynamics for the title reaction.\n\nProduction of Ne Auger electrons by Ne/+/ bombardment of Mg and Al surfaces\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFerrante, J.; Pepper, S.

The experiments involved the bombardment of Mg and Al surfaces with Ne(+) ions. A LEED-Auger system equipped with an ion gun and a four-grid retarding potential analyzer operated in the usual dN(E)/dE mode was used.\n\nQuantifying Arabia-Eurasia convergence accommodated in the Greater Caucasus by paleomagnetic reconstruction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan der Boon, A.; van Hinsbergen, D.

G.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nSince the late Eocene, convergence and subsequent collision between Arabia and Eurasia was accommodated both in the overriding Eurasian plate forming the Greater Caucasus orogen and the Iranian plateau, and by subduction and accretion of the Neotethys and Arabian margin forming the East Anatolian plateau and the Zagros. To quantify how much Arabia-Eurasia convergence was accommodated in the Greater Caucasus region, we here provide new paleomagnetic results from 97 volcanic sites (â¼500 samples) in the Talysh Mountains of NW Iran, that show â¼15Â° net clockwise rotation relative to Eurasia since the Eocene. We apply a first-order kinematic restoration of the northward convex orocline that formed to the south of the Greater Caucasus, integrating our new data with previously published constraints on rotations of the Eastern Pontides and Lesser Caucasus. This suggests that north of the Talysh â¼120 km of convergence must have been accommodated. North of the Eastern Pontides and Lesser Caucasus this is significantly more: 200-280 km. Our reconstruction independently confirms previous Caucasus convergence estimates. Moreover, we show for the first time a sharp contrast of convergence between the Lesser Caucasus and the Talysh. This implies that the ancient Paleozoic-Mesozoic transform plate boundary, preserved between the Iranian and East-Anatolian plateaus, was likely reactivated as a right-lateral transform fault since late Eocene time.\n\nKM3NeT\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Jong, M.\n\n2015-07-01\n\nKM3NeT is a large research infrastructure, that will consist of a network of deep-sea neutrino telescopes in the Mediterranean Sea.

The metavolcanic rocks mainly consist of basaltic andesite/andesite and mafic cognate xenolith-bearing rhyolite with their pyroclastic equivalents, which are interbedded with recrystallized pelagic limestone and chert. The metasedimentary succession comprises recrystallized micritic limestone with rare volcanogenic metaclastic rocks and stratigraphically overlies the metavolcanic rocks. The geochemistry of the metavolcanic rocks indicates an arc setting evidenced by depletion of HFSE (Ti, P and Nb) and enrichment of fluid mobile LILE. Identical trace and rare earth elements compositions of basaltic andesites/andesites and rhyolites suggest that they are cogenetic and derived from a common parental magma. The arc sequence crops out between an Albian-Turonian subduction-accretionary complex representing the Laurasian active margin and an ophiolitic mÃ©lange. Absence of continent derived detritus in the arc sequence and its tectonic setting in a wide Cretaceous accretionary complex suggest that the KÃ¶sdaÄ Arc was intra-oceanic. Zircons from two metarhyolite samples give Late Cretaceous (93.8 Â± 1.9 and 94.4 Â± 1.9 Ma) U/Pb ages. These ages are the same as the age of the supra-subduction ophiolites in western Turkey, which implies that that the KÃ¶sdaÄ Arc may represent part of the incipient arc formed during the generation of the supra-subduction ophiolites. The low-grade regional metamorphism in the KÃ¶sdaÄ Arc is constrained to 69.9 Â± 0.4 Ma by 40Ar/39Ar muscovite dating indicating that the arc sequence became part of a wide Tethyan Cretaceous accretionary complex by the latest Cretaceous. Non-collisional cessation of the arc volcanism is possibly associated with southward migration of the magmatism as in the Izu\n\nScattering study of the Ne + NeH{sup +}(v{sub 0} = 0, j{sub 0} = 0) â NeH{sup +} + Ne reaction on an ab initio based analytical potential energy surface\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKoner, Debasish; Panda, Aditya N., E-mail: adi07@iitg.ernet.in; Barrios, Lizandra\n\n2016-01-21\n\nInitial state selected dynamics of the Ne + NeH{sup +}(v{sub 0} = 0, j{sub 0} = 0) â NeH{sup +} + Ne reaction is investigated by quantum and statistical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods on the ground electronic state.

At the eastern part of the basin, the paleocurrents were from north to south. It is scattered in the west of the basin, however, the main paleocurrent directions were from the north. Detrital zircons were analyzed using LA-ICP-MS in eleven samples from the turbiditic sandstones and two samples from the shelf sandstones. Four samples are from the western part (two samples from shelf sediments), four samples from the central part and five samples from the eastern part of the Lower Cretaceous basin. 1085 of 1348 zircon analyses are concordant with rates of 95-105% and the zircon ages range between 141 Â± 4 Ma (Berriasian) and 3469 Â± 8 Ma (Paleoarchean). 22% of the detrital zircon ages are Paleoproterozoic, 20% Archean, 16% Carboniferous, 13% Neoproterozoic, 8% Permian, 6% Triassic, 5% Mesoproterozoic and 11% other ages. In the western part of the basin the Carboniferous zircons constitute the main population with a less dominant peak at Ordovician, Cambrian and Late Neoproterozoic. The zircons from the center of the basin show scattered distribution with dominant populations in the Triassic, Permian, Carboniferous, Silurian, Paleoproterozoic, Early Neoproterozoic-Late Mesoproterozoic, and minor peak at Late Neoarchean. On the other hand, zircons from the eastern most part of the basin, show dominant peaks in the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoarchean and Permian with minor peaks in Triassic, Carboniferous and Silurian.

This group was previously classified as Paleoproterozoic in age. However, recent studies reported Paleozoic ages from the meta-volcanic rocks, Paleoproterozoic to Neoarchean detrital zircon ages from the meta-sedimentary rocks and Neoproterozoic ages from the granitoids. The tectonic affinity of the EB is still debated. In order to clarify the aforementioned issues, 19 samples were collected from the Xinghuadukou group from the Mohe region in NE China. All samples underwent gneiss facies metamorphism, including two-mica granitic gneiss and quartz biotite gneiss. Based on the protolith discrimination diagram of Siâ(al+fm)-(c+alk) system, 7 samples originated from sedimentary rocks and the other 12 of igneous origin. The orthogneiss samples were plotted as diorite, granodiorite and granite respectively in TAS, showing felsic character (SiO2 57% - 74%). One orthogneiss and one paragneiss samples were chosen to conduct the LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon age analysis. Apart from one zircon with the age of 742 Ma shows evident metamorphic rim, all zircons from the orthogneiss show euhedral to subhedral prismatic shape and typical concentric or oscillatory structure indicating the igneous origin. The concordant age of 2478Â±26 Ma was generated, indicating the existence of the near Archean basement of the EB. The detrital zircons from the paragneiss produced age populations cluster at 0.6, 0.8, 1.9, 2.6 and 2.7 Ga, lacking of the Grenville event age. The youngest zircon age is 395 Ma, taken as the maximum depositional age of the sedimentary protolith. According to the new data obtained, it is suggested that the Xinghuadukou group comprises the early Paleoproterozoic granite-gneiss, which proves the granitic basement of the Erguna block.

This thesis fi rst presents the motivation for sterile neutrino models by describing the short-baseline anomalies that can be addressed with them. This is followed by a discussion of the phenomenology of these models. The MiniBooNE experiment and results are then described in detail, particularly the most recent antineutrino analysis. This will be followed by a discussion of global fits to world data, including the anomalous data sets. Lastly, futuremoreÂ Â» experiments will be addressed, especially focusing on the MicroBooNE experiment and light collection studies. In particular, understanding the degradation source of TPB, designing the TPB-coated plates for MicroBooNE and developing lightguide collection systems will be discussed. We find an excess of events in the MiniBooNE antineutrino mode results consistent with the LSND anomaly, but one that has a di fferent energy dependence than the low-energy excess reported in neutrino mode. This disagreement creates tension within global fi ts which include up to three sterile neutrinos. The low-energy excess will be addressed by the MicroBooNE experiment, which is expected to start taking data in early 2015. Tension among existing experiments calls for additional, more decisive future experiments.Â«Â less\n\nContinuous opacity from Ne^-\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJohn, T. L.\n\n1996-04-01\n\nFree-free absorption coefficients of the negative neon ion are calculated by the phase-shift approximation based on multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock continuum wave functions. These wave functions accurately account for electron-neon correlation and polarization, and yield scattering cross-sections in excellent agreement with the latest experimental values. The coefficients are expected to give the best current estimates of Ne^- continuous absorption. We find that Ne^- makes only a small contribution (less than 0.3 per cent) to stellar opacities, including hydrogen-deficient stars with enhanced Ne abundances.\n\nPaleomagnetic data support Early Permian age for the Abor Volcanics in the lower Siang Valley, NE India: Significance for Gondwana-related break-up models\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAli, Jason R.; Aitchison, Jonathan C.; Chik, Sam Y. S.; Baxter, Alan T.; Bryan, Scott E.\n\n2012-05-01\n\nConfusion exists as to the age of the Abor Volcanics of NE India. Some consider the unit to have been emplaced in the Early Permian, others the Early Eocene, a difference of Ë230 million years. The divergence in opinion is significant because fundamentally different models explaining the geotectonic evolution of India depend on the age designation of the unit. Paleomagnetic data reported here from several exposures in the type locality of the formation in the lower Siang Valley indicate that steep dipping primary magnetizations (mean = 72.7 Â± 6.2Â°, equating to a paleo-latitude of 58.1Â°) are recorded in the formation. These are only consistent with the unit being of Permian age, possibly Artinskian based on a magnetostratigraphic argument. Plate tectonic models for this time consistently show the NE corner of the sub-continent >50Â°S; in the Early Eocene it was just north of the equator, which would have resulted in the unit recording shallow directions. The mean declination is counter-clockwise rotated by Ë94Â°, around half of which can be related to the motion of the Indian block; the remainder is likely due local Himalayan-age thrusting in the Eastern Syntaxis. Several workers have correlated the Abor Volcanics with broadly coeval mafic volcanic suites in Oman, NE Pakistan-NW India and southern Tibet-Nepal, which developed in response to the Cimmerian block peeling-o"
