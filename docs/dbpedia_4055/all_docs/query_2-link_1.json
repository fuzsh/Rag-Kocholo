Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Devrekani is essentially constant during the winter, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 3, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 1% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in Devrekani\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in DevrekaniDecJanFeb0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%FallSpringDec 10%Dec 10%Feb 280%Feb 280%Jan 10%Jan 10%Feb 10%Feb 10%drydry\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Devrekani is essentially constant during the winter, remaining within 0.4 miles per hour of 7.8 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on February 6, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.2 miles per hour, while on May 24, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 5.7 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during the winter is 8.2 miles per hour on February 6.\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in Devrekani\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in DevrekaniDecJanFeb0 mph0 mph2 mph2 mph4 mph4 mph6 mph6 mph8 mph8 mph10 mph10 mph12 mph12 mphFallSpringFeb 68.2 mphFeb 68.2 mphDec 17.4 mphDec 17.4 mphFeb 287.9 mphFeb 287.9 mphJan 17.8 mphJan 17.8 mph\n\nThe wind direction in Devrekani during the winter is predominantly out of the south from December 1 to February 27 and the west from February 27 to February 28.\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in Devrekani\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in DevrekaniSWDecJanFeb0%100%20%80%40%60%60%40%80%20%100%0%FallSpringwestsouthnortheast\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nWater Temperature\n\nDevrekani is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in Devrekani is rapidly decreasing during the winter, falling by 10Â°F, from 55Â°F to 45Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nAverage Water Temperature in the Winter in Devrekani\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Devrekani typically lasts for 5.6 months (172 days), from around May 1 to around October 21, rarely starting before April 8 or after May 21, and rarely ending before September 28 or after November 10.\n\nThe winter in Devrekani is reliably fully outside of the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Winter in Devrekani\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Winter in DevrekaniDecJanFeb0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%FallSpring0%Jan 150%Jan 15Nov 1010%Nov 1010%freezingvery coldcoldfrigidcool\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Devrekani are very rapidly decreasing during the winter, decreasing by 1,819Â°F, from 1,822Â°F to 4Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in Devrekani\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in DevrekaniDecJanFeb0Â°F0Â°F500Â°F500Â°F1,000Â°F1,000Â°F1,500Â°F1,500Â°F2,000Â°F2,000Â°FFallSpringDec 11,822Â°FDec 11,822Â°FFeb 284Â°FFeb 284Â°F\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Devrekani is rapidly increasing during the winter, rising by 1.5 kWh, from 1.9 kWh to 3.4 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nThe lowest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during the winter is 1.7 kWh on December 22.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in Devrekani\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in DevrekaniDecJanFeb0 kWh0 kWh1 kWh1 kWh2 kWh2 kWh3 kWh3 kWh4 kWh4 kWh5 kWh5 kWh6 kWh6 kWhFallSpringDec 221.7 kWhDec 221.7 kWhDec 11.9 kWhDec 11.9 kWhFeb 283.4 kWhFeb 283.4 kWhFeb 12.4 kWhFeb 12.4 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Devrekani are 41.603 deg latitude, 33.839 deg longitude, and 3,602 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Devrekani contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 515 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 3,587 feet. Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (2,854 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (8,455 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Devrekani is covered by cropland (84%) and grassland (10%), within 10 miles by cropland (47%) and trees (30%), and within 50 miles by trees (53%) and cropland (20%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Devrekani, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Devrekani.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Devrekani according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Devrekani is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Devrekani and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nSinop Airport (LTCM, 39%, 75 mi, northeast, -3,497 ft elevation change)\n\nCaycuma (LTAS, 29%, 106 mi, west, -3,153 ft elevation change)\n\nAnkara EsenboÄa International Airport (LTAC, 33%, 111 mi, southwest, -479 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Devrekani and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
