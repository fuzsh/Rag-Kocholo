        "text": "The Harley Dome Cologne event was a friendly, professionally organized gathering of around 3,000 Harley-Davidson bikers. It took place at the scenic \"Tanzbrunnen\" open-air event area and boasted many bands with national and international reputation. Excellent custom bikes were there to be admired - in the exhibition area as well as the ones brought along by the participants. A must-see for all of you next year.
