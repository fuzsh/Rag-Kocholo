        "text": "The Southeast Anatolian ophiolites outcropping in the Southeast Anatolian Orogenic Belt (Southeast of Turkey) mark the closure of the southern branch of the Neotethys Ocean associated with the collision between the Arabian Plate and Anatolian microplate. We present new geochemical, zircon U-Pb age, zircon Lu-Hf, and Sr-Nd isotopic data on the Southeast Anatolian Ophiolites to understand their formation ages, magma genesis, and geotectonic implications. The ophiolites, which are related to island arc igneous rocks, consist of mantle peridotites and crustal rocks (less dunite, gabbros, sheeted dykes, massive, and pillow basalts). The flat rare-earth element (REE) patterns, depletion in Nb and Ta, and enrichment in LILEs (Ba, Rb, Th, Sr, Pb) of gabbros suggest close similarities with very low Ti (boninitic) lavas found in the forearc regions. Using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, zircon separated from leucogabbros, diabase dykes, and plagiogranites yield U-Pb ages of 92 and 83 Ma, which are interpreted to represent the formation ages of the ophiolites. The zircons in the gabbros and plagiogranites are dominated by positive εHf(t) values (between +3.1 and + 17.45) with a few negative εHf(t) values. High εHf(t) features are consistent with derivation from Mid-oceanic Ridge Basalt (MORB)-source mantle. The negative εHf(t) values of the zircons suggest the involvement of subducted sedimentary rocks. The southeast Anatolian ophiolites represent an SSZ-type ophiolite and are part of the Late Cretaceous oceanic lithosphere of the southern branch of the Neotethys Ocean that opened during the Late Triassic and closed during the Late Cretaceous.\n\nThe eastern Mediterranean region within the Tethyan realm shows a high concentration of ophiolites with contrasting times of formation and emplacement along the belt: In the Balkans, the ophiolites formed during the early to medial Jurassic, and were obducted during the late Jurassic, whereas in Turkey and farther east, structurally intact Jurassic ophiolites are rare and Jurassic ophiolite obduction is unknown. Here we report a structurally intact, large ophiolite body of early Jurassic age from NE Turkey, the Refahiye ophiolite, located close to the suture zone between the Eastern Pontides and the Menderes-Taurus block. The Refahiye ophiolite forms an outcrop belt, 175 km long and 20 km wide, and is tectonically bound by the late Cretaceous ophiolitic mélange to the south, and by the North Anatolian Transform Fault against the Triassic low-grade metamorphic rocks to the north. Early to medial Jurassic very low- to low-grade metamorphic rocks, interpreted as intraoceanic subduction-accretion complexes, occur either beneath the ophiolite or as thrust slices within it. The ophiolite body within the studied section is made up of mantle peridotite (clinopyroxene-bearing harzburgite and minor dunite) crosscut by up to 20 cm thick veins of clinopyroxenite and later dikes/pods/stocks of gabbro ranging in size from 2 m to several hundreds of meters. The gabbro is represented by two distinct types: (i) cumulate gabbro, and (ii) non-cumulate gabbro with locally well-developed igneous foliation. Within the non-cumulate gabbro or enclosing peridotite, there are up to 5 m and 50 cm-thick veins of trondjemite and pegmatitic gabbro, respectively. LA-ICP-MS dating on zircons from two trondjemite samples yielded weighted mean ages of ~182 ± 3 Ma and 175 ± 4 Ma (2σ), respectively, suggesting formation during early Jurassic time. Formation in a suprasubduction-zone forearc setting is inferred from (i) wide-ranging pyroxene and spinel compositions in the peridotites as documented in most suprasubduction-zone ophiolites, (ii) arc tholeiitic signature of the non-cumulate gabbros, and (iii) association of the ophiolite with the coeval subduction-accretion complex. Emplacement of a trapped forearc ophiolite above its own subduction-accretion complex as a backstop is proposed based on a series of field relationships such as (i) intimate association of the unsubducted suprasubduction-zone ophiolite with coeval metamorphosed accretionary complexes, (ii) absence of unambiguous relationship to the southern Atlantic-type continental margin, and (iii) absence of any stratigraphic indications for the ophiolite obduction in the southern Atlantic-type continental margin during the Jurassic time. This is a clear difference from the Jurassic ophiolites in the Balkans which were obducted over the Atlantic-type continental margin. This difference in mode of emplacement is most probably related to the greater distance of the intra-oceanic subduction zone to the Atlantic-type continental margin than it was in the Balkans, which is commensurate with the greater width of the Tethys in the east during Jurassic time."
