        "text": "Neodymium Isotopic Compositions of the Titanite Reference Materials Used in U-Pb Geochronology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMa, Q.; Yang, Y.; Zhao, Z.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTitanite (CaTiSiO5) is a widespread mineral and preferentially incorporates considerable uranium and significant light rare earth elements (LREEs) in its structure. Geochronology based upon U-Pb and Pb-Pb analyses of titanite has proven to be useful for understanding the P-T-t evolution of many igneous, metamorphic and hydrothermally altered rock samples (Scott and St-Onge, 1995). In the meantime, Sm-Nd isotopic composition in single titanite can be used to obtain initial Nd isotope composition at the time of titanite crystallization when combined with its U-Pb age, making titanite the most versatile mineral for dating metamorphism and tracing hydrothermal source (Amelin et al., 2009). The widely utilized in situ analyses by SIMS and LA-(MC)-ICP-MS have emphasized the significance for uniform and homogeneous reference materials for external correction (Liu et al., 2012, Sun et al., 2012, Yang et al., 2014). Here, we present U-Pb ages and Sm-Nd isotope analyses of twelve natural titanite crystals (12YQ82, T004, Ontario, BLR-1, OLT1, Khan, Qinghu, TLS-36, NW-IOA, C253, Pakistan and MKED1) acquired by Agilent 7500a Q-ICP-MS and Neptune MC-ICP-MS, respectively, combined a 193 nm ArF excimer laser ablation system. For U-Pb dating, elemental fractionation and instrumental drift were externally corrected using MKED1 titanite standard, showing results of U-Pb analyses all within error of those recommended values. With respect to Sm-Nd isotopes, we employed the interference-free 147Sm/149Sm to deduct 144Sm isobaric interference on 144Nd, and the fractionation between 147Sm and 144Nd was calibrated using BLR-1 titanite, which is proved homogenous in Sm-Nd isotopic system. The obtained Sm-Nd isotopic compositions for natural titanite samples are all consistent with those values determined by isotope dilution (ID) MC-ICP-MS, demonstrating the precision and accuracy currently available for in situ Sm-Nd analyses. Our results demonstrate that BLR-1, OLT1 and Ontario titanites\n\nReply to Comment on \"Zircon U-Th-Pb dating using LA-ICP-MS: Simultaneous U-Pb and U-Th dating on the 0.1 Ma Toya Tephra, Japan\"\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIto, Hisatoshi\n\n2015-04-01\n\nGuillong et al. (2015) mentioned that corrections for abundance sensitivity for 232Th and molecular zirconium sesquioxide ions (Zr2O3+) are critical for reliable determination of 230Th abundances in zircon for LA-ICP-MS analyses. There is no denying that more rigorous treatments are necessary to obtain more reliable ages than those in Ito (2014). However, as shown in Fig. 2 in Guillong et al. (2015), the uncorrected (230Th)/(238U) for reference zircons except for Mud Tank are only 5-20% higher than unity. Since U abundance of Toya Tephra zircons that have U-Pb ages < 1 Ma is in-between that of FCT and Plesovice, the overestimation of 230Th by both abundance sensitivity and molecular interferences is expected to be 5-20% for the Toya Tephra. Moreover Ito (2014) obtained U-Th ages of the Toya Tephra by comparison with Fish Canyon Tuff (FCT) data. Because both the FCT and the Toya Tephra have similar trends of overestimation of 230Th, the effect of overestimation of 230Th to cause overestimation of U-Th age should be cancelled out or negligible. Therefore the pivotal conclusion in Ito (2014) that simultaneous U-Pb and U-Th dating using LA-ICP-MS is possible and useful for Quaternary zircons holds true.\n\nSimultaneous in situ determination of both U-Th-Pb and Sm-Nd isotopes in monazite by laser ablation using a magnetic sector ICP-MS and a multicollector ICP-MS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGoudie, D. J.; Fisher, C. M.; Hanchar, J. M.; Davis, W. J.; Crowley, J. L.; Ayers, J. C.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nWe present a method for the simultaneous in situ determination of U-Th-Pb and Sm-Nd isotopes in monazite, using a laser ablation (LA) system coupled to both a magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (HR) ICP-MS and a multicollector (MC) ICP-MS. The ablated material is split using a glass Y-connector and transported simultaneously to both mass spectrometers via helium carrier gas. The MC-ICP-MS is configured to provide relative Ce, Gd, and Eu contents, in addition to Sm and Nd. This approach obtains both age (U-Pb), tracer isotope (Sm-Nd), and REE element data (Ce, Gd, and Eu), in the same ablation volume, thus reducing sampling problems associated with fine-scale zoning and other internal structures. The accuracy and precision of the U-Pb data are demonstrated using six well characterized monazite reference materials from the Geological Survey of Canada (three of which are currently used as SHRIMP standards) and agree well with previously determined ID-TIMS ages. The accuracy of the Sm-Nd isotopic data was assessed by comparison to TIMS measurements on a well-characterized in-house monazite standard. The dual LA-ICP-MS method was applied to the Birch Creek Pluton (BCP) in the White Mountains, California in a case study to test the utility of U-Th-Pb dating coupled with Sm-Nd (and Ce, Gd, Eu) isotopic data for solving geologic problems. Previous work on the Cretaceous BCP [1] used Th-Pb ages coupled with O isotopic data to constrain hydrothermal fluid events, as recorded in monazite. The original study suggested that the high delta 18O monazite in Paleozoic country rocks adjacent to the BCP grew in response to fluid alternation associated with the intrusion of the BCP, based on overlapping age with the BCP. New monazite split-stream U-Pb and Sm-Nd data show that monazite from the BCP pluton and monazite from altered country rock have homogenous and overlapping initial Nd isotopic composition, further strengthening the proposal that monazite in\n\nCombined oxygen-isotope and U-Pb zoning studies of titanite: New criteria for age preservation\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBonamici, Chloe E.; Fanning, C. Mark; Kozdon, Reinhard; ...\n\n2015-02-11\n\nHere, titanite is an important U-Pb chronometer for dating geologic events, but its high-temperature applicability depends upon its retention of radiogenic lead (Pb). Experimental data predict similar rates of diffusion for lead (Pb) and oxygen (O) in titanite at granulite-facies metamorphic conditions (T = 650-800Â°C). This study therefore investigates the utility of O-isotope zoning as an indicator for U-Pb zoning in natural titanite samples from the Carthage-Colton Mylonite Zone of the Adirondack Mountains, New York. Based on previous field, textural, and microanalytical work, there are four generations (types) of titanite in the study area, at least two of which preservemoreÂ Â» diffusion-related Î´ 18O zoning. U-Th-Pb was analyzed by SIMS along traverses across three grains of type-2 titanite, which show well-developed diffusional Î´ 18O zoning, and one representative grain from each of the other titanite generations.Â«Â less\n\nHydrothermal titanite from the Chengchao iron skarn deposit: temporal constraints on iron mineralization, and its potential as a reference material for titanite U-Pb dating\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHu, Hao; Li, Jian-Wei; McFarlane, Christopher R. M.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nUranium-lead isotopes and trace elements of titanite from the Chengchao iron skarn deposit (Daye district, Eastern China), located along the contact zones between Triassic marine carbonates and an early Cretaceous intrusive complex consisting of granite and quartz diorite, were analyzed using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to provide temporal constraints on iron mineralization and to evaluate its potential as a reference material for titanite U-Pb geochronology. Titanite grains from mineralized endoskarn have simple growth zoning patterns, exhibit intergrowth with magnetite, diopside, K-feldspar, albite and actinolite, and typically contain abundant primary two-phase fluid inclusions. These paragenetic and textural features suggest that these titanite grains are of hydrothermal origin. Hydrothermal titanite is distinct from the magmatic variety from the ore-related granitic intrusion in that it contains unusually high concentrations of U (up to 2995 ppm), low levels of Th (12.5-453 ppm), and virtually no common Pb. The REE concentrations are much lower, as are the Th/U and Lu/Hf ratios. The hydrothermal titanite grains yield reproducible uncorrected U-Pb ages ranging from 129.7 Â± 0.7 to 132.1 Â± 2.7 Ma (2Ï), with a weighted mean of 131.2 Â± 0.2 Ma [mean standard weighted deviation (MSWD) = 1.7] that is interpreted as the timing of iron skarn mineralization. This age closely corresponds to the zircon U-Pb age of 130.9 Â± 0.7 Ma (MSWD = 0.7) determined for the quartz diorite, and the U-Pb ages for zircon and titanite (130.1 Â± 1.0 Ma and 131.3 Â± 0.3 Ma) in the granite, confirming a close temporal and likely genetic relationship between granitic magmatism and iron mineralization. Different hydrothermal titanite grains have virtually identical uncorrected U-Pb ratios suggestive of negligible common Pb in the mineral. The homogeneous textures and U-Pb characteristics of Chengchao hydrothermal titanite suggest that the mineral might be a\n\nEffective LA-ICP-MS dating of common-Pb bearing accessory minerals with new data reduction schemes in Iolite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKamber, Balz S.; Chew, David M.; Petrus, Joseph A.\n\n2014-05-01\n\ncan be undertaken using either the 204Pb, 207Pb or 208Pb(no Th) methods. After common Pb correction to the user-selected age standard integrations, the scheme fits session-wide model U-Pb fractionation curves to the time-resolved U-Pb standard data. This down hole fractionation model is next applied to the unknowns and sample-standard bracketing (using a user specified interpolation method) is used to calculate final isotopic ratios and ages. 204Pb- and 208Pb(no Th)-corrected concordia diagrams and 204Pb-, 207Pb- and 208Pb(no Th)-corrected age channels can be calculated for user-specified initial Pb ratio(s). All other conventional common Pb correction methods (e.g. intercept or isochron methods on co-genetic analyses) can be performed offline.

The analyses were performed on unpolished zircon prism faces (termed rim analyses) and on crystal interiors exposed through mechanical grinding an polishing (interior analyses). 206 Pb/ 238 U ages are corrected for Th-disequilibrium based on published and calculated distribution coefficients for U and Th using average whole-rock and individually analyzed zircon compositions. The data presented in this article were used for the Th-disequilibrium correction of (U-Th)/He zircon geochronology data in the research article entitled \"The onset of the volcanism in the Ciomadul Volcanic Dome Complex (Eastern Carpathians): eruption chronology and magma type variation\" (MolnÃ¡r et al., 2018) [1].\n\nBreaking through the uncertainty ceiling in LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHorstwood, M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nSources of systematic uncertainty associated with session-to-session bias are the dominant contributor to the 2% (2s) uncertainty ceiling that currently limits the accuracy of LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology. Sources include differential downhole fractionation (LIEF), `matrix effects' and ablation volume differences, which result in irreproducibility of the same reference material across sessions. Current mitigation methods include correcting for LIEF mathematically, using matrix-matched reference materials, annealing material to reduce or eliminate radiation damage effects and tuning for robust plasma conditions. Reducing the depth and volume of ablation can also mitigate these problems and should contribute to the reduction of the uncertainty ceiling. Reducing analysed volume leads to increased detection efficiency, reduced matrix-effects, eliminates LIEF, obviates ablation rate differences and reduces the likelihood of intercepting complex growth zones with depth, thereby apparently improving material homogeneity. High detection efficiencies (% level) and low sampling volumes (20um box, 1-2um deep) can now be achieved using MC-ICP-MS such that low volume ablations should be considered part of the toolbox of methods targeted at improving the reproducibility of LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology. In combination with other strategies these improvements should be feasible on any ICP platform. However, reducing the volume of analysis reduces detected counts and requires a change of analytical approach in order to mitigate this. Appropriate strategies may include the use of high efficiency cell and torch technologies and the optimisation of acquisition protocols and data handling techniques such as condensing signal peaks, using log ratios and total signal integration. The tools required to break the 2% (2s) uncertainty ceiling in LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology are likely now known but require a coherent strategy and change of approach to combine their implementation and realise\n\nComment on \"Zircon U-Th-Pb dating using LA-ICP-MS: Simultaneous U-Pb and U-Th dating on 0.1 Ma Toya Tephra, Japan\" by Hisatoshi Ito\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuillong, M.; Schmitt, A. K.; Bachmann, O.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nLaser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) of eight zircon reference materials and synthetic zircon-hafnon end-members indicate that corrections for abundance sensitivity and molecular zirconium sesquioxide ions (Zr2O3+) are critical for reliable determination of 230Th abundances in zircon. Other polyatomic interferences in the mass range 223-233 amu are insignificant. When corrected for abundance sensitivity and interferences, activity ratios of (230Th)/(238U) for the zircon reference materials we used average 1.001 Â± 0.010 (1Ï error; mean square of weighted deviates MSWD = 1.45; n = 8). This includes the 91500 and PleÅ¡ovice zircons, which were deemed unsuitable for calibration of (230Th)/(238U) by Ito (2014). Uranium series zircon ages generated by LA-ICP-MS without mitigating (e.g., by high mass resolution) or correcting for abundance sensitivity and molecular interferences on 230Th such as those presented by Ito (2014) are potentially unreliable.\n\nMineral chemistry and shrimp U-Pb Geochronology of mesoproterozoic polycrase-titanite veins in the sullivan Pb-Zn-Ag Deposit, British Columbia\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSlack, J.F.; Aleinikoff, J.N.; Belkin, H.E.; Fanning, C.M.; Ransom, P.W.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nSmall polycrase-titanite veins 0.1-2 mm thick cut the tourmalinite feeder zone in the deep footwall of the Sullivan Pb-Zn-Ag deposit, southeastern British Columbia. Unaltered, euhedral crystals of polycrase and titanite 50-100 ??m in diameter are variably replaced by a finer-grained alteration-induced assemblage composed of anhedral polycrase and titanite with local calcite, albite, epidote, allanite, and thorite or uranothorite (or both). Average compositions of the unaltered and altered polycrase, as determined by electron-microprobe analysis, are (Y0.38 REE0.49 Th0.10 Ca0.04 Pb0.03 Fe0.01U0.01) (Ti1.48 Nb0.54 W0.04 Ta0.02)O6 and (Y0.42 REE0.32 Th0.15 U0.06 Ca0.04 Pb0.01 Fe0.01) (Ti1.57 Nb0.44 W0.04 Ta0.02)O6, respectively. The unaltered titanite has, in some areas, appreciable F (to 0.15 apfu), Y (to 0.40 apfu), and Nb (to 0.13 apfu). SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology of eight grains of unaltered polycrase yields a weighted 207Pb/206Pb age of 1413 ?? 4 Ma (2??) that is interpreted to be the age of vein formation. This age is 50-60 m.y. younger than the ca. 1470 Ma age of synsedimentary Pb-Zn-Ag mineralization in the Sullivan deposit, which is based on combined geological and geochronological data. SHRIMP ages for altered polycrase and titanite suggest later growth of minerals during the ???1370-1320 Ma East Kootenay and ???1150-1050 Ma Grenvillian orogenies. The 1413 ?? 4 Ma age for the unaltered polycrase in the veins records a previously unrecognized post-ore (1370 Ma) mineralizing event in the Sullivan deposit and vicinity. The SHRIMP U-Pb age of the polycrase and high concentrations of REE, Y, Ti, Nb, and Th in the veins, together with elevated F in titanite and the absence of associated sulfides, suggest transport of these high-field-strength elements (HFSE) by F-rich and S-poor hydrothermal fluids unrelated to the fluids that formed the older Fe-Pb-Zn-Ag sulfide ores of the Sullivan deposit. Fluids containing abundant REE, HFSE, and F may have been derived from a\n\nExploring the U-Pb systematics of titanite from the Archean Stillwater Complex\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFriedman, R. M.; Wall, C. J.; Scoates, J. S.; Weis, D. A.; Meurer, W. P.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe Stillwater Complex is a large mafic-ultramafic layered intrusion in the Beartooth Mountains of Montana (USA) and host to the world-class J-M Reef platinum group element deposit. The size and geologic/economic importance of this igneous complex make it an important target for high-precision U-Pb dating. As a part of a comprehensive U-Pb study of the Stillwater Complex, we present ID-TIMS U-Pb titanite data, including new single grain results produced using the EARTHTIME ET535 spike, for very low-volume, relatively felsic granophyric and pegmatitic rocks associated with Stillwater layered rocks. Four samples studied include a pegmatitic ksp-qtz core to a gabbroic pegmatoid in the Lower Banded Series (N1), an alaskite (quartz diorite) and an amphibole-rich reaction zone between the alaskite and anorthosite (AN1) in the Middle Banded Series, and an amphibole-bearing granophyre from the Upper Banded Series (GN3). CA-TIMS U-Pb dating of zircon from these samples yielded concordant results only for the pegmatitic rock (weighted 207Pb/206Pb: 2709.65 Â± 0.80 Ma, n = 5), which agrees with new zircon ages from Stillwater layered rocks. Results for high-U (up to 1438 ppm) metamict zircon that occurs in the other three rocks were highly discordant and did not yield precise ages. Titanite U-Pb results for the pegmatite are about -1% to +1% discordant with two groupings of 207Pb/206Pb dates: one with a weighted average of 2708.1 Â± 2.0 Ma (n = 2), which overlaps in age with zircon from the same sample and the crystallization age of the Stillwater Complex, and a second, younger grouping of 2701.1 Â± 1.3 Ma (n = 5). Younger dates record an early Pb-loss event, possibly related to intrusion of cross-cutting quartz monzonites. The alaskite data also shows two groupings of 207Pb/206Pb dates, although more subtle: a weighted average of 2709.3 Â± 1.8 Ma (n = 3) and a single result of 2706.5 Â± 1.7 Ma. Titanite from the other two samples has undergone significant Pb-loss.

Zircons occur in three morphologic populations: (1) equant to stubby, multifaceted, colorless, (2) prismatic, dark brown, with numerous cracks, and (3) elongate, prismatic, light tan to colorless. Cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging of the three populations shows simple concentric oscillatory zoning. The zircon TIMS age [weighted average of 207Pb/206Pb ages from Group 3 grains-450.5 ?? 1.6 Ma (MSWD=1.11)] and SHRIMP age [composite of 206Pb/238 U age data from all three groups-448.2 ?? 2.7 Ma (MSWD = 1.3)], are interpreted to suggest a relatively simple crystallization history. Titanite from the granodioritic gneiss occurs as both brown and colorless varieties. Scanning electron microscope backscatter (BSE) images of brown grains show multiple cross-cutting oscillatory zones of variable brightness and dark overgrowths. Colorless grains are unzoned or contain subtle wispy or very faint oscillatory zoning. Electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) clearly distinguishes the two populations. Brown grains contain relatively high concentrations of Fe2O3, Ce2O3 (up to ~ 1.5 wt.%), Nb2O5, and Zr. Cerium concentration is positively correlated with total REE + Y concentration, which together can exceed 3.5 wt.%. Oscillatory zoning in brown titanite is correlated with variations in REE concentrations. In contrast, colorless titanite (both as discrete grains and overgrowths on brown titanite) contains lower concentrations of Y, REE, Fe2O3, and Zr, but somewhat higher Al2O3 and Nb2O5. Uranium concentrations and Th/U discriminate between brown grains (typically 200-400 ppm U; all analyses but one have Th/U between about 0.8 and 2) and colorless grains (10-60 ppm U; Th/U of 0-0.17).

V.; Van Soest, M. C.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe newly developed 'laser ablation double dating' (LADD) technique, an integrated laser microprobe U/Pb and (U-Th)/He dating method, could be an exceptionally valuable tool in detrital thermochronology for identifying sedimentary provenance and evaluating the exhumation history of a source region. A recent proof-of-concept study has used LADD to successfully date both zircon and titanite crystals from the well-characterized Fish Canyon tuff, but we also believe that another accessory mineral, rutile, could be amenable to dating via the LADD technique. To continue the development of the method, we present an application of LADD to detrital zircon, titanite, and rutile from a sample collected on the lower Naryani River of central Nepal. Preliminary analyses of the sample have yielded zircon U/Pb dates ranging from 31.4 to 2405 Ma; zircon (U-Th)/He from 1.8 to 15.4 Ma; titanite U/Pb between 18 and 110 Ma; titanite (U-Th)/He between 1 and 16 Ma; rutile U/Pb from 6 to 45 Ma; and rutile (U-Th)/He from 2 to 25 Ma. In addition to the initial data, we can use Ti-in-zircon, Zr-in-titanite, and Zr-in-rutile thermometers to determine the range of possible long-term cooling rates from grains with U/Pb ages younger than collision. Thus far our results from zircon analyses imply a cooling rate of approximately 15Â°C/Myr; titanite analyses imply between 10 and 67Â°C/Myr; and rutile between 9 and 267Â°C/Myr. This spread in potential cooling rates, especially in the order of magnitude differences of cooling rates calculated from the rutile grains, suggests that the hinterland source regions of the Naryani river experienced dramatically different exhumation histories during Himalayan orogenisis. Ongoing analyses will expand the dataset such that we can more adequately characterize the range of possibilities represented in the sample.\n\nDifferentiating Metamorphic Events in a Polymetamorphic Terrane using Zr-in-Ttn thermometry and Titanite U-Pb Geochronology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKenney, M.; Roeske, S.; Mulcahy, S. R.; Cottle, J. M.; Coble, M. A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn polymetamorphic terranes, it is problematic to link ages from geochronometers to metamorphic fabrics and, therefore, to a specific deformation event(s). It is necessary to analyze a mineral which may preserve multiple age domains. Titanite has been shown to retain multiple age and elemental domains in single grains through high-grade metamorphism. In this study, titanite U-Pb geochronology is used to examine whether ages are thermally reset along a sample transect towards a mylonitic shear zone in NW Argentina. This work also seeks to understand the conditions under which titanite resists resetting. A combination of petrographic and electron microprobe analyses reveal the textures and compositional domains in titanite, garnet, and hornblende. Titanite are elongate, wrapped by the mylonitic fabric, and have patchy elemental zoning. Garnet has distinct cores with prograde zoning and thin rims, which appear to be in equilibrium with the fabric defining minerals. Hornblende has inclusion rich cores and thin overgrowth rims in equilibrium with the fabric defining minerals. In-situ U-Pb and trace element data was collected in titanite from four samples, which all preserve lower-intercept ages between 900Ma and 1.0Ga. We observed no correlation between age and elemental domains; these domains correlate with Al and Nb variations. Zr-in-titanite temperatures preserve upper amphibolite facies conditions, 660ÂºC-710ÂºC. Given these results, we conclude that titanite U-Pb ages and temperatures reflect original Grenville metamorphism. 40Ar/39Ar hornblende cooling ages, of 515 Ma, suggested titanite may be reset near the shear zone but overprinting P-T of 560ÂºC and 0.8 GPa, fluid infiltration, and deformation did not cause significant Pb loss. Overprinting conditions and cooling ages suggest that rims of garnet and hornblende correlate to Paleozoic metamorphism, while textural evidence and titanite ages suggest garnet and hornblende cores grew during the Proterozoic.\n\nU-Pb systematics in coexisting zircon, rutile and titanite from granophyres in the Archean Stillwater Complex: metamictization and the fate of radiogenic Pb\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFriedman, R. M.; Wall, C. J.; Scoates, J. S.; Meurer, W. P.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nSelf-irradiation of zircon causes structural damage (metamictization) that can result in the loss of radiogenic Pb during interaction with aqueous solutions. To evaluate this behavior in metamict zircon, and in other U-bearing accessory phases like titanite and rutile, we are examining the U-Pb systematics of granophyric rocks from the ca. 2.7 Ga Stillwater layered intrusion, Montana. Four samples were studied in detail, including a pegmatitic ksp-qtz core to a gabbroic pegmatoid in the Lower Banded Series (N1), an alaskite and an amphibole-rich reaction zone between the alaskite and anorthosite (AN1) in the Middle Banded Series, and an amphibole-bearing granophyre from the Upper Banded Series (GN3). Except in the pegmatite, zircon is variably metamict with amorphous zones characterized by distinctive Ca-enrichment. Single zircon grains were analyzed by ID-TIMS following annealing and chemical abrasion, and multi-grain (n=4-5) fractions of titanite and rutile were analyzed by conventional ID-TIMS; the UBC 233-235U-205Pb isotopic tracer is calibrated against mixed U-Pb gravimetric reference solutions made available through the EarthTime initiative. The U-Pb systematics are coherent only for the pegmatite yielding both a Concordia age of 2709.60 Â± 0.80 Ma (2Ï, including tracer calibration, decay-constant errors not included) for low-U zircon (76-237 ppm) and concordant titanite results with 207Pb/206Pb ages from 2701-2710 Ma. The results for high-U zircon (up to 1438 ppm) for the other three samples are strongly discordant (9-43%, 85-89%, 28-71%, respectively) with a wide range of 207Pb/206Pb ages (2583-2647 Ma, 2210-2357 Ma, 2345-2499 Ma). Given the extreme incompatibility of Pb2+ in zircon and the highly metamict state of zircon in these granophyres, we are investigating the extent to which radiogenic lead is selectively removed during the chemical abrasion and annealing process from step-wise leaching experiments and image analysis (CL, SEM).

The instrumental operating conditions were optimized for the measurement of Cs, Th and U. Rhodium (Rh) was used as an internal standard element to compensate matrix effect. Detection limits for Th, U and Cs were 5.7-17.8 pg x mL(-1). The recoveries for spiking liver samples were 96%-107%, and their RSDs were 4.8%-8.9%. Reference materials of NIST SRM 8414 Bovine and NIST SRM 1486 Bone Meal were analyzed by the described method, and the analytical results agreed well with the reference values. Human autopsy tissues samples were digested by mixed acid (HNO3 + HClO4). The determination of Cs, Th and U in lung, liver, bone, heart, stomach, spleen, muscle, kidney, thyroid gland and intestinum tenue was performed by ICP-MS without separation and enrichment procedures. The obtained results indicated that this method is rapid, sensitive and accurate; the distribution of the three elements is different from one to another human organ sample; the main organ targets for Th and U are lungs and kidneys; and a coordinated variation of Cs, Th and U concentration in lungs was found in the samples collected from Hebei and Sichuan provinces.\n\nProspects for dating monazite via single-collector HR-ICP-MS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKohn, M. J.; Vervoort, J. D.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nICP-MS analysis permits rapid and precise dating of minerals with high U and Th contents. Here we describe a new method for in situ determination of 206Pb/238U, 207Pb/^{235}U, ^{208}Pb/232Th, and 207Pb/206Pb ages in monazite via laser ablation (New Wave Research UP-213 laser system), single-collector, magnetic sector ICP-MS (ThermoFinnigan Element2), using spot sizes of 8-30 Î¼m, a repetition rate of 5 Hz, and a fluence of 10 J/cm2. Based on analysis of 9 monazite samples of known ages ranging from 280 to 1800 Ma, analytical precision (single sample) is Â±2-3% (2Ï), and reproducibility (single sample) is Â±2-4% (2Ï), yielding age precisions of Â±3- 5% (2Ï) for single points, or Â±1-2% (2 s.e.) for pooled multiple analyses (n > 4). Issues of accuracy are paramount. 207Pb/206Pb ages are consistently the most accurate and agree to Â±2% with accepted TIMS ages. In contrast, 206Pb/238U, 207Pb/^{235}U, and ^{208}Pb/232Th ages can differ by as much as Â±5% (2Ï), a problem that has also been observed for SIMS Th-Pb dating. The sources of the interelement standardization disparities among monazites remain enigmatic, but do not result from molecular interferences on Pb, U, or Th peaks. Unresolvable mass interference between 204Pb and trace contaminant 204Hg in commercial Ar gas precludes precise common Pb corrections. Instead common Pb corrections are made assuming concordancy between 207Pb/^{235}U and either 206Pb/238U or ^{208}Pb/232Th ages. The new method offers rapid analysis (~1 minute), minimal sample preparation (polished thin section), and high sensitivity. Comparatively large errors on the 206Pb/238U, 207Pb/^{235}U, and ^{208}Pb/232Th ages will likely restrict analysis of younger monazite grains (<250 Ma) to applications where 5% accuracy is sufficient. Older grains (c. 500 Ma and older) can be dated more precisely and accurately using 207Pb/206Pb. One application to young materials involves dating a large vein monazite from the Llallagua tin district of Bolivia\n\nAssay Methods for 238U, 232Th, and 210Pb in Lead and Calibration of 210Bi Bremsstrahlung Emission from Lead\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOrrell, John L.; Aalseth, Craig E.; Arnquist, Isaac J.\n\n2016-02-13\n\nAssay methods for measuring 238U, 232Th, and 210Pb concentrations in refined lead are presented. The 238U and 232Th concentrations are assayed via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after anion exchange column separation on dissolved lead samples. The 210Pb concentration is inferred through Î±-spectroscopy of a daughter isotope, 210Po, after chemical precipitation separation on dissolved lead samples. Subsequent to the 210Po Î±-spectroscopy assay, a method for evaluating 210Pb concentrations in solid lead samples was developed via measurement of bremsstrahlung radiation from Î²-decay of a daughter isotope, 210Bi, by employing a 14-crystal array of high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. Ten sourcesmoreÂ Â» of refined lead were assayed. The 238U concentrations were <34 microBq/kg and the 232Th concentrations ranged <0.6 â 15 microBq/kg, as determined by the ICP-MS assay method. The 210Pb concentrations ranged from ~0.1 â 75 Bq/kg, as inferred by the 210Po Î±-spectroscopy assay method.Â«Â less\n\nGeochronology and trace element geochemistry of titanite in the Machangqing Cu-Mo-dominated polymetallic deposit, Yunnan Province, southwest China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFu, Yu; Sun, Xiaoming; Hollings, Pete; Li, Dengfeng; Yang, Tianjian\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe Machangqing Cu-Mo-dominated polymetallic deposit is a porphyry-skarn-epithermal Cu-Mo (-Au) metallogenic system located in the middle part of the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan alkaline porphyry metallogenic belt. The skarn mineralization of the Machangqing deposit mainly occurs along the contacts between the alkalic porphyry intrusions and the surrounding Lower Ordovician Xiangyang Formation rocks. We present LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages and trace element data for titanite from the Machangqing deposit in order to investigate the origin of this deposit. Based on mineral textures and assemblages, two types of titanite are recognized in Machangqing: magmatic titanite (Type I) from the granite porphyry and hydrothermal titanite from the mineralized skarn. The coarse-grained magmatic titanite is euhedral and occurs as discrete grains in the interstices of feldspar, quartz and biotite, whereas fine- to medium-grained hydrothermal titanite crystals (Type II) are euhedral to subhedral and occur in association with skarn minerals such as garnet, pyroxene and magnetite. Magmatic titanite has lower FeO, Al2O3, F and Nb/Ta but higher TiO2, Th/U, HFSEs and Lu/Hf than hydrothermal titanite. The magmatic titanite has higher LREE/HREE ratios and total REE contents with stronger negative Eu anomalies than its mineralized skarn counterpart. Trace elemental characteristics of hydrothermal titanite in Machangqing are consistent with relatively low F contents and oxygen fugacities when compared to the neighboring Beiya gold-dominated polymetallic deposit in the same metallogenic belt. The weighted average 206Pb/238U age of 34.3 Â± 1.2 Ma of hydrothermal titanite is within error but slightly younger than the age of magmatic titanite (37.5 Â± 4.1 Ma), indicating that the skarn mineralization followed the emplacement of the granite porphyry and was broadly coeval with the porphyry mineralization. The porphyry and skarn types of mineralization at Machangqing were formed from the same metallogenic\n\nLA-ICP-MS Pb-U Dating of Young Zircons from the Kos-Nisyros Volcanic Centre, SE Aegean Arc (Greece)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuillong, M.; Von Quadt, A.; Peytcheva, I.; Bachmann, O.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nZircon Pb-U dating has become a key technique for answering many important questions in geosciences. This paper describes a new LA-ICP-MS approach. We show, using previously dated samples of a large quaternary rhyolitic eruption in the Kos-Nisyros volcanic centre (the 161 ka Kos Plateau Tuff), that the precision of our LA-ICP-MS method is as good as via SHRIMP, while ID-TIMS measurements confirm the accuracy. Gradational age distribution over >140 ka of the Kos zircons and the near-absence of inherited cores indicate near-continuous crystallisation in a growing magma reservoir with little input from wall rocks. Previously undated silicic eruptions from Nisyros volcano (Lower Pumice, Nikia Flow, Upper Pumice), which are stratigraphically constrained to have happened after the Kos Plateau Tuff, are dated to be younger than respectively 124 Â± 35 ka, 111 Â± 42 ka and 70 Â± 24 ka. Samples younger than 1 Ma were corrected for initial thorium disequilibrium using a new formula that also accounts for disequilibrium in 230Th decay.

There is a need to quantify such exposure, with the possibility that the testing may post-date exposure by months or years. Therefore, it is important to develop a very sensitive test to measure precisely the isotopic composition of uranium in urine at low levels of concentration. The results of an interlaboratory comparison using sector field (SF)-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and multiple collector (MC)-ICP-MS for the measurement of uranium concentration and U/U and U/U isotopic ratios of human urine samples are presented. Three urine samples were verified to contain uranium at 1-5 ng L and shown to have natural uranium isotopic composition. Portions of these urine batches were doped with depleted uranium (DU) containing small quantities of U, and the solutions were split into 100 mL and 400 mL aliquots that were subsequently measured blind by three laboratories. All methods investigated were able to measure accurately U/U with precisions of approximately 0.5% to approximately 4%, but only selected MC-ICP-MS methods were capable of consistently analyzing U/U to reasonable precision at the approximately 20 fg L level of U abundance. Isotope dilution using a U tracer demonstrates the ability to measure concentrations to better than +/-4% with the MC-ICP-MS method, though sample heterogeneity in urine samples was shown to be problematic in some cases. MC-ICP-MS outperformed SF-ICP-MS methods, as was expected. The MC-ICP-MS methodology described is capable of measuring to approximately 1% precision the U/U of any sample of human urine over the entire range of uranium abundance down to <1 ng L, and detecting very small amounts of DU contained therein.\n\nZircon, titanite, and apatite (U-Th)/He ages and age-eU correlations from the Fennoscandian Shield, southern Sweden\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuenthner, William R.; Reiners, Peter W.; Drake, Henrik; Tillberg, Mikael\n\n2017-07-01\n\nCraton cores far from plate boundaries have traditionally been viewed as stable features that experience minimal vertical motion over 100-1000 Ma time scales. Here we show that the Fennoscandian Shield in southeastern Sweden experienced several episodes of burial and exhumation from 1800 Ma to the present. Apatite, titanite, and zircon (U-Th)/He ages from surface samples and drill cores constrain the long-term, low-temperature history of the Laxemar region. Single grain titanite and zircon (U-Th)/He ages are negatively correlated (104-838 Ma for zircon and 160-945 Ma for titanite) with effective uranium (eU = U + 0.235 Ã Th), a measurement proportional to radiation damage. Apatite ages are 102-258 Ma and are positively correlated with eU. These correlations are interpreted with damage-diffusivity models, and the modeled zircon He age-eU correlations constrain multiple episodes of heating and cooling from 1800 Ma to the present, which we interpret in the context of foreland basin systems related to the Neoproterozoic Sveconorwegian and Paleozoic Caledonian orogens. Inverse time-temperature models constrain an average burial temperature of 217Â°C during the Sveconorwegian, achieved between 944 Ma and 851 Ma, and 154Â°C during the Caledonian, achieved between 366 Ma and 224 Ma. Subsequent cooling to near-surface temperatures in both cases could be related to long-term exhumation caused by either postorogenic collapse or mantle dynamics related to the final assembly of Rodinia and Pangaea. Our titanite He age-eU correlations cannot currently be interpreted in the same fashion; however, this study represents one of the first examples of a damage-diffusivity relationship in this system, which deserves further research attention.\n\nLA-ICP-MS depth profile analysis of apatite: Protocol and implications for (U-Th)/He thermochronometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJohnstone, Samuel; Hourigan, Jeremy; Gallagher, Christopher\n\n2013-05-01\n\nHeterogeneous concentrations of Î±-producing nuclides in apatite have been recognized through a variety of methods. The presence of zonation in apatite complicates both traditional Î±-ejection corrections and diffusive models, both of which operate under the assumption of homogeneous concentrations. In this work we develop a method for measuring radial concentration profiles of 238U and 232Th in apatite by laser ablation ICP-MS depth profiling. We then focus on one application of this method, removing bias introduced by applying inappropriate Î±-ejection corrections. Formal treatment of laser ablation ICP-MS depth profile calibration for apatite includes construction and calibration of matrix-matched standards and quantification of rates of elemental fractionation. From this we conclude that matrix-matched standards provide more robust monitors of fractionation rate and concentrations than doped silicate glass standards. We apply laser ablation ICP-MS depth profiling to apatites from three unknown populations and small, intact crystals of Durango fluorapatite. Accurate and reproducible Durango apatite dates suggest that prolonged exposure to laser drilling does not impact cooling ages. Intracrystalline concentrations vary by at least a factor of 2 in the majority of the samples analyzed, but concentration variation only exceeds 5x in 5 grains and 10x in 1 out of the 63 grains analyzed. Modeling of synthetic concentration profiles suggests that for concentration variations of 2x and 10x individual homogeneous versus zonation dependent Î±-ejection corrections could lead to age bias of >5% and >20%, respectively. However, models based on measured concentration profiles only generated biases exceeding 5% in 13 of the 63 cases modeled. Application of zonation dependent Î±-ejection corrections did not significantly reduce the age dispersion present in any of the populations studied. This suggests that factors beyond homogeneous Î±-ejection corrections are the dominant\n\nNew Robust Reference Materials for In Situ Single Grain Rutile U-Pb Geochronology and Method Refinements for Detrital Rutile Analysis by LA-MC-ICP-MS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nParrish, R. R.; Bracciali, L.; Condon, D. J.; Horstwood, M. S.; Najman, Y.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nWhile rutile (TiO2) occurs in the heavy mineral suite of detrital sediments and originates mainly in medium- to high-grade metamorphic and some igneous rocks, there are very few applications of U-Pb dating of rutile to provenance studies; this is due to an overreliance on zircon, low U content of rutile limiting measurement quality by in situ methods, a higher proportion of common Pb relative to zircon, and a lack of widely available good quality reference materials. We have addressed these issues and characterized two ~ 1.8 Ga rutile reference materials by SEM, trace elements, U-Pb ID-TIMS, and intra-grain and inter-grain U-Pb LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis using mixed faraday and multiple ion counting detectors with high sensitivity. We have assessed U-Pb discordance and in situ variations in relative common Pb and age and their bearing on the quality of the reference materials for in situ U-Pb dating. The rutiles (Sugluk-4 and PCA-S207) come from granulite facies belts of the Canadian Shield, namely the northern Cape Smith Belt of Quebec and the Snowbird Tectonic Zone (Sasatchewan). The ID-TIMS data are slightly discordant due to variable common Pb and limited Pb loss; the variation in 6 single grains of Sugluk-4, that we use as the primary reference material, is <1% in 206Pb/238U, and <2% for 207Pb/206Pb (95 % conf.); after common Pb correction these variations are <1%. The measured variations are smaller than in existing reference materials (i.e. R10) in current use. LA-ICP-MC-MS data (n ~ 500 for each) have a reproducibility of 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/206Pb of ~2-4% (at the 2S level), which is only modestly worse than long-term data for multiple zircon standards, this being due to the real variation in measured values arising from limited Pb loss, age variation, and common Pb variability [1]. We have applied our refined method to the provenance of rutile from drainages from British Columbia, Bhutan, and the Brahmaputra River of NE India (predominant rutile ages ~ 50, 15\n\nAllanite age-dating: Non-matrix-matched standardization in quadrupole LA-ICP-MS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBurn, M.; Lanari, P.; Pettke, T.; Engi, M.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nAllanite Th-U-Pb age-dating has recently been found to be powerful in unraveling the timing of geological processes such as the metamorphic dynamics in subduction zones and crystallization velocity of magmas. However, inconsistencies among analytical techniques have raised doubts about the accuracy of allanite age data. Spot analysis techniques such as LA-ICP-MS are claimed to be crucially dependent on matrix-matched standards, the quality of which is variable. We present a new approach in LA-ICP-MS data reduction that allows non-matrix-matched standardization via well constrained zircon reference materials as primary standards. Our data were obtained using a GeoLas Pro 193 nm ArF excimer laser ablation system coupled to an ELAN DRC-e quadrupole ICP-MS. We use 32 Î¼m and 24 Î¼m spot sizes; laser operating conditions of 9 Hz repetition rate and 2.5 J/cm2 fluence have proven advantageous. Matrix dependent downhole fractionation evolution is empirically determined by analyzing 208Pb/232Th and 206Pb/238U and applied prior to standardization. The new data reduction technique was tested on three magmatic allanite reference materials (SISSb, CAPb, TARA); within error these show the same downhole fractionation evolution for all allanite types and in different analytical sessions, provided measurement conditions remain the same. Although the downhole evolution of allanite and zircon differs significantly, a link between zircon and allanite matrix is established by assuming CAPb and TARA to be fixed at the corresponding reference ages. Our weighted mean 208Pb/232Th ages are 30.06 Â± 0.22 (2Ï) for SISSb, 275.4 Â± 1.3 (2Ï) for CAPb, and 409.9 Â± 1.8 (2Ï) for TARA. Precision of single spot age data varies between 1.5 and 8 % (2Ï), dependent on spot size and common lead concentrations. Quadrupole LA-ICP-MS allanite age-dating has thus similar uncertainties as do other spot analysis techniques. The new data reduction technique is much less dependent on quality and homogeneity\n\nMagmatic Longevity Constrained by ID-TIMS U-Pb Dating of Zircon and Titanite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSzymanowski, D.; Wotzlaw, J. F.; Ellis, B. S.; Bachmann, O.; Von Quadt, A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nClues about the timescales and thermal conditions associated with the growth and evacuation of large silicic magma reservoirs are frequently drawn from radiometric dating, diffusion modelling, or thermomechanical modelling. A growing amount of petrological and geochronological evidence, supported by thermal modelling, suggests that many silicic magma reservoirs may exist for some 104-106 years in the form of high-crystallinity mushes at relatively low temperatures ( 700-750Â°C; [1-3]). Geochronological studies addressing this issue typically utilise the U-Pb system in zircon capable of recording extended periods of crystallisation, particularly in evolved calc-alkaline systems that spend most of their lifetime zircon-saturated. In this study, we integrate U-Pb dating of zircon and titanite to investigate the longevity of the magma reservoir that produced the Kneeling Nun Tuff, a 35 Ma, >900 km3 crystal-rich rhyolitic super-eruption from the Mogollon-Datil volcanic field in New Mexico (USA). High-precision ID-TIMS U-Pb dates of single crystals of both zircon and titanite independently record a continuous crystallisation history over >400,000 years. We combine the dating of both accessory phases with textural, major, trace element and isotopic studies of single crystals, placing tight constraints on the thermal conditions of magma accumulation and storage while recording differentiation and rejuvenation processes within the magma reservoir. The results suggest a protracted `cool' upper-crustal storage of magma prior to the Kneeling Nun Tuff eruption followed by a melting event which reduced the magma crystallinity and conditioned it for eruption.

S.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nCrust-mantle evolution studies are greatly informed by zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic datasets and the ease with which these data can now be acquired has seen their application become commonplace. In order to deconvolute geochemical change and interpret geologic variation in complexly zoned zircons, this information is most ideally obtained on the smallest volume of zircon by successive SIMS U-Pb and LA-MC-ICP-MS Lu-Hf isotopic analyses. However, due to variations in zircon growth zone geometry at depth, the Lu-Hf analysis may not relate to the lower volume U-Pb analysis, potentially causing inaccuracy of the resultant age-corrected Hf isotope signature. Laser ablation split-stream methods are applied to be certain that U-Pb and Lu-Hf data represent the same volume of zircon, however, the sampling volume remains relatively large at 40x30Âµm1. Coupled ID-TIMS U-Pb and solution MC-ICP-MS Lu-Hf work traditionally utilize whole-zircon dissolution ( 10-50ng Hf), which has the potential to homogenize different zones of geologic significance within an analysis. Conversely, modern ID-TIMS U-Pb methods utilize microsampling of zircon grains, often providing < 5ng Hf, thereby challenging conventional Lu-Hf acquisition protocols to achieve the required precision. In order to obtain usable precision on minimal zircon volumes, we developed laser ablation methods using successive 25um spot U-Pb and Lu-Hf ablation pits with a combined depth of 18um, and low-volume solution introduction methods without Hf-REE separation utilizing Hf amounts as low as 0.4ng, while retaining an uncertainty level of ca. 1 ÉHf for both methods. We investigated methods of Yb interference correction and the potential for matrix effects, with a particular focus on the accurate quantification of 176Lu/177Hf. These improvements reduce the minimum amount of material required for U-Pb and Hf isotopic analysis of zircon by about an order of magnitude. 1Ibanez-Mejia et al (2015).

M.; Donelick, M. B.; Donelick, R. A.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nSand from three river systems in North Idaho (Snake River near Lewiston, Clearwater River near Lewiston and the Salmon River near White Bird) and two regional ash fall events (Mt. Mazama and Mt. St. Helens) were collected for zircon U-Pb detrital age analysis. Up to 120 grains of zircon per sample were ablated using a Resonetics M-50 193 nm ArF Excimer laser ablation (LA) system and the Pb, Th, and U isotopic signals were quantified using an Agilent 7700x quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Isotopic signals for major, minor, and trace elements, including all REEs, were also monitored. The youngest zircon U-Pb ages from the river samples were approximately 44 Ma; Cenozoic Idaho Batholith and Precambrian Belt Supergroup ages were well represented. Significant common Pb contamination of the Clearwater River sample (e.g., placer native Cu was observed in the sample) precluded detailed analysis of the zircon U-Pb ages but no interpretable ages <44 Ma were observed. Interestingly, not one of the river samples yielded zircon U-Pb ages near 0 Ma, despite all three catchment areas having received significant ash from Mt. St. Helens in 1980, and Mount Mazama 7,700 years ago, and no doubt other events during the Quaternary. Work currently in progress seeks to address bias against near 0 Ma ages in the catchment areas due to: a) small, local ash fall grain sizes and b) overwhelming number of older grains relative to the ash fall grains. Data from Mt. St. Helens ash from several localities near the mountain (Toutle River and Maple Flats, WA) and several far from the mountain (Spokane, WA; Princeton, ID; Kalispell, MT) and Mt. Mazama ash fall deposits near Lewiston, ID and Spokane, WA will be presented to address these possibilities. Additionally, fission track and U-Pb ages from apatites collected from these river and ash fall samples will also be shown to help constrain the problem.\n\nTitanite chronology, thermometry, and speedometry of ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) calc-silicates from south Madagascar: U-Pb dates, Zr temperatures, and lengthscales of trace-element diffusion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolder, R. M.; Hacker, B. R.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nCalc-silicate rocks are often overlooked as sources of pressure-temperature-time data in granulite-UHT metamorphic terranes due to the strong dependence of calc-silicate mineral assemblages on complex fluid compositions and a lack of thermodynamic data on common high-temperature calc-silicate minerals such as scapolite. In the Ediacaran-Cambrian UHT rocks of southern Madagascar, clinopyroxene-scapolite-feldspar-quartz-zircon-titanite calc-silicate rocks are wide-spread. U-Pb dates of 540-520 Ma from unaltered portions of titanite correspond to cooling of the rocks through upper-amphibolite facies and indicate UHT metamorphism occurred before 540 Ma. Zr concentrations in these domains preserve growth temperatures of 900-950 Â°C, consistent with peak temperatures calculated by pseudosection modeling of nearby osumilite-bearing gneisses. Younger U-Pb dates (510-490 Ma) correspond to fluid-mediated Pb loss from titanite grains, which occurred below their diffusive Pb-closure temperature, along fractures. The extent of fluid alteration is seen clearly in back-scattered electron images and Zr-, Al-, Fe-, Ce-, and Nb-concentration maps. Laser-ablation depth profiling of idioblastic titanite grains shows preserved Pb diffusion profiles at grain rims, but there is no evidence for Zr diffusion, indicating that it was effectively immobile even at UHT.\n\nU-Pb systematics of zircon and titanite from the Gardnos impact structure, Norway: Evidence for impact at 546 Ma?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKalleson, E.; Corfu, F.; Dypvik, H.\n\n2009-05-01\n\nZircon and titanite were investigated in impactites of the Gardnos structure, a crater formed in Sveconorwegian (ca. 1 Ga) crust, which was then overridden in the Devonian by Caledonian nappes. Observed deformation features in zircons are granular texture, planar microstructures, and likely the incorporation of organic carbon during impact causing black staining of the zircon grains. The grains were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cathode luminescence (CL) and dated by U-Pb isotope dilution - thermo-ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS). Zircon grains without impact related features have U-Pb data showing moderate discordance (5-13%) and indicating formation ages mostly in the range of 1600-1000 Ma, except detrital zircon ages as old as >2481 Ma, reflecting the diversity of target rocks in the area. Titanite with concordant ages of 995-999 Ma dates metamorphism during final juxtaposition of the Telemarkia on the Idefjorden terrane to the east. Zircon grains with demonstrated or presumed shock features yield highly discordant (14-40%) U-Pb data, with a majority of them plotting along an array with a lower intercept of about 340 Ma reflecting the influence of the Caledonian orogeny and recent Pb-loss. One zircon grain was totally reset at 379 Ma during late Caledonian metamorphism, which also caused local growth of new titanite. A specific group of zircon grains yields data with relatively high discordance for moderate U contents, and five of these analyses, including that of a grain with proven granular or aggregate texture, fit a discordia line with an upper intercept of 546 Â± 5 Ma. These features are interpreted as indicating zircon break-down to an amorphous state during impact, with subsequent recrystallization into microcrystalline aggregates causing extensive to complete Pb loss. We further suggest that their crystallinity prevented Pb loss during the Caledonian orogeny, while the small subgrain size and increasing metamictisation allowed\n\nPrecise and accurate in situ Pb-Pb dating of apatite, monazite, and sphene by laser ablation multiple-collector ICP-MS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilligers, B.

W.\n\n2002-03-01\n\nTo evaluate in situ Pb dating by laser ablation multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS), we analysed apatite, sphene, and monazite from Paleoproterozoic metamorphic rocks from West Greenland. Pb isotope ratios were also determined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 610 glass standard and were corrected for mass fractionation by reference to the measured thallium isotope ratio. The NIST 610 glass was used to monitor Pb isotope mass fractionation in the low Tl/Pb accessory minerals. Replicate analyses of the glass (1 to 2 min) yielded ratios with an external reproducibility comparable to conventional analyses of standard reference material 981 by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS). Mineral grains were generally analysed with a 100-Î¼m laser beam, although some monazite crystals were analysed at smaller spot sizes (10 and 25 Î¼m). The common Pb isotope ratios required for age calculations were either measured on coexisting plagioclase by LA-MC-ICP-MS or could be ignored, as individual crystals exhibit sufficient Pb isotopic heterogeneity to perform isochron calculations on replicate analyses of single crystals. Mean mineral ages with the 204Pb ion beam measured in the multiplier were as follows: apatite, 1715 Â± 23 m.y.; sphene, 1789 Â± 11 m.y.; and monazite, 1783 to 1888 m.y., with relative uncertainties on individual monazite ages of <0.2% but highly reproducible age determinations on single monazite crystals (âª1%). Isochron ages calculated from several mineral analyses without assumption of common Pb also yield precise age determinations. Apatite and monazite Pb ages determined by in situ Pb isotope analysis are identical to those determined by conventional TIMS analysis of bulk mineral separates, and the analytical uncertainties of these short laser analyses with no prior mechanical or chemical separation are comparable to those obtained by TIMS.

V.; Xiao, W.; Van Soest, M. C.; Cai, K.; Zhang, B.; Mercer, C. M.; Yuan, C.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nGeochronology and thermochronology using multiple mineral-isotopic chronometers reveals the thermo-tectonic history of the central Tianshan (NW China) from emplacement to exhumation. Granites from the central Tianshan, which are associated with the southward subduction of the northern Tianshan Ocean, have been dated at 362-354 Ma using the LA-ICP-MS Zircon U-Pb method. A younger diorite sample (282 Â± 1 Ma, Zircon U-Pb method by LA-ICP-MS) from northern Tianshan formed during the final closure of the Northern Tianshan Ocean when the Junggar Block collided with the Yili-Central Tianshan Block. 40Ar/39Ar step-wise heating plateau dates (biotite Ar/Ar: 312-293 Ma; Plagioclase Ar/Ar: 270-229 Ma) from the Central Tianshan show rapid post-magmatic cooling during the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian followed by a more modest rate of cooling from the middle Permian to the middle Jurassic. The northern Tianshan diorite (biotite Ar/Ar: 240 Â± 1 Ma) also reveals a middle Jurassic cooling. Apatite (U-Th )/He dates from the central Tianshan samples range from ca. 130 Ma to ca. 116 Ma. The Apatite (U-Th )/He date for the northern Tianshan sample is ca. 27 Ma. Previous studies also reported Apatite (U-Th)/He ages of ca. 44 Ma-11 Ma in the Baluntai area of the southern Central Tianshan[1]. Two episodes of cooling are distinguished by thermal history modelling: (1) Mesozoic cooling occurred as the result of the exhumation and tectonic reactivation of the central Tianshan; and (2) The Tianshan orogenic belt has been rapidly exhumed since the Middle Cenozoic.

This novel capability permits a detailed interrogation of the time-temperature history of rocks containing apatite, zircon and other accessory phases by providing both (U-Th-Sm)/He and U-Pb ages (+trace element analysis) on single crystals. In situ laser microanalysis offers several advantages over conventional bulk crystal methods in terms of safety, cost, productivity and spatial resolution. We developed and integrated a suite of analytical instruments including a 193 nm ArF excimer laser system (RESOlution M-50A-LR), a quadrupole ICP-MS (Agilent 7700s), an Alphachron helium mass spectrometry system and swappable flow-through and ultra-high vacuum analytical chambers. The analytical protocols include the following steps: mounting/polishing in PFA Teflon using methods similar to those adopted for fission track etching; laser He extraction and analysis using a 2 s ablation at 5 Hz and 2-3 J/cm2fluence; He pit volume measurement using atomic force microscopy, and U-Th-Sm-Pb (plus optional trace element) analysis using traditional laser ablation methods. The major analytical challenges for apatite include the low U, Th and He contents relative to zircon and the elevated common Pb content. On the other hand, apatite typically has less extreme and less complex zoning of parent isotopes (primarily U and Th). A freeware application has been developed for determining (U-Th-Sm)/He ages from the raw analytical data and Iolite software was used for U-Pb age and trace element determination. In situ double-dating has successfully replicated conventional U-Pb and (U-Th)/He age variations in xenocrystic zircon from the diamondiferous Ellendale lamproite pipe, Western Australia and increased zircon analytical throughput by a factor of 50 over conventional methods\n\nMeasurements of rare isotopes of U and Th by MC-ICP-MS using a 1013 ohm resistor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPythoud, M.; Edwards, R. L.; Cheng, H.; Lu, Y.; Zhang, P.; Nissen, J.; Berry, A. E.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe have tested a 1013 ohm resistor on a Thermo-Scientific Neptune Plus, a multi-collector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS), for the measurement of rare isotopes of uranium (U) and thorium (Th). In nature, the isotopic disequilibrium among U-series nuclides provides the potential to date materials and time processes over the last 700,000 years. Using gravimetric standards and a Minnesota stalagmite, we demonstrate the reproducibility of Î´234U and 230Th dates with uncertainties at the 1-â° to sub-â° level (2Ï), with relatively small samples. Compared to traditional secondary electron multiplier (SEM) techniques, measurement times decrease from > 1 hour to < 5 min for U and from tens of min to < 2 min for Th, with comparable or better precision. The characteristics of the new amplifier design and typical instrumental conditions allow for 234U and 230Th sample loads as small as 1-2 pg, a reduction in sample size close to an order of magnitude over cup measurements with 1011 ohm resistors. The main sources of error include the amplifier noise, uncertainty in the characterization of the tailing effect, and in some cases, counting statistics. Importantly, our overall characterization suggests that this new method forms the basis for future and further improvements on instrumental precision.\n\nCoupling of Uranium and Thorium Series Isotope Systematics for Age Determination of Late Pleistocene Zircons using LA-ICP-MS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSakata, S.; Hirakawa, S.; Iwano, H.; Danhara, T.; Hirata, T.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nZircon U-Th-Pb dating method is one of the most important tools for estimating the duration of magmatism by means of coupling of uranium, actinium and thorium decay series. Using U-Pb dating method, its reliability is principally guaranteed by the concordance between 238U-206Pb and 235U-207Pb ages. In case of dating Quaternary zircons, however, the initial disequilibrium effect on 230Th and 231Pa should be considered. On the other hands, 232Th-208Pb dating method can be a simple but powerful approach for investigating the age of crystallization because of negligible influence from initial disequilibrium effect. We have developed a new correction model for accurate U-Pb dating of the young zircon samples by taking into consideration of initial disequilibrium and a U-Pb vs Th-Pb concordia diagram for reliable age calibration was successfully established. Hence, the U-Th-Pb dating method can be applied to various zircons ranging from Hadean (4,600 Ma) to Quaternary (~50 ka) ages, and this suggests that further detailed information concerning the thermal history of the geological sequences can be made by the coupling of U-Th-Pb, fission track and Ar-Ar ages. In this presentation, we will show an example of U-Th-Pb dating for zircon samples from Sambe Volcano (3 to 100 ka), southwest Japan and the present dating technique using LA-ICP-MS.\n\nProspects for Practical Laser Ablation U/Pb and (U-Th)/He Double-Dating (LADD) of Detrital Apatite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHorne, A.; Hodges, K. V.; Van Soest, M. C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nA laser ablation micro-analytical technique for (U-Th)/He dating has been shown to be an effective approach to the thermochronologic study of detrital zircons (Tripathy-Lang et al., J. Geophys. Res., 2013), while Evans et al. (J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2015) and Horne et al. (Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 2016) demonstrated how the technique could be modified to enable laser ablation U/Pb and (U-Th)/He double-dating (LADD) of detrital zircon and titanite. These successes beg the question of whether or not LADD is viable for another commonly encountered detrital mineral: apatite. Exploratory LADD studies in Arizona State University's Group 18 Laboratories - using Durango fluorapatite, apatite from the Fish Canyon tuff, and detrital apatite from modern fluvial sediments in the eastern Sierra Nevada of California - illustrate that the method is indeed viable for detrital apatite. However, the method may not be appropriate for all detrital samples. For example, many apatite grains encountered in detrital samples from young orogenic settings have low concentrations of U and Th and small crystal sizes. This can lead to imprecise laser ablation (U-Th)/He dates, especially for very young grains potentially obscuring or inhibiting relevant interpretations of the data set.\n\nTwo modes of orogenic collapse of the Pamir plateau recorded by titanite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStearns, M. A.; Hacker, B. R.; Ratschbacher, L.; Rutte, D.; Kylander-Clark, A. R.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nProcesses that operate in the mid- to lower crust during and following continent-continent collision are important for understanding how orogenic plateaux transition from thickening to collapse. In the central and southern Pamir, mid- to lower crustal rocks crop out in two belts of extensional domes. The central Pamir domes were exhumed by symmetrical N-S extension. In contrast, the southern Pamir domes were exhumed by asymmetrical top to the south (NNW-SSE) extension via a rolling-hinge detachment. To investigate the high-temperature exhumation history, titanites were dated using LASS (laser ablation split stream-ICP-MS). A multi-collector ICP was used to collect U-Pb isotopic ratios and a single collector ICP-MS was used to measure trace-element abundances. The data indicate that the central Pamir domes began exhumation synchronously at ~17 Ma. Titanite from the southern Pamir record two periods of protracted (re)crystallization: older metamorphic dates ranging from ~35-18 Ma and younger igneous and metamorphic dates from ~15-7 Ma. Samples with single populations of titanite dates are present throughout both groups. Samples with more-complex date populations typically have distinct trace-element (e.g., Sr, Y, Zr, and Nb) groups that can be used to distinguish different date populations (e.g., older dates may have higher Zr and younger dates lower Zr). The distinct early exhumation histories of the north and south Pamir require either a diachronous single process or two semi-independent processes. The N to S sequence of exhumation, ranges of dates, and overall extension directions may be related to two important plate-tectonic events inferred from seismic data: 1) breakoff of the northward subducting Indian slab around ~20 Ma, and 2) southward subduction and northwestward rollback of the Asian lithosphere between ~15-10 Ma based on geodetic convergence rates and Benioff zone length. We interpret these two lithospheric-detachment events to have driven the\n\nBioaccessibility of U, Th and Pb in particulate matter from an abandoned uranium mine\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMillward, Geoffrey; Foulkes, Michael; Henderson, Sam; Blake, William\n\n2016-04-01\n\nCurrently, there are approximately 150 uranium mines in Europe at various stages of either operation, development, decommissioning, restoration or abandonment (wise-uranium.com). The particulate matter comprising the mounds of waste rock and mill tailings poses a risk to human health through the inadvertent ingestion of particles contaminated with uranium and thorium, and their decay products, which exposes recipients to the dual toxicity of heavy elements and their radioactive emissions. We investigated the bioaccessibility of 238U, 232Th and 206,214,210Pb in particulate samples taken from a contaminated, abandoned uranium mine in South West England. Sampling included a mine shaft, dressing floor and waste heap, as well as soils from a field used for grazing. The contaminants were extracted using the in-vitro Unified Bioaccessibility Research Group of Europe Method (UBM) in order to mimic the digestion processes in the human stomach (STOM) and the combined stomach and gastrointestinal tract (STOM+INT). Analyses of concentrations of U, Th and Pb in the extracts were by ICP-MS and the activity concentrations of radionuclides were determined on the same particles, before and after extraction, using gamma spectroscopy. 'Total' concentrations of U, Th and Pb for all samples were in the range 57 to 16,200, 0.28 to 3.8 and 69 to 4750 mg kg-1, respectively. For U and Pb the concentrations in the STOM fraction were lower than the total and STOM+INT fractions were even lower. However, for Th the STOM+INT fractions were higher than the STOM due to the presence of Th carbonate species within the gastrointestinal fluid. Activity concentrations for 214Pb and 210Pb, including total, STOM and STOM+INT, were in the range 180 to <1 Bq g-1 for the dressing floor and waste heap and 18 to <1 Bq g-1 for the grazing land. Estimates of the bioaccessible fractions (BAFs) of 238U in the most contaminated samples were 39% and 8% in the STOM and STOM+INT, respectively, whereas the respective\n\nParent zonation in thermochronometers - resolving complexity revealed by ID-TIMS U-Pb dates and implications for the application of decay-based thermochronometers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNavin Paul, Andre; Spikings, Richard; Chew, David; Daly, J. Stephen; Ulyanov, Alexey\n\n2017-04-01\n\nHigh temperature (>350â) U-Pb thermochronometers primarily use accessory minerals such as apatite, titanite and rutile, and assume that daughter isotopes are lost by thermally activated volume diffusion while the parent remains immobile. Studies exploiting such behaviour have been successfully used to reconstruct thermal histories spanning several hundred million years (e.g. Cochrane et al., 2014). However, outliers in date (ID-TIMS) vs diffusion length space are frequently observed, and grains are frequently found to be either too young or too old for expected thermal history solutions using the diffusion data of Cherniak et al. (2010). These deviations of single grain apatite U-Pb dates from expected behaviour could be caused by a combination of i) metamorphic (over-)growth, ii) fluid-aided Pb mobilisation during alteration/recrystallization, iii) parent isotope zonation, iv) metamictisation, and v) changes in diffusion length with time (e.g. fracturing). We present a large data set from the northern Andes of South America, where we compare apatite U-Pb ID-TIMS-(TEA) data with LA-ICP-MS element maps and in-situ apatite U-Pb LA-(MC)-ICP-MS dates. These are combined with U-Pb zircon and 40Ar/39Ar (muscovite) data to attempt to distinguish between thermally activated volume diffusion and secondary overgrowth/recrystallization. We demonstrate that in young (e.g. Phanerozoic) apatites that have not recrystallized or experienced metasomatic overgrowths, U-Pb dates are dominantly controlled by volume diffusion and intra-crystal uranium zonation. This implies that ID-TIMS analyses of apatites with zoned parent isotope distributions will not usually recover accurate thermal history solutions, and an in-situ dating method is required. Recovering the uranium distribution during in-situ analysis provides a means to account for parent zonation, substantially increasing the accuracy of the modelled t-T-paths. We present in-situ data from apatites where scatter in date v\n\nRadiation damage-He diffusivity models applied to deep-time thermochronology: Zircon and titanite (U-Th)/He datasets from cratonic settings\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuenthner, W.; DeLucia, M. S.; Marshak, S.; Reiners, P. W.; Drake, H.; Thomson, S.; Ault, A. K.; Tillberg, M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAdvances in understanding the effects of radiation damage on He diffusion in uranium-bearing accessory minerals have shown the utility of damage-diffusivity models for interpreting datasets from geologic settings with long-term, low-temperature thermal histories. Craton interiors preserve a billion-year record of long-term, long-wavelength vertical motions of the lithosphere. Prior thermochronologic work in these settings has focused on radiation damage models used in conjunction with apatite (U-Th)/He dates to constrain Phanerozoic thermal histories. Owing to the more complex damage-diffusivity relationship in zircon, the zircon (U-Th)/He system yields both higher and, in some cases, lower temperature sensitivities than the apatite system, and this greater range in turn allows researchers to access deeper time (i.e., Proterozoic) segments of craton time-temperature histories. Here, we show two examples of this approach by focusing on zircon (U-Th)/He datasets from 1.8 Ga granitoids of the Fennoscandian Shield in southeastern Sweden, and 1.4 Ga granites and rhyolites of the Ozark Plateau in southeastern Missouri. In the Ozark dataset, the zircon (U-Th)/He data, combined with a damage-diffusivity model, predict negative correlations between date and effective uranium (eU) concentration (a measurement proportional to radiation damage) from thermal histories that include an episode of Proterozoic cooling (interpreted as exhumation) following reheating (interpreted as burial) to temperature of 260Â°C at 850-680 Ma. In the Fennoscandian Shield, a similar damage model-based approach yields time-temperature constraints with burial to 217Â°C between 944 Ma and 851 Ma, followed by exhumation from 850 to 500 Ma, and burial to 154Â°C between 366 Ma and 224 Ma. Our Fennoscandian Shield samples also include titanite (U-Th)/He dates that span a wide range (945-160 Ma) and are negatively correlated with eU concentration, analogous to our zircon He dataset. These results support\n\nIn situ U-Th-Pb ages of the Miaoya carbonatite complex in the South Qinling orogenic belt, central China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYing, Yuancan; Chen, Wei; Lu, Jue; Jiang, Shao-Yong; Yang, Yueheng\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe Miaoya carbonatite complex in the South Qinling orogenic belt hosts one of the largest rare earth element (REE)-Nb deposits in China that is composed of carbonatite and syenite. The emplacement age of the complex and the geochronological relationship between the carbonatite and syenite have long been debated. In this study, in situ U-Th-Pb ages have been obtained for the constituent minerals zircon, monazite and columbite from carbonatite and syenite of the Miaoya complex, together with their chemical and isotopic compositions. In situ trace element compositions for zircon from carbonatite and syenite are highly variable. The zircon displays slightly heavy REE (HREE)-enriched chondrite-normalized patterns with no Eu anomaly and various light REE (LREE) contents. In situ Th-Pb dating for zircon from the Miaoya complex by laser ablation ICP-MS yields ages of 442.6 Â± 4.0 Ma (n = 53) for syenite and 426.5 Â± 8.0 Ma (n = 23) for carbonatite. Monazite from carbonatite and syenite shows similar chondrite-normalized REE patterns and yields a consistent Th-Pb age of 240 Ma. Based on petrographic and chemical composition, columbite from the carbonatite can be identified into two groups. The columbite dispersed within carbonatite is characterized by slightly LREE-enriched chondrite-normalized REE patterns, whereas columbite associated with apatite is characterized by LREE-depleted trends. Columbite has been further determined to have a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 232.8 Â± 4.5 Ma (n = 9) using LA-ICP-MS. Detailed geochronological and chemical investigations suggest that there were two major episodes of magmatic/metasomatic activities in the formational history of the Miaoya carbonatite complex. The early alkaline magmatism emplaced in the Silurian was related to the opening of the Mianlue Ocean, whereas the late metasomatism or hydrothermal overprint occurred during the Triassic South Qinling orogeny. The latter serves as the major ore formation period for both REE (e\n\nU-Th-Pb and Rb-Sr systematics of Allende and U-Th-Pb systematics of Orgueil\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nTatsumoto, M.; Unruh, D.M.; Desborough, G.A.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nU-Th-Pb systematics study of Allende inclusions showed that U, Th and Sr concentrations in Ca, Al (pyroxene)-rich chondrules and white and pinkish-white aggregate separates of Allende are five to ten times higher than those of the matrix, whereas Mg (olivine)-rich chondrules have U and Th concentrations about twice as high as the matrix. Th concentrations are extremely high in white aggregates and in pinkish-white (spinel-rich) aggregates while U and Sr concentrations in white aggregates are more than twice as high as those in pinkish-white aggregates. Large enrichment of these refractory elements in the white aggregates indicates that they contain high-temperature condensates from the solar nebula. The Pb concentrations in the inclusions are less than half of those in the whole rock and matrix, indicating that the matrix is a lower-temperature condensate. The isotopic composition of lead in the matrix is less radiogenic than that of the whole meteorite, whereas lead in Ca- and Al-rich chondrules and aggregates is extremely radiogenic. The 206Pb/204Pb ratio reaches as high as 55.9 in a white aggregate separate. The lead of Mg-rich chondrules is moderately radiogenic and the 206Pb/204Pb ratio ranges from 18 to 26. A striking linear relationship exists among leads in the chondrules, aggregates and matrix on the 207Pb/204Pb vs 204Pb/204Pb plot. The slope of the best fit line is 0.6188 ?? 0.0016, yielding an isochron age of 4553 ?? 4 m.y. The regression line passes through primordial lead values obtained from Canyon Diablo troilite. The data, when corrected for Canyon Diablo troilite Pb and plotted on a U-Pb concordia diagram, show that the pink and white aggregates and the Ca-Al-rich and Mg-rich inclusions have excess Pb and define a chord which intersects the concordia curve at 4548 ?? 25 m.y. and 107 ?? 70 m.y. The intercepts might correspond to the agglomeration age of the meteorite and a time of probably later disturbance, respectively.

P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe present chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionization (CA-ID-TIMS) U-Pb zircon geochronology and solution multicollector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) Hf isotopic data from a proposed natural zircon reference material for use during in situ analyses of U-Pb and Hf isotopic ratios. The sample, GHR1, was collected from the rapakivi intrusive phase of the Eocene Golden Horn batholith in Washington, USA. Zircons separated from this sample range up to 250-300 Î¼m in length and have moderate aspect ratios. A weighted mean of 15 Th-corrected 206Pb/238U zircon dates from GHR1 produced at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is 48.132 Â± 0.023 Ma (2Ï analytical and tracer uncertainties only, MSWD=1.70) confirming that there is little or no inter-crystal age heterogeneity at the scale of a few 10 kyr. Solution MC-ICP-MS measurements of chemically purified aliquots give a 176Hf/177Hf weighted mean of 0.283050 Â± 17 (2Ï, n=10), corresponding to a ÉHf0 of ca. +9.3. The 2Ï variability of these measurements is comparable to our reproducibility of the JMC-475 Hf isotopic standard 0.282160 Â± 14 (n= 13), suggesting that GHR1 zircons are homogenous with respect to 176Hf/177Hf. In situ 206Pb/238U dates from collaborating secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP), and laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) laboratories are in excellent agreement with the CA-ID-TIMS date and illustrate the reproducibility and potential value of this reference zircon. The mean values of 176Hf/177Hf measurements from two LA-ICP-MS laboratories are in agreement with the solution MC-ICP-MS value, but show slightly greater dispersion and higher (Lu+Yb)/Hf values. We attribute this discrepancy to apatite inclusions that are high in REE and may lead to greater isobaric interferences on 176Hf. These inclusions and potential isobaric interferences from REE were removed during the chemical abrasion step prior to bulk\n\nIn situ Pb-Pb dating of rutile from slowly cooled granulites by LA-MC-ICP-MS: confirmation of the high closure temperature (>=600Â°C) for Pb diffusion in rutile\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVry, J.; Baker, J.; Waight, T.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nWe have analysed Pb isotopes in natural rutile crystals by laser ablation MC-ICP-MS to assess the potential of rapid Pb-Pb dating of rutile with this method. The rutile samples are from granulite-facies Mg- and Al-rich rocks from the Reynolds Range, Northern Territory, Australia. This metamorphic terrane has a well-constrained high-T cooling history (ca. 3^oC/Myr) defined by previous U-Pb dating of monazite and zircon (peak metamorphism at 1584 Ma), which we have supplemented with additional Rb-Sr dates of phlogopite, biotite and muscovite. The dated rutiles vary in size from 3 to 0.05 mm, have Pb concentrations of ca. 20 ppm, and were analysed with a 266 nm laser coupled to an AXIOM MC-ICP-MS (spot size of 200-50 Î¼m). Individual larger crystals (>= 200 Î¼m) exhibit sufficient Pb isotopic heterogeneity (206Pb/204Pb = 10000-80000) to perform isochron calculations on several short analyses of a single grain (30-60 s). The largest rutiles yielded Pb-Pb isochron ages of 1540-1555 Ma with typical uncertainties of Â± 1 to 10 Ma. 207Pb/206Pb ages are typically within 1% of the Pb-Pb isochron ages testifying to the radiogenic nature of Pb in the rutile. A mean age for all the analysed rutiles was 1548.4 Â± 9.1 Ma (n = 33). Comparable 207Pb/206Pb ages were also obtained from individual smaller crystals (50 Î¼m) where the 204Pb ion beam could not be measured precisely. The results demonstrate that even small rutile crystals are extremely resistant to isotopic resetting, and that this mineral is a high-T chronometer. Phlogopite and muscovite Rb-Sr ages are <1454 and 1400-1480 Ma, respectively, with some of the phlogopite and biotite micas having been partially reset by later thermal events younger than 400 Ma. All the mica ages are considerably younger (100-70 My) than the rutile ages, which approach U-Pb ages for monazite and zircon overgrowths, even though the mica closure temperatures (350-500^oC) are comparable or slightly higher than earlier geological estimates [1] of\n\nComparative tissue distribution of metals in birds in Sweden using ICP-MS and laser ablation ICP-MS.\n\nPubMed\n\nEk, Kristine H; Morrison, Gregory M; Lindberg, Peter; Rauch, SÃ©bastien\n\n2004-08-01\n\nCadmium, copper, lead, palladium, platinum, rhodium, and zinc profiles were investigated along feather shafts of raptor and other bird species by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The distribution of external versus internal metal contamination of feathers was investigated. The species examined were peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), sparrowhawk ( Accipiter nisus), willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus), and house sparrow (Passer domesticus) in Sweden. For habitat comparisons, total Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd concentrations were analyzed by ICP-MS in feathers of the examined species as well as captive peregrine falcon. For investigation of metal distribution and correlation in different biological materials of raptors, total concentrations of Cu, Pb, Cd, and Zn were also investigated by ICP-MS in feathers, eggs, blood, feces, liver, and kidney of wild peregrine falcon from southwestern Sweden. Laser ablation of feathers revealed that Pb contamination is both external and internal, Zn contamination is internal, and Cd and Cu contamination is predominantly internal, with a few externally attached particles of high concentration. Pb, Cu, and Cd signal intensities were highest in urban habitats and contamination was mainly external in feathers. The background signal intensity of Zn was also higher in birds from urban habitats. The laser ablation profile of PGE (Pt, Pd, Rh) demonstrated that PGE contamination of feathers consists almost exclusively of externally attached PGE-containing particles, with little evidence of internally deposited PGE.Generally, total metal concentrations in feathers were highest in sparrowhawk and house sparrow due to their urban habitat. Total Cu, Zn, and Cd concentrations were highest in liver and kidney due to binding to metallothionein, while the total Pb concentration was highest in feces due to the high excretion rate of Pb.

The U-Pb system relies on secular equilibrium decay of 238U to 206Pb and 235U to 207Pb over longer timescales, and can be used to date samples from <1 Ma to 4.5 Ga. Disequilibrium plays a role in young U-Pb dates, but only as a nuisance correction. Both chronometers can produce dates with uncertainties <0.1% near the center of their applicable age ranges, but become less precise at their intersection, when the 238U decay chain approaches secular equilibrium and there has been little time for ingrowth of radiogenic Pb. However, if measurements or assumptions about both chronometers can be made, then they can be combined into a single, more informed date. Coupling the datasets can improve their precision and accuracy and help interrogate the assumptions that underpin each. Working with this data is difficult for two reasons. The Bateman equations are long and cumbersome for U decay chains that include 238U, 234U, 230Th, 226Ra, 206Pb and 235U, 231Pa, and 207Pb. Also, Pb measurements often comprise varying amounts of radiogenic Pb from locally heterogeneous U concentrations mixed with varying amounts of common Pb. At present there is no established, flexible computational framework to combine information from measurements and/or assumptions of these parameters, and no way to visualize and interpret the results. We present new algorithms to quickly and accurately solve the system of differential equations defined by both of the uranium decay chains and the linear regression through the U-Pb isochron. The results are illustrated on a new concordia diagram, where the concordia curve is determined by measured and/or assumed U-series disequilibrium and can have unfamiliar topologies.

Subsequent deformation of the supracrustal sequences produced isoclinal folding and culminated in metamorphism ranging from lower greenschist to amphibolite facies and anatexis related to the intrusion of syn- to late-tectonic plutons, four phases of which have ages of 2678 +4/-2 Ma, 2677 +/- 2 Ma, 2677 +/- 3 Ma, andmoreÂ Â» 2676 +/- 2 Ma. Two post-tectonic granitoid plutons in the center of the belt were intruded 2674 +/- 3 Ma and 2673 +/- 5 Ma ago and were followed by the emplacement of a composite mafic to felsic intrusion; a monzonite and a hornblendite from this intrusion yield identical ages of 2668 +/- 2 Ma. Titanite ages are identical or younger than the ages of coexisting zircons and reflect regional metamorphism and post-tectonic plutonism, but in a few cases they are younger and may record increased fluid activity along faults and the intrusion of mafic dikes. U-Pb zircon systematics, together with age and lithological relationships, suggests that the greenstone belt formed in an oceanic environment from material derived initially mainly from the mantle. Subsequent melting at the base of the thickening volcanic succession produced intermediate to felsic volcanic rocks, tonalites, and later granodioritic to granitic plutons leading to the final consolidation of the granite-greenstone terrain. 47 references.Â«Â less\n\nAnalysis and comparison of glass fragments by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and ICP-MS.\n\nPubMed\n\nTrejos, Tatiana; Montero, Shirly; Almirall, JosÃ© R\n\n2003-08-01\n\nThe discrimination potential of Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is compared with previously reported solution ICP-MS methods using external calibration (EC) with internal standardization and a newly reported solution isotope dilution (ID) method for the analysis of two different glass populations. A total of 91 different glass samples were used for the comparison study; refractive index and elemental composition were measured by the techniques mentioned above. One set consisted of 45 headlamps taken from a variety of automobiles that represents a range of 20 years of manufacturing dates. A second set consisted of 46 automotive glasses (side windows, rear windows, and windshields) representing casework glass from different vehicle manufacturers over several years. The element menu for the LA-ICP-MS and EC-ICP-MS methods include Mg, Al, Ca, Mn, Ce, Ti, Zr, Sb, Ga, Ba, Rb, Sm, Sr, Hf, La, and Pb. The ID method was limited to the analysis of two isotopes each of Mg, Sr, Zr, Sb, Ba, Sm, Hf, and Pb. Laser ablation analyses were performed with a Q switched Nd:YAG, 266 nm, 6 mJ output energy laser. The laser was used in depth profile mode while sampling using a 50 microm spot size for 50 sec at 10 Hz (500 shots). The typical bias for the analysis of NIST 612 by LA-ICP-MS was less than 5% in all cases and typically better than 5% for most isotopes. The precision for the vast majority of the element menu was determined generally less than 10% for all the methods when NIST 612 was measured (40 microg x g(-1)). Method detection limits (MDL) for the EC and LA-ICP-MS methods were similar and generally reported as less than 1 microg x g(-1) for the analysis of NIST 612. While the solution sample introduction methods using EC and ID presented excellent sensitivity and precision, these methods have the disadvantages of destroying the sample, and also involve complex sample preparation. The laser ablation method was simpler, faster, and\n\nNorth Qinling Terrain as a provenance of Kuanping Group: LA-ICP-MS U-Pb Geochronology of detrital zircons\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHu, B.; Li, S.; Zhai, M.; Wu, J.; Jia, X.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThough some Neoproterozoic S-type granites in the North Qinling Terrain (NQT), China indicate the collision between the NQT and an unknown block, there are still controversial. The LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of detrital zircons of meta-sandstones from the Kuanping Group in Luonan area, NQT, provide sedimentology evidence to prove that the NQT and an unknown block from Rodinia supercontinent have been collided during Meso-Neoproterozoic. The U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the Kuanping Group show that the main age peaks are at 2.58 Ga, 2.46 Ga, 2.0 Ga, 1.78 Ga, 1.6 Ga, 1.45 Ga and 1.27 Ga. The youngest age of 880 Ma indicates that the sedimentary age of the Kuanping Group is less than 880 Ma. The provenances, which provide 1.45 - 0.88 Ga sediments may come from NQT, which magmatic and metamorphic rocks during this period outcropped. Whereas provenances providing 2.6- 1.6 Ga sediments may come from an unknown block. This indicates that the Kuangping Group received both NQT and the unknown block materials. Therefore, the NQT and the unknown block may have collided before 880 Ma. 889 - 848 Ma A-type granites distributing the NQT was considered forming under a post-collisional tectonics. According the youngest detrital zircon ages of 880 Ma, it is inferred that the Kuanping Basin may also form in the same tectonic environments. Neoproterozoic Kuanping basin and 889 - 848 Ma A-type granites may be a result which NQT broken off a block of Rodinia supercontinent.

Laser ablation ICPMS stands out due to these reasons, especially for the U-Th-Pb isotopic dating. Matrix-matched external standardization is by far the most common approach used in U-Th-Pb dating via LA-ICPMS. However, matrix-effects between standard and sample for in-situ dating have shown to be both significant and insignificant. It remains mysterious whether a well matrix-matched standard is needed for U-Th-Pb dating by LA-ICPMS. This study provides an experimental framework for the understanding of matrix effects induced elemental fractionation for U-Th-Pb associated with ICPMS. A preliminary study on the influence of varied U, Th and Pb amounts on their fractionations has been carried out. Experimental data show that different U, Th and Pb contents result in varied 238U/206Pb and 232Th/208Pb ratios. The fractionations of U/Pb and Th/Pb increase with the increasing contents (1 ppb to 100 ppb) with a strong positive anomaly at 10 ppb. Matrixes representing minerals frequently used in dating have been investigated for the influences on U/Pb and Th/Pb fractionations, which suggest a complicated effect. Little fractionations observed between mineral pairs (e.g., monazite and apatite; zircon and perovskite; rutile and perovskite; xenotime and baddeleyite), whereas large fractionations identified for other minerals (e.g., zircon and baddeleyite; monazite and sphene; rutile and baddeleyite). Single element matrix (i.e., Si, P, Ca, Zr, Ti) has been studied to identify their effects on the fractionations. U/Pb ratio increases with the increasing Si and P contents, whereas it decreases for Zr, Ca and Ti. Th/Pb ratio increases with increasing Si contents, decreases for P and Zr, and increases first then decreases for Ca and Ti. Above all, different matrix and U, Th and Pb amounts show distinct U/Pb and Th/Pb fractionations within ICPMS.
