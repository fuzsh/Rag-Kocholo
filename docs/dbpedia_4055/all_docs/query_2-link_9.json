        "text": "S-N profile of Receive function image across Qiangtang, Northern Tibet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHe, R.; Gao, R.; Deng, G.; Li, W.; Hou, H.; Lu, Z.; Xiong, X.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nHuge thicken Triassic and Jurassic sediments widely outcorp within Qiangtang, tens of oilstones outcorped within Qiangtang showed that Qiangtang have a good advantage in exploring oil and gas. So, the basement beneath Qiangtang and its structures have become the key for us to look for oil and gas accumulations. Within tectonic settings of Qiangtang, the center uplift of Qiangtang (abbr. CUQT) and its developments have become the great barrier to understand the basement and its structures within the basin. Because of complicated structure relief and blueschist and ophiolite outcorps within the CUQT, there was the paradox for lots of geologist to understand how the CUQT developed. One was that it formed under the extension environment. On the contrary, CUQT was ever paleo-Tethys suture zone, because CUQT had the belt of blueschists and ophiolite. So, different opinions to CUQT resulted in the different viewpoints in the basin beneath Qiangtang terrane. Surveying deep structure beneath the CUQT was the key to understand the basement under Qiangtang. In past two years, we have deployed 40 portable broadband seismic stations along E88Â°to across the whole Qiangtang from Bangong-Nujiang Suture, southern side of Qiangtang terrane, to northern margin of Qiangtang terrane. The temporary network collected a lot of farm waveform data, which is helpful to know about the more finest deep structure beneath the CUQT and its two sides basin. We used P-to-S receiver functions methods to get deep structure image beneath the profile. The preliminary results showed: (1) Within the crust, the velocity structure beneath southern Qiangtang basin is higher than beneath northern Qiangtang basin. (2) Sedimental layer within southern Qiangtang basin is thichen than within northern Qiangtang basin. Combined with other geophysical information, CUQT is an important lithosphere-level boundary fault belts, and southern Qiangtang basin have great difference with northern Qiangtang basin, in\n\nAssembly of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in central Tibet by divergent double subduction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhu, Di-Cheng; Li, Shi-Min; Cawood, Peter A.; Wang, Qing; Zhao, Zhi-Dan; Liu, Sheng-Ao; Wang, Li-Quan\n\n2016-02-01\n\nIntegration of lithostratigraphic, magmatic, and metamorphic data from the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision zone in central Tibet (including the Bangong suture zone and adjacent regions of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes) indicates assembly through divergent double sided subduction. This collision zone is characterized by the absence of Early Cretaceous high-grade metamorphic rocks and the presence of extensive magmatism with enhanced mantle contributions at ca. 120-110 Ma. Two Jurassic-Cretaceous magmatic arcs are identified from the Caima-Duobuza-Rongma-Kangqiong-Amdo magmatic belt in the western Qiangtang Terrane and from the Along Tso-Yanhu-Daguo-Baingoin-Daru Tso magmatic belt in the northern Lhasa Terrane. These two magmatic arcs reflect northward and southward subduction of the Bangong Ocean lithosphere, respectively. Available multidisciplinary data reconcile that the Bangong Ocean may have closed during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (most likely ca. 140-130 Ma) through arc-arc \"soft\" collision rather than continent-continent \"hard\" collision. Subduction zone retreat associated with convergence beneath the Lhasa Terrane may have driven its rifting and separation from the northern margin of Gondwana leading to its accretion within Asia.\n\nAn early bird from Gondwana: Paleomagnetism of Lower Permian lavas from northern Qiangtang (Tibet) and the geography of the Paleo-Tethys\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSong, Peiping; Ding, Lin; Li, Zhenyu; Lippert, Peter C.; Yue, Yahui\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe origin of the northern Qiangtang block and its Late Paleozoic-Early Mesozoic drift history remain controversial, largely because paleomagnetic constraints from pre-Mesozoic units are sparse and of poor quality. In this paper, we provide a robust and well-dated paleomagnetic pole from the Lower Permian Kaixinling Group lavas on the northern Qiangtang block. This pole suggests that the northern Qiangtang block had a paleolatitude of 21.9 Â± 4.7 Â°S at ca. 296.9 Â± 1.9 Ma. These are the first volcanic-based paleomagnetic results from pre-Mesozoic rocks of the Qiangtang block that appear to average secular variation accurately enough to yield a well-determined paleolatitude estimate. This new pole corroborates the hypothesis, first noted on the basis of less rigorous paleomagnetic data, the presence of diamictites, detrital zircon provenance records, and faunal assemblages, that the northern Qiangtang block rifted away from Gondwana prior to the Permian. Previous studies have documented that the northern Qiangtang block accreted to the Tarim-North China continent by Norian time. We calculate a total northward drift of ca. 7000 km over ca. 100 myr, which corresponds to an average south-north plate velocities of â¼7.0 cm/yr. Our results do not support the conclusion that northern Qiangtang has a Laurasian affinity, nor that the central Qiangtang metamorphic belt is an in situ Paleo-Tethys suture. Our analysis, however, does not preclude paleogeographies that interpret the central Qiangtang metamorphic belt as an intra-Qiangtang suture that developed at southernly latitudes outboard of the Gondwanan margin. We emphasize that rigorous paleomagnetic data from Carboniferous units of northern Qiangtang and especially upper Paleozoic units from southern Qiangtang can test and further refine these paleogeographic interpretations.\n\nLate Triassic granitic rocks of the Central Qiangtang Orogenic Belt, northern Tibet: tracing crustal thickening through post-collisional silicic magmatism\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, H.; Chen, J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Central Qiangtang Orogenic Belt (CQOB) was formed through Triassic continental collision between the Southern and Northern Qiangtang terranes. Numerous granitic intrusions occur along the CQOB, forming a Late Triassic granitic belt that stretches 1000 km from west to east. This Central Qiangtang granitic belt was believed to constitute most of the CQOB. Therefore, the CQOB thus provides a typical composite orogen for the study of relationships between granitoid magmatism and orogenic processes. Recently, many studies have been carried out, and the close relationship of the magmatic belt with the evolutionary history of the CQOB is well established. Late Triassic intrusive rocks are widely exposed in the Riwanchaka area of Central Qiangtang, northern Tibet. In this study, new U-Pb zircon ages reveal that Late Triassic magmatism in Riwanchaka took place at ca 225-205 Ma, coeval with exhumation of the metamorphic rocks in Central Qiangtang. Our new and previously published data enable us to correlate the subduction-related volcanic arc rocks in the Riwanchaka area to a post-collisional extension setting related to slab break-off during northward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean seafloor. Geochemical characteristics suggested that the samples from CQOB can be divided into low-Sr/Y granitoids (LSG) and high-Sr/Y granitoids (HSG). The LSG are normal calc-alkaline I-type granitoids, characterized by varying major and trace element contents indicative of partial melting of ancient mafic lower crust. The HSG are characterized by high Sr/Y ratios and (La/Yb)N (chondrite-normalized) ratios. These signatures indicate that the HSG were derived by partial melting of garnet-bearing thickened lower crust. The crustal structure and evolution of the CQOB are considered on the basis of available data and variations in Sr/Y, La/Yb, and Hf isotopic ratios. Temporal geochemical and Hf isotopic changes, diagnostic of crustal thickening, indicate that the CQOB was greatly\n\nPaleomagnetic Constraints From the Baoshan Area on the Deformation of the Qiangtang-Sibumasu Terrane Around the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Shihu; van Hinsbergen, Douwe J. J.; Deng, Chenglong; Advokaat, Eldert L.; Zhu, Rixiang\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe Sibumasu Block in SE Asia represents the eastward continuation of the Qiangtang Block. Here we report a detailed rock magnetic and paleomagnetic study on the Middle Jurassic and Paleocene rocks from northern Sibumasu, to document the crustal deformation during the India-Asia collision since the Paleocene and reconstruct the overall strike of the Qiangtang/Sibumasu elements before the India-Asia collision. Although the fold test is inconclusive based solely on our data, a positive reversal test, a positive regional fold test with previous paleomagnetic results, and a detrital origin of hematite in the red beds as indicated by scanning electron microscopy suggest that the magnetizations obtained from the Jurassic and Paleocene rocks are most likely primary, showing an 80Â° clockwise rotation since Paleocene. These results, together with previously published paleomagnetic data, suggest that the northern Sibumasu and northern Simao elements experienced a 60-80Â° clockwise rotation since Paleocene. This large clockwise rotation is also consistent with the surface GPS velocity field and NE-SW fault networks, suggesting a rotational motion of crustal material from southeastern Tibet during late Cenozoic. We infer that the large clockwise rotation is a sum of rotation in the Eocene to Middle Miocene time associated with Indochina extrusion and rotation after the Middle Miocene associated with the E-W extension in central Tibet. This suggests that the eastward motion of Tibetan crustal material along the Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault after Middle Miocene is transmitted to the southwest toward Myanmar. Jurassic and Cretaceous paleomagnetic results suggest that the Qiangtang/northern Sibumasu was originally a curved structure with an orientation of N60Â°W in Tibet and changes to N10Â°W in southern Sibumasu.\n\nMagmatic record of Late Devonian arc-continent collision in the northern Qiangtang, Tibet: Implications for the early evolution of East Paleo-Tethys Ocean\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDan, Wei; Wang, Qiang; Zhang, Xiu-Zheng; Zhang, Chunfu; Tang, Gong-Jian; Wang, Jun; Ou, Quan; Hao, Lu-Lu; Qi, Yue\n\n2018-05-01\n\nRecognizing the early-developed intra-oceanic arc is important in revealing the early evolution of East Paleo-Tethys Ocean. In this study, new SIMS zircon U-Pb dating, O-Hf isotopes, and whole-rock geochemical data are reported for the newly-discovered Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous arc in Qiangtang, central Tibet. New dating results reveal that the eastern Riwanchaka volcanic rocks were formed at 370-365 Ma and were intruded by the 360 Ma Gangma Co alkali feldspar granites. The volcanic rocks consist of basalts, andesites, dacites, and rhyodacites, whose geochemistry is similar to that typical of subduction-related volcanism. The basalts and andesites were generated by partial melting of the fluid and sediment-melt metasomatized mantle, respectively. The rhyodacites and dacites were probably derived from the fractional crystallization of andesites and from partial melting of the juvenile underplated mafic rocks, respectively. The Gangma Co alkali feldspar granites are A-type granites, and were possibly derived by partial melting of juvenile underplated mafic rocks in a post-collisional setting. The 370-365 Ma volcanic arc was characterized by basalts with oceanic arc-like Ce/Yb ratios and by rhyodacites with mantle-like or slightly higher zircon Î´18O values, and it was associated with the contemporary ophiolites. Thus, we propose that it is the earliest intra-oceanic arc in the East Paleo-Tethys Ocean, and was accreted to the Northern Qiangtang Terrane during 365-360 Ma.\n\nOrigin and tectonic evolution of early Paleozoic arc terranes abutting the northern margin of North China Craton\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, Hao; Pei, Fu-Ping; Zhang, Ying; Zhou, Zhong-Biao; Xu, Wen-Liang; Wang, Zhi-Wei; Cao, Hua-Hua; Yang, Chuan\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe origin and tectonic evolution of the early Paleozoic arc terranes abutting the northern margin of the North China Craton (NCC) are widely debated. This paper presents detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data of early Paleozoic strata in the Zhangjiatun arc terrane of central Jilin Province, northeast (NE) China, and compares them with the Bainaimiao and Jiangyu arc terranes abutting the northern margin of the NCC. Detrital zircons from early Paleozoic strata in three arc terranes exhibit comparable age groupings of 539-430, 1250-577, and 2800-1600 Ma. The Paleoproterozoic to Neoarchean ages and Hf isotopic composition of the detrital zircons imply the existence of the Precambrian fragments beneath the arc terranes. Given the evidences from geology, igneous rocks, and detrital zircons, we proposed that the early Paleozoic arc terranes abutting the northern margin of the NCC are a united arc terrane including the exotic Precambrian fragments, and these fragments shared a common evolutionary history from Neoproterozoic to early-middle Paleozoic.\n\nSiberia, the wandering northern terrane, and its changing geography through the Palaeozoic\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCocks, L. Robin M.; Torsvik, Trond H.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nThe old terrane of Siberia occupied a very substantial area in the centre of today's political Siberia and also adjacent areas of Mongolia, eastern Kazakhstan, and northwestern China. Siberia's location within the Early Neoproterozoic Rodinia Superterrane is contentious (since few if any reliable palaeomagnetic data exist between about 1.0 Ga and 540 Ma), but Siberia probably became independent during the breakup of Rodinia soon after 800 Ma and continued to be so until very near the end of the Palaeozoic, when it became an integral part of the Pangea Supercontinent. The boundaries of the cratonic core of the Siberian Terrane (including the Patom area) are briefly described, together with summaries of some of the geologically complex surrounding areas, and it is concluded that all of the Palaeozoic underlying the West Siberian Basin (including the Ob-Saisan Surgut area), Tomsk Terrane, Altai-Sayan Terranes (including Salair, Kuznetsk Alatau, Batenov, Kobdin and West Sayan), Ertix Terrane, Barguzin Terrane, Tuva-Mongol Terrane, Central Mongolia Terrane Assemblage, Gobi Altai and Mandalovoo Terranes, Okhotsk Terrane and much of the Verkhoyansk-Kolyma region all formed parts of peri-Siberia, and thus rotated with the main Siberian Craton as those areas were progressively accreted to the main Siberian Terrane at various times during the latest Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic. The Ertix Terrane is a new term combining what has been termed the \"Altay Terrane\" or \"NE Xinjiang\" area of China, and the Baytag, Baaran and Bidz terranes of Mongolia. The Silurian Tuvaella brachiopod fauna is restricted only to today's southern parts of peri-Siberia. Thus, allowing for subsequent rotation, the fauna occurs only in the N of the Siberian Terrane, and, as well as being a helpful indicator of what marginal terranes made up peri-Siberia, is distinctive as being the only Silurian fauna known from northern higher latitudes globally. In contrast, the other terranes adjacent to peri\n\nThe nature of Archean terrane boundaries: an example from the northern Wyoming Province\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMogk, D.W.; Mueller, P.A.; Wooden, J.L.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe Archean northern Wyoming Province can be subdivided into two geologically distinct terranes, the Beartooth-Bighorn magmatic terrane (BBMT) and the Montana metasedimentary terrane (MMT). The BBMT is characterized by voluminous Late Archean (2.90-2.74 Ga) magmatic rocks (primarily tonalite, trondhjemite, and granite); metasedimentary rocks are preserved only as small, rare enclaves in this magmatic terrane. The magmatic rocks typically have geochemical and isotopic signatures that suggest petrogenesis in a continental magmatic arc environment. The MMT, as exposed in the northern Gallatin and Madison Ranges, is dominated by Middle Archean trondhjemitic gneisses (3.2-3.0 Ga); metasedimentary rocks, however, are significantly more abundant than in the BBMT. Each terrane has experienced a separate and distinct geologic history since at least 3.6 Ga ago based on differences in metamorphic and structural styles, composition of magmatic and metasupracrustal rocks, and isotopic ages; consequently, these may be described as discrete terranes in the Cordilleran sense. Nonetheless, highly radiogenic and distinctive Pb-Pb isotopic signatures in rocks of all ages in both terranes indicate that the two terranes share a significant aspect of their history. This suggests that these two Early to Middle Archean crustal blocks, that initially evolved as part of a larger crustal province, experienced different geologic histories from at least 3.6 Ga until their juxtaposition in the Late Archean (between 2.75 to 2.55 Ga ago). Consequently, the boundary between the BBMT and MMT appears to separate terranes that are not likely to be exotic in the sense of their Phanerozoic counterparts. Other Archean provinces do appear to contain crustal blocks with different isotopic signatures (e.g. West Greenland, India, South Africa). The use of the term exotic, therefore, must be cautious in situations where geographic indicators such as paleontologic and/or paleomagnetic data are not available\n\nDetrital Zircon Signature of Proterozoic Metasedimentary Rocks of the Pearya Terrane, Northern Ellesmere Island: Implications for Terrane Stratigraphy and Circum-Arctic Terrane Correlations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMalone, S. J.; McClelland, W.\n\n2012-12-01\n\n, Svalbard, and the Caledonides of Norway and Greenland. In addition, the Succession II dataset provides a Neoproterozoic background for terranes originating in the northern Caledonides. Similar detrital zircon age peaks appear in Paleozoic sediments of AAC and the Alexander Terrane. The Pearya Terrane represents a critical link between the Arctic Caledonides and terranes translated into the Panthalassic realm during the Paleozoic.\n\nLate Triassic paleolatitude of the Qiangtang block: Implications for the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSong, Peiping; Ding, Lin; Li, Zhenyu; Lippert, Peter C.; Yang, Tianshui; Zhao, Xixi; Fu, Jiajun; Yue, Yahui\n\n2015-08-01\n\nTo better constrain the Late Triassic paleolatitude of the Qiangtang block and the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a combined paleomagnetic and zircon U/Pb geochronological study has been conducted on the Upper Triassic Jiapila Formation volcanic rocks on the northern edge of the Qiangtang block of Central Tibet (34.1Â°N, 92.4Â°E). These rocks are dated to 204-213 Ma. Progressive thermal or alternating field demagnetization successfully isolated stable characteristic remanent magnetizations (ChRM) that pass both the fold and reversal tests, consistent with a primary magnetization. These are the first volcanic-based paleomagnetic results from pre-Cretaceous rocks of the Qiangtang block that appear to average secular variation well enough to yield a reliable paleolatitude estimate. Based on our new paleomagnetic data from Upper Triassic lavas, we conclude that the Late Triassic pole of the Qiangtang block was located at 64.0Â°N, 174.7Â°E, with A95 = 6.6 Â° (N = 29). We compile published paleomagnetic data from the Qiangtang block to calculate a Late Triassic latitude for the Qiangtang block at 31.7 Â± 3.0Â°N. The central Paleo-Tethys Ocean basin was located between the North China (NCB) and Tarim blocks to the north and the Qiangtang block to the south during Late Paleozoic-Early Mesozoic. A comparison of published Early Triassic paleopole from the Qiangtang block with the coeval paleopoles from the NCB and Tarim indicates that the Paleo-Tethys Ocean could not have closed during the Early Triassic and that its width was approximately â¼32-38Â° latitude (â¼3500-4200 km). However, the comparison of our new combined Late Triassic paleomagnetic result with the Late Triassic poles of the NCB and Tarim, as well as numerous geological observations, indicates that the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean at the longitude of the Qiangtang block most likely occurred during the Late Triassic.\n\nLow palaeoelevation of the northern Lhasa terrane during late Eocene: Fossil foraminifera and stable isotope evidence from the Gerze Basin.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Yi; Zhang, Kexin; Garzione, Carmala N; Xu, Yadong; Song, Bowen; Ji, Junliang\n\n2016-06-08\n\nThe Lhasa terrane is a key region for understanding the paleoelevation of the southern Tibetan Plateau after India-Asia collision. The Gerze Basin, located in the northern part of the Lhasa terrane, is a shortening-related basin. We discovered Lagena laevis (Bandy) fossils in upper Eocene strata of the Gerze Basin. This type of foraminifera is associated with lagoon and estuarine environments, indicating that the northern part of the Lhasa terrane was near sea level during the late Eocene. We speculate that these foraminifera were transported inland by storm surges to low elevation freshwater lakes during times of marine transgressions. This inference is consistent with the relatively positive Î´(18)O values in carbonate from the same deposits that indicate low palaeoelevations close to sea level. Considering the palaeoelevation results from the nearby Oligocene basins at a similar latitude and the volcanic history of the Lhasa terrane, we infer that large-magnitude surface uplift of the northern Lhasa terrane occurred between late Eocene and late Oligocene time.\n\nDetrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and provenance of the Carboniferous-Permian glaciomarine pebbly slates in the Tibetan Plateau\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Q.; Zhu, D.; Zhao, Z.; Chung, S.; Li, C.; Sui, Q.; Fu, X.; Mo, X.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nfrom different terranes of the Tibetan Plateau. Such difference may have been associated primarily with the different paleogeographical positions of the Lhasa Terrane that was adjacent to northern Australia and of the Qiangtang and Tethyan Himalaya terranes that were situated in the northern margin of the Indian continent, respectively.

Along the ANTILOPE -1 profile, a rapidly northward dipping Moho extends from Ë50 km below the Himalaya to Ë80 km across the Indus-Yarlung suture (IYS), shallowing to Ë66 km under the central Lhasa terrane. The Moho depth shows a dramatic increase from Ë66 km north of the Bangong-Nujiang suture (BNS) to Ë93 km beneath central Qiangtang terrane where it reaches the maximum depth observed along this profile before steeply rising to Ë73 km. We interpret both the 15 km and 20 km offsets of Moho depth occurring beneath the central Lhasa and central Qiangtang terranes as being related to the northern frontiers of the decoupled underthrusting Indian lower crust and lithospheric mantle, respectively. The Moho remains at a depth of Ë70 km with a slight undulation beneath the northern Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganzi terranes, and then abruptly shallows to Ë45 km near the Altyn Tagh Fault. The Ë25 km Moho offset observed at the conjunction of the Tarim Basin and the Altyn Tagh mountain range suggests that the crustal shortening is achieved by pure shear thickening without much underthrusting. The average crustal Vp/Vs ratio changes from 1.66 to 1.80 beneath the Himalaya, the Lhasa terrane and the Tarim Basin indicating a felsic-to-intermediate composition. However, higher Vp/Vs ratios between 1.76 and 1.83 (except for a few outlying low values) are found beneath the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganzi terranes, which could be attributed to the joint effects of the more mafic composition and partial melt within the crust. The Moho depth and Vp/Vs ratio exhibit complex N-S variations along this profile, which can be attributed to the joint effects of Indian lower crust underthrusting, the low velocity zone of the mid-upper crust, crustal shortening and thickening and other involved dynamic mechanisms.\n\nLow palaeoelevation of the northern Lhasa terrane during late Eocene: Fossil foraminifera and stable isotope evidence from the Gerze Basin\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWei, Yi; Zhang, Kexin; Garzione, Carmala N.; Xu, Yadong; Song, Bowen; Ji, Junliang\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Lhasa terrane is a key region for understanding the paleoelevation of the southern Tibetan Plateau after India-Asia collision.

The Jurassic succession includes Toarcian-Aalenian shallow-marine limestones (Quse Formation), Aalenian-Bajocian feldspatho-litho-quartzose to feldspatho-quartzo-lithic sandstones (shallow-marine Sewa Formation and deep-sea Gaaco Formation), and Bathonian outer platform to shoal limestones (Buqu Formation). This succession is truncated by an angular unconformity, overlain by upper Bathonian to lower Callovian fan-delta conglomerates and litho-quartzose to quartzo-lithic sandstones (Biluoco Formation) and Callovian shoal to outer platform limestones (Suowa Formation). Sandstone petrography coupled with detrital-zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope analysis indicate that the Sewa and Gaaco formations contain intermediate to felsic volcanic detritus and youngest detrital zircons (183-170 Ma) with ÉHf(t) ranging widely from +13 to -25, pointing to continental-arc provenance from igneous rocks with mixed mantle and continental-crust contributions. An arc-trench system thus developed toward the end of the Early Jurassic, with the southern Qiangtang basin representing the fore-arc basin. Above the angular unconformity, the Biluoco Formation documents a change to dominant sedimentary detritus including old detrital zircons (mainly >500 Ma ages in the lower part of the unit) with age spectra similar to those from Paleozoic strata in the central Qiangtang area. A major tectonic event with intense folding and thrusting thus took place in late Bathonian time (166 Â± 1 Ma), when the Qiangtang block collided with another microcontinental block possibly the Lhasa block.\n\nCretaceous-Eocene provenance connections between the Palawan Continental Terrane and the northern South China Sea margin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShao, Lei; Cao, Licheng; Qiao, Peijun; Zhang, Xiangtao; Li, Qianyu; van Hinsbergen, Douwe J. J.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe plate kinematic history of the South China Sea opening is key to reconstructing how the Mesozoic configuration of Panthalassa and Tethyan subduction systems evolved into today's complex Southeast Asian tectonic collage. The South China Sea is currently flanked by the Palawan Continental Terrane in the south and South China in the north and the two blocks have long been assumed to be conjugate margins. However, the paleogeographic history of the Palawan Continental Terrane remains an issue of uncertainty and controversy, especially regarding the questions of where and when it was separated from South China. Here we employ detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and heavy mineral analysis on Cretaceous and Eocene strata from the northern South China Sea and Palawan to constrain the Late Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic provenance and paleogeographic evolution of the region testing possible connection between the Palawan Continental Terrane and the northern South China Sea margin. In addition to a revision of the regional stratigraphic framework using the youngest zircon U-Pb ages, these analyses show that while the Upper Cretaceous strata from the Palawan Continental Terrane are characterized by a dominance of zircon with crystallization ages clustering around the Cretaceous, the Eocene strata feature a large range of zircon ages and a new mineral group of rutile, anatase, and monazite. On the one hand, this change of sediment compositions seems to exclude the possibility of a latest Cretaceous drift of the Palawan Continental Terrane in response to the Proto-South China Sea opening as previously inferred. On the other hand, the zircon age signatures of the Cretaceous-Eocene strata from the Palawan Continental Terrane are largely comparable to those of contemporary samples from the northeastern South China Sea region, suggesting a possible conjugate relationship between the Palawan Continental Terrane and the eastern Pearl River Mouth Basin. Thus, the Palawan Continental\n\nTerranes and the tectonic assembly of South America: The fifth Circum-Pacific terrane conference\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoore, G.

Particular interest centered on the Precordillera Terrane, which came from central North America and was accreted to Argentina during the Ordovician, and on the Avalon Terrane, derived from northern South American and accreted to Laurasia during the Taconic Orogeny. The mobility of plates and terranes has been so great that before the Mesozoic the Circum-Pacific and Circum-Atlantic regions were one and the same.\n\nNewly discovered Late Triassic Baqing eclogite in central Tibet indicates an anticlockwise West-East Qiangtang collision.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Yu-Xiu; Jin, Xin; Zhang, Kai-Jun; Sun, Wei-Dong; Liu, Jian-Ming; Zhou, Xiao-Yao; Yan, Li-Long\n\n2018-01-17\n\nThe Triassic eclogite-bearing central Qiangtang metamorphic belt (CQMB) in the northern Tibetan Plateau has been debated whether it is a metamorphic core complex underthrust from the Jinsha Paleo-Tethys or an in-situ Shuanghu suture. The CQMB is thus a key issue to elucidate the crustal architecture of the northern Tibetan Plateau, the tectonics of the eastern Tethys, and the petrogenesis of Cenozoic high-K magmatism. We here report the newly discovered Baqing eclogite along the eastern extension of the CQMB near the Baqing town, central Tibet. These eclogites are characterized by the garnetâ+âomphaciteâ+ârutileâ+âphengiteâ+âquartz assemblages. Primary eclogite-facies metamorphic pressure-temperature estimates yield consistent minimum pressure of 25âÂ±â1âkbar at 730âÂ±â60âÂ°C. U-Pb dating on zircons that contain inclusions (garnetâ+âomphaciteâ+ârutileâ+âphengite) gave eclogite-facies metamorphic ages of 223âMa. The geochemical continental crustal signature and the presence of Paleozoic cores in the zircons indicate that the Baqing eclogite formed by continental subduction and marks an eastward-younging anticlockwise West-East Qiangtang collision along the Shuanghu suture from the Middle to Late Triassic.\n\nPaleozoic subduction complex and Paleozoic-Mesozoic island-arc volcano-plutonic assemblages in the northern Sierra terrane\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHanson, Richard E.; Girty, Gary H.; Harwood, David S.; Schweickert, Richard A.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThis field trip provides an overview of the stratigraphic and structural evolution of the northern Sierra terrane, which forms a significant part of the wall rocks on the western side of the later Mesozoic Sierra Nevada batholith in California. The terrane consists of a pre-Late Devonian subduction complex (Shoo Fly Complex) overlain by submarine arc-related deposits that record the evolution of three separate island-arc systems in the Late Sevonian-Early Mississippian, Permian, and Late Triassic-Jurassic. The two Paleozoic are packages and the underlying Shoo Fly Complex have an important bearing on plate-tectonic processes affecting the convergent margin outboard of the Paleozoic Cordilleran miogeocline, although their original paleogeographic relations to North America are controversial. The third arc package represents an overlap assemblage that ties the terrane to North America by the Late Triassic and helps constrain the nature and timing of Mesozoic orogenesis. Several of the field-trip stops examine the record of pre-Late Devonian subduction contained in the Shoo Fly Complex, as well as the paleovolcanology of the overlying Devonian to Jurassic arc rocks. Excellent glaciated exposures provide the opportunity to study a cross section through a tilted Devonian volcano-plutonic association. Additional stops focus on plutonic rocks emplaced during the Middle Jurassic arc magmatism in the terrane, and during the main pulse of Cretaceous magmatism in the Sierra Nevada batholith to the east.\n\nInterpretation of gravity profiles across the northern Oaxaca terrane, its boundaries and the TehuacÃ¡n Valley, southern Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCampos-EnrÃ­quez, J. O.; Alatorre-Zamora, M. A.; Keppie, J. D.; Belmonte-JimÃ©nez, S. I.; RamÃ³n-MÃ¡rquez, V. M.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nA gravity study was conducted across the northern Oaxaca terrane and its bounding faults: the Caltepec and Oaxaca Faults to the west and east, respectively. These faults juxtapose the Oaxaca terrane against the Mixteca and Juarez terranes, respectively. The Oaxaca Fault also forms the eastern boundary of the Cenozoic TehuacÃ¡n depression. On the west, at depth, the TehuacÃ¡n valley is limited by the normal buried TehuacÃ¡n Fault. This gravity study reveals that the Oaxaca Fault system gives rise to a series of east tilted basamental blocks (Oaxaca Complex). The tectonic depression is filled with Phanerozoic rocks and has a deeper depocenter to the west. The gravity data also indicate that on the west, the Oaxaca Complex, the Caltepec and Santa Lucia faults continue northwestwards beneath Phanerozoic rocks. A major E-W to NE-SW discontinuity is inferred to exist between profiles 1 and 2.\n\nPaleomagnetic contributions to the Klamath Mountains terrane puzzle-a new piece from the Ironside Mountain batholith, northern California\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMankinen, Edward A.; Gromme, C. Sherman; Irwin, W. Porter\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe obtained paleomagnetic samples from six sites within the Middle Jurassic Ironside Mountain batholith (~170 Ma), which constitutes the structurally lowest part of the Western Hayfork terrane, in the Klamath Mountains province of northern California and southern Oregon. Structural attitudes measured in the coeval Hayfork Bally Meta-andesite were used to correct paleomagnetic data from the batholith. Comparing the corrected paleomagnetic pole with a 170-Ma reference pole for North America indicates 73.5Â° Â± 10.6Â° of clockwise rotation relative to the craton. Nearly one-half of this rotation may have occurred before the terrane accreted to the composite Klamath province at ~168 Ma. No latitudinal displacement of the batholith was detected.\n\nOrigin of narrow terranes and adjacent major terranes occurring along the denali fault in the eastern and central alaska range, alaska\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nNokleberg, W.J.; Richter, D.H.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nSeveral narrow terranes occur along the Denali fault in the Eastern and Central Alaska Range in Southern Alaska. These terranes are the Aurora Peak, Cottonwood Creek, Maclaren, Pingston, and Windy terranes, and a terrane of ultramafic and associated rocks. Exterior to the narrow terranes to the south is the majorWrangellia island arc composite terrane, and to the north is the major Yukon Tanana metamorphosed continental margin terrane. Overlying mainly the northern margin of the Wrangellia composite terrane are the Kahiltna overlap assemblage to the west, and the Gravina- Nutzotin-Gambier volcanic-plutonic- sedimentary belt to the east and southeast. The various narrow terranes are interpreted as the result of translation of fragments of larger terranes during two major tectonic events: (1) Late Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous accretion of the Wrangellia island arc composite terrane (or superterrane composed of the Wrangellia, Peninsular, and Alexander terranes) and associated subduction zone complexes; and (2) starting in about the Late Cretaceous, dextral transport of the Wrangellia composite terrane along the Denali fault. These two major tectonic events caused: (1) entrapment of a lens of oceanic lithosphere along the suture belt between the Wrangellia composite terrane and the North American Craton Margin and outboard accreted terranes to form the ultramafic and mafic part of the terrane of ultramafic and associated rocks, (2) subsequent dextral translation along the Denali fault of the terrane of ultramafic and associated rocks, (3) dextral translation along the Denali fault of the Aurora Peak, Cottonwood Creek, and Maclaren and continental margin arc terranes from part of the Coast plutonic-metamorphic complex (Coast-North Cascade plutonic belt) in the southwest Yukon Territory or Southeastern Alaska, (4) dextral translation along the Denali fault of the Pingston passive continental margin from a locus along the North American Continental Margin, and (5\n\nProvenance of the exotic Northern Sierra terrane (North American Cordillera) based on U-Pb detrital zircon data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPowerman, V.; Girty, G.; Hanson, R. E.; Grove, M.; Miller, E. L.; Hourigan, J. K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAges of detrital zircons from the Northern Sierra terrane (NST) suggest an exotic provenance with respect to NW Laurentia. We have acquired U-Pb LA-ICPMS dz ages from 16 samples collected from the uppermost NST allochthon, the Sierra City mÃ©lange, and 1 sample from the lower Culbertson Lake allochthon. Age distributions can be divided into 3 partly intersecting groups: (a) 6 mÃ©lange samples and the 1 Culbertson Lake allochthon sample are dominated by >1 Ga grains; (b)5 samples are characterized by the additional presence of Early Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic grains (520-640;680-800;840-1000Ma); (c) 9 samples, 8 feldspathic, 1âqtz-rich, can be also characterized by the presence of 360-520Ma grains. These results strengthen the non Laurentian nature of detrital sources:(1)most of the detrital age distributions possess ages in the 1.49-1.61Ga interval, the \"N.American magmatic gap\";(2) Ediacaran zircons cannot be linked to any igneous event within West Laurentia. Most samples possess detrital age distributions that include the 1.0-2.0 Ga peak, characteristic of Baltica rather than Laurentia. These data, supplemented by SHRIMP-RG data (353-368Ma) from stitching igneous units suggest the following model: parts of NST were located at the NE margin of Baltica in the early Paleozoic, receiving \"Baltica\" (1.0-2.0 Ga) and \"Timanide\"(Late Vendian â Early Cambrian) zircons. This crustal block was later rifted away from Baltica and by mid-Paleozoic was juxtaposed with allochthons of presumably NW Laurentia provenance. The assembled terrane was involved in a subduction zone, resulting in the emplacement of 353-368Ma igneous rocks. The U-Pb detrital zircon age distributions presented here are similar to signatures of strata in along strike exotic terranes of the North American Cordillera (such as the Yreka terrane of the Klamath Mts., the Alexander terrane of S.Alaska and the Arctic Chukotka-Alaska terrane) by having Timanian, Baltica, and Caledonian signatures. Hence, it\n\nThree-dimensional velocity structure of Siletzia and other accreted terranes in the Cascadia forearc of Washington\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nParsons, T.; Wells, R.E.; Fisher, M.A.; Flueh, E.; ten Brink, Uri S.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nEocene mafic crust with high seismic velocities underlies much of the Oregon and Washington forearc and acts as a backstop for accretion of marine sedimentary rocks from the obliquely subducting Juan de Fuca slab. Arc-parallel migration of relatively strong blocks of this terrane, known as Siletzia, focuses upper crustal deformation along block boundaries, which are potential sources of earthquakes. In a three-dimensional velocity model of coastal Washington, we have combined surface geology, well data, and travel times from earthquakes and controlled source seismic experiments to resolve the major boundaries of the Siletz terrane with the adjacent accreted sedimentary prism and volcanic arc. In southern Washington and northern Oregon the Siletz terrane appears to be a thick block (???20 km) that extends west of the coastline and makes a high-angle contact with the offshore accreted sedimentary prism. On its east flank the high-velocity Siletz terrane boundary coincides with an en echelon zone of seismicity in the arc. In northern Washington the western edge of Siletzia makes a lower-angled, fault-bound contact with the accretionary prism. In addition, alternating, east-west trending uplifts and downwarps of the Siletz terrane centered on the antiformal Olympic Mountains may reflect focusing of north-south compression in the northern part of the Siletz terrane. This compressional strain may result from northward transport and clockwise rotation of the Siletz terrane into the relatively fixed Canadian Coast Mountains restraining bend along the coast.\n\na Possible Ancient Core Complex in the Northern Cache Creek Terrane, British Columbia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZagorevski, A.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Cache Creek terrane (CCT) in Canadian Cordillera comprises a belt of Mississippian to Jurassic oceanic rocks that include Tethyan carbonates and alkaline basalts that are demonstrably exotic to Laurentia. The exotic Tethyan faunas in the CCT, combined with its inboard position with respect to Stikinia and Yukon-Tanana terranes has led to a variety of tectonic hypotheses including oroclinal enclosure of CCT by Stikinia, Yukon-Tanana and Quesnellia during the Jurassic. Detailed studies have demonstrated that the northern CCT is in fact a composite terrane that includes ophiolitic rocks of both ocean island and island arc origins. The western margin of the CCT is characterized by imbricated harzburgite, island arc tholeiite, sedimentary rocks and locally significant felsic volcanic rocks of the Kutcho arc. Gabbro is volumetrically minor and sheeted dyke complexes are either very rare or not developed. The felsic arc volcanic rocks and the pyroxenite bodies that cut the harzburgite have been previously isotopically dated as Middle Triassic (ca. 245 Ma) suggesting that melt percolation through the mantle was coeval with Kutcho arc magmatism and coincided with a magmatic gap in Stikinia. In general the contact between the mantle and supracrustal rocks is faulted making it difficult to determine the original relationships between the mantle and island arc tholeiites. Locally, the contact appears to be intact and is characterized by mantle tectonites with pyroxenite veins overlain by cumulate plagioclase-orthopyroxene gabbro and fine grained diabase. Elsewhere, volcanic and sedimentary rocks sit in fault contact structurally above the mantle. The absence of voluminous gabbro and sheeted dyke complexes, presence of coeval magmas in the crust and mantle, and low angle extensional faulting in some areas suggests that the western part of the CCT may preserve an ocean core complex similar to the Godzilla Megamullion in the Parece-Vela Basin. Such a hypothesis suggests that\n\nLow crustal velocities and mantle lithospheric variations in southern Tibet from regional Pnl waveforms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRodgers, Arthur J.; Schwartz, Susan Y.\n\nWe report low average crustal P-wave velocities (5.9-6.1 km/s, Poisson's ratio 0.23-0.27, thickness 68-76 km) in southern Tibet from modelling regional Pnl waveforms recorded by the 1991-1992 Tibetan Plateau Experiment. We also find that the mantle lithosphere beneath the Indus-Tsangpo Suture and the Lhasa Terrane is shield-like (Pn velocity 8.20-8.25 km/s, lid thickness 80-140 km, positive velocity gradient 0.0015-0.0025 s-1). Analysis of relative Pn travel time residuals requires a decrease in the mantle velocities beneath the northern Lhasa Terrane, the Banggong-Nujiang Suture and the southern Qiangtang Terrane. Tectonic and petrologic considerations suggest that low bulk crustal velocities could result from a thick (50-60 km) felsic upper crust with vertically limited and laterally pervasive partial melt. These results are consistent with underthrusting of Indian Shield lithosphere beneath the Tibetan Plateau to at least the central Lhasa Terrane.\n\nIntraplate deformation on north-dipping basement structures in the Northern Gawler Craton, Australia: reactivation of original terrane boundaries or later intra-cratonic thrusts?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaines, G.; Giles, D.; Betts, P. G.; BackÃ©, G.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nMultiple intraplate orogenic events have deformed Neoproterozoic to Carboniferous sedimentary sequences that cover the Archean to Mesoproterozoic basement of the northern Gawler Craton, Australia. These intraplate orogenies reactivated north-dipping basement penetrating faults that are imaged on seismic reflection profiles. These north-dipping structures pre-date Neoproterozoic deposition but their relationships to significant linear magnetic and gravity anomalies that delineate unexposed Archean to Early Mesoproterozoic basement terranes are unclear. The north-dipping structures are either terrane boundaries that formed during continental amalgamation or later faults, which formed during a mid- to late-Mesoproterozoic transpressional orogeny and cross-cut the original lithological terrane boundaries. We model magnetic and gravity data to determine the 3D structure of the unexposed basement of the northern Gawler Craton. These models are constrained by drill hole and surface observations, seismic reflection profiles and petrophysical data, such that geologically reasonable models that can satisfy the data are limited. The basement structures revealed by this modelling approach constrain the origin and significance of the north-dipping structures that were active during the later intraplate Petermann, Delamerian and Alice Springs Orogenies. These results have bearing on which structures are likely to be active during present-day intraplate deformation in other areas, including, for example, current seismic activity along similar basement structures in the Adelaide \"Geosyncline\".\n\nCircum-North Pacific tectonostratigraphic terrane map\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nNokleberg, Warren J.; Parfenov, Leonid M.; Monger, James W.H.; Baranov, Boris B.; Byalobzhesky, Stanislav G.; Bundtzen, Thomas K.; Feeney, Tracey D.; Fujita, Kazuya; Gordey, Steven P.; Grantz, Arthur; Khanchuk, Alexander I.; Natal'in, Boris A.; Natapov, Lev M.; Norton, Ian O.; Patton, William W.; Plafker, George; Scholl, David W.; Sokolov, Sergei D.; Sosunov, Gleb M.; Stone, David B.; Tabor, Rowland W.; Tsukanov, Nickolai V.; Vallier, Tracy L.; Wakita, Koji\n\n1994-01-01\n\nafter accretion of most terranes in the region; (2) Cenozoic and Mesozoic basinal deposits that occur within a terrane or on the craton; (3) plutonic rocks.

The 2D deep MT model of line 500 confirms previous observations concluding that the region is characterized to first-order by a resistive upper crust and a conductive, partially melted, middle to lower crust that extends from the Lhasa Terrane to the Qiangtang Terrane with varying depth. The same conductive structure setting, but in shallower depths is also present on the eastern 400 line. From deep electromagnetic sounding, supported by independent 1D integrated petro-physical investigation, we can estimate the next upper-mantle conductive layer at depths from 200 km to 250 km below the Lhasa Terrane and less resistive Tibetan lithosphere below the Qiangtang Terrane with conductive upper-mantle in depths about 120 km. The anisotropic 2D modeling reveals lower crustal anisotropy in Lhasa Terrane, which can interpreted as crustal channel flow. The 3D inversion models of all MT data from central Tibet show dominant 2D regional strike of mid and lower crustal structures equal N110E. This orientation is parallel to Shuanghu suture, BengCo Jiali strike-slip fault system and perpendicular to convergence direction. The lower crust conductor in central Lhasa Terrane can be interpreted more likely as 3D lower Indian crust structure, located to the east from line 500, than geoelectrical anisotropic crustal flow.\n\nThe Late Triassic bivalve Monotis in accreted terranes of Alaska\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSilberling, Norman J.; Grant-Mackie, J. A.; Nichols, K.M.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nLate Triassic bivalves of the genus Monotis occur in at least 16 of the lithotectonic terranes and subterranes that together comprise nearly all of Alaska, and they also occur in the Upper Yukon region of Alaska where Triassic strata are regarded as representing non-accretionary North America. On the basis of collections made thus far, 14 kinds of Monotis that differ at the species or subspecies level can be recognized from alaska. These are grouped into the subgenera Monotis (Monotis), M. (Pacimonotis), M. (Entomonotis), and M. (Eomonotis). In places, Monotis shells of one kind or another occur in rock-forming abundance. On the basis of superpositional data from Alaska, as well as from elsewhere in North America and Far Eastern Russia, at least four distince biostratigraphic levels can be discriminated utilizing Monotis species. Different species of M. (Eomonotis) characterize two middle Norian levels, both probably within the supper middle Norian Columbianus Ammonite Zone. Two additional levels are recognized in the lower upper Norian Cordilleranus Ammonite Zone utilizing species of M. (Monotis) or M. (Entomonotis), both of which subgenera are restricted to the late Norian. An attached-floating mode of life is commonly attributed to Monotis; thus, these bivalves would have been pseudoplanktonic surface dwellers that were sensitive to surface-water temperature and paleolatitude. Distinctly different kinds of Monotis occur at different paleolatitudes along the Pacific and Arctic margins of the North American craton inboard of the accreted terranes. Comparison between thse craton-bound Monotis faunas and those of the Alaskan terranes in southern Alaska south of the Denali fault were paleoequatorial in latitude during Late Triassic time. Among these terranes, the Alexander terrane was possibly in the southern hemisphere at that time. Terranes of northern Alaska, on the other hand, represent middle, possibly high-middle, northern paleolatitudes.\n\nRole of strike-slip faulting in the evolution of allochthonous terranes in the Philippines\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKarig, D.E.; Sarewitz, D.R.; Haeck, G.D.\n\n1986-10-01\n\nConcepts of allochthonous terrane transport and emplacement are dominated by the assumption that most terranes originate on the subducting plate, collide with the upper plate, and are emplaced there. Movement of terranes along the convergent margin is recognized but is generally attributed to postcollision slip. In the northern Philippines, allochthonous terranes originate primarily within the arc system, have been translated along it by strike-slip faults, and were emplaced by cessation of that slip. The authors suggest that in the Philippines some originally vertical strike-slip boundaries may have evolved into shallow-dipping sutures marked by fold and thrust systems. This mode ofmoreÂ Â» terrane evolution may be more common than generally appreciated, particularly in orogenic belts developed in response to oblique convergence.Â«Â less\n\nStepwise exhumation of the Triassic Lanling high-pressure metamorphic belt in Central Qiangtang, Tibet: Insights from a coupled study of metamorphism, deformation, and geochronology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiang, Xiao; Wang, Genhou; Yang, Bo; Ran, Hao; Zheng, Yilong; Du, Jinxue; Li, Lingui\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe E-W trending Central Qiangtang metamorphic belt (CQMB) is correlated to the Triassic orogeny of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean prior to Cenozoic growth of the Tibetan Plateau. The well-exposed Lanling high-pressure, low-temperature (HP-LT) metamorphic complex was chosen to decipher the process by which it was exhumed, which thereby provides insights into the origin of the CQMB and Qiangtang terrane. After a detailed petrological and structural mapping, three distinct N-S-trending metamorphic domains were distinguished. Microscopic observations show that core domain garnet (Grt)-bearing blueschist was exhumed in a heating plus depressurization trajectory after peak eclogitic conditions, which is more evident in syntectonic vein form porphyroblastic garnets with zoning typical of a prograde path. Grt-free blueschist of the mantle domain probably underwent an exhumation path of temperature increasing and dehydration, as evidenced by pervasive epidote veins. The compilation of radiometric results of high-pressure mineral separates in Lanling and Central Qiantang, and reassessments on the published phengite data sets of Lanling using Arrhenius plots allow a two-step exhumation model to be formulated. It is suggested that core domain eclogitic rocks were brought onto mantle domain blueschist facies level starting at 244-230 Ma, with exhumation continuing to 227-223.4 Ma, and subsequently were exhumed together starting at 223-220 Ma, reaching lower greenschist facies conditions generally after 222-217 Ma. These new observations indicate that the CQMB formed as a Triassic autochthonous accretionary complex resulting from the northward subdcution of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and that HP-LT rocks therein were very probably exhumed in an extensional regime.\n\nNd, Pb, Sr, and O isotopic characterization of Saudi Arabian Shield terranes\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nStoeser, D.B.; Frost, C.D.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nNew Nd, Sr and O isotopic data for granitoid rocks of the Saudi Arabian Shield are presented together with published Nd, Pb, Sr and O isotopic data and all available geologic and geochronologic information to re-evaluate the terranes defined for the Saudi Arabian part of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Three groups of terranes are identified: 1) the western arc terranes, 2) the eastern arc terranes, and 3) the Khida terrane. The Khida terrane is the only terrane composed of pre-Neoproterozoic continental crust. The western arc terranes are of oceanic arc affinity, and have the least radiogenic Pb and Sr and most radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions and some of the lowest ??18O values of any rocks of the Saudi Arabian Shield. Although some previous studies have characterized the eastern arc terranes as of continental affinity, this study shows that they too are composed of Neoproterozoic oceanic arcs, although their sources have slightly elevated 208Pb/204Pb, Nd, Sri, and ??18O values compared to the western arc terranes. These data suggest that either the isotopic composition of the mantle source for the western arc terranes is more depleted than that of the eastern arc terranes or the eastern arc terranes have been mixed with a small amount of cratonic source material, or both. We further elaborate on the Hulayfah-Ad Dafinah fault zone as a major boundary within the Saudi Arabian portion of the East African Orogen. With further study, its northern extension may be shown to pass through what has been defined as the Hail terrane, and its southern extension appears to lie under cover east of the Tathlith-Malahah terrane and extend into Yemen. It may represent the collision zone between East and West Gondwana, and at the very least it is an important suture between groups of arc terranes of contrasting isotopic composition caught between two converging continents.\n\nLate Paleozoic orogeny in Alaska's Farewell terrane\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBradley, D.C.; Dumoulin, Julie A.; Layer, P.; Sunderlin, D.; Roeske, S.; McClelland, B.; Harris, A.G.; Abbott, G.; Bundtzen, T.; Kusky, T.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nEvidence is presented for a previously unrecognized late Paleozoic orogeny in two parts of Alaska's Farewell terrane, an event that has not entered into published scenarios for the assembly of Alaska. The Farewell terrane was long regarded as a piece of the early Paleozoic passive margin of western Canada, but is now thought, instead, to have lain between the Siberian and Laurentian (North American) cratons during the early Paleozoic. Evidence for a late Paleozoic orogeny comes from two belts located 100-200 km apart. In the northern belt, metamorphic rocks dated at 284-285 Ma (three 40Ar/39Ar white-mica plateau ages) provide the main evidence for orogeny. The metamorphic rocks are interpreted as part of the hinterland of a late Paleozoic mountain belt, which we name the Browns Fork orogen. In the southern belt, thick accumulations of Pennsylvanian-Permian conglomerate and sandstone provide the main evidence for orogeny. These strata are interpreted as the eroded and deformed remnants of a late Paleozoic foreland basin, which we name the Dall Basin. We suggest that the Browns Fork orogen and Dall Basin comprise a matched pair formed during collision between the Farewell terrane and rocks to the west. The colliding object is largely buried beneath Late Cretaceous flysch to the west of the Farewell terrane, but may have included parts of the so-called Innoko terrane. The late Paleozoic convergent plate boundary represented by the Browns Fork orogen likely connected with other zones of plate convergence now located in Russia, elsewhere in Alaska, and in western Canada.

Z.; Dan, W.; Wang, Q.; Hao, L. L.; Qi, Y.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn today's oceans, they are rarely undergone subduction on one side and extension on the opposite side. In contrast, there are a few magmatisms in the passive continental margins in the Tethys Ocean. However, because of their long and complex evolution of the northern continental margin of the Gondwana, the geodynamics of the magmatism occurred in this area is speculative or highly depute. One of these examples is the geodynamics of the 360-350 Ma magmatism in southern Lhasa, Tibet. Many authors speculated that it was generated in back-arc setting. Our recent new high-resolution SIMS zircon U-Pb dating reveals that there is a subduction arc with ages of 370-350 Ma in the Qiangtang terrane. The arc rocks compose of andesites, plagiogranites, A-type granites and cumulated gabbros, indicating an initial subduction. This initial subduction arc is located on the north margin of the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean, and it was formed slightly earlier than the 360-350 Ma magmatism in southern Lhasa, located on the south margin of the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean. Combined with similar aged magmatism generating the back-arc basin in the Sanjiang area, the 360-350 Ma magmatism in southern Lhasa was proposed to be generated in a passive continental margin, and induced by the regional extensional setting related to the subduction in the north margin of the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean.\n\nAge and correlation of the Calera Limestone in the Permanente terrane of northern California\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSliter, William V.; McGann, Mary\n\n1992-01-01\n\nPlanktonic foraminifers indicate that outcrops of Calera Limestone from the Permanente terrane in the Franciscan Complex of northern California range in age from possibly as old as Barremian to late Turonian. Underlying black limestone, which is devoid of planktonic foraminifers, presumably is Barremian in age or older. The top of the sequence exposed in major quarries is always faulted. Improved biostratigraphic resolution shows two patterns of missing time intervals. The primary pattern, which is found at all localities and involves missing planktonic foraminiferal zones in the late Aptian to early Albian and the late Albian, is linked to paleoceanographic changes in the Cretaceous Pacific Ocean. The secondary pattern, which is found at the scattered outcrops outside the major quarries and involves missing zones in the Albian and Cenomanian, suggests the results of a common tectonic history related to the accretion of a large seamount.\n\nElectromagnetic, seismic and petro-physical investigations of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary in central Tibet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVozar, J.; Fullea, J.; Jones, A. G.; Agius, M. R.; Lebedev, S.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nCombined seismological and electromagnetic investigations of the lithosphere and underlying asthenosphere have the potential to yield superior inferences than using either one on its own. Central Tibet offers an excellent natural laboratory for testing such approaches, given the high quality seismological and magnetotelluric (MT) data available as a consequence of INDEPTH studies. In particular, the presence and lateral and vertical extent of the Indian lithosphere beneath Tibet is highly debated. Integrated petrological-geophysical modeling of MT and surface-wave data, which are differently sensitive to temperature and composition, allows us to reduce the uncertainties associated with modeling these two data sets independently, as commonly undertaken. For the MT data, we use selected distortion-corrected MT transfer functions, from INDEPTH Phase III line 500 across central Tibet for 1D modeling. The selected data fit well the 1D assumption and exhibit large penetration depth. Our deep resistivity models can be classified into two different groups: i) the Lhasa Terrane and ii) the Qiangtang Terrane. For the Lhasa Terrane group, the models show the existence of two high conductive layers localized at depths of 60-80 km and more than 200 km, whereas for the Qiangtang Terrane these conductive layers appears to be occur at shallower depths, namely 30-50 km and 120 km depth respectively. Our dispersion curves for Rayleigh and Love surface waves were measured using seismograms recorded by stations of INDEPTH and PASSCAL experiments. Dispersion curves for central Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes show similarly low phase velocities at periods sampling the thick crust beneath the regions, but differ at periods sampling the mantle. Inverting the dispersion data for 1D, radially-anisotropic Vs profiles, we find that beneath central Qiangtang terrane shear velocity is lower than the global average down to 75 km below the Moho, indicating relatively high temperatures, whereas\n\nMayer Kangri metamorphic complexes in Central Qiangtang (Tibet, western China): implications for the Triassic-early Jurassic tectonics associated with the Paleo-Tethys Ocean\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Yixuan; Liang, Xiao; Wang, Genhou; Yuan, Guoli; Bons, Paul D.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe Mesozoic orogeny in Central Qiangtang Metamorphic Belt, northern Tibet, provides important insights into the geological evolution of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. However, the Triassic-early Jurassic tectonics, particularly those associated with the continental collisionstage, remains poorly constrained. Here we present results from geological mapping, structural analysis, P-T data, and Ar-Ar geochronology of the Mayer Kangri metamorphic complex. Our data reveal an E-W-trending, 2 km wide dome-like structure associated with four successive tectonic events during the Middle Triassic and Early Jurassic. Field observations indicate that amphibolite and phengite schist complexes in this complex are separated from the overlying lower greenschist mÃ©lange by normal faulting with an evident dextral shearing component. Open antiform-like S2 foliation of the footwall phengite schist truncates the approximately north-dipping structures of the overlying mÃ©lange. Microtextures and mineral chemistry of amphibole reveal three stages of growth: Geothermobarometric estimates yield temperatures and pressures of 524 Â°C and 0.88 GPa for pargasite cores, 386 Â°C and 0.34 GPa for actinolite mantles, and 404 Â°C and 0.76 GPa for winchite rims. Peak blueschist metamorphism in the phengite schist occurred at 0.7-1.1 GPa and 400 Â°C. Our Ar-Ar dating of amphibole reveals rim-ward decreasing in age bands, including 242.4-241.2 Ma, â¥202.6-196.8, and 192.9-189.8 Ma. The results provide evidence for four distinct phases of Mesozoic tectonic evolution in Central Qiangtang: (1) northward oceanic subduction beneath North Qiangtang ( 244-220 Ma); (2) syn-collisional slab-break off (223-202 Ma); (3) early collisional extension driven by buoyant extrusion flow from depth ( 202.6-197 Ma); and (4) post-collision contraction and reburial (195.6-188.7 Ma).\n\nEarly Precambrian gneiss terranes and Pan-African island arcs in Yemen: Crustal accretion of the eastern Arabian Shield\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWindley, Brian F.; Whitehouse, Martin J.; Ba-Bttat, Mahfood A. O.\n\n1996-02-01\n\nWithin the Precambrian of Yemen, we have identified four gneiss terranes and two island-arc terranes on the basis of existing literature, mapping, and our own field observations, together with new Sm-Nd isotopic data. The two western gneiss terranes can be correlated with well-documented terranes (Asir and Afif) in Saudi Arabia. To the east of these, the Abas and Al-Mahfid gneiss terranes yield Sm-Nd model ages (tDM) of 1.7 2.3 Ga and 1.3 2.7 Ga, respectively, and cannot be correlated with any documented terranes in Saudi Arabia. These two terranes are separated by a Pan-African island-arc terrane that has been obducted onto one or both of the gneiss terranes, and a second arc bounds the Al-Mahfid gneiss terrane to the east. Our discovery of extensive Proterozoic to late Archean gneisses in Yemen provides important constraints upon the much-discussed tectonic framework of northeast Gondwana and the rate of Pan-African crustal growth. The terranes in Yemen may be correlated with comparable terranes on the eastern margin of the Arabian Shield and in northern Somalia. Thus Yemen provides a link between the arc collage of the Arabian Shield and the gneissic Mozambique belt of East Africa.\n\nMercury's Geochemical Terranes Revisited\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPeplowski, P.

The oceanic terranes are exposed in the westernmost Aleutians, but to the east, they are completely buried by isotopically distinct arc-volcanic rocks. Analogous oceanic terranes may be important components of the terrane collages that comprise the continents.\n\nContinuation, south of Oaxaca City (southern Mexico) of the Oaxaca-Juarez terrane boundary and of the Oaxaca Fault. Based in MT, gravity and magnetic studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCampos-Enriquez, J. O.; Corbo, F.; Arzate-Flores, J.; Belmonte-Jimenez, S.; Arango-GalvÃ¡n, C.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe Oaxaca Fault represents Tertiary extensional reactivation of the Juarez shear zone constituting the boundary-suture between the Oaxaca and Juarez terranes (southern Mexico). South of Oaxaca City, the fault trace disappears and there are not clear evidences for its southward continuation at depth. The crust in southern MÃ©xico has been studied through seismic refraction, and seismological and magnetotelluric (MT) studies. The refraction studies did not image the Oaxaca Fault. However, previous regional MT studies suggest that the Oaxaca-Juarez terrane boundary lies to the east of the Zaachila and Mitla sub-basins, which implies sinistral displacement along the Donaji Fault. Campos-Enriquez et al. (2009) established the shallow structure of the Oaxaca-Juarez terrane boundary based in detailed gravity and magnetic studies. This study enabled: 1) to establish the shallow structure of the composite depression comprising three N-S sub-basins: the northern Etla and southern Zaachila sub-basins separated by the Atzompa sub-basin. According to the Oaxaca-Juarez terrane boundary is displaced sinistrally ca. 20 km along the E-W DonajÃ­ Fault, which defines the northern boundary of the Zaachila sub-basin. At the same time,, the Oaxaca Fault may either continue unbroken southwards along the western margin of a horst in the Zaachila sub-basin or be offset along with the terrane boundary. This model implies that originally the suture was continuous south of the Donaji Fault. A constraint for the accreation of the Oaxaca and Juarez terranes. Thirty MT soundings were done in the area of the Central Valleys, Oaxaca City (southern Mexico). In particular we wanted to image the possible southward continuation of the Oaxaca Fault. 22 Mt sounding are located along two NE-SW profiles to the northern and to the south of the City of Oaxaca. To the north of Oaxaca City, the electrical resistivity distribution obtained show a clear discontinuity across the superficial trace of the Oaxaca\n\nTernary feldspar thermometry of Paleoproterozoic granulites from In-Ouzzal terrane (Western Hoggar, southern Algeria)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBenbatta, A.; Bendaoud, A.; Cenki-Tok, B.; Adjerid, Z.; LacÃ¨ne, K.; Ouzegane, K.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe In Ouzzal terrane in western Hoggar (Southern Algeria) preserves evidence of ultrahigh temperature (UHT) crustal metamorphism. It consists in Archean crustal units, composed of orthogneissic domes and greenstone belts, strongly remobilized during the Paleoproterozoic orogeny which was recognized as an UHT event (peak T > 1000 Â°C and P â 9-12 kbar). This metamorphism was essentially defined locally in Al-Mg granulites, Al-Fe granulites and quartzites outcropping in the Northern part of the In Ouzzal terrane (IOT). In order to test and verify the regional spread of the UHT metamorphism in this terrane, ternary feldspar thermometry on varied rock types (Metanorite, Granulite Al-Mg and Orthogneiss) and samples that crop out in different zones of the In Ouzzal terrane. These rocks contain either perthitic, antiperthitic or mesoperthitic parageneses. Ternary feldspars used in this study have clearly a metamorphic origin. The obtained results combined with previous works show that this UHT metamorphism (>900 Â°C) affected the whole In Ouzzal crustal block. This is of major importance as for future discussion on the geodynamic context responsible for this regional UHT metamorphism.\n\nDetrital Zircons Split Sibumasu in East Gondwana\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, X.; Chung, S. L.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIt is widely accepted that Sibumasu developed as a united terrane and originated from NW Australian margin in East Gondwana. Here we report new detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data from Sumatra that, in combination with literature data, challenge and refute the above long-held view. In particular, the East and West Sumatra terranes share nearly identical Precambrian to Paleozoic detrital zircon age distributions and Hf isotopes, indicating a common provenance/origin for them. The Sumatra detrital zircons exhibit a prominent population of ca. 1170-1070 Ma, indistinguishable from those of the Lhasa and West Burma terranes, with detritus most probably sourcing from western Australia. By contrast, Sibuma (Sibumasu excluding Sumatra) detrital zircons display a prevailing population of ca. 980-935 Ma, strongly resembling those of the western Qiangtang terrane, with detrital materials most likely derived from Greater India and Himalayas. Such markedly distinct detrital zircon age profiles between Sumatra and Sibuma require disparate sources/origin for them, provoking disintegration of the widely-adopted, but outdated, term Sibumasu and thus inviting a new configuration of East Gondwana in the early Paleozoic, with Sumatra and West Burma lying outboard the Lhasa terrane in the NW Australian margin and Sibuma situated in the northern Greater Indian margin. More future investigations are needed to establish the precise rifting and drifting histories of Sumatra and Sibuma, as two separated terranes, during the breakup of Gondwana.\n\nGeochemistry, Metamorphic Assemblages, and Microstructures in Small Ultramafic Bodies from the Northern Nason Terrane, Washington\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMagloughlin, J. F.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nUltramafic bodies ranging from <1 to 2500 m in length occur in multiple settings across the northern part of the Nason Terrane in the North Cascade Mountains of Washington State. Within the Wenatchee Ridge Orthogneiss (WRO) the bodies are approximately equidimensional, ranging from dm-scale metasomatized lenses up to an exposed diameter of (typically) approximately 40 m. Some bodies are completely serpentinized, but others include dunite, harzburgite, and rare seams of pyroxenite. Many are rimmed by blackwall (talc, phlogopite, tremolite, chlorite, serpentine) coinciding with the Late Cretaceous metamorphism. The Napeequa Ultramafic Body (NUB), cut through and well exposed by the Napeequa River west of Lake Wenatchee, is within the White River Shear Zone (WRSZ, Magloughlin & McEwan, 1988). Though highly variable, it consists of dunite and peridotite and is variably serpentinized with common Mg-amphibole. Assemblages include serp+carb+chl+talc+opq and suggest upper greenschist to low amphibolite facies overprinting. Rare high-strain zones resemble relict pseudotachylyte veins. More common are ultramylonitic zones with olivine grain sizes of <5 microns, suggesting terrane-boundary paleostresses of >250 MPa. The Nine Mile Creek Ultramafic Body (NMCUB) and Grave Ultramafic Body (GUB) are the largest bodies outside of the White River Shear Zone, and are approximately 300 m and 800 long, respectively. Both are characterized by ol+talc+amph along with chlorite pseudomorphs, commonly cut by <40 micron thick ribbons of calcite, and rarely containing Si defined by chromite. These tectonites contain fine-grained olivine, but post-deformational, metamorphic cummingtonite and tremolite. In both bodies, a moderate to strong foliation is developed. It is suggested both bodies are retrogressed garnet peridotites. An interesting problem is why the possible retrogressed garnet peridotite bodies are present south of the WRSZ and surrounded by the metatonalites of the WRO, but none\n\nGeological evolution of the Neoproterozoic Bemarivo Belt, northern Madagascar\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nThomas, Ronald J.; De Waele, B.; Schofield, D.I.; Goodenough, K.M.; Horstwood, M.; Tucker, R.; Bauer, W.; Annells, R.; Howard, K. J.; Walsh, G.; Rabarimanana, M.; Rafahatelo, J.-M.; Ralison, A.V.; Randriamananjara, T.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe broadly east-west trending, Late Neoproterozoic Bemarivo Belt in northern Madagascar has been re-surveyed at 1:100 000 scale as part of a large multi-disciplinary World Bank-sponsored project. The work included acquisition of 14 U-Pb zircon dates and whole-rock major and trace element geochemical data of representative rocks. The belt has previously been modelled as a juvenile Neoproterozoic arc and our findings broadly support that model. The integrated datasets indicate that the Bemarivo Belt is separated by a major ductile shear zone into northern and southern \"terranes\", each with different lithostratigraphy and ages. However, both formed as Neoproterozoic arc/marginal basin assemblages that were translated southwards over the north-south trending domains of \"cratonic\" Madagascar, during the main collisional phase of the East African Orogeny at ca. 540 Ma. The older, southern terrane consists of a sequence of high-grade paragneisses (Sahantaha Group), which were derived from a Palaeoproterozoic source and formed a marginal sequence to the Archaean cratons to the south. These rocks are intruded by an extensive suite of arc-generated metamorphosed plutonic rocks, known as the Antsirabe Nord Suite. Four samples from this suite yielded U-Pb SHRIMP ages at ca. 750 Ma. The northern terrane consists of three groups of metamorphosed supracrustal rocks, including a possible Archaean sequence (Betsiaka Group: maximum depositional age approximately 2477 Ma) and two volcano-sedimentary sequences (high-grade Milanoa Group: maximum depositional age approximately 750 Ma; low grade Daraina Group: extrusive age = 720-740 Ma). These supracrustal rocks are intruded by another suite of arc-generated metamorphosed plutonic rocks, known as the Manambato Suite, 4 samples of which gave U-Pb SHRIMP ages between 705 and 718 Ma. Whole-rock geochemical data confirm the calc-alkaline, arc-related nature of the plutonic rocks. The volcanic rocks of the Daraina and Milanoa groups also\n\nEarly Cretaceous bimodal volcanism in the Duolong Cu mining district, western Tibet: Record of slab breakoff that triggered ca. 108-113 Ma magmatism in the western Qiangtang terrane\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWei, Shao-gang; Tang, Ju-xing; Song, Yang; Liu, Zhi-bo; Feng, Jun; Li, Yan-bo\n\n2017-05-01\n\nWe report new zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotope compositions, and whole-rock major and trace element and Sr-Nd isotope data for the Meiriqiecuo Formation (MF) bimodal volcanic rocks collected from the Duolong Cu mining district (DCMD) in the western Qiangtang terrane (QT), western Tibet. These data provide important constraints on the petrogenetic evolution and geodynamic setting of Early Cretaceous magmatism in the DCMD. The MF bimodal volcanic rocks are mainly basaltic andesite and andesite, with subordinate rhyolite. Four mafic samples yielded zircon U-Pb ages of ca. 108.2-113.0 Ma, and one silicic sample has an age of 109.3 Â± 2.2 Ma, indicating that the mafic and silicic eruptions were contemporaneous. The MF bimodal volcanic rocks belong to the medium-K calc-alkaline to shoshonite series. The rocks show arc-type affinities characterized by significant enrichment in light rare earth (LaN/YbN = 7.74-12.60) and large-ion lithophile elements (Rb, Cs, K, and Pb), but depletions in the high-field-strength elements (Nb, Ta, and Ti), which geochemically resemble Andean arc basalts. Therefore, the MF bimodal volcanic rocks were likely emplaced at an Andean-type active continental margin and represent an Early Cretaceous magmatic arc that was located at the western QT margin. Moreover, the mafic volcanic rocks have high initial Sr isotopic ratios (0.705269-0.705413) and negative ÎµNd(t) values of -1.5 to -0.6 compared with the silicic volcanic rocks ((87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.704770-0.704903; ÎµNd(t) = +1.2 to +1.3). Zircons from silicic samples have significantly higher ÎµHf(t) values (+11.6 to +15.5) and predominantly lower Paleoproterozoic Hf crustal model ages (TDMC = 180-428 Ma) than the mafic samples, which have variable ÎµHf(t) values of +3.4 to +13.0 and TDMC ages of 346-952 Ma. These results indicate that the mafic and silicic end-members of the MF bimodal suite were generated from mantle and crustal sources, respectively. The basaltic andesite and andesite may have been\n\nMetamorphic records for subduction erosion and subsequent underplating processes revealed by garnet-staurolite-muscovite schists in central Qiangtang, Tibet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Xiu-Zheng; Dong, Yong-Sheng; Wang, Qiang; Dan, Wei; Zhang, Chunfu; Xu, Wang; Huang, Ming-Liang\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSubduction erosion is confirmed as a crucial geodynamic process of crustal recycling based on geological, geochemical, and geophysical observations at modern convergent plate margins. So far, not a single metamorphic record has been used for constraining a general tectonic evolution for subduction erosion. Here we first revealed metamorphic records for a subduction erosion process based on our study of the Late Paleozoic garnet-staurolite-muscovite schists in the central Qiangtang block, Tibet. Provenance analyses suggest that the protoliths of garnet-staurolite-muscovite schists have the Northern Qiangtang-affinity and were deposited in an active continental margin setting. Mineral inclusion data show that the early metamorphic stage (M1) recorded blueschist facies pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions of 0.8-1.1 GPa and 402-441Â°C, indicating that a part of the material from the overriding plate had been abraded into the subduction channel and undergone high-pressure/low-temperature metamorphism. The peak metamorphic stage (M2) recorded amphibolite facies P-T conditions of 0.3-0.5 GPa and 470-520Â°C. The 40Ar/39Ar cooling ages (263-259 Ma) yielded from muscovite suggest the amphibolite facies metamorphism (>263 Ma) occurred at oceanic subduction stage. The distinctly staged metamorphism defines a clockwise and warming decompression P-T-t path which reveals an underplating process following the early subduction erosion. During the tectonic process, the eroded low-density material escaped from the cold subduction channel and rise upward into the warm middle-lower crust of the upper plate, undergoing amphibolite facies metamorphism. Our new results revealed a complete evolutional process from the early subduction erosion to the subsequent underplating during the northward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean.\n\nZircon U-Pb dating of eclogite from the Qiangtang terrane, north-central Tibet: a case of metamorphic zircon with magmatic geochemical features\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhai, Qing-guo; Jahn, Bor-ming; Li, Xian-hua; Zhang, Ru-yuan; Li, Qiu-li; Yang, Ya-nan; Wang, Jun; Liu, Tong; Hu, Pei-yuan; Tang, Suo-han\n\n2017-06-01\n\nZircon is probably the most important mineral used in the dating formation of high-pressure (HP) and ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks. The origin of zircon, i.e., magmatic or metamorphic, is commonly assessed by its external morphology, internal structure, mineral inclusions, Th/U ratios and trace element composition. In this study, we present an unusual case of metamorphic zircon from the Qiangtang eclogite, north-central Tibet. The zircon grains contain numerous eclogite-facies mineral inclusions, including omphacite, phengite, garnet and rutile; hence, they are clearly of metamorphic origin. However, they display features similar to common magmatic zircon, including euhedral crystal habit, high Th/U ratios and enriched heavy rare earth elements pattern. We suggest that these zircon grains formed from a different reservoir from that for garnet where no trace elements was present and trace element equilibrium between zircon and garnet was achieved. U-Pb dating of zircon gave an age of 232-237 Ma for the eclogite, and that of rutile yielded a slightly younger age of ca. 217 Ma. These ages are consistent with the reported Lu-Hf mineral isochron and phengite Ar-Ar ages. The zircon U-Pb and mineral Lu-Hf isochron ages are interpreted as the time of the peak eclogite-facies metamorphism, whereas the rutile U-Pb and phengite Ar-Ar ages represent the time of exhumation to the middle crust. Thus, the distinction between metamorphic and magmatic zircons cannot be made using only Th/U ratios and heavy REE compositions for HP-UHP metamorphic rocks of oceanic derivation.\n\nRadiolarian biostratigraphy of the Quinn River Formation, Black Rock terrane, north-central Nevada: correlations with eastern Klamath terrane geology\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBlome, C.D.; Reed, K.M.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe Quinn River Formation, Black Rock terrane, Quinn River Crossing, is one of the few Nevadan sections of Permian and Triassic strata that are unaffected by Sonoman deformation. The formation consists of: 1) a basal tuff overlain by limestone and ferruginous dolomite, 2) interbedded radiolarian-bearing chert and argillite, 3) siltstone and carbonaceous shale, and 4) partly volcaniclastic rocks. All but the uppermost (barren) chert samples contain Late Permian radiolarian taxa. These radiolarians suggest that early Wordian conodonts reported from near the top of the chert and argillite unit are reworked. Poorly preserved Early(?) or Middle triassic radiolarians and Middle Triassic ammonites and pectenacid bivalves from the middle part of the volcaniclastic unit indicate the Early Triassic deposition cannot be documented at Quinn River. The ages of the Quinn River brachiopod, conodont, and radiolarian faunas resemble those of the Dekkas and Pit Formations, eastern Klamath terrane, northern California. The analogous Quinn River and eastern Klamath rock types and faunal ages, as well as similar hiatuses in their stratigraphic records, suggest that they may be lateral equivalents that formed in the same island-arc sedimentary basin. -from Authors\n\nGravity signatures of terrane accretion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFranco, Heather; Abbott, Dallas\n\n1999-01-01\n\nIn modern collisional environments, accreted terranes are bracketed by forearc gravity lows, a gravitational feature which results from the abandonment of the original trench and the initiation of a new trench seaward of the accreted terrane. The size and shape of the gravity low depends on the type of accreted feature and the strength of the formerly subducting plate. Along the Central American trench, the accretion of Gorgona Island caused a seaward trench jump of 48 to 66 km. The relict trench axes show up as gravity lows behind the trench with minimum values of -78 mgal (N of Gorgona) and -49 mgal (S of Gorgona) respectively. These forearc gravity lows have little or no topographic expression. The active trench immediately seaward of these forearc gravity lows has minimum gravity values of -59 mgal (N of Gorgona) and -58 mgal (S of Gorgona), respectively. In the north, the active trench has a less pronounced gravity low than the sediment covered forearc. In the Mariana arc, two Cretaceous seamounts have been accreted to the Eocene arc. The northern seamount is most likely a large block, the southern seamount may be a thrust slice. These more recent accretion events have produced modest forearc topographic and gravity lows in comparison with the topographic and gravity lows within the active trench. However, the minimum values of the Mariana forearc gravity lows are modest only by comparison to the Mariana Trench (-216 mgal); their absolute values are more negative than at Gorgona Island (-145 to -146 mgal). We speculate that the forearc gravity lows and seaward trench jumps near Gorgona Island were produced by the accretion of a hotspot island from a strong plate. The Mariana gravity lows and seaward trench jumps (or thrust slices) were the result of breaking a relatively weak plate close to the seamount edifice. These gravity lows resulting from accretion events should be preserved in older accreted terranes.\n\nGeophysical modeling of the northern Appalachian Brompton-Cameron, Central Maine, and Avalon terranes under the New Jersey Coastal Plain\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMaguire, T.J.; Sheridan, R.E.; Volkert, R.A.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nA regional terrane map of the New Jersey Coastal Plain basement was constructed using seismic, drilling, gravity and magnetic data. The Brompton-Cameron and Central Maine terranes were coalesced as one volcanic island arc terrane before obducting onto Laurentian, Grenville age, continental crust in the Taconian orogeny [Rankin, D.W., 1994. Continental margin of the eastern United States: past and present. In: Speed, R.C., (Ed.), Phanerozoic Evolution of North American Continent-Ocean Transitions. DNAG Continent-Ocean Transect Volume. Geological Society of America, Boulder, Colorado, pp. 129-218]. Volcanic island-arc rocks of the Avalon terrane are in contact with Central Maine terrane rocks in southern Connecticut where the latter are overthrust onto the Brompton-Cameron terrane, which is thrust over Laurentian basement. Similarities of these allochthonous island arc terranes (Brompton-Cameron, Central Maine, Avalon) in lithology, fauna and age suggest that they are faulted segments of the margin of one major late Precambrian to early Paleozoic, high latitude peri-Gondwana island arc designated as \"Avalonia\", which collided with Laurentia in the early to middle Paleozoic. The Brompton Cameron, Central Maine, and Avalon terranes are projected as the basement under the eastern New Jersey Coastal Plain based on drill core samples of metamorphic rocks of active margin/magmatic arc origin. A seismic reflection profile across the New York Bight traces the gentle dipping (approximately 20 degrees) Cameron's Line Taconian suture southeast beneath allochthonous Avalon and other terranes to a 4 sec TWTT depth (approximately 9 km) where the Avalonian rocks are over Laurentian crust. Gentle up-plunge (approximately 5 degrees) projections to the southwest bring the Laurentian Grenville age basement and the drift-stage early Paleozoic cover rocks to windows in Burlington Co. at approximately 1 km depth and Cape May Co. at approximately 2 km depths.

A gravity study.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCampos-Enriquez, J. O.; Alatorre-Zamora, M. A.; RamÃ³n, V. M.; Belmonte, S.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nNorthern Oaxaca terrane, southern Mexico, is bound by the Caltepec and Oaxaca faults to the west and east, respectively. These faults juxtapose the Oaxaca terrane against the Mixteca and Juarez terranes, respectively. The Oaxaca Fault also forms the eastern boundary of the Cenozoic Tehuacan depression. Several gravity profiles across these faults and the Oaxaca terrane (including the Tehuacan Valley) enables us to establish the upper crustal structure of this region. Accordingly, the Oaxaca terrane is downward displaced to the east in two steps. First the Santa Lucia Fault puts into contact the granulitic basamental rocks with Phanerozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Finally, the Gavilan Fault puts into contact the Oaxaca terrane basement (Oaxaca Complex) into contact with the volcano-sedimentary infill of the valley. This gravity study reveals that the Oaxaca Fault system gives rise to a series of east tilted basamental blocks (Oaxaca Complex?). A structural high at the western Tehuacan depression accomadates the east dipping faults (Santa Lucia and Gavilan faults) and the west dipping faults of the Oaxaca Fault System. To the west of this high structural we have the depper depocenters. The Oaxaca Complex, the Caltepec and Santa Lucia faults continue northwestwards beneath Phanerozoic rocks. The faults are regional tectonic structures. They seem to continue northwards below the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. A major E-W to NE-SW discontinuity on the Oaxaca terrane is inferred to exist between profiles 1 and 2. The Tehuacan Valley posses a large groundwater potential.\n\nPetrochemistry of Mafic Rocks Within the Northern Cache Creek Terrane, NW British Columbia, Canada\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEnglish, J. M.; Johnston, S. T.; Mihalynuk, M. G.\n\n2002-12-01\n\nThe Cache Creek terrane is a belt of oceanic rocks that extend the length of the Cordillera in British Columbia. Fossil fauna in this belt are exotic with respect to the remainder of the Canadian Cordillera, as they are of equatorial Tethyan affinity, contrasting with coeval faunas in adjacent terranes that show closer linkages with ancestral North America. Preliminary results reported here from geochemical studies of mafic rocks within the Nakina area of NW British Columbia further constrain the origin of this enigmatic terrane. The terrane is typified by tectonically imbricated slices of chert, argillite, limestone, wacke and volcaniclastic rocks, as well as mafic and ultramafic rocks. These lithologies are believed to represent two separate lithotectonic elements: Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic, subduction-related accretionary complexes, and dismembered basement assemblages emplaced during the closure of the Cache Creek ocean in the Middle Jurassic. Petrochemical analysis revealed four distinct mafic igneous assemblages that include: magmatic 'knockers' of the Nimbus serpentinite mÃ©lange, metabasalts of 'Blackcaps' Mountain, augite-phyric breccias of 'Laughing Moose' Creek, and volcanic pediments to the reef-forming carbonates of the Horsefeed Formation. Major and trace element analysis classifies the 'Laughing Moose' breccias and the carbonate-associated volcanics as alkaline in nature, whereas the rest are subalkaline. Tectonic discrimination diagrams show that the alkaline rocks are of within-plate affinity, while the 'Blackcaps' basalts and 'knockers' from within the mÃ©lange typically straddle the island-arc tholeiite and the mid-ocean ridge boundaries. However, primitive mantle normalized multi-element plots indicate that these subalkaline rocks have pronounced negative Nb anomalies, a characteristic arc signature. The spatial association of alkaline volcanic rocks with extensive carbonate domains points to the existence of seamounts within the Cache\n\nTwo flysch belts having distinctly different provenance suggest no stratigraphic link between the Wrangellia composite terrane and the paleo-Alaskan margin\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHults, Chad P.; Wilson, Frederic H.; Donelick, Raymond A.; O'Sullivan, Paul B.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe provenance of Jurassic to Cretaceous flysch along the northern boundary of the allochthonous Wrangellia composite terrane, exposed from the Lake Clark region of southwest Alaska to the Nutzotin Mountains in eastern Alaska, suggests that the flysch can be divided into two belts having different sources. On the north, the Kahiltna flysch and Kuskokwim Group overlie and were derived from the Farwell and Yukon-Tanana terranes, as well as smaller related terranes that were part of the paleo-Alaskan margin. Paleocurrent indicators for these two units suggest that they derived sediment from the north and west. Sandstones are predominantly lithic wacke that contain abundant quartz grains, lithic rock fragments, and detrital mica, which suggest that these rocks were derived from recycled orogen and arc sources. Conglomerates contain limestone clasts that have fossils matching terranes that made up the paleo-Alaskan margin. In contrast, flysch units on the south overlie and were derived from the Wrangellia composite terrane. Paleocurrent indicators for these units suggest that they derived sediment from the south. Sandstones are predominantly feldspathic wackes that contain abundant plagioclase grains and volcanic rock fragments, which suggest these rocks were derived from an arc. Clast compositions in conglomerate south of the boundary match rock types of the Wrangellia composite terrane. The distributions of detrital zircon ages also differentiate the flysch units. Flysch units on the north average 54% Mesozoic, 14% Paleozoic, and 32% Precambrian detrital zircons, reflecting derivation from the older Yukon-Tanana, Farewell, and other terranes that made up the paleo-Alaskan margin. In comparison, flysch units on the south average 94% Mesozoic, 1% Paleozoic, and 5% Precambrian zircons, which are consistent with derivation from the Mesozoic oceanic magmatic arc rocks in the Wrangellia composite terrane. In particular, the flysch units on the south contain a large\n\nConfirmation of the southwest continuation of the Cat Square terrane, southern Appalachian I"
