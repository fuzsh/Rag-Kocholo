This is known as the Black-Merton-Scholes option pricing formula. The purpose of this essay is to explain why the Black-Merton-Scholes option pricing formula is so important to the finance profession, the economics profession, the financial industry, and society at large. This is done by studying the history of the formula's development, the economic logic underlying the formula's derivation, and the formula's ramifications for the various professions.",
