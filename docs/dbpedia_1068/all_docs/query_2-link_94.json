        "text": "Aconsiderable amount of cultural and biological diversity on Earth is connected to Indigenous communities. For example, an estimated five thousand distinct Indigenous cultural groups (speaking four thousand Indigenous languages) belong to geographical territories that cover approximately 24 percent of land worldwide, hosting up to 80 percent of our planet's biodiversity. This is despite Indigenous communities making up only 5 percent of the global population. Like all communities, Indigenous communities are subject to climate change. Yet unlike others, they are particularly vulnerable to its social and environmental effects since they are already compromised by long-standing injustices in the form of social, political, economic, and cultural (SPEC) marginalization. Though they constitute only 5 percent of the global population, they make up 15 percent of the global poor. For example, due to Māori tribal communities having their lands stolen and subsequently being forced to migrate away from their ancestral homelands, the Northland region remains the most impoverished area in Aotearoa (the Māori name for New Zealand). The largely coastal and rural Indigenous tribal communities in New Zealand are vulnerable to extreme flooding events resulting from unpredictable weather patterns, sea level rise, and coastal erosion. This double burden of SPEC marginalization and the effects of climate change directly threatens the continued survival of Indigenous communities, and thereby also jeopardizes not just the cultural diversity mentioned above but also, plausibly, our planet's biological diversity.Footnote 1 After all, not only are many Indigenous practices committed to environmental protection (for example, the Māori practices governed by kaitiakitanga, as we discuss below) but also a great amount of knowledge about the environment and its protection exists only with and within social practices (language practices being merely the most obvious example).\n\nIt is reasonable to claim that Indigenous communities have a right to exist on their lands and waterways and to pursue the lives they value by enacting the numerous practices that represent their rich cultures. Denial of that right is disrespectful and represents a lack of recognition, which is an injustice not merely because it constrains Indigenous people or does them harm but also because it impairs them in their positive understanding of self at both the level of the community and the level of the individual.Footnote 2 This alone provides very strong grounds for empowering Indigenous groups, especially through recognizing and rectifying historical injustices (and thereby eliminating marginalization), and though this is surely reason enough for protecting these communities, in this essay we will defend further, secondary grounds for doing so. Only by protecting these groups can we preserve the practices that are critical for worldwide human flourishing in the face of climate change. Thus, the empowerment of these groups not only directly supports their own flourishing but also indirectly supports the long-term flourishing of communities elsewhere (Indigenous and non-Indigenous alike).\n\nGiven how critical Indigenous communities are for preserving diversity, it is unfortunate that enabling and securing their functioning and flourishing remains an ongoing, widespread challenge. To be sure, recognition of the value of Indigenous communities for protecting our planet is on the rise,Footnote 3 but the implementation of local and regional policies for removing barriers to protection and promoting genuine and equitable partnerships with Indigenous peoples (along with the global goals and targets those policies are meant to achieve)Footnote 4 continues to lag. Many of these communities experience limited land tenure and constraints on access to natural resources; their voices and perspectives frequently also fail to be accommodated in policy and law. Together, these conditions are barriers to collective self-determination and justice.Footnote 5 Creating real opportunities for Indigenous communities to cultivate their socioenvironmental practices, and thereby to maintain and refine their practical cultural heritage, is critical. In particular, as this essay argues, global justice will be pursued and realized only when we recognize the need for a rich and diverse range of socioenvironmental practices, which necessitates further protection of the communities in which they are enacted.\n\nAn example of a rich and diverse set of Indigenous practices can be found under the umbrella of kaitiakitanga (usually translated into English as “stewardship” or “guardianship”), a Māori concept that indicates the intimate, place-based attachments of a community and codifies the socioenvironmental responsibilities that arise therefrom.Footnote 6 Of philosophical and practical importance is the way that kaitiakitanga conceptualizes and maps the distribution of responsibilities to protect and enhance human-environment relationships, and how it guides practices through norms of care, use restriction, and restoration.Footnote 7 These human-environment relationships are of central concern regarding virtually all practices that involve the utilization of natural resources, such as harvesting and hunting.Footnote 8 Preserving and strengthening these relationships relies on deep, placed-based knowledge, relevant practical experience, and structures for the intergenerational transfer of both. Thus, kaitiakitanga also extends to practices of research (for example, species monitoring and ecosystem health) as well as education and knowledge transfer.\n\nPractices and concepts, and the complex networks they make up, are not static, of course. In the past, these elements had to adapt to different environments to maintain both individual and communal flourishing. For instance, Polynesian ancestors of the Māori travelled across the Pacific and then through Aotearoa. This required adaptation and responsiveness—in particular, the ability to incorporate new ideas and practical innovations. Such dynamism draws much needed attention to the way in which diverse and transformative practices are vital for living well at both the level of the individual and the level of the community, especially when they are confronted with change and uncertainty. As we will further argue, only by recognizing the significance of thriving Indigenous communities for the persistence and thriving of practices like those that fall under the kaitiakitanga umbrella can we properly recognize the voices and perspectives of these communities in global climate policy and law.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a highly globalized world, where climate change–induced and other forms of environmental degradation increasingly affect the flourishing of virtually all humans, Indigenous and other local communities continue to be subject to the greatest degrees of social, political, economic, and cultural marginalization. At the same time, these communities’ social practices—existing and surviving only through continuous performance of their members—account for much of the richness and diversity of a global practice portfolio. Protecting local practice communities, and enabling them to thrive, is a critical issue of justice. Key obstacles to their ability to thrive include barriers to participating in global decision-making, a lack of recognition of the central role of social practices for charting on-the-ground change, and a subsequent lack of imagination in reconceiving global climate goals and strategies. By reforming global climate policy structures and processes to account for the contributions of Indigenous and other local practitioners, our worldwide climate conversations and the policies they spawn might get us closer to securing flourishing for all in the long term. The shared future of Indigenous communities, and indeed of our entire planet, depends on it."
