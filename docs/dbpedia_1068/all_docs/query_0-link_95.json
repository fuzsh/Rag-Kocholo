        "text": "To the Editor:\n\nSteven Johnson’s essay “I Was an Under-Age Semiotician” (Oct. 16) paints an all-too-familiar portrait of semiotics as jargon-laden and ridiculous. But there’s one saving grace: He and several peers apparently found a “secret layer of meaning” and developed “conceptual antennas” sufficient enough to secure “influential careers in the media and the creative arts.”\n\nCharacterizing the practice of semiotics in this way — as obtuse but also as a way for the elite to get further ahead — is depressingly ironic and wrongheaded. Dating back to Roland Barthes and his writings on myth, semiotics at its best is an instrument against power, a way to reveal how mainstream media narratives normalize and perpetuate an unhealthy, unjust status quo.\n\nI’ve been using a streamlined, almost jargon-free version of semiotics in my undergraduate Methods of Media Criticism class for more than a decade. Whether the subject is a commercial for the New York Stock Exchange, a magazine feature on the “world’s most beautiful people,” vigilante action movies, or television programs in which the poor are invisible, running from the police or denying paternity to talk show hosts — semiotics and other methods of analysis empower my students to see the hegemonic bill of goods their culture regularly sells them. And they understand it all just fine.Marco Calavita\n\nRohnert Park, Calif.\n\nThe writer is an associate professor of communication studies at Sonoma State University.\n\n•\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIn his essay Steven Johnson has fun (as he has in the past) with the prose style he developed in the semiotics program at Brown University. (He quotes from a paper he wrote “at the age of 19”: “The predicament of any tropological analysis of narrative always lies in its own effaced and circuitous recourse to a metaphoric mode of apprehending its object. . . . ”) As a founder of the program, I remember Johnson, and he did write that way. But some semioticians wrote with clarity — Tzvetan Todorov and Umberto Eco, for example — and I rather think I did so myself. But students take what they want, or what they need at the time, and the good ones find ways to use or abuse what they learned — or both.Robert Scholes\n\nBarrington, R.I.\n\nThe writer is a research professor of modern culture and media at Brown University.\n\n•\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nHaving taught at Brown for 16 years, including a course on Charles Sanders Peirce, the modern founder of sign theory, I found Steven Johnson’s essay to be a depressingly accurate characterization of the academic times during his college years. However, readers should know that his identification of semiotics as a field of study by linking it with Peirce, an American philosopher, and the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure is a serious, albeit common, misconception. Saussure’s version is defective next to Peirce’s, and not curable by patch-up. That it was Saussure’s ideas about signs, and not Peirce’s, that gave rise to the Continental form Jacques Derrida and others propagated — and gullible American academics swallowed whole — should not be so glibly elided. Peirce is the greatest intellect the Americas ever produced, and it is his whole philosophy, including his semeiotic (note the spelling and the singular number) that now bids fair to prevail as doctrine.\n\nMICHAEL SHAPIRO\n\nNew York\n\nThe writer is an emeritus professor of Slavic and semiotic studies at Brown University."
