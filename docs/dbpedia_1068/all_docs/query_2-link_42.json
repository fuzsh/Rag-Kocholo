        "text": "Faculty Spotlight: Sarah Hart Mike\n\nFall 2021, Written by Kamila Kinyon.\n\nThis article is one in a series of Faculty Spotlights created by the Student Outreach and Celebration Committee\n\nWhen most students think of a required writing class, they’ll likely think of formal thesis statements, a required number of sources, perfect MLA, carefully crafted sentences, and sculpted paragraphs, all to fit in with a generalized notion of what academic writing means. However, DU’s writing sequence asks students to expand their concept of writing to involve a range of genres for specific audiences, public as well as scholarly. Within this larger framework, service learning courses make the notion of audience come alive by tying writing to collaboration with a particular community. This fostering of collaborative relationships in writing is central to Professor Sarah Hart Micke’s vision.\n\n\"Asked about her approach, Hart Micke found that this “gives students a strong sense of real readers” and builds students’ awareness of the need for writing, of an actual audience, and of what makes writing meaningful.\"\n\nWorking closely with CCELL and nearby Charles Hay Elementary School, Hart Micke introduces students to the concepts of community-engaged collaborative writing in her WRIT 1122 service-learning course, a course that asks college writers to reimagine and re-write classic fairy tales with and for second graders. During the writing process, DU students closely analyze a curricular text for its rhetorical effects, give feedback to the second-graders on their writing, and then write a fairy tale of their own to share. Asked about her approach, Hart Micke found that this “gives students a strong sense of real readers” and builds students’ awareness of the need for writing, of an actual audience, and of what makes writing meaningful.\n\nWhile teaching this course, Hart Micke formed a close collaborative relationship with her student Carly Hudson, who created the fairy tale “Camarella: The ‘Lost’ Watch,” pictured above, to share with her second-graders. During winter quarter 2020, Hudson served as Public Good Fellow for Hart Micke’s WRIT 1122 classes. Later the same year, and despite Covid-19 restrictions, Hudson helped brainstorm ways that DU and elementary students could continue working together through online writing activities. Hudson worked with Hart Micke to redesign WRIT 1122 for an online format.\n\nHudson also helped Hart Micke and Angela Sowa develop the WRIT 2800: Community Writing course, based on Hart Micke and Sowa’s Winter 2018 course that partnered DU writers with Indian Hills Fire Rescue to learn about grant writing. Sowa will be teaching a new iteration of WRIT 2800 in spring of 2022.\n\nHart Micke’s spring 2022 online synchronous sections of “Rhetoric, Journalism, and Social Justice: A Glimpse into the Past” explore how journalists write and why it matters. This innovative course shows how community can be fostered even under the altered conditions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough COVID has paused Hart Micke’s service learning courses this year, her new WRIT 1122 course centers on cultivating community through journalism. Students study the life and work of a mentor writer, a 20th century journalist of their choice, then use that mentor to cultivate, shape, and inspire their own writing. Hart Micke’s spring 2022 online synchronous sections of “Rhetoric, Journalism, and Social Justice: A Glimpse into the Past” explore how journalists write and why it matters. This innovative course shows how community can be fostered even under the altered conditions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHart Micke continues to inspire us with her collaborative work with students and her versatile approaches to rhetoric and community-engaged writing.\n\nFaculty Spotlight: Rob Gilmor\n\nThis article is one in a series of Faculty Spotlights created by the Student Outreach and Celebration Committee.\n\nIn Professor Robert Gilmor’s research courses, students don’t simply acquire knowledge – they build knowledge, together, diving deep into DU’s extensive Special Collections and Archives to uncover stories from our collective past. In his research and writing courses, Gilmor asks his students a few seemingly simple opening questions: What stories can we tell? What stories can’t we tell? What stories aren’t being told?\n\nFrom there, students dedicate weeks of work, searching through primary artifacts, historical records, city ledgers, faded DU yearbooks, and other displaced materials. In the process, they work closely with librarians Jeanne Abrams and Katherine Crowe, both curators of DU’s special collections, to uncover a past that was.\n\nAnd the stories that Gilmor’s students have uncovered include everything from the history of the Alpine Club on campus to DU’s self-proclaimed “Woodstock of the West,” which involved a strike and picket lines, a boycott on classes, plus a squad of manufactured structures that served as a commune (and sit-in) to protest the Vietnam War.\n\nGilmor asks his students a few seemingly simple opening questions: What stories can we tell? What stories can’t we tell? What stories aren’t being told?\n\nAlong the way, Gilmor’s students gain first-hand experience with archival research, using interpretive methods to analyze and understand primary artifacts within their original contexts, while also wrestling with ethical questions of who can tell whose stories fairly and most appropriately. Their efforts pay off at the end of the quarter with physical and digital exhibits of their work: imagine mini museum galleries of images and text, each focused on an individual project.\n\n[insert picture: facultyspotlightrobgilmorfall12021.jpg; alt text=A physical exhibit hanging in Anderson Academic Commons in Fall of 2021]\n\nEmily Gillette, one of Gilmor’s recent students, took on the 1918 Pandemic as her personal project, asking what student life must have looked like for students on the DU campus, how students’ daily lives were changed, how everything from athletics to the Students’ Army Training Corps (SATC) had to have been transformed by a viral outbreak that ended up claiming 55 million lives.\n\nAmong Gillette’s most interesting findings was that, in September 1918, the influenza pandemic eventually reached Colorado, striking particularly close to home: the first documented case in Colorado was of Blanche Kennedy, a 20-year-old University of Denver student at the time.\n\n“Some of the most useful things I learned while taking [Gilmor’s] class,” Gillette writes, “was how to do research… by narrowing down search parameters to get the most relevant information” efficiently. Gillette credits Professor Gilmor’s instruction for helping her locate “what may be the only existing photo of Blanche Kennedy.”\n\nA DU student: the first documented case. As Gillette writes, young Blanche Kennedy returned to campus after a family trip to Chicago, a city that, at the time, “had been a hotspot for influenza,” and, Gillette continues, Kennedy perished on September 27th.\n\n“Some of the most useful things I learned while taking [Gilmor’s] class,” Gillette writes, “was how to do research… by narrowing down search parameters to get the most relevant information” efficiently. Gillette credits Professor Gilmor’s instruction for helping her locate “what may be the only existing photo of Blanche Kennedy.”\n\nSuch discoveries make research and writing matter to students, as they learn to position themselves in the larger cultural legacy of DU and begin to understand themselves more fully in our collective history. “It’s about discovering and making connections,” says Gilmor, “between students and the past, between the past and the present. The exhibits are a great payoff, too, as they offer chances to reach a real audience: the DU community we’re all a part of.”\n\nSummer 2021 Newsletter\n\nThe University Writing Program, Doug Hesse, Executive Director | dhesse@du.edu | writing@du.edu\n\nThe Writing Center, Juli Parrish, Director | Juli.Parrish@du.edu\n\nIn this issue:\n\nWriting Retreat Engages 47 Faculty from across DU\n\nRe-Visioning Teaching: 20 Essays by Writing Professors\n\nZooming in: Lessons from the Pandemic Writing Center\n\nStudent Katey Foley Interviews Professor Scott Phillips\n\nNews & Notes\n\nRetreat Engages 47 Faculty Writers from Across DU (July 13, 2021)\n\nIn June, the Writing Program hosted intensive writing retreats for 47 DU faculty, from all 6 faculty series, from 10 DU colleges and schools. Collectively, these professors spent 123 hours in cross-disciplinary conversations about writing. Individually, each produced 12 hours of writing. Even as they re-energized key projects, professors valued connecting to colleagues across campus. In the case of many who began at DU during the pandemic, this was the first time they had extended interactions with colleagues from other departments.\n\nWe knew that that many faculty’s writing habits had been disrupted over the past academic year, as we and they found ways to teach our classes, carry out service and community responsibilities, and support our students in the ever-changing pandemic academic landscape. We aimed to help faculty to end the year by jump-starting or refreshing writing projects that may have idled for the past few months or quarters. We had three goals: 1) to create space for faculty to dedicate their time and attention to a writing project; 2) to encourage faculty to establish or reconnect with a consistent writing practice; and 3) to build a community of support and accountability with a focus on the writing process. We focused on faculty at the assistant level, across all series, and we were able to offer stipends to all participants, through campus pandemic-response funds that the Writing Program had garnered.\n\nWriting Center Assistant Director Megan Kelly planned and facilitated this program, in collaboration with Writing Center Director Juli Parrish. Joining them as expert facilitators were Writing faculty David Riche, Aubrey Schiavone, and Kara Taczak, and Writing Center consultant/doctoral student Sara Sheiner.\n\nProfessor Kelly reports that the two intensive three-day retreats made enabled many faculty to return to important projects. For example, one attendee wrote that “carving out time to write has been so challenging in the past year (I have a pandemic baby, health challenges, and some struggles with childcare), so just that has been immensely helpful.” Another noted that “an unexpected benefit was that this retreat energized me and renewed my excitement about a few writing projects. This is HUGE after feeling completely disconnected and exhausted from this academic year. I am writing with passion and purpose again!”\n\nA major benefit of the retreat was that, through writing and talking about writing, faculty were able to connect with colleagues across campus, in some cases for the first time since joining the DU faculty. One attendee commented, “My small group conversations were really wonderful. It was a kind, generous, supportive space, and as a new faculty member at DU, it was great to meet some of my colleagues.” Another wrote, “Conversations helped me to foster a sense of connection and community with other faculty. I feel invigorated and motivated to keep this momentum.”\n\nFor us, the retreats were a reminder of the key role of conversation and collaboration—hallmarks of writing pedagogy—in writing projects and the value to faculty of being able to share their work with one another.\n\nRe-Visioning Teaching: Essays by Writing Faculty (Spring 2021)\n\nShortly after the school year ended, twenty DU Writing Professors wrote short articles that analyzed and reflected on aspects of their teaching. Samples of their work can be found below:\n\nBrad Benz, “Face to Face during a Plague Year”\n\nLibby Catchings, “Cheerleading in Solitary Confinement: A Teaching Reflection”\n\nApril Chapman-Ludwig, “Frustrations and Innovations in Hi-Flex\"\n\nRichard Colby, “Just in Time Teaching”\n\nRob Gilmor, “A Remarkable Year: Multimodal Archival and In-Person Research in hybrid WRIT\"\n\nSarah Hart Micke, “Situating Joy: Reflections on Teaching Writing during COVID”\n\nMatt Hill, “The Different Teacher I was Already Becoming: Revision Plans & Learning by Not Succeeding”\n\nKamila Kinyon, “Vehicles of Discovery: Creating Communities of Practice in Autoethnography, Ethnography and Journalism”\n\nHeather Martin, “Work Responsibilities”\n\nLP Picard, “A Classroom that Embraces Practice”\n\nKeith Rhodes, “How the Pandemic Taught Me to Stop Worrying and Love ‘Flow’”\n\nDavid Riche, “I Found Myself Writing Anyway: Innovation, Play & Flexibility during Lockdown”\n\nBlake Sanz, “A New Sequence of Assignments for WRIT 1133”\n\nAubrey Schiavone, “In these Unprecedented Times…”\n\nDan Singer, “Iteruptions, Particularly One”\n\nAngie Sowa, “Building Community and Promoting Underlife in Asynchronous Online Classes”\n\nGeoff Stacks, “The Question of Presence: Practical and Philosophical Reflections about Attendance”\n\nKara Taczak, “Finding Authenticity & Vulnerability through Social Media Practice\"\n\nJohn Tiedemann, “Higher Ed Is Dead / Long Live Higher Ed”\n\nZooming in: Writing Center Lessons from the Pandemic\n\n\"Most of the current DU Writing Center staff have never been to or even seen the Writing Center in Anderson Academic Commons. They’ve never shared a table, used a pencil to write comments on a paper, leaned over to ask another consultant a quick question about literature reviews or reverse outlining. They’ve never met their fellow staff members in person or eaten their lunch in the break room. Their entire experience this year as students and peer consultants has been online, and that’s what they know.\"\n\nSo begins Juli Parrish and Megan Kelly's thorough and thoughtful exploration of how the DU Writing center adapted to online environments. It was a year in which student-centered contacts took new forms. However, larger efforts work hardly stood still, as can be seen in anti-racist programming and a continuing ambitious research agenda.\n\nTo read the entire report, \"Zooming In: Lessons from the Pandemic Writing Center\" click here.\n\nWhat Is and What Should Be: An Interview about Writing with Dr. Scott Phillips by Katey Foley\n\nThis is one in a series of interviews of University of Denver professors conducted by a undergraduates in the Minor in Applied Writing. The interviews explored professors’ early memories of writing; influences on and thoughts about their own development as writers and some of their current writing practices. In this edition, undergraduate writing minor Katey Foley interviewed Criminology Professor Scott Phillips. For more information, please contact Professor Doug Hesse, dhesse@du.edu.\n\n\"It's interesting because I don't feel like there's been a superstar person that I've looked to as a writing model; instead, I've looked to my major Professor from graduate school, who was always a terrific writer. I can't write the way he does because his writing is really sort of arresting and has a punch to it that my writing doesn't have, but I’ve always thought that I was a good enough writer, a decent writer. I honestly don't think my writing is anything special, but I do think it's clear and organized and structured and I tried to try to keep it simple, because I think too many people who work in academia want complicated and confusing for the sake of complicated and confusing. I appreciate shorter sentences that get straight to the point—you know, if you can say it in 10 words, why use 12. Actually, Ruth Bader Ginsburg made that point in something she said about writing, and I agree.\"\n\nRead the entire interview.\n\nNews and Notes from the Writing Program\n\n15th Biennial International Writing Across the Curriculum Conference\n\nEleven members of the DU community presented at the 15th International Writing Across the Curriculum Conference, including seven writing professors, an anthropologist, two doctoral students, and one undergraduate.

Students would learn from Elevation, and, in turn, produce digital content for Elevation’s Thought Leadership page by developing original blogs on UX design.\n\nTo prepare for that partnership, students surveyed social innovation research, qualitative research methods, and theories of the public sphere, creating a framework in which they might productively interrogate their own relationship to digital platforms and their desire to write for the public good. Students then conducted interviews with Elevation Web’s communications and content strategy specialists, working in groups to transcribe, code, and distill interview content for nonprofit audiences, culminating in the multimodal exhibit, “Writing as Content Strategy and UX Design.” The exhibit outlines not only the contours of UX practice for nonprofits, but also the critical roles that empathy and storytelling play in shaping an organization’s digital presence.\n\nWriting Accountability Groups\n\nIn a partnership with the Assistant Provost for Faculty Affairs, the Writing Program lead Writing Accountability Groups throughout 2020-21. Led by Professor Libby Catchings, other Writing faculty group leaders during the year included Rebekah Shultz Colby, Matt Hill, and Aubrey Schiavone. Participants included 39 faculty from across campus.

The Zoom event, a variation from our long tradition of our in-person Oscars-like gala, featured a virtual gallery of student finalist bios and short writing excerpts. Students said a few words about their writing process. A faculty group chaired by April Chapman-Ludwig selected finalists and winners in five categories:\n\nBest Writing in an Academic Genre\n\nBest Writing in a Popular Genre\n\nBest Writing in an Alternative Mode (Multimodal)\n\nBest Rhetorical Analysis\n\nBest Portfolio\n\nTo access the 2020 Fall Showcase program (and a selection of winner's writing submissions), click here.\n\nSuccess at 200%: The Writing Minor at Five\n\nWhen the 20-credit Minor in Writing Practices was approved, The Program expected 20 students in the minor by year five. However, in 2019-20 alone, there were 48 declared minors, with 27 of them already having completed all requirements, including producing online, public-facing portfolios of their work in a Capstone course. Students minoring in writing practices come from majors across campus, including psychology, marketing, engineering, music, international studies, communications, and many others. For more complete information on the minor, please see our website.

The Writing Program has developed three quick, practical, interactive workshops, all via Zoom. Each begins with a presentation of 15-20 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of conversation and specific questions from participants. Each session will be limited to 15 participants to foster engagement. Reserve a spot that fits your need and schedule by using this link.\n\nEffective Online Practices for Student Peer Review\n\nThursday, 10/22 1 pm\n\nWednesday, 10/28 2 pm\n\nAn effective learning activity is having students read and discuss one another's work in progress. Deriving from the academic mainstay of peer review for scholarly submissions, classroom peer review sometimes involves judging quality. However, more often--and generally more effectively--peer review means providing feedback: What's working well? What's confusing or undeveloped? What revisions are available? The online environment can make things more complicated--but also open some options. This 50-minute workshop will provide useful ideas and strategies for incorporating peer review activities in online settings across the curriculum. Led by John Tiedemann and Blake Sanz.\n\nResponding to Writing and Grading Through Canvas (Using or Ignoring Canvas Tools)\n\nFriday, 10/23 2 pm\n\nTuesday, 10/27 1 pm\n\nOnce upon a time, responding to and grading student writing was pretty straightforward: collect physical papers, jot marginal comments, provide a final comment, and insert a grade. Sure, there were issues of What To Say and How To Say It, as well as endless issues of faculty time. But the actual medium of responding was clear. Most of us haven't handled physical papers in years, but with everything online--and usually in Canvas--there are lots of questions. Do I use speed grader? How? Do I annotate papers? Do I download and use track changes, then re-upload? Do I use rubrics? How do I know students are reading my feedback? And, universally still, how am I commenting effectively and efficiently online? This 50-minute workshop will explain the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to responding to writing in online courses. Led by Geoff Stacks and Matt Hill.\n\nUsing Discussion Boards Effectively\n\nFriday, 10/30 11 am\n\nThursday, 11/5 4 pm\n\nCourses that take place significantly or entirely online have altered channels of exchange between students. One obvious solution has been discussion boards within Canvas. Many faculty have enjoyed considerable success with that feature. Yet many others wish the feature were more productive. Some students perceive discussion boards as \"busy work.\" Many produce substandard contributions. Sometimes interactions among students are problematic or lacking. Atop everything is frequently the question from professors: \"OK, what do I DO with the writing in these boards?\" This 50-minute workshop will provide useful ideas and strategies for using discussion boards well. Led by LP Picard and David Riche.\n\nStudent Voice: Julia Cordova, \"Down in the Valley\"\n\n\"Atop the mantle of our fireplace sits a photograph in a worn wooden frame that my father, Ray, claims to have made himself during his childhood with only a pocket-knife and some glue. To this day I still haven't learned whether this is the truth. If it is, his craftmanship was impeccable as a child. Within this \"handmade\" frame lies a photograph that I took three years ago in Questa, New Mexico. Within it lies the vast Sangre De Cristo Mountains overlooking the valley of Questa, as well an old dirt road flanked by unruly yellow sunflowers.\"\n\n--That's the opening of DU undergrad and Writing Center Consultant Julia Cordova's poignant memoir of a daughter and father visiting an aged grandmother in a small village near Taos. Read the entire piece [link to pdf: cordova_down_in_the_valley.pdf], from the collection At Home in the Corona[link to Student Publications>At Home in the Corona], edited by Doug Hesse.\n\nThe Writing Expert Consulting Corps\n\nThe Writing Program has established a group of thirteen professors who this fall are available as workshop leaders and consultants. As of mid-October, WECC has led 52 workshops in classes across campus and 23 professional development seminars for faculty. Serving as writing expert consultants are Professors Juli Parrish, Megan Kelly, Geoff Stacks, Blake Sanz, Keith Rhodes, Heather Martin, Aubrey Schiavone, Matt Hill, David Riche, John Tiedemann, LP Picard, and Doug Hesse. If you'd like a writing expert to lead a workshop in your class, please contact Dr. Juli Parrish at Juli.Parrish@du.edu. If you'd like a writing expert to discuss any aspect of assignment design, responding to student writing, writing development, or so on, please contact dhesse@du.edu.\n\nSpring 2020 Newsletter\n\nHow Writing Handled the Spring\n\n\"We made sure that students still had a way of connecting their learning to a real person.\"\n\n\"If you want your content to matter, then students need to feel like they matter.\"\n\n\"I've taught through Katrina and I've taught through personal crises, but this was the hardest situation that I've had to deal with.\"\n\nThe 29 professors of the DU Writing Program creatively engaged all first-year students during spring's emergency remote teaching. One result: student evaluations program-wide that were among the highest in 14 years.\n\nRead our report [link to Faculty Publications>WPrespondtoCOVID2020] for insights on synchronous v. asynchronous learning, small group and personal conferences, written discussions, course designs, personal costs to faculty, and more. Findings are based on 30,000 words generated through faculty interviews, reflective writings, and surveys about spring 2020.\n\nWriting Center Fall Support: Class Visits, Faculty Workshops, Student Consultations\n\nThis fall, the Writing Center is offering class visits, workshops, and consultations online. Students who make appointments for individual writing consultations will meet with one of our 27 peer consultants, who speak ten languages, have studied in more than 30 academic fields, and participate in extensive ongoing training and education in writing pedagogy and peer tutoring. Learn more about our consultations and workshops and explore our resources\n\n50-Minute September Faculty Workshops\n\nQuick Workshop Topics:\n\nMaking Good Writing Assignments\n\nGrading Efficiently and Effectively\n\nUsing Informal Writing to Teach Course Content\n\nTeaching Effective Source Usage\n\nYou're busy. Writing assignments can take time. We can help.\n\nJoin 50-minute, practical interactive workshops on practical challenges faced by professors across campus.\n\nEach workshop, held through Zoom and capped at 12 participants, will consist of a 20-minute practical presentation and 30 minutes of conversation and questions. Each workshop will be held multiple times. For more information and to sign up, please go to Fall 2020 Practical Workshops for Busy Professors.\n\nStudent Writers, at Home in the Corona\n\nDoug Hesse edited and published a volume of undergraduate writing from in his spring \"Memoir and Personal Writing\" class. The nine pieces include one about being a Mexican American who can pass for white, including at DU, experiencing complex and often troubling questions of identity; a second about returning to a Texas hometown from which gettingthefuckout had been the author's primary imperative; a third that juxtaposes living in Senegal with moving back to a famous house in Massachusetts with her sisters and mother.
