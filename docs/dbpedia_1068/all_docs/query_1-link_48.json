        "text": "This Blog:\n\nIs largely my record of what I see and experience in the local landscape and environment. Recently I have been assisted and have been able to include information and works from a number of other local identities who have been able to share their knowledge and photos in order to provide a greater view of this great region we are fortunate to live in.\n\nIt is hoped that as time goes by this site will eventually provide one of the most comprehensive overviews of the natural features and assets of this region of Central Victoria. I hope you will find it both informative and interesting.\n\nAbout me: Robert Scholes:\n\nI don’t consider myself a photographer, just somebody who takes photos. I am not trained in that field, nor do I possess what would be considered professional equipment. But I enjoy what I do.\n\nPhotography to me is a means of recording what I see and experience in the bush.\n\nI have grown-up in, worked and recreated in the local landscape for over 50 years. I am not trained in any scientific, environmental or botanical field. I did however, train and worked as an outdoor pursuits instructor for over 25 years; and my appreciation for the environment comes from my life time of experiences of being involved in the outdoors.\n\nMy approach to photography is very basic and simply. I use minimal equipment and editing. I find too much equipment is constrictive in the field and editing consumes too much time. In the bush I like moving around and exploring, so whether it’s using a macro or telephoto lens it is almost always hand held. Usually, the only time I take or use a tripod is for taking time exposure shots in low light conditions."
