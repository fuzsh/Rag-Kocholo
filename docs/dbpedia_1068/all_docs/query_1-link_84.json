Digital access to the materials enhances their use and promotes wider availability of historical records in the interests of teaching, research, and learning. Some materials contained within our collections and made digitally accessible may not be consistent with the positions, norms, and values of the University of Virginia community. These materials are products of their particular time and place and may represent positions, norms, values, and language which patrons may find offensive or disturbing. However, these records reflect the shared attitudes and values of the community from which they were collected and thus constitute an important social record. The Archives of the University of Virginia are committed to providing access to these items and strive to include contextual information for them through descriptive records and, where considered necessary, statements attached to digitized objects that issue a warning about potentially sensitive content."
