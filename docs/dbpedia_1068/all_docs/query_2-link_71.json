        "text": "Pedagogy is an innovative journal that aims to build a new discourse around teaching in English studies. Reversing the long history of marginalization of teaching and the scholarship produced around it, it offers a forum for critical reflection and spirited debate. The journal publishes articles by senior scholars as well as more junior members of the profession, featuring voices from many subdisciplines and institutions. Pedagogy promises to stimulate new and exciting developments for undergraduate and graduate instruction in English studies."
