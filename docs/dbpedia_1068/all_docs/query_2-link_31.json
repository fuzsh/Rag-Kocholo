But it was not always that way.\n\nWhen Bernard Rodey steered legislation through the Territorial Legislature to create UNM on Feb. 28, 1889, no public high school existed in the territory, and most people believed a university was a frill the impoverished territory could ill afford. When the university opened its doors three years later, the majority of the 75 students were in the high school Preparatory Department. The only other department, the Normal School, enrolled six public school teachers.\n\nAlthough college-level classes and departments were added the following year, it was only after WWI in 1918 that the university stopped taking high school students.\n\nUNM’s second and third presidents, Clarence Herrick (1897-1901) and William Tight (1901-1909), both geologists, placed an early emphasis on the sciences in the university curriculum. Herrick’s tenure was cut short for health reasons, but Tight was the epitome of a hands-on president. In addition to teaching geology and chemistry, he dug a well and irrigation ditches, laid out campus landscaping, including taking the student body into the Sandia Mountains to bring back trees; and built the first fraternity building, the Estufa, on campus, using construction of the oval-shaped building as a way to teach calculus.\n\nTight was also responsible for adopting the unique architecture that helps make UNM a special place. When the original university building, four-stories of red brick and a high-pitched roof, was in danger of collapse, Tight conceived the idea of remodeling in the Spanish-Pueblo architecture style that was prominent in the territory. Since then, his dream has been reflected in every building constructed on UNM’s main campus. It was also during Tight’s presidency that the Engineering School was formed and the Associated Students of UNM was organized.\n\nThe growth of the university remained slow but steady, reaching an enrollment of 610 students in 1925. The first graduate degrees, in Latin and chemistry, were granted in 1922. In that same year the university first attained national accreditation. It was under UNM’s seventh president, James Fulton Zimmerman (1927-1944), that the university began a major emphasis that continues to this day: reaching south of the border to embrace studies of and ties to Latin America. Today, UNM’s library holdings related to Latin America place it in the top ten in the nation. Scholars from throughout the world travel to Albuquerque to use them. Zimmerman was responsible for creating the College of Education (today the College of Education and Human Sciences) in 1928, the General College (today University College) in 1935, and the College of Fine Arts in 1936. He convinced a relatively unknown Santa Fe architect, John Gaw Meem, to serve as the university’s informal architect. Meem seized on the strength of Tight’s vision and went on to design some of the university’s most distinctive buildings, including a new library in 1936 (Zimmerman Library), Scholes Hall (administration), and the Anthropology Hall.\n\nEnrollment rose to nearly 2,600 under Zimmerman, but then WWII intervened. Zimmerman died in 1944, the same year one of the most significant education bills ever addressed by the U.S. Congress was passed. The G.I. Bill® opened higher education to thousands of men and women who might never have dreamed of pursuing further studies and the nation’s campuses were overwhelmed with returning veterans. In 1947 the university granted its first doctoral degrees and both the College of Business Administration and the School of Law were established.\n\nThomas Popejoy (1948-1968), the first alumnus and first native New Mexican to hold the presidency, oversaw the greatest expansion, both in enrollment and buildings. The great influx of veterans first resulted in the campus being crowded with barracks, but immediately upon taking office, Popejoy lobbied the Legislature for construction funds. A master plan for the campus was created, and the College of Education (today the College of Education and Human Sciences) complex, Johnson Center, the Center for the Arts, and the Student Union, among others, were built on the main campus, while to the north the Health Sciences Center was started and to the south the athletic complex was conceived and constructed.\n\nPopejoy’s successor, Ferrel Heady (1968-1975), successfully steered the campus through the tumultuous Vietnam War years. The Bachelor of University Studies degree began during his tenure, allowing students to tailor their own degrees. In 1968 he oversaw the opening of UNM’s first branch college in Gallup. Heady was also responsible for steering the university on the path to seek an increase of research funds, and it was during the 1970s that the university first began serious discussion of developing a research park. Today, the university, in partnership with both private enterprise and the state’s national research laboratories, Sandia and Los Alamos, provides cutting-edge research for industry and national defense, technology and multiple education and training opportunities for students.\n\nFrom 1975-1982, under President William Davis, research funding doubled, and efforts begun by Herrick and Tight began to be recognized as UNM earned national accolades in the areas of science, technology, and business research. Under Davis, the Latin American and Southwest Hispanic Research Institutes were created, as were branch campuses in Los Alamos and Valencia County.\n\nThe 1980s saw a quick succession of presidents. John Perovich (1982-1984) oversaw the development of the Instructional Television program, allowing the university to deliver its classes to remote areas of the state. Tom Farer (1985-1986) presented the university community with major changes in administration and resource allocation. Gerald May (1986-1990) served during hard economic times, with little or no money for new initiatives.\n\nRichard Peck (1990-1998) reemphasized the university’s Latin American ties with key initiatives and cooperative agreements with other universities. He also placed a continuing emphasis on the growth of the university research park and on faculty initiatives to garner increased research funds.\n\nWilliam Gordon (1998-2002) was the first UNM faculty member to rise through the ranks, from assistant professor of psychology, to department chairman, Arts and Sciences dean, and provost before being elevated to the presidency. Gordon began the innovative Freshman Learning Centers to both boost enrollment and to retain students through graduation.\n\nF. Chris Garcia (2002-2003), who also rose through the ranks, served as president. He was successful in overseeing legislative initiatives to change the state funding formula for higher education, the first major change in nearly a quarter of a century.\n\nLouis Caldera, eighteenth president, (2003-2006), increased the emphasis on seeking both scholarly and institutional research funding, while building on Gordon’s freshmen initiatives and seeking refinements in the legislative funding formula.\n\nDavid Harris served as acting president (2006-2007).\n\nDavid J. Schmidly (2007-2012) enacted a vision based on four key areas of focus: Student Success, Systemic Excellence, Healthy Communities, and Economic and Community Development.\n\nRobert G. Frank (2012-2017) enacted the UNM2020 strategic plan and rapidly advanced its goals, including record improvements in student retention and graduation. He also championed economic development and initiated InnovateABQ, in partnership with government entities and private enterprise, to advance entrepreneurial success.\n\nChaouki Abdallah served as interim president (2017-2018).\n\nGarnett S. Stokes was appointed president March 1, 2018.\n\nDonald J. Burge\n\nCenter for Southwest Research\n\nThe Environment\n\nAlbuquerque, situated on the banks of the historic Rio Grande, is the home of the main campus of The University of New Mexico. The city is bordered on the east by the 10,000-foot Sandia Mountains and to the west by a high volcanic mesa. With a metro area population approaching 900,000 people, the city is the geographic and demographic center of the state.\n\nThe campus of The University of New Mexico lies one mile above sea level. Albuquerque receives abundant sunshine, with annual rainfall of only about nine inches. While summers are warm, the city’s high elevation and low humidity moderate the temperatures. Winter storms are brief and snow does not linger long in the city, yet accumulations in the nearby mountains make it possible to snow ski in the morning and still play tennis or golf in the afternoon.\n\nThe distinctive architectural style of the campus, contemporary in treatment but strongly influenced by the Hispanic and Pueblo Indian cultures, is characterized by vigas, patios, balconies, portals and earth-colored, slightly inclined walls in the style of ancient adobe houses. Surrounded by giant cottonwoods, elms and mountain evergreens, and with attention paid to beautiful desert landscaping, the UNM campus embodies a lifestyle fostered by the mild, sunny climate.\n\nAlbuquerque is one of the major cultural centers of the Southwest, offering museums, art galleries, theatre and musical groups, symphony orchestras and shops displaying both traditional and contemporary arts and crafts. Ceremonial dances are held at various times during the year in nearby Pueblos and often are open to the public.\n\nFacilities\n\nCenter for the Arts\n\nPopejoy Hall, located on the University of New Mexico campus, serves as New Mexico’s premier performance venue.

The center’s mission is to foster the sustainable and equitable management of transboundary natural resources by engaging in applied scholarship, public policy and planning, preventative diplomacy and conflict resolution, and serving communities. Founded in 2001, the center builds on decades of work by UNM faculty and is the only program of its kind in the region focused on transboundary resources, applied scholarship, and community service. The center focuses its work in four key topical areas: 1) water security, 2) land stewardship and restoration, 3) energy, food, and climate resilience, and 4) transboundary governance and collaborative decision-making. Across these four topical areas the Center carries out its work through: 1) Applied and Multidisciplinary Scholarship: to understand and develop solutions to natural resource challenges through research, educational forums, and cultivating the next generation of natural resource leaders, 2). Public Policy and Planning: by providing impartial information to policy-makers and the public through publications, briefings, testimony, and dialogs, 3) Preventative Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution: to prevent and resolve conflicts through mediation, education, convening of forums, and collaborations, and 4) Serving Communities: by working directly with communities through partnerships, educational outreach, trainings, and workshops.\n\nGraduate Teaching Academy\n\nGraduate Studies, in partnership with the Center for Teaching and Learning, is pleased to offer the Graduate Teaching Academy for all UNM graduate students who are teaching (or planning to teach) college courses. Students in the Academy will acquire teaching techniques and technologies, improve their course design skills, receive technical support, and prepare for careers in college teaching. The Academy is a combination of courses, teaching workshops, and classroom teaching experience in the home department. Those who complete the Academy training will receive a non-transcripted certificate in college teaching, which will enhance their CVs and improve their chances of placement as faculty and lecturers at colleges and universities.\n\nContact information:\n\nphone: (505) 277-8452 email: ahaynie@unm.edu\n\nhttp://grad.unm.edu/resources/gta.html\n\nWelcome Center\n\nThe University of New Mexico Welcome Center, attached to the Cornell Parking Garage adjacent to Johnson Center and the Center for the Arts, invites all campus visitors and prospective and current students to stop by for information, directions and assistance.
