        "text": "(1936–88). U.S. singer, songwriter, and guitarist Roy Orbison is best remembered for his soaring voice and for his carefully crafted ballads of loneliness and heartache. Among his biggest hits were the songs “Only the Lonely,” “Running Scared,” “Crying,” “Dream Baby,” and “Oh, Pretty Woman.” From his earliest days as a Nashville songsmith through his years as an international legend, Orbison crafted songs that made a profound impression on musicians as diverse as Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Bruce Springsteen, Linda Ronstadt, k.d. lang, and Chris Isaak.\n\nOrbison was born on April 23, 1936, in Vernon, Texas, a small town located near the southern Oklahoma border, and grew up in West Texas, where he formed his first musical group at age 13. He dropped out of college to pursue music and, as a member of the Teen-Kings, recorded “Ooby Dooby” in 1955. Orbison later rerecorded the song as a solo artist for Sun Records in Memphis, Tenn., where it became his first hit. The efforts of Sam Phillips, Sun’s legendary founder, to make Orbison a rockabilly star were unsuccessful, however, and the shy Texan moved to Nashville, Tenn., where he concentrated on writing songs for others, notably “Claudette” for the Everly Brothers.\n\nBeginning in 1960, Orbison recorded a series of unforgettable ballads at Monument Records in Nashville. His distinctive vocal style developed against the background of lushly orchestrated, three-minute romances filled with yearning and despair. By the time “Running Scared” (1961) was recorded, Orbison’s artistry was in full flower, capturing a lover’s angst as he frets that his rival will win the heart of his beloved. Over the next several years, Orbison’s star—and his place on the charts—continued to rise. “Only the Lonely” (1960), “Crying” (1961), “It’s Over” (1964), and “Oh, Pretty Woman” (1964) were all hits, and Orbison was one of the few U.S. rockers to maintain a place high on the pop charts during what became known as the British Invasion, the influx of such instantaneously popular British bands as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, and the Kinks into the United States in the mid-1960s.\n\nFollowing a series of personal tragedies and professional setbacks that derailed his career in the mid-1960s, Orbison made a stunning comeback in the late 1980s as the use of his song “In Dreams” in the film Blue Velvet (1986) garnered fresh attention for his work. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and in that same year he joined with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne to form the supergroup Traveling Wilburys. The band’s debut album in 1988 landed Orbison in the Top Ten for the first time since 1964. He also recorded a new solo album, Mystery Girl, his finest work in decades. Tragically, Orbison died of a heart attack on Dec. 6, 1988, in Hendersonville, Tennessee, only a few weeks after the release of the Wilburys’ album. Mystery Girl, released posthumously in 1989, featured the single “You Got It,” which remained in the Top Ten for 18 weeks."
