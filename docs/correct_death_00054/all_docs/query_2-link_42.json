His music was described by critics as operatic, earning him the nicknames \"the Caruso of Rock\" and \"the Big O\". Many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability at a time when most male rock-and-roll performers chose to project defiant masculinity. He was known for his shyness and stage fright, which he countered by wearing dark sunglasses.\n\nOrbison began singing in a rockabilly and country-and-western band at high school. He was signed by Sam Phillips of Sun Records in 1956, but enjoyed his greatest success with Monument Records. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of Orbison's singles reached the Billboard Top 40. He wrote or co-wrote almost all of his own Top 10 hits, including \"Only the Lonely\" , \"Running Scared\" , \"Crying\" , \"In Dreams\" , and \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" . Beginning in the mid-1960s, Orbison suffered a number of personal tragedies and his career faltered.\n\nOrbison experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he co-founded the Traveling Wilburys with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne. Orbison died of a heart attack in December 1988 at age 52. One month later, his song \"You Got It\" was released as a solo single, becoming his first hit to reach the U.S. Top 10 in nearly 25 years.\n\nOrbison's honors include inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1989, and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2014. He received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and five other Grammy Awards. Rolling Stone placed him at number 37 on its list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". In 2002, Billboard magazine listed him at number 74 on its list of the Top 600 recording artists.\n\n.mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul\n\nEarly life\n\nOrbison was born on April 23, 1936 in Vernon, Texas, the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison , an oil well driller and car mechanic, and nurse Nadine Vesta Shults . The family moved to Fort Worth in 1942 to find work in the aircraft factories.\n\nRoy attended Denver Avenue Elementary School until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon, and they moved again to Wink, Texas in 1946. Orbison described life in Wink as \"football, oil fields, oil, grease, and sand\" and expressed relief that he was able to leave the desolate town. All the Orbison children had poor eyesight; Roy used thick corrective lenses from an early age. He was self-conscious about his appearance and began dyeing his nearly-white hair black when he was still young. He was quiet, self-effacing, and remarkably polite and obliging. He was always keen to sing, however. He considered his voice memorable, but not great.\n\nRoy's father gave him a guitar on his sixth birthday. He recalled, \"I was finished, you know, for anything else\" by the time he was 7, and music became the focus of his life. His major musical influence as a youth was country music. He was particularly moved by Lefty Frizzell's singing, with its slurred syllables, and he adopted the name \"Lefty Wilbury\" during his time with the Traveling Wilburys. He also enjoyed Hank Williams, Moon Mullican and Jimmie Rodgers. One of the first musicians that he heard in person was Ernest Tubb, playing on the back of a truck in Fort Worth. In West Texas, he was exposed to rhythm and blues, Tex-Mex, the orchestral arrangements of Mantovani, and Cajun music. The cajun favourite \"Jole Blon\" was one of the first songs that he sang in public. He began singing on a local radio show at age 8, and he became the show's host by the late 1940s.\n\nIn high school, Orbison and some friends formed the band Wink Westerners. They played country standards and Glenn Miller songs at local honky-tonks and had a weekly radio show on KERB in Kermit, Texas. They were offered $400 to play at a dance, and Orbison realised that he could make a living in music. He enrolled at North Texas State College in Denton, planning to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay. He then heard that his schoolmate Pat Boone had signed a record deal, and it further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician. He heard a song called \"Ooby Dooby\" while in college, composed by Dick Penner and Wade Moore, and he returned to Wink with \"Ooby Dooby\" in hand and continued performing with the Wink Westerners after his first year. He then enrolled in Odessa Junior College. Two members of the band quit and two new members were added, and the group won a talent contest and obtained their own television show on KMID-TV in Midland, Texas. The Wink Westerners kept performing on local TV, played dances at the weekends, and attended college during the day.\n\nWhile living in Odessa, Orbison saw a performance by Elvis Presley.Johnny Cash toured the area in 1955 and 1956, appearing on the same local TV show as the Wink Westerners, and he suggested that Orbison approach Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Orbison did so and was told, \"Johnny Cash doesn't run my record company!\" The success of their KMID television show got them another show on KOSA-TV, and they changed their name to the Teen Kings. They recorded \"Ooby Dooby\" in 1956 for the Odessa-based JeâWel label. Record store owner Poppa Holifield played it over the telephone for Sam Phillips, and Phillips offered the Teen Kings a contract.\n\nncG1vNJzZmion6W7oq7LnmWcp51kwrStjpqpraGjqcBwgo9ub3JloqTGbrvRm6Csp55kr6q7xquYqaCpYq6vsIyfmJysow%3D%3D"
