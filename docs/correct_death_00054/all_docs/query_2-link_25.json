        "text": "Roy Kelton Orbison was an American singer and songwriter. Blessed with one of the most distinguished, commanding, flexible, and quirky voices, Orbison is considered one of the most popular rockabilly singers ever. He had a very powerful and romantic voice that left people mesmerized. He belonged to a working class family and scripted his own success story in the music industry. Despite the fact that he faced many obstructions in the beginning, he did not stop making music and singing even for a day. His peculiar three-octave voice, unconventional writing, and looks made him a favorite amongst rockabilly fans. He was also admired by his contemporaries and other great singers; Elvis Presley once called him “the greatest singer in the world.” He is remembered for his romantic song ‘Oh, Pretty Woman,’ which was honored with a ‘Grammy Hall of Fame Award.’ It was also named one of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's ‘500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.’ ‘Rolling Stone’ magazine ranked him 13th on its '100 Greatest Singers of All Time' list. In 1987, he was inducted into the 'Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.' In 2014, he was inducted into the 'Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.'"
