        "text": "Barbara Orbison, the widow and manager of rock n' roll pioneer Roy Orbison, has died of pancreatic cancer aged 61.\n\nA family spokeswoman said she died at a Los Angeles medical centre on Tuesday - the 23rd anniversary of her husband's death.\n\nSince the 1980s, Orbison devoted her time to managing her husband's estate and keeping his legacy alive.\n\nIn January 2010 she also accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on his behalf.\n\nWith her son, Roy Kelton Orbison Jr, she co-produced a four-CD box set of her husband's 107 recordings which was released in 2008.\n\nThe package marked the first all-inclusive body of Roy Orbison's work from his earliest recordings to his last live performance.\n\nRoy Orbison died of a heart attack in 1988 at the age of 52, in the midst of a comeback with supergroup The Traveling Wilburys.\n\nBarbara Orbison was also the head of the Nashville, Tennessee-based music publishing company Still Working Music.\n\nIn 2010 it was awarded BMI's Song of the Year for Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me."
