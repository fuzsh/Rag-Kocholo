        "text": "NOTE: This was the last substantive interview given by Roy Orbison. He played Boston Dec. 2 and 3, 1988 at a now-defunct club called the Channel and outside Cleveland at the Front Row club Dec. 4. Three days later he died from a heart attack Dec.6. at his mother's house in Tennessee.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1964, Roy Orbison put nine songs inside the Billboard Top 10. He was the most popular male singer of the time. Listen to Orbison and you'd hear the swirling string arrangements, the multiple crescendos and, mostly, at the centre of the song, that dramatic bel canto tenor, often expressing a dreamy kind of heartbreak or loneliness.\n\nConsider Only the Lonely, Running Scared, Crying and It's Over, all of them intimate expressions magnified, looming large. Now, some 24 years after Orbison's last Top 10 hit – several lifetimes in pop-music terms – Orbison is back in the Top 10, this time on the album chart.\n\nOrbison's not performing alone, though. He's one of the Traveling Wilburys – the others include Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, George Harrison and Jeff Lynne – and their album, Traveling Wilburys: Volume One is No. 9 on the Billboard chart. The first single, the modest, melodic Handle With Care, is climbing.\n\nEven if you never heard of the Wilburys, when Orbison enters Handle with Care, there's no mistaking the voice and the sentiment: \"I'm so tired of being lonely/I've still got some love to give.\" If there was one line for him to sing...\n\n\"…that's gotta be it,\" Orbison says, finishing the thought. \"I felt it was pretty typical of what I should be singing.\"\n\nReading on mobile?

Is he really the lonely guy's Lonely Guy?\n\n\"It's just the kind of guy that comes out sometimes when I write,\" Orbison says, on the phone from France. \"Probably it's one side of my personality coming through. I read a lot into what I write and it's mostly feelings. There's some happy ones, too. On the new album there are a couple of occasions where I'm in good shape.\"\n\nOrbison has been on a roll for the past couple of years. There was his election to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the prominent (and eerie) use of his songs, In Dreams, in the hit movie Blue Velvet, an HBO special with Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello and other famous friends called Black & White Night, the Traveling Wilburys, and the new album, to be called Mystery Girl, recorded with U2's Bono, T-Bone Burnett, Jeff Lynne and others. Roy Orbison, at 52, is a very happy, very humble man. \"My voice is a gift,\" he says. \"My talent is a gift; the life process is a gift; the opportunity for the journey is a gift.\"\n\nThe journey has certainly had its low points. Orbison's career took a dive with the mid-'60s British invasion, and although he remained a steady concert draw, until recently, he'd never regained his hit-making capacity. Personal tragedy also struck: his first wife, Claudette, died in a motorcycle accident in 1966; two of his sons died when his house caught fire in 1968. \"You set out to whip the world,\" says Orbison. \"And then when you get beat up a little bit… In my case, you say, 'Father, I'm gonna let you have it. I've done what I can do.' You turn your will over to God.\"\n\nReading on mobile? Click here to watch\n\nOrbison names two key turning points for him, one deeply personal, the other professional. The personal one, which happened about three years ago, was a born-again Christian experience, though Orbison dislikes the born-again term because it's misused and overused. \"I've been developing a personal relationship with myself and with Jesus Christ and it just kind of smooths everything,\" he says. \"If you have faith, then your whole life is put in a new perspective. You get to work, but enjoy the work at the same time. If you grow spiritually, you do what's in front of you and let the results speak for themselves.\"\n\nProfessionally, Orbison had a revelation about six years ago. He was playing a date in Canada. As he approached the venue, he took a look at the marquee. It read: \"Roy Orbison – Sold Out.\" A lightning bolt struck. \"What I realised all of a sudden,\" he says, \"was most people came to hear me. They knew I was gonna sing anyway and they appreciated me before I even walked on. I think everyone needs to grow a little bit and work on themselves, and that was one of the things. You don't need to be so insecure that it's going to affect your performance. It just dawned on me that there was a little bit of love there to start with. So, I just relaxed and everything started turning around.\"\n\nThroughout the years, Orbison has been one of the best bets in live performance. His voice is remarkably untarnished by time. His songs, most of which he wrote, don't seem like relics of another age; rather, they seem like timeless, deep emotions. \"To be a songwriter-singer,\" he says, \"means the songs come from deep within and you treat them as an artist, with that much respect. I couldn't hardly cheat myself.\"\n\nReading on mobile? Click here to watch\n\nYet, Orbison is poised at a period of transition, where he's looking to let go of some of his past. Orbison has his first record of new material since 1979 waiting in the wings. \"This is the first time in a long time that I feel the old phasing into the new,\" says Orbison. \"I never felt like the older songs were in the past; they were always very current to me. Now, I feel like the new material needs to be done. I think everybody's going to like this album; it's got a lot of heart and soul.\"\n\nOrbison won't be breaking in the record all at once, however. His band has not fully rehearsed the new songs, and Orbison feels it's improper to foist too much unknown material on audiences. So this weekend he says he may play a couple of new songs; on his next tour, many more.\n\nOf the new material: Can we expect a lonely Orbison?\n\n\"It's still matters of the heart,\" he says. \"There's some up things, but there's still a little frustration there.\"\n\nAnd there's a chuckle following that statement."
