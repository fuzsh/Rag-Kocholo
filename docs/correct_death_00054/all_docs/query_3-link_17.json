        "text": "Singer of Oh, Pretty Woman - the soundtrack to the iconic 1990s film - musician Rob Orbison died at too young of an age, two years before the movie was released.\n\nBy Chanel Georgina, Senior Reporter\n\nLink copied Bookmark\n\nOH, PRETTY WOMEN - ROY ORBISON\n\nThe Texan star performed hits such as Only The Lonely, California Blue, and End Of The Line. Characteristically dressed in black and dark shades, Roy was one of the founding fathers of rock 'n' roll. Yet, in December 1988, The Caruso of Rock (as he was nicknamed) died at the age of 52.\n\nThe American artist had died from a heart attack while visiting his elderly mother, The New York Times reported.\n\nTaken by ambulance to Hendersonville Hospital on December 6, 1988, Roy could not be revived and passed away just before midnight.\n\nNine years prior, The Big O – another moniker due to his operatic sound – had open-heart surgery in 1979.\n\nTo be specific, Roy had triple bypass surgery, which cardiologist Dr Jeffrey Lander verified is the \"most common type of heart surgery for adults\".\n\nREAD MORE: Supplements linked to ‘potentially deadly’ rhabdomyolysis\n\nOtherwise known as a coronary artery bypass graft, the procedure involves utilising three blood vessels elsewhere in the body to bypass damaged vessels to the heart.\n\nThe blood vessels that are used for the graft can be taken from the leg, inside the chest, or the arm.\n\nSuch an operation is done to improve blood flow to the heart muscle, which has been restricted due to coronary heart disease.\n\nCoronary artery disease occurs when fatty material builds up in the arteries, thereby restricting blood flow.\n\nDON’T MISS:\n\nWhile triple bypass surgery fixes the current problem, it does not prevent a future build-up of plaque in the arteries.\n\nFactors that contribute to plaque build-up in the arteries include:\n\nSmoking\n\nHigh-fat diet\n\nObesity\n\nAlcohol\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nHigh cholesterol\n\nDiabetes\n\nIncreasing age.\n\nDr Lander confirmed \"significant lifestyle changes\" are required post surgery in order to prevent further complications.\n\nModifications include:\n\nA healthy diet, including a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids and low in saturated and trans fats\n\nSmoking cessation\n\nA healthy lifestyle\n\nReduce stress, anxiety, and depression\n\nControl high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n\nREAD MORE: Popular soup may interact dangerously with lipid-lowering drugs\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
