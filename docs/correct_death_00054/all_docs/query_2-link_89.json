        "text": "ROY ORBISON\n\nRoy Kelton Orbison\n\nBorn April 23, 1936\n\nVernon, Texas, U.S.\n\nDied December 6, 1988 (aged 52)\n\nHendersonville, Tennessee\n\nHe was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\nThis picture was taken with a polaroid camera around 1960, when I was about 21 and Roy was around 24 years old, in the Gator Bowl football stadium. The stadium is now the Alltel Stadium, home of the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was doing a show that night with a big group of entertainers. At that time I was playing in a local band and knew many of the promoters so I was able to get into the dressing room to meet Roy. A friend of mine snapped the picture right after Roy took his glasses off and held them behind my back for the picture.\n\nI have met several celebrities in my 66 years of existence but this picture is one of my most prized possessions. I thought this photo may be unusual because I don't recall seeing Roy without his glasses at this age.\n\nThis picture is a \"treasure\" to me and I hope it can be preserved and enjoyed by others in the future. I put both our names on this photo. I also have this without our names. You, and/or any other interested party, have my permission to use this photo in any way that would promote Roy Orbison's image in a positive or favorable manner, without further permission from me.\n\n- David Coffield, Jacksonville, Florida, May 14, 2005\"\n\nRoy Orbison is remembered by the town of Wink Texas by hosting a festival in his honor annually. The town boasts a museum which houses memorabilla from his career and life in Wink.\n\nHe was the son of Orbie Lee and Nadine Orbison. He grew up in Wink, a small West Texas oil town, where his father taught him to play the guitar at age six. By the age of seven Roy decided he would like to be a singer. Orbison dedicated himself to music as a young man, performing at school and on the radio. While attending Wink High School he formedHe was the son of Orbie Lee and Nadine Orbison. He grew up in Wink, a small West Texas oil town, where his father taught him to play the guitar at age six. Orbison dedicated himself to music as a young man, performing at school and on the radio. While attending Wink High School he formed a country music group called the Wink Westerners, which featured Orbison as lead singer and guitar player. During his college days where he attended North State, with musican Pat Boone, Orbison transformed the Wink Westerners into his first rock-and-roll band, the Teen Kings.\n\nAfter two years of college he dropped out. The group played throughout West Texas and on a number of television shows and recorded \"Ooby Dooby,\" which brought him to the attention of the Sun record label in Memphis. Orbison rerecorded \"Ooby Dooby\" for Sun, and in 1956 it became his first chart hit. It was made in the pioneering rock-and-roll style known as rockabilly, a frantic mixture of country music and rhythm-and-blues developed by Elvis Presley and Sun label owner Sam Phillips. Unlike Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis, up-and-coming music stars who were also recording rockabilly on the Sun label, Orbison had little chart success. The Teen Kings dissolved, and Orbison left Sun. In 1959 Orbison joined the small Monument label in Nashville, which resulted in a string of international hit records from 1960 to 1966, including such classic rock-and-roll melodramas as \"Only the Lonely\" (1960), \"Blue Angel\" (1960), \"Running Scared\" (1961), \"Blue Bayou\" (1963), \"It's Over\" (1964), and \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (1964). Elvis Presley once referred to Orbison as \"the greatest singer in the world. It was during this era of his life that he married Claudette Frady . They would have two sons named \"Most of his early success was as a songwriter. \"Claudette,\" a song written by Orbison and named after his first wife, Claudette Frady, was a hit in 1958 for the country and rockabilly duo the Everly Brothers. It was during this era of his life that he married Claudette Frady .\n\nIn 1963, Roy headlined a concert in England with an opening act made up of four of his biggest young fans, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Now known to the world as the Beatles. This group of young performers were in awe of him performing with out moving anything but his mouth to perform and having the fans go wild.\n\nAt the height of his fame on June 6, 1966, Roy's wife, Claudette, died in a motorcycle accident. Two years later, the family home at Old Hickory Lake in Hendersonville, Tennessee burned to the ground while Roy was touring in England, Anthony and Roy Jr., died in the fire. The youngest boy, Wesley, at the time only three, was saved by Roy's parents. These events affected him profoundly but after a few years he would continue to play to loyal audiences all across the globe. He married his second wife, Barbara Ann Marie Wellonen Jakobs, in May of 1969, and they had two more sons, Roy Jr, and Alex. Tragedy would strike again, when, in 1973, Orbison's elder brother Grady Lee Orbison, died in a motor vehicle accident in Henderson, Tennessee when on his way to visit Roy for Thanksgiving.\n\nIn 1979, Orbison had heart surgery in Tennessee. He went on to recorded a duet, \"That Loving You Feeling Again,\" with Emylou Harris, which won a Grammy. In 1987, the movie \"Blue Velvet\" included his hit, \"In Dreams,\" on its soundtrack. That same year, Roy was also inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. The next year, he taped a television tribute to his music, performing with many his fellow rock legends and fans. He also released an album, The Traveling Wilburys, Volume One, with Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne, which became a top ten hit.\n\nIt was during this renewed success and interest in his talent that Orbison died of a heart attack the night of December 6, 1988 at the age of 52. Orbison's first wife and two sons are buried in Tennessee in Woodlawn Memorial Park Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n* Claudette Frady-Orbison (1941-1966)\n\n* Roy Dewayne Orbison (1958-1968)\n\n* Anthony King Orbison (1962-1968)"
