        "text": "Who doesn’t love Roy Orbison’s Pretty Woman? The first few bars of the song, a hit in 1964, defined my young adolescence. And the Traveling Wilburys were a particular favorite of mine–but they shouldn’t be a footnote in this post, they deserve a post of their own\n\nA few weeks ago I bought tickets to something called Roy Orbison Returns and I have to admit with great embarrassment that I thought we would be seeing Roy. Because I forgot he died in 1988. Doesn’t that just define the state of our generation? Getting so old that we can’t remember which famous persons have died and which are still with us?\n\nSome enterprising web entrepreneur should come up with a website called “Is he dead or is it just me?” Sort of like Is it down right now, which I use from time to time when I can’t connect to a website. Yeah, someone should do that–why shouldn’t the internet’s uber-memory be used to help our generation’s quickly depleting brain cells?\n\n“Umm…honey?” my husband said, gently. “He’s dead. This is a tribute band.”\n\nAs Emily Litella would say, “Never mind!” (Yes, Gilda Radner is dead. Ovarian cancer. Long time now. I do remember that.)\n\nThe concert would feature Wiley Ray and the Big O band. Definitely NOT Roy Orbison back from the dead.\n\nWe bought the tickets anyway.\n\nThe night of the concert we took light rail downtown, where we ran into two very distinct groups: young people in their teens and 20s dressed as comic characters and 60- and 70-somethings with grey hair and slow strides. Guess which group was going to the tribute concert. (That was not a question.)\n\n“Do you recognize our people?” hubby said, rubbing it in.\n\n“Yeah, but I’m not the one who qualified for a senior rail ticket tonight,” I replied. I’ll take my (relative) youth while I can .\n\nAll 523 of the theatre’s seats were filled with…senior citizens. More grey hair than a senior center. I didn’t see anyone significantly younger than I.\n\nAnd then Wiley took the stage as Roy Orbison.\n\nWiley had the high notes, but to be honest, he was no Roy Orbison. And he wore one gnarly-bad wig, probably made in China. Most distracting, though, was that he was pretending to play the electric guitar. About halfway through the concert I noticed he wasn’t really playing, despite the colorful (fake) electrical cord. Then, I couldn’t STOP noticing. How was he fingering the frets? How was he strumming?\n\nWe could barely hear the two long-haired blonde back-up singers. I thought they looked like eastern European hookers and when they were introduced, one was named Marushka. So maybe they were.\n\nI couldn’t get a clear shot of the drummer, but he could’ve played for Metallica–he waved his head and sticks like a big-hair band drummer. And had the hair. You can just make him out in the photo below. But the guy I was riveted to was the keyboardist. That guy is so skinny he makes Ginger Baker look fat. (If you don’t know who Ginger Baker is, he is the notorious speed freak who was with Cream, among others. He’s still alive, go figure, and there’s a hilarious documentary on him, called Beware of Mr. Baker. Don’t miss it.)\n\nAnyway, the keyboardist is this thin:\n\nLook more closely at those legs. A skeleton in a suit, but played a mean keyboard.\n\nThere were two real guitarists. You know, the kind that actually play. One was totally my type, but his expression suggested he’d probably done the purple acid at Woodstock. Here’s the other guitarist:\n\n“Doesn’t he look like a long-haired John Kerry?” my husband whispered. Yes. Yes, he did.\n\nThe concert began with a short, maudlin dramatic performance in which Roy (Wiley) talks to his dead wife, Claudette. Something along the lines of, “Honey,where are you? I need to hear your voice. There was a fire at the house. I was out on tour. Our two little boys are gone. I wasn’t there to protect them. Are they there with you?” It sounded like Miss Molly’s kindergarten play and was performed as badly.\n\n{This was a very sad story, though. Claudette died in a motorcycle accident in 1966. Out riding with Roy, she was hit by a semi and died. Two years later, his two eldest boys died in a fire.}\n\nBack to the play. After he pleaded with Claudette via Afterlife Telephone, one of the eastern European hookers–I mean backup singers– sneaked off stage (I noticed) and shortly thereafter, we heard Claudette respond from the afterlife (off-stage) in a maudlin little soliloquy.\n\nIt was painful. Thankfully, this was the last theatrical performance in the concert.\n\nAs the music of our youth played I looked around at all the silver hair and greybeards and wondered how we got this old. My inner self could just as easily be sitting at Syracuse University’s Jabberwocky listening to James Taylor play, as I did when I was 18 in 1969, the year my husband and I met at college. I feel no older. No different.\n\nI looked over at him and I could still see the 21-year-old frat boy I met all those years ago. He was still there, inside.\n\nAnd yet, we’ve all been through so much. The world kept spinning and spinning, time passed. We’re still here, though, and that’s something.\n\nThe concert ended. The audience managed to get up –some with difficulty — and give the band a standing ovation they didn’t deserve. Then, we filed out, careful to let those with walkers and canes go ahead of us. We aren’t at that point quite yet. I won’t even bother to describe our light rail journey home, during which my husband got off at the wrong stop, stranding us for a bit in a deserted and dangerous part of downtown. No, I’ll skip that part.\n\nHere’s the real Roy Orbison, doing his hit in 1987, a year before his fatal heart attack. (There’s a second vid, too.)\n\nHere’s a song Roy wrote for Elvis, hoping it would hit #1. Elvis heard it and told Roy to record it–Blue Angel. It’s one of my favorites and I can’t seen Elvis doing it. Well, maybe."
