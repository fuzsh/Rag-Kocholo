        "text": "At this time, he was part of the supergroup the Travelling Wilburys along with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, George Harrison and Jeff Lynne.\n\nHe was planning to fly to London for this reason, to work with them, but spend the day of December 6 with his two sons and mother.\n\nHowever, he had complained of chest pains and at about 11pm, he collapsed in the bathroom.\n\nParamedics rushed to bring him to hospital, but he was declared dead by midnight.\n\nHe soon morphed into an act very different from himself, as he was expected to be an elusive, almost Johnny Cash-like character.\n\nAt one point, he started wearing sunglasses rather than his real ones after leaving his at home before a show, which helped create this darker image.\n\nSoon this image was to fit some terrible tragedy in his life when three of his close family died.\n\nFirst was his wife, Claudette, with whom he had been having some marital difficulties."
