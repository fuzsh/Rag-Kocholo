        "meta_description": "Featherstone Massacre by Lewis Burner, released 07 September 2023\n\nFEATHERSTONE MASSACRE\nIn Featherstone, West Yorkshire, where the coal came out the ground \nA massacre was committed, by foot soldiers of the Crown\nBut the hardship and the hunger, was plain for all to see\nLong before that evening, in 1893. \nThe lockout across the county meant no union man could earn \nAs they bosses slashed their wages, the pit wheels did not turn \nBut scabs loaded up coal wagons, bound for Bradford town\nAnd word of this betrayal quickly made the rounds. \nAnd on it seems they’d crush us down, as men of little worth, \nAs if we were not fit to live, and had no right on earth. \nThat summer afternoon, of September ‘93\nThe miners did assemble at Ackton colliery \nThey asked the man in charge, known as Holiday \nHow he could hire scab workers whilst in dispute of pay.\nHe called upon the army to clear these men away\n28 foot soldiers arrived late in the day \nLed by Captain Barker, the order was made plain \nFire upon these miners, we care not if we maim. \nThe bullets hit the crowd and two young men’s lives were lost \nBecause the bosses protect profits at any bloody cost \nBy the barrels of their rifles they took our brothers down \nThese murders were committed by foot soldiers of the crown. \nThe town banded together, to grieve the murdered men \nAnd swore they would remember and always honour them \nSo to Duggan and to Gibbs, your death was not in vain\nThis spirit of this township forever changed that day. \nAnd on it seems that they’d crush us down, as men of little worth, \nBut it&#39;s them who are not fit to rule, and had no right on earth.",
