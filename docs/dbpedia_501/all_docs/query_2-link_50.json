        "text": "Streets smeared with dog faeces and litter, and overrun with collapsing drug users - this is how residents living in what they call the 'UK's grimmest village' describe their life.\n\nLocals in Featherstone, in south Staffordshire, claim their area is rife with anti-social behaviour, leaving them too scared to walk their dogs at night. The village is surrounded by three prisons, but residents say inmates are better off inside than out.\n\nMultiple buildings stand derelict, with houses left to crumble - just one semi-detached house on Cannock Road appears to have been cut clean in half with the upstairs bedroom at the mercy of the weather. While the village's historic pub, the Red, White and Blue, was closed and remains bordered with smashed windows and surrounded by security fences.\n\nA newly built bus shelter was recently set on fire, while residents complain of increasing numbers of potholes appearing on the roads. The alarming number of alcoholics and drug users collapsing in the street is worrying locals, who complain that the situation is only getting worse.\n\nLife-long resident Dean Proffitt, 62, said: \"I often say that this would be a nice place to live if it wasn't for the drunks and the smack heads. They are everywhere and it's upsetting to see.\n\n\"I've lived here on and off for years and it's certainly got worse. There's rubbish everywhere and people spewing up everywhere. There's no point telling the police because they won't do anything about it.\"\n\nRachel Canning, 51, blames the council for failing to keep the village clean. She said: \"It doesn't look as if the council come out enough to cut the grassed areas anymore, clean up the litter or empty the dog mess bins. The dog bins are full up and there is dog poo all over the village.\n\n\"I don't know if they are people coming into the village or people who live here who have just given up. You'll go into the next village Shareshill and it's beautiful. It's looked after, it's a shame ours isn't.\n\n\"The state of our village is awful, there's drug abuse, people picking up and selling drugs. It's atrocious. I understand it happens everywhere but it's really bad here. You're frightened to walk your dog at night.\n\n\"We had our van stolen off our drive. There are constant break-ins and always people checking doors and car handles but the police are not interested.\" Dave Bethell, 74, said: \"For a start the pub's closed so we don't have a pub in the village. I've heard the council is going to knock it down and build another supermarket. There's drugs everywhere.\"\n\nPensioner Alex Tenn, 73, claimed there was supposed to be a bypass built, but it never was. \"As a result big lorries come down past people's houses causing constant noise. It's stressful for people,\" he explained.\n\nAnother resident, who regrets their recent move, said: \"On the whole, the people are friendly but the place looks and feels really down. It needs a good clear out. Outside my house is a car bonnet and bumper which have been there for three weeks now.\n\n\"It was just left there on the path and no one's moved it. I moved here from Nottingham last November but I wish I'd never moved here. It just seems unloved, people aren't taking a pride in the area. The only reason I wanted to move here was because I thought Featherstone was a nice name for a place but I couldn't have been more wrong.\"\n\nHowever, Shopworker Thomas Rowe, 30, said that while the area may be run down, on the plus side the residents are all 'decent' people who hope to return the village to the 'close-knit community' it once was.\n\n\"It's a bit of a joke among the locals that the inmates in the prisons nearby are luckier than us. When they look out of their barred windows they probably feel quite sorry for us because our lives are worse than theirs,\" he said.\n\n\"Featherstone is not just a dump, it's died on it's a*se. I think that's why people are depressed because the majority of people here are decent folk. It's just so sad to see the village turning into a druggie s***hole before your eyes when it always used to be a close-knit community.\"\n\nDespite having a population of more than 4,000, Featherstone is still known as a village, although it officially has been named a town. In the 1920s a new mine was opened which saw the population rise from just 39 residents to more than 3,000 a few years later.\n\nSince January this year, there have been 39 violent and sexual offences, 13 vehicle crimes, six thefts and five case of criminal damage and arson.\n\nResponding to the claims from residents, South Staffordshire Council said: \"We have been advised the pub has recently been sold and we are hopeful that it will have a new active use shortly. The road and pavement will be resurfaced as part of the new housing development and planning conditions on site.\"\n\nIn regards to fly tipping, a spokesman said: \"The incidents identified are on private land, which the district council does not have jurisdiction over,\" and regarding overflowing bins, they added: \"The teams are regularly out emptying bins, no issues have been reported of overflowing bins, however this will be checked.\"\n\n\"CCTV and a community protection order have been put in place, and we have seen a reduction in anti-social behaviour and crime.\""
