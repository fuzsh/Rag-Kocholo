        "text": "Provided by Prince William County Schools (PWCS)\n\nFeatherstone Elementary School teachers and staff recently invited parents of special education students to a Saturday morning breakfast and training with math aids. Special education students who have math aids listed in their Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) are allowed to use them during class, and on tests, including the Virginia State Standards of Learning (SOL) tests.\n\nParents and students rotated in small groups to each of five stations that were led by teachers and specialists. Parents learned how each math aid is used during instruction. Fifteen to 20-minutes were spent at each station, which shared math aids for the open number line in adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing; using manipulatives to figure out elapsed time; using place value blocks to add and subtract decimals; singing the 100s chart to add and subtract; and using fraction manipulatives to add, subtract and compare fractions.\n\n“We know our parents want to help their students at home, but they don’t always know how to do it in a way that doesn’t conflict with the way we teach in school,” said Andrea ‘Andi’ Castro, third/fourth-grade teacher. “Our parents have a lot to offer. We need to give them the tools and guidance to empower them to be able to help their children at home.”\n\nParents were given a ‘take home math bag’ with copies of the aids so that they could continuing helping their student at home\n\nParents and teachers were overwhelmingly pleased with the success of the event. Featherstone Elementary hopes to host another math aid event before the SOL tests which are scheduled for May.\n\nThe team of teachers and specialists who coordinated this unique opportunity also included third-grade teacher Danielle Epolito, fourth-grade teachers Kim Shifflett and Valerie Sparzak, fifth-grade teachers Jake Williams and Becky Anderson, along with special education teachers Sean Sullivan, Will Fulton and Mobeena Murad, title-one math teacher Theresa Dawkins-Smith and English of Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) teacher Jessica Guerrero."
