        "text": "The Feather River flows from the northern end of Sierra Valley in southeastern Plumas County, and consists of three branches. As the Sierra Nevada’s largest and northernmost river, it flows 185 miles from its headwaters to the Sacramento River.\n\n78 miles of the Middle Fork of the Feather River (above Oroville Reservoir) is listed as a National Wild and Scenic River, with different sections classified as wild, scenic, and recreational. The Middle Fork also has a 111-mile dam-free river reach, from the source of headwaters to Oroville Reservoir. Popular for fishing Steelhead, Chinook salmon, catfish, shad, and bass, the river offers an excellent Class I-II, 94-mile canoe trip from Oroville to the American River confluence in Sacramento.\n\nThe 3,200 square mile watershed is comprised of 65% public land, managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The watershed hosts camping and swimming opportunities, riverfront oak savanna, and riparian forests. The watershed is also home to Feather River stonecrop, an endemic plant that grows along the slopes of the river in Plumas and Butte counties."
