        "text": "Our family’s vacation this summer was a five-day explore of western Nebraska, our family’s new home state.\n\nWe swung around the north edge to see a waterfall on the Niobrara River. We were told to check out Fort Robinson, and had the treat of going on a horseback trail ride with only us four and the guide. And we made sure to see the iconic geological landmarks of the Monument and Chimney Rock.\n\nBut the most memorable story was made on the day we stopped by Chadron State Park. This story continues to remind us of God’s love and care for us!\n\nContinue reading “God Sees You (or lost & found)” →\n\nWe spent our Spring Break in Saint George, Utah, with family and revisiting favorite places from when we lived there a few years ago. While we drove there we had fun listing the places we wanted to return to: our favorite Chinese restaurant, Fizz (a soda shop – a popular thing in Utah!), a park near our old house, and a hike in Snow Canyon.\n\nContinue reading “Just the Next Step” →\n\nWe barely embarked on our Spring Break journey from Nebraska to southern Utah when a red warning light came on our car.

But this time it’s completely different…\n\nContinue reading “Working Together for Good” →\n\nHave you ever tasted perfectly ripe wild blackberries, just picked from the vine?\n\nTheir sweetness and flavor are unrivaled by anything in the grocery store. Holding this basketful encouraged me, as God can grow sweet fruit among thorny vines along cement paths. He is growing good things in unexpected places of our lives!\n\nContinue reading “Hidden Bounty” →"
