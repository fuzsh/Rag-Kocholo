Chris has also taught at the LSE in the Department of Government, Department of International Relations, and the European Institute.\n\nChris holds a PhD from the Department of Political Science and International Studies at the University of Birmingham. His thesis used Foreign Policy Analysis models to explain the US and UK decision-making processes that led to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and Chris is currently developing a book proposal based on his doctoral research.\n\nResearch\n\nOverview\n\nChrisâs current research includes a paper examining the Trump Administrationâs foreign policy legacy, positioning this legacy in relation to his predecessors in the White House. He is also developing a project examining President Bushâs leadership style in the deployment of the cyberweapon âStuxnetâ against the Iranian nuclear programme. He also has a book proposal under review with Manchester University Press.\n\nChris has an overarching focus on the role of individuals in foreign policy, examining how individuals influence foreign policy-making and the conduct of foreign policy. From this, he has an interest in Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA), and has recently published a chapter on FPA scholarship in the Global South."
