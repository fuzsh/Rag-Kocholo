Jolene, her menagerie, and a few of her men are off to Ireland as she believes it - or Faerie as everyone else knows it. Although two of her men remain figuring out their own paths. In Fae the aim is to determine Wolfie’s father as it appears he may be crucial player. However, as they travel through each court it becomes more and more obvious that there is something bigger at play in the world - it’s determined to cause danger and stir up trouble! It doesn’t help that each court is determined to test Jolene and her men in various ways, and they certainly are tested in a variety of aspects 😣 Her poor men are having a conniption though as not only are they having to manage their way through the Courts, they’re having to maintain this is all human and explain away the paranormal as Jolene is none the wiser 😅 little do they realise she might be more in tune with what’s round her and is happening than she let’s on! It all culminates at the Court of the Reaping and an epic battle where some questions may be answered and yet more arise 😲 it felt a little slow at times in terms of pace and flow but an interesting plot overall to keep you reading.\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\nThe Misfit Protection Program is everything. It's one of those series that I live for, just wait to immerse myself in the next book and revel in the delight of it. Of course, Revealed in the Hollow was freaking glorious. I can't even!\n\nJolene's parts are the best, the woman is funny, powerful, and confident, and she's a total badass, that has never been clearer than now. I loved seeing how she handled all these weird situations that the group kept finding themselves in, Jolene adapted and then came out on top like a boss. Benjy is so cute, he fits right in and I love that he found his place. The group dynamic is changing, they're all in with each other, I loved seeing the precious moments between them. However, the group isn't complete yet, I can't wait until they all come together.\n\nDid they say into the Fae or into the fray? Okay, that didn't work as well as I wanted but I had to say it, haha. Revealed in the Hollow had my favorite oddballs finding adventure, danger, and intrigue in the Fae realm. I love the fae and Cass's take on them was interesting. Not only are we exploring another realm, but Jolene and her harem are trying to solve several mysteries at once while working around the most ridiculous restrictions. I finally got some clarity about how the Society works and more about other behind-the-scenes stuff so that was great. As for the rest, I didn't know where the story was headed but I had a fun time getting there. This is still one of the funniest series I've ever read.\n\nOMG, that ending! It was so unexpected. Cass walked us right up to that cliff then shoved us right off of it. I'm gonna be free-falling until the next book, it's going to be torture. Revenge in the Hollow can't come soon enough.\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\nI voluntarily reviewed a copy of \"REVEALED IN THE HOLLOW\" I can't get enough of this series each story pulls you right in to all the secrets, mystery, danger, steam, frustration, emotional turmoil, danger, action, twusts that keeps you glued to your seat till finished.\n\nJolene is upset her friends & lovers are jerping secrets from her in hospital healing from her injuries she doesn't want any of them to visit her her friend Julia trys to explain to her why they had to hide the truth from her but Jolene wasn't ready to accept that, she heads home alone with her animals.\n\nTeddie, Wolfie, Presley, Benji, Saoirse head to Doyle's place to try to figure out how to get Jolene to forgive them for keeping things from her they can't reveal, Seer tells them she was hypnotized by a mysterious woman in London & since them shes much less willing to let people treat her the way they use to.\n\nJolene & the guys have to travel to Faerie looking for answers as to who Wolfie's father is, going to the various courts treated strangely by the Fae, she's been warned not ask certain questions, wearing her magical glasses hides alot from her such as Wolfie's wings hes part Fae when they arrive where lived his wings appear worried she'll see them.\n\nI definitely recommend to get this book Jolene & her guys are becoming closer on this journey to her & each other, they experience different behaviors from the Fae in each court, also some of her abilities are starting to emerge.\n\nI'm so looking forward to \"HOME TO THE HOLLOW\" next to see what's in store for everyone & finally find out what Jolene truly is.\n\nAWESOME ADVENTUROUS STEAMY ADVENTURE I LOVED IT 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖤\n\nFebruary 4, 2024\n\nI have been looking forward to this for ages, and it was so worth the wait!\n\nSo, to recap, Jolene, our FMC, is an unemerged Supe, who has accumulated a harem of 7 guys, plus various animal companions. At the end of the last book, two of them men went off to investigate a murder, while Jolene, the rest of the guys and their menagerie headed to Ireland, to try and track down Wolfie's mysterious pa. Oh, but because Jolene's unemerged, they guys aren't allowed to tell her what's really going on!\n\nThe conversations they have are fun, as the guys are having to keep secrets, although they've told her they are but will tell her when the time is right. But! Not all is as it seems, and she's starting to figure it out!\n\nNot all books work with such a large harem. When done poorly, it can be hard to keep track of who's who. This series DOES work Each of the guys is unique and well developed, as are their relationships with both Jolene and each other. Since the book is told from alternating POVs, it helps that each of them have such distinct ways of talking, and also unique nicknames for Jolene that help you keep track of who's talking,\n\nMost of the book is spent exploring the different worlds in Faerie. Each one again is well developed as it's unique place, and the politics make for a fascinating world overall. You're never sure exactly who can be trusted. I love the conflict between what Jolene should see, can see and can be told about.\n\nLoved it, and can't wait for the next one!\n\nFebruary 14, 2024\n\nIt's been a while since the last book so the author started the book with a recap on the story so far which was very much appreciated. However it is a recap so you do really need to read the previous books first if you haven't already done so. Don't just rely on the recap as you will have missed so much!\n\nI am so totally into this series, told in multiple points of view you get to know all the characters, their mindsets and how they feel about each other. Jolene and five of her men travel to faerie to try to find out information about Wolfie's father and this journey is what this book mainly focused on. There were some other chapters with the other two men but they were largely absent during this part of the story as they were focused on searching for other information and not in faerie with the others. Jolene is at last emerging and although we are not sure what she is yet, there are some clues pointing to something very powerful.\n\nI loved reading about the four different courts in this book but it seems they all have secrets and although friendly on the surface there is definitely something sinister beneath the surface in all of them. The cliffhanger isn't something I was expecting, I mean I was half expecting a cliffhanger but the details surrounding it, no didn't see that coming. Completely loved this and can't wait to see where the author takes us next in this extraordinary story\n\nJanuary 28, 2024\n\nOh boy, I already loved this series and its characters, but my love only grows bigger with every new book that's being released. \"Revealed in the Hollow\" brings Jolene and her group of guys to faerie and once again this author blew me away with her creativity in constructing an amazing land of the fae. It was so awesome, at times my mind took distance of the story wondering about the wonderful and crazy place Cassandra's mind must be...\n\nThis book changed me into one of those fans at a boyband or rockband concert. You know the ones; they are so overwhelmed by what they saw they can only say OMG about a hundred times in a row and seem to have lost about fifty percent of their brain capacity. That's me right now, so it explains why my review might be a little all over the place... But yeah, I absolutely loved this book, and it made me question why I haven't reread the previous books yet because something tells me a reread would help me discover new things I missed the first time.\n\nI do believe I have to warn people who read reverse harem for the big amount of spicy scenes, because that's not where to focus was in this book. I don't mind, I actually love plotdriven series with lots of awesome worldbuilding, but it might be wise to know this before diving in. I absolutely can't wait for the next book in this series!\n\nFebruary 1, 2024\n\nRevealed In The Hollow is the third book in the Misfit Protection series by Cassandra Featherstone.\n\n💜 sassy, smart FMC\n\n💜 why choose\n\n💜 mysteries (so. many. mysteries)\n\n💜 new kingdoms to explore\n\n💜 🌶🌶🌶🌶spicy spice\n\nJolene knows that her guys are hiding things from her. They assure her that they are sworn to secrecy on some topics and as soon as they can, they will fill her in. In the mean time, her patience is running thin. After the not great meeting with Wolfie’s mother, she’s not looking forward to the reunion he will have with his father, once they find him. Plus, the strange new places they have to visit and people they have to be careful around. All of this tiptoeing is not in her wheelhouse and her control is starting to fray. Will they find Wolfie’s father? Will they be safe traveling? Will her men be safe traveling? Will she ever figure out their secrets? What about her two men not with them? Will they be safe?\n\nThis was such a great continuation of Jolene’s story. The banter is grade A quality throughout the book. And even though Jolene has to play the game, she doesn’t loose her snark or her willingness to fight with her men. The storyline and character arcs are so well written. My only complaint is that this book is over and I have to wait until the next one comes out to see what happens next after that cliffhanger we were left with.\n\nFebruary 4, 2024\n\nThis book/series has some really interesting aspects but unfortunately some problems.\n\nThis book heavily relies on the fact that un-ermerged people have to be kept ignorant. The problem with this is that it isn't true. Many of the characters in the series have talked about knowing about magic and paranormal creatures before they emerged. It also seems that some people had binds placed on them but not others. Why? No reason was really given why some people were bound and others weren't. The entire emerged being kept ignorant doesn't make sense nor does it have anything to do with the plot. It doesn't add to the plot. It doesn't have anything to do with anything.\n\nThe fact that everyone is expected to keep the un-emerged ignorant is implausible. For this book, the characters travel to Faerie. Yet, the entire time they were in Faerie, everyone in that realm was expected to keep the un-emerged ignorant. How would anyone know if they didn't? Who would punish the person that said anything? Why would another realm bother with an elaborate gaslighting.\n\nThis entire aspect really ruined the book. It was really frustrating, because the entire time, I kept thinking why would there be this implausible gaslighting rule that everyone would agree to. I mean everyone from the king to the orc servant in a separate realm.\n\nI don't know why there was such a heavy focus on this. There was no need, there are a lot of things that should be the focus. For example, why were her parents killed? Who is Wolfgang's dad? Doyle's dad? Who is disrupting things? What will the h emerge as?\n\nFebruary 1, 2024\n\nRevealed in the Hollow by Cassandra Featherstone is a riveting journey into Faerie, a world shrouded in mystery and danger. As the FMC grapples with an inexplicable turmoil within—fire and ice coursing through veins, enigmatic blackouts, and haunting dreams—a cryptic woman's instructions plunge them into a reality beyond imagination.\n\nIn the pursuit of uncovering hidden truths, Jolene stumbles upon glimpses of a world they never fathomed. The line between reality and fantasy blurs, and the revelation that everything they thought they knew was a lie sets the stage for an intense and unpredictable journey.\n\nAmidst the chaos, survival becomes a paramount concern as mysterious assailants threaten the protagonist's life. The story promises to unravel the secrets that have been hidden in plain sight, challenging the very fabric of the world as they know it.\n\nCassandra Featherstone weaves an intricate tale where the stakes are high, and every revelation uncovers a layer of deception. Revealed in the Hollow beckons readers into a world where the truth is a weapon, and Jolene must be ready to fight for their survival. Beware the cliffhanger though!\n\n#RevealedInTheHollow #CassandraFeatherstone #Mystery #Thriller #Fantasy #BookReview #SecretsUnveiled #MustRead #PageTurner #Intrigue #SuspensefulJourney #Cliffhanger\n\nFebruary 3, 2024\n\nI couldn’t wait to jump back into this series. The great thing about this book is that it gave you a little recap of what happened in the previous book so you know where you are when you start reading. Once I started reading I just couldn’t put this book down at all from the beginning right till the end. The story was just as amazing as the rest of the books in this series. Jolene starts to notice things she isn’t meant to be able to see and starts questioning what is going on but she can’t bring it to the guys as she knows they can’t tell her anything at all. She was given instructions to follow when Jolene and her men go traveling, and she follows them down to the letter. But something happens and she was able to see and hear things that couldn’t be forgotten. Jolene is starting to release there are more things in her world than she realises. Dam I want to go on and on about it as I would end up putting to many spoilers in but I loved this book from start to finish. Can’t wait for the next one\n\nFebruary 4, 2024\n\nThis book picks up right where the previous one left off which I love. There was also a handy recap of the previous book which I honestly think all authors should do, especially in lengthy series.\n\nIn this book, we get to see more of the supernatural world. It’s difficult for everyone involved considering Jolene can’t know about most of it. Lots of wordplay and secrets here.\n\nWe get more about the mysteries surrounding Jolene’s other side as well as more clues about Wolfgang and Doyle’s hidden parents.\n\nThere were times it felt like the story was dragging due to all of the talking in circles, but you can’t skip ahead because a clue could be dropped at any moment. I can’t wait for the moment where everyone can be completely honest with each other about everything.\n\nThis does pick up the pace about 2/3 through. Lots of stuff starts happening outside of politics and whatnot, and it does end in a cliffhanger. I’m not mad about it, though, because I like where it’s taking the story. I am excited for the next book to see how the gang handles what happened.\n\nFebruary 8, 2024\n\nI have to say that there is nothing nothing nothing (as whitney Houston would say) that i don't love in this book!\n\nI don't know if there is a lever to go up in loving jolene and her harem!\n\nI love them all Aholes and not!\n\nIn this book we see more secrets being revealed and at the same time more secrets to find!Its funny how they are trying to solve these mysteries having to face ridiculus restrictions and yet they always find the way to overcome whatever may come.\n\nFast paced and filled with action (all kind of action) this book kept me so enthralled in its pages that i was soooooo sad when it ended.\n\nI love the guys and how their relationship with jolene evolves and how the relationship with each one evolves but also how each one of them grows as a person and as a partner.\n\nI love that we get to see another world in this book and that we can see it with dual vision.\n\nThen there was the ending!\n\nOhhh my god the author just shoved us down that cliffy while she was laughing hysterically for sure!\n\nCan't wait for the next book!\n\nFebruary 8, 2024\n\nI have to admit that if I was Jolene, I wouldn't be handling her situation with as much grace as she is. The blackouts, weird glasses, secrecy from her men, and sense of impending doom would have had me in the loony bin. But as frustrating as it would make me, it is a fantabulous book. More so than ever, there are hints of what is coming for Jolene and her men, but there are sneaky tie-ins to her other series which makes the brief Easter eggs a fun touch. Cassandra has built up a world where the poly lifestyle is embraced and cherished. The relationships are ever evolving. But this isn't pure smut for the sake of smut. In fact, there is much more plot and action than you might give her credit for in the Romance genre. She is fantasy first, with \"Love is Love\" themes and spicy times second. There's big world building here that doesn't drag on, and new friends and foes to sort out. Officially Jolene can say she isn't in the hollow anymore, and we are perched on the edge of a heart attack until the next book.\n\nFebruary 9, 2024\n\nHonestly at one point I was running out of patience with everyone in this series, but now I have become fully invested. I'm glad Jolene found her backbone again & the guys aren't feeling so annoyingly deceitful with this \"secret\" anymore. Jolene and her guys embark of a journey to find Wolfie's dad & I'm just confused. I couldn't remember why it was so important for us to find his dad (yes US because I'm in there too now lol), but for some reason we need to find him asap. Then the author throws everyone for a loop and the big reveal isn't when you expected it. Which for me made the book so much more enjoyable. Much is revealed, but there are still A LOT of questions - even more so after reading the bonus chapter, but I can't wait for those answers, the reunion, to find out who the big bad is, and for Jolene to save of destroy the world (because her sides seem to be doing the absolute most - and I am here for it). Woman I need this next book ASAP! I kid I kid - take your time because this storyline is pretty awesome.\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\nIf you want me to sit up and pay attention, throw a visit to the Fae courts in! Literally every book that has Fae politics appeals to me. Jolene being thrown into that mess, while her giys cant reveal anything about anything paranormal or the fact that they are in Faerie, makes it so much juicer to read. There is so much going on, that you must indulge each word, to the point that I found myself reading this at a snails pace to make sure i didnt lose any details. Pretty sure I did miss plenty though! With this many guys, it does at times get confusing, but I love that there is literally a guy for every possible situation, so that outweighs any last minute scrambling to get them right in your head. I cant wait to see what happens next and really enjoyed all the intertwining of the authors other series' set in the same world.\n\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\nAnd breathe......................... So much was crammed into this 3rd book in this series that I definitely needed a breather after reading it just process it all!! I loved the recap of the first two books because I honestly forgotten half of that and it was a great reminder. This book pretty much picked up where the last one ended but now Jolene (FMC) and the guys are in Faerie to get Wolfie answers on who his father is?? Which is more troublesome with unemerged Jolene being kept in the dark about everything and everyone around her. Made more difficult with each Fae Court they visited. Still Ive loved Jolene from book 1. Her wit and sarcasm had me laughing all way throughout all of the books but in this one her cutting one-liners were what I liked the most. Add into that a pretty good cliff-hanger ending which left me dying to get my hands on the next book now.\n\nFebruary 2, 2024\n\nPut a fork in me… I’m done.\n\nHoly action packed book Batman! If I hadn’t already liked Jolene, I certainly would have by the end of this book. She’s one smart cookie and is definitely no pushover milk sop of a character. We get some theories in regard to her blackouts, and she gets to have some “fun” in Faerie.\n\nHer harem is slowly taking shape and in this book we learn a little bit more about her guys. I’m excited to learn more as the series progresses. We got some smokin hot steam with a lot of variety in the mix. It’s nice that the steam doesn’t feel like the same thing in every scene.\n\nThere are more mysteries to solve and questions that need answers, but that just has me amped for the next book.\n\nFebruary 3, 2024\n\nI can't get enough of this series it was so worth the wait!! Definitely a great continuation of Jolene's story. All the secrets, mystery, danger, and the emotional turmoil has a way to captivate you and keep you hooked from beginning to end. The banter was hilarious as ever throughout the book. I have to give it to Jolene for being a team player, I loved that she didn't lose her snark or willingness to get in on her men which I couldn't get enough of. The cliffhanger was brutal. The story promises to unravel the secrets that has been hidden in plain sight so I'm definitely looking forward to that. As always my reviews are totally voluntarily. No monetary compensation was received. The opinions I have expressed are completely my own.\n\nFebruary 3, 2024\n\nSecrets never stay hidden for long...\n\nJolene and her guys are on the search for Wolfie's dad, but what they didn't expect was a world of hidden games that are more than they seem. As the crew head into faery, Jolene is gifted with something meant to protect her from causing what could be all out war...\n\nBut what is a girl to do, when forces not yet seen decide to mess with her protection and possible end everything for everyone?\n\nWith guest appearances from our favorite Mercenary (The Guillotine) in a passing moment, the world doesn't seem to be all that big anymore!\n\nJoin Jolene as she takes on saving a world she wasn't meant to see, solve the mystery of her parent's murder, find her place in life and a happily ever after with her guys!\n\nCan't wait for the next book!!!\n\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\nFirst of all, I don't usually read trigger warnings but this one caught my eye and I loved it iykyk (those fae!). One of my favorite lines in the book really hits home for me, \"We're a smorgasbord of supes, each more different than the last, and all broken in various ways. It SHOULD be an absolute disaster.\" I absolutely love watching how Jolene interacts with her people, and how they interact with each other. The pieces we get about...things.. raises the intrigue and mystery. The action is amazing and this book had me on the edge of my seat all the way to the end and then yelling hey wait I need more! This author is a pro at giving us a world that pulls us in and then traps us there where we never want to leave. Throw in the mystery and action and this is definitely my type of read!\n\nFebruary 12, 2024\n\nThis book was shared with me in error, and I’m so glad it was.\n\nI decided to give it a go, starting at the beginning of the series and absolutely devoured it! Loved the characters and the world building! Iris reminds me of a snake I used to visit at a local reptile shop, she was so beautiful, loved the idea of that’s where she went 🤣🤣.\n\nThis book continues where we left, and Jolene is starting to understand quite what might me going on around her, but still can’t be told. I love how much you can feel her frustration, so true to form and what live would be like. The guys are learning to work together cohesively, and learning more about themselves. That cliff hanger was a kick in the gut though! Excited to see what’s next for these misfits\n\nJanuary 28, 2024\n\nI have moved on mostly from reverse harem because it just isn’t my favorite even though I have read and will probably read more of it. This is one such series that even though this is RH, I love it for the plot. It’s interesting, captivating, and well-written. Jolene has a muddied history that she’s slowly learning about over time, and the road there is quite fascinating. The way the author skillfully uses hints and keeping the reader guessing is wonderful. While I do sometimes have a problem with keeping her men straight, that’s ok because I enjoyed this so much. Highly recommend. I was provided a complimentary copy which I voluntarily reviewed.\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\nI am completely obsessed with this series, so I was overly excited to get a new story with Jolene and her men!! There is so much relationship growth in this book. At the beginning, Jolene has her bestie and most of the crew in the dog house for their deceitfulness, even though they had no choice. As they begin the trippiest of trips, half truths are revealed and some healing begins. It is full of the classic snark that we all love from this gang and holy hades, is there some serious steam!! It’s just all so good that I immediately want to start reading it all over again! Cannot wait to see what happens next!\n\nFebruary 4, 2024\n\nWe pick up where we left off with Jolene and her men. It has been a little while since the last book but there is a fantastic recap in the beginning that will remind you of all previous details to refresh your mind.\n\nWe spend a lot more time in a supernatural world here and so many more things are revealed and exposed to not only Jolene and her guys but us as well. We go on this journey with them all and we find out more about them all to add to the memory bank.\n\nFantastic world-building, and original story. It weaves a magical tale throughout an you get pulled along willingly. A wonderful book an I can't wait to see where we go next!\n\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\nThings are really getting good. That ending tho.... Did you have to make the cliff so steep? Good gravy I fell right off and yelled a little. The fae world is full of tricks, turns, enemies and very few allies. Who is Wolfie's father? What is even happening? It is starting to feel like every council, society, just every group is pure evil. The Fates are getting involved, is this good or really, really bad? Who is Doyle's dad? Did anyone pick up a clue there? I am sure I will have an AH-HA moment in the next book and realize that his dad checks out. Is it Loki? I am fairly certain that I have a million questions and that I might go insane before the next book is released.\n\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\nCassandra gives us a fae-tastic installment of the Misfit Protection Program! This book begins with a handy recap of the previous books to get us up to speed before launching into this wonderfully written story. Jolene, her menagerie and harem set off to tour fairy while 2 of the men split off to do some other research, and the guys are trying to get through the tour whilst trying to keep Jolene in the dark about the sup world. Hijinks ensue. Dive into this wonderful story to see what happens on the way to the wild cliffhanger! I loved reading this story and highly recommend the series! Don't miss out!!\n\nFebruary 9, 2024\n\nThis is the fourth book in the Misfit Protection Program series and each one just keeps getting better. Jolene and her guys are going to Faerie to find Wolfie and Doyle’s fathers. If I didn’t love her before, Jolene would have won me over in this book. She is a force to be reckoned and snarky as heck. The story has twists and turns throughout as they visit the different Faerie courts. They are all dangerous with court intrigue at each one. The story was so engrossing that I didn’t get a lot of sleep for a couple of days. It was definitely worth it. The cliffhanger got me and I’m eagerly awaiting the next book. I truly enjoyed this one.\n\nFebruary 11, 2024\n\nJolene and her family have left Turkey and headed to find information about Wolfgang’s very absent father. If Jo has never thought there was something very sus about the guys and the world she lives in, this trip to Ireland proves the be eye-opening.\n\nThrough world building and piquing all of my interest, there is some serious forward movement in this installment of the series. notebooks only does Jo get to spend time with her guys, Benny is pulled further into the family, and things really begin to click.\n\nAll has not been revealed or resolved, but goodness me do we get closer. Be sure to get the bonus for this book because man are there some juicy tidbits dropped!\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\nRevealed in the Hallow is *technically* the fourth book in the Misfit Protection Program. This cannot be read as a standalone and MUST have read the previous books to understand what the h3ll is happening.\n\nYou have:\n\n💥Whychoose- 7 mates\n\n💥paranormal\n\n💥Mystery/Suspense\n\n💥🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶\n\n💥Fast Burn\n\n💥Sassy, and very likable FMC\n\n💥Small Town\n\n💥Banter/Wit\n\n💥Cliffhanger\n\nI have honestly forgotten how much I've loved (and missed) this series. Thankfully, there was a brief recap of everything that happened (so far). I swear, this series is so fun. Not only the spice, but the mystery and suspense is top-tier. This is such an enjoyable series and can't wait for more!!"
