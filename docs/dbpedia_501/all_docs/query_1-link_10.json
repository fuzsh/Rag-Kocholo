        "text": "Don Featherstone died yesterday in his (and my) hometown of Fitchburg, Mass. He was 79 and suffered from Lewy body disease, a type of dementia.\n\nYou probably don't recognize the name. But you will most likely recognize what he gave the world.\n\nThis:\n\nFeatherstone was an art major who worked as a designer at a plastics factory when he struck gold -- pink, actually -- with the flamingo design. It was his second assignment.\n\nHe designed it with the idea that in the post-war world, people needed a way to recognize their home within the cookie-cutter world of the housing development.\n\n“You had to mark your house somehow,” Featherstone told Smithsonian Magazine. “A woman could pick up a flamingo at the store and come home with a piece of tropical elegance under her arm to change her humdrum house.”\n\nAlso, it was pretty, his wife, Nancy said.\n\nFeatherstone kept a flock of 57 pink flamingos in his yard.\n\nDisney's 2011 film \"Gnomeo & Juliet\" featured a pink lawn flamingo named \"Featherstone\" in his honor."
