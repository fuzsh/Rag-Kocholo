        "text": "LEOMINSTER — Featherstone, the wise flamingo sage, has once again predicted an early spring.\n\nThe plastic wading bird lawn ornament and Mayor Dean Mazzarella made the call at the 9th annual Groundhog Day with Featherstone Flamingo first thing on Friday morning in snow covered Monument Square. The longtime mayor is known for good-naturedly roasting Punxsutawney Phil and calling him a rat at the yearly gathering and this time was no different.\n\n“There’s no paraphernalia with a rat on it,” Mazzarella said, which drew laughter from the crowd of diehard Featherstone fans who attended the downtown event before he referred to Phil as “that rat slimy thing that comes out of the ground.”\n\nThe mayor does things his own way when it comes to Groundhog Day. If Featherstone sees his shadow, which he did again this time, an early spring is around the corner. This is the opposite of how it goes down in Pennsylvania – if Phil sees his shadow, the prediction is six more weeks of winter.\n\nEight-year-old city resident Emmett Burbank happily held a large stuffed flamingo and stood beside Mazzarella during the countdown to the prediction. The affair drew a WHDH Boston Channel 7 news cameraman who captured the antics and lighthearted fun.\n\nThe flamingo is an icon in the city and has become a symbol of it alongside Leominster’s other big claim to fame, Johnny Appleseed. The pink plastic lawn ornament of the Phoenicopteridae was invented in the city by Don Featherstone in 1957 while working for Union Products, Inc. of Leominster, which still produces the lawn ornaments today.\n\nMazzarella was in his traditional flamingo apparel that includes a top hat, shirt, shorts, and socks all with flamingos on them and a pastel patchwork Bergdorf Goodman jacket that was gifted to him many years ago. He is known for saying that the only way to predict the arrival of spring is through hometown mascot Featherstone Flamingo.\n\n“This is the warmest it’s ever been for these events, on record,” he said before thanking everyone for showing up. “It was good of you to come.”\n\nMazzarella also introduced a new flamingo who was perched near Featherstone, Ms. Featherstone. When asked if she is Featherstone’s significant other, the mayor deadpanned “they are working on that. Prenuptial.”\n\nFor the first time in years, Punxsutawney Phil, the world renowned groundhog who has been predicting when winter will end since 1887, proclaimed the same outcome as Featherstone did. The famous Pennsylvania rodent did not see his shadow on Friday morning, which means that according to the more traditional tradition, temperatures should get warmer sooner than later.\n\nAccording to several different news reports posted online Friday morning, Massachusetts’s official state groundhog Ms. G was not able to step outside on Feb. 2 for her own prediction due to unforeseen circumstances. The program at her home at Mass Audubon’s Drumlin Farm Wildlife Sanctuary in Lincoln was moved indoors to protect her from the chilly weather as she is experiencing some hair loss due to hormones, which is fairly common in juvenile groundhogs.\n\nMs. G has been giving Groundhog Day forecasts since 2008 and has been right about 60% of the time. Records kept by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club show Phil has predicted 108 continued winters and only 20 early springs as of 2024. According to the Stormfax Almanac, that works out to a 39% accuracy rate for Phil."
