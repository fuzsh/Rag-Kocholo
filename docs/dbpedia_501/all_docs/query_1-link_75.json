But, he's even more impressive off the field, where he has a 4.5 GPA and takes part in multiple community organizations.\n\nFeatherstone says the lessons he's learned playing sports will help him for the rest of his life.\n\n\"Learning about physical fitness, learning about what it means to be willing to put in work toward something, even when it's tough, even when your body, your mind is telling you, just take a day off, that means a ton. And then also just the memories,\" Featherstone said. \"Football teaches you how to work with other people, how to succeed as a team and really how to thrive as part of something bigger than yourself. Thatâ€™s going to be huge going forward.\"\n\nFeatherstone says he hasn't made any college decisions just yet but he's looking to continue his education at a competitive university where he can make a difference in the world."
