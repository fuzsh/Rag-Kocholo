        "text": "A short review of the Challenge Cup encounter between Featherstone and Wakefield, and looking ahead to the new season for my hometown club. One that brings plenty of interesting change.\n\nI was given an interesting choice of Sunday sport last week. Staying out of the dreary rain and considerable cold to watch a potential title decider between Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool and Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City, which also happened to be consequential to my own football team, Arsenal. Or watch my recently relegated rugby league club Wakefield take on Featherstone Rovers in the Challenge Cup at Post Office Road.\n\nOf course, I chose Wakefield.\n\nI haven’t attended any of the 1895 Cup games yet, and thus decided I need to watch a match before the first league game which would be taking place the following week.\n\nSpeaking of recently relegated, Wakefield may be in the second tier of European rugby league for the first time of the 21st century, but there is a positive feeling around the club. Matthew Ellis, the new club chairman, is a man of ambition and clarity. He talks a good game and he has the cash to back it up. Ellis is an interesting replacement for the more conservative Michael Carter, the long-serving previous chief executive, who was very open about being more of a stable books-balancer.\n\nWakefield couldn’t have asked for a head coach with better credential too. Daryl Powell did a terrific job at neighbours Castleford Tigers. This job suits him down to the ground too. A rebuild process in his native West Yorkshire. Ellis takes credit for finding a good and exciting fit. With Powell and Ellis at the helm, supporters are very confident of an imminent return to the top flight.\n\nWalking through Featherstone’s tiny town centre in miserable weather made me think of the hilarious “summer rugby” jokes that would inevitably pop up on twitter, and also the likely attritional slugfest nature of the game. It’s been a particularly damp winter which has resulted in a lot of the Super League games being somewhat turgid spectacles.\n\nThe occasion had a somewhat disconcerting feel about it as soon as I arrived. It was a Challenge Cup game, but with the league season having not yet started, it was quite mentally disorientating that it was a Challenge Cup game. In football, you would never see the League Cup being played before the league season is up and running. It was a bit unconventional.\n\nWakefield as mentioned before have set their sights firmly on a return straight back to Super League next season, and expected to win this match as they will expect to beat any side in the same division. Though you knew as soon as you got a look at the pitch that it was definitely not going to be a blow out. It would be a real slog and the victory that the away end commanded would be hard-fought.\n\nFeatherstone are one of the stronger Championship sides so I’m not suggesting it would necessarily have been a blow-out irrespective of the conditions. But the conditions were nevertheless a handy circumstance for the part-time outfit.\n\nOver the years, I’ve seen Wakefield in quite a few mud-bath encounters at Belle Vue. There was the horrendously dour affair against a weak Hull KR side who escaped with a 10–6 victory after Danny McGuire, in his final senior season, scored the only Try of the match. Leeds Rhinos slugged out a win in another game that only featured one Try; a long-ranger from Tuimoala Lolohea. Both came in 2019.\n\nThere has been the odd victory too. Warrington in 2020 when Matty Ashurst and Tom Johnstone both scored late on.\n\nSunday, however did not join the company of days like that. Wakefield instead crashed to their first defeat of 2024.\n\nThe first half was a disappointment. Considerably more disappointing than the second half. There were multiple instances of unforced handling errors in our own territory and playing too much lateral rugby. There were quite a few instances of throwing some dicey passes in conditions that strictly demanded an up the jumper approach. Wakefield should have focused on building pressure with low-risk percentage play.\n\nI credit the Featherstone pack of course. They were direct, they were disciplined in their approach with the ball, they were very industrious. Exactly what a soft, muddy pitch and damp, greasy ball demands. They were aggressive and a little niggly too. They didn’t let Wakefield settle into a groove early on. They got in Wakefield’s faces. Their line speed was good. Better than Wakefield’s. And they capitalised on Renouf Atoni getting sin binned; it was after that when Featherstone really started to get on top in the forwards.\n\nEx-Hull FC man Connor Wynne broke the deadlock down the left-hand side with nine minutes of the first half remaining. The compact and rugged Outside Back managed to wriggle his way over for a scrappy second just a few minutes later.\n\nTwo tries up is definitely worth three in such conditions. Especially when the conditions are only going to get worse as the game progresses. It was a fair reflection of the first half too. Featherstone had the greater field position before they managed to score. I think they played about as well as could have been expected in the first half.\n\nThe Wakefield halfbacks take some responsibility for a dysfunctional game plan, and they both had sloppy moments themselves with ball in hand. Mason Lino’s mistake at the end of the match was dreadful and in sync with all-too-frequent muddled thinking and muddled execution.\n\nIn the second half, there was a clear message sent as Wakefield’s approach was much wiser. I give Daryl Powell credit for that.\n\nWakefield focused a lot more on targeting the middle ground with simple, straight carries and looking to wear Featherstone’s part-time forwards down. The game plan tightened up and the intensity went up a level. The rangy Isaiah Vagana was a handful. Wakefield’s bench strength was on display. The fact this happened straight after the HT interval indicates that the coach initiated the change rather than the players.\n\nIn more conventional conditions, Wakefield likely go on and win the match. I understand that after some brash confidence in the off season, some supporters might not want to hear that and expected a big win. But Featherstone didn’t have many attacking sets in the second half until the last ten minutes. And I think that the conditions became extraordinarily bad when the clock ticked to around 65 minutes. Featherstone’s shirt colour went from blue to black. Wakefield’s go forward deteriorated as a result because the rucks were saturated by the pitch getting softer and softer. Carrying the ball at something close to a maximum pace threshold and thus hitting the defensive line hard became more difficult. This forced Wakefield to resort to the lateral rugby that we saw too much of in the first half, thus mistakes began to creep in again.\n\nWakefield generally had their backs to the wall in that final 10-minute period but they pulled through without a major scare. There was some comedy value when the full-time hooter sounded as quite a large amount of Wakefield supporters headed for the exits, clearly not realising the match would be decided in a few minutes time via Golden Point. Salford Red Devils head coach Paul Rowley was a stand-in commentator for the match and humorously mentioned this.\n\nHaving the first set with the ball in golden point was probably more of a disadvantage for a change by that stage as hitting the defensive line hard with carries was getting progressively more difficult.\n\nA failed Featherstone drop goal attempt gifted Wakefield a seven-tackle set. They had a rocky first two tackle phases, but soon straightened up and quickly found themselves in Featherstone territory. A chance was surely on the horizon.\n\nInstead, Mason Lino frantically searched to create something out wide and mistimed a bullet pass. Griffin couldn’t take the greasy ball in and the big strapping Centre, Gareth Gale, showed Romain Franco a clean pair of heels to fire the Rovers into the hat for the next round.\n\nLino’s mistake at the end was a low-percentage play. Wakefield had another tackle in the bag and were deep into Featherstone territory with another drive up their sleeve. They could have got within drop goal range or at the very least pinned Featherstone deep into their own half which would have made it extremely difficult for the hosts to force a score of their own as there was only around 30 seconds of the first half of golden point remaining.\n\nBy and large, I still think Wakefield will win the league this season. Across the 80 minutes, they technically drew to Featherstone away despite playing the conditions poorly in the first half; and we very likely won’t see conditions of that kind over the majority of the campaign. Golden point is a bit of a lottery and an individual mistake from one Wakefield player was a decisive moment.\n\nWhen the forwards got on top in the second half, the backs would likely have capitalised better in more stable conditions. You could see the bench strength there which will be a major tool for Wakefield in the second half of games. Being the only full-time side in the competition will make it a tough ask on most weeks for sides to stay with Trinity over 80 minutes. It also means expecting the team to win the 1895 Cup, Championship Shield and Championship Grand Final are all reasonable demands that are likely, albeit not certain, to be delivered.\n\nNevertheless, in my view, the squad is presently further away from being Super League ready than a lot of supporters realise. Confidence and excitement are fine. But there has also been a hint of excessive arrogance towards our current environment, and complacency in terms of what the future holds.\n\nBuilding a squad that’s ready to compete in the big time obviously won’t happen overnight though, so this is by no means a jab at Ellis and Powell. The recruitment has not sunk below my expectations. The new regime has only had one off season. It isn’t a comparable situation to Featherstone last year and Leigh the year before, both of whom had a chairman who had spent several years at the club to build some marquee signings.\n\nI half-facetiously mentioned at the end of last season that there would be some upside to staying in the Championship for 24 months as opposed to 12 in order to give the club sufficient time to prepare a Super League squad, which this roster is some distance away from. But as it tends to get more difficult to go back up after the first season, it would probably be best to gain promotion as soon as possible. I also understand that in 2024, securing a stable IMG rating will be a top priority as it would allow the club to survive the first season in Super League without necessarily being good enough on the field. The top 12 clubs on the IMG shortlist are awarded Super League status in a license-type structure rather than a directly results-focused promotion and relegation system, and this improves the stability of an immediate promotion back to Super League.\n\nThough to conclude, should Wakefield go straight back up, I would set a target of a campaign in Super League that is roughly adjacent in terms of on-field competitiveness to seasons like 2014, 2016, 2021. Some good recruitment and squad building would be required.\n\nPercentage of games won in those campaigns (regular league season only):\n\n2014: 37%\n\n2016: 44%\n\n2021: 38%"
