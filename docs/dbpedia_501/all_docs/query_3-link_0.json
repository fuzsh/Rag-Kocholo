        "text": "American hip hop group\n\nThe Featherstones are a record production and songwriting team from Baltimore, Maryland consisted of Justin, Christopher, William, and Matthew Featherstone.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1997, the Featherstones created their production company with their father Lurenda Featherstone and began working with local artists Mystory and the singing group Everidae. While performing in a talent show hosted by The Baltimore Times at Security Square Mall, The Featherstones had the opportunity of meeting Sisqo of the singing group Dru Hill. It was there where he first heard them sing an original song written and produced by the Featherstones. He was so impressed that it led to the Featherstones first full production credit in 2002. \"I Should Be...\" both written and produced by the Featherstones was the lead single performed by American singing group Dru Hill from their third album Dru World Order.[1] The single \"I Should Be...\" went on to reach number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nFor years the Featherstones paid their dues, honed their craft, and weathered the inevitable storms of the music business. In 2013, they were contacted by their publisher to work with Kevin Gates on his album Stranger Than Fiction. While making the track, \"Smiling Faces\" they were trying to make something unique that stood out but wouldn't overwhelm it. They also just wanted to create a record that matched Gates' personalized and versatility. Ever since then, they have good chemistry and have been working with each other.[2]\n\nProduction discography\n\n[edit]\n\nList of songs as producer or co-producer with year released, performed artists, and album name Song Year Artist(s) Album \"I Should Be...\" 2002 Dru Hill Dru World Order \"Rock-A-Bye\" 2005 Black Buddafly — \"Bad Girl\" 2006 Black Buddafly, Fabolous Waist Deep Soundtrack \"Sheets-N-Pillows\" 2007 Black Buddafly — \"On My Mind\" (The Featherstones remix)[3] 2011 Cody Simpson, New Boyz 100% Hits- The Best Of 2011 Summer Edition \"Make Believe\"[4] 2012 Groove Stu Artofficial Substance \"Where I wanna Be\"[4] \"F**k Em We Ball\" B.o.B, Spodee F**k Em We Ball \"A1\" 2013 Spenzo In Spenzo We Trust \"Smiling Faces\" Kevin Gates Stranger Than Fiction \"Never Goin' Back\" 2014 Kid Ink The Draft Picks 2014 \"Make It Home\" August Alsina, Jeezy Testimony \"Right Now\" August Alsina, 2 Chainz DJ Drama presents: XXL's 2014's Freshmen Class \"Touchin, Lovin\" Trey Songz, Nicki Minaj Trigga \"Dead Wrong\" Trey Songz, Ty Dolla $ign \"Ain't My Fault\"[5] Yesi Ortiz, Yung Berg, Verse Simmonds N/A \"Honestly\" Diggy Simmons \"Word Around Town\" Kevin Gates, Rich Homie Quan Luca Brasi 2 \"Hotel\" 2015 Kid Ink, Chris Brown Full Speed \"Psycho\" Rozzi Crane Space \"Go Hard or Go Home\" Wiz Khalifa, Iggy Azalea Furious 7 \"Yet\" Kehlani You Should Be Here \"Do U Dirty\" 2017 Kehlani SweetSexySavage\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
