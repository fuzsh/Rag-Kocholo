Tye Featherstone wants to keep it handsome. The “it” being all of Fresno. And so he’s opened The Great American Barbershop on the corner of Perrin and Sommerville in the northeast part of the city.

Originally from Portland, Featherstone seems to have been destined for a career that involves sharp objects. He got into cosmetology after initially thinking he wanted to go to culinary school. But once he picked up a pair of shears, there was no going back. More than 20 years later, here we are.

Featherstone’s shop — which he and his wife opened together — blends the tradition of an old-school barbershop with a rock ‘n’ roll edge. And while the barbershop is typically a bastion of male bonding, Featherstone says his place is open to the ladies as well. In fact, in an ironic twist, the one female employee at The Great American Barbershop is also the only certified barber…which means she’s the one giving customers the shop’s signature “proper shave.”

The doors to Featherstone’s barbershop have only been open a few weeks, so it’s still too early to tell just what effect it’ll have on the handsomeness of the local population. But with Featherstone and staff holding the clippers, things are off to a good(looking) start.
