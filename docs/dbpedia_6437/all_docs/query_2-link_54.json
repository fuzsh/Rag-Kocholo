        "text": "Orson Welles’s adaptation of Booth Tarkington’s novel about the fall of an “old money” Indianapolis family at the turn of the century resulting in part from the invention of the automobile. Every moment in this exquisite, heartbreaking meditation on time is fully and completely felt. With Tim Holt as the pampered son who gets his “comeuppance,” silent star Dolores Costello as his fragile mother, and Joseph Cotton as her long-suffering suitor."
