Welles’ low-key, reflective follow-up to Kane, adapted from Booth Tarkington’s Pulitzer-winning novel, chronicles the decline of a family and the end of an era. Re-edited in Welles’ absence, its ending re-written and re-shot by others. But “even in this truncated form it’s amazing and memorable” (Pauline Kael). Approx. 88 min. 35mm.",

He has an eloquent, if at times grandiose, flair for the dramatic, which only the camera can fully capture.\"\n\n– Thomas M. Pryor, The New York Times\n\n“A PRETTY SENSATIONAL MOVIE!”\n\n– J. Hoberman, Village Voice"
