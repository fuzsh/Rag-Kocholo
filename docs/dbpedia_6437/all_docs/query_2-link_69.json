Based upon booth Tarkington's 1918 novel, The Magnificent Ambersons tells the poignant multi generational story of a spoiled young heir (Tim Holt) to a decaying family fortune who comes between his widowed mother (Dolores Costello) and the man she has always loved (Joesph Cotten). This is not to be missed on the big screen in 35mm!\n\n35mm print courtesy Warner Bros.\n\nAdvance tickets are available."
