        "text": "*SOME SPOILERS. ALSO, IF YOU AREN'T INTERESTED IN ORSON WELLES, YOU WILL FIND THIS BORING. EVEN IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ORSON WELLES, YOU MAY FIND THIS BORING*\n\n\"Something had happened. A thing which years ago had been the eagerest hope of many, many good citizens of the town. And now it came at last: George Amberson Minafer had got his comeuppance. He got it three times filled and running over. But those who had so longed for it were not there to see it, they never knew it. Those who were still living had forgotten all about it and all about him.\"\n\nBut when George Orson Welles, the infuriating, profligate wunderkind of American cinema got his comeuppance - three…\n\n84/100\n\nThird viewing, last seen 1996. Tried to pretend this time that it's exactly the film Welles intended, rather than get sucked into a useless vortex of speculation. I failed miserably. And I'm not even convinced that it's wrong to mentally compensate for known studio interference. No living soul* knows how the original ending played, for example, but I'm inclined to just ignore the blatantly terrible scene with which Wise replaced it—to treat the fadeout following the comeuppance narration (\"Those who were still living had forgotten all about it, and all about him\") as The End. Frankly, I don't understand why Welles didn't end the film there in the first place—it couldn't possibly be more perfect. Though I suppose that…\n\nOne of Welles most impressive marriages between dramatic force and his essaystic preferences. Even if narrative cohesion gets certainly weaker in the back half (and I do hope everyone, but Jo Cotten, who was involved in the butchering is still burning in hell today), at the same time Welles achieves a fascinating mix of immersion and discourse and I must say that because everyone who knows the production history thinks about it as the movie play, it does adds an extra dimension to the experience.One just get takien by its powerful dark sweep. It is even more than Kane an old young man' movie and more than any of his other works it highlights his aristrocatic side. One thing I've…\n\nFirst of all, have closing credits ever got any better than here? So classy, so democratic and such a joy.\n\nWelles’ follow-up to Kane is a holy object among cinephiles. This is because of its innately unfinished nature: an over two hour film cut down to a lean sub-ninety minutes by a studio, against the director’s will. The extra footage was allegedly destroyed, in a spiteful move to make sure Welles never got his cut, and the edits were justified by manipulative reasons that are well worth looking into.\n\nIs the longer version better? Probably. This is already pretty special but does feel constrained and diluted. The reality of the characters is established so well through script and performance but is…\n\nOrson Welles comes with this picture one year after directing the best all time movie (for many) when it comes to technical stuff, yeah you are right, Citizen Kane.\n\nWell, as far as I read, Orson was expecting this one to be as good as Citizen Kane, but since he couldn’t have the full control of the direction, it didn’t happen. The producer didn’t let him manage the ending of the movie and 45 minutes were suppressed. So, after all, the final product was not what he wanted it to be.\n\nIt’s about a wealthy family and its decadence over the years.\n\nThere are big jumps between some scenes, that has to be because of the 45 suppressed minutes and…"
