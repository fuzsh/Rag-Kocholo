        "text": "Synopsis\n\nOn today’s date in 1942, the RKO studio released the film The Magnificent Ambersons, based on Booth Tarkington’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel chronicling the declining fortunes of a wealthy Midwestern family and the massive social changes in American life caused by the arrival of the automobile.\n\nThe film was written, produced, directed and narrated by Orson Welles, who hired the great film composer Bernard Herrmann to provide the film’s score.\n\nThe film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. You would think Welles and Hermann would be pleased — but quite the opposite was the case. As conceived by Welles, the film ran 131 minutes, but after unfavorable reactions by a preview audience, RKO took control of the film, cut 50 minutes and rewrote and reshot a more upbeat ending. Half of Herrmann’s score was also cut, and another composer brought in for the new scenes. In disgust, Hermann asked that his name be removed from the film’s credits.\n\nDespite RKO’s alteration of its creators’ vision, many still regard The Magnificent Ambersons, as one of the greatest films ever made, thanks to what remained of the original conception by Orson Welles and Bernard Herrmann.\n\nMusic Played in Today's Program\n\nBernard Hermann (1911-1975): Pleasure Trip and End Title, from The Magnificent Ambersons original film score; Australian Philharmonic; Tony Bremer, conductor; Preamble CD 1783\n\nOn This Day\n\nBirths\n\n1835 - Polish composer and violinist Henryk Wieniawski, in Lubin\n\n1895 - German composer and music educator, Carl Orff, in Munich\n\n1933 - Broadway composer Jerry Herman, in New York City\n\nDeaths\n\n1940 - British composer and conductor Sir Donald Tovey, 64, in Edinburgh\n\n1941 - Jazz pianist and composer Ferdinand “Jelly Roll” Morton, 55, in Los Angeles\n\n1979 - American conductor of the Boston Pops, Arthur Fiedler, 84.

I hope he will lay out his whole genius and skill upon it, that the composition may excel as his former compositions, as the subject excels every other subject. The subject is Messiah.” (Gregorian date: July 21)"
