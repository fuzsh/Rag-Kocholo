        "text": "Meet our Graduate Students\n\nJose Asuncion\n\nHi! My name is Jose, and I was born and raised in the Philippines. I graduated from the School of Diplomacy and Governance at De La Salle—College of Saint Benilde, earning an International Relations (IR) and Diplomacy degree. My undergraduate exposed me to critical thinking theories and concepts that seek to understand global affairs, such as sustainable development, environmental diplomacy, and various IR theories like realism, liberalism, post-modernism, and many more. During my thesis year, I initially wanted to explore how sports can be used for development, but circumstances pointed me to another route. Since graduating in 2018, I have earned five years of work experience in sports coaching and management, education, and environmental advocacy and research. I have always seen sports as a beacon of hope. One of my biggest motivations is to use my experience and understanding of sports, especially football (soccer), for broader social change. This quote from St. John Paul II best captures my sentiments: \"Out of all the most unimportant things, football is the most important.\" This leads me to my current research interest, exploring the relationship between sports and the environment. Specifically, I want to understand how we can utilize sports as a mitigation strategy and for broader social and structural changes while improving environmental education and awareness. I have been a fan of Arsenal Football Club since 2009 and have played the sport since I was 4. I also like cooking and mentoring kids and am very fond of dogs!\n\nFun fact: I coached and managed a grassroots football (soccer) team in a low-income community in the Philippines with 100+ kids! If I weren't pursuing a career in the environment, I would be studying for my football coaching license.\n\nJarette Barajas\n\nHello! I spent a lot of my childhood in the outdoors or soccer field in my hometown of San Jose, California. My mother and I would frequently hike at Alum Rock Park and other parks. Every summer my family and I go on camping trips to Calaveras and Alpine County. Because of this exposure and interest to nature and wilderness, I decided to study Environmental Science at the University of Redlands. I majored in Environmental Science and minored in Spatial Studies & GIS. During my time at the University of Redlands I completed many natural and social science courses related to environmental science, while completing labs and activities all around San Bernardino County. For my senior capstone project, I did research on the Panama Canal using GIS and data provided by the Panamanian government to understand why there isn’t enough water in the Panama Canal. My research interests for this graduate program are related to hydrology, energy, and conservation, but I am open to exploring new topics. My hobbies include hiking, camping, traveling, soccer, and golf.\n\nA fun fact about myself is that I received Conference Player of the Year and All-American honors at the collegiate level for Division 3 Soccer.\n\nChristina Barry\n\nI was born in Michigan, and raised in Minnesota. I have spent all of my life enjoying the great outdoors and soaking up as much sunshine as possible. When I was a little girl, I knew I would grow up to be an advocate for our environment.\n\nI was born the daughter of two adults who are passionate about scuba diving, traveling, camping, and spending summer days up at the cabin on the lake as much as possible. Their blood definitely runs through my veins. I was less than one month old when I traveled on an airplane for the first time. My two current favorite travel destinations are the Swiss Alps, and the Amalfi Coast in Italy. I am also a sucker for Alaskan summers, and Hawaii's beautiful garden island of Kauai.\n\nI am a deeply devoted yogi, runner, snowboarder, hiker, surfer, and skier. I am driven and motivated by the lasting impacts of climate change, water management, environmental protection, forest conservation, and sustainable law and policy.\n\nIn 2021, I rescued my best friend. Her name is Aspen, and she is a 2 year old Mastiff/ Yellow Lab mix. I graduated from the University of Vermont in 2020 and received my Bachelor of Science, while also competing on our NCAA Division 1 Women’s Soccer team. I majored in Community Entrepreneurship, and double minored in Public Communications and Community and International Development.\n\nNow that my love for studying our environment is taking me to the other side of our country, I could not be more excited to earn my Masters of Environmental Studies and immerse myself into San Jose's culture. I look forward to meeting new people, exploring new spots, and creating change one day at a time.\n\nA fun fact about me is that I rescued my best friend in 2021. Her name is Aspen, and she is a 2 year old Mastiff/ Yellow Lab mix!\n\nGwen Barry\n\nI grew up in Santa Cruz, California, surrounded by the beauty of the Pacific Ocean and the redwood forests. I have always had a fascination with nature, and our connection to it as humans. My goals for pursuing the master’s program in Environmental Studies are to gain a better understanding of the natural world, and improve the ways in which people perceive and interact with nature. I am particularly passionate about marine ecology and marine conservation.\n\nI graduated from SJSU in May of 2019, with a B.A. in Environmental Studies, and a concentration in Biology. While pursuing my undergraduate degree, I worked as an intern for One People One Reef (OPOR), a research organization centered around ocean conservation in the outer islands of Micronesia. I had the opportunity to go to the remote outer islands of Micronesia (Ulithi Atoll and Yap) and work with the community there to help develop management plans. My specific work there involved measuring reef rugosity and biodiversity. OPOR partnered with UCSC for the analysis of fish and coral samples collected from Micronesia. I gained valuable skills learning how to perform DNA extractions and sequencing on fish and corals. After conducting coral reef research in Micronesia, I presented the team’s findings at the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS) in Honolulu, Hawaii. My current work with OPOR involves coding and quantifying data and community interview responses to determine main themes/concerns. The identified themes are used to determine appropriate conservation methods for the coral reef ecosystems. The project has a goal of bridging traditional ecological knowledge together with western science.\n\nSome of my hobbies include kayaking, tide-pooling, hiking, nature photography, gardening, cooking, and spending time with my fiancé, our cats (Yeti and Yoda) and our dog (Wolfie). An interesting fact about me is that, Ulithi Atoll, where I conducted research with OPOR, is the closest land mass to the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the ocean! In 2012, Filmmaker, James Cameron and a National Geographic team left Ulithi Atoll for the Challenger Deep expedition to explore this mysterious part of our world.\n\nAbby Espinosa-Gonzalez Bellolio\n\nMy interdisciplinary education and experiences in research and industry have driven me to pursue this environmental science program, where I hope to make a meaningful contribution to addressing environmental disparities and promoting equity in marginalized communities. My undergraduate studies at Iowa State University, where I focused on Spanish Language: World Languages and Culture and Industrial Technology: Occupational Health and Safety, provided me with a unique perspective that combines environmental health and safety with a commitment to social and environmental justice. Throughout my academic and industry career, I have been deeply committed to assisting marginalized communities in urban areas, particularly those in industrial settings, by advocating for and promoting sustainable practices. My ambitions led me to pursue a Masters thesis on “Understanding the vulnerability and resilience to climate change among unhoused unsheltered individuals residing in San Fransisco Bay Area, particularly those in close proximity to urban stream corridors”.\n\nI am passionate about keeping the ever-evolving environment, biodiversity, and community members safe through the applied use of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. I have learned that the answer to tackling problems in our community and the world is head-on. Making actual change is through education, research, and the endless pursuit of knowledge and understanding, meanwhile being the necessary change. I want to dedicate my life to environmental research and education once I graduate because all my experiences in research and industry have helped me bring a diverse perspective on the environment and sustainability. I look forward to contributing to the culture of advancing sustainability, driving innovation, exercising integrity, and building community at San Jose State University.\n\nI love to skateboard, am a big foodie, and love to watch shows! A fun fact about me is that I played the Viola for 9 years!\n\nDavid Benterou\n\nI spent my childhood Summers dipping in creeks and playing among oaks and sycamores in my hometown of Livermore, California. I participated in Scouting, learning to love adventuring and camping outdoors, and earned an Eagle award by planning community service for a summer camp helping terminally-ill youth. I attended the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC), and was exposed to studying plant ecology at the campus farm with Steve Gliessman. I completed a BA in Environmental Studies (concentrating in sustainable agriculture) and second in American Studies.\n\nThrough nearly a decade of work in youth outdoor science education at the Boulder Creek, Ca YMCA camp, I enjoyed hiking outside in the rain and sun, smelling wet redwood duff, and kissing banana slugs (actually, we don’t do that anymore!). In this time, I also was certified as a California Naturalist through the UC Cooperative Extension, (which I recommend to everyone to gain more familiarity with the natural world and with current research). Also during my time at the Camp, extreme weather, and particularly wildfires and hazardous air quality, forced numerous evacuations of hundreds of camp participants, and in 2020 the CZU Lightning Complex fires burned the forests surrounding the school. My interest in connecting people to their natural surroundings was met by the question of how to meet dueling goals of wildfire preparedness and redwood forest conservation. Now at SJSU, I’m interested in researching how coast redwood understories respond to wildfire defensible space fuel reductions.\n\nI love backpacking and bike touring in remote places, and I’ve formerly volunteered teaching bike mechanic skills to the public through The Bike Church Co-op in Santa Cruz. My fun fact: I found an enormous California Giant Salamander, while wandering around the redwoods in a downpour, and was so excited I forgot to get a photo!\n\nSky Biblin\n\nI spent most of my childhood in Ojai, a small town in southern California. This is where my love for nature and outdoor recreation began, hiking and exploring the surrounding\n\nmountains. In 2012, I moved to Santa Cruz to attend UCSC where I double majored in economics and environmental studies. My undergraduate research was on elephant seals in Año Nuevo State Park where I conducted accuracy and wildlife disturbance studies on the utilization of drones for wildlife census data collection.\n\nLike many UCSC graduates, I have yet to find the courage to leave Santa Cruz (and can you blame me!). Currently, I am an Interpreter for the Santa Cruz District and have worked at 9 different parks over the past 5 years. Now I have my hands-on projects all across the SC District, but keep my office and park favoritism at Wilder Ranch.\n\nMy impetus to pursue a graduate education came with the recent CZU complex fires. As the third fire that has forced me to evacuate in my life, I decided focusing a career on fire would be the best way to reconcile the dilemma of my unwavering desire to live/work in natural landscapes with the fact that wildfires are only going to increase. So here I am, leaning into the challenge!\n\nI am fascinated by the natural cycles of regeneration, adaptation, and resilience as well as how natural or anthropogenic phenomena that are labeled as “destructive” offer new opportunities for growth and renewal. I hope to build an understanding of both the ecological and societal challenges associated with the increased proliferation of wildfires in the western United States. My proposed area of focus for a thesis is to study the effects of fire management strategies on fuel load and ecological recovery indicators.\n\nI enjoy most things outdoors — hiking, trail running, mountain biking, backpacking, kayaking, skiing, snowshoeing and most recently, mushroom foraging and cave exploring! A fun fact — I was an only child until age 20, now I have a 7-year-old little brother!\n\nMaya Briones\n\nI thrive on two passions: ecology and environmental justice. While seemingly different, these two fields are the core of who I am and summarize the worldview by which I live; that all life, human and nonhuman, deserves to live on a healthy planet. In order to live in harmony with the natural world, we must also live in harmony with each other, repairing the injustices committed by generations past and restoring our connection with nature. My experiences as a student researcher, an urban forester, and a volunteer BioBlitz and citizen science docent have taught me the crucial value and responsibility of involving the whole community in the planning and implementation of ecological projects. I am pursuing my master&#39;s to better live out my mission of teaching all people about the environment through ecological projects, such as citizen science events or educational programming. I hope to gain experience in wildlife conservation to use this knowledge to conserve the invaluable ecosystems of our world while also having the opportunity to reshape local agencies and organizations to engage communities that environmental injustices have long burdened.\n\nRamiro Brown\n\nI grew up in Hayward, Ca. and moved to Los Angeles in 2017 to attend UCLA where I got a B.A. in Anthropology. During my undergraduate career, I took many hybrid courses within the Anthropology department. Through these courses, I was introduced to conservation and ecology. I loved learning about the complexities of environment and the mutual relationship between humans and the ecosystems that they inhabit. It is with this combined interest and knowledge of social and biological science that I hope to make an impact. While at UCLA I also had the opportunity to volunteer for two different labs as a research assistant. The fist lab I volunteered for dealt with the identifying and sorting of human remains, and the second dealt with classifying species of gracile capuchin monkeys, with the ultimate goal of creating a comprehensive guide to capuchin diversity. While very different, both of these opportunities helped me to recognize that I liked doing research and that I would like to further my education.\n\nI knew I wanted something that would allow me to continue to explore the dynamics between humans and nature, and environmental studies is the perfect starting point for my graduate career. It is my hope that I will move on to an interdisciplinary PhD program that will allow me to teach and do research at the university level. My current research interests include climate change and its effects on vulnerable populations; particularly, those with autoimmune diseases, human ecology, and climate change mitigation policies.\n\nMy hobbies include making art, playing guitar, singing, and reading.\n\nRachael Burnham\n\nI was the type of child who consistently brought home stray animals, raised snails and crickets in the backyard, and read books about animals. This passion for animals led me to explore and venture into the veterinary health sector. I graduated with my A.S. in Veterinary Technology in 2009, and have been working as a Registered Veterinary Technician ever since. I continued going to school during my career as an RVT, and graduated from San Jose State University in 2014 with my B.S. in Environmental Studies with a concentration in Restoration and Resource Management. During my undergraduate education, my interests became more focused and my true passion for wildlife conservation and habitat protection came to fruition. I focused my final project and senior seminar on the wildlife in the San Francisco Bay Area. The research I conducted used camera traps to gather data, which helped analyze the types of wildlife and activities of the species within Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve. I look forward to continuing my education to help protect threatened and endangered species and the habitats they rely on.\n\nMy hobbies include hanging out with my fiancé and our two dogs, Athena and Kobe. I enjoy backpacking, hiking, and basically anything to do with the outdoors. It is my goal one day to backpack the Pacific Crest Trail.\n\nMelissa Andrea Canabal Rosales\n\nThere are singular events in life that shed light upon a vocational pursue. It was during my third year of Environmental Engineering at La Salle University in Bogota, Colombia when I began to understand the connection between man and nature as well as my own vocation. Geographically speaking, Colombia is a country with two coasts bathed by the Pacific Ocean on its west shore, by the Caribbean Sea in the east and it is crowned by the Andes range. being so privileged, it seems to be difficult to consider the idea of a wrong perception about the abundance and water wealth. However, that is one of the realities we face as a country. For that reason, I became utterly passionate and interested in discovering the engineering concepts at the base of actions aimed at guaranteeing sustainability. In 2017, I participated in a project with Colombian farms organized by the university as a field practice for the subject Municipal Service Workshop Research Project. I had a closer experience with farmers that cultivate passion fruits (maracuya) in Tame, municipality of Arauca. The experience encouraged me to investigate and explore the rural situation in my country with a purpose of service, seeking to improve their living conditions and introducing improvements in the levels of agricultural production. As my interest in sustainability developed, my interest focused on water resource management and its essential role in all social, economic and cultural areas of the nation. Additionally, I researched into watershed management. Thus, I gained a better understanding on the role of water supply in the hydrographic basin as well as the impact on the level of water as a consequence of the contamination resulting from socioeconomic and industrial activities. I am very grateful to join my Colombian academic background with my studies in the United States at San Jose State University so as to gain a more global perspective and continue exploring in water management considering how climate change affects water management in multiple ways. Thus, creating abundant opportunities to apply classroom knowledge to real-world environmental challenges.\n\nAbout my hobbies, I am a life passionate woman and I am very connected with my purpose in life and because of the beauty that exists in the simplicity of things, it makes me very happy to workout, yoga, or running next to the ocean, I love reading self-improvement books, learning about coffee and wine and spending my time listening to neuroscience podcasts and applying gratitude in my life by studying my level of consciousness more every day and working on it to elevate it and create an impact on society.\n\nAn interesting fact about me is that I want as a long-term goal to gather knowledge to make a business plan in which I can involve: coffee, coffee-growing families, and sustainable practices with the environment.\n\nNicole Chen\n\nI grew up in the Bay Area and have always loved the great outdoors. I enjoy camping, hiking, fishing, backpacking, campervan trips, you nameI grew up in the Bay Area and have always loved the great outdoors. I enjoy camping, hiking, fishing, backpacking, campervan trips, you name it and I love it or I'm down to try. At least once a month, you can find me with my inflatable kayak and a pack of Hazy IPAs in some body of water. I love travelling, whether it be a hike-in day trip or hopping on an overseas flight.\n\nI did my undergrad at UCSB in Environmental Science where I was able to explore a wide range of sustainability topics through both coursework and work experience. Now, I am continuing my Masters focusing on renewable energy, specifically researching grid modernization and equity with an emphasis on accessibility of microgrid technologies.\n\nFun fact - my right foot is a size bigger than my left foot! it and I love it or I'm down to try.\n\nOliver Chesley\n\nA child of two coasts, I was born and spent my childhood in Boston, Massachusetts before moving with my family to the bay area. Here, in the varied and wondrous landscapes of California is where I developed my love for the outdoors, and where I eventually returned to begin charting my course in the field of conservation. I attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, where I studied psychology with a focus in cognitive neuroscience. I developed a thesis project exploring questions related to grapheme-color synesthesia, and after graduating in 2016 I worked as a research assistant in a lab at a local hospital. At the end of my term as a research assistant, I moved back to the bay area and began to refocus toward an active career outdoors, where I feel the happiest. I started volunteering for a local wildlife rehabilitation center, got a job cleaning barn owl boxes in the field, and shortly afterward started working seasonally for Marin County Parks. First in habitat restoration, and then moving into wildlife biology, my time with Marin County Parks afforded me many wonderful opportunities to develop my skills as a field biologist and learn the ins and outs of the local landscapes. Since then I have volunteered and interned with the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory, conducting point counts and banding migratory raptors in the Marin headlands.\n\nI’m looking forward to continuing my education and building the academic background in environmental studies that I didn’t get from my undergraduate experience. I am most interested in developing my skills in avian (especially raptor) monitoring and conservation, but I’m also excited at the chance to broaden my perspectives and be exposed to many aspects of environmental science.\n\nI enjoy reading, hiking and backpacking, playing music, woodworking, and exploring the west coast when I have time to wander. I’ve had a leopard gecko named Trevor for much of my life, who I’m increasingly convinced is immortal. Fun fact - I’ve played catch with a pelican!\n\nIsabelle Cojocaru-Durand\n\nI was born and raised in Montreal, Canada. I speak French at home but went to school in English. I completed a Bachelor of Commerce with a major in Finance in 2013 at Concordia University. Since then, I have been working in finance in Montreal. Why the sudden change in fields? Because I have always been passionate about environmental protection and interested in environmental issues. In the last few years I have learned a lot about climate change by being involved with many different environmental organizations as a volunteer and advocate. I’m now ready to take the leap and pursue a graduate degree in Environmental Studies. I would like to link my background in business with the environment by focusing my research on the implementation of environmental management systems and the integration of environmental practices in corporations. I am also really interested in environmental policy and renewable energy.\n\nOutside of work and school, I love spending time outdoors and I am so excited to experience the many possibilities that California has to offer. I am an avid runner, alpine skier, yogi and scuba diver. I love going on adventures, travelling, discovering new cultures, meeting new people and trying new things (especially food!).\n\nMore about me: Growing up I was so scared of sharks anytime we would go to a beach. In 2015, I had the chance to dive next to great white sharks in South Africa. This experience truly opened my eyes to the beauty of this animal and its importance within the ocean ecosystem. I’m now also more at peace when I go swimming! Another fear of mine, heights!! I have yet to be convinced to jump off a plane…\n\nMadison Creech\n\nI grew up in Turlock, CA and recently graduated from California State University - Monterey Bay with a B.A. in Environmental Studies with a concentration in Sustainable Communities and a Minor in Environmental Health Policy. I currently work at Ag Land Trust, a nonprofit organization, located in Salinas, CA, as an Administrative Analyst. My main passion is environmental justice.\n\nA fun fact about me is I built a 3D model of a Biophilic mixed-used building.\n\nClaudia Damiani Fontana\n\nI was born in Peru and moved to the Bay Area five years ago. I grew up in Lima, the capital and biggest city in Peru, but I always loved more rural settings. Since I was a little girl, my life was greatly influenced by the Andes where I would go to enjoy family vacations with my three brothers and parents.\n\nIn 2008, I graduated from the National Agrarian University La Molina with a degree in forestryengineering. My first job as a young professional was the adventure of my life, I had the opportunity to work with indigenous communities roughly from 2008 to 2011 and then again from 2012 until 2014. Those years living with the indigenous people were greatly inspiring and moving. I learned a little bit of their language, how to catch fish with a net, traditional dances, and the use of medicinal plants.\n\nIn 2008, I graduated from the National Agrarian University La Molina with a degree in forestryengineering.

Those years living with the indigenous people were greatly inspiring and moving. I learned a little bit of their language, how to catch fish with a net, traditional dances, and the use of medicinal plants.\n\nNow I live in the East Bay with my husband, who is a proud SJSU alumni, and I work as a Greenhouse Manager for a local non-profit organization called Valley Verde. I am in charge of propagating multi-ethnic seedlings for the families enrolled in our organic home garden program. My current job gave me the opportunity to learn more about the diversity within Santa Clara County, their traditional foods, ingredients, organic agriculture, and sustainable food systems.\n\nMy hobbies include of course gardening, reading about gardening, pottery, and watching movies. A fun fact about me: most of the time I can accurately predict whether or not a movie is good just by judging the poster.\n\nAs a student at SJSU, I plan on working with Dr. Russell and explore the relationship between soil hydrophobicity and wildfires in chaparrals and forested habitats.\n\nKristy Doerr\n\nI was born and raised in the Bay Area and have always had an immense fascination with animals. Whether it was bringing foster kittens to school to bottle feed around the clock or checking out every library book I could find about my newest species of interest, my life has always revolved around my love for animals. This passion led me to want to study wildlife conservation in order to help animals on a large scale.\n\nI graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2018 with a B.A. in Environmental Studies. While pursuing my undergraduate degree I worked as an intern with the Santa Cruz Puma Project which studies mountain lions through the use of telemetry collars to better understand and protect these apex predators. This project specifically looks at habitat fragmentation and seeks to answer questions about the physiology, behavior, and ecology of these elusive creatures. Throughout college, I also worked with Guide Dogs for the Blind where I trained a guide dog puppy in preparation for a career as a service dog. This meant that this puppy went everywhere with me including all of my classes. But she was “career changed” due to her excitable nature and her unrelenting love for other dogs. She now leads an easygoing life as my stay-at-home pet.\n\nFor my research at SJSU, I plan to study how wildlife responds to wildfires. The CZU Lightning Complex Fire decimated large portions of the Santa Cruz Mountains in the summer of 2020 and I intend to analyze the impact on local wildlife with the use of camera traps and animal sign surveys. Outside of school, I like to spend my free time hiking, backpacking, and scuba diving. I also love reading and spending time with my three cats and dog.\n\nStephen Doyle\n\nI was born and raised in Upland, California. Growing up, I discovered my love of the outdoors during visits to national parks, natural history museums, and aquariums. Another big reason I had a childhood interest in environmentalism was because of Steve Irwin’s documentaries, which highlighted the importance of conservation and being a steward of nature.\n\nI graduated from San Jose State with a B.S. in Environmental Studies and a minor in Sustainable Water Resources. During my undergraduate fieldwork courses, I had the opportunity to visit a variety of California wetlands, which eventually grew into my primary research interest. I was intrigued by the biodiversity and ecological importance of wetlands, such as Elkhorn Slough, and the impacts that human activity had on them. I also enjoyed learning about California’s unique water management challenges, such as saltwater intrusion caused by groundwater pumping.\n\nI currently work as a Regulatory Compliance Analyst for Caldwell Compliance. I have had the opportunity to work on the regulatory scope of works for both the pre and post-construction sides of cellular site builds. A couple of aspects of being a regulatory analyst I enjoy are interpreting NEPA documents and learning about implemented safeguards that are in place to protect avian species that could be adversely affected by the fast-growing telecommunications industry.\n\nAs a San Jose State graduate student, I hope to research effective and natural methods of reducing nutrient-rich runoff sourced from human activity and mitigating the damage it causes to California’s watersheds.\n\nDuring my free time, I enjoy exploring new wetlands, playing rugby, hiking, and visiting breweries. Fun fact: I have a bearded dragon named Biggles who enjoys car rides and frolicking in the grass.\n\nMaya Elson\n\nI grew up in rural Western Massachusetts, exploring the forest with my dog. From a young age, my purpose has centered around safeguarding and nurturing the interconnected web of life. As an organizer, researcher and educator, I am interested in integrating indigenous wisdom with scientific knowledge to regenerate damaged landscapes, protect wild spaces, and help humans fulfill our ecological roles. I did my undergrad in Environmental Studies at The Evergreen State College, where I focused on Field Biology and Environmental Justice. Over the 9 years that I lived in Olympia, WA, I was immersed in climate and forest activism and co-founded the Radical Mycology network. I joined CoRenewal (formerly Amazon MycoRenewal Project) in 2012, where I have been involved ever since and served for 5 years as the Executive Director. I am involved with CoRenewal’s FENiXS Project, an effort to develop methodologies for applying microbial inoculants post-fire for erosion control, toxin mitigation, forest fuels reduction and ecological regeneration. I am leading a wildfire resilience experiment in my work as an Applied Mycology Consultant for the UCSC Sustainability Studies Minor Program. I have always had a deep love for facilitating connection with the natural world and have worked with several nature connection programs over the last 18 years. I have a Graduate Certificate in Ecopsychology. I weave together human and ecological remediation through my company MycoPsychology Experiences, where I teach Applied Mycology, Foraging Ecology and Mushroom Identification. I also volunteer with Santa Cruz Herbal Mutual Aid and Santa Cruz Jews for Free Palestine.\n\nFun fact: I have an enchanted 8-year-old kid who is fascinated by animal neuroscience and mermaids.\n\nOlivia Fragiacomo\n\nHi! You can call me Liv! I just finished undergrad at University of California, Santa Cruz in Environmental Studies. I had a concentration in Conservation Science and Policy with a minor in Spanish Studies. I really enjoyed my research opportunities while I was there, including assisting research on a bird project in Colombia, interning at a garden on campus, and restoring an endangered plant population at the Fort Ord Natural Reserve. I focused my senior exit on Plant Disease Ecology, and hope to extend that research into my work here for my Master’s. I’m super interested in sustainable agriculture, soil microbial communities, and plant disease protection. I would like to more specifically explore the interactions between Arbuscular Mycorrhizae and Compost Teas as a disease treatment and suppressant. I am also just a big plant nerd and could go on about native plants and their cool interactions with fungi and bacteria. A hobby of mine would be bouldering, especially outside with some friends. I grew up in the Sierra Nevadas so big rocks and cool trees to climb were always around.\n\nA fun fact about me would probably be that I hugged a cactus when I was really young, I fell asleep as they picked out all of the spines. Lastly, my picture is taken with the elusive but large California Giant Salamander, my favorite amphibian.\n\nDiana Garcia\n\nMy name is Diana Garcia-Colmenarez, and I am joining the Environmental Studies program here at SJSU to focus on Fire Ecology and GIS. My aim is to learn how to model fire behavior and map out the impacts that fire will have on various surface processes. I want my research to be able to inform emergency response teams and create meaningful fire management plans. Born and raised in the golden hills of the East Bay, one of my earliest memories was seeing a giant grass fire creep towards my house on the Fourth of July. I know as well as anyone how destructive and impactful fire can be. Even more impactful is being able to utilize cutting edge tools alongside fire personnel to put our resources where they can do the most good - for people and for the environment. As the climates change and summers get longer and hotter, I want to be able to contribute in creating meaningful fire policy/data. I graduated from Saint Mary’s College of California in 2020 with a BA in Environmental Studies, and I was encouraged to chase the GIS bug into higher education by my advisors.\n\nAside from the program, I am currently trying to figure out how to grow Stropharia Wine Cap mushrooms in a pot, and so far I have produced one cap (and I’m very proud of it). I enjoy discussing historical costuming, science fiction horror movies, and fantasy novels!\n\nKinsara Garg\n\nI was born in a small town in the northern part of India. I grew up as a shy teenager with a lot of dreams encaged inside as a little girl. Little did I know this girl would one day become an extrovert speaker and unshackle her dreams of travel and lead a team as the head of a department. I was fortunate enough to be raised in a setup where sustainability was an inevitable part of our lives, from sharing air- conditioned rooms to carpooling or biking to work/school and understanding the importance of Re-using and Re-purposing the Non- Biodegradable goods. So, my love for the Environment was inculcated at a very young age.\n\nI graduated with a bachelor's in science with a minor in Botany, Zoology, and chemistry. Further, I pursued a Master's in Zoology, where I got acquainted with environmental biology as one of the courses and developed an interest in it. Post this; I worked as a biology lecturer for 5years. I travelled few countries, which brought me even closer to Environmental sustainability as I realized how human interference and modernization are taking us towards irreversible environmental catastrophe.\n\nThis motivated me to do some volunteering to raise alarming awareness about minimizing the pollution caused to our ecosystem and jeopardizing our flora and fauna, and not forgetting shrinking beautiful years of ourselves. So, I volunteered for two weeks in Bali (Indonesia) and locally in India. This pulled me to San Jose for the love of the Environment, and I pursued this field further to be part of the change for the betterment of species and wildlife. As a graduate student at San Jose, My Research area would be somewhere between the changing Climatic impacts on our flora and fauna and the impact of non-biodegradable waste among species. I plan to work in organizations that aim toward environmental sustainability work.\n\nDuring my Leisure time, I love listening to Ed-Sheeran, Taylor swift and Bollywood music. I love hiking and have attained 14000 altitude, a peak of the Hampta-pass trek in India. Also, I have done multiple Adventure Sports like skydiving, scuba diving and rafting (7 times). I have written about some of those on my Blog. Theoutbacklife.com I am very excited about new adventures and new friendships that await me at SJSU.\n\nFun Fact- I can speak three languages and walk for hours with my ear phones plugged in.\n\nEsther Haile\n\nI was born and raised in the small sleepy town of Dixon, CA. A lot of my childhood was spent watching nature shows, camping in the woods, running around beaches, and being fascinated by animals. I always knew that I wanted to study biology and work with animals as my career.\n\nI graduated from CSU Monterey Bay in December of 2015 with a degree in Biology. During my undergraduate career, I interned with Point Blue Conservation Science studying sea bird diets and Western Snowy Plover populations and with the Pacific Grove Natural History Museum surveying Monarch Butterflies. The more I learned the more interested I became in studying birds. After graduation, I began working for the Resource Conservation District of Monterey County, continuing to monitor the population of Western Snowy Plovers along the Monterey Bay coast and bio-monitor for the Salinas River Stream Maintenance Program assisting in flood control for the local farmlands. I have recently transitioned into working with Point Blue Conservation Science, furthering my involvement with the Western Snowy Plover program. I hope to incorporate my work with Western Snowy Plovers into my thesis, perhaps by looking into how adults react to different predator types, how our juvenile population overwinters, or how they disperse for the following breeding season. Honestly, the research questions are endless!\n\nOutside of work and school, I enjoy spending time outside hiking, camping, and exploring the coast. I also enjoy more indoor activities like sewing, knitting, baking, and drawing. Occasionally you can find me watching an opera or a musical as I am a bit of an old lady at heart. I’ve recently started baking a lot of sourdough bread.\n\nEric Goldbeck-Dimon\n\nI grew up in San Francisco and since childhood I have relied on the greenbelt of the San Francisco peninsula as a respite from the busyness of the city. My uncle was forced to live in the heart of SF’s Tenderloin as a result of rheumatoid arthritis which prevented him from working to earn a living income. My mother, a naturalist, took my uncle on regular hikes when he could still walk, and I would often join them. I contrasted the stress and depression of the inner city with the peace and freedom of nature and realized the importance of the natural world and the pressing need for its protection. The oak savanna in particular resonated with me and has become my calling.\n\nIn August of 2020 I graduated from UCSC with a Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Studies combined with Biology. My dad also played a part in my environmental interest as he too graduated from UCSC with a degree in Environmental Studies. In my undergraduate time I interned at the UCSC Forest Ecology Research Plot (FERP) taking forest census data. I also worked on habitat restoration as an intern at the Younger Lagoon Reserve in Santa Cruz. I took a series of classes on geographical information systems (GIS) and eventually interned with PhD candidate Stephanie Webb, helping her to project Pacific Herring spawning and landing data onto maps of California. I would like to use my GIS background to map out and ensure the future of the oak savanna in California. While global climate change is inevitable, oak trees exert a significant regional influence on ecosystems and could therefore be used strategically as a foundational species to preserve local conditions needed by the flora and fauna that comprise native ecosystems.\n\nWhen I am not chilling under oak trees I am either at the record store digging through the crates, painting abstract expressions/landscapes, or making unnecessarily healthy smoothies.\n\nAnna Greene\n\nHi everyone! My name is Anna Greene and I am from Santa Maria, California on the Central Coast. Growing up, I spent all my time exploring the Solomon Hills across from my home. Rather if it was catching bluebellies with my friends or riding dirt bikes with my brother, there was never a moment I was not outside exploring.\n\nI moved to San Jose to complete my B.A. in Global Studies with a minor in Public Policy and Public Administration in 2019. While in undergrad I interned at the Center for Development of Recycling here on campus. This led to my current job position where I am the Household Hazardous Waste Manager.\n\nAs a Black Danish American, my love and respect for all parts of our ecosystem has been instilled in me since childhood, thus fueling my passion for environmental justice particularly when it comes to the Black community. Many generations of Black people have been left traumatized from systemic oppression that have made many walk away from natural science, particularly agriculture. It is my passion to not only bring attention to the environmental and systemic issues the community faces, but to encourage BIPOC people to not turn away from something that was once seen as important cultural knowledge and heritage.\n\nIf I’m not in the classroom or out on a trail run, you can either find me in the kitchen whippin' up some food and herbal remedies or dancing with my friends at a rave under the neon lights! I am looking forward to continuing my studies here in the ENVS department as my undergraduate experience was more than I could have hoped for.\n\nJessica Gonzalez\n\nI was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and I graduated from San Jose State University with a B.S. in Environmental Studies with a concentration in Environmental Restoration and Resource Management in 2012. Since graduating, I have worked in several field research opportunities, including bird banding in Indiana, conducting shorebird and waterfowl surveys in Bay Area salt evaporation ponds with San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory, and most recently working with SFBBO once again to conduct breeding Snowy Plover surveys as a Biologist. I am looking forward to returning to SJSU to pursue my Master's degree and being able to pursue my thesis on the behavior and conservation of local breeding avian species while monitoring ecological habitats of the Western Snowy Plover.\n\nThe experience and knowledge I've gained through my educational studies, work, and life experiences have been very gratifying in the advancement of my career. More importantly, they have been more rewarding and valuable than I have ever anticipated. Simply being immersed in an environment of knowledge and working alongside wildlife has been a joy in my life.\n\nDuring my free time, I enjoy spending time in nature, drinking excessive amounts of coffee, taking naps, spending time with my three cats and my family, and of course spending my time with birds and wildlife.\n\nLandon Guzman\n\nHello everyone! My Name is Landon Guzman, I am from Stockton, California.\n\nFor my undergraduate degree, I also studied in the bay area at SFSU, where I graduated with a degree in Environmental Studies. Currently, I am an incoming graduate student in the Environmental Studies Graduate program at San Jose State University, with a particular interest in Environmental Policy, as I believe larger actions need to be made within our government to help save our planet. Regarding my thesis, I do not have a concrete question yet. However, I am leaning into diving into the relationship between polyethylene waxes in our personal care products and how the presence of these waxes can affect our environment.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy finding new places to eat and exploring with friends and family, especially here in San Jose, where there seems to be limitless options of incredibly tasty food. I also enjoy being creative when I have the time, I like to doodle and paint with watercolors as medium. I usually paint things I find pretty like, flowers, plants, hands, and bubbles. As for my dislikes, it would have to be eating unsatisfying food. Hopefully, I will get to see all of you in person soon.\n\nTam Ha\n\nMy name is Tam Ha. I was born in Saigon, Vietnam and moved to America when I was only 4 months old. I’m not sure why I was even born in Vietnam because it restricts me from running for president. I graduated from my undergrad with a BS in Environmental Studies and a Minor in Sustainable Energy. I currently am enrolled for a Masters in Environmental Studies for Fall 2024. The main reason I am doing my Masters is to expand my knowledge and build my experience in the ENVS field. Another reason that I refused to acknowledge for a while is that I am not ready to go into the real world and work a monotonous 9-5 job while ceasing a connection to my close friends. Thus I need to stall more and what better way to stall than to further my education, this way it is more productive than just sitting around. When I graduate, I have no choice but to lock in. My research interests are to look into renewable energy and how to truly impacts our environment. I still have to dilute it to a specific research topic but I am set in stone for renewable energy. I have a lot of hobbies such as playing volleyball, guitar, piano, fortnite, running, cooking, and many other activities.\n\nA fun fact about me is that I recently discovered that I slept walk. I slept walk into my own room to kick someone out. According to them I said “I need to eep” and proceeded to plop onto my bed. Saying I need to eep while already eeping is legendary.\n\nCarter Hawkins\n\nGrowing up in the Santa Cruz mountains, coastal environments were something that always existed on my radar. Whether it was my trips to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Moss Landing, Davenport, or further up the coast, my proximity to the coast created a fascination with the complex environment that exists within it and in relation to it. I spent my youth traveling along the coast exploring places that invoked wonder and joy. As I grew older that fascination grew as my knowledge did, and along with that also came a fierce desire to protect the ecosystem I had come to love. I attended Long Beach State as a student athlete while obtaining my bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science and Policy. Along with my coursework and research, I worked as an intern at Vericatch during my final semester at Long Beach State. Vericatch itself is a fishery software company used by fisheries and governments to trace the catch reported by fishermen to ensure sustainability. My role as a Sustainability Market Research Intern was to use my knowledge of sustainability policy to further research and compile a data set of the seafood sustainability purchase policies of U.S., Canadian, and European grocery retailers. Additionally, working with my supervisors about seafood tracking and ideal seafood sustainability policies. I enjoyed studying the balance between the natural world and the policies that are needed to implement change. I am excited to focus my research on sustainable policies that pertain to coastal environments.\n\nOutside of school I enjoy doing anything that will either get me active or get me outside, typically both. Some of my hobbies would include traveling, photography, rock climbing, surfing, biking, water polo, and simply trying new things. A fun fact about me is that I have traveled to 4/7 continents and plan to bring that up to 6/7.\n\nAlexander (Ash) Ivanov\n\nI was born and raised in San Francisco and moved with my family to Portland, Oregon where I stayed until I was 20 when I graduated from Portland State University with a Bachelor’s of Science in Environmental Science and Management with a minor in Water resources. During my time at PSU I did my honors undergraduate thesis on examining the effectiveness of riparian restoration projects on improving water quality in urban streams of the Portland Metropolitan Area. For my graduate research I am planning to continue focus on restoration ecology, particularly riparian areas, by researching the techniques used, how effective they are, and what could impact that effectiveness and hope to work in either impact assessment or developing/implementing restoration plans after graduate school.. I am excited to return to research and work towards a career in restoration!\n\nOutside of academia I am a barista and enjoy photography, rock climbing, hiking, and video games. My favorite photography style is medium format primarily of landscapes and architecture. When I go hiking in the bay my favorite spots are in Point Reyes for some great views of the pacific, although for shorter hikes I tend to go to Lands End.\n\nPadmaja Iyer\n\nWhile it might seem a little strange, I am both a lecturer in the Environmental Studies Department at San José State University and I am enrolled as a graduate student. I would say that I am a nature loving, spiritually grounded human being who loves to teach and learn. With a bachelor’s degree in Economics from UC Davis and an MBA from the University of Illinois at Chicago I ventured into the computer software industry to become financially independent. After 8 years and two kids later, I left the tech industry for environmental work with the City of Cupertino, the City of San José, Silicon Valley Energy Watch, and Smart Yards Cooperative.\n\nUpon realizing my roots were linked to rocks and minerals (Yes, I had a pet mountain - a rock that looked like a mountain), I decided to research the impact of Western United States lithium mines on the environment and community. One of my lifelong hobbies has been pursuing North and South Indian classical music. I often sing looking out on the Guadalupe riparian that is my backyard. Since watching bird behavior while perfecting a musical artform can be time consuming, my family often wonders how I will focus on studying because my head is quite literally in the clouds most of the time. In fact, just last week on a particularly warm day, I went upstairs to change into a pair of shorts. While singing to myself I got lost in the music and came half way down the stairs before I realized I had forgotten to put on the shorts.\n\nDaniel Jacobson\n\nAs a Philadelphia native, I have spent the majority of my life in the Northeast. With family up and down the west coast, however, I have always loved the environment in California. For this reason among others, I decided to drive cross-country to San José for my M.S. in Environmental Studies. At the University of Delaware, I completed my B.S. degree in Health Behavior Science and Public Health in 2018. In the few years between my undergraduate graduation and the start of my transition to California, I explored occupations in the medical, fitness and environmental fields. Through a few years of volunteering with my town’s environmental advisory council, I definitively decided that I want to work to protect the environment. The relationship between humans and the environment is something that I discovered that I am passionate about. With this in mind, my thesis and research topic interests include environmental policy, anthropogenic climate change and the correlation between human and environmental wellbeing.\n\nSome of my hobbies include traveling, hiking, playing guitar, exercising and petting dogs. The most impactful travel and environmental experiences I have had was studying abroad in Brazil. While taking a course about the environmental issues within Brazil, we spent a week on a floating lodge on the Amazon River in the Mamiraua Reserve, one of the largest sustainable development reserves in the Amazon Rain Forest. Being able to personally connect with and spend time in this forest, one that I have heard so much about, has been one of the driving forces in guiding my decision to pursue environmental studies. I believe my background in human behavior, health and environmentalism could contribute to some interesting conversations around the environmental issues present in the world today.\n\nSpencer Klinefelter\n\nAs a child, I spent much of my time outside hiking, climbing, and\n\nplaying in the open spaces around my home on ancestral Nisenan lands in the Sacramento Valley and foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Since then not much has changed, and I still divide my time between hiking, rock climbing, and naturalizing as much as possible. I’m an avid birder and botanist and a lifelong student of environmental education programs, and have now been teaching children of all ages in similar settings since high school. As an undergraduate at UCSC, I focused on agroecology and environmental interpretation, and was fortunate enough to take several field-base classes that took me all over the state. Upon graduating with degrees in Environmental Studies and Education, I began working for the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History as an education coordinator, in charge of developing curriculum, leading school programs, and cultivating stewardship in classrooms across the county. I’m still there, currently focused on how best to integrate community-based organizations with schools as the education climate shifts in the face of a global pandemic.\n\nI strongly identify with western culture and the ethos of the central coast of California and am inspired by the various writers and artists that have come out of the region over the past century. I spend a good deal of my free time reading, writing, and exploring both near to and far from home, when time allows, in a bid to better understand my own sense of place.\n\nI am broadly interested in land management and fire, particularly as they relate to indigenous forms of stewardship and the practices and processes that shaped California over the last ten to twenty thousand years, and how shifting fire regimes and land management practices can be synthesized and better understood in the context of a changing climate. My goal is to weave together traditional ecological knowledge with modern practices to inform policy and stewardship across the west.\n\nOh, and I’m fiercely competitive when it comes to card games.\n\nSarah Knott\n\nI grew up in Rancho Santa Margarita in Orange County, California. I studied Geoscience at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, and received a B.A. in Earth System Science. During my time at Trinity University, the knowledge I gained about the Earth and Earth processes sparked my interest in the environmental field. Environmental Studies excites me because in gaining knowledge, research, and experience in the field I could help the community protect habitats and species and improve the quality of life for many individuals. At San Jose State, I hope to learn more about the impacts of climate change as well as tools and technologies that could combat climate change. I would like to focus my research specifically on wildfires and drought as it is a consequence of climate change that has impacted not only my hometown but many regions around the world.\n\nMy hobbies include going to the beach, biking, swimming, and hiking. I also love and appreciate animals and enjoy going to the zoo to observe their interactions. I also enjoy spending time outside and trying new things. A fun fact about me is that I am a triplet and I grew up with two automatic best friends, Tommy and Nathan!\n\nChristian Knowlton\n\nI was born in Riverside C.A snd currently reside in Santa Cruz. I spent eight years in the U.S. Army with multiple deployments over seas, before returning to school and earning my B.S. in Biological Sciences from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I have always had a strong interest in nature and conservation. Some of my earliest memories are camping with my family and catching and identifying the insect I would find in my back yard.\n\nCurrently I work for H.T. Harvey as a field biologist. Most of my work has been with heaps however I have also worked extensively with owls. I spent two seasons surveying for spotted owls in the Sierras. I have also conducted western burrowing owl surveys, Swainson’s hawk, great gray owl surveys along with surveys for California tiger salamander and red-legged frog. When I am not in the field I enjoy music I regularly attend concerts from local bands at one of Santa Cruz’s great music venues or spending time with my two kittens.\n\nMelanie Kramer\n\nHowdy! I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, where I grew up hiking in the beautiful Franklin Mountains. I graduated from Texas A&M University with a bachelor’s in physics, double minoring in math and electrical engineering. I moved to the Bay Area at the end of 2019 to work at NASA Ames Research Center. I’m currently a project administrator and previously worked in the Office of the Chief Scientist. I also volunteer with two employee resource groups to advocate for and support the Ames workforce community. The West Texas desert will always have a special place in my heart, but I fell in love with the redwood forests and ocean views of the Bay Area when I moved to California. My research interests are currently very broad, and my hope is that as I progress in my studies within the Environmental Studies program, I can narrow my passions towards something impactful and meaningful. I’m interested in wildfire monitoring, management, and risk mitigation, as well as forest ecosystem recovery after wildfires. I want to both protect people and preserve forests as wildfires are happening, as well as better understand how ecosystems recover after such events and change over time. Some of my hobbies include taking long walks with my dog; playing video games and board games; and theme park history deep dives. I love music, both going to concerts and playing instruments. I’ve played the flute since I was in 5th grade, and I’m currently learning the ukulele. I’m an aspirational reader, knitter, and cross stitcher; I love doing these activities but motivation for them comes in waves.\n\nA fun fact about me is that I have aphantasia, so I can’t picture things in my mind! I discovered this during my multivariable calculus course in undergrad – wondering why I was the only one in my class frustrated at the professor saying, “just imagine rotating the diagram in your head” and not finding the advice helpful.\n\nErin Lacour\n\nI grew up in a small town in Ventura County, just a short walk from a little-known regional park where I have spent countless hours exploring. Growing up so close to nature is what founded my connection to the outdoors and wildlife. Even though I have always been drawn to nature, including visiting countless national and state parks throughout my life, it was not until college that I realized I wanted, or even could have a career studying and protecting natural resources.\n\nI graduated from UC Irvine in 2015 with a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a minor in Medical Anthropology. During my undergrad I gained experience from my amazing classes, working in a research lab studying bird behavior, and working in sustainability. Since graduating I have had a variety of jobs such as teaching, wildlife rehabilitation, restoration and stewardship, and wildlife monitoring and inventory.\n\nI moved to the Bay Area a few years ago and have worked for a collaboration of land agencies known as One Tam as well as Marin County Parks. Some of my favorite projects I have worked on include the Marin County Bat Roost Ecology Project, the Foothill Yellow-Legged Frog Docent Program, and of course the Marin Wildlife Picure Index Project which I will be using for my masters thesis. Using data from WPI, I will be looking at species occupancy and diversity in relation to human disturbance.\n\nSome of my hobbies include hiking, cooking, camping, using iNaturalist, and birdwatching. My favorite taxa are raptors, flycatchers, and meso-carnivores, with special love for screech owls, Western kingbirds, and badgers. I love working as a wildlife biologist and monitoring for special status species, and hope to make a career in wildlife management. A fun fact about me is that I spent a couple weeks in South Africa as wildlife vet intern, where I both provided treatment to farm animals and helped capture megafauna such as nyala and cape buffalo.\n\nLily Law\n\nI was born in Hong Kong and immigrated with my family to the US when I was 10. I was fascinated by the strong environmental focus that San Francisco has for many aspects of city life, e.g., integrative park system within a city and a comprehensive residential recycling and composting program. I had the opportunity to intern for San Francisco’s Department of the Environment in high school and it strengthened my interest in environmental work.\n\nI completed my B.S. from UC Berkeley with double majors in Environmental Sciences and Forestry Natural Resources in Spring 2018. During the summer of my second year in college, I attended the UC Forestry Camp and learned about Sierra Nevada ecology, silviculture, and forestry techniques and management. This experience inspired me to complete my senior thesis in soil microbial ecology, specifically on the interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant roots in the rhizosphere. After graduating, I became the lab manager for Prof. Jill Banfield at UC Berkeley who is an expert in microbial ecology and bioinformatics.\n\nAt SJSU, I’m interested in studying the impact of invasive conifers and their removal on the soil microbial community of a California coastal grassland. I hope to provide valuable background information about the soil microbiome and apply the findings to support the development of effective management plans in the future.\n\nMy favorite hobbies are traveling and eating delicious food. I’m usually already planning my next meal as I’m eating my current meal!\n\nChristine Lopez\n\nHello! My name is Christine Lopez and I have been living in the San Francisco Bay Area my whole adult life, but mainly from the East Bay. I received my BS in Environmental Studies minor in habitat restoration in the spring of 2022. I am interested in the ecology side of environmental studies and the ways that we could mitigate our negative influence on the ecosystem.\n\nI was originally a navy brat and grew up in a navy town near Seattle, then I migrated to the Bay Area in my late teens. Growing up in Puget Sound and later the Bay Area I was always fascinated by the transition zone between land and water. Due to RealLife™ it took me 7 years to get my AS in natural science from Laney College in Oakland, CA with the intention of transferring to a university for marine biology. Due to RealLife™ once again it took me 5 years to get my transfer requirements completed, only to figure out at the last minute I wanted to focus on environmental studies.\n\nOnce at SJSU, I completed my BS in environmental studies in 2 years. My focus was on tidal marshes and riparian zones with my senior seminar project focused on how urban features can affect invasive plant species intrusion in riparian zones. I immediately applied for the master’s program before graduation and was accepted for fall 2022. My master’s thesis will focus on how urbanization can affect three canines of Silicon Valley, grey foxes, red foxes, and coyotes.\n\nCurrently, I am an intern with The Urban Wildlife Research Project working under Bill “The Fox” Leikam in the Palo Alto Baylands. We use camera traps to do a broad observation study on the various species in the Baylands. The Bayland currently is the home to two grey foxes “Liamos” and “Big Eyes” and two beavers, as well as the occasional coyotes and red foxes, plus dozens of raccoons, skunks, and opossums.\n\nMy 10-year goal is to be in a position be help mitigate healthy ecological functions in an anthropogenic world.\n\nMojgan Mahdizadeh\n\nI was born and raised in Tehran, the capital city of Iran. While living in Iran, I was able to obtain a B.A. in Economics from Azad Tehran University. My country has been subjugated by an oppressive and brutal theocracy for over 40 years, but I was fortunate enough to immigrate to the United States to enjoy basic human rights, freedom and a better future. Back then, the only refuge that would give me a sense of peace and solace was nature. Still, some of the best memories I have from my homeland are the trips I took to the Caspian Sea and the hikes in the Alborz mountain range. In the United States, I became aware of the environmental issues facing humanity. That soon became my motivation to attend college again and switch from finance to environmental studies. In May 2021, I graduated from SJSU with a B.A. in Environmental Studies and a minor in Restoration and Resource Management. Dr. Russell’s Forest Ecology class at SJSU inspired the love of redwoods in me. For my final project in Senior Seminar, I studied the initial response of several tree species in Big Basin redwood forest that was decimated by the 2020 CZU wildfire. I do strongly believe that our relationship with nature is reciprocal and we have the responsibility of returning the gift of the Earth. Redwood forests have endured a hundred years of cruel logging and are now facing threats of global climate change, wildfires and urban development. For my graduate thesis, I hope to be able to study the impact of human-induced disturbances on redwood forests and help restore and protect these awe-inspiring giants.\n\nIn my spare time, I do restoration work as a volunteer at Ulistac Natural Area, a 40-acre undeveloped land in the city of Santa Clara. Besides my passion for the environment, astrophysics fascinates me the most and I can’t wait to find out what the James Webb Space Telescope is going to reveal about the universe we live in. My hobbies are hiking, camping, skiing, kayaking, and attending live music performances. I also have a goal of visiting all national parks in the U.S. within my lifetime.\n\nMichelle Mandly\n\nMy name is Michelle Mandly and I grew up in equal parts on Cape Cod, Massachusetts and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Growing up I always had spent time either on the coast or in the Appalachian Mountains which gave way to my love of the outdoors and the involvement of its management. As an adult, I moved and lived in southwest Florida. While living there, I saw firsthand the effect of nutrient runoff and its interaction with Karenna brevis, an abundant cyanobacteria, that multiplied under certain conditions resulting in harmful algae blooms that caused not only environmental implications but financial problems for many people along the coast. I focused my senior thesis at Sacramento State University on agricultural nutrient runoff and mitigation practices pertaining to Southwest Florida and the Caloosahatchee River. I intend to continue my education on mitigation practices and focus my master’s thesis on current nutrient water-related problems here in California. Throughout my college career, I have also obtained certifications in geology and geographic information systems and have spent time working with Living Arroyos and East Bay Regional Park District doing creek clean-ups and habitat restoration projects.\n\nWhen it comes to hobbies I enjoy traveling, reading, and gaming. My family and I often meet up at various locations and hike/backpack multiple times a year. An interesting fact about me is that I had lost kidney function in 2015 which resulted in end-stage renal failure and myself performing peritoneal dialysis daily. I received a successful kidney transplant from my mother Barbara at UC Davis Medical Center on August 24th, 2015, the same week I started my college career.\n\nLindsey Marsh\n\nMy name is Lindsey Marsh and I am a San Jose native. I didn’t go camping or hiking often growing up, but I do have fond memories of getting together with my extended family at our local parks. As I grew older, my interests in outdoor recreation pulled me closer to the natural environment. I received a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology with a minor in Recreation at San Francisco State University in 2016. While completing my degree, I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Nina Roberts on two research projects regarding visitor use/non-use at San Mateo and Marin County parks. We conducted focus groups in low-income communities throughout the counties to learn about the different types of constraints and barriers to county park visitation. Listening to these experiences opened my eyes to the inequities that are prevalent throughout the SF Bay Area and it propelled me to pursue work that would benefit vulnerable communities.\n\nSince graduating, I continued to work with Dr. Roberts on several research opportunities. In 2018, our research team conducted a study in support of Assembly Bill 250 with the California Coastal Conservancy, Coastal Commission, and California State Parks to investigate effective national models and possible strategies to expand overnight opportunities along the California coast for low-to-moderate income families. This project examined existing facilities and identified potential new opportunities to enhance coastal access and recreation for all Californians. The data are currently being used to influence future projects and funding.\n\nAt SJSU, I plan to focus on pro-environmental behavior, environmental education, and environmental justice. I am interested in studying socially vulnerable communities within the SF Bay Area and their environmental identities to develop strategies for improving environmental education programs and teaching community members to become advocates.\n\nMost of my spare time is devoted to my dog. We love to go on hikes every weekend and backpack in the Sierra during the summer. I am also a lifelong San Jose Sharks fan! The happiest day of my life will be when the Sharks win the Stanley Cup (don’t tell my fiancé).\n\nEmily Matthews\n\nI was raised in a small rural town in western Sonoma County, surrounded by a mix of cattle fields and open spaces. From a young age, I loved animals and the outdoors. Much of my childhood was spent playing outside with friends; hiking, climbing trees, and exploring nature in our backyards. As I got older my love of the outdoors became a fascination with ecology and a passion for environmental issues. I began to actively pursue ecology and environmental science in high school. When possible, I would choose classes that focus on biology and environmentalism and was an active member of my school’s Students for Sustainability Club.\n\nI studied Environmental Science at Saint Mary’s College of California. The small size and interdisciplinary focus of Saint Mary’s allowed me to take a wide array of classes and provided me with new perspectives. Through this experience, I realized that I was most interested in the ecological aspects of environmental science. Through internships with the UC Davis Bodega Marine Lab and WRECO (a local consulting firm), I was able to further my understanding of ecology, ecological research, and the applications biology and environmental science outside of academia. My most rewarding work in undergrad was my senior capstone project; studying the variation in bird biodiversity in urban, suburban, and rural areas. I graduated with new knowledge and confidence in my field of interest as well as new frameworks for understanding environmental issues, including - environmental justice, economics, and politics.\n\nAfter graduating I spent three years working at WRECO as an environmental scientist consulting on the biological and water quality impacts of construction projects. My job included both fieldwork and report writing. In the field, I conducted wildlife and botanical surveys, wetland delineations, and mitigation monitoring. My report writing included Biological Assessments, Annual mitigation monitoring reports, water quality reports, and stormwater data reports.\n\nIn graduate school, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the ecological components of environmental science. My research interests include restoration ecology, habitat conductivity, biodiversity, and the impact that climate change will have on restoration. I hope to protect sensitive species and ecosystems through restoration and climate change preparedness.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy hiking, camping, birding, going for runs, cooking, reading, listening to podcast and audiobooks, and spending time with friends. I am also an amateur doodler and an appreciator of music and film. A fun fact about me is that I was born on Friday the thirteenth.\n\nAnn McMillan\n\nMy home biome is temperate rain forest, favorite california vegetation type is coastal sage scrub, my favorite bird is the American dipper, and the greatest plant genera are Quercus and Calochortus. My favorite population is the California slender salamanders in my garden. My favorite organism is always the one I am looking at right this minute. You know the hiker who is never hiking because they are always drawing a picture, keying a plant, or watching a bird? That’s me.\n\nI come from La Honda, California and currently live in Mountain View. I have worked as a birder, science illustrator, fine artist and teacher. As an undergraduate, I studied science illustration, environmental studies, and biology at UC Santa Cruz. I am starting a Master's degree in fall of 2023 to work in climate action and ecology. I'm interested in urban and wildlands forestry as well as restoration ecology.\n\nOur urban forests will be critical for mitigating the damages of climate pollution and biodiversity loss. I hope my thesis will advocate for an ecological approach to urban horticulture in the built environment. Sponsoring ecosystem engineers, such as American Beaver, to do local restoration work would be interesting as well. Dr. Klock will be my advisor since my project will focus on restoration ecology.\n\nI can identify birds by song, learned to key plants in high school, and have spent too much time on rollerskates.\n\nRebecca Mina\n\nHello my name is Rebecca Mina. I was born and raised in Stockton, California. I attended San Joaquin Delta College for three years and transferred to CSU East Bay where I earned my bachelor’s degree in environmental science and a minor in biology. At East Bay, I completed a project looking at the input/output of dissolved inorganic carbon ( DIC) at the Eden’s Landing salt marsh near the campus. I formulated three hypotheses to better understand the relationship between the salt marsh and the amount of DIC going in and out of the wetlands. I especially enjoyed collecting pore water samples at the marsh since this allowed me to better grasp my project, which is what I look forward to do more of during the masters program! I also did a project in an environmental impact course involving the hypothetical impacts of placing solar panels on a desert. Here, we determined how much the installment of the solar panels would impact the desert on areas such as flora/fauna, noise pollution, and the cultural impacts. For my thesis, I am very interested in researching topics such as environmental impact analysis or environmental restoration. I also would enjoy researching topics related to water or soil quality since I touched on this area during my undergraduate too.\n\nMy hobbies include anime, manga, reading books, listening to music, spending time with my friends, and working on puzzles! I also like matcha flavored drinks/snacks and turtles ! A fun fact about me is that I have three pets, which are my two dogs, Cosmo and Bella, and my pet turtle Princess.\n\nJamsheed Mistry\n\nMy name is Jamsheed Mistry and I was born in Mumbai, India. At the age of three, my family and I relocated to Toronto, Canada, where I was raised in a suburban community surrounded by maple trees and lots of snow. By being surrounded with the native wildlife of Canada from an early age, my passion for climate change mitigation blossomed in my childhood. During my childhood, I would constantly berate both my parents and my elder brother when their daily activities would exceed an arbitrary threshold that I would make up. In retrospect, I realize that I was subconsciously monitoring my family’s ecological footprint as a child with no knowledge whatsoever about ecological footprints.\n\nWhen I was in the third grade, my family moved to Cupertino, California, where I completed my elementary, middle, and high school years. For my undergraduate studies, however, I decided to enroll at the University of Toronto because I had always had an affinity to attend the institution that was right next to my childhood home. In my undergraduate studies, I double majored in biology and environmental science. As an undergraduate student, I had taken a plethora of courses in different disciplines – ecology, evolution, genetics, earth science, data science, geography, chemistry, biology, and religion – but my favorite subject was environmental science. My undergraduate research included writing a literature review paper analyzing the environmental and public health effects of exposure to methyl parathion pesticides. Furthermore, I had also conducted an extensive risk assessment/matrix detailing the complex abiotic and biotic components of a proposed stormwater management restoration project in Ontario, Canada during my time as an undergraduate student.\n\nAs a graduate student at SJSU, I aspire to work with Dr. Mulvaney and learn more about solar power commodity chains. Under Dr. Mulvaney’s tutelage, I plan research about how solar panels and urban green spaces are utilized to mitigate the urban heat island effect. My hobbies include watching basketball (Go Warriors!), reading, and socializing with my friends. A fun fact about me is that my smile is constant and infectious! I have a very jovial and kind personality and my favorite genre of movies is, you guessed it… comedy!\n\nGayatri Mujumdar\n\nI am an Indian who has had the privilege of moving across India while growing up. I relocated to a new place every 2 years, changing schools, meeting new people, adapting to different climates, and connecting with diverse religions, cultures and demographics, all of which have played a great part in shaping me and developing my career. I pursued my undergraduate degree in Architecture from the Academy of Architecture, Mumbai, India. Post my bachelor’s I was working at Artha Studio, Pune for 2 years, a sustainable design firm in India, where my thinking was immensely shaped towards being resource efficient, environmentally sustainable and devising possibilities so that human well-being is achieved with minimal environmental footprint. This insight led me to pursue a diploma in “Sustainable management of natural resources and nature conservation” from the Ecological Society, Pune, India. It enhanced my understanding of the connections between humans and nature, economy, livelihoods and conservation and I aspired to transform my career ambition towards planning for the environment leading me to pursue my Master’s in Urbanism (urban planning and design) at the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands. It was here in a country that proclaims to be built by the Dutch people; since the whole country was a swamp originally, I realized what it means to live with nature. I was exposed to a variety of environmentally friendly ways of living; public transport being the major one and if you find someone speeding on a bicycle or running to class with a helmet on, that would be me!!\n\nWhile I had an amazing time exploring the Dutch landscapes for academic projects that were based on topics such as wellbeing, circular economy, SDGs, climate adaptation and sea level rise. My master’s thesis was based on improving the resilience capacities of a city called Otsuchi, in Japan that was affected by the March 2011 Tsunami. This project had a profound impact on my conscience about why nature plays a central role in the cognitive process of human development. Having recently immigrated to California and observing firsthand the American gift to Urbanism- ‘The sprawl’, I am again drawn back to academia at SJSU to pursue my second master’s in environmental studies to find solutions the environmentalist way….!!!\n\nA sustainability advocate at heart and an eco-driven urbanist, I am also a licensed architect with COA(council of architecture, India) and an associate-level IGBC (Indian green building council) certified professional also from India. An interesting thing about me, I started my own architectural company at the age of 23. My hobbies include gardening, currently, I am growing basil, oregano, rosemary, curry leaves, holy basil, coriander, mint and some flowering plants. I also love baking, going on hikes and biking around in the city.\n\nMai Nguyen\n\nI grew up around areas of San Jose, CA for the majority of my life. Ever since my childhood years, being outdoors and exploring new places has consistently been a keen interest of mine. With the combination of my outdoor childhood experiences and the education I received throughout those years, I had the idea fairly early on that I wanted to study the Earth’s systems. Along my academic course, I became intrigued by human interaction and mental processes, leading me to obtain my undergraduate degree in psychology with a minor in legal studies from San Jose State University. Nevertheless, environmental issues and topics, specifically relating to the ocean, continues to be the field I want to focus my attention. As an environmental studies graduate student, I plan on examining how the legal system is taking part in preserving the ocean, and engaging in ways to reduce human impact on the marine environment. The issues of overfishing and plastic pollution in the ocean are areas I am aiming to tailor my research.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time with my dog, hiking, photography, swimming, and any outdoor activities. A fun fact about myself is that I nearly drowned three times but I am still really eager to explore different aspects of the ocean.\n\nAmairani Oronia Ortega\n\nI was born in Zacatecas, Mexico and was raised in San José, California where I had the privilege of experiencing the city’s diverse cultures. I enjoy spending time in nature, baking for my family and friends, and can commonly be found glued to a good book. My parent’s instilled a strong work ethic in me and inspire me to be courageous and advocate for those who cannot themselves. Recently, I graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Environmental Studies with a minor in Climate Change Strategies from San José State University. My interest in environmentalism began in high school where I first learned about the basics in resource management, restoration, and climate change impacts through various media and literature. Having a background in social activism and organizing, I began to notice the disparities in impacts that different communities faced when dealing with pollution and health risks from environmental events and disasters. This propelled me to take a specific interest in environmental justice so I could contribute to the research and solutions of lower socio-economic communities that face environmental problems. During my time as an undergrad, I completed a policy analysis on different approaches to reduce groundwater pollution in the Central Valley from shale fracking. As a graduate student, I look forward to researching the overall health impacts that pesticide use have on agricultural workers, specifically reproductive issues women in the field face due to exposure of certain chemicals.\n\nFun fact: My favorite place is the beach, rain or shine, and I have a mini library of over 180+ books\n\nMayra Pelagio\n\nI grew up in rural Mexico and migrated to the U.S when I was thirteen, I studied high school in East San Jose- Yerba Buena H.S. I have a B.S in Environmental Science and Management and a minor in Wildlife Conservation Biology from UC Davis. During my undergraduate career I spent two summers working in Colorado with a program that brought Latinx families outdoors. As a program coordinator I planned several overnight camping trips for families. During these trips I guided recreational activities including hikes, mountain biking, fishing, and archery for all ages, fun fact- I’m a certified archery trainer. It is my firm belief that nature and outdoor spaces should be accessible to everyone, and that the environmental community should focus on creating resources to promote diversity and inclusion. For this reason, after graduating I became an independent contractor and worked with environmental non-profits to organize outdoor activity events for the Latinx community in Woodland, Sacramento and Davis region. I am highly passionate about conservation biology; I’m especially interested in amphibians, reptiles and birds. For my studies I’d like to focus in conservation biology and the accessibility underrepresented communities have to outdoor spaces. In my free time I volunteer with social justice groups, lobby for policies at the state capitol, and attend rallies.\n\nTanay Pradhan\n\nI was born and raised right here in the Bay Area and have always had a fascination with the natural world and being outside. Whether it be rewatching the Planet Earth Documentary Series every few weeks as a child or my yearly scuba diving adventures, I take any and all opportunities to see and explore new landscapes and environments. These interests eventually led me to complete a B.S. in Environmental Management and Protection from Cal Poly SLO in 2022. During my undergraduate time, I discovered a passion for studying air and noise pollution, hazardous waste, and environmental injustice. While completing my degree, I had the opportunity to work with the California Military Department and many California Central Coast jurisdictions to update Military Department’s comprehensive waste management plan. Since graduating, I have had the chance to grow my passion working for Kimley-Horn as a CEQA/NEPA Air Quality, Health Risk, and Noise consultant. As a graduate student, I hope to continue growing my knowledge on the impacts that air pollution has on vulnerable communities in California. Specifically, researching multipollutant health risk approaches to analyzing cancer risk impacts on communities and how CEQA can more effectively address air quality impacts. I hope that with my Masters at SJSU, we can get one step closer to a healthier and cleaner environment for everyone!\n\nOutside of school and work, my hobbies include playing as much soccer as possible, hiking, and watching movies. I am also completely obsessed with watching soccer and have been a lifelong Liverpool fan. I even wake up for those 4 A.M. games!\n\nDomingo Poggione\n\nI was born and raised in Santiago, Chile. I have always been passionate by our unique ecosystems. I absolutely love traveling and visiting new places, exotic cuisines, different cultures and people. I have had the opportunity of travelling quite a bit in Chile and around the world. One of my favorite hobbies is backpacking, which I have done almost throughout all South America. I am a very active person and I love trying new things, so I have had many different hobbies in my life. Of late my favorite hobbies are gardening, playing basketball, hanging out with my family and videogames.\n\nI graduated from Universidad Catolica de Chile on 2017, with a B.A. in sociology. As a student I focused on studying community manage and qualitative and quantitative research methods. After I graduated, I worked on territorial interventions with vulnerable/vulnerated communities. Mainly, I have developed two lines of work: urban gardening with low income families and renewable energy projects with indigenous communities in the rural south of my country. I have special interest in learning how people adapt to their environment: that amazing human capacity of transforming their surroundings and transforming themselves as they interact with the ecosystems that sustain them.\n\nIn order to face the inevitable consequences of climate change we need to have tools and knowledge on how to face the environmental hazards that affect (or will affect) our territories. At SJSU I wish to work with Dr. Rampini to explore those key aspects of climate change adaptation that will help create resilient and strong communities, focusing on vulnerable groups.\n\nFun fact: I have 2 appearances in two different documentaries: “Voces del Puelo” and “Itrofil Mongen”. Not that I am a film star, but for a non-actor, its pretty good.\n\nRaji Rajesh\n\nI have always been passionate about nature. It began early in my childhood with my mother teaching simple practices she implemented around our house such as growing vegetables and fruits, reusing instead of buying new things and not wasting food. I pursued an undergraduate degree in Engineering from Bangalore, India, and then worked in the IT industry for 9 years in India. Even though I worked in IT, my passion for nature and the environment did not die down. I participated in volunteering activities to raise awareness about waste segregation in Bangalore, practice eco-friendly tactics around my household. My hobbies include hiking, gardening and cooking. My favorite hiking trails in the Bay area are the PG&E trail in Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve and Mission Peak in Fremont. I am a novice gardener and dream to have a bigger vegetable garden, big enough to provide at least a few veggies for my cooking needs. It pains me to see the havoc created on the environment by us, humans. For instance, oceans of plastic affecting sea life, Industrialization leading to pollution and lesser green cover, wastage of food, chemicals almost everywhere around us and in the food we eat. Pondering over these issues, I decided to change my career path from IT to an environment related career. Taking few courses in Environmental Studies at De Anza College further confirmed that I had made the right decision to pursue Masters in Environmental Studies. My goal is to make an impact on the environment through educating society on current environmental issues, a better understanding of environmental policies and speaking up for environmental justice.\n\nFun fact is when I go hiking with my friends on the PG&E trail, we keep joking about if we encounter a mountain lion it will make us complete the hike in record time!\n\nSanjana Ramakrishna\n\nHello, I’m Sanjana. I come from India which is a land of villages. I was born and brought up in-the huge farms of my grandparents in India where Agriculture is the main occupation. My outdoor playing was all about cultivation activities along with my cousins. Apart from enjoying the sunshine and fresh air, the two blessings of God, I was also fascinated looking at the tall trees. I was fortunate enough to learn all the traditional methods of cultivation and growing trees at a very young age.\n\nI finished my schooling and bachelor’s degree in engineering in Bangalore, India. During the summer breaks of my undergraduate program, I had the great opportunity to work as Wildlife Educator for school kids in the thick forest of Karnataka, India. I also had the privilege to attend in-depth informative seminars and live sessions about various species and their origin which helped me realize my love for nature and its conservation. Once I realized where my heart lies, there was no looking back. I went on to attend various research programs related to wildlife species in national parks of India. I also worked as GIS intern in an NGO called “ATREE” where my focus was in preventing fire accidents in the Bandipur National Forest, India. The most memorable and exciting part of my student life was volunteering in the “SAVE THE FOREST” campaign team which eventually helped me in designing “FOREST MONITORING SYSTEMS” as a final year project of Engineering course.\n\nOn the personal front, I got married in 2021 and relocated to the United States as my husband works in Silicon Valley. Upon realizing my passion for nature, my husband encouraged me to explore new avenues to enhance my knowledge in Environmental Science. My hobbies are Dancing, gardening, and playing sports such as badminton, tennis. I also love exploring new hikes and outdoor sports.\n\nSaara Ranabhat\n\n“Happy wife, happy life.”\n\n“Healthy nature, happy creature.”\n\nHello Everyone! It’s me Saara Ranabhat from the country of Mount Everest, Nepal. Growing up in a country with extremely rich biodiversity, my passion for nature and environment exists since my childhood. This could be well reflected through my participation in youth clubs and doing plantations around the road along with weekly sanitation programs. Gradually, for my undergraduate program, I looked up for the courses which would keep me in close contact with nature and help me to get enlighten more on this. That’s how I ended up doing my undergraduate degree in forestry science and undergraduate thesis on climate change adaptation and community resilience. When I got enrolled for my undergraduate degree, a profound interest blossomed inside me for climate change.\n\nImmediately after my undergraduate degree, I worked as a sustainability intern for USAID funded Hariyoban Program followed by some short term consultant role for drafting local level government’s documents regarding climate change. Even before coming here (5 months ago), I used to work as a climate change research officer for WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) project in SNV (Netherland’s development organization) Nepal.\n\nWith all these facts, climate change is the field that I want to work on for my graduate thesis under the supervision of Dr. Costanza Rampini.\n\nHobbies: Travelling and hiking in the nature, watching movies, learning new things\n\nFun facts: I don’t want to leave anything incomplete, mostly movies and Netflix series. I could spend my entire day and night in order to finish that. And guess what…my family member has to stop me like a baby.\n\nJose Ruiz\n\nI graduated from San Jose State University in the spring of 2022, earning a degree in Environmental Studies with a minor in Sustainable Water Management. Having grown up in Alviso I have a loving passion for environmental conservation and restoration, particularly in water sustainability. Throughout my academic journey, I focused my research and coursework on various water management and conservation aspects. This included studying hydrology, water policy, and sustainable practices. My commitment to understanding and safeguarding water sources stems from a deep-seated appreciation for my hometown's natural beauty and ecological significance. Beyond academia, my interests are diverse and reflect my multifaceted personality. I love to travel and spend time with my family, science, math, history, and art, I find joy in continuous discovery. Nature holds a special place in my heart, offering solace and inspiration during outdoor adventures that reconnect me with the natural world and its delicate balance. Looking ahead, I am eager to apply my knowledge and experiences to contribute meaningfully to environmental conservation efforts. Whether through research, advocacy, or community engagement.\n\nFun facts about me: I'm the youngest of four siblings, toughened by my love for sports despite enduring multiple bone fractures, ligament tears, and muscle strains. I've explored 15 countries across three continents, with four road trips across Mexico under my belt. On my bucket list is to visit Australia, The Golopogos, and See the Northern Lights.\n\nSherilyn Reinhart\n\nI was born in rural Elk Grove and spent my teenage years in the small gold rush town of Placerville, CA. My four siblings and I spent the majority of our childhood outside tending goats, chasing roosters, fishing in the delta and seasonally hunting deer. (Naturally, I became a vegetarian and moved to San Francisco after high school). For the better part of a decade I worked, traveled, volunteered and attended community colleges before transferring to The University of Hawaii at Mānoa (UH), where I received a Bachelor of Science in Ethnobotany.\n\nWhile at UH, I worked in the Hynson Fungal Ecology Lab. It was through this experience that I saw myself as a young scientist for the first time. I assisted in elucidating which mycorrhizal partner the endemic Hawaiian orchid, Anoectochilus sandvicensis, is dependent upon for germination. Using the molecular skills I learned from this project, I applied for and was awarded a university grant to study the fungal symbiont of the Hawaiian lichen, Cladonia skottsbergii.\n\nAs a graduate student I hope to travel the mycelial web and gather the skills to become a well-rounded researcher and community educator. I’m interested in examining how common practices on organic farms impact and interact with the health of the soil ecosystem. I am particularly interested in exploring carbon farming as an avenue for sequestering atmospheric carbon.\n\nOutside of academia I am happiest hiking with my young child and husband, baking off a loaf of sourdough, raising plants from seed or having a nice cup of coffee. This past year I fell in love with Indigo dyeing and am now teaching myself how to quilt. I’m also trying to get back to my own rural roots.\n\nDiana Saavedra\n\nI like to begin my story with my parents’ for theirs is such a huge part of my own. Born and raised in Guatemala, they were both forced to flee government corruption, poverty, and overall violence in the early 1980s. In 1983, they met in East Los Angeles where they soon got married and had three girls- me being the last born. My status as a first generation Guatemalan-American has always been very special to me and has shaped a big part of my identity and politics.\n\nIn 2017, I left sunny Southern California and moved to the Bay Area. Here, I earned my bachelor’s in Ethnic Studies with a concentration in Latinx Studies at CSUEB. I fell in love with my studies for it allowed me to gain an understanding of the effects and dynamics of various social issues.\n\nI am a firm believer that environmental problems and social problems are interlaced, thus cannot be separated. Consequently, I have become passionate about advocating for the most vulnerable communities and their local environments. And so, I am pursuing a M.S. in Environmental Studies at SJSU. My research interests include working with people who are directly affected by their rapidly changing environments and ho"
