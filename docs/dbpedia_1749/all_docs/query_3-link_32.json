Alongside architects Jennifer Bonner and Christian Stayner, Barnes leads a multidisciplinary team to respond to the challenges presented by climate change and spatial inequalities in the American context, shaping an approach grounded in experimentation and reparative construction methods. Putting under-resourced communities front and center, their hands-on, research-led practice has seen the construction of arts centers and community spaces across the USA, designing in service of social transformation by raising local voices.\n\nNiklas Bildstein Zaar\n\nFounded by Niklas Bildstein Zaar and Andrea Faraguna in 2017, SUB designs in the synthesis of research, technology and architecture. A team drawn from across disciplines and cultures, the office aims to simultaneously address scales spanning time and space, putting into contact digital media and physical materials to test the bounds of how we experience the world. Bringing this investigation to collaborative projects in fashion, music and art, SUB aims to develop a worldbuilding language that translates sociocultural phenomena into sensorial environments. SUB is the innovation behind the Balenciaga Architecture Program—from the ‘Raw Architecture’ of its flagship stores, to the absorptive atmospheres of its shows—and recently designed the apocalyptic stage set for Travis Scott’s Pompeii amphitheater performance.\n\nJoe Christa Giraso\n\nJoe Christa Giraso is a Landscape Designer at MASS: an international design group on a mission to research, build and advocate an architecture that promotes social justice and projects new possibilities for the future. At the Rwanda Institute of Conservation Agriculture—a young university leading the future of sustainable agriculture in Gashora, Rwanda—MASS adopted its landscape approach from the curriculum. Through the conservation and restoration of the surrounding Savannah woodlands, the team is aiming to support agricultural practice in symbiosis with native species, nurturing a relationship to landscape rooted in the interconnection of ecological, animal and human health.\n\nYU KONGJIAN\n\nSince proposing the idea of a ‘sponge city’ in 2013, Professor Kongjian Yu has received global recognition for his research into urban flooding and climate adaptation strategies. As principal designer of Turenscape, a world-renowned practice reshaping the disciplines of landscape and urban design, Yu brings these principles into practice, tending to natural hydrological systems to design more resilient cities. Building on ancient teachings and traditional land practices to reconnect people to the earth, Turenscape re-approaches landscape architecture as a conservation practice, presenting opportunities to steward the environment for future generations. The practice was awarded the World Landscape of the Year Prize in 2015 and 2017.\n\nEmanuele Coccia\n\nEmanuele Coccia is a philosopher and associate professor at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris. Through his inquiries across media, collaborating with photographers, curators, designers and artists, Coccia has often examined the materiality of the contemporary world, traversing nature, urban space and fashion, writing an aesthetics for the Anthropocene Era. In his latest book, The Philosophy of the Home, Coccia meditates on a familiar concept—the domestic—to deconstruct the outdated assumptions built into our homes, emphasizing the need for the architecture we practice today to respond to emerging forms of living together.\n\nBéATRICE GRENIER\n\nBéatrice Grenier is a curator and writer based in Paris. Currently the Director of Curatorial Affairs at Fondation Cartier pour l’art contemporain, Grenier writes about global contemporary architecture and museums. Prior, she was Content Strategy consultant for Google Arts and Culture in China and between 2015-2019, she oversaw the realization of large-scale institutional projects by internationally acclaimed artist Cai Guo-Qiang. Grenier serves as the Paris desk editor of ArtAsiaPacific. She is the co-author of Tashkent. A Modernist Capital, and her forthcoming book The Architecture of Art will be published in 2025. Through her work and writing, Grenier has been interested in architecture as what allows art to exist in space, or take root in the urban and non-urban landscape.\n\nNguyễn Hà\n\nNguyễn Hà,founded ARB Architects Vietnam in 2009. Based in Hanoi, the practice aspires to create an architecture that leads people to serenity, allowing ritual and tradition to enter into modern life. A collaboration with acclaimed folk artist Xuân Hinh, the Đạo Mẫu Museum and Temple is a poetic interpretation of local material histories on an orchard plot outside the Vietnamese capital. Reconciling traditional construction with contemporary form, the temple bears witness to the urbanization of rural landscapes in Vietnam, while standing to preserve a threatened cultural heritage. Hà received the Moira Gemmill Prize for Emerging Architecture for the project in 2024.\n\nJakob Kudsk Steensen\n\nMae-ling Lokko\n\nMae-ling Lokko is a Ghanaian-Filipino designer and architectural scientist, and an assistant professor at the Yale School of Architecture.

Set to open its doors in 2025, the Lucas Museum will be the first museum centered on the power of visual storytelling. Embracing art forms across media, cultures, places, and times, and considering the relevance of museums in the present, this unprecedented re-imagination of what a cultural institution can be aims to create a space where art can bring people closer, and connect them to the world beyond its walls.\n\nSAMEEP PADORA\n\nSameep Padora is the founding principal of Sameep Padora and Associates (sP+a). Across an award-winning portfolio, the Mumbai-based practice has established an approach that foregrounds context and collaboration, aiming to expand the definition of ‘preservation’ to allow tradition to evolve. At Hampi Art Labs, a world-class arts center sited among the ancient ruins of the Hampi UNESCO World Heritage Site in south India, Padora draws an architecture from the landscape, creating flowing spaces for exhibition, craft and learning, while heeding the cultural lineage of its location. Alongside his practice, Padora has been experimenting in scaling 3D-printing technologies to mass-produce affordable housing, developing urban research from his dedicated not-for-profit, sPare. Padora is currently Dean of the Faculty of Architecture at the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology in Ahmedabad, India\n\nNeri&Hu\n\nLyndon Neri and Rossana Hu formed Neri&Hu Design and Research Office in 2004. Based in Shanghai, the practice has gained international recognition for the tactile minimalist architecture of its cultural projects. Spanning master planning, architecture, and furniture and product design, its approach draws on various disciplines to provide experiences that enrich contemporary living through their connection to a collective past. The extension to the Qujiang Museum of Fine Arts was envisaged as a source of illumination for the city of Xi’an, in China. Commissioned to accommodate the museum’s expanded cultural and commercial programmes, the aimed to minimize the impact of the new construction through its massing, floating a red stone lantern above the entrance as a durable symbol of the city’s social histories.\n\nALEXIS SABLONE\n\nAlexis Sablone is an architect, designer and multidisciplinary artist—and an Olympic skateboarder. Drawing on decades spent on a board, their practice investigates the social codes that govern public space to test how urban design can strengthen the social fabric of our cities. Experimenting across materials and construction technologies, their large-scale, ‘skateable’ sculptures encourage the creative mis-use of public space, hoping to invite a wide spectrum of communities to share stewardship of our cities. Currently under construction, their most recent project, Sun Seed, is at once sculpture and square, offering a space where skaters and non-skaters alike can play, wonder and gather in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nlisa switkin\n\nLisa is a Partner at Field Operations, a leading-edge landscape architecture and urban design practice, where she leads many of the firm’s complex public realm projects.

The imperial war museum commission, I saw the world end (2020) invited viewers to engage simultaneously with opposing perspectives while the monumental 360 degree sculpture memory palace (2019) mapped shifts in human perspective over 73 millennia as a reminder that we have achieved profound alterations in our behaviour and mindset in the past, and we can do so once again in response to the threat of extinction.\n\nalice rawsthorn\n\nRawsthorn is one of the Design Champions for the Young Climate Prize, and gave a presentation to our inaugural cohort about the importance of storytelling, in which she presented Design Emergency—the platform she founded with Paola Antonelli to help raise awareness of how design can help to solve the climate crisis.\n\ntatiana bilbao\n\nResearch Center on the Sea of Cortes\n\nA new project by Tatiana Bilbao on the Sea of Cortes stems from the understanding that human beings do not control nature, but rather we only constitute a fraction of it, thus we must find a way to reconnect symbiotically with our environment. Conceived as a ruin (past or future) that was invaded by nature and has left behind a window into another world, the project serves as an educational and research center for one of the richest and most diverse ecosystems in the world.\n\nJohn Paino\n\nThe Last of Us\n\nJohn Paino is the production designer of The Last of Us, a post-apocalyptic show that has\n\ngripped audiences since it premiered on HBO in January. Paino is a critically acclaimed production designer who has been awardnominated for his work on TV shows including The Morning Show, Big Little Lies, and Sharp Objects.\n\njoseph zeal henry\n\nSOUND ADVICE\n\nSOUND ADVICE is an experimental spatial practice that foreground narratives and culture critical to designing a more progressive and plural urban environment. This talk will explore how this process is advocating and creating alternative spatial visions of the future.\n\nriver claure\n\nWarawar Wawa (Son of the Stars)\n\nThe work of Bolivian visual artist River Claure revolves around three axes: Identity, Imagination, and Territory. Claure works using photography, with a practice that extends to sculpture and video. Explaining the images as layered reflections of collective identities, Claure recontextualized the beloved tale of The Little Prince in the Bolivian Andes. Entitled “Warawar Wawa“ (Son of the Stars), the result is a range of images that are a poetic, almost whimsical exposé of cultural juxtaposition.\n\npirjo haikola\n\nUrchin Corals\n\nFor Dr. Pirjo Haikola, sea urchins, corals and marine ecosystems are stakeholders and clients. In this talk she discusses her more-than-human and regenerative design practice, spanning from exhibitions and events aiming to increase ocean literacy, to collaborating in marine conservation projects through design and material innovation.\n\nYoung Climate Prize Winners\n\nPresenting at The World Around Summit will be three winners of the inaugural Young Climate Prize: the winner of the Young Climate Designer, Young Climate Voice and Young Climate Visionary awards.\n\ntosin oshinowo\n\nCommunity for Displaced Peoples\n\nLagos-based Nigerian architect, designer, and curator of the 2023 Sharjah Architecture Triennial - Tosin Oshinowo is renowned for insights into socially-responsive approaches to urbanism and design. In her talk, she will address the importance of considering context in design and embracing local solutions, which have roots in often overlooked techniques and traditions that have been with us for centuries. She questions how these techniques and ways of understanding the world from the global south can lend themselves as solutions to the global challenges posed by resource extraction and climate change.\n\nleong leong\n\nRay Philly\n\nRecent work by Leong Leong that explores new models of urban living reconfiguring the intersections of art, community, and culture.\n\nFundación organizmo\n\nCasa de Pensamiento\n\nA landmark of the fabric of indigenous communities to join in conversations of observation and communication, a maloka, or large communal dwelling, is an architectural experiential designation of the cultivated female vernacular found in south-america. Ana Maria and her team at Organizmo expand upon the ideas of these traditional structures by empowering women and the local community in re-utilizing the natural threads of their surroundings to create intimate moments of networking for the Tenjo Cundinamarca community.\n\nfernando laposse\n\nConflict Avocados\n\nA product designer by trade, Fernando Laposse specialises in transforming natural materials into elegant design pieces, often working with under-utilised plant fibers traditional to Mexico such as sisal, loofah and corn leaves. His work is informed by research into these materials and their historical and cultural ties to a particular location and its people. Laposse often works with indigenous communities in his native Mexico to create local employment opportunities and raise awareness about the challenges they face in a globalising world.\n\nConflict Avocados, Laposse’s most ambitious project to date, explores the troubled ethics behind avocado production in Mexico, the world's largest producer and exporter of the fruit. Focusing on town of Cherán in the state of Michoacan, Laposse recounts through furniture, objects, film and a major 40m long narrative textile – the Cherán Tapestry – the struggle by local women to defend their home from criminal cartels and preserve their forest ecosystem, the last remnant habitat of the migratory Emperor Butterfly. US demand for avocados is driving illegal forest clearing, biodiversity loss and violence. Laposse offers an optimistic perspective where local solidarity, artisanal craft and ecology work together to rebalance the situation.\n\nTAYYŪN\n\nDesert Forest\n\nTAYYŪN, a research studio based in Amman, Jordan which explores the interconnectivity of ecology and the human condition. With growing climate concerns and deforestation, “there needs to be a return to place making beyond the physicality of buildings,” says TAYYŪN’s Deema Assaf (founder). Deema’s research is an \"ode to the natives, the indigenous species of her land, and the ancient rulers cultivators of the Jordanian landscape.\"\n\nkyong park\n\n2086: Together How?\n\n“2086: Together How?” in the Korean Pavilion in the Venice Architecture Biennale 20023 will\n\nquestion our Faustian ideology of progress and how we have sought unlimited material\n\npleasure through industrialization, colonization, and globalization, and why the great\n\nadvancement in our civilization is taking us closer to extinction than to our perfection that it\n\npromised?
