        "text": "Denali is an ecologist, ceramicist, and Great Basin enthusiast. She is a West Coast native and graduated from the University of Nevada Reno with a bachelor’s degree in biology. She has a background in entomology and molecular research labs, but over the past four years has discovered a love for field work and botany. Denali loves surveying vegetation in the wilderness, and her preferred type of field work is when there is no cell phone reception for many days at a time.\n\nSean is a lead field botanist with the California Native Plant Society’s vegetation mapping effort in the Klamath-Siskiyou region. He has worked for several years in the Mojave, Great Basin, Snake River Plain, Middle Rockies, and Wyoming Basin conducting riparian assessments. Previously, he apprenticed with Dr. Barbara L. Wilson of the Carex Working Group while pursuing an undergraduate degree in Botany at Oregon State University.\n\nSean grew up in New York’s Hudson Highlands, where he developed a great affinity for wild things; later, he traveled extensively throughout the country. Today, he divides his time across the Americas exploring various cultural, biological, and geographic landscapes, and how notions of resilience are sustained and promoted both within and across these settings.\n\nTimothy is from San Diego and went to college at Cal Poly where he learned to love plants. Since graduating college, he has done botany work for the San Diego Zoo, BLM in Montana, and USFS in California. Most of his work has been done in grasslands."
