        "text": "Internships are short-term professional experiences with organizations. Most commonly, they are opportunities to build skills, gain experience, and develop your network in a specific field. Even for graduate students, internships have become a critical building block of resumes for positions in industry, nonprofits, and government. This is because hiring managers want to see that you applied your graduate training in a practical manner and that you have experience in the environment in which you seek to work after graduate school. Even in academia, where internships are less integral, hands-on experiences can be a useful way to build complementary skills in administration or advising.\n\nUChicagoGRAD’s flagship program, the Advance Internship Program, enables students to create meaningful, skill-building internships that make use of their graduate training, and offers a limited number of $6,000 stipends to pursue these opportunities.\n\nSet up a meeting with your UChicagoGRAD career advisor to discern what internship opportunities may be right for you, and how to find and apply to them.\n\nUChicago offers multiple resources for locating, applying for, and funding internships. Please refer to the GRAD Guide to Finding an Internship in the GRAD Gargoyle Content Library.\n\nStudents interested in building experience in higher education administration should consider UChicagoGRAD’s Credential in Higher Education Administration, a co-curricular professional development program that supports aspiring college and university administrators.\n\nThe Master’s Advance internship program invites UChicago master’s students to create a 300-hour summer internship with an organization of their choosing. The internship should be otherwise unfunded, and it should provide the intern with new professional skills. Master’s Advance internships are open to international students and can take place anywhere in the world. Successful applicants will receive a $6,000 stipend to support their pursuit of the opportunity.\n\nThe Master’s Advance program prioritizes applicants who design customized, project-based internships. Project-based internships are those that engage the intern in a coherent set of responsibilities that progressively build toward a specific deliverable or outcome. Internships involving unrelated, ad-hoc tasks are not considered project-based opportunities. The program supports internship projects at organizations with which the applicant has had no significant involvement. For more details, attend the information session hosted each January.\n\nInternship Hours and Timing\n\nInternships must be 300 hours in duration and occur during Summer Quarter. Students and their host organizations collaborate to determine exact weekly hours and beginning and end dates for the internship.\n\nEligibility for Master’s Advance\n\nThe program is open to master’s students in full-time, degree-granting academic programs at the University of Chicago. Both domestic and international students are eligible. If you graduate in Spring Quarter, your internship can occur in the summer following your graduation. UChicagoGRAD internship funding is available once during your time at UChicago. Currently, master’s students in professional schools (Chicago Booth, the Crown School of Social Work, Policy and Practice, the Harris School of Public Policy, the Law School, and the Pritzker School of Medicine) are ineligible.\n\nNon-Transferability of Funding\n\nMaster’s Advance funding is intended to support the specific internship experience described in the application materials. While students may adjust their internship projects, they may not change host organizations after submitting their applications.\n\nApplication Deadline\n\nApplications are due at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on February 28. Students may only submit one application.\n\nThe Process\n\nStep 1: Develop a Project with Coaching from UChicagoGRAD\n\nStudents who are interested in Master’s Advance are encouraged to set up a meeting with their UChicagoGRAD career advisor. Your advisor will help you reflect on your career goals, craft an outreach strategy, and develop a realistic project. Your advisor can also provide feedback on your application materials. If you are an international student, please familiarize yourself with the work authorization processes and connect with the Office for International Affairs if additional support is needed.\n\nStep 2: Submit Your Application\n\nSubmit (1) an application letter, (2) a resume, and (3) your host’s confirmation of the internship to UChicagoGRAD by February 28 at 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Use the GRAD Gargoyle Job and Internship board posting (search for “77909”) to submit your application.\n\nA field-appropriate, one-page resume is required.\n\nApplication Letter. Prepare a two-page, single-spaced letter addressed to UChicagoGRAD.\n\nDiscuss your academic work and its connection to the internship project.\n\nDescribe the host organization, including your supervisor’s name.\n\nExplain the internship project, including your duties, timelines, and deliverables.\n\nClarify how the project will help you develop new skills and advance your career.\n\nInternship Confirmation. Submit an email or letter from your host that confirms your internship project. This short note should include your name, your supervisor’s name, and the internship project you would be pursuing.\n\nStep 3: Receive a Decision\n\nA selection committee will assess applications and select awardees. UChicagoGRAD will then notify awardees, connect with their host organizations, and contact applicants’ Deans of Students to confirm that applicants are in good academic standing. Awardees must agree to the program conditions before internship funding is confirmed.\n\nStep 4: Complete Your Internship and Program Requirements\n\nAwardees begin their internships after attending a UChicagoGRAD prep session. Upon completion of the internship, awardees must respond to a survey and be available to mentor the following year’s interns.\n\nOther Funding Sources\n\nThe Master’s Advance program provides financial support for students who are participating in otherwise unpaid (or underpaid) opportunities. Applicants are encouraged to consider other potential funding sources to support an internship, including those available from the host organization. UChicagoGRAD will only award a stipend that brings the total support for this experience up to $6000. This condition does not include regular student support that you may receive unrelated to this internship. It does apply to funds supplied directly by the host or by another granting unit that are intended to support this experience. If the amount awarded from another source is less than $6000, UChicagoGRAD will award a stipend for the difference between these awards.\n\nThe PhD Advance internship program invites UChicago PhD students to create a 300-hour internship with an organization of their choosing. The internship should be otherwise unfunded, and it should provide the intern with new professional skills. PhD Advance internships are open to international students and can take place anywhere in the world. Successful applicants will receive a $6,000 stipend to support their pursuit of the opportunity.\n\nThe PhD Advance program prioritizes applicants who design customized, project-based internships. Project-based internships are those that engage the intern in a coherent set of responsibilities that progressively build toward a specific deliverable or outcome. Internships involving unrelated, ad-hoc tasks are not considered project-based opportunities. The program supports internship projects at organizations with which the applicant has had no significant involvement. For more details, attend the information session hosted each January.\n\nInternship Hours and Timing\n\nInternships must be 300 hours in duration. Students and their host organizations collaborate to determine exact weekly hours and beginning and end dates for the internship. Internships can take place at any time of the year.\n\nUChicago PhD students can receive UChicagoGRAD internship funding twice during their time at UChicago. We do not recommend the pursuit of internships in the first two years of a doctoral program, unless the applicant is leaving their PhD program. Applicants should work with their UChicagoGRAD career advisor and academic department to determine the optimal timing for an internship given degree requirements and the applicant’s career goals. Internships that occur during or immediately following a student’s departure from UChicago are likely the most optimal, as they send an important signal to potential employers about an applicant’s professional trajectory.\n\nEligibility for PhD Advance\n\nThe program is open to doctoral students in full-time, degree-granting academic programs at the University of Chicago. Both domestic and international students are eligible. Participation may require approval from an applicant’s Dean of Students.\n\nTypically, Advance internship funding is not available to doctoral students in their first year of the program. Internship funding is available to those who decide not to continue in their program. Internships can occur in the quarter after the student leaves UChicago. In this case, UChicagoGRAD must receive the internship application eight weeks prior to the student’s departure.\n\nNon-Transferability of Funding\n\nPhD Advance funding is intended to support the specific internship experience described in the application materials. While students may adjust their internship projects, they may not change host organizations after submitting their applications.\n\nApplication Deadline\n\nApplications are accepted on a rolling basis. PhD students can apply for internship funding from UChicagoGRAD twice during their time at UChicago. If the student intends to leave UChicago, their application must be received eight weeks before the student’s departure.\n\nThe Process\n\nStep 1: Develop a Project with Coaching from UChicagoGRAD\n\nStudents who are interested in PhD Advance should set up a meeting with their UChicagoGRAD career advisor. Your advisor will help you reflect on your career goals, craft an outreach strategy, and develop a realistic project. Your advisor can also provide feedback on your application materials. If you are an international student, please familiarize yourself with the work authorization processes and connect with the Office for International Affairs if additional support is needed.\n\nStep 2: Submit Your Application\n\nTo submit your application, complete the Pathways PhD Advance module on GRAD Gargoyle. You will be prompted to submit your resume or CV, application letter, and internship confirmation.\n\nResume or CV. A field-appropriate, one-page resume or a CV is required.\n\nApplication Letter. Prepare a two-page, single-spaced letter addressed to UChicagoGRAD.\n\nDiscuss your academic work and its connection to the internship project.\n\nDescribe the host organization, including your supervisor’s name.\n\nExplain the internship project, including your duties, timelines, and deliverables.\n\nClarify how the project will help you develop new skills and advance your career.\n\nInternship Confirmation. Submit an email or letter from your host that confirms your internship project. This short note should include your name, your supervisor’s name, and the internship project you would be pursuing.\n\nStep 3: Receive a Decision\n\nA selection committee will assess applications and select awardees.

The award is made possible by a generous donation from alumna Danette Gentile Kauffman (M.A. Humanities 1969). The award does not require a specialized application process; all applicants from the Humanities Division are automatically be considered for this prize.\n\n2020 Winner: Julia Rossi, Ph.D. student in English Language and Literature\n\nWith the support of Danette Gentile Kauffman, I will be completing an internship this year with The Odyssey Project – a free, college-credit earning humanities course for income-eligible adults with limited or no access to higher education. Due to the ongoing public health crisis, The Odyssey Project’s programming will take place online for most (if not all) of this year. My internship will be geared toward encouraging a sense of intellectual community for students and alumni during this difficult and isolating time. I will be responsible for planning, designing, and editing a publication to mark the 20th anniversary of The Odyssey Project, which will feature stories, poems, and essays written by current students and alumni. I am also excited to work directly with students as a tutor, helping them to improve their academic writing and to formulate their papers.\n\n2019 Winner: David Hogue, Ph.D. student in East Asian Languages and Civilizations\n\nWith the support of Danette Gentile Kauffman, I interned at the Wuhan University Center of Bamboo and Silk Manuscripts, which operates an English-language academic journal that publishes leading research in the field of early Chinese excavated texts. In my internship, I have served as an academic linguist and editorial services support staff member, translating Chinese-language articles into English for publication in the Center’s peer-reviewed journal, “Bamboo and Silk.”\n\n2018 Winner: Simone Levine, M.A. student in Humanities\n\n“With the support of Danette Gentile Kauffman, my GGI internship provided me with the opportunity to be involved in an exhibition catalog published by the Smart Museum of Art. The catalog was published for the occasion of the exhibition The Allure of Matter: Material Art from China, curated by Professor Wu Hung with Orianna Cacchione. I wrote three artist profiles for the publication, for was credited as a contributor. My GGI Internship marked the first time I have undertaken comprehensive research and historical writing on contemporary Chinese art outside of my studies. Most importantly, the internship enabled me to begin making scholarly contributions in the art world, the field in which I plan to invest myself professionally.”\n\n2018 Winner: Charlotte Saul, Ph.D. student in English Language and Literature\n\n“With the support of Danette Gentile Kauffman, I completed a research-based curatorial internship at Chatsworth House, engaging specifically with the Devonshire Collection and its group of rare 17th-century court masque designs. Only half of the drawings’ catalog entries had been recently revised, so my task was to update the catalog entries for the remaining drawings, writing physical descriptions and critical narratives for each object. This internship gave me the opportunity to learn how to best work with a collections management system used by many institutions, and a chance to work directly with unique archival materials; as a student of literary and visual culture, this was a particularly meaningful experience.”\n\nPhillip N. Norton GGI Internship\n\nThe Norton award is presented to an outstanding winner from the Physical Sciences Division. The award is made possible by a generous donation from alumnus Phillip N. Norton (Ph.D. Statistics 1988). The award does not require a specialized application process; all applicants from PSD are automatically be considered for this prize.\n\n2021 Winner: George Bi, M.S. Student in Analytics\n\n“Through the generous support of the Phillip N. Norton GGI internship, I spent my summer internship in China with Red Fuji, a company focusing on environmental-friendly raw materials house decoration, as a data scientist. Throughout the internship, I utilized my data science mindset to solve traditional business problem in the house decoration industry. By the end of the internship, I built a database for the company, a business visualization report for management board and an algorithm that clustered housing characteristics. I really appreciate this internship opportunity which helped me apply theoretical knowledge into practice and have a better understanding on how to be a better data scientist and which area I should focus more on.”\n\n2020 Winner: Bowen Bao, M.S. Student in Computer Science\n\n“With the support of the Phillip N. Norton GGI Internship, I spent my summer in the Department of Medicine in the Section of Computational Biomedicine and Biomedical Data Science. I helped develop Heart Clinical Guidelines, a web application meant to support doctors and biomedical researchers to search for guidelines and data supplements used in diagnosing cardiovascular disease, currently a manual process in the healthcare industry. I parsed PDF charts from XML to JSON and worked on a Node.js web application to make the guidelines searchable. The internship gave me a chance to dig deeper into algorithmic thinking and allowed me to learn new tools to do web development.”\n\n2019 Winner: Matthew Shin, M.S. student in Computational and Applied Mathematics\n\n“With the support of the Phillip N. Norton GGI Internship, I spent the summer abroad in England studying under Dr. Ruth Baker of the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford. The research group at the Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology probes modern problems in biology using techniques from applied mathematics. In particular, I considered methods from stochastic processes and statistical mechanics to model cell dynamics (such as stem cell migration) with simulations and PDEs. This opportunity provided me a unique and didactic introduction to the world of academic research, tailored to my particular interest in quantitative biological models. I come away from the experience with a greater understanding of the tools required and eagerness to tackle large scientific questions through mathematics.”\n\n2018 Winner: Erin Lipman, M.S. student in Statistics\n\n“Through the generous support of the Phillip N. Norton GGI internship, I spent my summer interning with Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) in San Francisco, CA. HRDAG is a non-profit organization that uses rigorous and objective statistical science to to investigate human rights abuses worldwide. At HRDAG I worked on issues of racial bias in the criminal justice system, in particular concerning the use of automated risk assessment systems for pretrial detention decisions. The experience was invaluable in building my data science skills and giving me a clear picture of my career path forward as a statistician concerned with issue of human rights and fairness.”"
