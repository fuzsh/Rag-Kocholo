        "text": "Vietnam on Film and Television: Documentaries in the Library of Congress\n\nCompiled by Victoria E. Johnson Jump to: Introduction | List of Films | Embassy of South Vietnam Collection | Index | Guidelines for Viewing Films and Videotapes\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is a compilation of film and television documentaries about the Vietnam War and related subjects held in the collections of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress.\n\nAlthough not comprehensive, it includes many, if not most, of the relevant titles held in the Division in July 1989. It is hoped that the list will be expanded periodically as other titles are discovered and new titles acquired. A large percentage of the works were received as copyright deposits. Other sources include purchase, gift, and off-air videotaping. The list includes documentaries only, not dramatic films. The Division's collections are also rich in fiction films about the Vietnam War, but that is the subject for another publication. Also excluded are television news broadcasts.\n\nThe entries are arranged alphabetically by the title of the work. Numbers expressed in digits precede letters and therefore 60 MINUTES precedes ABC SCOPE. Television series make up a large portion of the list. Particularly helpful in pulling together series material was Daniel Einstein's book, Special edition: a guide to network television documentary series and special news reports, 1955-1979 (Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1987).\n\nWithin the series, entries are arranged in one of two ways:\n\n1) chronologically by date or sequential episode number. see: 60 MINUTES VIETNAM: A TELEVISION HISTORY VIETNAM WEEKLY REVIEW 2) alphabetically by episode title or by name of guest. see: ABC SCOPE: THE VIETNAM WAR CBS NEWS SPECIAL REPORT MEET THE PRESS\n\nCross references are made from episode titles to series titles. An exception is MEET THE PRESS. The name of the guest is not considered an episode title, but each is included in the index. Each entry includes title (in boldface), collection, production company, year of release, minimal production credits, telecast date (if applicable), copyright information (if available), physical description, shelf location number (in boldface), and a brief summary. The copyright statement includes copyright claimant, date of registration, and registration number. In the first element of the line of physical description, \"c\" signifies videocassette or videoreel, and \"r\" signifies film reel.\n\nAn interesting and unique collection, the Embassy of South Vietnam Collection, is separately described in Appendix 1 (p. 73).\n\nThe films and videotapes in the Library's collections are not available for loan but may be viewed at the Library by researchers by advance appointment. For further information, see Appendix 2: Guidelines for Viewing Films and Videotapes (p. 74), or write to: Reference Librarian; Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division; Library of Congress; Washington, DC 20540; Tel: (202) 707-1000.\n\nThis filmography of about 400 works was compiled by Victoria Johnson, a cinema studies and political science student from the University of Illinois, during an eight-week internship in June-July 1989. That Ms. Johnson was able to accomplish so much in so brief a time is a tribute to her versatility, intelligence and hard work. Because our internal catalogs generally lack subject access and content descriptions, she had to pull this material together from many disparate sources and actually viewed a number of works to verify data. She did a splendid job and we are grateful. Thanks are also due to our reference librarian, Sam Brylawski, who provided valuable technical assistance throughout the project, which was compiled on a personal computer using WordPerfect 5.0 software.\n\nPatrick J.
