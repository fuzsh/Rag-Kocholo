        "text": "The Disrupters, the Disrupted, and the Disrupted Disrupters\n\n47th Annual Entertainment Symposium\n\nWed May 31 | Wed June 7 | Fri June 9\n\nKeynote Speaker: Bela Bajaria, Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nFor a decade or more, one of the dominant narratives in the entertainment industry has been the disruption of the legacy players and their businesses by the arrival of deep-pocketed, norm-breaking tech companies. But in the last few years, even these giants have weathered stock price plunges, endured labor conflict as the sequel to a global pandemic and faced the transformative potential of artificial intelligence. This year's Entertainment Symposium will explore how these disruptions have led to an ongoing transformation in traditional business models, production methods, and labor markets, while also highlighting key areas of law. Over the course of the program, an array of distinguished executives, entrepreneurs, attorneys and academics will examine how the entertainment industry's major players have adapted (or failed to adapt) to this challenging and rapidly changing business environment and consider what upstarts will thrive – and what legacy players will survive – in the industry's next phase.\n\nUCLA School of Law is a State Bar of California approved MCLE provider. By attending all three (3) sessions, you may earn Minimum Continuing Legal Education credit in the amount of up to 6.25 total credits (4.25 hours of general credit, 1 hour of elimination of bias credit, and 1 hour of legal ethics credit).\n\nWed May 31, 2023\n\nDay 1 Syllabus Preview\n\nDean's Remarks\n\nPresenter:\n\nDean Russell Korobkin, Interim Dean and Richard C. Maxwell Distinguished Professor of Law, UCLA School of Law\n\nAfter Covid: The Industry Resets\n\nThree and a half years after Covid’s arrival, the industry works to find its footing again. This year’s opening session sets the stage with the Symposium’s annual status report exploring box office recovery, streaming, and digitally driven advertising. This presentation will explore how streaming maturity and higher interest rates are leading to an end of the “golden age of production,” previously fueled by capital and emphasis on growth over profits. It will consider the evolving role theatricals can play in support of streaming, along with a study of the increased divergence between box office success and best picture honorees. It will also explore the many varied definitions of new…and not so new…FAST services. And it will consider these as factors contributing to today’s extremely difficult labor environment.\n\nPresenter:\n\nTom Wolzien, Chairman, Wolzien LLC\n\nDearly Departed: A Review of the Legal and Industry Implications of the Entertainment Job Market\n\nWith the widely publicized entertainment layoffs and changing job market, attorneys and executives are faced navigating issues including severance, high level employment agreements and compliance with labor laws. The navigation of these issues within the entertainment industry – from recruitment to termination – also requires a nuanced understanding of industry norms. This panel of experts will help deconstruct the legal and market realities of the dearly departed while also considering how bias can impact the process of hiring, firing and retaining a diverse pool of employees.\n\nModerator:\n\nAzi Amirteymoori, Owner/Employment Attorney/Senior HR Consultant, 403 Ops Consulting\n\nPanelists:\n\nConnie L. Chen, Principal, Jackson Lewis P.C.\n\nJoanna Sucherman, Owner, JLS Media\n\nAmanda N.

Mitchell Panel on Ethics and Entertainment\n\nAttorneys that practice in entertainment can be a relatively small and insular group, negotiating with the same people and companies deal after deal. Attorneys may represent multiple parties on the same side of a transaction including the writer, director, showrunner; and/or cast members on a particular film or television project. These types of repeated and intertwined representations often raise ethical issues. This panel will focus on providing guidance to attorneys in the entertainment industry on complying with their obligations pursuant to the California Rules of Professional Conduct, including advice when an attorney is faced with representing two or more clients on a deal, when clients’ interests are ostensibly aligned but become adverse, and the pitfalls of representing various clients in repeated transactions with the same party. It will offer advice on how to avoid stepping over the line and when it may be time to withdraw. Finally, it will look at what happens and explore what to do if faced with a malpractice suit or disciplinary proceedings in this area.\n\nModerator:\n\nScott L. Cummings, Professor of Law and Robert Henigson Professor of Legal Ethics, UCLA School of Law\n\nPanelists:\n\nAmy L. Bomse, Partner, Rogers Joseph O’Donnell\n\nJeffrey M. Davidson, Partner, Covington & Burling\n\nSally C. James, Partner, Greenberg Glusker\n\nNew Frontiers: How Artificial Intelligence Presents New Opportunities (and Risks) for the Entertainment Industry\n\nArtificial Intelligence and machine learning has had a swift impact on society and more particularly, the entertainment industry. Increasingly powerful and sophisticated generative AI presents new opportunities for creators, talent, and studios but also numerous risks for these stakeholders. From copyright questions to labor rights, from virtual production spaces to posthumous deepfakes, it is a time of excitement and trepidation. This panel will discuss these issues from a variety of perspectives, staying abreast of the most recent technological and legal developments in this fast-moving space.\n\nModerator:\n\nNathaniel Bach, Partner, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP\n\nPanelists:\n\nTravis Cloyd, CEO, Worldwide XR, Global Futurist, Thunderbird School of Global Management\n\nTed Schilowitz, Futurist-in-Residence, Paramount\n\nP.J.

A few recent examples include the films TILL and AIR and the limited series DOPESICK, PAM & TOMMY and THE DROPOUT. Studios and production companies frequently go out of their way to acquire an individual’s “life rights” or partner with celebrities to tell their stories. What is the price of a celebrity’s name, likeness and life rights? Are life rights necessary to tell someone’s story? This panel will explore financial and other issues surrounding the production of fictionalized true stories and content inspired by true events. The panel will also examine the world of celebrity endorsements, the inherent risks in talent lending their names to promote products or services, and how to avoid costly mistakes that can damage a celebrity’s reputation or brand in the market.\n\nModerator:\n\nHillary Bibicoff, Of Counsel, Pierce Law Group LLP\n\nPanelists:\n\nLisa Callif, Partner, Donaldson Callif Perez, LLP\n\nAnn Brigid Clark, Shareholder, Greenburg Traurig\n\nKevin Vick, Partner, Jassy Vick Carolan LLP\n\nWhose IP Is It Anyway? Source Material and Underlying Rights in Film and TV\n\nSo many film and television shows today are based on underlying material. Whether a novel, blog, videogame or television format, literary and underlying rights deals are common in nearly every aspect of filmmaking and television production. This panel will examine issues surrounding source material agreements including granting and reserving rights, reversions when things don't go as planned, copyright termination and the management of a deceased author's estate that controls valuable copyright libraries.\n\nModerator:\n\nMatt Belloni, Founding Partner, Puck\n\nPanelists:\n\nMichael Grizzi, Executive Vice President, Motion Picture Legal, Paramount Pictures\n\nMichael Sherman, Partner, Reed Smith\n\nMichelle Weiner, Head of Books Department, Creative Artists Agency\n\nOn Popcorn and Purpose: When We Do More Than Entertain\n\nPresenter:\n\nDouglas Lichtman, Professor of Law and Faculty Director of Ziffren Institute for Media, Entertainment, Technology & Sports Law, UCLA School of Law\n\nKeynote\n\nBela Bajaria, Chief Content Officer, Netflix\n\nKen Ziffren, Partner & Co-Founder, Ziffren Brittenham LLP\n\nUCLA School of Law is a State Bar of California approved MCLE provider.

There is little question that these advancements will have a dramatic impact on our industry, but the scale and quality of that impact are being determined day-by-day in the marketplace. Does artificial intelligence offer the promise of unprecedented sophistication in business and creative decision making, or a perilous minefield of ethical, legal, and humanist concerns? Are non-fungible tokens the future of financing and monetizing content, or a fad that will fade when the market runs out of \"greater fools?\" These developments and others like them all have broad social implications beyond the world of entertainment. The 2022 Symposium will examine the ongoing collision among the technologies and business models of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, and will consider: will the entertainment industry find a way to coopt and transform these advancements for its own benefit, or will it instead find itself coopted and transformed by the evolving world around it?\n\nJune 8, 2022\n\nWeek 1 Syllabus Preview\n\nDean's Remarks\n\nPresenter:\n\nDean Jennifer L. Mnookin, Ralph and Shirley Shapiro Professor of Law, and Faculty Co-Director, PULSE @ UCLA Law (Program on Understanding Law, Science & Evidence), UCLA School of Law\n\nStreaming in a Time of War, Pestilence & Inflation\n\nTom Wolzien opens the annual industry review with his usual business and legal status report, including the financials for advertising, video delivery, broadband, mobile, box office, and streaming providers during Covid’s second year. Looking at the economy, Wolzien will explore the impact of high inflation on advertising and the historical box office. Touching on the Netflix crash and the need for ad-based VOD (AVOD) as a second revenue stream for subscription (SVOD) players, his report will compare “watchability” of some AVOD programs to those on ad-based linear services. Wolzien will discuss the merits and drawbacks of various business and legal strategies for streaming companies and will then pose the question whether the marketing by all SVOD players may be missing a key component, as he introduces the idea of Box Office Equivalency through an analysis of the 136 top streaming movies reported by Netflix last year.\n\nPresenter:\n\nTom Wolzien, Chairman, Wolzien LLC and The Video Call Center, LLC\n\nPearls and Pitfalls of NFTs in the Entertainment Industry\n\nWith their emergence as a multi-billion-dollar business, NFTs were bound to collide with the entertainment industry and bring about new opportunities along with associated perils. A conversation with a leading NFT influencer followed by a panel discussion with some of the legal and business minds immersed in NFTs will explore the vast opportunities NFTs bring to the entertainment industry and the costly mistakes that await those lacking careful planning and knowledgeable advisors. The panel will look at how NFTs are created, marketed, and sold, as well as trends in the market and on the NFT exchanges.\n\nModerator for Part 1 and Part 2:\n\nTom K.

By 2021, 80 million Americans reported consuming podcasts on at least a weekly basis. They have provided a much-needed outlet for deeply researched and reported journalism and revived the once-dead medium of the audio drama. More recently, podcasts have also become the subject of intense competitive bidding for valued adaptation rights, serving as the foundations of critically and commercially successful series such as Dirty John, Dr. Death, and The Dropout. This panel of distinguished operators, strategists, and dealmakers will explore the impact that film and television opportunities are having on podcasting, as well as the impact that podcasting is having on film and television, the dealmaking climate in podcast production and distribution as well as in film/television development and production, and the role that this fast-growing segment of the industry will play in the media landscape for years to come.\n\nModerator:\n\nDollie S. Bishop, President of Production and Creative Development, The Black Effect Podcast Network\n\nPanelists:\n\nJean Chi, Global Head of Business Affairs - Studio Content, Spotify\n\nJen Sargent, Chief Executive Officer, Wondery\n\nPat Shah, Head of Content Acquisition and Development, Audible\n\nJohn H. Mitchell Panel on Ethics and Entertainment\n\nAI, Avatars and Deep Fakes: Ethical and Legal Issues for the Entertainment Industry\n\nThis panel will explore the ethical and legal dimensions of the growing impact of Artificial Intelligence in the development of entertainment content. Among many questions, this panel will explore: Under what circumstances is it appropriate to use AI to create content that impersonates real people and events? What limitation, if any, does current law place on this AI-generated content? Should new law(s) be developed to address AI-generated content? And, most immediately, what do entertainment lawyers and executives need to know about AI to satisfy competency obligations? The Panel will discuss these issues as well as practice pitfalls and contract considerations entertainment lawyers and executives need to consider as the technology likely outpaces legal developments.\n\nModerator:\n\nDale Cohen, Director, UCLA Documentary Film Legal Clinic and Special Counsel, FRONTLINE\n\nPanelists:\n\nEriq Gardner, Founding Partner, Puck News\n\nJane Han, Global Creative Lead, ex-Meta\n\nAmy R.

But as the industry has evolved over the last decade, so too have the ambitions of and opportunities for premiere talent. The stars of today move and work freely across once-distinct media—they take on roles as producers and studio executives beyond solely servicing their own personal projects, and they cultivate lucrative opportunities outside of their 'core' entertainment careers. This panel of distinguished representatives and executives will explore the promise and perils facing talent in this vibrant marketplace, the key business and legal issues affecting the interests of major talent, and the roles their representatives and business partners play in facilitating and maximizing the ambitions of the stars of today who strive to be the moguls of tomorrow.\n\nModerator:\n\nKen Basin, Global Head of Business Operations, Riot Entertainment\n\nPanelists:\n\nCamrin Agin, Senior Vice President, Business & Legal Affairs, New Line Cinema\n\nMatthew M.

On the one hand, the global Covid-19 pandemic forced an unprecedented industry-wide shutdown of production activity, representing a rare lull in the \"Peak TV\"/\"Streaming Wars\" era. On the other hand, this year of global economic and social upheaval has dramatically accelerated several long-term trends affecting the industry, especially around corporate consolidation and the collapse of traditional exhibition and compensation models. The 2021 Symposium will look back on this year of unparalleled paralysis and progress, and look forward to what \"the new normal\" may look like in a post-pandemic industry. At the same time, it will explore how many of the year's most prominent and urgent issues -- from free speech to income inequality to the country’s national reckoning with race – are being experienced by and reflected within the entertainment industry. A timeless Hollywood adage is that, even in the face of adversity, \"the show must go on\"; but in 2020, the show went online, and the town will never be the same.\n\nJune 2, 2021\n\nDean's Remarks\n\nPresenter:\n\nJennifer L. Mnookin, Dean, Ralph and Shirley Shapiro Professor of Law, UCLA School of Law\n\n2020 to 2021: Apocalypse to Streaming Odyssey\n\nUS one day box office down to $4.00! Streaming subscribers hit record highs! Cable and satellite subscriber numbers crater! The Symposium begins with Tom Wolzien's Status Report to set the stage – it was an ugly year past, and we're looking to a year of recovery ahead. Many are asking, where's the growth? The more important question is, where's the potential growth? And where will the scars of the pandemic remain?\n\nWe're going to explore huge headline percentages from small numbers – when one-million percent increases from 2020 will look great, but mean almost nothing. We'll anticipate the next levels of broadband from Biden's Big Deal rural initiative – will it rival the New Deal's rural electrification? We'll watch as Elon Musk's low-earth-orbit broadband satellite trains reflect across the evening sky, and we'll explore at what price countries with broadband upside will allow streaming growth. We'll experience the impact on free speech as international producers face new pressures. We'll struggle with cable networks as their digital initiatives try to offset the fees and ad dollars crushed by reduced subscribers, and ask, if there is to be a post covid world, will the combination of streaming and in-person theatrical distribution actually increase the total spending by consumers and by distributors on content? If so, for how long?\n\nPresenter:\n\nTom Wolzien, Chairman, Wolzien LLC and The Video Call Center, LLC\n\nFrom Intent to Impact: How Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Make (Necessary) Business Sense\n\nThe entertainment industry is in a unique position to affect real and meaningful change in the area of DEI – both through the content it sells and by the organizations that make it available. New studies are highlighting the economic fallout from ignoring a more inclusive and equitable industry. The McKinsey & Company report included in the materials estimates the lost revenue opportunity in the film and TV industry alone to be roughly $10 billion annually; but like everything else in this business, successful execution is key. This panel features leaders within top organizations in our business who will share: (1) what DEI means to their organizations; (2) their approaches to addressing DEI on a macro industry level to a more micro level within their organizations; and (3) how success and impact is measured. As DEI is dramatically changing the entertainment industry, this panel is a must-attend for those ready to have an impact on diversity-related goals and their company's bottom line.\n\nModerator:\n\nCatrice Monson, Managing Director & Co-Founder, Right Size Media\n\nPresenters:\n\nBing Chen, President & Co-Founder, Gold House\n\nKaren Horne, Senior Vice President, Equity & Inclusion, WarnerMedia\n\nJohn Landgraf, Chairman, FX\n\nUCLA School of Law is a State Bar of California approved MCLE provider. By attending this event, you may earn Minimum Continuing Legal Education credit in the amount of up to 0.75 hours of general credit and 1 hour of elimination of bias in the legal profession and society credit.\n\nJune 9, 2021\n\nDead or Alive: Is the Theatrical Motion Picture Business Still Viable Post-Covid?\n\nIn the aftermath of the havoc wreaked on the theatrical motion picture business by a once-in-a-century pandemic, it's uncertain if people will return to movie theaters and, if so, when and in what numbers. In a post-Covid world exhibitors must make a compelling case for the theatrical experience. Time will tell if they consolidate or perhaps become subsidiaries of AT&T, The Walt Disney Company, Comcast or Netflix. The traditional windows between theatrical release and availability for in-home viewing have been compressed in a market where the major studios have product that needs to find an audience. With Universal, Disney and Time Warner all releasing titles day and date on streaming platforms, all eyes are on the relationship between exhibitors and distributors. How will this affect: the types of films getting greenlit, the economic model for film production and distribution, the survival of independents, and, finally, what does the lack of a theatrical release mean for talent participating in box office success? Will the theatrical movie business be limited to tent poles and art films? How can exhibitors adapt to this changing landscape in order to survive? This panel will look at crucial issues surrounding the existential crisis that the theatrical exhibition business is facing from the legal, studio, independent, and producer's point of views.\n\nModerator:\n\nElsa Ramo, Managing Partner, Ramo Law P.C.\n\nPanelists:\n\nNikkole Denson-Randolph, Senior Vice President, Content Strategy & Inclusive Programming, AMC Theaters\n\nJim Orr, President, Domestic Theatrical Distribution, Universal Pictures\n\nTom Quinn, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, NEON\n\nBackend Participations in the New Age: How Do We Create a New Normal That Works for Everyone?\n\nThis past year offered a mix of survival and opportunity. As studios continue to experiment with release and distribution patterns, they must navigate how to attract and retain sought-after creative talent and investors, and how to fairly compensate them when the distributors only sell to themselves. This panel features points of view from all sides of the negotiation table: a transactional attorney, business affairs executives from an agency and a studio, and a profit participations auditor, who will explore whether market domination and meaningful backend participations can peacefully co-exist in the new distribution ecosystem.\n\nModerator:\n\nAnita Wu, Managing Director, Profit Participations Services, Green Hasson Janks\n\nPanelists:\n\nErik Hyman, Partner, Paul Hastings\n\nDan Scharf, Global Head of Business Affairs, Amazon Studios\n\nCraig Wagner, Executive Vice President, Business Affairs and General Counsel, Paradigm Talent Agency\n\nUCLA School of Law is a State Bar of California approved MCLE provider.

Thus, these platforms have found themselves embroiled in endless controversy. Many worry they filter too much information, or not enough. Others wonder if the protections offered by Section 230, which generally provides immunity for website platforms from third-party content, are mitigating the problem or only exacerbating it. This frank conversation will focus on the legal rules that govern information platforms and the strategies that might best promote thoughtful, honest and diverse engagement on topics of public importance.\n\nModerator:\n\nDoug Lichtman, Professor of Law, UCLA School of Law\n\nPanelists:\n\nErich Andersen, General Counsel and Head of Corporate Affairs, ByteDance/TikTok\n\nSean Edgett, Vice President and General Counsel, Twitter\n\nJennifer Newstead, General Counsel, Facebook\n\nThe World of Influencers – Big Business, Big Deals and More\n\nInfluencer marketing continues its explosive growth and is expected to be valued at $13.8 billion in 2021 – up from $9.7 billion in 2020. Experts who represent major brands and influencer talent will discuss the challenging aspects of influencer deals and what has changed in the past year.

Mitchell Panel on Ethics and Entertainment Sponsored by the Patricia W. Mitchell Trust\n\nThe Truth or Not the Truth: That Is the Question\n\nJoin as we explore a lawyer's obligation to be truthful in his or her professional capacity. Especially now, the line between zealous advocacy and truth seems to be more difficult to discern than in years past. The line may be different when speaking before a court as opposed to the media. What are the ethical duties lawyers need to consider when they are sued for defamation by opposing parties for things said to the press. Is there a fine line between legal liability and ethical duties in these types of cases? One thing is certain: entertainment lawyers must be aware of the press more frequently than other litigators due to the nature of their practice. This panel features a Hollywood lawyer who has been said can make just about any problem go away, a lawyer who advises lawyers in legal ethics and frequently serves as an expert witness in legal malpractice proceedings, and a native Los Angeles federal district court judge.\n\nModerator:\n\nScott Cummings, Robert Henigson Professor of Legal Ethics, Professor of Law, UCLA School of Law\n\nPanelists:\n\nEllen A.

Nobody knows where things are going, but we can try to figure out where they stand today, what is impacting costs, revenue, and distribution, and how companies are beginning to cope. The question is whether the changes we are seeing today, for good and bad, are just sprouts from acorns planted in the past that will wither if the coronavirus goes away this year, or are these the seeds of major changes that will be locked in permanently if the pandemic continues through 2021? We'll do our best with the annual Status Report, traditional to this opening session, and then look at some of the cost, revenue, and distribution factors impacting the industry as a setup for the panels that follow.\n\nPresenter:\n\nTom Wolzien / Chairman, Wolzien LLC and The Video Call Center, LLC\n\n+++++\n\nTHE SAFETY DANCE: HOW THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS WORKING THROUGH A COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nJoin us in an overview of the current status of how COVID-19 is impacting the entertainment industry.

ARE PROFIT PARTICIPATIONS AN OUTDATED CONCEPT IN THE NEW TELEVISION ERA?\n\nThe $180 million arbitrator's decision in the Bones litigation sent shock waves through the entertainment industry. The finding that one studio failed to deal on an arm's length basis when licensing a television series to its affiliates, and the proliferation of vertical integration in the television industry in particular, has caused the studios to rethink the traditional profit sharing model. The digital platforms and at least one major studio have fundamentally changed the industry by introducing a replacement for the age old profit participation typically granted to content creators. This new \"bonus\" definition is based on longevity and, in some cases, the medium of exploitation, thereby eliminating the possibility of lawsuits for non-arm's length transactions while limiting any upside for participants on very successful shows. Our panel of experts will discuss the Bones case, the pros and cons of the new bonus model and the future of profit participations in the television industry.\n\nModerator:\n\nCraig Wagner / Head of Business Affairs and General Counsel, Paradigm Talent Agency\n\nPanelists:\n\nJohn V.

Mitchell Panel on Ethics and Entertainment Sponsored by the Patricia W. Mitchell Trust\n\nTHE NEWS, THE LAW AND LEGAL ETHICS\n\nThe news business oft times seems like it is aflame: massive lawsuits filed by public figures and government officials; damaging hacks and revealing leaks about celebrities, politicians and public companies; social media fueling controversies about disagreements big and small. And programs and pundits spinning every event, often sprinkling in \"alternative facts\" and perspectives condemned as fake news. Our expert panel will discuss the lawyer's ethical responsibilities when advising journalists and media companies telling stories that raise difficult legal and fairness issues including, reporting based on hacks and leaks, NDA breaches, and surreptitious recordings. To facilitate open dialogue, the panelists will analyze a hypothetical fact pattern that raises many familiar issues.\n\nModerator:\n\nDale Cohen / Director, Documentary Film Legal Clinic, UCLA School of Law, and Special Counsel, FRONTLINE\n\nPanelists:\n\nJonathan Anschell / Executive Vice President and General Counsel, ViacomCBS Media Networks\n\nKelli L.

Conversely, studios, networks and tech companies are working to adhere and comply with unions while balancing the economics of exploiting and producing content. With strikes and union rifts in the background, studios, companies and union members need to find a way to focus on the 'relation' aspect of 'labor relations' to ensure that despite both parties protecting their interests, the show must go on. This panel of 'labor relations' experts will cover the day to day challenges along with the current status of larger union issues that impact all interested parties from potentially just getting along.\n\nModerator:\n\nMichael Maizner / Founder and Managing Partner, Maizner & Associates PLLC\n\nPanelists:\n\nRichard W.

During this time, many industries are beginning to dive deep into the waters of social responsibility and evaluating the ways in which they can, and should, engage in the work to make the world a more equitable place for all. As gatekeepers of societal knowledge, it is important for the entertainment industry to evaluate its role in this conversation. This panel will explore the industry's response to this moment in history, and the ways in which creative content shapes and guides the discussion on racial justice. In particular, the panel will explore: (1) the changes that need to be made at the C-Suite level in order to effectuate lasting racial equity; (2) the necessity of amplifying diverse storytellers to push the conversation forward; and (3) the ways in which creative content can reshape how society thinks about racial justice.\n\nModerator\n\nLisa Gilford / Partner, Sidley Austin LLP\n\nPanelists:\n\nNichelle Carr / Founder, WC1 Studios\n\nNicole Duckett / General Counsel and Vice President, LA Clippers LLC\n\nKaren Grant-Selma, Senior Vice President, Business and Legal Affairs, Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN)\n\nUCLA School of Law is a State Bar of California approved MCLE provider.

These influencers use their vast network of fans to communicate marketing messages on behalf of brands in a variety of ways. As the economic activity in much of the United States (as well as the rest of the world) has come to a grinding halt due to the unprecedented global public health crisis stemming from COVID-19, more and more people have been turning to social media for news, entertainment, and social activity, thereby further strengthening social media's dominance as a leading communication and marketing platform. While the increased consumer use of social media coupled with an acute drop in traditional marketing activity and marketing budget have in theory opened up opportunities for influencers, the realities of living through a global pandemic, economic uncertainties as well as greater awareness and public debate about social justice have shifted the way brands are working with influencers to get their messages across. This panel will address strategic and IP issues as well as legal/regulatory and PR risks facing influencers and brands that work with influencers in the post-COVID era. In particular, the panel will explore the following questions: (1) Who are today's influencers and why are they valuable to brands in reaching their customers? (2) How are influencer deals structured? (3) What are the key regulatory requirements related to influencer activity and how are brands and influencers addressing such issues?\n\nModerator:\n\nPo Yi / Partner, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP\n\nPanelists:\n\nOren Aks / Creative Director & Founder, Atomic Milk Media\n\nEllie Heisler / Partner, Nixon Peabody LLP\n\nD'Angela Proctor / CEO, Wayfarer Entertainment\n\n+++++\n\nKEYNOTE ADDRESS\n\nBryan Lourd / Managing Partner and Co-Chairman, Creative Artists Agency (CAA)\n\nInterviewed by: Ken Ziffren / Ziffren Brittenham, LLP\n\nUCLA School of Law is a State Bar of California approved MCLE provider.

Yet even as Hollywood's uncertain digital future has become its very real digital present, the industry stands on the precipice of further sea changes to its basic structure (in the form of widespread corporate consolidation and vertical integration) and culture (with a #MeToo movement that is pivoting from raising awareness to enacting change). Data has made content creators and distributors savvier than ever about their products and their customers. The 2019 Symposium will turn its analytical eye onto the industry itself, offering introspection and insight on how the business continues to mature in response to the technological revolution, while preparing itself for the new revolutions at its doorstep.\n\nFriday, March 15, 2019\n\nWelcome\n\nPRESENTER:\n\nDean Jennifer L. Mnookin, David G. Price and Dallas P. Price Professor of Law, and Faculty Co-Director, PULSE @ UCLA Law (Program on Understanding Law, Science & Evidence), UCLA School of Law\n\nIs Media Just a Toaster?\n\nBack in the day, banks would give you a toaster if you'd give them money to set up a new account. With consolidation and vertical integration, will media become the \"come-on\" to get you to buy your latest phone, bits, or plan? Analyst/inventor/media exec Tom Wolzien opens the Symposium with the annual Status Report and explores the changing relationships between content and mobile distribution, including whether Warner Bros. content is diverted from external licenses to become AT&T's toaster to drive mobile sales. Similarly, instead of external licenses, how extensively is the content of Disney and NBCU used exclusively to create those companies' new streaming services. Internationally, four billion smartphones are video capable. How will this huge penetration increase content consumption, and will that content be from the US? Will these expanded markets prolong the \"golden age\" of production in the US, or does studio consolidation (Disney eats Fox) and vertical consolidation suggest that the \"golden age\" has peaked? That brings a basic question—at some point does the capital/debt that have been fueling this golden age in the US run out, and if so, what happens?\n\nPRESENTER:\n\nTom Wolzien, Chairman, Wolzien LLC and The Video Call Center, LLC\n\nRepresentation Is Not A Handshake Deal*\n\nHollywood dealmaking was often a handshake and notes on a napkin. However, ethical requirements governing a lawyer's obligations are a bit more complicated. This all-star panel will provide insight into the recent changes to the ethical requirements implemented by the California Supreme Court and their effect on the entertainment industry. We will look at the current cases, including a discussion of the most recent issues arising in contingency fee arrangements with talent in light of the current litigation and changes to the California Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\n*This session qualifies for 1 hour of Legal Ethics credit.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nSeptember Rea, Attorney, Freedman + Taitelman, LLP\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nPatty Glaser, Partner, Glaser Weil Fink Howard Avchen & Shapiro LLP\n\nDiane L. Karpman, Partner, Karpman & Associates\n\nTara Senior, Partner, Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein & Lezcano\n\nGetting To The Source\n\nWith the proliferation of content as the entertainment industry evolves, rights are being sliced and diced like never before. Can purchasers be sure they are getting the rights for which they paid? What revenue streams can rights holders participate in and what rights can they retain, if any? Join our panel of experts who deal with these issues every day: a well-known film and television agent for an important agency, the Head of Business Affairs for a successful independent production company, the SVP and General Counsel for a major television studio and an experienced transactional attorney. The discussion will cover not only basics but also evolving issues regarding such things as format deals, issues in acquiring nonfiction works, remakes and sequels, and copyright termination rights.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nHillary Bibicoff, Transactional Entertainment Attorney, Holmes Weinberg, PC\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nRand Holston, Agent, Paradigm Talent Agency\n\nSandra Ortiz, Head of Business Affairs, Kapital Entertainment\n\nJody Zucker, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Warner Bros. Television\n\nDirect To Consumer – Existential Threat or Passing Fad\n\nThe internet and OTT video services have changed the established order for creating and consuming media services. Merger mania has seen traditional media companies join forces with tech companies and telcos. Legacy media companies are busy bulking up on content. The tremendous proliferation of access points to view media has upended our industry. Tech companies like Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube, Facebook and Google have created existential threats to legacy media companies in how they create and distribute content. Our panel will explore how these threats are being handled—whether by co-option or competition.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nBen Mogil, Chief Financial Officer and Principal, IoM Media Ventures\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nLeigh Brecheen, Partner, Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman, LLP\n\nAdam Glick, Executive Vice President, Business Affairs, Warner Bros.

This panel of top Esports experts will explore the interplay among the key participants in the Esports industry including teams, leagues, athletes, streamers, video game publishers, sponsors and agencies. Panelists will share their views of legal and business trends from different vantage points including their respective approaches and perspectives regarding monetization, governance structure and intellectual property rights.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nOphir Lupu, Partner and Head of Video Games, United Talent Agency\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nRobby Forbes, Senior Director, Esports Leagues, Activision Blizzard\n\nMichael Kerman, Senior Director, OGN Esports\n\nAri Segal, Chief Executive Officer, Immortals\n\nSpotlight on Privacy: How Data Is Reshaping the Entertainment Industry\n\nPersonal data plays a key supporting role in enabling entertainment companies to develop more engaging experiences for consumers. But a high-stakes drama was set in motion when a California real estate developer supported a ballot initiative on privacy that ultimately led to the enactment of the nation's first general privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act. Other states are working on similar legislation, and Congress is considering federal privacy proposals.\n\nHear from experts who have been actively engaged in data privacy issues, including the legislation in California and across the country and the businesses who are taking steps to comply with the rapidly changing framework for how personal data is managed.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nLindsey Tonsager, Partner, Covington & Burling LLP\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nSusan Cooper, Director and Associate General Counsel, Product and Privacy, Facebook\n\nAlastair Mactaggart, Chairman, Californians for Consumer Privacy\n\nAnna Tran Reyna, Senior Vice President, Business and Legal Affairs, Digital Media, Fox Networks Group\n\n#MeToo: What's Next*\n\nFor over a year, the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements have dominated the conversation in Hollywood and deeply challenged the industry's perception of itself. But as the Hollywood community begins to transition from the initial wave of scandals and revelations that rocked the industry and forced this period of personal reckoning, important questions remain about how to translate slogans and lapel pins into real (and much needed) change. This panel will explore how the ideals of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements can be implemented and actualized in pursuit of true gender equity and safety from sexual violence and harassment in the workplace. In particular, the panel will discuss concrete steps necessary for the entertainment industry to advance toward specific articulable goals, such as pay equality, safe workplace environments, inclusiveness of points of view, and equal opportunity for advancement to leadership positions.\n\n*This session qualifies for 1 hour of Recognition and Elimination of Bias in the Legal Profession and Society credit.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nBarbara Boyle, Associate Dean of Entrepreneurship and Special Initiatives, UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nKevin Iwashina, Agent, Endeavor Content\n\nCathy Schulman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Welle Entertainment\n\nSharon Waxman, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, TheWrap\n\nKeynote Address\n\nMeg Whitman, Chief Executive Officer, Quibi\n\nJeffrey Katzenberg, Managing Partner of WndrCo and Chairman and Founder of Quibi\n\nThe Moral Contract: Contractual Regulation of Personal Conduct in Entertainment Deals\n\nIn Hollywood, the line between the personal and the professional has always been blurry at best. But not since the 1921 trial of Fatty Arbuckle ushered in a wave of major Hollywood scandals (and a counter-wave of newly-drafted morals clauses designed to combat them) has private personal conduct been viewed as so relevant to, or been so closely scrutinized in, the business arena. This panel will examine the contractual regulation of personal conduct in three key relationship contexts – between studios and on- and behind-camera talent; between brands and celebrity endorsers; and between entertainment companies and their own executives. How do these deals reflect the fraught and fast-changing cultural and industry environment? And how, if at all, can one reasonably and responsibly contract around the risk of scandal?\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nStacy K. Marcus, Partner, Reed Smith LLP\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nIvy Kagan Bierman, Partner, Loeb & Loeb LLP\n\nCarolyn Conrad, Partner, Schreck Rose Dapello Adams Berlin & Dunham LLP\n\nMark Mazie, Executive Vice President, Business and Legal Affairs, Legendary Television & Digital Studios\n\nContinuing Legal Education\n\nUCLA School of Law is a State Bar of California approved MCLE provider.

The 2018 Symposium will explore how Hollywood is transforming itself to meet the new era around it and to continue its tradition of supporting artists and storytellers in their critical missions to inspire, educate, and yes, entertain. And it will celebrate that, even in times of disruption and upheaval, content is king, and Hollywood will always matter -- maybe more than ever.\n\nFriday, March 23, 2018\n\nWelcome\n\nPRESENTER:\n\nSusan Akens, Executive Director, Ziffren Center for Media, Entertainment, Technology and Sports Law, UCLA School of Law\n\n#MeToo: Sexual Harassment in Hollywood\n\nOverview of pertinent federal and state laws, corporate and individual responsibility and liability, in the office setting and in the production setting, and issues such as settlement agreements, non-disclosure agreements, and responsibility of company human resources executives.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nElsa Ramo, Managing Partner, Ramo Law PC\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nRonda D. Jamgotchian, Partner, Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP\n\nMatthias H. Wagener, Managing Partner, Wagener Law, A Professional Corporation\n\nSome Like It Hot - A Mock negotiation\n\nThis panel will conduct a mock negotiation that walks through the setup of a feature project at a studio from the point of view of the packaging agent, studio business affairs, talent representation, and production company. While negotiation terms and tactics in the past have always been about 'precedent,' times are changing - with new laws surrounding quotes, awareness of gender salary gap, competitive buyers in the streaming and SVOD market, this panel will walk us through the 'new normal' of a studio set up.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nChristine D'Souza Gelb, Partner, Endeavor Content\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nErica Huggins, President, Imagine Entertainment\n\nTara Kole, Partner, Gang, Tyre, Ramer & Brown\n\nMegan O'Brien, Executive Vice President, Business Affairs, Fox Searchlight Pictures\n\nThe Future of the Television Business in the Digital Age: Can the Broadcast Nets and Cable Survive the Juggernaut of Internet TV?\n\nIn the era of \"Peak TV\" for scripted programming, the business models of broadcast and cable television are under more pressure than ever from premium SVOD services like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Google and soon, Apple. Can broadcast and cable compete in a world where talent is demanding ever increasing fees, budgets have skyrocketed as high as $15MM per hour, and viewers are demanding more flexibility in consuming content? Will traditional linear ad-supported television go the way of the Dodo Bird, or will it adapt to beat the upstarts at their own game by launching streaming and ad free services of their own? This trend has already begun with CBS All Access, F/X+ and AMC Premiere and looks a lot like the future of TV. The panel will examine these and other issues that are relevant in today's evolving television business.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nCraig Wagner, Executive Vice President, Business Affairs, and General Counsel, Paradigm Talent Agency\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nBeth Roberts, Executive Vice President, Business Operations, NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment\n\nDan Scharf, Head of Television Business Affairs, Amazon Studios\n\nSandra Stern, President, Lionsgate Television Group\n\nIndependence in Consolidation\n\nInventor, analyst, and media exec Tom Wolzien elevates this year's Symposium with his annual status report of industry numbers—tech and financial, before focusing on the shrinking number of players in media's expanding world. With both vertical and horizontal integration in process, how do individual players with distinctive content fit into various platforms; what leverage do platform owners find with distinctive content, and is there any place at all for commodity content anymore? What is the impact of rising content costs on legacy companies, and could rising costs actually provide a strategic benefit to newer global platforms by damaging earnings of older players already under the dual pressures of subscriber declines and advertising fragmentation?\n\nPRESENTER:\n\nTom Wolzien, Chairman, Wolzien LLC and The Video Call Center, LLC\n\nSaturday, March 24, 2018\n\nDean's Welcome\n\nPRESENTER:\n\nJennifer L.

He joins our Symposium first-thing Saturday morning for a fireside chat with UCLA Law Professor Doug Lichtman, where the two will explore the Commission's recent efforts with respect to broadband deployment, network neutrality, and a host of other issues.\n\nPresented in cooperation with the Federal Communications Bar\n\nPRESENTERS:\n\nDoug Lichtman, Professor of Law, UCLA School of Law\n\nMichael O'Rielly, Commissioner, Federal Communications Commission\n\nConsolidation Craze\n\nAccording to Thomson Reuters, 2017 was the third year in a row with over 50,000 M&A deals announced globally - a record. Experts expect this trend to continue in 2018. In the media space, the pending AT&T/Time Warner combination and the proposed sale of the film/TV assets of 21st Century Fox to Disney suggest more consolidation is on the horizon. What's driving this business re-mix? What are the unintended consequences of deals on the content creation community? Are there legitimate \"public interest\" issues raised by these types of transactions? What is the role for federal antitrust enforcement? This panel will discuss the pros and cons of M&A in the media space and some of the opportunities and challenges the industry faces during these turbulent times.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nJon Orszag, Senior Managing Director and Member of the Executive Committee, Compass Lexecon, LLC and Lecturer in Law, UCLA School of Law\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nBill Baer, Partner, Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP\n\nLaura Martin, Managing Director, Entertainment & Internet, Needham & Company\n\nRoy A.

Motion pictures are spawning Broadway shows; film and television stars are appearing on the Great White Way, and legitimate theater attendance is rising; yet most Hollywood entertainment lawyers know little about the deals, economics and practices of this important corner of the business. Our panel brings together an experienced theatrical lawyer, a New York agency dealmaker and an award-winning producer to guarantee that you will leave the theater knowing a lot more about this world than when you came in.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nE.

Brown, Partner, Franklin, Weinrib, Rudell & Vassallo, P.C.\n\nSue Frost, Partner and Founding Member, Junkyard Dog Productions\n\nMaarten Kooij, Senior Vice President, New York Business Affairs, ICM Partners\n\nKeynote by Andrew Gumpert, Chief Operating Officer, Paramount Pictures Corporation\n\nInterviewed by Ken Ziffren, Co-Founder and Partner, Ziffren Brittenham LLP\n\nReel Justice: Addiction and Redemption in Courtroom Films\n\nThis presentation is based on the book Reel Justice: The Courtroom Goes to the Movies (Bergman and Asimow, 2d ed 2006), which describes and analyzes legal issues in over 200 films. The book also summarizes the actual events on which many films are based and highlights the often-powerful specific images and dialogues through which courtroom films convey messages to viewers about the law, lawyers and justice.\n\nCourtroom films are not merely a form of story-telling. Courtroom films reflect and often reinforce widely-held cultural attitudes about the legal system. This presentation will look at current data about substance abuse in the legal profession and avenues available to lawyers in need of treatment. The presentation will also present clips from films that revolve around addiction issues in the legal profession, both the depth of the problem and possibilities for redemption. The presentation will emphasize the life and legal career of Earl Rogers. In the first two decades of the 20th century, Los Angeles lawyer Earl Rogers was one of the most famous lawyers in America. The clips will put on display both the courtroom theatrics for which he was famous and his addiction to alcohol that resulted in his early death.\n\nPRESENTER:\n\nPaul Bergman, Professor of Law Emeritus, UCLA School of Law\n\nContinuing Legal Education\n\nUCLA School of Law is a State Bar of California approved MCLE provider.

As customers continue to embrace a cross-platform, cross-media content experience, creators and companies have no choice but to do the same. But how are the powerhouses of the new entertainment economy redefining how business gets done and how money gets made? How can traditional power-players adapt their conventional business models to flourish in this brave new world? As this program will illustrate, for companies and individual professionals alike, success in the modern entertainment industry means keeping more balls in the air than ever before.\n\nWelcome\n\nPRESENTER:\n\nJennifer L. Mnookin, Dean, David G. Price and Dallas P. Price Professor of Law, and Faculty Co-Director, PULSE @ UCLA Law (Program on Understanding Law, Science & Evidence), UCLA School of Law\n\nYou've Got the Whole World In Your Hands\n\nWith more than 4 billion video smartphones worldwide and 2 billion high quality LTE subscribers, there is no stopping the smartphone as it moves to become our guide, computer, primary video screen, video originator, VR/AR display, all around communications device, and mental assistant for all. Those basing business on bigger screen distribution without considering the smartphone in their packaging and windows do so at their own peril, while those concentrating only on smartphones miss out on the rich production, the story-telling value, and dangerously, the underlying ethics developed for the bigger screens and longer forms. Wolzien, producer, inventor, network executive, and Wall Street analyst, again brings his unique opening act to the Symposium, providing a cross-disciplinary update of numbers, trends, and concepts for the rapidly evolving industry.\n\nPRESENTER:\n\nTom Wolzien, Chairman, Wolzien LLC and the Video Call Center, LLC\n\nEntropy: The New Content Ecosystem\n\nThe ecosystem around content creation, distribution and consumption has changed dramatically. We are no longer at the beginning. New platforms, including Netflix, Amazon, YouTube and Facebook, have become firmly established, prompting new patterns of consumption (binge, on demand). Moreover, new forms of content, from YouTube's digital shorts to Snapchat stories, now compete for consumers' attention. New types of content creators and distributors, from AwesomenessTV to Vice and Buzzfeed, have emerged to supply this new ecosystem. And yet, the pace of change continues to increase. What does this mean for both the new players and the traditional media companies? Is there a role for the traditional television studios? Will there be sustainable revenue models? Will we continue to see M&A transactions among technology platforms and content companies and/or between content companies? How will film and television artists be affected? Where will the combined industries go from here?\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nBryan Wolf, Partner, Ziffren Brittenham LLP\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nPrem Akkaraju, Chief Executive Officer, Screening Room\n\nBrett Bouttier, President, AwesomenessTV\n\nEmiliano Calemzuk, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, RAZE\n\nMark Terbeek, Partner, Greycroft Partners\n\nFilm Packaging: What You Need to Know and Why\n\nThe independent film space is heavily dependent on packages. A package is a fully or partially assembled combination of screenplay, lead cast, director, and producer that is ready for greenlight with little or no further development. Packages are generally assembled by producers or talent agencies and presented to financiers and distributors capable of underwriting the production cost and pre-buying the film for domestic or international exploitation. This panel looks at the current state of packaging and how the architecture of packages and their attraction to financiers and buyers is changing as media, consumer habits, and markets evolve. Do the elements of packages need to change to remain attractive to buyers? Do changes in distribution platforms, media consumption and consumer tastes alter the way we should think about assembling packages? How do changes in the value of international territories impact the composition of packages? Are there geo-political and other forces that should be considered in assembling or evaluating packages?\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nElliott Kleinberg, Senior Vice President of Business Affairs, Twentieth Century Fox\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nGlen Basner, Chief Executive Officer, FilmNation Entertainment\n\nSteve Bersch, President, Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions\n\nLiesl Copland, Partner, William Morris Endeavor\n\nDan Timmons, Senior Vice President, Market Manager; Head of Entertainment Industries, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nUCLA Anderson Spotlight on the Business of Entertainment\n\nTechnology is disrupting the business models of all sectors of the media, entertainment and sport industries. The UCLA Anderson Spotlight features a conversation with industry leaders who are defining and shaping where the business is going. What are the new revenue streams for the studios? Which companies will be the giants of tomorrow? The leaders of today will share their perspectives on the future of the business.\n\nHOSTED BY:\n\nSanjay Sood, Professor of Marketing, UCLA Anderson School of Management\n\nFEATURING:\n\nPeter Seymour, Former EVP and CFO, Disney ABC Television Group\n\nSaturday, March 18, 2017\n\nImpact of VR/AR on Production and Distribution of Content\n\nA survey and discussion concerning Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality and how the advent of these technologies affects the production and distribution of content, including theatrical motion pictures, television programming, sports, games, music, and other, including entertainment, educational and other non-entertainment. Who are the key players in hardware and software creation? Beyond content, what will be the impact of VR on revenue streams from content - How big a money maker is VR now and will it be in the future? Which companies in the VR world have the most exciting promise and will emerge on top, and why?\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nKenneth Kleinberg, Partner, Kleinberg Lange Cuddy & Carlo LLP\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nEric Baum, Senior Vice President, Business and Legal Affairs, Sony Pictures Worldwide Marketing and Distribution and Assistant General Counsel, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc.\n\nJoseph Chen, Executive Technical Producer, Here Be Dragons\n\nRyan Horrigan, Chief Content Officer, Felix and Paul Studios\n\nAmit Shalev, Senior Director of VR Technology, IMAX Corporation\n\nBased on the (Book/Comic/Blog/etc.) by…\n\nIn a crowded entertainment marketplace, film and television producers, studios, and networks have increasingly turned to preexisting intellectual property as a way to attract the interest of buyers, distributors, and audiences. And the strategy is apparently working: many of today's most prominent and successful film and television franchises arose from licensed IP (including Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Fifty Shades of Grey, Game of Thrones, and The Walking Dead, to name only a few), and four out of the last six Academy Awards for Best Picture went to films that were based on books and/or true life stories. How has the hot marketplace for intellectual property affected dealmaking for underlying rights? What are the major non-economic considerations that rightsholders and buyers must grapple with in their negotiations? What creative, marketing, and business considerations have driven the industry's appetite for adaptable intellectual property, and where will the industry turn next to feed that appetite? This panel of dealmakers and creative professionals will explore the entertainment industry's evolving relationship with underlying rights and with underlying rightsholders.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nKen Basin, Vice President, U.S. Business Affairs, Sony Pictures Television\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nVictoria Cook, Partner, Frankfurt Kurnit Klein + Selz\n\nHoward Meyers, Executive Vice President, Business Affairs, Focus Features\n\nChris Parnell, Executive Vice President, Drama Development, Programming and Production, Sony Pictures Television\n\nHoward Sanders, Partner and Co-Head of Book Department, United Talent Agency\n\nBroken Windows?\n\nSequential distribution of a film used to be relatively simple. Open it in a theater or multiplex, then starting 90 days later, it followed the traditional windows of DVD, Premium Pay, Network Television (if lucky) or basic cable and eventually syndication on local TV stations. All linear. Those days are over and such things as Day and Date, Premium VOD, Over the Top and all kinds of digital transmission, now dominate the discussion. The decision of the major studios to concentrate on tentpole movies has created new paradigms and profoundly affected deals for financiers, Wall Street, talent and others.\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nKen Ziffren, Co-Founder and Partner, Ziffren Brittenham LLP, Adjunct Professor, UCLA School of Law, Senior Advisor, Los Angeles Mayor's Office of Motion Picture and TV Production, Founder, Ziffren Center for Media, Entertainment, Technology & Sports Law at UCLA School of Law\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nThomas Gewecke, Chief Digital Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategy and Business Development, Warner Bros. Entertainment\n\nBenjamin E. Mogil, Managing Director Equity Research, Media and Entertainment, Stifel Nicolaus\n\nJason Ropell, Worldwide Head of Motion Pictures, Amazon Studios\n\nKeynote by Stacey Snider, Chairman & CEO, Twentieth Century Fox Film\n\nInterviewed by Ken Ziffren, Ziffren Brittenham LLP\n\nBias in the Justice System: What Do We Learn from the Movies?\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird's Atticus Finch is one of film's greatest heroes, but his explicit plea for southern white jurors to ignore their biases was a disastrous failure. This presentation will focus on clips from other films that suggest alternative strategies that might diminish the power of biases on people's actions.\n\nPRESENTER:\n\nPaul Bergman, Professor of Law Emeritus, UCLA School of Law\n\nContinuing Legal Education\n\nUCLA School of Law is a State Bar of California approved MCLE provider.

Mnookin, David G. Price and Dallas P. Price Professor of Law, and Faculty Co-Director, PULSE @ UCLA Law (Program on Understanding Law, Science & Evidence), UCLA School of Law\n\nEvolving Data, Evolving Business: 40 Years of Radical Change in Media\n\nThis year’s high-speed opening act will explore data and technology trends in media across the 40 years of the Entertainment Symposium and what those trends may mean for the future of content and business. Now in its 11th year, the Status Report will provide not only current numbers, but in this anniversary year will look at how trends and prognostications have played out since the Symposium began. Key decisions and developments during the four decades will be examined that fundamentally changed production and distribution, and the basics of the business. These will be applied to current trends and economics as the industry settles into the reality that consumers want, and will have, any content at any time or place and on any device. Latest technologies and production economics will be explored from mobile to 8K to drones to automated content creation.\n\nPresenter: Tom Wolzien, Chairman, Wolzien LLC and The Video Call Center, LLC\n\nChinawood\n\nThere was $1 billion of financing from China to Hollywood in 2015, with perhaps more than twice that coming in 2016. This panel will discuss the future of Chinese investment in Hollywood, including the motivations of the investors, the structure of the deals, and the implications for film companies and financiers.\n\nModerator: Schuyler M. Moore, Partner, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP\n\nPanelists: Eric Rong, President, TIK FILMS | Jay Sun, Chairman and President, Pegasus Media Group | Simon Sun, Executive Vice President, Le Vision Pictures, Inc.\n\nRecent Trends of Bankruptcy in the Entertainment Industry\n\nRelativity Media’s recent Chapter 11 filing has demonstrated how one bankruptcy case can have a ripple effect throughout an entire industry, as vendors and participants go unpaid and unreleased films are stuck in limbo. As seen in Relativity’s case and others like it, a variety of powers may be exercised in bankruptcy that may impair or otherwise affect the different parties’ rights in intellectual property licenses and other contracts. This panel of experts will address these and other issues that arise in bankruptcy cases involving entertainment companies, writers, and artists.\n\nModerator: Kenneth N. Klee, Partner, Klee, Tuchin, Bogdanoff & Stern LLP and Professor of Law Emeritus, UCLA School of Law\n\nPanelists: Marsha A. Houston, Partner, Reed Smith LLP | Lance Jurich, Partner, Loeb & Loeb LLP | Richard Wynne, Partner, Jones Day\n\nPractical Tips from Leading Studio Labor Negotiators\n\nLeading negotiators from three major studios will provide practical tips on dealing with guild issues. The discussion will include a review and interpretation of various provisions in the DGA, SAG-AFTRA and WGA guild agreements with respect to New Media, Secondary Digital Channels, Reality Television, Social Media and Promotions. Whether you represent talent or companies, this discussion will help you navigate the complicated guild issues that often arise.\n\nModerator: Ivy Kagan Bierman, Partner, Loeb & Loeb LLP\n\nPanelists: Nicole Ann-Jeanette Gustafson, Executive Vice President, Industrial Relations & Production Safety, Paramount Pictures | Marc Sandman, Senior Vice President of Labor Relations, Disney|ABC Television Group | Russell Wetanson, Vice President, Labor Relations Counsel, Fox\n\nEmerging Streaming Services: Reaching Beyond Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu\n\nThe general conversation around consumer “cord cutting” has largely focused on three main streaming services-Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video, and Hulu. Each of these services has built its brand by offering users a compelling mix of high-end second-run programming and traditionally-structured and produced, premium long-form original programming. But while you may be patting yourself on the back for finally figuring out how to stream “Orange is the New Black” from the Netflix app on your smart TV, it’s more likely that your kids are engrossed in a short-form series you’ve never heard of, featuring a social media star you can’t recognize, on a platform you never knew existed (and it ain’t YouTube). The last few years have seen the emergence of a massive new marketplace, specializing in short form original content, delivered through compelling app-based user experiences on mobile phone and tablet devices. Just because you may have never heard of Go 90, Fullscreen, SeeSo, or Watchable, doesn’t mean your 10-year-old hasn’t. So who are these new players in the original content marketplace? This panel of distinguished creative, business and legal minds, across a variety of buyers and sellers in this new digital ecosystem, will explore what lessons they have taken from their traditional media forebears (or, in some cases corporate partners), and how they have redefined the business to meet their own needs. And they’ll help us tackle one major question: when it comes to delivering content to users via the Internet, there is little question that there are more than enough megabytes to go around…but are there enough dollars too?\n\nModerator: Ken Basin, Lecturer on Law, Harvard Law School\n\nPanelists: Rozanna Tesler Fried, Vice President of Business and Legal Affairs, Fullscreen | Ben Gigli, Director of Development and Production, ABC Digital | Peter Morris, Vice President, Business Affairs & Strategy, and General Counsel, Funny Or Die\n\nLitigation Update: Year End Review\n\nLitigation always hands us surprises and challenges. 2015 was no different. This panel will focus on just a few of the most interesting and intriguing litigated matters: (1) the music industry has seen some of the most significant industry-changing litigation in the past decade. This past year has seen class actions in California state court against Sirius XM and Pandora for common law copyright infringement and misappropriation of pre-1972 recordings, and federal court action against Spotify for copyright infringement for failing to license songs it distributes through interactive streaming and limited downloads; (2) recent developments in profit participation cases, with a focus on class actions and securities claims; and (3) the latest developments in the fair use doctrine.\n\nModerator: Bonnie E.

Edelman, Partner, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP | Harvey Geller, Of Counsel, Gradstein & Marzano, P.C. | Richard Kendall, Partner, Kendall Brill & Kelly LLP\n\nCopyright 2016: The Year in Anticipation\n\nUCLA Law Professor Doug Lichtman returns this year but with a forward-looking twist. Rather than looking back at the major cases and events from the year gone by, Professor Lichtman will pull out his crystal ball and talk about the cases, policy changes, and product launches that are likely to matter in the months ahead. Topics will include pending litigation in copyright and entertainment, as well as a smattering of related patent law, communications law, and free speech topics.\n\nPresenter: Doug Lichtman, Professor of Law, UCLA School of Law\n\nKeynote Address\n\nKen Ziffren, Partner, Ziffren Brittenham LLP, Founder, Ziffren Center for Media, Entertainment, Technology & Sports Law, and Adjunct Faculty, UCLA School of Law\n\nAnne Sweeney, Member of the Board, Netflix, a Dean's Fellow, Harvard University Graduate School of Education, and Formerly Co-Chair, Disney Media Works, and President, Disney/ABC Television Group\n\nOn this 40th Anniversary of the UCLA Entertainment Symposium, Ken Ziffren and Anne Sweeney chat about where we've gone, where we are and where we're going.\n\nReel Justice: Legal Ethics in Courtroom Films or Ethics in a Digital Environment\n\nWhile law-related films primarily aim to entertain mass audiences, the exemplary or lamentable behavior of the lawyers and judges depicted in the films often provide dramatic or comical illustrations of the legal profession’s formal rules of conduct. This presentation uses clips from law-related films as the basis of an hour-long discussion of legal ethics.\n\nPresenter: Paul Bergman, Professor of Law Emeritus, UCLA School of Law\n\nContinuing Legal Education\n\nUCLA School of Law is a State Bar of California approved MCLE provider. By attending this symposium, you may earn Minimum Continuing Legal Education credit in the amount of up to 8.0 hours of general MCLE credit and 1 hour of Legal Ethics credit.

Ginsburg | Executive Director of the Entertainment, Media, and Intellectual Property Law Program and Lecturer in Law, UCLA School of Law\n\nOver-The-Top: Trend, Bubble, Both?\n\nThe focus of this year's opening session is on-demand delivery of professional video content and the impact on linear distribution models. As content is uncoupled from classic distribution approaches -- broadcast, cable, satellite -- and is made available through on demand approaches, how do companies adapt to the changing value chain? What are the risks to traditional multi-window revenue models? Is consumer-controlled on-demand (DVR) destroying more value than OTT licensing can create, and can the economic model be reversed if operators disable ad skipping? Or is all this focus on OTT a bubble? Has the dumping of full series and even whole libraries into Netflix, Amazon Prime, and others, resulted in a content bubble that, once viewers chew through, will result in the complaint \" a million shows... but nothing on.\" Tom Wolzien will begin his presentation with the annual \"Status Report\" update of industry numbers.\n\nPresenter:\n\nTom Wolzien | Chairman, Wolzien LLC\n\nTalent over-the-top\n\nThe world of original digital content production has opened doors for a new generation of gifted young celebrities, while at the same time luring established talent with the promise of creative freedom and an opportunity to be a part of the future of the entertainment industry. Yet talent representatives and clients alike often have little sense of what to expect as they dive into this \"brave new world.\" This panel of experienced negotiators will offer a behind-the-scenes look at how actors, writers, directors, and producers really earn their livings in the new digital economy. What are the promises and pitfalls of talent deals in the digital world? What are key deal points? How does one evaluate and negotiate contingent compensation from digital productions? And how do the deals for \"premium\" and lower-budget digital productions compare to each other and to the deals for traditional television and motion picture production? This panel of digital experts will offer a detailed and substantive introduction to the \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" worlds of original content production online -- and how to protect talent's place within them. This is a key panel for representatives and talent.\n\nModerators:\n\nKen Basin | Lecturer on Law, Harvard Law School and Vice President, U.S. Business Affairs, Sony Pictures Television\n\nE. Barry Haldeman | Of Counsel, Jeffer Mangels Butler & Mitchell LLP\n\nPanelists:\n\nPhilip Daniels | Partner, Ginsburg Daniels, LLP\n\nDavid Ho | Senior Vice President, Business and Legal Affairs and General Counsel, Fullscreen\n\nChris Jacquemin | Agent, Digital Media, William Morris Endeavor\n\nBrand Challenges and Opportunities in Fractured Media\n\nWith recent changes in the industry (from the impact of DVR to the emergence of OTT solutions), these panelists will discuss how brands are responding to recent changes in consumer behavior. They will give us insight into the new spending habits and trends advertisers are using to maximize impressions in today's entertainment environment and discuss the legal implications and risks that these new types of deals create.\n\nModerator:\n\nMichael S. Sherman | Partner, Reed Smith LLP\n\nPanelists:\n\nTom Larsen | President and General Manager, ZICO Beverages LLC\n\nDanny Stepper | Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Madvine Relativity\n\nCat Stone | Chief Executive Officer and Partner, Stone Management\n\nTV M&A: Forget Binge Viewing - How About Binge Buying!\n\nITV buys a controlling interest in Leftfield Entertainment and Gurney Productions. 21st Century Fox and Apollo Group roll-up Shine Group, Endemol and CORE Media Group. Discovery Communications and Liberty Global form a joint venture to acquire All3Media. Warner Bros. buys Eyeworks. Entertainment One Limited buys The Mark Gordon Company. Tinopolis Group buys Magical Elves. FremantleMedia buys 495 Productions. And MGM buys Mark Burnett and Roma Downey's media empire. Just to name a few. Why the consolidation and why now? Is consolidation good for buyers, good for sellers, good for distributors, good for talent, or good for consumers? Are we in a bubble and if so, when will it burst? Is there more consolidation to come and if so, when and where? This panel will seek to answer these questions by discussing recent TV M&A activity, while attempting to predict future trends.\n\nModerator:\n\nMatthew C.

The origins and practices of CBS Entertainment Diversity, its Diversity Institute programs, the circumstances that gave rise to formalizing the effort to diversify network casting and employment, and how and why the department has developed over its history will then be analyzed, including the vertically-integrated manner in which the Program is supported from the top down within the network corporate structure.\n\nModerator:\n\nJasleen Kohli | Director, Critical Race Studies Program, UCLA School of Law\n\nPanelists:\n\nDarnell Hunt, Ph.D. | Director, Ralph J.

Web-based upstarts like Amazon and Netflix have firmly established themselves as forces to be reckoned with, while \"old media\" stalwarts like HBO and CBS have made bold moves into direct-to-consumer digital distribution. This panel of dealmakers and strategists, representing the full span of the digital content supply chain, will offer new perspectives on how digital distribution is changing the television industry, for now and for good. How do content owners manage their rights across territories, media, and time in a technologically interconnected world? What can the upstarts learn from the established powers and vice versa? How can these players take full advantage of new distribution opportunities without sacrificing the old ones? In an era where business models are no longer safe, these experts will provide an insider's view of a rapidly changing world.\n\nModerator:\n\nAndrew Wallenstein | Co-Editor-in-Chief, Variety\n\nPanelists:\n\nJeff Frost | Executive Vice President, U.S. Business Affairs, Sony Pictures Television\n\nRob Gelick | Senior Vice President and General Manager, Digital Platforms, CBS Interactive Entertainment\n\nJerry Longarzo | Partner, KlevanLongarzo LLP and Chief Operating Officer, Alcon Television Group\n\nLaura Martin | Senior Analyst, Entertainment and Internet, Needham & Company, LLC\n\nNot Just One of the Crowd: Building Your Brand in Television\n\nWith viewers enjoying a greater variety of viewing options, across a wider array of platforms than ever before, it has never been more important for studios and networks to develop a unique brand identity that connects with viewers. Technology has offered producers and content owners unique opportunities to directly reach their customers. To fully take advantage of these opportunities, the players must make smart choices every day, starting first and foremost with what content they program, but also extending to questions regarding what talent they nurture, what partners they work with, what distribution channels they choose, and what identity they want to present to the world. This panel of top-level content programmers, strategists, and creative executives will describe how they and their organizations have worked to nurture and develop brands that connect with viewers, and how to combine business, legal, creative, and marketing imperatives for maximum success.\n\nModerator:\n\nTina Perry | Executive Vice President, Business and Legal Affairs, OWN\n\nPanelists:\n\nPeter Gal | Head of Television Development, DreamWorks Animation\n\nHolly Leff-Pressman | Executive Vice President, Nielsen Content\n\nChuck Saftler | President, Program Strategy and Chief Operating Officer, FX and FXX Networks\n\nTara Sorensen | Head of Kids Programming, Amazon Studios\n\nThe Year in Copyright Law and Entertainment Litigation\n\nThe panelists review the most salient developments of 2014 in the law of copyright and in general entertainment litigation, with a view toward the policy, practical analysis, and implications faced by counsel, client, and theoretician.\n\nModerator:\n\nDavid R.

This vision has guided him and his colleagues at TMZ and his other venues. The foregoing influenced the development of his television presence from the roots of his prior legal and broadcast experience, to the TMZ.com website, to programming on the TMZ show and beyond. He will address the content criteria for TMZ from his perspectives as a lawyer and a journalist, as well as the anticipation of his public audience.\n\nMCLE: UCLA School of Law is a State Bar of California approved MCLE provider.

Ten legal questions for the TV everywhere and Camera everywhere world from a non-lawyer media producer, analyst, and exec. As content creators and distributors look to capitalize on the “everywhere” potential of screens, they are also looking at the “everywhere” potential of the cameras that go along with most of those screens. And as they do, questions of what constitutes permitted use may make music rights issues look small in comparison. Think a video “selfie” with a big SuperBowl play in the background that suddenly morphs into play by play video coverage by the “selfie” turned commentator…all streamed live on the web. The presentation will begin with the industry “status report” traditional to this opening act.\n\nPresenter: Tom Wolzien, Chairman, Wolzien LLC\n\nFor the text of Mr. Wolzien's presentation, please click here.\n\nVideo Games: The Blockbuster Industry of the 21st Century\n\nVideo games have come to occupy an increasingly prominent place in the global entertainment landscape – a reality that became more obvious than ever in September 2013, when Grand Theft Auto V debuted to over $1 billion in retail sales during its first three days on the market. Yet many entertainment professionals have little or no insight into the workings of this multi-billion dollar industry. This panel – the first in the UCLA Entertainment Symposium’s 38-year history dedicated to video games – will present a distinguished group of experts with rich experience working for and inside some of the biggest players in the interactive entertainment world. The group will provide a primer on the basic business and deal structures on which the video game industry is built, as well as the key legal issues the industry faces in its day-to-day operations, before explori"
