        "text": "There’s a great comic interlude in Viet Thanh Nguyen’s novel “The Sympathizer” when the unnamed narrator, a Vietnamese Army captain exiled in Los Angeles, critiques the screenplay of a gung-ho Hollywood movie about America’s heroism in the Vietnam War.\n\nBy this time, a lot of things have already happened. Saigon has fallen. Chaos has closed in. The captain has secured the bloody, terrifying extraction of his boss, a pro-American general, on one of the last flights out (were there any other kind of flights in Saigon in 1975?). Working as an aide and sometime hit man for the general, now a California liquor-store owner, the captain applies himself to his real job: spying on the general, and other members of the Vietnamese diaspora, for the Communists who seized power back home.\n\nIn America, he’s in demand for his sophistication and fluent English. A bloviating Hollywood director summons him to discuss the script for “The Hamlet,” a movie in which a clichéd bunch of mostly doomed Green Berets saves, if that is the right word, a Vietnamese village from the Vietcong. The scene lays bare many of the distressing, absurd, tangled indignities and contradictions that the captain — half-French, half-Vietnamese, educated at an American college, author of a senior thesis on symbols in Graham Greene — contends with as he lives so many lives at once.\n\nHe points out that none of the movie’s Vietnamese characters have intelligible speaking parts. “Do you not think it would be a little more believable,” he tells the director, “for a movie set in a certain country for the people in that country to have something to say, instead of having your screenplay direct, as it does now, ‘Cut to villagers speaking in their own language’?”\n\nThe great achievement of “The Sympathizer” is that it gives the Vietnamese a voice and demands that we pay attention. Until now, it’s been largely a one-sided conversation — or at least that’s how it seems in American popular culture. As the narrator explains, “this was the first war where the losers would write history instead of the victors,” and so it is that we’ve heard about the Vietnam War mostly from the point of view of American soldiers, American politicians and American journalists. We’ve never had a story quite like this one before.\n\nMr. Nguyen, who teaches English and American studies at the University of Southern California, was born in Vietnam but raised in the United States. He is the author of an academic book, “Race and Resistance.” How exciting that he also writes fiction, because he has a great deal to say and a knowing, playful, deeply intelligent voice. His novel is a spy thriller, a philosophical exploration, a coming-of-age tale, the story of what it’s like to be an immigrant, to be part-Asian, to be the illegitimate child of a forbidden liaison. It’s about being forced to hide yourself under so many layers that you’re not sure who you are.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
