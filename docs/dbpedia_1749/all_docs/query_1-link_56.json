        "text": "New Voices & Diverse Perspectives from Around the World Emerging and Established Talents & the Most Notable World Premieres & Filmmakers\n\nASPEN, Colo.– Aspen Film, the year-round film arts, and education organization, today announced its program for the 32nd Aspen Shortsfest, April 10-16, 2023. Celebrating over three decades of presenting great shorts, Shortsfest is one of only four Oscar®-qualifying festivals in the US strictly dedicated to short film in the fields of animation, documentary, and live-action narrative. Featuring new works from over 33 countries, with 11 programs, 79 short films, and 74 premieres, each of the 11 programs contains a variety of shorts, from comedies to dramas and documentaries to animation. This year’s Oscar®-qualifying competition will introduce viewers to a hugely diverse array of fast-rising filmmakers.\n\n“We can’t wait for audiences to experience the magical curation of our Shortsfest Programming and the energy created by filmmakers from around the globe. Ten of our films are world premieres, and we’re quite proud that 48% of our 79 titles are either directed or co-directed by women,” remarks Aspen Film Executive + Artistic Director, Susan Wrubel, “During Shortsfest, we also offer our most robust FilmEducates program; filmmakers and industry guests share stories, insight, and lessons with students in the classroom and on the stage.”\n\n“We were knocked out by the abundance of amazing new films by emerging talents from nearly every corner of the world among this year’s submissions,” says Jason Anderson, Shortsfest Director of Programming. “We’re thrilled to showcase so many new voices and new perspectives. We know that our audiences will be just as excited to discover.”\n\nAmong the prize-winning directors with new shorts in the selection are Kayla Abuda Galang (When You Left Me On That Boulevard, Short Film Grand Prize Winner at Sundance 2023), Crystal Kayiza (Rest Stop, Short Film Jury Award Winner at Sundance 2023), and Story Chen (The Water Murmurs, winner of the Palme d’Or for best short film at Cannes 2022). The selection also includes major award-winners by filmmakers in Greece, Canada, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the UK, and Germany.\n\nOther new films at Aspen Shortsfest feature standout turns by performers already familiar to audiences. Among the beloved character actors getting a bigger share of the spotlight at this year’s festival are Total Recall’s Michael Ironside (The Family Circus), Men in Black’s Siobhan Fallon Hagon (All Choked Up), and Orange Is The New Black’s Catherine Curtin (Galapagos). A member of the Cherokee Nation who received an Academy Honorary Award in 2019 for his decades of acclaimed roles that helped expand the range of representation for Indigenous characters on screen, Wes Studi, gives a poignant performance in The Roof, one of the festival’s many world premieres. Australian actor Hugo Weaving of The Matrix and Lord of the Rings franchises serves as narrator for Teacups, a touching new animation by Alec Green and Finbar Watson that makes its international premiere at Shortsfest. The festival also welcomes back alumni director Aemilia Scott, whose latest short Help Me Understand was co-produced by Paul Feig and stars such comedy-world luminaries as Ken Marino, Kate Flannery, and Rachael Harris.\n\nMore highlights among the films making their world premieres at Aspen Shortsfest are: How We Get Free, a powerful documentary profile of bail-reform activist-turned-Colorado State Representative Elisabeth Epps by the celebrated team of Geeta Gandbhir and Samantha Knowles; In The Garden of Tulips, a moving drama about a father and daughter caught up in the events of the Iran-Iraq war by director Julia Elihu; The Miami Vice Incident, an endlessly surprising true-Hollywood-story by Tim Kirk, the producer of such films as Room 237; and The Future’s Past, a hilarious new animation by the viral comedy team known as Chris + Jack. The festival is also proud to showcase the work of Colorado filmmakers such as Lauren Tolfa and Felicia Hettinga, the co-directors of Sean + The Ramblings of a Sculpture Artist.\n\nAWARDS & JURY\n\nAll of this year’s films will be competing for 9 prizes, awarded by three juries, as well as an Audience Award selected by our viewers. Shortsfest award winners will receive cash prizes of $1,250 or $2,500, in the following categories.\n\nNotable 2023 Shortsfest jurors include actor, filmmaker, and author Justine Bateman, who has an impressive, decades-long resume in film and TV that includes a Golden Globe nomination and two Emmy® nominations. Opal Hope Bennett, an Emmy®-winning co-producer and shorts producer at POV, and Kiva Reardon, Vice President, Film at PASTEL, the filmmaking collective founded by Barry Jenkins, Adele Romanski, and Mark Ceryak.\n\nThe Ellen Jury will present its annual Ellen Award for artistic merit and originality to a distinguished filmmaker. This award honors the memory of Aspen Film’s founder and first executive director Ellen Kohner Hunt, who retired in 1995 and passed away in January 2021.\n\nThe Youth Jury, comprised of middle and high school students, awards a student prize to the film that they feel best reflects the impressions, experiences, and thoughts of today’s youth. Filmmakers have said that winning this award is one of the highest honors at the festival.\n\nThe Shortsfest industry special guests for 2023 include four industry notables: Sarah Lash, Senior Director of Acquisitions for Condé Nast Entertainment, the award-winning next-generation studio, along with Sudeep Sharma, a programmer, most notably for the Sundance Film Festival who focuses on documentary feature films; Glenn Kiser, the Director of the Dolby Institute, and Jessica Kantor, a motion picture agent in the Independent Film Group at leading global talent and entertainment company United Talent Agency (UTA).\n\nAspen Shortsfest continued its tradition of Oscar® success with The Martha Mitchell Effect, directed by Anne Alvergue + Debra McClutchy, which screened at Shortsfest 2022 and was nominated for Best Documentary Short at the 2023 Academy Awards. Prior to that, Joanna Quinn and Les Mills’ Affairs of the Art – the jury prize winner for comedy at Shortsfest in 2021 – was nominated for Best Animated Short at the 2022 Academy Awards. Other recent Shortsfest selections that have garnered Oscar® nominations include Daughter by Daria Kashcheeva, Sister by Siqi Song, Brotherhood by Meryam Joobeur (also a jury member at Shortsfest in 2020), and Nefta Football Club by Yves Piat.\n\nThe festival is an industry-recognized destination for discovering breakthrough talent. Reinaldo Marcus Green (King Richard), Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Short Term 12), Damien Chazelle (La La Land, Babylon), Jason Reitman (Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Up in the Air), Sarah Polley (Women Talking) and the late Jean-Marc Vallée (Dallas Buyers Club) are among the notable alumni whose short films first screened at Shortsfest before they became household names.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nAt Shortsfest, Aspen Film’s FilmEducates provides educational opportunities to schools throughout Colorado’s Roaring Fork Valley and beyond. Programs are offered at no charge and aim to engage students and educators in conversations around a selection of age-appropriate films. New this year is the Voices in Film Youth Forum which incorporates a wide variety of youth-focused programming and events during Shortsfest. The forum is an umbrella over key educational programs: Making Movies Matter, Filmmakers to the Classroom, Young Filmmaker Labs, Students to the Festival, and Youth Jury. The week kicks off with a special in-school event at the Aspen District Theatre featuring a selection of this year’s festival films. The interactive program is hosted by youth with a filmmaker Q+A following the films. The event is broadcast live so that students and teachers who cannot attend in person may participate remotely, making the program inclusive and accessible.\n\nTICKETS + PASSES\n\nFor available pass options, please visit: www.aspenfilm.org.
