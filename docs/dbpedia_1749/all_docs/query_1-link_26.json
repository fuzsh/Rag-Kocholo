        "text": "Regan first became involved with CASA in 2001 while living in New York City and studying at Columbia. She completed a one-year internship with CASA-NYC, launching her career advocating for children in the dependency system.\n\nWhile in law school, Regan worked as an investigator for the Law Office of Harold LaFlamme. The law firm contracted with Orange County to provide legal representation–minor’s counsel–for children in foster care. She was a member of her law school’s Moot Court Honors Board, president of the Alternate Dispute Resolution Board and completed a semester-long internship with Justice Richard M. Aronson of the California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, Division Three. She also met her husband at Chapman Law; they married shortly after graduating together in 2005.\n\nUpon receiving her Juris Doctor and passing the California Bar Examination, Regan was promoted from investigator to attorney for the Law Office of Harold LaFlamme. She was assigned to a trial court department at the Lamoreaux Justice Center in Orange, where she represented children in the foster care system.\n\nWhen a child is detained–removed from their home by a social worker because of alleged abuse, neglect, or abandonment–the child is termed a dependent of the state and is the subject of a dependency court case. The child’s fate is then primarily determined by a judicial officer based on the evidence presented in the case. The case is prosecuted by County Counsel. The child’s parents are entitled to be represented by an attorney, and a minor's counsel is appointed to represent and advocate for the child.\n\nIn her role as minor’s counsel, Regan worked with CASA volunteers in the courtroom to obtain their valuable insight into the child’s life, and better advance the child's interests. She later advocated on behalf of dependent children at the Court of Appeal, participating in a number of writ and appeal dependency cases.\n\nFollowing the birth of her first child, Regan worked for a time as a solo practitioner handling private adoptions and as an associate attorney for Rigg & Dean, an Orange County personal injury and liability firm. In 2009, she accepted an invitation to join the Board of Directors of CASA OC, where she served for four years and volunteered as a member of the Holiday Luncheon Committee.\n\nIn 2015, Regan joined the staff of CASA as Chief Program Officer. Regan was elevated to CEO position in December of 2017.\n\nRegan has spent most of her professional life performing work about which she is deeply passionate—advocating for children removed from their homes and separated from their families due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment.\n\n“I have the greatest admiration and respect for the committed individuals who volunteer as Court Appointed Special Advocates and those who give so generously to ensure our organization may continue recruiting, training, and supporting those volunteers,” Regan says.\n\nRegan and her husband reside in North Tustin with their three children and a precocious animal that purports to be a “Bernedoodle,” but more closely resembles a Muppet.\n\nErika Pedersen has over two decades of C-suite executive level sales and strategic account management expertise in global logistics and retail technology, following her graduation from the USC Marshall School of Business Entrepreneur Program. Known to drive performance metrics with integrity, she has led cross-functional international teams and brokered partner relationships with key decision makers throughout her career. In 2004, while expanding her family, Erika secured her Interior Design Credentials from the Interior Designers Institute and served as principal of her residential design practice for five years.\n\nActive in her children's school and multiple community organizations, Erika has been an avid philanthropist in Orange County for over twenty years. Erika began her fundraising efforts at USC JA Town and Gown and then joined the Tinkerbell Guild to support Children's Hospital of Orange County, taking an active role on the executive committee during her 6-year membership. Erika has held leadership positions in Mothers of Pre-Schoolers (MOPS) and as her children matriculated to elementary school, Erika joined the St John's Episcopal School PTF, leading the 25th Anniversary Campaign, developing marketing and recruitment plans, and chaired the St. John's Gala with record breaking net revenue. Erika was active in Young Presidents Organization, serving on the Chapter Executive Board as the Spouse Forum Coordinator, where she grew spouse-only events and doubled forum memberships. Erika’s passion for supporting youth in foster care ignited when she was invited to join the 44 Women for Children and Co-Chaired the Annual Scholarship Luncheon followed by the Orangewood Holiday Tea. She was recruited to join the board of FOCASA (Friends of Court Appointed Special Advocates) where she served as Vice-President followed by President of the Board and as a CASA Governing Board member, to raise awareness and funds to support Orange County youth in foster care.\n\nCombining her professional strategic sales prowess and philanthropic passion, Erika joined CASA as the Chief Development Officer in late 2021, serving on the Executive Leadership Team and Finance Committee. She leads a dynamic multi-functional team including events management, community and corporate partnerships, grants management, donor development and stewardship. In her downtime Erika visits her family ranch in Bozeman, Montana. She enjoys skiing, outdoor adventures, theatre, concerts and traveling with family and friends. Erika resides in Trabuco Canyon with her children.\n\nBefore joining the team at CASA OC, Briana worked for fifteen years as a freelance photographer & writer specializing in community-driven storytelling. After years of youth-related non-profit work, she moved into the creative field. Briana used her success in commercial work to help fund personal work around the world within the service and advocacy communities. Briana has long-admired CASA's strong community presence and track record and knew that if she were to leave freelance work, it would only be for an organization like CASA. She is thrilled to come full circle, returning to the non-profit world in a role allowing her to use her many creative gifts to become an even stronger advocate.\n\nHometown: Oakhurst, California\n\nCurrent Town of Residence: Los Angeles, California\n\nFavorite Quote: “Be curious, not judgemental” - Walt Whitman\n\nLife Mantra: I believe in kindness, mischief, reading, and dancing\n\nInterests:\n\nIn her free time, Briana typically has two modes:\n\n1. Cozy hermit: typically involves excessive reading (preferably in her hammock), embroidery projects, tending to her plants, and watching movies while cuddling with her dog.\n\n2. Social Hummingbird: buzzing around trying anything new; museums, hikes, live music or comedy, discovering new corners of her neighborhood or the world. Briana is passionate about being a conscious traveller. She has visited 49 US states, explored 24 countries, lived abroad in Germany for 4 years, and is determined to visit every continent, including Antarctica .\n\nHer favorite activity is quality time, hosting friends for dinners, game/movie nights, shared projects, and celebrating anything new and exciting in their lives... preferably with a theme!\n\nAfter a successful career serving as an administrative assistant to executive management for corporations such as St. John’s Knits and Ciro Design, Debbie transitioned her time to focus on her family and philanthropic endeavors after the birth of her son.\n\nIn 2002, Debbie began volunteering for The Junior League of Orange County and was heavily involved in their biggest fundraiser, The Christmas Company, where she held various executive positions of leadership that helped raise funds that are given out to various OC charities including Blind Children’s Learning Center, Grandma’s House of Hope, Samueli Academy, Human Trafficking Task Force, and Orangewood Foundation.\n\nDuring this time she also took on leadership roles at her son’s Parent Teacher Association Board, including membership on the 2017-2018 PTSA Board for El Rancho Charter School, and eased her way into serving Servite High School with opportunities including their fashion show and fundraising for the baseball program.\n\nDebbie has pursued her passion for helping others by serving on the Friends of CASA (FOCASA) Board as Vice President and Communications Director and was the Chair for the 2019 FOCASA Holiday Luncheon. Debbie has served on various committees for the FOCASA Holiday Luncheon in the past, including Silent Auction, Operations, and Starfish Wishes. In 2021, Debbie joined the staff at CASA as the Events Manager.\n\nDebbie is a Southern California native who currently resides in Orange with her husband, Joe, and son, Chase. Debbie enjoys challenging herself and has completed two Spartan Trifectas in 2018–which is an award given to competitors who complete a Spartan Sprint Race, Super Race, and Beast Race all in one calendar year. Additionally, she also spends her free time enjoying outdoor activities, traveling, and experiencing local restaurants with friends and family.\n\nLindsey first learned about CASA during a Sociology course at Cal State University San Marcos when a representative from San Diego County’s CASA program spoke about CASA’s mission. Having grown up with cousins who were adopted through foster care, Lindsey learned about their experiences and how often they had to move before finding permanent families and homes. CASA’s mission stuck with Lindsey throughout her time in college and she remembers either wanting to become a CASA or work at CASA when first learning about CASA’s mission.\n\nBesides a brief stint in the corporate retail world, Lindsey has spent most of her career working in the non-profit sector supporting youth in foster care. Prior to CASA, Lindsey worked at group homes for teens and then as a case manager in a transitional housing program for young adults in extended foster care. Working at the group homes, Lindsey's goal was to provide a safe environment for the youth, a positive role model and to simply make their day and stay at the unfamiliar group home setting just a little bit easier for them; since they were already going through so much. In her role as the waitlist coordinator at CASA, Lindsey enjoys taking the time to make youth and CASA matches and then seeing all of the special relationships enjoying their time together at the annual CASA John's Picnic and CASA Holiday Party.\n\nLindsey has lived in Long Beach for over ten years with her husband and loves that Long Beach is a walkable city as she loves walking to the local art theater to catch a film, trying new foods and stumbling upon a live band at different venues. She is also a tribal member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe from southwest Arizona.\n\nRachel Montanye is the Development Coordinator at CASA OC. Her role consists of maintaining donor and event databases, donor acknowledgement, running reports and analyzing data, small campaign fundraising, and providing administrative support for the Development team. She has been with CASA since the end of July 2021 and says she is so grateful to be a part of an organization with such an incredible purpose.\n\nBefore joining CASA OC, she worked full time in retail management while attending graduate school. In January 2021, she received her master’s in political science from CSU Fullerton. Her studies focused on the American government with an emphasis on race and gender politics, human-animal politics, social movements and activism, and political behavior. She is extremely passionate about advocating for others and finds it fitting that she found a place at CASA OC, whose very mission is to advocate for youth in foster care.\n\nRachel grew up in Riverside County but moved to Orange County when she began her undergraduate studies at UC Irvine – Go Anteaters! Zot! Zot! Zot! She is incredibly grateful for her education and the experiences that academia has provided her.\n\nOutside of work, she loves gardening, going for walks, reading books – especially Harry Potter – and making art. Her favorites are painting, embroidery, and nature photography. Additionally, she feels strongly about advocating for human and animal rights, which led her to become vegan and keeps her consistently politically active. She ultimately hopes that she can make a positive impact in the world in any way possible.\n\nRuby, a member of the recruitment team, brings a bright and positive persona to her role. Raised in Orange County, she is deeply passionate about making a positive impact on the lives of children within her community. Ruby's commitment to giving back is exemplified by her active involvement in various community initiatives.\n\nAs a dedicated foster parent, Ruby strives to create a nurturing and secure environment for her foster children, embodying her belief in the transformative power of support and stability. Her hands-on experience in fostering has not only enriched her personal life but has also deepened her understanding of the challenges and needs within the community. Ruby is an alumna of California State University, Long Beach, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts in Sociology. Her academic background equips her with valuable insights into societal structures and dynamics, providing an additional layer of understanding to her work in recruitment. Ruby's educational journey has instilled in her a commitment to fostering inclusivity and empathy in her professional endeavors.\n\nWith a heart dedicated to service and a mind shaped by her academic pursuits, Ruby is an asset to the recruitment team, contributing not only her skills and expertise but also her genuine passion for making a positive difference in the lives of others.\n\nIn her spare time Ruby loves to cook, bake, spend time with friends and family, watching movies, and enjoys listening to podcasts.\n\n\"My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.\" -Maya Angelou\n\nCommunity Philanthropist\n\nCourtney started her career in institutional fixed income sales at Investment Bank, Credit Suisse, in San Francisco and New York.
