        "text": "The CCE just completed its 6th annual EditCon with three days of amazing panel talks, virtual breakout rooms, and networking for over two hundred attendees from Canada and around the world. And after two years of online EditCon we also ventured back in person and hosted events in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.\n\nPresented under the theme “Finding Meaning” we welcomed the editor from SCREAM 6 and WEDNESDAY for our keynote presentation, as well as editors and the sound teams from the binge-worthy shows STRANGER THINGS and HOUSE OF THE DRAGON.\n\nAdditional panels featured the editors from I LIKE MOVIES, CRIMES OF THE FUTURE, VIKING, RICEBOY SLEEPS and BLACK ICE (films that were all on the TIFF TOP 10 list!) as well as GEOGRAPHIES OF SOLITUDE and BACK HOME.\n\nFor our in-person events we welcomed the editing team from FRAGGLE ROCK in Toronto, Women in Post in Vancouver and a Short Film Panel in Montreal.\n\nIt wouldn’t be EditCon without wrapping up the weekend with a good old-fashioned giveaway, thanks to prize donations from our generous sponsors. Afterwards, attendees mingled in a virtual networking world."
