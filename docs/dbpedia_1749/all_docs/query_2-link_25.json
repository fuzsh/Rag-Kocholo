        "text": "Canadians with Vietnamese ancestry\n\nEthnic group\n\nVietnamese Canadians (Vietnamese: Người Canada gốc Việt; French: Canadiens vietnamiens) are Canadian citizens of Vietnamese ancestry. As of 2021, there are 275,530 Vietnamese Canadians, most of whom reside in the provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMainstream Vietnamese communities began arriving in Canada in the mid-1970s and early 1980s as refugees or boat people following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, though a couple thousand were already living in Quebec before then, most of whom were students. After the Fall of Saigon, there were two waves of Vietnamese immigrants to Canada. The first wave consisted mostly of middle-class immigrants. Many of these immigrants were able to speak French and or English and were welcomed into Canada for their professional skills. The second wave consisted of Southern Vietnamese refugees who were escaping the harsh regime that had taken over the former South Vietnam. Many of them (10%)[citation needed] were of Chinese descent and were escaping ethnic persecution resulting from the Sino-Vietnamese War. These south Vietnamese refugees were known globally as the \"boat people\".\n\nIn the years 1979–80, Canada accepted 60,000 Vietnamese refugees.[3] Most new arrivees were sponsored by groups of individuals, temples, and churches and settled in areas around Toronto, Ontario, Vancouver, British Columbia,Winnipeg, Manitoba and Montreal, Quebec. Between 1975 and 1985, 110,000 resettled in Canada (23,000 in Ontario; 13,000 in Quebec; 8,000 in Alberta; 7,000 British Columbia; 5,000 in Manitoba; 3,000 in Saskatchewan; and 2,000 in the Maritime provinces). As time passed, most eventually settled in urban centres like Vancouver (2.2% Vietnamese), Calgary (1.6% Vietnamese), Montreal (1.6% Vietnamese), Edmonton (1.6% Vietnamese), Toronto (1.4% Vietnamese), Ottawa (1.0% Vietnamese), and Hamilton (0.8% Vietnamese).[4]\n\nThe next wave of Vietnamese migration came in the late 1980s and 1990s as both refugees and immigrant classes of post-war Vietnam entered Canada. These groups settled in urban areas, in particular Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and Calgary. In Metro Vancouver, they have settled mainly in East Vancouver, Richmond, and Surrey. In the Montreal area, they settled in Montreal's downtown, South Shore, and the suburb of Laval. In Toronto, they have settled in the city's Chinatown area near Spadina Avenue and Dundas Street West and in the inner suburbs of North York, York, Scarborough, and Etobicoke. Other municipalities in the Toronto area with large Vietnamese Canadian populations include Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, and Markham.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the 2011 National Household Survey, approximately 50% of Vietnamese Canadians identify as Buddhist, 25% identify as Christian, and the rest reported having no religious affiliation.[3][5]\n\nVietnamese-Canadian population by province, 2021 Province Vietnamese population\n\n[6]\n\nOntario 122,735 British Columbia 51,890 Quebec 45,570 Alberta 39,395 Manitoba 7,290 Saskatchewan 4,730 Nova Scotia 1,374 New Brunswick 1,295 Prince Edward Island 730 Northwest Territories 225 Newfoundland and Labrador 175 Yukon 90 Nunavut 0 Canada (2021) 275,530\n\nCanadian metropolitan areas with large Vietnamese-Canadian populations, 2021 City Province 2021 Vietnamese population[citation needed] Greater Toronto Area Ontario 82,225 Greater Montreal Quebec 38,660 Greater Vancouver British Columbia 34,915 Calgary Region Alberta 21,010 Edmonton Capital Region Alberta 14,180 Ottawa-Gatineau Ontario, Quebec 9,650 Winnipeg Capital Region Manitoba 5,580 Waterloo Region Ontario 5,555 Hamilton Ontario 4,855 London Ontario 3,110 Windsor Ontario 2,555 Guelph Ontario 2,425\n\nCommunity issues\n\n[edit]\n\nCrime and gangs\n\n[edit]\n\nA report done by University of British Columbia graduate Andrea Gillman Vietnamese-Canadians were more likely than other visible minorities to face barriers to employment, assimilation, and language proficiency. Gillman stated that family, cultural, and employment factors contributed to the prevalence of Vietnamese crime, poverty, and gang violence:\n\n\"In The New Start for Vietnamese-Canadian Community Forum, the Lac Viet Public Education Society surveyed individuals to identify the causes of crime and victimization within the community. The results have been used to run a series of radio shows addressing these issues. Gang-related issues were identified as the area of most concern, followed by safety, grow-ops, education and health. Employment, family, and school issues were listed as the root cause of crime and victimization. [...] Issues identified specifically by youth as areas of major concern are those related to school, gangs, safety and family. Under these headings, issues include bullying, kidnapping and violence; recruitment into illegal activities; selling and smoking marijuana in schools; and recruitment of female youth into sexual activities.\"[7]\n\nNotable Canadians of Vietnamese origin\n\n[edit]\n\nBusiness\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Canada, local Vietnamese media includes:\n\nViet Nam Thoi Bao — Edmonton magazine[8]\n\nThoi Bao — Toronto newspaper[9]\n\nThoi Bao TV — Toronto[10]\n\nThoi Moi — Toronto newspaper[11]\n\nLittle Saigon Canada — Toronto newspaper\n\nVietnamville — Montreal[12]\n\nPhố Việt Montreal, printed newspaper of Vietnamville.ca\n\nViethomes Magazine — Toronto magazine[13][14]\n\nCulture Magazin — national magazine, first-ever bilingual English-Vietnamese magazine in Canada[15]\n\nIn Vancouver, a large population of Vietnamese Canadians are self-employed; they're business owners of a variety of businesses, stores and restaurants throughout the city. Vietnamese Canadians also brought their cuisine and phở has become a popular food throughout the city. Vietnamese Canadians also reside in Central City, Surrey, which is a rapidly growing suburb of Metro Vancouver.[citation needed]\n\nIn the Toronto area, there are 19 Vietnamese owned supermarkets.[citation needed]\n\nIn Montreal there are about 40,000 Vietnamese Canadian population among highest median income and education of Vietnamese Canadians in major cities. There are more than 100 Vietnamese restaurants, hundreds of small size manufacturers of different products from clothing to technology, about 80 pharmacies and hundreds of doctors, dentists, over a thousand scientists, engineers and technicians, about sixty convenient stores and groceries. Since November 2006, Ngo Van Tan has started a project to promote and build the first 'Vietnam Town' in Canada called 'Vietnamville' near metro Jean Talon including St-Denis, Jean Talon, St-Hubert, and Belanger streets with over 130 businesses already opened in the area. Investment opportunities in Vietnam Town are open to Vietnamese worldwide.[citation needed]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCanada portal\n\nVietnam portal\n\nCanada–Vietnam relations\n\nOverseas Vietnamese\n\nAsian Canadians\n\nVietnamese in Toronto\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nVietnamese Canadian organizations\n\nVietnamese Canadian Federation (Liên hội người Việt Canada)\n\nVietnamese Canadian Community of Ottawa\n\nCommunauté Vietnamienne au Canada – Région de Montréal (Cộng đồng người Việt Quốc gia vùng Montréal)\n\nAbout Vietnamese Canadians"
