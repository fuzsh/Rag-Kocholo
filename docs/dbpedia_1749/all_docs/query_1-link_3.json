        "text": "üö® üö® üö® üíÉ Mahn, I'm so glad our documentary, \"The Gravediggers,\" is out! At its core, The Gravediggers is an attempt at capturing a sliver of the day-to-day experience of the people who quietly cultivate the ground for the dead. Our [Kayode Idowu and I] intention with this doc is not to be didactic, moralizing, or to wring out global implications. üôÖ‚ôÇÔ∏è Instead, our goal is to [hopefully] magnify and [probably] amplify the realities of people who fly under society's radar of what's \"important.\" People considered \"nobodies,\" as American writer Gay Talese put it. People who, although are not famous or powerful, live with a genuine richness and \"a keen sensory awareness of the way the world works.\" Our primary aim with this doc was to capture that we're all ordinary people connecting over the shared experience[s] of living. On a secondary, perhaps more \"selfish\" level, we also wanted to raise a philosophical question: who deserves our attention and why? ü§î While we don't [yet] have neat answers to that question, one thing is clear: we all owe each other the gift of attention ‚Äî urgently, generously, and unflinchingly. Please watch and share The Gravediggers below üòä:\n\nNatasha Bondy - Congratulations marvellous drama! Please sir/madam can we have some more? We need the happy ending, or Hollywood wont be interested. Series 2 - Where did they money go? How the ‚Äúbad actors‚Äù or potentially what the ‚Äúvillains of the piece‚Äù were doing in the PostOffice and Fujitsu. If they reluctant, to tell their story, to assist your process, their emails are emerging which seems ample source material as it is what they were saying, writing and thinking - literally word for word. Seems: - 2 episodes worth in how this mess created - as Banks do very same business (every day) and we do not see similar scale of prosecution of bank managers - the technical side.. - 2 more for sub-postmaster stories of woes, comfort & joy Series 3 - The greatest miscarriages of Justice in UK What happened to all post Series 1. TV show, Media storm, whistleblowers arise, public inquiries, parliamentary committees and public interest (googlebox et al), Government action (ok i can dream‚Ä¶) Also key question yet to be answered‚Ä¶. Why did the issues ‚Äúcluster‚Äù at Jo Hamiltons branch and repeat each day and get to ¬£36,000 clearly she did nothing much wrong under the circumstances. But we need to set her mind, and 900 others, at rest! Find the real IT Sherlock holmes! He/She/IT and the answer is in plain sight - ü§´\n\nPeople often gets confused with the terms Script and Screenplay. Here is a clarification post - A script and a screenplay are terms often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between them. A script is a more general term that refers to the written text of a performance, whether it's for a play, a movie, a TV show, or even a radio broadcast. On the other hand, a screenplay specifically refers to the script written for a film or television show. So, while all screenplays are scripts, not all scripts are necessarily screenplays."
