It points to connections and rifts between our human-constructed world and the systems and cycles of nature. She engages architecture and urban structure as ever-accumulating evidence of human aspirations and failures, often contrasting and intertwining them with geological and organic formations. Her work draws on anthropology, architecture, urban planning and historical and fictional explorations of utopia/dystopia. It also leans heavily into material process, intentionally bringing joy, improvisation, and care into the work as it reflects on human patterns of extraction and construction.\n\nLópez has received grants and fellowships, including a NYFA Fellowship in Drawing / Printmaking / Book Arts, a grant from the Joan Mitchell Foundation, and a Sovern/Columbia Affiliated Fellowship at the American Academy in Rome. She has also participated in residencies including at the Headlands Center for the Arts and La Curtiduría in Oaxaca, Mexico. Her work is held in numerous prominent institutional collections and has been exhibited throughout the United States and internationally, including at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, MoMA and the Guggenheim Museum in NY, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museo Rufino Tamayo in Mexico City, the Denver Art Museum, the Nevada Museum of Art, the Albuquerque Museum and the Inside-Out Museum in Beijing.\n\nHer work is represented by Elizabeth Leach Gallery in Portland, OR and Arróniz Arte Contemporáneo in Mexico City. Originally from Santa Fe, NM, she lives and works in Brooklyn, NY and is an Associate Professor of Visual Arts at Columbia University’s School of the Arts.\n\nwww.nicolalopez.com\n\nLecture organized by MFA Print Media & Photography\n\nLISA CORINNE DAVIS\n\nTuesday, January 30, 2024 • 7:00 PM\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nLisa Corinne Davis is an abstract painter exploring themes of racial, social and psychological identity. Born in Baltimore, MD, currently living and working in Brooklyn, NY, Davis received her BFA from Pratt Institute, and her MFA from Hunter College. Her paintings have been exhibited across the United States and in Europe, including one person shows at June Kelly Gallery (New York), Gerald Peters Gallery (New York), and The Mayor Gallery (London). She is currently represented by Jenkins Johnson Gallery (San Francisco, Los Angeles & New York), Miles McEnery (New York), and The Mayor Gallery (London). Her work is included in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, The Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Davis is the recipient of numerous awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Grant, a National Endowment for the Arts Visual Artist Fellowship, three Artist Fellowships from The New York Foundation for the Arts, and a Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant. In 2017, she was inducted as a National Academician at the National Academy Museum & School. Her essays on art and culture have been published in the Brooklyn Rail and Art Critical. Davis has previously taught painting at Yale University and is currently Professor and the Co-Director of the MFA program at Hunter College in New York.\n\nLecture organized by MFA Painting\n\nLUCIA HIERRO\n\nTuesday, February 13, 2024 • 7:00 PM\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nLucia Hierro (b. 1987) is a Dominican American conceptual artist born and raised in New York City, Washington Heights/Inwood, and currently based in the South Bronx. Lucia’s practice, which includes sculpture, digital media and installation, confronts twenty-first century capitalism through an intersectional lens. She received a BFA from SUNY Purchase (2010) and an MFA from Yale School of Art (2013). Hierro’s work has been exhibited at venues including the Bronx Museum of the Arts, Jeffrey Deitch Gallery (Los Angeles), Elizabeth Dee Gallery (New York), Primary Projects (Miami), Sean Horton Presents (Dallas), Fabienne Levy Gallery (Lausanne, Switzerland) and Casa Quien in the Dominican Republic. Her works reside in the collections of the Guggenheim Museum New York, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (MCASD), El Museo del Barrio in New York City, the Perez Art Museum Miami, the JP Morgan & Chase Collection, among others. In 2021, Lucia’s work was exhibited in ESTAMOS BIEN: LA TRIENAL 20/21, El Museo del Barrio’s (NY) first national large-scale survey of Latinx contemporary art featuring more than 40 artists from the US and Puerto Rico, and she was the subject of a solo exhibition at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, CT titled Marginal Costs. Lucia will have a solo show titled “Corotos y Ajuares” at the Esker Foundation (Calgary, Canada) January 20th – April 28th 2024.\n\nLecture organized by MFA Painting\n\nJUSTINE KURLAND\n\nTuesday, February 27, 2024 • 7:00 PM\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nJustine Kurland is an artist known for her utopian photographs of American landscapes and the fringe communities, both real and imagined, that inhabit them. Her early work comprises photographs, taken during many cross-country road trips, that counter the masculinist mythology of the American landscape, offering a radical female imaginary in its place. Her recent series of collages, SCUMB Manifesto, continues to make space for women by transforming books by canonized male photographers into a new feminist form.\n\nKurland’s work has been exhibited at museums and galleries in the United States and abroad. Her work is included in permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Carnegie Museum, Pennsylvania; Getty Museum, California; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and the Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal, among others.\n\nLecture organized by MFA Painting and MFA Print Media & Photography\n\nDANA LOK\n\nTuesday, March 5, 2024 • 7:00 PM\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nDana Lok (b. Berwyn, PA) lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. Her paintings and drawings explore the visual possibilities of metaphors we use to understand concepts like knowledge, representation, language and time. Her works imbue these abstract ideas and their relations with light, color, weight and texture. In the development of these pictorial objects and spaces, she keeps an eye towards the contradictions that can surface in a close examination of visual forms that structure thought.\n\nLok has exhibited widely in the United States and Europe. Her recent solo exhibitions include “Closer to the Metal” at Clima Gallery, Milan (2023), “Part and Parse” at Miguel Abreu, New York (2022), “One Second Per Second” at Page, New York (2020), and “Words Without Skin” at Clima, Milan (2019). Lok recently participated in the group exhibitions “Darling, Your Head’s Not Right” at Francois Ghebaly, “Le Biscuit à Soupe”, at High Art, Arles, France, “Gravity, a proposal” at Sikkema Jenkins, New York, “15 Painters” at Andrew Kreps, New York. Her work has been featured in the New York Times, Hyperallergic, Frieze, and Cura Magazine. Lok received her MFA from Columbia University and attended Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. In 2018, she was awarded the Rema Hort Mann Emerging Artist Grant. She currently teaches at Columbia University.\n\nLecture organized by MFA Painting\n\nASHLEY JAMES (MULTIPLE FORMATS)\n\nThursday, March 21, 2024 • 7:00 PM\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nAshley James, Ph.D., is Associate Curator, Contemporary Art at the Solomon R.

Referencing familiar structures, such as doors, windows, stairs, and railings, her works riff on existing built environments through fragmentation, abstraction, and rearticulation.\n\nRecent solo exhibitions include There Is No Far and No Near at Smack Mellon (Brooklyn, NY) and A Dream Walking at Real Art Ways (Hartford, CT). Wu’s work has been shown in group exhibitions at YveYANG Gallery (New York, NY), island gallery (New York, NY), Asia Art Archive in America (Brooklyn, NY), M23 (New York, NY), The Shed (New York, NY), The Mattatuck Museum (Waterbury, CT), and Shaker Museum | Mount Lebanon (New Lebanon, NY), among others.

After graduating with an undergraduate degree in art from UCLA in 1984, he became a founding member of the collaborative performance group SHRIMPS. This group worked together on movement-based performances until 1993. Back at UCLA for his MFA from 1992 to 1995, he began to create both intimate and large sculptures, photographs that documented performative moments, and videos that presented his body as an object within a world deteriorating around him.\n\nHis interest in machines, entropy, sound, and cultural debris has produced work that examines the dynamic tension between failure and success, the individual and the group, and the thin line between humor and misfortune. Since 1995, Kersels’ objects and projects have been exhibited at museums both nationally and internationally, including the 1997 and 2010 Whitney Biennials, the Pompidou Center, MOCA Los Angeles, the Pompidou Brussels, the L.A. County Museum of Art, the Tinguely Museum, Kunsthalle Bern, MAMCO in Geneva, and the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. He is the recipient of fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Joan Mitchell Foundation, and the Foundation for Contemporary Art.\n\nHis work is in the collections of MoMA, the Whitney Museum, the Pompidou Center, and many other public collections. He is represented by the galleries Mitchell-Innes & Nash in New York and Galerie Georges-Philippe & Nathalie Vallois in Paris.\n\nFor the last 11 years, he has been a professor at the Yale School of Art.\n\nLecture organized by MFA Sculpture\n\nHONG HONG\n\nTuesday, April 16, 2024 • 7:00 PM\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nEach summer and fall, Hong Hong travels to faraway and distinct locations to make paper under the sky. Hong’s environmental, site-specific investigations map interstitial relationships between landscape, time, and the body through cartographic, symbolic, and material languages. During the winter and spring, she forms paintings directly on the floor of her studio. These schematics combine story-telling, text, and image-making to document states of interiority and subjectivity. Hong Hong (b. 1989, Hefei, Anhui, China) is the recipient of a Tulsa Artist Fellowship (2024 – 2026), a United States Artists Fellowship in Craft (2023), a Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant in Painting (2023), a Carnegie Foundation Fellowship at MacDowell (2020), a Helen Frankenthaler Foundation Fellowship at Vermont Studio Center (2019), an Artistic Excellence Fellowship from the Connecticut Office of Arts (2019), and a Creation of New Work Grant from the Edward C. And Ann T. Roberts Foundation (2018 – 2019). She also participated in residencies at McColl Center for Art + Innovation (2022), Houston Center for Contemporary Craft (2020 – 2021), Yaddo (2019), and I-Park (2018).\n\nHong has presented her work in exhibitions at Real Art Ways (Hartford, CT), Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art (Bentonville, AR), Fitchburg Art Museum (Fitchburg, MA), Center for Maine Contemporary Art (Rockland, ME), Ortega Y Gasset Projects (New York, NY), Georgia Museum of Art (Athens, GA), NXTHVN (New Haven, CT), Tiger Strikes Asteroid (Los Angeles, CA), Akron Art Museum (Akron, OH), Texas Asia Society (Houston, TX), and University of Texas at Dallas (Dallas, TX), among others.

Conway received a BFA from Cooper Union School of Art and a MFA from Columbia University and has been recognized with a Guggenheim Fellowship Award, two Pollock-Krasner Awards, an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, and a Colene Brown Art Prize. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally, including at MOMA PS1, American Academy of Arts and Letters, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, University Art Museum at Albany, Fralin Museum of Art, and Collezione Maramotti Museum in Italy. Conway’s work has been reviewed and featured in Artforum, Art in America, Art Review, Flash Art, Frieze, Hyperallergic, The New Yorker, The New York Times, New American Paintings, among others.\n\nConway is known for detailed, enigmatic paintings that often depict uneasy, absurdist moments descending on isolated, ordinary individuals. In Artforum, Rachel Churner described the abundance of detail in Conway’s paintings as being somehow recognizable in our current world “when the barrage of details makes it impossible to determine one’s position in the world”. Conway has said of her work that many of her paintings depict fragments from unfolding narratives in which ordinary people are suddenly confronted by forces much greater than themselves, either due to circumstances beyond their control or because of an unexpected momentary suspension of disbelief. The paintings are windows onto brief moments of radical experience that take place wherever we least expect them. The ambiguity the viewer senses in these narratives derives from the inability to know the internal nature of the subjects’ epiphanies. Conway has said, “much of the suspense in my work is a kind of anticipation…I like to make paintings that seem to be holding their breath, waiting for what may be next.”\n\nTHOMAS CASTRO\n\nTuesday, October 17, 2023 • 7:00 PM\n\nHoward Thurman Center, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nThomas Castro is a graphic designer, educator, and curator. He co-founded LUST in 1996 as a multi-disciplinary design studio at the intersection of graphic design, digital arts, and technology. In 2017 LUST was awarded the highest recognition for design in the Netherlands, the BNO Piet Zwart Award for their 20-year oeuvre. Thomas taught at the graphic design department of the ArtEZ University of the Arts Arnhem from 2002, and was the head of department from 2012–2019. In 2019, Thomas was appointed the Curator of Graphic Design at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam.\n\n“I see my practice as a trilogy, from maker to educator to curator. In my current role as curator I want to focus on the heritage of graphic design. How can we recalibrate and broaden the current design canon with new attitudes, knowledge, and developments within the contemporary socio-cultural landscape? And how can we embrace and support more diverse forms of graphic design which at times only have a street life of one day.”\n\nThomas Castro is also the Fall 2023 Tim Hamill Visiting Artist Lecture. This important public lecture series launched in 2004 is named in honor of BU School of Visual Arts alumnus Tim Hamill. Hamill Lectures presents to the SVA community leading artists who are known for working across artistic disciplines.\n\nNYEEMA MORGAN\n\nThursday, October 26, 2023 • 7:00 PM\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nNyeema Morgan (b.

A story teller, Nguyen’s multidisciplinary practice takes two forms—her more traditional fine arts practice, which encompasses her lush, dense paintings, as well as her prints, drawings, and unique artist books, and her publishing practice, embodied through her imprint, Passenger Pigeon Press, which creates and distributes Martha’s Quarterly, a subscription of artist books and interdisciplinary collaborations. Across both domains Nguyen’s work aims to unsettle, and the tension between the artist’s elegant forms and harmonious aesthetics often belies the nature of her content. The confusion this dissonance creates becomes generative, opening space for reevaluation, radical thinking, and the dislodging of complacency.\n\nMany of Nguyen’s paintings expand from her unique artist books, often through engagement with similar themes, questions, or investigations. Throughout her work, she has explored a range of topics and ideas, including the Bandung conference, the first large-scale Afro-Asian conference which was attended by world leaders from 29 non-aligned countries during the Cold War, Forest City, a sprawling off-shore development project in Malaysia, and the red-shanked douc langur, an endangered species of monkey native to Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. A recent artist book series, Four Ways Through a Cave (2021), relates Nguyen’s travels through the Phong Nha-Ke Bang karst in Vietnam, significant for its numerous underground caverns and passageways and its history in the Vietnam War as a crucial area of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The book simultaneously invokes Plato’s allegory of the cave—the recognition of truth through the loss of illusion—and conveys the sense of physically moving through a cave, with circular-shaped cutouts that shift from page to page, tunneling through the book and transforming the reader into a momentary spelunker.\n\nIn 2008, Nguyen received a Fulbright fellowship to study lacquer painting in Vietnam. Her recent paintings reflect influences of this traditional technique in their remarkable flatness, colored grounds, use of gold and silver leaf, and her rich, intricately layered compositions. In Nguyen’s newest paintings she re-envisions the Stations of the Cross, filling the picture plane with references ranging from the biblical, to the historical, to the contemporary. Fighter jets fill the sky of one station, in which Jesus’ face has been transformed into a commedia mask, while in another the outline of a Pan American airliner can be identified. Commercial ships emblazoned with names like Enterprise, Constitution, and Truth sail across the 14 panels, implying the deep interconnection between commerce, colonialism, religion, and global politics.\n\nAt its core, Nguyen’s, collaborative, research-based practice is propositional, exploring ideas and conjectures for ways of looking at the past, examining the present, and imagining possible futures. Across her work, Nguyen addresses the question of how one reads, both visually and linguistically, and she considers the idea of multiple narratives being told simultaneously, held together by the edges of her compositions or spines of her books.\n\nVICTORIA ROTH\n\nTuesday, November 28, 2023 • 7:00 PM\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nVictoria Roth is a visual artist living and working in Brooklyn, NY. Her biomorphic abstract paintings sit on the edge of recognition— a chunky form that feels like a muscle, a furry shape that’s like a creature from a dream. Through her imagined and high keyed compositions, she explores ideas of queer abstraction and queer desire as embedded in bodily forms that appear to be in constant becoming. While her paintings are loud and visceral, their resonance is psychological, and their read is slow.\n\nVictoria has exhibited her paintings and drawings internationally. Recent solo exhibitions include Velvet Nerve, Broadway Gallery, New York, NY (2022); Victoria Roth, Brennan & GrifMin, New York, NY (2019); Insides, fAN Kunstverein, Vienna, AT (2017); Off the Banks, Brennan & GrifMin, New York, NY (2017).\n\nSelected group exhibitions include Deep! Down! Inside!, Hales Gallery, New York, NY (2023); Pizza, Kate Werble Gallery, New York, NY (2023); Postcard from New York – Part III, Galleria Anna Marra, Rome, IT (2022); Intertwined, 1969 Gallery, New York, NY (2021); Isolation is the Mother of Invention, Institute of Arab & Islamic Art, New York, NY (2021); Eddysroom @ Left Field Gallery, Left Field Gallery, Los Osos, CA (2021); City Prince/sses, Palais de Tokyo, Paris, FR (2019); Body/Object, George Adams Gallery, New York, NY (2019); The Pit Presents / Step Sister, The Pit, Los Angeles, CA (2018); Furies, Helena Anrather, New York, NY (2018); The Clear and the Obscure, Lulu, Mexico City, MX (2016) and more. She is in the public collection of Le Nouveau Musée National de Monaco, Monaco.\n\nVictoria Roth grew up in France and received an MFA from Columbia University in 2014 and a BA in History of Art & Architecture and Visual Arts from Brown University in 2008. In addition to her studio practice, Victoria is an arts educator in New York City.\n\nJONATHAN MILDENBERG\n\nTuesday, December 12, 2023 • 7:00 PM\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nWith a practice that spans sculpture, installation, sound, and writing, Jonathan Mildenberg’s work investigates the intricate (and often hidden) systems of signs, symbols, and suggestions that are embedded within architecture, objects, and design. Through his uncanny replications, surreal juxtapositions, and absurd contextual re-imaginings, his work finds points of incoherence and breakdown within the internal logic of built space as it relates to our own personal and/or shared cultural experiences within our current contemporary moment.\n\nJonathan Mildenberg (b. 1981) is a multidisciplinary artist who lives and works between Chatham and Brooklyn, NY. He received his BFA in photography from Massachusetts College of Art in 2003 and his MFA in sculpture from the Yale School of Art in 2015, for which he was the nominee in Sculpture for the Toby Devan Lewis Fellowship. The following year in 2016, he was awarded a fellowship for Architecture and Environmental Design from the New York Foundation for the Arts.\n\nIn 2017, he began working with the New York-based downtown gallery, M23 and became represented by them in 2021. Recent exhibitions include his last solo show, “The Drowning Dog,” in 2022, 100 Sculptures at Anonymous Gallery in New York City, and Distant Sounds at Olio Projects in Philadelphia, PA, amongst others.\n\nHe has been a visiting lecturer and critic at multiple institutions, including Columbia University, Massachusetts College of Art, SUNY College at Old Westbury, and the University of Minnesota. He has been teaching Sound and Video Art and New Media studies at Caldwell University since 2019.\n\nField Visions Exhibition Panel\n\nTuesday, September 13, 2022 • 7:30 pm\n\nStone Gallery, 855 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nBU College of Fine Arts School of Visual Arts presents a lecture with artist Field Visions, currently on view in the BU Art Galleries Stone Gallery, explores the possibilities of landscape – specifically, how abstraction, metaphor, and materiality are leveraged to open up these possibilities, and in doing so, render nature into an abstraction that becomes landscape. While each artist propels their unique poetic visions through an established genre, they also push material and the fiction outward, tree-like, proving that the field of landscape painting is not only pliable but expansive, and imagination is constantly unfolding and inventing new spaces.\n\nJoin us in the Stone Gallery on September 13 at 7:30 for a panel discussion from three Field Visions artists, Matt Hufford, Matt Murphy, Stephanie Pierce, and moderator Josephine Halvorson. This panel is hosted by the BU Art Galleries and the School of Visual Arts.\n\nJosephine Halvorson makes paintings that foreground firsthand experience by observing and describing the world around her. Originally from Cape Cod, she studied at The Cooper Union (BFA) and Columbia University (MFA). She lived, taught, and exhibited her work throughout the United States and Europe before returning to Massachusetts in 2016 to serve as Professor of Art and Chair of MFA Painting here at Boston University. In 2021, Halvorson was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship and in 2022 had a solo exhibition at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nMatt Hufford, originally from Sacramento, CA, now lives and works in Boston, MA. He has shown work from San Diego to New York, and received his MFA in painting from Boston University in 2019. Matt creates paintings that explore the connection between the surface of a painting and its subject through the use of material, composition, and display.\n\nMatthew Murphy is a painter living and working in Boston, MA. He has shown at Mass Art, Western CT State University, University of Arkansas and New Bedford Museum of Art. He has a BFA from Mass College of Art in Boston and an MFA from the University of Washington in Seattle. He has been artist in residence at Siena Art Institute in Italy and a forthcoming residency at the Joseph and Anni Albers Foundation in Ireland. He is also the Arts Editor for Grid Books.\n\nStephanie Pierce’s paintings explore relationships between light, time, and perception as it is reconsidered over time. Stephanie has exhibited her work at Steven Harvey Fine Art Projects, NY; Alpha Gallery, Boston; The Henry Art Gallery, Seattle; and The Staten Island Museum, NY. She has been a recipient of a Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters and Sculptors Grant and a Peter S. Reid Foundation Grant. Her work has been published in the New Yorker Magazine and Harper’s Magazine. Stephanie is an Assistant Professor of Painting at the Fashion Institute of Technology in NYC. She lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nJennie Jieun Lee\n\nTuesday, September 20, 2022 • 7:30pm\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nFor over a decade, Jennie Jieun Lee has challenged conventions of ceramic sculpture, embracing the inherent vulnerability of a medium that has long been tamed by its practitioners. Across busts, vessels, and painting, Lee’s works accumulate indices both deliberate and accidental, grafts that both decorate and distort. Firing works in various states of uprightness and collapse, Lee also imparts ceramic’s requisite hollowness in another reflexive maneuver. References to gestural painting abound in Lee’s work: the artist covers her busts and vessels in liberal pours of glaze, in addition to working in two dimensions. Transferring the immediacy and authenticity conferred upon gestural painting to sculpture, Lee disrupts a medium typically associated with the domestic.\n\nJennie Jieun Lee (b. Seoul, Korea) lives and works in Sullivan County, New York. Recent solo exhibitions include Cooper Cole, Toronto, Canada (2021); Halsey McKay Gallery, East Hampton (2020, 2018); and Martos Gallery, New York (2019, 2015). She is the recipient of several grants including Art Matters (2019), The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2017), and the Pollock Krasner Foundation Grant (2016) and Artadia (2015). She has a forthcoming solo exhibition with Martos Gallery this September and teaches ceramics at SMFA in Boston, MA.\n\nDoron Langberg\n\nTuesday, October 11, 2022 • 7:30 pm\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nBorn in 1985 in Yokneam Moshava, Israel, Doron Langberg currently lives and works in New York City.

She is opening her attention to Buckthorn root balls, depth psychology, difference, climate change, ecosystems, permaculture, New England furniture and textiles, John Coltrane, the effects of soul lag on humans, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets, the color of the light in the bare woods, and the emotional landscapes of students, friends, colleagues and strangers alongside whom she lives. She quit her position as Senior Critic at Yale University this summer and she is freelance teaching from home. In 2021 she opened a mid-career survey show at the Blaffer in Houston, Texas, called Comic Relief and accompanied by a monograph.\n\nKate Gilbert\n\nThursday, October 27, 2022 • 7:30 pm\n\nBoston Society for Architecture,290 Congress St. Suite 200\n\nOrganized in partnership with the Boston Society for Architecture on occasion of the exhibition Now What?! Advocacy, Activism & Alliances in American Architecture Since 1968. A tour of the exhibition will take place at 8:30pm following the lecture.\n\nKate Gilbert cultivates the critical role the arts and artists play in transforming our cities, our relationships, and ourselves. These investigations manifest in artwork, a curatorial practice, and dedication to expanding the field of public art.\n\nAs an artist and cultural worker, Gilbert strives to facilitate joy and spontaneity and to drive public appreciation of contemporary art practices. Gilbert, the product of generations of creatives who didn’t dare call themselves artists, cites her over-active childhood imagination and early exposure to large-scale sculpture as critical factors in her creative investigations. As a natural collaborator and problem solver, her studio practice morphed into a curatorial consulting practice for public art initiatives and in 2015, the founding of the Boston public art non-profit Now and There where she has developed a Public Art Accelerator.\n\nGilbert is a graduate of Connecticut College and earned her MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University. She is the 2020 recipient of NEFA’s Newell Flather Award for Leadership in Public Art, for curation and her artwork is in the Fidelity Corporate Art Collection as well as many Boston households thanks to her participatory workshops. Gilbert lives and works in Boston, MA with her husband and escapes to a small studio in East Boston to keep her artistic practice alive. Even if only on Sundays.\n\nKenny Rivero\n\nTuesday, November 8, 2022 • 7:30 pm\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nKenny Rivero (b. 1981, New York; works in New York. MFA Yale 2012, BFA SVA 2006.) Rivero’s work, which spans paintings, collage, drawings, and sculpture, explores the complexity of identity through narrative images, language, and symbolism. His aim is to deconstruct the histories and identities he has been raised to understand as absolute and to re-engineer them into new wholes, with new functions. His creative process allows him to explore what he perceives as the broken narrative of Dominican American identity, socio-geographic solidarity, familial expectations, race, and gender roles. Rivero cites the hybrid qualities of salsa, hip-hop, house music, jazz, and merengue—as well as Vodun and Santeria, which were present in his daily life growing up—as core influences on his decision-making in the studio. Kenny Rivero’s work is represented in notable public collections including The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; El Museo del Barrio, New York; The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Collection of Thomas J. Watson Library, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida, The Crystal Bridges Museum in Bentonville, Arkansas; and the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University in Durham North Carolina.\n\nMo Kong\n\nTuesday, November 15, 2022 • 7:30 pm\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nMo Kong is a multidisciplinary artist and researcher currently residing in Queens, NY.

Her work has been featured in Chronogram Magazine, New American Paintings, Art Maze Magazine, and Maake Magazine.\n\nPadma’s works on fabric come from an interior place of living two cultural lives and manifests from digging through the past of personal monuments and archived histories. Gathering personal symbols authenticates the forgotten and resurrects it to be experienced again. It is a path to observe an alternate unfolding of events and offers a new ontology. Her imagery on paper, textile, and ceramic all talk to the ritualistic narratives specific to the house and home, such as preparing food and the textile fragments that make up her shell and shelter. Recollecting these souvenirs and artifacts, she embraces the idea of the woven to create images that instigate psychological elasticity yet are still bound by opposing threads.\n\nNontsikelelo Mutiti\n\nMultiple Formats Contemporary Art Book Symposium and Book Fair Keynote Speaker\n\nThursday, March 16, 2023 • 7:30 PM\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nNontsikelelo Mutiti is a Zimbabwean-born visual artist and educator.

Quevedo’s practice spans installation, drawings, and prints, incorporating and subverting aspects of abstraction, painting, collage, cartography, and sports imagery. Deeply engaged with notions of identity and the intersection of mainstream and historically marginalized cultures, Quevedo reenvisions pre- and post-colonial iconographies, offering nuanced examinations of personal and social histories. This recuperation of indigenous languages of abstraction, the revalorization of their associated labor, and the centering of a living connection between contemporary and centuries-old cultural markers remain key to Quevedo’s ongoing practice.\n\nRonny Quevedo was commissioned by Delta Air Lines in partnership with the Queens Museum to create a large-scale permanent installation at LaGuardia Airport, Queens, NY, for the newly-renovated Terminal C, which opened to the public in 2022. Quevedo’s work has been the subject of numerous one-person exhibitions, including Ronny Quevedo: offside at the University Art Museum, University of Albany, NY (2022); Ronny Quevedo: at the line, Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, Colorado College, CO (2021); Space of Play, Play of Space, Martin Art Gallery, Muhlenberg College, Allentown, PA (2019); no hay medio tiempo / there is no halftime, Queens Museum, NY (2017), traveled to Temple Contemporary, Tyler School of Art and Architecture, Philadelphia, PA (2019); and Home Field Advantage, Casita Maria Center for Arts & Education, the Bronx, NY (2015). Quevedo has also been included in a number of group exhibitions, including A New Way to Travel: Delta Air Lines x Queens Museum at LaGuardia Airport, Queens Museum, NY (2022); Lux et Veritas, NSU Art Museum, Fort Lauderdale, FL (2022); ReVisión, Denver Art Museum, CO (2021); Comunidades Visibles: The Materiality of Migration, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY (2021); Ace: Art on Sports, Promise, and Selfhood, University Art Museum, University of Albany, NY (2019); Pacha, Llacta, Wasichay; Indigenous Space, Modern Architecture, New Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2018); and The World’s Game: Fútbol and Contemporary Art, Perez Art Museum, Miami (2018)\n\nCole Lu\n\nTuesday, April 25, 2023 • 7:30 PM\n\nRoom 410, 808 Commonwealth Avenue\n\nCombining literary and historical references with autobiographical experiences, Cole Lu’s practice builds new mythologies that carry echoes of trauma, transformation, and regeneration. Lu questions the theistic concept of creatio ex nihilo (creation out of nothingness), proposing a more complicated interspersal of time and human existence.\n\nIncorporating classical approaches and often surprising usages of distinctive materials, Lu creates portraiture with engraving and pyrography techniques; he writes with fire, scorching the portrait into a mural of historical fiction (mythical retelling) and historical facts (historical artifact). His writing/ burning is a portal of material and linguistic transition. His further use of poetry is visual as well as formal. Lu (re)invents, (re)names, and (re)writes his subjects, composing each work with an elaborate fragmented title—a literary device that further subverts conventional linear narratives and amplifies his poetic vision.\n\nPresented as a compilation of gestures or a collection of brief anecdotes, Lu’s work unfolds serially, following invented characters through a parallel world of his creation. Each exhibition or body of work reveals another element, broadening his narrative to incorporate new sites and characters. Each work is a continuation of a belief system generating the renderings of an inner transformation through invoking mythologies that are both alien and familiar.\n\nCole Lu (b. Taipei, Taiwan) lives and works in New York, NY. His work has been exhibited at Chapter NY; New York; Company Gallery; New York; The Drawing Center, New York; the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia; the Contemporary Art Museum, St. Louis; La Casa Encendida, Madrid; and the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, St. Louis, among others. His writing has appeared in Coffee House Press, Minneapolis; WONDER, New York; and The Seventh Wave, New York. His publication Smells Like Content (Endless Editions, 2015) is in the artists’ book collection of the Museum of Modern Art Library, New York.\n\nMeena Hasan\n\nMonday, September 20, 2021\n\nMeena Hasan (born 1987, NYC) received her B.A. in Studio Art from Oberlin College in 2009 and her MFA in Painting and Printmaking from Yale School of Art in 2013, where she won the Carol Schlosberg Memorial Prize for Painting.

This ongoing lecture series was launched in 2004 and is named in honor of BU School of Visual Arts alumnus Tim Hamill. The bi-annual Hamill Lecture presents artists who are leaders in the field known for working across artistic disciplines.\n\nDona Nelson is a painter who often works both sides of a stretched canvas, staining and washing it with acrylic paint and water, using a spatula to mark the canvas with the first image, an image of the stretcher bars. Sometimes she glues strips of fabric on to the canvas, allowing them to be a constructed element or ripping them off to establish a drawn line through the paint. Nelson prefers to exhibit her two sided paintings on steel stands or wooden constructions, out on the gallery floor rather than parallel to the wall. For fifty years, Nelson has made series of different kinds of paintings, distinguished by a variety of approaches to both image and material.\n\nNelson was born in Grand Island, Nebraska in 1947. She received a B.F.A. from Ohio State University (1968), and studied at the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program (1967). She is a Professor of Painting and Drawing at Tyler School of Art, Temple University, Philadelphia, where she has worked since 1991.

His practice across painting and sculpture is grounded in labor and craft, but also in contrasts between knowing and uncertainty, clarity and mystery. Most recently his paintings have been still lifes of oranges, drawing on traditions from Baroque Spanish and Dutch painting, Seurat’s Pointillism, and Belgian Surrealism. Formally the works are composed of hard lines, clear shapes and colors, and transparent methods. But this directness works to mask ambiguity in the depiction and representation of its subjects. Seeming certainty is played against fuzziness of understanding to highlight the difficulty of locating and grasping the objects around us and in turn of knowing the self.\n\nAnderson’s work has been exhibited in the U.S. and Europe at institutions such as The ICA Boston, Artspace New Haven, and White Columns in New York, and galleries including Klaus von Nichtssagend, Ashes/Ashes, James Cohan, Downstairs Projects, 179 Canal, Melas Papadopoulos, and Robert Miller.\n\nAnthony Romero\n\nTuesday, November 30, 2021\n\nAnthony Romero is a Boston-based artist, writer, and organizer committed to documenting and supporting artists and communities of color.

She has also worked with numerous institutions and programs to develop dialogue and workshops on the importance of cultural appropriation concerning Indigenous design work.\n\n“Diné (Navajo) weaving is more than technique and craftsmanship; it is a connection to the Diné concept of Hozhó (balance) within nature. My work focuses on reinterpreting the symbolic abstractions of our creation stories, cosmologies, and social structures, using a combination of traditional and nontraditional materials. Na’ashjéii Asdzáá (Spider Woman), who taught the ways of weaving, is one of the most important deities to the Diné and is the most prevalent motif used in my work. She was the first to weave her web of the universe while spreading Hózhó Náhásdlíí’ (Beauty Way) teachings of balance within the mind, body, & soul. This narrative formulates an understanding of certain aspects of Diné Bahané (creation story) as well as bringing Na’ashjéii Asdzáá into the art world and providing my audience a window into the world of the Diné.”\n\nMace received her MA and MFA degrees in Photography and Textile Design at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her BFA in Photography from the Institute of American Indian Arts. She is currently a lecturer in photography at UW–Madison and a photographer for the Center of Design and Material Culture.\n\nHer work as an artist and scholar has been exhibited nationally and internationally at various conferences and galleries.

He enjoys the tinkering that comes with painting pictures. Robert’s paintings draw from a breadth of historical and personal references. Through experimentation he has invented a signature, deconstructive approach to figurative painting that relies on the premise that images are to be bent and folded, taken apart and put back together again; a belief that art is a philosophical means to look at and examine things—to question, test ideas, and engage the world. And that in painting a picture something is being taken apart to put back together; there is an inherent risk in breaking it. And as a Haitian-American immigrant and painter, Robert views the world critically as a contradiction of mass-communication and increased voicelessness.\n\nRobert lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Significant group shows and solo exhibitions include Hannah Hoffman Gallery, Los Angeles (2017); the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Chicago (2020); Hammer Museum, University of California, Los Angeles (2019); Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas (2018); and The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York (2016).\n\nRecent grants, awards, and residencies include the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Artist Grant, New York (2020); MacDowell Colony Fellowship, Peterborough, New Hampshire (2020); Foundation for Contemporary Arts Roy Lichtenstein Award, New York (2019); The Studio Museum Harlem Artist-in-Residence, New York (2016–2017); Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Residency, Skowhegan, Maine (2016); and the Whitney Independent Study Program, New York (2015).\n\nHis work is included in the permanent collection of the Astrup Fearnley Museet, Oslo; Blanton Museum of Art, University of Texas, Austin, Texas; Hammer Museum, University of California, Los Angeles; The Studio Museum of Harlem, New York; and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Chicago.\n\nTom Holmes\n\nTuesday, October 6, 2020\n\nHolmes mounted their first solo museum show Temporary Monument in 2013 at the Kunsthalle Bern. Their work has been included in exhibitions at Palais de Tokyo, Paris; Contemporary Art Biennial, Sélestat, France; Malmö Konstmuseum, Sweden and the Whitney Museum at Altria, New York. Work resides in the public collections of Albright-Knox, FRAC Bourgogne, Stiftung Kunsthalle Bern, and The Frances Young Tang Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College.\n\nWorking within the “problems of abstraction” the artist often takes up a class-conscious cultural criticism through the genre of the funerary as well as processes derived from psychic automatism. Utilizing abstract compositional constructions and modest sculptural materials, such as concrete blocks, folding chairs, and cereal boxes, the works bear witness to the condition of the inevitable. Anne Doran writes, Holmes’s work is “redolent of institutional limbos and marginal lives, with shrill bottom notes of failure and fear.”\n\nGordon Hall\n\nFriday, October 9, 2020\n\nRecording\n\nOrganized in partnership with the departments of English and History of Art & Architecture, as well as the Women and Gender Studies Program, with support from the BU Arts Initiative.\n\nAs a sculptor, performer, and writer, Gordon Hall examines the personal, relational, and political effects of the ways we relate to objects and to each other. Using both abstract forms and re-constructed copies of found objects, the artist asks how we might use such things and how they solicit bodily engagements from us. Ultimately, Hall’s interests lie in the social and political dynamics of these exchanges. The intentional, specific, and enigmatic objects Hall creates are both provocations to performance and allegories for an ethics of relationality. The sculptural objects and the performances that occur with and adjacent to them explore possibilities for an engagement with space, time, and objecthood that seek to model alternative futures.\n\nHall was born in Boston and lives and works in New York. The artist has performed and exhibited at the Renaissance Society, Chicago; the Wysing Arts Centre, London; Temple Contemporary, Philadelphia; The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn; Sculpture Center, Long Island City; and the List Center for the Visual Arts at MIT in Cambridge.\n\nDaniela Rivera\n\nTuesday, October 13, 2020\n\nWebinar Recording (Access Password: W8t6sKe%)\n\nBorn in Santiago, Chile, Daniela Rivera received her BFA from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in 1996 and her MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts, Boston in 2006.
