His experience includes high profile projects for the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Citi's sponsorship of Team USA at the 2012 Olympic Games, and the World Trade Center Redevelopment. Craig executed these projects across all consumer touchpoints. He has spent the last 20 years creating, managing and implementing brands in both Europe and the United States.

Prior to this he lived and worked in Toronto, Canada where he honed his skills as an Art Director under some of the biggest names in Canadian marketing. His work has been recognized by The One Show, Webby Awards, Communication Arts and The Advertising and Design Club of Canada, among many others. His extensive client experience includes brands like: Jeep, Play Station, Levi’s, Rocket Mortgage, and the Elton John Aids Foundation. This work has been covered by media outlets like CNN, Billboard, Business Insider, INC, Automotive News, The Drive and Macaulay Culkin’s Twitter. But what Aaron is most proud of is his time volunteering within the Advertising and Design industry as a student mentor.\n\nMore than anything, Aaron loves crafting stories and experiences that resonate within culture and get results. He also spent his late-teen years traveling the United States as a semi-professional rollerblader, but that is less relevant\n\nFor Battery founding partner/CCO Philip Khosid, advertising is the culmination of his experiences trying to live the biggest life possible. As for those experiences, Toronto-born Philip was planting the seeds of a young Art Director early on, designing flyers and animated visuals for the 90s club scene. The most fortuitous mistake was ignoring his pre-med studies at university, with those carefree days (reckless, some could say) informing Philip’s approach to leading both creative and strategy at Battery.\n\nPreviously, he was the Executive Creative Director of DARE NYC, LA and Toronto, and also led teams at Grey Worldwide and BBDO. Launching Battery in 2014, Philip assembled a team of top creatives from Chiat, Deutsch, Saatchi and 72. Since then, the agency’s work has seen accolades from the big five awards shows, and in 2016, Philip was also named among AdAge’s 40 under 40.\n\nGiven his anti-establishment spirit – part punk, part pirate – paired with his ‘live the biggest life’ philosophy, it’s no surprise that Philip doesn’t consider ‘vice’ a dirty word. As he says, “Exploring a vice means you aren’t blindly consuming; you’re becoming an expert and connoisseur of something with intent. It only turns negative when it becomes over-consumption.”\n\nPhilip’s instinct for reexamining the popular point of view comes through in the work that Battery produces – advertising created for clients and consumers, not for industry peers. (“We’re monopolizing someone's time without their permission. I think we owe it to them to entertain them in one way or another.”) Whether that calls for pyrotechnics and effects, or deafening silence – it always starts with the biggest, purest form of an idea. Then, says Philip, that idea needs to be constantly questioned and pushed against. “Not to shock for shock’s sake, but let’s not sit around with platitudes. I want to get to the morsel of the truth - that’s when advertising becomes an art form.”\n\nIan is a platform-oriented creative leader with a passion for pushing big creative ideas into complex technological ecosystems.
