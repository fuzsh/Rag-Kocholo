        "text": "I hope this screed doesn’t come across as critical. I really enjoyed this article, and am interested in the debate. I read through it initially unsure about the breadth of the literature search, as the keywords were limited. I see in the notes that this has been justified (though I might debate whether the concepts tested were wide enough - and I’m of the opinion that searching for the wider range of narrower terms should be built in to the initial search plan, rather than tested afterwards). I’m pleased to see in the notes a reference to the fact that only peer reviewed literature being included may be a limitation. It is likely (in my experience) that there is a lot discussed on this topic in grey literature (thinking about the membership publications of the two professional organisations I’m a member of, and the conference presentations at these and the many other professional organisations related to professional services roles). I was reading through looking for mention of my profession (librarianship) other than in relation to Research Data Management (thinking that if ‘I’ wasn’t discussed, then there will be areas within other professions that could do with a closer look too) and found this explained ‘ Furthermore, our dataset includes documents that discuss how traditional tasks of librarians, for example literature searches, improved academic output (Ducas and Michaud-Oystryk 2003; e.g. Rethlefsen et al. 2015). As we are interested in PS in the context of shifts in roles and responsibilities, we have decided not to discuss the effects of such contributions and instead focus on their new tasks, such as promoting open access’. I disagree with the idea that open access (and RDM, mentioned elsewhere) are the only areas of librarianship where there are changes in roles and responsibilities. An initial point is that, while all library staff (perhaps especially people in academic liaison such as myself) should have an understanding of open access and RDM, these are distinct and specialist roles. I should think (and know in some cases) there are similar examples of separate roles across many professional services departments or areas in universities. I would refute the idea that literature searching is just a traditional librarian responsibility, without any change. There has been, and continues to be a need for librarians to be integrated into research projects as information specialists, planning, carrying out and reporting on literature searches. I’m thinking about this particularly in relation to my own interest in systematic reviews, but it will probably apply to other areas too. While this has happened quite a bit in some fields (though not comprehensively) in other areas it is an emerging trend. The set up of Evidence Synthesis Services…\n\nToday Studies in Higher Education published a review paper about #professionalstaff of #universities that I wrote with dr. Cay del Junco during my #mariecuriefellowship at University of Chicago. Here is what you can expect when reading 'How do professional staff influence academic knowledge development? A literature review and research agenda' (available for download here: https://lnkd.in/dHEVDEET) Changing relationships between government and the higher education system have created a wide range of new tasks within universities. Many have been adopted by an emerging workforce known alternately as professional, non-academic, or support staff. Its rapid growth has sparked a debate about ‘administrative bloat’. We aim to move beyond this negative, dismissive framing by reviewing the literature to explore whether and how professional staff influence academic knowledge development. While this specific question has received little scholarly attention, we found relevant research in 54 documents from a diffuse group of journals and authors. Our review makes two specific contributions. First, we examine the competencies and relationships of professional staff and their influence on conditions and processes in universities. We find that professional staff increasingly have a private sector background, but that the implications of such a background for competencies remain opaque. Furthermore, their relationships with university leadership and academics as well as actors beyond the home organization place them in strategic positions in their networks. We claim that their involvement in strategy development and implementation, daily management, and academic practices demonstrate a potential to influence knowledge development. Second, we propose a research agenda to understand this influence. The agenda is built around the institutional logics of professional staff, the institutional work that they engage in to promote these logics, and the resulting influence on knowledge development. We hypothesize that professional staff stimulate convergence in knowledge production and strengthen the higher education system’s external legitimacy as a producer of knowledge.\n\nSharing this in support of my almamater, the study of the arts, humanities, social sciences, and society’s inquisitive and critical minds: Apart from the fact Blur met there, Goldsmiths is known for a few things. It’s quite an anarchic, radical place. English students go there for the decolonisation, and students of sociology and art go there for the ecology course. Des Freedman, professor of media and communications (not at risk from the redundancy plans), summarises it more broadly as: “It specialises in the creative and the critical, so you would expect more musicians, more artists, more film-makers, more designers than in less specialist institutions, all of those with a critical perspective.” It has punched above its weight – being a small university of about 8,600 students, with a turnover of £135m versus a university average of £250m – both in terms of reputation and international pull. […] culture wars aren’t being fought to destroy the humanities – rather that humanities are being destroyed because they’re incredibly inconvenient to authoritarianism, representing as they do “a pedagogical practice that calls students beyond themselves, embraces the ethical imperative for them to care for others, embrace historical memory, work to dismantle structures of domination, and to become subjects rather than objects of history, politics, and power”. #highereducation #goldsmiths #culturewars #voiceoftheoppresses #universityfuture"
