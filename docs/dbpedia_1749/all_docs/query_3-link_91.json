        "text": "Hello students interested in FGCU Theatre!\n\nWe hope that you are all safe and sound following the devastation of Hurricane Ian. FGCU has announced that classes and school activities will resume on Monday, October 10. Please keep a look out on your FGCU and Canvas e-mails for notes from your professors and the FGCU administration regarding updates to semester deadlines.\n\nAmong these updated deadlines are those for auditions for Spring 2023 Advanced Acting classes. For priority consideration, submissions should be received by Friday, October 14th @ 5pm.\n\nThe virtual auditions pertain to the following courses:\n\nActing for the Camera (Mondays 10:30am -1:15pm) – VanderMeer\n\nCreating New Theatre (Mondays 1:30pm - 4:15pm) – VanderMeer\n\nActing II (Tuesdays & Thursdays 10:30am-11:45am) – Mellian\n\nThe Actor's Instrument (Wednesdays 1:30pm-4:15pm) – Mellian\n\nVideo auditions can be taped with a cell phone or in-home equipment (Please no performance reels, commercial clips, or professionally edited studio tapes.) Time limit is 60 seconds TOTAL and can include one monologue or two contrasting monologues. Full video guidelines and the online audition form are available via the following link:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/7wMKK1Aq6F8yLUNP9\n\nIf you have questions about a specific class, please reach out to the faculty member(s) noted above.\n\nPlease note that a separate in-person audition will be held for the Spring 2023 production of Antigone. The previously announced Saturday, October 8 audition date has been postponed. Further details on a new date will be forthcoming.\n\nDid you know that you can also earn service learning hours by working on a play or ushering at FGCU!?!\n\nHow can I purchase tickets? Tickets are available online through our ticketing website.\n\nWill my tickets be mailed to me? No. While you will receive a confirmation email after your purchase, tickets will not be mailed, but will be held at the Box Office and will be available one hour prior to the performance.\n\nAre there assigned seats? All of our performances are General Admission, so there are no assigned seats. If, however, you have specific seating needs, please contact Joanna Naumes, Events Coordinator, at jnaumes@fgcu.edu at least 72 hours prior to the performance to work on accomodations.\n\nCan I pick my tickets up in advance? Unfortunately, no. Feel free to print the confirmation email as proof of purchase, but your name will be on a Will Call list at the Box Office one hour prior to the performance.\n\nHow early should I arrive prior to the performance? If you have not purchased tickets in advance, it is recommended that you arrive approximately 1/2 hour prior to the performance to ensure enough time to purchase the tickets and find seats.\n\nAre food and drinks allowed in TheatreLab? Yes, but please note that there are only vending machines in the Arts Complex, so coffee, tea, and other specific snacks would need to be purchased prior to arrival.\n\nIs there late seating? Unfortunately not. Due to the intimate nature of TheatreLab, in conjunction with lighting limitations, we are unable to seat patrons who arrive after the doors have closed. Late arrivals are more than welcome to wait until intermission, if there is one, so they can see the second part of the performance.\n\nSomething came up and I can no longer attend the performance. Can I get a refund? Unfortunately, we have a no exchange and no refund policy. Only our season subscribers have the ability to change performances. If you would like more information on becoming a subscriber, please contact Joanna Naumes, Events Coordinator, at jnaumes@fgcu.edu."
