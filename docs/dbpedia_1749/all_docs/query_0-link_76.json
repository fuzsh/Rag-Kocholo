        "text": "New Book\n\nAmy Wong, lecturer for the Department of Sociology, published a new book, Stories of Survival: The Paradox of Suicide Vulnerability and Resiliency among Asian American College Students. The book explores the paradox of suicide vulnerability and resiliency among Asian American college students. It uses a strength-based approach to understand how Asian American college students live with their suicidal tendencies and offers practical recommendations for colleges and universities to address the mental health challenges of their students.\n\nCongratulations Amy!\n\nPirates of the Contact Zone: Or, How to Hijack Capitalism through Skateboarding South to the U.S.-Mexico Border\n\nFeaturing Andrea Buchetti\n\nRoots of the Revolts: Segregation, Serial Displacement, and Gentrification in St. Louis, Baltimore, and Beyond\n\nFeaturing Derek Hyra, Ph.D.\n\nThursday, April 6, 2023 | 12-1 p.m.\n\nConrad Prebys Aztec Student Union Legacy Suite Room 372\n\nBy investigating the legacy of serial displacement in the St. Louis region and Baltimore, this presentation argues certain urban housing and community development policies over time perpetuate segregation, poverty concentration, and gentrification that create a contemporary context for aggressive policing, Black frustrations, and unrest.\n\nDerek Hyra is a professor in the Department of Public Administration and Policy within the School of Public Affairs at American University. His research focuses on processes of neighborhood change, with an emphasis on housing, urban politics, and race.\n\nCo-sponsored with the School of Public Affairs.\n\nFeeling Politics: The Role of Emotions in Environmental Racism Fights\n\nFeaturing Nadia Kim, Ph.D.\n\nWednesday, March 22, 2023 | 2 3:30 p.m.\n\nFinch Conference Room, AL 660\n\nThis talk draws on Nadia Kim's book \"Refusing Death\" to explore how we must grasp environmental injustice, as well as other forms of injustice, through a lens of physical and emotional violence and neglect. More specifically, Kim addresses how we best understand this systemic injustice by examining how communities of color receive it and fight back.\n\nNadia Y. Kim is Professor of Asian & Asian American Studies and affiliated faculty in Sociology at Loyola Marymount University. Her research focuses on US race and citizenship injustices and on fights against environmental racism/classism.\n\nCo-sponsored with the Center for Asian and Pacific Studies, Sustainability, Chicana and Chicano Studies, Women's Studies, and Asian American Studies.\n\nFaculty Research Hour featured\n\n“Stories of Survival: The Paradox of Suicide Vulnerability and Resiliancy among Asian American College Students” - Amy Wong\n\n“Mexican Railroad Workers and Social Change” - Michael Calderon-Zaks\n\n“Roll and Flow: The Cultural Politics of Skateboarding and Surfing” - Michael Roberts\n\nSociology Research Hour: Mexican Railroad Workers and Social Change\n\nwith Michael Calderon-Zaks, Ph.D.\n\nFriday, March 17, 2023 | 2-3 p.m.\n\nNH 229\n\nThis talk focuses on my research on Mexican railroad workers in the US through different social changes during the 20th century. Mexicans made up ninety percent of southwestern US track crews from around 1920 to the 1950s. The track crews were the most radicalized divisions of labor in each region, making this study an ideal intersection between race and class. This talk covers the phase in which Mexicans succeeded Chinese and Japanese workers on the tracks by the 1920s, two attempted organizing campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s, and how technological changes eliminated most of the jobs on the railroad right of ways. This talk also offers lessons in light of recent events on the railroads.\n\nThe Makers Assemble: The Volunteer Phenomenon of PPE Makers\n\nThursday, Sept. 29, 2022 | 7 p.m. | Scripps Cottage\n\nFlattening the Curve During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the U. S.\n\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic surfaced with great force, revealing that the national supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) was dangerously underwhelming. Hospitals and clinics, nursing homes and assisted living centers, funeral home workers, essential workers, first responders, and schools at all levels were requesting immediately that someone (anyone who could) step up to make desperately-needed PPE (face masks, hospital gowns, hospital caps, ear savers, and face shields). Volunteer quilters, sewists and 3D printer enthusiasts emerged in a groundswell of life-saving gendered disaster response, creating PPE for those in need.\n\nMarybeth C. Stalp, University of Northern Iowa, Kimberly Kelly and Braden Leap, Mississippi State University collected data from 740 makers through qualitative phone interviews and an online qualitative questionnaire from July 2020 to January 2021. They consider makers broadly, and include makers to be people with sewing and 3D printing skills, those who cut fabric and elastic and assembled mask kits for sewists to pick up, sew, and drop off for distribution, 3D printing groups that cut and printed face shield parts and ear savers and distributed them in person or mailed them across the country to those in need.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to highlight and understand the groundswell of volunteer work accomplished by makers: quilters, sewists, and 3D printing enthusiasts. The authors focus on how makers, and in particular quilters and sewists, generously devoted time money and attention to flattening the curve and caring for their communities.\n\nCommencement 2022\n\nThe Department of Sociology organized a celebration for Sociology graduating seniors on May 13, 2022 in Tula Community Center. We recognized the Outstanding Graduating Senior, Amaya Childes and her Most Influential Faculty Member, Professor and Chair, Minjeong Kim. Students, parents, faculty and staff were also in attendance to celebrate this momentous occasion. We are truly proud of all our graduates and their accomplishments!\n\nNew Directions in Research on Immigration and Crime\n\nTuesday, May 3 | 2 p.m. | Conrad Prebys Aztec Student Union, Pride Suite\n\nDo immigrants commit more crime than non-immigrants? Do increases in immigration cause crime rates to rise in communities?\n\nThese questions are at the forefront of discussions about crime and public safety in the United States. Public opinion data suggest many residents believe the answer to these questions is an unqualified “yes” but does scientific research agree? In this talk, Charis Kubrin reviews what we know about the immigration-crime link — highlighting opportunities and pitfalls from her own research journey — and discusses new directions in research.\n\nCharis E. Kubrin is professor of criminology, law and society and (by courtesy) sociology at University of California, Irvine. Her research focuses on neighborhood correlates of crime, with an emphasis on race and violent crime. Recent work examines the immigration-crime nexus, as well as assesses the impact of criminal justice reform on crime rates. In addition to her work in peer-reviewed journals, Professor Kubrin is co-author of “Researching Theories of Crime and Deviance “(Oxford University Press 2008) and “Privileged Places: Race, Residence, and the Structure of Opportunity” (Lynne Rienner, 2006) and co editor of “Introduction to Criminal Justice: A Sociological Perspective” (Stanford University Press 2013) and “Punishing Immigrants: Policy, Politics, and Injustice” (New York University Press 2012).\n\nProfessor Kubrin has received national awards for her scholarly contributions to the field including the Ruth Shonle Cavan Young Scholar Award from the American Society of Criminology (for outstanding scholarly contributions to the discipline of criminology) and the W.E.B. DuBois Award from the Western Society of Criminology (for significant contributions to racial and ethnic issues in the field of criminology). In 2019, she was named a Fellow of the American Society of Criminology.\n\nSponsored by instructionally related activities funds.\n\nWorker's Rights in Action!\n\nWednesaday, December 8, 2021 | 5 pm\n\nStorm Hall 109\n\nCome learn about your labor rights as a San Diego worker!

Because of the restrictions in gatherings due to the global pandemic, the Department honored them with a surprise vehicle parade. The Department cannot express how much we appreciate the work that three lecturers did for us over many years. Their retirement will be a monumental loss for the Department, but we wish them only the very best.\n\nCommencement 2020\n\nIn lieu of in-person commencement due to the COVID 19 pandemic, the Department organized a virtual celebration for Sociology graduating seniors on May 15, 2020. In addition to acknowledging all graduating seniors who attended the celebration, four retiring faculty members, Professors Dae Elliot, Nancy Federman, Tom Semm, and Norma Ojeda gave congratulatory remarks.

Published as part of the Mobilization-Routledge Series on Social Movements and Protest, this volume brings together new research on nonviolent tactics of social change. Highlighting numerous anti-state challenges from around the world and theoretical/methodological issues of studying them, this collection explores the overlaps between two research concentrations: the field of social movement studies and the academic focus on nonviolent strategies of change. The book is the fruit of the first Hansen-SDSU conference on nonviolent resistance and social change in 2016. Congratulations, Hank.\n\nCommencement 2019\n\nCongratulations to the graduates of 2019!

The article profiles his research on the hypothesis that new mass transit options lead to gentrification. Gibbons and his colleague, Dr. Michael S. Barton at Louisiana State University, examined data from New York City, and compared changes in median income in relation to changes the transit system. They found initially that income levels did tend to rise when mass transit options increased. Upon further analysis, when other demographic factors were added, they found that the correlation between income and mass transit virtually disappeared; leading them to conclude that other demographic factors were just as important in the changes to income, as transit options.\n\nMobilization Turns Twenty\n\nMobilization is the leading journal of research in collective action, social movements, and contentious politics. The field’s leading researchers and theorists choose to publish in it. The quarterly journal was founded in the Department of Sociology is in 1996 by Professor Hank Johnston, and has been published continuously in the department since then. Its stature as one of the top journals in American sociology was established in its early years, thanks to a distinguished editorial board and the cutting-edge articles—widely cited to this day—from the field’s top scholars. It is fair to say the Mobilization has been a force guiding the field of social movement research to its full maturity over the last twenty years. This year Mobilization celebrates its twentieth anniversary. At its founding, Mobilization’s goal was to advance the systematic, scholarly, and scientific study of protests, strikes, riots, insurgencies, revolutions, and other forms of collective action, and to provide a forum for the discussion of methodologies, theories, and conceptual approaches across the disciplines of sociology and political science. In recognition of the interconnectedness of the global community of researchers in the field, of the globalization of social movement activism, and of the need for crossnational comparisons for theoretical advance, Mobilization was, at it inception, promoted as an international journal. One third of its subscribers today are scholars outside the United States, mostly from Canada and Western Europe, but also from as far as China, New Delhi, Bangkok, Malta, Crete, Turkey, and Qatar. The world’s top research universities make it available to their faculties and students: Cambridge, Oxford, Sciences Po, École normale supérieure, Université de Paris, Colégio de Mexico, Peking University, Tokyo University, Hong Kong, Leipzig, Milan, Rome, and so on. Mobilization at SDSU provides rich opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students looking forward to PhDs to experience first hand the process of scholarly writing and publication. It continues to be a source of global prestige for the department of sociology.\n\nWage Theft, Time Theft, and Discrimination in San Diego County Restaurant Jobs\n\nDr. Jill Esbenshade's report on wage theft and San Diego County Restaurant Workers is released.
