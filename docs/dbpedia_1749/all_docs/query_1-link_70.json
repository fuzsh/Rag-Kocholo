        "meta_description": "Our life with art is suffused with trust. We don’t just trust one another’s aesthetic testimony; we trust one another’s aesthetic actions. Audiences trust artists to have made it worth their while; artists trust audiences to put in the effort. Without trust, audiences would have little reason to put in the effort to understand difficult and unfamiliar art. I offer a theory of aesthetic trust, which highlights the importance of trust in aesthetic sincerity. We trust in another’s aesthetic sincerity when we rely on them to fulfill their commitments to act for aesthetic reasons—rather than for, say, financial, social, or political reasons. We feel most thoroughly betrayed by an artist, not when they make bad art, but when they sell out. This teaches us something about the nature of trust in general. According to many standard theories, trust involves taking the trusted to be cooperative or good-natured. But trust in aesthetic sincerity is different. We trust artists to be true to their own aesthetic sensibility, which might involve selfishly ignoring their audience’s needs. Why do we care so much about an artist’s sincerity, rather than merely trusting them to make good art? We emphasize sincerity when wish to encourage originality, rather than demanding success along predictable lines. And we ask for sincerity when our goal is to discover a shared sensibility. In moral life, we often try to force convergence through coordinated effort. But in aesthetic life, we often hope for the lovely discovery that our sensibilities were similar all along. And for that we need to ask for sincerity, rather than overt coordination.Click here to download audio version of this article.",

        "text": "HERE are some feelings I have about Kanye West’s music and its reception. Through Life of Pablo, his albums grew more difficult and more alienating. After some time and effort, however, I came to find each one deeply rewarding. But as his work became harsher and more structurally bewildering, each album took me longer to come to terms with. I pressed on through those early difficult listens because, by that point, I had come to trust in West as a musical artist.\n\nOther people tuned out as West’s work evolved. They had deeply loved his earlier work, but were unwilling to invest energy in the attempt to come to terms with his later work. I have feelings about them, too: I think they are doing something ever-so-slightly wrong. It’s not just that they are missing out on a bit of extra pleasure. It’s that they are failing to offer West the kind of trust that he deserves, given their prior relationship to his work. And then there are people who never gave West’s music a chance. Some of these people are my friends and fellow appreciators, with whom I have a long history of listening together and appreciating things together—a history of shared sensibility. When such aesthetic compatriots refuse to even try to listen with an open mind despite my gushing—and despite massed critical consensus1—I feel that they are failing to trust when they should.\n\nAnd we can feel betrayed towards artists, too. The consensus among fans and critics seems to be that West’s most recent album ye was tossed off without much real effort. Longtime West listeners felt deeply let down by the album and by the artist behind it, if the online outpouring was any judge. Music critic Meaghen Geavey writes:\n\nWe have reached the point where West’s once-constant churn of ideas— usually inspired, regularly awkward, but always like nothing else out there—is barely meeting the standard of “Lift Yourself,” the desperate troll banger that preceded ye, corralling every meaning of the word “scat.” The problem with ye is not that it was made by an unrepentant asshole, but that it is thoroughly, exhaustingly boring—a word I never imagined would apply to a generation’s most reliable innovator… . ye feels rickety, almost, as if removing a bassline would send the whole thing toppling… . It’s as if he’d completely forgotten the music was the reason we loved him in the first place… . [In “Ghost Town”] He gargles a few half-finished thoughts, his tone not so much sad as dazed, re-using the verse melody from “Runaway” over a sample chop that, at one point, sounds a whole lot like his work with Jay-Z… . It’s an ode to total numbness, and somehow it’s also ye’s emotional climax, an irony as apt as it is depressing.2\n\nWhat unites these various responses is the presence of trust and its kin. Richard Holton notes that there are characteristic normatively-laden attitudes which surround trust:\n\nWhen you trust someone to do something, you rely on them to do it, and you regard that reliance in a certain way; you have a readiness to feel betrayal should it be disappointed, and gratitude should it be upheld. (Holton 1994: 67)\n\nAnd, in aesthetic life, we are not simply surprised when an artist lets us down; we can feel betrayed. When somebody mistrusts our recommendations when we think we have earned their trust, we are hurt. When I discover some hidden perfect subtlety, buried deep in the innards of some labyrinthine novel, I feel gratitude that the author had trusted their audience enough to place it there.\n\nBut the role of trust in art—in our relationships to artists, audiences, critics, and fellow appreciators—has been relatively under-explored, at least in philosophical aesthetics. Philosophers of art have focused their attentions on one very specific kind of trust: the sort involved in the acquisition of aesthetic knowledge via testimony. They have debated, at great length, whether and why there is really a problem with acquiring aesthetic judgment strictly through testimony.3 But there are many other kinds of aesthetic trust. Artists create subtle, complex works, trusting their audiences to discover those works’ more esoteric qualities. Audiences invest their time and energy in those works, trusting artists to have created with dedication and sincerity. Museum-goers trust curators to choose aesthetically profound works and not just aim to maximize ticket sales. Actors trust their directors; classical musicians trust their conductors. Painters trust manufacturers to be meticulous in making pigments and paper. Readers trust critics to get at the heart of an artwork, instead of just saying clever stuff to advance their careers.\n\nIn this paper, I explore the central role of trust in our lives with art. I will start by considering one particular role for trust. Trust makes it possible for us to aesthetically change and grow, by giving us reasons to approach new and unfamiliar art. Without trust, audiences would have little reason to put in the effort to understand inherently difficult art, and artists would have little reason to hope that audiences would rise to the challenge.\n\nThere are, I claim, many forms of trust in aesthetic life, including trust in each other’s aesthetic competence and in each other’s steadfastness to a style or a sensibility. But I will highlight a form of trust that seems especially characteristic of much contemporary aesthetic life: trust in aesthetic sincerity. In much current aesthetic practice, we typically trust one another to act from aesthetic considerations, rather than financial, social, or other non-aesthetic considerations. Suppose an artist makes a wild stylistic shift—a bold artistic experiment, following their own aesthetic sensibility—and it turns out terribly. They have failed to make good art, but they have succeeded in being aesthetically sincere. And our greatest ire is often directed, not at the artist that makes bad art, but at the insincere artist—the sellout.\n\nMy goals here are two-fold. First, I hope to show that our understanding of our art practices will benefit from thinking carefully about aesthetic trust. Second, I hope to expand our understanding of trust in general. Much of the recent discussion of the normative dimension of trust emerges from analyses of moral scenarios. But there is more to life than morality.4 Thinking about aesthetic life will help deepen our understanding of the varied forms of trust. Trust in aesthetic sincerity, it turns out, has a special character—one that is quite distinctive from the way we trust in the moral and epistemic spheres. I suggest that this is because of our distinctive goals in aesthetic life. We ask for sincerity, rather than kindliness, cooperativeness, or reliability, because we are trying to nurture creativity and originality, and because we are hoping to encourage a very particular form of shared experience.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI’d like to thank, for all their wise and kind assistance, Anthony Cross, Adrian Currie, John Dyck, Jonathan Gingerich, Keren Gorodeisky, Samantha Matherne, Aaron Meskin, Erich Matthes, Nick Riggle, and the editors and referees of Ergo.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nAnnas, Julia (2008).
