Spanning 70 years with a focus on American and Asian cinema, this 25-film series explores various themes and sub-genres, shining a light on the women who paved the way for today’s actions stars, including the incomparable Michelle Yeoh in two Oscar-winning films — Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Everything Everywhere All at Once — and the buddy-cop Hong Kong action-comedy, Yes, Madam!, and Meiko Kaji in Japan’s 1973 Lady Snowblood, a samurai and manga-inspired cult classic which greatly influenced Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill: Volume 1 and Kill Bill: Volume 2. Women in Action runs from June 7 to July 31. Tickets will be available to Members on Wednesday, May 15 at 10am, and to the public on Friday, May 17 at 10am. Select second screenings will be scheduled throughout July and will go on sale to Members on June 12, and to the public on June 14.\n\nIn advance of its premiere on Crave on Sunday, April 14, TIFF and Crave are thrilled to present the Canadian premiere of HBO’s The Sympathizer and to welcome Don McKellar, the series’ co-showrunner and executive producer, along with producer Niv Fichman, for an onstage conversation following the screening of the first episode.\n\nCheck out Midnight Madness Presents Fulltime Killer in 35mm, starring Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau; and MDFF Selects’ Canadian Premiere of Lucy Kerr’s Family Portrait, which follows a sprawling family on a morning when they have planned a group picture. The filmmaker, along with actor Deragh Campbell (Anne at 13,000 Ft), will join MDFF Selects co-founder and curator Kazik Radwanski for a post-screening Q&A.\n\nAudiences can also catch a 50th anniversary screening of Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather: Part II; Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia in 35mm; a new 4K restoration of Charlie Chaplin’s A Woman of Paris, also screening for free to those 65+ with guest programmer Alicia Fletcher as part of Silver Screenings; and the last Secret Movie Club presentation of the season.\n\nSkills for Change, in collaboration with TIFF Community Impact, is pleased to present New Horizons: Diverse Voices of Canada.

Aligned with the Nouveau roman movement, her works fearlessly confront colonialism and broach taboo topics like incest and interracial desire, sparking controversy in their time. While she made 19 films, her cinema remains largely unknown and under-appreciated. This substantial retrospective aims to introduce her formally innovative and sensual films to a new audience — doing so at a time when her writings on cinema are newly available in English.
