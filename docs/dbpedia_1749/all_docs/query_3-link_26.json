        "text": "Outer Worlds is an extra-ordinary film program that features five, experimental IMAX films by Canada’s leading artists: Oliver Husain, Lisa Jackson, Kelly Richardson, Michael Snow, and Leila Sujir. The theme of the commissioned program is in keeping with the cinematic genre typical of IMAX films—the larger-than-life landscape that forms an outer world beyond the limits of the human sensorium.\n\nEach of the films explores expanded cinema through different ecologies of the non-human: the forest, lichen, snails, water, and sky. The works propose different worlds of experience and distinct grammars of immersion through a meeting with the camera. The films imagine common worlds by reflecting upon the exigencies of intercultural and interspecies communication, a task that has taken on great urgency in the 21st century as we grapple with how to adapt to the ecological realities brought about by anthropogenic climate change.\n\nJanine Marchessault is Professor in Cinema and Media Arts at York University, and holds a York Research Chair in Media Art and Social Engagement. Her research engages with the history of large screen media (from multiscreen to Imax to media as architecture and VR). She belongs to the CinemaExpo67.ca research group. Her latest project is an expanded cinema project, Outer Worlds (outerworlds.org) – commissioning five IMAX films by artists, which premiered at the Cinesphere in 2019 and will begin touring soon.\n\nShe is the Director of Archive/Counter-Archive: Activating Canada’s Moving Image Heritage (2018–2024), a research collaboration involving more than 20 community and artist-run archives devoted to diverse histories from Indigenous, LGBTQ2+, immigrant, and women’s communities. Her most recent monograph is Ecstatic Worlds: Media, Ecologies, Utopias (MIT, 2017) and co-edited collection Process Cinema: Handmade film in the Digital Age (MQUP, 2019).\n\nLeila Sujir is an artist working in video and video installation. Over the last forty years, Sujir has been building a body of video art works using a mix of fiction, fantasy and documentary with visual and audio collage techniques. Her video art works have been shown in group shows at the Museum of Modern Art (New York) and the Tate Gallery (Liverpool), as well as galleries all over the world. Her work is in collections including the National Gallery of Canada and the Glenbow Museum. Leila Sujir is a professor emerita in the Studio Arts Department at Concordia University. She leads an art research studio-lab based at Concordia University, Elastic 3D Spaces, that most recently received a SSHRC grant, Thinking Allowed (2022), and a Canada Council production grant (2022).\n\nOliver Husain is an artist and filmmaker. His projects are often collaborations with other artists and friends; and often begin with a fragment of history, a rumour, a personal encounter or a distant memory. He uses a wide range of cinematic languages, technical experiments and visual pleasures — such as dance, puppetry, costume, special effects — to animate his research and fold the viewers into complex narrative set-ups. Recent exhibitions include Beauties of Lucknow, a site-specific installation commissioned by Massey College, Toronto; Lenticoolers at Gallery Susan Hobbs, Toronto (with Malik McCoy); I don’t know you like that at University of Buffalo Art Galleries and Exposure at Camera Austria, Graz (both with Kerstin Schroedinger); all 2023. His website is husain.de; his livestream performances (with Amy Lam) are available on drip-drop.tv\n\nMani Mazinani was born in Tehran in 1984, he lives and works in Toronto. Mazinani’s interdisciplinary practice includes installation, video, film, sculpture, photography, multiples, sound, and music. He makes work that connects scale and perception, improvisation and ancient thought. Recent exhibitions and performances include Monitor 15 (SAVAC, 2023), Stories and Storefronts, Toronto (2022); Tate Modern, London (2019, with Michael Snow); The Bentway, Toronto (2018); Tehran International Electronic Music Festival (2017); Suzhou Industrial Park Culture and Arts Centre (2016); Asian Art Museum, San Francisco (2015); and CAB Art Centre, Brussels (2013).\n\nPlease join SNID on February 1st, at 1:00 p.m. for an in-person presentation with Dr. Karen Dubinsky, Dr. Susan Lord and Diron Luis Morejon Pérez.\n\nAt Queen's University, Mackintosh-Corry Hall, room D 214.\n\nTeaching Cuba: Lessons Learned\n\nQueen’s has had a longstanding exchange program with the U of Havana. Between 2008 and 2023, hundreds of Queen’s students studied in Havana through the interdisciplinary Global Development Studies course “Cuban Culture and Society.” Two Canadian instructors and a former U of Havana student, all participants in the course, reflect on experiential learning, Global South education for Canadians, the Cuba we entered and the Cuba we left.\n\n4Serina is an exploration Serina Timperio's art, art legacy, and brain cancer journey. It is also a fundraiser for \"Serina's Ride for Research\".\n\nGive to Queen's - Serina Timperio's Ride for Research (givetoqueens.ca)\n\nhttps://www.givetoqueens.ca/project/view/1364\n\nThere will be a reception and artist talk held on Friday 24 Nov from 4pm to 7pm. Light refreshments provided.\n\nThe exhibition will feature works by Serina Timperio, and collaborations with Cam Miller.\n\nThe exhibit is open from 21 Nov to 1 Dec, 10am to 4pm, Monday to Friday at the IBCPA, Art and Media Lab\n\n390 King St West, Kingston ON\n\n#4Serina, #braincancer, #kingstonlocal, #artshow, #ygkarts\n\nUnearthed is a walk in the park with a twist.\n\nJoin us August 26-30 2023 for a week-long series of artistic experiments, conversations, and performances.\n\nBringing diverse perspectives to converse with the history of Belle Park and pressing contemporary social and environmental concerns, artists Cheryl L'Hirondelle, Vince Ha, Noah Scheinman, Elyse Longair and Evalyn Parry will activate spaces in the park on various days throughout the week through music, performance, and temporary installations.\n\nAn exhibition at Art and Media Lab in the Isabel Bader Centre will be running concurrently showing work by Jung-Ah Kim, Elyse Longair, and Vince Ha. Together, the work in the park and the gallery seeks to further conversation about this rich space with an uncertain future.\n\nVisit https://belleparkproject.com/events/unearthed for details\n\n\"At the core of this project is a personal exploration of the intergenerational trauma of the survivors of the communist regime in former Czechoslovakia -- the land in which I grew up and began my artistic journey. In both the film and the installations, the repeating imagery of the hands and clay points to the struggle for free expression, censorship, and oppression under this regime. The film, which is the focal point of the exhibition, is layered with symbolism. The tactile gestures, materials, expressions, and malleability of the clay underlines the deep relationship between the hand and the art medium. The film's narrative relays the dynamics of control as the two main characters engage in a dance of power, a dance which, depending on one's perspective, does or does not resolve.\n\nThe participants are invited to sculpt clay at the table with the artist, offering another point of entry in understanding the work through direct engagement.\"\n\nAugust 8 - 11\n\nTuesday & Wednesday 10 - 4\n\nThurs & Friday 10 - 2\n\nCompuTerra: A Xenofeminist Utopia by Emilie Surette\n\nAug 1-4\n\nArt & Media Lab\n\nIsabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts\n\nWelcome to the world of CompuTerra, a future where plants have evolved into machines. This multimedia exhibition explores the feminist and ecological utility of utopianism for a world exhausted by climate crisis fatigue. In this utopia, nature and machines are blurred, creating a jointly composed reality where the plants become not only machines but computer components. In remaking nature, we look to alternative ways of existing in both the technological or virtual, and the ‘natural’ world; as well as finding new ways to engage with the environment and each other.\n\nPANKO by Sierrah Zawacki\n\nIsabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts\n\nJuly 25-28\n\n10-4\n\nArtist Talk on July 26th\n\nMemory Junction Museum\n\nby William Jennings\n\nMemory is fast; film is slow. Lost futures and distant pasts collapse into a dyschronic state of time wounded both forwards and back. What room left is there for ghosts in the digital age? It is the burden of present consciousness to filter the oppressive weight of the past.\n\nIsabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts - Art and Media Lab\n\nJuly 21 10-3\n\nSave the date!\n\nVIEW FINDER - THE FILM 460 2023-24 SHOWCASE\n\n12-13 APRIL / 10AM – 4PM\n\nGet ready for almost 10h of short movies, a screenplay presentation session, and dozens of installations that will be on display in the Arts and Media Lab (AML) and all over the Isabel!\n\nMarch 27-31 Art & Media Lab\n\nThe Curating Media Practice students have prepared an exhibition of potential exhibitions!

Opening hours: daily from 10am to 4pm.\n\nFILM 356 Presents Laura Harrison via ZOOM\n\nMarch 2, 3:30 - 5:30pm\n\nLAURA HARRISON lives and works in Chicago. Her animations focus on marginalized, social outcasts with their own sub cultures. These fringe characters provide a focal point for her concerns with diaspora, trans humanism, gender and the loss of touch in an overwhelmingly visual world. Her films have shown at various festivals internationally including The New York Film Festival, Ottawa International Animation Festival, Animafest Zagreb, LA Film Festival, The Chicago Underground Film Festival, Kerry Film Festival, Japan Media Arts Festival, Boston International Film Festival, Florida Film Festival, GLAS, Melbourne International Animation Festival and many others.\n\nThursday, Feb. 16 @ 11:45\n\nKCFF March 2-5\n\nFor Tickets: https://kingcanfilmfest.com/tickets/\n\nFebruary 1st at 5:30 The Screening Room\n\nDowntown, 126 Princess Street\n\nFREE - RSVP: https://forms.gle/H2HUwQnJJDoML4jJ6\n\nSCCS Screening Series is pleased to present John Greyson’s newest feature film, Photobooth, with the attendance of the director for a Q&A.\n\nPhotobooth is an agitprop opera odyssey featuring the ghost of Jean Genet, Toronto’s gay penguins, and the activist work of queer folk fighting for Palestinian liberation. Using fragmented formal and narrative structures, Grayson weaves a mindbending tapestry of ideas, histories, emotions and potentials.\n\nJohn Greyson is Canadian director, activist, and artist. His work has been screened locally and internationally. His recent short, International Dawn Chorus Day received the Golden Bear for Best Short Film at the Berlinale in 2021. John teaches film at York University in Toronto.\n\nThis event is hosted by Queen’s University’s Department of Film and Media with the support of the Brockington Visitorship.\n\nJoin us for two artist talks on Friday, January 20, 2023, at 11:30-1:00 pm with Beth Frey and Dan Tapper in Room 222.\n\nBeth Frey works with a variety of media, including drawing, painting, video, sculpture and installation. Through her wry, absurdist sense of humour, Frey playfully draws out contradictions in her subject matter, be it gender, the body, social media, or mental health, often integrating representations of herself into her chromatic cartoon-like world. Working from her complexly layered watercolours, Frey incorporates accessible smartphone apps and AI image generation tools to expand this universe and bring her body into it as an active player. Her popular Instagram project, sentientmuppetfactory, uses AI to comically deform bodies and poke fun classic film tropes. Frey has an MFA in Painting and Drawing from Concordia University and a BFA from the University of Victoria. She has exhibited her work in a number of solo and group shows across Canada, Mexico and the US. Frey currently divides her time between Montreal and Mexico City.\n\nhttp://www.bethfrey.com\n\nSocial media links: IG: @bethisms and @sentientmuppetfactory.\n\nDan Tapper is an artist and creative technologist interested in the intersection between information and experience. His current projects include building sonic VR environments and using machine learning to create new forms of divination.\n\nwww.instagram.com/visualcodepoetry\n\nhttps://www.dantappersounddesign.com/\n\nJan 30: Curating in a transhistorical perspective (12pm EST)\n\nA conversation with Raphael Fonseca\n\nhttps://queensu.zoom.us/j/96219247493?pwd=WlV4K3pIRFRvTk5SVURmcFA2aCtvZz09\n\nRaphael Fonseca is a researcher in curating, art history, art criticism, and education. He works as a curator of modern and contemporary Latin American art at the Denver Art Museum. The juxtaposition of different temporalities and how it can bring contemporary reflections to the audience has a significant role in his practice. In this talk, Raphael will discuss some of his curatorial projects engaged in a transhistorical approach to art and images. How can images from different historical moments dialogue in the same exhibition space? How do they create contemporary echoes? What are some tensions between the idea of art and visual culture?\n\nJan 31: Rituals of Complexity (4pm EST)\n\nhttps://queensu.zoom.us/j/97763427578?pwd=Ym9zZWFLT1JiNVpGWmw4c2tuaUNvdz09\n\nA conversation with Fernando Velázquez\n\nFernando Velázquez is an artist, curator and professor. He explores how technical devices mediate perception, with particular interest in the structures, dynamics, and narratives that give rise current paradigms such as technosolutionism and the anthropobscene. He is interested in emergent and generative creative processes and transdisciplinary methodologies. In this talk, Velázquez will be discussing how his work – which includes installations, objects, videos, audiovisual performances and images generated with algorithmic systems –involve the viewer in a labyrinth of hyperbolic, interactive and ritualistic narratives.\n\nPhoto Booth Screening and Talk with John Greyson\n\nWednesday February 1, 2023\n\n5:30 pm - 8:00 pm\n\nLocation\n\nThe Screening Room 120 Princess Street\n\nFeb. 1 @ 5:30PM\n\nThe Screening Room\n\n120 Princess Street\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/712207091/4130afff9e\n\nVML - Activating Cultural Archives for Marginalized Communities\n\nFilm & Media Faculty Screenings: Gary Kibbins\n\nGary Kibbins, 2 new works\n\nIsabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts, room 222\n\nThursday, Dec. 8, 7PM\n\nP&Not-P Learn Non-Euclidean Geometry\n\nPedagogy for primates; a comedy.\n\nThe Way to Almsoma\n\nA haunted story, part dreamscape, part travel guide.\n\nWith Neven Lochhead, respondent.\n\nThe Crossing and Other Tales, Shimon Attie's Immersive Media Installations\n\nOctober 25th - 30th, 2022 (Tuesday - Sunday, 10am - 4pm)\n\nArt & Media Lab, Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts\n\nOpening Reception: October 28th, 4pm - 6pm, Art & Media Lab\n\nThe Crossing and Other Tales features two of Shimon Attie’s immersive single-channel video installations, a multidisciplinary artist who creates site-specific installations in public places, as well as mixed media installations for museums and galleries. Highlighting the survival stories of refugees who have suffered trauma and violence, his installations give visual form to invisible, forgotten, or erased histories and/or communities.\n\nConcerned with questions of memory, place, and identity, Attie employs video, photography, sculpture, and highly collaborative processes with local communities to realize his projects. His work re-imagines new relationships between space, time, place, and identity, and explores how contemporary art practice can inflect and re-interpret social and political history, personal and communal identity, and more broadly, human memory and the imagination.\n\nAttie’s work has been shown at and collected by The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, among many others. He has received fellowships from the John S. Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the American Academy in Rome, The National Endowment for the Arts, The Pollock-Krasner Foundation and The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. He has also received the Lee Krasner Award and was inducted into the National Academy of Design in 2018.\n\nIf you have any questions or require assistance, please contact: Jung-Ah Kim, jungahkim1206@gmail.com / 847.507.6780\n\nCreating Independent Cinema in Canada: A Conversation with Carol Nguyen\n\nCarol is one of Canada's top emerging filmmakers.

Now their progress seems due, rather, to the LGBTI activism of many of its inhabitants.\n\nSexilio (2022, in progress, 60 min, USA-Cuba, Span. and Eng. with Eng. subtitles )\n\nIn 1980, thousands of queer Cubans were expelled from their country during the Mariel boatlift. On the other side of the sea, the possible freedom was also vexed by racism, homophobia, resettlement issues, and the AIDS epidemic. Making a film becomes later a pretext for another queer immigrant to create an archive of those experiences, and to question the unbearable traumas of being in sexile.\n\nHere’s a link to his website. https://www.lazarogonzalezfilms.com/\n\nMedia distribution practices: gatekeeping and access\n\nA talk by Dr. Virginia Crisp\n\nFri Nov 4, 1.00PM – Isabel Bader Centre, Room 222\n\nDr Crisp will provide a brief introduction to her main academic passions, researching media distribution and co-chairing the international research network, Besides the Screen. In doing so, she will discuss her longstanding interesting in exploring the intersections and overlaps between formal and informal media distribution as well as discussing her more recent conceptual framing of in/formal distribution activities as a form of ‘gatekeeping’. She will also discuss the history and upcoming activities of the Besides the Screen Network and its continuing aim to push the boundaries of screen studies into ever more trans/multi/inter disciplinary, multi-practice and inter-industry activities.\n\nDr Virginia Crisp is Reader in Media Industries and Cultures at King’s College, London. Virginia’s research spans three interconnected areas: distribution studies, championing multi/trans/interdisciplinary research, and media industry studies. Her first monograph, Film Distribution in the Digital Age (2015) provided a sustained critical examination of the symbiotic relationship between both formal (industry-led) media distribution and informal circulation (piracy). She is currently in the process of writing a book on media piracy with Paul McDonald, due to be published with Polity in 2024. Virginia is the co-founder (with Dr Gabriel Menotti) of the Besides the Screen Network, a network that brings together academics, filmmakers, artists and industry professionals from across the globe to consider the transformation of audiovisual media practices. Virginia is currently the Deputy Head of the Department of Culture, Media and Creative Industries at King’s College, London, which is a vibrant, research-led department that approaches a new subject area with traditional academic rigour.\n\nTheo Anthony Screening and Events\n\nDAY 0 Monday Nov 7: Informal Dinner TBD\n\nRSVP: 9fw1@queensu.ca\n\nDAY 1 Bowling with Theo\n\nTuesday Nov 8, 4pm-8pm\n\nSplitsville\n\n10 Bath Rd (across from Canadian Tire)\n\nRegister: https://forms.gle/f91KP2ZqeiGwyRav8\n\nQueen’s University Department of Film and Media and documentary filmmaker Theo Anthony invite you to spend an evening playing the classic American sport of ten-pin bowling.

What could he have meant by this? This talk will explore Simondon’s cryptic suggestion both by presenting his triphasic theory of culture, in which magic is the first genetic (or rather ontogenetic) condition of culture and collective action, and by discussing a few contemporary instances of digital conjuring, both in art and in politics.\n\nVinícius Portella is an author, editor and independent researcher born in Brasília and based in Rio. He holds an MA from Dartmouth College and a PHD from Rio de Janeiro State University, both in comparative literature. His two areas of research are mythology and media theory, but lately his focus has been on the work of Gilbert Simondon and the concept of rhythm. His criticism has appeared in the LARB and revista Piauí and his academic articles have appeared in several journals inside and outside Brazil. In 2017 he published the novel \"Procedimentos de Arrigo Andrada\". He is also an editor and co-founder of Machado Editora.\n\nThis Event is not open to the Public."
