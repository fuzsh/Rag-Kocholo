In the creation of this two-part mural, the artist sought to craft a visual testament to the essence of the Arts Complex at FGCU, perceived as its very heart and soul. Utilizing acrylic paint, the mural brings to life figures imbued with the colors of the heart and third-eye chakras, symbols that resonate deeply with the artist. The heart, linked with breath and nature, and the soul, represented through the elemental imagery of water and the vastness of the ocean, merge to form a holistic vision. This artwork was envisioned to act as a conduit of healing energy for all who pass through the Arts Complex, enriching their journey with its restorative essence.\n\nThis project is supported by a grant from The Community Foundation.\n\nImage credit: Paul Firmin, Heart & Soul, 2024, Acrylic on four panels\n\nHeart and Soul image Wind Orchestra /cas/bsma/images/windorchestra.jpg 17 10 2024 7:30pm 1 6 U.

Tobe Recital Hall, Music Building, FGCU Campus\n\nThe Baroque era spanned from approximately 1600–1750, producing some of the greatest masterpieces in the history of Western music and a style that would become foundational for centuries to come.\n\nWhat is less well-known here in the West is that the Baroque period also witnessed the efflorescence of innovative and robust musical genres, styles, and traditions in societies extending far beyond Europe: Indonesian gamelan, Chinese guheng playing, Brazilian samba, and the creative expressions of enslaved people of African descent, to name a few.\n\nMoreover, the persistence of European Baroque influences on diverse musics around the world in modern times has continued to resonate across the global musicultural landscape throughout the centuries, from the song and panpipe traditions of the South American Andes and vibrant steel drum traditions of Trinidad to Irish dance tunes and the sacred music of Indigenous peoples from Florida to Bolivia.\n\nThis concert encompasses all these traditions and more through an exciting, eclectic musical journey that explores a pivotal historical period in the world of music-making, the Baroque, while also making the musical case for “Baroque music,” writ large, as a vital, living legacy of contemporary music the world over. Join FSU College of Music faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students for this musical performance of Global Baroque.\n\nGlobal Baroque Chamber & University Choirs, Bel Canto & Cantabile Concert /cas/bsma/images/joyful-337x261.jpg 18 02 2024 3:00 p.m. 1 6 New Hope Presbyterian Church, 10051 Plantation Rd., Fort Myers\n\nThis concert is free and open to the public\n\nChoirs Laila Biali Jazz Trio Nisita Concert Series /concerts/images/laila_biali.jpg 20 02 2024 7:30 p.m. 1 10 U.

He was also signed as a composer at age 18 – the youngest on their roster – with the music publisher Schott, Mainz. At the age of seven, after a fateful meeting in Paris, Emile became the last disciple of the legendary Nadia Boulanger, who referred to him as “The gift of my old age”. Since that time, he has enjoyed a worldwide performance career. He has been professor of piano at Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music since 1998. For his concert at FGCU he wil be playing works of Fauré, Ravel, Nadia Boulanger, Lili Boulanger, and his own compositions.\n\nTickets can be purchased online at fgcu.edu/concerts and are $15 for the general public or $7 for students.\n\nEmile Naoumoff FGCU Chamber Strings return to Sanibel! /concerts/images/string_quartet.jpg 02 04 2024 7:30 p.m. 1 6 Sanibel Congregational United Church of Christ, 2050 Periwinkle Way, Sanibel\n\n**Please note that this is a change of location from the one listed in the season brochure.
