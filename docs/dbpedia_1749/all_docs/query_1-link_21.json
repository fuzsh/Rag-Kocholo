It’s imperative to have conversations that highlight and address the challenges faced by professionals of all levels – but especially those that impact this historically marginalized community. It’s unfortunate, but fact: only 13.6% of PR specialists identify as Hispanic or Latino – and only about half of that number are at a leadership level, with just 7.6% describing their role as a PR manager, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nRegister now to hear from a group of top Hispanic PR and communications leaders from across industries as they share best practices to collectively increase Hispanic-Latino representation in our industry, along with how they’re mentoring the Hispanic leaders of tomorrow.
