Despite his lack of formal coaching, the fourteen-year-old, soon-to-be dancer began taking classes under Anthony Smith at Lewis Cass Technical High School where ballet was his first genre of study. Learning at fourteen years of age what others learned at four didn't come easy, but Billy held tight to the budding passion inside of him. Now a multidisciplinary dancer, choreographer, writer, and filmmaker; Billy James Hawkains III recently made history as the first African American male in over fifteen years to hold an MFA in dance from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Hawkains also holds a BFA in dance performance from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts.\n\nIn 2017, he began dancing with Theatre of Movement, a performance and visual art collective led by creative-visionary Duane Cyrus. Billy's work as a choreographic assistant to Cyrus can be seen in a number of works including \"Colony of Desire,\" a commission for the Charlotte Ballet that premiered in January 2020. Hawkains continued his work with the collective alongside mentor Duane Cyrus as a founding member of The Black Network; a band of artists, professionals and activists promoting funding opportunities and growth within the global black community.\n\nThroughout his career, Billy has performed world-renowned works by Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, Twyla Tharp, Doug Varone, Juel D. Lane, and many more. His unique dance style combines Ballet, Modern, Afro-contemporary, House, West African and Flow Acrobatics, to result in a visceral approach to movement that is both rhythmic and athletic.\n\nDuring his graduate research, Billy examined religious topics and themes in relation to movement. In his MFA thesis work, \"By Fire,\" he explores his deep connection to Afro-diasporic spirituality through dance and music.\n\nBilly's current creative expression is triggered by his Christian faith and interest in the technology of the human body. He hopes to continue his research by developing an embodied-movement-practice that summons the body's athletic and vigorous energy. He wants to help students think critically about the technology of their dancing bodies and its capacity to function as a vessel of knowledge and healing.\n\nPart-Time Assistant Professor of Dance\n\nnberry2@kennesaw.edu\n\n(470) 578-2852\n\nCP 306\n\nM.F.A.

Exponent - of the traditional and classical Indian dance form of Bharatanatyam in the Tanjavur style. All these six titles can describe Anupa Guha Thakurta. Well respected in the dance circles in the US, UK, and India, Anupa brings her own uniqueness as an artist and a teacher at the same time.\n\nAnupa was introduced to Bharatanatyam at the age of 6. Under the tutelage of world-renowned Padmabhushan Guru Saroja Vaidyanathan of Ganesa Natyalaya, New Delhi, Anupa grew her love for the dance form and eventually completed her Arangetam (solo dance concert after completion of her basic training) in 1998. She began her dance career after her debut and performed extensively all over the world. As her expertise continued to grow in the dance form, Anupa received the title of ‘Natyashree’ and then “Kalashree” from her guru for demonstrating mastery over movements, grace, balance and faultless sense of rhythm. In pursuit of her dance journey, she developed a passion for infusing dance, fitness, and discipline into her regimen. Anupa believes there is no end to learning - the more we learn the better we evolve as dancers. A lifelong learner, she still continues to sharpen her skills and techniques by attending various workshops and master classes conducted by Smt. Rama Vaidyanathan and Guru Saroja Vaidyanathan.\n\nAnupa has given recitals, concerts and lecture demonstrations of BharataNãtyam in India and a host of other countries and has choreographed a number of BharataNãtyam dance items for group and solo presentation. As a part of her dance repertoire, she has choreographed, directed and produced a number of productions: Sanskriti (2009), Chitrangada - The Warrior Princess (2009), Aakriti (2014), Prakriti (2017), Prayas (2019), Serenity (2022). She and her troupe have performed in various prestigious festivals in the US like Folkmoot/NC (2021), Rocky Mountain Thyagaraja Utsavam/Denver (2022) and various community fundraisers. Her repertoire of performances range from the traditional ‘Nataraja and dance festivals’ in India to ‘Festivals of India’ across the globe. Known for her bold, modern themes and strong choreography, Anupa is equally at home presenting a traditional Bharatanatyam margam for the ‘season’ in Delhi or Chennai or experimenting with form and style for performances in the US. Anupa was also in the Fellowship program of Indian Raga in 2020 and collaborated with Indian Classical dancers from all over the world to produce 2 videos - “Tarana Thakkita” and “Swagatham Krishna” which have generated acclaim on YouTube.\n\nAnupa graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree with Honors in English from the University of Delhi in the year 1998. She then took up a post-graduate course in Mass Communications at YMCA, New Delhi. She has attended and successfully passed numerous arts and dance related courses offered by the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya Mandal (University of Dance and Music) in Bombay, India and Prayag Sangeet Samiti (Indian Association of Renowned Dancers and Musicians) in Allahabad, India.\n\nAnupa continues her journey through the world of dance and music with intensive training and rewarding teaching experience as a pioneer in the Indian American Cultural Scene of the United States. She founded the Deeksha School of Performing Arts in 2007. To date, she has 15 Arangetrams to her credit as a dance guru.
