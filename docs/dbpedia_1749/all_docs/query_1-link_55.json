The pandemic accelerated how quickly the county need to respond to serve residents in an entirely new way without infrastructure to support it. The Office of Digital Experience was created to coordinate work across the organization to address residents’ digital needs with the goal to provide a consistently positive, accessible, and equitable digital service experience. The Office of Digital Experience accelerates the digital transformation of resident experiences by standardizing, prioritizing, and streamlining the rapid release of in-demand applications, websites, and tools, while centering the user every step of the way.\n\nThis model joins key partners in the business, the IT community, and communication and engagement together to deliver coordinated digital service that provide residents a consistently positive, accessible, and equitable experience. There are approximately 15-20 newly created positions to research, design, and implement new ways of coordinating digital work with an eye on equity and centering the resident voice. Hennepin County leverages its existing workforce by creating opportunities for temporary assignments, for up to 24 months, for current employees who have an interest in helping shape the future of creating an accessible and consistently positive Digital Experience for residents. Partner teams in the model operate within three separate departments, jointly collaborating in service of all business lines.\n\nThis structure enables appropriately resourced teams to focus on the core functions of digital experience, user experience, website communications, and web infrastructure to maintain and expand what the county’s digital service portfolio can provide to residents. The investment in the county’s digital services for all community members complements the Office of Broadband and Digital Inclusion’s work to eliminate the digital divide, too. Together these efforts create more opportunity for digital equity and engagement for Hennepin County residents.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, The Resident Real Estate Services division of Hennepin County quickly implemented a chat service off the Hennepin.us website as service centers closed. As in-person county services began to re-open, chat service continued to remain popular averaging over 500 chats a month. According to survey feedback, residents really like the ability to gain quick answers to their questions without having to come in person or wait on hold over the phone. Unfortunately, the quick vendor solution didn’t offer the capabilities and scalability that was needed to continue with the service. Additionally, many questions asked in chat had answers readily available on the Hennepin County website. The project established goals to both respond to simple resident questions through a chat bot allowing more time for Service Center agents to respond to more complex needs of residents. By keeping the scope of the project narrow, the chat service could be developed quickly and then adapted for use across other business areas while continuing to grow the volume of responses available from the chat bot.\n\nTo address usability, the project started by analyzing the previous years’ worth of transcripts, over 10,000 chats, to identify the topics and questions most asked by residents. From there, the field of responses were narrowed down to the fourteen most needed by residents and clear enough to be provided by a chat bot. The responses were then reviewed for plain language and readability by the User Experience team. A UX Designer from the team recognized that there were no standards for chat UI, so they created a guide to help developers in their initial design. Developers quickly built a prototype to put before stakeholders. Business owners were able to use resident questions from chat transcripts to validate and train the AI responses from the chat bot. A UX review refined the final product to create a chat flow that clearly indicated when the resident was chatting with a bot and when the chat was with a live person.\n\nThe early availability of the prototype allowed for an accessibility review, something the Enterprise IT developers had never experienced. This identified many barriers for use by screen reader and allowed time to repair before moving the chat service to production. This early action kept Hennepin County in regulatory compliance and trained developers on accessibility needs to incorporate in future work. Finally, the project incorporated an equity review throughout the project. First, a field was added to the current chat service for residents to voluntarily provide a zip code. Then, the zip code data was mapped to the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), identifying the needs of most vulnerable communities based on their chat requests. Finally, zip code and SVI were integrated into the chat service to prioritize those community needs and mitigate unintended impacts. The new chat service is designed to scale across the organization, meet the growing needs of Hennepin County residents, and prioritize the most vulnerable populations in the community.\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Veteran Affairs Claims and Field Operations, assists Minnesota Veterans, their dependents, and survivors with State and Federal benefits and services. Prior to the start of this project, our division was operating on four separate systems. MDVA’s Deputy Commissioner sought out to change that and envisioned creating a system where MDVA’s multiple divisions had one shared system for application submittals, case management, application processing, award grants, information sharing, data collection and reporting of our Veteran’s benefits and services. This project comprised of cross functional teams from multiple Agencies and Divisions within MDVA. Some of these included Minnesota IT services (MNIT), MDVA Higher Education Veterans Programs and MDVA Programs and Services.\n\nThe business manager ensured that all stories met the scope of the project and prioritized accordingly. The business analyst and scrum master ensured the developers were aware of the requirements. We had daily scheduled “stand ups” to verify tasks were being completed, resolve blockers, and clarify any requirements. The process was smooth, effective, and provided the business with a product that met all expectations and functions properly. Starting with the staff planning sessions in October 2019 and through the projected final release in November 2022 the process was completed in an agile, two-week SCRUM environment. The two-week process is called a sprint which consisted of, bi-weekly planning sessions, weekly backlog reviews, daily updates, and reviews.\n\nShortly after the beginning of this project, the need for this system increased dramatically with the United States Department of Veteran Affairs (USDVA) initiative to go paperless and the effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic. These two events took away the ability for Veterans, County Workers and MDVA employees to meet in person and to physically submit applications/documents to each other and to the USDVA, during a time when MN Veterans needed assistance the most. As a result of the VATS Claims Project MN Veterans, MDVA’s Field Operations and Minnesota’s 87 County Veteran Service Offices can securely upload applications to MDVA’s Claims Offices and MDVA’s Benefits Division. MDVA Claims staff were able to continue their mission remotely, throughout the pandemic without interrupting the services they provide to our MN Veterans and stakeholders. MDVA claims staff were able to change their workflow to a paperless operation. The VATS Claims project now allows MDVA Claims to be on one shared system remotely which includes functionality such as: secured claims processing, form generation, case management, data sharing, reporting, and API’s which allow secure direct submittal of applications/documents to the USDVA and status updates from the USDVA. VATS Claims also has an enhanced County Upload Portal in beta testing currently with an expected release to all MN counties in November 2022. The VATS Claims Portal allows County Veteran Service Offices to securely submit applications/documents to MDVA’s Claims offices and State Soldiers Assistance Program. The portal also allows MDVA to share data, case management information, and upload statuses for MDVA & USDVA to the County Users.\n\nLisa Meredith has been the Executive Director for Minnesota County Computer Cooperative (MnCCC) for 20 years.

She is the driving force in finding innovative, cost-effective software and technology solutions. Her efforts have transformed the landscape of public services. For example, recently Lisa was instrumental in two new software contracts that saved counties across Minnesota tens of thousands of dollars. In one project it was her initiative to get election software contracts in place for election equipment. In another project she assembled a group dedicated to Human Resources. With Lisa’s leadership this group went out for bid for payroll software, which is already saving counties on significant fees. Eventually that solution be offered to a wider local government audience.\n\nUnder Lisa’s leadership, MnCCC has grown to 13 user groups and continues to grow and meet county and other local government needs. Lisa balances an incredible workload. Along with hundreds of meetings with all levels of county leadership, she still makes the workplace a fun environment that encourages staff to achieve a very high level of work output. Lisa has a strong commitment to bringing people and agencies together to work collaboratively. She truly believes and has proven a lot more can be done together rather than apart. Her work doesn’t stop there. Lisa’s motto is “to embrace the audacious acts that incite positive change” and it is evident in her work using ToP Facilitation to help other organizations solve problems. As a true champion of innovation and collaboration to improve service, Lisa Meredith is so deserving of the Golden GOVIT Award.\n\nMegan Evans Seeds is the Chief Digital Officer for Hennepin County. She is a true public servant at heart and is passionate about the user experience of residents who engage with the county online.\n\nMegan has been an influential leader in the digital services space for years, beginning by effectively managing county websites to most recently creating the Digital Experience model at the county.

With Megan’s leadership, the Office of Digital Experience has launched or is set to launch new digital products, services, and resources:\n\n• Hennepin County Resident Services Chatbot\n\n• Hennepin County Web Standards\n\n• Hennepin County Climate Action website\n\n• The Hennepin County Digital Accessibility Policy\n\n• The Hennepin County User Experience Community of Practice\n\nThese are just a recent sampling of the outcomes from Megan’s vision, strategy, and leadership. Megan has unquestionably been instrumental in the advancement of Hennepin County’s service to residents. She has been a force for change and dedicated to improving digital services for residents throughout her career. She continues to inspire and motivate her team and organization and is worthy of recognition with the GovIT Individual Leadership Award for 2022.\n\nAs we have seen nationwide, the pandemic brought many new challenges for workforces, including how employees work and collaborate in a hybrid environment. This was no different for Hennepin County’s employees and it quickly became apparent that spaces needed to be created to offer accommodations for these new work scenarios. Michelle Heisler, who serves as the Enterprise Strategic Solutions Manager within the IT department at Hennepin County, led the effort to develop and implement a strategic IT solution, in response to the new hybrid workforce. At the very beginning of the pandemic Michelle’s preparation and work with Microsoft on setting up Teams enabled all county employees to seamlessly transition from an in-office work environment to literally overnight having Teams rolled out to all county employees. The next challenge then became what will things look like in the physical space of our buildings as employees started to prepare to return to the office. The focus of this project was to create an energetic feature rich environment that embodies the Hennepin County culture of innovation and to leverage the Microsoft Teams Rooms technologies along with providing a modern upbeat environment. Hennepin County’s Core Values include: Continuous Improvement, Customer Service, Diversity and Inclusion, Employee Engagement, and Workforce Development, all of which were vital frameworks to consider for the Collaborative Work Center project to be successful. Michelle’s leadership style truly and wholly exemplifies Hennepin County’s Core Values in every sense and are at the center everything she sets out to accomplish. To best portray Michelle’s leadership competency and further support why she is so deserving of this award, here are some thoughts and contributions from some of the project team members…\n\n• Michelle collaborated effectively and respectfully across all county departments to achieve shared goals.\n\n• She connects with organizations and contacts outside of the county and has even brought other organizations’ best practices to our conversations, so that we could decide what could be replicated or adapted to improve our spaces.\n\n• Michelle focused on direction from county leaders and considered employee’s past experiences to inform strategic service planning and was creative and persistent in solving what were often challenging problems\n\n• Michelle’s willingness to openly share and to listen to other’s ideas were very much appreciated.\n\nAs the project sponsor, Michelle provided support and guidance to help the project team overcome new and challenging hurdles. Supply chain issues, provisioning new equipment, and figuring out how to support these new devices all fell under Michelle’s leadership and relied on her expertise to get us where we are today. Michelle championed the concept of collaborative workspaces in challenging times and her commitment to making things better in a more innovative environment has enabled Hennepin County to set ourselves as true leaders in this space. It is truly an honor to have Michelle as part of our organization, leading the path for our future!\n\nWashington County is located on the western edge of Portland, Oregon. It covers over 700 square miles of land and has a 600,000 service population who live across urban, suburban, and rural areas. With unique online needs increasing for each area, the County knew it was time to replace its public website with a digital gateway to a variety of services and information. The IT team and the Office of Equity, Inclusion & Community Engagement partnered with an outside consultant (Interpersonal Frequency) to help them understand the issues on their website, invest in community engagement, and translate that knowledge into a new user experience. They took a holistic look at what their communities were intending to do on the site and the obstacles in their way. Washington County and Interpersonal Frequency gathered quantitative and qualitative data about how citizens used the site, their pain points, etc.\n\nFocus groups were completed with live translation services in their native languages for four key community groups: the Housing and Supportive Service Network, the Western Regional Emergency Task Force, the Vision Action Network, and the Latino Professionals in Government. Some fascinating feedback included how needed information was usually on the site, but it was challenging or overwhelming to locate, even through search. In situations like a mental health crisis, there was no time to attempt to dig through departments for contact information or locations for vital services. Additionally, touchpoints were too small for mobile and tablet users, especially in the navigation menus. The lack of accessibility features made groups wonder who the prioritized population was on the site. It was also very difficult to find Spanish versions of the content — it was clear that Spanish users wanted to engage, but had no tools to do so.\n\nWashington County and its consultant took that data and began designing a user experience that listened to these users. First, they created streamlined navigation and wayfinding with a simplified structure. This included clearly prioritized updates and hierarchy to guide users to key tasks and timely information. Then they created task-based and action-focused items like a prominent “How-Do-I” style menu on the homepage to speed up access to key items across the site. The user experience also broke down departmental silos so users didn’t need to understand the County’s structure to find services. The new design adhered to brand standards, but reflected a clean and organized new look with broad appeal. This design also accounted for a variety of screen sizes for a seamless new mobile experience that is easier to use, while aiming for improved performance and accessibility overall. It provides options for translation and multi-language support, with some content manually translated for accuracy. Throughout the process, the teams returned to these community groups and completed usability testing. Doing so kept the community engaged and helped them feel invested in the results. As advocates for the new website, they interact with it more often and actively share it with their colleagues.\n\nImagine being a single parent who was recently laid off from your 10+ year job due to downsizing. Your skills are outdated, and you’ve had difficulty obtaining employment that will pay the rent and feed your family. You apply for the Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP) and are eligible to receive the maximum of $1,305 in cash and food benefits each month. While rent, utilities, and two growing children cost significantly more, you’ll be able to avoid eviction for at least two months.\n\nYou begin working with an MFIP Employment Services (ES) Counselor, who explains that they can help with a resume, interviewing skills, funding for training, and help with your job search. After taking a short class to get a certificate and updating your resume, you finally land a job offer that will allow you to support your family without public assistance. Before you start the new job, you need funding for childcare until you can get a couple of paychecks and catch up on rent. Your ES Counselor explains that you need to sign an update to your Employment Plan so you can get childcare benefits approved. Before eSignature in WF1, there were few options to sign the document – all of which cost precious time and money.\n\nWhere you live in Greater MN, public transportation is not available. If you don’t have a car, you need to wait for the paperwork to be mailed to you, sign it, then mail it back to your counselor, which could take upwards of a month of more. You fear that your future employer will not be able to accommodate delaying your start date if it takes that long to get childcare. If you have a car, another option would be to drive to the Counselor’s office 45 minutes away, but that would cost $20 in gas. If you have internet and a printer, the document could be sent from your counselor via encrypted email, printed out (if you can afford ink at $30/cartridge), then faxed or scanned back to the counselor.\n\nWith the implementation of eSignature functionality in October 2022, your Counselor can send you the document for signature via email. You can open the document on your smartphone, tablet, or computer, sign and submit it within minutes. You can proceed with childcare arrangements and confirm your job start date with your new employer. It’s that simple. While eSignature functionality in WF1 has been a long-term plan, the pandemic expedited its development. The WF1 Team consulted with subject matter experts (SMEs) to gather requirements, verified security and validity of signed documents, and worked with a vendor. Gathering requirements from providers and program administrators allowed the WF1 Team to customize functionality so that it is available for over 2,000 staff and 100,000 customers. This enhancement is already changing the service delivery method to a more human-centered and accessible design, removing barriers for Minnesotans who are most in need.\n\nIn 2020, County Administrator David Hough asked 6,000 of the county’s staff to work remotely to prevent the spread of Covid-19. To continue county services, staff had to reimagine service delivery. One of the highest priorities for IT was to imagine new ways to support a hybrid workforce. County Administration created three worker profiles for staff: onsite, hybrid, or remote. Onsite workers were asked to work primarily or entirely at county facilities. Hybrid workers were asked to divide their time between remote and onsite work. Remote workers were asked to work primarily or entirely offsite.\n\nPre-pandemic, county buildings were divided into cubical or office spaces for departments – generally by floor or area. With new worker profiles, facilities would need to be transformed into places that hybrid or remote workers could temporarily use. IT partnered with the Facility Services Department to create new collaborative work centers. IT volunteered their 18 floor at the Hennepin County Government Center in downtown Minneapolis as a pilot.\n\nAfter significant planning, the team decided to create four different types of work zones. The first type is focus zones, which had technology staff would find in a cubicle pre-pandemic. The next type is a collaboration zone, which include conference rooms for both in-person and hybrid meetings. Next are community zones, which are informal places where staff can talk between meetings. Lastly, resource zones that include general office supplies and printers. Most of these spaces are equipped with Microsoft Teams Room technology. For meeting rooms, this includes a door scheduling panel to tell which rooms are booked, or the option to book in the moment. They also include equipment for hybrid meetings. Community zones include Teams phones and A/V equipment for impromptu meetings.\n\nWhen the pilot was complete, the project team worked with communications teams to announce the new space. This campaign included newsletter stories about topics including information about the types of work zones, guidance on shared space work etiquette, instructions on booking rooms, and reminders on items required for entry. Shortly after the opening of the 18 floor collaborative work center, Hennepin County opened a second space at the Ridgedale Regional Service Center – about 20 minutes away from the government center downtown. More collaborative work centers continue to be built and/or technology supplied in facilities around the county.\n\nToday, staff can choose between six locations for temporary work. IT and facilities will continue to work together on future collaborative work centers. The partnership between Facility Services and IT to create collaborative work centers for Hennepin County staff has been very successful. The collaborative work centers are an innovative way to integrate technology – like Microsoft Teams Rooms – into workspaces for staff. Other groups in Minnesota are asking Hennepin County for tours of these spaces to replicate the experience for this staff, including the Minnesota Department of Education, the Minnesota court systems, the state’s IT department, and the City of Minneapolis’s CIO.\n\nThe Post-9/11 Service Bonus project was developed using Agile principles to enable the team to meet project objectives in the extremely short application release target of nine weeks. MNIT and MDVA project team members, began project initiation immediately after the Omnibus Veterans and Military Affairs bill was signed in early May 2022. Key stakeholders included, Veterans, County partners, and agency clients. Business requirements were captured and prioritized by the MDVA Product Owner in partnership with the project team. The project team’s requirement gathering efforts resulted in objectives that included the ability for Veterans or their families to easily submit an online application and supporting documentation, ability for Veterans to view the status of their application, ability for MDVA staff to review and process applications, integration, and automation of Veteran payments with the State’s financial system, and delivery of monitoring analytics and reports for management control. State of Minnesota IT security best practices were an integral part of all phases of the project to mitigate and reduce application security risk and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe project team also captured project risks and corresponding mitigation plans during the project planning phase. A key risk identified during project initiation was the need for additional QA resources to meet the application testing requirements. The risk mitigation task involved a re-prioritization of MDVA work that resulted in additional QA resources being assigned to the project.\n\nApplication development was executed in two-week sprints where each story was developed to meet a specific acceptance criteria. Each story was also functionally tested within the sprint and defects were fixed immediately to ensure quality. Each two-week sprint included a sprint review with stakeholders to allow application features and functionality input to be provided or confirmed. User acceptance testing (UAT) was coordinated within the project once the key application functionality was developed. UAT spanned approximately half of the project development timeframe to allow business partners a hands-on opportunity to use the application, test features and provide feedback and input. The Post 9/11 Service Bonus application was successfully released on July 7, 2022.\n\nThe resulting application has provided Veterans, MDVA and county partners with one of the nation’s first service bonus applications. The solution provides a secure application for Veterans to apply for, and MDVA to administrate the Post 9/11 Service Bonus program which is sustainable and paperless through the payment process. As of October 28, 16,800 applications have been approved and $17.7M in payments have been dispersed to Veterans or their beneficiaries through the Post 9/11 Service Bonus application. A key component of the success of the project was the high level of partnership and collaboration between the MDVA and MNIT project team members. Despite the challenges of the project’s short timeframe and high importance, the project team members met their shared objectives through dedication, hard work and open and clear communication.

Though he performed all through high-school, he decided to stop performing when he went to college to “focus on his studies” (his parents were very proud of this decision).\n\nThat resolve lasted only a few months, as the first time he saw an improv comedy show he fell in love (his parents were slightly less proud). One week later he auditioned for the campus improv group, got in, and the rest is history. After graduating, he started Polywumpus Improv Comedy, which performed regularly in and around Philadelphia for seven years.

No matter how well you plan, things will go wrong, surprises will arise, and the Universe will throw you a curveball. Your success and sanity are directly related to how you respond these challenges. By the end of one of Avish’s presentations you will have key tools to flow with all that life throws at you. Avish has spoken to the very creative (actors and directors), the very un-creative (accountants), the very casual (college students), and the very business-like (sales professionals).
