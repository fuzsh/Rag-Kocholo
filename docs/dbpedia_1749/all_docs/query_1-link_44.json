        "text": "Kashmir Hill\n\nI’m a features writer on the business desk at The New York Times, covering technology and privacy.\n\nWhat I Cover\n\nI write about new technologies, and the unexpected and sometimes ominous ways they are changing our lives. I’m especially interested in how our data gets collected and used. Facial recognition technology, A.I. surveillance, genetic analysis and online reputation are some of the topics I’ve covered in the past.\n\nWhile I primarily tell other people’s stories, I will also personally experiment with different technologies to write about them firsthand. I’ve lived on Bitcoin, tracked my husband using Apple AirTags, and spent 24 hours in the metaverse. In 2018, I gave a TED Talk (“What your smart devices know [and share] about you”) describing what happened when I transformed my apartment into a smart home and monitored the data being collected by a web of tech firms.\n\nMy Background\n\nI’ve been writing about technology for more than a decade. I joined The New York Times in 2019, after working as an investigative reporter at Gizmodo Media Group and as a writer and editor at Fusion, Forbes Magazine and the legal news site Above the Law. My writing has also appeared in The New Yorker and The Washington Post. I am the author of “Your Face Belongs to Us: A Secretive Startup’s Quest to End Privacy as We Know It,” published by Random House.\n\nI grew up in Florida and attended Duke University and New York University, where I studied journalism. I’ve lived in Washington, D.C., Hong Kong and San Francisco. I currently reside in New York.\n\nJournalistic Ethics\n\nAs a Times journalist, I share the values and adhere to the standards of integrity outlined in The Times’s Ethical Journalism handbook. My goal is to tell stories that are accurate, fair and nuanced. I strive to protect sensitive sources. It is important to me that people harmed in some way by technology are not further harmed by our story about what happened to them.\n\nI have investments in mutual and index funds but do not have a direct financial interest in anything that I cover. I cannot accept gifts, money or favors from companies or anyone who might figure into my reporting. The Times asks us to report on the world “without fear or favor.”\n\nIf you’d like to contact me securely, use the NYT’s secure tip line, email me, or message me via one of the platforms below to ask for my Signal number."
