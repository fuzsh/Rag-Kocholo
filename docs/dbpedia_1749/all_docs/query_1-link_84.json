        "text": "Draft state of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) report\n\nOfficial title: Draft State of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Report\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada\n\nHealth Canada\n\nMay 2023\n\nDraft State of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Report [PDF - 2.02 MB]\n\nExecutive summary\n\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of over 4700 human-made substances. These substances have a wide range of uses in products available to consumers, industrial applications, and other specialized applications. The widespread use of these substances and their extreme persistence in the environment, propensity for accumulation, and mobility has led to PFAS being commonly detected in the environment and humans. Despite data having largely been generated on a limited suite of well-studied PFAS, there is a growing body of evidence that exposure to other PFAS can lead to adverse effects on the environment and human health. Cumulative effects from co-exposure to multiple PFAS may also occur.\n\nThis report provides a qualitative assessment of the fate, sources, occurrence, and potential impacts of PFAS on the environment and human health to inform decision-making on PFAS in Canada.\n\nThe common chemical characteristic of PFAS is their perfluoroalkyl moiety, which is extremely stable in the environment, to the extent that PFAS have often been termed “forever chemicals.” Simple PFAS are highly persistent, whereas more complex molecules transform into stable PFAS. In this report, PFAS refers to the broad chemical definition by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which—with a few noted exceptions—includes any chemical with at least a perfluorinated methyl group (–CF3) or a perfluorinated methylene group (–CF2–). This definition captures substances with a wide range of structures and properties, from discrete chemicals such as perfluorocarboxylic acids, perfluorosulfonic acids, and fluorotelomer alcohols, to side-chain fluorinated polymers and high molecular weight fluoropolymers. Some PFAS on the market also possess structural attributes other than perfluoroalkyl chains (for example, inclusion of ether linkages or chlorine atoms in the fluorinated hydrocarbon chains).\n\nThe desirable properties of PFAS (including their oil and water repellency, high chemical, physical and thermal resistance to degradation, and low surface tension) has led to their use in a wide range of products available to consumers and in industrial applications. Some typical uses of PFAS include surfactants, lubricants, and repellents (for dirt, water, and grease). PFAS can also be found in certain firefighting foams (that is, aqueous film-forming foams [AFFF]), textiles (for example, carpets, furniture, and clothing), cosmetics, and food packaging materials.\n\nThere are many potential sources of PFAS in Canada that can lead to human exposure and releases to the environment. Humans can be exposed to PFAS from various sources such as food and food packaging, cosmetics, products available to consumers, ambient air, indoor air and dust, and drinking water. Furthermore, PFAS-impacted contaminated sites represent “hot spot” areas across Canada where Canadians and the environment may be exposed to elevated concentrations of PFAS. Such sites include those associated with the use of AFFF, typically released during activities associated with fighting fuel fires, including training activities and maintenance of firefighting equipment at airports and military facilities. As it is not possible to separate PFAS-containing waste from the general waste stream, PFAS-containing products can be found in municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills or are destined for MSW incineration. Composting of PFAS-containing food packaging, releases into wastewater treatment systems, and the application of biosolids to land provide additional routes of entry for PFAS into the environment. It should be noted that PFAS contamination is present throughout Canada and is not limited to a few sources or areas.\n\nOnce PFAS are released into the environment, their physical and chemical properties influence their fate and behaviour. Neutral PFAS (for example, fluorotelomer alcohols) may be more volatile and therefore more likely to be found in the atmosphere. Fluorotelomer alcohols as well as other polyfluoroalkyl substances and some side-chain fluorinated polymers can undergo transformation to form other more stable PFAS that are extremely persistent in the environment under ambient conditions. Ionic PFAS (which are predominantly ionized at environmental pH) such as perfluorocarboxylic acids and perfluorosulfonic acids are water soluble and non-volatile, and thus partition predominantly to water where they can mobilize. Some shorter-chain PFAS, adopted in place of prohibited long-chain PFAS, have proven to be even more mobile on a local scale, potentially leading to transfer to food crops and drinking water. Some PFAS are also capable of undergoing long-range transport in the atmosphere (that is, for neutral, volatile PFAS) or in global ocean currents (that is, for ionic PFAS), as evidenced by their widespread distribution around the world, including in remote regions. Experience with contaminated sites management has also indicated that PFAS are very challenging to remove from environmental media, and it is not possible to remove them from the broader environment.\n\nGlobally, PFAS can be found in virtually all environmental compartments, including air, surface and groundwater, oceans and soils as well as in wastewater influent and effluent, landfill leachate, sewage sludge, and contaminated sites. While the highest reported concentrations are typically in proximity to known sources of release, PFAS are also routinely reported in locations far removed from these sources. Similarly, although the highest concentrations of PFAS in organisms have been noted in proximity to known releases, their ubiquitous presence has been noted in tissue samples collected from organisms worldwide. While the number of PFAS that have been examined in studies to date has been limited, studies have increasingly noted the frequent detection of a range of PFAS. Monitoring and research activities in Canada are being conducted to better understand trends in PFAS occurrence in Canadian ecosystems and wildlife. Thus far, these activities have confirmed the ubiquitous presence of PFAS throughout Canada.\n\nDepending on the substance’s physical and chemical properties, certain PFAS have been found to bioaccumulate in biota. PFAS have also been reported to significantly biomagnify (that is, to accumulate to increasingly higher levels up the food chain) in air-breathing organisms (for example, mammals, birds), which can increase the likelihood of adverse effects being observed. Ecotoxic effects such as immunotoxicity and neurotoxicity as well as effects on growth, reproduction, and development, have been reported in the literature, although there are still significant data gaps for certain species, subgroups of PFAS, and types of effects studied.\n\nCurrently, only a small number of PFAS are monitored in human biomonitoring surveys. Certain PFAS have been found in the blood (plasma or serum) of the general population in Canada and internationally. PFAS can also be transferred through the placenta, and infants and children can be exposed to PFAS though ingestion of human milk. A number of subpopulations were identified as having potential for greater exposure to PFAS. Northern Indigenous communities (as measured in adults, including pregnant women) as well as Indigenous youth and children in other parts of Canada were found to have elevated levels of certain PFAS. Firefighters internationally were also found to have elevated levels of certain PFAS. Canadian firefighters and people living in the vicinity of sites contaminated with PFAS (for example, associated with the use of AFFF) may also be disproportionately exposed to higher levels of PFAS, although specific Canadian biomonitoring information was not available for these subpopulations.\n\nIn humans, some well-studied PFAS can be readily absorbed in the body and bind to proteins in the blood. These PFAS can then be distributed through the bloodstream and accumulate in well perfused tissues (for example, liver and kidneys). Some of the studied PFAS have been shown to be eliminated very slowly from the human body. Toxicological (in vitro and in vivo) and human epidemiological information is only available for a limited number of PFAS. On the basis of these studies, it is evident that exposure to PFAS has the potential to cause effects of concern to human health. Furthermore, recent information on well-studied PFAS, particularly perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), shows negative effects on human health at lower levels than in previous studies. Effects commonly reported in animal studies include effects on the liver, kidney, thyroid, immune system, nervous system, metabolism and bodyweight, and reproduction and development. Outcomes of human epidemiological studies involve similar organs/systems/endpoints.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of toxicology and epidemiology studies have focused on the effects from exposure to a single PFAS, biota and humans typically experience exposure to many PFAS at a given time, as can be seen from environmental sampling and biomonitoring data. A limited number of studies have evaluated the interactive effect of multiple PFAS on different endpoints; however, given the vast number and ubiquity of PFAS, it is reasonable to assume that cumulative effects may occur. The Government of Canada has been actively studying the ecological and human health effects associated with exposure to PFAS, including the use of new approach methods to characterize multiple PFAS in biological and environmental media at the same time. These studies confirm the environmental presence of PFAS mixtures that include many substances that are not targeted in typical monitoring and surveillance studies. In addition to specific initiatives, there are ongoing environmental and human monitoring and surveillance programs to address subpopulations that may be more susceptible or highly exposed, including pregnant women and children, Indigenous and northern communities in Canada, and firefighters.\n\nCanada has acted to address PFAS for which early evidence had indicated potential concerns for the environment or human health. A limited number of subgroups of PFAS are subject to risk management controls in Canada. The manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, and import of PFOS, PFOA, long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, and their salts and precursors are prohibited under the Prohibition of Certain Toxic Substances Regulations, 2012, with a limited number of exemptions. Proposed regulations that would repeal and replace the Prohibition of Certain Toxic Substances Regulations, 2012, were also published in May 2022, which propose to further restrict these groups of substances by removing or providing time limits for most remaining exemptions. Some PFAS notified under the New Substances Notification Regulations (Chemicals and Polymers) have also been subject to prohibitions, ministerial conditions, and significant new activity provisions under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA). It has been observed that shorter-chain PFAS have been used as substitutes for long-chain PFAS (carbon chain length of 8 or more) following the implementation of regulatory restrictions on the latter.\n\nOther domestic activities that target PFAS include water and soil guidelines developed for the protection of human health and the environment by the Government of Canada or through the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME), reducing risks from known federal contaminated sites through the Federal Contaminated Sites Action Plan and reducing the anthropogenic release of chemicals of mutual concern into the Great Lakes under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Regulations for the import, export, and manufacture of certain ozone-depleting substances and concerning halocarbon alternatives are also set out under the Ozone-Depleting Substances and Halocarbon Alternatives Regulations.\n\nThe Government of Canada works with other governments internationally on initiatives that address PFAS, including through the OECD and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. For example, Canada has successfully nominated long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, their salts, and related compounds for addition to the Stockholm Convention.\n\nGiven the significant data gaps for most PFAS and the complexity and magnitude of the group, continuing to assess and manage risks of individual PFAS or small groups of PFAS is impractical and does not address the broader concern posed by these substances. Complexities include the nature of their physical and chemical properties, unique environmental fate and behaviour characteristics, and co-exposure to multiple PFAS in biota and humans. Generating data and applying a quantitative risk analysis and management approach would take an extremely long time; meanwhile, exposures to the environment and humans would continue to increase, and new PFAS would continue to be created or used in Canada.\n\nThe broad use of PFAS and their consequent ubiquitous presence in the environment have resulted in continuous environmental and human exposure to multiple PFAS, with well-studied PFAS demonstrating the potential to affect multiple systems and organs in both humans and wildlife. Certain PFAS may potentially bioaccumulate and biomagnify in food webs to an extent that can cause adverse effects in biota at low environmental concentrations; recent information on well-studied PFAS, particularly PFOA and PFOS, also shows negative human health effects at lower levels than indicated by previous studies. As a result of the extreme persistence of PFAS, their potential for bioaccumulation in organisms and biomagnification through the food chain, their ability to move locally and over long ranges, and the difficulty of their removal from the broader environment, environmental concentrations and uptake by biota and humans will increase in the absence of intervention. Additionally, the potential for cumulative exposure and effects are important considerations as most wildlife and human exposures involve an unknown mixture of PFAS.\n\nDespite uncertainties associated with understanding the characteristics of substances across the range of PFAS structures from toxicological, epidemiological and monitoring datasets that are focused on a limited number of PFAS, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that concerns identified for well-studied PFAS are more broadly applicable than previously believed. Similarly, while the specific hazards associated with mixtures of PFAS are largely unknown, there are many potential sources of PFAS that can lead to exposure and it is reasonable to assume that cumulative effects may occur from exposure to multiple PFAS.\n\nConsistent with application of precautionary assumptions that are protective of human health and the environment when addressing gaps in information, it is necessary to anticipate that hazardous properties identified for PFAS that have been well studied may also be inherent in other substances in the class, and that combined exposure to multiple PFAS increases the likelihood of detrimental impacts.\n\nOwing to the extreme persistence of these substances, potential impacts on the environment are expected to increase if entry to the environment continues. On the basis of what is known about well-studied PFAS and the potential for other PFAS to behave similarly, it is proposed that the class of PFAS meets the criterion under paragraph 64(a) of CEPA as these substances are entering or may enter the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have immediate or long-term harmful effects on the environment or its biological diversity. However, it is proposed to conclude that the class of PFAS does not meet the criterion under paragraph 64(b) of CEPA as these substances are not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger to the environment on which life depends.\n\nOwing to the widespread use of PFAS combined with their ubiquitous presence in the environment, humans are continuously exposed to multiple PFAS, which have the potential to cause adverse effects of concern. On the basis of what is known about well-studied PFAS and the potential for other PFAS to behave similarly, and on the expectation that combined exposures to multiple PFAS increase the likelihood of detrimental impacts, it is proposed that the class of PFAS meets the criterion under paragraph 64(c) of CEPA as these substances are entering or may enter the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health.\n\nTherefore, it is proposed to conclude that the class of PFAS meets one or more of the criteria set out in section 64 of CEPA.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nPursuant to section 68 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) (Canada 1999), the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health have developed a report on the class of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to provide an overview of the sources, fate, occurrence, and potential impacts of PFAS on the environment and human health. This report and its proposed conclusion are intended to inform decision-making on PFAS as a class in Canada. This class of substances was considered a priority on the basis that scientific evidence to date indicates that the PFAS used to replace regulated PFAS (that is, perfluorooctane sulfonate and its salts and precursors [PFOS], perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts and precursors [PFOA], and long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids [LC-PFCAs] and their salts and precursors) may also be associated with environmental or human health effects.\n\nPFAS are a large class of human-made substances that include a very broad range of chemicals from discrete fluorosurfactants to high molecular weight fluoropolymers, including larger precursors that can transform in the environment to produce simpler PFAS. Their unique properties have led to their use in a wide range of industrial processes and consumer products, such as surfactants and water and grease repellents. For example, these substances are used in certain firefighting foams, textiles (including carpets and clothing), cosmetics, and paper food packaging.\n\nThe common chemical characteristic of PFAS is the perfluoroalkyl moiety, which is extremely stable, rendering it resistant to environmental and metabolic transformation. As a result of this stability, PFAS have often been termed “forever chemicals” due to their long persistence in the environment. The extreme persistence of the fluorocarbon moiety, combined with the propensity for environmental accumulation and mobility of many PFAS, has resulted in the ubiquitous presence of PFAS globally, even in remote regions like the Arctic (Kwiatkowski et al. 2020). It has been argued that the ongoing release of these highly persistent substances will result in increased concentrations and increased probabilities of known and unknown effects (Cousins et al. 2020a).\n\nThe widespread use of these substances has led to the presence of certain PFAS in humans and nearly all environmental compartments, including ambient air, surface waters, groundwater, marine waters, and soil as well as in landfill leachates, wastewater influent and effluent, sewage sludge, and contaminated sites (for example, ECHA 2022c). Globally, several groups of PFAS have been found in the environment near point sources, such as manufacturing plants and sites where firefighting foams have been used, including airports and military bases (for example, Hu et al. 2016; Lanza et al. 2016). PFAS can also be released to the environment through consumer use and disposal of PFAS-containing products. Therefore, landfills and wastewater treatment facilities (including associated waste products such as biosolids) are potential PFAS sources (for example, Gewurtz et al. 2013; Lakshminarasimman et al. 2021). Once in the environment, certain PFAS move readily through water and soil and can contaminate large areas (for example, Bhavsar et al. 2016; CCME 2021a). Significant costs are associated with assessing and remediating contaminated soil and drinking water sources (Kwiatkowski et al. 2020). This is because PFAS (and especially the perfluoroalkyl moiety) do not readily break down, and treatment and destruction technologies at commercial scales are still quite limited. Many PFAS have been shown to be transported long distances through the atmosphere, waterbodies, and within groundwater. Long-range transport of PFAS has resulted in these substances being found in the Arctic in air, ice, and both fresh and salt water as well as in wildlife such as polar bears, whales, seals, and birds (Muir et al. 2019). Certain PFAS have also been found in significantly higher concentrations in northern First Nations and Inuit communities compared with the rest of the Canadian population (for example, Caron-Beaudoin et al. 2020; Garcia-Barrios et al. 2021).\n\nIn Canada, three well-defined subgroups of PFAS (that is, PFOS, PFOA, and LC-PFCAs, and their salts and precursors) were assessed under Canada’s Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) (EC 2006, 2012; EC, HC 2012). These groups were added to the List of Toxic Substances found in Schedule 1 of CEPA on the basis of risks to the environment due in large part to their persistence and bioaccumulation potential, and are regulated under the Prohibition of Certain Toxic Substances Regulations, 2012 (PCTSR). This risk management measure addresses 94 PFAS on the Domestic Substances List (DSL)Footnote 1 (Canada 1999). Given that these subgroups are defined using a description of the fluorinated moiety, the risk management measures also apply to any PFAS meeting the description, even those not known to be used in commerce in Canada. Approximately 100 PFAS, notified under the New Substances Notification Regulations (Chemicals and Polymers) (NSNR), have also been subject to prohibitions, ministerial conditions, or significant new activity (SNAc) provisions under CEPA. Many of these actions under the NSNR have been rescinded and replaced by the introduction of other regulations, which cover the same substances and prevent risk to human health and/or the environment (for example, the Ozone-Depleting Substances and Halocarbon Alternatives Regulations [ODSHAR]).\n\nA quantitative risk analysis and management approach on discrete substances, subgroups, or groups of existing PFAS (that is, with risk conclusions drawn and management actions taken for each substance/group) has been recognized as an inefficient way to manage the broad class of PFAS. Many scientists (Helsingør, Madrid, and Zürich Statements [Scheringer et al. 2014; Blum et al. 2015; Ritscher et al. 2018]) recommend a preventive and precautionary approach to this class of substances, with management actions undertaken on broad subgroups or on the class in its entirety despite a lack of scientific certainty regarding the majority of PFAS, which remain poorly studied. In addition, multilateral organizations and agreements, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nation’s Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), have recognized the potential for regrettable substitution within the PFAS family. Many jurisdictions, including the European Union, have acted or committed to taking action on PFAS as a class.\n\nIn April 2021, the Government of Canada published a Notice of Intent, signalling an intent to move forward with activities to address PFAS as a class, including the publication of this State of PFAS Report summarizing relevant information on the class of PFAS (ECCC, HC 2021). This report is not a quantitative assessment of the risks of PFAS, but rather provides a qualitative assessment of the fate, sources, occurrence, and potential impacts of PFAS on the environment and human health, including the basis for a class-based approach and application of precaution, to inform decision-making on PFAS in Canada. It includes information collected through targeted literature searches, including information submitted by stakeholders in response to the Notice of Intent to Address PFAS as a Class (ECCC, HC 2021). The majority of relevant data were identified up to March 2022, with targeted data identified up to August 2022. This report has undergone external review and/or consultation. Comments on the report were received from Ms. Theresa Lopez, Ms. Jennifer Flippin, and Dr. Joan Garey at Tetra Tech.\n\n1.1 Chemical scope\n\nThe class of PFAS encompasses a broad range of structures (for example, ethers, polymers), including those with varying degrees of fluorination and chain length (Buck et al. 2011; ITRC 2020a; OECD 2021; Wang et al. 2017a). This is illustrated by the OECD list of approximately 4700 PFAS, compiled from public sources (OECD 2018a). Additionally, new PFAS are continually being invented and notified to Canada.\n\nWhile certain chemical definitions have been proposed for PFAS, such as those found in reports by the Interstate Technology and Regulatory Council (ITRC 2020a), the Toxics Use Reduction Institute (TURI 2021), and the US EPA (2021a), the term has not benefited from a community-accepted definition. Under the auspices of the OECD/UNEP Global PFC Group, a document has been published to address PFAS terminology. This document uses the OECD (2021) definition for PFAS, defined as “fluorinated substances that contain at least one fully fluorinated methyl or methylene carbon atom (without any H/Cl/Br/I atom attached to it), that is, with a few noted exceptions, any chemical with at least a perfluorinated methyl group (–CF3) or a perfluorinated methylene group (–CF2–) is a PFAS.”\n\nThis chemical definition captures substances with a wide range of structures, properties, and use patterns that may be subject to differences in regulatory oversight. The fluorocarbon moiety is frequently functionalized, commonly as carboxylic or sulfonic acids (for example, PFOA or PFOS) or as fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs). These functionalized molecules may be used to chemically link the fluorocarbon moiety, with its unique properties, to more complex molecules, such as side-chain fluorinated polymers or sulfonamidoethanol compounds.\n\nPFAS are sometimes classified on the basis of whether they are polymeric or non-polymeric (Buck et al. 2011). Polymeric PFAS include side-chain fluorinated polymers such as those produced using fluorotelomer acrylate monomers or perfluorinated sulfonamide side chain-, urethane-based co-polymers (Chu and Letcher 2014). For the former, the resulting polymer contains fluorinated side-chain components bonded via simple esters. Polyfluoropolyethers feature perfluorinated carbons or a series of perfluorinated carbons separated by oxygen atoms. The linkage chemistry between the per- or poly-fluorinated moiety within a polymer, including fluorinated side-chains, may provide an opportunity for transformation and the release of discrete, non-polymeric PFAS (ITRC 2021a).\n\nA third polymer subgroup, fluoropolymers, have been described as those made by (co)polymerization of olefinic monomers, at least one of which contains F bound to one or both of the olefinic C atoms, to form a carbon-only polymer backbone with F atoms directly attached to it, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (Buck et al. 2011).\n\nThe OECD (2021) definition of PFAS is broader than the moiety approach used to compile the OECD list of PFAS in 2018; consequently, the number of individual PFAS exceeds the approximate 4700 PFAS originally identified using this new definition. For example, it includes certain drugs, pesticides, and many substances that are regulated in Canada under the ODSHAR, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Trifluoracetic acid, a transformation product formed in the atmosphere from some of the ODSHAR-regulated substances and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) (UNEP 2016), is also captured by the OECD definition.\n\nThis State of PFAS Report uses the 2021 OECD chemical definition of PFAS, given the concern with the stability of the fluorocarbon moiety, which results in persistence in the environment and resistance to transformation. For PFAS that experience some transformation, the fluorinated portion of the molecule is typically preserved, resulting in stable PFAS transformation products. While the scope of PFAS is based on a chemical definition, the OECD (2021) report notes that individual jurisdictions may need a working definition for PFAS, which may be established by combining the general definition of PFAS with additional considerations (for example, specific properties or use areas). Such a working definition may be beneficial when contemplating regulatory or non-regulatory approaches to reduce exposure.\n\nPFAS acronyms that are frequently used in this report are defined in Appendix A. This State of PFAS Report often refers to long-chain (LC) and short-chain (SC) PFAS, where long-chain refers to a carbon chain length of 8 (C8) or higher and short-chain refers to a carbon chain length of 7 (C7) or lower. Reports by other authors (for example, the OECD) may refer to perfluorinated sulfonates with 6 (C6) or more fully fluorinated carbons (for example, PFHxS) as long-chain PFAS; however, the definitions of short-chain and long-chain PFAS used in this report are consistent with other Government of Canada publications. Moreover, reference to perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) includes the PFAAs (for example, PFCAs, PFSAs, PFPAs, PFPiAs) and perfluoroalkylether acids (for example, PFECAs, PFESAs) subgroups.\n\n2. Uses and sources of exposure\n\nKey points on uses and sources of exposure\n\nPFAS are used in many industrial sectors and are found in a wide range of products, including certain firefighting foams (that is, AFFF), textiles (including carpets, furniture, and clothing), cosmetics, and food packaging materials.\n\nSome other uses of PFAS include solvents; processing aids; oil/water repellents in packaging; levelling agents in paints, ink, and adhesive formulations; and refrigerants / blowing agents.\n\nPFAS-impacted contaminated sites represent “hot spot” areas across Canada where Canadians and the environment may be exposed to elevated concentrations of PFAS and include sites associated with the use of firefighting foams.\n\nFood and food packaging, cosmetics, products available to consumers, ambient air, indoor air and dust, and drinking water as well as PFAS releases from municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills, MSW incineration, composting of PFAS-containing food packaging, wastewater treatment systems, and the application of biosolids to land are also potential sources of human and environmental exposure to PFAS.\n\nPFAS contamination is present throughout Canada and is not limited to a few sources and areas.\n\n2.1 Uses of PFAS\n\nPFAS possess a unique set of practical traits that are useful in a broad spectrum of applications, such as:\n\noil and water repellency, which provides stain resistance, soil repellency, and non-stick properties;\n\nhigh resistance to chemical, physical, and thermal degradation (or for precursors, transformation to other stable PFAS); and\n\nlow surface tension, resulting in the use of PFAS as surfactants and lubricants.\n\nDue to their unique properties, PFAS are used in many industrial sectors and are found in a wide range of products, including certain firefighting foams, food packaging, non-stick cookware, drugs, cosmetics, textiles, vehicles, and electronics. A 2020 study (Glüge et al. 2020) identified more than 200 uses within 64 use categories for more than 1400 PFAS. Table 4 of that study presents in detail the known PFAS uses, functions, and the related sectors. Furthermore, fluoropolymers have uses in a variety of applications including medical devices, mechanical parts, and chemical processing equipment (Henry et al. 2018).\n\nPFAS are commonly used in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF). AFFF is a synthetic mixture that may contain hydrocarbon-based surfactants and fluorinated surfactants with the ability to rapidly extinguish hydrocarbon fuel fires. Prior to the voluntary phaseout of its production in 2002, the most commonly used PFAS in firefighting foams was PFOS. In Canada, AFFF that contain certain regulated PFAS are prohibited under the PCTSR with a few exemptions (Canada 2012a). The regulations currently allow the use of AFFF that contains residual levels of PFOS (up to a maximum concentration of 10 ppm), the use and import of AFFF contaminated with PFOS in a military vessel or military firefighting vehicle returning from a foreign military operation, and the import, use, sale, and offer for sale of AFFF that contains PFOA and/or LC-PFCAs used in firefighting. These exemptions accommodate the transition to alternatives to PFOA and/or LC-PFCAs and the residual levels of PFOS that remain in firefighting equipment from historical use of the substance. These regulations are currently being revised, and the proposed Prohibition of Certain Toxic Substances Regulations, 2022 would further restrict these exemptions (Canada 2022a). Certain shorter length PFAS have been used as replacements for regulated PFAS in this application. PFAS releases from AFFF have led to contaminated sites in Canada, which is further discussed in section 2.3.\n\nIn Canada, although there are regulations in place prohibiting PFOS, PFOA, LC-PFCAs, their salts, and their precursors, these regulations currently include a limited number of exemptions such as manufactured items. As a result, these substances may remain in circulation (refer to section 8.1.1 for additional information on risk management under CEPA). Furthermore, longer-chain PFAS are often produced as impurities during the manufacturing process of shorter-chain length replacements, and they may still be present in the effluents of manufacturing plants and in finished products (Prevedouros et al. 2006).\n\nEight different Canadian surveys to gather information on commercial activity in Canada, issued pursuant to section 71 of CEPA since the year 2000, have included a total of 269 PFAS, with a number of these PFAS being included in more than one survey (Canada 2005a, 2005b, 2012b, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2020a). Of the 269 PFAS that have been surveyed, responses were received for 87 PFAS from 27 different companies in 150 reports submitted to the various surveys. Most of these surveys were conducted more than 10 years ago; only 54 different PFAS have been surveyed in the past 10 years. Of the 269 PFAS surveyed, 169 have been prohibited by the PCTSR, 2012 since they were last surveyed. As a result, the data gathered via these surveys is not considered further in this report.\n\nOnly very limited information on the type and concentrations of PFAS used in consumer products sold in Canada is available (Beesoon et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2015).\n\n2.1.1 Uses notified to the Government of Canada\n\nKnowledge of the many uses of PFAS in Canada has been informed by New Substances Notifications received under the NSNR of CEPA, Cosmetic Notifications received under the Cosmetic Regulations of the Food and Drugs Act (F&DA), and voluntary submissions received by Health Canada that are related to food packaging materials (FPMs).\n\n2.1.1.1 New substances notification regulations (NSNR)\n\nApproximately 270 new PFAS have been notified to Canada under the NSNR since 1994 (half of which are polymers). Of the 270 PFAS, 28 have been identified as intended to be manufactured in Canada, albeit with limitations (for example, identified as contained site-limited intermediates, contained for export only, subject to the ODSHAR, or subject to the SNAc provisions of CEPA). New substances that are imported into or manufactured in Canada are subject to notification requirements tiered to annual import/manufacture quantity. Notification requires substance-specific information such as identity, use, hazard, and ecotoxicity information in order to assess the potential for risk to humans and the environment.\n\nThese New Substances Notifications have indicated a wide range of potential uses for chemical PFAS (Figure 1). Some typical uses notified for chemical PFAS include as processing aids (for example, mould release agents for plastics); oil/water repellents in packaging, carpet, leather, fabric, and tile; levelling agents in paints, ink, and adhesive formulations; grease-proof coating for food packaging (that is, food contact materials); refrigerants / blowing agents; firefighting foams (surfactants in AFFF); or as active ingredients in human and veterinary drug products. “Other” uses in Figure 1 include antistatic agents, colourants, electrolytes, cosmetic ingredients, tracers, and herbicide safeners. Polymers, which are not represented in Figure 1, were notified mostly with the intended use of anti-stain and water/oil repellency, with some intended uses as surfactants, processing aids, and levelling agents.\n\nLong description\n\nFigure 1 is a pie chart that shows the various uses notified to the New Substances Program for new PFAS (chemicals) intended to be imported into or manufactured in Canada. The list of uses was compliled from New Substances Notifications submitted by importers and manufacturers of new chemical PFAS since 1994. The pie chart shows 6 typical uses that were notified for PFAS: active ingredient in drugs (5%), water and oil repellent (7%), solvent (17%), refrigerant/blowing agent (22%), processing aid (6%), levelling agent (5%), heat transfer fluid (4%), firefighting (10%), and reactive intermediate (12%). A tenth slice of the pie chart (12%) is marked as “Other” and represents multiple uses for which there were relatively few notifications received for the notified PFAS: antistatic agents, colourants, electrolytes, cosmetic ingredients, tracers, and herbicide safeners. The pie chart shows that PFAS are used in a variety of applications and illustrates the most common uses for chemical PFAS.\n\nApproximately 90 PFAS notified under the NSNR have been added to the Domestic Substances List (DSL). Once a substance is added to the DSL, it may be used for any purpose unless it is subject to risk management measures.\n\nPrior to 2016, many refrigerants and blowing agents notified under the NSNR were later added to the DSL with or without risk management measures; however, as of December 2016, these substances have been regulated under the ODSHAR (see section 8.1).\n\nAlthough the intended uses notified by importers and manufacturers under the NSNR are largely industrial, some of the same PFAS may be used in other types of products, such as cosmetics. Despite the fact that few PFAS with a reported intended use in cosmetics have been notified under the NSNR, subsequent analysis has shown that 15 PFAS notified under the NSNR for industrial uses, including some not on the DSL, have also been notified for cosmetic use in Canada under the Cosmetic Regulations and are presently used in cosmetics. Therefore, PFAS that were reported to have industrial uses at the time of notification (such as an industrial foam stabilizer) may be subsequently used in non-industrial products that result in greater direct human exposure (such as cosmetics).\n\n2.1.1.2 Cosmetics\n\nPFAS are intentionally added to some cosmetics, such as foundations, moisturizers, lotions, and creams, to improve the penetration of other ingredients into the skin, enhance brightness, and increase the durability of makeup. Section 30 of the Cosmetic Regulations requires that all manufacturers and importers of cosmetics submit a Cosmetic Notification (CN) form to Health Canada, which includes a list of all the ingredients and, for each ingredient, its exact concentration or the concentration range (Canada 2019). Between 1993 and 2020, a total of 4775 CNs containing one or more PFAS were submitted to Health Canada. Approximately 90% of these notifications were for leave-on products such as makeup and moisturizers, and are intended to be used on body, face, lips and eye areas. Most of these products (86.5%) contain listed PFAS at or below a concentration of 3%; in about 2.5% of the products, PFAS ingredients are notified above a concentration of 10%. A preliminary trend analysis of the CN data indicated that the annual number of notifications of PFAS-containing cosmetics increased between 1993 and 2017, reaching a maximum of 663 in 2017. Notifications then decreased to approximately 400 per year between 2018 and 2020. Health Canada typically receives between 50 000 and 60 000 CNs per year for cosmetics such as cleansers, conditioners, exfoliators, foundations, body creams, makeup products, and sunscreen. PFAS-containing CNs received each year represent less than 1% of the total CNs received by Health Canada annually.\n\nAs of July 2021, 71 unique PFAS ingredients have been notified in cosmetics in Canada. These PFAS ingredient names are notified using the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) naming convention. Among these, 10 (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE], perfluorodecalin, polyperfluoromethyl isopropyl ether, perfluorononyl dimethicone, trifluoroacetyl tripeptide-2, polyperfluoroethoxymethoxy difluoroethyl PEG Phosphate, perfluorohexylethyl triethoxysilane, methyl perfluorobutyl ether, tetradecyl aminobutyroylvalylaminobutyric urea trifluoroacetate, and methyl perfluoroisobutyl ether) were the most frequently notified PFAS ingredients. Given that PFOA and PFOS are prohibited substances under the PCTSR, they were not notified as cosmetic ingredients per se; however, cosmetics containing polymeric PFAS such as PTFE, FTOHs, and PAPs may be potential sources of PFOA, PFOS, and other PFAAs ( Fujii et al. 2012).\n\nThe identification and measurement of PFAS in cosmetics is still an emerging area internationally. Using chromatographic methods, several research groups have investigated cosmetic products for specific PFAAs and their precursors (Danish EPA 2018; Whitehead et al. 2021). PFCA precursors, including 6:2 and 8:2 fluorotelomer compounds, were detected in cosmetics purchased in the United States and Canada (Whitehead et al. 2021). The concentration of individual PFAS varied widely in tested samples, ranging from low ppb to ppm. In addition, several researchers have studied the total fluorine and extractable organic fluorine content in cosmetic products using methods that do not identify/differentiate between different kinds of fluorine-containing substances and which may include non-PFAS (Fujii et al. 2013; Schultes et al. 2018; Whitehead et al. 2021). The results from these studies indicate that the sum of the concentrations of individually identified PFAS measured in cosmetics was substantially lower than their respective total fluorine content, in many cases accounting for only about 1% of the total fluorine. Consequently, the lack of mass balance observed in these studies indicates the presence of many unknown fluorinated substances in cosmetics, some of which may be PFAS. The availability of a wide spectrum of fluorinated ingredients and lack of analytical standards makes it challenging to screen for individual PFAS in cosmetics.\n\n2.1.1.3 Food packaging\n\nIn Canada, all food packaging materials (FPMs), including domestic and imported materials, must comply with the safety provisions under Division 23 of the Food and Drugs Regulations. Division 23 prohibits the sale of food in a package that could transfer a chemical to the food that may be harmful to the health of the consumer. The responsibility to ensure that the materials used in contact with foods are in compliance with regulatory requirements lies with the food seller (for example, the food manufacturer, packager, or distributor). However, food packaging manufacturers are able to voluntarily seek the opinion of Health Canada regarding the acceptability, from a food safety perspective, of the FPMs that they wish to sell to the food industry.\n\nTo date, Health Canada has evaluated and issued Letters of No Objection concerning 21 polymeric PFAS (that is, fluoropolymers, perfluoropolyether polymers, and side-chain fluorinated [co]polymers). These polymeric PFAS are typically used in food contact applications such as in non-stick cookware, gaskets, parts for food processing equipment, and paper/paperboard food packaging. These uses are consistent with the use of PFAS reported in food contact materials internationally (US FDA 2022a; European Commission 2020a; OECD 2020).\n\nGiven the existing risk management actions in Canada (see section 8.1.1), the United States, and Europe (OECD 2015, 2020; US EPA 2009), the presence of PFOS-based food packaging on the Canadian marketplace is not expected. The proposed amendments to the PCTSR will further restrict the import, use, sale, and offer for sale of manufactured items containing PFOA and LC-PFCAs in Canada (Canada 2022a).\n\nIn June 2022, the Single-use Plastics Prohibition Regulations was published in the Canada Gazette, Part II, prohibiting the manufacture, import, and sale of 6 categories of single-use plastics (Canada 2022b). It is possible that single-use plastic food takeout containers and straws may be replaced by paper alternatives that may contain PFAS treatments.\n\nAdditionally, since treated paper and paperboard may enter recycled paper feedstock, it is possible that untreated paper products made from recycled feedstock will contain detectable concentrations of PFAS. According to Curtzwiler et al. (2021), the PFCA (that is, PFBA, PFHxA, PFOA, and PFDA) concentration threshold in recycled paper packaging materials, associated with functional performance gains, ranged from 30 ppm for PFDA to 1238 ppm for PFBA.\n\nDue to the known use of polymeric PFAS in paper/paperboard food packaging, it is expected that PFAS will be detected in paper and paperboard food packaging on the retail market. For example, Schaider et al. (2017) found fluorine in 56% of dessert and bread wrappers, 38% of burger-contact papers (at levels of 60 ppm), and 20% of paperboard samples (average of 14 ppm) when sampling fast food packaging in larger cities in the United States. According to Trier et al. (2011), the surface coating of treated paper and board yielded concentrations ranging from 1 ppm to 100 ppm of certain polyfluorinated surfactants, which can be precursors of PFAS, whereas adding PFAS to pulp yielded 600 ppm to 9000 ppm (or 0.06% to 0.9% of the paper weight). These levels are consistent with those reported by Xu et al. (2013a) for tested perfluoroalkyl acids and polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acids in food contact papers.\n\n2.2 Occurrence in retail foods\n\nPFAS have been reported at very low concentrations in various retail foods in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe (EFSA 2020; FSANZ 2021; Ostertag et al. 2009; Tittlemier et al. 2006, 2007; US FDA 2021a). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA; 2020) indicates that the source of PFAS detected in retail foods (for example, PFOS and LC-PFAS) appears to primarily be from PFAS that have bioaccumulated through aquatic and terrestrial food chains, not direct migration from FPMs. The Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ; 2017) also reports that PFSAs, PFCAs, and fluorotelomer sulphonates were not detected in various packaged foods in Australian supermarkets.\n\nIn collaboration with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada monitors the levels of PFAS in food. Tittlemier et al. (2007) reported that only 9 out of 54 composite samples (4 meat-containing, 3 fish and shellfish, 1 fast food, and 1 microwave popcorn) from the Canadian Total Diet Study (TDS) between 1992 and 2004 contained detectable levels of perfluorinated compounds. PFOS and PFOA were detected the most frequently (in all 9 composites), with concentrations ranging from 0.5 ppb to 4.5 ppb. Among this small data set, the consumption of beef contributed to more than 80% of the average total dietary PFAS exposure (that is, total PFCA and PFOS).\n\nTittlemier et al. (2006) analyzed 151 TDS composite food samples from 1992 to 2004 for a series of perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides (FASA) including perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA) and a number of N-alkyl perfluorooctanesulfonamides, namely N-ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamide, N,N-diethylperfluorooctanesulfonamide, N-methylperfluorooctanesulfonamide, and N,N-dimethylperfluorooctanesulfonamide. At least one FASA was detected in a sample from each of the food groups tested (baked goods and candy, dairy, eggs, fast food, fish, meat, and foods to be prepared in packaging). The highest concentrations of the sum of FASA compounds analyzed in this study were found in fast food composites, ranging from less than the limits of detection (LOD) to 27.3 ppb.\n\nOstertag et al. (2009) reported the detection of 6:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylate (in cold cuts at 1.26 ppb), PFHpA (in cookies, cheese, pizza, and frozen beef dinner at ≤0.59 ppb), PFOA (in cookies, cheese, peppers, canned lunchmeats, and pizza at ≤0.77 ppb), PFNA (in cold cuts and cookies at ≤3.75 ppb), PFDA (in peppers at 1.02 ppb), and PFOS (in cheese at ≤1.14 ppb) in samples collected in 1998 from stores and restaurants in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada.\n\nThe CFIA has conducted targeted surveys for PFOS and PFOA in various foods (root vegetables, potato products, seafood products, frozen vegetables, flour and cereals) sampled from 2013 to 2016. None of the more than 3200 food samples had levels of PFOS or PFOA above the LOD of 0.25 ng/g (data are not publicly available).\n\nIn a 2020 assessment, the EFSA noted that more than 90% of the results for PFAS in foods analyzed as part of European dietary surveys, conducted from 2000 to 2016, were below the limit of quantification (LOQ) or LOD. In the surveys assessed by EFSA (2020), high concentrations (95th percentile >10 ppb) of PFAS were reported in edible offal from game animals and a number of fish species. According to EFSA, 4 PFAS (PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, and PFOS) contributed a median of 46% (range of 33% to 56%) to the sum of all adult dietary exposures to PFAS. The relative median contributions were 9%, 2%, 4%, and 30% for PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, and PFOS, respectively. Other PFAS that contributed more than 5% were PFBA (16%) and PFHxA (15%). According to EFSA (2020), concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in food appear to be decreasing.\n\nFood Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ 2021) report that of the 30 PFAS analyzed in their 27th Australian Total Diet Study (covering years 2019–2020), PFOS was the only congener found to have detectable concentrations in the regional and national food samples analyzed. PFOS was detected in eggs, fish fillets (saltwater), liver or other offal (non-poultry), prawns (cooked), and canned tuna. PFOS was most frequently detected in liver or other offal at concentrations ranging from <0.05 ppb to 5.5 ppb. All other concentrations of PFOS detected were below 0.2 ppb. In the previous 24th Australian TDS (Phase 2, covering year 2011) of a smaller subset of food samples and analytes (that is, PFOA and PFOS only), FSANZ (2016a) reported that PFOS was only detected in 2 of 50 samples (that is, PFOS was detected in fish fillets and beef sausages at concentrations ≤1 ppb).\n\nThe US FDA has conducted analyses for PFAS in foods grown or produced in contaminated geographic areas as well as in foods from the general food supply (Genualdi et al. 2022; US FDA 2021a, 2022a; Young et al. 2012, 2013). PFAS occurrence data from the general food supply (US FDA 2021a) were obtained from the analysis of samples collected from the United States FDA’s TDS, which included a wide variety of foods such as fruits and vegetables, bread, meats, fish, dairy products, processed foods, and baby foods, as well as from targeted surveys on bottled water (2016), seafood (2013), and milk (2012). The US FDA analyzed 4 sets of TDS samples for 16 PFAS (PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFBS, PFPeS, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOS, ADONA, HFPO-DA, 11Cl-PF3OUdS, 6:2 Cl-PFESA [F53B]) and one set of TDS samples for 20 PFAS (PFUnDA, PFDoA, PFTrDA, and PFTeDA, in addition to the 16 PFAS analyzed in the other data sets; US FDA 2022b). In all 5 combined TDS data sets, only 10 of the 532 total samples analyzed had detectable levels of PFAS. PFOS was detected in ground turkey (85.7 ppt), tilapia (3 samples; 87, 83, and 28 ppt), pre-cooked shrimp (216 ppt), baked cod (98 ppt), protein powder (140 ppt), and frozen fish sticks/patties (33 ppt). PFNA was detected in samples of frozen fish stick/patties (50 ppt) and baked cod (2 samples; 233 ppt and 87 ppt). PFDA was detected in canned tuna (72 ppt) and baked cod (23 ppt). PFUnDA was detected in pre-cooked shrimp (233 ppt) and baked cod (151 ppt), and PFDoA was detected in pre-cooked shrimp (71 ppt). No other PFAS were detected in any other food sample from the TDS. The bottled water survey analyzed for PFOS and PFOA and none of the 30 samples had detectable levels of either PFAS (US FDA 2021a). In the seafood survey, 11 of 46 samples had detectable levels of at least one type of PFAS, and PFOS was the most widely detected (in 9 of 11 positives), with generally higher concentrations (0.97 ppb to 6.29 ppb) (Young et al. 2013). In the milk survey, 1 of 12 raw milk samples had detectable levels of PFAS, while none of the 49 retail milk samples did (Young et al. 2012). The lone sample with detectable PFAS (PFOS at 0.16 ppb) came from a dairy farm that had applied PFAS-containing biosolids to its fields. Although the United States FDA has not presented PFAS exposure estimates based on the above results, they have stated that these results do not suggest any need to avoid particular foods because of concerns regarding PFAS contamination (US FDA 2021b). The US FDA (2021b) has limited the assessment of human health risk to PFOA, PFNA, PFBS, PFHxS, and PFOS.\n\nThe US FDA also conducted a targeted survey in 2021–2022 for 20 PFAS in 8 types of seafood (primarily imported): tuna, salmon, tilapia, crab, shrimp, cod, pollock, and clam (US FDA 2022c). The US FDA determined that the levels of PFOA in the canned clam samples were likely a health concern. Subsequently, the two distributors of the canned clams in question initiated a voluntary product recall (US FDA 2022d).\n\nA study by Ruffle et al. (2020) analyzed 70 samples of fish and shellfish commercially available in the United States for 26 PFAS compounds. Up to 10 PFAS were detected in 21 samples, with PFOS as the predominant compound found. Total PFAS concentrations were generally single digit or sub-ppb level (0.6 to 4.4 ppb) except for fish from the Great Lakes area, with higher levels reported in whitefish, walleye, and yellow perch (1.2 ppb to 21.6 ppb).\n\nAlthough food-related PFAS occurrence data from Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the United States are growing, the scope of existing data is still limited compared with the number of PFAS included under this broad class. Notably, targeted analysis and quantification in the varied and complex matrices of food present methodological challenges. Due to analytical limitations associated with measuring substances in complex food matrices, much of the occurrence data show a very high frequency of non-detect concentrations (that is, below the LOD), rendering exposure estimates highly uncertain. EFSA (2020) recommended that improved analytical methods for a broader range of PFAS in a broader range of foods are needed in order to reduce the uncertainty in the dietary exposure assessment. In an effort to improve dietary exposure estimates, food research organizations, including the Food Research Division of Health Canada’s Food Directorate, continue to work to develop occurrence data in various food matrices (for example, fish, meat, fast foods) using methods that have recently been developed (Rawn et al. 2022a).\n\n2.3 Sites contaminated with aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF)\n\nPFAS-impacted contaminated sites where AFFF (aqueous film-forming foams) have been or are being used (for example, firefighting training areas) represent “hot spot” areas where the environment may be exposed to PFAS. In addition, Canadians can also be exposed to PFAS through various environmental media as a result of AFFF use. PFAS contamination may pose risks to human health and the environment not only at the contaminated site (that is, on-site), but also off-site due to the potential for significant migration in surface water and groundwater or by wind erosion or overspray of the AFFF product during use. PFAS have demonstrated the ability to travel long distances (greater than 2 km) in the subsurface (groundwater) and surface water, which can lead to a large area of impact from a single point source of PFAS (Bhavsar et al. 2016; CCME 2021a). An example of a contaminated site impacted by PFAS, an airport firefighting training area, is illustrated in the conceptual site model below in Figure 2 (HC 2021a). It highlights examples of potential human exposure pathways for a PFAS-impacted site as a result of historical AFFF use. Potential routes of exposure may include ingestion of impacted drinking water; consumption of country foods (for example, fish, berries, edible vegetation); and/or direct contact with soil, surface water, groundwater, sediment, and/or other environmental media.\n\nLong description\n\nThis figures shows an airport, where AFFF was previously used, and its surrounding environment. Environmentat fate and transportation pathways are illustrated to show how the PFAS may migrate from the airport site to the surrounding environment where human and environmental exposures can occur. The environmental fate and transport pathways include: surface run off; leaching to groundwater and subsurface transport; soil erosion/windblown dust and irrigation with PFAS impacted water. Environmental exposure includes: uptake of PFAS by fish, livestock, crops, and wildlife. Human health exposure pathways are shown which include: ingestion of drinking water from a well; contact with sediment and surface water; consumption of fish; ingestion of livestock and crops, contract with soil and consumption of wild game.\n\nFederal contaminated sites are located on land owned or leased by the federal government, or on land where the federal government has accepted responsibility for the contamination. There are over 100 federal contaminated sites with confirmed or suspected PFAS contamination. As shown in Figure 3, such sites exist in all provinces and territories. Most of these sites are associated with past and/or current use of AFFF, typically during activities associated with fighting fuel fires, including training activities and maintenance of firefighting equipment at airports and military facilities. Several PFAS (PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFBS, PFHxS, and PFOS) were detected in groundwater at former firefighting training areas in British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Ontario (Paterson et al. 2008; Environmental Sciences Group 2015). Other sources of PFAS at federal contaminated sites may include landfill leachate and land application of wastewater treatment biosolids, which are discussed in section 2.6. Many PFAS-impacted federal contaminated sites are located in areas where there is reliance on local resources (for example, consumption of drinking water from private groundwater wells, hunting, gathering, fishing, small-scale and/or commercial farming, gardening, and recreational activities).\n\nLong description\n\nThis figure is a map of Canada showing the locations of federal contaminated sites with confirmed or suspected PFAS contamination, as of April 2022. The maps shows 86 active sites, 22 suspected site and 5 closed sites. Active sites are present in all the provinces and territories of Canada. Note that site status (that is Suspected, Active, and Closed) is for the entire site and is not specific to PFAS contamination. From Western to Eastern Canada: The province of British Columbia has 16 sites, including 8 active and 8 suspected. The Yukon Territory has 1 active site. The province of Alberta has 8 sites including 4 active and 4 suspected. The Northwest Territories has 3 active sites. The province of Saskatchewan has 12 sites including 10 active, and 2 suspected. The territory of Nunavut has 4 active sites. The province of Manitoba has 8 sites including 6 active, 1 suspected and 1 closed. The province of Ontario has 15 sites including 14 active and 1 closed. The province of Quebec has 19 sites, including 17 active and 2 closed. The province of New Brunswick has 9 sites including 6 active, 2 suspected, and 1 closed. The province of Prince Edward Island has 2 active sites. The province of Nova Scotia has 10 sites including 8 active and 2 suspected. The province of Newfoundland and Labrador has 6 sites, including 4 active, and 2 suspected.\n\nNon-federal PFAS-contaminated sites also exist in Canada. For example, AFFF used in the oil and gas industry and by municipal firefighting departments may have resulted in the release of PFAS to the environment. Contamination on non-federal lands is dealt with by the province/territory and/or the local health authority (refer to section 8.1.4).\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, PFAS detected in groundwater or surface water at a contaminated site can be considered mobile and are likely migrating with the groundwater or surface water flow. Other plausible transport pathways for off-site migration of PFAS may also include (but are not limited to) the migration of impacted surface soils, sediment, dust, stormwater/snow melt runoff (depending on local topography), and/or migration of firefighting foam from historical site use (for example, overspray and wind transport).\n\nEnvironmental guidelines and screening values for PFAS have been developed (section 8.1.3). These are set as benchmarks below which the concentrations of PFAS are not expected to pose a human health and/or environmental concern. Accordingly, PFAS concentrations found in the environment can be compared to PFAS guidelines and screening values to assess their significance. While numerous PFAS are known to be in AFFF, guidelines and screening values are currently available for only a few select PFAS. Furthermore, the PFAS guidelines and screening values are only available for a limited number of environmental media and exposure pathways. Thus, the assessment of PFAS at AFFF-contaminated sites may underestimate potential health and environmental concerns, as discussed in section 8.1.4.\n\nSection 6.1 discusses plant uptake of PFAS and bioaccumulation in animals. Based on the findings of a 2018 literature review, fish and shellfish consumption were found to be the primary route of human exposure to PFOS and, to a lesser extent, PFOA (Intrinsik 2018). However, there is limited information regarding the uptake of PFAS from various environmental media by fish, shellfish, and mammals due to the variability and uncertainty inherent in the data, which is attributable to several different factors, including kinetics, ecology, region, tissues, and species differences. At this time, the available information does not support the use of generic PFAS uptake models (that is, models used to predict PFAS uptake from environmental media into food sources) for assessing risks to human health at contaminated sites.\n\nHealth Canada commissioned a literature review of available information concerning the uptake of PFAS by plants and wildlife (Intrinsik, 2018). Based on the findings of this review and more recent work in this area, there is still insufficient data to support modelling PFAS uptake from soil or irrigation water into food sources (crops, livestock, and country foods). At contaminated sites where the consumption of country foods or agricultural operations are occurring, Health Canada’s current recommendation is to conduct sampling of the edible portions of the plant or animal for PFAS analysis in order to accurately characterize exposure and assess potential risks.\n\n2.4 Drinking water\n\nPFAS may be present in both private drinking water wells and public drinking water supplies. No published data were found on the levels of PFAS in private wells in Canada. Because PFAS are not regularly monitored at water treatment plants in Canada, there is only limited data available for municipally supplied drinking water. In 2022, the validated and standardized analytical methods available for the quantitation of PFAS in drinking water measure a combined total of 29 compounds; although many other PFAS may be present, they cannot be measured. However, new methods that will measure a greater number of compounds are under development in many countries. In 2009–2010, Health Canada conducted a national survey of emerging contaminants in drinking water that included PFHxA, PFOA, PFNA, PFBS, PFHxS, and PFOS (Health Canada 2013b). Source and treated water from groundwater and surface water sources (rivers and lakes) were monitored across Canada in summer and winter at 35 locations in 2009 and 30 locations in 2010. Overall, PFOA was the most frequently detected of the 6 PFAS. In 2009, PFOA was detected (method detection limit [MDL] of 0.02 ng/L) in 68% (summer; average 0.067 ng/L) and 59% (winter; average 0.057 ng/L) of source water samples and 64% (summer; average 0.071 ng/L) and 55% (winter; average 0.056 ng/L) of treated water samples. In 2010, detection rates for PFOA were lower: 18% to 33% in source water (average 0.066 ng/L) and 15% to 27% in treated water (average 0.055 ng/L) (Health Canada 2013b). The maximum PFOA values detected were 0.22 ng/L in source water samples and 0.18 ng/L in treated water samples. PFHxA (MDL 0.05 ng/L) was detected in 40% of winter 2009 samples (average 16 ng/L) and 25% of winter 2010 samples (average 17 ng/L). Summer detections were less frequent at 15% (average 0.10 ng/L) and 3% (average 14 ng/L) in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The other 4 PFAS, including PFOS, were rarely detected despite low method detection limits of 0.03 ng/L to 0.15 ng/L (Health Canada 2013b).\n\nAt 7 sites in Quebec, source and treated water samples were collected monthly between April 2007 and March 2008. PFOA was detected in 75% of treated water samples (MDL of 0.3 ng/L to 0.6 ng/L), with a median value of 2.5 ng/L and a maximum value of 98.0 ng/L. PFOS was detected in 52% of treated samples (MDL of 0.3 ng/L to 0.6 ng/L), with a median value of 1.0 ng/L (maximum value of 3.0 ng/L). PFNA and PFUDA were also detected in some samples (Berryman et al. 2012).\n\nBetween 2016 and 2021, samples were collected from 41 drinking water treatment systems in Quebec and tested for 18 PFAS (PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUndA, PFBS, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOS, PFDS, FHUEA, FOUEA, 4:2 FTS, 6:2 FTS, 8:2 FTS). Both surface and groundwater systems were sampled, with the latter being added in 2018 (MELCC 2022). Detection limits ranged from 0.5 ng/L to 5 ng/L for raw water samples and from 0.3 ng/L to 5 ng/L for treated water samples. Among the 18 PFAS analyzed, 6 (PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, and PFOS) were detected in 10% or more of the samples taken. The 2016 data showed a reduction in the maximum concentrations of PFOA and PFOS (6 ng/L and 3 ng/L, respectively) when compared with the maximum surface water concentrations from the same sites sampled in 2007–2008 (66 ng/L for PFOA and 8.8 ng/L for PFOS). In the St. Lawrence River and other rivers, 5 substances (PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, and PFOS) were detected in at least 30% of the samples. PFOA and PFHxA were detected at the highest frequency (72% and 59%, respectively); both had a maximum concentration of 6 ng /L. In Lac Memphrémagog, PFOA (2 ng/L) and PFHxA (3 ng/L) were detected in raw water; both were detected in treated drinking water at 1 ng/L each. In groundwater sources, PFPeA (max.: 48 ng/L) and PFHxA (max.: 30 ng/L) were found in 14% and 17% of samples, respectively, while PFOA (max.: 4 ng/L) and PFOS (max.: 3 ng/L) were found in 6% and 4% of samples (MELCC 2022).\n\nA study of tap water samples from Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, found an arithmetic mean (5 samples) of 2.1 ng/L for PFOA and 3.3 ng/L for PFOS and detected PFBA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, PFEtS, PFOSA, and PFPeA (Mak et al. 2009). In 2016 to 2019, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks measured the occurrence and concentrations of 14 PFAS (PFBS, PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFDoDA, PFHxS, PFOS, PFDS, and PFOSA) in 25 drinking water systems in Ontario (Kleywegt et al. 2020). Method detection limits (MDL) ranged from 0.5 ng/L to 1 ng/L, and results less than the MDL were substituted with a value of half of the MDL. PFUnDA, PFDoDA, PFDS, and PFOSA were not detected in either the source water or treated drinking water samples. The most frequently detected compounds in Ontario drinking water were PFOA (73%; median 1.1 ng/L), PFBA (67%; median 2.4 ng/L), PFHxA (54%; median 1.3 ng/L), PFPeA (51%; median 1.0 ng/L), and PFOS (50%; 0.63 ng/L). In 2017 and 2018, additional screening level analyses of PFAS on 635 drinking water samples from 13 systems in Ontario did not detect individual PFAS compounds in any samples using a screening level detection limit of 10 ng/L (Kleywegt et al. 2020).\n\nSimilar median concentrations of PFOA, PFBA, PFHxA, PFPeA, and PFOS were reported in samples of drinking water sourced from 19 sites around Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River (n=8) and other lakes and small rivers in Canada (n=11). Concentrations of PFAS ranged from 1.0 ng/L (PFPeA) to 3.5 ng/L (PFOS). These values were similar to those found in tap water samples collected between February 2015 and June 2015 in Canadian cities. Other PFAS that were frequently detected included PFBA (95%) and PFHxS and PFOS (both 89%), while PFPeA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, and PFBS were detected in at least 84% of the samples. Compounds detected less frequently in Canadian waters included FOSA (53%), 6:2 FTSA (37%), and 5:3 FTCA (11%) as well as PFUnDA, PFDoDA, and 7:3 FTCA, which were each detected in less than 10% of samples. A qualitative screening approach indicated that FBSA, FHxSA, PFECHS, and PFPeS were occasionally present in tap water (concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection to 1.2 ng/L), whereas PFEtS, PFPrS, and PFPeS were below the limit of detection for all Canadian samples. The limits of detection for tap water ranged from 0.01 ng/L to 0.08 ng/L ( Kaboré et al. 2018).\n\n2.5 Indoor air and dust\n\nPFAS compounds have been measured in indoor air and dust in residential and non-residential environments (for example, childcare facilities, fire stations) in Canada and other countries (for example, US, Ireland, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, and China) (de la Torre et al. 2019; Haug et al. 2011; Harrad et al. 2019; Winkens et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2020; Yao et al. 2018; Zheng et al. 2020). These studies were mostly conducted on a regional scale and reported approximately 70 PFAS in total. Sources of PFAS in indoor environments include rugs and carpets, treated floor waxes and stone/wood, food packaging, cosmetics, building materials, furnishings, paper products, clothing, insecticides, and electronics (Morales-McDevitt et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2015; Savvaides et al. 2021).\n\nIn Canada, 4 studies examined the airborne PFAS concentrations in 271 residential homes in 3 cities (Ottawa, Vancouver, Edmonton) from 2002 to 2008 (Beesoon et al. 2012; Makey et al. 2017; Shoeib et al. 2005, 2011). Overall, the data suggest that FTOHs (8:2, 6:2, and 10:2 FTOH), followed by the FOSAs (MeFOSA, EtFOSA), and FOSEs (MeFOSE, EtFOSE) appear to be the most prominent in the air samples collected from Canadian homes.\n\nFor PFAS in dust, 6 studies measured PFAS concentrations in household dust in 308 Canadian homes in 3 cities (Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver) from 2002 to 2015 (De Silva et al. 2012; Eriksson and Kärrman 2015; Karaskova et al. 2016; Kubwabo et al. 2005; Shoeib et al. 2005, 2011). When comparing exposure through inhalation and ingestion of dust, inhalation was identified as the primary exposure pathway for neutral and ionic PFAS for adults, whereas for toddlers, intake via dust ingestion is more relevant due to the higher frequency of hand-to-mouth activities (Shoeib et al. 2005, 2011). The most abundant PFAS in indoor dust were diPAPs, PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFDS, PFHxS, PFDoDA, MeFOSE, EtFOSE, MeFOSA, EtFOSA, 6:2 FTOH, 8:2 FTOH, and 10:2 FTOH. For diPAPs, the dominating homologues were 6:2 diPAP, 6:2/8:2 diPAP, 8:2 diPAP, 8:2/12:2 diPAP, and 10:2 diPAP (De Silva et al. 2012; Eriksson and Kärrman 2015).\n\n2.6 Waste/end of product life\n\nPFAS are present in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products. The expected fate of these products is that they will be disposed of in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfills or destined for MSW incineration.\n\n2.6.1 Landfills\n\nThe disposal of products and materials that contain PFAS, including PFAS-contaminated soils and biosolids, into landfills can become an indirect pathway of release to the environment. PFAS may leach out of these products and materials and accumulate in landfill leachate and eventually be released to the environment, even if that leachate is sent to a wastewater treatment system. Other solid waste facilities, such as composting facilities, scrapyards, and recycling facilities, may also be a source of release to the environment. The responsibilities of waste management in Canada are discussed in section 8.1.5. Concentrations of PFAS in landfill leachate are discussed in section 4.2.3.\n\nMost of the monitored landfills discharge untreated leachate to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Approximately 87% of the leachate generated by large landfills in Canada (permitted to receive more than 40 000 tonnes of municipal solid waste per year) is directed to municipal WWTPs and 7.1% is treated on site prior to release. The remainder of leachate generated (approximately 5.5%), typically from small, unengineered landfills that have limited environmental controls, is released directly into the environment via groundwater or surface water without treatment.\n\nMSW landfills are a known source of groundwater contamination, with leachate-impacted plumes that may extend greater than 1 km (Christensen et al. 2001). Many types of contaminants of emerging concern, including PFAS, have been found in the leachate of operating and closed municipal landfills and are described in section 4.2.3.\n\nWith respect to releases to air from landfills, monitoring data show that PFAS are dry deposited in areas downwind of landfills, which indicates that fugitive and point-source emissions could be sources. Flaring of landfill gas (LFG) is believed to incompletely destroy PFAS. Tian et al. (2018) directly measured PFAS content in landfill gas in China and found that concentrations ranged from 650 pg/m3 to 850 pg/m3 of LFG.\n\n2.6.2 Incineration\n\nPFAS may not fully degrade from incineration at temperatures below 1000oC, which may result in the formation of other volatile fluorinated compounds. Data suggest that temperatures of 1000oC and above, such as those found in MSW incinerators, are sufficient to destroy (that is, mineralize) the most resistant of fluorinated compounds; however, further data is needed regarding the optimal residence times for sufficient and/or complete destruction of PFAS, including the breakdown of the highly stable –CF2– moieties, while avoiding the formation of other compounds (Yamada et al. 2005).\n\nDue to the wide variety of products that contain these substances, it is reasonable to assume that the fraction of PFAS that is incinerated is equal to the total fraction of waste incinerated in Canada. A 2012 study by Cheminfo Services Inc. indicated that the percentage of MSW being disposed of in landfills in Canada (for 2008) was 96%, while 4% was disposed of through incineration. Since this figure is likely representative of current data, it can be assumed that 4% of PFAS are incinerated, while the remaining 96% are sent to landfills where they are potentially released to the environment (Cheminfo Services Inc. 2012).\n\n2.6.3 Compost\n\nPFAS persist when composted, may accumulate in the soil, and may be taken up by certain crops (see section 6.1) as well as the natural food chain. Compost made from PFAS-containing single-use paper products or food waste are expected to be contaminated with PFAS.\n\nA study by Lazcano et al. (2020) found 17 PFAS, including PFOA and PFOS, to be present in 13 commercially available biosolid-based products, 6 organic composts (manure, mushroom, peat, and untreated wood), and 1 food and yard waste compost. Biosolid-based products had concentrations of PFAS ranging from 9 to 199 micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg, ppb), while composts made from various combinations of food scraps, yard trimmings, and other organic products had PFAS concentrations between 0.1 µg/kg and 18.5 µg/kg.\n\n2.6.4 Wastewater treatment systems and biosolids\n\nMunicipal wastewater treatment systems act as pathways of PFAS to aquatic environments through the discharge of treated effluent, and to the terrestrial environment when biosolids are applied to land as soil amendments. Both pathways can subsequently impact groundwater, for example, through riverbank filtration and soil water infiltration, respectively. ECCC’s National Wastewater Monitoring Program gathers data on levels of PFAS entering municipal WWTPs, evaluates the fate of PFAS through the liquid and solids trains of typical treatment process types used in Canada, and determines levels of PFAS being discharged in WWTP effluents and solids residuals. These are described in section 4.2.4. On-site wastewater treatment (that is, septic systems) releases liquid effluent via a subsurface drain field, while biosolids from septic holding tanks can also be land-applied; both pathways havethe potential to impact groundwater.\n\nMany PFAS have been measured in WWTP influent and effluent (Guerra et al. 2014; Lenka et al. 2021), septic system effluent (Subedi et al. 2015), and WWTP biosolids (EFSA 2020; Lakshminarasimman et al. 2021). PFAAs can also be formed during wastewater treatment, likely as a result of the transformation of unmeasured precursors entering WWTPs (Guerra et al. 2014). The amount of PFAAs formed is dependent on process temperature and treatment type, with higher rates of formation in biological WWTPs operating at higher hydraulic retention times and temperatures (Guerra et al. 2014). In addition, concentrations of some PFAAs are higher in final stabilized biosolids than in raw sludge at some WWTPs, likely due to the transformation of unmeasured precursors during biosolids treatment (Lakshminarasimman et al. 2021). Concentrations of both PFOS and PFOA may increase during biological treatment processes due to the incomplete transformation of their precursors (Sinclair and Kannan 2006; Guerra et al. 2014; Lenka et al. 2021). Transformation of PFAS is described in section 3.2.3.\n\nPFAS can be taken up by plants grown in agricultural fields, with accumulation dependent on soil concentrations, chain length of the PFAS, functional group, plant species and variety, and soil and applied biosolids characteristics (Ghisi et al. 2019) (see section 6.1). EFSA (2020) reported that PFBS, PFHpA, and PFBA have been shown to be available to plants via the root system with reported uptake into pea shoots and/or celery grown in soil amended with biosolids; however, as noted in section 2.2, concentrations of PFAS in retail foods tend to be below the LOD.\n\n2.7 Substitution trends\n\nKey substitutions observed with respect to fluorosurfactants have included the move to C6-based fluorotelomer substances from variable chain length LC-PFCA precursors, and the use of PFBS-based products as PFOS replacements (ACC 2022; 3M 2002). Polyfluorinated ether acid surfactants, such as ADONA and GenX, have also been substituted for the use of PFOA as a fluoropolymer processing aid (ITRC 2020b).\n\nA retrospective analysis of substances notified for import to or manufacture in Canada under the NSNR highlights when substitutions have occurred over the years and illustrate how industry is acting to substitute hazardous substances (also known as informed substitution). New Substances Notifications may provide insight into new substances being introduced as potential substitutes. The Government of Canada may use other methods (for example, CEPA section 71 surveys) to obtain new use information that may indicate substitutions and prioritize substance(s) for assessment.\n\nFollowing the prohibitions put in place on 4 new fluorotelomer-based substances (PFCA precursors) in 2004, no further perfluoroalkyl substances with carbon chain lengths equal to or greater than C8 were notified under the NSNR (Figure 4). This could indicate that industry had already transitioned to replace those substances by the time the Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids (PFCAs) and Precursors: An Action Plan for Assessment and Management and the PCTSR amendments were published in 2006 and 2016, respectively. Substitution for these substances was observed through an increase in notifications of short-chain PFAS.\n\nLong description\n\nThis figure is a bar graph which shows the annual quantities imported and/or manufactured in Canada (in kilograms per year) of new PFAS (chemicals and polymers) notified to the New Substances Program by importers and manufacturers, since 1994. On the y axis is the total annual quantity imported or manufactured in Canada (in kilograms per year), ranging from 0 to 1,200,000 kilograms per year. On the x axis is the year the New Substances Notification was provided to the New Substances Program, ranging from 1994 to 2021. Each year shows the total import and manufacture quantities of all short-chain PFAS notified that year and all long-chain PFAS notified that year. Orange bars show annual quantities notified for PFAS which have alkyl fluorinated chain lengths of less than eight carbons, which are considered short-chain PFAS. Blue bars show PFAS which have chain lengths of eight or greater carbons, which is considered long-chain PFAS. Long-chain PFAS were notified to the New Substances Program from 1994 to 2004, but not thereafter. Short-chain PFAS have consistently been notified at several-fold higher volumes than long-chain PFAS. Close to one million kilograms per year of combined PFAS was notified in 1997, 2001, 2002, 2011, and 2012. No obvious trend in quantities of short-chain PFAS was evident, either before or after 2004, which marks the end of long-chain PFAS notification. For reference, key milestones in government action on PFAS are indicated with green dotted lines: 2004 – New Substances Prohibitions of four PFAS polymers; 2006 – PFCA Action Plan; 2009 - PFOS added to the virtual elimination list; 2012 – Coming into force of the Prohibition Regulations; 2013 – C9-C20 LC-PFCAs added to Schedule 1; 2016 – PFOA, LC-PFCAs prohibited (with exceptions). The graph shows that new long-chain PFAS were not notified after 2004, and new short-chain PFAS (i.e. PFAS alkyl chain length less than eight carbons) are continually notified in Canada, in high quantities.\n\nWhen a new substance is notified under the NSNR, the importer or manufacturer must indicate the expected quantity of substance to be imported into or manufactured in Canada. These values are provided for the year of notification and, when known, the maximum amount in a 12-month period in the next 3 years. Apart from the quantities notified for blowing agents and refrigerants, which tend to be high in certain years, the quantities of new chemical and polymeric PFAS notified under the NSNR are generally equal and relatively constant at roughly 10 000 kg/year to 30 000 kg/year for new PFAS being imported into or manufactured in Canada.\n\n3. Key characteristics and environmental behaviour\n\nKey points on environmental behaviour\n\nThe physical and chemical properties of PFAS influence their fate and behaviour in the environment.\n\nIonic PFAS (that is, predominantly ionized at environmental pH) such as PFCAs and PFSAs are highly water-soluble and non-volatile, and thus partition predominantly to water where they can mobilize.\n\nNeutral PFAS such as FTOHs may be volatile and thus are more likely to be found in the atmosphere.\n\nFTOHs, as well as other polyfluoroalkyl substances and some side-chain fluorinated polymers, can undergo transformation to form more stable PFAS that are extremely persistent in the environment under ambient conditions.\n\nSome shorter-chain PFAS have proven to be even more mobile on a local scale than longer chain PFAS.\n\nSome PFAS are also capable of undergoing long-range transport in the atmosphere (that is, for neutral, volatile PFAS) or in global ocean currents (that is, for ionic PFAS), as can be seen by their widespread distribution around the world, including to remote regions.\n\nExperience with PFAS-contaminated sites has shown that remediation and management of these sites are very challenging and complex, and the removal of PFAS from the environment is not possible.\n\nThe purpose of this section is to summarize the key physical/chemical and fate properties of PFAS. The concept of PFAS precursor substances (PFAS that are capable of transforming into simpler environmentally stable PFAS, for example, PFAAs), is also discussed. The general properties of these PFAS contribute to their environmental partitioning, persistence, mobility, and long-range environmental transport characteristics.\n\nFluorine has high electronegativity, low polarizability, and a small atomic radius. The combined effect produces a strong carbon-fluorine bond (about 108–120 kcal/mol), making it extremely stable. Fluorocarbon chemistry is resistant to heat and biological and chemical attack. With low surface energy and weak intermolecular interactions, it is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. It is these characteristics that provide desirable performance in many applications where surface protection, chemical resistance, thermal stability, and non-stick properties are sought.\n\nComplex PFAS molecules, such as side-chain perfluoroalkyl polymers or sulfonamidoethanol compounds, contain the persistent PFAS moiety, although other portions of the molecule may undergo transformation and liberate a stable PFAS acid. Complex PFAS that can yield simpler persistent PFAS are referred to as precursor substances. In the case of fluoropolymers, it has been argued that the various stages of their life cycle must be taken into account when considering potential impacts to the environment and human health, including PFAS processing aids used in their production, the presence of monomers/oligomers in products, and end-of-life issues such as fate in landfills and during incineration (Lohmann et al. 2020).\n\nAlthough the precursor substances may exhibit a range of physical/chemical properties dependent in part on the non-fluorinated parts of the molecule, the simpler PFAS have physical/chemical properties that result in fate characteristics that are well understood. These properties will be highlighted in section 3.1.\n\n3.1 Select physical and chemical properties\n\nWater solubility: Various estimates for the pKa (that is, acid dissociation constant) of PFOA have been generated (for example, Brace 1962; Goss et al. 2008; Steinle-Darling and Reinhard 2008; Vierke et al. 2013), though the actual value is believed to be within the range of 1 to 2. Consequently, PFOA is predominantly found in the environment in the form of its conjugate base, the perfluorooctanoate anion. The water solubility of this conjugate base is 3.5 g/L at 20°C (EC, HC 2012). Similarly, the PFOS conjugate base anion, perfluorooctane sulfonate, is the most common form at pH values in the environment and human body. The water solubility for the potassium salt of PFOS is reported as being 519 mg/L to 680 mg/L (EC 2006). Liu and Lee (2005, 2007) reported water solubilities of 974, 18.8, 0.224 and 0.011 mg/L at 22°C for 4:2, 6:2, 8:2, and 10:2 FTOH, respectively. A review by Ding and Peijnenburg (2013) reported experimentally determined water solubilities for select PFAS ranging from 0.011 mg/L to 5.66 × 104 mg/L.\n\nWith a hydrophobic and lipophobic fluorocarbon tail and a polarized head, these acids exhibit surfactant behaviour and can aggregate in micelles above the critical micelle concentration.\n\nLogKow: Because PFAS acids behave as surfactants, the octanol/water partition coefficient (LogKow) values are difficult to determine experimentally since the molecules aggregate at the octanol/water interface. Many reported LogKow values are calculated for the neutral form of the molecules. As the neutral form is not present under normal environmental conditions, these values are of limited use in describing their environmental fate or bioaccumulation potential.\n\nLogKoc: For PFAS acids, the values for the organic carbon-water adsorption/desorption coefficient are in part dependent upon the length of the fluorocarbon chain. Shorter-chain PFAS acids tend to have lower LogKoc values, indicating a greater affinity for water, while longer-chain PFAS acids may partition preferentially to soil and sediments. For these reasons, shorter-chain PFAS have greater mobility via groundwater.\n\nVapour pressure and Henry’s law constant: The vapour pressure of the PFOS potassium salt is 3.31 × 10-4 Pa at 20°C and its Henry’s law constant is 3.45 × 10-4 Pa m3/mol (EC 2006), indicating a low likelihood to partition to and be transported by air. For the acid form of PFOA, the calculated vapour pressure and Henry’s law constant are 2.2 Pa and 2.4 Pa m3/mol, respectively, indicating a low likelihood of atmospheric transport (EC, HC 2012).\n\nWhile the acids themselves are not susceptible to atmospheric transport, volatile precursor substances contribute to environmental transport. For example, although PFOS has low volatility, several PFOS precursors are considered volatile, such as N-EtFOSE alcohol, which has a vapour pressure of 0.5 Pa and Henry’s law constant of 1930 Pa m3/mol. When present in products or used in industrial processes, volatile PFAS precursors can volatize into the atmosphere and travel long distances before transforming into non-volatile forms such as PFAAs. These volatile precursors contribute to the widespread environmental occurrence of PFAS, including in remote areas such as the Arctic (Muir et al. 2019).\n\nFluorotelomer alcohols are precursors to perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs, which include PFOA). Vapour pressures of C6-C12 FTOHs range from 144 Pa to 992 Pa at 25oC (Stock et al. 2004), with the Henry’s law constant for 8:2 FTOH estimated at 3506 Pa m3/mol (Xie et al. 2013). These volatile precursors are globally distributed and also subject to transformation to PFCAs through reaction with hydroxyl radicals (Ellis et al. 2004), contributing to the wide dispersion of the resulting acids.\n\n3.2 Environmental fate and behaviour\n\nThe environmental fate and behaviour of PFAS describes what happens to these substances when they are released into the environment. The behaviour of these substances in the environment can be influenced by their physical and chemical properties, which can vary between different PFAS. This section examines the fate and distribution of PFAS in various media, their persistence, and transport of these substances within and between media, including long-range environmental transport. Focus is given to PFAS that are well studied in terms of their environmental fate and behaviour. Some emerging PFAS (for example, PFPAs, PFPiAs, PAPs) are much less understood in terms of their environmental fate (Guo et al. 2020); therefore, these PFAS are not discussed in detail in this section.\n\n3.2.1 Environmental fate\n\nAs a result of the fluorinated alkyl tail and polar head group of ionic PFAS (that is, predominantly ionized at environmental pH, such as PFAAs), the partitioning properties and electrostatic interactions of ionic PFAS can dictate their partitioning and distribution in the environment. Because of their hydrophilic head, PFAAs can exhibit high water solubility, which can allow the chemical to interact and disperse in water. This, combined with a negligible vapour pressure, explains why PFAAs primarily partition to surface waters, soil water, and groundwater (Prevedouros et al. 2006). PFAAs also tend to accumulate at the air-water interface as a result of their surfactant-like properties (that is, their hydrophilic head group dissolves in water, while their hydrophobic tail orients itself to the air; Costanza et al. 2019), leading to retention in the unsaturated zone. Moreover, transport to the deep ocean and sediment burial are considered to be environmental sinks for PFAAs, given that they have a very long residence time in the environment (Prevedouros et al. 2006).\n\nThe organic carbon content in soil and sediment and alkyl chain length are strongly correlated to the sorption of many PFAS, which demonstrates the importance of hydrophobic interactions (Higgins and Luthy 2006; Liu and Lee 2005). In general, sorption to organic carbon increases with fluoroalkyl chain length in the ionic, non-volatile PFAS. Zhao et al. (2016) examined the distribution of PFAS in a river and found that short-chain PFAAs were predominantly found in water, whereas the long-chain PFAAs were present in suspended particulate matter and sediment. A study of sediment cores by Ahrens et al. (2009) also determined that short-chain PFCAs were only found in pore water, whereas longer-chain PFCAs (C ≥ 11) were exclusively found in sediment. Moreover, partitioning and sorption is dependent on the properties of the functional groups present (ITRC 2020a). At a pH of above 3, most PFAAs exist in the anionic state in the environment; PFAAs in the environment therefore tend to repel negatively charged natural soils and sorb to positively charged minerals. For example, Higgins and Luthy (2006) determined that sorption of perfluoroalkyl substances (for example, PFCAs, PFSAs, FASAs) to sediment increased at higher Ca2+ concentrations. However, differences have been noted in the sorption of PFAAs dependingon their functional groups, such as PFPAs which tend to be more sorptive than PFCAs at equal chain lengths in soil (ECHA 2022b; Lee and Mabury 2017). Sorption of cationic and zwitterionic PFAS to soil and sediment have been far less investigated in comparison with anionic PFAS species; however, recent studies have shown that cationic and zwitterionic PFAS sorb more strongly to soil and sediment than do anionic PFAS because of their electrostatic interactions (Barzen-Hanson et al. 2017; Nickerson et al. 2021; Xiao et al. 2019). It is important to note that trends in sorption potential (that is, chain length and functional group) evidenced by different PFAS do not indicate that there is no sorption occurring with some PFAS but rather that sorption may occur to a lesser extent compared with more strongly sorbing PFAS.\n\nIonic PFAS are not commonly found in air because of their high solubility in water, low vapour pressure, and low Henry’s law constant. In their anionic, less volatile form, PFAAs can adsorb to airborne particulate matter (ITRC 2021a). Moreover, other neutral PFAS (for example, fluorotelomer-based substances) may have a greater volatility due to the functional groups that they possess (for example, alcohols) and may therefore be more likely to be found in the atmosphere.\n\n3.2.2 Persistence\n\nBroadly speaking, PFAS are extremely persistent in the environment (that is, long half-livesFootnote 2) as fluorocarbon moieties (fundamentally –CF2-) are very stable with resistance to biodegradation, hydrolysis, photolysis, and thermolysis. The vast majority of these so-called “forever chemicals” are non-degradable or, in cases where these transformation mechanisms may act upon other parts of more complex PFAS molecules, the stable PFAS transformation products are environmentally persistent (Cousins et al. 2020a). This extreme persistence of PFAS is due to their carbon-fluorine bonds, which, as previously described, are the strongest carbon-halogen bonds in nature. The carbon-fluorine bond contributes to the low polarizability and high bond energies of PFAS, which increase as the degree of fluorination increases.\n\nMost of the current persistence data have focused on a select number of well-studied PFAS. As such, the information presented in this section is focused on PFOS and PFOA; however, it is believed that the vast majority of PFAS are highly persistent (Cousins et al. 2020a, 2020b), and substances of the same PFAS subgroup can be considered to be equally persistent (ECHA 2022b).\n\nFor PFOS, half-lives in water were determined to be >41 years via hydrolysis, estimated by varying pH from 1.5 to 11.0 and at a temperature of 50°C to facilitate hydrolysis (Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants 2006). No biodegradation has been found in studies of PFOS in activated sewage sludge, sediment cultures, and soil cultures. Moreover, PFOA is not expected to significantly photodegrade under environmental conditions, undergo significant biotic or abiotic degradation, or hydrolyze (EC, HC 2012). PFOA was also determined to have a half-life of about 235 years in water via hydrolysis (3M 2001, as cited in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants 2016). Although there are a limited number of studies from the literature, it is expected that PFECAs and PFESAs (alternatives to long-chain PFAAs) are likely to be highly persistent in the environment (Wang et al. 2015a). As will be discussed in further detail in section 3.2.3, some PFAS are capable of releasing PFAAs into the environment upon transformation; however, this process may be slow for some precursors under abiotic conditions. Washington and Jenkins (2015) tested the abiotic hydrolysis of a commercial acrylate fluorotelomer-based polymer, which yielded half-lives ranging from 55 to 89 years. The current data suggest that many PFAS will remain in the environment for long periods, with the result being that they can reach significantly higher concentrations in comparison with short-lived chemicals released in the same quantities (Cousins et al. 2019).\n\n3.2.3 Transformation\n\nPolyfluoroalkyl substances (for example, fluorotelomers, polyfluoroalkyl ethers, perfluoroalkane sulfonamides) and some side-chain fluorinated polymers (for example, fluorinated urethane polymers, fluorinated acrylate/methacrylate polymers, fluorinated oxetane polymers) can be considered to be “precursors” and undergo abiotic or biotic transformation to form more stable perfluoroalkyl transformation products that do not degrade under ambient environmental conditions (Buck et al. 2011). This can occur as a result of the nonfluorinated bond(s) (for example, carbon-hydrogen, carbon-oxygen) in the structure of these polyfluoroalkyl substances and side-chain fluorinated polymers, which can create a “weak” point in the chemical structure that can be broken to release a perfluorinated alkyl moiety (ITRC 2021a). Studies have shown that fluorotelomer-based substances can undergo atmospheric oxidation (Ellis et al. 2004; Wallington et al. 2006) and aerobic transformation (D’Agostino and"
