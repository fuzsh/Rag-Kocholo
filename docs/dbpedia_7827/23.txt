Mann, Herbie (originally, Solomon, Herbert Jay), flutist, bass clarinetist, tenor saxophonist; b. N.Y., April 16, 1930. Mann may have been the first jazz musician to succeed by playing the flute exclusively. He studied at the Manhattan School of Music. His flute playing is much more diatonic than typical modern jazz, perhaps to fit in with the Latin and modal world music contexts he so often uses. He has also pioneered the use of jazz with such unusual world musics as gagaku from Japan.

Mann began to specialize in flute and Latin music around 1959. With Doc Cheatham, he toured Africa, returning to N.Y. in April 1960. His touring band at the time included noted Latin musicians such as Patato Valdes. He began to investigate and record bossa-nova music in 1961 and had his first hit single and album in 1962.

Do the Bossa Nova, despite its title, was perhaps the first LP to feature an American jazz musician recorded in Brazil with Brazilian groups, including the Sergio Mendes band before they came to the U.S. His “Comin’Home Baby,” a simple riffing blues written by his bassist Ben Tucker, was his biggest hit of that era. He played in Brazil and Japan and regularly topped many listener/reader polls throughout the 1960s. His album Memphis Underground was a monster smash and an early jazz/rock/fusion document.

During the 1970s, Mann moved into reggae and disco, had his own label, and produced sessions by Ron Carter, Miroslav Vitous, and Attila Zoller, among others. Mann’s popularity waned in the 1980s, and he has never been a critical favorite. He has been living in N.Mex. since—and discovered in 1997 that he has inoperable prostate cancer.
