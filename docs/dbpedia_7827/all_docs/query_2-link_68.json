        "text": "If youâve never given your body up to Patrick Adamsâ transcendent music on a packed dancefloor and lost your mind in the process, Iâm not sure we can be friends. A conceptual dance music producer, songwriter and arranger par excellence, Harlem-born trailblazer Adams recorded for labels like Atlantic, Salsoul and Prelude while working with artists as wide-ranging as Fonda Rae, Black Ivory, Sister Sledge, Loleatta Holloway, Main Ingredient, Shannon, Cares, Thomas & Taylor, Gladys Knight, Eddie Kendricks, Rick James and Bruni Pagan.\n\nAn embarrassment of riches, Patrick Adamsâ back-catalog is part of the essential fabric of underground 1970s and 1980s New York soul, funk, disco and post-disco club music: his classics include Cloud Oneâs âAtmosphere Strutâ and âDisco Juice;â Bumblebee Unlimitedâs âLady Bug;â Universal Robot Bandâs âDance And Shake Your Tambourine;â Inner Lifeâs âMoment Of My Lifeâ and âIâm Caught Up (In A One Night Love Affair);â Musiqueâs âKeep On Jumpinââ and âIn The Bush;â Phreekâs âWeekend;â Candi Statonâs âWhen You Wake Up Tomorrow;â and Herbie Mannâs âSuperman.â\n\nHowever, though heâs excelled as both a visionary synth pioneer and a retro-classicist arranger-producer, Adams has yet to be recognized for his monumental contribution to dance music â as least not in the way that peers like Giorgio Moroder and Nile Rodgers are routinely celebrated. Instead, Patrick Adams remains an unsung black musical genius whose scientific-soulful-funky approach to dance music has gifted us with an eccentric body of work that surges with carefree joyfulness and whimsical abandon.\n\nSerious purists have always understood disco to be merely an extension of earlier soul and funk traditions in black music. Disco at its complex best â stretching from the string-laden soul of Philadelphia International and Barry White to the lo-fi, alternative disco of Arthur Russell and West Records â offered a second-to-none platform for outsize creative freedom and innovation. By the late 1970s, however, mainstream disco at its worst â Iâm thinking Rick Deesâ 1976 âDisco Duck,â but Iâll entertain additional submissions â foreclosed soulful improvisation and groove, instead emphasizing subpar musicianship and cringeworthy, cornball musical cheese.\n\nIn contrast to this co-opted, fad-chasing dance music, soulful disco places a much higher priority on in-the-pocket Afrocentric grooves, emotionally rich vocals, percussive church-inspired frenzy and the palpable transmission of spirit and emotion. Patrick Adamsâ music fits squarely in this tradition. He is the pre-eminent â70s figure that most clearly brings together two different strands: the futuristic, long-format, experimental disco of artists ranging from Moroder and Tom Moulton to Loose Joints, and the retro arrangements and dynamic songcraft of golden era Motown, Stax and Philly International. Though he tends to gets classified as a solitary producing genius in the mold of Brian Wilson or Phil Spector, Adams is predominantly collaborative, surrounding himself throughout his career with outstanding talents like vocalist Leroy Burgess and co-writer and co-producer Greg Carmichael.\n\nBorn in the spring of 1950, Adams came of age as a teenager in Harlem at a moment ripe with musical possibility. âThe â60s was a golden period for a lot of things: Motown, Stax and Philly, Chicago, Blood, Sweat & Tears,â he told me in a recent phone interview. âBut I also listened to Burt Bacharach and what the 5th Dimension did with Jimmy Webb. I listened to everything. Any disposable cash went to buying records when I wasnât listening to the radio or when I wasnât playing myself.â\n\nAdams was also a voracious researcher of recording personnel: âI would tear everything apart trying to understand the who / what / when / where and why of musical creation â the engineers, the producers, the musicians.â He also devoured music trade magazines like Cashbox, Record World and Billboard each week. âWhen I was 17,â Adams reflects, âI would walk into a record store and I would ask if there was anything new written by Thom Bell or Jimmy Webb. I always shopped for records by producer, arranger and songwriter. The way DJs shop for records now is how I used to shop for records when I was a kid.â\n\nAdams lived with his family in a brownstone on 142nd street until he was nine years old, when they moved into the St. Nicholas Houses ten blocks away. Adams attended St. Aloysius Roman Catholic Church on 132nd Street and 7th Avenue, where he did duties as an altar boy. When Adams turned ten, his seaman father purchased him a trumpet, but when he turned twelve Adams switched to acoustic guitar. On his first day of school at the Bronxâs Cardinal Hayes High, Adamsâ joined the glee club, where he learned the intricacies of vocal harmonies.\n\nBy age 15, in 1964, heâd been transformed by the Beatlesâ legendary appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, and his father bought him an electric guitar soon after â Adams claims to have mastered it and written nearly 400 songs in record time. The middle child in the family, Adams and his younger brother further experimented with multi-tracking and overdubbing by making creative use of their fatherâs reel-to-reel tape recorder. Around 17, Adams began hanging out at the Apollo Theater, where Big Band producer Pete Long and conductor Reuben Phillips graciously let him sit in with orchestra so that he could study music and musicians like Smokey Robinson and Sam & Dave firsthand.\n\nAdamsâ early musical education continued once he joined R&B quartet The Sparks (not to be confused with fraternal glam duo Sparks; both groups signed to MGM in different eras). Before delving into original music, Adamsâ unit made waves as a formidable cover band, learning to perfect groove and even appearing briefly in the high school dance sequence of the 1967 Sandy Dennis film vehicle Up the Down Staircase. âPlaying all of the hits of the day was a very educational thing,â Adams mentions, âwhen youâve only got four pieces â guitar, bass, drums and keyboards. It requires you to be very tight in your arrangements.â The Sparks toured for four years with acts like The Commodores and Jerry Butler, but few of their singles made much of a splash on the charts.\n\nIn 1968, Adams acted as the manager for back-to-doo-wop R&B trio Black Ivory, fronted by singer Leroy Burgess (two years Adamsâ junior). In hopes of shopping the band, Adams took a job writing jingles for Perception Records, a small soul and genre-busting label, and Black Ivory eventually landed a deal on Perceptionâs subsidiary Today Records. At Perception, Adams quickly rose ranks to vice president of A&R, guiding eclectic projects by label artists ranging from R&B stalwart J.J. Barnes to Brazilian samba and bossa nova singer Astrud Gilberto. Adams eventually would partner up with Greg Carmichael, whoâd go on to found the Red Greg label as well as become Adamsâ most important songwriting and production collaborator â their early joint work includes 1974âs obscure, key-dropping-in-the-chorus âI Think Iâm In Loveâ by The Mayberry Movement and the Fantastic Puzzlesâ richly heartfelt âCome Back.â\n\nInspired by Motown and CEO Berry Gordyâs example of black music entrepreneurship, Adams left Perception/Today Records in 1974 hoping to strike out on his own. âA lot of young black entrepreneurs looked at Motown as something they admired and something they wanted to try to emulate and duplicate,â Adams says ruefully. âBut then you run into the politics of the industry and then they let you know thatâs not going to happen.â\n\nRecord label executive Peter Brown had plans to launch an eclectic label called P&P (supposedly coined after his first name and that of his wife Patricia), to be distributed by Morris Levyâs Roulette Records. Wowed by âAtmosphere Strut,â Brown pursued Adams and made arrangements to release the tune as one of the labelâs first singles, and iconic NYC radio DJ Frankie Crocker then broke the record on radio. While tradition has it that a band first forms, plays live and then decides to make a recording in the studio, Patrick Adams created Cloud One in the reverse direction. The âbandâ started purely as a studio-driven concept, with Adams himself playing most of the music, and the band name was essentially a front for his own creative fulfillment. Adams was basically bringing a late â60s tradition of fictional studio bands, like The Monkees and The Archies, fully into the disco era. Adams capitalized on the runaway success of âAtmosphere Strutâ with a hastily assembled Cloud One album, featuring drummer Richie Taninbaum (heâd remain a long-term Adams collaborator) plus Venus Dodson on background vocals (sheâd later record the Patrick Adams co-produced Night Rider album for RFC Records). 1976âs breezy follow-up âDisco Juiceâ is just as delirious as âAtmosphere Strut,â featuring an insistent soprano string line and blissed-out, forlorn singing.\n\nJust as the Beatles were driven by competition from the Beach Boys, Adams was driven by friendly competition from producers Thom Bell and Nile Rodgers during the â70s. Toward the end of the decade, the competition not only drove him to form ever-newer studio band units to test out his creative ideas, but also to experiment with innovative, far-out treatments. By 1978 Adams was still mostly known as an arranger more than a producer, recognized within the industry for his prodigious work ethic and his ability to multitask before that became a thing. In terms of sheer output, Adams says that he could devise arrangements for strings and horns for tens of dozens of musicians in a single overnight session, and that as the go-to orchestrator for producer Tony Silvester (of The Main Ingredient), he was raking in $10,000 a week to craft arrangements on demand. To realize the titanic creative visions swimming around in his polymath brain, Adams claims to have had 34 musical collaborators working with him at one point in the late 1970s; he called his staff called the âPA System.â In a three-year period from 1979-1982, Adams says that he was responsible for releasing 22 studio albums.\n\nAdamsâ grandiose arrangements are rooted in his lifelong desire to make non-disposable dance music (in contradistinction to disco-era pop, which was far too often as disposable and ephemeral as cotton candy). âIf you go back to a Top 40 radio station playlist from the time I was a teenager,â Adams says, âevery record on that playlist is a record of substance. Nowadays, when I look at a playlist, maybe five times a year at most I will hear something that I consider really interesting. It wasnât like that when I was a kid. Every week there were five or six really great pieces of music.â Adams found plenty of inspiration in arrangements by Motownâs David Van De Pitte and Paul Riser, as well as maverick Don Sebesky of Creed Taylorâs CTI label. Along the way, he was driven to find out how arrangers managed to âcreate tension, how did they create excitement, the counterpoint, the harmonies... I was on a lifelong mission to do stuff that hopefully would be appreciated and be considered great.â\n\nAdamsâ ecstatic disco is more than just bombastic at the level of arrangement â itâs also goofy and carefree, full of quirky touches like bizarrely dissonant harmonies, the Rimsky-Korsakov strings on âLady Bugâ or the dropped bars on âWeekend.â âIn The Bushâ boasts an off-kilter 5/4 bar that makes you feel like the rhythm is occasionally slipping, and 1979âs âGlideâ oscillates between 4/4 and 3/4. The break on âKeep on Jumpinââ is perhaps the most audacious of all, at one point slipping into an ambitious 10/4 time signature thatâs almost unheard of in the context of funk. Adams confesses: âI would blame Thom Bell and Burt Bacharach for my use of âslipped time,â where Iâm inserting 2/4 bars or 3/4 bars. But sometimes thatâs how your mind works: When youâre composing sometimes you come up with a phrase and you donât even realize itâs a 2/4 bar until you have to write it on paper.â Though he can be scientifically and mathematically precise in his approach, Adamsâ occasionally off-time synth keyboards on the early Cloud One records demonstrate that heâs also totally comfortable leaving minor imperfections on some of his best records. Aiming for infectious fun above all else, he doesnât always take things so seriously.\n\nAdams also happens to be an unsung innovator in terms of sonics and distribution formats. In an effort to amp up bass frequencies and levels, Adams and Greg Carmichael were amongst the earliest to pioneer the strategy of releasing disco grooves on 12\" singles rather than 7\". Blindingly creative remixers like John Morales and Larry Levan remixed and remastered those singles, turning them into extended versions and making them into immersive dancefloor experiences. While other producers moved away from the cities where they were raised or produced their formative music, Adams always remained in New York; his music profoundly reflects his city roots. The promotional music video for âIn The Bushâ was recorded in NYCâs Studio 54, the famous nightclub where DJs made great use of his phenomenal records. The Paradise Garage, helmed by DJ/remixer extraordinaire Levan, also played Patrick Adams songs on the regular. In the end, though, Adams was arguably eclipsed as a producer by audiencesâ increasing interest in remixers and DJs. Tim Lawrence, UK-based chronicler of New York downtown dance music in his tomes Love Saves the Day: A History of American Dance Music Culture, 1970-1979 and Life and Death on the New York Dancefloor, 1980-1983, says that âMaybe [Adams] was also a little unlucky in terms of his profile. Some would say his best production was Phreekâs âWeekend,â and in my book [Love Saves the Day] I talk about Larry Levan hammering that record at the Garage, but it never received a formal release, so the story was more about the way Larry turned it into a Garage anthem than the particulars of the studio production.â\n\nAdams was likewise not afraid to push disco to its carnal limits. Musiqueâs unsubtle, aggressive 1978 blockbuster âIn The Bushâ rankled radio DJs and elicited censorship; the title of âIâm a Freakâ by Phreek says it all (as if the bandâs name wasnât already enough); and Adams admits that Herbie Mannâs âEtaguiâ was little more than his own middle finger to the FCC, given that the lyric features a phonetic spelling of âeat a guyâ performed by a female choir: âEat a guy, eat a guy, a guy today / Eat a guy, eat a guy, a guy today / Eat a guy today, eat the gloom away.â Adams notes that heâs always found a way to translate his sexual frustrations into his creativity while remaining respectful to women, evident in the mutuality and respect in lyrics from songs like âIn The Bush:â âI want to do the things you want to do, too / So baby letâs get to it / Do it.â In Adamsâ world, songs are vehicles for a kind of unbridled, libidinous expression, even as they present the possibility for gender unification.\n\nAdams always excelled as an astounding curator of black womenâs singing voices. Besides Jocelyn Brown, Candi Staton, Fonda Rae and Christine Wiltshire, thereâs Adams-Carmichael stable singer Donna McGhee, whose smooth 1978 solo album Make It Last Forever features the percolating title track and The Spinners-styled âIt Ainât No Big Thing.â Adams emerges from a venerable tradition of black men who know how to produce and arrange for black female voices, and who also know how to craft lyrics that illuminate the dreams and desires of women â that short list includes the likes of Smokey Robinson, Kashif and Babyface. âIâm Caught Up (In A One Night Love Affair)â is case in point, with its potent lyric: âIâm a fairy-tale princess in search of a knight / And I never believe dreams come true / Iâm just like you.â\n\nSince the 1970s, black and brown gay men (not to mention trans, genderqueer and non-conforming folks, too) have largely been the cultivators and unofficial archivists of the underground, soulful dance music tradition, keeping alive independent disco, house and other styles. Adams, while straight, managed to make classic club standards that brought together LGBTQ communities in celebration: queer communities saw their deepest fantasies explored in his female-centered mini-epics, and they also found dancefloor bliss in his libertine, sensual grooves. âI am eternally grateful to the gay community for embracing my work,â Adams says. âFor me it was just a universal thing. I never looked at being gay as being different. I didnât see it as a substantial difference. For me, it was a person who loves someone who happens to be the same sex and wanted to be loved in kind.â\n\nHowever, by the summer of 1979, the anti-gay, anti-black âDisco Sucksâ movement was in full swing, and black arrangers and producers would soon be somewhat out of demand. While Nile Rodgers developed a larger profile in the rock and pop arena working with acts like Diana Ross, David Bowie, Duran Duran and Madonna, Adams continued to produce and create post-disco boogie tracks like 1982âs âSecondsâ by The Salsoul Orchestra, featuring Loleatta Holloway; the exuberant âParty Peopleâ by The Main Ingredient and Skipworth & Turnerâs funky 1985 cut âThinking About Your Love.â\n\nAdams put his formidable engineering skills to bank when he stepped into the role of chief engineer at Tony Arfiâs Power Play Studios, located in Long Island City. It was at Power Play that he recorded a slew of rap classics, including Eric B. & Rakimâs Paid In Full and Follow The Leader, using innovative techniques like deploying a bass drum microphone to lend preacher realness to Rakimâs booming baritone. He drew on his experiential know-how to put loops and samples in the appropriate musical key, and he was one of the first engineers to make use of digital processors like the Publison IM-90 Infernal Machine. Adams also found time to contribute to album projects by the likes of Teddy Riley, Keith Sweat and Narada Michael Walden. When I told him I was writing a piece about his friend Patrick Adams, Nile Rodgers wrote me a text: âPatrick Adams is not only one of my favorite composers/producers, heâs also one of my greatest influences. Though composers like to think weâre being original, I donât mind admitting that I sometime copy bits of Patrickâs chord progressions. They were some of the cleverest and vibey back in the day when started CHIC. Itâs easy to give props for the big tunes like âIn The Bush,â âCaught Up In One Night Love Affairs,â but I have massive love for songs like âIâm A Love Bug,â and âDance & Shake Your Tambourine.â Patrick is a master at keeping butts on the dancefloor. A true music machine!â\n\nMaybe part of the reason Adams isnât more widely known is that he moved through so many different studio concepts and bands, potentially denying himself a core branded identity that audiences could latch onto. He admittedly had far fewer chart-topping, multi-million selling records than some of his contemporaries â his music tended to simmer under the radar rather than explode into mass-market visibility. Like Phil Spector before him, Adams was also a singles producer more than a classic album producer: He never released an album under his own name, except for the slightly self-effacing Patrick Adams Presents Phreek. Whatâs more, Adams himself admits that he didnât have a definitive sonic signature. âYou can tell a Nile Rodgers record a million miles away because it has an imprint that emanates from his guitar,â Adams says. âIn my case I tried to avoid that. I didnât want my records to sound the same. Whether that was a positive thing or a negative thing, I donât know. But at the same time there is a signature in my music â sometimes itâs harmonic, and sometimes itâs just in the quirkiness of things. And sometimes you just donât hear it until somebody points it out to you and asks, âOh, he did that record too?ââ\n\nBut the arc of sonic creativity bends towards justice and retribution. By the late 1980s, studio bands like C&C Music Factory and Soul II Soul came about, carving a path for later 21st century studio bands like Hercules & Love Affair, Escort and Midnight Magic. In 1992, Adams collected royalties alongside co-writer Greg Carmichael for Cathy Dennisâs bouncy 1991 cover of Fonda Raeâs 1984 âTouch Me (All Night Long).â Adams also served as co-producer of 1982âs âKeep In Touch (Body To Body)\" by The Shades of Love and the remixed version, called âBody To Body (Keep In Touch)â which soared up the Billboard dance charts in 1995. New York underground house DJs like Masters At Work, centered around labels like Strictly Rhythm, built their sounds by drawing inspiration from classic funk and disco, making ample use of Adamsâ music in the process. Todd Terry united megavoices Jocelyn Brown and Martha Walsh to re-record âKeep on Jumpinââ in 1996; it too rocketed up the dance charts. On the other side of the Atlantic, the French Touch movement, buoyed by artists like Daft Punk, Bob Sinclar and Dimitri from Paris, mixed contemporary electronica with the kind of soulful disco that Patrick Adams helped inaugurate decades earlier, and some years later British deep house revivalists like Duke Dumont, Disclosure, Gorgon City and Clean Bandit followed suit. Underground disco, spurred on by the success of Dionysian global gay dance parties like Horse Meat Disco, appears to be more popular than ever, though the audience engagement politics are often whitewashed and columbused in ways that are culturally troubling.\n\nIf youâre unfamiliar with Adamsâ discography or just need a refresher, both volumes of Counterpoint Recordsâ Disco Juice: The Funky Disco Sound of Harlemâs P&P Records are great places to start. But given that Adamâs career precedes mid-â70s disco and extends far beyond, youâd be doing yourself a disservice to end there: Purchase some rare records, surf streaming services and take a deep dive into the magic that is the music of Patrick Adams. You wonât be sorry â at the very least, youâll end up having danced your posterior off, and maybe even covered in, uh, disco juice â and thatâs a promise."
