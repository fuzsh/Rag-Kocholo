At this performance the band will also be playing from his soon-to-be-released Latin Jazz CD, \"In the Moment\"—original Latin Jazz that inspired by his work with Cal Tjader, Herbie Mann, Dizzy Gillespie, and Mongo Santamaria. Samples can be heard at http://www.myspace.com/rogerglenn\n\nSeptember 5, 2010 - 4:30, $35\n\nOnline reservations: http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/112032\n\nDouglas Beach House on Miramar Beach\n\n307 Mirada Road, Half Moon Bay, CA 94019\n\n650 726-4143, www.bachddsoc.org\n\nPrepare to clap your hands, tap your toes, and bounce in your seats as the Country Casanovas[MySpace] perform this Friday the 13th at Cypress Meadows.\n\nThis very popular Bay Area Honky Tonk band will be playing a fabulous mixture of country swing, beautiful ballads, and country and western classics. The doors will open at 6 pm. Hearty appetizers and beverages will be available until the music begins at 7 pm. Dessert and beverages will be served at intermission. Tickets are only $25 per person and include food, drink, entertainment, and parking. Space is limited so please reserve your seats soon by contacting Sharon by phone at 650-728-8045 or by email at [email protected].\n\nCypress Meadows, a conference and event center, is located behind Cypress Flower Farm at 343 Cypress Ave. in Moss Beach.\n\nPolice Chief Don O’Keefe was confirmed by the United States Senate to become the United States Marshal for the Northern District of California. Chief O’Keefe has been the City’s Police Chief since June 1, 2007 and is expected to assume his new duties by mid September.\n\nInterim City Manager Michael Dolder will meet with the City Council to discuss Chief O’Keefe’s replacement.\n\nChief O’Keefe said “I’m honored to have been selected for this important position and wish to thank Senator Feinstein for her recommendation and President Obama for nominating me.”\n\nIn a press release, Chief O’Keefe said that he is particularly proud of the accomplishments his department has made in the areas of community policing, emergency preparedness, and programs, such as the Police Activities League (PAL).\n\nBased on a press release from the city of Half Moon Bay.\n\nGolden Gate National Recreation Area is experimenting with controlled burning at Milagra Ridge near Pacifica to restore habitat for endangered mission blue butterflies. GGNRA expects to do this one day in mid to late August.\n\nThe burning will be confined to metal boxes which are 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters in area and 1 meter in height, and rotated to treat 300 square meters total.\n\nThe burning will be conducted if weather conditions allow. Smoke from this project will be very minimal, but traces of smoke may be seen or smelled from a distance.Fire management personnel and equipment will be present during all phases of burn operations.\n\nGGNRA managers will compare the effects of fire with vegetation removal and soil scraping to determine if either treatment is more effective at stimulating lupine germination. Lupine plants are critical to mission blue butterflies because they are the sole food source for developing larvae.\n\nThis project was originally scheduled for fall 2009, but was cancelled last year due to early heavy rainfall. Sections of the Milagra Ridge Trail may be closed while burning is in progress.\n\nThis story is based on a press release from GGNRA.\n\nThis post has been updated with details on a second walk and more information about the planning process.\n\nThis Sunday, August 8, 2010 at 10:00am and 2:00pm, the board of Midcoast Park Lands is conducting a walk from the parking lot of the Moss Beach Distillery to the Montara Light House. The primary purpose is to walk the trails in the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve where proposed trail improvements are under review (PLN2010-00183).\n\nThis is an opportunity to view story stakes of the proposed trail location, trail width (14’ wide), bridge location and scale of the proposed bridge (12’ wide x 60’ long).\n\nThe public comment period has been extended to August 16, 2010 by 5:00pm.\n\nA Negative Declaration has been published for the projects. Comments should be sent to Mike Schaller (San Mateo County Planning – 650-363-1823 – [email protected]). Information on the plans and the Negative Declaration document are available at the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve page of the San Mateo County Parks Web Site/.\n\nThe Negative Declaration comments will be an agenda topic at next week’s MCC meeting [MCC].\n\nThe optional full walk goes from the north end of de-commissioned Ocean Blvd. to the Montara Light House. This path affords an opportunity to view potential routes, views and issues involved with completing a route for the California Coastal Trail and a Bicycle Route from Pillar Point to the Montara Light House. The walks will be led by Len and Gael Erickson and will leave the Distillery Parking Lot at 10:15am and 2:15pm.\n\nDo you want to raise an issue with the community, or do you have a local event you want to promote?
