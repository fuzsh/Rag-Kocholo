        "text": "What are the best Herbie Mann CD albums to pick up?\n\nI know there were a handfull of Japanese remasters from 2004 (I believe), can anyone tell me which are the seminal releases I need to have and of these titles, which are the best releases available (w/ cat. nos. if imports; i.e. Japan, etc.)?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nPS - I'm not really up on this dude, apart from his Push Push, Memphis Underground, Love & The Weather and At The Village Gate releases. I've enjoyed them all quite a bit though.\n\nAnymore reccommendations?\n\nJust came accross the following 24k remasters from Warner Japan for Village Gate and Memphis Underground... WPCR-25008, WPCR-25009.\n\nI guess I can safely add those to the list.\n\nThere's also a mini-LP sleeve edition of Love & The Weather from Toshiba/EMI Japan... TOCJ-9643.\n\nWhat else is out there?\n\nPS - The Japanese cover of Yardbird Suite at CDUniverse is really classy!\n\nSorry -- 1 more question re: Flautista!\n\nThere is a US domestic release on either Verve Records or Polygram, Cat. No. 5574482 (I'm not sure which) that is listed as a '98 release, \"original recording remastered\".\n\nThere also appears to be a '99 import release from Polygram Japan, Cat. No. POCJ-2778, which oddly enough boasts \"first time ever on CD!\"\n\nWhich of these is the one to pick up in terms of sound quality and are they both sourced from the same master?\n\nThanks Mark, I have those too (Japanese MU ed.), but I'd like to know about the Collectables two-fer packagings and how they sound. I'm trying to decide whether or not it's worth it to pick these up or go for the original records? I generally hate \"two-fer\" packagings and I'm skeptical of Collectables remasterings because they often sound like cheap budget label offerings with terrible fidelity. I'm not crazy about the covers either. But if I hear good feedback than I'll change my mind and pick them up. It'd be a hell of a lot easier than having to track down 25 of his records!\n\nThe most recent domestic release came in a digipak and sounds excellent to these ears. Great music!\n\nThanks, I've added it to the list\n\nAnything about the Collectables packagings and which are the best - or subsequently, ones to avoid?\n\nAre they worth picking up?\n\nIs there anything better available?\n\nAlso, do the 2-fers come in slipcases or just the regular ugly cover art as seen on Amazon, etc?\n\nMore importantly... do they sound alright?\n\nCollectables reissues have improved somewhat.\n\nIf and when you get these, let us know as I would be interested in knowing about the sound on these.\n\nOr anyone who may have picked them up.\n\nI'm interested in Village Gate also. I was going to get it a while back but Steve said he was going to work on a reissue but I guess that's still in limbo:\n\nLive at the Village Gate thread\n\nPlease let us know how this one sounds.\n\nThey are part of the Warner Jazz series released in Japan. Middle East was released earlier this year and Our Mann Flute will be out next month.\n\nI have the Polygram release from 1998 Cat. No. 5574482) and the sound quality is superb, at least to my ears. High resolution and powerful bass. Haven't heard any other CD release. This release is so good that I never bothered to look any further. The vinyl from 1959 is also very nice, which I have, but it lacks slightly compared to this CD release, me thinks.\n\nin Tokyo i just picked up two more Mann CDs at a department store, part of another Jazz Best 1,000 Yen series\n\n(about $10) released earlier this year, there's a whole buncha other Mann releases in this series, but I'm not into the\n\ncheese- jazz that is his pre-1967 stuff...\n\nMemphis Two-Step (WPCR-27293)\n\nHold On, I'm Comin' (WPCR-27115) this is really great, haven't heard this since I've had a record player..\n\nthe Japan versions are the only ones made besides the Collectables two-fer...\n\nthis series also includes Live at the Whiskey (which is wicked short at about 31 minutes if I recall...so\n\nfor this one I'll stick with the two-fer which includes Mississippi Gambler, a pretty cool cheesy/funk LP)....I wish I could find the Reggae CD, this also has Mick Taylor on it, I think the only version of this is on Wounded Bird and it's way expensive and OOP..\n\nI've got the Memphis Underground album and this 5CD box.\n\n(Disc 1 - Recorded Live 1961) Herbie Mann at the Village Gate (Atlantic)\n\n(Disc 2 - Recorded 1962) Do The Bossa Nova With Herbie Mann (Atlantic)\n\n(Disc 3 - Recorded 1961/2) Nirvana - Herbie Mann and The Bill Evans Trio (Atlantic)\n\n(Disc 4 - Recorded 1970) Muscle Shoals Nitty Gritty (Embryo)\n\n(Disc 5 - Recorded Live 1972) Hold On, I'm Comin' (Atlantic)\n\nThere's a great mixed bag of instrumental styles presented here and the sound on the CDs is good too. If tasty Soul, Jazz and Bossa Nova music appeals to you then this bargain box is a must."
