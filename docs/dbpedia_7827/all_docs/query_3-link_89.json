        "text": "Herbie Mann – Philly Dog from the Atlantic Records 45\n\nHere we are at midweek, and I had a great 45 to write up, however the info was really scarce. I thought I’d do a bit more scouring and searching before I just put it up. It’s something I think the FMF family will enjoy, so keep an ear out for that in the upcoming weeks. I was definitely down with the Augustus Pablo side from Monday, and if anyone can settle the flute vs. the recorder from that track, I’d surely appreciate it. Up today is an artist that I pretty much buy up anything I see from him. He is definitely a musician that has done some straight ahead as well as some funky stuff. Here’s Herbie Mann with “Philly Dog” on Atlantic Records.\n\nHerbert Jay Solomon was born in Brooklyn, NY in 1930. He progressed from pots and pans, to a clarinet (after attending a Benny Goodman concert), to a saxophone, and ending up with the flute, an instrument he has been well known for throughout his career. He played gigs in the Catskills at 14, and played tenor in the Army. After his Army stint, he threw himself into the NYC music scene, only to be lumped in with many other sax players. When an opportunity arose to be one of only a handful of Jazz flute players, he jumped at the chance to be included on a Carmen McRae record. The rest is history. Along the way he played with quality notables, and after he decided to take up the flute, his added many a Latin percussionist: Willie Bobo, Candido, Ray Barretto, Potato Valdes and others. It was around this time he would put out Live At The Village Gate, which is one of my faves. He’d go on to tour Brazil and Africa with the State Department, which would filter into his music. Mann would play a variety of styles, incorporate popular music of the day, and collaborate with a lot of big players. From Roy Ayers to Chick Corea to David Newman to Bill Evans and beyond, Herbie Mann was the man. Mann would also be a producer, television music composer and arranger in his long career. His collaborations with Ayers to me are legendary, especially Memphis Underground. This is one record I can not get enough of. That will have to be for another write up. Throughout his career, he would record for Prestige, Savoy, Riverside, Bethlehem, and most notably Atlantic among others. Afetr he left Atlantic, he’d release records on his own label, but not before he would get a feel for even more genres, which would include Reggae, Pop, and Disco. Herbie Mann would die in 2003.\n\nWhat we have here today is one of Herbie Mann’s many, many covers. Whether it was Brazillian, Funk, Jazz, or Soul, he could cover them better than the rest. It’s 1966, and Mann does a great version of Rufus Thomas’s classic. Mann has a great knack for putting out quality covers, all done with his own unique twist. I can’t give props enough to Herbie Mann and his Jazz flute. If you had mixed feelings about the man and his music, give it a try, you’ll be glad you did. I’ll be back Friday with a joint mix collaboration with Jack the Ripper called funk & soul For Losers. Keep Diggin’!"
