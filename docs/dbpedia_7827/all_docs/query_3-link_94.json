        "text": "Interview -- Henry Lee Summer (Singer/Songwriter)\n\n\"I just always have played music. For better or worse, I banked my whole life on it.\" ~ Henry Lee Summer ~ It's strange how music lets you travel through time as if there truly was no time. I played the shit out of this album growing up. Nothing deep or complicated. Nothing outta bounds. Nothing to get hung about. It's deceptively simple. But here's the thing... Henry Lee Summer is serving aces all over this heartland square. This is the 35th anniversary of Henry Lee Summer's self-titled album and this one falls under that sweet spot between raucous and chill. It's a large cup of iced coffee with a nice soulful blend. Not usually my type of go-to and yet this album easily fills a void I didn't know I had. Let this spin be your own private Idaho. \" Check it out, Leroy!\" Henry Lee Summer... Go get you some. Henry Lee Summer Interview -- August 2023 Henry Lee Summer Casey Chambers: Well, this is the 35th anniversary of you\n\nInterview:-- Joan Staley (Actress - Classic Movies & Television)\n\n\"Elvis, do you really want me to slap you?\" ~ Joan Staley ~ So my friends and I were talking about first crushes. First tv and movie crushes. For me, it was easy. It was Alma. (Joan Staley) I broke into the double-digit age of 10 in 1993. That was the summer I discovered my favorite Don Knotts movie while flipping thru cable one Saturday morning... \"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.\" Everyone has seen it. It was a funny haunted house story similar to an episode on Andy G. with a cast of familiar characters, trippy organ music, and the prettiest girl I had ever seen...Alma. She was beautiful alright. I was love-stung so bad, I swear I could smell flowers coming out of the TV set. And best of all, she was nice. She didn't like the smart alec, the wise guy, or the show-off. Alma was digging Luther (Don Knotts) and that just made her that much prettier. And from then on... But unfortunately, time and puberty wouldn't let her wait"
