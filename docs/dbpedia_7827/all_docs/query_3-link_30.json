        "text": "“I ALWAYS thought you were going to be a great jazz musician,” a critic told flautist Herbie Mann some years ago, “but then one day you just stopped.”\n\n“Yes,” Mann answered with a certain sarcasm, “I was sitting in my house one day and I decided, I'm not going to be Charlie Parker any more; I'm just going to sell out.”\n\nMann, who was born in Brooklyn 43 years ago and is of Rumanian‐Jewish extraction, has been a best‐selling recording artist and a popular concert attraction since 1958.. Although he has never become the flautist the critic hoped for, he has pioneered in the adaptation by jazzmen of rhythmic concepts from the Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East, and the southern United States. But even these successful efforts have brought almost unanimously negative reviews in the jazz press.\n\nMann, who has described his music as “Afro‐Yiddish,” has employed a number of talented jazzmen, but he feels that “a lot of people who have worked for me would rather not admit they worked for me. I think a lot of people felt that they took the jobs strictly for the money, and not because of the music. Yet I've been playing in the clubs for 15 years, constantly trying to mold people of diverse musical backgrounds into communicating with each other. I've always had an au dience which was predominantly black and Latin; I figure if I can get these people to accept my music rhythmically, then I must be doing something right.”\n\nMann will be presenting a number of African, Afro‐Cuban, and Afro‐American musicians who do admit to being alumni of his various groups at Avery Fisher Hall on Saturday night. He expects to augment the Family of Mann, his present sextet, with the Nigerian percussionist and composer Olatunji; vibraphonist Roy Ayres; Carlos (Patato) Valdes and his Bata Cubano; guitarist Sonny Sherrock, and various “surprise guests.” Valdes and Olatunji are veterans of Mann's early, Latin‐ and African‐oriented groups; the string quartet is rock‐flavored Atlantic album “Turtle Bay.”\n\n*\n\nAyres, who recently scored the film “Coffy,” is one of several talented black jazzmen who have worked with Mann over the years. Others include Weather Report's Miroslav Vitous; bassist Reggie Workman, an alumnus as well of John Coltrane, Yusef Lateef, and Archie Shepp groups; and pianist Chick Corea, who later played with Miles Davis and is now leader of the jazz‐rock group Return to Forever. “In 1965,” Mann recalls, “I suggested to Chick that we do an album using electric piano and conga drums. He said no, he didn't dig the electric piano; he didn't dig conga drums. By the time he got to Miles, electric piano was all he was playing, and everybody was Mann's own credits as a sideman include stints with Carmen McRae, Kenny Clarke and Pete Rugolo. But in 1958, when he formed his first band his jazz credentials were questioned by critics who heard only the overpowering rhythms of his four Afro‐Cuban drummers. “Nevertheless,” he maintains, “the band was an instant success. Having the four Afro‐Cubans was like having Batman, Robin, the Green Hornet, and Superman.”\n\nThe tall, balding, scrupulously well‐groomed Mann discusses Latin music with the enthusiasm of a long‐time of icionade. “Esy Morales's recording of ‘Jungle Fantasy’ was the reason I started on the flute,” he says. “And living in New York, how could you not get your blood boiling listening to Tito Puente, Charlie Palmieri, Machito, those Latin bands? I always loved percussion; I was playing pots and pans when I was five years old. And compared to Latin music, Afro‐Cuban music and Brazilian music, straight jazz time sounded stiff. So I decided to go according to my tastes, not to the tastes of the Dan Morgensterns, the Nat Hentoffs, the John S. Wilsons. They always wanted to jut jazz on an intellectual level, to take it away from the basics, from the sensuality of African and Afro‐Cuban music. Besides, the audience I developed wasn't listening intellectually; they were listening emotionally.”\n\nBetween 1958 and 1965 Mann employed, Ray Barretto, Ray Mantilla, Chief Bey, Jose Mangual, Willie Bobo and ,Montego Joe, as well as Valdes and Olatunji; the list is a virtual Who's Who of African and Latin percussion. His “Comin' Home Baby,” recorded at the Village Gate, was a sizable hit, and he toured Africa and Latin America. In Brazil he met Sergio Mendes, Antonio Car los Jobim and Baden Powell He recorded with them in Rio de Janeiro, but the success of his “Live at the Village Gate” LP delayed the release of his Brazilian album. In the meantime, Stan Getz's and Jim Hall's “Jazz Samba” became a best‐seller, and the bossa nova craze was on.\n\n“Actually,” Mann notes, “Miles Davis was the first American musician to record a bossa nova. He did ‘Corcovado’ with Gil Evans, right after they recorded ‘Miles Ahead,’ but the company, kept it in the can.”\n\nAfter his Brazilian period, Mann hired an oud player and several Syrian and Armenian percussionists. His Middle Eastern band made its debut at the Village Theater the night the 1967 Arab‐Israeli conflict began, and soon disbanded. A jazz‐baset quintet preceded Mann's current infatuation with rhythm and blues.\n\n“Memphis Underground's was Mann's most successful LP since the “Village Gate” album. “All I've been doing is playing with different rhythm sections and differ ent feelings,” he says. “Now I'm going to England to work with Eric Clapton, Stevie Winwood, Keith Emerson (of Emerson, Lake and Palmer) and Ian Anderson (of Jethro Tull). The guys in England have a different feeling than the guys in Memphis, New Orleans or Muscle Shoals, They're all playing their own approaches to rhythm and blues, and they, are all specialists.\n\n“People ask me how a, ‘jazz’ musician can play ‘rock.’ Well, if he's living in 1973 and he has his head and his ears open, how can he not? I grew Up listening to Lester Young and Charlie Parker. I love Count Basle; I love Thad Jones and Mel Lewis. But to me the opus of 1973 is Stevie Wonder.”\n\nWith over 40 albums In release and no shortage of concert bookings, Mann can afford to work only on weekends. All of his records, even reissues of his mid‐fifties work, continue to sell briskly. He lives with his second wife, Jane, and their two‐year‐old daughter, Laura, on Park Avenue in the eighties; the time he devotes to his family is a luxury few jazzmen enjoy. He holds season tickets for Mets, Jets, Knicks and Rangers games and has been known to cancel concerts which conflicted with eagerly anticipated sporting events.\n\nThe reviews Mann receives in the press may be the only irritation in his life. “So many of the writers are afflicted with what I call the 18‐year‐old syndrome,” he says. “When I was 18, I only wanted purity, an 18‐year‐old's idea of purity. Everything else was selling out. But I think it's a much bigger lie to not do what you do best, only to satisfy somebody else. Life is too short for someboly else to set a standard for me about what my tastes in music are.”"
