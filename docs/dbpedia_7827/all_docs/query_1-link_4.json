        "text": "The flautist, saxophonist and composer Herbie Mann, who has died aged 73, was not the first jazz musician to get a bad press for making money, nor will he be the last. When he recorded the album Memphis Underground in 1968, he became a star, and a key figure in the emerging jazz-rock fusion movement.\n\nDevelopments subsequently explored by Miles Davis (on Bitches Brew), by Herbie Hancock and John McLaughlin, and by Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter (with Weather Report), were all foreseen on Memphis Underground, with its then unlikely deployment of three electric guitarists, keyboards and the funky vibraphone of Roy Ayers.\n\nMann's landmark album, with its restless rhythmic feel and eclectic repertoire, broke all the rules by including the pop hit Hold On, I'm Comin' - and it sold by the truckload. It also attracted a good deal of sniffy disapproval from orthodoxpundits, who disliked its creator's insubstantial flute sound, thought the electric tapestry backdrop was a mess, and felt that music with funk backbeats and electric keys was no longer entitled to be called jazz.\n\nBut time was on Mann's side, and few jazz fans under 60 would listen to Memphis Underground today and maintain that to label it as jazz would be a misnomer. The doubters missed Mann's importance as an innovative conceptualist, an enabler who could bring players of different backgrounds together, and a bandleader who believed that bold jazz evolution and box-office takings were not incompatible.\n\nBorn Herbert Jay Solomon in Brooklyn, Mann first learned the clarinet, and took up the flute and tenor saxo phone in his teens. He played extensively on US army service in Europe in the early 1950s, and worked with Stan Kenton's arranger Pete Rugolo in the middle years of that decade. Between 1954 and 1956, he began to record for the Bethlehem label.\n\nHe already favoured a probing smooth sound, in which his flute would be complemented by a guitar, vibraphone and classical strings, or even a second flute. Even so, a more conventional jazz instrumentation surfaced on his album Just Waitin' (1958), on which Thelonious Monk saxophonist Charlie Rouse, jazz/blues guitarist Kenny Burrell and Billie Holiday pianist Mal Waldron struck an imposing balance between delicacy and muscle on a powerful mix of imported and original material.\n\nBy 1961, Mann was a major jazz attraction, sought after first by the Verve label, and then by Atlantic. He toured 15 countries under the state department's aegis in 1960, and familiarised himself with the jazz-bossa idiom on tours of Brazil between 1961 and 1963. During this period, his flute began to mimick an Astrud Gilberto-like breathy vocal whisper, rather than its formerly horn-like sound.\n\nYet Mann remained close to the jazz tradition, and indicated his continuing alle giances by adopting the tenor saxophone to front a big band bearing his name at the 1965 Newport jazz festival. A broadminded listener, he absorbed traditional blues and ethnic musics into his evolving conceptions, and all these elements came together in the tonal palette of the Memphis Underground band.\n\nFollowing that success, Mann extended his career into record production (for the Atlantic subsidiary Embryo) and, by the 70s, explicit jazz references in his own music were becoming increasingly subsumed into an eclectic, early world-jazz programme with the Family Of Mann ensemble. In the mid-1970s, he worked in England with such rock musicians as Mick Taylor and Aynsley Dunbar (London Underground), experimented with reggae and disco idioms, and recorded a powerful account of My Girl. He formed his own Herbie Mann Music label in 1979.\n\nWith the band Jasil Brazz, Mann returned to a bossa nova repertoire - the album Caminho De Casa was a particular triumph and ended any criticism of his flute playing. He launched the Kokopelli label in 1992, to celebrate some not entirely invigorating revisits to earlier incarnations of his Latin-fusion music.\n\nBut, as so often happened in his complex career, an apparent Mann regression was misleading - and he was back with an all-jazz repertoire in 1995, celebrating his 65th birthday with a residency at the Blue Note club, and working with jazz stars Randy Brecker, Paquito D'Rivera, Bobby Watson, Ron Carter and many others. His improvised account of Charlie Parker's Au Privave, on the recording of this encounter, revealed he had remembered his earliest lessons well.\n\nA Downbeat readers' pollwinner for 13 consecutive years, Mann was a musical maverick, whose reputation as an innovator has only lately received its proper due. He is survived by his third wife Susan Janeal Arison, and two sons and two daughters from earlier marriages."
