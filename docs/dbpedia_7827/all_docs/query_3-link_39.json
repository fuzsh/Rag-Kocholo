        "text": "Herbie Mann, who helped to popularize the flute as a jazz instrument and to introduce the music of other cultures into the mainstream of American jazz, died on Tuesday at his home in New Mexico. He was 73 and lived in a cabin in Pecos, near Santa Fe.\n\nThe cause was prostate cancer, his family said.\n\nMr. Mann's first instrument was the clarinet, and when he began his career he was primarily a tenor saxophonist. But by the late 1950's he was concentrating on flute, which was almost unheard of as a choice for a jazz musician at the time.\n\nWithin a decade, the flute had become far more common in jazz. Much of the credit for its higher profile belonged to Mr. Mann, who by then had achieved a degree of popularity extending well beyond the confines of the jazz world, largely because of his willingness to look beyond that world for inspiration.\n\nIn 1962, he became one of the first American jazz artists to embrace Brazilian music and work with Brazilian musicians, recording an album with Antonio Carlos Jobim, Sergio Mendes and others. He later incorporated elements of African, Japanese and Middle Eastern music into his repertory.\n\nAmerican blues and soul were also part of the mix. His live recording of ''Comin' Home Baby,'' an up-tempo blues with an infectious dance beat, was a hit in 1962. Later in the decade he expanded his audience with albums like ''Memphis Underground,'' on which his working group was supplemented by Southern session musicians; the repertory had a contemporary rhythm-and-blues flavor.\n\nThe critics, for the most part, were not impressed. ''To most jazz critics I was basically Kenny G,'' he said in an interview with United Press International last year, referring to the highly popular but critically maligned saxophonist. ''I was too successful. I made too much money. Alternate fringe audiences liked me too much.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
