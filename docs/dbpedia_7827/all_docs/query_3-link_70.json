Thank you very much.\n\nWell that's on cricket dance like me. Members of the organization and keyboards at Revel. And Bass will lead. Drums Rick Marotta. And guitar were in a ritzy. And the question. A. But.\n\nEvery once in a while we play a place where we can hear ourselves. We\n\nrealize with masochists we are playing in gymnasiums and places like that so we we've decided that after the middle of the summer we're going to stop performing for about three years live and try to organize the same halls that the symphonies play and to work in. And that may take a year or two of me turning down jobs but I just think it's necessary for us to hear ourselves and mainly because we've been playing a lot of very quiet music. The song we're going to play now is is written by Chopin and it was the theme from the in the Bergman movie cries and whispers. The reason we play it as a duet is that we do have this right as the left or the right that you like.\n\nRight.

Why.\n\nWhat's. Up. Oh. No. Yes.\n\nThank you. You know. The piano is an instrument that has black and white keys it's 88 goes like this. He's got a different color skin that I have you recall it's for a different record company. Cool yeah. This is Never Can Say Goodbye.\n\nYeah. Oh. Oh.\n\nHow. Do you know. I just can't do it. Every little bit. Oh. No.\n\nMaybe it'll only be two years.\n\nOf infamy. Yeah.\n\nRight. But for the.\n\nFor me man began to make his mark on the jazz scene in 1959 with his Afro jazz sextet.
