        "text": "I have really tried hard to like this album, but I can't...to me, it just loses interest after a few minutes of flute noodling. A shame, too, as I have this pressed on audiophile 180g vinyl and it is fairly good sonically (I think overall there is too much ambient noise). I'm no fan of jazz flute to begin with, and Mann never did anything for me. (I tend to prefer woodwind players who double on flute and other instruments for some reason. )\n\nIn the same shipment, I had also received a 180g pressing of J. Geils Full House, and the sheer energy of that legendary performance at the Cinderella Ballroom in Detroit just blew the doors off the Herbie Mann rekkid. Not to mention the 180g pressing smokes any CD version that was ever pressed.\n\nI barely gave this one two stars. I can listen to just about anything, but this one came across as audio Prozac to me...and as I mentioned, I've given it a chance several times and simply do not enjoy it one bit.\n\nHmmm, a little surprised that you didn't care much for this album. This album reminds me of the beatnik era as I remember it. I love this album myself. I think the percussionists and Hagood Hardy's vibes are a great match for Mann's flute. I personally enjoy the flute in jazz, probably because there's not really a lot of it out there.\n\nBTW, a really cool album of Mann's to give a listen to is called Yardbird Suite where he also plays tenor sax and teams up with a young Phil Woods. Very hip stuff! I think it came out in '57 or so.\n\nCapt. Bacardi"
