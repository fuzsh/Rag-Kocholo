        "text": "All I know about English costume designer Nic Ede is his first credit was in the costume department on Monty Python’s The Life of Brian (1979); he frequently works with costumer RaÃ¯ssa Hans, who I adore ever since I interviewed her; and with one major exception, I really like his work! Let’s run down his frock flicks resume:\n\nThe Madness Museum (1986)\n\nA black comedy about a doctor working in a mental asylum in 1860.\n\nA World Apart (1988)\n\nA young South African girl deals with her parents’ disappearance in 1963.\n\nFat Man and Little Boy (1989)\n\nThe Manhattan Project, the secret wartime project in New Mexico where the first atomic bombs were designed and built.\n\nSeaforth (1994)\n\nA love story about two working-class Yorkshire people, set in 1943.\n\nWilde (1997)\n\nThe biopic of Oscar Wilde starring Stephen Fry.\n\nFar from the Madding Crowd (1998)\n\nA TV adaptation of the 1874 Thomas Hardy novel.\n\nDash and Lilly (1999)\n\nA biopic about writers Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman in the 1940s-50s.\n\nThe Lady in Question (1999)\n\nA story about a Jewish Rights advocate who may have been killed by Nazis in 1938; Gene Wilder plays the detective who investigates.\n\nLorna Doone (2000)\n\nAn adaptation of the 17th-century-set romantic novel.\n\nBright Young Things (2003)\n\nAn adaptation of Evelyn Waugh’s novelÂ Vile Bodies, about the young and fashionable set in 1920s Britain.\n\nGunpowder, Treason & Plot (2004)\n\nA TV miniseries. The first half is about Mary, Queen of Scots; the second is about her son, James I. We’ve mocked it endlessly and for good reason. I can only assume there was less than zero budget.\n\nNanny McPhee (2005)\n\nEmma Thompson plays a nanny in this comic film set in late-19th-century England.\n\nAllegiance (2005)\n\nThe meeting between the Irish Republican Michael Collins and Winston Churchill.\n\nMe and Orson Welles (2008)\n\nIn 1937, a teenager is cast in a theater production of “Julius Caesar,” directed by a young Orson Welles.\n\nHysteria (2011)\n\nA doctor invents the first vibrator to treat “hysterical” women in late-19th-century Britain.\n\nSummer in February (2013)\n\nAn artists’ colony in Cornwall, set during the 1910s (I think?).\n\nThe White Queen (2013)\n\nA miniseries about Queen Elizabeth Woodville and the Wars of the Roses.\n\nIndian Summers (season 1, 2015)\n\nVarious lives intersect in 1930s colonial India.\n\nClose to the Enemy (2016)\n\nSet just after World War II, a German scientist helps the British develop jet planes.\n\nWorld on Fire (2019-)\n\nA TV series set during World War II, about ordinary people.\n\nFlowers in the Attic: the Origin (2022)\n\nAn adaptation of several VC Andrews books, about a seriously messed up family in 1910s-50s Virginia. We’ll have a review very soon!\n\nWhat’s your favorite of Nic Ede’s frock flicks work?\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMore Frock Flicks"
