        "meta_description": "R. D. Blackmore's classic tale of forbidden love, revenge, and adventure in lawless 17th century England is one of the greatest love stories ever told. John Ridd was just a boy when the villainous Doones murdered his father. Now a young man, John has two driving passions: his thirst for revenge against the outlaw Doones, and his love for the beautiful Lorna, daughter of his sworn enemies. Lavish costumes, dazzling scenery, and a stellar supporting cast round out this splendid version.",
