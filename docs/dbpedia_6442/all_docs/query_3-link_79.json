        "meta_description": "Classic Romance - Christchurch City Libraries by  ChristchurchLib - a staff-created list : Most romance novels published after World War II are considered ‘modern’. Anything prior to that is considered classic, with the heyday being the turn of the century. Typically featuring prudish women that harbour secret desires, pompous men of importance who turn out to have a heart of gold, and family, legal, or societal pressures getting in the way of love and becoming a head-ache for all involved. Even if you’ve never read Pride and Prejudice, you’ve heard of it, proving the consistent popularity of the romance genre - these titles are where it all began.",

This 400 year old tale of forbidden love and teenage angst has been adapted, retold and reimagined hundreds of times over but no one makes you care about these crazy kids more than the Bard himself.

Since its immediate success in 1813, 'Pride and Prejudice' has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Darcy’s pride, Lizzie’s prejudice, misunderstandings, adorable side romances and Austen's acute observations and acerbic wit - what’s not to love? Show less\n\nAll copies in use.

This classically dark romance has achieved cult status through its haunting language and deft portrayal of an obsessive and dangerous love between Heathcliff and Cathy, identifying inherited trauma, isolation and 18th century struggles.

Her marriage to Dr Charles Bovary is quickly a disappointment in the romance department and so she embarks on a number of highly-charged affairs, with glimpses of all she ever wanted. Her material wants are as consuming as her romantic needs and she quickly racks up debts, her affairs fizzle out and Madame Bovary is then left to face her demons. A whirlwind novel full of excesses, devouring passions and true love - once decried as an obscene and immoral text but modern readers may sympathise more with Mme Bovary, a flesh and blood woman who wanted it all.

Lauded as ‘the world’s greatest novel’ by some, and a 'a bit wordy' by others, Anna Karenina is the tragic tale of a woman who leaves her emotionless marriage to find solace in the arms of the passionate Count Vronsky, and how society punishes them for their union. Split into eight parts, this definitely isn’t a light and fluffy summer romance read but it is a classical heavy-weight, full of a wealth of memorable characters, burning passion, tragedy and an enduring snap shot of the rapidly transforming landscape of Russia.

Split into two main parts, this novel paints a picture of a developing realisation of love as our couple do not immediately hit it off and then there are other, more advantageous, engagements on the cards too. But when they meet again in England, what transpired in Italy brings these two lovers together. An optimistic novel and a humorous snapshot of the constraints of Edwardian England with a refreshingly forward-thinking young woman at the helm.

Newly separated from her husband, a dazzling countess returns to New York to her cousins wedding, only to find the sensitive groom falling hopelessly in love with her.

When she is employed by the rich and powerful Edward Rochester, she finds herself drawn to his enigmatic, brooding, complex nature, and Rochester is likewise taken by Jane's innocence, inner beauty and strength of character. What follows is an unconventional Victorian romance, a slow-burner, with painful twists and sorrows and a supernatural edge... as there's something stirring in the attic. An intimate and psychologically loaded novel, which reads as an in-depth social commentary and morality tale - a reader is truly immersed in Jane's world. For many, this is the ultimate romantic novel! Show less\n\nIf you like your romances dark, full of mystery with a touch of crime then this Gothic classic is for you!

A naïve young woman is whisked away to a mysterious country estate by an even more mysterious male suitor, she hastily marries him but soon discovers that things aren't all as they seem. A psychological horror with intruiging gender dynamics and a slither of romance. Certain editions of this book also join the ranks of gothic novels which feature a woman in a nightgown lost out in the dark, looking over her shoulder at an ominous mansion with a single lit window (seriously, Google it, it’s a real trope).

But great love cannot be denied, surely? Expect a lot of action, twists, and deaths in this absorbing tale because the course of true love certainly doesn't run smooth for John Ridd and Lorna Doone.

An absolute classic, this is a sweeping romantic story of love, war and adventure. If you like novels with determined, complex, but tremendously flawed protagonists, you'll be gripped by Scarlett's story. The war causes the world as she knew it to crumble around her, but Scarlett is a survivor (and a canny one at that). Disclaimer: includes themes of slavery and racism.

This is a beautifully written story of love, obsession, greed and frivolity, set in the Jazz Age. Semi-autobiographical, this novel has cemented F. Scott Fitzgerald’s legacy as a master craftsman.

If you enjoyed the film then definitely pick up the book, though be prepared for a slightly less optimistic view of things.

The captivating gypsy dancer Esmeralda finds herself in the middle of a love triangle (or pentagon, as it turns out), that could bring nothing but trouble. After catching the eyes of Phoebus (Captain of the Guard), Pierre Gringoire, and Archdeacon Frollo, whose obsessive lust for her is driving him mad and then there is Quasimodo, the hunchback who rings Notre Dame's bells. Quasimodo finds himself in the middle of this tragic love story when Esmeralda shows him kindness and inspires his love. Full of dark twists, bittersweet romances and an appreciation for Gothic architecture, this novel helped to cement Notre Dame de Paris as an enduring icon.
