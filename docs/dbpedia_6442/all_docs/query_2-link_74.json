        "text": "The National Trust has acquired a part of Exmoor that inspired the famous novel, Lorna Doone.\n\nThe nine-acre site was bought for £1.5m before England went into coronavirus lockdown, the trust has revealed.\n\nThe site includes Lorna Doone Farm and the nearby Cloud Farm campsite, which inspired RD Blackmore's novel in 1869.\n\nThe trust said it was likely to be its last acquisition for \"quite some time\" as the lockdown had caused an estimated £200m loss of income this year.\n\nThe novel, which has been turned into several films and television series, is a romance set in the late 17th Century in Devon and Somerset.\n\nIn the book, Blackmore described the deep green valley \"carved from out the mountains in a perfect oval\" and wooded hills \"swept up to the sky-line\" as well as a river that \"glided out from underground with a soft, dark babble\".\n\nApril Braund, visitor experience manager at the National Trust, said: \"RD Blackmore's descriptions of the Exmoor landscapes of rolling hills and deep wooded valleys are at the heart of the site.\"\n\nThe trust plans to improve the local facilities and encourage more people to enjoy the area.\n\nOther scenes from the book that can be picked out in the landscape include Badgworthy, the fictional home of the Doones, which is now a ruined settlement, and a 17th Century stone bridge over the river in Malmsmead.\n\nRob Joules, the National Trust's general manager for the north Devon coast and countryside, said it was \"really exciting\" to take ownership of this place \"just after the 150th anniversary of the book\"."
