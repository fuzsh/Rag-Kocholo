        "text": "Well, that was a long slog through 'Lorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor'. When I skimmed over the Wikipedia entry for 'Lorna Doone', it said that at first RD Blackmore \"experienced difficulty finding a publisher\". All I can say is that it must have been impossible for him to find an editor, because L.D.is way too long. I've no objection to reading a hefty tome as long as it stays on topic, and each part adds something to the developing story, but this is not the case with L.D.\n\nThe story is told in the first person by the protagonist, John Ridd, supposedly some years after the events when he is a much older man. I daresay it might be an accurate portrayal of a man who likes to hear himself talk, relating past events- going into way too much detail, straying off topic, discussing at length subjects which are of interest to him, if not the listener. It makes for some tiring reading, however. Like his characters, Blackmore grew up in the Exmoor region, so his descriptions of it are vivid and realistic, which is great. Also, Blackmore was an avid fruit farmer and so his portrayal of the Ridd's farm and crops is likewise accurate. There's just way too much of it.\n\nIn addition, Blackmore introduces too many disparate plot lines that are not only unimportant to the overarching story, but frequently go nowhere. For example, at one part of the novel, John goes to see the local \"witch\" for advice. Blackmore goes into great detail about the trip to where she lives, John's fear and guilt about consulting her, and about the witch herself, along with their conversation. But John doesn't take her advice, the visit doesn't impact the story in any way, and she never appears again. What was the point? The same thing happens with Uncle Reuben's goldmine. All kinds of page space is taken up with everyone's mystification about his sneaking around, then with his big reveal to John about the mine. I just mentioned briefly John's trip down into the mine, but it really drags on for quite some time, with descriptions of the entire operation, and John's using his great strength to smash a huge rock that no one else can move. Again, it all goes nowhere... near the end of the novel John mentions in an offhand remark that the goldmine petered out and Reuben just broke even on the venture. There is also an odd and entirely useless plot line about Gwenny and her father, which I left out of my summary completely, because it would have taken too long to explain and it literally makes no difference to the story in any way. I can see no point to it unless Blackmore was being paid by the word, in which case he must have done O.K. for himself: Lorna Doone was originally published in three volumes. As a farmer, though, he should have realized that a little pruning does wonders.\n\nAs to the characters in L.D., well, John Ridd will never make my list of favourite literary heroes, but he's a stand-up guy. I know some people resent his dismissive attitude towards the opinions of women (especially his mother and sisters) on issues of the day, but that doesn't bother me. It's never a good idea to project modern sensibilities onto 17th century characters: apart from other issues, it's simply historically inaccurate. At least John is honest enough to admit when one of the women- often Lizzie- has outdone or out thought him, even if he does so with poor grace.\n\nWhat does annoy me a bit is his habit of putting down his own intelligence. Over and over again he remarks on it, though there seems to be little cause: he runs the farm easily and profitably, deals with troubles which crop up, and acquits himself competently if not brilliantly among people of all ranks. He definitely seems at least as intelligent as most of the characters in the book, except perhaps Jeremy Stickles and Ruth. Even Lizzie, who is book smart, doesn't seem to possess much common sense, which often counts for more. Still John keeps bringing up his lack of brains until it becomes tiresome, and you begin to think that he's protesting a bit too much, and it may just be false modesty.\n\nAs for Lorna, well,she seems likable enough, if a little young and silly at times. Part of the problem is that we only see her through John's infatuated eyes, so her character is a bit one dimensional, because John thinks that everything she does is wonderful, and says so. A little of that goes a long way, and there isn't 'a little' of anything in this book. John's descriptions of other people whom he's not in love with contain no gushing, and are therefore more interesting. Frankly, I found the character of Ruth Huckaback to be far more intriguing, and was sorry we didn't spend more time with her.\n\nWhat does irritate me to no end is the attitude John and most of the community take toward the Doones. They seem to accept the Doone's notion that, being descended from a \"noble\" family, they are not bound by the same laws as are ordinary men. I know that they were living in a monarchical, class-based society, but there are limits. The Doones were cut off from all respectable society, and were living as the basest criminals. Treating them as though they were a cut above not only other brigands, but above honest working men as well, merely encouraged their villainy. Frankly, the entire situation would never have developed if they had been treated like everyone else from the start. If an ordinary family had one day shown up, squatted on some land, and immediately started sponging off everybody else, it wouldn't have been tolerated. And when they started stealing, it would have been harshly dealt with. Instead, when the Doones begin taking livestock and whatever else they want, the locals try to appease them by bringing \"gifts\" of food and supplies and leaving them at the entrance of Doone Valley. This merely convinces the Doones that the locals are weak, and encourages their lawlessness. If they had been dealt with then, while they were still relatively few in number and less sure of themselves, it would have been a whole lot easier to get rid of them. By the time John is an adult, though, the Doones are great in number, and well fortified in their valley.\n\nPart of the problem is that the ordinary citizens have no guns while the Doones are well armed and well trained. John is one of the very few men in the area to have a musket, and he only has one because his father found it washed up on shore following the failed Spanish invasion. The government's soldiers are of course armed, but until the Doones inconvenience the State, it is far away and uncaring about the local concerns of Exmoor. It is notable that the only time in the novel a woman escapes from the Doones raiding her farm, it is because her late husband had a gun which she uses, killing one of them. Wherever you stand on gun control, it's hard to argue that people are better off in a society where all the guns are in the hands of the bad guys, or even in the hands of a capricious and frequently unjust government.\n\nWhat I find truly mind-boggling is John's attitude towards the Doones. Despite everything they've done- including killing his father- he seems to share in the delusion that the Doones are a cut above the ordinary. For example, when Counsellor turns up at their farm, John treats him as an honoured guest instead of the treacherous creep he is, partially because he conducts himself like an aristocrat, speaking in lofty, educated tones. His ability to speak well seems to convince John that he will also behave well, though all past experience shows that he won't. Also, after people have finally had enough and push John to confront Carver Doone about the murder of the baby, John is almost apologetic to him at first, worrying that he's not treating the Doones honorably - and then he's shocked when Carver breaks the truce and tries to have him killed, as though he expected better from a thieving, murdering rapist. Finally, when John is engaged in that last, desperate fight with Carver- when he believes Lorna is dead- he still thinks it's the honorable thing to do to wait for Carver to get up off the ground, and to let him land the first blow. It is at these times when I think his intelligence is very much in question. To my way of thinking, when Carver was lying on the ground would have been the perfect time for John to employ what we call around here the \"Cape Breton boxing gloves\", a.k.a.\"putting the boots to him.\" But maybe I just lack empathy for murderers.\n\nThis has been a fairly critical review, but I truly did not dislike 'Lorna Doone'. It is in fact a very compelling story, and contains many really interesting details and exciting scenes. It also incorporates some actual historic events and people, which add realism to the narrative, and give you a sense of the place and time in which it occurs. Blackmore is also skilled at describing the setting, obviously having a great love for the wild beauty of the moorlands. There's just a bit too much of it. I never read abridged versions of books, but I'm willing to admit that 'Lorna Doone' is one novel that would be improved by being pared down a bit. There's a really good story here- it just gets buried sometimes in excess detail and extraneous plot lines.\n\nF.Y.I."
