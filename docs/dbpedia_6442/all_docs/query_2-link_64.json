        "text": "Lorna Doone. Long dark hair, sparkling eyes, creamy-white skin, a kind and caring manner. She's the type of woman any 17th-century man could fall in love with. Indeed, R.D. Blackmore's heroine has been wildly popular since Lorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor was published in 1869.\n\nThrough the years, English schoolgirls have dreamily imagined themselves in her frocks as not one, but two men fight for her love: honest farmer John Ridd and evil lord Carver Doone. She is one of the most romanticized figures in English literature. and since 1920, the novel has been made into eight movies. There are dinnerware and silverware patterns named after her, and, in the English West Country, visitors can stay at the Lorna Doone Caravan Park, or the Lorna Doone Bed and Breakfast.\n\nBut Blackmore's genteel and virtuous heroine was too prissy to appear \"as is\" in A&E's film version of the novel. She's been punched up for a modern audience. \"In the book Lorna is ridiculously perfect, she does nothing wrong,\" says Amelia Warner, the 18-year-old British actress who plays her. \"If she's upset, she doesn't cry, if she's angry, she doesn't shout People like that just don't exist.\" Lorna has become more realistic, says Warner, she's spunkier and not so precious. \"In the book she's a symbol. In the film she's a proper person,\" she adds.\n\nLorna wasn't the only corner of the love triangle to be tweaked. John Ridd (played by Richard Coyle) is insecure and has an inferiority complex, while much is made of Carver Doone's unhealthy obsession for his cousin Lorna. Aidan Gillen stars as the evil Doone, but he's best known as the insatiable, pant-chasing Stuart from Queer As Folk. Gillen does a decent job playing a 17th-century bad guy, but QAF fans will recognize Stuart in every move Gillen makes -- the swagger, the come-hither stare -- it's all the same. So much so that, at first, it's a bit of a shock when Gillen/Doone, tries to wrestle affection from Lorna. You half expect him to pull John Ridd into an embrace.\n\nFull of musket battles, period costumes and smouldering glances, the three-hour film follows the original story. Set in late 17th-century Exmoor, the Doones are a family of aristocratic outlaws who terrorize their peaceful farming neighbours, the Ridds. The feud intensifies for John Ridd when his father is murdered by a Doone. Fate, however, throws a wrench into long-held hatreds when he meets Lorna Doone and falls in love. Their Romeo-and-Juliet love affair continues in secret until Lorna is forced to marry the hated Carver Doone. On the wedding day, Ridd sneaks into Doone Valley and runs off with his lady, but Carver Doone needs to win her back. Unbeknownst to the lady herself, Lorna is of royal stock and a marriage would return the Doones to their ancestral lands.\n\nAfter much bloodshed, Carver fails, but the happy couple are together for only a short time. Eventually Lorna discovers her background and reluctantly returns to London to claim her title and fortune. Separated now by class, distance and unanswered letters, they grow apart.\n\nWhile the chemistry between Coyle and Warner as John and Lorna doesn't exactly sizzle, it sparks when Ridd's misadventures in the failed Protestant rebellion against King James II bring him to London.\n\nIn one of the film's better scenes, Ridd fights his way through the crowd to see Lady Lorna Dugan on her way to Mass. Both stare hungrily at each other as they make eye contact, and the contrast between the two (Ridd is dirty and poor, Lorna stunning in a regal scarlet gown) heightens the melodrama. The two eventually end up together, but the skirmishes that lead up to the union, featuring authentic matchlock and flintlock muskets and period pistols, add a nice bit of action to the historical romance.\n\nA co-production with the BBC, Lorna Doone was filmed mainly on location in Wales. The three-month shoot (longer than usual for a TV-movie) was fraught with weather delays as cast and crew struggled through the mud and mist of Craig Cwm Du (Crag of the Black Valley), a Welsh location that subbed in for Exmoor. \"The weather was a nightmare,\" says Warner, \"it was so unpredictable and you'd have no idea if there'd be freak thunderstorms. We spent so much time sheltering indoors waiting for the rain to stop and then [the crew]would have to scrape all the mud away.\" The remote valley is surrounded by 600 foot-high cliffs and four-wheel drives were needed to get in and out of the shooting location, which, in addition to the horses and fussy period costumes, made filming difficult at times.\n\nA veteran of several period films, including Quills and last year's U.S. cable movie Don Quixote, Warner actually enjoys wearing corsets since they help her get into character. \"It's really good fun and completely transforming. If you are walking around in a corset then you're definitely not yourself you hold yourself in a different way,\" she says.\n\nThe contradiction between keeping the sets, props and costumes as authentic as possible, while sassing up the 17th-century sensibilities of the characters doesn't strike Warner. She says without the changes, Lorna \"would have worn pretty thin.\" But, she adds: \"In the end it's a love story and that will always be relevant.\"\n\nLorna Doone, Sunday, 8 p.m., A&E"
