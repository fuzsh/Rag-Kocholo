Blackmore's famous novel about the 17th. century. The English setting is colourful - but the treatment and the stars are American style. Barbara Hale does her best as Lorna. Richard Greene is more at home in swashbuckling films as John Ridd. Ron Randall has a supporting role as Tom. Direction is by Phil Karlson, more at home with action features and gangster movies. Entertaining in its way but minor.\n\n1. Entertaining costume drama? Action melodrama?\n\n2. The 17th century? England, the countryside, the castle? Special effects, stunt work? Musical score?\n\n3.
