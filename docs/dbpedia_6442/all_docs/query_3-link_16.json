        "text": "1922\n\nEntertaining romantic adventure drama that features some genuinely spectacular set pieces throughout. The love story that dominates the proceedings isn't quite as engaging, but there's just no denying Tourneur's skill for action and suspense sequences.\n\nDon't think I've ever seen a stagecoach chase end in the ocean, which is kind of incredible. That's one of the things I'm enjoying most about this project, finding things I've never seen before, even in productions that are nearly a century old at this point.\n\nR. D. Blackmore's historical novel of Exmoor is at least better served here than in the Ealing film from 12 years later. But even with a few good scenes it's still not the most exciting of films, despite a nice performance from Madge Bellamy in the title role.\n\nStraight-up Griffith lite, the same late-Victorian sentimentality. And moppet worship. Tourneur's landscape-y pictorialism makes it a bit more palatable, but this is very much the kind of movie people are talking about when they say silents are boring.\n\nClassic love story from Maurice Tourneur with all the ingredients needed to make it a good one. But for some reason I kept dropping out. I blame the lackluster leads. John Bowers and Madge Bellamy just didn't do it for me. Otherwise there was plenty of intrigues and a decent production. Just wish there had been more charismatic people to get behind so it could have been a memorable romance.\n\nMaurice Tourneur has become an unjustly forgotten directorial giant of the silent era- and for some reason, this film has met a similar fate. Pictorially, this is just as beautiful as his most-renowned pics of the era (BLUE BIRD, LAST OF THE MOHICANS, etc.) And itâ€™s a fast-paced, engaging story. Filled with many gorgeous shots of both stars and the landscape.\n\nBy no means the most impressive thing I've seen from Maurice Tourneur so far, but it does still have some incredibly beautiful scenery at times. The story is fairly simplistic, but with solid lead performances it's perfectly watchable, even quite enjoyable.\n\nThe productions looks really good. There are some great location shots (though it's clearly not England) and some cool sets. It's a pretty grim tale, but well told. The ending is pretty brutal.\n\nMy only complaint really is the score. I'm not sure if it was composed for the video release, or if it was original, but it was annoying as hell. Like the same handful of notes played on a violin for 90 minutes...it gets old. Really, really old. I'd recommend finding another piece of music to listen to. Ugh.\n\nWatching as part of my Silent Stars on the Walk of Fame challenge/list.\n\nWill write a proper review later, but her's the skinny:\n\n* The first third of the movie is a vast improvement on the first half of the novel, as it streamlines the story and improves upon character motivations\n\n* The rest of the movie takes the streamlining process a little too far, cutting out far more than it needed\n\n* Madge Bellamy is a doll and even today it's easy to see why LORNA DOONE was her star-making role"
