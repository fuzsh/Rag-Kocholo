D. Blackmore, set in the English West Country during the 17th century.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nLorna Doone falls for John Ridd, but is betrothed (against her will) to one Carver Doone. As the English Civil War looms, John is determined to defeat the vicious Doone family and win Lorna over.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBarbara Hale as Lorna Doone\n\nRichard Greene as John Ridd\n\nCarl Benton Reid as Sir Ensor Doone\n\nWilliam Bishop as Carver Doone\n\nRon Randell as Tom Faggus\n\nSean McClory as Charleworth Doone\n\nOnslow Stevens as Counsellor Doone\n\nLester Matthews as King Charles II\n\nJohn Dehner as Baron de Wichehalse\n\nGloria Petroff as Lorna Doone as a Child\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nEdward Small first announced plans to film the novel in 1944[2] and hired George Bruce to write a screenplay in 1946.[3]\n\nIn 1946, Small sent representatives to Britain to scout locations. He said he wanted to make the film on location in Scotland.[4][5] Charles Bennett and George Bruce worked on the early drafts of the script.[6] In 1948, Small said he would make the film as co-production with J Arthur Rank starring Louis Hayward.[7]\n\nIn 1948, Alfred Hitchcock announced plans to film the novel for Transatlantic Pictures. Small claimed he had registered the title in the US; Hitchcock could film the story but would not be able to call it Lorna Doone in the US. This prompted Small to announce he would start filming in England in association with Rank and producer John Beck on 1 March 1949.[8][9] This was postponed due to the US–English film trade war of 1948–19 and in August 1949 filming was put back indefinitely.[10]\n\nThe project was reactivated later in 1949 when Small signed a two-picture deal with Columbia Pictures, for Lorna Doone and The Brigand.[11]\n\nShooting\n\n[edit]\n\nIt was decided to make the movie in Hollywood, with locations shot at Yosemite National Park. Richard Greene and Barbara Hale were cast in the leads and Jesse Lasky Jr did the final draft of the script. Filming began 17 May 1950.[12] The final script was heavily influenced by Westerns.[13]\n\n\"Whatever has been put on screen has been done with considerable loyalty to the novel,\" said Greene. \"I don't think the British public will find too much fault with the treatment. What may be missed is the Cornish atmosphere.\"[14]\n\nRon Randell, who played several leads for Sam Katzman, had a support role.[15]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nReviews were mixed.[16]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
