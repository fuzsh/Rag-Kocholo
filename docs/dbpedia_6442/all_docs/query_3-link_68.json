        "text": "family- his wife Julia, who is a nurse, and their six-year-old son, Johnny, whom he calls \"Little Chief\". Through snatches of news reports, the scene is set: it's October 10th, the World Series is about to start and the Mets are in it, and there have been three murders perpetrated by someone the press has dubbed, \"The Nightingale Killer\", because his victims are all nurses. As well, the aurora borealis (northern lights) are visible for the first time in years, signifying the presence of strong solar storms in the atmosphere. This is all background noise for the Sullivan family's life- going to work, setting up the TV in the backyard and having friends and neighbours over to watch the first game of the Series, Johnny playing ball with his best friend Gordo, and Frank trying to teach his son to ride a bike, unsuccessfully. Julia tells Frank not to push it, that Johnny will learn, \"He just needs to know that you're behind him.\" A statement which foreshadows what is to come.\n\nThe film skips ahead to Oct 10,1999, and we again meet Johnny (Jim Caviezel), now an adult. He's having a bad day- his girlfriend Samantha is in the process of leaving him, though it's obvious that she loves him; she just can no longer handle his inability to commit. He is still living in the house he grew up in, and we learn that his father was killed in a warehouse fire on October 12th, 1969. The house is remarkably unchanged from it's 1969 decor, and this gives us some idea as to John's state of mind. He has never really gotten over the loss of his father; physically he has grown up and become a police officer, but emotionally he has become distant, unwilling to risk being hurt. The only close relationships he maintains are those from his childhood: his mother, now living in an apartment across town, his father's best friend Satch, a police officer who got him onto the force, and his old friend Gordo, who still lives in the community, now married with a son of his own. Career-wise John has done well, now working Homicide with Satch. They have been assigned to the Nightingale Killer case, which has been reopened because a body identified as one of his victims has just been dug up.\n\nThat evening, John sits on the bleachers of the local ball field, drinking and brooding, and watching the northern lights which have reappeared over New York for the first time in thirty years. He goes home to find Gordo and his son are there to borrow his fishing gear. As they dig it out of the closet, they stumble across Frank's N.Y.F.D. trunk which contains, among other things, his father's old ham radio which they set up for old time's sake. After they leave, John starts to tinker with the radio, and ends up talking to another guy who says he's also in Queens. They start talking about baseball, and John is confused because the guy he's talking to doesn't know how the 1969 Series turned out. The man then identifies himself as Frank Sullivan, and John freaks out, thinking that Gordo is pulling some sort of sick joke. Before he can figure out what's going on, he loses the signal.\n\nJohn goes to work the next day, but between the ham radio incident and the upcoming anniversary of his father's death, he's pretty much a mess. That night, he again manages to contact Frank, and realizes that, impossible though it is, he's really talking to his father in 1969. He tries to convince Frank of this by telling him things about their family that only he would know, but Frank naturally enough assumes he's some creepy stalker, and tells John to stay away from his family. Realizing that his father is going to die in the warehouse fire the next day, and desperate to save his life, John tries to make Frank believe him by telling him what's going to happen in the next game of the Series. He then tells the incredulous Frank about the fire. It turns out that there were two possible ways to escape the warehouse and Frank chose the wrong one. Just before Frank cuts him off, he shouts to him not to follow his instincts- to go the other way.\n\nThe next day is October 12. In 1969, Frank goes in for his shift at the firehouse. The game is on, and he watches with growing unease as it plays out exactly as the man claiming to be Johnny said it would. Then, inevitably, the call comes for the warehouse fire. Just as John said, Frank gets trapped while rescuing someone and, remembering his words, Frank goes the opposite way than he had been planning to, and survives the fire.\n\nIn 1999, John is commemorating the day at a bar with Gordo and Satch, sharing memories of Frank. Suddenly he freezes, dropping his drink as he is assailed by competing memories. John remembers his father's death in the fire, but now has alternate memories of Frank living for another twenty years, dying of cancer ten years before. He stammers out a question about his father's death to Gordo and Satch, who look at him like he's lost his mind. They now only remember Frank dying of cancer.\n\nThat night, Frank and John contact each other again, full of wonder and joy. They briefly discuss how this is possible, with Frank saying that their signals must be bouncing off the mother of all sunspots. Hmm. Mostly though, they just spend the evening getting to know each other, man to man, across the years. They talk for hours, bonding over trivial topics like baseball and deeply emotional ones such as how Frank's loss affected John's life.\n\nIt is the best night John's had since he was a kid, and he goes to bed elated. His sleep is troubled, however, by dreams of having attended his mother's funeral as a boy. He wakes up in a cold sweat and tries to call her, but keeps getting a deli. Confused and shaken, he goes to work only to realize that, by saving Frank's life, he has somehow changed the timeline. The Nightingale Killer, who had murdered three women has, in this reality, killed ten times and to his horror, John finds that one of the victims was his mother.\n\nJohn desperately contacts Frank and tells him what has happened, and they try to decide what to do to save not only Julia, but the other six women as well. The problem is, they don't know what exactly caused the change: it could be something that Frank does, or somewhere he goes, or could be Julia being some place or doing something she wouldn't have if she'd been preparing for Frank's funeral. On the plus side, John has the files on all the murdered women and can tell Frank where they will be when they are attacked. Also, if Frank can get evidence on the killer to John, he can use modern methods not available in 1969- like databases- to track him down. The date of Julia's death is Oct 22, 1969, so it is a race against time as Frank and John work the case from both ends. Complicating the investigation is the fact that their weird behaviour is raising concerns and suspicions in both time periods, especially when Frank is found at a murder scene. This leads to a tension filled climax, where the murderer is trying to kill Julia and Frank in 1969, and John in 1999.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, 'Schulz and Peanuts' is a biography of Charles Schulz written by David Michaelis. I was given the book as a gift, and was very excited to read it, because I'm a big Peanuts fan. So read it I did and, well, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. To be fair, Michaelis obviously put a lot of time and effort into researching his subject, and there are parts of the book which I find really interesting. Actually, I quite enjoyed most of the first part of the book, which deals with his rather difficult childhood, his stint in the army, and the tragedy of his mother's death. It was fascinating to get a glimpse of events in Schulz's life which obviously affected his comic strip creations later in life.It is only further on in the book that things take a turn for the... uncomfortable, I guess you'd say. Michaelis spends a lot- a lot - of time focusing on Schulz's unhappy and often unsuccessful relationships with women, and his failed marriage. I hasten to say that I don't expect an honest biography to include only the good stuff and leave out the bad: on the contrary, it should tell the truth about its subject- \"warts and all\". The problem I have with this one is that it seems to focus in on the warts with a microscope, discussing them, their cause and effect, to the exclusion of all else. Probably some of my discomfort with this is my own fault; having grown up on Charles Schultz's works, being made privy to the less pleasant aspects of his personal life was a bit squirm-inducing, not unlike what someone relating to you intimate details of your grandparents' marriage would be.\n\nFor a book about a comic strip creator, however, Michaelis' book is oddly joyless and lacking in any humour. While the author has no difficulty detailing Schulz's sometimes paralyzing self-doubt and depression, he fails to ever bring to life the man who could find self-effacing, and sometimes biting, humour in these circumstances. Michaelis also spends a lot of time finding correlations between what was going on in Schulz's life and what he was drawing in his strip. Some of this is valid; it doesn't take a genius to know that Schulz was often mining personal experience for Peanuts. But Michaelis carries this a bit too far, in my opinion, sometimes exaggerating the importance of a remark or action by Schulz in order to prove his hypotheses. Also, he has an annoying habit of engaging in armchair psychology, in which a lot of his conclusions about Schulz's motivations seem mostly surmise and supposition, based on data which could easily be interpreted in other ways. I might be doing him a disservice, but I got the feeling while reading the book that Michaelis decided early on who Schulz was and why, then went looking for annecdotes and strips which would support his theories.\n\nCharles Schulz's kids and several people who knew him well have reacted badly to this biography, saying that they don't recognize the warm, generous man they remember in Michaelis' portrayal. I suspect that the truth lies somewhere in between- that Charles Schulz had his flawed, angst ridden side described is such great detail by Michaelis, but also had his warm, humorous side so fondly remembered by those who loved him. In short, he was human. This book, unfortunately, just doesn't make time for other, contradictory, facets of his character, which for me, anyway, makes its portrayal of him seem incomplete and sort of flat.\n\nWhatever the true nature of the elusive Mr Schulz, I'm simply glad that he lived, and gave us such a great gift as Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts Gang.\n\nThis is something a little different for me because I don't watch many westerns. I recently picked up a box set of James Stewart movies though, which included Winchester '73, so I sat down the other night and watched it. Somewhat to my surprise, I quite enjoyed it. This isn't the Jimmy Stewart I'm used to seeing in movies like 'You Can't Take It With You' or 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' for example, where he's sweet and a little awkward and naive. Even in the only other western I've seen him in, 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', he had those characteristics. In Winchester '73, however, Stewart is a different man entirely: intense, driven, with an inner darkness only hinted at in the bleakest moments of 'It's A Wonderful Life'.\n\nThe movie opens on July 4th, 1876 with Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his friend 'High Spade' Wilson riding into Dodge City looking for 'Dutch Henry' Brown. They are immediately distracted by a disturbance at the stagecoach, where a man is forcibly putting a protesting saloon girl- Lola- on board to get her out of town. McAdam intervenes, but backs down when the man identifies himself as the marshal, Wyatt Earp. Earp tells McAdam and Wilson that they must hand in their guns for safekeeping while they're in Dodge. They obey, then head into the saloon. Inside, McAdam locks eyes with another man and they both instinctively reach for their guns before remembering that they aren't carrying. It's obvious that this is Dutch Henry, the man McAdam has been looking for. Since they can't do anything to each other with the eyes of the law literally looking on, they both sign up for the Independence Day shooting contest, the prize for which is an 1873 Winchester rifle, and not just regular one, but a \"One of One Thousand\" Winchester, the most perfectly formed and accurate- and rarest- of all rifles.\n\nNot only is 'Dutch Henry' a baddie, he has terrible fashion sense: look at that checkered shirt with the striped pants...yikes.\n\nMcAdam and Brown outclass all the other competitors, and it is commented upon that their shooting styles and accuracy are remarkably similar... as though they had been trained by the same man. This point will become important later on in the film. McAdam eventually wins the competition- and the rifle- and Wyatt Earp tells him that his name will be engraved on the butt of the gun. Knowing that Brown is planning to ride out, McAdam declines having the engraving done so that he can follow his enemy. Unfortunately, he is jumped by Brown and his two cohorts who steal the Winchester and hightail it out of town. Dutch Henry had been going to kill McAdam as well, but the intervention of Wyatt Earp and High Spade stymies his plan.\n\nFrom this point on, the story follows two trails. The first is the path that the rifle takes as it changes hands several times- from Brown to a sleazy arms dealer who sells guns to Indians, to an Indian chief, and then on to a few others. The other path we follow is that of Lin McAdam as he tirelessly tracks Dutch Henry. These two trails occasionally intersect, and in the end, collide violently.\n\nJust as we witness the Winchester changing hands and its effect on those who possess it, so too, we see the consequences- good and bad- resulting from McAdam's hunt and the people he meets while engaged upon it.\n\nOne of these people is Lola, the previously mentioned saloon girl. She wants to escape her lousy life, get married, and have a family. The problem is, her chosen fiance Steve is a weak man, as demonstrated in a moment of jaw-dropping cowardice when, under threat of Indian attack, he panics and runs off, leaving Lola to fend for herself. He is bitterly ashamed of this lapse and tries to atone for it, but Lola can never respect him again. Then of course she meets up with Lin McAdam, and what girl wouldn't prefer Jimmy Stewart? Especially after Steve's moral weakness leads them into another disastrous mess.\n\nLin and High Spade also encounter a cavalry troop, pinned down by the same hostile Indians threatening them, Lola and Steve. The men are all rookies, and their leader, a grizzled veteran of the Civil War, is competent but unused to Indian fighting. Fortunately for them, Lin is able to give them pointers for effectively battling Indians, and together they drive them off. They are aided in this by the strategy employed by most Hollywood Indians of charging straight into the army's firing rifles. Very helpful. In any case, this episode gives us a little more insight into Lin's character and back story. It also provides us with a glimpse of the thoughts and fears which beset the minds of men on the eve of a battle they know they very well may not survive.\n\nOne character who really stands out is the outlaw 'Waco' Johnny Dean, whom Steve is enough of a twit to get involved with. Laughing and pleasant, and slightly unhinged, he treats everything as a joke- including killing people. You can imagine how well this works out for weak- kneed ol' Steve. Dean is played brilliantly by Dan Duryea, who steals every scene he's in, until his final one when he faces Stewart's McAdam. It's a testament to how good James Stewart is in this scene that his violent intensity is more memorable than Duryea's character's smiling villainy.\n\nSpeaking of James Stewart, he is really good at walking a fine line in this movie, portraying his character's dark, unwavering obsession with vengeance, while maintaining a definite likability. We get to see his lighter, more benign side in his honorable and caring behavior towards others, like Lola or the soldiers. We also get to know and like him better through his friendship with his loyal sidekick, High Spade.\n\nThis is important, because for most of the movie, we don't know why McAdam is chasing Brown; we just know that he is determined to kill him. These personal interactions give us insight into who and what he was before his life became focused on this manhunt. This engenders sympathy for his cause before we even know what it is, leading us to conclude that, whatever Brown did, it must have been pretty terrible to drive a good man to such lengths.\n\nTo sum up, 'Winchester '73' is a really good movie, with an engaging plot and characters who have depth and dimension. James Stewart shows in it that he can handle darker movies and roles as well as lighter fare, and his supporting cast is solid as well, some of them- like Duryea- elevating the level of every scene they're in. Definitely one to watch if you're a fan of Jimmy Stewart, westerns, or just good movies in general.\n\nWell, that was a long slog through 'Lorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor'. When I skimmed over the Wikipedia entry for 'Lorna Doone', it said that at first RD Blackmore \"experienced difficulty finding a publisher\". All I can say is that it must have been impossible for him to find an editor, because L.D.is way too long. I've no objection to reading a hefty tome as long as it stays on topic, and each part adds something to the developing story, but this is not the case with L.D.\n\nThe story is told in the first person by the protagonist, John Ridd, supposedly some years after the events when he is a much older man. I daresay it might be an accurate portrayal of a man who likes to hear himself talk, relating past events- going into way too much detail, straying off topic, discussing at length subjects which are of interest to him, if not the listener. It makes for some tiring reading, however. Like his characters, Blackmore grew up in the Exmoor region, so his descriptions of it are vivid and realistic, which is great. Also, Blackmore was an avid fruit farmer and so his portrayal of the Ridd's farm and crops is likewise accurate. There's just way too much of it.\n\nIn addition, Blackmore introduces too many disparate plot lines that are not only unimportant to the overarching story, but frequently go nowhere. For example, at one part of the novel, John goes to see the local \"witch\" for advice. Blackmore goes into great detail about the trip to where she lives, John's fear and guilt about consulting her, and about the witch herself, along with their conversation. But John doesn't take her advice, the visit doesn't impact the story in any way, and she never appears again. What was the point? The same thing happens with Uncle Reuben's goldmine. All kinds of page space is taken up with everyone's mystification about his sneaking around, then with his big reveal to John about the mine. I just mentioned briefly John's trip down into the mine, but it really drags on for quite some time, with descriptions of the entire operation, and John's using his great strength to smash a huge rock that no one else can move. Again, it all goes nowhere... near the end of the novel John mentions in an offhand remark that the goldmine petered out and Reuben just broke even on the venture. There is also an odd and entirely useless plot line about Gwenny and her father, which I left out of my summary completely, because it would have taken too long to explain and it literally makes no difference to the story in any way. I can see no point to it unless Blackmore was being paid by the word, in which case he must have done O.K. for himself: Lorna Doone was originally published in three volumes. As a farmer, though, he should have realized that a little pruning does wonders.\n\nAs to the characters in L.D., well, John Ridd will never make my list of favourite literary heroes, but he's a stand-up guy. I know some people resent his dismissive attitude towards the opinions of women (especially his mother and sisters) on issues of the day, but that doesn't bother me. It's never a good idea to project modern sensibilities onto 17th century characters: apart from other issues, it's simply historically inaccurate. At least John is honest enough to admit when one of the women- often Lizzie- has outdone or out thought him, even if he does so with poor grace.\n\nWhat does annoy me a bit is his habit of putting down his own intelligence. Over and over again he remarks on it, though there seems to be little cause: he runs the farm easily and profitably, deals with troubles which crop up, and acquits himself competently if not brilliantly among people of all ranks. He definitely seems at least as intelligent as most of the characters in the book, except perhaps Jeremy Stickles and Ruth. Even Lizzie, who is book smart, doesn't seem to possess much common sense, which often counts for more. Still John keeps bringing up his lack of brains until it becomes tiresome, and you begin to think that he's protesting a bit too much, and it may just be false modesty.\n\nAs for Lorna, well,she seems likable enough, if a little young and silly at times. Part of the problem is that we only see her through John's infatuated eyes, so her character is a bit one dimensional, because John thinks that everything she does is wonderful, and says so. A little of that goes a long way, and there isn't 'a little' of anything in this book. John's descriptions of other people whom he's not in love with contain no gushing, and are therefore more interesting. Frankly, I found the character of Ruth Huckaback to be far more intriguing, and was sorry we didn't spend more time with her.\n\nWhat does irritate me to no end is the attitude John and most of the community take toward the Doones. They seem to accept the Doone's notion that, being descended from a \"noble\" family, they are not bound by the same laws as are ordinary men. I know that they were living in a monarchical, class-based society, but there are limits. The Doones were cut off from all respectable society, and were living as the basest criminals. Treating them as though they were a cut above not only other brigands, but above honest working men as well, merely encouraged their villainy. Frankly, the entire situation would never have developed if they had been treated like everyone else from the start. If an ordinary family had one day shown up, squatted on some land, and immediately started sponging off everybody else, it wouldn't have been tolerated. And when they started stealing, it would have been harshly dealt with. Instead, when the Doones begin taking livestock and whatever else they want, the locals try to appease them by bringing \"gifts\" of food and supplies and leaving them at the entrance of Doone Valley. This merely convinces the Doones that the locals are weak, and encourages their lawlessness. If they had been dealt with then, while they were still relatively few in number and less sure of themselves, it would have been a whole lot easier to get rid of them. By the time John is an adult, though, the Doones are great in number, and well fortified in their valley.\n\nPart of the problem is that the ordinary citizens have no guns while the Doones are well armed and well trained. John is one of the very few men in the area to have a musket, and he only has one because his father found it washed up on shore following the failed Spanish invasion. The government's soldiers are of course armed, but until the Doones inconvenience the State, it is far away and uncaring about the local concerns of Exmoor. It is notable that the only time in the novel a woman escapes from the Doones raiding her farm, it is because her late husband had a gun which she uses, killing one of them. Wherever you stand on gun control, it's hard to argue that people are better off in a society where all the guns are in the hands of the bad guys, or even in the hands of a capricious and frequently unjust government.\n\nWhat I find truly mind-boggling is John's attitude towards the Doones. Despite everything they've done- including killing his father- he seems to share in the delusion that the Doones are a cut above the ordinary. For example, when Counsellor turns up at their farm, John treats him as an honoured guest instead of the treacherous creep he is, partially because he conducts himself like an aristocrat, speaking in lofty, educated tones. His ability to speak well seems to convince John that he will also behave well, though all past experience shows that he won't. Also, after people have finally had enough and push John to confront Carver Doone about the murder of the baby, John is almost apologetic to him at first, worrying that he's not treating the Doones honorably - and then he's shocked when Carver breaks the truce and tries to have him killed, as though he expected better from a thieving, murdering rapist. Finally, when John is engaged in that last, desperate fight with Carver- when he believes Lorna is dead- he still thinks it's the honorable thing to do to wait for Carver to get up off the ground, and to let him land the first blow. It is at these times when I think his intelligence is very much in question. To my way of thinking, when Carver was lying on the ground would have been the perfect time for John to employ what we call around here the \"Cape Breton boxing gloves\", a.k.a.\"putting the boots to him.\" But maybe I just lack empathy for murderers.\n\nThis has been a fairly critical review, but I truly did not dislike 'Lorna Doone'. It is in fact a very compelling story, and contains many really interesting details and exciting scenes. It also incorporates some actual historic events and people, which add realism to the narrative, and give you a sense of the place and time in which it occurs. Blackmore is also skilled at describing the setting, obviously having a great love for the wild beauty of the moorlands. There's just a bit too much of it. I never read abridged versions of books, but I'm willing to admit that 'Lorna Doone' is one novel that would be improved by being pared down a bit. There's a really good story here- it just gets buried sometimes in excess detail and extraneous plot lines.\n\nF.Y.I.\n\n* There is some disagreement over whether the Doones were an actual family of criminals in the Exmoor region or if they were fictional. Certainly there is an oral tradition in the area of a family called Doune or Doone which came from Scotland and preyed on the local citizens, and Blackmore would have heard these tales as a boy.\n\n* Tom Faggus was an actual highwayman of the time, who did indeed possess a remarkably loyal mare named Winnie. Many of his exploits in 'Lorna Doone' were factual ones, though Blackmore did change his fate. In real life, instead of marrying and settling down, Faggus was caught and hanged for his crimes.\n\n* Lorna Doone has a cookie named after her, something not many fictional characters can boast of:\n\nThe Lorna drama is put on hold for a while, because it's time for Annie's wedding. John goes to see Ruth and Reuben to invite them to the wedding, and he is shocked by the change in Uncle Ben, who is a shadow of his former self. He does, however, find out what Reuben's been so mysterious about; Ben takes him out to a remote part of the moor where he has discovered gold and secretly has men mining it. John goes underground with him to see the mine, but wants nothing to do with it, hating the feeling of being trapped under the ground.\n\nAfter Annie's wedding, life returns to normal and they ignore Lorna's summons to London. Then, when John returns from being at a wrestling match, he finds Lorna gone. While he was away , men from the King's court arrived and insisted that she return with them to London. Lorna has left him a letter in which she explains that her great uncle, who is a powerful lord, is her guardian until she's 21, and she must live under his care. She had pleaded with the messengers to leave her at Plover's Barrows, but they had their orders. Jeremy Stickles, who is now up and about, has also received orders from the Court to send her to London. Lorna concludes her letter by telling John never to doubt her love for him.\n\nMonths go by and, mourning the loss of Lorna, John goes to visit Annie and pour out his woes, then goes on to see Reuben and Ruth. Ben is a bit sour, not having forgiven John for refusing to help with the mine. Ruth, however, listens sympathetically to his story and despite her own hurt advises John to follow Lorna to London and woo her. The farm work must be done, though, heartbreak notwithstanding, and John is soon busy bringing in the harvest. At first they worry that the Doones will retaliate and burn the farm, but it turns out they are too busy fortifying their defenses, assuming the government will be sending more- and better- troops. This probably would have happened, but King Charles suddenly dies, throwing the country into turmoil.\n\nRebellion breaks out as the Duke of Monmouth raises an army and challenges the King. John would like to keep out of the trouble and stick to farming, but that proves impossible. Annie (who now has a baby) arrives at the farm in a panic. Tom, apparently tired of the quiet life, has ridden off to join the rebels. Annie tearfully begs John to go after him and bring him home. John reluctantly does so, riding to where the battle is taking place to try to find him. The fight is going badly for the rebels, and they are in retreat. John finds Tom's horse, Winnie, who leads him to where Tom is lying, gravely wounded. John carries him to an abandoned cottage and bandages him up, then puts him on Winnie and sends them off. Unfortunately, some of the king's soldiers find John and assume that he's a rebel. They are about to hang him when Jeremy Stickles shows up and saves him. Jeremy takes him to London with him,and John hopes that he will be able to see Lorna.\n\nFiguring that Lorna will be in church on Sunday, John goes to the cathedral. The King and his party enter the church, and Lorna is with them. Their eyes meet, and hers fill with tears. Later John receives a letter from Lorna asking him to meet her. He goes to her uncle,Earl Brandir's house and is let in by Gwenny, who seems rather hostile. John and Lorna have a joyous reunion, but then she demands to know why he hasn't come to see her, or at least written her, in a year. John says he didn't know where she was, and she is shocked: she has been sending him letters all along. It turns out that Gwenny was not posting them, thinking that John was not good enough for Lorna. Lorna convinces John that she still loves him, and invites him to come to dinner and meet her uncle. He does so, and the Earl takes to him, though not realizing what his intentions are. Lorna confides in John that the man who she had seen Carver kill was the Earl's son. She is afraid to tell him, however, because her uncle lives in hope that his son will return. After leaving the Earl's house, John sees some men casing the place. He follows them, and that night they break in to rob the Earl, threatening him with a gun. John rescues him, and it turns out the thieves were enemies of the King. As a reward, the King knights John.\n\nJohn gets a letter from his mother containing all the local news, including the fact that Tom Faggus is home and healing, a chastened and wiser man. Despite his new position, John yearns to return to the farm and his responsibilities there. Sadly, Lorna is still bound to stay in London, so they must temporarily part. Back at Plover's Barrow, his knighthood is the subject of much talk, but people settle down when John acts just the same as he always did.\n\nThe Doones, having been quiet since the rebellion, when six of them were caught and hanged for supporting Monmouth, are now returning to their habitual villainy. On one of their raids, they abduct two respectable young girls, which upsets the community. Then worse happens: the Doones attack the home of a local farmer who is away, carrying off his wife and killing his infant son for \"fun\". This is the final straw, and the people of the community rally around John, looking to him for leadership. He doesn't want to lead them, and tells them to go to the magistrates, but the people know that they are useless. They convince John to go to the Doones and demand that Mistress Margery be returned, and the man who killed the baby turned over to them. Reluctantly, John goes to Doone Valley under a flag of truce and meets with Carver. Carver sneeringly rejects the idea of the Doones being held to the same standards as ordinary men, or that they should be punished for their \" youthful frolic\". Not only does he refuse John's terms, he orders his men to kill him, and they start shooting. John manages to escape, but the die is cast- they will attack the Doones.\n\nMen from all over the district come to join the assault on Doone Valley, their outrage over years of abuse and loss at the hands of the Doones finally boiling over. Tom Faggus comes to help, as does Uncle Ben, bringing men from his mine. Mindful of the failure of the previous attack on the valley, they carefully plan this one. Tom will lead a night attack on the Doones from the front, drawing them out, while John will take a company of men up his secret way into the valley to surprise them from behind. The plan works beautifully, and though the Doones fight fiercely, they are outnumbered and outmaneuvered. John catches Counsellor Doone, and tells him that he will let him go free if he gives him Lorna's necklace and tells him who killed his father. Counsellor says that Carver killed John's father, and that he also has taken the necklace.John believes the first statement but not the second, and searches Counsellor, who tries to stab him. John takes the necklace from him but then relents, giving Counsellor one of the jewels from it and letting him go. He is never heard from again.The women and children in the valley are taken to safety, including Carver Doone's ten \"wives\" which he had taken over the years- really, I don't know how Lorna let that prize get away. The Doone men are all killed and their houses burned to the ground. The only exception is Carver Doone, who wasn't in the valley when the attack started, and managed to escape. The women and children are treated with care and compassion, many returning to the families which they had been taken from. A small boy named Ensie- a son of Carver whose mother is dead- ends up living at Plover's Barrow with the Ridds, as he has nowhere else to go.\n\nTo make John's happiness complete, soon after this Lorna returns. Her guardian has died, and she successfully petitioned the King to allow her to return to Exmoor. Unwilling to wait any longer, they quickly organize their wedding, with help from John's mother and sisters, and even Ruth Huckaback, who is persuaded to come. In their local church, surrounded by family and friends, the happy couple are wed. Just as they finish their vows, however, a shot rings out and Lorna falls into John's arms. Carver Doone has entered the church unseen and shot her.\n\nJohn holds Lorna as she grows cold and still, then gets up and leaves the church, bent only on revenge. He mounts his horse and, unarmed, rides after Carver. Spurring his horse into a furious gallop, he soon has Carver in sight: he is headed for the dangerous part of the moor, and has little Ensie, whom he snatched at the church, with him. Poor Ensie, spying John, reaches his hands back toward him, as afraid of his father as anyone else. John corners Carver, who turns and rides toward him, firing his pistol. John is hit, but it doesn't stop him. With a huge branch he rips from a tree, he knocks Carver from his horse, and after sending Ensie a distance away so he won't witness it, engages in a fight to the death with him. Such is the power of his rage and anguish that even with a bullet wound and broken rib, John beats Carver. He is going to let Carver live, but without realizing it their fierce struggle has left them teetering on the edge of the dangerous sinkhole. John barely manages to leap clear, and Carver falls in on his back, slowly sinking and suffocating in the sucking mud. Good riddance, say I.\n\nJohn takes Ensie and rides back home, weakened from blood loss and grief. Thanks to Ruth, however, Lorna is still alive. Despite the doctor having declared her dead, Ruth works on Lorna, removing the bullet and cleaning and bandaging the wound herself. Lorna begins to come around, and Ruth cares for her day in and day out until she recovers. Indeed, she ends up healing faster than John, because while Ruth is busy taking care of Lorna, John is left to the tender mercies of the doctor, who is an idiot. He nearly kills John with blood loss by bleeding him constantly before a horrified Ruth realizes what's going on and puts a stop to it.\n\nIn the end, all is well. John and Lorna are reunited, and settle happily on the farm, saving most of Lorna's money as an inheritance for their children. Tom Faggus, with help from Jeremy Stickles, obtains a new pardon and settles down with Annie to raise their family, and Lizzie ends up marrying the Captain of the guards who was stationed at Plover's Barrows during their trouble with the Doones. Ruth remains single, inheriting Reuben's wealth when he dies, but John relates that there is a worthy local man who has fallen in love with her, and whom he thinks will eventually win her hand. John sends Ensie to school, and though he is heir to the Doone lands and title, he does not claim them, or even go by the name Doone, as he thinks of John as his father.\n\nLorna settles happily into life on the Ridd's farm, although everyone is uneasily aware that, once the weather improves, the Doones are likely going to attack the farm in revenge.\n\nEarly in the spring, Tom Faggus comes to discuss setting a wedding date, and meets Lora for the first time. He is sure that he's seen her before- when she was a child- but cannot remember the occasion. He also tells them that the necklace which Lorna got back from Sir Ensor is not glass beads: it is made of 25 rare, pure diamonds and is worth a king's ransom. As a reformed highwayman, Tom knows quality jewels when he sees them. They assume that the Doones must have stolen the necklace from one of their many victims.\n\nAfter Tom leaves, Jeremy Stickles arrives with bad news. He cannot get any government troops assigned to him to move against the Doones for some time yet. He recommends that John start setting guards around the farm and keep watch at night. He also suggests that John ride over to the village where Stickles' own men, few though they be, are stationed and tell them to come to the farm. John does so, but uneasy about being away, rides back home ahead of them. He arrives to find the women badly shaken. Earlier, while in the farmyard, Lorna had looked up to find Carver leering at her from across the flooded brook. He pointed a gun at her and shouted that, if she didn't come back, she and everyone else on the farm would be killed. What a charmer. Lorna offers to go back to save all of them, but is of course not allowed to do so.\n\nJeremy's men arrive and the farm becomes an armed camp as they wait for the inevitable attack. One night as John stands watch, the Doones ride in, planning to kill the men, take the women and burn the farm, not realizing that Stickles and his men are there. John has his musket trained on Carver, but can't bring himself to pull the trigger. Jeremy and his men have no such scruples and open fire, killing two Doones. John confronts Carver physically, throwing him to the ground before being slightly wounded by a gun shot. The Doones, unused to meeting with resistance, retreat, leaving behind the dead, and two more who are wounded.\n\nMore men arrive to defend Plover's Barrow, and it is doubtful that the Doones will attack again while it would be a fair fight. John takes advantage of the temporary peace to ride to Dulverton to visit Uncle Reuben. Ruth greets him warmly, but Ben is not there. Ruth says that her grandfather has been acting oddly for the last six months, coming and going at odd times and not taking interest in the business. While waiting for Ben to show up, John tells Ruth about Lorna. In love with John herself, and having harboured some hope in that regard due to his mother's meddling, Ruth is devastated by this news but tries to hide it and wishes him well.\n\nJohn waits as long as he can but Reuben never shows up, so he heads back home. He arrives to find Counsellor Doone at the farm. He is laying on the charm, but has really come to try to cause trouble between John and Lorna by telling them that each of their fathers was killed by the other. Lorna says that she doesn't believe him, because all the Doones are liars, and that even if it's true, it won't change how she and John feel. Incredibly, instead of kicking him out the door, or better yet, calling the soldiers to arrest him, they let him spend the night. He repays this hospitality by tricking Annie into showing him Lorna's necklace, which he of course steals.\n\nJeremy Stickles returns, and he has a strange story to relate. While travelling, he stopped at an inn for a night and was surprised to find the innkeeper's wife was a foreign woman. He struck up a conversation with her, and she told him how she ended up in rural England. As a girl, she had worked in a hotel in her homeland of Italy. A rich English family staying at the hotel hired her to be the wife's maid and help with her two children ( a boy and a girl). While travelling through France, the gentleman was killed in an accident, and his grief stricken wife decided to return to England, bringing Benita (the maid) with her. While travelling through the Exmoor region, their coach was attacked by highwaymen, and the lady put her expensive necklace around her little girl's neck to hide it. While trying to outrun the highwaymen, the coachman lost control of the carriage and it plunged into the sea, overturning. The little boy was killed in the accident, and the little girl could not be found. Shock and grief killed the lady, and she and her son were buried together. Benita stayed in the area and married. Jeremy deduces from this tale that the highwaymen were the Doones, and they took the little girl with the necklace, who was obviously Lorna. Shocked, John realizes that this was the family he had seen as a boy, and Lorna the little girl he had seen tossed over the saddle of one of the Doone raiders.\n\nThere is no time to dwell on this, however, because Jeremy has raised a force of fighting men and together with his troops and some of the local civilians, is ready to attack Doone Valley. John goes with them and they march on the Doones. Unfortunately, the battle ends in disaster. The civilians are untrained, and the soldiers who are from two separate regiments regard each other as rivals and don't work together. On the other hand, the Doones have trained in warfare since childhood and fight as one. It is a complete rout, and many are killed. Jeremy Stickles is badly injured, and John takes him back to the farm where he spends a long time healing, and is never completely well again.\n\nWhile they are recuperating- mentally and physically- from this defeat, messengers arrive from His Majesty's Court of Chancery in London. Word has reached the court of Lorna's identity, and as she is a great heiress, they insist that she must come to London. John has not told Lorna Jeremy's story up to this point, but does so now, and tells her that she is too high in rank to marry him. Lorna insists that she only wants to be his wife, and is mostly relieved that their fathers had not killed each other. Jeremy Stickles is in no condition to testify as to what he discovered, so John tracks down Benita and brings her to the farm. She and Lorna recognize each other, so there is no doubt that Lorna is the Countess of Dugal.\n\nBack on the farm, John gets a shock when his sister, Annie, confides in him that she and Tom Faggus are in love, and plan to be married. John is not happy. Though Tom is no longer a highwayman, and has settled on a farm and applied for a pardon, John doesn't think he is husband material for Annie. He tells her so, and is even more shocked when Annie retorts that, if Tom is ineligible, what is the daughter of a Doone? John had believed his trips to Doone Valley to be totally secret, but Tom Faggus has seen him and told Annie. After arguing, John and Annie make up, ruefully acknowledging that their mother is going to be horrified by both of them.\n\nUncle Reuben comes to visit, bringing his seventeen-year-old granddaughter, Ruth, with him. She seems very shy, and John kindly tries to make her feel at home. Unfortunately, this is misinterpreted by Ruth, mostly because John's mother is trying to play matchmaker. Ruth will inherit all Reuben's wealth, and Mrs. Ridd thinks she would be an excellent wife for John. Meanwhile, Uncle Ben is acting very strangely. He goes out every day on horseback, stays for long hours, and comes back mudspattered and weary, yet not telling anyone what he's been up to. Annie, Lizzie, and Ruth, are very curious and convince the hired man, John Frye, to follow him. He trails him to a remote and dangerous section of the moor, where there is a terrible sinking hole which will suck in anyone caught in it. He loses Reuben and gets frightened away, so the girls and John are still in the dark as to what Reuben is up to.\n\nJohn sneaks back to the valley to see Lorna, and to his delight, she finally tells him that she loves him, though she feels the situation is hopeless. John, however, returns home filled with joy. He arrives to find the farm in an uproar. Tom Faggus is there, and he and Annie have told Mrs. Ridd of their wish to be married. She takes it badly. Annie begs John to help them, and he does, by telling his mother about Lorna, which shocks her into forgetting about Annie. Eventually, she calms down and resigns herself to both John's and Annie's choices.\n\nAlarmed by not finding Lorna at their usual meeting place, John slips deep into Doone Valley to Sir Ensor's house, where Lorna lives. He speaks to her through the window, which has recently had bars put across it. Lorna tells him that because Ensor is close to death, Counsellor and Carver are trying to force her into marriage. She is kept virtually a prisoner, and the last time she stepped outside the door, Carver tried to grab her.\n\nDeeply concerned, John arranges to have her maid Gwenny put up a signal where he can see it from the farm if she is in trouble and needs him.\n\nJeremy Stickles is back in Exmoor, investigating the rumours of rebellion. King Charles II, a Protestant, has named his brother James, who is Catholic, as his heir. This has angered many Protestants, who back the Duke of Monmouth, the King's illegitimate son, against James. The Doones have decided to throw in with Monmouth, not out of religious conviction, but because they feel he will reward them with power and position. They plot to kill Jeremy, who is a representative of the government. Fortunately, John spots the Doone men lying in wait for Jeremy, and manages to warn him in time to escape from them. He confides to John that he intends to lead a force against Doone Valley and destroy them. John is shocked at that idea, and extremely worried about what that will mean for Lorna.\n\nOne day, John looks up and sees the signal. He heads for Doone Valley and is met by Gwenny, who tells him that because Sir Ensor is on his death bed, Lorna has told him about her love for John. Sir Ensor has demanded to see him, so for the first time, John walks into Doone Valley openly, and goes to Sir Ensor's door. Sir Ensor tells John that, as a Doone, Lorna is of much higher rank than he, and so their marriage is unthinkable. He demands that John swear that he will never see Lorna again., but they refuse to give each other up, and Sir Ensor tells them that they're fools. Before he dies, however, he calls Lorna and John to his bedside and gives them Lorna's necklace which he has been keeping for her. After Sir Ensor's funeral, John quickly leaves the valley before Carver and the other Doones can attack him.\n\nIt is now winter, and the hardest one that anyone can remember having. John and his men have all they can do trying to keep the sheep and other farm animals from freezing to death. John is also worried, because the snow is so deep that he can't get through to check on Lorna. His sister Lizzie comes to the rescue, though, having read in one of her books about snowshoes, and instructing John on how to make a pair. Once he's mastered walking on them, he heads for Doone Valley. He finds Lorna and Gwenny in a bad way: Carver is now trying to starve Lorna into marrying him, and the girls are weak with hunger. John gives them what food he has and tells them to get ready; he will come back after dark to get them out of there. When John returns with a sled, he finds that two of Carver's minions have forced their way into the house and the girls are trying to fight them off. Enraged, John fells one of them and throws the other through the window. He then puts the girls in the sled and they make their escape to Plover's Barrows, where the two girls are taken in and cared for by John's mother and sisters."
