        "text": "Shoddily directed and dramatically inept adaptation which can lay claim to some of the dodgiest wigs in cinema history. How was I meant to listen to the words coming from leading man John Loder's wooden lips when all I could do was stare in horror at the hairy creature lying dead on top of his head? Minor compensation comes with early roles for Roger Livesey and Jack Hawkins, and the debut of one Margaret Lockwood.\n\nIt must've been a nightmare being a peasant farmworker in the 17th century. Not the hard work of course, but all the incessant singing, dancing and frolicking - find me the highest peak on Exmoor (Dunkery Beacon as you asked) so I can jump off instead please.\n\nTo call this clunky would be giving clunks a bad name, in the early days of British Cinema no one gave his all in the pursuit of premium clunkering quite like Basil Dean, probably a subconscious nod to his esteemed theatre background. With that qualification in mind there's still much to enjoy beyond the pantomime villain nonsense in this early Ealing caper. A vast array of comical wigs, Olympic standard thigh slapping, the screen debut of Margaret Lockwood, a starring role for the cutesie (and Mrs Basil Dean) Victoria Hopper but, best of all, the stunning Somerset scenery.\n\nA well-crafted film that brings home the extent to which R.D. Blackmore's novel begat a thousand westerns. Armed outlaws gallop across the prairie (Exmoor); poor farmers are oppressed by these bullies; but eventually a man arises who does what needs to be done. The 17th century costumes, strange landscapes and leering faces in POV also suggest folk horror. It suffers, unfortunately, from some odd choices in editing â€“ fights and riding scenes are often sped up with ridiculous effect. Acting, production design and location photography are all good, however, and this film deserves to be better known. What does it tell us about the West Country? That it is wild. And that it has, or had, a culture of its own."
