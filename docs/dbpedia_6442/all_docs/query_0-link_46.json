John D. Wallace, representative from Pembina county was among half a dozen of the best members of the house judged from every possible standpoint. He was true, active, earnest, voting with the best element of his party, voting for the best interests of the state, as he saw those interests, under all circumstances. He was in no combinations to defeat good legislation, in none to promote bad, but was honest, earnest, practical and effective in support of everything that was good and in opposition to everything that was bad. Mr. Wallace was born in Ponsonby, Wellington county, Onatio, Feb. 24, 1845, of Anglo-Scotch parentage, and was educated in the Canadian common schools. He came to the United States in 1880, and located at Drayton, Pembina county, in 1881, where he has since been engaged in farming and stock growing. He has a farm of 800 acres, mostly devoted to wheat and feeds live stock on a small scale. He was elected county commissioner in 1884 and held two successive terms, and was a member of the state board of equalization in 1895. He was elected to the legislature in 1896. His committee assignments appear elsewhere.\"\n\n-------------\n\nFrom History of Long Island: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time, 1903, vol. III, p. 114 :\n\n\"George Wallace is descended from a Scotch family which has contributed members to every honorable and useful walk of life. His father, Donald Wallace, a native of Scotland, born in 1816, recently died in California, in the eighty-seventh year of his age. He reared a family of nine children, all but one of whom are living and occupying excellent business and social positions. The youngest son, a member of Roosevelt's 'Rough Riders' regiment, lost his life in the Spanish-American war. The eldest, John D., has long been a prominent business man and a leader in Republican councils in North Dakota, and is now the county judge of Pembina county; Charles L. is editor of the leading Republican newspaper in Nassau county, at Rockville Center, also a prominent operator in real estate. Albert J. and Frank S., as the firm of Wallace Bros., are at the head of large business enterprises at Los Angeles, Pasadena and elsewhere in California. Lavinia M. is the wife of R. H. Young, editor of the 'Methodist Herald,' of Minneapolis, Minnesota; Matilda H. is the wife of the Rev. James Healy, a Methodist Episcopal clergyman filling a pastorate in Southern California; and Mary A. is wife of S. Frank Johnson, a banker at Pasadena, California.\"\n\n-------\n\nObituary published in a newspaper in Long Beach, California, date unknown (clipping about 1907).\n\nJohn D. Wallace\n\nJohn D.

This was bought on October 3, 1843 from Oliver and Mary Lasby for 2 pounds and was three-quarters of an acre. The church trustees at that time were Hugh and Donald Wallace, Samuel Cunningham, Robert Fasken and Thomas Moore. On the tombstones in this cemetery we find names of some of the pioneer families. These include John Allen - died 1875; Joseph Hall - d 1861 aged 41 years; Thomas Howse - d 1874; Mary Peckover (Howse) - d 1855; Ann Howse (sister of Thomas) - d 1881 at 93 years,Levi Patmore-d 1872; Mary, wife of Joseph Lasby --d 1876; Joseph Lasby -d 1876, and many others. This cemetery was used until about 1888.\n\nAt that time, the Bethany Church belonged to the Elora Circuit and services were held in a log school house that was situated on the farm now owned by Stanley Steen, Lot 9, Con. 2, Pilkington Township.\n\nThe first church was built of stone and was situated on Lot 9, Con. 2 Pilkington Township on the farm now owned by Kenneth Barton (Alvin Skerritt). This property was seventy feet square and was bought from Joseph Lasby on the 13th day of February 1863 for twenty dollars. The trustees at this time were Donald and Hugh Wallace, Joseph Lasby, Thomas and Edmund Hall, Gilgian Bettchen and William Bye. The minister was Rev. R. Forman.\n\nOwing to the nature of the land, a good foundation had not been built under this church and a new site soon had to be chosen. On the 9th of December, 1875, three-eights of an acre of land was purchased for Fifty Dollars from William Thacker and his mother Catherine, widow of John Thacker. The present church was built of red brick in 1876 with Rev. Thomas Cobb as minister and the trustees were Gilgian and Joseph Bettchen, Hugh and John D. Wallace, Donald McKay, William Bye, Charles Nicklin, William Martin, Edward and Henry Patmore Benjamin Fyfe, Henry Hall and Joseph Lasby. The corner stone of the new church was laid by Col. Charles Clarke, member of the Provincial Legislature.\n\n-----------------------\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n Religion: a Methodist.\n\n Political Party:Republican.\n\n Census: Canada, 1871, Pilkington, Wellington, Ontario, Canada. 98\n\n Residence: 1871, Pilkington Twp, Wellington, Ontario, Canada.\n\n Marriage: 10 Feb 1873, Pilkington Twp, Wellington, Ontario, Canada. 99 (Witness)\n\n Owned: 50 acres of Lot 9S in Concession I, 1877, Pilkington Twp, Wellington, Ontario, Canada. 100\n\n Occupation: farmer, 1877, Wellington, Ontario, Canada.\n\n Moved: from Ponsonby to Elora, five miles distant, 1879, Elora (Centre Wellington), Nichol Twp, Wellington, Ontario, Canada.\n\n Immigrated: from Canada to the United States, 1880.\n\n Moved: from Elora to Lincoln, 10 miles distant, Nov 1880, Lincoln, Lancaster, Nebraska, United States.\n\n Moved: from Lincoln to Drayton, Feb 1881, Drayton, Pembina, Dakota Territory [North Dakota], United States.\n\n Settled: on a homestead one mile from town, Apr 1881, Drayton, Pembina, Dakota Territory [North Dakota], United States.\n\n Occupation: Farmer and stockman, 1881-1905, Drayton, Pembina, North Dakota, United States.\n\n Acquired: Homestead patent, 21 Oct 1881, Drayton, Pembina, Dakota Territory (North Dakota), United States. 33\n\n Served: as County Commissioner, 1884-1892, Pembina, North Dakota, United States.\n\n Sold: original farm, Dec 1887, Drayton, Pembina, Dakota Territory [North Dakota], United States.\n\n Bought: other farms totalling 800 acres, Mar 1888, Drayton, Pembina, Dakota Territory [North Dakota], United States.\n\n Served: as member of the Assembly, North Dakota, United States.\n\n Occupation: Judge of probate court, Pembina, North Dakota, United States.\n\n Served: on the state board of equalization, 1895, North Dakota, United States.\n\n Delegate: to the Methodist General Conference representing North Dakota, 1896, United States.\n\n Served: in the State Senate, representing the First District, 1897-1899, North Dakota, United States.\n\n Census: U.S., 26 Jun 1900, Drayton, Pembina, North Dakota, United States. 101\n\n Residence: 1903, North Dakota, United States.\n\n Occupation: County Judge, 1903, Pembina, North Dakota, United States.\n\n Moved: from Drayton, North Dakota, Abt 1905, Long Beach, Los Angeles, California, United States.\n\n Residence: 1906, Long Beach, Los Angeles, California, United States.\n\n Residence: 408 Chestnut Avenue, 1907, Long Beach, Los Angeles, California, United States.\n\nJohn married Hannah Patmore 29 before 1869.

However, the 1871 census gives his age as 27. It seems likely that he was born in 1843 instead (a misreading of the gravestone?).\n\nThe entry for Curtis in the Curtis Poapst family Bible is not entirely clear. It could be 1843 or 1848. I'm interpreting it as 1843. The \"3\" looks the same as in Edith Pearl Poapst's birth date in the same hand.\n\nLorna Wallace family tree has b. July, 1848 in Lunenburg, Ontario, Canada, but I think she erred. Other sources (e.g., Rosemary Benson) have 1843. Rosemary Benson did a great deal of research and may be right.\n\nhttp://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~poaps/Notices.htm, etc. has tombstone inscription from Poapst homestead, [Osnabruck Twp., Stormont Co.,] Ontario.\n\nSee also http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=:3047155&id=I582489045, seems authoritative.

Wallace, editor of the 'South Side Observer' of Rockville Center, Long Island, was born in Ponsonby, Ontario, December 13, 1855, a son of Donald and Harriet (Lasby) Wallace. His paternal grandparents were George and Margaret Wallace, who were natives of Scotland, and his maternal grandparents were Charles and Mary Lasby, natives of England. Donald Wallace, father of Charles L. Wallace, was born in Ross-shire, Scotland, February 14, 1816, from whence he emigrated to Caracas, South America, and thence to Ontario, and he subsequently removed to Pasadena, California.

Wallace.\"\n\n----------\n\nFrom \"Bethany History\" (http://www.bethanyuc.org/Sub/bethany_history_1.htm):\n\nOur first record of Bethany Church, then Methodist, was for the purchase of the lot for the Cemetery at Ponsonby. This was bought on October 3, 1843 from Oliver and Mary Lasby for 2 pounds and was three-quarters of an acre. The church trustees at that time were Hugh and Donald Wallace, Samuel Cunningham, Robert Fasken and Thomas Moore. On the tombstones in this cemetery we find names of some of the pioneer families.

The trustees at this time were Donald and Hugh Wallace, Joseph Lasby, Thomas and Edmund Hall, Gilgian Bettchen and William Bye. The minister was Rev. R. Forman.\n\nOwing to the nature of the land, a good foundation had not been built under this church and a new site soon had to be chosen. On the 9th of December, 1875, three-eights of an acre of land was purchased for Fifty Dollars from William Thacker and his mother Catherine, widow of John Thacker. The present church was built of red brick in 1876 with Rev. Thomas Cobb as minister and the trustees were Gilgian and Joseph Bettchen, Hugh and John D.
