        "text": "This thesis investigates how the interiority of emotion and overarching premise in literature is visualised in the novel to film adaptation process. It specifically looks at the varied collaborative stages of filmmaking - from development, screenwriting, pre production and principal photography, as a way of acknowledging the process and contribution of the film crew as novel is turned into film. By investigating the interpretive choices and decisions of three specific roles - the screenwriter, cinematographer and director - I break down the contributions and collaborations of these key creative practitioners at distinctive moments of the production process, to gain a greater understanding of how the translation of emotion and premise interiority from novel to screen occurs.\n\nWhen a novel is adapted into a film, the first stage of that process is the screenplay. The screenwriter considers ways to visualise the interiority of the novel such that it can be filmed and made visible. She writes for a small readership of technically proficient creative crew, such as the cinematographer, whose job it will be to visualise the internal of the screenplay words. As a trained cinematographer wanting to investigate this pre-production stage of filmmaking,I sought permission from one of Australia's acclaimed novelists, Rodney Hall, to use his novel Love Without Hope to adapt into a feature length screenplay. What started as practice led research into how the interiority of a novel could be visualised, becamea creative high jacking of Hall's plot and characters,as I gave myself permission to follow threads in the novel that triggered something in me, not just as a woman, but also about my country, Australia, coming to terms with its past. This paper looks at creative practice and process, and the role of self in the decision making and emotional reactions to source material when adapting a novel to a screenplay\n\nThis study of Bearwalls Farm takes its history back to 1711, but its origins still remain obscure. A foundation date sometime in the 17th century is not improbable. Owners before the War Department, who acquired the property in the early 20th century, included Tremayne of Sydenham and Radford of Lydford. Families in residence had links to Bridestowe, Coryton, Kelly, Lamerton, Lewtrenchard, Lydford, Marystow, Peter Tavy and elsewhere. The field system has been largely unchanged for at least 170 years. The core dwellinghouse may well date to the 17th century and includes large fireplaces (blocked), a cloam/bread oven and some likely original wooden panelling in the main bedroom. A fine range of mid to late 19th century stone farm buildings survives intact. Of special interest is an integral and innovative silo dating to the second half of the 19th century, probably built when the farm was in the ownership of Daniel Radford. A stone butterwell is also of significance. Oral recollection from the 1920s has provided particular human context, and the chance survival of family papers from 1945-1950 gives specific detail of farming life then. Attention is drawn to some features of archaeological interest, including a well-preserved area of tin streamworks of likely 17th century or earlier date, surviving within the farm enclosures.\n\nThis is an updated manuscript containing several additions of information that has come to light. Some of it during a trip to the Mallee in May 2019 and some that has come up in the Ancestry data base. It does not alter the overall story but clarifies little bits of it here and there."
