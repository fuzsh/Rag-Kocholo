It may not be accurate to call the television programs listed below “lost” because I don’t know for sure that copies aren’t hidden away in an archive or a dusty attic somewhere. But it’s hard to prove something doesn’t exist. Whether they’re missing or truly lost, these programs are just a small sampling of what television had to offer viewers in the 1940s and 1950s. I’ve indicated whether audio recordings, photographs, or scripts for the programs do survive. Note that all episode counts are taken from television listings in The New York Times.

If you have any information about any of these programs, please contact me.

Thrills and Chills Everywhere (NBC/DuMont, 1941-1946?)

Doug Allen hosted this half-hour program, also known as Thrills and Chills, that presented “adventure” films from around the world and the explorers who made them. It aired on WNBT in New York City from 1941 to 1942 before moving to the experimental DuMont station in that city, W2XWV, where it may have remained until 1946. Read more about the program here and here.
