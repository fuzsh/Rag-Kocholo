        "text": "OUR FOUNDER:\n\nF.A. “Frank” Seiberling\n\nIn 1898, F.A. “Frank” Seiberling traveled to Chicago on business and came away as the owner of two empty factories on Market Street in Akron, Ohio. The 38-year-old had no idea how he would use them, but he and his brother C.W. “Charley” Seiberling soon began making rubber products, such as horseshoe pads, poker chips and carriage and bicycle tires. Little did the brothers know that the coming adoption of the automobile would lead to their start-up company becoming a powerful global brand.\n\nOUR INSPIRATION:\n\nCharles Goodyear\n\nThe Seiberlings were inspired by the spirit of discovery embodied by chemist, engineer and inventor Charles Goodyear. In 1839, Goodyear discovered that when a mixture of “gum elastic” – natural rubber – and sulfur were exposed to heat, the compound became pliable, resilient and durable. This process was subsequently called “vulcanization” and opened the door to the manufacture of rubber products such as tires.\n\nOUR HOME:\n\nAkron, Ohio, USA\n\nIn addition to Akron being the home of the Seiberling brothers, the manufacturing town of 50,000 was already base of other rubber companies in 1898. It had a reliable workforce already in place and was located near the Little Cuyahoga River and the B&O Railroad line, which would make for convenient shipping of materials. As the company grew, so did Akron, which eventually became known as the “Rubber Capital of the World.”\n\nBrands\n\nDrivers around the world have come to trust Goodyear tires for their quality, dependability and value. The company’s commitment to earning the trust of drivers everywhere comes through in its other brands as well, such as Kelly and Dunlop. In Europe, Goodyear makes and sells tires under the Sava, Debica and Fulda brands, and in 2021, the company acquired Cooper Tire and its family of brands.\n\n1935: Kelly Tires becomes a sister brand\n\n1962: Fulda and Metal Wheel Company acquired\n\n1995: Majority control of TC Debica acquired\n\n1999: Dunlop added to the portfolio through a joint venture\n\n2021: Cooper Tire becomes companies largest acquisition\n\nIcons\n\nCentral to Goodyear’s corporate logo is the winged foot of Mercury. Founder F.A. Seiberling was inspired by a statuette of the Roman deity which was the “messenger of the gods” and was the patron of such things as travel and commerce. Perhaps no corporate icon is as well-known as the Goodyear Blimp. The company began building airships for the military during WWI and in 1925, began producing blimps for its marketing efforts. Since then, more than 300 Goodyear Blimps have adorned the skies around the world.\n\nRacing\n\nIn the early 1900s, Henry Ford wanted to test his automobiles by racing, so his first call was to Goodyear. Since then, the company’s tires have been in the winner’s circle in almost every form of racing imaginable – from NASCAR and IndyCar to the Dakar Rally and the 24 Hours of LeMans. The racetrack provides the perfect testing ground for innovation, as many of the developments in racing tires have been adapted for passenger vehicles across the globe.\n\nThe War Years\n\nGoodyear converted much of its tire manufacturing to production of items to support war efforts. Bullet-proof fuel tanks, gas masks, rubber rafts and the like were built by women, retirees and others who were not on active duty. During WWII, Goodyear’s aviation division built the nimble Corsair aircraft as well as engines and guidance systems. During the 1940s, Goodyear and other tire companies collaborated on the rapid development of synthetic rubber, which became a critical component of product beyond tires in the decades that followed.\n\nThe Space Age\n\nWith the expansion of space exploration, Goodyear’s scientists were responsible for the development of satellites, antennae, guidance systems and more. One of its most important innovations was a computer called STARAN, which had the world’s first content-addressable memory, which we now call a “search engine.” Goodyear played a role in space exploration as well, making fabric flotation devices used to recover spacecraft and astronauts returning to earth.\n\nPolymers\n\nGoodyear’s scientists led the development of such products as plastics and foam, film and flooring, hoses and belts and latex items for industries as diverse as medical and food service. In 1976, a polymer developed in Goodyear’s lab was used as the membrane for an artificial heart built in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic. That technology enabled other breakthroughs in artificial hearts, which have saved and prolonged many lives.\n\nTires\n\nGoodyear’s innovative tires have been industry leaders for more than 125 years. The company introduced the first “all-weather” tire, sent tires to the moon and claims the winningest racing tires around the world. Throughout its history, Goodyear has enhanced mobility from streets and highways to farms and work sites…and even in the skies. It has developed tires that improve traction on slippery roads, maximize fuel economy and continue to run even when flat.\n\nScience\n\nGoodyear’s scientists, engineers and researchers have continually discovered new solutions and opportunities for changing mobility needs. For example, polymer research led to the development of synthetic rubber for use in tires and beyond. Material science unearthed new components to enhance performance and durability. And new technology was applied to tire design and enabled virtual tire testing.\n\nBusiness\n\nGoodyear is more than a tire manufacturer. Since its founding, Goodyear has evolved to become a technology-driven company that enables mobility. Along the way, it also has innovated its business models, expanded its manufacturing and sales and even became the first tire brand to sell directly to consumers online. More breakthroughs, such as mobile tire installation, are setting the pace for the industry for the next 125 years."
