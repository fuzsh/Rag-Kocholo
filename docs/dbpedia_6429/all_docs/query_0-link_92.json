        "text": "1932 Endy Awards\n\nSo I decided to go ahead and keep on handing out awards, limiting myself to years in which I’ve seen at least 40 movies to get a good base from which to arbitrarily assign fake trophies. The earliest year from which I’ve seen 40 is 1932, so we’re starting here. As always, eligibility is determined by the year imdb assigns to the film and if I haven’t seen it, I can’t award it.

Vampyr\n\nThis Week in Rankings\n\nThese are the movies I’ve watched or rewatched over the last week or so, along with where they place in my year-by-year rankings. I’ve linked each to my short reviews on letterboxd as well. As you can see, I’ve been watching a lot of Johnnie To-related movies in preparation for a new episode of They Shot Pictures (check out the recently posted episode on Mikio Naruse). I also revived the Endy Awards (2011 and 2012), look for more of that kind of thing in the coming weeks.\n\nA Better Tomorrow – 1, 1986\n\nCity on Fire – 9, 1987\n\nPorco Rosso – 6, 1992\n\nPom Poko – 8, 1994\n\nComrades: Almost a Love Story – 1, 1996\n\nToo Many Ways to Be No. 1 – 7, 1997\n\nWhere a Good Man Goes – 15, 1999\n\nNeeding You – 10, 2000\n\nFulltime Killer – 14, 2001\n\nThe Heroic Duo – 26, 2003\n\nMoonrise Kingdom – 1, 2012\n\nArgo – 50, 2012\n\n2011 Endy Awards\n\nAfter not being able to see many movies before Oscartime last year, due to baby-induced home-boundness, I’d always meant to come back and do a proper awards post for 2011, something I’d forgot about until putting together the awards for 2012 this past week. So with Endies on the mind, I guess now is as good a time as any to reward the best of what I’ve seen from 2011. As always, eligibility is determined by the date given by imdb. I’ll list the nominees in each category in alphabetical order and the winner will be in bold.\n\nBest Picture:\n\n1. Damsels in Distress\n\n2. The Day He Arrives\n\n3. The Deep Blue Sea\n\n4. Don’t Go Breaking My Heart\n\n5. Girl Walk // All Day\n\n6. List\n\n7. Margaret\n\n8. Romance Joe\n\n9. The Tree of Life\n\n10. Wuxia\n\nBest Director:\n\n1. Hong Sangsoo, The Day He Arrives\n\n2. Terence Davies, The Deep Blue Sea\n\n3. Johnnie To, Don’t Go Breaking My Heart\n\n4. Kenneth Lonergan, Margaret\n\n5. Terrence Malick, The Tree of Life\n\nBest Actor:\n\n1. Jack Black, Bernie\n\n2. Yoo Junsang, The Day He Arrives\n\n3. Liam Neesen, The Grey\n\n4. Michael Shannon, Take Shelter 5. Gary Oldman, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\n\nBest Actress:\n\n1. Greta Gerwig, Damsels in Distress\n\n2. Rachel Weisz, The Deep Blue Sea\n\n3. Anne Marsen, Girl Walk // All Day\n\n4. Anna Paquin, Margaret\n\n5. Leila Hatami, A Separation\n\nThe actor category for this year is merely OK, but this might be the strongest group of actresses ever. Can’t believe there’s no room for Tilda Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin, Gao Yuanyuan in Don’t Go Breaking My Heart, Carlen Altman in The Color Wheel, Michelle Williams in Take this Waltz, Jessica Chastain in Take Shelter and Charlize Theron in Young Adult.\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\n1. Sonny Carl Davis, Bernie\n\n2. Tom Hiddleston, The Deep Blue Sea\n\n3. John Doyle, Girl Walk // All Day\n\n4. Lau Ching-wan, Life Without Principle\n\n5. Brad Pitt, The Tree of Life\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\n1. Megalyn Echikunwoke, Damsels in Distress\n\n2. Carrie MacLemore, Damsels in Distress\n\n2. Cécile De France, The Kid with a Bike\n\n3. Denise Ho, Life Without Principle\n\n5. J. Smith-Cameron, Margaret\n\nOriginal Screenplay:\n\n1. Whit Stillman, Damsels in Distress\n\n2. Hong Sangsoo, The Day He Arrives\n\n3. Milkyway Team, Don’t Go Breaking My Heart\n\n4. Kenneth Lonergan, Margaret\n\n5. Lee Kwangkuk, Romance Joe\n\nAdapted Screenplay:\n\n1. Richard Linklater, Bernie\n\n2. Terence Davies, The Deep Blue Sea\n\n3. Craig Schulz & Stephan Pastis, Happiness is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown\n\n4. John Logan, Hugo\n\n5. Lynne Ramsay & Rory Kinnear, We Need to Talk About Kevin\n\nForeign Language Film:\n\n1. The Day He Arrives (Hong Sangsoo)\n\n2. Don’t Go Breaking My Heart (Johnnie To)\n\n3. Romance Joe (Lee Kwangkuk)\n\n4. A Separation (Asghar Farhadi)\n\n5. Wuxia (Peter Chan)\n\nA great year for Johnnie To and his collaborators at his Milkyway Image studio, with two of my favorite films of the year. Unfortunately, they came up short awards-wise, barely beaten out in the supporting acting categories and edged by masterful work in directing and original screenplay. Foreign Language film was probably their best shot, but Hong Sangsoo’s The Day He Arrives is one of his best.\n\nDocumentary Feature:\n\n1. All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace (Adam Curtis)\n\n2. Crazy Horse (Frederick Wiseman)\n\n3. Fragments: Surviving Pieces of Lost Films\n\n4. Pina (Wim Wenders)\n\n5. The Story of Film: An Odyssey (Mark Cousins)\n\nAnimated Feature:\n\n1. The Adventures of Tintin\n\n2. Happiness is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown\n\n3. Rango\n\n4. Winnie the Pooh\n\nThe best Peanuts special since The Great Pumpkin, seamlessly integrating the classic strips and characters into modern animation techniques (POV shots, computer-rendered crane shots) while respecting and preserving the unique stylization of Charles Schulz’s original drawings.\n\nAnimated Short:\n\n1. La Luna\n\nLive Action Short:\n\n1. La belle epoque (Hou Hsiao-hsien)\n\n2. Green Island Serenade (Hou Chi-jan)\n\n3. Key (Leon Dai)\n\n4. Ritual (Wang Toon)\n\n5. Unwritten Rules (Cheng Yu-chieh)\n\nThese are all part of the Taiwan Film Festival’s compendium 10 + 10, a series of 20 short films by 10 veteran and 10 younger Taiwanese directors. A mild upset here as Hou Hsiao-hsien was the heavy favorite, but Hou Chi-jan’s swoon-inducing musical time travel picture won me over.\n\nFilm Editing:\n\n1. A Dangerous Method\n\n2. The Day He Arrives\n\n3. The Deep Blue Sea\n\n4. Life Without Principle\n\n5. The Tree of Life\n\nCinematography:\n\n1. Florian Hoffmesiter, The Deep Blue Sea\n\n2. Gökhan Tiryaki, Once Upon a Time in Anatolia\n\n3. Emmanuel Lubezki, The Tree of Life\n\n4. Janusz Kaminski, War Horse\n\n5. Saemus McGarvey, We Need to Talk About Kevin\n\nArt Direction:\n\n1. The Cabin in the Woods\n\n2. The Deep Blue Sea\n\n3. Flying Swords of Dragon Gate\n\n4. Hugo\n\n5. The Turin Horse\n\nCostume Design:\n\n1. The Artist\n\n2. Damsels in Distress\n\n3. The Deep Blue Sea\n\n4. Hugo\n\n5. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\n\nMake-up:\n\n1. East Meets West\n\n2. The Grey\n\n3. Super 8\n\nSound Mixing:\n\n1. The Deep Blue Sea\n\n2. Hugo\n\n3. The Tree of Life\n\n4. The Turin Horse\n\n5. We Need To Talk About Kevin\n\nSound Editing:\n\n1. Hugo\n\n2. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\n\n3. Super 8\n\n4. War Horse\n\n5. We Need To Talk About Kevin\n\nVisual Effects:\n\n1. The Cabin in the Woods\n\n2. Flying Swords of Dragon Gate\n\n3. Hugo\n\n4. Rise of the Planet of the Apes\n\n5. Wuxia\n\nOriginal Score:\n\n1. Damsels in Distress\n\n2. Drive\n\n3. The Muppets\n\n4. The Tree of Life\n\n5. The Turin Horse\n\nSoundtrack:\n\n1. Company\n\n2. The Deep Blue Sea\n\n3. Girl Walk // All Day\n\n4. Midnight in Paris\n\n5. The Tree of Life\n\nI would have loved to give more awards to The Deep Blue Sea, but Davies’s screenplay and this for soundtrack will have to do. The group singalongs give the film’s love triangle a historic perspective, one of lives shattered in a community similarly shattered by the war. Hilary Hahn’s recording of Samuel Barber’s Violin Concerto makes up the rest of the soundtrack, and Davies times his camera movements and edits perfectly with the melodramatic swoops of the music. The film’s opening sequence is one of the great achievements in recent history.\n\nThey Shot Pictures Episode #11: Mikio Naruse\n\nI’m back on the They Shot Pictures podcast this week talking about Mikio Naruse. I spent most of January watching his movies, enjoy as I mix them all up and sound more critical of Kenji Mizoguchi than I really meant to be. I hope to be on the show again in a few weeks to talk about Johnnie To (I’ve been watching as many of his movies as I can lately. I’m trying to squeeze it in before just baby #2 arrives at the end of March and brings my movie-watching (and sanity) to an end for a few months (at least).\n\nYou can download the show from the They Shot Pictures website, or look for the show on iTunes. From there you can also find my prior appearances on the Josef von Sternberg, Yasujiro Ozu and Hou Hsiao-hsien episodes, along with all the other great shows that I don’t appear on.\n\nSome Notes on the 2012 Endy Awards\n\nYesterday I announced the nominations for this year’s Endy Awards. Here’s a brief look at some of the nominees, in anticipation of tomorrow’s big announcement.\n\nFilms ranked by number of nominations:\n\n10 – The Master\n\n9 – Moonrise Kingdom\n\n8 – Night Across the Street\n\n7 – In Another Country\n\n6 – Like Someone in Love & Zero Dark Thirty\n\n5 – Django Unchained & Holy Motors\n\n4 – Lincoln\n\n3 – Mekong Hotel, Something in the Air & Tabu\n\n2 – Nine films\n\n1 – Five Films\n\nOf the five Best Picture/Director nominees, four are directors who have previously won Endies:\n\nAbbas Kiarostami in 1997 for Taste of Cherry (Film Editing), 1999 for The Wind Will Carry Us (Foreign Language Film) and 2010 for Certified Copy (Best Picture, Foreign Language Film).\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson in 1997 for Boogie Nights (Best Picture, Director, Original Screenplay), 1999 for Magnolia (Original Screenplay), 2002 for Punch-Drunk Love (Best Picture) and in 2007 for There Will Be Blood (Adapted Screenplay)\n\nWes Anderson in 2001 for The Royal Tenenbaums (Best Original Screenplay) and 2009 for Fantastic Mr. Fox (Adapted Screenplay and Animated Feature)\n\nHong Sangsoo in 2010 for Oki’s Movie and Hahaha (Best Original Screenplay).\n\nIf I ever get around to revising these awards (most of which I handed out back in 2008, four and a half long years worth of movie-watching ago), the fifth nominee, Raúl Ruiz, will likely pick up an award or two for his 2010 film Mysteries of Lisbon.\n\nSo, will this year see the first Best Picture win after several award-winning screenplays for Wes Anderson? Will Hong Sangsoo become the first Korean filmmaker to win Picture or Director? Will Abbas Kiarostami accomplish the rare feat of winning Best Picture with back-to-back films, something only Terrence Malick (with The New World and Tree of Life), Alfred Hitchcock (North by Northwest and Psycho) and Powell & Pressburger (Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes) have done before? Or will longtime Endy favorite Paul Thomas Anderson pick up his third Best Picture Endy, making him the most decorated filmmaker of his generation? Tune in tomorrow morning to find out.\n\nEndy Nominations: 2012\n\nReviving a tradition I had to abandon last year after spending the second half of 2011 in a baby-induced movie-free zone, it’s time to nominate some movies for some end of the year awards. I’ll list the nominees in each category here, and then on Saturday publish the winners, along with my predictions for the winners of that other set of awards. As always when assigning dates here at The End, movies are categorized based on their imdb date, which means that a number of films that would be Endy favorites (Damsels in Distress, Margaret, The Deep Blue Sea, etc) are not eligible for this year while several films that won’t open theatrically in the US until 2013 are eligilbe.\n\nBest Picture:\n\n1.

I’ve been tracking the movies I watch on letterboxd as well. You can read the little bits I’ve said about some of these, as well as check out some lists over there, or by following the link on the movie title. I’ve also updated my Review Index to include some of the shorter reviews I’ve written over the last couple of years.\n\nGabriel Over the White House – 25, 1933\n\nThe Longest Nite – 13, 1998\n\nRunning Out of Time – 6, 1999\n\nRunning Out of Time 2 – 7, 2001\n\nRunning on Karma – 7, 2003\n\nThrow Down – 9, 2004\n\nMad Detective – 9, 2007\n\nThe Five-Year Engagement – 48, 2012\n\nA Very Wong Kar-wai Valentine’s Day\n\nI originally posted these as A Filmography of Wong Kar-wai in Eighteen Images over at Metro Classics when we played Chungking Express in November of 2009, but I think it’s appropriate for the holiday today."
