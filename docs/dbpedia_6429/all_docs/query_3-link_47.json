        "text": "From: Canadian Intellectual Property Office\n\nThe Nice Classification is administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and consists of a list of 45 classes together with explanatory notes. There are 34 classes of goods and 11 classes of services. The class headings describe in very broad terms the nature of the goods or services contained in each class. The explanatory notes of a given class describe in greater detail the types of goods or services included in that class.\n\nIt is important to note that the Nice Classification does not supersede the Trademarks Act and Trademarks Regulations. Consequently, the provisions under the Canadian legislation for specifying all goods and services pursuant to paragraph 30(2)(a) of the Trademarks Act prevail.\n\nThe CIPO Goods and Services Manual can assist you in recognizing acceptable statements of goods and services and their associated class. You can search by individual good or service or a list of goods or services.
