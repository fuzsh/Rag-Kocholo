        "text": "We often speak to friends and family who feel certain that their loved one made a will before they died, but they haven’t been able to find it - you can make a will today at Farewill.\n\nIf you’re in this situation, here are a few things you could try:\n\nA thorough search of your loved one’s property\n\nAs well as looking through all the paperwork and filing cabinets, sometimes people store their wills in unusual places, like the loft or the basement, under the floorboards or under the mattress of their bed.\n\nAsk neighbours, family, other friends and the witnesses of the will\n\nThey might be able to recall where the will was stored from a conversation they might’ve had. .\n\nCheck with the bank\n\nAlthough banks don’t tend to offer their storage facilities to customers as much these days, it’s always worth checking in with them to see if they could be holding any personal documents in safe custody.\n\nSome banks do offer will writing and executor services and if they did write the will or are named as executors of the will, they might have kept the original document.\n\nWhat an executor does\n\nAn ‘executor’ is the person or persons who are named in the will. They have the responsibility of administering the estate and making sure that the written wishes of the person who has died are followed. An ‘estate’ is all the money and property someone owned on their death, after the payment of any debts and liabilities.\n\nYou can read more about the duties of an executor.\n\nCheck with local solicitors\n\nYou could try calling around local solicitor practices near where your loved one lived. If they recently moved houses, it might also be worth speaking to firms near their old address.\n\nCarry out a search of the National Will Register, Certainty\n\nIt might be that the will was registered with the National Will Register, which is now recommended by many organisations and used by solicitors, the public, charities and financial institutions. You can carry out a search of the register here.\n\nCarry out a search of the Probate Registry\n\nThe will might’ve already been sent to the Probate Registry by the executors of the estate and the grant of probate may already have been issued. You can search for wills that have gone through probate here. You can read more information about how to find a will.\n\nThese days, only the named executors are initially entitled to read the will. You could ask the executors for a copy of the will, but legally they don’t have to give it to you. Any financial institutions, solicitors or other organisations should always ask the executors for permission before sending the will onto anyone else.\n\nIf probate is needed to deal with the estate, once it’s granted by the Court, the will becomes a public document and anyone can apply to the Probate Registry for a copy of it for a small fee. Don’t forget, applying for a probate isn’t always necessary when someone dies. And if a grant of probate isn’t issued by the Court, the will can stay private for as long as the executor wishes.\n\nWhat is probate?\n\nProbate (short for 'a grant of probate') is a legal document that shows banks, the Land Registry and other organisations that someone has the authority to deal with someone else’s estate. We’ve written a separate article on what is probate.\n\nIf an executor refuses to release a copy of the will to you as a beneficiary, you should think about getting your own independent legal advice. It might be possible for you to apply to the Court to make the executor apply for probate so that the will becomes public. This doesn’t happen very often though, and you may find it more beneficial to try and reach an agreement with the executor through open communications, where possible.\n\nFinding out if probate is needed on an estate can be confusing, so our specialists have created a free tool that checks for you. Answer a few questions to understand when probate is required to get started.\n\nThere are no set rules in place that say exactly when an executor should notify a beneficiary of their interest in a will. But, it’s thought to be good and common practice for beneficiaries to be notified early on in the estate administration process.\n\nThe estate administration covers the period of time from the date of death to when the final payments to the beneficiaries can be calculated. The process of administering an estate includes closing bank accounts, paying off any debts, selling or transferring the property of the person who has died and paying inheritance to the beneficiaries.\n\nIf the executors are professional companies, like banks or solicitor firms, you can expect them to contact you soon after they’ve been notified of the death and have set up their file for the estate.\n\nSome solicitors agree to keep beneficiaries updated regularly throughout the estate administration. Others will only get in touch when they’re ready to make payments to beneficiaries from the estate (known as ‘distributions’). Depending on what the assets are in the estate, as a beneficiary you may be asked whether you’d like the assets sold or transferred to you.\n\nIf the executors are not professionals, they’ll still be expected to contact you to let you know about the death and that you’ve been named in the will. If you think you might’ve been named as a beneficiary of a will, but you haven’t heard anything and some time has passed since the death, you should consider seeking some legal advice.\n\nAs a beneficiary, you might find it helpful to know how long it will take for the will to be executed. This depends on each individual case.\n\nSome estates will have complicated assets, like business assets, overseas properties or farmland. These sorts of assets can take a long time to value and deal with. Other estates can be more straightforward, with just a few bank accounts and utility bills to close down.\n\nThe process of getting probate once an application has been submitted to the Probate Registry often takes between 1-3 months. It can then take up to 6 months to close accounts, sell or transfer investments and pay taxes. You can read some further guidance on these timescales at how long does probate take.\n\nIf there’s a property in the estate to be sold, it can take up to 12 months or more for the will to be executed. This depends on things like the property market and other factors like the condition and price of the property.\n\nThe executor's year\n\nAn executor will never be legally forced to pay out to the beneficiaries of a will until one year has passed from the date of death: this is called the ‘executor’s year’.\n\nYou may be wondering when you can expect to receive your inheritance from the will or, if you’re a residuary beneficiary, when you’ll get the balance of the estate. This all depends on the particular circumstances of the estate.\n\nSpecific beneficiaries will usually receive their items gifted in the will very early on in the process. General and residuary beneficiaries will often need to wait until probate is granted and any debts are paid.\n\nSometimes there can be delays to the process. Here are a few of the most common causes of delay:\n\nExecutors might disagree on how to administer the estate\n\nProperty sale might fall through\n\nIt might be difficult to locate beneficiaries\n\nThere may be missing or complicated assets\n\nThere might be a missing will or missing property title deeds\n\nThere may be an investigation of the estate by the Department of Work and Pensions\n\nIf it’s a relatively straightforward estate with few debts or liabilities and probate isn’t required, you could receive your inheritance within 1-3 months.\n\nIf probate is required, it could take on average between 6-9 months for you to receive your inheritance.\n\nIt’s common for residuary beneficiaries to receive their inheritance at different stages. For example, they could receive a partial payment of their inheritance once most of the bank accounts and investments have been closed.\n\nA final payment could then be made once the property has been sold (if there is one) or once all the remaining expenses have been paid.\n\nAs a beneficiary, it might be possible for you to decide to have shareholdings or property transferred to you. This can happen when there’s enough other liquid cash available in the estate (for example from banks and building society accounts) to pay off any debts, taxes and expenses as well as paying any other beneficiaries their share of the estate.\n\nAs a beneficiary you might want to give some of your inheritance away or change the wording of a will in order to reduce the amount of tax payable.\n\nYou can change a person’s will after their death, as long as any other beneficiaries aren’t left worse off by the changes and agree to the changes you want to make. (source).\n\nA deed of variation is an official document that allows beneficiaries to change who inherits the estate. You can find out more about deeds of variation. Deeds of variation need to be completed within 2 years of the death. We’d recommend that you seek separate legal advice if you’re thinking about preparing a deed of variation as they can be complex.\n\nMake sure your own will’s done right\n\nMaking changes to a will of someone who has died can be a lot of work. If you’re thinking about making your own will and you’d like to make sure it’s done properly, our telephone and online will writing services are quick, simple and stress-free."
